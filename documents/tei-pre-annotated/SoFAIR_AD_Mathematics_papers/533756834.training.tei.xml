        <p>Individual variation in susceptibility and exposure is subject to selection by natural infection, accelerating the acquisition of immunity, and reducing herd immunity thresholds and epidemic final sizes. This is a manifestation of a wider population phenomenon known as ''frailty variation". Despite theoretical understanding, public health policies continue to be guided by mathematical models that leave out considerable variation and as a result inflate projected disease burdens and overestimate the impact of interventions. Here we focus on trajectories of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in England and Scotland until November 2021. We fit models to series of daily deaths and infer relevant epidemiological parameters, including coefficients of variation and effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions which we find in agreement with independent empirical estimates based on contact surveys. Our estimates are robust to whether the analysed data series encompass one or two pandemic waves and enable projections compatible with subsequent dynamics. We conclude that vaccination programmes may have contributed modestly to the acquisition of herd immunity in populations with high levels of pre-existing naturally acquired immunity, while being crucial to protect vulnerable individuals from severe outcomes as the virus becomes endemic.Individual variation in susceptibility and exposure is subject to selection by natural infection, accelerating the acquisition of immunity, and reducing herd immunity thresholds and epidemic final sizes.

        <p>Almost 100 years ago, Kermack and McKendrick (1927) published a general and flexible model to study epidemics and fitted particular versions to observed epidemics (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927;McKendrick, 1939). Already back then they alerted for the simplifying assumption "that all infected persons are equivalent, and that all susceptible persons are equally liable to acquire infection" (McKendrick, 1939). In their fittings they adjust not only transmission parameters but also the size of the susceptible and exposed populations at epidemic onset. Susceptible and exposed population sizes needed to be adjusted so their homogeneous models could fit the data.Almost 100 years ago, Kermack and McKendrick (1927) published a general and flexible model to study epidemics and fitted particular versions to observed epidemics (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927;McKendrick, 1939).

        <p>Thirty years later, Gart (1968) admited that ''it is difficult to define exactly the size of the population of susceptible hosts. In this instance the difficulty is associated with the heterogeneous nature of the population". The author divided the population in two groups, depending on individual histories of infection, and allowed much greater susceptibility in the group with no previous infections. This did not seem sufficient to provide good fit to observed epidemics as the author adds ''we assume that the first group is a homogeneous group of susceptibles, while the second is actually a mixture of immune and susceptible individuals". In Gart (1971) the author extended the model to several susceptibility groups, and, more than a decade later, Ball (1985) compared a model with several susceptibility groups to the homogeneous version and described how homogeneity assumptions increase epidemic size. Coutinho et al. (1999) expanded the formalisms to also account for individual variation in incubation period and recovery but concluded that ''at present practical applications might be difficult". Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani (2001) developed related formalisms to describe epidemics on contact networks.Thirty years later, Gart (1968) admited that ''it is difficult to define exactly the size of the population of susceptible hosts.

        <p>On the experimental side, Dwyer et al. (1997) measured nonlinear relationships between transmission and densities of susceptible hosts, implying that the bilinear term in the classical susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model may not be appropriate. The authors attributed the nonlinearity in transmission to heterogeneity in host susceptibility to infection which they estimated from the shapes of dose-response curves. Finkenstädt and Grenfell (2000) fitted a model with nonlinear relationships between transmission and density of susceptible hosts to an observed epidemic and estimated the exponent, which they interpreted as heterogeneity in mixing. Novozhilov (2008) derived the expressions for the exponents from explicit gamma distributions of susceptibility and Montalbán et al. (2020) provided a more tractable derivation that applies exactly to heterogeneity in susceptibility and approximately to heterogeneity in exposure to infection.On the experimental side, Dwyer et al.

        <p>We use susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) models (Diekmann et al., 2013) incorporating continuous distributions of individual susceptibility or exposure to infection (Ball, 1985;Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2001;Novozhilov, 2008;Katriel, 2012;Gomes, 2020). We then use Bayesian inference to estimate model parameters by fitting series of deaths while accounting for, and estimating the magnitude of, the combined effects of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), voluntary behavioural change, seasonality, viral evolution, and any other factors which might have contributed to time dependency in transmission potential. We estimate basic reproduction numbers (R 0 ) consistent with early literature (Flaxman et al., 2020;Hilton and Keeling, 2020;Kwok et al., 2020) and coefficients of variation in agreement with direct measurements based on contact-pattern studies (Mossong et al., 2008;Hens et al., 2009;Willem et al., 2012). We show that individual variation in susceptibility or exposure to infection can significantly affect basic metrics, such as the herd immunity thresholds (HIT), as well as model projections and assessment of intervention impacts.We use susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) models (Diekmann et al., 2013) incorporating continuous distributions of individual susceptibility or exposure to infection (Ball, 1985;Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2001;Novozhilov, 2008;Katriel, 2012;Gomes, 2020).

        <p>An epidemic is simulated by introducing a small seed of infectious individuals in a susceptible population. Initial growth of infected densities is near exponential but decelerates as individuals are removed from the susceptible pool by infection and immunity. With variation in susceptibility, highly susceptible individuals tend to be infected earlier, leaving behind a residual pool of lower mean susceptibility. This selective depletion intensifies the deceleration of epidemic growth and gives an efficient head start to the acquisition of population immunity. Eventually the epidemic will subside and the HIT, defining the percentage of the population that needs to be immune to reverse epidemic growth and prevent future waves, is lower when variation in susceptibility is higher.

        <p>This is an indicator of early transmissibility but its use quickly becomes cumbersome. Several factors, such as NPIs, adaptive changes in human behaviour, seasonality and viral evolution, affect R 0 in a time-dependent manner.

After L 1 , contact restrictions are gradually relaxed and we allow transmission to begin a linear increase such that cðtÞ reaches the baseline (cðtÞ ¼ 1) in T 2 days, which may or may not be within the range of this study.

        <p>In a directly transmitted infectious disease, such as COVID-19, variation in exposure to infection is primarily governed by patterns of connectivity among individuals. We incorporate this in system (1)-(4) assuming that individuals mix at random (Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2001;Miller et al., 2012). In a related study we developed an assortative mixing version of the model (Aguas et al., 2020). With random mixing and heterogeneous connectivity, the force of infection is written Fig. 2.

Whether cðtÞ is allowed to increase beyond baseline (solid) or not (dashed) does not affect our results as we consistently find the factor to remain below baseline throughout the study period.In a directly transmitted infectious disease, such as COVID-19, variation in exposure to infection is primarily governed by patterns of connectivity among individuals.

        <p>Note that while we report CV in all fits, our method is not purposed to estimate levels of heterogeneity solely in susceptibility or connectivity as a goal. Because the two forms of heterogeneity have similar effects on epidemic trajectories, separating relative contributions would pose an identifiability problem that our approach does not address. Each heterogeneity model we consider assumes that there is no heterogeneity of the other kind. From fitting these two extremes, however, we conclude that they are equally able to fit data and have similar consequences for metrics of interest and projections. Hence a decomposition is not necessary for our purposes.Note that while we report CV in all fits, our method is not purposed to estimate levels of heterogeneity solely in susceptibility or connectivity as a goal.

        <p>June 2021. We find that both nations remain below the natural herd immunity threshold H (Scotland more than England). Hence, without vaccination, an exit wave might have been expected. To visualise its magnitude we include separate panels on the right where the model is run for approximately 12 months, using as initial conditions the end conditions from left panels and R c ðtÞ ¼ R 0 . Here this is done crudely but in Section S1 we explore a range of vaccination scenarios and in Section 5.6 we refine the projections in the case of England (the same could be done for Scotland). It is striking that heterogeneous models project exit waves one order of magnitude lower (or less) than when homogeneity is assumed, a feature that we explore more thoroughly in Section 5.6.June 2021.

        <p>In Supplementary Material we also show that these results are robust to including reinfection (with a risk of 0:1 relative to the average risk of first infection (Hall et al., 2021)) (Section S2), arriving at similar HITs, and changing IFR (to 0:7% or 1:0%) (Section S3). Outcomes agree with the expectation that assuming a lower IFR results in higher HIT, and a higher IFR results in lower HIT. Less intuitive is that when we fit the models with a different IFR, all parameters readjust and exit waves appear relatively conserved (perhaps slightly slower with lower IFR (higher HIT) and higher with higher IFR (lower HIT), illustrating the fragility of taking HITs out of context). Similar conserveness is noticed when reinfection is included. Model selection by AIC continues to favour heterogeneous models by large in all scenarios.In Supplementary Material we also show that these results are robust to including reinfection (with a risk of 0:1 relative to the average risk of first infection (Hall et al., 2021)) (Section S2), arriving at similar HITs, and changing IFR (to 0:7% or 1:0%) (Section S3).

To test suitability of our methods for such task, we apply fitting procedures to series of COVID-19 deaths in England and Scotland until 1 July 2020, as Europe was recovering from the first wave. As an initial exploration we perform the fittings as in Section 5.1, estimating all parameters in (26) except c 2 which had no effect prior to November 2020. The results, displayed in Supplementary Material (Section S4), provide similar estimates to those obtained with longer series in Section 5.1 except for parameter T 2 that determines the slope of contact reactivation following lifting of first lockdown.

        <p>Informed by preliminary analysis in Section S4, we first run a scenario where cðtÞ remains strictly horizontal until end of fitting period (T 2 ! 1, Fig. 7). This assumption appears to align with stringency index, a composite measure based on government response indicators (school closures, workplace closures, travel bans, etc) developed by Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) (Hale et al., 2020) (blue in R c panels, scaled to match lower and higher bounds in our stylised profiles). Support for heterogeneous models is again very significant according to AIC scores, and optimal parameter values result in similar HITs to when T 2 was estimated: H ¼ 34% (95% CI, 25 À 57%) for heterogeneous models; and H ¼ 70% (95% CI, 68 À 71%) for homogeneous. Compare Tables 2 (T 2 ! 1) and S5 (T 2 estimated). Second, we run a scenario with finite T 2 to inform how estimated parameters might respond to assumptions about contact reactivation. Assuming T 2 ¼ 120 days (crudely motivated by mobility data (Google, 2020), blue dots in Fig. 8), we find that support for heterogeneous models persists but estimated coefficients of variation become larger, reflecting in lower HITs (H ¼ 15% (95% CI, 12 À 17%), Table 3). In absence of further information we might have expected true parameter values to be somewhere between these two scenarios. This is supported by results on longer COVID-19 series in Section 5.1 (H in the range 25 À 29%, Table 1), which is inside, but towards the low end, of the range motivated by stringency index.Informed by preliminary analysis in Section S4, we first run a scenario where cðtÞ remains strictly horizontal until end of fitting period (T 2 ! 1, Fig. 7).

To enable fittings to the two nations we modify the Scottish stringency to resemble the English from the 1 July 2020 onwards. The results are provided in Fig. 10 and Table 4.

        <p>Overall this analysis suggests that, in the eventuality of future pandemics, our models, with more or less stylised mitigations, can be used consistently at differently stages as the epidemic unfolds. This study of England and Scotland demonstrates that although applications will always benefit from knowledge of time-dependent effects on transmission, considerable progress can be made by model-based inference before detailed measurements of such factors are available. It is also possible for sensibly designed stylised models to perform better than those constrained by incomplete information. Inferences should be subsequently tested, however, and assumptions improved as more data becomes available.Overall this analysis suggests that, in the eventuality of future pandemics, our models, with more or less stylised mitigations, can be used consistently at differently stages as the epidemic unfolds.

Forth, our time-dependent transmission profiles, cðtÞ (parameterised by T 0 and T 2 ), align well with the stringency index (Hale et al., 2020) and might align even better with some hybrid indicator combining government measures with voluntary adaptive behavioural changes (as captured by mobility patterns tracked by

        <p>Contact patterns provide one of the easiest sources of heterogeneity to study directly. One approach is to use large-scale diary experiments to collect self-reported logs of close or physical contact from study participants.

In Fig. 11 we show gamma-fits for the contact distribution of each study on a log scale, along with the CV for each empirical distribution.

        <p>In addition to the magnitude of individual variation in connectivity, the time scale of that variation is another important determinant for the effect of selection in accelerating the acquisition of population immunity (Tkachenko et al., 2021). The referenced studies typically report contact patterns for individuals over a very short (e.g., 1-day) period which is insufficient for assessing persistence of the measured variation. One of the studies (Hens et al., 2009) made an extra step and measured contact patterns for each individual on two different days (one weekday and one weekend day). In Fig. 12, we show fits for contact patterns by these two days individually, and for the average. The CV for the contact heterogeneity that persists over the two days is approximately 1:1 (in contrast with the larger 1:4 or 1:6 for each day alone).In addition to the magnitude of individual variation in connectivity, the time scale of that variation is another important determinant for the effect of selection in accelerating the acquisition of population immunity (Tkachenko et al., 2021).

        <p>For a heterogeneous model of an epidemic unfolding over a timescale of years, local dynamics are driven by assumptions about heterogeneity in short-term (e.g., week-long) averages in contact patterns, while global dynamics depend on assumptions about persistence of heterogeneity in those short-term averages over the timescale of the simulation.

        <p>One way to estimate persistent contact heterogeneity from below is to bin contact data by age groups, assuming for example that heterogeneity in contact patterns which persists in contact data after binning in 5-year age groups represents populationlevel heterogeneity in contact patterns that is persistent on multiyear time scales. Of course, this approach only captures heterogeneity mediated by age; i.e., it would only capture the full extent of heterogeneity in contact patterns if there was no within-agegroup persistent variation in contact patterns. As such we should expect age-binned contact data to underestimate the level of persistent heterogeneity in contact patterns (Britton et al., 2020), perhaps quite substantially.

When CV is artificially reduced by averaging processes such as these, models based on the resulting agestructured matrices are likely to overestimate the size of epidemics.Heterogeneous binning the data from the studies in Table 5 in 1-and 10-year age groups, respectively.

        <p>To better assess the dynamics governed by the heterogeneous model see Fig. 16(a), (b). We separate the scenarios of 30% and 70% vaccine efficacy against infection in two panels. We also allow R c to reach a value different from baseline after restrictions are lifted on the 19 July 2021. In each vaccine efficacy scenario we calculate the value that R c would have to reach for the number of COVID-19 deaths generated by the model between 1 February 2021 and 1 November 2021 to match the data (26,129 deaths over the stipulated 9 months). We obtained R c ¼ 1:23 Á R 0 in the 30% scenario and R c ¼ 1:41 Á R 0 in the 70% scenario. Subtracting the number of deaths under vaccination from the corresponding simulations without vaccination would lead us to conclude that the vaccine would have prevented around 52; 000 and 88; 000 deaths in the 30% and 70% vaccine efficacy scenarios, respectively. This calculation is not possible with the homogeneous model because no vaccination programme in that model can fill the gap between projections in Fig. 15 (c) and the reported deaths (see Fig. 16(c),(d)). Scenarios equivalent to those provided for the heterogeneous model result in epidemic waves one order of magnitude larger when heterogeneity is omitted. Heterogeneous models, which performed better than homogeneous in statistical inferences in this paper (whether based on fittings until July 2020 or February 2021, with or without reinfection, assuming different infection fatality ratios, informed by government stringency indices and mobility data or not), also generate projections in closer agreement with data beyond the fitted period.To better assess the dynamics governed by the heterogeneous model see Fig. 16(a), (b).

        <p>In the timeframe of this study, SARS-CoV-2 has undergone substantial evolution, with dominant genetic types being replaced by more transmissible variants. Specifically, the larger wave which peaked in January 2021 was caused by the alpha variant (B.1.1.7), estimated as up to 30% more transmissible than early viruses, while the flatter wave in the summer 2021 was mostly due to delta (B.1.617.2), estimated about 40% more transmissible than alpha (Public Health England, 2021;Richard et al., 2021;Wang et al., 2021) and hence 80% more than early types. The crude analysis in Fig. 16 suggests that R c might have been 23 À 41% higher during the delta wave than in the early months of the pandemic (baseline R 0 ). This is consistent with people retaining cautious behaviours which cancel some of the increases in transmissibility, e.g., a virus that is 80% more transmissible than the original (wild type) opposed by 22% reduced transmission due to behavioural change has R c ¼ 1:4 Á R 0 . In December 2021, delta was replaced by the omicron variant (B.1.1.529) (Elliott et al., 2022), assessed as even more transmissible but less pathogenic, a phenomenon that would be interesting to analyse with the models presented here but is beyond scope of the present study.In the timeframe of this study, SARS-CoV-2 has undergone substantial evolution, with dominant genetic types being replaced by more transmissible variants.

        <p>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our heterogeneity models have systematically projected lower infection rates in the UK (more specifically, England and Scotland) than others conforming to more common approaches (Flaxman et al., 2020;Knock et al., 2021;Sonabend et al., 2021;Davies et al., 2020;Davies et al., 2021;Hilton and Keeling, 2020;Keeling et al., 2021a;Keeling et al., 2021b;Moore et al., 2021). This was also noticed in similar analyses featuring Spain and Portugal (Aguas et al., 2020). When we disable individual variation in susceptibility and exposure to infection we obtain results similar to those presented elsewhere, suggesting that to be the distinguishing feature that keeps our models from overpredicting infection rates. When mitigations are applied the discrepancy between homogeneous and heterogeneous trajectories increases as the pandemic progresses, eventually causing the rejection of models that lack sufficient heterogeneity. By then, however, such models would have over-attributed impact to interventions, and may have induced governments to systematically make suboptimal decisions by over-weighting benefits in relation to the costs and collateral damages of control measures. More work is need to establish to what extent these might have happened in the COVID-19 pandemic.Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our heterogeneity models have systematically projected lower infection rates in the UK (more specifically, England and Scotland) than others conforming to more common approaches (Flaxman et al., 2020;Knock et al., 2021;Sonabend et al., 2021;Davies et al., 2020;Davies et al., 2021;Hilton and Keeling, 2020;Keeling et al., 2021a;Keeling et al., 2021b;Moore et al., 2021).

        <p>We have presented an original approach to modelling pandemics that includes inference of individual variation from its response to selection and enables reliable projections based on series of daily counts of disease outcomes (deaths in this case, but it could have been hospitalisations, reported infections, or a combination of multiple data streams) complemented by minimal information about interventions (Sections 5.1 and 5.2). Future developments might integrate more detailed data about interventions, such as NPIs and vaccines, the emergence and spread of new variants, individual variation in vulnerability to infection due to age, comorbidities or other factors, seasonal dynamics, susceptibility replenishment through waning immunity or birth and deaths, and interactions among these and other processes. Based on explorations initiated here (Sections 5.3 and 5.6) we expect our results to be robust to such extensions given abounding agreements with empirical evidence from independent sources (Section 5.4 and 5.5). Specifying more detail into the models does not necessarily enable more accurate predictions, but there are often other reasons, such as informing the design of targeted interventions, for such developments (Mishra et al., 2020). Although those extensions are beyond the scope of the current paper they are sometimes essential in specific circumstances.We have presented an original approach to modelling pandemics that includes inference of individual variation from its response to selection and enables reliable projections based on series of daily counts of disease outcomes (deaths in this case, but it could have been hospitalisations, reported infections, or a combination of multiple data streams) complemented by minimal information about interventions (Sections 5.1 and 5.2).

        <p>Another aspect where this work may fall short of expectations, and we hope to stimulate further research, is in the treatment of uncertainty. Our inferences result in noticeably narrow credible intervals which may inadvertently suggest overconfidence. Factors that may have contributed to this include the lack of account for uncertainty around some input parameters (such as incubation period, recovery rate and infection fatality ratio) which we assume at fixed values taken from the literature, the absence of stochasticity along individual trajectories (although we consider between individual variation) and the choice of a particular Monte Carlo algorithm implemented in 
            <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> (Stapor et al., 2018) while alternatives are always worth exploring given the rapid development of MCMC methods (although we have replicated a sample of fittings with other algorithms in Stan and obtained similar results). Given the wide discrepancy between heterogeneous and homogeneous model outputs and the consistency across a spectrum of scenarios, however, methodological improvements along these lines are not expected to affect the conclusions of this study. They may nevertheless alter the confidence on particular metrics being estimated.
        </p>
        <p>The conclusions of this work apply much beyond COVID-19. Individual variation in the propensity to acquire infections has many factors. Individuals differ in genetic background, the local environment they live in, and social activity, in ways that affect their susceptibility and exposure to many infectious diseases. Immunological studies identify local environmental conditions as key in shaping the human immune system (Carr et al., 2016), while social inequality is probably a main driver (Cevik and Baral, 2021). Studies designed to identify specific factors and characterise their modes of action are key, not necessarily to inform the development of more predictive models but primarily to help focusing interventions on those individuals who need more protection. Notwithstanding these studies being conducted, there will always remain some unobserved variation and, for the sake of model predictability, all variation responding to selection by natural infection must be accounted for to prevent biased outputs. For this reason we took the inverse approach of quantifying selectable variation by fitting fairly generic models to epidemic curves. We used the COVID-19 pandemic in England and Scotland to test the approach. We estimate coefficients of variation for variable connectivity (around 1:1) in agreement with empirical studies of contact patterns, resulting in natural herd immunity thresholds around 25 À 28%. For variable susceptibility we are not aware of available data specific to human COVID-19 to immediately compare our inferences (CV around 1:5, leading to herd immunity thresholds around 27 À 29%).The conclusions of this work apply much beyond COVID-19.

        <p>The natural herd immunity threshold studied here (H) describes a ceiling for epidemic growth formulated in terms of the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) and coefficients of individual variation in traits that are under selection by the natural force of infection (namely, susceptibility and exposure), filling a gap in mathematical epidemiology. While R 0 is indicative of the early growth of an epidemic, it says little about the final size and the height of the peak, which are strongly dependent on types of individual variation that decrease transmission over time (see also Brauer, 2018). H accounts for that variation enabling more accurate predictions of how large an epidemic might be, but it is a theoretical framework to the extent that R 0 is a theoretical framework. H changes if the parameters that determine its value change. Most notably, natural changes in R 0 through time, which can happen due to seasonal forces or viral evolution, will manifest in H. In particular, the percentage of the population immune required to prevent sustained epidemic growth may become higher than the initially estimated H if we enter a hightransmission season or if the virus evolves towards higher transmissibility.The natural herd immunity threshold studied here (H) describes a ceiling for epidemic growth formulated in terms of the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) and coefficients of individual variation in traits that are under selection by the natural force of infection (namely, susceptibility and exposure), filling a gap in mathematical epidemiology.

        <p>The UK experienced a first wave of the wild type virus in the spring 2020 (low-to-moderate transmission season but highly susceptible population) and initiated a second wave in the autumn of the same year (presumably driven by seasonality). The wave was subsiding (due to acquired immunity and contact restrictions) when a more transmissible variant (alpha) emerged, reaccelerating epidemic growth and becoming dominant by January 2021. By the end of January 2021, this wave was retracting again. Levels of infection and disease were especially low throughout April-May 2021 but this was somewhat altered by an even more transmissible variant (delta) that become dominant by the end of May 2021. The delta variant, which ravaged parts of the world (such as India, where it was first detected), maintained moderate levels of infection and disease in the UK throughout the summer and autumn 2021 (immunity due to previous infection and vaccination having a key role in this outcome). By the time this study was completed (November 2021), a new variant was being detected (omicron, associated with higher transmissibility, lower incubation period and lower pathogenicity) but is beyond the scope of this paper.The UK experienced a first wave of the wild type virus in the spring 2020 (low-to-moderate transmission season but highly susceptible population) and initiated a second wave in the autumn of the same year (presumably driven by seasonality).

        <p>Although our models have not been developed to estimate variant-specific parameters (except for the wild type), they can give an indication of which parameter ranges are compatible with the transmission dynamics in each nation at the time a particular variant was dominant. In England, assuming an infection fatality ratio of 0:9%, our heterogeneous models estimate H for wild type in the range 25 À 27% (R 0 around 2:7). Assuming alpha 30% more transmissible, and delta 40% more transmissible than alpha (Public Health England, 2021), we obtain H in the range 30 À 33% (R 0 around 3:6) for alpha, and 36 À 40% (R 0 around 5:0) for delta. The estimated cumulative infected percentage is close to 25% by November 2021, suggesting that the nation was then entering the range estimated for the natural herd immunity threshold for wild type SARS-CoV-2 (assuming acquired immunity to be effective across variants), but remained 5% and 11% below threshold for alpha and delta variants, respectively. Adding that almost 70% of the population had been fully vaccinated by then, it might have been reasonable to expect herd immunity to be achieved soon for those variants as well. This was happening just prior to the rapid rise of the omicron variant by December 2021.Although our models have not been developed to estimate variant-specific parameters (except for the wild type), they can give an indication of which parameter ranges are compatible with the transmission dynamics in each nation at the time a particular variant was dominant.

        <p>In Scotland, by the same assumptions, we estimate H in the range 26 À 29% (R 0 around 2:9) for the wild type, 31 À 34% (R 0 around 3:8) for alpha, and 37 À 41% (R 0 around 5:3) for delta, where the infection fatality ratio of 0:9% would suggest a cumulative infected percentage close to 20% by November 2021. In this case, the nation remained 6% below the natural herd immunity threshold for the wild type, 11% for alpha, and 17% for the delta variant. As in England, though, it is plausible the addition of vaccination coverage would have brought the nation to the herd immunity threshold for the three SARS-CoV-2 types, but more research is needed to determine this with satisfactory confidence.In Scotland, by the same assumptions, we estimate H in the range 26 À 29% (R 0 around 2:9) for the wild type, 31 À 34% (R 0 around 3:8) for alpha, and 37 À 41% (R 0 around 5:3) for delta, where the infection fatality ratio of 0:9% would suggest a cumulative infected percentage close to 20% by November 2021.

        <p>These figures are for the scenario where the IFR is 0:9% and should be adapted if different assumptions are made about this metric, but explorations reported in Supplementary Material suggest that general tendencies will not be affected. Also worth noting that although neither the wild type nor the alpha variant remained in circulation by November 2021, it is of both theoretical and practical interest to detail the mechanisms that resulted in their elimination. In particular, our analyses suggest that variant-specific naturally acquired immunity had a much larger role than what might have been expected according to models that take less account of individual variation in susceptibility and exposure to infection (recall that models that assume homogeneity inflate herd immunity thresholds to 60% and higher). More generally, heterogeneity affects competition mechanisms and measures of relative fitness between variants (Gomes et al., 2019), and efficacy of vaccines over time (Gomes et al., 2016;Gomes, 2020), in ways that are yet to be considered for COVID-19 (Bushman et al., 2021;Althaus et al., 2021;Thomas et al., 2021).These figures are for the scenario where the IFR is 0:9% and should be adapted if different assumptions are made about this metric, but explorations reported in Supplementary Material suggest that general tendencies will not be affected.

        <p>Finally, the maintenance of herd immunity is a dynamic process (Gomes, 2021). Immune individuals lose their immunity or die while new susceptibles are born. Further infections and vaccinations replenish population immunity maintaining infection rates at an endemic equilibrium -the herd immunity threshold. This equilibrium is precarious in the sense that it is sensitive to viral evolution and demographic change, and may be temporarily eroded by seasonality (Bacaer et al., 2009) in a pattern exhibited by many common air-borne or vector-borne infectious diseases. and Aidan West conducted their final year BSc projects on Communicating Mathematics and Statistics, supervised by M.G.M.G., on topics related to this study while this paper was being written.
