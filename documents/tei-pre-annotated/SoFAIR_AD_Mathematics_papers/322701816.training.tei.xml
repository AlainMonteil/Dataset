        <p>Seasonality and climate-dependency of influenza are well established. Suggested mechanisms for the slowdown of influenza epidemics in summer months in temperate climates are related to higher temperature, higher humidity or higher solar radiation. 1 These three characteristics are all associated with geographic latitude, a measure that can be determined effortlessly and with precision. Another possible explanation for the slowdown of influenza epidemics during summer months is school closures for summer breaks. [2][3][4] To slow the growth of the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many countries are mandating school closures 5 and use other public health interventions, such as restrictions of mass gatherings, social distancing or closure of non-essential businesses.Seasonality and climate-dependency of influenza are well established.

        <p>However, it is unclear whether these interventions, or seasonal changes mediated by climate 6 will impact the pandemic. We performed an analysis of the association of the current epidemic growth in geopolitical areas affected by COVID-19 to determine whether epidemic growth is associated with climate, school closures, or other public health interventions aimed at reducing contact rates in the population and thereby reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus driving the pandemic.

        <p>This was a prospective cohort study of geopolitical areas with documented COVID-19 outbreaks to determine the association of epidemic growth of COVID-19 during a pre-specified follow-up period (March 21 to March 27, 2020) with characteristics ascertained during an exposure period 14 days previously (March 7 to March 13, 2020). The time lag between exposure and follow-up was set to 14 days to reflect the assumed time between transmission of SARS-CoV-2 10 and reporting of confirmed COVID-19 cases (Figure 1). 11 Analyses were performed according to a pre-specified protocol. Results of a preliminary unpublished analysis, conducted according to protocol version 1.0, are summarized in protocol version 1.2 (available in Appendix).

        <p>We included all geopolitical areas (states in case of Australia and the United States, provinces in case of Canada, countries and overseas territories for the rest of the world) with at least 10 cases March 20, 2020 (reference) and documented local transmission according to the WHO's Situation Report 61. 12 China was excluded as its epidemic growth had decelerated and the outbreak appeared contained, suggesting it had progressed to the hyperendemicity phase of the epidemic curve. South Korea, Italy and Iran were excluded as their disease outbreak was fully established, being further ahead on the epidemic curve than the rest of the world, with the possibility to reach the hyperendemic state during the follow-up period.We included all geopolitical areas (states in case of Australia and the United States, provinces in case of Canada, countries and overseas territories for the rest of the world) with at least 10 cases March 20, 2020 (reference) and documented local transmission according to the WHO's Situation Report 61. 12 China was excluded as its epidemic growth had decelerated and the outbreak appeared contained, suggesting it had progressed to the hyperendemicity phase of the epidemic curve.

        <p>The exposure period was pre-specified to last from March 7 to March 13, 2020 (Figure 1). Geographic latitude was pre-specified as primary exposure variable, mean temperature, absolute humidity, school closures, restrictions of mass gatherings and measures of social distancing as secondary exposure variables. Latitude, mean temperature and mean relative humidity (to derive absolute humidity) were collected for the capital of each geopolitical area, data on school closures, restrictions of mass gatherings and measures of social distancing at the level of the geopolitical area. Absolute humidity describes the absolute water content in g/m 3 , relative humidity describes absolute humidity relative to the maximum possible humidity in percent given the current temperature. We gave precedence to absolute humidity over relative humidity, as it was more strongly associated with influenza than relative humidity, 1 and showed less variation than relative humidity, but included relative humidity as a post-hoc exposure variable. Mean temperature and humidity were calculated for the entire exposure period, deriving arithmetic means across all available measurement timepoints (median 8 per day, interquartile range [IQR] 8 to 45). 13 For school closures, restrictions of mass gatherings, and measures of social distancing, we determined whether they were implemented by a prespecified cutoff, mid workweek of the exposure period (Wednesday March 11, 2020).The exposure period was pre-specified to last from March 7 to March 13, 2020 (Figure 1).

        <p>The analysis of confirmed cases 11 is complicated by potentially dramatic differences in detection and reporting of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, 14 which prevent a meaningful analysis of absolute event rates across different countries. Conversely, an analysis of epidemic growth, 15 which can be expressed in relative terms -a rate ratio comparing the current cumulative count of reported cases with the cumulative count of cases reported one week earlier -is likely to account for some of the variation in detection and reporting. This approach analyses the slope of the cumulative frequency rather than absolute rates, using each geopolitical area as its own comparison (Appendix, Figure S1). The follow-up period was prespecified to last from March 21 to March 27, 2020 (Figure 1).

        <p>Temperature in °C and relative humidity were collected for the exposure period of March 7 to March 13, 2020 from a publicly accessible meteorological website, 13 with absolute humidity calculated from relative humidity and temperature for each measurement timepoint. 17 Data on school closures were obtained from UNESCO 18 and complemented with information on scheduled school holidays. Data on school holidays, restrictions of mass gatherings, and measures of social distancing were obtained by one out of 3 investigators (PJ, DG and a research assistant) from official school schedules, provisions and press releases of relevant administrative and governmental bodies, and newspaper articles, and checked by at least one other investigator (PJ or PB). Data on restrictions of mass gatherings and measures of social distancing were subsequently verified against timelines reported in the online encyclopaedia Wikipedia. 19 No documents were excluded based on language. Team members were able to read documents in English, German, Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Slovak and Spanish directly.

        <p>The number of flight passengers per inhabitant was calculated from published passenger statistics of major airports. [20][21][22] Data on the highest urban density in major metropolitan areas of a geopolitical area was obtained from Demographia World Urban Areas 23 and complemented with data from the United States census. 24 Data on remaining covariates were obtained from the World Bank. 25 Latitude, altitude, temperature and humidity were collected for the capital of each geopolitical area, remaining covariates at the level of the geopolitical area. For Ecuador, we collected data for the de facto capital, Guayaquil. 25 The Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index 16 was only available at country level; therefore values of the home country were assigned to states, provinces and overseas territories. To make interpretation of the index more intuitive, we inverted it so that larger values indicate higher vulnerability to infectious diseases.The number of flight passengers per inhabitant was calculated from published passenger statistics of major airports.

        <p>We used weighted random-effects regression 26 to determine the association between the log rate ratio of COVID-19 and exposure variables. Rate ratios were calculated as cumulative count of confirmed cases in a geopolitical area since the beginning of the epidemic as of March 27 divided by the cumulative count of confirmed cases since the beginning of the epidemic as of March 20 (Appendix, Figure S1). The observation time was identical across all areas. Since the populations in question were large, they could be considered equal at both time points and cancelled out in calculations of rate ratios. A rate ratio of 2 indicates that the number of cases in a geopolitical area doubled within one week. As the exposure period of March 7 to March 13 was near vernal equinox, no transformation was necessary to reflect the association of the log rate ratio of COVID-19 with the square of the latitude. Associations were expressed as ratios of rate ratios (RRR) per 400 degrees 2 increase in latitude, 5°C increase in temperature, 10% increase in relative humidity, 5g/m 3 increase in absolute humidity, and RRR comparing geopolitical areas with versus areas without implementation of school closures, restrictions of mass gatherings or measures of social distancing. The units of analysis were geopolitical areas; log rate ratios of COVID-19 (dependent variable) and exposure variables (independent variables) were defined at the level of geopolitical areas. An RRR below 1 indicates that an increase in one of the continuous exposure variables or the presence of a public health intervention is associated with a decrease in epidemic growth, with an RRR of 0.60 corresponding to a 40% relative reduction in epidemic growth.We used weighted random-effects regression 26 to determine the association between the log rate ratio of COVID-19 and exposure variables.

        <p>We determined associations of epidemic growth with exposure variables in univariate analyses, and in different multivariable models and analysis sets to determine robustness of associations as pre-specified in the protocol (see Appendix). Then, we developed two parsimonious multivariable models. For Model 1, we first prioritized covariates on theoretical grounds and then used unsupervised cluster analysis for variable selection (Appendix, Table S2); 27 for Model 2 we used stepwise backward selection of covariates based on the adjusted R 2 statistic. We prespecified that Model 1 would take precedence over Model 2, as it would not be at risk of overfitting. Cluster analysis indicated clustering of the three public health interventions (Appendix, Figure S2). We therefore derived a post-hoc composite of exposure to any of the CMAJ 2020 May 8;192 (in press) three interventions. In addition, we pre-specified to perform tests for trend according to the number of public health interventions implemented (0, 1, or 2 or more) under the assumption that the RRRs for the association of epidemic growth with school closures, restrictions of mass gatherings or measures of social distancing would have the same direction and a similar magnitude. We forced major geographical regions (Asia, Oceania, Europe, Africa, Americas) into both models to account for the geographic progression of the pandemic. Analyses were performed in

        <p>144 geopolitical areas with 375,609 cases were included in our analyses (Appendix, Figure S3 and Table S3). The median COVID-19 case rate per 1-million inhabitants for the 144 geopolitical areas was 87.6 (IQR 31.9 to 193.7), the median rate ratio representing epidemic growth was 3.56 (IQR 2.41 to 4.66, Table 1). Most geopolitical areas were in the northern hemisphere, near sea-level, with temperate climates. The median temperature was 12.8 °C (IQR 7.3 to 21.2), the median relative humidity was 69.0% (IQR 60.3 to 76.6), and absolute humidity was 7.1 g/m3 (IQR 5.1 to 10.8). Temperature was strongly associated with the square of the latitude, and to a lesser extent, so was absolute humidity; relative humidity was not associated (Appendix, Figures S4 to S6). Thirty-eight geopolitical areas had at least one public health intervention implemented by March 11, 2020, with 24 areas having 1 implemented (16.7%), and 14 areas having more than one intervention (9.7%); the remainder had no public health interventions in effect (73.6%). The implementation of public health interventions was correlated (Appendix, Figure S2). The median percentage of the population 65 years old or older was 14.0%, the median life expectancy at birth was 79 years, on average 9.2% of gross domestic products was spent on health (IQR 6.3% to 13.5%), and the median distance to the closest established epidemic was 4,300 km (IQR 1,300 to 8,000; Table 1).144 geopolitical areas with 375,609 cases were included in our analyses (Appendix, Figure S3 and Table S3).

The associations of epidemic growth with both dimensions of humidity, despite their low mutual correlation, 28 were suggestive of a minor role of humidity in the epidemiology of COVID-19, but this remains hypothetical. On the other hand, it is of considerable importance that we found strong negative associations with three public health interventions commonly used to contain the COVID-19 pandemic: restrictions of mass gatherings, school closures and measures of social distancing. Even though we were unable to reliably quantify the independent contribution of the three interventions, our results are of immediate relevance as many countries currently consider the removal of some of the implemented public health interventions.We found associations with relative and absolute humidity, but these were attenuated in multivariable models.

        <p>Our results are concordant with three studies from China, [29][30][31] which reported no evidence for an association of epidemic growth with temperature and relative humidity, 29 but strong decreases in epidemic growth associated with public health measures. 30,31 A recent rapid systematic review concluded that the evidence to support national closure of schools to combat COVID-19 is very weak and that data from influenza outbreaks suggest that school closures could have relatively small effects on SARS-CoV-2 due to its high transmissibility and apparent low clinical effect on school children. 32 Our results suggest that school closures are likely to have a larger effect than suggested in this review, but the clustering of school closures with other public health interventions means that we were unable to reliably estimate the independent effect of this intervention on the COVID-19 pandemic. The effect of restrictions of mass gathering, measures of social distancing and school closures on viral transmission is understudied. [32][33][34] However, mathematical models and limited observational evidence suggest that they can interrupt disease transmission. Our study provides important new evidence, using global data from the COVID-19 pandemic, that these interventions reduced epidemic growth to a relevant extent.Our results are concordant with three studies from China, [29][30][31] which reported no evidence for an association of epidemic growth with temperature and relative humidity, 29 but strong decreases in epidemic growth associated with public health measures. 30,31 A recent rapid systematic review concluded that the evidence to support national closure of schools to combat COVID-19 is very weak and that data from influenza outbreaks suggest that school closures could have relatively small effects on SARS-CoV-2 due to its high transmissibility and apparent low clinical effect on school children. 32 Our results suggest that school closures are likely to have a larger effect than suggested in this review, but the clustering of school closures with other public health interventions means that we were unable to reliably estimate the independent effect of this intervention on the COVID-19 pandemic.

        <p>Our study has a number of limitations. First, due to considerable differences in testing practices between different geopolitical areas, the actual rates of COVID-19 could not be reliably estimated. We assumed, however, that rate ratios as measures of epidemic growth could be reliably estimated as testing practices would affect both counts used to calculate the rate ratio in the same way during the ascertained one-week follow-up period. We were unable to identify reliable information on the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests per million inhabitants, and on different testing strategies, and could therefore not directly verify this assumption. GDP per capita, health expenditure as percent of GDP and Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index 16 may be associated to some extent with a healthcare system's capacity to test and could serve as imperfect surrogates. They were indeed both associated with epidemic growth in the univariate analysis, but the main multivariable model did not suggest an association with health expenditure. In addition, the random effects used in the regression model implicitly accounted for residual variation in characteristics of geopolitical areas that remained unexplained, including variation in testing strategies. Second, we assumed that SARS-CoV-2 testing strategies did not vary during the follow-up period. Testing capacity was limited globally in March 2020 and was unlikely to change rapidly during the follow-up period in most geopolitical areas. In addition, we believe that the time window of 1 week was short enough so that reported confirmed cases in each geopolitical area were likely to represent a constant percentage of the Fifth, we only analysed when restrictions of mass gathering were instituted, irrespective of the size of mass gatherings that were restricted. Sixth, we were unable to quantify compliance of the population with social distancing and restrictions of mass gatherings. Conversely, even though there may be local variations in strategies to implement school closures, we consider a high adherence to this intervention likely. Seventh, data on latitude, temperature and humidity were collected for the capital of each geopolitical area. The limited granularity of the available data may have resulted in non-differential misclassification of exposure, which in turn may have biased estimates of associations towards the null (see Tables S15 to S23 and Figure S15 for details on risks of bias for individual exposure variables).Our study has a number of limitations.

        <p>Epidemic growth of COVID-19 was not associated with geographic latitude, nor with temperature during the exposure period, which suggests season will not influence the spread of COVID-19. The association between relative and absolute humidity and epidemic growth was suggestive but not consistent. Even if humidity proves important in the epidemiology of COVID-19 in the future, seasonal effects will likely be attenuated by the high levels of susceptibility associated with pandemic diseases. 35 In our study, only public health interventions were consistently associated with reduced epidemic growth, and the greater the number of cooccurring public health interventions, the larger the reduction in growth. Taken together, these findings suggest that seasonality is likely to play only a minor role in the epidemiology of COVID-19. Conversely, public health interventions (school closures, restricting mass gatherings, social distancing) appear to have a major impact. This impact needs to be weighed carefully against potential economic and psychosocial harms when deciding when and how to lift restrictions.
