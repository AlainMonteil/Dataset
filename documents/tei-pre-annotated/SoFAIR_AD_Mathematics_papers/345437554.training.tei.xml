        <p>We present cosmological constraints from a cosmic shear analysis of the fourth data release of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000), doubling the survey area with nine-band optical and near-infrared photometry with respect to previous KiDS analyses. Adopting a spatially flat ΛCDM model, we find S 8 = σ 8 (Ω m /0.3) 0.5 = 0.759 +0.024 -0.021 for our fiducial analysis, which is in 3σ tension with the prediction of the Planck Legacy analysis of the cosmic microwave background. We compare our fiducial COSEBIs (Complete Orthogonal Sets of E/B-Integrals) analysis with complementary analyses of the two-point shear correlation function and band power spectra, finding results to be in excellent agreement. We investigate the sensitivity of all three statistics to a number of measurement, astrophysical, and modelling systematics, finding our S 8 constraints to be robust and dominated by statistical errors. Our cosmological analysis of different divisions of the data pass the Bayesian internal consistency tests, with the exception of the second tomographic bin. As this bin encompasses low redshift galaxies, carrying insignificant levels of cosmological information, we find that our results are unchanged by the inclusion or exclusion of this sample.We present cosmological constraints from a cosmic shear analysis of the fourth data release of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000), doubling the survey area with nine-band optical and near-infrared photometry with respect to previous KiDS analyses.

        <p>In this new era of precision cosmology reliable probes of the key parameters of the standard model, ΛCDM, are indispensable. The weak gravitational lensing effect that coherently distorts the shapes of galaxy images, commonly referred to as cosmic shear, was hailed as such a tool (Albrecht et al. 2006;Peacock et al. 2006), directly mapping the spatial distribution of all gravitating matter along the line of sight and therefore sensitive to the amplitude and shape of the matter power spectrum (see Kilbinger 2015, for a review). This makes cosmic shear highly complementary to galaxy clustering, which as a spatially localised probe can trace line-of-sight modes of the matter distribution and localised features like baryon acoustic oscillations, but which suffers from the poorly known connection between the galaxy and matter distribution, known as galaxy bias.In this new era of precision cosmology reliable probes of the key parameters of the standard model, ΛCDM, are indispensable.

        <p>First detected two decades ago (Bacon et al. 2000;Kaiser et al. 2000;Van Waerbeke et al. 2000;Wittman et al. 2000), cosmic shear has since matured into a primary probe in the golden era of galaxy surveys, featuring prominently alongside galaxy clustering in forthcoming experiments like the ESA Euclid mission1 (Laureijs et al. 2011), the Vera C. Rubin Observatory LSST2 (LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration 2012), and NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope3 (Spergel et al. 2015). To meet the stringent accuracy requirements of these new surveys, all aspects of a cosmic shear analysis have to undergo critical revision and, in many cases, radical improvements. Vital lessons are being learnt by three concurrent surveys, whose analyses are on-going: the ESO Kilo-Degree Survey4 (KiDS; Kuijken et al. 2015;Hildebrandt et al. 2020a), the Dark Energy Survey 5 (DES; Drlica-Wagner et al. 2018;Zuntz et al. 2018), and the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program6 (HSC; Aihara et al. 2018;Hikage et al. 2019). The current surveys already have the statistical power to independently test our cosmological standard model, in particular the amplitude of matter density fluctuations, by convention measured via the parameter S 8 = σ 8 (Ω m /0.3) 0.5 , where Ω m is the matter density parameter and σ 8 is the linear-theory standard deviation of matter density fluctuations in spheres of radius 8 h -1 Mpc.First detected two decades ago (Bacon et al. 2000;Kaiser et al. 2000;Van Waerbeke et al. 2000;Wittman et al. 2000), cosmic shear has since matured into a primary probe in the golden era of galaxy surveys, featuring prominently alongside galaxy clustering in forthcoming experiments like the ESA Euclid mission1 (Laureijs et al. 2011), the Vera C.

        <p>In this work we present the cosmic shear analysis of the fourth KiDS Data Release (Kuijken et al. 2019), hereafter referred to as KiDS-1000. This more than doubles the survey area with respect to the previous KiDS cosmological analyses (Hildebrandt et al. 2017(Hildebrandt et al. , 2020a)). While neither as deep as HSC, once it is completed, nor as wide as the final DES area, KiDS has unique properties that make it competitive in terms of controlling the two major measurement challenges for cosmic shear analysesthe accurate measurement of gravitational shear, i.e. the image distortions imposed by the lensing effect, and the accurate determination of the redshift distribution of the galaxies used in the cosmic shear analysis. As all current cosmic shear analyses can already be considered systematics-limited to some degree (see Mandelbaum 2018 for a recent review of the major challenges), such benefits are likely to directly impact on the final cosmological constraints and could potentially outweigh a larger raw statistical power.In this work we present the cosmic shear analysis of the fourth KiDS Data Release (Kuijken et al. 2019), hereafter referred to as KiDS-1000.

        <p>A robust and accurate analysis of cosmic shear data is of paramount importance for testing the concordance of the current standard cosmological model, flat ΛCDM. Currently the tightest constraints on the parameters of this model come from studies of full-sky CMB temperature and polarisation maps. Although these data are primarily sensitive to the physics of the early Universe, given a model they can make predictions for statistical properties of the structures formed in the late Universe as well as the current expansion rate. Since the first cosmological analysis of the Planck data (Planck Collaboration et al. 2014), there have been indications of tension between the CMB and cosmic shear results (Heymans et al. 2013) as well as with the Hubble parameter estimated through the distance ladder (Riess et al. 2011).A robust and accurate analysis of cosmic shear data is of paramount importance for testing the concordance of the current standard cosmological model, flat ΛCDM.

        <p>Recently, there has been a high level of attention towards the ever-growing tension between the estimates of the Hubble parameter from early and late Universe probes (see Verde et al. 2019, for a recent summary). Although not currently as significant, the level of tension in S 8 between the probes of the largescale structures and the Planck results has also been increasing. In particular, the cosmic shear analysis of the first-year data release of DES (DES-Y1, Troxel et al. 2018b), HSC (Hikage et al. 2019) and the KiDS results of Hildebrandt et al. (2020a, KV450) all found values of S 8 that are lower than the Planck predictions (Planck Collaboration et al. 2020a) by around 2σ. Interestingly, these results are largely independent, as the images are taken over mostly different patches of the sky and the teams and pipelines analysing them were largely separate 7 . Therefore, we can assume that the combined analysis of these data sets would result in deviations larger than 2σ. For instance, Joudaki et al. (2020) analysed the combination of DES-Y1 and KV450 data using the KV450 setup and redshift calibrations to find a tension of 2.5σ, and the re-analysis of Asgari et al. (2020) increased the constraining power of DES by including smaller angular scales to find a DES-Y1 and KV450 joint result that is in 3.2σ tension with Planck.Recently, there has been a high level of attention towards the ever-growing tension between the estimates of the Hubble parameter from early and late Universe probes (see Verde et al. 2019, for a recent summary).

        <p>Aside from the importance of the quality of the data, we need to improve the model for a robust analysis. Modelling challenges in cosmic shear prevail especially on small scales where the signal-to-noise ratio is highest and where non-linear structure growth (e.g. Euclid Collaboration et al. 2019), baryon feedback on the matter distribution (e.g. Semboloni et al. 2011), and complex matter-galaxy interactions affecting the intrinsic alignment of galaxies (e.g. Fortuna et al. 2020) all combine to lead to an uncertainty that is difficult to calibrate and quantify.Aside from the importance of the quality of the data, we need to improve the model for a robust analysis.

        <p>It is standard to employ two-point statistics of the gravitational shear estimates as summary statistics, but which choice strikes a balance between the optimal extraction of information and the suppression of observational or modelling systematics? While the KiDS-1000 approach to modelling and inference methodology is discussed in detail in Joachimi et al. (2020), here we focus on the choice of summary statistics and their sensitivity to different systematic and modelling effects. Two-point statistics of the shear field can be measured in configuration, Fourier or other spaces. In this analysis we consider Complete Orthogonal Sets of E/B-Integrals (COSEBIs; Schneider et al. 2010), band power estimates derived from the correlation functions (Schneider et al. 2002a;Becker &amp; Rozo 2016;van Uitert et al. 2018) and the shear two-point correlation functions (2PCFs). As we discuss in Sect. 2, there are considerable advantages to the former two statistics, since they allow us to avoid scales that are affected by modelling uncertainties, although the latter method has been used in the clear majority of recent cosmic shear analyses (see for example Heymans et al. 2013;Jee et al. 2016;Hildebrandt et al. 2017;Joudaki et al. 2017b;Troxel et al. 2018a,b;Hildebrandt et al. 2020a;Wright et al. 2020b;Hamana et al. 2020). With these statistics we connect previous work with this new analysis.It is standard to employ two-point statistics of the gravitational shear estimates as summary statistics, but which choice strikes a balance between the optimal extraction of information and the suppression of observational or modelling systematics?

        <p>Consistent parameter constraints from a diverse set of summary statistics can add valuable corroboration to cosmological inference. However, care must be taken to accurately quantify the correlation between the different two-point statistics, which is strong, as they are calculated from the same catalogue, but not perfect, as scales are incorporated and weighted differently. In this work we will apply all summary statistics to the same suite of realistic mock KiDS-1000 data, enabling us to map the expected differences in cosmological constraints. In addition we triplicate all of our cosmological analyses, including results for 2PCFs, COSEBIs and band powers for all cases.Consistent parameter constraints from a diverse set of summary statistics can add valuable corroboration to cosmological inference.

        <p>From a theoretical point of view, spherical harmonic measures estimated from a pixelated sky may seem to be the most natural choice. Such direct power spectrum statistics have seen widespread application in other cosmological probes, most prominently in temperature and polarisation measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB: e.g. Planck Collaboration et al. 2020b). Analogous statistics, like pixel-based maximum-likelihood quadratic estimators (Brown et al. 2003;Heymans et al. 2005;Lin et al. 2012;Köhlinger et al. 2016Köhlinger et al. , 2017) ) or pseudo-C techniques (Hikage et al. 2011;Becker et al. 2016;Asgari et al. 2018;Hikage et al. 2019;Alonso et al. 2019), have also been developed for cosmic shear. These measurements are, however, affected directly by masking and finite field effects. Moreover, the significant noise component due to the random intrinsic orientations of galaxy shapes is spread out over all multipoles in harmonic space. For such analyses, these effects have to be either modelled or corrected for. 2PCFs, on the other hand, do not suffer from these limitations, as masking and noise effects do not bias their expectation value, although they should be included in their covariance estimation (see section 5 of J20 for a discussion on the importance of each effect). An additional motivation for employing 2PCFs is that measurement systematics are better traced in configuration space.From a theoretical point of view, spherical harmonic measures estimated from a pixelated sky may seem to be the most natural choice.

        <p>This makes the 2PCFs the current method of choice to be applied to a catalogue of shear estimates. However, considerable disadvantages are revealed in the further stages of the cosmological inference. Due to the very broad kernels linking the 2PCFs to the underlying power spectrum, the analyst has little control over the physical scales entering the likelihood analysis, with undesirable consequences (see Fig. 1). For instance, sensitivity to low multipoles where only few independent modes contribute leads to significant deviations from a Gaussian likelihood for 2PCFs measured on large-separations (Schneider &amp; Hartlap 2009;Sellentin et al. 2018), while a fairly wide range of small-scale 2PCF measurements are affected by non-linear modelling uncertainties such as baryon feedback (Asgari et al. 2020). In addition, the 2PCFs mix E-modes, which are expected to carry the cosmological signal, and B-modes, which are influenced by cosmological signals only at a very low level and hence provide a valuable null test for a range of systematics. There are also modes that cannot be uniquely identified as either E or B-modes. The 2PCFs are also impacted by these ambiguous modes.This makes the 2PCFs the current method of choice to be applied to a catalogue of shear estimates.

        <p>To remedy these shortcomings, we consider two promising alternatives: COSEBIs and band powers. COSEBIs offer a clean separation of E and B-modes over a finite range of available angular scales, with nearly lossless data compression and discrete abscissae as a bonus. Band powers allow for approximate E-/B-mode separation and closely follow the underlying angular power spectra, facilitating intuitive interpretation of the signals. These statistics are, in addition, insensitive to the ambiguous E and B-modes. We will demonstrate that both derived statistics avoid the modelling deficiencies of 2PCFs because of their more compact kernels. We note that direct power spectrum estimators will be applied to KiDS data in forthcoming work (Loureiro et al., in prep.).To remedy these shortcomings, we consider two promising alternatives: COSEBIs and band powers.

        <p>In Table 1 we show the data properties that are relevant for covariance estimation, as well as the values of the calibration parameters. The ∆z parameters are defined as the difference between the mean of the estimated SOM distribution, z est , and the true redshift distribution of galaxies in the MICE2 mocks, z true , for a given redshift bin. We note that the effective area of the survey is relevant for the calculation of all the terms in the covariance matrix, except for the shape-noise only term. J20 found that for the cosmic variance (sample variance) term a larger effective area based on a Healpix map with N side = 4096 (Górski et al. 2005), provides a better match between the mock and theoretical covariances (see section 5.2 and appendix E of J20). Here we use this area for calculating the covariances matrices, although in Appendix C we show that this choice has an insignificant effect on our analysis.In Table 1 we show the data properties that are relevant for covariance estimation, as well as the values of the calibration parameters.

        <p>For our cosmological analysis we assume a spatially flat ΛCDM model and infer the values of cosmological parameters through sampling of the likelihood with the MultiNest sampler (Feroz et al. 2013).

            <rs type="software">SciPy</rs>
            <rs type="version">13</rs> , with the starting points taken from the MultiNest chains. We use this separate minimiser since the MultiNest sampler is not optimised to find the best fitting point in the likelihood surface.

We set the sum of the neutrino masses to a fixed value of 0.06 eV (Hildebrandt et al. 2020a showed that neutrinos have a negligible effect on cosmic shear analysis). In contrast to previous analyses of cosmic shear data, we sample over S 8 = σ 8 (Ω m /0.3) 0.5 . Our primary results include constraints on S 8 and therefore we aim for an uninformative prior on this parameter. This choice is further justified in J20, by demonstrating that a flat prior over the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum A s or its logarithm ln(10 10 A s ) as employed in the previous analysis of KiDS and DES data produces informative priors for S 8 . Our constraints on the other cosmological parameters are mostly dominated by the prior, and we therefore set their prior range based on either the limitations in the theoretical modelling or previous observations (see section 6.1 of J20 for more details).

The number of varied parameters (12 for COSEBIs and band powers, 13 for 2PCFs, see Table 2) is substantially larger than N Θ , which can have a significant effect on the goodness-of-fit estimates of the model, especially when the data vector is small. Despite the differences between these two-point statistics, we expect them to have a similar sensitivity to cosmological parameters and therefore employ the same N Θ for all of them.

        <p>Cosmic shear results are usually shown in terms of σ 8 and Ω m , or S 8 and Ω m . In Fig. 6 we show our results for these parameters and compare them to the Planck results. In the left panel we see that the constraints from these three statistics move along the degeneracy direction of σ 8 and Ω m ; however, they show good agreement in the value of S 8 as we saw in Table 3. This movement is expected and will depend on the noise realisation in conjunction with the weighting of the data. In Fig. 1 we saw that our three sets of statistics show varying sensitivities to different angular scales. Hence, we can obtain different parameter constraints given the same noise realisation. We discuss this further and show mock data results in Appendix B.1. The left panel of Fig. 6 shows that the extent of the ξ ± contours appears smaller than that of the other statistics. This is because the posterior is truncated at low Ω m by the prior. We also see in Table 3 that the constraints from ξ ± for S 8 are tighter than those for both COSE-BIs and band powers, whereas we would have expected similar constraining power for these three statistics. The right-hand panel of Fig. 6 illustrates that the ξ ± contours are horizontal in Ω m and S 8 , while the marginal posterior for COSEBIs and especially for band powers is tilted, showing that S 8 is not perpendicular to the degeneracy between σ 8 and Ω m for the latter two statistics.Cosmic shear results are usually shown in terms of σ 8 and Ω m , or S 8 and Ω m .

This movement is expected and will depend on the noise realisation in conjunction with the weighting of the data. In Fig. 1 we saw that our three sets of statistics show varying sensitivities to different angular scales. Hence, we can obtain different parameter constraints given the same noise realisation. We discuss this further and show mock data results in Appendix B.1. The left panel of Fig. 6 shows that the extent of the ξ ± contours appears smaller than that of the other statistics. This is because the posterior is truncated at low Ω m by the prior. We also see in Table 3 that the constraints from ξ ± for S 8 are tighter than those for both COSE-BIs and band powers, whereas we would have expected similar constraining power for these three statistics. The right-hand panel of Fig. 6 illustrates that the ξ ± contours are horizontal in Ω m and S 8 , while the marginal posterior for COSEBIs and especially for band powers is tilted, showing that S 8 is not perpendicular to the degeneracy between σ 8 and Ω m for the latter two statistics.</p>
        <p>The current established definition for S 8 is σ 8 (Ω m /0.3) α , with α = 0.5. Previously (see for example Kilbinger et al. 2013), the value of α was fitted to the contours, to find the tightest constraints from the data. As Fig. 6 clearly shows, α = 0.5 does not provide an optimal description for the σ 8 -Ω m degeneracy of either COSEBIs or band powers. In general, the value of α depends on the weighting of the angular scales entering the analysis, which probe different physical scales for different redshifts. In order to avoid confusion, we keep the established definition of S 8 with α = 0.5, but also include results forThe current established definition for S 8 is σ 8 (Ω m /0.3) α , with α = 0.5.

        <p>In Table 4 we present best-fitting values for α and constraints for its corresponding Σ 8 . As expected, α ≈ 0.5 for the 2PCFs, i.e. S 8 remains a good summary parameter for this composition of the data vector. For COSEBIs and band powers we find α = 0.54 and α = 0.58, respectively, showing that they have a significantly different degeneracy to what is captured with S 8 17 . Here we see that the sizes of the Σ 8 credible intervals for the different statistics are much closer to each other compared to the S 8 constraints in Table 3. The constraints from ξ ± are still slightly tighter. We expect this to occur when the noise realisation pushes the contours closer to the edges of the prior region, especially since the halo model used for predicting the matter power spectrum is not calibrated for very high and low values of σ 8 and Ω m and therefore becomes less likely to match the data. The standard deviation of the best-fitting Σ 8 for COSEBIs is 0.019, for band powers it is 0.020 and for 2PCFs it is 0.018.

        <p>The first nuisance parameter that we consider is the error on the multiplicative shear calibration, m, that is applied to the ellipticity measurements, σ m . The value of m is estimated using image simulations (see Sect. 3 and Kannawadi et al. 2019). The assumptions made when producing the image simulations can affect the value of this calibration parameter. In our fiducial chains we absorb this uncertainty into the covariance matrix; however, we could instead allow m to vary as a free model parameter, one per redshift bin. In the covariance matrix estimation we use different values of σ m for each redshift bin (see Table 1) and assume that they are fully correlated. To produce the priors for the m parameters, we can take the same approach or instead assume that we do not know the extent of this correlation and use larger uncorrelated priors that encompass any expected correlations between the redshift bins (see for example Hoyle et al. 2018). To do so, we multiply each of the σ m values by the square root of Notes. χ 2 and p-values (probability to exceed the given χ 2 value) for the best-fitting parameters, given the effective number of degrees of freedom (DoF).

        <p>These setups cover all possible scenarios for the error on m. The m calibration in the simulations is determined per tomographic bin, so that the estimates are independent. However, the surface brightness profiles are modelled as Sersic profiles, and any model bias arising from mismatches with the true morphologies will be shared across the bins. Hence assuming that the m-values are fully correlated, as we have done in the fidu-cial analysis is an extreme scenario, whereas the scenario where m is uncorrelated represents the other extreme. A more consistent estimate requires multi-band image simulations to capture the correlation between photometric redshift determination and shear estimation.These setups cover all possible scenarios for the error on m.

        <p>Our astrophysical nuisance parameters are the baryon feedback parameter, A bary , and the amplitude of the intrinsic alignments of galaxies, A IA . We test the impact of A bary by assuming a nofeedback case with A bary fixed to 3.13 ("no baryons"). As illustrated by Fig. 8 the no-baryons case has a significantly larger effect on ξ ± , which is expected since the 2PCFs are more sensitive to small physical scales as we saw in Fig. 1. Contrary to expectations, COSEBIs appear to be more sensitive to baryon feedback compared to the band powers. This is not caused by the scale sensitivity, but is rather a result of this particular noise realisation. In Fig . A.3 we can see that the constraints on A bary for band powers are skewed towards larger values, indicating that they prefer a model with weaker baryon feedback (see also Table A.2). Therefore, the difference between band powers analysed with and without baryon feedback is smaller than for COSEBIs, which have a rather uniform A bary marginal distribution. For the 2PCFs, however, we find a similarly uniform distribution. The increased sensitivity of the 2PCFs to baryon feedback is thus a result of the small scales that impact their mod-elling. This is true for both the upper edge of the marginal credible region and to a lesser extent the width of the constraints for Σ 8 . In Appendix B.1 we discuss that the marginal distributions of poorly constrained parameters, such as A bary , can be skewed due to noise in the data.Our astrophysical nuisance parameters are the baryon feedback parameter, A bary , and the amplitude of the intrinsic alignments of galaxies, A IA .

        <p>As a test case we allow η IA to vary uniformly in [-5, 5] and set z pivot = 0.3 for a more straightforward comparison with previous KiDS and intrinsic alignment analyses (e.g. Joachimi et al. 2011). We call this case "redshift-dependent IA". In Fig. 8 we see that the redshift dependence of A IA has little impact on the upper edge of the marginal credible region of Σ 8 , however it can result in wider constraints. This redshiftdependence for the COSEBIs analysis produces a bimodal likelihood distribution, which results in a larger standard deviation. This is not seen with the other two statistics, which we therefore conclude is an effect of the cross-talk between the noise realisation and this extra freedom in the analysis. This has been seen in other analyses, when the additional redshift of the intrinsic alignment model is allowed to vary within broad priors (for example Joudaki et al. 2017aJoudaki et al. , 2020;;Asgari et al. 2020).

To capture the impact of an unconstrained intrinsic alignment model, we also run chains where both redshift bins 1 and 2 are removed from the analysis ("no z-bins 1 and 2").</p>
        <p>Of these setups the no z-bin 4 case has the largest impact on Σ 8 marginal values (left panel of Fig. 8). For this case, depending on the statistics used, we obtain between 1.1σ case to 1.8σ case differences in Σ 8 . The significance of these shifts however depends on which values from the distributions are compared with each other. For example, for the no z-bin 5 case we find larger deviations if we consider the maximum of the marginal distribution or the MAP values. In Appendix B.2 we perform a series of internal consistency tests which do not flag the differences between these redshift bins as statistically significant.Of these setups the no z-bin 4 case has the largest impact on Σ 8 marginal values (left panel of Fig. 8).

        <p>Our cosmological analysis has been performed independently, using three sets of two-point statistics. We do not expect to find the exact same constraints from these statistics, since they place different weights on a given angular scale. That said, the statistics are measured within the same survey volume and using the same galaxies, so that it is reasonable to assume some level of redundancy between these measurements. Given these two competing factors, it is not immediately clear what level of variation is expected. In other words, are the results in Table 3 consistent? Or is the difference between S 8 constraints caused by systematic effects being picked up by one statistic but not another?Our cosmological analysis has been performed independently, using three sets of two-point statistics.

        <p>To answer these questions, we apply a series of tests on mock data realisations, produced from multivariate Gaussian distributions. In our primary test we draw correlated noise realisations given the full covariance, including cross-correlations between 2PCFs, COSEBIs and band powers, estimated from the Salmo simulations (see Fig. B.1). We choose a fiducial cosmology and create 100 realisations of the data vector, including all three sets of two-point statistics. We analyse each set and realisation separately with a similar setup to our fiducial analysis explained in Sect. 3 and derive parameter constraints. We compare the maximum of the marginal distributions for S 8 between the two-point statistics for each realisation and find that the distribution of ∆S 8 := S stat1 8 -S stat2 8 , where S stat1/2 8 are the maximum marginal values for one of the statistics, is only 20-30% narrower than the width of the marginal distributions for S 8 per two-point statistic. Therefore, we conclude that differences of up to 0.7 -0.8σ between the results of COSEBIs, 2PCFs and band powers are expected to occur frequently (for about 68% of the realisations). For our KiDS-1000 analysis we find the maximum ∆S 8 for the marginal posterior modes of COSEBIs and 2PCFs, which is a difference of about 0.4σ.To answer these questions, we apply a series of tests on mock data realisations, produced from multivariate Gaussian distributions.

        <p>While the two-point statistics have different scale sensitivities, we expect their response to biases in the redshift distributions to be similar, as that will mainly affect the relative amplitude of the data vectors. H20b conducted tests of the KiDS-1000 redshift distributions by comparing them with simulations as well as cross-correlations with clustering-redshifts as discussed in Sect. 3 and Sect. 4.2. However, we note that these tests are not very sensitive to discrepancies that may exist in the tails of the redshift distributions, beyond their impact on the mean redshift.While the two-point statistics have different scale sensitivities, we expect their response to biases in the redshift distributions to be similar, as that will mainly affect the relative amplitude of the data vectors.

        <p>We also follow the methodology of Köhlinger et al. ( 2019) and perform three tiers of Bayesian consistency tests, comparing the cosmological inference from all bin combinations involving a given redshift bin with that from the remainder of the data vector. We find consistent results between all redshift bins, except for the second tomographic bin which covers the range 0.3 &lt; z B &lt; 0.5. Analyses using this bin and its crosscorrelations, compared to using all other bins, produce results that conflict by up to 3σ in some parameters (for more details see Sect. B.2). Also in Fig. A.4 we see that the data favours a δ z,2 parameter that shift the redshift distribution of this bin to larger values. While this inconsistency warrants further investigation in the future, we find that removing the second redshift bin, or indeed the first and second bin, from the analysis has a negligible impact on the cosmological parameter constraints (see Sect. 4.2.5).We also follow the methodology of Köhlinger et al.

        <p>In this section we compare our parameter constraints with previous results from cosmic shear surveys and Planck. The different cosmic shear analysis presented in Fig. 9 constrain slightly different degeneracy directions in the σ 8 -Ω m plane and therefore S 8 does not necessarily capture their best constrained parameter combination. Hence we also compare the results of these surveys in the S 8 -Ω m plane displayed in Fig. 10. We note that for all cosmic shear analyses presented here, the Ω m constraints are prior dominated. Consequently, no meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the differences that can be seen in the figure when it comes to this parameter.In this section we compare our parameter constraints with previous results from cosmic shear surveys and Planck.

        <p>where φ is either S 8 or Σ 8 , φ is the mean of φ and Var[φ] is its variance. With this definition we find that the Planck predictions are 3.4σ larger than our measured Σ 8 value. The difference in S 8 is 3σ, but note that this parameter does not fully capture the tension due to the residual correlation with Ω m . We use a complementary method which takes the full shape of the marginal dis-tributions into account, bypassing the Gaussian distribution assumption used in Eq. ( 16), and find slightly larger values of 3.2σ for S 8 and 3.5σ for Σ 8 (Hellinger; see appendix F.1 of Heymans et al. 2020 for details). These methods of estimating differences between cosmological analyses ignore the possible complexities of the multi-dimensional parameter space. Other methods that test consistencies within the full posterior are generally less stable owing to the difficulty in estimating the statistical properties of this distribution to a sufficiently high accuracy. On the other if the tension is truly in one aspect of the model, summarised in a single parameter, then including extra dimensions to the tension metric will likely dilute the significance of the results. A Bayesian approach compares the full likelihood between an analysis of the two sets of data separately and their combined analysis. The Bayes factor can be used in conjunction with the Jeffreys' scale to assess the tension between the data sets. We find that the base 10 logarithm of the Bayes factor is 0.54 -1.15, with a preference for two separate cosmologies, corresponding to a substantial to strong evidence for disagreement (the two values are estimated via the importance nested sampling and the traditional methods, see Appendix B.2 for more details). This result is in qualitative agreement with the simple marginal distribution comparison above. Handley &amp; Lemos (2019) suggested using a different measure called suspiciousness, S , which is less sensitive to the choice of priors compared to the raw evidence comparison of the Bayes factor. We measure this quantity but are unable to cast it into a meaningful scale of disagreement. To do so we need to have a robust measure of the degrees of freedom for Planck, KiDS-1000 and their joint analysis. In J20 we saw that the dimensionality method that is currently used in conjunction with suspiciousness produces biased estimates of the effective number of parameters (see Appendix B.3 for more details).

        <p>From a theoretical point of view we conclude that there is a strong case for favouring COSEBIs and/or band power statistics over the standard shear correlation functions in the likelihood analysis, with COSEBIs providing the cleanest and most compact data vector, and band powers offering intuition through directly tracing the angular power spectra predicted from theory. Both of these methods allow for an E and B-mode decomposition, which are mixed with each other in the case of the correlation functions. This will be of particular importance for analysis of future data with improved constraining power. Despite these differences, we find the KiDS-1000 S 8 constraints derived from the three statistics to be in excellent agreement. Due to the different scales probed, the analyses trace different sections of the Ω m -σ 8 degeneracy line, which causes S 8 to not fully capture the constraining power transverse to the degeneracy in all cases. Fitting the parameter Σ 8 = σ 8 (Ω m /0.3) α to the posterior, we find a best fit of α = 0.51 for ξ ± , i.e. S 8 is very close to the optimal summary parameter as found in previous KiDS analyses. For COSEBIs and band powers, α = 0.54 and 0.58, respectively. The constraining power on the optimal Σ 8 is then nearly identical between the three statistics.From a theoretical point of view we conclude that there is a strong case for favouring COSEBIs and/or band power statistics over the standard shear correlation functions in the likelihood analysis, with COSEBIs providing the cleanest and most compact data vector, and band powers offering intuition through directly tracing the angular power spectra predicted from theory.

        <p>Constraining a spatially flat ΛCDM model, we obtain S 8 = 0.758 +0.017 -0.026 (68% CI) for our fiducial setup using COSEBIs. The quoted values are extracted from the mode and highest posterior density of the marginal S 8 posterior (denoted by M-HPD). Since the analysis of mock data shows that the marginal posterior mode or mean can be shifted significantly from the global best fit, due to a high-dimensional posterior with complex shape, we additionally provide the multivariate posterior maximum with an associated projected credible interval (PJ-HPD), S 8 = 0.759 +0.024 -0.021 . For KiDS-1000 cosmic shear the two credible intervals are in very good agreement though, with nearly identical point estimates for S 8 and credible interval sizes differing by less than 5 % (this is also true for Planck CMB constraints). The goodness of fit is acceptable, ranging from a p-value of 0.16 for COSEBIs to 0.03 for 2PCFs and 0.01 for band powers. Since the latter two preferentially extract information from higher angular frequencies relative to COSEBIs, this could indicate an as yet insignificant limitation in our non-linear modelling, e.g. in the intrinsic alignment of galaxies. On the other hand given the consistency between the values of S 8 for COSEBIs, 2PCFs, and band powers, this could be a result of an unfortunate noise realisation that affects the higher -modes.Constraining a spatially flat ΛCDM model, we obtain S 8 = 0.758 +0.017 -0.026 (68% CI) for our fiducial setup using COSEBIs.

        <p>Due to the tighter constraints of KiDS-1000, the tension in Σ 8 with Planck Collaboration et al. (2020a) has increased to 3.4σ, i.e. a 7 in 10 000 chance of a mere statistical fluctuation between the low and high-redshift probes assuming Gaussian distributions (3σ in the less constrained S 8 ). Whether this discrepancy is mitigated by extensions to our cosmological model will be further investigated by Tröster et al. (2020a), but the most obvious routes are unlikely to provide a satisfactory solution. For instance, KiDS and Planck would be reconciled in significantly open cosmologies (Joudaki et al. 2017a), but Planck prefers a positive curvature whose significance is still under debate (see Efstathiou &amp; Gratton 2020 and references therein). We argue that the tension with the CMB indeed manifests in the parameter S 8 (or Σ 8 if S 8 retains significant correlations with Ω m ), as was also observed in Tröster et al. (2020b). Bayesian tension measures that act on the full shared parameter space between KiDS and Planck are also provided, showing a substantial to strong evidence for disagreement.Due to the tighter constraints of KiDS-1000, the tension in Σ 8 with Planck Collaboration et al. (2020a) has increased to 3.4σ, i.e. a 7 in 10 000 chance of a mere statistical fluctuation between the low and high-redshift probes assuming Gaussian distributions (3σ in the less constrained S 8 ).

        <p>We demonstrate that our constraints are robust to changes in the calibration procedures of multiplicative calibration in gravitational shear estimates, as well as of the redshift distributions. The S 8 credible intervals are not significantly affected by these changes either, which indicates that the KiDS-1000 constraints are statistics dominated. We also find no unexpected shifts in the inferred S 8 value when removing baryon feedback from the matter power spectrum model, when introducing additional flexibility to the intrinsic alignment model, or when removing all tomographic bin combinations involving a certain bin from the data vector. A Bayesian internal consistency analysis of tomographic bin splits reveals significant tension (up to 3σ) when isolating all bin combinations involving the second bin, whose signals have higher amplitude than expected for its mean redshift. This will be a priority to investigate further in forthcoming work. However, excluding all elements of the KiDS-1000 data vector dependent on the second bin does not affect our cosmological constraints, which we therefore consider robust to this effect.We demonstrate that our constraints are robust to changes in the calibration procedures of multiplicative calibration in gravitational shear estimates, as well as of the redshift distributions.

        <p>Looking ahead to the Legacy analysis of the complete KiDS survey, the statistical power of cosmic shear measurements is going to further improve thanks to a 35 % increase in sky area and a second pass in the i-band over the full survey. New, dedicated VST observations in spectroscopic survey fields will consolidate the redshift calibration and yield gains especially at redshifts beyond unity, unlocking the potential for very high signal-to-noise cosmic shear signals beyond our current highest-redshift bin. An upgrade to full multi-band image simulations will improve both the precision and accuracy of the shear calibration. Together with the innovation and cross-comparison opportunities provided by the contemporaneous DES and HSC cosmic shear measurements, we can therefore be optimistic that decisive new insights into the structure-growth tension will be delivered even before the next generation of powerful weak lensing surveys will begin to take data.Looking ahead to the Legacy analysis of the complete KiDS survey, the statistical power of cosmic shear measurements is going to further improve thanks to a 35 % increase in sky area and a second pass in the i-band over the full survey.

        <p>In Sect. 4.1 we showed our main results, focusing mainly on S 8 and Σ constraints, where we argued that, in general, S 8 does not capture the best-constrained direction perpendicular to the Ω m -σ 8 degeneracy.

In the right-hand panel we show the best-fitting σ 8 = Σ 8 (Ω m /0.3) -α (dashed curve) to the sampled σ 8 and Ω m posterior points for the band powers. We find 0.58 to be the best-fit value for α. In the left-hand panel we show the resulting Σ 8 and Ω m for α fixed to 0.58. Here we calculate Σ 8 for each point in the samples separately.

        <p>With this criterion we see that S 8 and A IA are the only two physical parameters that are constrained. We do not use this criterion for the second group of parameters, which are derived from the first group, since their prior is non-flat. We note that the Ω m constraints are also prior dominated as demonstrated in J20. The last group of parameters in Table A.2 have Gaussian priors; therefore they, by definition, pass the criterion described above. Their constraints, however, are very similar to the size of the input Gaussian priors, hence we do not show them in bold. Figure A.3 shows marginalised credible regions for all the sampled cosmological and astrophysical parameters. We show results for COSEBIs (orange), band powers (pink) and 2PCFs (cyan). We apply a kernel density estimation (KDE) method to smooth the distributions. For parameters with poor constraints, e.g. Ω b h 2 , KDE smoothing creates artificial constraints by smoothing the edges of the distribution where it hits the limits of the flat prior range. In Fig. A.4 we show our constraints for δ z,i = z est iz true i (see Sect. 3) and A IA . Here we have shifted the contours by the ∆z values in Table 1 to centre the prior, shown in grey, on zero (dashed lines). Any shift from zero for the δ z parameters is indicative of a self-calibration by the cosmic shear data. We see that the δ z contours mostly recover the input prior and that δ z values are consistent with zero within their 1σ marginal region. The largest deviation is found for the second tomographic bin, where we see an almost 1σ shift towards negative values, indicating a preference for a redshift distribution with a larger mean. This suggests that the shifted SOM redshift distributions have underestimated the mean of the true redshift of the galaxies in bin 2. We have seen other indications in the data for an anomaly in the distribution of the second bin. Our internal consistency tests (see Appendix B for more details) also flag the second bin as an anomaly. Nevertheless, in Fig. 7 we showed that excluding redshift bin 2 has a negligible effect on our final results.With this criterion we see that S 8 and A IA are the only two physical parameters that are constrained.

        <p>In Fig. B.1 we show the cross-correlation matrix between the three two-point statistics showing combinations with redshift bins 1 and 5. We can see sub-matrices for the auto-correlations of each of the statistics, as labelled in the figure. The top triangle entries show the level of cross-correlations, while the bottom triangle shows all the values that exceed ±20% (red for positive and blue for negative values). We see that our two-point statistics have non-negligible cross-correlations, with highest values belonging to correlations between ξ -and band powers or COSE-BIs. The figure also shows negative elements presenting anticorrelations. These are most pronounced in the case of COSEBIs and band powers. In addition, we see that many of the elements of the cross-covariance are small, showing a lack of correlation.

        <p>we find the maximum of the marginal distribution to be biased with respect to the input S 8 (also see section 6.4 of J20). 2PCFs show the smallest bias, however they also possess the tightest distribution, resulting in a similar relative bias compared to their width (see the discussion on MAP versus maximum marginal values in Sect. 4.1). On the right-hand side we see that the ∆S 8 between two statistics has a comparable size to the mean distribution shown in grey. To assess the level of difference that we expect for ∆S 8 , we compare the width of each distribution with the mean distribution using σ values coming from the two statistics that are compared. We find that ∆S 8 is only 20 -30% tighter than its corresponding mean values, comparing any two of the statistics. This means that we do not expect to find perfect agreement between the results of different two-point statistics.we find the maximum of the marginal distribution to be biased with respect to the input S 8 (also see section 6.4 of J20). 2PCFs show the smallest bias, however they also possess the tightest distribution, resulting in a similar relative bias compared to their width (see the discussion on MAP versus maximum marginal values in Sect. 4.1).

        <p>Our parameter constraints for σ 8 and Ω m in Fig. 6 show that the ξ ± results are shifted along the degeneracy line towards high σ 8 and low Ω m , such that they touch the edge of our prior range. This seemingly large effect is fully consistent with a noise fluctuation, and among the aforementioned 100 mock realisations we saw many examples with similar trends. Figure B.3 shows one such realisation. In some of the other realisations COSEBI or band power contours are shifted high along the degeneracy direction. In general, we find that the contours for poorly constrained parameters can move towards the edge of their prior range producing one-sided constraints, while shortening the marginalised posterior distributions. Given the hard cut at the prior edge, this will appear as a tighter constraint on a parameter, although it is fully dependent on the noise realisation. We see another example of this effect in the KiDS-1000 data in Fig. A.3 where the constraints on A bary with band powers appear tighter than the results of COSEBIs or 2PCFs (also see the n s constraints).Our parameter constraints for σ 8 and Ω m in Fig. 6 show that the ξ ± results are shifted along the degeneracy line towards high σ 8 and low Ω m , such that they touch the edge of our prior range.

        <p>We use the 
            <rs type="software">MontePython</rs> package (Audren et al. 2013;Brinckmann &amp; Lesgourgues 2018) where our internal consistency tests are developed. We find very good consistency between our 
            <rs type="software">MontePython</rs> and KCAP likelihood codes (better than our 0.1σ threshold). Currently, 
            <rs type="software">MontePython</rs> does not allow for sampling over parameters with non-flat priors. To circumvent this issue it is common practice to include the prior in the likelihood values. This can result in biased estimates of Z for non-flat priors. In our fiducial chains the δ z shifts have a Gaussian prior (as does δ c for the 2PCFs). In Sect. 4.2 we showed that fixing these to their fiducial value has little impact on the constraints (the no σ z case). Given this limitation in 
            <rs type="software">MontePython</rs> and the negligible impact of the δ z shifts, we fix these parameters (and δ c for the 2PCFs), for both 1 and 2-cosmo runs.

        <p>Given a high-dimensional parameter space, it is difficult to estimate the evidence accurately. Alternative methods to 
            <rs type="software">Multi</rs>-Nest have been proposed which aim to provide a more reliable value for Z (e.g. Polychord, Handley et al. 2015). These alternatives are however several times slower than the 
            <rs type="software">MultiNest</rs> runs; thus we estimate the evidence from the 
            <rs type="software">MultiNest</rs> output using two methods: the standard approach employing the posterior sample (trad.) and an importance nested sampling (import.) version generated automatically by 
            <rs type="software">MultiNest</rs>. To estimate the traditional method we use the anesthetic processing tool (Handley 2019). We find that in general the differences between these estimates of Z are larger than their associated errors, while it is not clear which one is closer to the truth. To assess this, we run one Polychord chain for a case where we found the largest difference between the traditional and importance sampling values. We find that the Polychord estimate of log 10 Z is in-between these two values. Therefore, we report the Bayes factor for both of these estimates. Lemos et al. (2020) suggested using suspiciousness, S , instead of the Bayes factor for the tier 1 test, as it has much reduced sensitivity to the volume of the prior. This is particularly useful for the tier 1 test as the 2-cosmo model is inherently penalised due to the doubling of parameter space. We show ln S values for all cases, but refrain from translating them into the popular τσ measure. To do so, we need a robust estimate of the effective number of parameters, N Θ , for both the 1-cosmo and 2-cosmo runs. In section 6.3 of J20 we see that the dimensionality measure which has so far been used in conjunction with suspiciousness is in general a biased estimator of N Θ . The other methods suggested in J20 involve running multiple computationally expensive chains. Therefore, here we only report the values for ln S and leave their further interpretation to future work.
        </p>
        <p>With the tier 2 test we consider the posterior of the difference between the two instances of the same parameters that result from the 2-cosmo analysis.

The smaller this fraction the less likely it is to have agreement between the two parts of the data. This fraction is then cast into an τσ value based on the fractional differences between the peak and the tails of a one dimensional Gaussian distribution (more details in section 2.2 of Köhlinger et al. 2019).With the tier 2 test we consider the posterior of the difference between the two instances of the same parameters that result from the 2-cosmo analysis.

        <p>Table B.1 lists the tier 1 results in the left columns and the tier 2 results on the right. We report values for all three two-point statistics. Similar trends can be seen for the results of COSEBIs, band powers and 2PCFs. In all cases redshift bin 2 stands out, whereas the remaining tests return values consistent with noise. In this case the tier 1 test shows a negative log 10 R indicating a preference for the 2-cosmo model. We use Jeffreys' scale to interpret the significance of the measured log 10 R, and find it to show strong to decisive evidence for the 2-cosmo model, depending on the statistics and the method used to estimate the evidences. The tier 2 test corroborates this result. We see that the parameter differences for this separation of the data are larger than all the other cases, with up to 21 3σ.Table B.1 lists the tier 1 results in the left columns and the tier 2 results on the right.

        <p>To better understand the origin of the inconsistency between the second tomographic bin and all others, we compare the translated posterior distributions (TPD, Köhlinger et al. 2019, section 2.3) that are produced from the 2-cosmo chains. We make predictions for all bins using the TPDs and compare them with the data. Figure B.4 shows results for band powers. We choose band powers here as their data points are considerably less correlated compared to COSEBIs or 2PCFs, facilitating a visual inspection. The TPDs of bin 2 and its cross-correlations are shown in red, while the TPDs of all other bins are presented in blue. The width of the curves show the standard deviation of the TPDs. We see that the first bin and its cross-correlations, owing to their very low signal-to-noise, cannot distinguish between the two sets of TPDs, whereas for other pairs of redshift bins the two TPDs are 21 We have seen even more significant differences when including some of the poorly constrained parameters. For example, when comparing the parameter estimates for ∆(S 8 , A IA , Ω m ) we find differences of up to 3.6σ, however as Ω m is not significantly constrained by our data, this more significant value may just be a result of additional fluctuations in the noise. clearly separated. The inconsistency of the bin 2 results with all other bins is clear here, with the former having larger signals than expected for their redshift distributions.To better understand the origin of the inconsistency between the second tomographic bin and all others, we compare the translated posterior distributions (TPD, Köhlinger et al. 2019, section 2.3) that are produced from the 2-cosmo chains.

        <p>A reasonable explanation for this discrepancy is that a small but high-redshift population of galaxies has contaminated the second bin. We expect a higher signal for higher-redshift galaxies, as their light passes more structures before reaching us producing stronger correlations between their observed shapes. Since here we have no freedom to change the redshift distributions, the model is forced to increase the amplitude of the power spectra to compensate for the higher amplitude in correlations with bin 2. This is done via varying both A IA and S 8 as can be seen in Fig. B.5. This figure illustrates the tier 2 results, comparing the constraints for the parameters obtained from bin 2 and its cross-correlations (orange) with the rest of the data (blue). We show marginal distributions for the subset of parameters, σ 8 , Ω m and A IA . In Fig. A.4 we saw that the largest δ z shift belonged to this bin. Including these shift parameters can mitigate these inconsistencies to some extent.A reasonable explanation for this discrepancy is that a small but high-redshift population of galaxies has contaminated the second bin.

        <p>In Sect. 4.2 we evaluated the impact of removing the second bin from the analysis and found its effect on our final results to be negligible. Consequently, we do not exclude this bin from our fiducial analysis (also see the discussion in Sect. 4.3). Regardless, due to the excess signal in bin 2, including it in the analysis can only serves to increase the value of S 8 and decrease the tension with Planck. and (D.7) in the case of COSEBIs and band powers. We can then use these values as inputs to model ξ c -, E c n /B c n and C c E/B,l . This can be done by running the same tree-code used to measure the 2PCFs with two separate runs where the ellipticities of galaxies are replaced by two sets of constant values.In Sect. 4.2 we evaluated the impact of removing the second bin from the analysis and found its effect on our final results to be negligible.

        <p>We estimate that this effect on COSEBIs, band powers and ξ - for the KiDS-1000 data is smaller than 1% compared to the size of the error bars, where we used values for c 1 and c 2 taken from the 5σ limits of their estimated errors (see G20, section 3.5.1). Since cos(4φ) (θ) and sin(4φ) (θ) are non-zero due to survey boundaries and masks, the effect of the constant c-term is scaledependent (increases with θ).

        <p>For larger surveys with contiguous coverage these terms should be small given angular scales that are well within the survey area. However, the measurement errors also decrease for these surveys. Therefore, their importance needs to be reevaluated for future surveys. Given this marginally non-Gaussian result for some of the COSEBIs modes for certain pairs of redshift bins, we test the distribution of their χ 2 values in the simulations (comparing each mock E n with their mean value over all mocks) and find that to be consistent with a χ 2 distribution with the correct degrees of freedom (p-value= 0.8). Given these results, we conclude that the full distribution of COSEBIs is close enough to a Gaussian. For a likelihood analysis the χ 2 is the quantity that is used and therefore the assumption that it is χ 2 -distributed is of more importance than the Gaussianity of the individual COSEBIs modes. With more simulations we can resolve whether or not the slightly low p-values persist.For larger surveys with contiguous coverage these terms should be small given angular scales that are well within the survey area.

        <p>The two-point statistics that we consider have differing sensitivities to -scales as shown in Fig. 1. Therefore, despite being measured from the exact same data set, we do not expect them to find the same constraints on cosmological parameters. Previously, seemingly incompatible results from analysis of the same data with different two-point statistics has been seen. For example, the quadratic power spectrum estimator developed by Köhlinger et al. (2017) yielded a lower value of S 8 compared to the 2PCF analysis on the same KiDS data set (using Data Release 3). In addition, the HSC analysis of Hamana et al. (2020) using 2PCFs found a higher value of S 8 compared to the pseudo-CL analysis of Hikage et al. (2019). Unlike these previous analyses, here we quantify the level of difference that we expect for constriants from our summary statistics.The two-point statistics that we consider have differing sensitivities to -scales as shown in Fig. 1.

Here we use a similar methodology to the tier 1 test in Appendix B.2 to quantify the inconsistency between KiDS-1000 and Planck, also using COSEBIs, which are chosen owing to their better goodness-of-fit to the model. We compare the evidence for a single set of cosmological parameters for both KiDS-1000 and Planck by running a joint chain (1-cosmo) with the evidences found for their separate analysis (2-cosmo).

        <p>To calculate covariance matrices, we need to estimate the effective area, A eff , of the observed images; see Joachimi et al. (2020), appendix E, for the details of the covariance model. The value of A eff depends on the assumed pixel size, since we use a binary mask. The shape noise term is independent of A eff , since this term is estimated using the effective number of galaxy pairs. There are two other Gaussian terms in the covariance matrix which are impacted by the choice of A eff . For the cosmic variance (also known as sample variance) and the mixed terms the covariance scales approximately with the inverse of A eff . However, in the case of the mixed term, we include the effective number density of galaxies, n eff , which in turn depends on the effective area. We scale n eff with respect to A eff to keep the total number of galaxies in each tomographic bin constant and independent of the effective area. As a result, the only Gaussian term that is impacted by A eff is the cosmic variance term. J20 argue for using the effective area of a survey with the same extent as KiDS-1000 but without the very small scale masks to calculate this term. One way to achieve this is by lowering the resolution of the mask, as we implement here. Figure C.1 shows marginal constraints for S 8 with the fiducial priors used in our analysis. Noise-free mock data is used to assess the impact of the pixel size. We consider three different resolutions of the survey mask: at the OmegaCam pixel size, resulting in A eff = 777.4 deg 2 ; using HealPix with N side = 4096 (A eff = 867.0 deg 2 ); and using HealPix with N side = 2048 (A eff = 904.2 deg 2 ). The survey masks consider a pixel as observed, if some fraction of the sky area covered by it has unmasked imaging, which explains the increase in area as the res- for one of the 100 mock realisations that we analysed. In the same set of realisations we find a number of similar results, with shortened contours for one or more of the statistics.To calculate covariance matrices, we need to estimate the effective area, A eff , of the observed images; see Joachimi et al. (2020), appendix E, for the details of the covariance model. The value of A eff depends on the assumed pixel size, since we use a binary mask. The shape noise term is independent of A eff , since this term is estimated using the effective number of galaxy pairs. There are two other Gaussian terms in the covariance matrix which are impacted by the choice of A eff . For the cosmic variance (also known as sample variance) and the mixed terms the covariance scales approximately with the inverse of A eff . However, in the case of the mixed term, we include the effective number density of galaxies, n eff , which in turn depends on the effective area. We scale n eff with respect to A eff to keep the total number of galaxies in each tomographic bin constant and independent of the effective area. As a result, the only Gaussian term that is impacted by A eff is the cosmic variance term. J20 argue for using the effective area of a survey with the same extent as KiDS-1000 but without the very small scale masks to calculate this term.

        <p>olution becomes coarser. Here we have kept the area for the subdominant non-Gaussian terms fixed to A eff = 867.0 deg 2 and included the m calibration covariance terms which are independent of the area. We see that the constraints are not significantly impacted by the effective area. Both the standard deviation of the sampled points and the peaks of the marginal distributions are unchanged well within our error margin of 0.1σ. In figures 10 and 11 of J20 we see that the diagonal terms in the cosmic shear covariance matrix are dominated by the noise term, whereas the diagonals of the sub-matrices are dominated by the mixed term. Therefore, this result is expected. In all three cases the maximum marginal value of S 8 is slightly biased towards smaller values, while the projection of the maximum posterior recovers the input.olution becomes coarser.

        <p>The measured ellipticities of galaxies can be biased by an additive term, usually dubbed the c-term. In our data we correct for a constant overall c-term for each of the ellipticity components (see G20 for more details). There is an uncertainty on this parameter, such that there could be some residual signal from the term that remains in the data. We are able to marginalise over this uncertainty using additional free parameters. In our analysis we considered a single additive parameter δ c = ± c 2 1 + c 2 2 which only affects ξ + . The other statistics that we consider are unaffected by this constant additive terms (to very good approximation in the case of band powers); however, they can still be affected by c-terms due to survey boundary effects. Here we first look at how ξ -is impacted by a constant c 1 and c 2 , and then propagate through to COSEBIs and band powers.The measured ellipticities of galaxies can be biased by an additive term, usually dubbed the c-term.
