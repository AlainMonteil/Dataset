        <p>The Covid-19 pandemic is causing significant social and economic impacts across large parts of the world. At the time of writing the number of Covid-19 cases worldwide has reached 7.2 million, while the death toll has exceeded 400,000.1 Governments and health care systems are facing the immense challenge of trying to control the spread of the virus and to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed as millions of individuals remain subject to lockdown and face significant economic uncertainty. In order to respond to these unprecedented challenges it is important for policy makers and health care professionals to understand which groups of individuals suffer the highest morbidity and mortality risks from Covid-19 and which factors may exacerbate these risks.The Covid-19 pandemic is causing significant social and economic impacts across large parts of the world.

        <p>A contributory factor that has been tentatively explored in several recent academic studies is poor air quality. While some such studies have identified the significant improvements in air quality that have resulted from Covid-19 lockdowns (Cicala et al. 2020; Cole et al. 2020), others have pointed to a correlation between Covid-19 hotspots and areas with high levels of pollution concentrations (Travaglio et al. 2020; Conticini et al. 2020). It is well known that long term exposure to pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide ( NO 2 ), sulphur dioxide ( SO 2 ), and fine particulate matter ( PM 2.5 ) contributes to cardiovascular disease, reduces lung function, and causes respiratory illness (Faustini et al. 2014; Ming Han et al. 2015; Katanoda et al. 2011; Abbey et al. 1999; De Weerdt et al. 2020). These pollutants have been shown to cause a persistent inflammatory response even in the relatively young, and to increase the risk of infection by viruses that target the respiratory tract (Travaglio et al. 2020; Conticini et al. 2020). While Covid-19 produces only mild symptoms for most sufferers, in a minority of cases it results in an excessive inflammatory response causing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and death. Given the clear overlaps between the symptoms of Covid-19-induced ARDS and long term exposure to air pollution, a number of studies have begun to explore the links between the two.A contributory factor that has been tentatively explored in several recent academic studies is poor air quality.

        <p>Focusing on the UK, Travaglio et al. (2020), for instance, find evidence of a correlation between Covid-19 cases and concentrations of nitrogen oxides and ozone, while Ogen (2020) examines 66 regions across Italy, France, Germany, and Spain and finds similar evidence. Conticini et al. (2020) focus on Northern Italy and conclude that pollution concentrations are a likely contributor to the high Covid-19 death rates experienced in that region. Setti et al. (2020) find similar evidence for Italy and raise the possibility that particulate matter could actually carry the virus thereby directly contributing to its spread. A preliminary analysis of the Netherlands also finds evidence of a link between concentrations of PM 2.5 and Covid-19 cases (Andree 2020). Finally, Wu et al. (2020) examine US counties and estimate the relationship between county-level Covid-19 death rates and long-term concentrations of fine particulate matter ( PM 2.5 ) using a negative binomial count model, controlling for a wide range of confounding factors. They conclude that a 1 μg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 is associated with an 8% increase in the Covid-19 death rate.Focusing on the UK, Travaglio et al.

This allows the researcher to assess whether any correlation between Covid-19 and pollution exposure still holds once differences in social deprivation, population density, ethnic composition, and other factors are controlled for. While Wu et al. (2020) come closest to doing this, US counties are still relatively large, raising the question of how well such aggregated data can capture the local variation in confounding effects without being 'averaged out'.

        <p>With the above in mind, this paper undertakes a detailed analysis of the relationship between pollution concentrations and Covid-19 using data for 355 relatively small Dutch municipalities. More specifically, by using high-resolution air pollution data as well as combining administrative and municipal-level data, we estimate the relationship between long term exposure to concentrations of PM 2.5 , NO 2 , and SO 2 and the number of Covid- 19 infections, the number of individuals hospitalised with Covid-19, and the number of those who died as a result of Covid-19. We use a negative binomial count model and are able to control for a wide range of potential confounding effects, including those relating to income, age, underlying health conditions, education, social deprivation, ethnic composition, workplace characteristics, spatial and social proximity to potential risk factors and others. Our analysis utilises Covid-19 data up to 5th June 2020 allowing us to capture almost the full wave of the epidemic and hence much more fully than the previous studies which have examined data up to only March or early April. Finally, we undertake a number of robustness exercises including instrumenting pollution to address some possible endogeneity concerns. Therefore, compared to Wu et al. (2020) we use data at a finer resolution 3 and include more controls, plus mitigate concerns arising from imprecise measurement of pollution.With the above in mind, this paper undertakes a detailed analysis of the relationship between pollution concentrations and Covid-19 using data for 355 relatively small Dutch municipalities.

        <p>The Netherlands provides a useful setting in which to examine the link between Covid-19 and air pollution. As a relatively small, densely populated nation with an ethnically diverse, aging population, the country faces a number of potential Covid-19 risk factors.

The Netherlands additionally experiences hot spots of poor local air pollution both within urban areas and also, in the case of PM 2.5 , in more rural areas perhaps due in part to intensive livestock farming.

        <p>The first confirmed Covid-19 case in the Netherlands occurred in late February 2020, and by early June over 46,000 cases had been identified. Daily new cases of Covid-19 peaked at 1,335 on April 10th, while the daily death toll peaked 3 days earlier at 235. Both daily new cases and daily deaths have been declining steadily since. While all 12 of the Netherlands' provinces have experienced broadly similar trends, levels of Covid-19 cases have differed significantly across provinces. For instance, in the southern provinces of North Brabant and South Holland daily new cases peaked at over 350,5 while in other provinces such as Groningen and Drenthe, both in the north of the country, new cases peaked at fewer than 40 per day. 6 From the outset of the epidemic within the Netherlands the south east has experienced a disproportionate number of Covid-19 cases. Figure 1 shows the distribution of cases per capita across the 355 municipalities of the Netherlands up to June 5th 2020. The red 'hotspots' in the south east, which are largely within the provinces of North Brabant and Limburg, demonstrate the relative intensity of cases in those regions. Unusually, these are relatively rural regions with low population density raising the question of why these provinces have been so badly affected by One potential explanation raised by the Dutch media has been the annual carnival celebrations held during the last week of February and beginning of March which were concentrated largely within North Brabant and Limburg. These celebrations attracted thousands of people from all over the country to street parties and parades, as they do each year. Numerous Dutch media reports have suggested that these celebrations may at least partially explain the rapid spread of Covid-19 within these regions and also to other regions of the Netherlands via carnival participants.8 However, the significant variation in Covid-19 cases across the municipalities within these two provinces suggests that the carnival is unlikely to fully explain the density and distribution of these cases.The first confirmed Covid-19 case in the Netherlands occurred in late February 2020, and by early June over 46,000 cases had been identified.

        <p>Another possible explanation that has received less attention in the Netherlands revolves around the intensive livestock farming that takes place within North Brabant and Limburg. These regions house over 63% of the Netherlands' 12 million pigs and 42% of its 101 million chickens. 9 Such intensive livestock production produces large quantities of ammonia ( NH 3 ), which can be an important contributor to PM 2.5 concentrations. Figure 3 in the "Appendix" provides a map of 2019 NH 3 concentrations and shows that the south eastern regions have some of the highest concentrations within the Netherlands. Indeed, a comparison with the map of PM 2.5 concentrations in Fig. 1 shows a very similar pattern illustrating how ammonia potentially contributes to PM 2.5 .Another possible explanation that has received less attention in the Netherlands revolves around the intensive livestock farming that takes place within North Brabant and Limburg.

        <p>While the maximum annual average concentration of PM 2.5 at municipality level is 12.3 μg/m 3 , the equivalent figure for a 1 km × 1 km gridcell is 23.9 μg/m 3 , which is close to the EU air quality standard of 25 μg/m 3 . This indicates that local concentrations of PM 2.5 within the regions of North Brabant and Limburg are close to dangerous levels even when averaged annually, raising the likelihood that for shorter periods they may exceed safe levels. Since PM 2.5 concentrations show a similar spatial distribution to Covid-19 cases, also in Fig. 1, it's reasonable to examine this potential link and to see whether the visual relationship between Covid-19 cases and PM 2.5 concentrations withstands controlling for other potential contributory factors.10While the maximum annual average concentration of PM 2.5 at municipality level is 12.3 μg/m 3 , the equivalent figure for a 1 km × 1 km gridcell is 23.9 μg/m 3 , which is close to the EU air quality standard of 25 μg/m 3 .

        <p>Since our dependent variables take the form of discrete count variables, estimating Eq. 1 using OLS could result in inconsistent, inefficient, and biased estimates (Long 1997; Hoffman 2004). The alternative is to use Poisson or negative binomial count models. Since the error assumption of the Poisson model requires the conditional mean to equal the conditional variance, a condition that our over-dispersed data fails to meet, we employ the negative binomial model. This model builds upon the Poisson model by adding a parameter that allows the conditional variance to exceed the conditional mean.Since our dependent variables take the form of discrete count variables, estimating Eq. 1 using OLS could result in inconsistent, inefficient, and biased estimates (Long 1997; Hoffman 2004).

        <p>If we fail to control for all potential determinants of Covid-19 that are possibly correlated with pollution, then the estimated coefficients on the pollution measures could potentially be biased.

        <p>In principle our pollution variables may be subject to systematic measurement error if the error was in some way related to the pollution-Covid-19 relationship. For instance, if individuals with poor health were more (or less) likely to live in polluted areas and hence were more (or less) likely to catch or succumb to the virus. We are unable to identify any potential mechanisms of this nature and our wide range of explanatory variables should obviously help to control for any such effects if they were to exist.In principle our pollution variables may be subject to systematic measurement error if the error was in some way related to the pollution-Covid-19 relationship.

        <p>Such measurement error could arise if we are not accurately capturing long-term pollution exposure within each municipality. While Sect. 4 outlines how we measure longterm pollution exposure, we note that any non-systematic measurement error of this kind is likely to result in a conservative estimate of the association between pollution and Covid-19 due to possible attenuation bias. Nevertheless, we do instrument pollution in Eq. 1 as a means of further reducing concerns around attenuation bias. Since we are using a non-linear count model we instrument using a control function approach, which is likely to be more efficient than a standard instrumental variables model (Wooldridge 2015). This approach involves estimating air pollution, our potentially endogenous variable, as a function of our instruments and other exogenous variables, and then inserting the predicted errors from this first stage into the second stage as a separate control variable (in addition to our air pollution variable). 11 A simple test of the statistical significance of the coefficient on the predicted residuals will inform us whether our pollution variable was indeed endogenous, a procedure equivalent to a Durbin-Wu-Hausman exogeneity test.Such measurement error could arise if we are not accurately capturing long-term pollution exposure within each municipality.

        <p>To be suitable for use as an instrument a variable should be correlated with air pollution but independent of our Covid-19 variables and hence should only influence them through the effect of air pollution. We experiment with two potential candidates. The first is a long lag of air pollution. More specifically, we use annual pollution concentrations averaged over the period 1995-2000. Second, we use a measure of the average commuting time for residents in each municipality. This variable draws upon free-flow road network data from VUGeoPlaza enabling us to calculate average travel time for every j and k location pair. In order to calculate the commuting times we obtain the residential and work locations of each worker at the 4 -digit postal code level (which corresponds to neighbourhood level) by constructing an employer-employee data set (LEED) based on linking administrative data, Dutch Labour Force surveys, and Tax Registers. 12 We then combine the travel time data with the LEED. Travel times linked with the LEED allow us to calculate the commuting time of each worker to their actual place of work. Additionally we calculate the travel time based on the Euclidean distance between the 4 -digit postal code, assuming an average speed of 10 km/h. We then choose the lowest of the commuting time and the Euclidean distance travel time 1 3To be suitable for use as an instrument a variable should be correlated with air pollution but independent of our Covid-19 variables and hence should only influence them through the effect of air pollution.

Second, we use a measure of the average commuting time for residents in each municipality. This variable draws upon free-flow road network data from VUGeoPlaza enabling us to calculate average travel time for every j and k location pair. In order to calculate the commuting times we obtain the residential and work locations of each worker at the 4 -digit postal code level (which corresponds to neighbourhood level) by constructing an employer-employee data set (LEED) based on linking administrative data, Dutch Labour Force surveys, and Tax Registers. 12 We then combine the travel time data with the LEED. Travel times linked with the LEED allow us to calculate the commuting time of each worker to their actual place of work. Additionally we calculate the travel time based on the Euclidean distance between the 4 -digit postal code, assuming an average speed of 10 km/h. We then choose the lowest of the commuting time and the Euclidean distance travel time 1 3</p>

        <p>A third potential econometric challenge is the existence of possible measurement error within our Covid-19 data. Non-systematic measurement error would tend to reduce the precision of our estimates by increasing the standard errors on the estimated coefficients. Alternatively, if the measurement error is related to other omitted variables that are important for the pollution-Covid-19 relationship, or to its own values, this could be a cause for concern. Section 4 discusses the nature of our Covid-19 data and its potential deficiencies in more detail.A third potential econometric challenge is the existence of possible measurement error within our Covid-19 data.

The Regional Public Health Service Centres (known as GGD) from all across the country 15 provide RIVM with the Covid-19 data, which is then corrected for any inconsistencies before being released by RIVM. As stated by RIVM on their website, there is a slight delay between the day of hospitalization or death and the day on which the the number of cases is reported. 16 However, when the data is available RIVM does the necessary adjustment to the data retrospectively. This incident of slight delay is well-known for all countries. Again similar to the other countries, the number of Covid-19 cases is likely to be an underestimate of the true number of cases as not everybody in the country is tested. In addition, the disparity between the official Covid-19 death toll and calculations of excess deaths suggests that official statistics are under-reporting the true death toll, as seems to be happening world-wide. 17 Finally, it is important to note that all Covid-19 variables are coded by the residence of each individual rather than the address of the test centre or the hospital to which they are admitted.The Covid-19 data used in our analysis is obtained from RIVM.

These pollution concentrations are reported at the level of 1 × 1 km 2 grid-cells having been mod- elled using a wide range of sources and components in the Netherlands and in other European countries. Maps of the spatial distribution of pollution concentrations were calculated using the Operational Priority Substances dispersion model, which constructs the average annual concentrations of pollutants stemming from the dispersion, transport, chemical conversion and dispersion of emissions. The resultant concentrations are calibrated with the observations from the Dutch Air Quality Monitoring Network (Velders et al. 2020; Fischer et al. 2020). 18 To produce municipality level measures of pollution concentrations we use the median grid-cell concentrations within each municipality. In order to overcome any potential measurement bias due to annual fluctuations and to capture the long term exposure of residents 14 Our analysis does not control for meteorological variables such as temperature and humidity.

For example, Copernicus data is only available at 0.25 degree resolution, which would provide approximately 23 observations for the Netherlands.

        <p>There are a number of potential reasons why this might be so. First, Zorlu and Hartog (2012) show that ethnic groups in the Netherlands are more likely to work in manual occupations, which have been shown to increase the risk of exposure to Covid-19 due to the greater frequency of face-to-face contact amongst workers (Lewandowski 2020). 21 Second, ethnic minorities may be more likely to experience social deprivation, live in smaller housing and belong to larger households. As will be discussed below, we try to control for each of these factors by taking housing and household size conditions into account. Other risk factors may include the use of certain cultural practices (e.g., attending places of worship) or having a disposition for underlying health conditions. To control for any such effects we include the number of non-western migrants as a share of the population. Non-western migrants in the Netherlands are defined as the number of immigrants who are born in Africa, Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan and Indonesia), and Turkey.There are a number of potential reasons why this might be so.

To capture the potential impact of the Carnival we initially rely on province level fixed effects which capture the effects in North Brabant and Limburg and all other provinces individually. Furthermore, in sensitivity analysis we test a Carnival(municipality) measure by creating a dummy variable for the seven most populous municipalities (Den Bosch, Tilburg, Breda, Bergen op Zoom, Eindhoven, Helmond, Oss) within the borders of North Brabant and Limburg provinces. Alongside this, in order to account for the potential spread of the virus from the areas where the Carnival is widely celebrated, we also test a proximity to Carnival(municipality) measure that is the inverse distance from the centroid of these seven Carnival municipalities to the centroid of all municipalities in the Netherlands.While the majority of countries have disproportionately experienced Covid-19 infections in large metropolitan areas, the empirical findings so far are unclear about the role played by population density. 22 Epidemiological studies have argued that density per se is 20 See Kirby (2020) and Platt and Warwick (2020) https ://www.ifs.org.uk/inequ ality /chapt er/are-someethni c-group s-more-vulne rable -to-covid -19-than-other s. 21 https ://www.thegu ardia n.com/world /2020/may/11/manua l-worke rs-likel ier-to-die-from-covid -19-thanprofe ssion als. 22 See for example, 1 3 not important but rather it is the type of interaction between people that is important e.g. weddings, close family events and occasions when individuals come into close proximity with each other (Hu et al. 2013).

        <p>Focusing initially on the estimated pollution coefficients, we see that PM 2.5 concentrations have a positive and statistically significant relationship with Covid-19 cases, hospital admissions and deaths. In the case of NO 2 we find a positive and statistically significant association between Covid-19 cases and deaths, but this is not statistically significant for hospital admissions. Finally, for SO 2 we again discover a positive relationship with our dependent variables, but this is not statistically significant. Using a Fisher combination test across the specifications for the different dependent variables for each pollutant suggests that both PM 2.5 and NO 2 have a significant impact on Covid-19 outcomes in general, but SO 2 does not. 25 After calculating marginal effects, we find that a one unit increase in a municipality's PM 2.5 concentrations is associated with 9.4 more Covid-19 cases, 3.0 more hospital admissions, and 2.3 more deaths within that municipality. A one unit increase in NO 2 increases a municipality's Covid-19 cases by 2.2 and deaths by 0.35. To make these comparable, a one standard deviation increase in PM 2.5 and NO 2 concentrations increases Covid-19 cases by 12.7 and 8.5, respectively. The same one standard deviation in PM 2.5 and NO 2 concentra- tions increases Covid-19 deaths by 3.1 and 1.4, respectively. Table 3 summarises our pollution marginal effects from the estimations in which pollution is statistically significant.Focusing initially on the estimated pollution coefficients, we see that PM 2.5 concentrations have a positive and statistically significant relationship with Covid-19 cases, hospital admissions and deaths.

        <p>Turning to the other explanatory variables, and focusing on those that are generally statistically significant, we find that municipalities next to the German border have lower Covid-19 cases, hospital admissions, and deaths compared to other municipalities. We also find average household income to have a negative association with all three dependent variables, while average household size and the share of housing that is small both have positive relationships with our Covid-19 variables. Relative to the share of the working age population, the share of those under 18 has a negative association with Covid-19 while, as expected, the share over 70s has a positive association. Finally, smokers, the share of non-Western immigrants, and the total population of each municipality are associated with increased Covid-19 cases, hospital admissions, and deaths.Turning to the other explanatory variables, and focusing on those that are generally statistically significant, we find that municipalities next to the German border have lower Covid-19 cases, hospital admissions, and deaths compared to other municipalities.

        <p>Since we find the greatest statistical significance and largest marginal effects for PM 2.5 concentrations, for reasons of space we focus on this pollutant alone for the remainder of our analysis, although the results for other pollutants can be found in the "Appendix". Table 4 reports the results of the instrumental variable estimations using a control function approach, as outlined previously. In Table 4 we see that the estimated coefficients on PM 2.5 concentrations remain positive and statistically significant, with a similar magnitude to those in Table 2. It is notable that the first stage residuals are not statistically significant, thus failing to reject the null of exogeneity. One can also see that an F-test on our instruments in the first stage is highly statistically significant. Table 8 in the "Appendix" reports the first stage results, which use commuting time, commuting time squared, and lagged particulate matter concentrations from 1995 to 2000 as instruments. In sensitivity analysis we tested different combinations of these variables including lagged pollution alone, commuting time alone, and commuting time in linear form only. In each case the first stage residuals were not statistically significant in the second stage. Our results therefore provide reassurance that our estimations in Table 2 are not being unduly influenced by endogeneity arising from attenuation bias.Since we find the greatest statistical significance and largest marginal effects for PM 2.5 concentrations, for reasons of space we focus on this pollutant alone for the remainder of our analysis, although the results for other pollutants can be found in the "Appendix".

        <p>Table 5 reports the results of the spatial econometric estimations based on Eq. 2 in which we include a spatially lagged dependent variable and spatial errors using three 1 3 different spatial weight matrices (50 km, 100 km, no cut-off). Table 5 displays the estimated coefficients on PM 2.5 concentrations for the three dependent variables. The three models with differing weight matrices are presented. For each we also report the spatial error and spatial lag coefficients, and , respectively. Table 5 indicates that PM 2.5 concentrations continue to have a positive relationship with all three of the Covid-19 dependant variables, for all three of the spatial weight matrices. 26 Where the estimated coefficients on PM 2.5 are not labelled as being statistically significant at 5% levels, they are significant at 10% levels. The introduction of the spatially lagged dependent variable into Eq. 2 changes the interpretation of our estimated coefficients. PM 2.5 concentrations in municipality i continue to affect the conditional mean of Covid-19 in that municipality but now that change in Covid-19 potentially changes the conditional mean of Covid-19 in other nearby municipalities (depending on our weight matrix). Furthermore, the change in Covid-19 in those nearby municipalities affects the conditional mean of Covid-19 in their neighbouring municipalities and so on. PM 2.5 concentrations therefore now have a direct effect on Covid-19 in their own municipality plus an indirect effect on Covid-19 in other municipalities.Table 5 reports the results of the spatial econometric estimations based on Eq. 2 in which we include a spatially lagged dependent variable and spatial errors using three 1 3 different spatial weight matrices (50 km, 100 km, no cut-off).

        <p>If we take the example of our estimate of Covid-19 Cases using a weight matrix with a 50 km cut-off, which reports an estimated coefficient on PM 2.5 concentrations of 20.88, we can calculate the marginal effect to consist of a direct effect of 21.0, an indirect effect of -5.9, and a total effect of 15.1. This implies that a 1 unit change in PM 2.5 concentrations is associated with an increase in Covid-19 cases of 15.1. However, it is notable that the estimates of both and from this model are not statistically significant, implying that spatial spillovers are not unduly influencing our results, either through the error term or through the dependent variable. Indeed, if we look at the estimates of and from the other models in Table 5 we see that the majority are not statistically significant. This is particularly true of the spatial error coefficient . So, while we find limited evidence of statistically significant spatial spillovers, Table 5 at least confirms that our positive and statistically significant association between Covid-19 and PM 2.5 concentrations is robust to the inclusion of such spillovers.If we take the example of our estimate of Covid-19 Cases using a weight matrix with a 50 km cut-off, which reports an estimated coefficient on PM 2.5 concentrations of 20.88, we can calculate the marginal effect to consist of a direct effect of 21.0, an indirect effect of -5.9, and a total effect of 15.1.

        <p>Finally, Tables 6 and7 report some additional sensitivity estimations. In columns (1)-(3) of Table 6, rather than relying only on province dummies to control for the effect of the carnival, we include a municipality-level dummy of the seven most populous municipalities within North Brabant and Limburg provinces. In addition, we include a measure of the proximity of each municipality to the centroid of these seven combined municipalities. Table 6 indicates that these municipality-level carnival variables are not statistically significant, nor do they have the expected signs. Furthermore, the coefficients on PM 2.5 concentrations remain unaffected by their inclusion in terms of magnitude, sign, or significance. 27 As mentioned earlier, the effect of urban density on the spread of Covid-19 has been an ongoing discussion with a number of studies providing mixed and inconclusive evidence. To explore this further, columns (4)-( 6) in Table 6 report estimations in which we omitted from our analysis the major urban areas of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Utrecht and The Hague in case, given their high levels of concentration, they are unduly influencing our results. The sign, significance and magnitude of our estimated coefficients on pollution are consistent with our previous results (in columns (1), ( 4) and (7) from Table 2).Finally, Tables 6 and7 report some additional sensitivity estimations.

        <p>Finally, in columns ( 1)-( 3) of Table 7 we replace our 5 year average of PM 2.5 with a 10 year average. As can be seen, all three coefficients on PM 2.5 remain positive, statistically significant and of almost identical magnitude to those in Table 2. This suggests that our results are not at all sensitive to precisely how we measure long term pollution exposure. In columns (4)-( 6) of Table 7 we return to 5 year pollution averages but include all three pollutants together in each estimation. The 3 pollutants are highly correlated with the highest correlation of 0.79 between PM 2.5 and NO 2 . This raises question marks over the precision with which the coefficients on these pollutants are estimated but, nevertheless, we see that when all 3 pollutants are included together, PM 2.5 generally remains statistically significant while the other pollutants are not significant.28Finally, in columns ( 1)-( 3) of Table 7 we replace our 5 year average of PM 2.5 with a 10 year average.

        <p>This paper has contributed to the nascent literature examining the link between poor air quality and Covid-19. We examine data for 355 Dutch municipalities to identify the relationship between concentrations of PM 2.5 , NO 2 and SO 2 and Covid-19 cases, hospital admissions and deaths. In contrast to much of the previous literature we are able to control for a wide range of potential confounding effects and, by examining Covid-19 data between February and June 2020, are able to examine almost the full wave of the epidemic within the Netherlands. We find compelling evidence of a statistically significant positive relationship between air pollution and Covid-19 cases, hospital admissions and deaths. This relationship is particularly evident for concentrations of PM 2.5 and to a lesser extent NO 2 and persists after controlling for explanatory variables capturing income, demography, social and physical proximity, employment/education, health and spatial factors. The relationship withstands a number of sensitivity and robustness exercises including instrumenting pollution to mitigate some forms of potential endogeneity and modelling spatial spillovers using spatial econometric techniques.This paper has contributed to the nascent literature examining the link between poor air quality and Covid-19.

        <p>Our results indicate that, on average, and other things being equal, a municipality with 1 μg/m 3 more PM 2.5 concentrations than another will have between 9.4 and 15.1 more Covid- 19 cases, depending on our model. It will also have between 2.9 and 4.4 more Covid-19 hospital admissions and between 2.2 and 2.8 more Covid-19 deaths. The only comparable study to our own is provided by Wu et al. (2020) who examine Covid-19 deaths in the US. They find that a 1 μg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 is associated with an 8% increase in the Covid-19 death rate. Since the mean number of deaths in our sample is 16.86, our estimated increases of between 2.2 and 2.8 are equivalent to increases of between 13.0% and 16.6%, which are clearly larger in magnitude than those of Wu et al. (2020). It is notable that while we find PM 2.5 and, to a lesser extent, NO 2 to be associated with Covid- 19 outcomes, the same is not true of SO 2 concentrations. The most likely explanation for this difference is that, unlike PM 2.5 and NO 2 , SO 2 concentrations have fallen dramatically in recent years. For instance, SO 2 concentrations from regional background monitoring stations have decreased from 5 to 15 μg/m 3 to an average of 1 μg/m 3 since 1990.29 Concentrations of PM 2.5 and NO 2 have not experienced similar declines. Furthermore, the EU limit value for SO 2 has not been exceeded anywhere in the Netherlands since 1998. Again, the same is not true of PM 2.5 and NO 2 concentrations. If SO 2 concentrations are not sufficiently high to be causing adverse health impacts then they would appear to be less likely to contribute to Covid-19 outcomes.Our results indicate that, on average, and other things being equal, a municipality with 1 μg/m 3 more PM 2.5 concentrations than another will have between 9.4 and 15.1 more Covid- 19 cases, depending on our model.

        <p>While our findings remain correlative rather than causal, there are plausible mechanisms through which air pollution could be affecting Covid-19 outcomes. Given the existing evidence of a link between exposure to air pollution and a persistent inflammatory response within the respiratory tract (Abbey et al. 1999; De Weerdt et al. 2020; Conticini et al. 2020), it is possible that individuals who have experienced long term pollution exposure will face a higher risk of hospitalisation and death upon contracting Covid-19. Furthermore, since it has also been claimed that exposure to pollution can increase the risk of infection by viruses that target the respiratory tract (Travaglio et al. 2020; Conticini et al. 2020), and that particulate matter might actually carry the Covid-19 virus (Setti et al. 2020), it is also feasible that pollution exposure could increase the number of actual Covid-19 cases.While our findings remain correlative rather than causal, there are plausible mechanisms through which air pollution could be affecting Covid-19 outcomes.

        <p>Two clear policy implications arise from our analysis. First, the impact of poor air quality on Covid-19 morbidity and mortality represents a considerable and unexpected additional cost from air pollution. Our results would therefore suggest that more stringent air pollution regulation may be required, even in a relatively well-regulated nation such as the Netherlands. Second, our findings should prove useful to public health officials by signaling where subsequent waves of Covid-19, or indeed future pandemics of respiratory disease, might hit hardest. This could be particularly important in countries where pollution sources don't correlate well with major metropolitan areas. If, for instance, livestock production is a major source of emissions, as may be the case in some parts of the Netherlands, then advance warning may prove particularly beneficial for rural areas where healthcare infrastructure and coordination may be less developed.Two clear policy implications arise from our analysis.

        <p>We believe the statistical relationships we have observed between PM 2.5 concentrations and Covid-19 data are robust. Furthermore, given the established literature linking poor air quality with respiratory disease, the existence of a similar link between poor air quality and Covid-19 outcomes is plausible. By focusing on the Netherlands we can also be confident that the correlations we find between PM 2.5 and Covid-19 outcomes are not simply a result of Covid-19 cases being clustered in large cities where pollution may be higher, as may be the case in Northern Italy for instance. As we have noted, Covid-19 hotspots in the Netherlands were in relatively rural regions rather than the big cities. Nevertheless, a degree of caution is needed. We do not claim to have found a causal relationship between pollution and Covid-19 outcomes. Instead, we have found correlations that persist even when a wide range of control variables are included and a number of different estimation methods are utilised. Until detailed individual-level data is available providing information on Covid-19 and a wide range of other individual characteristics the statistical evidence of a link between air quality and Covid-19 outcomes will remain suggestive rather than conclusive.We believe the statistical relationships we have observed between PM 2.5 concentrations and Covid-19 data are robust.

        <p>Unreported sensitivity analyses test alternative measures of many of our explanatory variables. For instance, we replaced population density with the share of urban land, average household income with household income of the poorest 10%, the share of workers in elementary occupations with the share of workers in routine task-intensive occupations and others. Results were generally similar and, importantly, the sign, significance and magnitude of the pollution coefficients were not at all sensitive to the choice of explanatory variables.Unreported sensitivity analyses test alternative measures of many of our explanatory variables.
