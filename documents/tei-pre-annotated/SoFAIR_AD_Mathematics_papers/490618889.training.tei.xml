The checklist included recommendations for engineering controls (e.g., enhancing ventilation, installing physical barriers between workers on the production line and in cafeterias), administrative controls (e.g., cohorting of consistent work teams, education, environmental cleaning and disinfection policies), and personal protective equipment. Site visit personnel completed the checklist and gathered information on the workforce (e.g., number of employees, employee demographics) and dates of initiating a universal mask policy, installing physical barriers, or both. For each facility, the dates of initiating a universal mask policy and completing physical barrier installation were collated and used in the analyses.</p>

Facilities consisted cessing plants. The number of workers employed at facility, but they were generally located on the production line and at cafeteria tables; barriers consisted of pipes, or plastic sheeting. Although the site visit teams recommended use of surgical masks, national shortages of personal protective equipment early in the pandemic led to the adoption of different masking requirements; some facilities allowed cloth masks, and other facilities acquired and provided surgical masks to workers. Of &gt; initiated a universal mask policy and installed physical policies but no physical barriers in place at the time of technical assistance and whether physical barriers were installed later is unknown.</p>

The meat processing industry in Nebraska employs 6 in a multistate analysis of meat processing facili-4). Cases in meat processing facilities have far-reaching effects, potentially fueling outbreaks within surrounding communities where workers and workers' families comprise a substantial proportion of area residents. In addition, plants are often located in rural communities with limited infrastructure and resources to respond to outbreaks. In Nebraska, the meat processing facilities (10).</p>

Plant or corporate management can work to address these disparities among their worker populations by engaging with language and culture experts to ensure appropriate and effective communication and educational materials (e.g., videos, infographics) by providing materials in all languages spoken by workers and partnering with respected local community leaders (e.g., religious and spiritual leaders, elders) and community organizations to educate and disseminate information to workers. remain asymptomatic is uncertain, although some 14 16). The among Nebraska meat processing workers was Nebraska meat processing facilities completed mass testing events during the study period, it is likely that many asymptomatic cases went undetected and ing event at 1 Nebraska facility found that nearly one no symptoms (17 case-patients described in this report suggest detectable levels of virus in these persons and therefore transmission potential (18 20) at a median of 3 days before onset. Mass and routine testing enables iden-fections, leading to swifter isolation, fewer days of tine, and testing of close contacts. As detailed in this report, identifying presymptomatic cases shortened the duration from symptom onset to investigation by routine testing programs, with frequency of testing informed by both local community transmission tion meat processing plants to identify cases early and stem potential outbreaks.</p>
        <p>Risk mitigation strategies based on symptoms, such as active screening protocols and paid sick leave policies, are limited by asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission and emphasize the importance of - The IPC challenges inherent in meat processing facilities cannot be addressed with only 1 or 2 measures; multilayered interventions are more effective than any single measure (29). In addition to IPC-focused strategies to reduce transmission within the facility, such as reducing density, engineering controls, physical distancing, active screening, environmental cleaning and disinfection, and masking, workforce policies ensuring social protections such as paid sick tools to prevent the disease from entering the workfaced by the industry (e.g., high density of workers, duration of shifts, indoor environment, crowded cafeterias where masks are removed), it is also possible that no combination of interventions will be completely effective at reducing transmission in meat processing facilities, particularly when high rates of local community transmission exist. Facilities that did not ing mask policies and physical barriers may not have incorporated other strategies to the same degree as Alternatively, some facilities we assessed might have initiated key interventions well before cases among their workers were diagnosed, causing interventions to appear less effective in this study.</p>
        <p>A limitation of this study is that, although we attempted to distinguish the effectiveness of a universal mask policy from that of physical barrier installation, only 3 facilities had enough cases between the initiation of the 2 interventions to evaluate the separate direct effects of the measures. Moreover, when it became apparent in mid-April that meat processing facilities were particularly vulnerable to and being porate IPC strategies within a short timeline and re-quested simultaneous technical assistance from our days after a universal mask policy or physical barrier installation was begun. Our site visits and incorporation of additional IPC measures beyond physical barriers and masking might have contributed to reduced ly separate out whether transmission to case-patients occurred in the workplace or in the community and therefore couldn't determine the exact effect risk mitigation measures had on incidence compared with represented almost 1 in 5 cases in Nebraska during braska from the beginning of the pandemic through 30 that mitigation measures had a more rapid effect on transmission trends.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, we present a snapshot of the effacilities in Nebraska. Nearly 1 in 5 Nebraska meat cases unparalleled in any other worker population. Many of the nationwide trends that have become apparent during this pandemic applied here, namely high attack rates among workers in the meat processing industry, a disproportionately high risk of adverse outcomes among ethnic and racial minority groups and men, and the effectiveness of IPC interventions at reducing person-to-person transmission. Increased multilayered IPC strategies, rapid contact tracing, and accessible testing are critical to identifying asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases and inenduring threat to the meat processing industry and its workers for the foreseeable future. Facilities must adopt and sustain multiple interventions to prevent, control, and rapidly identify transmission within facilities to protect this worker population.</p>
