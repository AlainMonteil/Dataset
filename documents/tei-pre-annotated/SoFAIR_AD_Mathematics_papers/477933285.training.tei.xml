        <p>There is a consensus that mass vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 will ultimately end the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is not clear when and which control measures can be relaxed during the rollout of vaccination programmes. We investigate relaxation scenarios using an age-structured transmission model that has been fitted to age-specific seroprevalence data, hospital admissions, and projected vaccination coverage for Portugal. Our analyses suggest that the pressing need to restart socioeconomic activities could lead to new pandemic waves, and that substantial control efforts prove necessary throughout 2021. Using knowledge on control measures introduced in 2020, we anticipate that relaxing measures completely or to the extent as in autumn 2020 could launch a wave starting in April 2021. Additional waves could be prevented altogether if measures are relaxed as in summer 2020 or in a step-wise manner throughout 2021. We discuss at which point the control of COVID-19 would be achieved for each scenario.There is a consensus that mass vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 will ultimately end the COVID-19 pandemic.

        <p>ass vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 started in Europe in late 2020 and early 2021 1 , and brings hope that the COVID-19 pandemic can be brought to an end in 2021. Even though progress towards this goal seems to be on the right track 2 , many governments in Europe continue to limit socioeconomic activities to control the pandemic. Despite elaborate national vaccination schedules, it is unclear when and which control measures can be relaxed and at which point the control of the pandemic will be achieved during the vaccination programme. Understanding of how relaxation policies might affect the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 is furthermore hampered by the emergence of novel variants 3,4 that have a selective advantage, such as increased transmissibility [5][6][7][8] or the ability to reduce rapid neutralization by the host 9 . For example, the current restrictions in Europe 10 are in part caused by a more transmissible [5][6][7][8] and potentially more pathogenic 11,12 B.1.1.7 variant that originated in the UK and is quickly gaining dominance in other countries, including Portugal 8,13,14 .ass vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 started in Europe in late 2020 and early 2021 1 , and brings hope that the COVID-19 pandemic can be brought to an end in 2021.

        <p>The vaccines that have been approved in Europe 15 show consistently high efficacy against severe disease, hospitalization and death in trials [16][17][18] and show equally high effectiveness in real-world settings [19][20][21][22][23] . Multiple studies are under way to establish infection-blocking properties of these vaccines. Analyses of the national vaccination programme in Israel indicate that the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections could be as high as 94% 22 , as announced recently by the Israel Ministry of Health, Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE. The recent Danish cohort study on long-term care facility residents and healthcare workers further suggests that the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine using a positive PCR test as outcome measure is 64% and 90% beyond seven days of second dose in the two groups, respectively 20 . Similar results were found in a study among healthcare workers in England where the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against symptomatic and asymptomatic infection was 86% seven days after two doses 23 . Based on the data from Israel, the effectiveness of the same vaccine against infection with SARS-CoV-2 was shown to be 51% 13-24 days after one dose 21 . Finally, in a study by Lipsitch and Kahn 24 , the lower bound for the efficacy against transmission for one dose of Moderna vaccine was estimated at 61%, and could possibly be considerably higher, especially after two doses.The vaccines that have been approved in Europe 15 show consistently high efficacy against severe disease, hospitalization and death in trials [16][17][18] and show equally high effectiveness in real-world settings [19][20][21][22][23] .

        <p>The consequences of relaxing control measures such as physical distancing, school closure, mask-wearing, test-and-trace and isolation, will depend on several factors, including the properties of vaccines deployed in a given country, specifics of the vaccination schedule, and speed of vaccine rollout, but also the past epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 that determines which fraction of the population is protected by natural infection 25,26 . All these factors are clearly country-dependent and will play a major role in how the pandemic will unfold under different relaxation scenarios [27][28][29][30] and how quickly the full control of COVID-19 will be gained in specific countries throughout 2021 and possibly beyond. To make a few distinctive examples, we recall Israel which has the highest vaccination rate worldwide so that, on average, every person has received at least one vaccine dose by mid-March 2021 1 and Manaus in Brazil, where the levels of protection by natural infection close to the theoretical herd immunity threshold were achieved prior to the start of mass vaccination 31 .The consequences of relaxing control measures such as physical distancing, school closure, mask-wearing, test-and-trace and isolation, will depend on several factors, including the properties of vaccines deployed in a given country, specifics of the vaccination schedule, and speed of vaccine rollout, but also the past epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 that determines which fraction of the population is protected by natural infection 25,26 .

        <p>An extensive body of literature addresses the challenges of realtime modeling the COVID-19 pandemic 32 .

Several modeling studies provided support for the development of COVID-19 vaccines and early planning of vaccination scenarios and rollouts [45][46][47][48][49] . These models, however, assumed that a large proportion of the population is vaccinated instantaneously or did not focus on relaxation strategies.

        <p>The present study makes a contribution towards better understanding of when and which control measures can be relaxed as mass vaccination programmes progress in 2021. We take Portugal as a case study where good quality data for model parameterization are available but, apart from efforts of genomic surveillance 51 and a recent study on the pre-vaccination dynamics of COVID-19 52 , there are few dedicated COVID-19 modeling studies for informing policymaking in this country 53 . Using an age-structured transmission model that has been fitted in a Bayesian framework to the data from various sources (agespecific hospitalizations and seroprevalence, social contact and demographic data, national vaccination plan and vaccine rollout data etc.), we investigate future pandemic trajectories under several alternative relaxation scenarios throughout 2021. Among the explored strategies are (i) lifting measures to the same extent as in summer 2020 and (ii) later on in autumn 2020, (iii) the complete lifting of measures, and (iv) combinations of (i), (ii) and (iii). We evaluate the impact of each scenario on the epidemic dynamics as quantified by projected hospital admissions, the time-dependent effective reproduction number, population immunization level due to natural infection and vaccination, and the timing of reaching control of COVID-19 in Portugal. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the post-pandemic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.The present study makes a contribution towards better understanding of when and which control measures can be relaxed as mass vaccination programmes progress in 2021.

        <p>Model calibration. The model was fitted to age-stratified COVID-19 hospitalization data in the period from 26 February 2020 till 15 January 2021 and cross-sectional age-stratified SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence data assessed from 21 May 2020 till 8 July 2020. The model reproduces well the age-specific hospital admissions (Fig. 1) featuring (i) the first pandemic wave (March-April 2020), (ii) relatively low epidemic activity (May-August 2020), (iii) the second pandemic wave (Septembermid-December 2020), (iv) the third wave that started in mid-December 2020 and was still ongoing on 15 January 2021 54 . The estimated hospitalization rates increase with age from 0.12 (95% CrI 0.07-0.23) per year for children under 5 years of age to 14.24 (95% CrI 9.91-21.23) per year for persons above 80 years (Supplementary Fig. 1).

        <p>The model also reproduces well the age-specific and total seroprevalence in the population (Fig. 2). The estimated agespecific seroprevalence ranged between 1.77% (95% CrI 0.98-2.91%) for 1-10 years old children to 4.61% (95% CrI 3.47-5.91%) for 20-40 years old adults (Fig. 2a).

        <p>Time-varying contact patterns and effective reproduction number. We estimated how age-specific contact rates in the population changed due to control measures as the pandemic developed. These contact rates denote the average number of transmission-relevant contacts per day a person in a given age category has with persons in other age categories. We further calculated the time-dependent effective reproduction number, R e (t), defined as the average number of secondary infections caused by one infectious individual in the population with agespecific contact patterns and age-specific seroprevalence at time t. R e (t) &lt; 1 signifies the control of the pandemic with possibly some of control measures in place. The full control of COVID-19 is achieved when R e (t) &lt; 1 and the contact rates in the population are restored to the pre-pandemic level.Time-varying contact patterns and effective reproduction number.

        <p>Our findings are summarized in Fig. 3, where we show the total daily hospitalizations (Fig. 3a), the average (over all ages) number of daily contacts in the population (Fig. 3b) and R e (t) (Fig. 3c) evaluated bi-weekly in the period from 26 February 2020 till 15 January 2021. The green vertical lines indicate the estimated mid-point transitions in the age-specific contact rates (see Methods). The pre-pandemic average number of daily contacts was 12.6. The estimated basic reproduction number (in the absence of control measures and with zero seroprevalence) was 2.20 (95% CrI 1.97-2.56). The control measures introduced during the first wave in spring 2020 reduced the number of contacts to 4.2 (95% CrI 3.3-5.0) and R e to 0.69 (95% CrI 0.64-0.75). After some of these measures were lifted, the number of contacts increased to 5.9 (95% CrI 5. 1-6.6) and R e increased to almost 1 and stayed nearly constant throughout summer 2020. At the start of the second wave in autumn 2020 that followed the opening of schools and the associated changes in the contact patterns of the rest of the population, the average number of contacts further increased to about 7.6 (95% CrI 6.7-8.3) and R e to 1.24 (95% CrI 1.21-1.28). The reinforcement of measures during the second wave could only reduce R e to 0.89 (95% CrI 0.86-0.99) as The gray shaded regions correspond to 95% Bayesian prediction intervals based on 2000 parameter samples from the posterior distribution. Hospital admissions were estimated for 10 age groups (see Methods).

        <p>Vaccination rollout. We implemented the rollout of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 as set out prior to the start of the vaccination campaign by the Directorate-General of Healtha division of Portuguese Ministry of Health concerned with public health (Table 1) 57 . The mass vaccination started on 27 December 2020, is planned to proceed in three phases that will cover the whole population of Portugal by 31 December 2021. In the model results presented in the main text, we made several simplifying assumptions regarding vaccination, i.e., 1) at most 90% of each age group will be vaccinated (as supported by the survey conducted between 23 January and 5 February 2021 on the willingness to get vaccinated where the percentage of the Portuguese residents who want to get vaccinated exceeds 95% 58 ) except for persons under 20 years of age (as supported by the current guidelines on the ineligibility for vaccination of persons under 18 years of age); 2) the distributed vaccine is by BioNTech/Pfizer brand (as supported by the recent ECDC vaccination data for Portugal where 96% of vaccine doses distributed up until February 21, 2021 are by BioNTech/Pfizer); 3) vaccination is modeled as a single event that immediately confers protection equivalent to two vaccine doses; 4) we considered an infection-blocking vaccine and formulated optimistic assumptions for vaccine efficacies in reducing infection, disease and severe disease; 5) there is no waning of protection against (re-)infection after natural infection and vaccination. More details of the vaccination model are given in Methods. In the sensitivity analyses, we explored the impact on hospitalizations of timings of different relaxation steps, pessimistic assumptions for vaccine efficacies, infectivity of breakthrough cases in vaccinated persons, behavior compensation post-vaccination and the maximum age-specific coverage decreasing with age.Vaccination rollout.

        <p>We used the rollout schedule (Table 1) and data (Fig. 4a) on the age distribution of morbidities among the Portuguese residents and age distribution of prioritized vaccination categories (e.g., healthcare workers, long-term care facilities staff and residents etc.) to calculate age-specific vaccination rates (number of persons in a given age group vaccinated per day) as the vaccination programme progresses (Fig. 4b; see Supplementary Fig. 3 for detailed information). The vaccination rate refers to vaccination with two vaccine doses. The maximum vaccination coverage of 90% is projected to be reached in the following order (Fig. 5a): 80+ (29 June 2021), [60,80) 4 for absolute numbers of vaccinated persons). The total coverage in the population will increase to 9%/38%/73% (maximum coverage) by 1 May/1 August/16 November 2021 (Fig. 4b). The vaccination rollout data based on fully vaccinated persons for Portugal 1 agree well with these projections.We used the rollout schedule (Table 1) and data (Fig. 4a) on the age distribution of morbidities among the Portuguese residents and age distribution of prioritized vaccination categories (e.g., healthcare workers, long-term care facilities staff and residents etc.) to calculate age-specific vaccination rates (number of persons in a given age group vaccinated per day) as the vaccination programme progresses (Fig. 4b; see Supplementary Fig. 3 for detailed information).

        <p>Scenarios for relaxation of control measures. To account for the epidemiological situation in Portugal between mid-January and mid-March 2021 54 , we modeled the third wave of hospitalizations that was curbed by the substantial reinforcement of measures similar to those implemented during the first wave in spring 2020. We also modeled an increase in the transmisibility of the virus due to the rapid spread of B.1.1.7. variant in Portugal. The situation in mid-March 2021 is then described by the average number of daily contacts of 4.2, R e of 0.67 and the circulating variant that is 50% more transmissible [5][6][7] than the original variant that was dominant in Portugal until December 2020.Scenarios for relaxation of control measures.

        <p>Starting from this situation, we generated scenarios for relaxation of control measures as follows (Fig. 6): Scenario 1) lifting all measures so that contact rates in the population return to the pre-pandemic level (average rate of 12.6 contacts/day); Scenario 2) partial lifting of measures that increases contact rates to the level of September-October 2020 (7.6 contacts/day); Scenario 3) partial lifting of measures that increases contact rates to the level of June-August 2020 (5.9 contacts/day). In accordance with the plan of the Portuguese government to alleviate some of the current measures in spring 2021 and to make the scenarios comparable, we used the same mid-point (1 April 2021) and the same speed of transition between the contact levels (10 days).Starting from this situation, we generated scenarios for relaxation of control measures as follows (Fig. 6): Scenario 1) lifting all measures so that contact rates in the population return to the pre-pandemic level (average rate of 12.6 contacts/day); Scenario 2) partial lifting of measures that increases contact rates to the level of September-October 2020 (7.6 contacts/day); Scenario 3) partial lifting of measures that increases contact rates to the level of June-August 2020 (5.9 contacts/day).

        <p>The comparative analysis of Scenarios 1, 2, and 3 is shown in Fig. 6. The model predicts that lifting all measures (Scenario 1; Fig. 6a-d) launches a fourth wave that is significantly larger than the previous waves, resulting in 58,226 cumulative hospitalizations between 1 April 2021 and 1 January 2022 (Fig. 6a). R e increases sharply from 0.67 on 23 March 2021 to 2.03 two weeks later (Fig. 6c) which is very close to the basic reproduction number of 2.20 at the start of the pandemic. The full control over COVID-19 is reached on 18 May 2021 when R e drops below 1 and the contact rates are the pre-pandemic level (Fig. 6b). At this threshold, 60% of the population acquired protection after natural infection and only 10% are protected after vaccination (Fig. 6d). Relaxing measures according to Scenario 2 (Fig. 6e-h) initiates a new pandemic wave too, albeit smaller in magnitude than Scenario 1 (8975 hospitalizations between 1 April 2021 and 1 January 2022; Fig. 6e). In this case, R e becomes smaller than 1 on 29 June 2021 (Fig. 6g) but the measures have to be kept in place (Fig. 6f) to control the spread. The increase of contact rates to the level of June-August 2020 (Scenario 3; Fig. 6i-l), however, does not lead to a significant rise in hospitalizations (1450 hospitalizations between 1 April and 1 January 2022; Fig. 6i) because R e a The Portuguese vaccination plan as set out prior to the start of the vaccination campaign assumes that all persons in the population will be vaccinated with a two-dose vaccine schedule. In the model, the maximum vaccination coverage in any age group is 90%. b According to the current guidelines, persons under 18 years old are not eligible for vaccination. In the model, we assumed that the age group of 0-20 years old is not vaccinated. 1). The age-specific vaccination rates are given in Supplementary Fig. 3.The comparative analysis of Scenarios 1, 2, and 3 is shown in Fig. 6. The model predicts that lifting all measures (Scenario 1; Fig. 6a-d) launches a fourth wave that is significantly larger than the previous waves, resulting in 58,226 cumulative hospitalizations between 1 April 2021 and 1 January 2022 (Fig. 6a). R e increases sharply from 0.67 on 23 March 2021 to 2.03 two weeks later (Fig. 6c) which is very close to the basic reproduction number of 2.20 at the start of the pandemic. The full control over COVID-19 is reached on 18 May 2021 when R e drops below 1 and the contact rates are the pre-pandemic level (Fig. 6b). At this threshold, 60% of the population acquired protection after natural infection and only 10% are protected after vaccination (Fig. 6d). Relaxing measures according to Scenario 2 (Fig. 6e-h) initiates a new pandemic wave too, albeit smaller in magnitude than Scenario 1 (8975 hospitalizations between 1 April 2021 and 1 January 2022; Fig. 6e).

        <p>In addition, we explored Scenario 4 (Fig. 7) where measures are relaxed in a step-wise manner so that contact rates first rise to the level of June-August 2020 (Step 1, Scenario 3), then to the level of September-October 2020 (Step 2, Scenario 2) and, finally, to the pre-pandemic level (Step 3, Scenario 1) (Fig. 7b). The mid-points of transitions were 1 April, 1 June and 1 October 2021 (blue vertical lines in Fig. 7) and the relaxation speed of 10 days was 1). The coverages for ages [20,30), [30,40), and [40,50) are equal (see Supplementary Fig. 4 for the absolute numbers of vaccinated persons). The coverage for ages [0,20) is zero.

        <p>used for all transitions. In this scenario, additional waves can be prevented altogether and hospitalizations stay at the level comparable to that in summer 2020 when the epidemic activity was low (Fig. 7a). The number of hospitalizations in Scenario 4 is 2.2 times larger than in Scenario 3 (3194 vs 1450 from 1 April 2021 till 1 January 2022) and 2.8 times smaller than in Scenario 2 (3194 vs 8975 in the same time period) but the situation would still seem manageable for the healthcare system because the model does not predict sharp increases in hospital admissions. Most importantly, unlike in Scenarios 2 and 3 where contact rates stay reduced after 1 April 2021, the return to pre-pandemic contact patterns in Scenario 4 is gradual and the complete lifting of measures occurs on 1 October 2021 which would have important socio-economic consequences. Interestingly, Step 2 (1 June) and Step 3 (1 October) increase R e above 1 (Fig. 7c) leading to waves of infections (Supplementary Fig. 5) but a large increase in hospitalizations is not observed because a substantial proportion of the vulnerable population has been vaccinated (Fig. 5). The full control of the pandemic (R e (t) &lt; 1 and prepandemic contact rates) is reached on 8 February 2022 (Fig. 7c) when 36% of the population are protected after natural infection, 48% after vaccination, and 17% stay unprotected (Fig. 7d).

        <p>We would like to stress that for demonstration purposes the timings of Steps 2 and 3 in Scenario 4 have been intentionally chosen so that the epidemic activity (i.e., the number of hospital admissions) in 2021 is similar to that in summer 2020. The premature relaxation of measures can still lead to new waves of hospitalizations. We demonstrate this in Supplementary Fig. 6 where Step 3 occurs on 1 August instead of 1 October 2021. In this case, a large outbreak is observed from August till December 2021 and the total number of hospitalizations is 3 times larger (9650 vs 3194 from 1 April 2021 till 1 January 2022) than if measures were completely lifted on 1 October 2021.We would like to stress that for demonstration purposes the timings of Steps 2 and 3 in Scenario 4 have been intentionally chosen so that the epidemic activity (i.e., the number of hospital admissions) in 2021 is similar to that in summer 2020.

        <p>Similarly, the results presented for all scenarios are the most optimistic in terms of projected hospitalizations and get worse for a pessimistic set of vaccine efficacies. For Scenario 4 which is probably the most realistic scenario for the future relaxation of measures, the model predicts a new pandemic wave that continues until summer 2022 resulting in a 7.3-fold increase in hospitalizations (30,028 vs 4088 admissions between 1 April 2021 and 24 June 2022) for pessimistic assumptions about vaccine efficacies (Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 2).Similarly, the results presented for all scenarios are the most optimistic in terms of projected hospitalizations and get worse for a pessimistic set of vaccine efficacies.

        <p>We have also explored the impact on hospitalizations of behavior compensation post-vaccination by which we imply that individuals return to pre-pandemic contact rates immediately upon getting vaccinated (Supplementary Figs. 7,8 and Supplementary Table 2). Both in the presence and in the absence of behavior compensation in Scenario 4, the number of breakthrough cases after vaccination is relatively small (about 5-6% of the total cumulative cases) for optimistic vaccine efficacies and is comparable to the number of infections in the unvaccinated population (about 42-46% of the total infections) for pessimistic vaccine efficacies (Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 2). Overall, the change in behavior of vaccinated persons would have relatively little impact on cumulative hospital admissions, i.e., an increase of 5% from 4088 to 4301 for optimistic vaccine efficacies and an increase of 4% from 30,028 to 31,344 for pessimistic vaccine efficacies (Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 2). Therefore, the model projections for hospital admissions depend more strongly on our assumptions regarding pessimistic and optimistic vaccine efficacies (i.e., several fold increase in hospitalizations for the range explored) and to a smaller extent on the assumptions regarding behavioral changes in the vaccinated population (i.e., few percent increase in hospitalizations for the range explored). These findings are sensitive to the infectivity of breakthrough cases in vaccinated persons (Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Table 6). In Fig. 7 Sequential relaxation of control measures. This scenario consists of sequential relaxation of measures so that the contact rates increase, in sequence, to the level of June-August 2020, of September-October 2020 and the pre-pandemic level.

        <p>particular, for a vaccine that is highly effective in reducing susceptibility (94% under our optimistic assumptions), the impact of infectivity of vaccinated persons on hospitalizations is small (a 15% decrease from 4088 to 3492 admissions in a hypothetical best-case scenario of zero infectivity in Scenario 4; Supplementary Table 6). For a vaccine with a low efficacy in reducing susceptibility (55% under our pessimistic assumptions), the impact on hospitalizations is much larger (a 77% decrease from 30,038 to 6410 admissions for the same scenario; Supplementary Table 6).particular, for a vaccine that is highly effective in reducing susceptibility (94% under our optimistic assumptions), the impact of infectivity of vaccinated persons on hospitalizations is small (a 15% decrease from 4088 to 3492 admissions in a hypothetical best-case scenario of zero infectivity in Scenario 4; Supplementary Table 6).

        <p>Finally, our results are also dependent on the assumed maximum coverage of 90% in all age groups. In reality, as vaccination coverage in older age groups will start to saturate, younger people might have lower intent to get vaccinated. The sensitivity analyses for the maximum coverage decreasing with age (90% in 80+, 85% in [50,80), 75% in [20,50) and 0% in [0, 20) years old; Supplementary Figs. 8 and9) show that the cumulative median number of hospitalizations from 1 April 2021 till 1 January 2022 for Scenarios 1, 2 and 3 would be almost equal to the situation when the maximum vaccination coverage is independent of age and very high (Figs. 5 and6). For Scenario 4, the number of hospitalizations would be 8% higher than in Fig. 6. The reason for this is that in Scenario 1 the pandemic unfolds much faster than vaccination is rolled out. In Scenarios 2 and 3 the pandemic is partially controlled through the measures, i.e., the contact rates continue to be reduced till the end of 2021. In Scenario 4, though, the contact rates return to the pre-pandemic levels on 1 October 2021 while the coverage is not sufficiently high leading to a slight increase in hospitalizations at the end of 2021.Finally, our results are also dependent on the assumed maximum coverage of 90% in all age groups.

        <p>In this study, we used an age-structured model for SARS-CoV-2 transmission to generate and evaluate scenarios for relaxation of control measures during the ongoing vaccination rollout in Portugal. In agreement with the plans of the Portuguese government, the mid-point of easing of measures is April 2021. Our analyses demonstrate that vaccination alone, if rolled out according to the national vaccination schedule, is likely to be insufficient to control the Portuguese pandemic in case control measures are significantly alleviated already in April 2021. In fact, in our analyses returning to the pre-pandemic lifestyle already in spring 2021 is a worst-case scenario that would likely lead to overburdening of the heatlhcare system. Even for the most optimistic model assumptions, this scenario would result in a wave of hospitalizations 20% larger than the three previous waves combined together (58,226 cumulative median hospitalizations from 1 April 2021 till 1 January 2022 versus 48,273 hospitalizations from 25 February 2020 till 31 March 2021). Relaxing measures to the same extent as in autumn 2020 would lead to a smaller wave (as compared to the worst-case scenario and even to the third wave that actually occurred) that would, nonetheless, present a significant burden for the healthcare system. Our findings are qualitatively similar to those in modeling studies for China 29 and the UK 27,28 . However, a quantitative comparison is not possible because of different settings and contexts in which these studies were conducted. Additional waves could be prevented altogether if measures in spring 2021 are relaxed to the same extent as in summer 2020 or in a step-wise manner throughout 2021.In this study, we used an age-structured model for SARS-CoV-2 transmission to generate and evaluate scenarios for relaxation of control measures during the ongoing vaccination rollout in Portugal.

        <p>The point at which the pandemic is brought under full control (R e (t) &lt; 1 and pre-pandemic contact patterns) depends on the amount of protection in the population acquired through a combination of natural infection and vaccination. Gaining the control quickly (by mid-May 2021) occurs mainly through protection by natural infection (60% of the population) while the minority (10%) would be protected by vaccination. As mentioned above, this worst-case scenario is, obviously, undesirable and is not very much different from letting the pandemic develop without any control measures. In the gradual relaxation scenario, achieving control takes more than one year since the start of vaccination rollout, but almost 50% of the population are protected by vaccination and a smaller proportion (35%) have experienced SARS-CoV-2 by that point. Alternative to these scenarios would be accelerating the vaccination campaign so that vaccination coverage increases faster than initially projected and confirmed by the vaccination rollout data 1 . However, it is not clear whether this option is viable for Portugal given the current shortage for COVID-19 vaccines.The point at which the pandemic is brought under full control (R e (t) &lt; 1 and pre-pandemic contact patterns) depends on the amount of protection in the population acquired through a combination of natural infection and vaccination.

        <p>In comparison with the previous studies [27][28][29] , a strength of our analyses is that we calculate the effective reproduction number using the estimated current levels of age-specific seroprevalence and vaccination coverage in the population instead of reducing the value of R e at the beginning of the pandemic homogeneously across age groups. Another strength of our analyses is that, unlike earlier studies for China and the UK [27][28][29] , the parameters of our model are based on formal statistical inference to match the course of the Portuguese pandemic as reflected by age-specific hospital admissions and age-specific seroprevalence data 59 . In addition, our fitting procedure allows for estimation of temporal changes in age-dependent contact patterns as a response to prior control measures during this pandemic. Therefore, instead of modeling specific relaxation policies that are not straightforward to implement in a compartmental model like ours (e.g., increased contact tracing 33 ) or other policies in which governments might be interested but that do not have immediate interpretation in terms of (setting-specific) contact matrices (e.g., banned gatherings of more than 3 people and family members of COVID-19 patients have to stay at home or allowing a visitor per 25 square meters of space in a shopping area without prior appointment), we model several scenarios using the estimated contact structure after relaxation of measures in summer and autumn 2020.In comparison with the previous studies [27][28][29] , a strength of our analyses is that we calculate the effective reproduction number using the estimated current levels of age-specific seroprevalence and vaccination coverage in the population instead of reducing the value of R e at the beginning of the pandemic homogeneously across age groups.

        <p>In light of these past measures, our findings are easy to interpret and contain an important message for local policymakers. School opening is thought to be the main driver of the changes observed in autumn 2020, although an increase in socializing indoors in general caused by weather alone must also have played a role. If the relaxation planned for April 2021 includes school reopening in full after Easter and resuming indoor service in restaurants and bars, then it is very likely that the average contact rate in the population will reach levels very similar to those in autumn 2020. As a consequence, this might lead to a new wave of hospitalizations as illustrated in Scenario 2. On the bright side, according to our analysis the goal of Scenario 3, in which major waves are avoided, seems well within reach, given the light control measures that were in place during summer 2020. Combining these with some additional limitations of indoor social activities and online classes for secondary school students could help to replicate the average contact rate of summer 2020, compensating for opening of elementary schools.In light of these past measures, our findings are easy to interpret and contain an important message for local policymakers.

        <p>As any model, our model has limitations. An important one is that protection against (re-)infection after natural infection and vaccination is permanent over the time-scale of our analyses (almost two years). This frequently used assumption [27][28][29]45,48 leads to that in our model, theoretically, SARS-CoV-2 can be eliminated from the population. However, as we discussed recently 60 and as addressed in several conceptual modeling studies [61][62][63] , accumulating evidence suggests that after the initial pandemic phase SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be transitioning to endemicity and continued circulation. Specifically, recent data from individual-level studies point to that detectable levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 providing immunity against reinfection can wane on the time scale of a few months to few years following exposure, as shown by our group 64 and corroborated with findings of other studies [65][66][67] . However, the immunity to SARS-CoV-2 depending on a combination of B-and T-cellmediated responses elicited during primary SARS-CoV-2 infection could reduce susceptibility to and infectiousness of the following infections and offer protection against severe disease, i.e., COVID-19 68 . The estimation of the model parameters and evaluation of relaxation strategies in light of waning of sterilizing immunity lies outside the scope of our study but it should be addressed in future work when convincing data on reinfections in unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals become available.As any model, our model has limitations.

The estimation of the model parameters and evaluation of relaxation strategies in light of waning of sterilizing immunity lies outside the scope of our study but it should be addressed in future work when convincing data on reinfections in unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals become available.</p>
        <p>Another limitation that deserves mention is that our results are based on early data on the efficacy in clinical trials and realworld effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine 16,[19][20][21][22][23] . We also assume that vaccine efficacy against the B.1.1.7 variant circulating in Portugal is the same as the efficacy reported from studies conducted in other locations, e.g., the recent study among working age adults in England 23 , where the dominant variant in circulation was B.1.1.7. This study demonstrated that effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against symptomatic and asymptomatic infection is 86% seven days after two doses 23 . However, SARS-CoV-2 mass vaccination programmes and prolonged control measures can generate selection pressure leading to viral adaptation, antigenic divergence or vaccine escape. Viral adaptations may contribute to decreasing efficacy of existing vaccines via faster waning of (sterilizing) immunity. For example, recent experiments demonstrate that the South African variant B.1.351 shows reduced neutralizing antibody binding increasing the prospects of reinfection and hampering the efficacy of spike-based vaccines 69 . This will need consideration in vaccine development and evaluation of future vaccination programmes and relaxation scenarios in mathematical transmission models. A possible case where an antigenic escape variant caused a resurgence of COVID-19 despite high population-level seroprevalence was observed in Manaus, Brazil 31 . In Portugal, the P.1 (Brazilian) variant of concern associated with the outbreak in Manaus does not appear to be on the rise by the end of March 2021. Should this variant start to spread later during 2021, the relaxation scenarios performed for pessimistic vaccine efficacies would be more appropriate in accordance with recent experimental studies demonstrating that the P.1 variant may evade neutralizing antibody responses induced by infection and vaccination 70 .Another limitation that deserves mention is that our results are based on early data on the efficacy in clinical trials and realworld effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine 16,[19][20][21][22][23] .

        <p>Lastly, our analyses assume a causal relation between the control measures and the reduction in circulation of SARS-CoV-2, and do not incorporate seasonal variation in transmissibility. The data on human coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) from other locations (e.g., New York or Stockholm) show a marked seasonal pattern 61,62,71 with hardly any circulation in summer. If the seasonality played a major role in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in summer 2020 then, irrespective of the relaxation of control measures, we could expect low epidemic activity near the end of spring 2021 too. The seasonality would also imply that the effective reproduction number is higher during the winter season and lower during the summer season, and could explain a relatively low basic reproduction number (median value of 2.20) estimated by the model in March 2020, although this value lies within the range of published estimates for other countries 72 .Lastly, our analyses assume a causal relation between the control measures and the reduction in circulation of SARS-CoV-2, and do not incorporate seasonal variation in transmissibility.

        <p>To summarize, our study provides timely input into the discussion about the pandemic response during the vaccination rollout in Portugal. Our analyses suggest that the pressing need to restart socioeconomic activities might lead to new waves of hospitalizations in 2021 and that substantial measures prove necessary to control COVID-19 throughout 2021. More favorable scenarios that help to avoid future waves include relaxation of measures as in summer 2020 or a step-wise approach when measures are relaxed gradually until the end of 2021.To summarize, our study provides timely input into the discussion about the pandemic response during the vaccination rollout in Portugal.

        <p>Data. The hospitalization data included n = 28,482 COVID-19 hospitalizations longer than 24 hours by date of admission and stratified by age during the period of 325 days following the first official case in Portugal (2 March 2020). The data was padded with 5 days without hospitalizations (from 26 February till 1 March 2020) to allow for the estimation of the number of infected individuals at the start of the pandemic. The hospitalization data spanned the first wave in spring 2020, relatively low epidemic activity in summer 2020, the second wave that started in autumn 2020 till mid-December 2020 and the third wave that started in mid-December 2020 and was still ongoing on 15 January 2021. The data source for hospital data was the Central Administration of the Health System and the Shared Services of the Ministry of Health, covering all public hospitals in Portugal receiving COVID-19 patients. Since early in the pandemic, Portugal adopted a policy of hospitalizing only patients who did not gather minimum conditions for being followed at the domicile, either due to clinical or sanitary conditions. This policy has not changed during the course of the pandemic.Data.

        <p>Transmission model. We extended an age-stratified SARS-CoV-2 transmission model from 43 to include vaccination (Fig. 8). The model has susceptible-exposedinfectious-recovered structure, whereby susceptible persons (S) may become latently infected (E) before progressing to become infectious (I). The latently infected persons are infected with SARS-CoV-2 but not yet infectious. Persons enter the I-compartment when they become infectious independently of whether they have symptoms or not. Therefore, this compartment contains both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The stratification in these two categories is not done because the parameters of the model would not be identified from the model fit to the data streams we used. Note that in our previous model 43 , we split the infectious period into several stages, thereby obtaining a more realistic distribution of the infectious period (i.e., Erlang/Gamma distribution instead of an exponential distribution used here). For computational reasons (much longer time series and more complex projections) we do not implement an Erlang-distributed infectious period this time. Infectious persons either get hospitalized (H) or recover without hospitalization (R). Disease-related mortality and discharge from the hospital are not explicitly modeled. Therefore, the H-compartment contains the cumulative number of persons who experience severe symptoms and recover (or die) after admission to the hospital. Similarly, the R-compartment contains the cumulative number of persons who recover after having mild or no symptoms. The force of infection is given by a weighted sum of the fraction of the infectious population in different age groups (red dashed boxes in Fig. 8). We consider a stable population and thus do not include natural birth and death processes. The contact rates, forces of infection, susceptibilities and hospitalization rates are agespecific.Transmission model.

        <p>In line with the current guidelines, we assume that vaccine can be delivered to all people independently from their disease history with the exception of those who might be currently infectious (I-compartment). Not vaccinating infectious compartment implies that vaccine is not given to asymptomatic persons but these represent a small fraction of the population at any given time as the absolute majority of the population is either in susceptible (S-compartment) or in recovered states (H and R-compartments). We also vaccinate the H-compartment as this compartment comprises everyone who has ever been admitted to hospital. Whilst this assumption means that the currently hospitalized persons are vaccinated too, their number is very small compared to the total number of people in the Hcompartment. The vaccine has three mechanisms of action: (i) reducing susceptibility (VE S ); (ii) reducing infectivity (VE I ); (iii) reducing hospitalization rate (VE H ). The vaccine has no effect in persons who recovered from natural infection (R and H compartments). We assume that protection after vaccination is achieved immediately and is equivalent to two vaccine doses, and that the duration of protection after both natural infection and vaccination is about two years (time horizon of our analyses). Finally, we allow for behavior compensation postvaccination modeled as a return to pre-pandemic contact rates among vaccinated persons as compared to unvaccinated persons who may continue to have reduced contact rates due to control measures. This is reflected in generally different forces of infection for unvaccinated and vaccinated persons.

        <p>The prior distribution of the model is specified in Supplementary Table 4. Informative priors were used for the latent (1/α) and infectious (1/γ) periods. Our choice of the range for the prior for the latent period (time between infection and becoming infectious) was based on the estimates of 4-6 days for the incubation period (time between infection and developing symptoms) 72,77 . Since the current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 transmission is possible before the development of symptoms, the latent period was chosen to be shorter than the incubation period, i.e., we used a narrower range of 2-5 days for 99% of the prior density of the latent period. The average generation interval in the model is 1/α + 1/γ. The priors on α and γ were chosen to match observed generation intervals (more precisely the serial interval 78 ) of on average 7 to 8 days. Also note that the effective infectious period has likely decreased because (self-)isolation upon the development of respiratory symptoms has been recommended and, in certain situations, enforced (e.g., at schools, hospitals) during the course of the pandemic 78 . Contact tracing and testing of asymptomatic persons also decreases the time of infectiousness. The mean a priori generation interval was 7.3 days (99% CrI 5.5-9.3).

Contact tracing and testing of asymptomatic persons also decreases the time of infectiousness. The mean a priori generation interval was 7.3 days (99% CrI 5.5-9.3). The individual serial intervals and duration of the infection have a much wider distribution.</p>

        <p>The estimated model parameters are shown in Supplementary Figs. 1 and2. As in our previous work 43 (Supplementary Fig. 5 therein), some of the parameters such as e.g., the infectious period, the initial fraction of infected individuals, the probability of transmission per contact and the hospitalization rate are strongly positively and negatively correlated. However, the outcomes of the model such as the cumulative number of hospitalizations during the study period are not sensitive to the key epidemiological parameters among which the infectious period, the latent period and the probability of transmission per contact. See scatter plots in Supplementary Fig. 12 made for Scenario 4 and a pessimistic set of vaccine efficacies where Pearson correlation coefficients between the three parameters and cumulative hospitalizations from 25 February 2020 till 24 June 2022 are in the range of 0.09 to 0.14. Time-varying contact patterns. The contact patterns in the population varied with time due to introduction/reinforcement or relaxation of control measures as follows: 0) introduction of measures to control the first pandemic wave (first lockdown, March 2020); 1) relaxation of measures after the first wave was curbed (May 2020); 2) further relaxation of measures that included school opening (September 2020); 3) reinforcement of measures to control the second wave (second lockdown, November 2020); 4) relaxation of measures around Christmas 2020; 5) reinforcement of measures to control the third wave (third lockdown, January 2021).The estimated model parameters are shown in Supplementary Figs. 1 and2.

        <p>The parameter K 0 of the logistic function describes the speed with which the first lockdown is enforced. The parameter t 0 describes the mid-time of the introduction of the first lockdown. Note in Eq. ( 7) we introduced the factor ζ ∈ [0, 1] to reflect that not all reported contacts after the first lockdown might be relevant for transmission, for example, due to mask-wearing or physical distancing when a contact took place. Therefore, the baseline (pre-pandemic) contact rates are described by the matrix b kl , and the contact rates after the first lockdown are described by the matrix ζa kl . The pre-pandemic matrix b kl for Portugal was taken from 74 (Fig. 9a). The matrix after the first lockdown a kl was inferred using the contact matrix for the Netherlands based on a cross-sectional survey carried out in April 2020 (PIENTER Corona study) 75 . Since measures enforced during the first lockdown in the two countries were similar (e.g., all schools were closed, all non-essential work was done from home etc.) we reduced the age-specific contact rates for Portugal after the lockdown by the same percentage as it was observed in the Netherlands (Fig. 9b). The resulting number of daily contacts for a person in given age group at baseline and after the lockdown in April 2020 is shown in Fig. 9c. Like for the Netherlands 75 , we observe larger reductions in contacts for children (due to school closure) and smaller reductions for elderly because most of their contacts were essential (e.g., with healthcare personnel or caretakers) and thus were not affected by the lockdown.
