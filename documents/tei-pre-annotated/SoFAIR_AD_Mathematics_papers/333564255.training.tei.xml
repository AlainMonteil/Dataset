        <p>Simplicial volume. The simplicial volume is an invariant of manifolds introduced by Gromov in his pioneering paper Volume and bounded cohomology [Gro82].

        <p>This norm descends to a seminorm on the homology H * (X) with real coefficients, and if M is a closed oriented n-dimensional manifold, then the simplicial volume M of M is the 1 -seminorm of the real fundamental class [M ] ∈ H n (M ).This norm descends to a seminorm on the homology H * (X) with real coefficients, and if M is a closed oriented n-dimensional manifold, then the simplicial volume M of M is the 1 -seminorm of the real fundamental class [M ] ∈ H n (M ).</p>
        <p>Simplicial volume and Riemannian geometry. While being defined only in terms of singular chains, the simplicial volume is deeply related to many invariants of geometric nature. For example, it vanishes for manifolds admitting a Riemannian metric with non-negative Ricci curvature, and it is positive for negatively curved manifolds [Gro82,IY82]. Indeed, Gromov's paper [Gro82] describes many phenomena which relate the simplicial volume to other invariants of differential geometric nature. If M is a compact Riemannian manifold, the so-called Gromov's main inequality establishes an explicit upper bound for the simplicial volume in terms of the Riemannian volume and the Ricci curvature of M . Using this, Gromov provided new estimates from below for the minimal volume in terms of the simplicial volume (the minimal volume of a Riemannian manifold M is the infimum of the volumes of complete Riemannian metrics on M subject to the condition that the absolute value of all sectional curvatures is not bigger than 1). In particular, Gromov proved in [Gro82] that the non-vanishing of the simplicial volume of M implies the non-vanishing of the minimal volume of M , which in turn implies that M cannot collapse while keeping the curvature uniformly bounded (i.e. there exists no sequence of Riemannian metrics on M with uniformly bounded sectional curvature whose volumes converge to 0). This result was exploited e.g. in the proof of a collapsing theorem which plays a fundamental role in the last step of Perelman's proof of Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture [BBB + 10, BBM + 10].Simplicial volume and Riemannian geometry.

        <p>Similar estimates hold when one replaces the minimal volume with the minimal entropy, an invariant which, roughly speaking, measures the rate of growth of balls in the universal covering. Gromov proved in [Gro82] that the non-vanishing of the simplicial volume implies the non-vanishing of the minimal entropy. Since then, the simplicial volume has been extensively exploited in the study of volumes of balls and of systolic inequalities in Riemannian manifolds (see e.g. [Sam99,Gut11,BK19]). We refer the reader to [BS] for recent results in this direction.Similar estimates hold when one replaces the minimal volume with the minimal entropy, an invariant which, roughly speaking, measures the rate of growth of balls in the universal covering.

        <p>Even more can be said when working with manifolds with constant curvature or, more in general, with locally symmetric spaces. For closed hyperbolic manifolds, a fundamental result by Gromov and Thurston shows that M = Vol(M )/v n , where v n is a constant only depending on the dimension n of M [Thu79,Gro82]. This result (which provides one of the few exact computations of the simplicial volume) describes the hyperbolic volume explicitly in terms of a topological invariant, and plays a fundamental role in a celebrated proof of Mostow Rigidity Theorem due to Gromov and Thurston. More in general, Gromov's Proportionality Principle [Gro82] ensures that the ratio M / Vol(M ) between the simplicial volume and the classical volume of a closed Riemannian manifold only depends on the isometry type of the universal covering of M (see also [Thu79,Löh06,BK08a,Fri11,Fra16,Str17]). Lafont and Schmidt proved in [LS06] that the proportionality constant between M and Vol(M ) is positive for every locally symmetric space of non-compact type (see also [BK07] for a case not covered by Lafont and Schmidt's argument). Thus locally symmetric spaces of non-compact type have positive simplicial volume, and this answers a question posed by Gromov [Gro82].Even more can be said when working with manifolds with constant curvature or, more in general, with locally symmetric spaces.

        <p>Other long-standing questions on the relationship between curvature and simplicial volume for Riemannian manifolds are still unsolved. For example, Gromov conjectured in [Gro82] that the simplicial volume of a non-positively curved manifold with negative Ricci curvature should be positive. We refer the reader to [CW19,CW] for some recent progress on this topic.Other long-standing questions on the relationship between curvature and simplicial volume for Riemannian manifolds are still unsolved.

        <p>The simplicial volume has also been studied in relation with the Chern Conjecture, which predicts that the Euler characteristic of a closed manifold admitting an affine structure should vanish [BG11,BCL18], or, equivalently, that if the tangent bundle T M of a closed manifold M admits a torsion-free flat connection, then its Euler number of T M should vanish.

        <p>Simplicial volume and the topology of manifolds. Of course, the simplicial volume has found applications also to problems which are more topological in nature. The elementary remark that the degree of any map f : M → N between closed manifolds of the same dimension is bounded above by the ratio M / N laid the foundation for many results on domination between manifolds (an orientable manifold M dominates the orientable manifold N if there exists a map f : M → N of non-vanishing degree). We refer the reader e.g. to [Der10, BRW14, Neo17, Neo18, LN19] for some results on domination between 3-manifolds that were obtained via the study of the simplicial volume.Simplicial volume and the topology of manifolds.

        <p>Also when dealing with the topological features of simplicial volume, it turns out that some long-standing questions are still unsolved. For example, Gromov asked in [Gro93,page 232] whether the L 2 -Betti numbers of a closed aspherical manifold M with M = 0 should vanish (see also [Gro09,3.1. (e) on page 769]). If answered in the affirmative, Gromov's question would imply, for example, that if M is an orientable aspherical closed manifold admitting a self-map of degree d / ∈ {-1, 0, 1}, then the Euler characteristic of M vanishes. In order to approach his question, Gromov himself introduced a variation of the classical simplicial volume, called the integral foliated simplicial volume [Gro99]. For some results on this topic we refer e.g. to [Sau09, Sch05, FFM12, LP16, FLPS16, FFL19 , FLMQ].Also when dealing with the topological features of simplicial volume, it turns out that some long-standing questions are still unsolved.

        <p>Other (even more elementary) open questions on the simplicial volume are related to products and fiber bundles. If M, F are closed orientable manifolds of dimension m, n respectively, then the simplicial volume of M × F satisfies the bounds M • F ≤ M × F ≤ c n,m M • F , where c n,m is a constant only depending on n, m (see e.g. [Gro82]). Of course, products are just a special case of fiber bundles, so one may wonder whether the simplicial volume of the total space E of a fiber bundle with base M and fiber F could be estimated in terms of the simplicial volumes of M and F . In the case when F is a surface it was proved in [HK01] that the inequality M • F ≤ E still holds. This estimate was then improved in [Buc09]. It it still an open question whether the inequality E ≥ M • F holds for every fiber bundle E with fiber F and base M , without any restriction on the dimensions of F and M .Other (even more elementary) open questions on the simplicial volume are related to products and fiber bundles.

        <p>Bounded cohomology. Computing the simplicial volume has proved to be a very challenging task. Besides hyperbolic manifolds, the only other closed manifolds for which the exact value of the simplicial volume is known are 4-dimensional manifolds locally isometric to the product H 2 ×H 2 of two hyperbolic planes [BK08b] (for example, the product of two hyperbolic surfaces). Starting from these examples, more values for the simplicial volume can be obtained by taking connected sums or amalgamated sums along submanifolds with an amenable fundamental group.Bounded cohomology.

        <p>A cochain is bounded if its ∞ -norm is finite. It is easily seen that bounded cochains define a subcomplex C * b (X) of C * (X), whose cohomology is the bounded cohomology H * b (X) of X. The inclusion C * b (X) → C * (X) induces the comparison map c * : H * b (X) → H * (X) . For every n ∈ N, the normed space C n b (X) coincides with the topological dual of C * (X) (endowed with the 1 -norm). Using this, it is not difficult to show that the vanishing of H n b (X) implies the vanishing of the 1 -seminorm on H n (X) (hence, of the simplicial volume, if X is a closed n-dimensional manifold). This and other duality results have been exhaustively exploited in the study of the simplicial volume. For example, Bucher's computation of the simplicial volume of manifolds locally isometric to H 2 × H 2 takes place in the context of bounded cohomology, and it is based on the study of bounded cocycles rather than of cycles. As a quite surprising consequence, there is no description of any fundamental cycle for the product of two hyperbolic surfaces whose 1 -seminorm approximates the value of the simplicial volume.A cochain is bounded if its ∞ -norm is finite.

        <p>One of the most peculiar features of the bounded cohomology of a space X is that it only depends on the fundamental group of X. In particular, the bounded cohomology of any simply connected space vanishes. In order to prove this fundamental result (and other related results), Gromov introduced in [Gro82] the notion of multicomplex. Since then, multicomplexes have been exploited in several papers on the simplicial volume (see e.g. [Kue15,KK15,Str]).One of the most peculiar features of the bounded cohomology of a space X is that it only depends on the fundamental group of X.

        <p>Multicomplexes. The first aim of this paper is to lay the foundation of the theory of multicomplexes. We believe that renovating the interest towards this topic could be fruitful for at least two reasons. First of all, approaching the simplicial volume via multicomplexes (rather than from the dual point of view of bounded cohomology) means working with cycles (in a quite concrete way) rather than with cocycles (via duality). In our view, this allows a more direct understanding of the topology and the geometry of cycles, and could be of help in finding new approaches to some long-standing open questions on the simplicial volume. Secondly, while bounded cohomology is very effective in dealing with finite singular chains (hence, with the simplicial volume of compact manifolds), the use of multicomplexes is still necessary in the study of locally finite chains (hence, of the simplicial volume of open manifolds) -we refer the reader to [Löh07,Remark C.4] for a discussion of this issue. Similarly, we hope that multicomplexes could help to understand some peculiar features of relative bounded cohomology (hence, of the simplicial volume of manifolds with boundary) -see the discussion in Section 4.5.Multicomplexes.

        <p>Most results proved in this work on the simplicial volume of closed manifolds admit alternative proofs which do not make use of multicomplexes. On the contrary, here we provide the first detailed proofs of several results stated by Gromov in [Gro82] on the simplicial volume of open manifolds. Indeed, in [Gro82] one may find outlines for the proofs of various results stated here. However, when trying to fill in the details of Gromov's arguments, we often needed to face substantial difficulties that we were not able to overcome without diverging from Gromov's original path. In some cases, Gromov's proofs were so concise that it is not even clear whether our work follows his ideas or not. In expanding Gromov's hints, we developed tools and ideas that will hopefully be of use also in future works. Unfortunately, we also needed to introduce some (unavoidable, to the best of our efforts) technicalities, and we did our best to supply the most technical passages with an informal description of what is going on.Most results proved in this work on the simplicial volume of closed manifolds admit alternative proofs which do not make use of multicomplexes.

        <p>Before stating the main results proved in this paper, let us briefly introduce the notion of multicomplex. As stated in [Gro82], a multicomplex is "a set K divided into the union of closed affine simplices ∆ i , i ∈ I, such that the intersection of any two simplices ∆ i ∩ ∆ j is a (simplicial) subcomplex in ∆ i as well as in ∆ j ". More formally, a multicomplex is an unordered ∆-complex in which every simplex has distinct vertices, or, equivalently, a symmetric simplicial set in which every nondegenerate simplex has distinct vertices. We refer the reader to Definition 1.1.1 for the precise definition of multicomplex, and to Section 1.3 for a thorough discussion of the relationship between multicomplexes and other well-known simplicial structures.Before stating the main results proved in this paper, let us briefly introduce the notion of multicomplex.

        <p>The singular multicomplex. If X is a topological space, then the singular multicomplex K(X) associated to X is a multicomplex whose n-simplices are given by the singular n-simplices with distinct vertices in X, up to affine automorphisms of the standard simplex ∆ n . This definition evokes the notion of singular complex S(X) of X, which is the simplicial set having as simplices the singular simplices with values in X. The geometric realizations |S(X)| and |K(X)| of both S(X) and K(X) come equipped with natural projections j : |S(X)| → X, S : |K(X)| → X. A fundamental result in the theory of simplicial sets ensures that j is a weak homotopy equivalence. In Section 2.1 we establish the same result for the map S: Theorem 1. Let X be a good space.

        <p>The Isometry Lemma. As mentioned above, Ivanov recently proved that weak homotopy equivalences induce isometric isomorphisms on bounded cohomology [Iva]. Therefore, by Theorem 1 we can compute the bounded cohomology of a good space X by looking at the singular bounded cohomology of |K(X)|. Just as for simplicial sets, the simplicial cohomology of a multicomplex K (which will be denoted by the symbol H * (K)) is isomorphic to the singular cohomology of its geometric realization. There is no hope to extend this result to bounded cohomology for general multicomplexes (for example, if a multicomplex K has a finite number of simplices, then its simplicial bounded cohomology H * b (K) obviously coincides with the ordinary simplicial cohomology H * (K), which is in turn isomorphic to the singular cohomology H * (|K|) of its geometric realization; but H * (|K|) is in general very far from being isomorphic to the singular bounded cohomology H * b (|K|) of |K|). However, Gromov showed in [Gro82] that the inclusion of bounded simplicial cochains into bounded singular cochains induces an isometric isomorphism H * b (K) → H * b (|K|) provided that the multicomplex K is complete and large.

        <p>A crucial intuition of Gromov is that, if K, L and A are as above, then, for every n ∈ N, the n-skeleton of the aspherical multicomplex A is the quotient of the n-skeleton of L with respect to the action of an amenable group. This result ultimately depends (in a very indirect way) on the fact that A is obtained from L by killing all higher homotopy groups, and higher homotopy groups are abelian, hence amenable. The fact that higher homotopy groups are abelian is exploited also by Ivanov in his proof that the bounded cohomology of a space only depends on its fundamental group, which is based on the construction of a tower of weakly principal bundles with amenable (but infinite-dimensional!) structure groups. Here we develop Gromov's intuition into self-contained and complete proofs. To this aim, we need to introduce some modifications not only to Gromov's arguments, but even to some (fundamental) definitions given in [Gro82]. For example, our definition of the group of simplicial automorphisms Γ such that L/Γ ∼ = A is different from Gromov's.

        <p>Bounded cohomology is determined by the fundamental group. The second part of this paper is devoted to the use of multicomplexes in the study of bounded cohomology and of the simplicial volume of closed manifolds. As just mentioned, a key result in the theory of multicomplexes is that, for every good topological space X, the singular multicomplex K(X) is complete. Therefore, putting together Theorem 1 with Theorem 2 and the invariance of bounded cohomology with respect to weak homotopy equivalences [Iva], one obtains that H * b (X) is isometrically isomorphic to the bounded simplicial cohomology H * b (K(X)) of K(X) for every good topological space X (Gromov states the same result for any topological space in [Gro82], see Remark 4.2.3 for a discussion of this issue). Moreover, one may define a complete and minimal multicomplex L(X) and a complete, minimal and aspherical multicomplex A(X) associated to X. Since the action of an amenable group is invisible to bounded cohomology, from all these facts we can deduce that the bounded cohomology of X is isometrically isomorphic to the simplicial bounded cohomology of the aspherical multicomplex A(X) (which satisfies π 1 (|A(X)|) ∼ = π 1 (X)).

If M is tame, i.e. it is the internal part of a compact manifold with boundary M , then it is known that M ≤ M , and that the equality holds provided that the fundamental group of every connected component of ∂M is amenable [Löh08,KK15] (we refer the reader to Section 4.5 for the definition of the simplicial volume of a manifold with boundary). However, in the case when ∂M is not amenable, no example is known for which M &lt; +∞ and M &gt; M . Neither is known any example of an open manifold M with non-amenable topological ends for which M / ∈ {0, +∞} (while we refer the reader e.g. to [LS09b] for the exact computation of the simplicial volume of some manifolds which compactify to manifolds with an amenable boundary).

        <p>The main goal of this chapter is to introduce the notion of multicomplex, defined by M. Gromov in [Gro82]. Multicomplexes belong to the family of simplicial structures. Roughly speaking, one can order the most common simplicial structures according to the degeneracies allowed for their simplices. In this spirit, the least singular objects one can consider are simplicial complexes, while the most general ones are probably simplicial sets. Somewhere between them we have ∆-complexes, which were introduced in [EZ50] by Eilenberg and Zilber under the name of semisimplicial complexes. As we will see, multicomplexes are special ∆-complexes, so they may be considered as a mild generalization of simplicial complexes, the main difference being that simplices in multicomplexes are not determined by their vertices (but they are still embedded: in particular, the vertices of any simplex of a multicomplex are necessarily pairwise distinct). We refer the reader to Section 1.3 for more details about the relationship between multicomplexes and their relatives.The main goal of this chapter is to introduce the notion of multicomplex, defined by M.

        <p>As mentioned above, simplicial multicomplexes (or, for short, multicomplexes) provide a generalization of simplicial complexes. Indeed, multicomplexes may be considered as simplicial complexes where distinct simplices may intersect in an arbitrary union of common faces (in particular, they may have the same set of vertices). Gromov's definition of multicomplex summarizes these properties in a very informative and short sentence: according to [Gro82], a multicomplex is "a set K divided into the union of closed affine simplices ∆ i , i ∈ I, such that the intersection of any two simplices ∆ i ∩ ∆ j is a (simplicial) subcomplex in ∆ i as well as in ∆ j ". As a topological space, a multicomplex is endowed with the weak topology associated to its decomposition into simplices. This concrete definition of multicomplex would probably suffice to provide a clear insight into the topological features of multicomplexes. Nevertheless, in the sequel we will be interested in settling the foundation of the (bounded) cohomology of multicomplexes. To this aim, it is convenient to have a more formal (and combinatorial) definition available.As mentioned above, simplicial multicomplexes (or, for short, multicomplexes) provide a generalization of simplicial complexes.

        <p>Let us immediately point out two peculiarities of multicomplexes with respect to simplicial complexes and simplicial sets. First of all, degenerate simplices are not allowed: each n-simplex has exactly (n + 1) distinct vertices. Moreover, there is no ordering on the set of vertices of a simplex. As a (rather disappointing, at first sight) consequence, it makes no sense to speak of the i-th face of a simplex. Therefore, multicomplexes are not simplicial sets (but to every multicomplex one can canonically associate a simplicial set, see Section 1.3). Indeed, the two properties we have just pointed out make perhaps multicomplexes more similar to simplicial complexes than to simplicial sets. For more details, we refer the reader to Section 1.3, where we will see that (the geometric realization of) a multicomplex is what Hatcher calls a regular unordered ∆-complex [Hat02]. Here we just point out that in this paper we will understand the following definition of simplicial complex, which is in fact equivalent to the classical definition that may be found e.g. in [Hat02,Mun84]: Definition 1.1.2.

In the context of simplicial sets, degenerate simplices take care of this phenomenon, while in the context of multicomplexes we need to allow simplicial maps to be non-homogeneous with respect to the dimension of simplices.Remark 1.1.4.

        <p>The singular multicomplex To our purposes, the most important example of multicomplex is the singular multicomplex associated to a topological space. The name singular multicomplex evokes the (total ) singular complex in the theory of ∆-complexes and simplicial sets: if X is a topological space, the singular complex S(X) of X is the simplicial set having as simplices the singular simplices with values in X (see e.g. [Eil44, EZ50, Mil57, FP90, GJ99]). Roughly speaking, the singular multicomplex K(X) is the multicomplex having as simplices the singular simplices in X with distinct vertices, up to affine symmetries. Therefore, the singular multicomplex differs from the singular complex both beacuse of the requirement that singular simplices be injective on vertices, and because the geometric simplices of the singular multicomplex do not come with a preferred ordering of their vertices.The singular multicomplex To our purposes, the most important example of multicomplex is the singular multicomplex associated to a topological space.

        <p>Proof. Since K(X) is a CW complex, it is sufficient to show that every pair of vertices are connected by an edge, and every simplicial path is null homotopic. Let x 0 , x 1 be distinct vertices of K(X) , i.e. points of X. Since X is path connected, we can choose a path γ : [0, 1] → X joining x 0 and x 1 . If π( x 0 ) = π( x 1 ), such a path defines a 1-simplex joining x 0 and x 1 in K(X) . Suppose now π( x 0 ) = π( x 1 ). The path π • γ cannot be constant, because otherwise the image of γ would be contained in π -1 (π( x 0 )), which is discrete, so γ itself should be constant, a contradiction. Therefore, the image of γ contains points that do not project onto π( x 0 ) = π( x 1 ), and we can express γ as the concatenation of two paths that define 1-simplices of | K(X)|. The concatenation of such 1-simplices joins x 0 and x 1 in | K(X)|, and this concludes the proof of the fact that | K(X)| is path connected.Proof.

        <p>Let now Z be a finite multicomplex such that |Z| is homeomorphic to S 1 , and let γ : Z → K(X) be a non-degenerate simplicial map. As discussed above, in order to show that K(X) is simply connected it is sufficient to show that the geometric realization |γ| of γ is null-homotopic. Of course, if X consists of a single point there is nothing to prove, so since X is good and path connected we can assume that X contains infinitely many points. In particular, there exists a point x 0 in X whose projection on X is not contained in π(|γ|(Z 0 )). If D is the multicomplex obtained by coning Z over a point O (so that |D| is homeomorphic to the 2-dimensional disc), using the fact that X is simply connected we can extend S • |γ| : |Z| → X to a map f : |D| → X sending O to x 0 . By construction, the restriction of π • f to every simplex of D is injective on vertices, so f defines a transpose simplicial map t f : D → K( X).

        <p>Proof. Let Γ ∼ = π 1 (X) be the group of deck transformations of the covering π : X → X. Then Γ acts simplicially on K(X) as follows: if σ is a simplex of K(X) represented by σ : ∆ n → X, then γ • σ is the class of γ • σ. Since γ is a deck transformation, it is easily seen that this action is well defined. Moreover, an element γ ∈ Γ leaves a simplex of K(X) invariant only if γ = Id. Indeed, being free on X, the action of Γ is free on the vertices of K(X). Moreover, if γ • σ = σ for some simplex σ, then γ permutes the vertices of σ; but the vertices of σ project to distinct vertices of X, so they are pairwise Γ-non-equivalent. This implies that γ fixes each vertex of σ, so it is the identity. The induced action on the geometric realization K(X) is therefore wandering (i.e. every point of K(X) admits a neighbourhood which is disjoint form the union of all its translates). This implies that the quotient map with respect to the Γ-action on K(X) is a covering. In order to conclude that π is a covering we now just need to observe that π : K(X) → |K(X)| is open (since both K(X) and |K(X)| are endowed with the weak topology), and that π(x) = π(y) if and only if x and y lie in the same Γ-orbit.Proof. Let Γ ∼ = π 1 (X) be the group of deck transformations of the covering π : X → X. Then Γ acts simplicially on K(X) as follows: if σ is a simplex of K(X) represented by σ : ∆ n → X, then γ • σ is the class of γ • σ. Since γ is a deck transformation, it is easily seen that this action is well defined. Moreover, an element γ ∈ Γ leaves a simplex of K(X) invariant only if γ = Id. Indeed, being free on X, the action of Γ is free on the vertices of K(X). Moreover, if γ • σ = σ for some simplex σ, then γ permutes the vertices of σ; but the vertices of σ project to distinct vertices of X, so they are pairwise Γ-non-equivalent. This implies that γ fixes each vertex of σ, so it is the identity. The induced action on the geometric realization K(X) is therefore wandering (i.e. every point of K(X) admits a neighbourhood which is disjoint form the union of all its translates). This implies that the quotient map with respect to the Γ-action on K(X) is a covering. In order to conclude that π is a covering we now just need to observe that π : K(X) → |K(X)| is open (since both K(X) and |K(X)| are endowed with the weak topology), and that π(x) = π(y) if and only if x and y lie in the same Γ-orbit.</p>

        <p>As mentioned above, we can now prove that the singular multicomplex K(X) is homotopy equivalent to the singular simplicial set S(X) (at least for good spaces). Just as for the singular multicomplex, the singular set S(X) comes equipped with a continuous map j : |S(X)| → X, where |S(X)| denotes the geometric realization of S(X) (see e.g. [Mil57]). The multicomplex |K(X)| may be realized as a subcomplex of |S(X)| as follows. Let us fix an arbitrary ordering on X, now considered as a set. Let τ be an n-simplex of K(X), so that τ is the equivalence class of a singular simplex with values in X. In such equivalence class there exists a unique singular simplex τ : ∆ n → X which is increasing on the set of vertices of ∆ n . We then set i(τ ) = τ , and we observe that this formula defines a cellular map (still denoted by i) from |K(X)| to |S(X)|. In fact, if we endow K(X) with the structure of simplicial set generated by its structure as a multicomplex, then i : K(X) → S(X) is a simplicial embedding.As mentioned above, we can now prove that the singular multicomplex K(X) is homotopy equivalent to the singular simplicial set S(X) (at least for good spaces).

        <p>Let K be a multicomplex with associated (ordered) simplicial set Z. Unfortunately, completeness for K does not imply strong completeness for Z: if two edges of K join the distinct vertices v, w (and this phenomenon may well occur in complete multicomplexes), then a simplicial map Λ 1 → K having these edges as image does not extend to a simplicial map on ∆ 2 , since non-degenerate simplices of Z must have distinct vertices. Therefore, completeness for K is not equivalent to the Kan condition for Z (and the Kan condition for Z seems to be too restrictive to our purposes: if K = K(X), then the associated simplicial set Z is not Kan, while it is complete as we will prove in Theorem 3.2.3). We could therefore define the Kan condition for multicomplexes as follows: a multicomplex K is e-Kan (where "e" stands for "embedding") if, for every n ∈ N, every simplicial embedding f : Λ n → K may be extended to a simplicial map (which is automatically an embedding) F : ∆ n+1 → K. The singular multicomplex K(X) satisfies the e-Kan condition for every topological space X. Moreover, the same argument showing that strong completeness implies the Kan condition for simplicial sets shows that completeness implies the e-Kan condition for multicomplexes (see also the proof of Lemma 3.1.4 below). Unfortunately, at the moment we are not able to show that the e-Kan condition implies (and therefore is equivalent to) completeness for multicomplexes.Let K be a multicomplex with associated (ordered) simplicial set Z. Unfortunately, completeness for K does not imply strong completeness for Z: if two edges of K join the distinct vertices v, w (and this phenomenon may well occur in complete multicomplexes), then a simplicial map Λ 1 → K having these edges as image does not extend to a simplicial map on ∆ 2 , since non-degenerate simplices of Z must have distinct vertices.

We could therefore define the Kan condition for multicomplexes as follows: a multicomplex K is e-Kan (where "e" stands for "embedding") if, for every n ∈ N, every simplicial embedding f : Λ n → K may be extended to a simplicial map (which is automatically an embedding) F : ∆ n+1 → K. The singular multicomplex K(X) satisfies the e-Kan condition for every topological space X. Moreover, the same argument showing that strong completeness implies the Kan condition for simplicial sets shows that completeness implies the e-Kan condition for multicomplexes (see also the proof of Lemma 3.1.4 below). Unfortunately, at the moment we are not able to show that the e-Kan condition implies (and therefore is equivalent to) completeness for multicomplexes.</p>

        <p>(1) Let K be a complete connected one-dimensional multicomplex. Then K is a segment. Indeed, K must contain at least two vertices (because otherwise it would be either empty or a point). Let us suppose by contradiction that K contains at least three vertices v 0 , v 1 and v 2 . Since K is connected, up to reordering these vertices we can suppose that K contains a 1-simplex e 1 joining v 1 to v 2 and a 1-simplex e 2 joining v 2 to v 3 . The concatenation of e 1 and e 2 provides a continuous map |∆ 1 | → |K| which is a simplicial embedding on ∂|∆ 1 |, so completeness ensures the existence of a 1-simplex e 3 joining v 1 to v 3 and homotopic to e 1 * e 2 relative to the endpoints. The loop given by the concatenation of e 1 , e 2 and (the inverse of) e 3 is nullhomotopic, and can be realized as a simplicial embedding of ∂∆ 2 in K. By completeness, this implies that K contains at least one 2-dimensional simplex. This contradicts the fact that K is 1-dimensional, thus showing that K contains exactly 2 vertices.(1) Let K be a complete connected one-dimensional multicomplex. Then K is a segment.

        <p>Let us finally prove that the vertices of K are joined by a unique edge. In fact, if K contained at least two edges, then we could take a reduced (i.e. non-backtracking) simplicial path of length 3 in |K|. By completeness, this path should be homotopic relative to its endpoints to a single edge of K. But reduced paths in a graph are never homotopic relative to their endpoints, unless they coincide. This shows that K must be a segment.Let us finally prove that the vertices of K are joined by a unique edge.

        <p>In this section we will introduce the notion of minimal multicomplex. In complete multicomplexes, every simplicial embedding of ∂∆ n which continuously extends over |∆ n | may be deformed into a simplicial embedding of ∆ n itself. In minimal multicomplexes such a deformation, when possible, leads to a unique choice for the resulting simplicial embedding (see Definition 3.4.1 for a precise formulation of this condition). In some sense, minimal multicomplexes do not contain redundant simplices, i.e. simplices that do not enrich the homotopy type of the geometric realization. We will show how to replace a complete multicomplex K with a submulticomplex L which is both complete and minimal, without affecting the homotopy type of the geometric realization (see Theorem 3.4.6). This fact will prove very useful: indeed, we have already seen in Theorems 1 and 3.2.3 that every good topological space X is weakly homotopy equivalent to the singular multicomplex K(X), which is complete.

        <p>Let now σ be an n-simplex of L 2 and let j 2 : ∂∆ n → L 2 be a simplicial isomorphism between ∂∆ n and ∂σ. Since f restricts to an isomorphism between L n-1 1 and L n-1 2 , there exists a simplicial embedding j 1 : ∂∆ n → L 1 such that j 2 = f • j 1 . Since |f | is a homotopy equivalence, from the fact that ∂σ bounds a simplex in L 2 we deduce that the geometric realization of j 1 extends to a continuous map on |∆ n |. By completeness of L 1 , this implies that there exists a simplex ∆ 0 such that f (∂∆ 0 ) = ∂σ. Let now x 0 be a vertex of ∆ 0 . Being a homotopy equivalence, the map |f | induces an isomorphism between π n (|L 1 |, x 0 ) and π n (|L 2 |, f (x 0 )). By Theorem 3.4.5, this implies in turn that f induces a bijection between π(∆ 0 ) and π(σ) (recall that π(∆) is the set of simplices compatible with ∆). In particular, σ lies in the image of f , and this concludes the proof. Theorem 3.4.6 shows that, if K is a complete multicomplex, then minimal and complete submulticomplexes of K whose inclusion in K defines a homotopy equivalence are unique up to isomorphism. Therefore, with a slight abuse we will often refer to such a submulticomplex as to the minimal multicomplex associated to K.Let now σ be an n-simplex of L 2 and let j 2 : ∂∆ n → L 2 be a simplicial isomorphism between ∂∆ n and ∂σ.

Since |f | is a homotopy equivalence, from the fact that ∂σ bounds a simplex in L 2 we deduce that the geometric realization of j 1 extends to a continuous map on |∆ n |. By completeness of L 1 , this implies that there exists a simplex ∆ 0 such that f (∂∆ 0 ) = ∂σ. Let now x 0 be a vertex of ∆ 0 . Being a homotopy equivalence, the map |f | induces an isomorphism between π n (|L 1 |, x 0 ) and π n (|L 2 |, f (x 0 )). By Theorem 3.4.5, this implies in turn that f induces a bijection between π(∆ 0 ) and π(σ) (recall that π(∆) is the set of simplices compatible with ∆).

        <p>Remark 4.3.7. As already mentioned in the introduction, it is very natural to wonder whether Gromov's Mapping Theorem could be proved by resorting to the classical theory of simplicial sets, rather than to the quite exotic theory of multicomplexes. Unfortunately, this seems very hard. A first issue regards the fact that, in order to effectively exploit the action of Γ on the simplices of K(X) (or of L(X)), we definitely need to be able to construct elements in Γ which act on some simplices of K(X) as an orientation-reversing affine automorphism (see the conclusion of the proof of the Vanishing Theorem 6 at the very end of Chapter 6, or Corollary 9.3.10). To this aim, it is crucial that simplices of K(X) correspond to singular simplices in X up to affine automorphisms, and this implies in turn that simplices of K(X) must come with no orderings on their vertices. Due to this fact, one could try to work with unordered simplicial sets, as described e.g. in [Gra01a,Gra01b,RT03]. However, also the fact that the simplices of K(X) have distinct vertices plays a fundamental role in our arguments, as the following discussion shows.Remark 4.3.7.

        <p>When working with a pointed (Kan) simplicial set (S, x 0 ), the n-th homotopy group of (|S|, x 0 ) is usually studied via the analysis of spherical simplices, that can be defined as follows: a simplex ∆ of S is spherical if every face of ∆ is the degenerate (n -1)-simplex supported on the singleton x 0 . In other words, ∆ is spherical if |∂∆| = {x 0 }, i.e. if the geometric realization of ∆ induces a map of pairs (|∆|, |∂∆|) → (|S|, x 0 ). Indeed, when S is Kan and minimal, the elements of the n-th homotopy group of |S| bijectively correspond to the spherical simplices of S based at x 0 (see e.g. [GJ99, Section I.11, page 60] and [May92, Definition 3.6]).When working with a pointed (Kan) simplicial set (S, x 0 ), the n-th homotopy group of (|S|, x 0 ) is usually studied via the analysis of spherical simplices, that can be defined as follows: a simplex ∆ of S is spherical if every face of ∆ is the degenerate (n -1)-simplex supported on the singleton x 0 .

        <p>Recall now from Corollary 2.1.8 that K(X) (hence L(X)) may be identified with a subcomplex of S(X). However, S(X) contains many more simplices than K(X) and L(X): for example, in positive dimension spherical simplices cannot belong to K(X). When we tried to adapt Gromov's ideas to the context of simplicial sets, this raised several difficulties that we were not able to overcome. Indeed, let us choose a minimal Kan subcomplex M(X) of S(X) such that the inclusion |M(X)| → |S(X)| is a homotopy equivalence, and let Γ S be the group of simplicial automorphisms of M(X) which are homotopic to the identity relative to the 0skeleton. Also let x 0 be a vertex of M(X) (which is also a point of X). Since M(X) is Kan and minimal, the group π n (|M(X)|, x 0 ) ∼ = π n (X, x 0 ) is in bijection with the set of spherical simplices of M(X) based at x 0 . Moreover, every element of Γ S , being homotopic to the identity relative to x 0 , fixes every spherical simplex based at x 0 . This implies that no analogue of Corollary 4.3.4 or of Proposition 4.3.5 can hold for the action of Γ S on M(X). In particular, the projections of all the spherical simplices of M(X) to the quotient M(X)/Γ S remain pairwise distinct. Therefore, either M(X)/Γ S is not aspherical, or it is not minimal. In any case, the realization of an aspherical simplicial set with the same fundamental group of X as a quotient of M(X) by a simplicial action seems hard to achieve.

Since A(X) is an aspherical CW complex, from the general theory of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces we know that ψ(g) is topologically homotopic to the identity provided that it induces the identity on π 1 (|A(X)|, x 0 ) for some x 0 ∈ |A(X)| (see for instance [Whi78, Theorem 7.2] or [Hat02, Proposition 1B.9]).Proof.

This implies that ψ(g) acts as the identity on every edge of A(X) having x 0 , x 1 as endpoints. Since A(X) is complete, we know that every element of π 1 (|A(X)|, x 0 ) may be represented by a pair of edges with endpoints x 0 , x 1 (see Theorem 3.2.5). Therefore, ψ(g) acts as the identity on π 1 (|A(X)|, x 0 ), and this proves that ψ(g) is topologically homotopic to the identity.Without loss of generality we may assume that X is path connected and contains at least two points, so that A(X) is large.

        <p>Remark 6.1.3. Theorem 6 is originally due to Gromov [Gro82, page 40], while Theorem 6.1.2 was proved (in a slightly different version) by Ivanov in [Iva87, Theorem 6.2] and in [Iva,Theorem 9.1] (with weaker hypotheses than ours on the topology of X). Ivanov's argument is completely different from ours, and it is based on the use of a variation of the Mayer-Vietoris double complex for singular cohomology. As a consequence, it is not clear at first sight whether the factoring map H n (|N (U)|) → H n (X) decribed by Ivanov coincides with the canonical map β n introduced here.

        <p>No assumption on the connectedness of finite intersections of elements of U appears in Theorem 6, hence one may wonder whether this requirement could be removed from the hypotheses of Theorem 6.1.2. The following example shows that this is not the case. Indeed, let X be a finite simplicial complex of dimension n.

By ad-completeness of AD L (X), the map G is strongly ad-homotopic to a singular simplex appearing in AD L (X). As a consequence, there exists a simplex ∆ in AD L (X) such that ∂∆ = ϕ -1 k (∂∆ ). Therefore, ∆ ∈ π(ϕ k+1 (∆)). Now the surjectivity of the map Φ ∆ : π(∆) → π(ϕ k+1 (∆)) implies that ∆ = ϕ k+1 (∆ ) for some ∆ ∈ π(∆), and this concludes the proof of the surjectivity of ϕ k+1 , whence of the claim.Let now ∆ be a given (k+1)-simplex of AD L (X), and fix an affine parametrization ψ : |∆ k+1 | → |∆ | of ∆ .

By Theorem 11.1.5 we know that each X i is homeomorphic to the open regular neighbourhood O(P i , X i ) of a finite subpolyhedron P i ⊂ X i such that dim P i = n i -1. The product P 1 ×P 2 ×P 3 naturally embeds as a subpolyhedron in the product X 1 × X 2 × X 3 , and it is readily seen that the regular neighbourhood O(P 1 × P 2 × P 3 , X 1 × X 2 × X 3 ) is homeomorphic to the product O(P 1 , X 1 ) × O(P 2 , X 2 ) × O(P 3 , X 3 ). Let now n = dim X 1 × X 2 × X 3 = n 1 + n 2 + n 3 . The codimension of P 1 × P 2 × P 3 in X 1 × X 2 × X 3 is equal to 3, so by Example 11.2.2 P 1 × P 2 × P 3 is locally coamenable in X 1 × X 2 × X 3 . Therefore, the Theorem 11.2.3 implies that, if i ≥ 2 + dim(P 1 × P 2 × P 3 ) = n -1 and h ∈ H lf i (O(P 1 × P 2 × P 3 , X 1 × X 2 × X 3 )), then h 1 = 0.

Let us set m = dim P + 1, and let U be the open cover of O(P, K) given by the family {B n v }, as v varies in the set (P ) 0 of vertices of P . We denote by U| P the restriction of the cover U to P , i.e. the open cover of P given by the family {B n v ∩ P | B n v ∈ U}. Since P is finite, the open covers U and U| P are finite.
