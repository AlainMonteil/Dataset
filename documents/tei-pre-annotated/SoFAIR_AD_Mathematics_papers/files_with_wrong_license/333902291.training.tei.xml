        <p>To contain the outbreak, the Chinese government has implemented large-scale social distancing policies, including quarantine, isolation, and travel restrictions to limit cross-regional population movement and minimize non-essential social contacts. 3,4 Checkpoints were set up at community entrances, major traffic entrances, exit points, and airport stations for temperature screening and travel history inquiry for all travelers. Given the large population size, the extent of the outbreak in the country, and the labor-intensive nature of contact tracing, the Yuhang District in Hangzhou City first developed and launched a smartphone mini-program, known as "Health Barcode", to replace traditional, paper-based access permits; the program was implemented within two weeks of theTo contain the outbreak, the Chinese government has implemented large-scale social distancing policies, including quarantine, isolation, and travel restrictions to limit cross-regional population movement and minimize non-essential social contacts. 3,4 Checkpoints were set up at community entrances, major traffic entrances, exit points, and airport stations for temperature screening and travel history inquiry for all travelers.

        <p>Unlike Hong Kong and Taiwan, which focused on isolating imported cases (and managed them successfully), mainland China and South Korea were stricken with wide community spread early on, which prompted technology and big data to enable health officials to effectively identify probable cases and avoid recall and/or reporting bias. Nevertheless, all four use big data and AI in contact tracing and strict enforcement. Mandatory electronic wristbands, paired with a mobile app, have been issued to some 60,000 travelers arriving in Hong Kong; the device notifies authorities when people under quarantine leave their homes. 6 In Taiwan, the government integrated the universal health insurance database with its immigration and customs databases, enabling real-time alerts of probable cases based on symptoms and travel history. About 55,000 residents have gone under "mobile geofencing" 7 at home, during which the government tracks their cellphone signals with police enforcement. 8 In South Korea, the government broadcast detailed information about infected people's whereabouts with detailed maps. Violators in the above countries/regions face jail time and/or hefty fines whereas in mainland China, Health Barcode focuses on preventionpeople without a green QR code are not able to pass checkpoints. These governments are backed by a phone data and applications were used in Africa to fight the Ebola outbreak. 10 To date, at least 29 countries/regions have introduced contact-tracing apps as a solution for a more targeted approach to lockdown and containment of 
            <rs type="software">COVID-</rs>19. 11 What works in one place may seem implausible for other countries. Apart from the four cases from East Asia mentioned above, most of these apps are voluntary and anonymous, without support from big data and AI, and generating aggregated maps or reports that might not have direct benefit to users who populate the database. Whether or not these apps are successful will depend on large uptake coupled with strong public health enforcement because contact tracing and isolation are a very individualized undertakingone loose "super-spreader" out on the street can cause an outbreak in the community. As an estimate, for UK's "Test, Track, and Trace" strategy to be effective in slowing the spread of the virus, epidemiologists calculated that at least 60% of the residents need to become users of the contact-tracing app. 12 Yet, even in the city-state of Singapore, fewer than one-fifth of the country's population voluntarily used the national BlueTooth tracing app, TraceTogether. 13 These data might be informative to health officials to develop population-based interventions, but the "unit" of contact tracing, case isolation, and quarantine is "individual"inability to "personalize" the benefits for app users might limit the uptake.

        <p>Apple and Google have proposed a Bluetooth based application programing interface (API) that warns participants if their phone has been near the phone of a COVID-19 case; again, it requires wide-uptake for the app to have reasonable impact. Furthermore, because these Bluetooth apps cannot distinguish the level of COVID-19 exposure during the interaction between two users that come in contact (e.g. mask-wearing, shielded cashiers, etc.), both false positives and false negatives will likely to be high. The consideration we are facing, as pointed out by law experts, 14 is not about whether to use big data and AI for epidemic control but how to use them -"sometimes it is unethical not to use available data". 14 In Taiwan and South Korea, the legal basis and data governance structure for responsible accessing and managing personal information during a health crisis was prepared afterApple and Google have proposed a Bluetooth based application programing interface (API) that warns participants if their phone has been near the phone of a COVID-19 case; again, it requires wide-uptake for the app to have reasonable impact.
