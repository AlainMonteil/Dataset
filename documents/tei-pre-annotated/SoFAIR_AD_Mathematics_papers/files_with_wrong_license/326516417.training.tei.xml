        <p>(1) Countries have reacted to the virus by putting in place different public health interventions. These interventions are intended to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19, while also mitigating the potentially disastrous impact on health systems. Each country is choosing different combinations of policy interventions, some of which are more or less stringent. (2) The menu of policy options includes: school closures; workplace closures; public event cancellations; public transport closure; restriction on internal movement; and international travel controls. Combinations of these policy options are colloquially being referred to as 'lockdown'.(1) Countries have reacted to the virus by putting in place different public health interventions.

        <p>The aim of this study was to develop a conceptual framework to help various policy actors, including national and local governments, public health professionals, non-governmental organisations, and researchers, systematically to analyse the health, psychological, social, and opportunity cost harms of COVID-19 policies according to the Cochrane PROGRESS-Plus equity algorithm.

        <p>We built on two previously developed frameworks for assessing the adverse and inequitable effects of public health interventions. (4,9) The Lorenc and Oliver framework describes five categories of harms that may occur when implementing public health interventions without mitigation strategies: direct health harms, psychological harms, equity harms, group and social harms, and opportunity costs. (9) We expanded on this by subdividing the concept of 'equity harms' into the domains specified by the PROGRESS-Plus health equity framework: Place of residence, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Occupation, Gender/sex, Religion, Education, Socioeconomic status, Social capital, Sexual orientation, Age, and Disability. (6) After disaggregating the 'equity' domain, we cross-tabulated the PROGRESS-Plus categories with the remaining four adverse effects domains: direct health harms, psychological harms, group and social harms, and opportunity cost harms. This approach allowed us to (1) identify relevant peer-reviewed and grey literature of previously known inequities and emerging evidence of the impacts of the lockdown measures, (2) conceptualise how specific measures may exacerbate, or lead to, inequities, and ( 3) relate these considerations to potential mitigation measures.We built on two previously developed frameworks for assessing the adverse and inequitable effects of public health interventions.

        <p>Conceptual frameworks represent a network of interlinked concepts in a particular area. They can provide a structure for understanding a phenomenon or subject.(13) Polit and Beck asserted that frameworks can in fact make research more comprehensible, and generalisable.( 14) They are a way to bring together many components on a complex topic, such as COVID-19 related inequity. We drew from the literature on health equity impact assessments (HEIA) to develop and complete a 'proof-of-concept' framework. The World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health highlights the importance of undertaking HEIAs during policy development. (15) We iteratively and reflexively developed our framework to cover two dimensions: 1) socially-stratifying equity factors, and 2) types of harms. These frameworks were developed iteratively through application and testing in systematic reviews, epidemiologic studies, and policy analyses. (4,9,12) After testing our framework on emergent reports of COVID-19 equity harms, we refined it to capture policies (rather than programmes); to function on disparate geopolitical levels; and to capture mitigation strategies. (16) After we developed the framework, we purposively selected from the many emergent reports of COVID-19 policy interventions causing equity harms to demonstrate the application of the framework. We searched the peer-reviewed and emergent COVID-19 literature to identify pre-existing evidence on inequities related to the specific harms associated with a particular lockdown policy. We conceptualised the interplay between a given policy, and its equity harms, by drawing upon this literature, and through expert consultation and consensus discussions. We identified examples of ongoing efforts to mitigate the inequity effects generated by the lockdown measures through expert consultation with the Campbell and Cochrane Equity Methods Group. Systematic review of the literature was not performed given (1) the examples were intended to be illustrative but not exhaustive, (2) ongoing research and evaluation is needed to measure actual equity harms, and (3) the need to provide evidence-informed but timely tools in the context of a rapidly evolving situation to draw attention to inequities.Conceptual frameworks represent a network of interlinked concepts in a particular area.

        <p>We included examples of COVID-19 policies to demonstrate how the new framework could be used. We purposively selected our examples of policy interventions from emergent COVID-19 literature and media reports to cover: each WHO region, a range of lenient to stricter policies, one LMIC and HIC example per PROGRESS-Plus domain, and measures being monitored by the Oxford COVID-19 policy tracker.(2) We applied our framework to each COVID-19 policy case study.We included examples of COVID-19 policies to demonstrate how the new framework could be used.

        <p>Construction and application of the framework demonstrated that each adverse effect, and each equity domain, can interact with, worsen, and be worsened by others. For example, equity factors such as age, place of residence, SES, ethnicity and occupation may all contribute to physical risk of Covid-19 but also be risk factors for disproportionately feeling the effects of certain policy interventions.

We also identified examples of mitigating interventions that have been attempted so far in the COVID-19 response.

        <p>While each policy example and associated equity considerations provide important insights for policy design and implementation, important observations are made from examining trends across the table as a whole. For example, the same harms (food insecurity; violence; loneliness; depression; anxiety; stigma) are repeated across many groups, and are exacerbated by many COVID-19 policy interventions. This is crucial; it shows that inequitable policy options may generate interactive and multiplicative harms. (11,17,18) For example, poorer women living in poorer communities are at higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 due to the need to continue working, and to crowded working and living conditions. Also, if they become infected, they are at higher risk of poor health outcome considering lower access to, and lower quality of healthcare services. On the other hand, lockdown measures put them at higher risks of physical and mental health risks of inactivity, domestic abuse, and lost earnings. Table 1 also demonstrates that certain mitigation strategies may be implemented in response to more than one equity issue, and that certain lockdown policies may act upon multiple equity domains. Most countries have implemented a 'package' of lockdown policies and Table 1 demonstrates the need to conduct such an assessment on each component of the package, to help consider and identify how policies may interact in a way that worsens inequities to a greater extent than had any one component been implemented in isolation.While each policy example and associated equity considerations provide important insights for policy design and implementation, important observations are made from examining trends across the table as a whole.

        <p>There are many health outcomes that accrue inequitably due to race, ethnicity, culture, and language. Health risks and outcomes are often stratified between ethnic groups, with worse health outcomes often observed in Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) populations. This may reflect inequities in the burdens of wider determinants of health such as employment and environmental exposures, discrimination, education, or diet. However, concepts such as inherent or biological susceptibility can be invoked to further discriminate against such groups, leading to further physical and psychological harms.There are many health outcomes that accrue inequitably due to race, ethnicity, culture, and language.

        <p>Education is known to impact on health status due to its relationship with employment, and consequently, income, but also due to the co-location and embedding of other health interventions (e.g. counseling; meal programmes) into educational settings. Education is a fundamental determinant of health and also an effective means of reducing health inequities. Conversely, disruption to education is an adverse mechanism for potentially increasing inequalities; partly by withdrawing the intervention from poorer families, but also because better off families are better able to fill the gap with supplemental homeschooling.Education is known to impact on health status due to its relationship with employment, and consequently, income, but also due to the co-location and embedding of other health interventions (e.g. counseling; meal programmes) into educational settings.

        <p>The original PROGRESS definitions included social capital, which was defined as: "social relationships and networks. It includes interpersonal trust between members of a community, civic participation, and the willingness of members of a community to assist each other and facilitate the realization of collective community goals and the strength of their political connections, which can facilitate access to services."(4) Social capital can act as a determinant of health and also a social buffer, particularly in times of individual or population-level crisis. It can act via psychosocial pathways, it can enhance financial support, or access to resources. (21) Social capital is closely related to socioeconomic inequalities; it is important not to view social capital, which often has an individualistic focus, as an alternative to effective health, social and economic policies to reduce or even prevent inequities.( 22)The original PROGRESS definitions included social capital, which was defined as: "social relationships and networks.

        <p>Many of the included policies, while providing benefits in addressing the pandemic, are simultaneously likely to be generating new inequities and worsening pre-existing ones. Systematically adopting the proposed framework may help to identify inequitably distributed adverse effects, thereby aiding in the development of mitigating policy options in these areas. It may also help with considering the beneficial or harmful impacts of partially or wholly lifting lockdowns, as well as the impacts of the economic recession that will follow the acute response to the pandemic. In the future, it might also provide an input into decisions about when and how to return to lockdown in a second or third pandemic wave.Many of the included policies, while providing benefits in addressing the pandemic, are simultaneously likely to be generating new inequities and worsening pre-existing ones.

        <p>Ideally this exercise could be undertaken using systematically identified, relevant academic evidence, and would have been undertaken as lockdown policies were being planned and implemented. But in many contexts, the most relevant evidence is not open-access, not complete, or non-existent. Due to the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic, grey literature, government reports, media articles, and social media posts may be acceptable choices of 'evidence' of potential impacts in some circumstances for such high-speed impact assessments.( 25) Reports of increased numbers of domestic abuse victims, for example, are important to include in this exercise, even if there is no appropriate systematic review, RCT, or study that has been undertaken on COVID-19 and abuse. Indeed, research on equity is not prioritised under the urgent conditions of the pandemic. Thus, as with any complex public health problem, decisions about interventions integrate the best available evidence with theory and expert judgment. (26,27) Rapid reviews of literature, including research into the impacts of COVID-19 policy interventions on equity, are ongoing, and Cochrane and others are compiling real-time lists of relevant evidence as it becomes available (Table 3). This view is consistent with that of others working to develop COVID-19 policy recommendations using the precautionary principle to protect groups likely to be disproportionately affected. (28,29) Table 3 lists resources that could help in rapidly assessing COVID-19 emerging literature for local, regional, and national contexts, across multiple topics. These sources are live at the time of writing. In our framework, we have in some cases selected supranational examples -such as people living with disabilities who experience incarceration across South America -and in some cases, we have chosen neighbourhood-level examples -such as the Swedish-Somali neighbourhood in Stockholm. This is intentional, and serves as a reminder that an exclusively national-level lens can miss the magnifying impact of important global trends, or, conversely, overlook local-level heterogeneity.Ideally this exercise could be undertaken using systematically identified, relevant academic evidence, and would have been undertaken as lockdown policies were being planned and implemented.

This is intentional, and serves as a reminder that an exclusively national-level lens can miss the magnifying impact of important global trends, or, conversely, overlook local-level heterogeneity.</p>
        <p>Some governments, once they have been made aware of inequities, have attempted to marshal the fastmoving COVID-19 response in order to mitigate them. In the UK, the government has recently made methadone available at pharmacies without a prescription. (30) After initially banning alcohol sales, a French local authority changed their policy after fears that alcohol-dependency meant dangerous detoxification alone during the pandemic. (31) The Swedish government found that multigenerational housing combined with risk groups was causing increased rates of COVID-19 in the Swedish-Somali community, and so made housing available for high risk members of the Swedish-Somali community. (32) In Spain, universal basic income is being considered as an effort to avert coronavirus economic disaster.(33) However, more can always be done; domestic abuse is increasing due to lockdown requirements for victims to stay home with their abusers, (34) and, in Canada, asylum seekers are being turned away due to international travel restrictions.(35) For every example of a mitigating policy intervention, there seem to be many more groups whose needs have been neglected.Some governments, once they have been made aware of inequities, have attempted to marshal the fastmoving COVID-19 response in order to mitigate them.

        <p>The goals, timing, and outcome prioritisation of COVID-19 policy interventions reflect political considerations. For example, political orientation may be reflected in an emphasis on personal responsibility and individual-level behaviour change interventions (e.g. an exclusive focus on individual hygiene behaviours) as opposed to population level measures. Similarly governments with neoliberal orientations may prioritise interventions which preserve the economy. This may manifest itself in political choices to have less stringent or shorter lockdown policies, or in how long it took to lock down in the first instance. Some of these market-oriented decisions may encourage inequities. Even choices aiming to protect health services may inadvertently increase existing inequities in care seeking and health care use. (36) The framework presented here may also serve as a tool to advocate for more attention to be given to equity issues in contexts where they receive less political priority, by exposing unfair and unjust harms.The goals, timing, and outcome prioritisation of COVID-19 policy interventions reflect political considerations.

        <p>The nature of inequities is that they co-exist across different levels of society, and can incur interactive and multiplicative effects among the most disadvantaged. (37) This can be shown by the repetition of inequities across Table 1. For example, inequitable distributions of education disruptions were highlighted in the gender category in LMICs, and also in the education category in LMICs and HICs. The impact of loneliness occurs multiple times as well. The pandemic will likely exacerbate these inequities, tipping those groups already on the margins of society, economic viability, and survival, over a cliff-edge of uncertainty and life-changing adverse effects.The nature of inequities is that they co-exist across different levels of society, and can incur interactive and multiplicative effects among the most disadvantaged.

        <p>There is a serious risk in the COVID-19 pandemic of LMICs bowing to international pressure to make the same policy choices as HICs. This may not be appropriate in all contexts because of variations in baseline risk, resources, health and other system-level factors. (38) Adopting many of the same policy options, such as 'staying at home' is effectively impossible in many contexts, such as informal settlements, crowded dwellings, and those without access to potable water or latrines. The country context will strongly mediate the effects of COVID-19 policy options; the same policies may generate different burdens, and patterns, of inequities in different countries because of contextual and other variations. (39) In considering this, a wide definition of context should be adopted, which could include the socio-economic characteristics of populations, culture, ethnicity, geography, legal environments, health and other systems, social norms, community support mechanisms, and many other considerations which may affect the implementation and effectiveness of interventions. (39) Policymakers should be actively taking these equity groups into account when choosing their COVID-19 policy packages and how they are implemented. When making decisions about COVID-19 policy options, governments should adopt an approach that considers both the benefits gained in transmission reduction as well as the harms accrued (and to whom). When the first and subsequent waves of COVID-19 are dealt with in a reactionary way, this framework can inform the strengthening of pandemic preparedness plans proactively in the future. These decisions could be informed by decision analytic approaches to encourage costs and benefits options to be compared across multiple domains. (40) There are several limitations of this conceptual framework. First, any effort to mitigate inequities risks incurring them. It may also be difficult to operationalise an equity lens for those populations or groups that fall between or among categories. One way to consider particularly vulnerable groups would be to conduct this exercise for a single vulnerable population, such as displaced persons, and work through the entire table for that specific population.There is a serious risk in the COVID-19 pandemic of LMICs bowing to international pressure to make the same policy choices as HICs.

        <p>It must also be remembered that the potential inequitable effects of policies that we identify, and inequities in outcomes, in general reflect underlying structural inequities, which the pandemic has brought into sharper relief. Addressing the underlying social determinants of inequity in parallel is itself an essential intervention to mitigate the effects of this and future pandemics.
