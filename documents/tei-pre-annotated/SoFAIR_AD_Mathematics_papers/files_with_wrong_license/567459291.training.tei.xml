        <p>Precision medicine is a dynamic area embracing a diverse and increasing type of approaches that allow the targeting of new medicines, screening programs or preventive healthcare strategies, which include the use of biologic markers or complex tests driven by algorithms also potentially taking account of patient preferences. The International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcome Research expanded its current work around precision medicine to (1) describe the evolving paradigm of precision medicine with examples of current and evolving applications, (2) describe key stakeholders perspectives on the value of precision medicine in their respective domains, and (3) define the core factors that should be considered in a value assessment framework for precision medicine. With the ultimate goal of improving health of well-defined patient groups, precision medicine will affect all stakeholders in the healthcare system at multiple levels spanning the individual perspective to the societal perspective. For an efficient, timely and practical precision medicine value assessment framework, it will be important to address these multiple perspectives through building consensus among the stakeholders for robust procedures and measures of value aspects, including performance of precision mechanism; aligned reimbursement processes of precision mechanism and subsequent treatment; transparent expectations for evidence requirements and study designs adequately matched to the intended use of the precision mechanism and to the smaller target patient populations; recognizing the potential range of value-generation such as ruling-in and ruling-out decisions.Precision medicine is a dynamic area embracing a diverse and increasing type of approaches that allow the targeting of new medicines, screening programs or preventive healthcare strategies, which include the use of biologic markers or complex tests driven by algorithms also potentially taking account of patient preferences.

        <p>Precision medicine means many things to many people. The concept and terminology "personalized medicine" has existed since 1995, but recently precision medicine has become a ubiquitous term. 1,2 Tailoring the practice of medicine better to use known heterogeneity among individuals has been facilitated by advances such as gene sequencing, computational approaches for large datasets, and linkage of genomic data with longitudinal data. 3 Public funding streams, such as those supporting large scale research programs in Canada 4 and use of whole genome sequencing (eg, Genome England, Australian Genomics and the Center for Personalized Cancer Treatment in the Netherlands) 5 as well as private funding streams, such as IBM Watson 6 and Human Longevity, 7 are working toward broadening the role of precision medicine in clinical practice. Precision medicine is a dynamic and changing area that has transformational systems potential and is increasingly influencing patient care.Precision medicine means many things to many people.

        <p>The premise of this article is that a robust evidence base is necessary to inform reimbursement and appropriate use of precision medicine in clinical practice. This article builds on initial work of the Precision Medicine Special Interest Group to define core issues in value demonstration. 8 In response to the growing complexity in precision medicine, the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcome Research expanded its work on this topic to cover the following three objectives 9 : Describe the evolving paradigm of precision medicine with examples of current and evolving applications; Describe key stakeholders and their associated perspectives, who have an interest in understanding the potentially unique value of precision medicine in their domains; Suggest indicative core factors that should be considered in a value framework that includes assessment of precision medicine.The premise of this article is that a robust evidence base is necessary to inform reimbursement and appropriate use of precision medicine in clinical practice.

        <p>The terms precision, personalized, stratified, and individualized medicine are related terms, with evolving use across multiple disciplinary domains, 2 yet no interdisciplinary consensus has been reached on formal definitions. The lack of specificity around the meaning of these terms has resulted in different stakeholders loosely using whichever term that is "fashionable" or familiar. While there have been many suggestions 10,11 for how to define terms in this space, there is no consensus at a clinical practice or policy level. 8,12 Overall, use of terminology in this area is highly variable, with some stakeholders using terms interchangeably and others feeling strongly about specific meanings, but few terms have stuck more than personalized medicine or precision medicine. It is beyond the scope of this article to formulate specific definitions that would be agreed upon by all stakeholders, but helpful to describe specific uses for these different terms for broader discussion.The terms precision, personalized, stratified, and individualized medicine are related terms, with evolving use across multiple disciplinary domains, 2 yet no interdisciplinary consensus has been reached on formal definitions.

        <p>A fundamental dimension of precision or personalized medicine is identification of subtypes of diseases, most often viewed as driven by knowledge of molecular biomarkers that influence disease presentation, 13,14 although some may include patient preferences in definitions. 12,[15][16][17][18][19] Precision medicine, can involve the use of genomics, biomarkers, or algorithms for different purposes: disease or therapy risk assessment, screening, prognosis, diagnosis, treatment selection, and surveillance or monitoring. Precision medicine has also been used to describe strategies, such as pharmacogenomics, that help better target patient care using known individual characteristics. 20 A less frequently used term is stratified medicine, where success has been found in tailoring treatment to a specific patient subgroup with common molecular characteristics. 19 However, truly individualized medicine is only feasible in limited situations (eg, gene and cell therapies). 12,21 In the absence of a clear definition, we use the umbrella term precision medicine in this article to mean the use of molecular or other biomarkers (or related algorithms) that characterize differential disease risk, severity or ability to apply targeted treatment approaches to a defined subpopulation of patients.A fundamental dimension of precision or personalized medicine is identification of subtypes of diseases, most often viewed as driven by knowledge of molecular biomarkers that influence disease presentation, 13,14 although some may include patient preferences in definitions. 12,[15][16][17][18][19] Precision medicine, can involve the use of genomics, biomarkers, or algorithms for different purposes: disease or therapy risk assessment, screening, prognosis, diagnosis, treatment selection, and surveillance or monitoring.

        <p>The underlying premise supporting precision medicine is the ability to leverage known heterogeneity in a population of patients to improve patient management and outcomes. A defined strategy, or mechanism, is therefore required to realize the application in practice. Such strategies could be a single diagnostic test, for example use of polymerase chain reaction to test for a specific mutation in a tumor (eg, epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase mutation), prioritizing the use of specific treatments (eg, gefitinib). More recently, however, our knowledge of biomarkers is driving us toward broader tests that include dozens or hundreds of genetic variants, often requiring sophisticated algorithms for interpretation and use. 22 With significant developments in new "liquid" detection technologies (that use blood samples rather than tissue), such variants can be identified quickly and with increasing affordability, allowing precise treatment monitoring. 23 As our knowledge continues to grow and become interconnected, precision medicine will further change how we manage patient decisions. Table 1 illustrates some example strategies used in precision medicine, showing increasing levels of complexity.The underlying premise supporting precision medicine is the ability to leverage known heterogeneity in a population of patients to improve patient management and outcomes.

        <p>Our expanding knowledge of biomarkers and the interconnections among them is enabling development of more complex tests sometimes embedded into algorithms. Specific diseases, such as non-small cell lung cancer now have multiple tests available, including epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase, BRAF, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), and programmed death-ligand 1, which can support selection of specific medicines. Where applicable, single biomarker tests are being replaced by multi-marker genomic tests. For example, one of the tests that has helped usher in a wave of broader molecular tests, Oncotype DX, uses gene expression profiling of 21 markers to assess early stage breast cancer patients for risk of recurrence, informing use of adjuvant chemotherapy. 24,25 More recently, a 324 gene panel test using next-generation sequencing (NGS), Foun-dationOne, detects a range of variants to inform a number of care decisions. 26 We are also beginning to consider the implications of different testing platforms, scenarios where nonconcordance of results may occur, and risks of testing that may influence care management. [27][28][29] Advances in NGS are opening the door to interrogation of the entire human genome and exome. Although the cost of sequencing continues to drop, the cost and complexity of implementation in primary care settings are not well described and not yet routinely used in clinical practice, but a focus of intensive ressearch. 30 Clinical practice is beginning to see integration of complex biomarker platforms with population-based data and "smart" decision analytic platforms. Some applications combining testing using NGS with artificial intelligence and machine learning may ultimately have the potential to help chart entire clinical pathways. Vanguard efforts such as IBM's Watson, Human Longevity's Health Nucleus, and Cyft Analytics represent different approaches attempting to incorporate our expanding biomarker data into decision platforms. 31,32 This evolving complexity in the delivery of precision medicine must be considered in value assessment. The more we progress toward integrating precision mechanisms into the standard clinical processes, the greater the requirement will be for equitable patient access and approaches that measure and value all components of precision medicine.Our expanding knowledge of biomarkers and the interconnections among them is enabling development of more complex tests sometimes embedded into algorithms.

        <p>The adoption of precision medicine will affect all stakeholders and touch many health systems levels. This will include individual-level perspectives through societal perspectives (Table 2). Stakeholders will have their own definition of value and requirements for acceptance and uptake. All stakeholders desire technologies to be backed by evidence but there are likely to be variable views on what constitutes "sufficient" or "high quality" evidence, and these elements should be considered in the context of value assessment.The adoption of precision medicine will affect all stakeholders and touch many health systems levels.

        <p>The patient-level can be considered at the level of an individual patient or patient group. This level is likely to reflect preferences of the specific example of precision or the harms and benefits (disutilities or utilities) related to outcomes. 33 However, test results can pose a dilemma at the individual level where a specific patient does not want to understand genetic status (eg, risks for Alzheimer or Huntington disease) 5,34 particularly in absence of effective treatment. This can be compounded by factors like poor awareness, communication, or health literacy. 35 Patient groups have requested that adoption of precision medicine is accompanied by equitable access policies. 10,[35][36][37][38] Some policy protections have already emerged, such as the Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act in the United States. 39 Truly patient-centered policies would link therapies to personal treatment goals and enable input of patient groups. 40 There is also a move toward active patient input at all stages of the precision medicine life cycle. [41][42][43][44] At the system-level multiple stakeholder types have a role in of precision medicine adoption, including manufacturers, providers, regulators, health technology assessment (HTA), agencies, and payers. Most system-level stakeholders view higher certainty of linking the right patient to the right treatment at the right time as the key benefit of precision medicine. However, system players place differential emphasis on certain value attributes of precision medicine (Table 2). For example, payers and policy makers would more heavily integrate value for money as a key benefit of precision medicine.The patient-level can be considered at the level of an individual patient or patient group.

        <p>The patient perspective is simultaneously simple and complex. The patient perspective can be considered at the individual level or at the level of a collective view from patient groups. Patients make decisions about their own care and seek clear diagnosis and selection of the most appropriate and effective treatment that improve the chances for favorable outcomes. Challenges remain in describing the broader value of precision medicine to the patient at the collective level and shared decision-making at the individual level that incorporates patient individual preferences and personal tradeoffs in value and benefit/risk. as pharmaceutical or diagnostic industries, but also new players, such as information technology industries, working to deliver decision support or news to patients. For these industries, precision medicine may offer opportunities, such as focused value propositions, efficient clinical trials, reduced development risk, new treatment targets, or high-margin markets. However, each of these opportunities requires evidence that suggested benefits are realized in practice. 45 For regulatory approval there is a lack of aligned processes for the constituent components of precision medicine, which causes substantial uncertainty in the potential for return on investment. [46][47][48][49][50][51][52] The advent of tests using NGS is likely to compound regulatory approval of precision medicines. Such issues suggest need for modernized approval mechanisms to guide the required evidence base and address evolving development scenarios. [53][54][55] HTA and payer evaluations are even more complex and variable, because there are many more groups involved. Lack of homogenous expectations, resulting from varying national priorities and cultural differences, has resulted in different HTA recommendations on the same intervention. One example is inclusion of epidermal growth factor receptor testing before gefitinib treatment. The manufacturer submitted cost-effectiveness estimates of £23 615 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in England estimated cost per additional QALY at £35 700 while the Scottish Medicines consortium estimated £154 022 per additional QALY resulting in an acceptance and rejection from the same data. 56,57 Such discrepancies are not unique to precision medicine, but reflect challenges to moving innovations to market. As NGS expands, the challenges associated with producing robust evidence of costs and consequences are manifold and are likely to require specific considerations. 8,58 At the societal-level, some aspects of precision medicine such as ethical and legal implications of patient biomarker information and the push-pull incentives of ensuring population-level equity and access to care are more pronounced in precision medicine versus other technology applications. There are already substantial discrepancies in access to and quality of healthcare around the globe and some concern that introduction of precision may further widen disparities in availability and access. 35,59 Although it likely infeasible to address the nuances of each stakeholder perspective, commonalities and exceptions should be carefully considered in evolving a value assessment framework that incorporates issues specific to precision medicine. The The societal perspective can be constrained to a national point of view, or extended to consider the global impact of precision medicine, but for purposes of this paper represents a policy perspective. This policy perspective may be influenced by perspectives and objectives of the systemlevel stakeholders.

        <p>Value assessment frameworks have now become embedded in different countries and jurisdictions, such as the United States (eg, Institute for Clinical and Economic Review), the United Kingdom. 60 Professional societies such as the European Society for Medical Oncology, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research, Inc (ISPOR) have developed their own specific value-frameworks. [61][62][63][64][65] The basic premise of a value assessment framework is to provide a set of methods, underpinned by HTA, and processes to evaluate the benefits and risks, and in some instances costs and added value of healthcare interventions. 66 There is variability among published value assessment frameworks and processes to deliver them, owing to factors, such as perceptions, decision context, validity and reliability, and transparency. Sources and implications of variability are amplified when considering complex interventions (eg, precision medicines) involving variable understanding and agreement on technology language, value drivers and assessment needs.Value assessment frameworks have now become embedded in different countries and jurisdictions, such as the United States (eg, Institute for Clinical and Economic Review), the United Kingdom. 60 Professional societies such as the European Society for Medical Oncology, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research, Inc (ISPOR) have developed their own specific value-frameworks.

        <p>To design value-frameworks for each new type of technology is not practical for agencies who must assess the flood of technologies flowing through evaluation processes and be cognizant of opportunity cost of healthcare service provision. A nontechnology specific approach may however limit acceptance and uptake of innovator technologies that have potential to unlock system efficiencies. Although a generic value assessment framework is likely to be preferred, ideally it should take into account unique value attributes of technology types such as precision medicine.To design value-frameworks for each new type of technology is not practical for agencies who must assess the flood of technologies flowing through evaluation processes and be cognizant of opportunity cost of healthcare service provision.

        <p>Most evaluation processes for precision medicines remain rudimentary for addressing evolving complexity in this space, and there is a literature illustrating challenges. 67,68 It has frequently been argued that value assessment frameworks have not optimally incorporated the impact of diagnostics. 31,69,70 Value frameworks have been developed for evaluating genetic testing in the United States (eg, the Analytic validity, Clinical validity, Clinical utility and Ethical, legal and social implications framework) 71 and United Kingdom (eg, the Gene Dossier); however, they either do not cover broad evidence-related issues of precision medicine highlighted herein or have faced inconsistent uptake. 72,73 Variability across markets and systems also creates uncertainty on the appropriate evidence package required and increases heterogeneity in patient access. 74 Importantly, existing value assessment frameworks for genetic tests are not consistent with methods used for other healthcare technologies, such as pharmaceuticals that take account of opportunity cost. [75][76][77] The purpose of this article is to highlight key areas that a value assessment framework involving precision medicine should acknowledge. It is beyond the scope of this document to propose a specific framework for precision medicine, but to encourage integration of core components that should be considered in precision medicine value assessment or are currently missing from existing frameworks.Most evaluation processes for precision medicines remain rudimentary for addressing evolving complexity in this space, and there is a literature illustrating challenges. 67,68 It has frequently been argued that value assessment frameworks have not optimally incorporated the impact of diagnostics. 31,69,70 Value frameworks have been developed for evaluating genetic testing in the United States (eg, the Analytic validity, Clinical validity, Clinical utility and Ethical, legal and social implications framework) 71 and United Kingdom (eg, the Gene Dossier); however, they either do not cover broad evidence-related issues of precision medicine highlighted herein or have faced inconsistent uptake. 72,73 Variability across markets and systems also creates uncertainty on the appropriate evidence package required and increases heterogeneity in patient access. 74 Importantly, existing value assessment frameworks for genetic tests are not consistent with methods used for other healthcare technologies, such as pharmaceuticals that take account of opportunity cost.

        <p>The performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive value) of the precision mechanism, such as a diagnostic test or algorithm, establishes analytic and clinical validity with significant implications for the clinical utility of precision medicine. Potential for false positive or false negative results can provoke inaccurate care decisions leading to unnecessary testing, suboptimal treatment, avoidable side effects, disease progression or even mortality, and avoidable costs. Although being one of the most fundamental value drivers for precision medicine, uncertainty around test performance is often not considered by agencies administering value assessment frameworks. 79 This is particularly important, as the number needed to test can influence the therapy decision and cost-effectiveness. Other factors such as penetrance, pathogenicity, linkage to patient management and outcomes. 76,79 Beyond performance, consensus on what evidence base is sufficient to characterize clinical utility of diagnostics, remains a key challenge.The performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive value) of the precision mechanism, such as a diagnostic test or algorithm, establishes analytic and clinical validity with significant implications for the clinical utility of precision medicine.

Other factors such as penetrance, pathogenicity, linkage to patient management and outcomes. 76,79 Beyond performance, consensus on what evidence base is sufficient to characterize clinical utility of diagnostics, remains a key challenge.</p>
        <p>Due to historically different decision pathways, agencies may review the "diagnostic" and the "therapeutic" element of a precision medicine separately and different methods or processes for HTA or funding pools for each element are applied. Without integration of evaluation and reimbursement models, there are risks for variable and disconnected assessment of the evidence supporting different elements and if either the medicine or diagnostic is rejected, inadvertent patient access limitations. A more integrated evaluation process should consider implications of using a precision medicine across the care pathway.Due to historically different decision pathways, agencies may review the "diagnostic" and the "therapeutic" element of a precision medicine separately and different methods or processes for HTA or funding pools for each element are applied.

        <p>The disconnect between study designs and reimbursement in the precision medicine arena has been broadly by the ISPOR Precision Medicine Special Interest Group and ISPOR Medical Devices and Diagnostics Special Interest Group over the past several years. 8 Some groups such as European Network for Health Technology Assessment have also looked at study designs for precision medicines. 80 However, in the light of continuing innovation in this area, challenges associated with precision medicine value assessmentThe disconnect between study designs and reimbursement in the precision medicine arena has been broadly by the ISPOR Precision Medicine Special Interest Group and ISPOR Medical Devices and Diagnostics Special Interest Group over the past several years. 8 Some groups such as European Network for Health Technology Assessment have also looked at study designs for precision medicines. 80 However, in the light of continuing innovation in this area, challenges associated with precision medicine value assessment</p>

        <p>There is no general agreement about what a sufficient evidence base looks like for precision mechanism, be it a diagnostic test or a risk-based algorithm. 77,82 Simply applying a process similar to drugs, would ignore the practical and business realities of evidence development in the diagnostic sector (eg, weak intellectual property, lack of value-based payment, commoditization of test payment). 83 A range of nonrandomized approaches for addressing evidence demands for diagnostics have been discussed. 76 Because valuebased reimbursement models for diagnostics do not yet exist on a global basis, expectations for study designs must balance the need to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of tests with the reality of the diagnostics business model. Some agencies with high evidence requirements, such as National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the BlueCross BlueShield Technology Center (named Evidence Street) have over the years softened their stance on diagnostic assessment as they have gained deeper experience in the nuances this technology type. 32 Some agencies have also indicated that they do not have the experience or time to develop diagnostic evidence requirements given competing healthcare priorities, but they would prefer to react to an industry-proposed framework. 84,85 Establishing clear and consistent evidentiary "rules of the road" for diagnostics evidence expectations is important to all stakeholders. 8There is no general agreement about what a sufficient evidence base looks like for precision mechanism, be it a diagnostic test or a risk-based algorithm. 77,82 Simply applying a process similar to drugs, would ignore the practical and business realities of evidence development in the diagnostic sector (eg, weak intellectual property, lack of value-based payment, commoditization of test payment). 83 A range of nonrandomized approaches for addressing evidence demands for diagnostics have been discussed. 76 Because valuebased reimbursement models for diagnostics do not yet exist on a global basis, expectations for study designs must balance the need to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of tests with the reality of the diagnostics business model.

        <p>Different test applications (ie, risk assessment, screening, diagnosis, treatment selection, monitoring) will have different underlying evidence questions and drivers of value. 86 For example, a screening test may have broad use and expose patients to helpful and harmful downstream interventions, whereas a drug monitoring test may simply indicate whether a particular treatment is working. Minimally invasive liquid biopsies used to analyze circulating tumor DNA and circulating tumor cells is a specific example of a precision medicine mechanism that is being studied to identify tumor evolution and better guide treatment noninvasively. 87,88 Some efforts have been made to formulate core questions for each test application type, but significant work remains to align these questions to a fully structured set of expectations per test application. 79 A value assessment framework for precision medicine should provide for appropriate contextual consideration of how the precision mechanism is applied and overall value.Different test applications (ie, risk assessment, screening, diagnosis, treatment selection, monitoring) will have different underlying evidence questions and drivers of value. 86 For example, a screening test may have broad use and expose patients to helpful and harmful downstream interventions, whereas a drug monitoring test may simply indicate whether a particular treatment is working.

        <p>Ruling out disease risks or need for certain downstream tests or treatments can be one of the most valuable implications of precision mechanisms. However, this value aspect is often missed by HTA. In general, despite diagnostics representing only about 5% of healthcare costs, they inform over 70% of healthcare actions, the value of "ruling out" often remains overlooked. 89 As we expand toward broader testing approaches (eg, whole genome sequencing), such information will further broaden the options for ruling out conditions or therapies and should be accounted for in value assessment.Ruling out disease risks or need for certain downstream tests or treatments can be one of the most valuable implications of precision mechanisms.

        <p>Use of NGS as a companion test to a novel ovarian cancer drug approved in late 2016, illustrates how as technology complexity increases, HTA complexity also increases. 90 A recent Market Watch study predicted that the NGS market will rapidly grow to more than $12 billion by 2022, resulting in a flood of complex diagnostics into the global marketplace. 91 Along with increasing complexity, such tests raise novel evidentiary value assessment considerations, including the following highlighted in Table 3. 31,92 At present, none of the implications of broad diagnostic tests have been incorporated into global assessment frameworks, but they have profound implications for patient care.Use of NGS as a companion test to a novel ovarian cancer drug approved in late 2016, illustrates how as technology complexity increases, HTA complexity also increases. 90 A recent Market Watch study predicted that the NGS market will rapidly grow to more than $12 billion by 2022, resulting in a flood of complex diagnostics into the global marketplace. 91 Along with increasing complexity, such tests raise novel evidentiary value assessment considerations, including the following highlighted in Table 3. 31,92 At present, none of the implications of broad diagnostic tests have been incorporated into global assessment frameworks, but they have profound implications for patient care.</p>
        <p>Our ability to broadly leverage biomarkers has enabled novel trial designs that cut across disease areas or enable unique enrichment scenarios. Adaptive and so-called "umbrella," "basket," or "bucket" trials create the potential to determine treatment effectiveness in multiple diseases simultaneously. 23,93 This ability is driven both by approvals of next-generation tests (eg, Founda-tionOne) as well as applications such as the NTRK fusion "driver" mutation treatment studies that span diseases. 94,95 Such studies may involve different patient numbers and approaches not typically involved in historic study designs. Future value assessment frameworks should consider new trial approaches as they will apply to an increasing number of development scenarios.Our ability to broadly leverage biomarkers has enabled novel trial designs that cut across disease areas or enable unique enrichment scenarios.

        <p>Similarly, successful precision medicines have opened the door for an increasing number of therapies going to market with single arm phase II data based on promising outcomes. In these scenarios, observational data collected in clinical practice (called realworld evidence [RWE]) supports a full value package. ISPOR has for some time supported task force activities in indirect treatment comparisons/network meta-analyses regarding approaches to support robust comparisons across different treatments, including single-arm trials. This opens the way for the Precision Medicine Special Interest Group and groups engaged in RWE to collaborate on best practices. This, coupled with the recent ability to leverage the use of RWE in regulatory submissions is altering our expectations for iterative evidence. 76,96 As such launches expand, HTA processes will become increasingly iterative across the product life cycle, and value frameworks must shift accordingly. 84,97Similarly, successful precision medicines have opened the door for an increasing number of therapies going to market with single arm phase II data based on promising outcomes.

        <p>Precision medicines targeting multiple markers in a single treatment are also beginning to evolve. These therapies may be based on DNA, RNA, synthetic peptides, and have the potential to replace existing therapies or combinations. As disease progresses, the process behind these treatments may ultimately enable iterative development of a truly individualized therapy customized to disease progression, creating a novel HTA scenario. 98 Emerging therapies leveraging a "multi-target" approach may improve effectiveness, potentially yielding transformative disease knockdown or cure effect. 99,100 Ability to address multiple targets raises a number of issues for precision medicine value assessment, including factors highlighted in Table 4. Although such therapies are still early, anticipating their unique assessment considerations requires further work.Precision medicines targeting multiple markers in a single treatment are also beginning to evolve.

        <p>A future manifestation of precision medicine can include integration of diagnostic and treatment information with emerging artificial intelligence or machine learning platforms. 101 A range of such integrated applications are currently in development. 31 Other factors such as rapid genome sequencing (eg, the UK 100 000 genome project) may ultimately feed into this trend as information linkages occur. Emerging decision support products may have differing abilities to inform decisions and differing levels of uncertainty. Some may seek direct reimbursement from payers, while others may emerge as subscription platform services. 102 For those that emerge as reimbursable products, they will enter value assessment processes that global systems are ill prepared to address. 17A future manifestation of precision medicine can include integration of diagnostic and treatment information with emerging artificial intelligence or machine learning platforms. 101 A range of such integrated applications are currently in development. 31 Other factors such as rapid genome sequencing (eg, the UK 100 000 genome project) may ultimately feed into this trend as information linkages occur.

        <p>A strong evidence base for precision medicine is clearly important for expanded clinical use. There is a need for concerted effort in defining and applying a relevant and consistent value assessment approach to precision medicine. Next-generation sequencing and evolving decision tools are also pushing the bounds of evidentiary complexity and decision making far beyond early scenarios. 31,103 To develop a value assessment framework and decisionmaking tools relevant for precision medicine requires assimilation of relevant components from existing generic frameworks and specific frameworks applicable to the precision components (eg, diagnostic tests). Such a value assessment framework needs to be cognizant of the implications of using different technologies to address the "precision" component of precision medicine and also of opportunity cost. Any value assessment framework must consider key stakeholders' perspectives and "end-to-end" component elements of precision medicine. This is where the collective efforts of a society such as ISPOR can help to develop approaches relevant for precision medicine (that may be overlaid on existing processes). This may also require input from relevant disciplines, including biomedical research, statistics, economics, and ethics, input from key health stakeholders, and careful consideration of the value attributes specific to this transformational and evolving field, which are not consistently integrated into today's value assessment processes.A strong evidence base for precision medicine is clearly important for expanded clinical use.
