        <p>The novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 has since spread worldwide [1]. SARS-CoV-2 has caused over 3.6 million cases of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and over 250 thousand deaths as on 6 th May 2020 [2]. It remains unclear which trajectory the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 will follow after the initial pandemic wave. One of the speculations is that SARS-CoV-2 will adapt itself to a seasonal circulation like the recent influenza pandemic H1N1/09 virus (H1N1pdm), which was later found to circulate annually in the same season as other existing seasonal influenza strains [3]. For human coronaviruses, there are four known seasonal coronaviruses (sCoV) that have been long circulating in human populations, including two alpha-coronaviruses, NL63 and 229E, and two beta-coronaviruses, OC43 and HKU1. Therefore, it is possible that once endemic, SARS-CoV-2, a beta-coronavirus will follow the same seasonal patterns as the sCoVs. In a recent modelling study projecting the post-pandemic transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, Kissler and colleagues found that recurrent outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in the US would probably occur during wintertime, same as the sCoVs, after the initial pandemic wave [4]. However, the seasonality of these long-circulating sCoVs is still unknown on a global scale. To this end, we conducted a systematic review on the global seasonality of human sCoV.The novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 has since spread worldwide [1].

        <p>Two reviewers (YL and XW) extracted the data from the literature, independently, using a template that was described elsewhere [5]. Briefly, we collected general information from each study including site, country, data source and test method. Geographical coordinates were extracted for the study site. For seasonality, we extracted monthly aggregated number of sCoV cases. We also extracted the monthly number of coronavirus cases by genus (i.e. alpha-coronavirus and betacoronavirus) and by species (i.e. NL63, 229E, OC43 and HKU1). In order to compare the seasonality of sCoV with other two common respiratory viruses, influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus, we also extracted monthly aggregated number of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus cases from each study, if available. For included studies where influenza virus and/or respiratory syncytial virus seasonality was not available, we searched studies that reported data from the same or a nearby site from our previous work on influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus seasonality [5].Two reviewers (YL and XW) extracted the data from the literature, independently, using a template that was described elsewhere [5].

        <p>We also conducted quality assessment for each eligible study using a quality assessment form comprising three brief questions regarding data representativeness, test practice, and timely reporting as described elsewhere [5]. When two or more studies were available for a site, the study with higher quality score was retained with the rest being excluded and marked as duplicate data.We also conducted quality assessment for each eligible study using a quality assessment form comprising three brief questions regarding data representativeness, test practice, and timely reporting as described elsewhere [5].

        <p>We plotted heat maps displaying the activity of sCoV, influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus for each site sorted by latitude.

        <p>For each site, we extracted meteorological data from the site's nearest weather station provided by the US National Centers for Environmental Information using 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> package 
            <rs type="software">GSODR</rs>. [6] We modelled monthly AAP of sCoV activity with meteorological predictors, including mean-centred temperature, relative humidity and dew point, in a LOESS model as described elsewhere [5]. Details of the model are available in the Appendix. Briefly, we included two models based on the model selection results, one model with mean-centred dew point and relative humidity as predictors and the other with mean-centred temperature and relative humidity as predictors. Studies were eligible for this analysis if they reported &gt;100 positive sCoV cases. We conducted two sets of models that excluded two temperate sites in China and included all sites, respectively. This was due to the observation that the sCoV seasonality in the temperate sites of China was less seasonal, different from the rest temperate sites. We did not model sCoV activity by genus or by species due to the paucity of data.

        <p>High activity of sCoV, as measured by AAP, was observed in winter months in most temperate sites (Figure 3), with the exception in China where sCoV activity tended to be year-round (Figure S2).

        <p>More variations in sCoV activity were observed in the tropical sites. No difference in timing of season was observed between alpha-CoV and beta-CoV.

        <p>In the temperate sites excluding China, 53.1% of the sCoV cases (IQR: 34.6-61.9) occurred during influenza season (defined by the top three months with highest AAP) and 49.6% of the sCoV cases (IQR: 30.2-60.2) occurred during respiratory syncytial virus season. Less overlap was observed in the tropical sites as well as temperate sites in China between sCoV activity and influenza/respiratory syncytial virus activity (20% during influenza season and 29% during respiratory syncytial virus season).

        <p>At the time of writing, more than 180 countries have been affected by COVID-19 [2] and it is timely and extremely important to understand the long-term future of SARS-CoV-2. Understanding of the global circulating season of sCoV, the genetic relative of SARS-CoV-2, might provide clues on the possible circulating season of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we described the month-by-month activity of sCoV in 40 sites from 21 countries. We found that sCoV occurred mainly in winter months in temperate sites except for China and was less seasonal in China and tropical sites. We highlighted high proportion of co-circulating sCoV cases during influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus seasons, implicating the possibility of a substantial increase in the demand to healthcare system resources during wintertime.At the time of writing, more than 180 countries have been affected by COVID-19 [2] and it is timely and extremely important to understand the long-term future of SARS-CoV-2.

        <p>Our findings have important implications in the control and prevention of COVID-19. The global seasonality of sCoV provides a clue for the possible circulating timing of SARS-CoV-2 after the initial pandemic. A modelling study reported that SARS-CoV-2 will likely enter into regular circulation starting from 2021 or 2022 in the US and synchronise with sCoV, if immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is not permanent [4]. Although it is not entirely clear how long the immunity to SARS-CoV-2 could last, a recent study showed that most convalescent plasmas obtained from individuals who recover from COVID-19 do not contain high levels of neutralizing activity [9]; of note, immunity to sCoV was reported to wane within one year [10].Our findings have important implications in the control and prevention of COVID-19.

        <p>We observed winter outbreaks similar for all species of sCoV in the temperate sites, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics might occur in winter months in temperate regions. Interestingly, the sCoV activity in the temperate sites of China was observed to be less seasonal, with high sCoV activity seen in summer, autumn and winter. In the temperate sites excluding China, there was substantial overlap between sCoV activity and activity of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus, with ~50% of annual sCoV cases occurring during influenza and respiratory syncytial virus season. This would pose a big challenge to the currently strained health-care systems if SARS-CoV-2, which causes more severe illnesses than sCoV, circulates in the same season as influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus, both of which represent substantial burdens in morbidity and mortality [11][12][13]. In addition, the seasonality of different species of sCoV in our study provides important baseline data for epidemiology and modelling studies in understanding the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and sCoV; a recent study supported the cross-reactive T cell recognition between sCoV and SARS-CoV-2 [14].We observed winter outbreaks similar for all species of sCoV in the temperate sites, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics might occur in winter months in temperate regions.

        <p>However, it should be noted that the interpretation of our findings needs to be made in the context of several limitations in our study. First, although we found that seasonality of sCoV did not differ by virus species, we could not rule out the possible scenario where SARS-CoV-2 adapts itself to a distinct circulating season from other sCoVs. This might be a result of competition between viruses, for example, the observed negative interaction between influenza A virus and rhinovirus [15].However, it should be noted that the interpretation of our findings needs to be made in the context of several limitations in our study.

        <p>Second, none of the included studies reported seasonality results of sCoV by age group.

        <p>One of the lessons learned from the history of influenza pandemics is its transition from pandemic to seasonal circulation and the replacement of existing strain(s) with the pandemic strain.
