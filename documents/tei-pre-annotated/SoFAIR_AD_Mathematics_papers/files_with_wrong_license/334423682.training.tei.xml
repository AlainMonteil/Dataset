        <p>Nuclear dimension is a non-commutative generalisation of topological covering dimension to C * -algebras, introduced in [79]. A unital abelian C * -algebra consists of continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space X ; in this case the nuclear dimension recaptures the dimension of X . At the other extreme lie simple C * -algebras, where nuclear dimension divides the exotic examples of [25,54,65,69] from those accessible to K-theoretic classification. Indeed, through the work of generations of researchers ([19,27,38,48,64,75] building on numerous works going back to [18]), we now have a complete classification of separable, simple, unital C * -algebras of finite nuclear dimension satisfying Rosenberg and Schochet's universal coefficient theorem (UCT) [56]. This provides the C * -analogue of the celebrated classification of amenable factors due to Connes and Haagerup [13,29].Nuclear dimension is a non-commutative generalisation of topological covering dimension to C * -algebras, introduced in [79].

        <p>A major task at this point is to identify simple nuclear C * -algebras of finite nuclear dimension, through establishing the Toms-Winter conjecture ( [21,72]; the precise statement is [79,Conjecture 9.3], and an overview is given in [77,Section 5]). This predicts that finite nuclear dimension is but one facet of a meta-notion of regularity for simple nuclear C * -algebras, with alternate descriptions of very different natures. Classification will then be accessed through regularity, the particular form depending on the example of interest.A major task at this point is to identify simple nuclear C * -algebras of finite nuclear dimension, through establishing the Toms-Winter conjecture ( [21,72]; the precise statement is [79,Conjecture 9.3], and an overview is given in [77,Section 5]).

        <p>In this paper we show that for separable, simple, unital, and nuclear C *algebras, finite nuclear dimension is entailed by the tensorial absorption condition of Z-stability, where Z is the Jiang-Su algebra of [34] (Z-stability will be described further below). Combining this with the main result of [74] gives the following theorem, which was predicted by the Toms-Winter conjecture. Both implications making up this equivalence have striking applications: (i)⇒(ii) allows classification to be accessed via localisation at strongly selfabsorbing algebras [75], while the implication (ii)⇒(i) proven here brings large classes of examples coming from topological dynamics within the scope of classification (see Corollaries E and F below).In this paper we show that for separable, simple, unital, and nuclear C *algebras, finite nuclear dimension is entailed by the tensorial absorption condition of Z-stability, where Z is the Jiang-Su algebra of [34] (Z-stability will be described further below).

        <p>Theorem A Let A be an infinite dimensional, separable, simple, unital, nuclear C * -algebra.

        <p>Let us put conditions (i) and (ii) into context. Tensorial absorption (or stability) phenomena are ubiquitous in operator algebras, originating with the characterisation of properly infinite von Neumann algebras M as those which tensorially absorb B(H), i.e., are isomorphic to the von Neumann tensor product M ⊗ B(H). A major step in Connes' seminal work [13] was to show that injective II 1 factors are McDuff, i.e., they absorb the hyperfinite II 1 factor tensorially, while Kirchberg famously characterised pure infiniteness for simple nuclear C * -algebras through tensorial absorption of the Cuntz algebra O ∞ [38].Let us put conditions (i) and (ii) into context.

        <p>In a precise sense, the Jiang-Su algebra Z is the smallest possible, and so from this perspective the most natural, C * -analogue of the hyperfinite II 1 factor R. It satisfies Z ⊗Z ∼ = Z; moreover, this isomorphism occurs in a particularly strong way, analogous to the corresponding statement for R (see [66]), and Z is the minimal non-trivial C * -algebra with this property [73]. Accordingly, Z-stability is the weakest non-trivial form of tensorial absorption. Moreover, Z-stability is to a vast extent necessary for K-theoretic classification: Z has the same K-theory as C-these algebras are KK-equivalent (think of this as a very weak kind of homotopy equivalence)-and a unique trace. Therefore, under natural restrictions, a simple C * -algebra and its Z-stabilisation share the same Elliott invariant (K-theory and traces).In a precise sense, the Jiang-Su algebra Z is the smallest possible, and so from this perspective the most natural, C * -analogue of the hyperfinite II 1 factor R.

        <p>While all known constructions of the Jiang-Su algebra are a little involved, Z-stability can be phrased entirely without reference to the algebra Z itself. Reminiscent of McDuff's characterisation of R-stability of a II 1 factor in terms of approximately central matrix algebras [45], Z-stability is equivalent to the existence of approximately central matrix cones which are large in a suitable sense [53]. Moreover, for simple, nuclear C * -algebras, via the groundbreaking work of Matui and Sato [43], this largeness can be measured in trace [32]. This criterion has enabled Z-stability to be established in a number of settings where a direct proof of finite nuclear dimension is unavailable [12,20,35,36].While all known constructions of the Jiang-Su algebra are a little involved, Z-stability can be phrased entirely without reference to the algebra Z itself.

        <p>Turning to (i) in Theorem A, one begins by noting that, through partitions of unity, a finite open cover of a compact Hausdorff space X gives rise to a finite dimensional approximation of C(X ). These provide an explicit realisation of the completely positive approximations of Choi-Effros and Kirchberg [9,37] which characterise nuclearity for C * -algebras. Covering dimension is determined by the existence of arbitrarily fine open covers which can be coloured so that no two sets of the same colour overlap; the number of colours needed determines the dimension. 1 A finite colouring of an open cover gives a decomposition of the associated finite dimensional model of C(X ). In the general setting, completely positive approximations can be viewed as noncommutative partitions of unity. The nuclear dimension (and its forerunner, the decomposition rank from [41]) is defined in terms of uniformly decomposable completely positive approximations; i.e., finitely colourable non-commutative partitions of unity. We recall the precise definition in Paragraph 1. 1. In principle, a system of completely positive approximations fully encodes a nuclear C * -algebra A, but extracting information is not straightforward without imposing additional structure on the approximations. 2 With finite nuclear dimension, one can use the uniform bound on the number of colours to transfer properties of the finite dimensional algebras in the approximation back to A, albeit at the cost of suitably loosening these properties, often in a dimensional way (see [52,72,74]).

        <p>When A has no traces in Theorem B, it is purely infinite, and the result is [3, Theorem G] (completing the line of research in [22,44,57,79]). With traces, partial results were first found in the unique trace case [44,58] and then when the trace space of A is a Bauer simplex [3], i.e., has compact extreme boundary. The major technical hurdle which must be overcome to go beyond this setting is a strategy for combining behaviour at individual traces to obtain global properties uniformly over the trace space while respecting the affine structure. 3 We resolve this by introducing a completely new techniquecomplemented partitions of unity-enabling us to perform partition of unity arguments inside a Z-stable nuclear C * -algebra.

        <p>Recently, new techniques have been introduced to verify Z-stability for C *algebras constructed out of infinite dimensional objects where a direct nuclear dimension computation seems out of reach. For example, Elliott and Niu show that crossed products associated to minimal Z-actions of mean dimension zero (in the sense of Gromov, Lindenstrauss, and Weiss) on infinite dimensional spaces are Z-stable, [20]. In contrast, direct estimates of the nuclear dimension, using Rokhlin dimension or similar techniques, only work for finite dimensional spaces [33,61].Recently, new techniques have been introduced to verify Z-stability for C *algebras constructed out of infinite dimensional objects where a direct nuclear dimension computation seems out of reach.

        <p>To obtain (i) and (ii), we introduce the new technique of complemented partitions of unity. For ease of exposition, we will primarily focus on the existence component (i) in the discussion below. With hindsight, the strategy above was initiated in [44] in the case when A is quasidiagonal and has a unique trace, when the existence component (i) is an immediate consequence of the quasidiagonality assumption. An 'orderzero quasidiagonality' result was subsequently developed in [58] to handle the case where A is not assumed to be quasidiagonal (but still has unique trace). When A has many traces, these methods give approximately order zero maps of nuclear dimension zero each behaving well on an individual trace; the challenge is to combine them into a single map with the required behaviour on all traces simultaneously. Via compactness of the tracial state space, T (A), one can find an open cover U 1 , . . . , U k of T (A), and approximately order zero maps θ 1 , . . . , θ k : A → A ⊗ Z of nuclear dimension zero so that θ i models id A ⊗ 1 Z on the traces in U i .

        <p>properties of the e i combine with those of the θ i to ensure that θ is approximately order zero and of nuclear dimension zero. The idea is that θ is obtained by 'gluing together' the θ i over the e i , which should be well chosen with respect to the open cover (U i ) k i=1 so θ has the global tracial behaviour required by (i).

        <p>This was achieved in [3] when T (A) is a Bauer simplex, i.e., the extremal boundary ∂ e T (A) is compact. In this case, continuous affine functions on T (A) are in one-to-one correspondence with the continuous functions on the extreme boundary, and we only need to use extremal traces in the compactness argument to obtain the U i 's. The required (e i ) k i=1 arise via Ozawa's theory of W * -bundles [47]: one takes a partition of unity ( f i ) k i=1 in C(∂ e T (A)) subordinate to the cover (U i ) k i=1 and then one uses triviality of the W * -bundle associated to A⊗Z to produce the elements e i so that τ (e i ) ≈ f i (τ ).

        <p>The uniqueness ingredient (ii) was obtained in [3] under the same compactness assumption on the tracial extreme boundary of A. 6 This uses a detailed analysis of the structure of relative commutants, building on Matui and Sato's groundbreaking techniques for transferring structure between von Neumann and C * -algebras [43,44]. As with (i), a local-to-global argument at the level of traces is a crucial ingredient. Without getting into detail, this again boils down to the existence of approximately central pairwise orthogonal elements (e i ) k i=1 satisfying (0.3) for a suitable partition of unity ( f i ) k i=1 of ∂ e T (A). Fundamental difficulties arise outside the setting of Bauer simplices. Not all continuous functions on ∂ e T (A) extend to continuous affine functions on T (A), and C(∂ e T (A)) need not embed into the centre of the strict closure of A (the starting point for producing (e i ) k i=1 in the Bauer simplex case). Worse, this centre can even be trivial. Moreover, to perform the required gluing argument it is not enough to specify the affine function êi : τ → τ (e i ) that e i should induce. Rather one needs to control e i a : τ → τ (e i a) for a suitable finite collection of elements a ∈ A; cf. (0.3). To address this, one has to understand the subtle question of how C * -algebra multiplication interacts with the affine functions on T (A) induced by positive elements.The uniqueness ingredient (ii) was obtained in [3] under the same compactness assumption on the tracial extreme boundary of A. 6 This uses a detailed analysis of the structure of relative commutants, building on Matui and Sato's groundbreaking techniques for transferring structure between von Neumann and C * -algebras [43,44]. As with (i), a local-to-global argument at the level of traces is a crucial ingredient. Without getting into detail, this again boils down to the existence of approximately central pairwise orthogonal elements (e i ) k i=1 satisfying (0.3) for a suitable partition of unity ( f i ) k i=1 of ∂ e T (A). Fundamental difficulties arise outside the setting of Bauer simplices. Not all continuous functions on ∂ e T (A) extend to continuous affine functions on T (A), and C(∂ e T (A)) need not embed into the centre of the strict closure of A (the starting point for producing (e i ) k i=1 in the Bauer simplex case). Worse, this centre can even be trivial. Moreover, to perform the required gluing argument it is not enough to specify the affine function êi : τ → τ (e i ) that e i should induce.

In the following lemma, think of the equation h n (a, y) = 0 as a condition we want y to satisfy, with a a fixed constant. For example, h(a, y) = ayya describes the condition y ∈ {a} .
