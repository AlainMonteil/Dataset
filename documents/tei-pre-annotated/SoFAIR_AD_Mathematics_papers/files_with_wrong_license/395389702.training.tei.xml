        <p>a We selected low, medium and high illustrative retention levels of 25%, 50% and 80% based on prior experience with trial retention and evidence from the literature. For example, it has been previously stated that it is common for up to 20% trial participants to drop out before the trial finishes (Walsh 2015), as such we set the upper limit of good retention as 80%. The other extreme of 25% was informed by evidence that some trials (largely internet based) can have retention as low as 10% to 25% (Murray 2009). The mid point of 50% was a judgement made by the review team and was deemed appropriate given the evidence for the other parameters.a We selected low, medium and high illustrative retention levels of 25%, 50% and 80% based on prior experience with trial retention and evidence from the literature.

        <p>Randomised trials are considered the gold standard for evaluating the e ectiveness and e icacy of interventions. Poor retention (or high attrition) in randomised trials has serious consequences for the validity, reliability and usability of their results. Missing data, resulting from poor retention, are of particular concern if the data that are not missing are not at random. In other words, if there is a di erence in the amount of missing data between the trial arms or amongst people who are more unwell. However, even if data are missing at random, this is also a potential problem because it will weaken the power of the trial and mean that more participants are needed to achieve a satisfactory sample size. It has been proposed that loss of less than 5% is not problematic but that more than 20% is a serious threat to validity, with anything in between also requiring attention (Fewtrell 2008;Schulz 2002).Randomised trials are considered the gold standard for evaluating the e ectiveness and e icacy of interventions.

        <p>Recent work suggests that up to 50% of all trials have loss to followup of more than 11% (Walters 2016).Recent work suggests that up to 50% of all trials have loss to followup of more than 11% (Walters 2016).</p>
        <p>Missing data from loss to follow-up can be dealt with statistically by various methods including, for example, imputing values based on assumptions about the missing data to give a conservative estimate of the treatment e ect (methods such as maximum likelihood estimation routines or multiple imputation). However, the risk of bias still remains when trials do not collect adequate data to give accurate estimates (Hollis 1999). Loss to followup from randomised trials can sometimes go unreported and using di erent, but plausible, assumptions about outcomes for participants lost to follow-up can change the results of randomised trials (Walsh 2014). However, rather than adjusting for missingness in the analysis of a trial, and inflating the sample size during recruitment, it seems much more sensible to mitigate the problem of poor retention by designing and evaluating approaches and strategies to maximise data collection. Not knowing how best to retain people in trials means trials will take longer (and cost more) and may expose additional patients to unnecessary risk or forgo the opportunity for others to receive e ective treatments. Evidence for e ective retention strategies would enable trial teams to include strategies in their trial which are likely to maximise trial design, e iciency and reduce research waste. This is a substantially revised update of the first full version of this Cochrane Methodology Review (Brueton 2013). The scope of this review is restricted to interventions that are designed to maximise data collection from trial participants once they have been recruited and randomised. The Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines define non-retention as instances in which participants are prematurely 'o -study' (i.e. consent withdrawn or lost to followup), and therefore outcome data cannot be obtained (Chan 2013). However, participants can still be 'on-study' but not provide outcome data. Trial non-retention is distinct from non-adherence to the trial intervention, which refers to the degree to which the behaviour of trial participants corresponds to the intervention assigned to them. There are Studies Witihin A Trial (SWAT) for this (Bensaaud 2020), but it is not within the scope of this review.Missing data from loss to follow-up can be dealt with statistically by various methods including, for example, imputing values based on assumptions about the missing data to give a conservative estimate of the treatment e ect (methods such as maximum likelihood estimation routines or multiple imputation).

        <p>The proportion of participants retained at the primary analysis point as defined in each individual retention trial is our primary outcome. If the primary outcome was not predefined in a retention trial, we took the first time point reported for analysis. In most cases, this was final response. If retention at a number of time points was reported and no clear time point for the primary outcome for the retention trial was stated, we took data for the nearest time point to the intervention in the retention trial analyses. For studies that reported data captured 'without additional chasing' (i.e. no further standard follow-up processes such as telephone calls were included before data collection), this was selected as the primary analysis point for data to be included in this review. For studies that delivered an intervention at trial recruitment, we took the total number of participants in the intervention trial as the number who consented as the denominator and the number retained as the numerator. All decisions about primary outcome timing were based on the retention trial publication and discussion within our team; we did not check study protocols or contact authors for clarification.The proportion of participants retained at the primary analysis point as defined in each individual retention trial is our primary outcome.

        <p>We used the Online Resource for Recruitment research in Clinical triAls (ORRCA, www.orrca.org.uk) database to search for studies that had been published up to the end of December 2017. As the scope of this update had changed from that of the original review (Brueton 2013), we re-ran the full search from database inception rather than only for the period required for the update (which would have been 2013 to 2020). The ORRCA database provides a comprehensive online database of published research (empirical and non-empirical) about recruitment and/or retention to clinical research. ORRCA is populated from an extensive systematic search of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid), SCOPUS, CINAHL, psycINFO, and SCI-EXPANDED and SSCI (via ISI Web of Science). The search strategy used to populate ORRCA was based on the original Cochrane Review of strategies to improve trial retention (Brueton 2013), but updated and extended to ensure capture of all relevant studies in this area (see below and Appendices for details). Eligible articles are categorised on the ORRCA database according to research methods and host study characteristics. We searched the ORRCA retention database in April 2020 to identify randomised evaluations of retention strategies that were nested within randomised trials (including factorial, cluster and cross-over trials), patient preference studies, registries or where the host study type was unknown.We used the Online Resource for Recruitment research in Clinical triAls (ORRCA, www.orrca.org.uk) database to search for studies that had been published up to the end of December 2017.

        <p>As it stands, there is nothing in the evidence base with highcertainty evidence (as determined by GRADE) that can be applied to trials to improve trial retention. The previous version of this Cochrane Review identified monetary incentives as an e ective strategy for improving return of postal questionnaires (Brueton 2013). Whilst the overall findings remained the same in this update (addition of a monetary incentive compared to usual follow-up) with an improvement in retention (RD: 7% (95% CI 4% to 11%), the overall certainty in the evidence was assessed as low, largely due to two of the three studies in this comparison being assessed as high risk of bias. Therefore, further replications of the evaluation of monetary incentive compared to no monetary incentive are still required in well-designed studies. Also, mirroring the previous version of this Cochrane Review (Brueton 2013), this update predominantly identified studies that aimed to improve questionnaire return with a very small proportion (3%, n = 2) of all included studies targeting clinic attendance. There may be several reasons for this large evidence gap. Firstly, many trials that collect patient-reported outcome data do so through selfcompletion of questionnaires which can be administered remotely. It may also be perceived that return of a questionnaire is an easier behaviour to target and change than attending a clinic follow-up visit. However, as face-to-face visits are central to many, perhaps most, trials there is a critical need to identify e ective ways to enhance clinic follow-up. PPI interventions and their impact on trial retention was identified as one of the Top 10 research questions from a James Lind Priority Setting Partnership exercise to identify the unanswered questions for trial retention (Brunsdon 2019). Many of the evaluations in this update fit within some of those questions but they tend to cluster around question 4 "What are the best ways to encourage trial participants to compete the tasks (e.g. attend follow-up visits, complete questionnaires) required by the trial?". There are still very few evaluations of how to encourage participants to attend clinic visits and the same can be said for interventions targeting trial sta involved with retention.As it stands, there is nothing in the evidence base with highcertainty evidence (as determined by GRADE) that can be applied to trials to improve trial retention.

        <p>We are hopeful that through key initiatives such as the PROMETHEUS (PROMoting THE USe of SWATs) project that collaborative e orts in this area will ensure that high-quality evaluations of retention interventions are conducted in a timely manner (PROMETHEUS). More so, specific support from funders such as the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme (UK) and the Health Research Board (Ireland) to provide funding for embedding these evaluations within ongoing trials should encourage trial teams to ensure they develop the evidence base whilst delivering their trials. Future evaluations (of any retention intervention) should also consider economic evaluation. Some trials included in this review did consider cost, with some authors hypothesising what the overall cost reduction could be for the strategy as a whole and others providing more clear examples of cost-e ectiveness by demonstrating cost per additional person retained. For example, Gates 2009 demonstrated that their use of monetary incentives cost £67.29 for every questionnaire returned. Similarly, Cunningham-Burley 2020 demonstrated the cost of using a pen to retain an extra participant was £10.56. These two examples show the potential di erence in costs of implementing retention interventions (both for evaluation and in practice) and, therefore, cost is an important outcome for evaluators to include in future comparisons so as to provide trial teams with the information they need to make a decision on what will work from an e ectiveness and an economic perspective.We are hopeful that through key initiatives such as the PROMETHEUS (PROMoting THE USe of SWATs) project that collaborative e orts in this area will ensure that high-quality evaluations of retention interventions are conducted in a timely manner (PROMETHEUS).

        <p>In addition to these replications, the questions identified in the PRioRiTY II project (which aimed to identify the unanswered questions for trial retention research) should act as a guiding framework to enable research teams to develop interventions to improve retention for which there is community buy-in and desire for evidence (Brunsdon 2019). For example, questions in the Top 10 do consider impacts on trial sta , yet only two of the 68 studies included in this review evaluated strategies targeting sta . Likewise, retention behaviours that go beyond participants returning a trial questionnaire, such as attending a follow-up clinic, also warrant evaluation.In addition to these replications, the questions identified in the PRioRiTY II project (which aimed to identify the unanswered questions for trial retention research) should act as a guiding framework to enable research teams to develop interventions to improve retention for which there is community buy-in and desire for evidence (Brunsdon 2019).

        <p>Reporting: retention trials were o en poorly reported, without CONSORT flow diagrams, clear primary outcomes, sample size, and sociodemographic composition. In the context of this review, this meant that we had to contact authors for unreported data that we needed for robust meta-analyses. Trialists writing their reports should adhere to CONSORT guidelines for trial reporting (Moher 2010), which would facilitate the synthesis of results in future methodology reviews. Guidance for reporting embedded recruitment trials have been developed and these could also serve as a set of guiding principles when reporting embedded retention trials (Madurasinghe 2016). Furthermore, clarity on the intention of interventions with regard to their proposed mechanism of action and reporting on all key aspects (for example using the TiDier framework (Ho man 2014)) is important for future replication and, when available, implementation of e ective strategies.Reporting: retention trials were o en poorly reported, without CONSORT flow diagrams, clear primary outcomes, sample size, and sociodemographic composition.

        <p>To determine whether sending a birthday card with or without a nudge improves retention and completion rates in trials involving children Data Comparisons Intervention 1: Birthday card. Our PPI (patient and public involvement) group felt that the birthday cards should be as personal as possible but not have anything on the front that could be offensive. The front will therefore have the participant's age and a gender neutral image linked to the trial. The message on the inside should be from someone they know, such as the treating clinician, or research nurse at their local site and the trial team. Intervention 2: Birthday card (as in intervention 1), but informed by nudge theory to encourage completion of questionnaires Intervention 3: No birthday card Outcomes Primary: response rate to the participant follow-up questionnaire at the first time point following receipt of the birthday card. Secondary: 1) Response rate to the participant follow-up questionnaire at the 12-month follow-up: 2) Time to response (number of days from date due to date returned) 3) Completeness of primary outcome measure (defined as providing sufficient data to produce a valid summary score) 4) Need for a postal reminder 5) Cost per participant retainedTo determine whether sending a birthday card with or without a nudge improves retention and completion rates in trials involving children Data Comparisons Intervention 1: Birthday card.
