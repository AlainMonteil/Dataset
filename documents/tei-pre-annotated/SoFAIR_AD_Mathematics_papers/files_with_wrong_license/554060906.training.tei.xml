        <p>Background Starting from the final months of 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant expanded globally, swiftly replacing Delta, the variant that was dominant at the time. Many uncertainties remain about the epidemiology of Omicron; here, we aim to estimate its generation time.Background Starting from the final months of 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant expanded globally, swiftly replacing Delta, the variant that was dominant at the time.

        <p>We used a Bayesian approach to analyze 23,122 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals clustered in 8903 households as determined from contact tracing operations in Reggio Emilia, Italy, throughout January 2022. We estimated the distribution of the intrinsic generation time (the time between the infection dates of an infector and its secondary cases in a fully susceptible population), realized household generation time, realized serial interval (time between symptom onset of an infector and its secondary cases), and contribution of pre-symptomatic transmission.We used a Bayesian approach to analyze 23,122 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals clustered in 8903 households as determined from contact tracing operations in Reggio Emilia, Italy, throughout January 2022.

        <p>Findings We estimated a mean intrinsic generation time of 6.84 days (95% credible intervals, CrI, 5.72-8.60), and a mean realized household generation time of 3.59 days (95%CrI: 3.55-3.60). The household serial interval was 2.38 days (95%CrI 2.30-2.47) with about 51% (95%CrI 45-56%) of infections caused by symptomatic individuals being generated before symptom onset.Findings We estimated a mean intrinsic generation time of 6.84 days (95% credible intervals, CrI, 5.72-8.60), and a mean realized household generation time of 3.59 days (95%CrI: 3.55-3.60).

        <p>Interpretation These results indicate that the intrinsic generation time of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant might not have shortened as compared to previous estimates on ancestral lineages, Alpha and Delta, in the same geographic setting. Like for previous lineages, pre-symptomatic transmission appears to play a key role for Omicron transmission. Estimates in this study may be useful to design quarantine, isolation and contact tracing protocols and to support surveillance (e.g., for the accurate computation of reproduction numbers).Interpretation These results indicate that the intrinsic generation time of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant might not have shortened as compared to previous estimates on ancestral lineages, Alpha and Delta, in the same geographic setting.

        <p>The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant emerged at the end of 2021 and was able to completely replace the dominant variant Delta with a swiftness that was unprecedented compared to previously emerged lineages. 1 The exceptional fitness of Omicron is likely due to a combination of competitive advantages, including an increased transmissibility, 2 and the ability to escape the immune response both from natural infection and vaccination. 3,4 The takeover of Omicron was accompanied by peak incidence values that were several times higher than the previous record in most countries of the world.The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant emerged at the end of 2021 and was able to completely replace the dominant variant Delta with a swiftness that was unprecedented compared to previously emerged lineages. 1 The exceptional fitness of Omicron is likely due to a combination of competitive advantages, including an increased transmissibility, 2 and the ability to escape the immune response both from natural infection and vaccination. 3,4 The takeover of Omicron was accompanied by peak incidence values that were several times higher than the previous record in most countries of the world.</p>
        <p>Early after its emergence, studies have indicated that Omicron may have shorter incubation period [5][6][7] and serial interval. [5][6]8 This observation, although based on preliminary evidence, has led many countries to abbreviate the duration of quarantine and isolation 9,10 in the attempt to contain the negative effect of high simultaneous absenteeism on the economy. However, whether the reduction in incubation periods and observed serial intervals reflects a reduction of the generation time, i.e., the time that elapses between the infection episode of an infector and of its infectee, is still to be determined. The generation time is an important parameter for monitoring and modeling infectious diseases. For example, if quarantine and isolation mandates are based on the generation time (as a proxy of infectiousness over time), an underestimation of this parameter would imply an early release of individuals when they still have a high probability to infect others, resulting in a reduced effectiveness of the intervention; on the other hand, an overestimation would imply an unnecessarily lengthy limitation of individual freedoms and increased absenteeism from school and workplaces, with impacts on the economy and the society. Biased estimates of the generation time also impact on the accuracy of the estimate of the net reproduction number, which is a key quantity for epidemiological surveillance, often used also as a parameter for deciding interventions. Finally, the generation time is largely used in scientific research (including mathematical modeling), for applications such as evaluating the effectiveness of interventions, understanding epidemiological dynamics, reconstructing transmission chains.Early after its emergence, studies have indicated that Omicron may have shorter incubation period [5][6][7] and serial interval.

        <p>A direct measure of the generation time cannot be obtained empirically because the infection episodes in a chain of transmission are generally unobservable. Even when some certainty can be attributed to the dates of infection for pairs of infectors-infectee via detailed epidemiological investigation, the observed ("realized") generation times may be biased by the specific transmissibility conditions, including the structure of the study population's contact network, individual behaviors, environmental determinants, and control measures put in place. 11 For example, it is known that the generation time realized in households is remarkably shortened with respect to the one observed in the general community, due to the depletion of susceptible individuals and the competition of simultaneously infectious individuals to find susceptible household members to infect. 11 In contrast to the realized generation time, occurring in a realistic network of contacts, the "intrinsic" generation time represents the generation time that would be observed in a fully susceptible, homogenously mixed population. 12 The intrinsic generation time is therefore less dependent on the specific conditions of the epidemiological setting from which it is inferred but must be estimated with the use of quantitative inference techniques.A direct measure of the generation time cannot be obtained empirically because the infection episodes in a chain of transmission are generally unobservable.

        <p>Evidence before this study We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and medRxiv for manuscripts in English from database inception to May 4, 2022, with the query ("COVID-19" OR "SARS-CoV-2") AND ("generation time" OR "generation interval") AND ("Omicron" OR "B.1.529"). We identified two preprints attempting to infer the generation time of Omicron from the trajectories of variant frequencies at the population level in Denmark and the growth rates of Omicron and Delta in the United Kingdom, respectively. Both studies suggest a significant reduction in the mean generation time of Omicron, estimated at values ranging between 50% and 80% the generation time of Delta. We also found one preprint analyzing 43 infectorinfectee pairs from contact tracing data in Hong Kong that estimated a mean realized generation time of 2.38 days (95% confidence interval 2.01-2.80). This estimate was obtained under very strict control measures (population-wide screenings and quarantine imposed to both contacts and contacts of contacts) that are known to reduce the realized generation time.Evidence before this study We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and medRxiv for manuscripts in English from database inception to May 4, 2022, with the query ("COVID-19" OR "SARS-CoV-2") AND ("generation time" OR "generation interval") AND ("Omicron" OR "B.1.529").

        <p>Using a Bayesian inference model for the reconstruction of the transmission links, we estimated the distribution of the generation time from over 23,000 Omicron infections clustered in about 9,000 households, and diagnosed in the province of Reggio Emilia, Italy, throughout January 2022. Although we found a reduced realized generation time in households for Omicron with respect to equivalent results for Alpha and Delta in the same population (likely due to increased transmissibility), we found no difference in the intrinsic generation time (corresponding to the generation time that would be measured in a fully susceptible population) of Omicron compared to estimates of previous lineages in Italy.Using a Bayesian inference model for the reconstruction of the transmission links, we estimated the distribution of the generation time from over 23,000 Omicron infections clustered in about 9,000 households, and diagnosed in the province of Reggio Emilia, Italy, throughout January 2022.

        <p>These results suggest that the intrinsic time elapsing between successive infections has not significantly shortened for the Omicron variant compared to previous variants and provide insights for further characterizing the transmission patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant and for policy evaluation.These results suggest that the intrinsic time elapsing between successive infections has not significantly shortened for the Omicron variant compared to previous variants and provide insights for further characterizing the transmission patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant and for policy evaluation.</p>

        <p>To mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2, contact tracing activities were carried out in the province of Reggio Emilia, Italy, throughout the duration of the pandemic. Identified COVID-19 cases occurring in the province were confirmed via a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay, reported in real time to the public health service of the Reggio Emilia local health authority, and isolated at home until either a negative PCR test result or 21 days were elapsed. During the study period (from January 1st to January 31st, 2022), both antigenic positive tests and PCR tests were considered for COVID-19 diagnosis. Household members were tested and quarantined at home. After 5 days (for individuals who were fully vaccinated more than 4 months before the date of contact) or 10 days (for unvaccinated individuals), a PCR test was performed and in the case of a negative result their quarantine was ended. If the test was not taken, household members were quarantined for 14 days, as per national guidelines. 13 Contacts with a booster dose or complete vaccination cycle or recovered from a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection in the 4 months before the date of contact were not subject to quarantine and were tested only upon development of symptoms. Compliance with at least one of the tests proposed by the public health service was 97.4% during the study period.To mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2, contact tracing activities were carried out in the province of Reggio Emilia, Italy, throughout the duration of the pandemic.

        <p>Data on test results and symptom onset dates (if applicable) for all identified cases and their contacts were linked to individual records on vaccination history (first, second, and booster dose). Appropriate data quality checks were conducted in strict collaboration with the Reggio Emilia local health authority to minimize missing information and accurately define household clusters. A household cluster was defined as households with at least two positive individuals with a diagnosis spaced less than 14 days apart.Data on test results and symptom onset dates (if applicable) for all identified cases and their contacts were linked to individual records on vaccination history (first, second, and booster dose).

        <p>For the estimation of the generation time, we selected only household clusters for which all dates of diagnosis were included between January 1 and January 31, 2022. To reduce the possibility of missed diagnoses in the households, we further selected households for which undiagnosed members had at least one negative test result. We extended a Bayesian inference model for the reconstruction of transmission links in households. 14,15 The model exploits the temporal information on SARS-CoV-2 infections recorded in the dataset to probabilistically identify, for every infection, the likely source of infection (from outside the household or from a specific household member). Parameters for the generation time, which we assume to be gamma-distributed, are simultaneously calibrated via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach where the likelihood of the observed data is defined mechanistically through the computation of the force of infection to which all individuals are subject over time. The force of infection includes information on the temporal incidence of cases in the general population, on the date of infection and vaccination history for any individual and on previous infection from other variants. For each symptomatic case, the date of infection was imputed by subtracting the time of symptom onset by a randomly sampled incubation period from the estimated distribution. The imputed dates of infection for symptomatic individuals defined a distribution of delays between infection and diagnosis (diagnostic delay distribution), which was used to impute the date of infection of asymptomatic individuals starting from their date of diagnosis. For both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, we set to zero the probability of imputed dates of infection that preceded the latest negative test result. The sampling of infection dates was repeated 100 times and the Bayesian model was re-calibrated on each resampling. Credible intervals (CrI) for the estimated parameters were obtained from the 95% percentile of the resulting pooled distributions.For the estimation of the generation time, we selected only household clusters for which all dates of diagnosis were included between January 1 and January 31, 2022.

All sensitivity analyses yielded comparable results with respect to the distribution of the intrinsic generation time (Figure 3), with 95% confidence intervals broadly overlapping with the baseline estimate, except for a significantly shorter mean estimate (5.09 days) obtained when assuming no compliance to household quarantines. The longest mean realized household generation time (3.96 days) was estimated under the assumption of an incubation period equal to the one estimated for Delta, while the shortest (3.24 days) was estimated when considering only unvaccinated individuals.The robustness of these estimates was tested against several sensitivity analyses regarding selected subsets of the sample (sensitivity analyses a and b), alternative imputation methods for infection times (c-f) and alternative modelling assumptions (g-j; see Appendix for full details).

        <p>The mean household serial interval in the baseline analysis was 2.38 days (95%CrI of the mean: 2.30-2.47 days), with 51.1% (95%CrI: 45.5-55.7%) of transmission episodes being pre-symptomatic (i.e., secondary cases transmitted by cases who would develop symptoms after the transmission episode). The mean household serial intervals estimated in sensitivity analysis ranged between 1.89 and 2.38 days (Appendix), while the mean proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission ranged between 51% and 59%, comparable to the baseline estimate.The mean household serial interval in the baseline analysis was 2.38 days (95%CrI of the mean: 2.30-2.47 days), with 51.1% (95%CrI: 45.5-55.7%) of transmission episodes being pre-symptomatic (i.e., secondary cases transmitted by cases who would develop symptoms after the transmission episode).

        <p>We analyzed comprehensive data collected during contact tracing activities on over 23,000 SARS-CoV-2 cases distributed in about 9,000 households from the province of Reggio Emilia, Italy, between January 1 and 31, 2022. Our estimate of the mean generation time (mean: 6.8 days) is compatible with previous estimates for ancestral lineages 18 (including a previous estimate for Italy of 6.7 days 19 ). Existing estimates for Alpha and Delta were in the same range in a study similar to the present one on the same study population in Italy (6.0 and 6.6 days respectively 15 ). We also found a mean household serial interval of 2.38 days, shorter than previous estimates for Delta of 2.56 on a similar study population. 15 Available studies have suggested a shorter generation time of Omicron (between 50% and 80% the one of Delta) using population-level data on the growth rate of Omicron relative to Delta in Denmark 20 and United Kingdom. 21 An analysis of 43 infectorinfectee pairs from contact tracing data in Hong Kong 22 estimated a mean realized generation time of 2.38 days (95% confidence interval 2.01-2.80) under very strict control measures (population-wide screenings and quarantine imposed to both contacts and contacts of contacts) that are known to reduce the realized generation time. Generalization of epidemiological estimates Figure 1. Illustrative example of a household cluster. A household with 5 members, of which #4 (asymptomatic) was infected outside the household (in the general community) and then transmitted to cases #5 and #3 (both symptomatic). Case #3 infected #2 while #1 remained uninfected. #3, #2 and #1 were vaccinated with 1 dose, 2 doses, and 2 doses + booster respectively. In the bottom part of the figure, we show examples of the temporal intervals of interest for this work. Note that for the household serial interval and the realized household generation time, the source of infection (whether from outside the household or from a household member, and, in the latter case, which household member) is also unobserved and needs to be probabilistically reconstructed. The intrinsic generation time is not displayed as it represents the distribution of generation times among infections occurring in the general population in a fully susceptible population. 11 to different geographic contexts and conditions (and therefore their direct comparison) always needs to be made with caution. We believe that the provided estimate may be representative for places with similar socio-economic conditions and housing structure. For example, the mean number of residents per housing unit is similar between Reggio Emilia and the rest of Italy (Reggio Emilia: 2.44; Italy: 2.42; national range across NUTS1 aggregations: 2.31-2.67) and similarly for the mean number of residents per room (Reggio Emilia: 0.55; Italy: 0.57; national range across NUTS1 aggregations: 0.54-0.63). 23 However, other factors such as seasonality in transmission, mitigation measures, testing efficiency, or the progression of the vaccination campaign may make direct comparison of estimates performed at different times problematic, even when they come from the same study population.We analyzed comprehensive data collected during contact tracing activities on over 23,000 SARS-CoV-2 cases distributed in about 9,000 households from the province of Reggio Emilia, Italy, between January 1 and 31, 2022.

        <p>The result that the intrinsic generation time of the Omicron variant in Italy is not significantly shorter than previous lineages may be surprising with respect to the intuition suggested by repeated observations of shorter incubation periods [5][6][7] and serial intervals 5,6,8 (the latter also confirmed by this study). Realized serial intervals in households and other small-population settings such as schools, workplaces, hospital wards and nursing homes, may be a biased proxy for the intrinsic generation time since they depend strongly on the epidemiological conditions of the study population 11,12 ; in particular, they tend to be shorter when transmissibility is higher (as in the case of the Omicron variant) because the competition for susceptible individuals is stronger. 12 For example, simulating transmission in households through a simple generative model where we imposed a mean generation time of 6.9 days, the mean realized generation time in households turned out to be 4.7 days because of this competition effect (see Appendix). On the other hand, the incubation period only reflects a clinical condition (development of symptoms) that is known to be poorly correlated to infectiousness for COVID-19, given the large proportion of infections transmitted by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals. The duration of viral shedding is likely a Reported parameters of shape and scale for the incubation period and intrinsic generation time refer to a gamma distribution. Estimates of the incubation period are derived from the analysis of 80 participants to a single superspreading event in Norway. Data taken from Brandal et al. 5 better biological proxy of the intrinsic generation time, as it is more closely related to the intrinsic infectiousness of an infected individual. 24 Several studies have found a similar duration of viral shedding for Omicron and other variants, [25][26][27] in agreement with the conclusions from our study.The result that the intrinsic generation time of the Omicron variant in Italy is not significantly shorter than previous lineages may be surprising with respect to the intuition suggested by repeated observations of shorter incubation periods [5][6][7] and serial intervals 5,6,8 (the latter also confirmed by this study).

        <p>A main strength of this work consists in the very large population-based dataset that comprehensively covers household clusters observed in the province of Reggio Emilia. Public health officials made efforts to have high compliance to testing policies (97.4% of individuals who were offered a test accepted at least once), including testing all household members of cases at the date of the first diagnosis in the household. However, the following limitations should be taken into consideration to interpret our results. First, the main analysis relied on cases diagnosed during the study period. The prevalence of the Omicron variant in the region (Emilia-Romagna) was 80% among infections diagnosed on January 3, 2022, rising to 99% among infections diagnosed on January 17 and 31 28 ; more specifically, over 97% of infections diagnosed in Italy on January 31 were classified as Omicron sublineage BA.1. 28 Therefore, it cannot be excluded that a minority of cases in our sample belonged to other variants. However, a sensitivity analysis performed on 380 households (1,127 cases) for which a case was genotyped as Omicron yielded compatible results. Second, the model relies on assumptions for the dates of infection of infected individuals; nonetheless, estimates were substantially robust with respect to different imputations of the dates of infection (i.e., by using the incubation period estimated for Delta, different distributions of the diagnostic delay for asymptomatic individuals, and allowing the possibility of false negative test results, see Figure 3 and Appendix). The same intrinsic limitation of the unobservability of infection times is shared by all transmission chain reconstruction models, but there are now several examples where these models have been proven to correctly identify the transmission dynamics of infectious outbreaks. 29,30 It is also important to stress that for traced contacts, the detection of symptoms was done at the time of diagnosis; as such, if symptoms appeared in the days following the positive swab, the infected individual was recorded as asymptomatic. Another specific limitation is that compliance to quarantine protocols is unknown; we assumed 100%, i.e., that household members quarantined after diagnosis of another member could only be infected within the household. If compliance was imperfect in the considered population, infected household members may have contracted the infection from the general community, especially considering the very high incidence observed in January 2022 in Italy. A sensitivity analysis where quarantines of household members are not considered (i.e., 0% compliance) yielded a significantly shorter mean intrinsic generation time (5.1 vs 6.8 days), because in this case longer generation times that were attributed to potential household infectors in the baseline analysis are preferentially attributed to an importation from the general community. As a result, the mean estimate of the intrinsic generation time may be shorter than the baseline if compliance to quarantine decreased during the period when Omicron was dominant. Lower compliance to quarantine is possible because the lower severity of the Omicron wave in Italy and a general relaxation of control measures induced a lower perception of risk. Considering the ability of Omicron to escape the immune response from vaccination, we assumed no reduction in transmissibility for vaccinated individuals. However, relaxing such assumption by halving the transmissibility for vaccinated individuals yielded shorter yet comparable results in the mean estimate of the intrinsic generation time (6.1 days). Additional sensitivity analysis investigating uncertainties on the transmissibility of asymptomatic individuals, or on the absence of cross-protection from previous infections with other lineages did not affect the main results significantly (Appendix).A main strength of this work consists in the very large population-based dataset that comprehensively covers household clusters observed in the province of Reggio Emilia.
