        <p>The incubation period distribution may be modelled with a lognormal distribution with pooled mu and sigma parameters (95% CIs) of 1.63 (95% CI 1.51 to 1.75) and 0.50 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.55), respectively. The corresponding mean (95% CIs) was 5.8 (95% CI 5.0 to 6.7) days. It should be noted that uncertainty increases towards the tail of the distribution: the pooled parameter estimates (95% CIs) resulted in a median incubation period of 5.1 (95% CI 4.5 to 5.8) days, whereas the 95th percentile was 11.7 (95% CI 9.7 to 14.2) days. Conclusions The choice of which parameter values are adopted will depend on how the information is used, the associated risks and the perceived consequences of decisions to be taken. These recommendations will need to be revisited once further relevant information becomes available. Accordingly, we present an R Shiny app that facilitates updating these estimates as new data become available.The incubation period distribution may be modelled with a lognormal distribution with pooled mu and sigma parameters (95% CIs) of 1.63 (95% CI 1.51 to 1.75) and 0.50 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.55), respectively.

        <p>Reliable estimates of the incubation period are important for decision-making around the control of infectious diseases in human populations. Knowledge of the incubation period can be used directly to inform decision-making around infectious disease control. For example, the maximum incubation period can be used to inform the duration of quarantine, or active monitoring periods of people who have been at high risk of exposure. Estimates of the duration of the incubation period, coupled with estimates of the latent period, serial interval or generation times, may help infer the duration of the presymptomatic infectious period, which is important in understanding both the transmission of infection and opportunities for control. 1 Finally, decision-making in the midst of a pandemic often relies on predicted events, such as daily number of new infections, from mathematical models. Such models depend on key input parameters relevant to the transmission of the specific infectious disease. It is important that input parameters into such models are as robust as possible. Given that some models fit data to many parameters, only some of which are specifically of interest but all of which are interdependent, output estimates may be compared with the robust estimates as part of the validation of the model.Reliable estimates of the incubation period are important for decision-making around the control of infectious diseases in human populations.

        <p>Open access incubation periods are often poorly referenced, inconsistent or based on limited data. 2 To date, many COVID-19 models have used input values from a single study. The decision on which study to use may vary from model to model. Recently, a systematic review of the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 reported that estimates of the central tendency of the incubation period ranged from 4 to 6 days. 3 However, to the authors' knowledge, no studies have yet sought to estimate the incubation period through a meta-analysis of data available to date. Furthermore, it is important to note that incubation periods are expected to vary across individuals within the population. For this reason, it is critically important to understand the variation in incubation periods (ie, the distribution) within the population. However, a single measure of central tendency (ie, mean or median) cannot adequately represent this variation. 4 To address this, studies often fit mathematical distributions to incubation period data.Open access incubation periods are often poorly referenced, inconsistent or based on limited data. 2 To date, many COVID-19 models have used input values from a single study.

        <p>We hypothesised that a pooled estimate of the distribution of incubation periods could be obtained through a meta-analysis of data published to date. Therefore, the aim of this study was to conduct a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of estimates of the incubation periods of COVID-19, defined as the period of time (in days) from virus exposure to the onset of symptoms. Specifically, we aimed to find a pooled estimate for the parameters of an appropriate distribution that could be subsequently used as an input in modelling studies and that might help quantify uncertainty around the key percentiles of the distribution as an aid to decision-making.We hypothesised that a pooled estimate of the distribution of incubation periods could be obtained through a meta-analysis of data published to date.

        <p>A survey of the literature between 1 December 2019 and 8 April 2020 for all countries was implemented using the following search strategy. Publications on the electronic databases PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Cochrane Library as well as the preprint servers MedRxiv and BioRxiv were searched with the following keywords: 'Novel coronavirus' OR 'SARS-CoV-2' OR '2019-nCoV' OR 'COVID-19' AND 'incubation period' OR 'incubation' (online supplementary table S1). The dynamic curated PubMed database 'LitCovid' was also monitored, in addition to national and international government reports. No restrictions on language or publication status were imposed so long as an English abstract was available. Articles were evaluated for data relating to the aim of this review, and all relevant publications were considered for possible inclusion. Bibliographies within these publications were also searched for additional resources. The initial searches were carried out by three of the investigators (ÁC, KH, FB).

        <p>Initial study appraisal and selection for meta-analysis Results of searches were screened in two stages. First, titles and abstracts were screened, and only relevant articles retained. Studies were removed if they dealt with specific cohorts of cases that did not reflect the overall population. Next, articles were read in detail, studies were selected for meta-analysis if they reported either the parameters and CIs of the distributions fit to the data, or sufficient information to facilitate calculation of those values. Specifically, this included studies that reported: the point estimate and CIs or SEs of each parameter; the mean and SD on the original (non-transformed) scale with CIs; the mean and one or more percentiles of the distribution (with CIs); or two or more percentiles of the distribution (with CIs). Studies were excluded if they described the distribution (eg, with mean, median, percentile) but did not report any uncertainty around that figure. The selection of studies to include in the meta-analysis was conducted by the primary author (CM).Initial study appraisal and selection for meta-analysis Results of searches were screened in two stages.

        <p>Once studies were shortlisted, two authors (CM, SJM) independently conducted appraisals of study quality. To the authors' knowledge, no quality assessment tools are available to appraise studies reporting the incubation period of infectious disease. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for assessing the quality of non-randomised studies in meta-analyses 6 as a basis and modified it according to important quality and reporting indicators for studies investigating incubation period. In particular, fields were added which assessed the accuracy and precision with which the exposure windows were defined. Fields relevant to non-exposed cohorts were removed. Finally, we replaced the 'star' system with a lettered categorical system for each item on the scale. The modified scale is provided as online supplementary material. After both authors had appraised the studies, the results were compared and differences in scores resolved through discussion until a consensus was reached.Once studies were shortlisted, two authors (CM, SJM) independently conducted appraisals of study quality.

        <p>The initial pooled estimate of mu from this data set (ie, data set 1, n=8 studies) was 1.66 (1.55, 1.76) and the pooled estimate of sigma was 0.48 (0.42, 0.54). The I 2 values were 75% and 56% for mu and sigma, respectively. Egger's tests for mu and sigma were not statistically significant; p=0.31 and p=0.20 for mu and sigma, respectively. However, evaluation of the funnel plots (online supplementary figures S1 and S2) suggests the potential for bias associated with one of the studies included in the analysis. 30 Evaluation of the meta-analyses results for mu demonstrated that two studies were responsible for much of the heterogeneity in the analysis of this value. In particular, the values reported by Ma et al 30 and Backer et al 34 were higher than the estimates from other studies. Both studies were further evaluated to determine whether these differences may have been due to methodological differences. The Backer et al 34 study was subsequently excluded since it appeared that the exposure window was somewhat imprecisely defined which would have biased this estimate upwards. Conversely, the study reported by Ma et al 30 used only patients where the exposure window was 3 days or less, with the majority of those of a 1 day duration.

        <p>For the purpose of this study we defined incubation period as the time in days from the point of COVID-19 exposure to the onset of symptoms. Online supplementary figure S3 shows a schematic of this time period with respect to other key parameters influencing COVID-19 transmission. Studies to determine incubation period are likely most precise during the early phase of the outbreak, before the pathogen is widespread. 26 During this early phase, exposure windows can be determined with some confidence. Most studies achieved this by conducting the analysis based on travellers from an epicentre of infection (Wuhan) to another country/region that was free from infection at that time point or in the very early stages of the outbreak.For the purpose of this study we defined incubation period as the time in days from the point of COVID-19 exposure to the onset of symptoms.

        <p>By definition, the required case data for the determination of individual incubation periods need to include both exposure (window) and onset of symptoms. Precisely estimating these events can be difficult. Symptom onset is based on case recall, whereas exposure is determined either from: movement history, thereby providing a window prior to movement of potential exposure, or a known window of exposure (from earliest to latest) to a confirmed case (close contact). However, exposure and/or symptom onset are rarely observed exactly. The methods used to deal with this include restricting the analysis to data from patients where the exposure window could be narrowed to a short window (eg, &lt;3 days); taking a median point from the exposure window to determine the exposure time point. Alternatively, Linton et al 29 included left exposure dates as parameters to be fitted in the model.

        <p>After the initial meta-analysis we decided to remove the Backer et al 34 study from the pooled estimate. The estimates from that study were found to be shifted considerably to the right compared with other estimates. Examination of that study identified that many of the patients had long exposure windows which would be expected to bias the estimate upwards. Interestingly, that study conducted an additional subset analysis of patients whose exposure windows were well defined and for these data, the mean incubation period dropped from 6.4 to 4.5 days. However, it is interesting to note that Ma et al 30 restricted their analysis to patients with a 3-day exposure window and still found a mean incubation period of 7.4 days. Since this study had the largest sample size (n=587), it has a significant impact on the estimation of the lognormal parameters. Repeating the meta-analysis with both the Backer et al 34 and Ma et al 30 studies removed results in values of 1.58 (1.51, 1.64) and 0.47 (0.42, 0.53), respectively. With both of these studies removed the I 2 values drop to 0% for both parameters. The corresponding mean and median are 5.48 and 4.85 days, respectively. Interestingly, removing this study also increases the precision of the estimate of the value for mu.After the initial meta-analysis we decided to remove the Backer et al 34 study from the pooled estimate.

        <p>One of the weaknesses of our approach is that we extracted and analysed the parameters of the lognormal distribution independently. However, in reality the parameters and the initial distribution that they are fitted to are linked. We were unable to include two studies that did not fit lognormal distributions to the data. However, figure 6 demonstrates that the impact of removing these studies is likely to be small since they are similar to the pooled estimate, with one falling to the left of the pooled estimate, and the other falling to the right. Ideally, we Open access would have fit distributions to the raw data available from each of the studies, in a way that facilitated the distributions to vary across studies. Such an approach was taken by Lessler et al 2 in reviewing acute respiratory viral infections. However, the raw data were not available in all cases for the studies that we examined. Another limitation is that many of the papers included in this study used publicly available data to estimate incubation period. Therefore, there is a reasonable chance that several of the analyses have reused at least some of the same data. In these cases, the studies would not be independent of each other. Finally, since this study was conducted as a rapid review, we did not seek raw data from studies that were excluded, nor did we seek to translate studies that were not published in English. However, we provide an R Shiny app (https:// mcaloon-ucd. shinyapps. io/ shiny2/) which facilitates testing the sensitivity of our pooled estimate to the inclusion of a single new study. This analysis demonstrates that our pooled estimate is largely unaffected by new estimates. Trialling the inclusion of a new study that reports considerably different estimates of the incubation period has very little impact on the overall pooled estimate.One of the weaknesses of our approach is that we extracted and analysed the parameters of the lognormal distribution independently.

        <p>Comparison with values used in epidemiological modelling studies It is worth noting that the parameter values from our meta-analysis are somewhat higher than previously used in modelling studies. For example, Ferguson et al 38 used a mean of 5.1 days for incubation period, citing two previous studies. 29 37 Mean incubation period from our meta-analysis was 5.8. Tuite et al, 39 on the other hand, used an incubation period of 5.0 days citing the study by Lauer et al. 27 This figure (5.0 days) was the median incubation period reported from that study, 27 which is much closer to the median estimate of 5.1 days from our meta-analysis.Comparison with values used in epidemiological modelling studies It is worth noting that the parameter values from our meta-analysis are somewhat higher than previously used in modelling studies.

        <p>It is reasonable to assume that the incubation period estimated here should be relatively generalisable across different populations: unlike parameters such as serial interval, for example, incubation period depends only on the interaction between the virus and the host, which is expected to be similar across populations, and not on behavioural factors such as frequency of contacts which might be expected to vary across different countries. However, there is potential for a number of biases in these data which may impact on their external validity: in order to accurately estimate incubation period, it is possible that well-characterised cases may be preferentially chosen The median days for each percentile are shown along with the minimum and maximum values for that percentile. reduce the impact of prolonged exposure windows. It is possible that such cases could be biased towards more severe cases. In that case, the estimate for incubation period could be biased downwards, since it is possible that the incubation period could be shorter in more severely affected individuals. Furthermore, these well-characterised cases (ie, those cases where exposure windows and dates of symptom onset are determined with a high degree of certainty) may not have been representative of all cases (often male, often younger 34 ), highlighting the need for information on incubation period from older people, people with comorbidities, from women and those with mild symptoms. These findings are mostly based on studies from Chinese patients. While the incubation period for a given set of circumstances should be similar across different populations, there may be factors that might impact on incubation period, such as infectious dose, for example, that might vary between populations (and possibly within populations over the course the outbreak), meaning that the resulting distribution may vary for different populations, or potentially at different stages of the outbreak. Incubation periods may also be different for people of different ages. 13 Finally, a recent study has also suggested that patients undergoing surgery during the incubation period may have an accelerated progression to clinical signs, suggesting that those experiencing severe stresses during the incubation period may have a shorter time to the onset of clinical signs. 40It is reasonable to assume that the incubation period estimated here should be relatively generalisable across different populations: unlike parameters such as serial interval, for example, incubation period depends only on the interaction between the virus and the host, which is expected to be similar across populations, and not on behavioural factors such as frequency of contacts which might be expected to vary across different countries.

        <p>Based on available evidence, we find that the incubation period distribution may be modelled with a lognormal distribution with pooled mu and sigma parameters of 1.63 (1.51, 1.75) and 0.50 (0.45, 0.55), respectively. It should be noted that uncertainty increases towards the tail of the distribution (figure 4 and table 2). The choice of which parameter values are adopted will depend on how the information is used, the associated risks and the perceived consequences of decisions to be taken. The corresponding mean was 5.8 days and the median was 5.1 days. These recommendations will need to be revisited once further relevant information becomes available.
