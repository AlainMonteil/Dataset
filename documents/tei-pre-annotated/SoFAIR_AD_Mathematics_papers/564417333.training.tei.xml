        <p>The positive Grassmannian Gr ≥0 k,n is a cell complex consisting of all points in the real Grassmannian whose Plücker coordinates are non-negative. In this paper we consider the image of the positive Grassmannian and its positroid cells under two different maps: the moment map μ onto the hypersimplex [31] and the amplituhedron map Z onto the amplituhedron [6]. For either map, we define a positroid dissection to be a collection of images of positroid cells that are disjoint and cover a dense subset of the image. Positroid dissections of the hypersimplex are of interest because they include many matroid subdivisions; meanwhile, positroid dissections of the amplituhedron can be used to calculate the amplituhedron's 'volume', which in turn computes scattering amplitudes in N = 4 super Yang-Mills. We define a map we call T-duality from cells of Gr ≥0 k+1,n to cells of Gr ≥0 k,n and conjecture that it induces a bijection from positroid dissections of the hypersimplex k+1,n to positroid dissections of the amplituhedron A n,k,2 ; we prove this conjecture for the (infinite) class of BCFW dissections.

        <p>In 1987, the foundational work of Gelfand-Goresky-MacPherson-Serganova [31] initiated the study of the Grassmannian and torus orbits in the Grassmannian via the moment map and matroid polytopes, which arise as moment map images of (closures of) torus orbits. Classifying points of the Grassmannian based on the moment map images of the corresponding torus orbits leads naturally to the matroid stratification of the Grassmannian. The moment map image of the entire Grassmannian Gr k+1,n is the (n -1)-dimensional hypersimplex k+1,n ⊆ R n , the convex hull of the indicator vectors e I ∈ R n where I ∈ [n] k+1 . Over the last decades there has been a great deal of work on matroid subdivisions of the hypersimplex [39,45,61]; these are closely connected to the tropical Grassmannian [36,61,63] and the Dressian [36], which parametrizes regular matroidal subdivisions of the hypersimplex.In 1987, the foundational work of Gelfand-Goresky-MacPherson-Serganova [31] initiated the study of the Grassmannian and torus orbits in the Grassmannian via the moment map and matroid polytopes, which arise as moment map images of (closures of) torus orbits.

        <p>The matroid stratification of the real Grassmannian is notoriously complicated: Mnev's universality theorem says that the topology of the matroid strata can be as bad as that of any algebraic variety. However, there is a subset of the Grassmannian called the totally non-negative Grassmannian or (informally) the positive Grassmannian [49,54], where these difficulties disappear: the restriction of the matroid stratification to the positive Grassmannian gives a cell complex [54,56,57], whose cells S π are called positroid cells and labelled by (among other things) decorated permutations. Since the work of Postnikov [54], there has been an extensive study of positroids [9,10,51]-the matroids associated to the positroid cells. The moment map images of positroid cells are precisely the positroid polytopes [68], and as we will discuss in this paper, the positive tropical Grassmannian [65] (which equals the positive Dressian [66]) parametrizes the regular positroid subdivisions of the hypersimplex.The matroid stratification of the real Grassmannian is notoriously complicated: Mnev's universality theorem says that the topology of the matroid strata can be as bad as that of any algebraic variety.

In particular, any n × (k + m) matrix Z with maximal minors positive induces a map Z from Gr ≥0 k,n to the Grassmannian Gr k,k+m , whose image has full dimension mk and is called the amplituhedron A n,k,m [6].

When does a collection of positroid cells give -via the moment map -a positroid dissection of the hypersimplex?

        <p>The combinatorics of positroid tilings for both the hypersimplex and the amplituhedron is very interesting: Speyer's f -vector theorem [61,62] gives an upper bound on the number of matroid polytopes of each dimension in a matroidal subdivision coming from the tropical Grassmannian. In particular, it says that the number of topdimensional matroid polytopes in such a subdivision of k+1,n is at most n-2 k . This number is in particular achieved by finest positroid subdivisions [66]. Meanwhile, the third author together with Karp and Zhang [44] conjectured that the number of cells in a tiling of the amplituhedron A n,k,m (Z) for even m is precisely M(k, nkm, m 2 ), whereThe combinatorics of positroid tilings for both the hypersimplex and the amplituhedron is very interesting: Speyer's f -vector theorem [61,62] gives an upper bound on the number of matroid polytopes of each dimension in a matroidal subdivision coming from the tropical Grassmannian.

What we show in this paper is that the appearance of the number n-2 k in the context of both the hypersimplex k+1,n and the amplituhedron A n,k,2 (Z) is not a coincidence! Indeed, we can obtain tilings of the amplituhedron from tilings of the hypersimplex, by applying a T-duality map. This T-duality map sends loopless positroid cells S π of Gr ≥0 k+1,n to coloopless positroid cells S π of Gr ≥0 k,n via a simple operation on the decorated permutations, see Section 5. T-duality sends tiles for the hypersimplex (cells where the moment map is injective) to tiles for the amplituhedron (cells where Z is injective), see Proposition 6.6, and moreover it sends dissections of the hypersimplex to dissections of the amplituhedron, see Theorem 6.5 and Conjecture 6.9. This explains the two appearances of the number n-2 k on the two sides of the story. The fact that dissections of k+1,n and A n,k,2 (Z) are in bijection is a rather surprising statement. Should there be a map from k+1,n to A n,k,2 (Z) or vice-versa? We have dim k+1,n = n -1 and dim A n,k,2 (Z) = 2k, with no relation between n -1 and 2k (apart from k ≤ n) so it is not obvious that a nice map between them should exist.is the number of plane partitions contained in an a × b × c box.

        <p>Nevertheless we do show that T-duality descends from a certain map that can be defined directly on positroid cells of Gr ≥0 k+1,n . The T-duality map provides a handy tool for studying the amplituhedron A n,k,2 (Z): we can try to understand properties of the amplituhedron (and its dissections) by studying the hypersimplex and applying T-duality. For example, we show in Section 7 that the rather mysterious parity duality, which relates dissections of A n,k,2 (Z) with dissections of A n,n-k-2,2 , can be obtained by composing the hypersimplex duality k+1,n n-k-1,n (which comes from the Grassmannian duality Gr k+1,nNevertheless we do show that T-duality descends from a certain map that can be defined directly on positroid cells of Gr ≥0 k+1,n .

However, the regular subdivisions of k+1,n are very nice polyhedral subdivisions. By Proposition 9.12, the regular positroid dissections of k+1,n come precisely from the positive Dressian Dr + k+1,n (which equals the positive tropical Grassmannian Trop + Gr k+1,n ).

        <p>One step in proving Proposition 9.12 is the following new characterization of positroid polytopes (see Theorem 3.9): a matroid polytope is a positroid polytope if and only if all of its two-dimensional faces are positroid polytopes.One step in proving Proposition 9.12 is the following new characterization of positroid polytopes (see Theorem 3.9): a matroid polytope is a positroid polytope if and only if all of its two-dimensional faces are positroid polytopes.</p>
        <p>Let us now explain how the various geometric objects in our story are related to scattering amplitudes in supersymmetric fields theories. The main emphasis so far has been on the so-called "planar limit" of N = 4 super Yang-Mills. In 2009, the works of Arkani-Hamed-Cachazo-Cheung-Kaplan [3] and Bullimore-Mason-Skinner [18] introduced beautiful Grassmannian formulations for scattering amplitudes in this theory. Remarkably, this led to the discovery that the positive Grassmannian encodes most of the physical properties of amplitudes [1]. Building on these developments and on Hodges' idea that scattering amplitudes might be 'volumes' of some geometric object [37], Arkani-Hamed and Trnka arrived at the definition of the amplituhedron A n,k,m (Z) [6] in 2013. The m = 4 amplituhedron A n,k,4 is the object most relevant to physics: it encodes the geometry of (tree-level) scattering amplitudes in planar N = 4 SYM. However, the amplituhedron is a well-defined and interesting mathematical object for any m. For example, the m = 1 amplituhedron A n,k,1 can be identified with the complex of bounded faces of a cyclic hyperplane arrangement [43]. The m = 2 amplituhedron A n,k,2 (Z), which is a main subject of this paper, also has a beautiful combinatorial structure, and has been recently studied e.g. in [7,16,44,46,47]. From the point of view of physics, A n,k,2 (Z) is often considered as a toy-model for the m = 4 case. However it has applications to physics as well: A n,2,2 governs the geometry of scattering amplitudes in N = 4 SYM at the subleading order in perturbation theory for the so-called 'MHV' sector of the theory, and remarkably, the m = 2 amplituhedron A n,k,2 (Z) is also relevant for the 'next to MHV' sector, enhancing its connection with the geometries of loop amplitudes [41].Let us now explain how the various geometric objects in our story are related to scattering amplitudes in supersymmetric fields theories.

        <p>Meanwhile, in recent years physicists have been increasingly interested in understanding how cluster algebras encode the analytic properties of scattering amplitudes, both at tree-and loop-level [31]. This led them to explore the connection between cluster algebras and the positive tropical Grassmannian which was observed in [65].

The geometric counterpart of this fact is a duality between collections of 4k-dimensional 'BCFW' cells of Gr ≥0 k,n which tile the amplituhedron A n,k,4 [26], and corresponding collections of (2n -4)-dimensional cells of Gr ≥0 k+2,n which (conjecturally) tile the momentum amplituhedron M n,k,4 ; the latter object was introduced very recently by the first two authors together with Damgaard and Ferro [23].

        <p>Our next goal is to use Proposition 3.4 to determine when the moment map restricted to a positroid cell is a homeomorphism. To do so, we need to understand how to compute the number of connected components of a positroid. The following result comes from [9, Theorem 10.7] and its proof. We say that a permutation π of [n] is stabilized-interval-free (SIF) if it does not stabilize any proper interval of [n]; that is, Proof. Suppose that (1) holds, i.e. that the moment map is an injection when restricted to a cell S π . Then dim π = dim S π . By [68, Proposition 7.12], the positroid variety X π is a toric variety if and only if dim π = dim S π , so this implies that X π is a toric variety, and S π is its nonnegative part. It is well-known that the moment map is a homeomorphism when restricted to the nonnegative part of a toric variety [29, Section 4.2], so it follows that μ is a homeomorphism on S π . Therefore (1) implies (2). But obviously (2) implies (1). Now suppose that (2) holds. Since π is the moment map image of S π , it follows that dim π = dim S π , and by Proposition 3.4, we have that dim π = nc, where c is the number of connected components of the matroid M π . Therefore (2) implies (3). Now suppose (3) holds. Then by [68, Proposition 7.12], X π must be a toric variety, and so the moment map restricts to a homeomorphism from S π to π . So (3) implies (2). Proposition 3.16. Consider a positroid cell S π ⊂ Gr ≥0 k,n and let M π be the corresponding positroid. Then the moment map is a homeomorphism from S π to π ⊂ R n if and only if any reduced plabic graph associated to π is a forest.

Equivalently, π is obtained from π by composing π with the permutation π 0 = (n, 1, 2, . . . , n -1) in the symmetric group, π = π 0 • π .[n] to coloopless decorated permutations on [n] as follows. Given a loopless decorated permutation π = (a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a n ) (written in list notation) on [n], we define the decorated permutation π by π(i) = π(i-1), so that π = (a n , a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a n-1 ), where any fixed points in π are declared to be loops. Equivalently, π is obtained from π by composing π with the permutation π 0 = (n, 1, 2, . . . , n -1) in the symmetric group, π = π 0 • π .</p>
        <p>Recall that an anti-excedance of a decorated permutation is a position i such that π(i) &lt; i, or π(i) = i and i is a coloop. Our first result shows that T-duality is a bijection between loopless cells of Gr ≥0 k+1,n and coloopless cells of Gr ≥0 k,n . Proof. The second statement follows from the first by Section 12, so it suffices to prove the first statement. Let π = (a 1 , . . . , a n ) be a loopless permutation on [n] with k + 1 antiexcedances; then π = (a n , a 1 , . . . , a n-1 ). Consider any i such that 1 ≤ i ≤ n -1. Suppose i is a position of a anti-excedance, i.e. either a i &lt; i or a i = i. Then the letter a i appears in the (i + 1)st position in π , and since a i &lt; i + 1, we again have an anti-excedance.Recall that an anti-excedance of a decorated permutation is a position i such that π(i) &lt; i, or π(i) = i and i is a coloop. Our first result shows that T-duality is a bijection between loopless cells of Gr ≥0 k+1,n and coloopless cells of Gr ≥0 k,n . Proof. The second statement follows from the first by Section 12, so it suffices to prove the first statement. Let π = (a 1 , . . . , a n ) be a loopless permutation on [n] with k + 1 antiexcedances; then π = (a n , a 1 , . . . , a n-1 ). Consider any i such that 1 ≤ i ≤ n -1. Suppose i is a position of a anti-excedance, i.e. either a i &lt; i or a i = i. Then the letter a i appears in the (i + 1)st position in π , and since a i &lt; i + 1, we again have an anti-excedance.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, if i is not a position of an anti-excedance, i.e. a i &gt; i (recall that π is loopless), then in the (i+1)st position of π we have a i ≥ i+1. By Definition 5.1 if we have a fixed point in position i + 1 (i.e. a i = i + 1) this is a loop, and so position i + 1 of π will not be a anti-excedance. Therefore if I ⊂ [n -1] is the positions of the anti-excedances located in the first n -1 positions of π , then I + 1 is the positions of the anti-excedances located in positions {2, 3, . . . , n} in π . Now consider position n of π . Because π is loopless, n will be the position of a anti-excedance in π . And because π is defined to be coloopless, 1 will never be the position of a anti-excedance in π . Therefore the number of anti-excedances of π will be precisely one less than the number of anti-excedances of π .On the other hand, if i is not a position of an anti-excedance, i.e. a i &gt; i (recall that π is loopless), then in the (i+1)st position of π we have a i ≥ i+1. By Definition 5.1 if we have a fixed point in position i + 1 (i.e. a i = i + 1) this is a loop, and so position i + 1 of π will not be a anti-excedance. Therefore if I ⊂ [n -1] is the positions of the anti-excedances located in the first n -1 positions of π , then I + 1 is the positions of the anti-excedances located in positions {2, 3, . . . , n} in π . Now consider position n of π . Because π is loopless, n will be the position of a anti-excedance in π . And because π is defined to be coloopless, 1 will never be the position of a anti-excedance in π . Therefore the number of anti-excedances of π will be precisely one less than the number of anti-excedances of π .</p>

        <p>In this section we discuss the relation of T-duality to parity duality, which relates dissections of the amplituhedron A n,k,m (Z) with dissections of A n,n-m-k,m (Z ). The definition of parity duality was originally inspired by the physical operation of parity conjugation in quantum field theory -more specifically, in the context of scattering amplitudes in N = 4 Super-Yang-Mills, where amplitudes can be computed from the geometry of A n,k,4 (Z) [6]. Furthermore, the conjectural formula of Karp, Williams, and Zhang [44] for the number of cells in each tiling of the amplituhedron is invariant under the operation of swapping the parameters k and nmk and hence is consistent with parity duality: this motivated further works, see [28,Section 2.4] and [33]. In particular, [33] gave an explicit bijection between dissections of A n,k,m (Z) and dissections of A n,n-m-k,m (Z ), see Theorem 7.7. In Theorem 7.3, we will explain how parity duality for m = 2 amplituhedra is naturally induced by a composition of the usual duality for Grassmannians (Gr k,n Gr n-k,n ) and the T-duality map (between loopless cells of Gr ≥0 k+1,n and coloopless cells of Gr ≥0 k,n ). The usual Grassmannian duality gives rise to a bijection between dissections of the hypersimplex k+1,n and dissections of the hypersimplex n-k-1,n . By composing this Grassmannian duality with the T-duality map (on both sides), we obtain the parity duality between dissections of A n,k,2 (Z) and A n,n-k-2,2 (Z )! Recall that our convention on dissections is that the images of all positroid cells are of full dimension n -1. Therefore all positroids involved in a dissection must be connected, and the corresponding decorated permutations will be fixed-point-free. Proof. If G is a plabic graph representing the positroid cell S π , and if we swap the colors of the black and white vertices of G, we obtain a graph G representing the positroid S π -1 . It is not hard to see from [9] that G and π -1 represent the dual positroid to G and π . But now the matroid polytopes π and π -1 are isomorphic via the map dual : R n → R n sending (x 1 , . . . , x n ) → (1x 1 , . . . , 1x n ).

Then by Theorem 3.9, M (and hence D P ) has a two-dimensional face with vertices e Sab , e Sad , e Sbc , e Scd , for some 1 ≤ a &lt; b &lt; c &lt; d ≤ n and S of size k -2 disjoint from {a, b, c, d}. By Remark 9.10, this means that there is a vector λ = (λ 1 , . . . , λ n , -1) whose dot product is maximized at the face F.

        <p>As shown in [65], the positive tropical Grassmannian has an n-dimensional lineality space coming from the torus action. However, one may mod out by this torus action and study the resulting fan. The method used in [65] was to show that Trop + Gr k,n (a polyhedral subcomplex of R ( [n] k ) ) is combinatorially equivalent to an (nk -1)(k -1)dimensional fan F k,n , obtained by using an "X-cluster" or "web" parametrization of the positive Grassmannian, and modding out by the torus action. As explained in [65, Section 6], F k,n is the dual fan to the Minkowski sum of the n k Newton polytopes obtained by writing down each Plücker coordinate in the X-cluster parametrization.As shown in [65], the positive tropical Grassmannian has an n-dimensional lineality space coming from the torus action.

        <p>Using this technique, [65] computed the f -vector of Trop + Gr 2,n (which is the fvector of the associahedron, with maximal cones corresponding to tilings of a polygon) Trop + Gr 3,6 , and Trop + Gr 3,7 . The above f -vector computations were recently extended in [4] using the notion of "stringy canonical forms" and in [12,21] using planar arrays and matrices of Feynman diagrams. See also [22,24,38] for recent, physicsinspired developments in this direction. We list all known results about maximal cones in the positive tropical Grassmannian Trop + Gr k+1,n and their relation to tilings of hypersimplex k+1,n in Table 1.Using this technique, [65] computed the f -vector of Trop + Gr 2,n (which is the fvector of the associahedron, with maximal cones corresponding to tilings of a polygon) Trop + Gr 3,6 , and Trop + Gr 3,7 .

        <p>Since we found a natural candidate map, we now introduce a candidate object, which would speculatively relate to A n,k,m (Z) via the T-duality map. This is a generalization of the momentum amplituhedron M n,k,4 ( , ) and it is defined below. The lemma below can be found in [40,Lemma 1.11], which sketched a proof and attributed it to Hochster and Hilbert.Since we found a natural candidate map, we now introduce a candidate object, which would speculatively relate to A n,k,m (Z) via the T-duality map.
