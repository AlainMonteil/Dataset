        <p>A major open question, affecting the decisions of policy makers, is the estimation of the true number of Covid-19 infections. Most of them are undetected, because of a large number of asymptomatic cases. We provide an efficient, easy to compute and robust lower bound estimator for the number of undetected cases. Methods: A modified version of the Chao estimator is proposed, based on the cumulative time-series distributions of cases and deaths. Heterogeneity has been addressed by assuming a geometrical distribution underlying the data generation process. An (approximated) analytical variance of the estimator has been derived to compute reliable confidence intervals at 95% level. Results: A motivating application to the Austrian situation is provided and compared with an independent and representative study on prevalence of Covid-19 infection. Our estimates match well with the results from the independent prevalence study, but the capture-recapture estimate has less uncertainty involved as it is based on a larger sample size. Results from other European countries are mentioned in the discussion. The estimated ratio of the total estimated cases to the observed cases is around the value of 2.3 for all the analyzed countries. Conclusions: The proposed method answers to a fundamental open question: "How many undetected cases are going around?". CR methods provide a straightforward solution to shed light on undetected cases, incorporating heterogeneity that may arise in the probability of being detected.A major open question, affecting the decisions of policy makers, is the estimation of the true number of Covid-19 infections.

        <p>Currently, health systems across the globe are challenged by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. It is not a simple task to assess the efficiency of current health systems in detecting, treating, and preventing onward transmission of Covid-19, as the number of undetected infections is by definition unknown. Understanding the diffusion of the epidemic and assessing the number of real infections of Covid-19 is crucial for implementing effective public and health policies in tackling the virus. Unfortunately, official reporting and statistics significantly underestimate the true number since there exists a vast proportion of asymptomatic infected patients including those with mild symptoms among all infected individuals who are not detected. Indeed, the infected individuals with low-mild symptoms are likely not going to get in contact with the health care system and will also not be recorded in official statistics.Currently, health systems across the globe are challenged by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.

        <p>For example, reports estimate the number of infected in Italy to be around 3.5 times higher than reported (Tuite et al., 2020). Slightly lower estimates have been given for Germany (Ranjan, 2020). Another study discusses that Italy mostly focuses on testing in hospitals with symptoms; hence, the roughly 50% asymptomatic are not covered by this approach (Onder et al., 2020). The same percentage of asymptomatic is also reported in Iceland (Shahan, 2020). The asymptomatic individuals in fact can be a direct transmitter of the virus and their unawareness can indirectly strengthen and increase the transmission of Covid-19. Indeed, it seems fair to say that the undetected cases are the major driver in spreading the disease as detected cases are and will be systematically contained.For example, reports estimate the number of infected in Italy to be around 3.5 times higher than reported (Tuite et al., 2020).

        <p>Most of the existing analyses performed a secondary data analysis from several sources of data already in the public domain (Menkir et al., 2020). Because published estimates of the distribution of Covid-19 vary widely, with estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0, alone ranging from subcritical (i.e., &lt;1) to &gt;3 (Giordano et al., 2020;Li et al., 2020a,b;Maugeri et al., 2020;Zhao et al., 2020;Zhou et al., 2020), mathematical models of infectious diseases, such as Susceptible-Infected-Recovered models, computing the theoretical number of people infected with a contagious illness in a closed population over time, needs to be evaluated on a range/grid of simulated values, each based on different assumptions and adjusted based on data from different geographic areas (Chen et al., 2020). Other much simpler (Nishiura et al., 2020) or sophisticated (Flaxman et al., 2020) approaches are also used to estimate the number of undetected cases, but with large, almost unacceptable, uncertainty on the obtained estimates.Most of the existing analyses performed a secondary data analysis from several sources of data already in the public domain (Menkir et al., 2020).

        <p>As mentioned above, several methods have been proposed to estimate the undetected number of infections but none has yet suggested to use capture-recapture methods, which is, in some sense, the most obvious method to estimate a dark number. For more details see BÃ¶hning (2016). Hence, the purpose of this contribution is to propose a lower bound estimator for the number of people affected by Covid-19 but not detected for various reasons, the major one being that they are asymptomatic. In other words, the aim is to estimate the size of an elusive, i.e., partially unobserved, population. Capture-recapture (CR) methods are designed to achieve this goal. In a nutshell, capture-recapture methods use the capture history of individuals to estimate those who have never been caught. The method suggested uses only the frequencies of those caught once and those caught twice. In the Covid-19 application, these are the ones newly identified at some day and the ones caught twice are those newly identified the day before (and surely still infected one day later, so that they are considered as twice identified) subtracted by the number of deaths at the given day. Hence, our proposal is developed using the cumulative distribution of the observed cases and deaths. The use of CR methods is not straightforward as we are dealing with an open population, subject to deaths, and heterogeneity in the probability of being detected. A modified version of Chao's estimator under a geometric distribution, suitable for the setting here, is introduced. It accounts for heterogeneity in a simple way and can be easily computed starting from data collected by all government sources. In this way, the policy makers can have benchmark, statistically valid, estimates of the lower bound for the total number of cases and, accordingly, adjust their interventions.As mentioned above, several methods have been proposed to estimate the undetected number of infections but none has yet suggested to use capture-recapture methods, which is, in some sense, the most obvious method to estimate a dark number.

        <p>The question arises how this can be linked to a capturerecapture approach. For this purpose we briefly review the capture-recapture model we like to harness here. Suppose a target population is sampled for units of interest repeatedly. Let X denote the number of times a unit is identified in this sampling process. Also, let p x denote the probability of identifying a unit x times where x = 0, 1, . . . .

Now we can find p 0 , the probability for missing a unit of interest (infection) as p 0 Â¼ p 2 1 =p 2 , the ratio of the square of the probability of identifying a unit twice divided by the probability of detecting a unit once. Replacing p 1 and p 2 with the observed frequencies f 1 of those identified exactly once and f 2 of those identified exactly twice leads to an estimate of the hidden units b f 0 Â¼ f 2 1 =f 2 . The validity of the estimate depends on the validity of the geometric distribution (1). To weaken this assumption we allow the parameter u to vary in the population with arbitrary unknown distribution f(u) to reflect varying identification probabilities across the target population:In (1) occurs the geometric distribution as a suitable count distribution.

        <p>The results are provided in Table 3 for the country of Austria which includes estimates of the hidden and total (observed + hidden) cases with 95% confidence intervals. At the 6th of April the number of infections was 12,297 which is the observed number. We have chosen the 15th of March as beginning of the observational period. However other dates are possible as well so that we looked at estimates in dependence of the beginning of the observation period. It can be seen that results change slightly. Of course, if the window is made too small estimates of hidden numbers will only refer to observations made in this window. The major question arises if the estimates of Table 3 are realistic and do they represent a reasonable estimate of the true size of the undetected infections. The best comparison would give a representative sample of the target population where sampling is done to find infection with a valid diagnostic test. For Austria we have an independent study on the size of the Covid-19 outbreak (https://www.sora.at/nc/news-presse/news/news-einzelansicht/ news/covid-19-praevalenz-1006.html).

        <p>The study was rolled out during the 1 April and 6 April 2020 and sampled 1544 persons across Austria covering all ages up to 94 years. The study used a PCR-test for diagnosing infection which is assumed to be accurate. According to the study, the proportion of infected people was 0.0033. If this proportion is applied to the population of Austria, as study in media release points out, during the study period there were 28,500 infected persons in Austria. The study estimates that we have provided match very well with the results of the study, independent where we start the observational window. The dark number study also reports a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of infected persons which ranges from 0.0012 to 0.0076, corresponding to 10,200 and 67,400 infected persons, respectively. Clearly, the capture-recapture estimate is included in this large interval but as we are able to utilize much larger routinely collected data on infected persons, the uncertainty provided by the capture-recapture approach is considerably reduced which is reflected in the relative short confidence intervals. The ratio of the total estimated cases to the observed cases is interesting in itself. A ratio of 2.5 would mean that for every observed patient there are 1.5 infected persons unseen. The reason for this can be manifold as these unseen cases might be without symptoms or show very mild signs of infection. It is also interesting to investigate how this ratio changes over the duration of the pandemic. In Figure 1 we see a scatter-plot of this ratio against a varying end point of the observational period starting at day 5 (20th of March) and ending at day 23 (6th of April). As the ratio shows quite a bit of random variation, in particular for early days, we have also included a LOWESS smoother. It becomes clear in Figure 1 that the ratio stabilizes around day 15 as the end of the observational period which can be also taken as guidance for choosing the size of the observational period.The study was rolled out during the 1 April and 6 April 2020 and sampled 1544 persons across Austria covering all ages up to 94 years.

        <p>The proposed method answers to a fundamental open question: "How many undetected cases are going around?". Of course, we provide a lower bound, but this information may be treated as a starting point whenever interventions and tools to dampen the spread of the epidemic are rolled out. CR methods are easy to apply in practice, and this is one of the merits of the method. Moreover, we simply use time series of cumulative data, readily available from official sources. Given that individual data are not publicly available, CR methods provide a straightforward solution to shed light on undetected cases, incorporating heterogeneity that may arise in the probability of being detected simply considering the widely known and used geometric distribution.The proposed method answers to a fundamental open question: "How many undetected cases are going around?".

        <p>Another question relates to the size of the observational period. In the case, study we have used 3 weeks as this would cover a period where a person infectious at the first day might still be so at the end of the period. Hence we are trying to estimate the hidden population which is infectious and not a mix of persons being infectious and persons having passed the infection. An interesting thought which was contributed by an anonymous referee was to take a period starting from the very first case and ending with the very last one. Applying the estimator would give an estimate of the size of the population who has passed the infections (and potentially have reached immunity).Another question relates to the size of the observational period.

        <p>The example provided here relies on Austrian data, but many other countries can be analyzed even if there are not benchmark survey studies to compare with. For example, taking data up to 17/ 04/2020 from https://github.com/open-covid-19/data on several European countries and considering data from the day which we record the first death, we obtain the estimates of undetected cases for Italy, Germany, Spain, UK and Greece (see Table 4). The last column in Table 4 shows the ratio of the total estimated cases to the observed cases. There is a remarkable stability around the value of 2.3.The example provided here relies on Austrian data, but many other countries can be analyzed even if there are not benchmark survey studies to compare with.

        <p>All the obtained estimates are surrounded by some uncertainty. Confidence intervals for the modified Chao's lower bound have been provided and are seemingly reliable, in particular compared to those presented in other studies. We emphasize that the estimates provided are conservative, in the sense that they provide lower bounds on the size of undetected infections. However, we have provided some evidence such as in the situation of Austria that these lower bounds are not far away from the true size of infection in the target population. This needs to be followed up by further comparisons with representative sampling studies on target population infection. This is just a first evidence on the use of capture-recapture methods to study Covid-19 data. Another question is still open: "is there a way of estimating an upper bound for the number of undetected cases?". Again capture-recapture methods could be implemented to provide an answer to this question and help policy makers to evaluate the Covid-19 epidemic situation locally and at the current phase of its development.All the obtained estimates are surrounded by some uncertainty.
