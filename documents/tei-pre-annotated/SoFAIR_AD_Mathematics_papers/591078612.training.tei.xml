        <p>Cancer is a worldwide illness that causes significant morbidity and death and imposes an immense cost on global public health. Modelling such a phenomenon is complex because of the non-stationarity and complexity of cancer waves. Apply modern novel statistical methods directly to raw clinical data. To estimate extreme cancer death rate likelihood at any period in any location of interest. Traditional statistical methodologies that deal with temporal observations of multi-regional processes cannot adequately deal with substantial regional dimensionality and cross-correlation of various regional variables. Setting: multicenter, population-based, medical survey data-based biostatistical approach. Due to the non-stationarity and complicated nature of cancer, it is challenging to model such a phenomenon. This paper offers a unique bio-system dependability technique suited for multi-regional environmental and health systems. When monitored over a significant period, it yields a reliable long-term projection of the chance of an exceptional cancer mortality rate. Traditional statistical approaches dealing with temporal observations of multi-regional processes cannot effectively deal with large regional dimensionality and cross-correlation between multiple regional data. The provided approach may be employed in numerous public health applications, depending on their clinical survey data.Cancer is a worldwide illness that causes significant morbidity and death and imposes an immense cost on global public health.

        <p>Cancer's statistical characteristics received much attention from the current scientific community [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] . Using current theoretical statistical methods [9][10][11][12][13][14][15] , it is often rather challenging to compute realistic biological system dependability factors and outbreak probability under actual cancer settings. Typically, this results from many degrees of system freedom and random variables driving vastly dispersed dynamic biological systems. In theory, the dependability of a complex biological system may be precisely evaluated using sufficient observations or direct Monte Carlo simulations. Beginning in 1990, however, a portion of the available cancer observation numbers are limited [16][17][18][19][20][21] . Motivated by the latter point, the authors have developed a unique dependability technique for biological and health systems to forecast and control cancer epidemics more precisely. The whole globe was selected because of the enormous internet health observations and associated research 1 .Cancer's statistical characteristics received much attention from the current scientific community [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] .

        <p>In health and engineering fields, statistical modelling of lifetime data and extreme value theory (EVT) are widespread. For example, Gumbel utilised EVT to predict the demography of distinct communities in [20][21][22][23] . Recent papers arguing for and against the upper bounds distribution of life expectancy were done by 24 . Often, papers in these fields presume a parametric bivariate lifetime distribution obtained from the exponential distribution to get statistically relevant data 24 . In 25 , the author proposes a new approach that uses Power Variance Function copulas (e.g., Clayton, Gumbel and Inverse Gaussian copulas), conditional sampling, and numerical approximation used in survival analysis. While in a paper by 26 , the authors explain that EVT has been used to predict mutation in evolutionary genetics and further develop a likelihood framework from EVT that was used to determine the fitness effects of the mutation.In health and engineering fields, statistical modelling of lifetime data and extreme value theory (EVT) are widespread.

        <p>Equation ( 5) presents subsequent refinements of the statistical independence assumption. The latter type of approximation enables capturing the statistical dependence effect between neighbouring maxima with increased accuracy. Since the original MDOF bio-process R(t) was assumed ergodic and therefore stationary, the prob- ability p k ( ): = Prob {R j &gt; η j | R j-1 ≤ η j-1 , R j-k+1 ≤ η j-k+1 } for j ≥ k will be independent of j but only dependent on conditioning level k .

        <p>In the preceding, the assumption of stationarity has been employed. The proposed methodology can also treat the non-stationary case. An illustration of how the methodology can be used to treat non-stationary cases is provided. Consider a scattered diagram of m = 1, .., M environmental states, each short-term bio-environmental state having a probability q m , so that M m=1 q m = 1 . The corresponding long-term equation is then with p k ( , m) being the same function as in Eq. ( 7) but corresponding to a specific short-term environmental state with the number m . The above introduced p k ( ) as functions are often regular in the tail, specifically for values of approaching and exceeding 1 . More precisely, for ≥ 0 , the distribution tail behaves similarly to exp -(a + b) c + d with a, b, c, d being suitably fitted constants for suitable tail cut-on 0 value. Therefore, one can write Next, by plotting ln ln p k ( )d k versus ln(a k + b k ) , often nearly perfectly linear tail behaviour is observed. Optimal values of the parameters a k , b k , c k , p k , q k may also be determined using a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method incorporated in the

The methodology's limitation lies in its assumption of the underlying bio-environmental process quasi-stationarity.</p>
        <p>Traditional health systems reliability methods dealing with observed time series do not have the advantage of dealing efficiently with systems possessing high dimensionality and cross-correlation between different system responses. The essential advantage of the introduced methodology is its ability to study the reliability of high dimensional non-linear dynamic systems.Traditional health systems reliability methods dealing with observed time series do not have the advantage of dealing efficiently with systems possessing high dimensionality and cross-correlation between different system responses.

        <p>Despite the simplicity, the present study successfully offers a novel multidimensional modelling strategy and a methodological avenue to implement forecasting of the cancer death rate. Proper setting of health system alarm limits (failure limits) per country has been discussed. This paper studied recorded cancer death rates from all world countries, constituting an example of a one hundred ninety-five dimensional (195D) observed from 1990 to 2019. In real-time, the novel reliability method was applied to cancer annual death rate numbers as a multidimensional system. The theoretical reasoning behind the proposed method is given in detail. Note that the use of direct either measurement or Monte Carlo simulation for dynamic biological system reliability analysis is attractive; however, dynamic system complexity and its high dimensionality require the development of novel robust and accurate techniques that can deal with a limited data set at hand, utilising available data as efficient as possible.Despite the simplicity, the present study successfully offers a novel multidimensional modelling strategy and a methodological avenue to implement forecasting of the cancer death rate.

        <p>The main conclusion is that the public health system under local environmental and epidemiologic conditions is well managed. This study predicted an annual death rate 100-year return period risk level equal to about 0.24%. Therefore, under current national health management conditions, cancer still represents a future threat to world health.The main conclusion is that the public health system under local environmental and epidemiologic conditions is well managed.

        <p>This study further aimed to develop a general-purpose, robust, and straightforward multidimensional reliability method. The method introduced in this paper has been previously validated by application to a wide range of simulation models, but for only one-dimensional system responses and, in general, very accurate predictions were obtained. Both measured and numerically simulated time series responses can be analysed. It is shown that the proposed method produced a reasonable confidence interval. Thus, the suggested methodology may become appropriate for various non-linear dynamic biological systems reliability studies. Finally, the suggested methodology can be used in many public health applications. The presented cancer example does not limit areas of new method applicability (Supplementary file).This study further aimed to develop a general-purpose, robust, and straightforward multidimensional reliability method.

        <p>The suggested method can work well with non-stationary data sets (for example, seasonal variations) as soon as they represent the proof of interest. If, however, there is an underlying trend in the process of interest or the data was manipulated, those effects have to be identified. In that case, trend analysis should be performed, a topic for future studies. In any case, authors assume that within 3 years, horizon quasi-stationarity may be assumed. Therefore, the limitation of this study lies within the assumption of bio-system quasi-stationarity, which is, of course, not valid for many years to come.The suggested method can work well with non-stationary data sets (for example, seasonal variations) as soon as they represent the proof of interest.
