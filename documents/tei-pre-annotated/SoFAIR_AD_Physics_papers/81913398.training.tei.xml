        <p>We compute numerically the dimensions and OPE coefficients of several operators in the 3d Ising CFT, and then try to reverse-engineer the solution to crossing symmetry analytically. Our key tool is a set of new techniques for computing infinite sums of SL(2, R) conformal blocks. Using these techniques, we solve the lightcone bootstrap to all orders in an asymptotic expansion in large spin, and suggest a strategy for going beyond the large spin limit. We carry out the first steps of this strategy for the 3d Ising CFT, deriving analytic approximations for the dimensions and OPE coefficients of several infinite families of operators in terms of the initial data {∆ σ , ∆ , f σσ , f , c T }. The analytic results agree with numerics to high precision for about 100 low-twist operators (correctly accounting for O(1) mixing effects between large-spin families). Plugging these results back into the crossing equations, we obtain approximate analytic constraints on the initial data.We compute numerically the dimensions and OPE coefficients of several operators in the 3d Ising CFT, and then try to reverse-engineer the solution to crossing symmetry analytically.

        <p>The current most powerful techniques for studying the spectrum of small central charge theories are numerical bootstrap techniques , based on the conformal bootstrap [53,54] and the methods pioneered in [3]. For example, the numerical bootstrap has yielded precise predictions for dimensions of the lowest-dimension scalars σ and in the 3d Ising CFT [12,20,24,31,55]. It is difficult to reproduce these results analytically because the 3d Ising CFT does not admit a (known) controlled expansion in a small coupling constant. 1But even strongly-coupled theories admit small parameters in kinematic limits. The authors of [59,60] showed that every CFT admits a large-spin expansion, accessible via the lightcone limit of the crossing equations. By studying the lightcone limit, one can prove: Theorem 1.1 (Existence of double-twist operators [59,60]). Suppose a CFT in d &gt; 2 dimensions contains primary operators O 1 , O 2 with twists τ 1 , τ 2 . 2 For each n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , there exists an infinite family of primary operators with increasing spin and twists approaching τ 1 + τ 2 + 2n as → ∞.The current most powerful techniques for studying the spectrum of small central charge theories are numerical bootstrap techniques , based on the conformal bootstrap [53,54] and the methods pioneered in [3].

        <p>Of course, composite operators like (1.1) don't make sense in a general strongly-coupled theory. However, theorem 1.1 implies that they do make sense in the large-limit. We denote the family with twist approaching τ 1 +τ 2 +2n as [O 1 O 2 ] n and refer to such operators as "double-twist" operators (following [60]). Dimensions and OPE coefficients of double-twist operators have a computable expansion in (generically non-integer) powers of 1/ , where terms in the expansion come from matching operators on the other side of the crossing equation. Recently, there has been significant progress in understanding this expansion [1,[59][60][61][62][63][64][65][66][67]. The large-expansion is asymptotic in general [1], so its usefulness for studying finite-spin operators is not immediately clear.

        <p>In section 2, we perform a (non-rigorous) numerical computation of the 3d Ising spectrum using the extremal functional method [7,14,20]. Importantly, we use a trick from [68] which lets us assign error bars to the resulting operator dimensions and thereby understand which predictions are robust and which ones aren't. The robust predictions turn out to be for low-twist operators (not just low-dimension operators). Specifically, we find relatively precise predictions for 112 operators in the 3d Ising CFT, of which only 9 do not fall into an obvious double-twist family. The remaining 103 operators give a clear numerical picture of the families [σσ] 0 , [σσ] 1 , [ ] 0 , and [σ ] 0 , up to spin ∼ 40. We give additional details of our computation in appendix A, and list the resulting operators in appendix A. 3. Although many of the results in this work are analytical (and applicable to any CFT), this numerical picture is a crucial guide, helping us ask the right questions and find the right tools to answer them.In section 2, we perform a (non-rigorous) numerical computation of the 3d Ising spectrum using the extremal functional method [7,14,20].

        <p>Describing [σσ] 1 and [ ] 0 requires a novel approach because the two families exhibit nontrivial mixing. (For example the OPE coefficient f [σσ] 1 is larger than f [ ] 0 for spins ≤ 26.) In section 7, using our solution of the asymptotic lightcone bootstrap, we show how to define a "twist Hamiltonian" H(h = ∆+ 2 ) whose diagonalization correctly describes this mixing, and matches the numerics well for ≥ 4. In particular, diagonalizing H(h) leads to O(1) anomalous dimensions and variations in OPE coefficients, despite the fact that we have truncated the asymptotic expansion for H(h) to only a few terms. Our tentative conclusion is that by using the appropriate twist Hamiltonian, the large-spin expansion can in practice be extended down to relatively small spins for all double-twist operators in the 3d Ising CFT (and perhaps other theories as well).Describing [σσ] 1 and [ ] 0 requires a novel approach because the two families exhibit nontrivial mixing.

Alternatively, we can obtain them from the decomposition 22 The ordering f12Of43O differs from the f12Of34O ordering in [24] because our blocks differ by (-1) times positive factors. We have reabsorbed this (-1) by using f34O = (-1) O f43O. A useful way to remember the correct sign is to note that φ1(0)φ2(z)|O|φ2(1)φ1(∞) is the norm of a state in radial quantization, where |O| is a projector onto the conformal multiplet of O. Thus, it should be positive, which implies that it should have coefficient f 2 12O in the conformal block expansion. 23 Here, we organize operators into irreps of SO(2), and not traceless symmetric tensors of SO (2).

        <p>where α = (1, y) ∈ R N +1 . The notation "M 0" means "M is positive semidefinite". The M n j (x) are matrices with polynomial entrieswhere α = (1, y) ∈ R N +1 . The notation "M 0" means "M is positive semidefinite". The M n j (x) are matrices with polynomial entries</p>
        <p>In our case, the dual objective function b vanishes because we are minimizing the 0 function. We estimate errors as standard deviations in our sample set of 60 partial spectra. It is important to remember that these error estimates are non-rigorous (in contrast to the bounds on ∆ σ , ∆ , f σσ , and f , in (2.1), which are rigorous). In fact, the tables show that this method of assigning errors is imperfect. In table 6, for example, the precision of the OPE coefficients f σ O varies significantly at large . For instance, the error for the OPE coefficient of [σ ] 0, =27 is 0.3%, while the error for [σ ] 0, =28 is 2%. It is surprising that these should be so different. Perhaps a wider scan of the boundary of the allowed region A N would equalize the errors somewhat. Regardless, the reader should take the error estimates with a grain of salt.In our case, the dual objective function b vanishes because we are minimizing the 0 function.

        <p>The difference between the twist-Hamiltonian approach and the approach of section 5.3 is analogous to the difference between RG-improved perturbation theory and fixed-order calculations. In fixed-order perturbation theory at L loops, one finds powers of logarithms log 2 x, . . . , log L x (where x is some kinematic variable) whose coefficients are related by exponentiation to coefficients at lower loop order. In RG-improved perturbation theory, we exploit this fact by choosing a scale x 0 and deriving a differential equation for the xdependence near x/x 0 = 1. The log 1 x/x 0 terms at L-loops give L-th order corrections to anomalous dimensions, beta functions, etc. .The difference between the twist-Hamiltonian approach and the approach of section 5.3 is analogous to the difference between RG-improved perturbation theory and fixed-order calculations.

Some examples are the higher spin operators at the unitarity bound discussed in section 6.1. Similarly, the spectra computed using the above assumptions often (not always) have scalars of dimensions 3 or 3.5 or spin-2 operators of dimension 4 or 5. (In addition, there are occasionally Z 2 -odd scalars with dimension 3 due to the gap in that sector.) By varying the gaps, these operators become "unstable" in the sense that their dimensions depend on the boundary point p. Hence, in practice we can ignore them compared to the stable operators. Their OPE coefficients are usually quite small, so they don't affect the crossing equations much. We have removed these spurious operators by hand in figures 1 and 2.The resulting spectra are mostly independent of the gaps, with one exception: in the extremal functional method, spurious operators often appear at the gaps.

Thus, instead of using a Cholesky decomposition, we simply compute its eigenvectors and throw out those with very small eigenvalues.
