        <p>The breakthrough discovery of gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by merging black holes (BHs) [1] has opened a unique new avenue for probing unexplored regimes of the Universe. GWs have already provided unprecedented insights into the origin and population of BHs, including observations closing the mass-gaps [2][3][4]. They also hold the key to test gravity in its strong-field, nonlinear regime [5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12].The breakthrough discovery of gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by merging black holes (BHs) [1] has opened a unique new avenue for probing unexplored regimes of the Universe.

        <p>The GW measurements of BH binaries rely on accurate template waveforms that cover the inspiral, merger and ringdown of compact binaries. Significant recent progress has been made on constructing accurate templates in general relativity (GR). However, testing the underlying theory of gravity and searching for signatures of quantum gravity requires theory-specific waveforms beyond GR. Therefore, GW-based tests of gravity have focused mostly on parameterized or null tests against GR [7,9,10,12,13]. These tests are performed only on single coefficients associated to a scaling with frequency [9,10,14,15] and thus, the interpretation of theoretical constraints remains limited [7]. Given the plethora of proposed gravity theories beyond GR, it is not feasible to compute accurate template waveforms for all of them. This makes it important to consider well-motivated classes of theories that capture broadly applicable features for the GW modeling.The GW measurements of BH binaries rely on accurate template waveforms that cover the inspiral, merger and ringdown of compact binaries.

        <p>One of the most compelling beyond-GR class of theories is scalar Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) gravity, which extends GR by a dynamical scalar field non-minimally coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) invariant R 2 GB = R μνσρ R μνσρ -4R μν R μν + R 2 , with a coupling parameter α. sGB is particularly well motivated for several reasons (i) it is inspired by the low energy limit of quantum gravity paradigms such as string theory after compactification [16][17][18]; (ii) it can be derived from Lovelock gravity, the most general theory of gravity in D spacetime dimensions that yields second order field equations, via a dimensional reduction [19,20]; (iii) it corresponds to the lowest order in a series expansion in curvature terms and thus, it is representative of a more general class of higher derivative theories [21]; and (iv) its field equations contain at most second derivatives of the metric, so sGB can potentially be made mathematically well-posed (as shown for weak couplings to the GB invariant in [22][23][24]).One of the most compelling beyond-GR class of theories is scalar Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) gravity, which extends GR by a dynamical scalar field non-minimally coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) invariant R 2 GB = R μνσρ R μνσρ -4R μν R μν + R 2 , with a coupling parameter α. sGB is particularly well motivated for several reasons (i) it is inspired by the low energy limit of quantum gravity paradigms such as string theory after compactification [16][17][18]; (ii) it can be derived from Lovelock gravity, the most general theory of gravity in D spacetime dimensions that yields second order field equations, via a dimensional reduction [19,20]; (iii) it corresponds to the lowest order in a series expansion in curvature terms and thus, it is representative of a more general class of higher derivative theories [21]; and (iv) its field equations contain at most second derivatives of the metric, so sGB can potentially be made mathematically well-posed (as shown for weak couplings to the GB invariant in [22][23][24]).</p>
        <p>The coupling, f (φ), between the dynamical scalar field and the GB invariant determines the 'flavor' of sGB gravity [25,26]. For the sake of the summary we label them as 'type I' and 'type II'. In our notation, type I sGB corresponds to the subclass of theories for which f (φ) never vanishes. Representative examples include shift-symmetric ( f = 2φ) or dilatonic ( f ∼ e 2φ ) couplings. In this case the space-time curvature always sources the scalar field and, thus, inevitably yields hairy BHs [18,[27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36] that can form dynamically [29,30,37]. Type II sGB corresponds to the subclass of theories for which f (φ) can vanish for some values of the scalar field. Examples include a quadratic or Gaussian coupling function. Then, the Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions of GR still exist, and they can spontaneously scalarize [38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48]. Likewise, neutron stars can spontaneously scalarize in type II sGB gravity [38]. Such scalarized BHs or neutron stars can form dynamically [37,49].The coupling, f (φ), between the dynamical scalar field and the GB invariant determines the 'flavor' of sGB gravity [25,26].

        <p>To-date, modeling the dynamics of compact binaries in sGB gravity has mainly been restricted to the small coupling regime. This approximation has enabled the first numerical relativity (NR) simulations of BH binaries with an effective-field theoretical treatment [54,55] or the decoupling limit [41]. The numerical study of fully non-linear field equations for general couplings has recently been advanced in the direction of initial data construction [56], and numerical simulations [57] through a modified generalized harmonic formulation of the evolution equations [23]. This has also enabled the recent study of spontaneous BH scalarization [47]. The ringdown spectrum has been studied extensively in references [58,59]. However, the early inspiral waveform, typically first constructed with post-Newtonian (PN) methods, has only been modeled at leading (Newtonian) order [60]. At this order, the dynamics and the radiation are affected only by the scalar field, and consequently the waveforms are missing the effect of the curvature nonlinearities. Recently, the Lagrangian for the matter dynamics has been computed to 1PN order, where the nonlinearities first appear [61].To-date, modeling the dynamics of compact binaries in sGB gravity has mainly been restricted to the small coupling regime.

        <p>In this work we compute, for the first time, analytical waveforms for the inspiral stage of the binary evolution with the effect of nonlinear higher curvature corrections. We use the PN expansion with the direct integration of the relaxed Einstein equations (DIRE) approach, originally developed by Epstein and Wagoner [62] and extended by Will, Wiseman and Pati [63][64][65]. The PN assumption of a gravitationally bound source in the weak-field, low-velocity regime Gm/rc 2 ≈ v 2 /c 2 1, where m, r, and v are the characteristic mass, size, and velocity of the source, enables asymptotic expansions of the solutions to the field equations with 1/c 2 treated as a formal small expansion parameter. Each factor of c -2 then corresponds to one PN order. In the DIRE approach to PN calculations, the field equations are re-expressed in a relaxed form [66], namely as an inhomogeneous, sourced wave equation for field perturbations, accompanied by a harmonic gauge condition that is imposed after solving the field equations. The equations are solved in two space-time regions, (i) the near-zone, where the separation between source and field point is less than the characteristic wavelength of the GWs; and (ii) the far zone at larger distances, see figure 1. In both cases, the solutions are computed as retarded integrals over the past null cone of the field point. This integration method has been shown, for example, to provide non-divergent results for gravitational waveforms to 2PN order in agreement with results obtained using the multipolar post-Minkowskian formalism [67]. We note that this method has also been applied to massless scalar-tensor (ST) gravity theories-which admits scalarized neuron star solutions [68]-providing the equation of motion for compact binaries to 3PN order [69,70], GWs to 2PN [71,72], and scalar waves to 1.5PN [73] beyond the leading order. Specifically, in this paper, we calculate scalar and tensor waves of sGB gravity to half and one relative PN-order, respectively. This is the methods paper to our shorter companion paper [74] in which we solely concentrated on the application of our results and assessed the detectability of GB deviations in the Fourier-domain GW phase. In this paper, we present the explicit computations to produce the GW waveforms and phasing as well as the scalar waveform. Our methods and results are applicable to arbitrary sGB coupling strengths that lie within the theoretical and observational bounds [18,28], as well as general couplings that have remained unconstrained. We also calculate the equations of motion of the sources to 1PN order, based on the results of reference [61]. Having calculated the waveforms, we then focus on quasi-circular inspirals and calculate the energy flux carried off by radiation, as well as the GW phasing to which both the measurements and parametrized test of gravity such as [75] are very sensitive. Our results include higher order strong-field effects than previously computed, which may mimic biases in fundamental source parameters of BH binaries when analysing with GR-only GW waveforms. We also show that the effect of the GB scalar is distinct from the scalar field of an ST theory due to the presence of explicit 1PN GB coupling dependent terms. This has consequences for interpreting GW signals from BH-neutron star binaries when analyzed by beyond-GR theories [76]. Further, we discuss the importance of distinguishing different perspectives on the sGB action (i.e. as a phenomenological extension of GR or as resulting from string theory) when interpreting GW constraints as they correspond to different physical frames.In this work we compute, for the first time, analytical waveforms for the inspiral stage of the binary evolution with the effect of nonlinear higher curvature corrections.

        <p>This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we present the field equations for tensor and scalar perturbations and define the matter action for self-gravitating binaries. We cast the field equations into relaxed form in section 3, and outline the procedure for finding the solution at large distances from the source. In section 4, we calculate the near-zone contribution to gravitational and scalar waves for binary systems. We defer the calculation of far-zone contribution to appendix C because, as we show, it does not contribute to the final waveform at 1PN order. In section 5 we derive the equations of motion using the two-body Lagrangian from reference [77], and transform the waveforms to the center-of-mass (CM) frame. In section 6, we solve for the gravitational and scalar energy loss rate, from which we find the time domain and frequency domain waveforms in sections 7 and 8, respectively. In section 7, we also compare our results for the scalar waveform to the NR waveforms of reference [54] computed in the small coupling approximation. Finally, in section 9, we present the discussion and conclusions.This paper is organized as follows.

        <p>We note that action (1) may be interpreted in two distinct ways: (i) one may postulate that the action describes quadratic gravity corrections to GR in the physical (i.e. Jordan) frame, where matter fields are minimally coupled to the metric and results directly correspond to observables. This viewpoint is typically adopted in the literature on testing gravity (see e.g. references [32,60]) and corresponds to setting the conformal factor A(φ) = 1 in equation ( 1). (ii) If the action, instead, is regarded as the low-energy effective action of string theories, the conformal factor is nontrivial. From this perspective, equation (1) denotes the action in the Einstein frame, and one must transform any results to the Jordan (or 'string') frame in which observables are measured. For example, the bosonic sector of heterotic string theory is characterized by f (φ) = e -2φ for which the conformal factor is A(φ) = e φ (see e.g. reference [78]). Both of these interpretations of the action become reconciled in the weak-field regime, where A(φ) = e φ = 1 + O(φ). Nevertheless, it is important to remain aware of these assumptions when interpreting observational bounds on higher-curvature effects and their possible implications (or bounds) on underlying quantum gravity theories. In particular, a non-minimal coupling factor in Einstein frame would lead to additional polarization modes when converted to the Jordan frame. Ignoring such couplings would lead to the conclusion that a breathing scalar mode is absent in the sGB theory, in contrast to, for example, ST theories.We note that action (1) may be interpreted in two distinct ways: (i) one may postulate that the action describes quadratic gravity corrections to GR in the physical (i.e. Jordan) frame, where matter fields are minimally coupled to the metric and results directly correspond to observables.

        <p>To describe the action of compact self-gravitating binaries, one has to take the internal gravity of each object into consideration. Based on the approach pioneered by Eardley [79] for ST theories [79,80], and later generalized to Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theories [81], this can be done by describing the compact objects as point particles but with scalar-dependent total masses.

        <p>An important point to note is the scaling of the GB terms. Since the terms enter at O(c -2 ) in the PN expansion, they are a 1PN effect, yet, due to the dimensionless ratio α/r 2 , the GB contribution is suppressed at large separation compared to the other 1PN terms. This is not surprising as it encapsulates a different physical effect. This is similar to the case of tidal interactions in GR, where Newtonian tides at O(c 0 ) have the same scaling with separation r as 5PN point-mass terms [82]. Calculations of tidal effects in compact binaries involve a double expansion in PN and finite-size corrections [83]. Likewise, the GB term in equation ( 30) is the leading-order gravitational effect of the higher curvature corrections. However, since the GB effect first appears only at 1PN order, we can here keep the full dependence on the GB coupling without requiring an explicit double expansion, nor any assumptions on the coupling strength.An important point to note is the scaling of the GB terms.

Thus, by assuming the leading (quadrupole) part of the tensor radiation to be relative 0PN order, the scalar monopole and dipole moments will be relatively -1PN and -0.5PN, respectively.

Up to 2PN order terms, the gravitational constant G always appears in combination with ST parameter that is analogous to ᾱ, which implies that the effective gravitational coupling in these theories is Gᾱ to this order. However in sGB gravity, the GB higher curvature terms break this rescaling at 1PN order, as made explicit in the last line of equation (41). Thus, starting at the 1PN relative order, the effect of the scalar on the two-body dynamics in the two theories can in fact be distinguished.We see that the Lagrangian L AB decomposes into a piece that is structurally equivalent to the two-body Lagrangian in massless ST theories [80] plus a distinct GB-coupling dependent contribution.

        <p>By its very nature, the deviation from GR is most prominent in the high curvature regime, i.e. for small-mass BHs. Therefore, we consider quasi-circular BH binaries with a total mass of m = 15M and mass ratios q = 1/2 and q = 1/4. For q = 1 binaries, the deviations from GR waveforms are expected to be smaller due to the suppressed dipole radiation, as can also be seen in figure 2 of reference [74].By its very nature, the deviation from GR is most prominent in the high curvature regime, i.e. for small-mass BHs.

        <p>Figure 3 shows waveforms in the aforementioned two cases. The observer is viewing the orbit edge on, so that i = π/2, and thus only the h + (t) polarization is present. Due to the dissipation of energy in scalar field radiation, the inspiral of BH binaries in sGB is accelerated as compared to their GR counterpart and results in a GW phase shift. The scalar charge, and hence the scalar radiation, increases as the mass ratio decreases for fixed total mass of the binary. As can be seen in figure 3, the mass ratio has a high impact on the GW signal, which exhibits a larger phase shift for smaller mass ratios. Throughout the early inspiral evolution of the binaries, in both cases, the amplitudes of EdGB waves do not deviate significantly from the GR waveforms. This is because the GB coupling dependent terms are suppressed at large distances compared to other 1PN terms (see the discussion below equation ( 31)). Despite the amplitudes, the dephasing between EdGB and GR waveforms starts early in the evolution and could thus be a detectable feature.Figure 3 shows waveforms in the aforementioned two cases.

As can be seen in figure 3, the mass ratio has a high impact on the GW signal, which exhibits a larger phase shift for smaller mass ratios. Throughout the early inspiral evolution of the binaries, in both cases, the amplitudes of EdGB waves do not deviate significantly from the GR waveforms. This is because the GB coupling dependent terms are suppressed at large distances compared to other 1PN terms (see the discussion below equation ( 31)). Despite the amplitudes, the dephasing between EdGB and GR waveforms starts early in the evolution and could thus be a detectable feature.</p>

        <p>In figure 4 we display the scalar waveform emitted by quasi-circular binaries, corresponding to the gravitational waveforms shown in figure 3. In these examples, for the mass ratio q = 1/2, the scalar wave amplitude is suppressed with respect to the GW amplitude by an order of magnitude. As we decrease the mass ratio to q = 1/4, the increase of the scalar field amplitude during the late inspiral becomes stronger and, in fact, the amplitude becomes comparable to that of the gravitational radiation. In general, one expects the scalar radiation to increase with decreasing the mass ratio while keeping the total mass fixed. However, we should note that the PN approach is not reliable for extreme-mass-ratio systems.In figure 4 we display the scalar waveform emitted by quasi-circular binaries, corresponding to the gravitational waveforms shown in figure 3.

        <p>In figure 5 we show the NR scalar waveform for the l = m = 1 mode during the inspiral phase, and its comparison to the analytical results of this paper (red dashed curve) and that of reference [60] (blue dashed curve). The binary has a mass ratio of q = 1/4 and extraction radius R = 100 m. The waveforms are shifted in time such that t = 0 marks the merger time. We initially align the waves by minimizing the squared difference between the amplitude of the waveforms over an extended window in time, tt merger : {-1410, -900}. In this way, we avoid splitting the waves by introducing arbitrary fudge factors. Overall, we see an approximate factor of 1.5 improvement in the matching of analytical results to numerical data due to the new 0.5PN contributions, as compared to the results of reference [60]. Comparing the q = 1/2 waveforms shows a similar overall factor of improvement, and thus we do not show the plot here. The noise in the analytical amplitude is due to the precision of numerical data from which the phase evolution is extracted and does not affect the overall results. Based on these results, we claim that our analytical waveforms can thus be used as benchmarks for NR simulations.In figure 5 we show the NR scalar waveform for the l = m = 1 mode during the inspiral phase, and its comparison to the analytical results of this paper (red dashed curve) and that of reference [60] (blue dashed curve).

        <p>There is an important point to note regarding the interpretation of results in quadratic gravity. If the action ( 1) is taken to be in the Jordan frame, i.e. if matter is minimally coupled to the metric g μν , our results directly provide the waveforms that would be measured by GW detectors and they can be employed to derive observational bounds on quadratic gravity. However, if equation ( 1) represents the low-energy effective action, of a string theory then it is, strictly speaking, in the Einstein frame. That is, the waveforms would have to be transformed to the physical (i.e. Jordan or string) frame to connect between GW detections and observational bounds on string theory. While there is no distinction between the two frames to leading order in the weak-field approximation, where the conformal factor transforming between them is A(φ) = 1 + O(φ), we urge the reader (and tester of strong-field gravity) to caution outside this approximation.There is an important point to note regarding the interpretation of results in quadratic gravity.

        <p>The surface integral is evaluated on the boundary of the near zone ∂M as a sphere with radius R, such that we can write x i = Rn i and d 2 S k = R 2 nk . To evaluate this term we shall expand U and U ,k in inverse powers of R and ignore the integrands that depend on R. The R-independent piece of this specific surface integral contains the O(R -4 ) expansion of UU ,k which gives an integrand with odd number of unit vectors and thus vanishes (see equation ( 105)). For the first volume integral, substituting the Laplacian of U easily shows that -M UU ,kk x i j d 3 x = 4π A,B =A m A m B r x i j A . The contribution from the second volume integrals is zero. This can be shown by integrating-by-parts again, -2 M UU ,(i x j) d 3 x = -∂M U 2 x (i d 2 S j) + M U 2 δ i j d 3 x, which shows that the surface integral vanishes due to an odd number of unit vectors.
