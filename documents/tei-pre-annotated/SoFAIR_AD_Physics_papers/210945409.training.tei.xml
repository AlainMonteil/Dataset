        <p>The Crab Nebula is the brightest TeV gamma-ray source in the sky and has been used for the past 25 years as a reference source in TeV astronomy, for calibration and verification of new TeV instruments. The High Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC), completed in early 2015, has been used to observe the Crab Nebula at high significance across nearly the full spectrum of energies to which HAWC is sensitive. HAWC is unique for its wide field-of-view, nearly 2 sr at any instant, and its high-energy reach, up to 100 TeV. HAWC's sensitivity improves with the gamma-ray energy. Above ∼1 TeV the sensitivity is driven by the best background rejection and angular resolution ever achieved for a wide-field ground array.The Crab Nebula is the brightest TeV gamma-ray source in the sky and has been used for the past 25 years as a reference source in TeV astronomy, for calibration and verification of new TeV instruments.

        <p>We present a time-integrated analysis of the Crab using 507 live days of HAWC data from 2014 November to 2016 June. The spectrum of the Crab is fit to a function of the form φ(E) = φ 0 (E/E 0 ) -α-β•ln(E/E0) . The data is well-fit with values of α = 2.63 ± 0.03, β = 0.15 ± 0.03, and log 10 (φ 0 cm 2 s TeV) = -12.60 ± 0.02 when E 0 is fixed at 7 TeV and the fit applies between 1 and 37 TeV. Study of the systematic errors in this HAWC measurement is discussed and estimated to be ±50% in the photon flux between 1 and 37 TeV.We present a time-integrated analysis of the Crab using 507 live days of HAWC data from 2014 November to 2016 June.

        <p>Confirmation of the Crab flux serves to establish the HAWC instrument's sensitivity for surveys of the sky. The HAWC survey will exceed sensitivity of current-generation observatories and open a new view of 2/3 of the sky above 10 TeV.Confirmation of the Crab flux serves to establish the HAWC instrument's sensitivity for surveys of the sky.

        <p>The Crab Pulsar Wind Nebula (the Crab Nebula or the Crab) occupies a place of special distinction in the history of high-energy astrophysics. It was the first high-confidence TeV detection in 1989 using the Whipple telescope (Weekes et al. 1989) and is the brightest steady source in the Northern sky above 1 TeV. It has been observed with imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) since (Tanimori et al. 1998;Aharonian et al. 2004Aharonian et al. , 2006;;Celik 2008;Aleksić et al. 2015). The first observation using a ground array was the 2003 Milagro detection (Atkins et al. 2003), and the signal was subsequently seen in other ground arrays (Amenomori et al. 2009;Bartoli et al. 2015).The Crab Pulsar Wind Nebula (the Crab Nebula or the Crab) occupies a place of special distinction in the history of high-energy astrophysics.

        <p>The TeV emission arises from inverse-Compton (IC) up-scattering of low-energy ambient photons by energetic electrons accelerated in shocks surrounding the central pulsar (Atoyan &amp; Aharonian 1996). Photons from synchrotron emission of the electrons themselves are likely the dominant IC target with sub-dominant contributions from the cosmic microwave background and the extragalactic background light (Martín et al. 2012). Despite rare flaring emission below 1 TeV (Tavani et al. 2011;Abdo et al. 2011), and a potential TeV flare (Aielli et al. 2010), the Crab is generally believed to be steady at higher energies (Abramowski et al. 2014;Aliu et al. 2014;Bartoli et al. 2015). Consequently, the Crab Nebula has been adopted as the reference source in TeV astronomy and is a reliable beam of high-energy photons to use for calibrating and understanding new TeV gamma-ray instruments.The TeV emission arises from inverse-Compton (IC) up-scattering of low-energy ambient photons by energetic electrons accelerated in shocks surrounding the central pulsar (Atoyan &amp; Aharonian 1996).

        <p>The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory is a new instrument sensitive to multi-TeV hadron and gamma-ray air showers, operating at latitude of +19 • N at an altitude of 4,100 meters in the Sierra Negra, Mexico. HAWC consists of a large 22,000 m 2 area densely covered with 300 Water Cherenkov Detectors (WCDs), of which 294 have been instrumented. Each WCD consists of a 7.3-meter diameter, 5-meter tall steel tank lined with a plastic bladder and filled with purified water. Figure 1 shows a schematic of the WCD and an overhead view of the full instrument. At the bottom of each WCD, three 8-inch Hamamatsu R5912 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are anchored in an equilateral triangle of side length 3.2 meters, with one 10-inch high-quantum efficiency Hamamatsu R7081 PMT anchored at the center.The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory is a new instrument sensitive to multi-TeV hadron and gamma-ray air showers, operating at latitude of +19 • N at an altitude of 4,100 meters in the Sierra Negra, Mexico.

        <p>A high-energy photon impinging on the atmosphere above HAWC initiates an extensive electromagnetic air shower. The resulting mix of relativistic electrons, positrons and gamma rays propagates to the ground in a thin tortilla of particles at nearly the speed of light. Energetic particles that reach the instrument can interact in the water and produce optical light via Cherenkov radiation. The high altitude of HAWC sets the scale for the photon energy that can be detected. At HAWC's altitude, the shower from a 1 TeV photon from directly overhead will have about 7% of the original photon energy left when the shower reaches the ground. The fraction of energy reaching the ground rises to ∼28% at 100 TeV. The detector is fully efficient to gamma rays with a primary energy above ∼1 TeV. Lower-energy photons can be detected when they fluctuate to interact deeper in the atmosphere than typical.A high-energy photon impinging on the atmosphere above HAWC initiates an extensive electromagnetic air shower.

        <p>The voltages on the HAWC PMTs are chosen to match the PMT gains across the array. PMT pulses are amplified, shaped, and passed through two discriminators at approximately 1/4 and 4 PEs (Abeysekara et al. 2016) and digitized. The length of time that PMT pulses spend above these thresholds (time-over-threshold or ToT) is used to estimate the total amount of charge collected in the PMT. Noise arises from a number of sources including PMT afterpulsing, fragments of sub-threshold air showers, PMT dark noise, and other sources. The 8-inch PMTs have a hit rate (a hit being each time the PMT signal crosses the 1/4 PE threshold) due to the combined effect of these sources of 20-30 kHz and the 10-inch PMTs have a hit rate of 40-50 kHz.The voltages on the HAWC PMTs are chosen to match the PMT gains across the array.

        <p>The data from the front-end electronics is digitized with commercial time-to-digital converters (TDCs) and passed to a farm of computers for real-time triggering and processing. Events are preserved by the computer farm if they pass the trigger condition: a simple multiplicity trigger, requiring some number, N thresh , PMTs hit within 150 ns. Hits 500 ns prior to a trigger and up to 1000 ns after a trigger are also saved for reconstruction. During the operation of HAWC, N thresh has varied between 20-50. The trigger rate at the time of writing, due primarily to hadronic cosmic-ray air showers, is ∼24 kHz with N thresh = 28.The data from the front-end electronics is digitized with commercial time-to-digital converters (TDCs) and passed to a farm of computers for real-time triggering and processing.

        <p>The reconstruction process involves determining the direction, the likelihood for the event to be a photon, and the event's size. A first-look reconstruction is applied at the HAWC site. In this analysis, all the data has been reconstructed again (the fourth revision, or Pass 4, of the reconstruction process) off-site in order to have a uniform dataset and the best calibrations available. The chief background to gamma-ray observation is the abundant hadronic cosmic-ray population. Individual gamma-ray-induced air showers can be distinguished from cosmic-ray showers by their topology and the presence of deeply penetrating particles at the ground.The reconstruction process involves determining the direction, the likelihood for the event to be a photon, and the event's size.

        <p>The strength of HAWC over the IACT technique is that photon showers may be detected across the entire ∼ 2 sr field-of-view of the instrument, day or night, regardless of weather conditions. As such, HAWC is uniquely suited to study the long-duration light curve of objects and to search for flaring sources in real time. Additionally, since sources are observed on every transit, HAWC obtains thousands of hours of exposure on each source, greatly improving the sensitivity to the highest-energy photons. Section 2 outlines the algorithms by which the direction, size, and type (photon or hadron) of each shower is determined. Section 3 describes the identification of the gamma-ray signal from the Crab Nebula. The fit to the Crab energy spectrum, including a treatment of systematic errors, is described in Section 4. Finally, a discussion of the result is presented in Section 5, including a comparison to prior spectra measured by peer experiments and a computation of the sensitivity of the HAWC instrument, anchored in the agreement of the HAWC measurement to other experiments.The strength of HAWC over the IACT technique is that photon showers may be detected across the entire ∼ 2 sr field-of-view of the instrument, day or night, regardless of weather conditions.

        <p>Events from the detector are reconstructed to determine the arrival direction of the primary particle and the size of the resulting air shower on the ground, a proxy for the primary particle's energy.

        <p>To illustrate the event reconstruction, Figure 2 shows a strong gamma-ray candidate from the Crab Nebula. In Section 2.1, the simulation is briefly described as it is key to evaluating the reconstruction process. Section 2.2 describes the calibration, by which the time and light level in individual PMTs are determined. Section 2.3 discusses the selection of PMT signals for reconstruction and the event size measurement. The direction reconstruction occurs in two steps, first the core reconstruction, described in Section 2.4, and then the direction determination, described in Section 2.5. The air shower core, the dense concentration of particles along the direction of the original primary, is needed to make the best reconstruction of the air shower's direction since the air shower arrival front is delayed from a pure plane, depending on the distance from the core. The identification of photon candidates is presented in Section 2.6. The directional fit is iterated to suppress noise and this iteration is explained in Section 2.7.To illustrate the event reconstruction, Figure 2 shows a strong gamma-ray candidate from the Crab Nebula.

        <p>The HAWC instrument is modeled using a combination of community-standard simulation packages and custom software. The 
            <rs type="software">CORSIKA</rs> package (v
            <rs type="version">7.4000</rs>) is used for simulation of air showers, propagating the primary particles through the atmosphere to the ground (Heck et al. 1998). At ground level, a GEANT 4 simulation (v4.10.00) of the shower particles is used to propagate the ground-level particles through the HAWC tanks and to track the Cherenkov photons to the faces of the PMTs (Agostinelli et al. 2003).
        </p>
        <p>The response of the PMTs and the calibration are approximated with a custom simulation that assumes that recorded light is faithfully detected with some efficiency and an uncertainty in the logarithm of the total charge recorded. Decorrelated single PE noise is added. The absolute PMT efficiency for detecting Cherenkov photons is established by scaling the simulated PMT response to vertical muons to match data. Most muons passing through HAWC are minimum ionizing with nearly constant energy loss. Vertical muons, therefore, are a nearly constant light source and convenient for establishing to total PMT efficiency. Simulated events are subsequently reconstructed by the same procedure as experimental data to study the performance of the algorithms.The response of the PMTs and the calibration are approximated with a custom simulation that assumes that recorded light is faithfully detected with some efficiency and an uncertainty in the logarithm of the total charge recorded.

        <p>The first step in the reconstruction process is calibration, the processes by which true time and light level in each PMT are estimated from the TDC-measured threshold-crossing times of each PMT (Lauer 2013;Solares et al. 2016).The first step in the reconstruction process is calibration, the processes by which true time and light level in each PMT are estimated from the TDC-measured threshold-crossing times of each PMT (Lauer 2013;Solares et al. 2016).</p>
        <p>The calibration associates the measured ToT in each PMT with the true number of PEs. To give a sense of scale, the ToT for a single PE crossing the low-threshold discriminator (about 1/4 PE) is ∼100 ns. Above a few PEs, the higher-threshold (about 4 PEs) ToT is used for charge assignment and a high-threshold ToT of 400 ns roughly corresponds to a charge of 10 4 PEs. The time scale for these ToTs is determined by the shaping of the front-end electronics and is chosen to be longer than the characteristic arrival time distribution of PEs during an air shower so as to integrate the whole air shower arrival into one PMT hit.The calibration associates the measured ToT in each PMT with the true number of PEs.

        <p>Subsequent reconstruction algorithms treat all PMTs, the 8-inch and 10-inch, as identical, despite the larger size and greater efficiency of the 10-inch PMTs. To accommodate this, an effective charge Q eff is defined. For Q eff , PE values from the central 10-inch PMTs are scaled by a factor of 0.46 to place them on par with the 8-inch PMTs.Subsequent reconstruction algorithms treat all PMTs, the 8-inch and 10-inch, as identical, despite the larger size and greater efficiency of the 10-inch PMTs.

        <p>Finally, each PMT has a single calibrated timing offset that accounts for the different cable lengths and any other timing delays that may differ from PMT to PMT. These delays are measured to within a few ns by the calibration system and are refined to sub-ns precision by iterated fits to hadronic air showers. Since the hadronic background is isotropic, the point of maximum cosmic-ray density is overhead and the PMT timing pedestals are chosen to ensure this is true. A final small (∼0.2 • ) rotation of all events is performed to ensure that the Crab Nebula appears in its known location. Throughout the analysis, the Crab is assumed to be at a location of 83.63 • right ascension and 22.01 • declination, in the J2000.0 epoch, taken from Aharonian et al. (2004). While the pulsar position is known more precisely (e.g. Comella et al. (1969)), this precision is sufficient for use in HAWC. 2. Cuts used for the analysis. The definition of the size bin B is given by the fraction of available PMTs, f hit , that record light during the event. Larger events are reconstructed better and ψ68, the angular bin that contains 68% of the events, reduces dramatically for larger events. The parameters P and C (Section 2.6) characterize the charge topology and are used to remove hadronic air shower events. Events with a P less than indicated and a C greater than indicated are considered photon candidates. The cuts are established by optimizing the statistical significance of the Crab and trend toward harder cuts at larger size events. The number of excess events from the Crab in each B bin per transit is shown as well.Finally, each PMT has a single calibrated timing offset that accounts for the different cable lengths and any other timing delays that may differ from PMT to PMT.

        <p>As described in Section 1, the HAWC DAQ records 1.5 µs of data from all PMTs that have a hit during an air shower event. A subset of these hits are selected for the air shower fit. To be used for the air shower fit, hits must be found between -150 and +400 ns around the trigger time. Hits are removed if they occur shortly after a high-charge hit under the assumption that these hits are likely contaminated with afterpulses. Additionally, hits are removed if they have a pattern of TDC crossings that is not characteristic of real light; they cannot be calibrated accurately. Finally, each channel has an individual maximum calibrated charge, typically a few thousand PEs, but no more than 10 4 PEs, above which the PMTs are not used. Above ∼10 4 PEs, corresponding to a ToT of ∼400 ns, prompt afterpulsing in the PMTs can artificially lengthen the ToT measurement giving a false measurement. Channels are considered available for reconstruction if they have a live PMT taking data which has not been removed by one of these cuts.As described in Section 1, the HAWC DAQ records 1.5 µs of data from all PMTs that have a hit during an air shower event.

        <p>The angular error and the ability to distinguish photon events from hadron events is strongly dependent on the energy and size of events on the ground. We adopt analysis cuts and an angular resolution description that depends on this measured size. The data is divided into 9 size bins, B, as outlined in Table 2. The size of the event is defined as the ratio of the number of PMT hits used by the event reconstruction to the total number of PMTs available for reconstruction, f hit . This definition allows for relative stability of the binning when PMTs are occasionally taken out of service.The angular error and the ability to distinguish photon events from hadron events is strongly dependent on the energy and size of events on the ground.

        <p>For this analysis, events are only used if they have more than 6.7% of the available PMTs seeing light. Since typically 1000 PMTs are available, typically a minimum of 70 PMTs is needed for an event. This is substantially higher than the trigger threshold. The data between the trigger threshold and the threshold for B = 1 in this analysis consists of real air showers, and techniques to recover these events and lower the energy threshold, beyond what is presented here, are under study.For this analysis, events are only used if they have more than 6.7% of the available PMTs seeing light.

        <p>Figure 3 shows the distribution of true energies as a function of the B of the events. The distribution of energies naturally depends heavily on the source itself, both its spectrum and the angle at which it culminates during its transit. A pure power-law spectrum with a shape of E -2.63 and a declination of 20 • was assumed for this figure.

        <p>Bin B = 9 bears particular attention. It is an "overflow" bin containing events which have between 84% and 100% of the PMTs in the detector seeing light. Typically, a 10 TeV photon will hit nearly every sensor and the B variable has no dynamic range above this energy. This limit is not intrinsic to HAWC and variables that utilize the light level seen in PMTs on the ground, similar to what was used in the original sensitivity study (Abeysekara et al. 2013), have dynamic range above 100 TeV. These variables, not used in this analysis, will improve the identification of high-energy events. This is discussed farther in Section 5.3.Bin B = 9 bears particular attention.

        <p>To first order, the air shower particles arrive on a plane defined by the speed of light and direction of the primary particle. In fact, the shower front has a slight conical shape centered at the air shower core. Several effects lead to this shape. First, particles far from the core arrive due to multiple scattering and longer travel distances. Second, the multiple scattering of particles at the edges of the shower leads to a broader arrival time distribution than at the core. Since the number of particles decreases with increasing distance from the shower core there are fewer opportunities to sample from the particle arrival time distribution. This decrease in sampling leads to a delay in the measured arrival time of the shower.To first order, the air shower particles arrive on a plane defined by the speed of light and direction of the primary particle.

        <p>In the present analysis, we use the reconstructed core location to correct for this effect. A combined curvature/sampling correction -a function of the distance of hits from the shower core and the total charge recorded in the PMT -is utilized for this correction. The curvature/sampling correction is based on a combination of simulation and Crab observations. The rough functional form is tabulated using gamma-ray simulation. The simulation-optimized curvature/sampling correction yields a measured angular resolution approximately a factor of 2 worse than predicted from simulation. The origin of this discrepancy is likely due to some oversimplification of the electronics simulation. Repeated fits to the Crab have yielded a modification to the curvature/sampling correction that is a simple quadratic function of the distance between a hit and the shower core. While the origin of the discrepancy is under investigation, it amounts to a relatively small correction, approximately 2 ns/100 meters. Nonetheless, the improvement in the angular resolution is nearly a factor of two for all B. Remaining disagreement between the simulated and measured angular resolution is adopted as a systematic error.In the present analysis, we use the reconstructed core location to correct for this effect.

The effective light level Q eff falls off for hits further from the shower core in both showers, but in the hadronic shower there are sporadic high-charge hits far from the air shower's center. This clumpiness is characteristic of hadronic showers and arises from a combination of penetrating particles (primarily muons) and hadronic sub-showers which are largely absent in photon-induced showers.

        <p>Knowing the angular resolution is critical to subsequent steps of the analysis. Figure 8 indicates that the simulated angular resolution is in good agreement with measurements of the Crab Nebula. This is important because the angular resolution of HAWC for objects at declinations above and below the Crab will differ. While the measured PSF at the position of the Crab cannot be easily extrapolated to other declinations, the simulation can be used to predict the shape of the PSF at any declination. Therefore, the data-simulation agreement shown in Figure 8 is an important verification step. The measurements are compared to simulation. The measured and predicted angular resolutions are close enough that that using the simulated angular resolution for measuring spectra is a sub-dominant systematic error.Knowing the angular resolution is critical to subsequent steps of the analysis.

This is important because the angular resolution of HAWC for objects at declinations above and below the Crab will differ. While the measured PSF at the position of the Crab cannot be easily extrapolated to other declinations, the simulation can be used to predict the shape of the PSF at any declination. Therefore, the data-simulation agreement shown in Figure 8 is an important verification step. The measurements are compared to simulation. The measured and predicted angular resolutions are close enough that that using the simulated angular resolution for measuring spectra is a sub-dominant systematic error.</p>
        <p>The two parameters described in Section 2.6, the compactness, C, and PINCness, P, are used to remove hadrons and keep gamma rays. Events are removed using simple cuts on these variables and the cuts depend on the size bin, B, of the event. The cuts are chosen to maximize the statistical significance with which the Crab is detected in the first 337 days of the 507-day dataset. Concerns of using the data itself for optimizing the cuts are minimal with a source as significant as the Crab.The two parameters described in Section 2.6, the compactness, C, and PINCness, P, are used to remove hadrons and keep gamma rays.

        <p>Table 2 shows the cuts chosen for each B bin. The rates of events across the entire sky going into the 9 bins, after hadron rejection cuts, vary dramatically, from ∼500 Hz for B=1 to ∼0.05 Hz for B=9. Figure 10 shows the predicted efficiency for gamma rays (from simulation) along with the measured efficiency for hadronic background under these cuts. The efficiency of photons is universally greater than 30% while keeping, at best, only 2 in 10 3 hadrons. The efficacy of the cuts is a strong function of the event size, primarily because larger cosmic-ray events produce many more muons than gamma-ray events of a similar size. Good efficiency for photons is maintained across all event sizes with hadron efficiency approaching 1×10 -3 for high-energy events.Table 2 shows the cuts chosen for each B bin.

        <p>Figure 15 shows the computed differential sensitivity of HAWC to sources at the declination of the Crab utilizing the procedure of (Abeysekara et al. 2013) with the analysis presented here. A point source of differential photon spectrum E -2.63 is simulated and fitted using the full likelihood fit. The flux required to be detected at 5σ 50% of the time is shown for each bin, B. The lines for each B are shown with a width corresponding to the width required to contain 68% of the events under the E -2.63 hypothesis. A correction is made to adjust the B separation to a quarter decade in true energy, and the result is fitted. The sensitivity prediction from (Abeysekara et al. 2013) suffered from uncertain background at the highest energies. Now, with more than a year of data, we know the background precisely and can set the cuts appropriately. This has resulted in a more accurate (and more sensitive) analysis above 10 TeV. Below about 1 TeV, for a number of reasons, the sensitivity is somewhat worse than predicted in the original study. The background is larger than the original simulation-only prediction. Furthermore, in the current analysis we employ a relatively high cut (defined by B = 1) so that improperly modeled noise can be neglected.

A point source of differential photon spectrum E -2.63 is simulated and fitted using the full likelihood fit. The flux required to be detected at 5σ 50% of the time is shown for each bin, B. The lines for each B are shown with a width corresponding to the width required to contain 68% of the events under the E -2.63 hypothesis. A correction is made to adjust the B separation to a quarter decade in true energy, and the result is fitted. The sensitivity prediction from (Abeysekara et al. 2013) suffered from uncertain background at the highest energies. Now, with more than a year of data, we know the background precisely and can set the cuts appropriately. This has resulted in a more accurate (and more sensitive) analysis above 10 TeV. Below about 1 TeV, for a number of reasons, the sensitivity is somewhat worse than predicted in the original study. The background is larger than the original simulation-only prediction. Furthermore, in the current analysis we employ a relatively high cut (defined by B = 1) so that improperly modeled noise can be neglected. (Park 2016;Holler et al. 2016;Aleksić et al. 2016) and Large Area Telescope on the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope b . We show the flux, assuming a source with a differential energy spectrum E -2.63 , required to produce a 5σ detection 50% of the time. This flux is shown in light red for each of the 9 B bins, with a width in energy corresponding to the central 68% containment energies in each bin. These values are adjusted to find the equivalent quarter-decade-separated flux sensitivities, and a fit to these values is shown in dark red.

        <p>The main limitation of this analysis is the reliance on the number of PMTs, used for the definition of B, to simultaneously constrain the energy of photons, the angular resolution, and photon/hadron efficiency. Figure 3 shows that this is a poor energy estimation with each bin B spanning roughly an order of magnitude of energy. More critically, an overhead ∼10 TeV photon can trigger nearly every PMT in HAWC if the core lands near the center of the detector. Consequently B = 9 is an overflow bin of everything above 10 TeV. These limitations can be removed with an event parameter that accounts for the light level in the event and the specific geometry and inclination angle of events. Approaches like this are under development. The planned deployment of a sparse "outrigger" array should further increase the sensitivity to photons above 10 TeV (Sandoval 2016).The main limitation of this analysis is the reliance on the number of PMTs, used for the definition of B, to simultaneously constrain the energy of photons, the angular resolution, and photon/hadron efficiency.
