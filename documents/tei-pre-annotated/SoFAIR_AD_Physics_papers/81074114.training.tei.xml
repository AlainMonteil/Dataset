        <p>Test beam measurements at the test beam facilities of DESY have been conducted to characterise the performance of the EUDET-type beam telescopes originally developed within the EUDET project. The beam telescopes are equipped with six sensor planes using MIMOSA 26 monolithic active pixel devices. A programmable Trigger Logic Unit provides trigger logic and time stamp information on particle passage. Both data acquisition framework and offline reconstruction software packages are available. User devices are easily integrable into the data acquisition framework via predefined interfaces. The biased residual distribution is studied as a function of the beam energy, plane spacing and sensor threshold. Its standard deviation at the two centre pixel planes using all six planes for tracking in a 6 GeV electron/positron-beam is measured to be (2.88 ± 0.08) μm. Iterative track fits using the formalism of General Broken Lines are performed to estimate the intrinsic resolution of the individual pixel planes. The mean intrinsic resolution over the six sensors used is found to be (3.24 ± 0.09) μm. With a 5 GeV electron/positron beam, the track resolution halfway between the two inner pixel planes using an equidistant plane spacing of 20 mm is estimated to (1.83 ± 0.03) μm assuming the measured intrinsic resolution. Towards lower beam energies the track resolution deteriorates due to increasing multiple scattering. Threshold studies show an optimal working point of the MIMOSA 26 sensors at a sensor threshold of between five and six times their RMS noise. Measurements at different plane spacings are used to calibrate the amount of multiple scattering in the material traversed and allow for corrections to the predicted angular scattering for electron beams.Test beam measurements at the test beam facilities of DESY have been conducted to characterise the performance of the EUDET-type beam telescopes originally developed within the EUDET project.

        <p>Beam telescopes are vital tools for R&amp;D projects focussing on position sensitive particle detection sensors. These range from collider-specific detectors with high radiation tolerance [1,2], high resolution and low material requirements [3] to medical applications [4], among others. Complementary to sensor simulations using finite element analysis tools, test beam studies are used at various stages of sensor and read-out chip development. Such test beam studies are well suited and often used for the evaluation of the performance of a detector prototype.Beam telescopes are vital tools for R&amp;D projects focussing on position sensitive particle detection sensors.

        <p>Within the Integrated Infrastructure Initiative funded by the EU in the 6th Framework Programme, the EUDET project [5] aimed at providing a high-resolution pixel beam telescope for test beam studies [6]. The guidelines for the development were to allow for an easy integration of custom data acquisition systems covering a wide range of readout schemes, latencies, and acquisition rates. This is achieved by well defined interfaces on both the hardware and the software level. Fast LHC-type tracking devices are integrable in the same manner as slower rolling-shutter readout devices.Within the Integrated Infrastructure Initiative funded by the EU in the 6th Framework Programme, the EUDET project [5] aimed at providing a high-resolution pixel beam telescope for test beam studies [6].

        <p>The EUDET-type beam telescope each consist of six pixel detector planes equipped with fine-pitch MIMOSA 26 sensors [7], the mechanics for precise positioning of the device under test (DUT) and the telescope planes in the beam, a Trigger Logic Unit (TLU) providing trigger capabilities and a data acquisition system. The chosen design meets most user requirements in terms of easy integration capabilities, spatial resolution, and trigger rates. The telescope planes are designed and built to keep the material budget as low as possible in order to achieve an excellent track resolution even at the rather low particle energies of up to 6 GeV at the DESY test beam facilities.The EUDET-type beam telescope each consist of six pixel detector planes equipped with fine-pitch MIMOSA 26 sensors [7], the mechanics for precise positioning of the device under test (DUT) and the telescope planes in the beam, a Trigger Logic Unit (TLU) providing trigger capabilities and a data acquisition system.

        <p>The original EUDET beam telescope, which was modified to become the AIDA telescope, is operated at SPS beamline H6 (CERN). Responding to the increasing demand of the sensor R&amp;D community, several replicas, collectively called EUDET-type beam telescopes, have been built since then: ACONITE for the ATLAS group, which is also operated at the beamline H6, ANEMONE at ELSA (University of Bonn), the copy for the Carlton University called CALADIUM, and two copies, DATURA and DURANTA, which are operated at DESY. Within the AIDA2020 project, another copy is going to be built -operation is foreseen at the PS beamline (CERN). All replicas are based on the MIMOSA 26 sensors and are equipped with the same data acquisition system and software framework. The EUDET telescope has been used since 2007 in various stages of development by hundreds of users and played an important role in sensor studies employed by a wide community. From January 2013 until March 2014 alone, about 300 users utilised an EUDET-type beam telescope at DESY for a total of 80 user weeks. The results reported here are based on data taken with DATURA at test beam area 21 at DESY-II and are comparable to other beam telescope copies with a similar thickness of the epitaxial layer [8].The original EUDET beam telescope, which was modified to become the AIDA telescope, is operated at SPS beamline H6 (CERN).

        <p>For this work, data have been taken at the DESY-II test beam facilities [9]. The DESY-II electron/positron synchrotron at the DESY site in Hamburg has a circumference of 292.8 m and is mainly used as an injector for the PETRA-III storage ring. However, it also supplies beam to three test beam areas, one of them being the test beam area 21. Its dipole magnets operate in a sinusoidal ramping mode with a frequency of 12.5 Hz. Therefore, one DESY-II cycle takes 80 ms, and the bunch length is around 30 ps. The DESY-II synchrotron is equipped with movable carbon fibres. If positioned in the beam, bremsstrahlung photons are created, escaping the beam line tangentially. Subsequently, the photons are converted to electron/positron pairs on a secondary metal target. Their energy distribution reaches up to 6 GeV. Using a dipole magnet, this secondary electron/positron beam is spread out. A collimator can be used to select certain energy ranges of the beams reaching the experimental halls with an achievable rate of about 10 kHz to 100 kHz. A more detailed description of the test beams at DESY-II can be found in reference [10].For this work, data have been taken at the DESY-II test beam facilities [9].

        <p>The MIMOSA 26 sensors used for precise spatial measurements of particle trajectories are manufactured with the AMS 350 nm CMOS technology [7]. Each MIMOSA 26 sensor consists of pixels sized 18.4 μm × 18.4 μm, which are arranged in 1152 columns and 576 rows. This adds up to a total of about six hundred thousand readout channels per sensor, covering an active area of about 21.2 × 10.6 mm. The specifications of the MIMOSA 26 sensors quote a thickness of 50 μm. Measurements with a digital microscope reveal an average thickness over the six sensors used of (54.5 ± 3.6) μm. Free charge carriers produced in the underlying 20 μm high resistivity (about 400 cm) epitaxial layer 1 are collected via drift (diffusion) in depleted (undepleted) regions. The binary resolution of 5.3 μm is improved by charge sharing, i.e. the collection of charge at adjacent pixels and subsequent calculation of the centre of gravity, as is shown in the "Track resolution studies" section.The MIMOSA 26 sensors used for precise spatial measurements of particle trajectories are manufactured with the AMS 350 nm CMOS technology [7].

        <p>The MIMOSA 26 sensors are read out with a rolling-shutter, taking 16 cycles of an 80 MHz clock per row, with all columns being read out in parallel. This allows for correlated double sampling and zero suppression on-chip with the digital circuitry placed outside the active pixel array. At this clock frequency, the MIMOSA 26 integration time equals 115.2 μs, allowing for about 8680 frames to be read out per second. The expected maximum rate of detectable particles through the active area is estimated to be about 1 MHz/cm 2 due to the limited on-chip buffer size. The detection threshold is programmable via so-called JTAG files. These provide configurations with different threshold levels in integer multiples ξ n of the RMS noise of the individual planes. A sensor threshold setting of ξ n = 6 therefore corresponds to a collected charge in a single pixel of at least six times the noise. At this threshold, the average noise occupancy per pixel is measured to be about 6 • 10 -5 per readout frame at room temperature [11].The MIMOSA 26 sensors are read out with a rolling-shutter, taking 16 cycles of an 80 MHz clock per row, with all columns being read out in parallel.

        <p>Every pixel sensor is mounted within an aluminium jig, three jigs are in turn mounted on each of the two aluminium arms. The jigs feature a beam window around the position of the sensor location, minimising the material budget. Lightproof Kapton foils of 25 μm thickness protect the sensors on each side. The overall material of the beam telescope thus amounts to 300 μm of silicon and 300 μm of Kapton. The two telescope arms, usually one up-and one downstream of the DUT, are movable along the direction of the beam in order to allow for variably sized DUTs to be fitted into the set-up. The minimal distance between two sensors is given by the jig thickness of 20 mm, the maximal distance is restricted by the length of the aluminium arms to 150 mm at equidistant spacing. Furthermore, the jigs are cooled keeping the MIMOSA 26 sensors at a constant temperature of typically 18°C for stable operation. The entire beam telescope is placed on a rotatable frame easing adjustment of its orientation parallel to the beam. Additionally, this frame is mounted on a sturdy structure providing stability over time and wheels for easy transportation.Every pixel sensor is mounted within an aluminium jig, three jigs are in turn mounted on each of the two aluminium arms.

        <p>Four Hamamatsu PMT assemblies with scintillators and lightguides, two in the front and two in the back of the telescope, define the spatial acceptance for triggers. The crossed scintillators on either side of the beam telescope define a rectangular acceptance window of 20 mm × 10 mm matching the MIMOSA 26 sensor area. The TLU is based on a commercial Spartan 3 board and features a coincidence unit with discriminator boards accepting up to four PMT input signals. Additionally, it is equipped with several custommade add-on PCBs allowing for an easy integration of user DAQ systems. Providing a programmable logic, the TLU takes a trigger decision based on its four input channels. As interface to the beam telescope DAQ and other user DAQs, the TLU provides RJ45 connectors with four LVDS pairs carrying the trigger clock, busy, reset, and trigger signals. The trigger clock and the busy line are inputs to the TLU, whereas the reset and the trigger line are signals produced by the TLU. The trigger signal is distributed to all DAQ systems on the trigger line. A busy signal is accepted by the TLU from each integrated DAQ individually vetoing subsequent triggers as long as the busy signal is high. More details are available in references [13,14].

        <p>Three different handshake modes handling the trigger/busy signals are available, one of them being the no-handshake mode, in which the TLU issues a fixed-length pulse on the trigger line with the busy line being disregarded. In simple handshake mode, the assertion of a trigger is replied by the integrated DAQ systems by asserting a signal on the busy line. The TLU then de-asserts the trigger and waits for the busy line going low. The trigger data handshake mode uses the same scheme as in the simple handshake mode, but additionally the current trigger data are transferred on the trigger line: after the trigger has been deasserted, the trigger number is clocked out.Three different handshake modes handling the trigger/busy signals are available, one of them being the no-handshake mode, in which the TLU issues a fixed-length pulse on the trigger line with the busy line being disregarded.

        <p>The zero-suppressed hit data generated by the MIMOSA 26 sensors are transmitted over a ribbon cable to the auxiliary boards, which establish the connection to the data concentrator board collecting the data from all six sensors and the trigger/busy lines from the TLU. The signals from the concentrator board are acquired by a COTS 2 DAQ system built around the National Instrument (NI) PXIe crate architecture. A custom-made firmware running on a Virtex 5 FPGA embedded in a FlexRIO board (PXIe 7962R) acquires and deserialises the 12 serial links -two per sensor -at 80 Mb/s, detects triggers on the trigger line and reads the trigger data, which are the bottom 15 bits of the trigger counter. The resulting data stream of 960 Mb/s is read by the CPU (PXIe 8130) from the PXIe bus via a DMA channel and processed on-line by software. Data packets on which the TLU has triggered are selected, demultiplexed and actual frames built. The data are then available to the EUDAQ framework (cf. "The EUDAQ data acquisition framework" section), and an event is written to disk in normal handshake mode, only if a trigger has been raised for a certain telescope readout frame. This co-development, i.e. sharing processing tasks between firmware and software, allows for high flexibility for system upgrades. The presented DAQ architecture is able to read six MIMOSA 26 sensors without any dead-time at up to 8680 frames/s.

        <p>The modular cross-platform data acquisition framework 
            <rs type="software">EUDAQ</rs> [17] has been designed and developed to serve as flexible and simple-to-use data taking software for the EUDETtype beam telescopes, allowing for easy integration of other devices. It consists of completely independent modules communicating via TCP/IP enabling a distributed data acquisition with modules running on separate machines. Currently, 
            <rs type="software">EUDAQ</rs> is designed for synchronous DAQ systems requiring one event per trigger per attached subdetector system before building the global event. Thus, the trigger rate is always limited by the slowest device.
        </p>
        <p>The central interaction point for users with the framework is the Run Control and its graphical user interface (GUI). All other modules connect to the Run Control at startup and receive additional information from there during operation such as the commands for starting and stopping a DAQ run. The GUI provides all controls necessary to the user on shift. Another important user interface is the Log Collector, gathering logging information from all modules and displaying them in one unified logging window. Log files are stored along with the recorded data files for later reference.The central interaction point for users with the framework is the Run Control and its graphical user interface (GUI).

        <p>The actual detector data are delivered to the framework by so-called Producers. Producers are the links between the EUDAQ framework and the subdetector systems such as the beam telescope, the TLU, or user DAQ systems. They interface with the 
            <rs type="software">EUDAQ</rs> library and provide a set of commands to be called by the 
            <rs type="software">Run Control</rs>. This simple interface scheme eases the integration of user DAQ systems into the software framework. The data read out from the detectors by the individual Producers are sent to the so-called Data Collector. This Data Collector is responsible for the event building, i.e. the correlation of events from all subdetector systems to single global events comprising all data belonging to one trigger. Basic sanity checks such as testing the consistency of event numbers reported by the individual subdetectors are executed.
        </p>
        <p>To ensure data quality during data acquisition, the Online Monitor tool is available. It connects to the Data Collector requesting a fixed fraction of the recorded events (e.g. one out of a hundred) to fully decode all subdetector data and build basic plots such as hit maps or correlation plots. Thereby, data quality monitoring verifying that the different devices are synchronized in time and all within the geometrical trigger acceptance, is possible during data taking.To ensure data quality during data acquisition, the Online Monitor tool is available.

Figure 3 shows the analysis strategy of the framework starting from the recorded detector response to the final reconstructed particle tracks.

        <p>The data presented were taken in 2015 using DATURA, an EUDET-type beam telescope, which was operated with EUDAQ, cf. the "Components of the EUDET-type beam telescopes" and "The EUDAQ data acquisition framework" sections. Results shown in this section have been obtained using the 
            <rs type="software">EUTelescope</rs> software described in the "Offline analysis and reconstruction using EUTelescope" section. The set-up does not include any additional DUT, only six MIMOSA 26 telescope planes. Track fits are performed using the GBL formalism and track residuals, i.e. the distance between the track fit and the measured hit, are calculated for each telescope plane. The intrinsic resolution of the sensor planes is derived from data and used as input for track resolution predictions.

        <p>After conversion from raw MIMOSA 26 data to the LCIO data format, a hot pixel search is performed marking pixels with firing frequencies above a certain threshold. Clusters are formed from fired, adjacent pixels and translated from two-dimensional entities on the individual telescope planes into hits in a global three-dimensional reference frame.After conversion from raw MIMOSA 26 data to the LCIO data format, a hot pixel search is performed marking pixels with firing frequencies above a certain threshold.

        <p>Clusters containing at least one hot pixel are removed from the analysis. Triplets are built from hits in the three upstream and three downstream planes separately: First, doublets are defined by straight lines from all hits in plane 0 to all hits in plane 2. A valid triplet is found, if a matching hit in plane 1 is present within a matching distance of 100 μm, non-valid triplets are discarded. Triplet isolation is ensured by rejecting all triplets whose extrapolation at a chosen z-coordinate approaches other triplet extrapolations closer than 300 μm, the z-coordinate being the centre between plane 2 and plane 3. The procedure is repeated for the downstream planes. Matching triplets from the up-and downstream planes are identified by isolated triplets that intersect within a radius of 100 μm, again at the centre between plane 2 and plane 3. In turn, GBL tracks are formed by the six hits belonging to the matched triplets. For offline alignment, the GBL tracks are passed to Millepede-II in order to determine shift and rotation alignment constants for every telescope plane. Alignment constants of the sensitive coordinates are determined to submicron precision and are hence much smaller than the intrinsic resolution of the detectors used. After applying the alignment corrections, the above track finding is repeated, and GBL tracks are calculated based on the corrected hits. These tracks can be formed in a biased or in an unbiased way, where biased tracks include the measured hit information of every plane in contrast to unbiased tracks, that omit the hit information of the plane under investigation. Finally, a fiducial cut discards tracks at the border of the sensors and a cut on the χ 2 -probability for the given number of degrees of freedom rejects track with outliers from the further analysis.Clusters containing at least one hot pixel are removed from the analysis.

        <p>The beam energy is varied by 5 %. The original systematic uncertainty of the standard deviation 0 of 11 % is experimentally constrained to 3 %, as is shown in the "Performance measurements with DATURA" subsection. In order to estimate the effect of the chosen fit range on the derived intrinsic resolution, the fit range is varied up and down by one standard deviation around a centre value of 2 standard deviations. All systematic uncertainty contributions for the two set-ups are listed in Table 1. The impact of systematic uncertainties on the result is similar between the biased and the unbiased methodology. In addition to the above mentioned contributions per plane, there is a systematic uncertainty of the method itself, as it predicts slightly different intrinsic resolutions for each plane, which changes between geometries, i.e. it is not dominantly caused by an actual difference in intrinsic resolution. The impact of the variance between the width of the pull distributions for different sensors on the intrinsic resolution is therefore included in the table.

        <p>As described in the "Methodology and systematics" subsection, the tuned amount of multiple scattering used as input to GBL is determined by varying κ iteratively until the resulting intrinsic resolution for the two considered geometries agree.

        <p>This average is taken over all twelve measurements of the telescope (two dimensions per plane). The uncertainty is purely of systematic nature and is extracted using Table 1. The result implies that the average cluster contains more than one pixel and that charge sharing is the underlying cause for an intrinsic resolution better than the binary one. Indeed, the average clustersize at ξ n = 6 is about 3.3 pixel. The result is consistent with earlier analyses, which yielded intrinsic resolutions of σ int ≈ 3.4 μm [31] and σ int ≈ 3.5 μm [11].This average is taken over all twelve measurements of the telescope (two dimensions per plane).

        <p>The above method is repeated for different beam energies at a fixed threshold ξ n = 6. This allows for the determination of κ as a function of the beam energy. The correlation is shown in Fig. 6a for both biased and unbiased track fits. For biased track fits, κ is found to be constant at a value of κ = 0.753 ± 0.013 in the energy range covered, which translates to a tuned input of about -25 % with respect to Eq. ( 2). This value of κ has also been used for the predictions in Fig. 5a andb. For unbiased track fits, κ slightly increases from 0.87 at 2 GeV to 0.94 at 6 GeV with a precision of a single measurement of about 2 %.

In Fig. 7a the telescope triplet efficiency dependence on the sensor threshold is shown for various beam energies and sensor spacings. Statistical uncertainties are negligible. Systematic uncertainties are insignificant due to a precise alignment and the sufficiently large margin d. For thresholds ξ n = 5 and ξ n = 6 the efficiency is measured to 99.6 % and 99.4 %, respectively, and the efficiency varies by less than 0.1 % between different geometries and energy settings. With increasing threshold, the efficiency decreases to about 82 % at ξ n = 12. Towards lower thresholds, the efficiency also decreases, which seems counter-intuitive, but is related to an increasing number of hot pixels. An observed decrease in efficiency by 3.5 % from threshold ξ n = 5 to ξ n = 3 can be reasonably appointed to the about 1 % hot pixels in a plane at threshold ξ n = 3, since all clusters containing at least one hot pixel are removed from the analysis. The threshold level affects not only the efficiency, but also the intrinsic resolution. With an increased threshold, a hit is formed on average from smaller clusters which deteriorates its position estimate. A deterioration also occurs towards lower thresholds, which allow for an increased number of noise induced signals to pass the zero-suppression on the chip.A margin d = 50 μm is chosen for 6 GeV and dz = 20 mm, which is scaled with the inverse energy and the plane distance dz between measurements.

In order to achieve the best possible resolution, the inner MIMOSA 26 planes should therefore be positioned as close as possible to the DUT, i.e. dz DUT is to be minimised. In addition, Fig. 8a shows, that the optimal plane spacing dz depends on the actual DUT size along the beam direction and its material budget. For instance for a DUT with a material budget of ε DUT = 0.001 (solid lines) at 5 GeV, a narrow configuration shows a better track resolution for dz DUT &lt; 74 mm, while a wide configuration is favoured for dz DUT &gt; 74 mm. The intersection is marked with a black circle in Fig. 8a. The position of the intersection depends on the material budget of the DUT ε DUT and shifts to smaller dz DUT with increasing material budget. At SPS energies, the resolution functions for the wide and the narrow configuration do not intersect, with the narrow configuration showing a slightly better track resolution at the DUT. However, the difference is less than 0.5 μm for z DUT = 100 mm even at ε DUT = 0.03.

However, a plane spacing of dz = 150 mm is preferred, if dz DUT is 60 mm or larger. Intersections are marked with open circles. At 120 GeV, the intersection for dz DUT = 100 mm occurs at a DUT material budget of ε DUT = 0.2, which is considerably larger compared to the case of DESY beam energies.
