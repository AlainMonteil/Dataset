        <p>Symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum (SP-BICs) are one of the most intensively studied BICs. Typically, SP-BICs must be converted into quasi-BICs (QBICs) by breaking the unit cell's symmetry so that they can be accessed by the external excitation. The symmetry-broken usually results in a varied resonance wavelength of QBICs which are also highly sensitive to the asymmetry parameters. In this work, we demonstrate that QBICs with a stable resonance wavelength can be realized by breaking translational symmetry in an all-dielectric metasurface. The unit cell of metasurface is made of a silicon nanodisk dimer. The Q-factor of QBICs is precisely tuned by changing the Shaojun You and Mimi Zhou contributed equally to this work.Symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum (SP-BICs) are one of the most intensively studied BICs.

        <p>All-dielectric metasurfaces have received tremendous attention in the past decades due to their extraordinary optical properties [1,2]. Similar to metallic nanostructures supporting plasmonic resonances, they provide multipolar electric and magnetic resonances known as Mie resonances. On the other hand, they have lower intrinsic losses than their counterparts of noble metals. These two unique properties render them become ideal platforms for enhancing light-matter interactions and developing high-performance photonic devices. For example, they have been used to realize metalens with high efficiency [3][4][5], lasing [6][7][8], sensing [9][10][11], and enhanced generations [12][13][14][15]. At the early stage, much attention has been paid to the low-order Mie resonances with relatively low-quality factors (Q-factors), such as electric and magnetic dipole resonances. The moderate Q-factor of Mie resonance is always accompanied by moderate electric field confinement, which may limit light-matter coupling strength.All-dielectric metasurfaces have received tremendous attention in the past decades due to their extraordinary optical properties [1,2].

        <p>Recently, all-dielectric metasurfaces have been demonstrated to support optical bound states in the continuum (BICs) with infinite Q-factors [16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24]. BICs are the eigenstates with forbidden radiation, which are perfectly decoupled from the exterior environment though they are localized within the continuum [25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42]. Typically, they must be first converted into quasi-BICs (QBICs) with finite but still high Q-factors so that they can be excited by external sources, such as plane wave incidence. Among a diverse family of BICs, symmetry-protected BICs are the most intensively studied because they can be easily found in the dielectric metasurface whose unit cell follows certain symmetry. Usually, QBICs are induced by introducing in-plane symmetry broken, such as removing or adding parts of nanodisk [9,14,16,27,[43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51]. The Q-factors of QBICs are deliberately tailored by the asymmetry parameters. Nevertheless, their resonance wavelengths are also tuned with the increasing asymmetry parameters. In some applications, creating a QBIC with a tunable Q-factor but a stable resonance wavelength is desirable.Recently, all-dielectric metasurfaces have been demonstrated to support optical bound states in the continuum (BICs) with infinite Q-factors [16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24].

        <p>In this work, we demonstrate that a dimer-based dielectric metasurface supports toroidal dipole (TD) dominated BICs. QBICs are realized by changing the interspacing between nanodisk dimers instead of removing or adding parts of the nanodisk to create the reflection symmetry-broken. Compared with previous symmetrybroken induced QBICs, such BICs have almost constant resonance wavelength, while their Q-factors are tuned carefully by controlling the interspacing between dimers without resorting to breaking symmetry. Also, we found that such BICs are independent on the shape of nanodisk. This may relax the fabrication tolerance. The resonance wavelengths of BICs or QBICs are engineered by either changing the lattice constants of the metasurface or changing the radius of the nanodisk for the dimer system. Finally, we experimentally demonstrated such QBICs by fabricating a series of silicon-dimer metasurfaces and measuring their transmission spectra. The vanished linewidth of Fano resonance verifies the emergence of BICs, and QBICs are characterized by high-Q Fano resonances. The retrieved Q-factors are as high as 3142. Our results may find promising applications in designing high-performance photonic devices based on QBICs with high-Q factors, such as lasers, biosensors, filters, etc.In this work, we demonstrate that a dimer-based dielectric metasurface supports toroidal dipole (TD) dominated BICs.

        <p>To obtain a QBIC with a stable resonance wavelength, we first perform a design of moving the relative position of the meta-atom to disturb the translational-symmetry-protected BIC mode. The silicon dimer nanodisks are placed on the SiO 2 substrate with a rectangular lattice (L x = 2L y = 2L 0 ). The interspacing between two nanodisks is noted as L. BIC happens only at L = L 0 , the QBIC is induced when L deviates from L 0 due to the broken translational symmetry of the unit cell, which is L &gt; L 0 or L &lt; L 0 , as shown in Figure 1(a).To obtain a QBIC with a stable resonance wavelength, we first perform a design of moving the relative position of the meta-atom to disturb the translational-symmetry-protected BIC mode.

        <p>Two circular displacement current distributions in opposite directions confirm that the toroidal dipole (TD) dominates such a QBIC. Compared to the single nanodisk array, the dimer, without disturbance, makes a band folding because of the reduced first Brillouin zone, inducing the emergence of BIC at Γ-point due to flipping guided modes at the band edge below the light cone [52]. Figure 1(b) and (c) show the transverse magnetic (TM) band structure of the metasurface whose unit cell is 1 × 1 and 2 × 1, it is clear that many new modes appear at Γ-point due to band folding from band edge X to Γ point. Herein, we set L x = L y = L 0 = 500 nm for 1 × 1 unit cell and L x = 2L y = 2L 0 = 1000 nm for 2 × 1 super unit cell. The refractive index of Si and SiO 2 are n Si = 3.48 and n SiO2 = 1.46, respectively. This work mainly focuses on the mode of normalized eigenfrequency 𝜔a/2πc = 0.341, as shown by the red circle in Figure 1(b) and (c). The bandgap calculation is based on the open sources of Massachusetts Institute of Technology Photonic-Bands (MPB) [53]. We employ the commercial software 
            <rs type="software">COMSOL Multiphysics</rs> based on the finite element method to calculate the Q-factors of eigenmode. As illustrated in Figure 1(d), when the center distance L of the nanodisks deviates from L 0 , the BIC is converted to QBIC, and its Q ≈ 7.59𝛼 -2 , here the disturbance parameter 𝛼 = |ΔL|
        </p>
        <p>. Therefore, the smaller the 𝛼, the larger the Q-factor. The schematic diagram of the disturbance of the device is shown in the inset of Figure 1(d). It is noted that the resonance wavelength of QBIC is almost fixed around 1464 nm with the change of 𝛼. To confirm the existence of such a BIC, we calculate the transmission spectrum mapping of the metasurface versus offset distance (ΔL) and incident wavelength under y-polarized light, as shown in Figure 1(e). Indeed, it can be seen that the resonance peak in transmission spectra shows the vanished linewidth at ΔL = 0 nm as BIC mode is perfectly decoupled to the plane wave incidence. As |ΔL| gradually increases, the resonance peak of the QBIC widens gradually, which corresponds to the decrease of Q-factor, as shown in Figure 1(d). These results demonstrate the existence of energy band folding BICs, which are also called artificial BICs.. Therefore, the smaller the 𝛼, the larger the Q-factor.

        <p>Note that this BIC exhibits weak dependence on the shape of the nanodisk as long as the area of nanodisk in xoy plane is the same. For example, such a BIC mode always exists when the nanostructure is changed into a hexagonal cube, circular or square hollow nanodisks with nearly identical volume. ). Comparatively, the hexagonal cube metasurface has a larger coefficient of C = 8.09, which means that it holds a higher Q-factor for the same 𝛼 value. Notably, the resonance wavelengths of QBICs of the three structures are also very stable. The wavelength of the hexagonal cube is located at 1463.5 nm, which is close to the result of the nanodisks studied above. The resonance wavelengths of circular or square hollow nanodisks are 1503 nm and 1498 nm, respectively, and they are close to each other. It is noted that the resonance wavelength of the QBIC without substrate is still stable. In this study, we almost fix the device's volume, and the coupling difference between unit cells makes some difference in the resonance wavelengths of solid and hollow nanodisk metasurfaces. Therefore, such a BIC mode is robust against the device shape and exhibits large fabrication tolerances. In addition, the QBIC is excited by changing the relative position of the nanodisks, and their Q-factors only depend on the interspacing between nanodisks. In the fabrication process, the specific position parameters of the nanodisks are fixed, the samples are fabricated by electron-beam lithography (EBL) and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching techniques. The fabrication process only changes the uniformity and roughness of the nanodevice, the position of the nanodisks does not move. Therefore, the perturbation parameter of QBICs is accurately controlled in the experiment, which provides a way to achieve an ultrahigh Q-factor in metasurfaces. Next, multiple decomposition is performed to reveal the nature of such a QBIC (see Methods). Here, we study the resonant properties of QBIC with ΔL = 36 nm as an example. Figure 3(a)-(d) show the transmission spectra of the four structures, and the asymmetric resonance peaks with the Fano profile are observed, which originate from the coupling between discrete bound states supported by dielectric nanodisks and continuum background. Figure 3(e)-(h) show the scattered power of multipole components. It is clear that the TD response dominates these modes. A subsequent contribution is a magnetic quadrupole (MQ), because pair of counter-oriented magnetic dipoles induces TD and MQ. The contributions of electric dipole (ED), magnetic dipole (MD) and electric quadrupole (EQ) are negligible. The electric and magnetic field distributions are exhibited in Figure 3(i)-(p). They share a similar field intensity distribution, thus verifying the same QBIC mode. It is clear that two reversed electric field vector distributions are observed in the region of the nanodisks at the x-y plane [see Figure 3(i)-(l)], which excite two magnetic dipoles with opposite directions, combining with the incident light field, and thus presenting a circular magnetic dipole distribution in the x-z plane [see Figure 3(m)-(p)], and finally excite a TD along the y direction.Note that this BIC exhibits weak dependence on the shape of the nanodisk as long as the area of nanodisk in xoy plane is the same.

        <p>We demonstrated above that this TD QBIC mode possesses a stable resonance wavelength. This can be understood because the resonance wavelength only depends on the effective dielectric volume when the coupling between super unit cells is fixed. Thus, there are two ways to adjust the resonance wavelength, one is to change the diameter of nanodisk, and the other is to change the lattice constants of metasurfaces.We demonstrated above that this TD QBIC mode possesses a stable resonance wavelength.

        <p>Figure 4(a) shows the tuning way of changed lattice constants. Here L x is fixed, and L y is changed into L 1 , the calculated resonance wavelengths of QBICs are presented in Figure 4(b). As predicted, the wavelengths are still very stable, and they are adjusted from 1508 nm to 1454 nm when L y is changed from 360 nm to 570 nm. The corresponding radiation Q-factors are shown in Figure 4 Scattered Power (a.u.) L y has a higher Q-factor for the same perturbation parameter. Another strategy is to simultaneously change the dimer nanodisk's size simultaneously, as shown in Figure 4(d). One can find that a significant modulation of the resonance wavelength from 1485 nm to 1557 nm is observed when the nanodisk's radius is changed from 185 nm to 200 nm. It is noted that the effect of the disk's size on the Q-factor is smaller, especially for large values 𝛼. Therefore, we can design the structure parameters according to the target wavelength.Figure 4(a) shows the tuning way of changed lattice constants.

The Q-factor can be calculated by 𝜔 0 Γ , and the experimental Q-factors are listed in Figure 5(c). As expected, the Q-factor increases as |ΔL| decreases, and the maximum experimental Q-factor reaches 3142. We compare the simulated and experimental transmission spectrum mappings, as shown in Figure 5(d) and (e), and the results are in good agreement. At |ΔL| = 0, the vanished resonance peak is indeed observed, further confirming the existence of bandgap folding BIC. We extract the measured and simulated resonance wavelengths, which are in very good agreement, as illustrated in Figure 5(f), and measured resonance wavelengths are indeed very stable. The experimental Q-factor is lower than the theoretical value, which may be contributed by the roughness, nonuniformity of the nanodisks and some incidence angles, which lead to strong scattering of light into free space. Higher Q-factors may be achieved by optimizing fabrication processes and characterization systems. In Table 1, we list the Q-factors of toroidal dipole resonance.
