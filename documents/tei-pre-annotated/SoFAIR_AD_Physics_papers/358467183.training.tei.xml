        <p>Intermolecular bonds are weak compared to covalent bonds, but they are strong enough to influence the properties of large molecular systems. In this work, we investigate how strong light-matter coupling inside an optical cavity can modify these intermolecular forces. We perform a detailed comparison between currently available ab initio electron-photon methodologies. The electromagnetic field inside the cavity can modulate the ground state properties of weakly bound complexes. Controlling the field polarization, the interactions can be stabilized or destabilized, and electron densities, dipole moments, and polarizabilities can be altered. We demonstrate that electron-photon correlation is fundamental to describe intermolecular interactions in strong light-matter coupling. This work proposes optical cavities as a novel tool to manipulate and control ground state properties, solvent effects, and intermolecular interactions for molecules and materials.Intermolecular bonds are weak compared to covalent bonds, but they are strong enough to influence the properties of large molecular systems.

        <p>Intermolecular interactions play a fundamental role in chemistry and physics, and are especially important in describing the properties of large systems. In particular, they contribute to solvation processes, 1 interactions in liquids, 2 gas phase reactivity, 3 formation of higher order structures in biological macromolecules, 4 and multi-layer 2D materials. [5][6][7][8] The ability to induce even minor modifications in the intermolecular forces can have large impact on the macroscopic properties of molecular systems.

        <p>In this paper, we employ the QEDFT and QED-CC methods to study intermolecular forces under the influence of strong light-matter coupling. We focus on three selected systems representative of: van der Waals interaction, dipole-induced dipole interaction, and hydrogen bonding (see Figure 1). We also benchmark, where possible, against the exact QED full configuration interaction (QED-FCI) method. For the hydrogen bonded system, we also analyze changes in the electron density. Finally, we investigate the long-range intermolecular interaction through the cavity field. We note that all the observed effects are for the ground state of the light-matter system.In this paper, we employ the QEDFT and QED-CC methods to study intermolecular forces under the influence of strong light-matter coupling.

        <p>Covalent bonds between valence electrons typically have binding energies of about 1-10 eV. Intermolecular energies are substantially weaker (1-300 meV) and they arise from van der Waals interaction or electrostatics (dipole-dipole, etc.). 55 Even though their strength is orders of magnitudes weaker than covalent and ionic bonds, they are not negligible. Intermolecular forces can also be interpreted in terms of electron interactions mediated by the transverse electromagnetic field. 56 Because of this parallelism, changing the boundary conditions of the field with a cavity will alter the interactions. [57][58][59] In this paper, we treat a single cavity mode interacting explicitly with the molecular system, and assume that the electron mass inside the cavity is the same as outside. 56,60 For QED-HF, additional cavity modes would increase the cavity induced effects on the ground state compared to a single-mode approximation. To simulate potential multimode effects, we instead enlarge the coupling value to λ = 0.1. The description is certainly limited and going beyond this will require more sophisticated considerations from the photonic point of view. However, new insight into a non-perturbative description of cavity mediated weak interactions can be obtained using this approximation. Cavity losses, which only leads to quantitative and not qualitative changes of the results, are neglected in this paper. 61 In the following, cavity induced effects on the different kinds of intermolecular interactions are discussed.

The other orthogonal polarization (ε y ), being qualitatively similar to ε x , is shown in the Supplementary Information for completeness. From Figure 2, we see that coupled cluster is able to qualitatively reproduce the reference FCI values, but it slightly underestimates the binding energy. This is the case both outside and inside the cavity for all field polarization directions. This behavior is well known from coupled cluster theory, and it has been extensively discussed in Ref. 46.

        <p>The Hartree-Fock method, which does not include correlation, is not able to capture the vdW interaction and the potential energy curves are repulsive, both inside and outside the cavity (see the inset in Figure 2). This is in contrast to the correlated results. The exchange-only treatment of the OEP functional provides qualitatively similar predictions compared to Hartree-Fock. However, in QEDFT/OEP the effect of the cavity is minimal as the DSE, bilinear and photonic contributions to the energy largely compensate each other.The Hartree-Fock method, which does not include correlation, is not able to capture the vdW interaction and the potential energy curves are repulsive, both inside and outside the cavity (see the inset in Figure 2).

        <p>The cavity induced change in the potential energy curves are presented in Figure 3. When the cavity polarization is perpendicular to the intermolecular bond (ε x , ε y ), the binding energy increases. In contrast, when the field polarization is parallel (ε z ), the cavity destabilizes the bond. Interestingly, the energy difference behaves asymptotically as R -3 for large R (R 2 &gt; 0.98, black dashed lines). This is the same distance dependence as a dipole-dipole interaction instead of an expected R -6 behavior of the vdW dispersion. Outside the cavity, the correlation energy (blue solid line) respects the R -6 dependence. Note that the dipole moments of the isolated fragments are also zero inside the cavity. Figure 2 and 3 show cavity induced changes in the binding energies, but they do not give any insight into the absolute stability of the system. This is instead found from the relative energy differences (see Figure 4). The increase in energy due to the dipole self-energy is substantially higher when the polarization is along the H 2 bond (ε x ) compared to the orthogonal field polarizations (ε y , ε z ). This is because the electrons are more diffuse along the bond, allowing for larger dipole fluctuations [Eq. (15)]. The energy difference of about 40 meV in-duce a preferential orientation of the system along the ε y and ε z directions. From Figure 4, we can also observe that QED-CCSD-1 is missing about 5 meV more correlation when the field polarization is along ε x compared to the other directions. This result is confirmed by the correlation energies calculated at the minima presented in Table I. As mentioned in the discussion of Figure 2, the system is mainly polarizable along the H 2 bond (α xx ) as shown in Table II. The overall reduced α inside the cavity indicates that the electron density becomes more localized. The reduction is more evident along the direction of the field polarization (see columns of Table II). In this context, the variational minimization of the DSE reduces the dipole fluctuations and consequently the polarizability [see Eq. The same cavity induced reduction of the polarizability is observed for an isolated H 2 molecule, see Table III. This implies, using the London formula in Eq.( 13), a reduction of the vdW energy. However, as shown in Figure 2, the cavity can both increase and decrease the binding energy depending on the field polarization. This result clearly demonstrates that the London formula, as it is usually presented, does not hold for molecules in cavities. 57,65 Note that not only the polarizability is affected by the cavity, but also the ionization energy as recently shown in Ref. 66. In this section, the dipole-induced dipole interaction between a polar and a non-polar molecule is analyzed. The dipole induces a charge fluctuation in the other system (induced dipole) that can form an interaction that is usually on the order of 10-100 meV. These forces are generally stronger than the vdW dispersion. The angleaveraged Debye formula, describing this dipole-induced dipole interaction, is given by 55The cavity induced change in the potential energy curves are presented in Figure 3. When the cavity polarization is perpendicular to the intermolecular bond (ε x , ε y ), the binding energy increases. In contrast, when the field polarization is parallel (ε z ), the cavity destabilizes the bond. Interestingly, the energy difference behaves asymptotically as R -3 for large R (R 2 &gt; 0.98, black dashed lines). This is the same distance dependence as a dipole-dipole interaction instead of an expected R -6 behavior of the vdW dispersion. Outside the cavity, the correlation energy (blue solid line) respects the R -6 dependence. Note that the dipole moments of the isolated fragments are also zero inside the cavity. Figure 2 and 3 show cavity induced changes in the binding energies, but they do not give any insight into the absolute stability of the system. This is instead found from the relative energy differences (see Figure 4). The increase in energy due to the dipole self-energy is substantially higher when the polarization is along the H 2 bond (ε x ) compared to the orthogonal field polarizations (ε y , ε z ). This is because the electrons are more diffuse along the bond, allowing for larger dipole fluctuations [Eq. (15)]. The energy difference of about 40 meV in-duce a preferential orientation of the system along the ε y and ε z directions. From Figure 4, we can also observe that QED-CCSD-1 is missing about 5 meV more correlation when the field polarization is along ε x compared to the other directions. This result is confirmed by the correlation energies calculated at the minima presented in Table I. As mentioned in the discussion of Figure 2, the system is mainly polarizable along the H 2 bond (α xx ) as shown in Table II. The overall reduced α inside the cavity indicates that the electron density becomes more localized. The reduction is more evident along the direction of the field polarization (see columns of Table II). In this context, the variational minimization of the DSE reduces the dipole fluctuations and consequently the polarizability [see Eq. The same cavity induced reduction of the polarizability is observed for an isolated H 2 molecule, see Table III. This implies, using the London formula in Eq.( 13), a reduction of the vdW energy. However, as shown in Figure 2, the cavity can both increase and decrease the binding energy depending on the field polarization. This result clearly demonstrates that the London formula, as it is usually presented, does not hold for molecules in cavities. 57,65 Note that not only the polarizability is affected by the cavity, but also the ionization energy as recently shown in Ref. 66. In this section, the dipole-induced dipole interaction between a polar and a non-polar molecule is analyzed. The dipole induces a charge fluctuation in the other system (induced dipole) that can form an interaction that is usually on the order of 10-100 meV. These forces are generally stronger than the vdW dispersion. The angleaveraged Debye formula, describing this dipole-induced dipole interaction, is given by 55</p>

        <p>From the Debye formula in Eq. ( 16), we see that the strength of the induction interaction is related to the dipole of the polar fragment and the polarizability of the non-polar one. In Table IV the dipole moment of H 2 O and the polarizability of benzene, outside and inside the cavity, are provided. Inside the cavity we see a small decrease (0.003 D) of the permanent dipole, but a sizable reduction (7.60 a.u.) of the benzene polarizability. A possible reason for the large cavity effect on α could be connected to the aromaticity of benzene and its diffuse electrons. However, this will require further investigations. 69 Substituting the values in Table IV into Eq. ( 16), and comparing the size of the interaction outside and inside the cavity, we estimate a destabilization of 0.5 meV at R = 3.8 Å. This is much smaller than the corresponding destabilization observed in Figure 5 of about (26 meV). This indicates that, as in the case of vdW, the purely electrostatic interaction model is not sufficient to reproduce the effect.From the Debye formula in Eq.

The perturbative treatment predicts a cavity induced stabilization of about 0.2 meV, in contrast to the destabilization shown in Figure 6.

        <p>A net charge transfer of about 10 me -can be observed in the middle (dashed line) of the hydrogen bond. By placing the system inside the cavity, the number of transferred electrons is reduced by about 2 me -. This is in line with the weaker hydrogen bond observed in the potential energy curve and, following Ref. 71, it corresponds to a decrease of about 4-6 meV in the binding energy. In Figure 8, the CD analysis has been applied to the ground state cavity induced density difference (∆ρ = ρ GS cav -ρ GS nocav ) calculated using HF, CCSD, and DFT/OEP. In this case, all methodologies show a qualitatively similar behaviour and predict a reduction of charge transfer from donor to acceptor of about 2-3 me - (extracted at the same position as in Figure 7).

Four types of interactions have been studied: van der Waals forces, induction interactions, hydrogen bonding, and cavity mediated long-range interactions. In all cases, correlation is deemed crucial to describe the system. Several effects of the cavity seem rather counterintuitive at first glance. The van der Waals forces between two non-polar molecules behaves as R -6 . However, inside the cavity, an additional R -3 component originates from correlation. For the induction interaction and hydrogen bonding, the cavity induced effect is larger than for the van der Waals. In both cases, a destabilization of the binding energy and a reduction of polarizability is observed.
