        <p>The ALPIDE chip is a CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor being developed for the Upgrade of the ITS of the ALICE experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The ALPIDE chip is implemented with a 180 nm CMOS Imaging Process and fabricated on substrates with a high-resistivity epitaxial layer. It measures 15 mm Â 30 mm and contains a matrix of 512 Â 1024 pixels with in-pixel amplification, shaping, discrimination and multi-event buffering. The readout of the sensitive matrix is hit driven. There is no signaling activity over the matrix if there are no hits to read out and power consumption is proportional to the occupancy. The sensor meets the experimental requirements of detection efficiency above 99%, fake-hit probability below 10 À 5 and a spatial resolution of 5 μm. The capability to read out Pb-Pb interactions at 100 kHz is provided. The power density of the ALPIDE chip is projected to be less than 35 mW/cm 2 for the application in the Inner Barrel Layers and below 20 mW/cm 2 for the Outer Barrel Layers, where the occupancy is lower. This contribution describes the architecture and the main features of the final ALPIDE chip, planned for submission at the beginning of 2016. Early results from the experimental qualification of full scale prototype predecessors are also reported.The ALPIDE chip is a CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor being developed for the Upgrade of the ITS of the ALICE experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.

        <p>The ALPIDE chip is a CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS) that is being developed for a major upgrade of the Inner Tracking System (ITS) of the ALICE experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider [1]. The existing ALICE ITS will be replaced during the second Long Shutdown of the LHC (2019-2020) with a new detector entirely based on CMOS MAPS [2].

        <p>The ITS Upgrade pursues four major objectives: (a) the impact parameter resolution will be improved by a factor of three combining the reduction of the radial distance of the innermost layer from the interaction point (from 39 mm down to 22 mm), an improvement of single point resolution due to a smaller pixel size, and a reduction of the material budget of the innermost layers (from X 1.14% 0 to X 0.3% 0 ); (b) the finer granularity and the addition of one detection layer (7 layers in place of the current 6) will improve tracking efficiency and transverse momentum resolution in the low p t range; (c) the readout rate capability with Pb-Pb interactions shall reach 100 kHz, a factor of 100 improvement over the present readout capability; (d) it will be possible to remove and re-install the full detector for maintenance during the planned yearly shutdown.The ITS Upgrade pursues four major objectives: (a) the impact parameter resolution will be improved by a factor of three combining the reduction of the radial distance of the innermost layer from the interaction point (from 39 mm down to 22 mm), an improvement of single point resolution due to a smaller pixel size, and a reduction of the material budget of the innermost layers (from X 1.14% 0 to X 0.3% 0 ); (b) the finer granularity and the addition of one detection layer (7 layers in place of the current 6) will improve tracking efficiency and transverse momentum resolution in the low p t range; (c) the readout rate capability with Pb-Pb interactions shall reach 100 kHz, a factor of 100 improvement over the present readout capability; (d) it will be possible to remove and re-install the full detector for maintenance during the planned yearly shutdown.</p>
        <p>The new ITS detector will consist of seven cylindrical sensing layers with radial coverage from 22 mm to 400 mm and z-lengths ranging from 27 cm to 1.5 m. The three innermost layers will constitute the Inner Barrel, while the other four will make the Outer Barrel. The total sensitive area is above 10 m 2 and will be equipped with ∼24, 000 pixel sensor chips for more than 12.5 billion pixels in total.

        <p>The ALPIDE chip is implemented in a 180 nm CMOS Imaging Process provided by TowerJazz [3]. The circuits can be fabricated on substrates with a high-resistivity ( &gt; Ω ) 1 k cm epitaxial layer on p-type substrate. Typical values for the thickness of the epitaxial layer are in the range between 18 and 30 μm. A charged particle crossing the sensor liberates free charge carriers in the material by ionization. The electrons released in the epitaxial layer can diffuse laterally while they remain vertically confined by potential barriers at the interfaces with the overlying p-wells and the underlying p-type substrate. The signal sensing elements are n-well diodes (∼2 μm diameter). Their area is typically 100 times smaller than the pixel cell area.

        <p>Physics Research A induce a current signal at the input of the pixel front-end. The manufacturing process also provides a deep p-well layer that can be used to shield the epitaxial layer from the n-wells of the pmos transistors. These would otherwise compete with the sensing diodes in collecting the electrons, strongly impairing the charge collection. This feature permits the use of full CMOS circuits, including pmos transistors, in the active area. A reverse bias voltage can be applied to the substrate. This increases the depletion volume around the n-well collection diodes and reduces their capacitance. Both processes contribute to increase the S/N ratio.Physics Research A induce a current signal at the input of the pixel front-end.

        <p>Each pixel cell contains a sensing diode, a front-end amplifier and shaping stage, a discriminator and a digital section (Fig. 2).

On assertion of the strobe, an event frame is saved in one of the three frame storage slices.</p>
        <p>The readout of the frame data from the matrix is zero-suppressed and is executed by circuits named Priority Encoders. There are 512 instances of this circuit, one every two pixel columns. The Priority Encoder provides to the periphery the address of the first pixel with a hit in its double column. Subsequently the storage element of the pixel is reset. This cycle is repeated until the addresses of all pixels initially presenting a valid hit at the inputs of a Priority Encoder have been transferred to the periphery. Each Priority Encoder is a fully combinatorial circuit and it is steered by sequential logic in the periphery during the readout of a matrix frame. It is implemented in a very narrow region between the pixels, extending vertically over the full height of the columns. There is no free running clock distributed in the matrix and there is no signaling activity if there are no hits to read out. The average energy needed to encode the address of a hit pixel is of the order of 100 pJ. Power is consumed proportionally to the readout rate and to the hit occupancy. The readout of the matrix consumes around 3 mW for nominal design values. The Priority Encoders also implement the buffering and distribution of readout and configuration signals to the pixels. The 512 Double Columns and the corresponding Priority Encoders are functionally grouped in 32 submatrices (Fig. 3). There are 32 corresponding region readout modules in the chip periphery, each one executing the readout of a submatrix.

        <p>The region readout modules include de-randomizing memories and perform additional data reduction and formatting.

The Slave chips use a shared parallel local bus to send their data to the Master acting as data collector. The Master transmits the assembled data packets off-detector on its serial output, driving dedicated point-to-point links. In this scenario, a lower bit rate is used (400 Mb/s). Grouping of data of neighboring chips is feasible in the four Outer Barrel layers where the occupancy is lower. This scheme achieves a reduction in the total number of control and data links, and a reduction in the power consumption.The ITS Outer Barrel Module will contain 14 chips, arranged in two rows of seven.

        <p>The analog power consumption of the ALPIDE chip is typically 25 mW. The digital periphery and the readout of the matrix consume power in proportion to the frame readout rate and to the occupancy. For nominal design values, the consumption of the periphery of a chip on the innermost layer is expected to reach 54 mW. In the case of chips on the Outer Barrel layers, it is expected to reach a maximum of 44 mW. The output serial link is driven by a Data Transmission Unit including a PLL, Serializer and a Line Driver stage. The expected power consumption of this block alone reaches 68 mW. However, in the case of Slave chips it is disabled. Based on the previous estimates, the power consumption density is expected to be less than 35 mW/cm 2 for the ITS Inner Barrel Modules and below 18.5 mW/cm 2 for the Outer Barrel Modules.The analog power consumption of the ALPIDE chip is typically 25 mW.
