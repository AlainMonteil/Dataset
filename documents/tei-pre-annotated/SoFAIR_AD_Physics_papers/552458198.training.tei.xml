        <p>ALMA observations have revealed the presence of dust in the first generations of galaxies in the Universe. However, the dust temperature T d remains mostly unconstrained due to the few available FIR continuum data at redshift z &gt; 5. This introduces large uncertainties in several properties of high-z galaxies, namely their dust masses, infrared luminosities, and obscured fraction of star formation. Using a new method based on simultaneous [C II] 158µm line and underlying dust continuum measurements, we derive T d in the continuum and [C II] detected z ≈ 7 galaxies in the ALMA Large Project REBELS sample. We find 39 K &lt; T d &lt; 58 K, and dust masses in the narrow range M d = (0.9 -3.6) × 10 7 M . These results allow us to extend for the first time the reported T d (z) relation into the Epoch of Reionization. We produce a new physical model that explains the increasing T d (z) trend with the decrease of gas depletion time, t dep = M g /SFR, induced by the higher cosmological accretion rate at early times; this hypothesis yields T d ∝ (1 + z) 0.4 . The model also explains the observed T d scatter at a fixed redshift. We find that dust is warmer in obscured sources, as a larger obscuration results in more efficient dust heating.

        <p>The rest-frame Ultraviolet (UV) emission from galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) has been extensively studied thanks to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and groundbased telescopes (for UV luminosity functions see: Bradley et al. 2012;Oesch et al. 2013;McLure et al. 2013;Bowler et al. 2015;Atek et al. 2015;Bouwens et al. 2015;Livermore et al. 2017, for single detections see: Bouwens et al. 2010Bouwens et al. , 2011;;Ellis et al. 2012;Bradley et al. 2014;Oesch et al. 2016).The rest-frame Ultraviolet (UV) emission from galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) has been extensively studied thanks to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and groundbased telescopes (for UV luminosity functions see: Bradley et al. 2012;Oesch et al. 2013;McLure et al. 2013;Bowler et al. 2015;Atek et al. 2015;Bouwens et al. 2015;Livermore et al. 2017, for single detections see: Bouwens et al. 2010Bouwens et al. , 2011;;Ellis et al. 2012;Bradley et al. 2014;Oesch et al. 2016).</p>
        <p>Recently, also the Far-Infrared (FIR) emission from such early sources has become observable thanks to the advent of high sensitivity millimetre interferometers such as the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (for surveys see: Capak et al. 2015;Carilli et al. 2016;Bouwens et al. 2016;Barisic et al. 2017;Bowler et al. 2018;Bethermin et al. 2020;Schaerer et al. 2020, for comprehensive reviews see: Carilli &amp; Walter 2013; Dunlop 2016). The combination of data from these different instruments has allowed us to glimpse the interstellar medium (ISM) of early galaxies (see e.g. Dunlop et al. 2013;Stark 2016;Dayal &amp; Ferrara 2018;Hodge &amp; da Cunha 2020) for the first time.Recently, also the Far-Infrared (FIR) emission from such early sources has become observable thanks to the advent of high sensitivity millimetre interferometers such as the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (for surveys see: Capak et al. 2015;Carilli et al. 2016;Bouwens et al. 2016;Barisic et al. 2017;Bowler et al. 2018;Bethermin et al. 2020;Schaerer et al. 2020, for comprehensive reviews see: Carilli &amp; Walter 2013; Dunlop 2016).

        <p>The FIR emission from galaxies includes FIR lines, arising from atomic and molecular species in the ISM, and dust continuum emission. One of the brightest (and thus most commonly observed) FIR lines is the fine-structure transition of singly ionized carbon [C II] 158µm, which traces mainly the neutral atomic gas in the ISM (Stacey et al. 1991;Hollenbach &amp; Tielens 1999;Wolfire et al. 2003). The dust continuum is the thermal radiation emitted by dust grains heated by the UV and optical light coming from young stars (see e.g. Draine 1989;Meurer et al. 1999;Calzetti et al. 2000;Weingartner &amp; Draine 2001;Draine 2003).The FIR emission from galaxies includes FIR lines, arising from atomic and molecular species in the ISM, and dust continuum emission.

        <p>Dust grains span a wide range of physical temperatures deepening on their own physical properties and the radiation field heating them (see e.g. Draine 2003). Nevertheless, under the approximation of thermal equilibrium, the FIR spectral energy distribution (SED) can be well approximated by an isothermal grey-body function (Hildebrand 1983). Where available, observations at rest-frame Mid-Infrared (MIR) wavelengths, short-wards of the FIR emission peak, have shown significant deviations from a grey-body (Dunne &amp; Eales 2001;Blain et al. 2003;Kovács et al. 2010;Casey 2012;Dale et al. 2012;Galametz et al. 2012;Kirkpatrick et al. 2012;da Cunha et al. 2008;da Cunha et al. 2015;Casey et al. 2018;Reuter et al. 2020). Unfortunately, MIR wavelengths are inaccessible at z &gt; 5 with current instruments. Given the limited availability of observations sampling the full dust emission regime, the most common and physically-sound approach is to assume isothermal dust emitting as a grey-body. The key dust properties constrained through SED fitting are the dust temperature T d and mass M d 1 , which are degenerate quantities.Dust grains span a wide range of physical temperatures deepening on their own physical properties and the radiation field heating them (see e.g. Draine 2003).

        <p>the redshift range 0 ≤ z ≤ 6 have suggested the presence of a direct correlation between T d and redshift (see e.g. Magdis et al. 2012a;Magnelli et al. 2013;Béthermin et al. 2015;Schreiber et al. 2018;Faisst et al. 2020;Bouwens et al. 2020;Reuter et al. 2020). Combining the few available dust temperature estimates for individual galaxies at z &gt; 5 with lower-z stacking results, different works came to discrepant conclusions. While Bouwens et al. (2020) have confirmed the reported linear T d (z) increase, Faisst et al. (2020) suggested instead a flattening of the relation at higher redshift. A physical and quantitative interpretation of either trend is still lacking. Previous works suggested that warm dust temperatures at high-z might result from a more compact dust geometry in high-z galaxies (w.r.t. local galaxies), with dust being mostly located in the vicinity of young stars, and thus being more efficiently heated (Liang et al. 2019;Sommovigo et al. 2020).the redshift range 0 ≤ z ≤ 6 have suggested the presence of a direct correlation between T d and redshift (see e.g. Magdis et al. 2012a;Magnelli et al. 2013;Béthermin et al. 2015;Schreiber et al. 2018;Faisst et al. 2020;Bouwens et al. 2020;Reuter et al. 2020).

        <p>Other works have suggested that the increasing T d (z) trend can be qualitatively ascribed to the growing specific star formation rate at high-z (Magnelli et al. 2014;Ma et al. 2016Ma et al. , 2019;;Shen et al. 2021), together with the lower dust content of early galaxies (see e.g. Aoyama et al. 2017;Behrens et al. 2018;Shen et al. 2021;Pallottini et al. 2022). A lower dust content would in fact result in warmer dust temperatures for a given FIR luminosity L FIR . Firmer conclusions on the T d evolution at early times have been hindered by two factors. First, the number of galaxies at z &gt; 5 for which multiple FIR continuum observations are available is very limited (Hashimoto et al. 2019;Behrens et al. 2018;Harikane et al. 2020;Bakx et al. 2020;Faisst et al. 2020). In fact, most ALMA sources, when detected in dust continuum, have only a single (or very few) data point(s) at FIR wavelengths (e.g. Knudsen et al. 2016a;Bouwens et al. 2016;Pavesi et al. 2016a;Barisic et al. 2017;Bowler et al. 2018;Pavesi et al. 2019;Hashimoto et al. 2019;Tamura et al. 2019;Bethermin et al. 2020). Hence a value for T d is often assumed a priori in the fitting procedure (or associated to very large experimental uncertainties). The second limiting factor is the very large scatter of measured T d values, ranging from T d 25 K (Harikane et al. 2020) up to T d &gt; 80 K in the narrow redshift range z = 6.2 -8.3 (Bakx et al. 2020).Other works have suggested that the increasing T d (z) trend can be qualitatively ascribed to the growing specific star formation rate at high-z (Magnelli et al. 2014;Ma et al. 2016Ma et al. , 2019;;Shen et al. 2021), together with the lower dust content of early galaxies (see e.g. Aoyama et al. 2017;Behrens et al. 2018;Shen et al. 2021;Pallottini et al. 2022).

        <p>The lack of (or poor) knowledge of T d at high-z results in very large uncertainties on M d as well as derived galaxy properties, such as infrared luminosity (L IR ) and obscured star formation rate (SFR; see e.g. Sommovigo et al. 2020). In the future, the problem can be mitigated thanks to further ALMA observations in multiple higher-frequency bands (Bands 7,8,9). In fact, for galaxies at z &gt; ∼ 5 such observations sample the SED closer to the emission peak in the FIR (see Bakx et al. 2021).The lack of (or poor) knowledge of T d at high-z results in very large uncertainties on M d as well as derived galaxy properties, such as infrared luminosity (L IR ) and obscured star formation rate (SFR; see e.g. Sommovigo et al. 2020).

Note that the correction on the given M values, required to be consistent with a Salpeter 1 -100 M IMF (used in the rest of the paper), is well within their uncertainties and does not affect significantly our results. We caution that using a non-parametric prescription for the SFH might result in M values up to a factor ∼ ×3 larger (for a detailed discussion on this point see Topping &amp; al., in prep. 2022).

Considering such uncertainties, the range widens to 30 K -73 K (where the lower limit is set by the condition on the dust masses and the upper one by that on the obscured SFRs, see Section 2). Note that these large uncertainties on T d are often comparable with the ones derived in the literature from traditional SED fitting using 2 -3 data points at FIR wavelengths (see Table B1 where we compare T d values obtained from our method vs. SED fitting for several z &gt; 5 galaxies). Further ALMA observations in bands 8 -9 will help us significantly in constraining T d at high-z by sampling the SEDs closer to the FIR emission peak (see central panel of Fig. 1).We find the median T d of REBELS galaxies to vary in the range between 39 K and 58 K with REBELS-39 (REBELS-18,32) being the galaxy with the warmest (coldest) dust.

For all (but two of) the REBELS sources we find y d &lt; ∼ 1 M (see Table 1 for the value of y d in each galaxy), which is quite consistent with the latest constraints on SNe dust production by Leśniewska &amp; Micha lowski (2019). They find that up to y d = 1.1 M of dust per SN can be produced, where the exact value depends on the amount of dust which is destroyed/ejected during the SN explosion (1.1 M corresponds to the case of no dust destruction/ejection).We also compute the dust yield per SN, y d , required to produce REBELS galaxies dust masses.

        <p>In the previous equation, τ eff is the galaxy effective dust attenuation optical depth at 1500 Å, which directly relates to the transmissivity, τ eff =ln T . The transmissivity is defined as the ratio of the observed-to-intrinsic UV luminosity, i.e. T = 1 (T = 0) for a fully transparent (obscured) galaxy. Note that, depending on the relative dust and star distributions, τ eff might significantly differ from the physical UV optical depth, τ 1500 . Hence, a large transmissivity does not directly imply a low physical optical depth.

        <p>Interpreting eq. 18 is straightforward. First, for optically thin galaxies (for which UV transmissivity T 37%) T d depends solely on N H , with larger column densities producing warmer dust. Quantitatively, for a z = 0 source with N H,21 = 1, corresponding to a ratio τ eff /Z = 0.96, we predict T d = 26.5 K. Second, dust in obscured sources (for which T 37%) is warmer; this is not surprising, as a larger obscuration results in more efficient dust heating. Third, among obscured sources, T d is higher in metal-poor systems. This is because 14 While t dep is fundamentally unknown at high-z, the molecular gas depletion time, t dep,H 2 = M H 2 /SFR, has been studied up to z &lt; ∼ 5 via CO and dust observations (see e.g. Tacconi et al. 2018;Walter et al. 2020;Tacconi et al. 2020). For instance, Tacconi et al. (2020) suggest a mild evolution of t dep,H 2 time with redshift for mainsequence galaxies, t dep,H 2 ∝ (1 + z) -0.98±0.1 . Assuming such t dep,H 2 (z) evolution (instead of the one given in eq. 16), does not qualitatively affect our results. In fact, T d would still increase with redshift due to the shorter depletion times. However, the different evolution slightly modifies the predicted (N H,21 , Z) values shown in the Figure. 15 As in general, τ eff &lt; τ 1500 , N H should be intended as a lower limit to the actual mean column density in the galaxy.Interpreting eq. 18 is straightforward.

        <p>These large uncertainties result from the lack of information on the metallicity Z and burstiness parameter κ s of REBELS galaxies (see the discussion in Section 3). Future observations will help us to constrain both these quantities, thus reducing the uncertainties in the predicted T d , M d . In fact, with ALMA we can investigate the [O III]/[C II] luminosities ratios of REBELS sources, which can be used to reliably constrain their κ s using the model in Vallini et al. 2021 (these ALMA observations would also provide us with an additional data point in the FIR continuum underlying [O III]). Moreover, future JWST optical nebular lines observations will allow us to improve metallicity estimates out to very high-z, possibly reaching a precision as low as ∆Z/Z ∼ 35% at z ∼ 7 (Wright et al. 2010;Chevallard et al. 2019;Maiolino &amp; Mannucci 2019).These large uncertainties result from the lack of information on the metallicity Z and burstiness parameter κ s of REBELS galaxies (see the discussion in Section 3).

        <p>For the remaining sources detected in both [O III]88µm and [C II]158 µm (all but HZ4-10), Vallini et al. (2021) derived the value of (κ s , Z), albeit with large uncertainties (on average: 1 in the paper). For each individual source we assume a random distribution for (κ s , Z) around the mean value, with the dispersion corresponding to the uncertainty. For all of these sources the ratio y = r CII /r star is also measured: y = 1.8 ± 0.4 (J1211-0118 and J0217-0208, Harikane et al. 2020), y = 8 ± 2 (A2744-YD4, Laporte et al. 2019). Finally, for HZ4-10, due to the lack of observational constraints on (Z, κ s , y), we rely on the same assumptions used for both the ALPINE individual galaxies and the REBELS galaxies, which are extensively described and motivated in Section 3.For the remaining sources detected in both [O III]88µm and [C II]158 µm (all but HZ4-10), Vallini et al.

        <p>We note that for this galaxy, assuming the dust model adopted here, from traditional SED fitting (relying only on the two detections at 120µm, 158µm) one would deduce a very large dust mass log(M d /M ) = 9.28 ± 0.17. Given the stellar mass estimated for this galaxy (M ∼ 3 × 10 10 M from Harikane et al. 2020), such dust muss would imply a very large dust yield of y d = 3 +2 -1 M per SN, which is not compatible with SNe dust production constraints (Bocchio et al. 2016;Matsuura et al. 2019;Leśniewska &amp; Micha lowski 2019;Slavin et al. 2020). Further ALMA observations at shorter wavelengths will help us understand weather the dust temperature of this galaxy has been underestimated (and thus the dust mass overestimated), which would reduce the tension with the T d value derived with our method. An other possibility is that the stellar mass of this source has been underestimated, this would relax the requirements set by the condition on M d &lt; M d,max ∝ M star (see Section 2), allowing for larger dust masses and lower temperatures in our derivation. If neither of these possibilities is verified, alternative dust production scenarios might have to be invoked for this source (see the discussion in Section 3.2).We note that for this galaxy, assuming the dust model adopted here, from traditional SED fitting (relying only on the two detections at 120µm, 158µm) one would deduce a very large dust mass log(M d /M ) = 9.28 ± 0.17.
