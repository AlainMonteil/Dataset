        <p>After decades of observations of solar energetic particles (SEP) from space-based observatories, relevant questions on particle injection, transport, and acceleration remain open. To address these scientific topics, accurate measurements of the particle properties in the inner heliosphere are needed. In this paper we describe the Energetic Particle Detector (EPD), an instrument suite that is part of the scientific payload aboard the Solar Orbiter mission. Solar Orbiter will approach the Sun as close as 0.28 au and will provide extra-ecliptic measurements beyond ∼ 30 • heliographic latitude during the later stages of the mission. The EPD will measure electrons, protons, and heavy ions with high temporal resolution over a wide energy range, from suprathermal energies up to several hundreds of megaelectronvolts/nucleons. For this purpose, EPD is composed of four units: the SupraThermal Electrons and Protons (STEP), the Electron Proton Telescope (EPT), the Suprathermal Ion Spectrograph (SIS), and the High-Energy Telescope (HET) plus the Instrument Control Unit (ICU) that serves as power and data interface with the spacecraft. The low-energy population of electrons and ions will be covered by STEP and EPT, while the high-energy range will be measured by HET. Elemental and isotopic ion composition measurements will be performed by SIS and HET, allowing full particle identification from a few kiloelectronvolts up to several hundreds of megaelectronvolts/nucleons. Angular information will be provided by the separate look directions from different sensor heads, on the ecliptic plane along the Parker spiral magnetic field both forward and backwards, and out of the ecliptic plane observing both northern and southern hemispheres. The unparalleled observations of EPD will provide key insights into long-open and crucial questions about the processes that govern energetic particles in the inner heliosphere.After decades of observations of solar energetic particles (SEP) from space-based observatories, relevant questions on particle injection, transport, and acceleration remain open.

        <p>The mission scientific objectives require a high level of coordination among the instruments in order to maximise the scientific return. For this purpose, a set of coordinated activities has been devised and compiled into the so-called Science Activity Plan (SAP, Zouganelis et al. 2019). In-situ measurements are coordinated by the in-situ working group (Horbury et al. 2019). Similarly, a remote-sensing working group (Auchere et al. 2019) has been established to coordinate remote-sensing observations. Coordination with other assets such as the Parker Solar Probe (Fox et al. 2016) has been addressed by Velli et al. (2019). Finally a Modelling And Data Analysis Working Group (MADAWG) has been established (Rouillard et al. 2019) to assist the mission planning and scientific exploitation with dedicated tools.The mission scientific objectives require a high level of coordination among the instruments in order to maximise the scientific return.

        <p>The EPD measurements will be central in addressing the mission top-level question pertaining to energetic particles. It will also provide supporting measurements to address the other mission scientific questions. Furthermore, unveiling the origins of solar energetic particles (SEP) will require complementary high-cadence remote-sensing observations of the solar sources at multiple wavelengths (from X-ray to visible light), their radio signatures, and a continuous monitoring of the plasma and magnetic field environment around the spacecraft.The EPD measurements will be central in addressing the mission top-level question pertaining to energetic particles.

        <p>Energetic particles are a fundamental ingredient of the dynamical Sun. A major part of the energy released during eruptive events in the solar atmosphere is transferred to particles (Emslie et al. 2012), and then carried into the heliosphere. Non-thermal particle populations are also a possible basic ingredient of the hot corona; understanding them gives insight into the elusive heating process.Energetic particles are a fundamental ingredient of the dynamical Sun.

        <p>The heliosphere constitutes a unique laboratory to probe energetic particles in an astrophysical setting because in-situ measurements of the particles can be conducted. An additional information can be obtained from the coronal plasma environment (from where the particles originate and propagate) and its dynamics, which can be imaged and probed by spectroscopy. Finally, shock waves, which are one of the prime particle accelerators, can also be measured in-situ, together with the associated wave and particle populations. All this can be done with a time resolution that reveals properties of the processes of acceleration and transport.The heliosphere constitutes a unique laboratory to probe energetic particles in an astrophysical setting because in-situ measurements of the particles can be conducted.

        <p>The Sun is the most powerful source of energetic particles in the Solar System. Transient processes on the solar surface and in the solar atmosphere are capable of energising electrons (up to tens of MeV) and ions (up to a few GeV) that can escape to the interplanetary space along open magnetic field lines (see e.g. Klein &amp; Dalla 2017). These particles, ranging from suprathermal (∼few keV) to relativistic energies, can be observed in-situ as SEP events by radiation detectors in space. Solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the main sources of SEPs. Solar energetic particle events are also of great relevance for space weather because they can cause large radiation increases in interplanetary space and over the polar regions of the Earth, potentially harmful for human crews in space and for space-based technology (e.g. Chenette et al. 1994;Mewaldt 2006;Vainio et al. 2009;Jiggens et al. 2014;McKenna-Lawlor et al. 2015). Solar energetic particle events are often classified into two categories, impulsive and gradual (Cane et al. 1986;Reames 1999), which show different observational characteristics related to different acceleration sites. At moderate energies, gradual events show abundance ratios and charge states similar to the ambient corona and the interplanetary medium (Klecker et al. 2007;Desai &amp; Giacalone 2016, and references therein). They are proton rich and show larger fluences and longer durations (up to several days); they also tend to be associated with fast and large CMEs driving shock waves in the corona and the interplanetary medium, often accompanied by observational signatures such as type II radio bursts. Impulsive events have typically much shorter durations (hours) and lower fluences. They are electron-rich and show higher charge states (Klecker et al. 1984) and dramatic enhancements of the 3 He/ 4 He ratio with respect to the coronal values, as well as enrichments in Fe and other heavy elements (Reames et al. 1994;Mason 2007;Reames 2018). Impulsive events appear in association with type III radio bursts and often with solar flares, narrow CMEs, and extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) jets (Kahler et al. 2001;Nitta et al. 2006;Bučík et al. 2018). Recent observations suggest that EUV coronal waves may also affect the injection of 3 He-rich SEPs into interplanetary space during some 3 He-rich events (Bučík et al. 2015(Bučík et al. , 2016)).The Sun is the most powerful source of energetic particles in the Solar System.

        <p>Regarding the acceleration mechanisms, impulsive events involve acceleration of hot flaring plasma, via electric fields or stochastic acceleration, over short timescales at spatially compact sources (the reconnection site at solar flares). They may also include resonant acceleration processes responsible for the selective enhancements of certain species (Reames 2013, and references therein). Gradual events involve long-lasting acceleration of the ambient plasma at spatially extended CME-driven shocks propagating through the corona and the interplanetary medium (Lee et al. 2012, and references therein). Nevertheless, making a clear distinction between acceleration mechanisms in impulsive and gradual SEP events may be difficult because different processes may play a role in accelerating particles during the development of an event (e.g. Klein &amp; Dalla 2017, and references therein). Some SEP events may exhibit mixed or hybrid (Kallenrode et al. 1992) composition, that is, with contribution of particles accelerated both at flares and at CME-driven shocks. The different scenarios proposed to explain the presence of flareaccelerated particles in large SEP events are detailed in the re-Article number, page 2 of 35 cent papers by Desai &amp; Giacalone (2016) and Kartavykh et al. (2016).Regarding the acceleration mechanisms, impulsive events involve acceleration of hot flaring plasma, via electric fields or stochastic acceleration, over short timescales at spatially compact sources (the reconnection site at solar flares).

        <p>While it appears plausible that some aspects of the spatial SEP distribution observed in the interplanetary medium are greatly influenced by the size of the acceleration site (e.g. Lario et al. 2014;Gómez-Herrero et al. 2015), the existence of SEP events that fill all solar longitudes, and the faster spread of electrons over protons, which is inconsistent with the expansion of a single acceleration region (Kallenrode 1993a;Richardson et al. 2014), pose challenges to this view. In particular, a single expansion of an acceleration region cannot explain the inferred differences in azimuthal spread between electrons and protons (See, e.g. Figs. 15 and 16 in Richardson et al. 2014). During impulsive SEP events, energetic particles were thought to fill only relatively narrow angular ranges, corresponding to the region well-connected to a spatially compact source. However, recent STEREO observations (Wiedenbeck et al. 2013) show that sometimes 3 He-rich events can also show relatively wide particle spreads. For further details on the candidate physical processes that may be responsible for the spatial spread of SEPs in the interplanetary medium, see for example Dresing et al. (2012), Dresing et al. (2014), Gómez-Herrero et al. (2015), Lario et al. (2016), Strauss et al. (2017) and references therein.While it appears plausible that some aspects of the spatial SEP distribution observed in the interplanetary medium are greatly influenced by the size of the acceleration site (e.g. Lario et al. 2014;Gómez-Herrero et al. 2015), the existence of SEP events that fill all solar longitudes, and the faster spread of electrons over protons, which is inconsistent with the expansion of a single acceleration region (Kallenrode 1993a;Richardson et al. 2014), pose challenges to this view.

        <p>The material actually energised by CME-driven shocks is called the seed population. The charge states observed during gradual events seem to be consistent with the temperature of the ambient corona and the solar wind, rather than hot plasma from flaring active regions, at least for energies below several tens of megaelectronvolts. However, the composition often shows peculiarities such as moderate enhancements of rare species such as 3 He and He + , suggesting a seed population drawn from the suprathermal ion pool (ions 2 keV), which is always present (Fisk &amp; Gloeckler 2008) but is characterised by stronger variability in both intensity and composition than the ambient solar wind. The origin of these suprathermal ions is not fully understood and could include remnants from previous SEP events and stream interaction regions (SIRs) or an almost continuous solar or interplanetary source. Furthermore, pickup He + ions of interstellar origin, with their velocity distribution function (VDF) being very different from the solar wind, provide an additional suprathermal source, making them ideal to probe injection and acceleration processes that depend on mass per charge and on the VDF (e.g. Kucharek et al. 2003, and references therein).The material actually energised by CME-driven shocks is called the seed population.

        <p>The combination of SWA and EPD measurements (particularly the STEP and SIS sensors) will provide the composition and energy spectrum (or VDF) ranging from solar wind to suprathermal energies at different heliocentric distances. These data constitute an essential input for models of SEP acceleration at coronal and interplanetary shock waves (e.g. Tylka &amp; Lee 2006;Neergaard Parker &amp; Zank 2012;Vainio et al. 2014;Afanasiev et al. 2015), and are also fundamental to understanding the origin of the suprathermal pool itself. Measurements close to the Sun will be particularly important because the SEP composition will be much less disturbed by interplanetary transport processes, enabling a more direct study of questions such as the influence of the shock obliquity on the injection and acceleration processes (Tylka et al. 2005;Battarbee et al. 2013) or the amount of direct flare contributions during large gradual events (Cane et al. 2010;Tylka et al. 2013).The combination of SWA and EPD measurements (particularly the STEP and SIS sensors) will provide the composition and energy spectrum (or VDF) ranging from solar wind to suprathermal energies at different heliocentric distances.

        <p>Impulsive SEP events are associated with solar type III radio bursts. Many clearly come from flares/microflares accompanied by narrow CMEs or EUV jets (Kahler et al. 2001;Nitta et al. 2006;Bučík et al. 2018), but often not even a microflare or soft X-ray burst is observed. The acceleration is thought to be a consequence of magnetic reconnection processes in the low corona. The physical mechanisms may involve direct electric fields, stochastic acceleration, and resonant wave-particle interactions. Resonant acceleration processes could explain the preferential acceleration of some species, which produce the composition anomalies observed in-situ. Solar Orbiter will provide the opportunity to study impulsive SEP events close to the Sun. The SIS and HET will obtain accurate measurements of the isotopic and elemental composition, while STEP, EPT, and HET will detect the associated energetic electrons released from the reconnection site, enabling an accurate determination of the solar release time. These EPD in-situ observations will be combined with radio (Pick &amp; Vilmer 2008;Kontar et al. 2017), X-ray, and especially EUV observations with high cadence and spatial resolution, enabling an unambiguous identification of the associated solar activity phenomena and the location of the acceleration site. In particular, the combination of EPD and STIX will allow for a comparison between the electron spectrum at the acceleration region inferred from X-ray measurements and the electron spectrum observed in-situ (Krucker et al. 2007).Impulsive SEP events are associated with solar type III radio bursts.

        <p>Particle acceleration at CME-driven shocks is widely seen as the main process in gradual SEP events (e.g. Reames 1999). The main particle shock acceleration processes are shock-drift acceleration, shock surfing acceleration and diffusive shock acceleration (e.g. Vainio &amp; Afanasiev 2018). The latter, a firstorder Fermi acceleration mechanism, is commonly used to describe SEP shock-acceleration (e.g. Lee et al. 2012). This acceleration process is influenced by the shock properties, by the seed population available for acceleration, and the ambient turbulence around the shock (e.g. Rodríguez-Pacheco et al. 1998;Lee et al. 2012). Self-generated waves produced by the accelerated SEP population also play a fundamental role in the development of the turbulence that is key to reaching the observed particle energies (Vainio &amp; Laitinen 2007). According to some studies, the presence of previous CMEs may also play an important role in SEP acceleration during gradual events (Kahler 2001;Gopalswamy et al. 2002).Particle acceleration at CME-driven shocks is widely seen as the main process in gradual SEP events (e.g. Reames 1999).

This acceleration process is influenced by the shock properties, by the seed population available for acceleration, and the ambient turbulence around the shock (e.g. Rodríguez-Pacheco et al. 1998;Lee et al. 2012). Self-generated waves produced by the accelerated SEP population also play a fundamental role in the development of the turbulence that is key to reaching the observed particle energies (Vainio &amp; Laitinen 2007). According to some studies, the presence of previous CMEs may also play an important role in SEP acceleration during gradual events (Kahler 2001;Gopalswamy et al. 2002).</p>
        <p>In gradual events, the shock-acceleration processes start when the shock is formed in the corona and continue as it propagates through the outer coronal layers and the interplanetary Article number, page 3 of 35 medium. In general, the stronger acceleration occurs when the shock is still close to the Sun. The shape of the SEP time profile is greatly influenced by the location of the observer with respect to the central part of the shock (e.g. Cane et al. 1988;Heras et al. 1995;Lario et al. 1998;Aran 2007). When the interplanetary shock approaches the location of the observer, particle fluxes of low to moderate energies often show an increase and peak locally at the passage time of the shock, forming a so-called energetic storm particle (ESP) event (Bryant et al. 1962). The EPD will observe gradual events and will sample the associated ESP events close to the Sun before the shock has been weakened by the interplanetary propagation. The EPD observations will be combined with those from MAG, RPW, and SWA to determine local shock and turbulence properties, often with the highest time cadence available (burst mode, see Sect. 3).In gradual events, the shock-acceleration processes start when the shock is formed in the corona and continue as it propagates through the outer coronal layers and the interplanetary Article number, page 3 of 35 medium.

        <p>The observational distinction of gradual and impulsive events becomes less and less clear when high energies (100s to 1000s of MeV) are considered. Statistical evidence (e.g. Dierckxsens et al. 2015;Trottet et al. 2015) and timing studies of ground level enhancements (GLEs; e.g. Klein &amp; Dalla 2017, and references therein) suggest that acceleration processes related to the flare or to the restructuring of the magnetically stressed corona in the wake of a CME could be a plausible alternative to shock acceleration. The timing of the observed SEP signatures will carry detailed structure that is blurred at 1 au (see Section 2.3), and will allow for a much more detailed comparison with particle acceleration signatures from the corona observed in HXR and radio.The observational distinction of gradual and impulsive events becomes less and less clear when high energies (100s to 1000s of MeV) are considered.

        <p>Besides the previously mentioned sources of accelerated particles, recent observations of energetic particle enhancements in turbulent wakes of interplanetary shocks, near reconnecting current sheets, and within magnetic cavities filled with magnetic islands strongly support theoretical expectations of particle energisation to kilo-or even megaelectronvolt energies, in the presence of coherent structures in the solar wind (Zank et al. 2014(Zank et al. , 2015;;le Roux et al. 2015le Roux et al. , 2016)). Many examples of such atypical energetic particle enhancements (AEPEs) in the heliosphere at radial distances ≥ 1 au have been reported (Khabarova et al. 2018, and references therein). The EPD observations combined with MAG and SWA will shed further light on the effects of these local particle acceleration processes inside of 1 au in the inner heliosphere.Besides the previously mentioned sources of accelerated particles, recent observations of energetic particle enhancements in turbulent wakes of interplanetary shocks, near reconnecting current sheets, and within magnetic cavities filled with magnetic islands strongly support theoretical expectations of particle energisation to kilo-or even megaelectronvolt energies, in the presence of coherent structures in the solar wind (Zank et al. 2014(Zank et al. , 2015;;le Roux et al. 2015le Roux et al. , 2016)).

        <p>Solar energetic particle events are routinely observed in situ by several spacecraft located near 1 au. These measurements can only reveal limited information about the source of particles when these are located in the solar corona or travelling into the interplanetary medium but far from 1 au. The reason for the difficulty in inferring the characteristics of the distant particle sources is linked to the effects of the transport of particles from their source to the position of the observer. On one hand, complications arise because observations are made several particle scattering lengths from the source, and therefore its characteristics are blurred by transport processes. Helios observations already illustrated this by showing multiple SEP events at 0.31 au that appeared as a single event at 1 au (Wibberenz &amp; Cane 2006;Agueda &amp; Lario 2016). On the other hand, the effect of adiabatic deceleration may result in particles 200 keV/n being unobserved at 1 au (Mason et al. 2012). By travelling as close to the Sun as 60 R with an advanced in-situ and remote sensing payload, Solar Orbiter will revolutionise our understanding of SEPs. The energy resolution of the STEP, EPT, and SIS detectors will permit the detailed analysis of the seed particle population in acceleration processes, since the effect of adiabatic deceleration at such short heliocentric distances is reduced (e.g. Ruffolo 1995; Kocharov et al. 1998;Wijsen, N. et al. 2019). Also, transport effects might be diminished at close perihelion distances, where Solar Orbiter will be within a few to ∼1 scattering mean free paths (see, e.g. Kallenrode 1993b;Wibberenz &amp; Cane 2006;Pacheco et al. 2019). This permits more accurate source identification and timing studies, and will ultimately allow us to distinguish between various particle acceleration mechanisms that are otherwise impossible to discern. The data that EPD will provide (with a temporal resolution up to 1 s when set in burst mode), along with the local shock and turbulence parameters that can be derived from the data provided by MAG, SWA, and RPW, will allow for theory and models of the acceleration processes to be greatly improved.Solar energetic particle events are routinely observed in situ by several spacecraft located near 1 au.

        <p>When energetic particles are released from their acceleration sites, namely flares or CME-driven shocks, they propagate predominantly along the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), which at large spatial scales is often assumed to be ordered as a Parker spiral, with turbulent fluctuations at smaller spatial scales. Understanding how energetic particles propagate in the solar wind from their sources to the point of observation is not only essential to better understanding the acceleration processes at or near the Sun, but is also an important problem in its own right. We note, for instance, that even in the case of impulsive events observed by spacecraft separated by short longitudinal distances, transport conditions can vary significantly, yielding different insitu particle intensity-time profiles (Pacheco et al. 2017). As detailed in the following sections, EPD instruments will provide numerous energy channels for a large variety of particle species, as well as directional information of particle intensities given by the four fields of view of the EPT and HET telescopes. Alone and in combination with measurements from other spacecraft, EPD observations will not only help better constrain current particle transport models that describe SEP events (e.g. Kozarev et al. 2013;Schwadron et al. 2014;Rodríguez-Gasén et al. 2014;Pomoell et al. 2015;Luhmann et al. 2017;Hu et al. 2017;Afanasiev et al. 2018), but in addition, the out of ecliptic orbits of Solar Orbiter will provide a unique observational vantage point to assess the importance of propagation across the magnetic field in SEP transport. Among possible mechanisms that may play a role in perpendicular transport are turbulence-associated cross field motion (e.g. Zhang et al. 2009;Schwadron et al. 2010;Dröge et al. 2010;Kartavykh et al. 2016;Laitinen et al. 2016;Wijsen, N. et al. 2019), charged particle drifts (Dalla et al. 2017), and the influence of the heliospheric current sheet (e.g. Agueda et al. 2013;Battarbee et al. 2018). Magnetic field line meandering due to turbulence gives SEPs fast access to a wide range of longitudes near the Sun (Laitinen et al. 2016). Charged particle drifts are charge-to-mass-ratio dependent and would result in Fe/O time dependence and other compositional characteristics being different near the Sun compared to 1 au (e.g. Dalla et al. 2017).

        <p>In combination with vector magnetic field and plasma measurements, energetic particles can be used as probes to study the large-scale structure of the coronal magnetic fields and the 3D structure of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in the near-Sun environment. Propagation of charged particles parallel to the IMF is affected by a number of processes, particularly the adiabatic motion along the smooth large-scale field and the pitch angle scattering off the small-scale irregularities (see, e.g. Aran et al. 2018). One crucial parameter is the pitch-angle diffusion coefficient D µµ of the particle, which can be related to the its scattering mean free path if the power spectrum of the turbulence is known (e.g. Hasselmann &amp; Wibberenz 1970;Schlickeiser 1989). However, because most power spectra are obtained at 1 au, assumptions about the radial dependence of the turbulent magnetic field must be made (e.g. Mason et al. 2012, and references therein). The properties and evolution of turbulence depend on the plasma properties, which change across the heliosphere and introduce many of the uncertainties in our understanding of the SEP transport problem. This picture will be altered significantly when Solar Orbiter travels to 0.28 au. With the help of the vector magnetic field and plasma measurements of the Solar Orbiter, it will be possible to map the power spectrum of the turbulent magnetic field as a function of heliocentric distance, which can be used to constrain the parameter space of the current transport models and hence improve their reliability.In combination with vector magnetic field and plasma measurements, energetic particles can be used as probes to study the large-scale structure of the coronal magnetic fields and the 3D structure of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in the near-Sun environment.

        <p>Finally, solar wind conditions, and hence transport effects, together with the evolution of the efficiency of CME driven shocks at accelerating particles and the magnetic connectivity between the observer and the source, play a major role in determining the variation of the peak intensity and fluence with the heliocentric radial distance during SEP events (Aran et al. 2005(Aran et al. , 2006;;Lario et al. 2006Lario et al. , 2007;;Vainio et al. 2007;Lario et al. 2013;He et al. 2017).

        <p>-The origin of relativistic ions in GLEs is still a topic of intense debate. There is evidence for a direct flare component (Masson et al. 2009;Kocharov et al. 2017) as well as a shock-accelerated component (Gopalswamy et al. 2012) in these events. The emission in well-connected GLEs usually starts right after the impulsive phase of the flare, which usually coincides quite well with the formation of the shock in the corona, marked by the commencement of a metric type II radio burst (Gopalswamy et al. 2012). Observations at the distance of the Earth are blurred by transport effects and so an accurate timing beyond an uncertainty of a few minutes in the release time is not possible. This hinders the association of particle release to the different flare and CME lift-off phenomena. In this respect, Solar Orbiter observations will provide a better timing of relativistic particle emission in the largest solar particle events and therefore it will improve our ability to relate a particle event to a particular phenomenon. -In the ecliptic at 1 au, relativistic solar electrons have been demonstrated empirically to be an effective tool for predicting the intensity of slower, later arriving, deka-MeV solar energetic protons from the same SEP event (Malandraki &amp; Crosby 2018;Posner 2007). Currently, the physical relationship linking SEP electron and proton acceleration and transport processes near the Sun is not well understood.

        <p>The mass and power budgets of EPD are given in Table 1. The overall nominal mass of the instrument is 15718 grams, which leads to a positive margin of 1282 grams with respect to the spacecraft mass requirement. This mass is distributed over the five functional EPD units (STEP, SIS, EPT-HET1, EPT-HET2 and ICU), as well as their intraharness and multi-layer insulator (MLI). Regarding the power budget, EPD power average consumption in operational mode is roughly 19 Watts, allowing for a wide safety margin of 8 Watts with respect to the allocated power budget for the EPD instrument. Each sensor unit of EPD requires a survival heater in order to keep it within its functional temperature range. The power consumption for the survival heaters is 16.36 Watts, well below the allocated power of 17.7 Watts.The mass and power budgets of EPD are given in Table 1.

        <p>The nominal telemetry budget of EPD is 3600 bps. Nevertheless, the elliptical orbit of Solar Orbiter will place the spacecraft at varying distances from the Earth, which will put restrictions on the instantaneous telemetry allocation available for the instruments. Although Solar Orbiter has a memory buffer to partly mitigate this effect, the EPD data production has to be planned in advance in order to maximise its scientific value. For this reason, EPD sensors have the ability to reduce their telemetry rates by changing the sampling cadences. Higher cadences will be used when the spacecraft is closer to the Sun. Another factor that will affect the instantaneous telemetry rate is solar activity, due to the adaptive compression scheme used by the units. This will require continuous adjustments of the observing plan in order to stay within the telemetry allocation.The nominal telemetry budget of EPD is 3600 bps.

Nevertheless, a small subset of scientific data will be sent to Earth with higher priority as low-latency data, typically the day after collection. The main purpose of these low-latency data is to give an overview of the recently acquired data, necessary for checking instrument performance, planning future operations, and to select periods of burst-mode data to be downlinked to Earth.

        <p>The STEP sensor (see Fig. 5) is designed to measure protons and electrons at supra-thermal energies (Table 2). For this purpose STEP employs principles and technologies used previously on other space-borne instruments. The basic detection principle is similar to that of the LION/COSTEP sensor on the Solar Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) (Müller-Mellin et al. 1995), the SEPT sensor on STEREO (Müller-Mellin et al. 2008), and the EPT sensor of EPD suite (Sect. 5). The STEP sensor employs two co-aligned sensor heads with a parallel field of view. One of the sensor heads contains a permanent magnet (see Sect. 4.2) to deflect electrons out of the nominal field of view. The sen-sor head with the magnet is called the "magnet channel" (MC) and will measure all particles in the nominal energy range except for electrons. The other sensor head will measure electrons in addition to ions, and is called the "integral channel" (IC). The difference of the count rates of the two sensor head detectors yields the electron count rate in the supra-thermal energy range.The STEP sensor (see Fig. 5) is designed to measure protons and electrons at supra-thermal energies (Table 2).

        <p>To measure the kinetic energy of the particles, each sensor head contains a solid state detector (SSD) with an ultra-thin window and several pixels, which is based on technology used for STE on STEREO (Lin et al. 2008) (see Sect. 4.1).

        <p>For the detection of low-energy particles STEP relies on two identical silicon semiconductor diode detectors with ultra-thin entrance contacts (Tindall et al. 2008). The silicon diode detectors were fabricated using a 200 Å thick phosphorous-doped polysilicon layer that forms the thin entrance window. A 220 Å thick aluminum layer is deposited on top of the polysilicon in order to reduce the response to stray light. Figure 6 illustrates the back side of the detector with its segmentation. The single pixels are arranged in an array of three rows and five columns. On top of that array there is a central segment/pixel for background determination. This pixel is shielded with an aluminum lid (the arm to hold that lid is partially visible in Fig. 7) on the entrance side to prevent particles from the nominal field of view from reaching the pixel. The pixel is therefore only susceptible to highly energetic particles penetrating the housing and passive parts of the sensor.For the detection of low-energy particles STEP relies on two identical silicon semiconductor diode detectors with ultra-thin entrance contacts (Tindall et al. 2008).

        <p>The detectors are operated fully depleted with a reverse bias voltage of about +70 V. Guard ring structures prevent leakage currents and cross-talk from one pixel to the others. To allow geometric factor adaptation the pattern of segments described above is repeated with a small offset using segments with a smaller area. The lengths of the segment edges are reduced from 2 mm for the large pixels to 0.3 mm for the smaller ones. The number of each small pixel corresponds to the number of the large pixel to the left of it in Fig. 6. Switching to the small pixels reduces the geometric factor by a factor of about 50, accordingly. The geometric factors are summarised in Table 2. Depending on the operational mode of the instrument, either all of the large or all of the small pixels are operated for data acquisition.

For noise-reduction purposes, the output signals of the CSAs are then shaped by filters with programmable filtering time constants.

        <p>The particle trajectories inside the sensor heads are influenced by multiple optical elements. As mentioned earlier, the basic working principle of both sensor heads is based on a segmented SSD together with a pinhole to achieve angular resolution. In the IC no further optical elements are present and the concept of geometric optics applies (see upper part of Fig. 8, dashed lines). The blackened front apertures for stray-light reduction are aligned with the resulting FoVs. In contrast to the IC, the MC includes a fine-tuned magnetassembly in order to filter electrons with energies lower than 200 keV while virtually not affecting the ion trajectories. Figure 9 shows a computer-aided-design (CAD) view of the optically relevant elements inside the MC. The pinhole and the detector are located at the same position along the particle trajectories (x-axis). The pinhole of the MC has a tiny offset of +0.25 mm in the z-axis of the instrument (axis as per Fig. 8).

        <p>The first set of permanent magnets installed in front of the pinhole bends the electrons (with energies below 200 keV) sufficiently downwards preventing them from passing the pinhole. In some rare cases (when incoming direction, offset, and energy match) the electrons can nevertheless pass the pinhole. In these rare cases a second set of stronger (larger) permanent magnets installed between the pinhole and the detector then reliably sweeps these electrons in the opposite direction not allowing them to reach the detector. With this technique electrons in Article number, page 9 of 35 the relevant energy range are prevented from directly interacting with the SSD. At the same time, the magnet assembly needs to ensure a virtually unaffected passage of ions of all relevant species and energies (including the least-rigid 4 keV protons) through the sensor head up to the SSD. This feature is necessary to allow differential measurements between both sensor heads. In fact, the ion trajectories are altered when traversing through the magnetic fields. While the first set of magnets bends the ions in the +z-direction (see Fig. 8), the second (stronger) set of magnets over-focuses the ion trajectories back in the -z-direction. The plane of intersection of the over-focused and the non-altered trajectories lies in the plane of the SSD detector. Thus, ions with identical parameters (ion species, energy, direction, and offset) will be detected in the same segment of the SSD with identical energy no matter which sensor head they are passing.

For calibration purposes the STEP unit was operated in a thermal vacuum chamber with a mission-plausible thermal gradient, acquiring 133 Ba data and specifically focusing on the low-energy gamma lines. A mission-expected thermal gradient was established in the unit at multiple mission-plausible temperatures. The calibration of each channel was found to vary with temperature. With the acquired data, a linear dependency of the calibration parameters on the IX (=ASIC) temperature was observed. The calibration parameters are explicitly given in Table 4.

        <p>For single particle interactions limited to one active segment of the SSD, the energy loss of the particle can be determined correctly. In cases where multiple active SSD segments are hit by incoming particles within the peaking time (flight-configurable, 6µs at time of launch), only the shaped signal of the current pulse Article number, page 12 of 35 that was the first to be induced will reach its full maximum peak in the shaper with certainty, before all signals go into peak-hold, which occurs when the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) issues the read-out signal to the ASIC. All current pulses that did not fully peak during the shaping time will not have reached their maximum, and thus their determined energy levels will be systematically too low. Since it is impossible to reproduce the chronological order of the arrival of the pulses, it is impossible to determine which of the channels has seen the full signal, and which has not.For single particle interactions limited to one active segment of the SSD, the energy loss of the particle can be determined correctly.

        <p>The trigger mask is the level-1 trigger of STEP. The FPGA investigates the coincidence condition based on the trigger mask, that is, which combination of SSD pixels have been hit. The coincidences between the pixels control which of the four hardcoded level-2 triggers is triggered. Each level-2 trigger is associated with one of four level-3 trigger classes. Table 5 lists the level-2 and corresponding level-3 trigger classes of STEP.The trigger mask is the level-1 trigger of STEP.

The result of the level-3 trigger is usually the increment of one or more histogram bins in the histogram memory, as well as controlling the filling of the 16 Pulse-Height-Analysis (PHA) buffers.

        <p>The data product engine is common to the EPT (Sect. 5), HET (Sect. 7), and STEP sensors, and uses a fully flight-configurable configuration table with up to 2048 entries corresponding to individual data products. The entries control the creation of science data telemetry to the ICU (Sect. 8). Entries are evaluated at a configurable cadence (usually 1 second) by the sensor FPGA. A single entry represents the sum of one or more bins in the histogram memory of the sensor, meaning that the data products can be used to represent an integration of multiple histogram bins. For each entry, the summing cadence and the number representation of the integration can be configured. The cadence for each entry can be set to values between a minimum of one second and maximum cadence of up to one hour. The number representation can be selected as well, to trade off telemetry volume and precision. For each entry, it is additionally possible to use a compression algorithm that takes into account the Poissonian nature of the counting process. The compression will slightly increase the error associated with a transmitted counter, but is designed to decrease the data rate if the changes in the count rate are low during one summing cadence. This is achieved by using run-length compression in addition to dropping bits deemed insignificant with respect to the Poissonian statistics. The compression engine records the error during one cycle, so after the "cycle cadence", the compression engine will transmit the "missed" counts due to the error propagation. This means that after a full cycle, no counts are lost and the count rate is accurately represented. Thus, the compression algorithm allows for sudden changes in count rate to be recorded (albeit with larger error) even at shorter cadences than the cycle cadence.The data product engine is common to the EPT (Sect. 5), HET (Sect. 7), and STEP sensors, and uses a fully flight-configurable configuration table with up to 2048 entries corresponding to individual data products.

        <p>The predecessor of the EPT, STEREO/SEPT, suffered from significant background noise from galactic cosmic rays coming through the telescope housing without triggering the anticoincidence. To mitigate this on EPT the detectors are much closer together (0.4 mm) and the cross-talk guard ring between the inner and outer segments is read out together with the outer segment as an anti-coincidence.

        <p>Sunshade and telescope door. Each of the two SIS telescopes has a sunshade in front to limit the access of both particles and stray light to the front foil in order to reduce background. The boresights of the sunward (SIS-A) and anti-sunward (SIS-B) telescopes are pointed 30 • and 160 • to the west of the spacecraft-Sun line, respectively. With this pointing, the sunward telescope 22 • full cone angle will intersect nominal interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) directions for most combinations of solar wind speed and radial distance from the Sun. In addition, each telescope has an independently controlled stepper motor driven iris door whose primary purpose in flight is to prevent instrument saturation by closing down the telescope aperture during intense events, similar to ACE/ULEIS. The doors move between four fixed settings (100% open, 25%, 5%, and 1%) using an onboard algorithm which improves the one used on the ACE/ULEIS doors. The sunward-facing telescope door is also used to protect the front foils in case of a spacecraft off-pointing condition. Figure 26 shows the SIS telescope with and without the housing cover showing major components such as the baffle and iris door. Geometric factor / harp and grid transmission. The SIS geometric factor is defined by the entrance aperture (40.0 mm diameter), the stop foil aperture (40.0 mm diameter), and their separation (206 mm). The geometric factor before losses is therefore 0.358 cm 2 sr, and the full cone angle is 22 • . The geometric factor is reduced by the transparency of grids (∼0.61) that support the foils and constitute the electrostatic mirrors. Furthermore, an aperture reduction plate was installed in both telescope sunshades to prevent stray light from entering the telescopes and generating background counts from the front foil. These aperture plates were specifically designed to mitigate known spacecraft structures around the telescope, and reduced the instrument geometric factor further. The final geometric factor of the instrument is listed in Table 13. Amplifiers for the SSDs are mounted in the back of the detector to minimise noise.

For H and He the forward secondary electron yields peak at roughly 3-20 electrons, while for backward emission the emission is lower by a factor of approximately two. An additional important effect is the dead area of the MCP front surfaces, which is approximately 50%. The triggering efficiency for single electrons hitting a channel may be less than unity since the plate bias is set to minimise ion feedback. Since both a Start and Stop pulse are required for a TOF trigger, the overall efficiency is the product of the two individual efficiencies.

The analysis of events itself and successive particle classification and identification in HET is performed in three levels, the so-called triggers.

Table 20 summarises the level-2 triggers of HET. The numbering of these level-2 triggers is shared with EPT, thus starting at #2.

        <p>In this section, the complex HET trigger logic and data processing will be illustrated using a sample oxygen particle and Fig. 33 for illustration. All single events for EPT-HET are continuously sampled and compared to a defined threshold for certain detectors.

The defined level-1 thresholds are 50 keV for all A and B detectors of HET in times of low particle flux. Therefore the sample event triggers the level-1 trigger for the A1 and B1 detectors.

        <p>The event matches the level-2 trigger #4 and is therefore further processed by the level-3 trigger class 1. The level-3 trigger performs a full calibration of necessary detectors and further classifies the event in for example stopping in B or stopping in C. Each level-3 trigger performs several threshold checks and comparisons in order to optimise the output of the trigger. Since the sample event did not deposit energy in the C detector, the stopping level-3 trigger treats this as an ABnC event. A path length correction for the A detector is performed and is used to calculate (A+B)•A 0.75 . Based on the resulting value, the event is stored in the appropriate histogram. In this case, with a value of 10776 MeV 1.75 , it is stored in the 2D heavy ion histogram for particles coming from the A1-, B1-side.

        <p>The output of the level-3 triggers of HET are predefined histograms from which certain bins are combined into data products. This subsection provides a brief explanation of the output of the level-3 triggers of the HET. An example of the HET penetrating level-3 trigger output is displayed in Fig. 34. The abundances are not scaled and only selected ions are shown. The simulation data are obtained from a Geant4 simulation with a powerlaw spectrum with an index of -1. The data are post-processed with a level-3 simulator which includes quenching in the BGO according to Tammen et al. (2015). The penetrating trigger demands a hit in all four silicon detectors. The directional separation of the ions is done in the histogram itself, by choosing the ratio of AB1 and AB2 as the y-axis, where AB is defined as min(A,B). The relativistic particles are located near a ratio of one on the y-axis, while slower particles are located at lower or higher y-values depending on their incoming direction. On the x-axis the energy deposition in the BGO scintillator is used, be- Table 20. HET level-2 trigger logic.

        <p>cause this leads to a good separation of individual ion species. The stopping triggers of HET have different kinds of outputs depending on the ion species. In order to explain how ABnC and ABC events are handled prior to storing them in histograms, Fig. 35 and Fig. 36 are used for illustration. The data displayed in these figures is simulation data obtained with a Geant4 simulation with the full HET telescope head, adjusted to abundances given in Reames ( 2017) with a power-law shape with an index of -3. The 3 He to 4 He ratio is chosen to be 1%, while the electron to proton ratio is 1:1. Quenching in the scintillator is calculated according to Tammen et al. (2015). The histograms are of the same type as the final 2D histograms of the HET level-3 triggers but are solely used for illustration. The electrons and the different ion species are classified by y-value cuts to store them in predefined histograms. These histograms differ in type, 1D or 2D and in their binning. There are separate histograms for both directions. The 1D histograms store the total deposited energy of a particle. The 2D histograms are more complex. By using the ratio of the total energy and the dE/dx as the x-axis, several ion species can fit in one histogram with only a limited amount of bins in the x-direction. The y-axis is chosen such that the different ion species are aligned horizontally and can be discriminated by simple y-value cuts. This is accomplished by multiplying the total deposited energy TOT with the dE/dx. In case of the ABnC trigger dE/dx is the energy deposited in the A detector and TOT is the sum of the energy deposition in the A and B detectors. In case of the ABC trigger dE/dx is the lower value of the deposited energies in A and B and TOT is the sum of the energy deposition in the A, B, and C detectors. An additional rotation is introduced by using T OT •(dE/dx) γ instead of only T OT •(dE/dx) for the yaxis. The value of γ is chosen such that 3 He and 4 He are aligned horizontally. This is necessary due to limitations of data product shapes. For the ABnC histograms γ = 0.75 and for the ABC histograms γ = 1.5. To illustrate the output and capability of the more complex 2D stopping histograms an example oxygen spectrum is shown for HET ABnC stopping in Fig. 37 and for HET ABC stopping in Fig. 38. The underlying simulation data are obtained using a Geant4 simulation with a complete HET telescope head as geometry and a power law energy spectrum with an index of -1. Based on Tammen et al. (2015) the quenching in the BGO is calculated and the data is run through a level-3 trigger simulator.cause this leads to a good separation of individual ion species. The stopping triggers of HET have different kinds of outputs depending on the ion species. In order to explain how ABnC and ABC events are handled prior to storing them in histograms, Fig. 35 and Fig. 36 are used for illustration. The data displayed in these figures is simulation data obtained with a Geant4 simulation with the full HET telescope head, adjusted to abundances given in Reames ( 2017) with a power-law shape with an index of -3. The 3 He to 4 He ratio is chosen to be 1%, while the electron to proton ratio is 1:1. Quenching in the scintillator is calculated according to Tammen et al. (2015). The histograms are of the same type as the final 2D histograms of the HET level-3 triggers but are solely used for illustration. The electrons and the different ion species are classified by y-value cuts to store them in predefined histograms. These histograms differ in type, 1D or 2D and in their binning. There are separate histograms for both directions. The 1D histograms store the total deposited energy of a particle. The 2D histograms are more complex.

        <p>The 2D histograms on the left-hand side of Fig. 37 and Fig. 38 show the expected output of the oxygen spectrum in our level-3 2D histograms. The histograms are binned as implemented on the unit. The green boxes are predefined data products, as given in Table 22 that will sum up the contents of the bins and store them in a counter. With a certain cadence this counter is then sent to Earth. The 1D histograms on the righthand side of Fig. 37 and Fig. 38 show the primary energy in megaelectronvolts/nucleons for the ions in the displayed data product bins. The HET also features a penetrating level-3 trigger for high-energy particles. Energy ranges for this trigger are given in Table 22. In addition to the histograms that are created by the level-3 triggers, PHA words are also directly generated for stopping as well as penetrating particles. As an addition to the penetrating trigger, HET also features a GCR trigger with a high geometric factor where a coincidence of both B-detectors is required. The particles have to be detected either in the inner or outer segments of the B-detectors and may not pass through the guard ring. The energy deposition in the BGO crystal for particles fulfilling these criteria is stored in a 1D histogram. One nominal data product for protons with 60 s cadence and two bins will be available.

        <p>The geometric factors of HET can be reduced during times of high particle flux to avoid an increase in dead time. This is achieved by raising the level-1 thresholds for the outer segments of the A-detectors to 6.2 MeV such that electrons and protons are fully rejected for all HET triggers. Particles entering the telescope through the inner segments of A are not affected by these cuts. The geometric factor reduction is given in Table 19. The effect of raising the threshold of the A-detectors outer segment is illustrated for the ABnC trigger in Fig. 39 with simulation data.The geometric factors of HET can be reduced during times of high particle flux to avoid an increase in dead time.

        <p>The HET FM units were calibrated in a thermal vacuum chamber. The FM1 was calibrated in a temperature range between -17 • C up to +46 • C in seven temperature steps and FM2 between -7 • C up to +46 • C in six temperature steps. The SSDs were calibrated using X-rays and resulting Compton edges from a 207 Bi radioactive source that was placed adjacent to the unit. Only single detector hits were used to ensure the detection of Xrays only. SSD calibration was performed using a group of five X-ray peaks that are modelled with Gaussian distributions for the fit. A Compton edge of the 569.698 keV γ-line is modelled with an inverse error function. The energies used for calibration are given in Table 25. For the calibration of the scintillation detector cosmic muons were used which were fitted with an approximation of a Landau distribution. The instrument was mounted vertically in the chamber to allow coincidence detection of muons in all HET SSDs and the scintillation detector. The deposited energy of 18.024 MeV of the cosmic muons was calculated using a Geant4 simulation. For each temperature step the individual peak positions were determined by fitting. From the fit results a temperature correction model for the SSDs, the crystal, and low-to-high-gain conversion factors was developed. The calibration factors given in Table 26 for FM1 and in Table 27 for FM2 are normalised to 0 • C. The temperature correction model used for all HET detectors and low-to-high-gain correction is given in Eq. 3. The parameters used for the individual detectors are given in Table 28 for HET FM1 and in Table 29 for HET FM2. The light output of most inorganic scintillators, including BGO, is dependent on temperature (Weber et al. 2003). The temperature dependence of BGO itself is well known and was studied in detail by Melcher et al. (1985). Their explanation for the temperature dependence is attributed to thermal excitations of the electrons to radiationless transitions. With increasing temperature the probability of a radiationless de-excitation of electrons increases, resulting in a reduced light output at high temperatures (Melcher et al. 1985). Figure 40 shows the temperature dependence of the scintillation efficiency of a BGO scintillator. The scintillation crystal in HET is read out by two Hamamatsu PIN photodiodes which are glued to the crystal using a transparent, rubber-like silicone glue. Experiments performed with an engineering model at different temperatures at a heavy ion accelerator (HIMAC, Japan) revealed that this scintillation light detection technique is sensitive to the crystal temperature. This effect is attributed to a contraction of the glue at low temperatures which leads to a detachment of the glue from the silicon of the photodiode, creating an optical barrier. The amount of lost light is dependent on the individual photodiode as shown in Fig. 41 where the amount of detected light of photodiode #2 is drastically reduced below 20 • C compared to photodiode #1. The effect is fully reversible and disappears above a certain temperature when the glue is again attached to the silicon. Because the temperature dependence of the light coupling might be different for each photodiode, each flight unit has been calibrated individually as presented in Sect. 7.4. An in-flight calibration of HET is also possible with the provided PHA-data (Sect. 7.2.4).The HET FM units were calibrated in a thermal vacuum chamber.

        <p>Most scintillators, including BGO, show a non-linearity in light output for heavy ionizing particles. The light loss is dependent on the scintillator material, the particle type and its energy. The effect is know as ionization quenching and was empirically described by J. B. Birks (Birks &amp; Firk 1965).

        <p>-To provide +28 V power supply to the sensors. Latch-current limiters (LCL) are used to switch the sensors on and off and also for monitoring current and voltage. In the case of overcurrent or under-voltage, LCLs provide protection to the sensors. -To distribute a pulse-per-second signal synchronously with the reception of the 
            <rs type="software">SpaceWire</rs> time-code, or in case the latter is missing, in an autonomous way with a period of one second. -To receive, store, and process the sensor telemetries, and generate from them the CCSDS (Consultative Comittee for Space Data Systems) science telemetries. Although the high peak baudrate of the data sent by the sensors requires the pro- cess to be completed in the background, the on-board software manages the storage always in the foreground, ensuring proper labelling of the absolute time at which the telemetries were received. -To store and manage the configuration tables of the sensors. These tables are made up of configuration message sequences that can be released to the sensors as a response to a ground command, or autonomously as part of the EPD error recovery mechanism. The sequences definition includes the interval between messages, which is controlled by the on-board software. -To provide standard PUS (Packet Utilisation Standard) services, such as telecommand verification (service 1), housekeeping (service 3), event reporting (service 5), memory management (service 6), on-board monitoring (service 12) or event-action (service 19). -To manage the accepted telecommands received from the spacecraft. These telecommands are executed, or forwarded to the sensors, depending on the process to which they are addressed. -To implement the mode and state logic required by the EPD instrument. This logic includes a safe mode, random-access memory (RAM) fault-tolerant, from which it is possible to reconfigure the EPD and replace the application software images from Earth in order to continue working in nominal mode. -To provide a fault detection, isolation, and recovery mechanism. Examples of the errors managed by this mechanism are: application software storage corruption, double EDAC error, software execution fatal error, ICU parameter out of limits, and sensor parameter out of limits. Examples of recovery actions are: transition to safe mode, ICU reboot and switch the application software image, turn off a sensor, sensor power cycle, or the sending of a configuration message sequence to a sensor. The on-board software catches proces-sor exceptions, and implements the PUS services 5, 12, and 19 in order to support this mechanism.
