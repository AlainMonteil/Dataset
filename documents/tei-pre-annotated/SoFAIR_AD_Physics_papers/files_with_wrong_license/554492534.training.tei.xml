        <p>We study the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) continuum slopes (𝛽) of galaxies at redshifts 8 &lt; 𝑧 &lt; 16 ( 𝑧 = 10), using a combination of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) ERO and ERS NIRCam imaging and ground-based near-infrared imaging of the COSMOS field. The combination of JWST and ground-based imaging provides a wide baseline in both redshift and absolute UV magnitude (-22.6 &lt; 𝑀 UV &lt; -17.9), sufficient to allow a meaningful comparison to previous results at lower redshift. Using a power-law fitting technique, we find that our full sample (median 𝑀 UV = -19.3 ± 1.3) returns an inversevariance weighted mean value of 𝛽 = -2.10 ± 0.05, with a corresponding median value of 𝛽 = -2.29 ± 0.09. These values imply that the UV colours of galaxies at 𝑧 &gt; 8 are, on average, no bluer than the bluest galaxies in the local Universe (e.g., NGC 1705; 𝛽 = -2.46). We find evidence for a 𝛽 -𝑀 UV relation, such that brighter UV galaxies display redder UV slopes (d𝛽/dM UV = -0.17 ± 0.05). Comparing to results at lower redshift, we find that the slope of our 𝛽 -𝑀 UV relation is consistent with the slope observed at 𝑧 5 and that, at a given 𝑀 UV , our 8 &lt; 𝑧 &lt; 16 galaxies are bluer than their 𝑧 5 counterparts, with an inverse-variance weighted mean offset of Δ𝛽 = -0.38 ± 0.09. We do not find strong evidence that any objects in our sample display ultra-blue UV continuum slopes (i.e., 𝛽 -3) that would require their UV emission to be dominated by ultra-young, dust-free stellar populations with high Lyman-continuum escape fractions. Comparing our results to the predictions of theoretical galaxy formation models, we find that the galaxies in our sample are consistent with the young, metal-poor and moderately dust-reddened galaxies expected at 𝑧 &gt; 8.We study the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) continuum slopes (𝛽) of galaxies at redshifts 8 &lt; 𝑧 &lt; 16 ( 𝑧 = 10), using a combination of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) ERO and ERS NIRCam imaging and ground-based near-infrared imaging of the COSMOS field.

        <p>Constraining the physical properties of the first galaxies is a key goal of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

These galaxies provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the properties of primordial stellar populations in the early Universe.Constraining the physical properties of the first galaxies is a key goal of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

        <p>One potential indicator of ultra-young, ultra-low metallicity, stellar populations is the power-law index of the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) continuum, 𝛽, where 𝑓 𝜆 ∝ 𝜆 𝛽 . At very young ages and low metallicities (e.g., 𝑡 &lt; 30 Myr and 𝑍 ★ 10 -3 ), and in the absence of dust extinction and nebular continuum emission, a very low (i.e., blue) value of 𝛽 -3 is expected (e.g., Schaerer 2002;Bouwens et al. 2010;Chisholm et al. 2022). A robust determination of 𝛽 = -3 would unequivocally indicate a stellar population that has recently formed from pristine (or near-pristine) gas with a large ionizing photon escape fraction (e.g., Robertson et al. 2010). Finding such galaxies ★ E-mail: fc@roe.ac.uk would therefore have important implications for our understanding of the first galaxies and the process of cosmic hydrogen reionization.One potential indicator of ultra-young, ultra-low metallicity, stellar populations is the power-law index of the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) continuum, 𝛽, where 𝑓 𝜆 ∝ 𝜆 𝛽 .

        <p>In the pre-JWST era, no strong evidence for such primordial 𝛽 = -3 populations was found. Studies of faint galaxies up to 𝑧 7-8 with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) revealed an average powerlaw index of 𝛽 -2, indicating moderately young and metal-poor, but in no sense extreme, stellar populations (e.g., Dunlop et al. 2013;Finkelstein et al. 2012;Bouwens et al. 2014). Indeed, 𝛽 -2 to 𝛽 -2.5 is typical of the bluest galaxies observed at 𝑧 = 2 -4 (e.g., McLure et al. 2018), and even in the local Universe (e.g., NGC 1705, 𝛽 = -2.46 ± 0.01, 𝑀 UV = -18; Calzetti et al. 1994;Vázquez et al. 2004). Early claims of extremely blue (i.e., 𝛽 ≤ -3) galaxies from HST imaging were later shown to be the result of an observational bias, pushing measurements towards artificially blue 𝛽 values for faint sources near the detection threshold (Bouwens et al. 2010;Dunlop et al. 2012;Rogers et al. 2013).In the pre-JWST era, no strong evidence for such primordial 𝛽 = -3 populations was found.

        <p>By providing unprecedentedly deep infrared imaging up to 𝜆 = 5 𝜇m, JWST/NIRCam now enables the first robust estimates of 𝛽 for galaxies at 𝑧 &gt; 8. Recently, Topping et al. (2022) have provided the first measurements of 𝛽 at 𝑧 7 -11 from JWST/NIRCam imaging in the EGS field. They find a median value of 𝛽 = -2.0, consistent with the blue, but otherwise unremarkable, populations found with HST. Interestingly, however, Topping et al. (2022) also report two galaxies with seemingly secure 𝛽 -3 measurements. The ultra-blue UV slopes inferred for these sources are bolstered by a lack of strong nebular emission-line signatures in the rest-frame optical photometry, indicating the large ionizing photon escape fractions expected for such a population.By providing unprecedentedly deep infrared imaging up to 𝜆 = 5 𝜇m, JWST/NIRCam now enables the first robust estimates of 𝛽 for galaxies at 𝑧 &gt; 8.

        <p>In this paper we use the new galaxy sample described in Donnan et al. (2022) to present a complementary study of UV continuum slopes for N = 61 galaxies in the redshift range 𝑧 8 -16 (with mean 𝑧 10). The Donnan et al. (2022) sample combines galaxies drawn from the early JWST deep fields (at 𝑧 9 -16) with an additional sample selected from wide-area ground-based near-IR imaging in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field (at 𝑧 8 -10). Crucially, with the inclusion of this ground-based sample, we can also probe the brightest galaxies at these redshifts, which evade current JWST surveys. This extended baseline in UV luminosity enables us to investigate 𝛽 across a factor of 80 in UV luminosity, placing early constraints on the relationship between 𝛽 and UV magnitude at 𝑧 &gt; 8 (i.e., the 𝛽 -𝑀 UV , or the colour-magnitude, relation; Rogers et al. 2014).In this paper we use the new galaxy sample described in Donnan et al.

        <p>Our JWST sample was initially presented in Donnan et al. (2022). The sample is drawn from public NIRCam imaging of three fields (SMACS J0723, GLASS and CEERS) released as part of the Early Release Observations (ERO, see Pontoppidan et al. 2022) and Early Release Science (ERS) programmes (Treu et al. 2022). Each of the three JWST fields were imaged in a combination of the F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M and F444W filters, with the specific combination of filters varying slightly from field to field (see Table 2 of Donnan et al. 2022). This JWST NIRCam imaging was reduced using PENCIL (PRIMER enhanced NIRCam Image Processing Library) which is a custom version of the 
            <rs type="software">JWST pipeline</rs> (
            <rs type="version">1.6.2</rs>) with additional steps for background subtraction and the removal of 'snowball' artefacts and including up-to-date calibrations and zero-point corrections (see Donnan et al. 2022). The final combined JWST NIRCam imaging area totalled 45 arcmin 2 (with some variation between filters). For this work, prior to catalogue construction, all of the NIRCam imaging was homogenized to the point-spread-function (PSF) of the F444W filter.

        <p>The JWST catalogues were created by running S E - (Bertin &amp; Arnouts 1996) in dual-image mode. The F200W image was used as the detection image to optimise for the selection 𝑧 ≥ 8 galaxies. The photometry for each JWST target was computed in both 0.5-arcsec and 0.36-arcsec diameter apertures.

However, we have confirmed that adopting the 0.36-arcsec diameter apertures would not change our main results. Redshifts for each object were estimated using the photometric redshift fitting code EAZY (Brammer et al. 2008). A thorough selection procedure, described in Donnan et al.

        <p>A number approaches to determining the UV continuum slope from broadband photometry have been presented in the literature, including single colour measurements (e.g., McLure et al. 2011;Dunlop et al. 2012Dunlop et al. , 2013) ) and SED template fitting (e.g., Finkelstein et al. 2012;Tacchella et al. 2022). Here we have adopted the power-law fitting method advocated by Rogers et al. (2014) in their study of the 𝛽 -𝑀 UV relation at 𝑧 5. For each source, the redshift was fixed to the best-fitting photometric redshift estimated by Donnan et al. (2022) and the photometry covering rest-frame wavelengths 𝜆 rest ≤ 3000 Å was modelled as a pure power law ( 𝑓 𝜆 ∝ 𝜆 𝛽 ), with IGM absorption at 𝜆 ≤ 1216 Å included using the Inoue et al. (2014) prescription. The only free parameter in this approach is 𝛽, the powerlaw spectral index of the UV continuum red-ward of 𝜆 = 1216 Å. We allowed 𝛽 to vary over the range -10 ≤ 𝛽 ≤ 10 and used the nested sampling code dynesty (Speagle 2020) to sample the full posterior distribution assuming a uniform prior.

        <p>We investigated the effect of redshift uncertainties by running an additional set of fits in which redshift (𝑧) was included as a free parameter. For the prior on redshift we assumed a Gaussian centered on the best-fitting photometric redshift from Donnan et al. (2022) (𝑧 phot ) with 𝜎 𝑧 = 1. We find that the effect of fitting for redshift on the derived values of 𝛽 is negligible, with a median difference across the sample of Δ𝛽 = 0.04, corresponding to a median difference in redshift of (𝑧 -𝑧 phot ) = -0.03. However, we find that marginalizing over a plausible range of redshifts in this way increases the typical error on 𝛽 by 13%. For the the purposes of this paper, we decided to fix our redshifts to the more-accurate 𝑧 phot values presented in Donnan et al. (2022) (i.e., which are derived from fitting to the full rest-frame UV to optical photometry) but increased the corresponding 𝛽 uncertainties by a factor 1.13.We investigated the effect of redshift uncertainties by running an additional set of fits in which redshift (𝑧) was included as a free parameter.

        <p>We note that our approach is similar to the power-law fitting method used by Topping et al. (2022), with the main difference being that our IGM model enables us to include filters encompassing the Lyman break. However, our results are unchanged if we restrict the fitting to filters red-ward of 1216 Å. Finally, it is also worth noting that we have explicitly assumed that any emission lines present in the UV spectrum -in particular Ly𝛼 -have a negligible impact on the observed photometry. This assumption appears to be justified based on the early, low-resolution, JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of 𝑧 &gt; 9 sources (e.g. Curtis-Lake et al. 2022;Roberts-Borsani et al. 2022).We note that our approach is similar to the power-law fitting method used by Topping et al.

        <p>In Fig. 1 we plot the 𝛽 values for our full JWST and COS-MOS/UltraVISTA sample versus redshift, 𝑧, and absolute UV magnitude, 𝑀 UV . As well as illustrating the typical 𝛽 values in our sample, the plots clearly demonstrate the power of combining JWST with ground-based surveys to probe a large dynamic range in both 𝑧 and, particularly, 𝑀 UV . The first point to note is the large scatter in observed 𝛽 values, which increases towards the faint luminosity limit in both samples. This effect is seen most dramatically for the JWST sample, where values as extreme as 𝛽 &lt; -4 are recovered at 𝑀 UV -19. However, the large error bars at these faint luminosities (𝜎 𝛽 1 at 𝑀 UV &gt; -19) suggests that this is predominantly a result of observational uncertainties. Indeed, the preference for low-luminosity galaxies to be scattered blue is a well-known effect, caused by the fact that if a galaxy's flux is boosted into the detection band it will always be biased towards bluer UV slopes (Dunlop et al. 2013;Rogers et al. 2013). At the brightest UV luminosities in the JWST sample, where the constraints on individual 𝛽 estimates improve significantly, the scatter noticeably reduces and fewer ultrablue (𝛽 &lt; -3) objects are seen. We will discuss implications for the detection reliability of ultra-blue objects at faint luminosities in more detail in Sections 3.2 and 4.1.In Fig. 1 we plot the 𝛽 values for our full JWST and COS-MOS/UltraVISTA sample versus redshift, 𝑧, and absolute UV magnitude, 𝑀 UV . As well as illustrating the typical 𝛽 values in our sample, the plots clearly demonstrate the power of combining JWST with ground-based surveys to probe a large dynamic range in both 𝑧 and, particularly, 𝑀 UV . The first point to note is the large scatter in observed 𝛽 values, which increases towards the faint luminosity limit in both samples. This effect is seen most dramatically for the JWST sample, where values as extreme as 𝛽 &lt; -4 are recovered at 𝑀 UV -19.

        <p>In the 𝛽 versus 𝑧 plot an increase in the scatter at 𝑧 9 -11 is apparent for the JWST sample. This is caused by a combination of (i) a larger number of intrinsically faint galaxies being detected in this redshift range, and (ii) a minimum in the number of filters covering rest-frame wavelengths 𝜆 rest ≤ 3000 Å (typically N filt = 3 at 𝑧 10.5 versus N filt = 4 at 𝑧 10.5, depending on the field). Interestingly, one of our most robust 𝛽 estimates is the putative 𝑧 16.4 galaxy candidate (CEERS 93316) reported in Donnan et al. (2022), which has 𝛽 = -1.9±0.15. This tight constraint is due, in part, to the excellent sampling of the rest-frame UV slope for this galaxy (it is covered by the F277W, F356W, F410M and F444W filters). Promisingly, if these extremely high-redshift objects are confirmedand if more are uncovered -JWST will be able to accurately constrain their UV continuum slopes thanks to the excellent coverage of the rest-frame UV continuum at 𝑧 &gt; 11.In the 𝛽 versus 𝑧 plot an increase in the scatter at 𝑧 9 -11 is apparent for the JWST sample.

        <p>It can be seen from Fig. 1 that the typical values of 𝛽 displayed by the galaxies in our 𝑧 8 -16 sample are somewhat bluer, but not obviously more extreme, than the typical values found at 𝑧 ≤ 8 with HST (i.e., 𝛽 -2; Dunlop et al. 2013). The distribution of points in Fig. 1 is consistent with being drawn from an underlying population with a relatively narrow intrinsic distribution of 𝛽, with some evidence for a shallow trend towards bluer 𝛽 values at fainter 𝑀 UV . In Table 2 we report the inverse-variance weighted mean 𝛽 value for our full sample, which we find to be 𝛽 = -2.10 ± 0.05. In this instance we preferred the weighted mean over the median so as not to be biased by the blue-scatter effect at faint luminosities (i.e., the blue-scattered galaxies are not down-weighted by their large uncertainties when taking the median). Indeed, the median of the full sample is 𝛽 = -2.29 ± 0.09, where the uncertainty on the median is estimated using the median absolution deviation estimator (𝜎 MAD = 1.483 × MAD). As expected, the median estimate is bluer, although the formal difference is only at the 2𝜎 level. Our sample average is in decent agreement with the median values reported at 𝑧 7 -11 in Topping et al. (2022) (𝛽 = -2.0 at 𝑧 7 and 𝛽 = -1.9 at 𝑧 8 -11).It can be seen from Fig. 1 that the typical values of 𝛽 displayed by the galaxies in our 𝑧 8 -16 sample are somewhat bluer, but not obviously more extreme, than the typical values found at 𝑧 ≤ 8 with HST (i.e., 𝛽 -2; Dunlop et al. 2013).

        <p>A bias towards bluer values of 𝛽 at faint magnitudes is a well-known phenomenon that has been extensively documented in 𝐻𝑆𝑇 studies (e.g. Bouwens et al. 2010;Dunlop et al. 2012;Rogers et al. 2013). The bias occurs due the that fact that high-redshift galaxy candidates are typically selected using a photometric filter as close as possible to the Lyman break where the UV spectral energy distribution of young star-forming galaxies peaks. At faint magnitudes, this favours the selection of objects whose photometry has been 'up-scattered' in the short-wavelength detection band; these objects will naturally appear bluer than they actually are.A bias towards bluer values of 𝛽 at faint magnitudes is a well-known phenomenon that has been extensively documented in 𝐻𝑆𝑇 studies (e.g. Bouwens et al. 2010;Dunlop et al. 2012;Rogers et al. 2013).

        <p>To investigate the magnitude of this effect in our JWST sample we ran a simple simulation. We first constructed 20,000 simple powerlaw SEDs with a intrinsic UV slope of 𝛽 int = -2.1 at the median redshift of the JWST galaxies (𝑧 = 10.5). The UV magnitudes were drawn uniformly within the range -20.0 ≤ 𝑀 UV ≤ -18.0 and IGM attenuation was applied using the Inoue et al. (2014) prescription. Photometry was generated in each of the JWST filters and scattered according the the typical imaging depths (averaging the depths across multiple fields where appropriate). The 'observed' UV continuum slopes (𝛽 obs ) were then recovered for the simulated galaxies using the same method applied to the real observations. The results of this simulation are shown in Fig. 4. Our results are consistent with the trends observed in previous works (e.g, Rogers et al. 2013). We find that, at faint 𝑀 UV , the galaxies with the highest signal-to-noise ratio in the detection band (F200W) are biased blue. If we mimic the selection of our sample (i.e., requiring a ≥ 5𝜎 detection in F200W) we find that 𝛽 int is accurately recovered -on averagefor galaxies brighter than 𝑀 UV -19.3, but becomes increasingly biased to blue values at fainter magnitudes (black dashed line in Fig. 4).

Our results indicate that galaxies at the faint end of our sample (i.e., 𝑀 UV -18.5) will have Δ𝛽 = -0.2, on average.</p>
        <p>Applying this average bias correction to the individual galaxies in our sample does not strongly affect our main results. We find that the recovered slope of the the 𝛽 -𝑀 UV relation becomes slightly shallower (d𝛽/dM UV = -0.10 ± 0.06; still consistent with the Rogers et al. ( 2014) and Bouwens et al. (2014) slopes at 𝑧 = 5 within 1𝜎) and the inverse-variance weighed mean of the sample slightly redder ( 𝛽 = -2.05 ± 0.05), but both remain fully consistent with the original non-corrected values. Nevertheless, as sample sizes increase, and the statistical uncertainties are reduced, this effect will clearly become more important, potentially requiring more sophisticated simulations including source injection/recovery, treatment of individual fields, and a consideration of aperture effects and redshiftdependent systematics.Applying this average bias correction to the individual galaxies in our sample does not strongly affect our main results.

        <p>Fig. 5 also emphasises the fact that even in the magnitude regime where the average properties are accurately recovered, the scatter of any individual 𝛽 obs can still be substantial. For example, at the magnitude of our most robust ultra-blue candidate (𝑀 UV -20; Section 3.2) the bias for individual objects in our simulation can be as large at Charlot &amp; Fall (2000) dust model with an attenuation curve somewhat stepper than the Calzetti et al.

Both simulations predict slightly larger 𝛽 values compared to themodel and slightly shallower 𝛽 -𝑀 UV slopes (d𝛽/dM UV -0.1). However, neither are obviously incompatible with our data and paint the same basic picture of a uniformly blue (𝛽 -2) galaxy population at 𝑧 &gt; 8.

        <p>Based on the UDF-12 dataset, Dunlop et al. (2013) provided the first tentative estimate of 𝛽 at 𝑧 = 9. The Dunlop et al. (2013) sample consisted of faint galaxies with 𝑀 UV -18 and photometric measurements in the HST 𝐽 140 and 𝐻 160 filters. Using a single-colour estimate, Dunlop et al. (2013) found 𝛽 = -1.80 ± 0.63. This value is larger (redder) than predicted by our best-fitting 𝛽 -𝑀 UV relation, but clearly consistent with our data within the substantial uncertainty (Fig. 5). Some degree of systematic offset is perhaps unsurprising given the limited rest-frame UV coverage of the Dunlop et al. (2013) data. Technically, the Dunlop et al. (2013) measurement is an estimate of 𝛽 in the far-ultraviolet, whereas our measurement (and all others shown in Fig. 5) span far-and near-ultraviolet wavelengths. Indeed, if we restrict our data to similar rest-frame wavelengths ( 1600Å) we recover a inverse-variance weighed mean of 𝛽 = -1.90 ± 0.10 for our JWST sample. In that sense, the rest-frame FUV colors of the Dunlop et al. (2013) sample are fully consistent with our new JWST sample. However, the addition of longer-wavelength anchors at 𝜆 &gt; 2000Å does favour a bluer 𝛽 . Wilkins et al. (2016) presented measurements of 𝛽 for five literature sources at 9.6 &lt; 𝑧 phot &lt; 10.2. Their sample was comprised of four galaxies drawn from the GOODS-South and GOODS-North field (Oesch et al. 2014), and one gravitatioanlly lensed source reported in Zheng et al. (2012). The full sample spans the UV magnitude range -21.6 ≤ 𝑀 UV ≤ -19.4. UV continuum slopes for these sources were determined using a single colour measurement (𝐻 F160W -3.6𝜇m) probing the rest-frame UV continuum in the range 1200Å 𝜆 3700Å. The five Wilkins et al. (2016) 2021) reported 𝛽 = -2.52 +0.32 -0.20 for eight lensed 𝑧 = 9 galaxies in the Frontier Field cluster MACS J0416.1 -2403. The median magnification-corrected absolute UV magnitude of their sample was 𝑀 UV = -19.44. Stellar population models were fit to multi-wavelength photometry spanning 0.4 -4.5𝜇m (i.e., rest-frame UV to optical wavelengths) and 𝛽 was calculated from the best-fitting model using the Calzetti et al. (1994) windows. The Bhatawdekar &amp; Conselice (2021) measurement is clearly in good agreement with our data; our best-fitting relation predicts 𝛽 = -2.4 at 𝑀 UV = -19.44 (Fig. 5). Interestingly, Bhatawdekar &amp; Conselice (2021) also report a tentative colormagnitude slope of d𝛽/dM UV = -0.19 ± 0.11 at 𝑧 = 9.

Again, these measurements are fully consistent with our data, although in this case the comparison is primarily with our bright ground-based COS-MOS/UltraVISTA sample (Fig. 5).

The median mass and metallicity of the simulated sample is 𝑀 ★ 10 8.5 𝑀 and 𝑍 ★ 0.1𝑍 . The mean stellar age of the sample is 100 Myr. We calculated an observed 𝛽 for each galaxy (i.e., after the application of dust reddening) by fitting a power-law to the noise-free mock photometry. The predicted 𝛽 -𝑀 UV relation (observed) is shown in the right-hand panel of Fig. 5, where it can be seen that the overall normalization of the relation is in good agreement with our data. The slope of the -relation (d𝛽/dM UV -0.15) is also fully consistent with our estimate. The 2D histogram in Fig. 5 shows the intrinsic scatter, which increases from 𝜎 sc = 0.1 at 𝑀 UV = -18 to 𝜎 sc = 0.3 at 𝑀 UV = -22, again in reasonable agreement with our estimate of 𝜎 sc = 0.35.It is instructive to compare our results to the predictions of state-ofthe-are galaxy formation models. As our main comparison, we use the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model ( -) for galaxy formation (Somerville et al. 2015(Somerville et al. , 2021)). The -includes sophisticated prescriptions for cosmological accretion, gas cooling, star-formation, chemical enrichment and stellar and AGN feedback, and has been shown to successfully reproduce the global properties and scaling relations of the high-redshift galaxy population out to 𝑧 = 10 (Yung et al. 2019a,b).

This is unsurprising, as the intrinsic low-order shape of the UV continuum is not strongly metallicity-dependent (Cullen et al. 2019), and at high redshifts the of effect stellar population age is limited by the young age of the Universe (Tacchella et al. 2022). Across the full range in 𝑀 UV , the median UV attenuation increases from 𝐴 UV = 0.05 to 𝐴 UV = 0.64 (i.e., galaxies at the bright end in the -suffer a factor 2 decrease in their intrinsic UV flux). The increase in scatter at the bright end is also driven by dust, with a larger range of 𝐴 UV at bright magnitudes. At 𝑀 UV = -22, the standard deviation of the 𝐴 UV distribution is 𝜎 𝐴 UV = 0.4, compared to 𝜎 𝐴 UV = 0.1 at 𝑀 UV = -18.Both the shape and scatter of the 𝛽 -𝑀 UV relation in theare driven by UV dust attenuation (𝐴 UV ).
