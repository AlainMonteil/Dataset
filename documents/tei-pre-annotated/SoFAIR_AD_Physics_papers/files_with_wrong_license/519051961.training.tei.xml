        <p>emory technology has been revolutionized by the discovery of the giant magnetoresistance 1,2 and spin-transfer torque effects 3,4 , which arise from the efficient coupling of charge and spin currents in ferromagnetic materials. The spincharge coupling is a crucial aspect of magneto-electronic devices, namely spin valves that consist of two layers of ferromagnetic materials separated by a non-magnetic layer, in which altering the relative magnetization orientation of the layers results in a substantial change in resistance 5 . Such spin valves can be designed in the two-dimensional (2D) limit owing to the recent emergence of 2D magnetic materials 6,7 in the architecture of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures in which exceptional functionalities are achieved by integrating the properties of the individual layers 8 .emory technology has been revolutionized by the discovery of the giant magnetoresistance 1,2 and spin-transfer torque effects 3,4 , which arise from the efficient coupling of charge and spin currents in ferromagnetic materials.

        <p>Furthermore, most spintronic applications require the strong spin-charge coupling in the 2D magnetic materials to be accompanied with a long-distance transfer of the spin information. In this regard, graphene is a superior choice with its high charge carrier mobility as the absence of hyperfine interactions and small intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) allow for a long spin lifetime [9][10][11] . The proximity of other materials to graphene can efficiently modulate its band structure and induce considerable SOC 12,13 and exchange interaction [14][15][16][17][18] , which are essential for spin generation and manipulation. In particular, the proximity effect of 2D magnetic materials would bring the technology of ultrathin spin-logic devices to the limit when the magnetic behaviour of an individual atomic layer directly controls the long-distance information transfer by the spins in the neighbouring graphene layer.Furthermore, most spintronic applications require the strong spin-charge coupling in the 2D magnetic materials to be accompanied with a long-distance transfer of the spin information.

        <p>The experimental realization of the proximity-induced exchange interaction in graphene has been reported, and observed as Shubnikov de-Haas oscillations and the Zeeman spin Hall effect [19][20][21] , anomalous Hall effect (AHE) 22,23 and the Hanle precession of injected spins by the induced exchange field (B exch ) [24][25][26][27] . Among them, the latter is the most unambiguous and reliable approach when spin-sensitive Co electrodes are used to directly detect the modulation of the spin signal by the B exch . However, so far Hanle precession measurements in graphene have shown a rather weak exchange interaction, which only leads to an additional precession of the spins around the B exch . Even though all these experimental reports so far have shown evidence for an induced B exch , the active generation of spin currents by graphene both electrically and thermally, as the most technologically relevant aspect of the induced magnetism, has not been addressed yet.The experimental realization of the proximity-induced exchange interaction in graphene has been reported, and observed as Shubnikov de-Haas oscillations and the Zeeman spin Hall effect [19][20][21] , anomalous Hall effect (AHE) 22,23 and the Hanle precession of injected spins by the induced exchange field (B exch ) [24][25][26][27] .

        <p>In this work, we detected the spin polarization of conductivity together with the spin-dependent Seebeck effect (SDSE) in bilayer graphene proximity coupled to 2D interlayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) CrSBr. The spin-transport measurements directly address the conductivity in graphene, and show a strong spin polarization up to 14%, which is as large as that in metallic ferromagnets. This is evidenced by the efficient electrical and thermal generation of spin currents by the magnetic graphene, up to the magnetic transition temperature of CrSBr. These observations, together with AHE measurements, promise major advances in 2D spintronic/ spin-caloritronic circuitry. Additionally, they give insight into the magnetic nature of graphene, controlled by the AFM dynamics of CrSBr.In this work, we detected the spin polarization of conductivity together with the spin-dependent Seebeck effect (SDSE) in bilayer graphene proximity coupled to 2D interlayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) CrSBr.

        <p>The strong exchange interaction results in a considerable spin splitting (Δ) of the graphene band structure. The resulting substantial difference in the density of charge carriers (n) with spin parallel (↑) and antiparallel (↓) to the B exch (Fig. 1a) leads to the spin-dependent conductivity. The spin polarization of conductance in graphene (P Gr ) is expected to be efficiently tunable by shifting the position of the Fermi energy (E F ) with a gate electric field (as proposed in Fig. 1b), and to reach the maxima of its absolute value when the density of any of the two carrier types is minimal. Such an efficient gate tunability of the spin polarization of conductivity is the basis for all-electric spin field-effect transistors in spin-logic circuitries 28 . The use of bilayer graphene is particularly encouraged, as it can allow for gate tunability of the exchange splitting [29][30][31][32] .The strong exchange interaction results in a considerable spin splitting (Δ) of the graphene band structure.

        <p>Ultracompact spintronic devices greatly benefit from the implementation of two-dimensional materials that provide large spin polarization of charge current together with long-distance transfer of spin information. Here spin-transport measurements in bilayer graphene evidence a strong spin-charge coupling due to a large induced exchange interaction by the proximity of an interlayer antiferromagnet (CrSBr). This results in the direct detection of the spin polarization of conductivity (up to 14%) and a spin-dependent Seebeck effect in the magnetic graphene. The efficient electrical and thermal spin-current generation is the most technologically relevant aspect of magnetism in graphene, controlled here by the antiferromagnetic dynamics of CrSBr. The high sensitivity of spin transport in graphene to the magnetization of the outermost layer of the adjacent antiferromagnet, furthermore, enables the read-out of a single magnetic sublattice. The combination of gate-tunable spin-dependent conductivity and Seebeck coefficient with long-distance spin transport in a single two-dimensional material promises ultrathin magnetic memory and sensory devices based on magnetic graphene. 33 . Here we tackled this obstacle by utilizing the recently explored CrSBr 2D crystal (Fig. 1c), which is an air-stable vdW semiconductor (bandgap of ~1.5 eV; see Supplementary Section 18 for transport measurements) with an interlayer AFM ordering up to a relatively high Néel temperature of T N ≈ 132 K (refs. [34][35][36][37] ). Furthermore, the antiferromagnetism promises ultrafast operations and robustness against external magnetic fields 38 and also is expected to be tunable by a gate electric field 35,39 . Mechanical cleavage of the CrSBr crystal results in flakes with a specific rectangular geometry that correlates with its in-plane magnetic anisotropy axes (Fig. 1d inset). The behaviour of CrSBr magnetization (M CSB ) measured versus an external magnetic field (B) using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (Fig. 1d) displayed a sharp modulation of M CSB when B was applied along the y axis. This corresponds to the AFM behaviour with a spin-flip transition at an applied magnetic field of B M,y ∼0.2 T (at which M CSB switches along the y axis) and defines the y direction as the in-plane magnetic easy axis. In contrast, along the x direction, M CSB increased gradually with a much higher saturation field (B M,x ≈ 1 T). This is a result of the gradual canting of the antiparallel magnetizations of the CrSBr layers towards the x direction (the in-plane magnetic hard axis). When graphene is brought on top of the CrSBr flake, the magnetic behaviour of the outermost CrSBr layer is imprinted in the graphene so that the magnetization of graphene (M Gr ) is expected to be collinear with the magnetization of the outermost layer of the CrSBr flake (the alignment of M Gr and M CSB is further discussed in Supplementary Section 13).Ultracompact spintronic devices greatly benefit from the implementation of two-dimensional materials that provide large spin polarization of charge current together with long-distance transfer of spin information.

        <p>Spin-dependent conductivity. The presence of spin-dependent conductivity in graphene was directly observed in the spin-valve design shown in Fig. 1e. Using the three-terminal (3T) geometry, the resistance was measured versus the magnetic field B y , applied along the easy axes of the Co electrodes and the CrSBr crystal. As shown in Fig. 1g, in the spin-valve heterostructure of Co/Al 2 O 3 / magnetic graphene, the relative orientation of M Gr with respect to M Co defines the spin polarization of the injected current and therefore considerably changes the resistance of the contact between graphene and Co (R 3T ). The abrupt change in resistance (Fig. 1h), which depends on the relative orientation of M Gr and M Co , resembles the giant magnetoresistance effect, but with the advantage of a long-distance spin transfer in the graphene. This would not happen in a conventional 3T measurement with a non-magnetic graphene, because when the Co magnetization is reversed both spin injection and detection simultaneously change sign, which results in no magnetoresistance 40 . Therefore, the observation of the 3T spin-valve effect is only possible if the graphene is magnetic, with a non-zero spin polarization of conductance P Gr .Spin-dependent conductivity.

        <p>The spin-charge current coupling in graphene was further studied by measuring the pure spin current generated by the magnetized graphene in a non-local four-terminal (4T) geometry (Fig. 2a), in which the charge current path can be fully separated from the voltage detection circuit. The non-local resistance (R nl = V/I) is measured versus B y . In an equivalent measurement on pristine graphene, one would observe two (non-local) resistance levels associated with the parallel and antiparallel magnetization alignment of the injector and detector Co electrodes 9 . In contrast, here we observed three resistance levels that are only possible if the spin transport in graphene depends on the relative orientation of M Gr (or M CSB ) with respect to the magnetization of the injector M Co,inj and that of the detector M Co,det electrodes. The spin-valve measurement was performed with an initial alignment of all three magnetic elements (injector, detector and CrSBr) at B y = -1 T. By increasing the field B y from 0 T, the magnetizations of the injector and the detector electrodes switched to the opposite direction one after the other at B y ≲ 50 mT. The third switch (at B y ≈ 0.21 T) happened at a value of the field that is too large to be related to the Co electrodes, given their geometrical anisotropy. However, it corresponds well with switching field of the M CSB along its easy axis (shown in the SQUID magnetometry of Fig. 1d), which directly confirms the non-zero spin polarization of the graphene conductivity as a result of the proximity-induced magnetism.The spin-charge current coupling in graphene was further studied by measuring the pure spin current generated by the magnetized graphene in a non-local four-terminal (4T) geometry (Fig. 2a), in which the charge current path can be fully separated from the voltage detection circuit.

        <p>The spin polarization in graphene is defined as P Gr = (σ uσ d )/ (σ u + σ d ), where σ u and σ d are conductivities for spin-up and spin-down channels. Solving the spin-charge coupled diffusive transport equations (Supplementary Section 5), we derived the non-local resistance as:The spin polarization in graphene is defined as P Gr = (σ uσ d )/ (σ u + σ d ), where σ u and σ d are conductivities for spin-up and spin-down channels. Solving the spin-charge coupled diffusive transport equations (Supplementary Section 5), we derived the non-local resistance as:</p>
        <p>λRsq 2W e -L/λ (P inj -P Gr )(P det -P Gr )λRsq 2W e -L/λ (P inj -P Gr )(P det -P Gr )</p>
        <p>where P inj and P det are the spin polarizations of the injector and detector contacts and λ, R sq , L and W are the spin relaxation length, square resistance, length and width, respectively, of the graphene channel (in between the injector and detector contacts). The above expression can be expanded as:where P inj and P det are the spin polarizations of the injector and detector contacts and λ, R sq , L and W are the spin relaxation length, square resistance, length and width, respectively, of the graphene channel (in between the injector and detector contacts). The above expression can be expanded as:</p>
        <p>R nl ∝ P inj P det -P Gr P det -P inj P Gr + P Gr P Gr (2)R nl ∝ P inj P det -P Gr P det -P inj P Gr + P Gr P Gr (2)</p>
        <p>The P inj P det term corresponds to a spin signal injected/detected via ferromagnetic injector/detector contacts. P inj P Gr is due to the spin injection via ferromagnetic contact, but the non-local signal is detected as a charge voltage that builds up because of the spin-to-charge conversion that happens in graphene itself and P Gr P det corresponds to the reciprocal effect. Finally, P Gr P Gr is due to the spin signal that is both generated and detected by graphene itself. The presence of the last term implies that, in principle, spin polarized contacts are not required to observe the charge-spin current coupling. However, it might not be possible to differentiate it from a spurious background under an applied B when only non-magnetic electrodes are used. Here we estimated λ to be about 630 nm and obtained the polarizations as P Gr ≈ 14% and P inj ≈ P det ≈ -24% (Supplementary Sections 4-10). Having the P Gr , we roughly estimated the exchange splitting to be Δ = 2E F P Gr ≈ 20 meV, which corresponds to B exch ≈ 170 T, assuming E F to be the same as that in device D3 (Supplementary Section 11). Note that in an electron-doped device D2 (Supplementary Section 17), we observed an opposite sign for P Gr as compared with that in device D1. This is an indication of the possible gate tunability of the spin polarization of conductivity in graphene, consistent with Fig. 1b. The modulation of the spin signal under the magnetic field B x applied in-plane, perpendicular to the Co and CrSBr easy axes, further confirms the presence of the very large B exch in the graphene (Fig. 2b). We label this experiment a Hanle measurement as a generalized term, as the effect of the B exch on the spins is similar to that of an external field. In this system, the precession is governed by the B exch as its magnitude is much larger than the B x . The B x controls the directions of M Co and M CSB (or B exch ) by pulling them towards the x axis with saturation fields of B Co ≈ 0.2 T and B CSB ≈ 1.3 T. The Hanle curves in Fig. 2b are measured after the initial alignment of the M Co and M CSB along the y axis, which sets the magnetization configuration that corresponds to L1, L2 or L3 (as labelled in Fig. 2a). The B x is applied perpendicular to the initial direction of the injected spins. For L1, the R nl has its maximum value at B x = 0 T, as the injected spins are aligned with the B exch . Once the B x pulls the M Co along the x direction, the strong B exch fully randomizes the component of the injected spins that are perpendicular to it. At B x ≈ 0.2 T, the magnetization directions of the contacts are saturated along the x axis while B exch is still mostly pointing along the y axis. This yields to only a small projection of the injected spins in the direction of B exch , and thus results in a considerable decay of R nl . The increase to B x &gt; 0.2 T pulls the M CSB further along the x direction with saturation at 1.3 T. When the M CSB aligns with M Co once again, the R nl retrieves its initial value. The Hanle curves measured for the antiparallel alignment of M CSB with respect to M Co,inj or M Co,det (which correspond to configurations L2 or L3 in Fig. 2a) also show a similar behaviour, but with the distinct initial value of R nl at B x = 0 T. Overall, the behaviour of the spin signal in the Hanle curves is determined by the relative orientation of the M Co and M Gr as the very large B exch allows for the information transfer only by the spins collinear to the M Gr . The Fig. 2b inset shows the Hanle curves derived from the analytical expression for the R nl (Supplementary Section 8), which agree well with the experimental results.The P inj P det term corresponds to a spin signal injected/detected via ferromagnetic injector/detector contacts.

        <p>Spin-dependent Seebeck effect. The strong induced magnetism in graphene also led to the observation of a SDSE 41,42 . Owing to the spin dependence of the Seebeck coefficient, we could generate spin current by having a thermal gradient in the magnetized graphene channel (Fig. 3a). We measured the second harmonic signal associated with thermal effects due to Joule heating (ΔT ∝ I 2 ). Figure 3b shows that the non-local second harmonic resistance (R 2ω nl = V 2ω /I 2 , where ω is the frequency of the source current) abruptly changes with the switch of the detector magnetization direction (at B y ≈ 50 mT), which becomes antiparallel to the CrSBr magnetization. The spin signal retrieves its initial value when M CSB also switches (at ≈ 0.21 T) and becomes parallel to M Co,det again. We observed that the switch in the direction of the injector magnetization at B y ≈ 35 mT did not change the R 2ω nl . This assures the thermal origin of the measured spin signal that is generated only by the Joule heating of graphene at the injector contact, independent of the injector magnetization. In Fig. 3c,d, we demonstrate the modulation of the SDSE spin signal versus B x measured for the different magnetization configurations of the injector, detector and CrSBr (defined for L1, L2 and L3 in Fig. 3b). The modulation of the R 2ω nl versus B x is understood given the collinearity of the thermally injected spins with the magnetization of graphene, consistent with theoretically calculated curves shown in the inset of Fig. 3d (also see Supplementary Section 12). The similar behaviour of the second harmonic L1 and L2 Hanle curves further confirms that M Co,inj has no influence on the detected signal.Spin-dependent Seebeck effect.

The modulation of the R 2ω nl versus B x is understood given the collinearity of the thermally injected spins with the magnetization of graphene, consistent with theoretically calculated curves shown in the inset of Fig. 3d (also see Supplementary Section 12). The similar behaviour of the second harmonic L1 and L2 Hanle curves further confirms that M Co,inj has no influence on the detected signal.</p>
        <p>The generation of the spin currents by the magnetized graphene should persist up to the relatively high Néel temperature of CrSBr (T N ≈ 132 K). We examined this by the local and non-local spin transport measurements at various temperatures (Fig. 4). The dependence of the spin signal on temperature reflects the temperature dependence of the magnetization of CrSBr layers. The spin-valve and Hanle curves, measured non-locally up to T = 100 K (Fig. 4a), show a substantial decay of the spin signal. This is further confirmed by the two-terminal measurements plotted in Fig. 4b. The considerable spin polarization of graphene allows for the detection of large spin signals in the local two-terminal geometry, which shows three resistance levels that correspond to the magnetization switch of contact C1, C2 and CrSBr. Consistent with the non-local measurements, the size of the spin-valve switches decreases with a rise in temperature and fully vanishes (below the noise level) at T &gt; 100 K. Such a decay is attributed to the randomization of the magnetization of CrSBr and suppression of the induced magnetism in graphene, as the decay is much larger than that expected from the temperature dependence of Co spin polarization or spin transport in graphene on non-magnetic substrates 11,43 . Moreover, we observed that, as the temperature increases, B M,y shifts towards smaller values (Fig. 4b inset), consistent with the temperature dependence of the SQUID magnetometry of CrSBr 36 .The generation of the spin currents by the magnetized graphene should persist up to the relatively high Néel temperature of CrSBr (T N ≈ 132 K).

        <p>Anomalous Hall effect. The induced magnetism in graphene, if accompanied with SOC, is expected to result in the emergence of AHE 44 . We assessed this by interfacing a thin exfoliated CrSBr bulk flake with a graphene Hall bar (Fig. 5a) and measuring the transverse voltage (V xy ) as a function of the out-of-plane magnetic field (B z ) when a longitudinal current was applied. The B z gradually pulled the M CSB out of the 2D plane, which led to an imbalance in the density of the out-of-plane spins. The AHE introduces a sizable non-linearity in the B dependence of the transverse resistance R xy . The subtraction of the ordinary Hall effect (linear in B) provides us with the solitary contribution of the AHE (R AHE ) that fully saturates at B z ≈ 4 T, shown for various gate voltages in Fig. 5b. The strength of the AHE depends on the position of the E F in the band structure of the magnetized graphene. Figure 5c shows an increase in the extracted non-linearity of the Hall voltage as the E F approaches the charge neutrality point and preserves the sign for both electrons and holes. Note that the possible presence of the electron-hole puddles can contribute to the non-linearity of the Hall voltage when the E F is close to the charge neutrality point in a non-homogeneous graphene channel 45 . The observation of the AHE not only confirms the induced magnetism but also indicates an enhanced SOC in the graphene that allows for the emergence of additional spin-to-charge conversion mechanisms (for example, spin Hall or Rashba-Edelstein effects) 46 . conclusions These findings present the air-stable graphene/CrSBr vdW heterostructure as an exceptional platform for addressing a broad range of spin-dependent phenomena 5,11 and quantum effects in magneto-electronic devices 47,48 because the magnetism, SOC and long spin lifetime are brought together in a single 2D lattice. The direct measurement of the strong spin-polarized conductance in graphene in the proximity of an antiferromagnet ensures its applications for the prospective 2D memory technology with an ultrafast operation and the long-distance transfer of spin information. In magnetic tunnel junctions, for instance, the generated spin currents by the magnetic graphene can be used to induce a spin-transfer torque in 2D magnetic random access memories 49,50 . Moreover, graphene with a high sensitivity of charge and spin transport to the magnetization of the outermost layer of the neighbouring 2D AFM CrSBr provides a tool to study the behaviour of a single magnetic sublattice that is also promising for magnetic sensory systems. The electrical and thermal generation of spin currents by the magnetized graphene grants the design of spin-logic devices without the need for magnetic injector and/or detector electrodes. This, together with the possibility for an efficient modulation of the spin-polarization of conductivity by electric fields via local (top) gates, allows for all-electric graphene-based spin-logic circuitries. These realizations, if accompanied with a large-scale growth of the vdW heterostructures and the development of the 2D magnets with a magnetic phase transition above room temperature, would lead to substantial advances in the 2D spintronics and spin-caloritronics technology.Anomalous Hall effect.
