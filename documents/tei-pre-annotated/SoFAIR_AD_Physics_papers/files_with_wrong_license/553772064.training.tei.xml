        <p>We study celestial chiral algebras appearing in celestial holography, using the light-cone gauge formulation of self-dual Yang-Mills theory and self-dual gravity, and explore also a deformation of the latter. The recently discussed w 1+∞ algebra in self-dual gravity arises from the soft expansion of an area-preserving diffeomorphism algebra, which plays the role of the kinematic algebra in the colour-kinematics duality and the double copy relation between the self-dual theories. The W 1+∞ deformation of w 1+∞ arises from a Moyal deformation of self-dual gravity. This theory is interpreted as a constrained chiral higher-spin gravity, where the field is a tower of higher-spin components fully constrained by the graviton component. In all these theories, the chiral structure of the operatorproduct expansion exhibits the colour-kinematics duality: the implicit 'left algebra' is the self-dual kinematic algebra, while the 'right algebra' provides the structure constants of the operator-product expansion, ensuring its associativity at tree level. In a scattering amplitudes version of the Ward conjecture, the left algebra ensures the classical integrability of this type of theories.

        <p>In recent years, a new understanding of asymptotic symmetries in quantum field theory and quantum gravity for asymptotically flat spacetimes has been developed, starting with a connection to soft theorems obeyed by scattering amplitudes [1][2][3]. This led to a renewed effort to understand holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes, particularly in 4D, based on the interpretation of scattering amplitudes as 2D CFT correlation functions on the celestial sphere, as reviewed in [4][5][6][7].

Since this algebra is related to the behaviour of amplitudes in a collinear limit, and this behaviour is unaltered at loop level in the self-dual sector, the conclusion extends to quantum selfdual gravity [15].

        <p>Our aproach reveals a strong connection between celestial operator-product expansions (OPEs) and the topic of the double copy, which relates most notably Yang-Mills theory and gravity, but extends to a wide range of theories. The double copy has received much attention over the past decade or so, mainly due to its applications, from the structure of superstring perturbation theory to the calculation of observables in gravitational wave JHEP01(2023)092 physics; see e.g. [28][29][30][31] for recent reviews, and [32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41] for works motivated by celestial holography. The self-dual theories provide the simplest known setting for the double copy, by manifestly obeying the symmetry known as colour-kinematic duality [42,43]. As we will see, this is closely related to the chirality of the celestial OPEs, and to the (classical) integrability of the chiral sector. The associativity of the OPEs, which implies the Jacobi relation for the structure constants, is also related to the appearance of Jacobi relations in the colour-kinematics duality, as we will see in examples.Our aproach reveals a strong connection between celestial operator-product expansions (OPEs) and the topic of the double copy, which relates most notably Yang-Mills theory and gravity, but extends to a wide range of theories.

        <p>The paper is organised follows. We start by giving a brief introduction to the spacetime formulations of self-dual Yang-Mills theory and self-dual gravity in light-cone gauge in section 2. In the following sections, we discuss the relation between celestial chiral OPEs and the double copy structure of the self-dual theories. In section 3, we show how the first copy of the self-dual kinematic algebra underlying the colour-kinematics duality is related to the chirality of the OPEs, while the second copy (present in the gravity case) is related via a soft expansion to the w 1+∞ algebra. We also discuss in that section a Moyal deformation of self-dual gravity, which leads to the W 1+∞ algebra, and its connection to higher-spin theories. In section 4, we describe the role of the first copy of the self-dual kinematic algebra in the classical integrability of the chiral theories, from the point of view of vanishing tree-level scattering amplitudes. Finally, we briefly discuss the results in section 5, with an eye to assessing the role of the w 1+∞ algebra beyond the self-dual sector.The paper is organised follows.

        <p>SDYM and SDG are well-defined sectors of the complete 4D Yang-Mills theory and general relativity, obtained by restricting the interactions to the (+ + -) vertex. The usual actions for the full theories have a (++-) vertex, a (+--) vertex, and higher-point vertices of the type (+ + • • • --). In the standard Yang-Mills action, the only higher-point vertex is the 4-point vertex (+ + --). At tree level, the self-dual sector corresponds to helicity configurations where all external particles but one have positive helicity, in a convention where all external particles are defined as incoming (the momentum in the external legs goes into a Feynman diagram). The associated tree-level scattering amplitudes vanish, which is a sign of the classical integrability of the self-dual theories [49]. 2 The idea is that no amplitude can be consistent with the infinite tower of symmetries underlying integrability. This is broken by quantum effects, which give rise to non-vanishing one-loop amplitudes, though the quantum self-dual theories are still very simple. It is not possible to draw a Feynman diagram with more than one loop using the Feynman rules above, which means that the self-dual theories are one-loop exact. Moreover, one-loop diagrams require all external particles to have positive helicity. This is the self-dual sector of the full theories at loop level. The one-loop all-positive-helicity amplitudes turn out to be rational functions of the external kinematic data [57,58]. So the self-dual theories may be considered to be the simplest 4D theories with non-trivial amplitudes. It is important to notice, though, that self-dual Yang-Mills fields and metrics are complex in (1,3) spacetime signature; the theories are clearly not parity invariant.

We do not claim that this is an essentially new derivation: the relation between w 1+∞ and area-preserving diffeomorphisms has a long history [70,71], and the connection to SDG has been explored before, e.g. in the context of twistor theory [72][73][74][75][76], as recently reviewed in [16]. In that reference, an explicit celestial realisation of w 1+∞ based on twistor space was presented.

        <p>We expect that the role of the w 1+∞ algebra in the full gravity theory is a counterpart of the role of the kinematic algebra associated to the (+ + -) vertex: it rules the self-dual sector of the theory, and also some kinematic limits of the full theory that highlight this vertex as in the collinear limit considered above, but the structure of the full theory is much more intricate. In fact, we believe that an indication of the sophistication of the full theory is the difficulty in understanding the general kinematic algebra underlying the colour-kinematics duality, which generalises (2.9) beyond the self-dual sector.

        <p>Here, we want to propose an additional interpretation of the equations of Moyaldeformed self-dual gravity, that connects it to a theory of higher spins. The first clues are in the two Lie algebras at play in (3.18). The 'left algebra' is generated by L k and carries spin 1, since L k ∼ + • ∂. The 'right algebra' is generated by L M k and carries contributions from a tower of odd spins, each ∼ ( + • ∂) spin , all of which have fixed coefficient with respect to the spin 1 contribution. This suggests that the double copy between the two algebras can be associated to a constrained chiral higher-spin theory with even spins ≥ 2. By JHEP01(2023)092 constrained, we mean that there are no more degrees of freedom than in SDG, since the higher spins are fixed by the graviton. 9 Such an interpretation of the theory is consistent with the general picture of chiral higher-spin theories [25][26][27], reviewed recently in [83].

However, the 2D quantisation of the algebra is not the same as the quantisation of the 4D spacetime field theory and, therefore, not the same as the quantisation of the 2D celestial theory, at least not in an obvious sense. Indeed, we discussed in this section the appearance of W 1+∞ in a purely classical deformation of SDG, given in light-cone gauge by higher-derivative corrections.

        <p>In this paper, we drew a connection between the double copy, especially its formulation in terms of the BCJ colour-kinematics duality, and the structure of the celestial chiral OPEs. The double copy decomposition of these OPEs is as follows: the 'left copy' comes from the implicit area-preserving diffeomorphism algebra arising solely from the OPE chirality; the 'right copy' comes from the structure constants of the OPE, which at least in the examples considered were identified with BCJ-type structure constants of a colour/kinematic algebra.In this paper, we drew a connection between the double copy, especially its formulation in terms of the BCJ colour-kinematics duality, and the structure of the celestial chiral OPEs.

        <p>Our investigations were partly motivated by the celestial appearance of (the wedge subalgebra of) w 1+∞ following refs. [13,14]. We discussed how this algebra arises straightforwardly from the soft expansion of the self-dual kinematic algebra appearing in the 'right copy' of the double copy decomposition of self-dual gravity. This point of view is a spacetime counterpart to old and recent work that describes self-dual gravity in twistor space [16]. Following the same approach, we described the deformation of w 1+∞ into W 1+∞ associated to a Moyal deformation of self-dual gravity. It would be good to connect this result to those of [17,19,23], and more generally, to understand the space of consistent deformations and its relevance.Our investigations were partly motivated by the celestial appearance of (the wedge subalgebra of) w 1+∞ following refs.

        <p>One important question is what role w 1+∞ plays in the full theory, i.e. beyond the self-dual sector. It may be worth it to put this question into the more general context of 'chiral' and 'non-chiral' approaches to scattering amplitudes in four spacetime dimensions. The following is by no means an exhaustive survey, but it may benefit some readers less familiar with these topics.One important question is what role w 1+∞ plays in the full theory, i.e. beyond the self-dual sector.

        <p>• Non-chiral (parity-symmetric) approaches: the chiral and anti-chiral sectors appear on equal footing. This is the case for the standard Yang-Mills theory and gravity Lagrangians, where we have both the (+, +, -) and the (-, -, +) vertices, complemented by higher-point vertices required by gauge invariance. The 'distance' from the chiral/anti-chiral sectors may be measured by the number of vertices beyond that sector required by a given object, say an amplitude with certain helicities.

For instance, the colour-kinematics duality for the MHV sector essentially inherits the self-dual kinematic algebra [42,43]. Generically, the further an object is from both the chiral and anti-chiral sectors, the more complicated it is. This holds irrespective of the formulation, say irrespective of the use of vertices, as in the BCFW recursion relation, where the basic building blocks are the two types of 3-point amplitude [99,100]. An approach that provides a beautiful symmetric splitting between the chiral and anti-chiral sectors of amplitudes is the 4D ambitwistor string [101], but the explicit construction of the complete amplitude is still not straightforward, due to the sum over solutions to the polarised scattering equations.

        <p>• Chiral approaches: the theories are formulated in an 'almost chiral' manner, where a systematic expansion away from the chiral sector is achieved by the introduction of non-chiral elements. A basic example is the CSW recursion [105] born out of twistor string theory [97]. Here, 'MHV vertices' are added to the self-dual theory to provide non-vanishing tree amplitudes of any MHV degree desired [106]; the more of these vertices are used, the higher the MHV degree, and the more complicated is the result. Various twistor space approaches, naturally tuned to the self-dual sector, fall into this class; see [16,21,107] for recent examples. For instance, in the case of [21], the tree-level amplitudes are computed as a type of form factor, where the external particles are represented by elements of a celestial chiral OPE, and the operator in the form factor is analogous to the CSW MHV vertices. A very different instance of chirality arises in the ambitwistor string [108], even in the 4D case mentioned above. This is the chirality of the worldsheet model (in contrast with conventional string theory). Here too, the worldsheet model is chiral except for the insertion of vertex operators which introduce localised non-chirality, and which are associated to the scattering equations.• Chiral approaches: the theories are formulated in an 'almost chiral' manner, where a systematic expansion away from the chiral sector is achieved by the introduction of non-chiral elements.

        <p>The preceding discussions in this paper suggest that the importance of the algebra w 1+∞ in the chiral sector does not extend straightforwardly to the full celestial theory, because there is a price to pay as one deviates from this classically integrable sector. We saw that this algebra results from the soft expansion of the self-dual kinematic algebra, which explains the colour-kinematics duality in the self-dual sector but not in general. MHV amplitudes inherit much of the structure of the self-dual theory, and the self-dual kinematic algebra still explains the colour-kinematics duality in this next-to-self-dual sector. For these and other reasons, it is natural to investigate the role of w 1+∞ starting from the MHV sector. However, the difficulty in finding a fully satisfactory description of the complete BCJ kinematic algebra (beyond MHV) is probably a good measure of the sophistication required of a parent algebra of w 1+∞ that applies to the full theory. In fact, it is not inconceivable that the answer to both questions is the same in some form.The preceding discussions in this paper suggest that the importance of the algebra w 1+∞ in the chiral sector does not extend straightforwardly to the full celestial theory, because there is a price to pay as one deviates from this classically integrable sector.

        <p>Notice that the (+ + -) vertex also gives rise to a chiral OPE for mixed helicities in the self-dual theories, e.g.O+(k1) O-(k2) ∼ X(k 1 ,k 2 ) z 1 -z 2O-(k1 + k2).
