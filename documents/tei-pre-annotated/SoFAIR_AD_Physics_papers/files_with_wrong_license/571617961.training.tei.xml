        <p>Introduction.-The study of quantum dynamics is at the heart of uncovering any fundamental principles of nature. From various points of view, in condensed matter physics, mathematical physics, and quantum field theory, such explorations have established the study of symmetries as an essential "backbone" of quantum systems. It thus comes as a genuine surprise in the past year where a dramatic extension to symmetries in 4D quantum field theories (QFTs) were uncovered, which unlike ordinary ones that form groups, obey fusionlike composition laws. These noninvertible symmetries are well established in d ¼ 2, 3, however, they are unexpected in d ≥ 4. Within the past year various systematic approaches to the construction of noninvertible symmetries have appeared in [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. Physical implications include characterization of deconfining or confining vacua and constraints on pion decays [8,9], and other applications appeared in [8][9][10][11][12][13][14].Introduction.-The study of quantum dynamics is at the heart of uncovering any fundamental principles of nature.

        <p>All constructions thus far rely on field theory methods. Here we provide the holographic perspective from symmetry inflow, supergravity, and branes. Other preliminary aspects of holography and noninvertible symmetries have been recently studied in [14][15][16]. Fundamental for the holographic construction is the symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) [17][18][19][20], which naturally arises in brane and holographic setups from the anomaly polynomial and inflow [21][22][23][24][25]. The SymTFT on W dþ1 encodes the full symmetry structure-the background fields for global symmetries and their 't Hooft anomalies-of a QFT on W d ¼ ∂W dþ1 . When placed on a slab with boundaries W d and M d and gapped boundary condition on M d , the SymTFT reduces to the anomaly theory of the QFT.All constructions thus far rely on field theory methods.

        <p>In this Letter, we propose a holographic derivation of the SymTFT, as well as the study of the resulting symmetriesincluding noninvertible ones-that depend on said boundary conditions. We derive the SymTFT by descent from the anomaly polynomial in d þ 2 dimensions, which is encoded in the supergravity. Motivated by the work on BFtype theories in [26], the Hamiltonian quantization of the SymTFT on W dþ1 allows us to extract Gauss's law constraints that generate gauge symmetry transformations. Under inflow, the bulk gauge symmetry restricts to the global symmetries of the boundary theory and the bulk generators flow to the desired symmetry operators. This is complemented by a realization of the symmetry generators in terms of D-branes and their world-volume theories. The bulk supergravity fields, which define the symmetries, pull back on the brane world-volume theories. In addition, the D-branes also contribute topological sectors that dress the symmetry defect, while the kinetic terms of the brane action drop out at the boundary. These defects become noninvertible depending on the boundary conditions for the bulk fields. The brane setup and its dynamics towards the boundary provide a compelling holographic interpretation for the noninvertible fusion via the Myers effect of Dp-branes into a single Dðp þ 2Þ-brane, which in turn implements the noninvertible fusion.In this Letter, we propose a holographic derivation of the SymTFT, as well as the study of the resulting symmetriesincluding noninvertible ones-that depend on said boundary conditions.

        <p>We demonstrate our proposal in the Klebanov-Strassler solution, that is dual to a flow to confining pure N ¼ 1 SUðMÞ Super-Yang Mills (SYM) [27,28]. Global properties of the gauge group can be identified in holography as in [29] and the study of holographic confinement using the 't Hooft anomalies of higher-form symmetries was carried out in [30]. In this Letter, we determine a framework to construct all symmetries in this setup, in particular, the noninvertible symmetries in the PSUðMÞ ¼ SUðMÞ=Z M theory, which map between deconfining or confining vacua when spontaneously broken. In the brane picture the noninvertible fusion is naturally encoded in the Myers effect on D-branes [31]. Furthermore, the deconfining or confining transition is beautifully modeled by the Hanany-Witten brane transition [32], Fig. 1.

This is in fact expected from tachyon condensation of the D-Dbar system [40], which needs to preserve the charge under db 1 , and thus is expected to give rise to a nontrivial condensate. This will be discussed elsewhere, and shown to correspond to a mesh of D3-branes.</p>

The system in ( 16) is related to the original Hanany-Witten setup NS5-D5-D3 by S and T dualities. The D3-and D5-branes link in the direction x 3 , this means that an F1 is created when the D3 crosses the D5 (16). F1 strings are indeed electrically charged under e -2πi H b 2 , which was precisely the dressing for O 2 ðM 2 Þ. This also matches the physics of the action on the 't Hooft loop in PSUðMÞ through a noninvertible domain wall between deconfining or confining vacua, that mimics closely the order or disorder transition in the Ising model.The localized source is the effect of a new object (an F1-string) that is created, which intersects both M 2 and M 3 and extends along t ¼ x 0 ; x 3 , Fig. 1.

        <p>Outlook.-We provide a bottom-up approach-via Gauss law constraints in supergravity-and top-down one-via branes in string theory-for constructing symmetry operators in holography. Our methods are crucial for a systematic extraction of symmetry defects, whenever SymTFTs are available. It deserves further study. Future applications include theories that have a similar type of mixed anomalies in the SymTFT, such as N ¼ 4 SYM theories holographically dual to AdS 5 × S 5 with noninvertible duality defects [2,13]. A similar realization of these topological defects in terms of M5-branes at the boundary of conical in G 2 -holonomy spaces is also tempting, and show similar features to (16). Finally, we also briefly comment on the holographic realization of the (self-) duality and triality of noninvertible topological defects [4] for N ¼ 4 SYM in AdS 5 × S 5 . Duality and triality are all subgroups of SLð2; ZÞ symmetries, therefore is very tempting to conjecture that the topological defects in this case are engineered by 7-branes wrapping S 5 . These are just examples of possible applications of this approach, which we plan to come back to in the future, but very importantly they show the broader scope of the holographic supergravity and brane approach, which are meant to address questions about symmetries of the QFTs living at the boundary.Outlook.-We provide a bottom-up approach-via Gauss law constraints in supergravity-and top-down one-via branes in string theory-for constructing symmetry operators in holography.
