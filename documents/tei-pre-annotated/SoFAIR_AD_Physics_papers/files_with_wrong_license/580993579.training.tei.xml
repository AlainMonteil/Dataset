        <p>The ultrarelativistic flow speeds of the jets of some active galactic nuclei (AGNs) strongly affect their observed characteristics through beaming, aberration, and light-travel delays. These physical effects cause the illusion of apparent superluminal motion, greatly enhanced flux densities, and reduced timescales of variability of flux and polarization (e.g., Blandford et al. 1977). Blazars (Angel &amp; Stockman 1980), with their jet directions oriented nearly along our line of sight (e.g., Lister et al. 2016), exhibit the most extreme characteristics of all AGNs. The extraordinary resolution afforded by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) enables detailed studies of the inner jets of AGNs on distance scales from &lt;1 to &gt;100 pc from the central supermassive black hole. Monitoring programs over at least a decade are able to (1) systematically characterize the long-term variability of the parsec-scale jet, including knot motions, jet wobbling, and precession; (2) reveal the connection between multiwavelength outbursts and multimessenger events in the jet; and (3) provide an observational basis for theoretical models of jet formation, acceleration, and collimation.The ultrarelativistic flow speeds of the jets of some active galactic nuclei (AGNs) strongly affect their observed characteristics through beaming, aberration, and light-travel delays.

        <p>Most blazar jets feature "knots" of emission that travel away from a (presumed stationary) "core" at apparent speeds that range from 1c to 50c (e.g., Lister et al. 2016;Jorstad et al. 2017). In a number of blazars, the jets are observed (in projection) to undergo rapid swings of position angle in their innermost regions, but remain collimated on kiloparsec scales (for a review of several sources, see Agudo 2009). The projected jet position angles can vary considerably (by up to 150°over a 12-16 yr time span; Lister et al. 2013). Monotonic swings with no apparent periodicity ("wobbles") have been reported in some objects (e.g., Jorstad et al. 2004;Agudo et al. 2007Agudo et al. , 2012)), while precession (sinusoidal variations) has been claimed in others (e.g., Stirling et al. 2003;Bach et al. 2005;Lobanov &amp; Roland 2005;Savolainen et al. 2006;Marti-Vidal et al. 2013;Britzen et al. 2018Britzen et al. , 2019)). The origin of the wobbles and precession is not well understood, but the presence of such changes in only the innermost (parsec-scale) regions of the jet implies that the causal mechanisms are related to the origin of the jet, e.g., accretion disk precession (e.g., McHardy et al. 1990;Conway &amp; Wrobel 1995;Villata &amp; Raiteri 1999;Britzen et al. 2005Britzen et al. , 2017;;Perucho et al. 2012;Fromm et al. 2013;Larionov et al. 2013;Raiteri et al. 2017Raiteri et al. , 2021)), instabilities in the jet flow (e.g., Nakamura et al. 2001;Moll et al. 2008;Mignone et al. 2010;Liska et al. 2018), or interactions in a binary supermassive black hole system (e.g., Britzen et al. 2018;Qian et al. 2019).Most blazar jets feature "knots" of emission that travel away from a (presumed stationary) "core" at apparent speeds that range from 1c to 50c (e.g., Lister et al. 2016;Jorstad et al. 2017).

        <p>In order to understand the physical processes in blazars, it is important to relate changes observed in the radio jet to multiwavelength variability and outbursts. Connections between the high-energy emission and radio jets of AGNs have been theorized for ∼40 yr (e.g., Königl 1981;Marscher 1987), with observational evidence provided by joint radio and γ-ray studies, the latter based on data from the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (Hartman et al. 1999). The results have highlighted the dichotomy between blazar subclasses. In the traditional AGN unification scheme (Urry &amp; Padovani 1995), flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lac objects) are differentiated by their optical properties and radio morphology (e.g., Wardle et al. 1984). During the Compton era, FSRQs were found to have higher γ-ray fluxes when they also exhibited high optical polarization and a high-radio-frequency outburst (Valtaoja &amp; Terasranta 1995). There was no similarly clear correlation between the γ-ray emission in BL Lac objects and their radio variations (Lähteenmäki &amp; Valtaoja 2003). For both subtypes, however, there existed a correlation between the brightness of the radio "core" and γ-ray flux (Jorstad et al. 2001b), as well as a connection between the ejections of superluminal radio knots and γ-ray outbursts (Jorstad et al. 2001a).In order to understand the physical processes in blazars, it is important to relate changes observed in the radio jet to multiwavelength variability and outbursts.

        <p>The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has ushered in a new era of γ-ray-radio studies. Individual sources show a wide variety of behavior during major γ-ray events. The typical duration of a high γ-ray state in blazars is several months (Williamson et al. 2014), although shorter-timescale fluctuations are often observed (e.g., Agudo et al. 2011a;Weaver et al. 2019Weaver et al. , 2020)). The majority of these γ-ray and very-high-energy (100 GeV) outbursts can be connected with the propagation of a knot through the core or other quasi-stationary components in the parsec-scale radio jet (e.g., Marscher et al. 2010;Agudo et al. 2011a;Casadio et al. 2015;Liodakis et al. 2020;H. E. S. S. Collaboration et al. 2021;MAGIC Collaboration et al. 2021). Two major issues exist with this model for blazar flares: the presence of "orphan" γ-ray flares (e.g., Krawczynski et al. 2004;MacDonald et al. 2015) with no counterparts at longer wavelengths, and the need for an intense external photon field at these locations in the jet (e.g., Aleksić et al. 2011;Joshi et al. 2014), the source of which is unknown. Emission-line flares with short time delays relative to the γ-ray outburst have also been observed in several blazars (León-Tavares et al. 2013;Larionov et al. 2020;Hallum et al. 2022), which could provide additional seed photons (Isler et al. 2015;León-Tavares et al. 2015;Larionov et al. 2020). Detection of a 290 TeV neutrino with a direction of origin coincident with the flaring blazar TXS 0506+056 (IceCube Collaboration et al. 2018a, 2018b), suggests an association between flaring blazars and high-energy neutrinos (e.g., Murase et al. 2018;Rodrigues et al. 2018). Thus, blazar jets may produce high-energy hadronic cosmic-rays (e.g., Keivani et al. 2018;Cerruti et al. 2019) alongside electromagnetic outbursts and changes in the parsec-scale structure (for discussion of the parsec-scale jet of TXS 0506+056, see Li et al. 2020).The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has ushered in a new era of γ-ray-radio studies.

        <p>VLBI observations can also provide constraints on theoretical models of AGN jet launching, acceleration, and collimation, which are challenging to model. The launching mechanism in AGNs can be ascribed to one (or both) of two processes. The Blandford-Znajek mechanism (Blandford &amp; Znajek 1977) utilizes the rotational energy of the black hole, with the spin of the black hole winding up the magnetic field lines anchored to the event horizon, resulting in a relativistic Poynting flux dominated jet (e.g., Beskin &amp; Kuznetsova 2000;Komissarov 2001Komissarov , 2005;;Tchekhovskoy et al. 2010). Alternatively, magnetic field lines anchored to the accretion disk can launch mildly relativistic mass-dominated winds (Blandford &amp; Payne 1982). One of the primary goals of VLBI monitoring programs of blazar jets is to provide an observational framework for comparing numerical simulations of jets (e.g., Vlahakis &amp; Königl 2003;Komissarov 2005;Lyubarsky 2009;Meier 2012;Pu et al. 2015;Chatterjee et al. 2019) with the actual parsec-scale behavior.VLBI observations can also provide constraints on theoretical models of AGN jet launching, acceleration, and collimation, which are challenging to model.

        <p>A number of observing programs follow time changes in the jets of a large number of blazars. The largest has monitored several hundred of the brightest AGNs in the northern sky, first under the 2 cm VLBA survey (Kellermann et al. 1998), and later as part of the 
            <rs type="software">MOJAVE</rs>
            <rs type="version">7</rs> program. Lister et al. (2019) found that 60% of the 409 monitored sources exhibit acceleration of emission features in the jet. Other than a few outliers, the 15 GHz emission features have a distribution of apparent velocities that fall within ±40% of the median speed of a given source. No jet features are reported to have a bulk Lorentz factor Γ &gt; 50. Through Monte Carlo modeling of the parent population, the authors show that the data are consistent with a jet population that has a simple unbeamed power-law luminosity function incorporating pure luminosity evolution, and a power-law Lorentz factor distribution ranging from 1.25 to 50, with a slope -1.4 ± 0.2.

        <p>The Boston University group and its collaborators have been monitoring blazar jets with the VLBA at 43 GHz since 1993. The research focuses on the connection between jet properties and multiwavelength behavior. This includes analysis of events in the jets of γ-ray blazars during the Compton era (Jorstad et al. 2001b), accretion disk-jet associations (Marscher et al. 2002;Chatterjee et al. 2011), and relations between optical and millimeter-wave linear polarization (Jorstad et al. 2005). Over the past 10 yr, we have been monitoring the jet kinematics of a sample of 38 blazars at a roughly monthly cadence at 43 GHz under the VLBA-BU-BLAZAR program. 8 For comparison with the longer-wavelength data, we obtain well-sampled γ-ray light curves from the Fermi LAT. The higher observing frequency relative to other VLBA monitoring programs allows emission features to be tracked closer to the "core" of the sources. Also, the more frequent monitoring allows faster, shorter-lived features to be observed. Based on the first 5 yr of data, we found that nearly one-third of moving knots show evidence of acceleration in the jet (Jorstad et al. 2017). Furthermore, knots in FSRQs tend to have higher Doppler and Lorentz factors, with smaller viewing and opening angles, than the knots in BL Lac objects and radio galaxies (RGs). A number of radio jet-γ-ray event associations have been detected using these data (Marscher et al. 2010;Agudo et al. 2011aAgudo et al. , 2011b;;Wehrle et al. 2012;Jorstad et al. 2013;Jorstad &amp; Marscher 2016;Casadio et al. 2015;Larionov et al. 2020;H.

        <p>In this paper, we provide the data and detailed analyses of the parsec-scale jet behavior of a sample of γ-ray bright AGNs over our decade-long monitoring program, VLBA-BU-BLA-ZAR. We implement a new piecewise linear fitting method to determine the jet kinematics. For consistency, we reanalyze previously published data to produce a uniform data set that covers the first 10.5 yr of VLBA monitoring associated with Fermi LAT observations, 2007 June to 2018 December. The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we detail the observations, their calibration, and analysis from 2013 January through 2018 December, and describe the piecewise fitting of the core-knot separations versus time that we apply to all of the data. The data for individual knots and sources are available in Tables 2 and3. The parsec-scale jet structure and the behavior of the jet position angle with time (Table 7) of each source are discussed in Section 3. Section 4 describes the moving/ stationary features (Tables 8 and9) and accelerations (Table 10) of all knots in our sample. We determine the statistically robust physical parameters of knots in our sample in Section 5 (Table 12), and provide estimates for the "typical" physical parameters of each jet (Table 13). We briefly discuss connections between millimeter-wave and γ-ray states of the AGNs in Section 6. A summary of our findings is given in Section 7. Throughout this work, we assume a standard Λ cold dark matter cosmology with rounded values of cosmological parameters based on those obtained by the Planck collaboration (Planck Collaboration et al. 2020), the results from type Ia supernova studies (Riess et al. 2016), and VLT-KMOS data (González-Morán et al. 2021): H • = 70 km s -1 Mpc -1 , Ω m = 0.3, and Ω Λ = 0.7.In this paper, we provide the data and detailed analyses of the parsec-scale jet behavior of a sample of γ-ray bright AGNs over our decade-long monitoring program, VLBA-BU-BLA-ZAR.

        <p>As part of the VLBA-BU-BLAZAR monitoring program, we have obtained roughly monthly observations with the VLBA at 43 GHz (7 mm wavelength) of a sample of AGNs detected as γ-ray sources. The results of the observations from 2007 June to 2013 January have been presented in Jorstad et al. (2017). In this work, we extend the analyzed period with observations obtained from 2013 January through 2018 December, bringing the total monitoring period to 10.5 yr.

        <p>The sample studied here consists of a total of 38 sources, of which 22 are FSRQs, 13 are BL Lac objects, and three are RGs. Each source has been detected at γ-ray energies by the Fermi LAT (Abdo et al. 2010;Acero et al. 2015), with an average flux density at 43 GHz exceeding 0.5 Jy, a decl. north of -30°, and an optical magnitude in the R band brighter than 18 5. The original sample is described in Jorstad et al. (2017). Several additional sources that have been revealed to have occasionally strong γ-ray flux (as observed with the Fermi-LAT) and sufficiently high optical flux to meet the selection criteria have been included in the current sample.The sample studied here consists of a total of 38 sources, of which 22 are FSRQs, 13 are BL Lac objects, and three are RGs.

        <p>The observations of the sample were performed roughly monthly via dynamical scheduling, over a 24 hr period at each epoch, using all available VLBA antennas. (At some epochs, 1-2 antennas could not collect data owing to technical problems or weather conditions.) A total of 32 or 33 objects were observed during each epoch, with 40-45 minutes integration time per source (8-9 scans of ∼5 minutes duration), spread over the 6-10 hr time span with the optimal visibility of the object. Eight sources were observed during alternating sessions; these objects are in crowded R.A. ranges and exhibit relatively long timescales of variability of the jet structure at 43 GHz. Although the observations and data processing were carried out in a similar manner as in Jorstad et al. (2017), with the latter using the Astronomical Image Processing System (AIPS; van Moorsel et al. 1996), some details were different. A new data recording system (Mark5C) was installed, allowing a data recording rate of 2048 Mb per second, as opposed to the previous rate of 512 Mb per second. The resulting increase in data quality allows a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio to be achieved without averaging intermediate frequency bands (IFs). Thus, since 2014 February, the final calibrated data available on the project website include visibilities at four IFs (centered at 43. 0075, 43.0875, 43.1515, and43.2155 GHz). We have calibrated the instrumental polarization separately for each IF.The observations of the sample were performed roughly monthly via dynamical scheduling, over a 24 hr period at each epoch, using all available VLBA antennas.

Although the observations and data processing were carried out in a similar manner as in Jorstad et al. (2017), with the latter using the Astronomical Image Processing System (AIPS; van Moorsel et al. 1996), some details were different. A new data recording system (Mark5C) was installed, allowing a data recording rate of 2048 Mb per second, as opposed to the previous rate of 512 Mb per second. The resulting increase in data quality allows a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio to be achieved without averaging intermediate frequency bands (IFs). Thus, since 2014 February, the final calibrated data available on the project website include visibilities at four IFs (centered at 43. 0075, 43.0875, 43.1515, and43.2155 GHz). We have calibrated the instrumental polarization separately for each IF.</p>

        <p>The parsec-scale jet morphology of blazars features a "core" (e.g., Jorstad et al. 2001bJorstad et al. , 2005Jorstad et al. , 2017;;Kellermann et al. 2004;Lister et al. 2013Lister et al. , 2018)), an assumed stationary feature located at the upstream end of the jet seen in the VLBI images. For most sources, the core is usually the brightest feature in the jet (Jorstad et al. 2017), but sometimes in some blazars an emission component downstream of the core can be more prominent (e.g., 2251+158; Jorstad et al. 2001b). The exact location of this core relative to the central black hole is frequency dependent as the core represents the region where the jet becomes optically thick at a given frequency, with VLBI at higher frequencies being able to image closer to the black hole (see, e.g., O'Sullivan &amp; Gabuzda 2009;Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2019). One or more "knots" of emission are often observed downstream of the core (e.g., Jorstad et al. 2001b). Some of these are quasi-stationary, without systematic motions relative to the core, while others move down the jet, in most cases at apparent superluminal speeds (e.g., Cohen et al. 1971Cohen et al. , 1977;;Jorstad et al. 2001bJorstad et al. , 2017;;Lister et al. 2018).The parsec-scale jet morphology of blazars features a "core" (e.g., Jorstad et al. 2001bJorstad et al. , 2005Jorstad et al. , 2017;;Kellermann et al. 2004;Lister et al. 2013Lister et al. , 2018)), an assumed stationary feature located at the upstream end of the jet seen in the VLBI images.

        <p>In order to represent the total intensity structure of each source at each epoch, we model the frequency-averaged visibility data with a series of circular Gaussian components that best fit the data. The model fitting involves iterations of the 
            <rs type="software">MODELFIT</rs> task within the 
            <rs type="software">Difmap</rs> (Shepherd 1997) software package. We use the term "knot" to refer to these Gaussian components, which correspond to a (usually) compact feature of enhanced brightness in the jet. Initially, a single circular Gaussian component approximating the brightness distribution of the core is used, then knots are added at the approximate locations of bright features identified in the image. Each addition of a knot is followed by hundreds of iterations with 
            <rs type="software">MODELFIT</rs> to determine the parameters of the knot that yield the best agreement between the model and uv data, according to a χ 2 test. The knot parameters that we fit are: S-flux density; R obs -distance with respect to the core; Θ obs -relative position angle (P.A.) with respect to the core, measured north through east; and a-the angular size of the knot, corresponding to the FWHM of the circular Gaussian component. The iterative process of adding knots is ended when the addition of a new knot does not significantly improve the χ 2 value of the model. Often, the model of a previous epoch is used as the starting model for the next epoch for a given source, as we assume that the jet does not drastically change structure between our roughly monthly observations. We utilize the previously published Difmap models of each source at each epoch from 2007 June to 2012 December (Jorstad et al. 2017). In this work we provide models for each source from 2013 January to 2018 December.

        <p>Previous studies (e.g., Homan et al. 2015;Jorstad et al. 2017) have found that a given knot can exhibit both acceleration and deceleration as it propagates down the jet. In order to describe the locations along the jet of such regions of changing velocity, we have created a new formalism for the calculation of kinematic parameters of a knot, utilizing piecewise linear fits to separation (from the core) versus time data instead of polynomial fits as used in Jorstad et al. (2017). This simplifies the calculation of kinematic parameters by describing the motion in terms of the mean velocity of each segment of time within which the velocity is roughly constant and significantly different from that of other segments. This allows us to estimate the distance down the jet at which acceleration occurs.

        <p>We define the piecewise fits in this work in terms of the number of line segments present for each coordinate of motion X and Y. A single-segment fit describes the simple linear case as defined above. A two-segment fit indicates that the motion can be described by two different speeds with a single acceleration region at a particular break point, t b , and a three-segment fit indicates three speeds and two acceleration regions and break points. In a two-segment fit, there are five free parameters, while in a three-segment fit, there are eight free parameters. A piecewise fit with the fewest number of segments for which 2 crit 2  c c is used to fit the data, where crit 2 c is the χ 2 value corresponding to a significance level of ζ = 0.05 for f = N -ℓ, where ℓ is the number of fit parameters. However, a two-segment fit is only used if N &gt; 8, and a three-segment fit is only used if N &gt; 15, given the number of degrees of freedom. In cases for which the χ 2 criterion is not reached for even a threesegment piecewise fit, we use the simplest fit that adequately describes the data (χ 2 closest to crit 2 c ). There are only several such cases. In some cases, the X and Y motion break points can overlap in time, generally defined as |t b,Xt b,Y | 0.25 yr. In these situations we average t b,X and t b,Y and use this average time as a single break point. The model fit is then re-run with the break times frozen to the averaged values. The overlap value of 0.25 yr was chosen because in any time interval Δt = 0.25 yr, our roughly monthly observations will lead to only two or three observations within the time interval so that a calculation of the speed of such a segment is unreliable. The uncertainties of all best-fit parameters are calculated from the diagonals of the covariance matrices of the fits. 2. Calculation of the Epoch of Ejection, t • : The epoch of ejection is defined as the time when the centroid of a knot coincides with the centroid of the core, with the knot motion extrapolated back to (X, Y) = (0, 0). In general, all observations of the motion of a knot are important for calculating its kinematic parameters. However, for determining t • , the most important observations are when the knot is closest to the core, before any potential acceleration. We thus extrapolate the linear fits to X and Y back to (0, 0) from the first identified break point (or use the first ten observations of a knot in the case of no acceleration). This extrapolation provides the time of ejection along each coordinate, t , where the subscript j indicates the number of the line segment. As the motion in each coordinate X and Y can be described independently by up to three linear segments, the maximum range of j = 1, 2, K,5. We arrange the break points chronologically. 4. Calculation of Apparent Accelerations: If j ≠ 1, there is a change in the speed and direction of motion of the knot over time as it moves down the jet. In the case of two or more line segments, we define a region in time between the mid-points of the line segments as the "acceleration region," Δt. While the acceleration may occur over a shorter or longer time period than this midpoint definition, using the mid-points of a segment to determine Δt characterizes the acceleration without a priori knowledge of the cause of acceleration.

        <p>A direct comparison of the distributions for each subclass presented in Figure 3 (as with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov, K-S, test) would ignore two crucial aspects of the data: (1) that the brightness temperature values for the cores and the knots of a particular object in our sample are correlated by virtue of coming from the same source, rather than being an independent measurement from a random blazar, and (2) the relatively large number (in some cases, ∼50%, e.g., the core of the BL Lac object 1959+650) of lower limits present in the sample. In order to compare the brightness temperatures of the cores and knots in our sample between each subclass, we derive "typical" values for the brightness temperatures of components for each source by estimating the survival function of the brightness temperature of the cores and knots to get the median value (see the Appendix).A direct comparison of the distributions for each subclass presented in Figure 3 (as with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov, K-S, test) would ignore two crucial aspects of the data: (1) that the brightness temperature values for the cores and the knots of a particular object in our sample are correlated by virtue of coming from the same source, rather than being an independent measurement from a random blazar, and (2) the relatively large number (in some cases, ∼50%, e.g., the core of the BL Lac object 1959+650) of lower limits present in the sample.

        <p>Figure 4 (left) shows the median brightness temperatures of core components of blazars in our sample between 2013 January and 2018 December, while Figure 4 (right) shows the same for the entire observing period of the program (2007 June-2018 December). The three RGs in the sample have very similar median core brightness temperatures, ∼5 × 10 11 K. The distribution of the median T b,obs s for BL Lac objects is very wide spread, ranging from 10 10 K to ∼10 13 K. The cores of FSRQs (This table is available in its entirety in machine-readable form.) are more narrowly distributed around a central brightness temperature, ∼10 12 K.

        <p>Despite the low significance levels according to a K-S test (likely due to the number of sources in our sample), we see a general trend across the median core and knot brightness temperature distributions: FSRQs and BL Lac objects have more intense cores than those of RGs, but the knots in the extended jets of BL Lac objects are significantly less intense than the knots of RGs and FSRQs. A small fraction of analyzed knots are weak diffuse features with T 10 b,obs s 8 &lt; K.

        <p>With over 10 yr of observations, we can constrain the bulk characteristics of the jet, such as the average position angle, 〈Θ jet 〉, and its temporal evolution. Such constraints are important for determining whether there are sudden changes in the direction of the jet, or if precession is common in blazars. In addition, since the calculation of acceleration along or perpendicular to the jet axis depends on the position angle, such information can allow us to account for the effect of changes in Θ jet on the accelerations.With over 10 yr of observations, we can constrain the bulk characteristics of the jet, such as the average position angle, 〈Θ jet 〉, and its temporal evolution.

        <p>Between 2007 and 2018 we have identified 559 distinct emission features in the parsec-scale jets of the 38 blazars in the VLBA-BU-BLAZAR sample. Of this total number, 38 are the 43 GHz cores. Among the remaining knots, 96 have been classified as quasi-stationary (18.4% of noncore components), leaving 425 classified as moving knots. Accelerations along the jet cause 75 of the moving knots (17.6%) to have multiple estimates for their apparent speed as they traverse different regions along their trajectory. The only sources that do not exhibit apparent superluminal motion in the parsec-scale jet are the BL Lac objects 1652+398 and 1959+650.

We consider this estimate of the knot speed to be reliable, with multiple observations of its motion close to the core and a well-defined epoch of ejection.

        <p>Here we describe the properties of the moving features in the jets of sources in each of the three subclasses of blazars. Because knot C of the FSRQ 2251+158 (3C 454.3) shows motion despite being a quasi-stationary feature (see Section 4.2), we include it in the analysis of 426 moving knots. Since any individual knot can have multiple motions over different time periods, we analyze a total of 529 knot speeds. Table 8 presents the speeds of the moving knots as follows: 1-name of the source; 2-designation of the component; 3segment number of the fit to the knot motion, N seg (1 for purely linear motion in both the X and Y direction, up to 515 ); 4-start date of the segment, t s , in years; 5-end date of the segment, t e , in years; 6-proper motion, μ, and its associated 1σ uncertainty, in milliarcseconds per year; 7-direction of motion, Φ, and its associated 1σ uncertainty, in degrees; 8apparent speed, β app , and its associated 1σ uncertainty, in units of c; 9-epoch of ejection, t • , and its associated 1σ uncertainty (only available for the first segment of a knot) in years; and 10 -flag indicating whether t • was calculated to the combined X and Y dimension fit (XY), or if a fit to the R coordinate of the first segment was necessary (R, see Section 2.2).

        <p>Figure 8 (left) shows the distributions of the apparent speeds of the features for FSRQs, BL Lac objects, and RGs separately for the entire observing period from 2007 June to 2018 December for ease of comparison with previous literature. An increase in the number of moving knots by a factor of ∼3 has dramatically filled in the FSRQ and BL Lac object distributions over those presented in Jorstad et al. (2017). The main distribution of apparent speeds of features in the jets of FSRQs covers a wide range of β app , from 0.5c to ∼50c. Two knots (B1 of 0528+134 and D2 of 2230+114) have segments where the speed of the knot exceeds 50c. In order to limit the size of the figure, these have been included in the last bin. They represent a small percentage (0.6%) of the total number of knots and thus do not affect the conclusions. The FSRQ distribution peaks in the 8c-10c bin but has a very long tail, extending continuously with at least one knot in each bin up to the 38c-40c range. The apparent speeds in the jets of BL Lac objects exhibit a very different distribution, with a peak in the 0c-2c bin and a similarly sized peak in the 8c-10c bin. The distribution does not extend to β app as high as for FSRQs, with the maximum BL Lac object speed of ∼27c occurring for a segment of the knot B3 of 1749+096. The distribution of apparent speeds of RG knots is limited to much lower values than those of the other two subclasses. The peak between 4c and 6c corresponds to 0415+379 and 0430+052, with the peak from 0c to 2c coming primarily from 0316+413 (3C 84).Figure 8 (left) shows the distributions of the apparent speeds of the features for FSRQs, BL Lac objects, and RGs separately for the entire observing period from 2007 June to 2018 December for ease of comparison with previous literature. An increase in the number of moving knots by a factor of ∼3 has dramatically filled in the FSRQ and BL Lac object distributions over those presented in Jorstad et al. (2017). The main distribution of apparent speeds of features in the jets of FSRQs covers a wide range of β app , from 0.5c to ∼50c. Two knots (B1 of 0528+134 and D2 of 2230+114) have segments where the speed of the knot exceeds 50c. In order to limit the size of the figure, these have been included in the last bin. They represent a small percentage (0.6%) of the total number of knots and thus do not affect the conclusions. The FSRQ distribution peaks in the 8c-10c bin but has a very long tail, extending continuously with at least one knot in each bin up to the 38c-40c range. The apparent speeds in the jets of BL Lac objects exhibit a very different distribution, with a peak in the 0c-2c bin and a similarly sized peak in the 8c-10c bin. The distribution does not extend to β app as high as for FSRQs, with the maximum BL Lac object speed of ∼27c occurring for a segment of the knot B3 of 1749+096.

        <p>In order to more appropriately determine the differences in the distributions of apparent speed for FSRQs, BL Lac objects, and RGs, we calculate a single average apparent speed, 〈β app 〉, for each source as the weighted average of the apparent speeds of all knots in that source. The distributions of these average apparent speeds are shown in Figure 8 (right). We see that the FSRQs have a well-determined peak in the distribution with 〈β app 〉 ∼ 12-14c. The BL Lac objects have a very wide dispersion of average apparent speeds. With just three sources, it is easy to see (with Table 8) that the knots of 0316+413 are, on average, subluminal, while those of 0415+379 and 0430+052 are superluminal. Despite the small numbers of sources (especially for RGs), we have performed a K-S test between the distributions. The BL Lac object and RG distributions are the most similar, with  0.500 = and p = 0.525, likely due to the small number of sources. However, moderately significant differences are seen between the FSRQ:BL ( p 0.492, 0.029 = = ) and FSRQ:RG ( p 0.955, 0.003 = = ) distributions. Taking all of the results of Figure 8 into consideration, we see that the knots of FSRQs have, on average, higher apparent speeds than those of BL Lac objects, with RGs having the lowest apparent speeds.In order to more appropriately determine the differences in the distributions of apparent speed for FSRQs, BL Lac objects, and RGs, we calculate a single average apparent speed, 〈β app 〉, for each source as the weighted average of the apparent speeds of all knots in that source.

        <p>We analyze the direction of the velocity vector of each knot by following the same approach as in Jorstad et al. (2017), calculating the difference between the direction Φ of the apparent velocity (given in Table 8) and the average position angle of the jet, 〈Θ jet 〉 (listed in Table 3). Instead of determining an average value of this parameter for each source, we consider the difference between Φ and 〈Θ jet 〉 for a given knot to be an independent measure of the possible dispersion of the position angles for each subclass of blazar, as all knots are required to determine the width/dispersion of a jet. Figure 9 plots the distributions of |Φ -〈Θ jet 〉| for FSRQs, BL Lac objects, and RGs. The peak of each distribution lies within the first bin (&lt;10°) and represents 34.1%, 40.3%, and 74.7% of the total number of knots in FSRQs, BL Lac objects, and RGs, respectively.We analyze the direction of the velocity vector of each knot by following the same approach as in Jorstad et al.

BL Lac objects have the largest dispersion of knot motions, with 〈σ(Φ)〉 = 7°.2, while FSRQs and RGs have a dispersion 〈σ(Φ)〉 = 4°.2 and 4°.8, respectively. The much larger dispersion in this work compared to those presented in Jorstad et al. (2017) is likely caused by a significantly larger number of measured speeds based on the revised method for calculating motion. In order to determine whether this dispersion is from varying directions of the velocity vectors of knots or from knots smaller than the jet cross section being displaced from the jet axis by various distances, we calculate the average position angle dispersion of knots in a subclass as, where N k is the total number of knot speeds measured in each subclass.

        <p>Based on this, FSRQs have the widest range of average knot position angles, with 〈σ(〈Θ〉)〉 = 9°.9, while BL Lac objects and RGs have smaller dispersions of 8°.8 and 5°.7, respectively. We conclude that, while the knots of FSRQs are more inclined to move along the same direction in the jet than are the knots in the jets of BL Lac objects, FSRQs have wider projected opening angles. The latter can be connected with a smaller viewing angle and/or a wider intrinsic opening angle for FSRQs. FSRQs and BL Lac objects possess a similar percentage of knots in which the velocity vector deviates from the jet axis by a value between 30°and 60°, 12.5% and 14.4%, respectively. In contrast, only 2.5% of the knots of RGs have motions that fall within this deviation range.

        <p>We have identified 96 features with no statistically significant motion (as defined in Jorstad et al. 2017). Of these, 45 are in FSRQs, 38 in BL Lac objects, and 13 in RGs.

We classify this source as having a constant jet position angle according to our criterion (see the text and Lac objects ∼3 such features. Our sample size of RGs is small; however, we see seven and five stationary features in 0415 +379 and 0430+052, respectively. Given the subrelativistic speeds of knots in 0316+413, it is hard to determine which features are truly stationary. Almost half of the stationary features in our sample have appeared or disappeared over time, indicating that while these features may be stationary in position, they are often transient features over timescales of ∼10 yr. Given that there is no way to average the properties of stationary features for a particular source into one overarching "typical" stationary feature, we treat each stationary feature as an independent feature when making comparisons between the subclasses of blazars.

        <p>Despite the "stationary feature" classification, the brightness centroids of many of these components do exhibit distinguishable motion. The locations of the majority of features tend to fluctuate about their mean reported positions. Figure 10,right, shows three examples of the trajectories of stationary features, one in each subclass. The range of motion in both R.A. and decl. is larger than the positional errors can account for, and the loci of (X, Y) positions of a given stationary feature form a pattern that indicates a preferred direction of motion for the Q L-linear dependence, 〈Θ jet (t)〉 = a 1 * (tt ave ) + a 0 , where t ave is the midpoint of the observed period; and S-a spline fit of the third order, 〈Θ jet (t)〉 = spline(tt ave ).Despite the "stationary feature" classification, the brightness centroids of many of these components do exhibit distinguishable motion.

        <p>In this characterization of the knot motion dispersion, ϖ represents the angle of the motion along the major axis. We compare this direction of motion with the direction of the jet through |ϖ -〈Θ jet 〉|, as defined in Table 7. For sources with 〈Θ jet 〉 fit by a linear trend or a spline, we average the trend over the dates of observation of the particular stationary feature. Figure 11, left, shows the distributions of this difference angle separately for FSRQs, BL Lac objects, and RGs. A K-S test between the distributions indicates that there is no statistical difference between the subclasses, with the FSRQ and BL Lac object distributions being the most similar ( 0.162 = , p = 0.578), while  0. Figure 11 shows the divisions between parallel and oblique cases with red dotted lines, while the division between oblique and transverse fluctuations is shown with blue dotted lines. In FSRQs, 40% (18/45) of knots fluctuate along the jet direction, 26.7% (12/45) oblique to the jet, and 33.3% (15/45) transverse to the jet. The situation is similar for BL Lac objects: 44.7% (17/38), 26.3% (10/38), and 28.9% (11/38), respectively. This is supported by the K-S test, which indicates that the FSRQ and BL Lac object distributions are not significantly different. The RG distribution, however, shows a clear preference for motions along the jet direction, with 11 of the 13 knots (92%) moving predominately along the jet direction. While the number of RG stationary features has increased over those detected in Jorstad et al. (2017), there are still only a relatively small number of such knots, so that the K-S test is inconclusive.In this characterization of the knot motion dispersion, ϖ represents the angle of the motion along the major axis.

        <p>Almost all of the apparent motions of the quasi-stationary features appear to be minor fluctuations about the average positions. A clear trend in the motion is apparent only for knot C of the FSRQ 2251+158. Over ∼10 yr of observations, this feature started ∼0.7 mas from the 43 GHz core in 2007, after which the separation decreased to a minimum of ∼0.45 mas in 2013. Since then, the separation has been increasing more gradually. It is unclear whether this motion is related to changes in the intensity distribution of this extended feature, or to bright knots that were ejected from the core and later merged with C. An alternative possibility is that the change in separation between the core and C in 2251+158 is due to the motion of the core itself, contrary to the assumption made in this work that every core is at an essentially stationary position in the jet.Almost all of the apparent motions of the quasi-stationary features appear to be minor fluctuations about the average positions.

        <p>Between 2007 and 2018, 75 of the 425 (17.6%) moving knots detected in our sample exhibit nonballistic apparent velocities, which we define as motions that are best fit by multiple line segments in a piecewise fashion. We also include the quasistationary feature C of the FSRQ 2251+158 in the following analysis, as it has been reliably observed to have motion around the average stationary value. Across the three subclasses, we have detected acceleration in 55 features in 16 FSRQs, nine features in six BL Lac objects, and 11 features in the three RGs. Due to the nature of our piecewise linear fits, the trajectories of many of these knots contain multiple acceleration regions. This totals 104 individual acceleration regions in the jets of 25 blazars in our sample. Given that the multiple acceleration regions may have different properties, we consider each region to be an independent measurement of possible acceleration within a particular subclass of blazar, and do not calculate a "typical" acceleration for each source. Table 10 gives the accelerations of each region in each knot as follows: 1-name of the source; 2designation of the component; 3-acceleration region number, N acc ; starting with 1 for the first region present (between moving segments 1 and 2) in a knot trajectory and reaching a maximum of 4 for a knot that is best fit by three linear segments in both the X and Y directions; 4-beginning date of the acceleration, t start ; 5-end date of the acceleration, t end ; 6-the acceleration parallel the jet,   m , and its 1σ uncertainty in mas yr -2 ; 7-the acceleration perpendicular to the jet,  m ^, and its 1σ uncertainty in mas yr -2 ; 8-R  m , the distance from the core to the position of the knot based on the estimated time break point (from the piecewise fit), in milliarcseconds; 9-the normalized acceleration parallel to the jet, η ∥ , and its 1σ uncertainty in yr -1 ; and 10-the normalized acceleration perpendicular to the jet, η ⊥ , and its 1σ uncertainty in yr -1 (see below for definitions of η ∥ and η ⊥ ). As discussed in Section 3.2, the accelerations parallel and perpendicular to the jet were determined using the averaged position angle for sources with constant or wide jets and using the linear or spline trend to calculate the jet position angle at the time of acceleration for those with time-variable jet positions. In this way, we separate the time variability of the jet as a whole from the change in directions of knots relative to the bulk flow.Between 2007 and 2018, 75 of the 425 (17.6%) moving knots detected in our sample exhibit nonballistic apparent velocities, which we define as motions that are best fit by multiple line segments in a piecewise fashion.

        <p>One advantage of the piecewise linear fits used in this work (instead of the polynomial fits presented in Jorstad et al. 2017) is that, since the accelerations can be seen to take place at specific locations in the jet, it is straightforward to determine the distance from the 43 GHz core to the acceleration zone.

        <p>From inspection of the distributions of η ∥ , it is apparent that accelerations close to the core are positive, increasing the speed at which knots flow down the jet axis. As the distance from the core increases, the magnitude of this acceleration generally decreases. Once knots reach distances of ∼5-10 pc from the core, most accelerations are negative. While this work at 43 GHz probes projected distances of ∼0-35 pc from the core, data at 15 GHz (Homan et al. 2015) probes farther out, up to ∼100 pc projected distance from the core. The data at longer wavelengths supports our results here, with a general turnover from positive to negative/no acceleration beyond ∼10-20 pc projected distance. This result indicates that, although the overall diversity in apparent speeds likely requires a variety of different shock strengths if the knots are shock waves (e.g., Marscher &amp; Gear 1985), it is common for accelerations to occur close to the core and for constant speeds or decelerations to dominate farther downstream (∼10 2 pc deprojected distance).From inspection of the distributions of η ∥ , it is apparent that accelerations close to the core are positive, increasing the speed at which knots flow down the jet axis.

        <p>The distributions of η ⊥ indicate a different behavior of the knot motions perpendicular to the jet axis. Beyond ∼2 pc from the core, the acceleration distributions are consistent with low, if any, acceleration transverse to the jet axis. However, initially there appears to be positive acceleration, resulting in knot motion away from the jet axis. This could be due to bends in the jet close to the core or a widening of the jet flow. The motion is reversed for distances ∼1-2 pc, where there is negative acceleration. This could be an indication of recollimation of the jet flow, such that the jet width narrows or remains constant downstream of this point. Stacking of the 43 GHz images of jets can be used to investigate the jet width (e.g., Pushkarev et al. 2017;Kovalev et al. 2020;Casadio et al. 2021) and test whether the acceleration trends are actually related to the jet width.The distributions of η ⊥ indicate a different behavior of the knot motions perpendicular to the jet axis.

        <p>An important question is whether accelerations are related to the stationary features in the jets, as one might expect if the features represent standing shocks. To test this, Figure 16 displays the relationship between the locations of each acceleration region and the closest stationary feature. The gray dotted line depicts a 1:1 relationship between the two, i.e., where the positions of acceleration and a stationary feature are the same. We have used the standard deviation of the stationary feature position as the uncertainty in the distance from the core to the closest stationary feature. We have assigned a positional error of 0.02 mas (∼0.2 times our best resolution) to the distance from the core to the acceleration region.An important question is whether accelerations are related to the stationary features in the jets, as one might expect if the features represent standing shocks.

        <p>Very few pairs of acceleration region and stationary feature fall below the 1:1 relationship line. This indicates that most accelerations occur at or beyond stationary features. An example of this trend is readily seen in the FSRQ 0336-019, where knots B2, B3, and B4 appear to accelerate after passing through stationary features A1 and A4. Such behavior is expected if the stationary features are structural components in the jet that can interact with moving features, such as recollimation shocks. The interpretation of recollimation shocks is further supported by the acceleration distributions for projected distances ∼1-4 pc, which are predominately negative for η ⊥ .Very few pairs of acceleration region and stationary feature fall below the 1:1 relationship line.

        <p>In order to estimate τ var , we make use of the fact that the rise and decay portions of the millimeter-wave light curves of blazars can both be roughly modeled by exponential profiles, so that S t t ln ( ) µ (Terasranta &amp; Valtaoja 1994;Lister 2001). Such millimeter-wave flares in blazars occur roughly at the same time as the emergence of a new knot from the core, and the decay of the flux density of a knot resembles that of the total flux density (Savolainen et al. 2002). We thus approximate the flux decay of the reliable knots in our sample with an exponential of the form S t S k t t ln max ( ( ) ) ( ) • = -, where t t max  is the epoch corresponding to the maximum flux density, S max , S • is the flux density of a least-squares fit to the light curve decay at time t max , and k is the slope of the fit. The timescale of variability is then τ var = |1/k| yr. While τ var for most knots can be determined to within ∼10%, some light curves have no well-defined maximum given the time coverage of the observations, which leads to significant uncertainty in the timescale of variability. Because of this, we remove knots from our reliable sample if 2 var var s t &gt; t . We also cut from our analysis motion segments beyond the first acceleration zone for knots with complex motion. This reduced sample consists of estimates for the physical parameters of 162 knots in 22 FSRQs, 80 knots in 11 BL Lac objects, and 31 knots in two RGs. The remaining three sources either have no reliable moving knots with defined epochs of ejections (the RG 0316 +413 and the BL Lac object 1652+398) or no moving features at all identified in this work (the BL Lac object 1959+650). While we use the superluminal knots of the BL Lac object 1101 +384 to determine its jet parameters, the low apparent speeds suggest that we are looking at a sheath of the jet rather than the region closer to the axis (see Section 5.3).In order to estimate τ var , we make use of the fact that the rise and decay portions of the millimeter-wave light curves of blazars can both be roughly modeled by exponential profiles, so that S t t ln ( ) µ (Terasranta &amp; Valtaoja 1994;Lister 2001).

The FSRQ and BL Lac object distributions both peak at Γ ∼ 10, but BL Lac objects have a small local peak in the Γ = 2-6 bins, while the FSRQ distribution has a longer high-Γ tail. There is a single FSRQ knot for which Γ 60, B1 in 0528+134, with Γ = 81 ± 10; it is placed in the highest bin in the distribution. The RG distribution is comparatively narrow and low-valued, with all but one of the knots having Γ &lt; 10. To directly compare the Lorentz factors of FSRQs, BL Lac objects, and RGs, we utilize a K-S test on the distributions of Γ for the "typical" knots of each source (see Section 5.3), shown in Figure 20 (right panel). Despite the low number of sources, we continue to infer that RGs have the slowest knots (Γ  10), while FSRQs have, on average, faster knots, with a long tail (Γ extending up to ∼60). Both FSRQ and BL Lac object distributions are statistically different from the RG distribution (∼2σ), with FSRQ versus RG  p 0.955, 0.003 = = , while the BL Lac objects versus RG  p 0.846, 0.036 = = . The K-S test cannot distinguish between the FSRQ and BL Lac object distributions, however, with  0.269 = and p = 0.495. Figure 21 plots the distributions of the viewing angles for all reliable knots in the three subclasses. It is immediately apparent that RGs have a very different distribution than the FSRQs and BL Lac objects, peaking in the 16°-18°bin, with all knots having Θ • &gt; 10. Minor differences can be seen between the FSRQ and BL Lac object distributions, such as the longer high-angle tail of the BL Lac objects. The peaks are also different, with the FSRQ distribution peaking between 0°and 2°, while the BL Lac object distribution peaks in the 2°-4°range. In both subclasses, however, the majority (&gt;75%) of knots have Θ • &lt; 10°. Again to compare between the subclasses statistically, we use the viewing angle of a "typical" knot (see Section 5.3) for each source. The distributions for each subclass are shown in Figure 21.

The FSRQ and BL Lac object distributions both peak at Γ ∼ 10, but BL Lac objects have a small local peak in the Γ = 2-6 bins, while the FSRQ distribution has a longer high-Γ tail. There is a single FSRQ knot for which Γ 60, B1 in 0528+134, with Γ = 81 ± 10; it is placed in the highest bin in the distribution. The RG distribution is comparatively narrow and low-valued, with all but one of the knots having Γ &lt; 10.

        <p>According to Table 12, for any individual source, there is a diversity in knot properties, which complicates the determination of the characteristic physical conditions in the jet. The physical parameters of many jets are evidently time-variable, perhaps stochastically determined from a distribution of possible values. As an example, Figure 22 shows the distributions of the physical parameters δ var , Γ, and Θ • of the reliable knots of the RG 0415+379. The distributions can be approximated by Gaussian functions, with means μ = 2°.6, 5°.8, and 16°.3 and standard deviations σ = 0°.7, 3°.1, and 5°.0, respectively, for δ var , Γ, and Θ • . However, these welldetermined distributions are the exception, since the number of knots observed in our study is more limited for most of the sample. The majority of sources have N 15, too few to fit Gaussian distributions to the data accurately. Given the knot ejection rates of the sources observed in our sample, another ∼10 yr of monitoring would be required to observe enough knots to define the distributions of physical parameters for all objects.According to Table 12, for any individual source, there is a diversity in knot properties, which complicates the determination of the characteristic physical conditions in the jet.

        <p>Instead of analyzing tentative distributions of physical parameters of jets in our sample, we instead focus on "representative" values. For each reliable knot, we calculate a metric of overall uncertainty, and app s b are the uncertainties in the variability Doppler factor and proper motion. We focus on these two parameters, since they factor directly into the determination of Γ and Θ • (both given in Equation ( 6)), as well as the opening semi-angle (described below). We then choose as "representative" the knot from the reliable sample of each jet that has the optimal combination of relatively high apparent speed and a relatively low value of ξ. We adopt the criterion ξ/(β + δ var ) &lt; 0.15 to select knots with low uncertainty. Choosing the highest apparent speed with a relatively low uncertainty ensures that the derived physical conditions are consistent with the most extreme, yet robust, behavior of the jet. The statistics of the chosen knots, one per source, would not have differed significantly across the sample had we instead chosen the knots with the highest established Doppler factor and lowest uncertainty. The typical knots are used to determine differences between the distributions of parameters for each subclass in Figures 8,19,20,and 21. For each jet, we follow Jorstad et al. (2017) in calculating the opening semi-angle in two ways. Method A is based on the relation between the intrinsic and projected opening angles: Jorstad et al. 2005). Here, θ p is the projected opening semiangle of the jet, and 〈Θ • 〉 is the representative viewing angle of the jet. We define θ p as twice the standard deviation of the knot position angles about a fixed value, regardless of whether the jet position angle is found to vary, as described in Section 3.2. We adopt the average uncertainties of 〈Θ jet 〉, 〈σ Θ 〉 as the uncertainty of θ p . Method B applies to jets with multiple reliable knots.

Such a structure would consist of two flows: a faster, lower-density component streaming along the central axis (spine), and a slower, denser component along the edges of the jet.

        <p>It is possible that most knots seen in our images flow down the spine of a jet, (propelled by the rotational energy of the black hole; Blandford &amp; Znajek 1977), while a relatively small number of knots form along the slower sheath (e.g., from a magnetically driven wind from the accretion disk; Blandford &amp; Payne 1982). Several sources in our sample have been inferred to have a spine-sheath structure, such as 0316+413 q q &gt; . The spinesheath structure in 1055+018 was identified from the polarization of the emission rather than the total intensity that we have analyzed here. The inferred layered structure in 1226 +023 was based on images with extremely high spatial resolution at lower frequencies (1.6 and 4.8 GHz); it may be the case that we have not observed a slow knot in the sheath of this source.

        <p>Another useful comparison can be made with the work of Liodakis et al. (2018). These authors modeled the 15 GHz light curves of 1029 blazars and blazar-like AGNs, as observed with the Owen's Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO; Richards et al. 2011), with a series of exponential rise and decay profiles (flares) superposed on a stochastic background. For each flare, a variability brightness temperature was calculated. Since each source can have numerous flares within the light curve, distributions of variability brightness temperatures can be made for each source. Comparison with an expected equilibrium brightness temperature then yields distributions of Doppler factors, δ var . The authors then used the maximum apparent speeds of radio knots at 15 GHz from the 
            <rs type="software">MOJAVE</rs> program (Lister et al. 2016) to calculate Γ and Θ • . Agreement between the two methods would provide important constraints for the Doppler factors and equipartition states in the jets.

        <p>We use the same formalism as Jorstad et al. (2017) to calculate the weighted averages of the physical parameters for each subclass in our sample. Two values of the average opening semi-angle values are obtained for the two different methods of estimating θ • , A • q and B • q . We calculate the uncertainty in the average quantities as the weighted standard deviation of the parameters of the sources in the subclass about these means, where the weights are the inverse of the variance of the parameter for each source. Table 15 gives the result of the averaging as follows: 1-Name of the AGN subclass; 2number of sources in the subclass, N s , used to calculate the averages; 3-Doppler factor, d, and its weighted standard deviation from the included knots; 4-bulk Lorentz factor, G, and its weighted standard deviation; 5-viewing angle, • Q , and its weighted standard deviation; 6-opening semi-angle of the jet according to method A, A • q , and its weighted standard deviation; and 7-opening semi-angle of the jet according to method B, B • q , and its weighted standard deviation. While the physical parameters of FSRQs and BL Lac objects overlap when the standard deviations are included, the expected trend of larger Doppler and Lorentz factors in FSRQs relative to BL Lac objects is observed in the current data (Jorstad et al. 2005). Higher values of δ in FSRQs are supported by the higher brightness temperatures of moving components. The relative similarity of the viewing and opening semi-angles between the two subclasses (compared to previous results; e.g., Pushkarev et al. 2009;Jorstad et al. 2017) can be explained by our choice of the fastest "typical" knot to represent particular sources. In a spine-sheath jet structure, the fastest knots all come from the spine, resulting in an opening semi-angle that would be smaller than if all knots were considered together (as would be expected in BL Lac objects). The physical parameters of RGs are also consistent with the predictions of the unified scheme of AGNs (Urry &amp; Padovani 1995), with comparable Lorentz factors, smaller Doppler factors, and much larger viewing angles compared to FSRQs and BL Lac objects. However, as was pointed out in Jorstad et al. (2017), these RGs are the brightest γ-ray emitters of their subclass, and may not be representative of the subclass as a whole.We use the same formalism as Jorstad et al.

        <p>Three sources in our sample do not have superluminal knots meeting our reliability criteria described at the beginning of Section 5: the RG 0316+413 and the BL Lac objects 1652 +398 and 1959+650. Thus, we cannot calculate their physical parameters using their knot motions. Instead, we make a rough estimate for the physical parameters of these sources based on two assumptions: (1) the intrinsic opening semi-angle of the jet is equal to A • q , the average of the subclass to which the source belongs, and (2) Γθ • ∼ 0.2 is universal for bright γ-ray AGNs (Clausen-Brown et al. 2013;Jorstad et al. 2017). The low apparent speeds of the knots in the BL Lac object 1101+384 indicate that we are looking at the sheath of the jet, so we also use the same formalism to estimate the parameters of this source. The estimated parameters for these four sources are given in Table 13. The above assumptions result in viewing angles ∼2× smaller than the subclass average for these sources. As we have only observed 1959+650 at six epochs, it is possible that the jet does indeed have physical parameters as estimated above, but more monitoring is necessary. However, the fact that only slow proper motions have been observed in 0316+413, 1101+384, and 1652+398 despite intensive monitoring campaigns (e.g., this work; Blasi et al. 2013;Lister et al. 2016) creates a "Doppler crisis" with their high-energy properties, which require high Doppler factors (and subsequently high proper motions). The decelerations observed in Figure 15 (5-10 pc from the core for parallel acceleration, and 1-2 pc from the core for perpendicular acceleration) might be able to explain the discrepancy, as high Doppler factors would only be seen closer to the central engine, beyond the opacity limit of 43 GHz observations. It is also possible that a mildly relativistic flow, corresponding to a "sheath" around the faster central spine, would obscure the faster spine, as seems to be the case in 0316+413 (Nagai et al. 2014).Three sources in our sample do not have superluminal knots meeting our reliability criteria described at the beginning of Section 5: the RG 0316+413 and the BL Lac objects 1652 +398 and 1959+650.

        <p>The brightness temperature distributions presented in Section 3.1 are similar to those expected for unbeamed, incoherent synchrotron radiation produced by relativistic electrons that are in equipartition with the magnetic field T b,eq ∼ 5 × 10 10 K (Readhead 1994).

During high activity states (such as outbursts) of blazars, it is possible that equipartition is violated such that the energy density of radiating particles is greater than that of the magnetic field in the VLBI core (e.g., Homan et al. 2006; Kovalev et al. 2016).

        <p>As discussed in Section 5.1, the rise and decay of flux in millimeter-wave light curves of blazars can be roughly modeled by exponential profiles (e.g., Terasranta &amp; Valtaoja 1994;Lister 2001;Savolainen et al. 2002). We are thus able to estimate a timescale of variability, τ var , from the flux decay rate, k, as τ var = |1/k| yr. We show in Figure 18 that these decay rates are often primarily due to radiative losses, modulated by light-travel delays, as opposed to adiabatic expansion.

        <p>We provide the distributions of knot ages for each subclass in the left panel of Figure 29. All three distributions are qualitatively similar, with a substantial peak in the distribution for components that live for ∼1-2 yr. There are several knots in for BL Lac objects versus RGs. If the decay of the flux density of a knot is controlled by the light-crossing time, intrinsically smaller knots should have shorter decay times in the plasma frame. Since the angular sizes of knots are similar for all of the sources (see Table 2), knots in objects with lower redshifts-all of the RGs-should have smaller sizes. Given the lower mean redshift values of the RGs versus the BL Lac objects and FSRQs, this effect must be canceled by the higher Doppler factors found for the BL Lac objects and FSRQs in order to explain the similar 1-2 yr ages of the peaks of the distributions seen in Figure 29.

        <p>It is important to point out the effect that our roughly monthly observation cadence might have on the observed lifetimes of knots. Very bright components in the jets of blazars are easy to identify in the radio maps and fit with Gaussian profiles (as in Section 2), thus would need to have extremely fast decays (&lt;1 month) to not be seen at other epochs. Given the paucity of short-decay knots seen in the distributions in Figure 29, this scenario is unlikely. However, faint components are difficult to distinguish from noise, especially if such knots travel down the jet quickly with short decay times (e.g., if their decay were &lt;0.25 yr, as we require at least four observations of a knot for it to be properly identified). Such knots would be missed in the above analysis. Fast, faint components have been seen in some sources (e.g., the BL Lac object 0219+428 (3C 66A); Jorstad et al. 2005), but to detect them requires denser temporal sampling.It is important to point out the effect that our roughly monthly observation cadence might have on the observed lifetimes of knots.

        <p>It is well established that there exists a connection between the γ-ray state of blazars and their parsec-scale jet behaviors. Nieppola et al. (2011) have shown that there is a statistically significant correlation between the γ-ray and 37 GHz radio light curves. The brightest γ-ray flares tend to coincide with with the early stages of a millimeter-wave outburst (León-Tavares et al. 2011). Such trends are not universal: for example, at 15 GHz a significant correlation was only found in four of 41 analyzed blazars (Max-Moerbeck et al. 2014). However, the 
            <rs type="software">F-GAMMA</rs> program has found that the radio variations of 54 γ-ray bright blazars lag the γ-ray variations, with delays systematically decreasing as the observed frequency changes from centimeter to millimeter/submillimeter (Fuhrmann et al. 2014). With regard to knots traveling down the parsec-scale jet, studies of individual sources have revealed a wide diversity in the behavior of blazars. The majority of γ-ray outbursts appear to be connected with the propagation of a knot down the jet (e.g., Jorstad et al. 2001aJorstad et al. , 2013Jorstad et al. , 2017;;Marscher et al. 2010;Agudo et al. 2011a;Morozova et al. 2014). In several of these cases, the flux profile of the γ-ray outburst can be connected with the passage of superluminal knots through the core or quasi-stationary features (e.g., Agudo et al. 2011a;Weaver et al. 2019;Liodakis et al. 2020). However, these features are usually located parsecs from the central black hole, at odds with the small sizes required by causality arguments from the short timescales of high-energy variability (Aharonian et al. 2007;Tavecchio et al. 2010;Nalewajko et al. 2014). Another problem is the origin of high-energy outbursts known as "orphan" flares (e.g., Krawczynski et al. 2004;Marscher et al. 2010;MacDonald et al. 2015;Sobacchi et al. 2021;Yang et al. 2021). During such flares, the γ-ray flux may increase by a factor ∼100, and yet little variability is seen at longer wavelengths, with no interaction between moving and stationary features observed in VLBA images.

        <p>While a full analysis of the relationship between the parsecscale jet kinematics of the blazars in our sample and their γ-ray behavior is beyond the scope of this work, here we present some simple relationships and correlations. It has been shown by the MOJAVE survey that the jets of γ-ray bright quasars have faster average apparent motions and brighter parsec-scale cores than those with weaker γ-ray fluxes (e.g., Kovalev et al. 2009;Lister et al. 2009Lister et al. , 2016)). This relation implies that the jets of brighter γ-ray quasars have higher Doppler boosting factors. In order to determine if there is a relationship between the observed physical parameters of the sources in our sample and their γ-ray flux, we calculate the maximum γ-ray flux, S ,max obs g , (ignoring upper limits) of each source according to their 10 yr Fermi-LAT light curves.While a full analysis of the relationship between the parsecscale jet kinematics of the blazars in our sample and their γ-ray behavior is beyond the scope of this work, here we present some simple relationships and correlations.

        <p>1. We have implemented a new piecewise linear fitting method to derive the kinematics of moving components in the jets. This algorithm allows us to estimate the distance down the jet at which acceleration (if any) occurs. We have identified 559 distinct emission features, of which 38 are the 43 GHz cores, which are assumed to be stationary. We have further classified 96 components as quasi-stationary, leaving 425 knots that move with respect to the VLBI core. Among these moving knots, 75 exhibit nonlinear motion, for which we calculate the acceleration parallel and perpendicular to the jet direction. 2. To incorporate the presence of lower limits to the brightness temperature of 10.1% of all components into our analysis, we have used the Kaplan-Meier estimator for the survival function of the cores and knots to derive a median value of the brightness temperature for each source. We plan to provide a deeper analysis of the survival functions of the core and knot brightness temperatures, covering the temporal properties and whether all sources can be described with a similar parameterized survival function, in a future work (Z. R. Weaver 2022, in preparation). 3. We find, despite a low significance in a K-S test due to a small number of sources, that FSRQs and BL Lac objects have more intense cores than those of RGs, but the knots in the extended jets of BL Lac objects are significantly less intense than the knots of RGs and FSRQs. The brightness temperature distributions of the noncore components can be explained by Doppler boosting of the expected intrinsic brightness temperature. 4. With 10.5 yr of data, we have analyzed parsec-scale jet position angle variations of each source. We have quantitatively placed the jets into four categories. The majority of jets (23) have jet position angles that are constant with time, while a set of six sources has a very wide jet that is constant in position angle. Two sources, the FSRQs 0420-014 and 1226+023, have jet position angles that change linearly with time. The remaining seven sources have complex variations of position angle, which we have fit with third-order splines. 5. Due to our piecewise linear fitting method, any individual moving knot can have multiple motions over different time periods. We therefore have analyzed a total of 529 knot speeds. These speeds range from 0.01c to 78c. The FSRQs generally have the fastest knots, with a distribution that peaks between 8c-10c and extends to ∼78c. The distribution of apparent speeds for BL Lac objects peaks between 0c-2c, as well as 8c-10c, but only extends up to ∼30c. RGs have a very narrow distribution of speeds, only extending to ∼10c. We find superluminal motion in at least one knot of the RG 0316+413 of β app = 1.38c ± 0.03c, while the remaining superluminal knots in RGs come from 0415+379 and 0430+052. The moving knots in FSRQs tend to travel in the same direction, while knots of BL Lac objects show larger variations in the direction of motion. 6. On average, there exist ∼2 quasi-stationary features in the jet of each FSRQ, ∼3 in each BL, and ∼6 in each RG. Almost half of these features have appeared or disappeared during the 10.5 yr observation period, indicating that they may be transient. The locations of the majority of stationary features are concentrated within 1 mas of the core (projected), independent of the subclass.1.

        <p>We have characterized the fluctuations in the positions of these features using confidence ellipses, which show that the stationary features in RGs tend to "slosh" around the average position in a direction parallel to the jet axis. However, there is no clear preference of directional shifts for the stationary features of BL Lac objects and FSRQs. 7. We have detected 104 different acceleration regions in the sample. Only a few BL Lac objects have knots with discernible acceleration. We find that, statistically, these accelerations are consistent with changes in the Lorentz factor of the knots rather than changes in the jet direction.We have characterized the fluctuations in the positions of these features using confidence ellipses, which show that the stationary features in RGs tend to "slosh" around the average position in a direction parallel to the jet axis.

        <p>Parallel to the jet axis, we see an initial positive acceleration close to the core of the jet (&lt;5 pc), while beyond 10 pc, the knots tend to decelerate. Perpendicular to the jet axis, we find an initial positive acceleration for projected distances 0-1 pc from the core and negative acceleration 1-2 pc from the core. Beyond ∼5 pc, we see very small magnitudes of acceleration. Similar trends are found farther from the core at longer wavelengths (e.g., Homan et al. 2015). 8. To test whether interactions with standing shocks have an effect on the moving knots, we have paired the acceleration regions with the closest (on average) stationary features. We have found that few pairs fail to follow an expected 1:1 relation, indicating that accelerations take place at or beyond the stationary features. Such behavior is expected if the stationary features are structural components, such as recollimation shocks. 9. We have derived Doppler factors of variability, δ var , for a subset of reliable knots in the sample, which, along with the measured apparent speeds, have allowed us to calculate the Lorentz factors Γ and viewing angle Θ • .Parallel to the jet axis, we see an initial positive acceleration close to the core of the jet (&lt;5 pc), while beyond 10 pc, the knots tend to decelerate.

        <p>The flux decays of the knots in our sample are statistically likely to be caused by radiative losses (modulated by light-travel delays) rather than adiabatic expansion. 10. The Lorentz factors of knots in the jets of our sample range from 2-60, with faster knots observed in FSRQs than in BL Lac objects and RGs. Our results agree with the expectation that the jets of RGs lie at larger viewing angles with respect to the line of sight, with an average Θ • ∼ 15°-30°, compared to the FSRQ and BL Lac object jets with peak viewing angles ∼0°-4°. 11. For most of the jets in our sample, we see a wide diversity in the apparent speeds and Doppler factors of knots moving down the parsec-scale jet. For sources with many observed knots (such as the RG 0415+379), we see that this diversity can be explained by a distribution of physical parameters from which a knot's parameters can be drawn statistically. Whether the distributions of knot parameters are similar for different sources remains unclear, as many of our sources will likely require a further 5-10 yr of monitoring for enough knots to be observed to determine their distributions robustly. 12. We have defined the "typical" knot in each jet by choosing the fastest knot with the smallest uncertainty in β app and δ var to represent the jet as a whole. From these typical values, we calculate the Lorentz factor and viewing angle of each jet, and find that, on average, • q for this source, and 21 sources were used to calculate B • q . FSRQ jets have higher values of δ var and Γ compared to BL Lac objects, while knots in RGs are slower and have much wider viewing angles and intrinsic opening semiangles. The physical parameters of each jet as calculated using the "typical" knot are statistically similar to other estimates of the physical parameters determined through lower-frequency monitoring (e.g., Liodakis et al. 2018), which probes farther distances from the core. 13. In general, the knots of FSRQs are longer lived than the knots of BL Lac objects and RGs, reaching farther projected distances from the core. The knots of FSRQs and BL Lac objects have flux decay rates that are related to their age roughly as k T 2 age 1 ~-despite the differences in their age distributions, while RG knots follow k T 2.4 age 0.65 ~-. The distribution of ages of all subclasses peaks in the 1-2 yr range despite large differences in the physical sizes of knots of RGs versus BL Lac objects and FSRQs. This can be explained by the lower Doppler factors of the RGs. 14. We find weak correlations between the maximum γ-ray flux and the typical apparent speeds and Doppler factors of jets in our sample. We also find that the blazars with brighter 43 GHz cores typically reach higher maximum γray fluxes. We plan to perform a temporal analysis comparing the ejection times of knots in our sample with γ-ray outbursts in a future study.

Due to the low number of core components observed for the BL Lac object 1959+650 (N = 6), we use the lower confidence interval as a lower limit to the brightness temperature of the core for the source (among all 13 BL Lac objects, a single lower limit will not significantly affect the results).To determine a "typical" brightness temperature for the core and knots of a source, we calculate the median of the survival function, i.e., where  T log 0.5 10 b,obs s ( )= , for each time period.

        <p>We note that this analysis is based on a few approximations, such as nonvariability of the brightness temperature of components and similar properties of sources within each subclass. It is not expected a priori that the survival function of the component brightness temperatures for a source should be the same for different time periods (e.g., the faster decrease in the survival function for knots observed from 2013 January to 2018 December versus knots observed during the entire time period for the BL Lac object 0219+428 near brightness temperatures ∼10 8 K, as in Figure 32). However, temporal analysis of the brightness temperatures in the jets of blazars as well as an investigation into the assumptions outlined above are beyond the scope of this paper, which is focused on the kinematics of the features.

        <p>Treatment of data with lower and upper limits (or, more generally, right-and left-censored data, respectively) in astronomy has been performed in a number of fashions, of which many are biased or incorrect (Feigelson &amp; Babu 2012). For example, if the number of limits is small, then they are unlikely to change the result of statistical tests; however, they will bias the results as the number of limits in a sample grows. The most statistically rigorous procedures consider all of the data points, both detected values and censored data, to model the properties of a parent distribution of the variable in question under specific mathematical constraints. Such procedures fall under the umbrella of "survival analysis" (Avni et al. 1980;Feigelson &amp; Nelson 1985;Schmitt 1985;Avni &amp; Tananbaum 1986;Isobe et al. 1986;LaValley et al. 1992). A few methods for censored data have been developed specifically for astronomical contexts (Akritas et al. 1995;Akritas &amp; Siebert 1996).Treatment of data with lower and upper limits (or, more generally, right-and left-censored data, respectively) in astronomy has been performed in a number of fashions, of which many are biased or incorrect (Feigelson &amp; Babu 2012).
