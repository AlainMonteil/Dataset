        <p>We propose twisted van der Waals heterostructures as an efficient, reliable and scalable quantum platform that enables the seamless realization and control of a plethora of interacting quantum models in a solid state framework. These new materials hold great promise to realize novel and elusive states of matter in experiment. Going one step beyond, in this paper we propose these systems as a robust quantum simulation platform to study strongly correlated physics and topology that is notoriously difficult to study computationally. Among the features that make these materials a versatile toolbox are (i) tunability of properties via readily accessible external parameters (such as gating, straining, packing and twist angle), (ii) ability to realize and control a large number of fundamental many-body quantum models relevant in the field of condensed matter physics and beyond and (iii) state-of-the-art experimental readouts exist to directly map out their rich phase diagrams in and out of equilibrium. This general framework, besides unravelling new phases of matter, permits to identify their key microscopic ingredients and therefore to robustly realize and functionalize those new phases in other material systems, deepening our fundamental understanding and holding many promises for future technological applications.We propose twisted van der Waals heterostructures as an efficient, reliable and scalable quantum platform that enables the seamless realization and control of a plethora of interacting quantum models in a solid state framework.

        <p>The inseparability of groups of particles into products of their individual states underpins the most counterintuitive predictions of quantum mechanics. In condensed matter physics, recent focus has been placed on finding and understanding quantum materials -systems in which a delicate balance between the crystal lattice and strong electronic interactions lead to new inseparable, collective behaviors with exotic properties. Encompassing rich phenomenologies ranging from superconductivity at high temperatures to topologically-ordered states of matter with fractionalized excitations, numerous materials have recently come under intense scrutiny for the realization of quantum phases on demand [1].The inseparability of groups of particles into products of their individual states underpins the most counterintuitive predictions of quantum mechanics.

        <p>A major impediment to the systematic study of correlated electron physics is the comparative lack of tunability of conventional chemical compounds. The main means of control are pressure, strain and doping. This limited range of control knobs severely limits experimental exploration of the wider phase diagram, essential to guide the discovery of novel quantum phases and to controlled studies of quantum criticality, unconventional phase transitions, or realizations of exotic topological states of matter that are both of fundamental interest and could have applications in emerging quantum technologies such as quantum computing and simulation.A major impediment to the systematic study of correlated electron physics is the comparative lack of tunability of conventional chemical compounds.

        <p>Another impediment lies in the difficulty of solving these paradigmatic quantum Hamiltonians via present computational approaches. As an alternative, in the early 80's Feynman proposed quantum simulation as a paradigm to turning the problem upside down [2]: implementing clean models using real physical systems, to "simulate" the ground state, thermodynamic behavior or non-equilibrium dynamics of such models. If the implementation is well-controlled, the results can be used to disentangle the more complex material's phenomena for which the original model was set up, as well as to guide the way towards stabilizing and controlling new and exotic phases of matter in real quantum materials.Another impediment lies in the difficulty of solving these paradigmatic quantum Hamiltonians via present computational approaches.

        <p>Much progress has been achieved via studying ultracold gases of bosonic and fermionic atoms, which can be confined in optical lattices to realize lattice models of condensed matter physics in a controlled manner [3]. While these systems are highly controllable and can faithfully realize certain quantum Hamiltonians, it remains an experimental challenge to engineer Hamiltonians with tunable long-range interactions and especially to access low temperature emergent long-range ordered phases, such as e.g. the intriguing d-wave state of the t-t' repulsive Hubbard model [4]. This article identifies Moiré heterostructures of van der Waals materials as an alternative and complementary condensed matter approach to realize a large set of arXiv:2011.12638v1 [quant-ph] 25 Nov 2020 highly controllable quantum Hamiltonians. While such systems do not typically afford the high level of isolation and precise tunability that cold atomic systems do, the large degree of tunability control available through readily accessible experimental knobs allows for the exploration of phase diagrams of vast and novel sets of manybody Hamiltonians in and out of equilibrium and at very low temperatures. In particular, we will review how different choices of two-dimensional (2D) heterostructure compositions at different twist angles realize a wide range of effective low-energy electronic tight-binding Hamiltonians with various geometries, dimensionality, frustration, spin-orbit coupling as well as interactions beyond the Hubbard limit, including partially screened and unscreened Coulomb interactions. This allows for flexible interaction-engineering as well as control of band structure and topology.Much progress has been achieved via studying ultracold gases of bosonic and fermionic atoms, which can be confined in optical lattices to realize lattice models of condensed matter physics in a controlled manner [3].

        <p>Moiré heterostructures of van der Waals materials exploit quantum interference to quench the effective kinetic energy scales, which permits both driving the system at low energies to an interaction-dominated regime, and drastically enhancing anisotropies or reducing symmetries of the monolayer. Conceptually, the physical mechanism can be understood straightforwardly in analogy to classical Moiré interference patterns (see Fig. 1, central inset): if two identical patterns with a discrete translation symmetry in two dimensions are superimposed at an angle, the combined motif retains a periodicity at much longer wave lengths for an infinite set of small rational angles.Moiré heterostructures of van der Waals materials exploit quantum interference to quench the effective kinetic energy scales, which permits both driving the system at low energies to an interaction-dominated regime, and drastically enhancing anisotropies or reducing symmetries of the monolayer.

        <p>Similarly, a heterostructure of two or more monolayers with commensurate lattice constants stacked at a twist retains spatial periodicity for small commensurate angles, albeit with a much larger Moiré unit cell. This Moiré superlattice can span many unit cells and defines a new crystal structure with a mini Brillouin zone. Within this Moiré Brillouin zone, the folded bands lead to a multitude of crossings, which are subsequently split via interlayer hybridization [5]. Crucially, lattice relaxation enhances these avoided crossings and typically segregates sets of almost-dispersionless bands on meV energy scales [6], which can be addressed individually via gate-tuning the chemical potential.Similarly, a heterostructure of two or more monolayers with commensurate lattice constants stacked at a twist retains spatial periodicity for small commensurate angles, albeit with a much larger Moiré unit cell.

        <p>A complementary view of the physics of a Moiré band follows from considering its real space description. A localized electron in a Moiré band can be viewed as occupying a virtual "Moiré orbital" that can extend over hundreds of atoms, effectively spreading over the entire Moiré unit cell. Importantly, the shape of Moiré orbitals changes with the size of the Moiré unit cell so that the electronic interactions become a function of the twist angle as well, decreasing at a slower rate than the kinetic energy scales for decreasing angle. This permits tuning a priori weakly-interacting electronic systems into regimes dominated by electronic correlations in a controlled fashion.A complementary view of the physics of a Moiré band follows from considering its real space description.

        <p>A first demonstration of the above phenomenology was realized in materials with hexagonal structure and multiple atomic orbitals. The Moiré band width for twisted bilayers of graphene does not behave monotonically as a function of twist angle but exhibits a series of "magic" angles [5] at which the Moiré bands near charge neutrality become almost dispersionless over a large fraction of the Moiré Brillouin zone.A first demonstration of the above phenomenology was realized in materials with hexagonal structure and multiple atomic orbitals.

        <p>More broadly, as reductions of the electronic band width equivalently enhance the role of competing energy scales, this microscopic structural knob to selectively quench the kinetic energy scales in 2D materials opens up possibilities to selectively engineer heterostructures with properties that are dominated via many-body electronic interactions, ultra-strong spin-orbit interactions from heavier elements, electron-lattice interactions or electron-photon interactions, permitting realization of a wide range of novel correlated or topological phenomena.

        <p>With superconductivity [7,[41][42][43], correlated insulators [8,42,43] and the quantum anomalous Hall effect [20,21] already realized experimentally, an intriguing possibility indicated by recent theoretical analyses is that repulsive interactions favor topological d + id instead of nodal d-wave pairing [44][45][46]. Such topological superconducting states are potentially relevant to topological quantum computing [47], and can be harnessed and controlled via tailored laser pulses [48].With superconductivity [7,[41][42][43], correlated insulators [8,42,43] and the quantum anomalous Hall effect [20,21] already realized experimentally, an intriguing possibility indicated by recent theoretical analyses is that repulsive interactions favor topological d + id instead of nodal d-wave pairing [44][45][46].

        <p>Expanding the catalog of engineered lattice structures, we next consider twisting two monolayers of MoS 2 [23]. In these structures families of flat bands emerge at the band edges, the first two of which realizes a single orbital Hubbard model while the second realizes a more exotic strongly asymmetric p x -p y Hubbard model [23] both on the Honeycomb lattice, see inner circle of Fig. 1. The latter emerges at small twist angle, where the overall band width of these families of flat bands is tuned into the meV regime. Due to destructive interference within the strongly asymmetric p x -p y Hubbard model itself (meaning that the two-orbitals have very different hopping amplitudes), attached at the bottom and top of these flat bands one can find bands with even much lower dispersion. The asymmetric p x -p y Hubbard model is therefore another lattice Hamiltonian that can effectively be engineered in this solid-state framework, and also controlled by external parameters, such as strain or fields. This could provide interesting insights into highly degenerate systems and the interplay of magnetism with these type of band structures.

        <p>A natural extensions of TBG involves two twisted sheets of boron nitride (BN), which is often called white graphene for its structural similarity and large band gap. When twisting two BN sheets, the consequences are even more dramatic; while in graphene the quenching of the kinetic energy scales relies on being closed to a set of magic angles, in BN three families of flat band emerge, where the flattening of the bands is a monotonous function of twist angle. The effective lattice structure that is engineered at low enough twist angle is effectively triangular [36,50].A natural extensions of TBG involves two twisted sheets of boron nitride (BN), which is often called white graphene for its structural similarity and large band gap.

        <p>A similar engineered lattice structure is obtained by twisting two sheets of tungsten diselenide WSe 2 [29] or other transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures [30,31]. In all these cases a superstructure emerges which effectively confines the low energy physics onto a triangular lattice. In these TMD systems the mass of the atoms might force a strong spin-orbit coupling onto the low-energy degree of freedom, which can induce interesting topological properties.A similar engineered lattice structure is obtained by twisting two sheets of tungsten diselenide WSe 2 [29] or other transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures [30,31].

        <p>Indeed, in the case of the TMD homobilayers, features consistent with a superconducting phases (with more experimental evidence for a truly superconducting state still being desirable) have already been seen in close proximity to the insulating phase [29]. An advantage of these materials is that the angular precision needed in order for the emergence of new quantum phases is not as stringent as in graphene, so samples are easier to produce. However, the quality of the constituent materials tends to be poorer, and might need to be improved to allow a well-controlled realization of the model hamiltonians and phenomena described in Table I and Fig. 1.Indeed, in the case of the TMD homobilayers, features consistent with a superconducting phases (with more experimental evidence for a truly superconducting state still being desirable) have already been seen in close proximity to the insulating phase [29].

        <p>While all of the examples above build on stacking monolayers with a three-fold (120 • ) rotational symmetric lattice structure this is certainly not the only interesting scenario that one can consider. To illustrate this we next turn our attention to twisted bilayer germanium selenide (GeSe) [37] or similarly germanium sulfide (GeS). Monolayer GeSe has a rectangular unit cell with a 180 • rotational symmetry. When two sheets of GeSe are twisted, a similar quenching of the kinetic energy scales can be found as in the above discussed cases, however the effective lattice structure realized by such a system is a square lattice at small angles of 8 • -15 • while at lower angles the hopping in one of the principal directions is reduced much more strongly than the corresponding hopping along the second principal direction. At about 6 • the effective lattice system realized is entirely dispersion-less along one direction while it has a residual (though small due to the band narrowing at small angles) dispersion along the second one; see inner circle of Fig. 1. Thus twist angle provides a control knob to tune the system from effectively two-dimensional to effectively one-dimensional low energy physics, providing new insights into this fundamental and poorly understood problem.While all of the examples above build on stacking monolayers with a three-fold (120 • ) rotational symmetric lattice structure this is certainly not the only interesting scenario that one can consider.

        <p>The first steps on the road to making Moiré heterostructures was established by mechanically stacking two monolayers [62] of graphene and hBN to make high quality graphene layers for transport measurements. Due to the natural lattice mismatch between graphene and hBN, such structures naturally featured Moiré textures [60]. The most successful technique to realize twisted bilayer systems is the "tear and stack" method and its variants [63] . This technique essentially separates a single monolayer into two pieces, which are then naturally aligned with each other. One of the pieces is picked up, rotated by the desired angle and stacked with the second piece to create the desired Moiré structure. This simple and elegant technique has so far proved to be the most productive method, but has its limitations in reproducibility and uniformity of the Moiré patterns produced (other techniques such as pushing with an atomic force microscopy tip [64] or introducing heteorostrain [65] have been developed). The development of techniques to measure the wavelength and uniformity of the Moiré patterns in-situ are promising developments in the search to create the high-quality and precise Moiré structures that we are discussing here.The first steps on the road to making Moiré heterostructures was established by mechanically stacking two monolayers [62] of graphene and hBN to make high quality graphene layers for transport measurements.

        <p>Moiré structures present two great advantages for experiments in comparison to traditional solid state materials. The first is that the size of the "lattice" is expanded from the atomic scale to several nanometers, allowing optical and near-field techniques to directly probe the local spectroscopic properties of the system, in close analogy with the quantum gas microscope invented in the case of cold atomic gases. The second advantage is in their intrinsic two-dimensional nature, which makes it possible to measure the properties of the entire sample with surface-sensitive spectroscopic probes such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) or angle-resolved photoemission. This does come with its disadvantages however, since many traditional spectroscopic probes applied to solid state systems (neutron spectroscopy for example) produce signals that are proportional to the volume of the sample being measured, and are thus not easily applicable to these materials.Moiré structures present two great advantages for experiments in comparison to traditional solid state materials.

        <p>1. Alternating twist: When stacking many layers atop each other we want to define the twist angle of each layer to be measured with respect to the bottom one. Stacking two-dimensional materials at alternating twist then means that the twist angle alternates between two values: zero and α. If α is small, in-plane localized sites will emerge by the Moiré interference physics, and these sites will lie directly atop each other in the out-of-plane direction. The in-plane flat band states will become dispersive along the out-of-plane direction. Upon slight doping, the system thus becomes dominantly a one-dimensional metal with small residual inplane coupling by the residual dispersion of the flat bands, similar to what has been discussed for bulk TaS 2 [90]. Such a one-dimensional metal is susceptible to instabilities (such as CDW, SDW or excitonic instabilities) as a one-dimensional system is always perfectly nested. This will gap out the system along the out-of-plane direction and elevate the relevance of the small dispersion along the in-plane direction. A similar mechanism was recently observed to give rise to the 3D quantum Hall effect in bulk ZrTe 5 [91] and similar fascinating surprises might be expected in the alternating twist configuration we propose here.1.

Calculations to characterize such a system are challenging as the unit cell w.r.t. the inplane direction grows huge or a quasi-crystal structure with no unit cell emerges when more and more layers are added.

This, along with the lack of spin-valley polarization of the electron, will result in a net spin polarization, and thus, a real magnetic moment with the potential to induce novel non-equilibrium quantum phases.3.

        <p>Moiré platforms also provide a basic infrastructure for achieving different interlayer exciton phases and excitonic lattices [see Fig. 1]. In particular, bilayers of TMDs were identified (even without twist) as intriguing candidates because the long lifetime of these charge-separated interlayer excitons [105][106][107] should facilitate their condensation [108]. Adding twist angle allows to realize Moiré exciton lattices [33,35,73,109,110] which can feature topological exciton bands that support chiral excitonic edge states [111]. The high degree of control permits study of the study the localized-delocalized crossover of excitons in Moiré lattices as well as a strain induced crossover from 2D to 1D exciton physics [112]. Minimizing the kinetic energy to increase interactions is key to achieving robust condensation. E.g. twisted WSe 2 homobilayers have tunable flat electronic bands over a range of twist angles (see above), with alternatives including experimentally accessible heterobilayers as well as strain and pressure engineering. Two such band-engineered TMDs separated by a uniform spacer layer (hBN) [35] will likely provide the best avenue to achieve exciton condensation in zero applied field and to then tune the properties of the condensate by gating, field, pressure and strain. Future strategies to enhance the tendencies of excitons to condensate beyond the use of twist angle to achieve flat bands and thus more prominent interactions could also include the use of cavity structures to enhance light-matter interaction (see Fig. 1).

Here, pump-probe nano-optical methods can both address and interrogate distinct regions in Moiré heterostructures [77].</p>
        <p>Skyrmions -vortex-like magnetic configurations -can arise as a spontaneously formed hexagonal lattice in the ground state of chiral magnets, or as quasi-particle excitations on top of a ferromagnetic ground state. The energetic stability of skyrmions is a consequence of an antisymmetric exchange (also called Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya) interaction and they are interesting due to their nontrivial topological structure protecting them against perturbations and rendering them highly attractive as potential memory devices. One candidate systems for which skyrmions have been predicted is monolayer CrI 3 [113]. In the realm of twisted magnetic van der Waals heterostructures Moiré skyrmion lattices are favored due to the long-period Moiré pattern, which can be used to tune the periodicity and shape of the magnetization texture. In addition, an external magnetic field can be used to switch the vorticity and location of skyrmions.Skyrmions -vortex-like magnetic configurations -can arise as a spontaneously formed hexagonal lattice in the ground state of chiral magnets, or as quasi-particle excitations on top of a ferromagnetic ground state.

        <p>Here, we identified future directions of research into the blossoming fields of twisted van der Waals heterostructures with a particular emphasis on the high-degree of control achievable in these materials. Controlled engineering of quantum Hamiltonians as tunable low-energy theories of these structures is at the forefront of this fascinating research field. This idea might be viewed as a condensed matter realization of a quantum simulator in the future, which allows to directly access fundamental properties of quantum many-body systems, such as the delicate emergent physics of novel collective phases of matter, which have been experimentally elusive so far. In this sense twisted van der Waals heterostructures might be the long-sought after remedy to access the wider phase space, which should include all kinds of fundamentally and technologically relevant phases of matter. One of the major experimental challenges to be overcome next is to devise read-out techniques of the magnetic properties in these systems as well as to push the precision of angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy into the regime where it can resolve the physics within the small Brillouin zone of twisted heterostructures reliably. Both of these advances would provide cornerstones allowing to interrogate the low-energy physics of the system with regards to its interacting properties more completely. Considering the tremendous combinatorial space of van der Waals materials to chose from, extensions to higher dimensions and the vibrant field of non-equilibrium control, including Floquet engineering and twist-tronics applied to these novel platforms, it is likely that only a small fraction of the potential phenomena achievable in twisted van der Waals heterostructures have been experimentally realized so far. This newly emerging research field is likely to yield many more exciting development.Here, we identified future directions of research into the blossoming fields of twisted van der Waals heterostructures with a particular emphasis on the high-degree of control achievable in these materials.
