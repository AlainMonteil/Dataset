        <p>The Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY) is a next-generation survey of neutral hydrogen (H I) in the Local Universe. It uses the widefield, high-resolution capability of the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), a radio interferometer consisting of 36 × 12-m dishes equipped with Phased-Array Feeds (PAFs), located in an extremely radioquiet zone in Western Australia. WALLABY aims to survey three-quarters of the sky (-90 • &lt; δ &lt; +30 • ) to a redshift of z 0.26, and generate spectral line image cubes at ∼30 arcsec resolution and ∼1.6 mJy beam -1 per 4 km s -1 channel sensitivity. ASKAP's instantaneous field of view at 1.4 GHz, delivered by the PAF's 36 beams, is about 30 sq deg. At an integrated signal-to-noise ratio of five, WALLABY is expected to detect around half a million galaxies with a mean redshift of z ∼ 0.05 (∼200 Mpc). The scientific goals of WALLABY include: (a) a census of gas-rich galaxies in the vicinity of the Local Group; (b) a study of the H I properties of galaxies, groups and clusters, in particular the influence of the environment on galaxy evolution; and (c) the refinement of cosmological parameters using the spatial and redshift distribution of low-bias gas-rich galaxies. For context we provide an overview of recent and planned large-scale H I surveys. Combined with existing and new multi-wavelength sky surveys, WALLABY will enable an exciting new generation of panchromatic studies of the Local Universe. -First results from the WALLABY pilot survey are revealed, with initial data products publicly available in the CSIRO ASKAP Science Data Archive (CASDA).The Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY) is a next-generation survey of neutral hydrogen (H I) in the Local Universe.

        <p>Hydrogen is the lightest chemical element in the periodic table and the most abundant in the Universe. While hydrogen makes up about 75% of the baryonic mass, it constitutes only a tiny fraction of the overall mass-energy budget. The latter is thought to be dominated by dark matter (26.2%) and dark energy (68.9%) with baryons a mere 4.9% ( et al. 2018).Hydrogen is the lightest chemical element in the periodic table and the most abundant in the Universe.

        <p>Galactic and extragalactic hydrogen is found in three primary phases: neutral molecular (H 2 ), neutral atomic (H I) and ionized (H II). As the Universe evolved, hydrogen underwent two major phase transitions, first from ionized to neutral (recombination) and then from neutral back to ionized (reionization). At present, the cosmological mass density of H I, HI , is only ∼0.04% (Zwaan et al. 2003(Zwaan et al. , 2005)).Galactic and extragalactic hydrogen is found in three primary phases: neutral molecular (H 2 ), neutral atomic (H I) and ionized (H II).

        <p>The 21-cm line of hydrogen (H I) provides the means to study the formation and evolution of galaxies and largescale structures, unobscured by dust and foreground stars, from the 'Dark Ages' to the Local Universe. This hyperfine line results from the electron spin-flip in the electronic ground state of the hydrogen atom; its rest frequency is 1420.40575177 MHz, corresponding to a wavelength of 21.106 cm. The line was predicted by H.C. van de Hulst in 1944 (see van de Hulst 1945), first observed by Ewen and Purcell (1951) and confirmed by Muller and Oort (1951). Kerr et al. (1954) made the first extragalactic H I detection of the Magellanic Clouds.The 21-cm line of hydrogen (H I) provides the means to study the formation and evolution of galaxies and largescale structures, unobscured by dust and foreground stars, from the 'Dark Ages' to the Local Universe.

        <p>While all forms of hydrogen are typically detected in the inner discs and spiral arms of galaxies in the Local Universe, most often it is the H I 21-cm line that reveals the outermost regions of galaxy discs (e.g., Warren et al. 2004;Begum et al. 2005;Sancisi et al. 2008;Heald et al. 2011;Koribalski et al. 2018). Occasionally H I is found in filaments, plumes and/or bridges, tracing the gravitational interactions with neighbouring galaxies (e.g., Yun et al. 1993Yun et al. , 1994;;Koribalski et al. 2003;Koribalski and Dickey 2004;Pearson et al. 2016) and in groups/clusters (e.g., Verdes-Montenegro et al. 2001;Oosterloo and van Gorkom 2005;Chung et al. 2009;English et al. 2010;Lee-Waddell et al. 2012;Hess et al. 2017;Scott et al. 2018;Saponara et al. 2018). Beyond the inner galaxy disk in which molecular hydrogen is typically the dominant gas component (Leroy et al. 2008;Bigiel and Blitz 2012), H I is also an excellent tracer of star formation in the outer discs of galaxies (e.g., Battaglia et al. 2006;Koribalski and López-Sánchez 2009;For et al. 2012;Koribalski 2017). The large extent of H I discs in many late-and early-type galaxies, compared to their stellar discs (e.g., Meurer et al. 1996;Begum et al. 2005;Serra et al. 2012a;Bosma 2017), makes them highly susceptible to external forces such as tidal interactions, gas accretion, and ram pressure stripping, while providing fuel for star formation. As a consequence, the amount and extent of H I in galaxies varies significantly with environment (e.g., Chung et al. 2009;Cortese et al. 2011;Catinella et al. 2013;Dénes et al. 2014;Stevens and Brown 2017;Jones et al. 2018a). Furthermore, the H I kinematics of galaxies, which are typically measured with high accuracy (several km s -1 ), can be used to derive their rotation curves as well as noncircular motions, if present. The shape, amplitude and extent of galaxy rotation curves allow detailed modelling of a galaxy's overall mass distribution as a function of radius (e.g., van Albada et al. 1985;Carignan and Freeman 1985;de Blok et al. 2008;Oh et al. 2008Oh et al. , 2018)).While all forms of hydrogen are typically detected in the inner discs and spiral arms of galaxies in the Local Universe, most often it is the H I 21-cm line that reveals the outermost regions of galaxy discs (e.g., Warren et al. 2004;Begum et al. 2005;Sancisi et al. 2008;Heald et al. 2011;Koribalski et al. 2018).

        <p>One of the highest redshift detections in H I emission from an individual galaxy, obtained in the COSMOS H I Large Extragalactic Survey (CHILES), is at z = 0.376 (Fernandez et al. 2016), well surpassing previous detections at z ∼ 0.2 (Zwaan et al. 2001;Verheijen et al. 2007;Catinella et al. 2008;Catinella and Cortese 2015). Recently, H I emission from a strongly lensed galaxy at z = 0.407 has been marginally detected by Blecher et al. (2019). The dearth of detections at high redshift is mainly due to the intrinsic weakness of the 21-cm emission line, but is also affected by the available frequency ranges (e.g., Hess et al. 2019), the presence of radio frequency interference (RFI), and limited observing time on current radio telescopes. To overcome these limitations, some pioneering research was conducted using H I spectral stacking (e.g., Chengalur et al. 2001) and H I intensity mapping techniques (e.g., Pen et al. 2009;Anderson et al. 2018) which are now routinely used for z &gt; 0.3 H I galaxy studies. The first detection (4σ ) of H I in emission at z ≈ 0.8 was obtained by cross-correlating H I intensity maps with optical density maps generated using ∼10 000 optically identified galaxies with known, accurate redshifts (Chang et al. 2010; see also Khandai et al. 2011). H I absorption is another way to probe the neutral component of the interstellar medium (ISM) and the intergalactic medium (IGM) towards bright radio sources in the background. Rhee et al. (2018) nicely summarize the H I gas density measurements obtained from H I and Damped Lyα (DLA) measurements.One of the highest redshift detections in H I emission from an individual galaxy, obtained in the COSMOS H I Large Extragalactic Survey (CHILES), is at z = 0.376 (Fernandez et al. 2016), well surpassing previous detections at z ∼ 0.2 (Zwaan et al. 2001;Verheijen et al. 2007;Catinella et al. 2008;Catinella and Cortese 2015).

        <p>Although cold molecular hydrogen gas dominates the molecular ISM of galaxies, its lack of a dipole combined with the energy requirements of its rotational and vibrational transitions, make it essentially invisible in emission for temperatures below 100 K. Carbon monoxide (CO), the next most common molecule, which is easily excited by the UV radiation field coursing through the ISM, is the primary tracer of molecular gas mass. However, CO only acts as a proxy for molecular content and large uncertainties remain in the CO-to-H 2 conversion factor (e.g., Cormier et al. 2018). Only the densest pockets of the ISM, where the bulk of molecular gas resides, contain both H 2 and CO. Their immediate surroundings have a more complex composition, which is deeply influenced by ultraviolet radiation from nearby stars. Molecular hydrogen at temperatures above 100 K -excited by high-speed shocks, for example -is detectable in the near-and mid-infrared (Wong et al. 2014). Intergalactic H I gas in galaxy groups may even be transformed into molecular hydrogen during a collision with an intruder galaxy, as shown by Cluver et al. (2010) in Stephan's Quintet. By using Herschel observations of the 158 µm line of ionized carbon ([C II]) Pineda et al. (2013) show that CO-dark H 2 accounts for ∼30% of the Milky Way's entire reservoir of molecular gas.Although cold molecular hydrogen gas dominates the molecular ISM of galaxies, its lack of a dipole combined with the energy requirements of its rotational and vibrational transitions, make it essentially invisible in emission for temperatures below 100 K.

        <p>The most common way of tracing the ionized hydrogen gas (H II) is by observing the Hα emission line. Large-scale Hα surveys of nearby galaxies (e.g., Rossa and Dettmar 2003;James et al. 2004;Parker et al. 2005;Oey et al. 2007;Kennicutt et al. 2008) reveal that extraplanar diffuse ionized gas is correlated with the level of star formation activity. In galaxy clusters, Hα emission can be attributed to both star formation and shock-ionized gas (e.g., Sun et al. 2007;Kenney et al. 2008;Boselli et al. 2018aBoselli et al. , 2018b;;Fossati et al. 2018); see also Jáchym et al.

        <p>WALLABY builds on the long and rich history of blind H I sky surveys and is an important step towards future H I surveys with the Square Kilometer Array (SKA). One of its main advantages, compared to previous large-scale H I surveys, is the ability to spatially resolve thousands of nearby galaxies allowing us to study the physical processes shaping their discs and halos. WALLABY will make many discoveries -expected and unexpected -and, together with other SKA precursors and pathfinders, commence a new era of widefield and deep H I surveys.

        <p>H I is an ubiquitous tracer of large-scale structure in the Universe (e.g., Koribalski et al. 2004;Meyer et al. 2004;Springob et al. 2005;Papastergis et al. 2013;Kleiner et al. 2017;Hong et al. 2019), unimpeded by foreground dust and stars (Staveley-Smith et al. 2016). It is also an excellent tracer of the total mass in rotating disk galaxies (e.g., Bosma 1981aBosma , 1981b;;de Blok et al. 2008;Ott et al. 2012;Oh et al. 2018), the gas content of galaxies, and the gaseous structures in between galaxies. H I is an excellent probe of galaxy environments, allowing us to investigate the faint outer discs of galaxies, extended tidal features (such as tails, bridges, filaments) and dwarf companions (Hibbard et al. 2001;Sancisi et al. 2008;Heald et al. 2011;Serra et al. 2012a;Bosma 2017;Koribalski et al. 2018). Furthermore, H I allows us to study the physical and dynamical processes within galaxies, including the kinematic properties of structures such as bars, rings, spiral arms and warps (e.g., Verdes-Montenegro et al. 2002;Józsa et al. 2007;Spekkens and Sellwood 2007;Kamphuis et al. 2015;Di Teodoro and Fraternali 2015). Each galaxy's H I spectrum provides a large set of galaxy properties, such as the systemic velocity, the integrated flux and the velocity width (e.g., Koribalski et al. 2004). These are used to derive the galaxy distance, gas mass, and total dynamical mass, respectively. The shape of the integrated H I spectrum also reflects the overall galaxy symmetry, flatness of the rotation curve and presence of other H I components.H I is an ubiquitous tracer of large-scale structure in the Universe (e.g., Koribalski et al. 2004;Meyer et al. 2004;Springob et al. 2005;Papastergis et al. 2013;Kleiner et al. 2017;Hong et al. 2019), unimpeded by foreground dust and stars (Staveley-Smith et al. 2016).

        <p>The evolution of H I is of fundamental importance for understanding the build-up of both stellar and gas mass within galaxies as well as the method by which galaxies accrete their material (e.g., Athanassoula et al. 2016). It is a crucial window into galaxy formation over time to be explored with the next generation of large-scale H I surveys, spanning a significant fraction of cosmic look-back time. The latter will be carried out with new and upgraded radio interferometers, such as ASKAP (Johnston et al. 2007(Johnston et al. , 2008)), providing high spatial and spectral resolution as well as good point source and surface brightness sensitivity. ASKAP's frequency coverage (700 -1800 MHz) allows for H I studies out to redshift of z ∼ 1.The evolution of H I is of fundamental importance for understanding the build-up of both stellar and gas mass within galaxies as well as the method by which galaxies accrete their material (e.g., Athanassoula et al. 2016).

        <p>Multibeam receivers on large single-dish radio telescopes were built to advance studies of galaxy evolution by enabling large-area 21-cm surveys. First up was the 64-m Parkes Telescope, which in 1997 was equipped with a 13beam receiver system, now the second largest multibeam system worldwide (second only to the recently commissioned FAST 19-beam receiver; Li et al. 2018).

        <p>The development of the innovative Parkes 13-beam receiver system (T sys ≈ 20 K), coupled to a versatile correlator, instigated the era of large-scale 21-cm surveys of our Galaxy and the Local Universe. Among these, the 'H I Parkes All Sky Survey' (HIPASS) is the largest and most prominent, covering the whole southern sky and the northern sky to a declination limit of δ ≈ 25 • over a velocity range from -1280 to 12 700 km s -1 . The Parkes gridded beam is ∼15.5 arcmin, the velocity resolution is 18 km s -1 (with 4 arcmin pixel size and 13.2 km s -1 channel width) and the rms noise is ∼13 mJy beam -1 per channel for a typical integration time of eight minutes. A detailed description of the HIPASS observations, calibration and imaging techniques is given in Barnes et al. (2001). Current galaxy catalogues include the 'HIPASS Bright Galaxy Catalog' (HIPASS BGC; Koribalski et al. 2004; see Fig. 1), the southern HIPASS catalogue (Meyer et al. 2004) and the northern HIPASS catalogue (Wong et al. 2006). Together these catalogues, which are highly reliable (Zwaan et al. 2004), contain more than 5 500 H I-rich galaxies and a few extragalactic H I clouds. Detailed studies of the H I mass function are presented by Zwaan et al. (2003Zwaan et al. ( , 2005)).

        <p>The large majority of catalogued H I sources have been identified with optical counterparts (Koribalski et al. 2004;Doyle et al. 2005;Wong et al. 2009).

It is expected to detect around half a million galaxies in H I (Johnston et al. 2008;Duffy et al. 2012aDuffy et al. , 2012b)). Technical details are given in Sect. 4 and Table 1, the main science goals are described in Sect. 5, and the WALLABY Early Science and pilot programs are summarized in Sect. 6. longer. The second phase is proposed to consist of two ultra-deep fields, i.e., 60 sq deg in total, over the redshift range z = 0.1 -0.43. The ultra-deep DINGO fields will probe the evolution of H I over the last five billion years of cosmic time with a predicted total of ∼10 000 galaxies (Johnston et al. 2008;Duffy et al. 2012aDuffy et al. , 2012b)). The target fields were selected to overlap with the 'Galaxy and Mass Assembly' (GAMA; Driver et al. 2011Driver et al. , 2016) ) survey. • FLASH ('First Large Absorption Survey in H I') has two components: one is commensal with WALLABY, exploring associated and intervening H I absorption at low redshifts (z 0.26), the other is at redshifts 0.4 -1.0 (∼2 h integration time per field at 0.7 -1.0 GHz), expecting to detect and parametrize several hundred H I absorption lines towards bright radio continuum sources (Allison et al. 2015). • GASKAP ('Galactic ASKAP H I Survey') plans to study H I and OH lines in the Galactic Plane (for |b| &lt; 10 • ), the Magellanic Clouds and the Magellanic Stream at a velocity resolution of 0.25 km s -1 (Dickey et al. 2013).

The second phase is proposed to consist of two ultra-deep fields, i.e., 60 sq deg in total, over the redshift range z = 0.1 -0.43. The ultra-deep DINGO fields will probe the evolution of H I over the last five billion years of cosmic time with a predicted total of ∼10 000 galaxies (Johnston et al. 2008;Duffy et al. 2012aDuffy et al. , 2012b)). The target fields were selected to overlap with the 'Galaxy and Mass Assembly' (GAMA; Driver et al. 2011Driver et al. , 2016) ) survey. • FLASH ('First Large Absorption Survey in H I') has two components: one is commensal with WALLABY, exploring associated and intervening H I absorption at low redshifts (z 0.26), the other is at redshifts 0.4 -1.0 (∼2 h integration time per field at 0.7 -1.0 GHz), expecting to detect and parametrize several hundred H I absorption lines towards bright radio continuum sources (Allison et al. 2015). • GASKAP ('Galactic ASKAP H I Survey') plans to study H I and OH lines in the Galactic Plane (for |b| &lt; 10 • ), the Magellanic Clouds and the Magellanic Stream at a velocity resolution of 0.25 km s -1 (Dickey et al. 2013). Within the proposed 7.3 MHz band, centered on the Galactic H I line, GASKAP will also detect nearby, gas-rich galaxies. Its high velocity resolution benefits detailed kinematical modelling of nearby low-mass dwarf galaxies.</p>

        <p>Twelve of the fourteen 25-m WSRT dishes have been equipped with Vivaldi PAFs, known as Apertif, providing 8 sq deg field-of-view and an effective system temperature of ∼70 K at 1.4 GHz (Oosterloo et al. 2010); the maximum angular resolution will be 15 arcsec. Survey observations started on 1 July 2019.

        <p>The H I science case for Apertif is very similar to that of ASKAP and a number of projects are planned with similar aims as those planned for ASKAP. In particular, the search for very low H I mass galaxies in the nearby Universe, the role of the environment in galaxy evolution, and the H I properties of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are the main focus areas. Some differences in survey strategy exist compared to ASKAP, however.The H I science case for Apertif is very similar to that of ASKAP and a number of projects are planned with similar aims as those planned for ASKAP.

        <p>Similar to ASKAP, a large-area, shallow Apertif H I survey is carried out. With 12 h per pointing it aims to map a large part (∼3 500 sq degr) of the northern sky (δ &gt; +27 • ), and together with WALLABY, will provide an all-sky survey (Koribalski 2012a).

The main scientific drivers are to explore the H I mass function down to a minimum H I mass of 2 × 10 5 M , to analyse in detail the extended morphologies and kinematics of the H I in and around galaxies as a function of environment, and to determine the cosmic evolution of the gas content of galaxies over the past 3 Gyr.In addition, a medium-deep H I survey will be done to push the H I column density well below 10 20 cm -2 .

        <p>ASKAP 2 consists of 36 × 12-m antennas, located near Boolardy station in the Murchison Shire of Western Australia. For a detailed description of this new radio interferometer (see Fig. 4) and key survey science areas see Johnston et al. (2007Johnston et al. ( , 2008)). All ASKAP antennas are equipped with widefield Phased Array Feeds (PAFs; see Fig. 2) delivering a field-of view of 30 sq deg, making ASKAP a fast 21-cm survey machine. From March 2014 to early 2016, six ASKAP antennas with first-generation PAFs were working together, leading to the first widefield continuum imaging and spectral line studies (Serra et al. 2015a;Heywood et al. 2016). This configuration is known as BETA, the Boolardy Engineering Test Array (Hotan et al. 2014;Mc-Connell et al. 2016). In Oct 2016 the WALLABY team officially commenced ASKAP Early Science, initially using an 2 https://www.atnf.csiro.au/projects/askap/news.html. Each ASKAP dish has been equipped with a Mk II Chequerboard PAF, providing a ∼30 sq deg field of view and covering a frequency range from 700 to 1800 MHz. While the PAF system temperature, T sys , is close to 50 K at 1.4 GHz, the antenna efficiency, η, is ∼0.7, resulting in an effective system temperature of T sys /η ∼ 70 K. Tests are un- der way on increasing the antenna efficiency by, e.g., installing radio-transparent (fibreglass) feed legs on one antenna. The ASKAP hardware correlator has a nominal bandwidth of 300 MHz,3 divided into 16 200 channels. The large 5.5 • × 5.5 • field is achieved by forming 36 overlapping beams (FWHM ∼ 1 • ) from the 188 PAF dipole elements (Chippendale et al. 2014).ASKAP 2 consists of 36 × 12-m antennas, located near Boolardy station in the Murchison Shire of Western Australia.

        <p>Engineering and system commissioning as well as a variety of early science projects led to a step-by-step deployment of the full ASKAP telescope, the custom-made, real-time data processing pipeline (
            <rs type="software">ASKAPsoft</rs>; Whiting et al. 2017) and the dedicated CSIRO ASKAP Science Data Archive (CASDA 4 ). 
            <rs type="software">ASKAPsoft</rs> is deployed on the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre in Perth and used to (a) ingest the large volumes of ASKAP data, (b) produce image cubes after data flagging, calibration and line-continuum separation, and (c) run the 
            <rs type="software">Selavy</rs> source finder (Whiting and Humphreys 2012) to produce the initial bright-source catalogues. The expected data volume for WALLABY is ∼10 TB per hour: (a) cross-correlations (630 baselines × 36 beams × 4 polarizations × 16 200 channels every 5 seconds) and (b) auto-correlations (36 antennas × 36 beams × 4 polarizations × 16 200 channels every 5 seconds).

            <rs type="software">ASKAPsoft</rs> pipeline using 
            <rs type="software">ASKAP</rs> early science and more recently pilot survey data, with the aim to perform reliable, robust and real-time data processing once our survey gets under way. Currently we are comparing 'robust' and 'natural' weighting of the ASKAP-36 uv-data, Gaussian tapers, followed by multi-scale clean (BasisFunction or Basis-FunctionMFS) and deep clean of the identified components; for details see Kleiner et al.

        <p>The proposed WALLABY parameters, as compared to HIPASS, are listed in Table 1, updated from a similar table in a previous WALLABY paper (Koribalski 2012b). Our aim is to reach a rms noise of 1.6 mJy beam -1 per 4 km s -1 , allowing us to detect and characterize around 500 000 galaxies in Fig. 6 Spatial distribution of the mock WALLABY galaxies from the simulation that lie within 15 degrees of the plane defined by RA ∈ {0 h, 12 h}. The distance limit of D c = 1082.6 Mpc corresponds to a cosmological redshift of z = 0.26 in the Planck-type cosmology adopted in SURFS (see Elahi et al. 2018). The corresponding maximum volumes of the two largest existing blind H I surveys, HIPASS and ALFALFA are shown in coloured shading. Note that WALLABY and HIPASS cover all RAs, whereas ALFALFA was limited to two RA windows, collectively covering 210 • in RA the proposed survey volume.

        <p>WALLABY will cover 75% of the sky (-90 • &lt; δ &lt; +30 • ; see Figs. 3 &amp;6) to a redshift of z 0.26, equivalent to a look-back time of ∼3 Gyr. The corresponding cosmic volume of the survey is 3.26 Gpc 3 . Based on the nominal ASKAP bandwidth of 300 MHz, we chose a frequency range of 1.13 to 1.43 GHz, corresponding to a velocity range of -2000 &lt; cz &lt; 77, 000 km s -1 . Dividing the survey area by the PAF 30 sq deg footprint suggests we need at least 1000 pointings. To maximise survey uniformity and tiling efficiency a number of strategies were explored; one of the solutions, shown in Fig. 3, requires 1120 pointings. We aim to minimize solar sidelobes and satellite interference, as far as possible, and will target complex fields (e.g., containing very bright and extended continuum sources) at night. To achieve uniform sky coverage with the ASKAP PAFs, strategies such as dithering (e.g., Reynolds et al. 2019;Lee-Waddell et al. 2019;Kleiner et al. 2019) and mosaicking of neighbouring fields are also explored. This is necessary because the 36 beams (each ∼1 • FWMH) formed to give a ∼30 sq deg field, do not provide Nyquist sampling of the sky. The final strategy will depend strongly on the ASKAP PAF performance (including shape and beam to beam variations; see Hotan et al. 2020, andMcConnell et al. 2020), RFI occupancy and computing considerations.

        <p>To achieve the WALLABY science goals, we aim to reach an rms noise of 1.6 mJy per 30-arcsec beam and 18.52-kHz channel (∼4 km s -1 at z = 0). Based on the currently available measurement of T sys /η = 70 K, we estimate an integration time of 16 h per WALLABY field. This is typically split into 2 × 8 h with interleaved footprints of the 36 PAF beams. For the northern most fields, 4 × 4 h integrations will be required. WALLABY will detect dwarf galaxies (M HI = 10 8 M ) out to a distance of ∼60 Mpc, massive galaxies (M HI = 6 × 10 9 M ) to ∼500 Mpc, and supermassive galaxies such as Malin 1 (M HI = 5 × 10 10 M ) to the survey 'edge' of 1 Gpc (see Figs. 6789). See Table 2 for M HI estimates for different galaxy velocity widths and two H I sizes. At large distances, &lt;1.3 GHz (&gt;400 Mpc), increasing satellite RFI will (much) reduce the detectability of H I sources. See Table 3 for the impact on the numbers of predicted WALLABY detections.

        <p>The first simulations of source counts for extragalactic H I surveys with ASKAP (Johnston et al. 2008) were empirically-based and used the H I mass function derived from HIPASS by Zwaan et al. (2003Zwaan et al. ( , 2005)). Using an angular resolution of 60 arcsec, they estimated that ∼600 000 galaxies would be detected in H I over one hemisphere. In the WALLABY proposal (Koribalski et al. 2009) we estimated that around half a million galaxies will be detected in the full 3π sr survey area (assuming an angular resolution of 30 arcsec). Obreschkow et al. (2009b) and Duffy et al. (2012aDuffy et al. ( , 2012b) ) presented predictions for the expected galaxy counts from more sophisticated models of galaxy formation and also investigated the spatial, velocity and mass distributions of galaxies and their H I diameters. Duffy et al. showed that the majority of WALLABY galaxies (86%) will be resolved by more than one beam. About 5 000 galaxies will have major-axis H I diameters greater than 2.5 arcmin (&gt; 5 beams), enabling kinematic studies of their gaseous discs (see Sect. 5.3). This number would rise to 1.6 × 10 5 galaxies if all baselines up to 6 km could be used, resulting in an improved angular resolution of ∼10 arcsec. Although these models provided a clear improvement over previous, empirical estimates, they were still based on the post-processing of existing galaxy formation models that treated the ISM of galaxies as a single phase. Hence, it is fit to update these predictions using state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulations that model the multi-phase nature of the ISM in a selfconsistent way.The first simulations of source counts for extragalactic H I surveys with ASKAP (Johnston et al. 2008) were empirically-based and used the H I mass function derived from HIPASS by Zwaan et al.

This number would rise to 1.6 × 10 5 galaxies if all baselines up to 6 km could be used, resulting in an improved angular resolution of ∼10 arcsec. Although these models provided a clear improvement over previous, empirical estimates, they were still based on the post-processing of existing galaxy formation models that treated the ISM of galaxies as a single phase. Hence, it is fit to update these predictions using state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulations that model the multi-phase nature of the ISM in a selfconsistent way.</p>
        <p>Here, we present a new WALLABY reference simulation that provides a mock catalog of a perfect WALLABY survey able to detect all galaxies whose integrated H I signalto-noise lies 5 times above the WALLABY target noise level (i.e., S/N &gt; 5). This simulation relies on the 'Synthetic Uni-veRses For Surveys' (SURFS) simulations of cosmic structure (Elahi et al. 2018), the SHARK semi-analytic model of galaxy evolution (Lagos et al. 2018) and the STINGRAY mock sky builder (Obreschkow et al., in prep.). This threestep approach is conceptually identical to that of Chauhan et al. (2019), used for the ALFALFA survey. To cover the full dynamic range of H I masses, the reference simulation concatenates two cubic simulation boxes with volumes of 40 3 h -1 Mpc (micro-SURFS) and 210 3 h -1 Mpc (medi-SURFS), respectively (where h = 0.6751). The catalogue transitions seamlessly from the smaller to the larger box at a comoving distance of 60 h -1 Mpc, chosen as a compromise between the requirements for high resolution in the nearby Universe and the desire to minimise replications of identical cosmic structure. For each galaxy in the simulation, multi-component rotation curves were produced and convolved with the pressure-based surface density distribution of H I (following Obreschkow et al. 2009a) in order to produce realistic H I line profiles. In doing so, we assumed a constant line-ofsight velocity dispersion of σ = 10 km s -1 . The projected surface density profiles and H I line profiles were then used to compute the (integer) number of beams and channels each source subtends in WALLABY assuming a circular beam of 30 arcsec diameter and 4 km s -1 channels (see Table 1). Using those parameters and an assumed channel noise of 1.6 mJy per beam, all galaxies with an integrated (over all beams and channels) signal-to-noise ratio greater than five were selected.Here, we present a new WALLABY reference simulation that provides a mock catalog of a perfect WALLABY survey able to detect all galaxies whose integrated H I signalto-noise lies 5 times above the WALLABY target noise level (i.e., S/N &gt; 5).

        <p>Five random realisations of the reference simulation are available, which allow a rough estimate of cosmic variance and shot noise statistics. The total number of galaxies in these simulations predicted to be detectable by WALLABY is 490 000 ± 6 000 (1σ interval). This number -in the absence of any RFI -is consistent with the ∼500 000 detections es-timated in the original WALLABY proposal (Koribalski et al. 2009).Five random realisations of the reference simulation are available, which allow a rough estimate of cosmic variance and shot noise statistics.

        <p>Figure 7 depicts some basic statistics. In the left-hand panel we present H I mass versus distance of the galaxies expected to be detected by WALLABY. The simulation predicts that WALLABY will detect several thousand galaxies with H I masses below 10 8 M . Very few galaxies with H I masses &gt; 10 11 M will be detected by WALLABY. The right-hand panel of Fig. 7 shows that the survey will be biased towards (Doyle et al. 2005); the H I diameters in (h) were inferred from the H I size-mass relation by Wang et al. (2016). Red lines have different meanings in different panels: (a) transition between small and large simulation box; (c) smallest possible line width (W 50 = 23.5 km s -1 ) implied by the intrinsic velocity dispersion of 10 km s -1 ; (f) halo mass resolution limit of the two simulation boxes; (g) chosen minimum integrated S/N for blind H I detections H I-rich galaxies, relative to stellar mass, as expected for any blind 21 cm survey.Figure 7 depicts some basic statistics.

        <p>In Fig. 8 we present the predicted distributions of WAL- LABY detections for several important observational parameters: redshift z, H I mass (M HI ), velocity width (W 50 ), stellar mass (M star ), number of WALLABY beams over the galaxy H I disc, halo mass (M vir ), integrated signal-to-noise (S/N), galaxy H I diameter, inclination and bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio (B/T ). While covering the redshift range of z &lt; 0.26, detections are expected to peak at z ∼ 0.03, with a median redshift across the entire sample of z ∼ 0.045 (see also Table 3). The different sensitivities of WALLABY, HIPASS and ALFALFA naturally imply different redshift distributions. In particular, due to its large redshift coverage and moderate sensitivity, WALLABY will be sensitivity-limited up to the highest H I masses. In turn, HIPASS and ALFALFA were only sensitivity-limited for H I masses of &lt; 10 10 M (roughly M * HI ), but redshift-limited (i.e., volume-limited) for higher masses. This explains the deficit of H I masses above this limit in HIPASS and ALFALFA.In Fig. 8 we present the predicted distributions of WAL- LABY detections for several important observational parameters: redshift z, H I mass (M HI ), velocity width (W 50 ), stellar mass (M star ), number of WALLABY beams over the galaxy H I disc, halo mass (M vir ), integrated signal-to-noise (S/N), galaxy H I diameter, inclination and bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio (B/T ).

        <p>The predicted halo mass distribution (Fig. 8f) has a complex shape due to the mixing of central and satellites galaxies, as well as due to the simulation resolution limits at low halo masses (red vertical lines). Interestingly, WAL- LABY will detect a large number (∼350 000) of galaxies in low-mass haloes (&lt; 10 11 M ), where the halo mass function is poorly constrained. For instance, the halo masses inferred from the GAMA group catalogue only extend down to masses of ≈ 5 × 10 12 M (e.g., Yang et al. 2007;Robotham et al. 2011;Eckert et al. 2017). Upon assuming that H I line profiles and/or line widths provide sufficient information to estimate even low halo masses, WALLABY will thus be transformational in its ability to constrain the low-mass end of the halo mass function.The predicted halo mass distribution (Fig. 8f) has a complex shape due to the mixing of central and satellites galaxies, as well as due to the simulation resolution limits at low halo masses (red vertical lines).

            <rs type="software">Source Finding Application (SoFiA</rs>; Serra et al. 2015b) combines a range of different filtering, source-finding and parametrization algorithms that will be fine-tuned to produce highly complete and reliable WALLABY source catalogues. Most importantly, 
            <rs type="software">SoFiA</rs> comes with a built-in reliability estimator based on comparing the number of negative and positive detections in different regions of parameter space (Serra et al. 2012b(Serra et al. , 2015b)). By setting a suitable reliability threshold, 
            <rs type="software">SoFiA</rs> can automatically remove unreliable detections such as noise peaks to produce a clean source catalog. 
            <rs type="software">SoFiA</rs> produces a range of useful outputs, including H I moment maps, source masks, integrated spectra and position-velocity diagrams. Several 2D and 3D source-finding algorithms are discussed in the 
            <rs type="software">PASA</rs> Special Issue on "Source finding and visualisation" (Koribalski 2012a(Koribalski , 2012b)).
        </p>
        <p>Furthermore, 
            <rs type="software">SoFiA</rs> also provides sophisticated algorithms for the accurate extraction of source parameters. This includes mask optimization algorithms that will automatically grow source masks to ensure that they cover the full spatial and spectral extent of the source. This will help to minimize biases in the calculation of the integrated flux density of a source that would naturally result from applying a source-finding threshold to noisy data. 
            <rs type="software">SoFiA</rs> can also fit the Busy Function (Westmeier et al. 2014) to the integrated spectrum of a source to extract accurate parameters. The Busy Function is capable of fitting a wide range of H I spectral profiles commonly found in galaxies, including symmetric and asymmetric double-horn profiles as well as simple Gaussian line profiles. For a more detailed overview and testing of the performance of different source finding packages and algorithms, see Westmeier et al. (2012), Popping et al. (2012), Koribalski (2012a), andWestmeier et al. (2018).

The number of galaxies for which such high-resolution H I cubes can be processed, in addition to the basic WALLABY data products at ∼30 arcsec resolution, will depend on the available computing and data storage capacity.

        <p>WALLABY will also allow us to detect OH megamasers in the redshift range z ≈ 0.13 -0.3. Such masers are known to reside in ultra-luminous infrared galaxies and are associated with merger-induced starbursts (Staveley-Smith et al. 1992;Darling and Giovanelli 2002;McKean and Roy 2009). We estimate that at least one hundred OH megamasers will be detected in the 1665/7 MHz doublet with WALLABY. In addition to detecting OH emission, we can also search for OH lines in absorption against very bright background radio continuum sources. Given the high accuracy to which we can determine the positions of WALLABY spectral line detections, we will be able to get optical/infrared identifications for the vast majority of megamaser candidates. Even more accurate positions will be available for any associated radio continuum sources. The latter is helpful in distinguishing OH from H I lines, especially if no optical redshifts are available for the stellar host galaxy. The shape and flux of the integrated spectrum also provides information about the orientation, size and mass of the associated galaxy (Briggs 1998).WALLABY will also allow us to detect OH megamasers in the redshift range z ≈ 0.13 -0.3.

        <p>Using WALLABY we will produce the largest sample of galaxies that is possible to detect in H I emission in a given observing time with ASKAP, allowing us to address fundamental science questions about galaxy formation, galaxy evolution and cosmology. We will examine the H I properties and large-scale distribution of galaxies in the Local Universe in order to study: (1) the composition of the Local Volume, (2) star formation in galaxies, (3) environment-driven galaxy evolution, (4) the structure of H I discs, (5) H I scaling relations, ( 6) the H I mass function and its variation with galaxy density and redshift, (7) intergalactic gas and the cosmic web, and (8) cosmological parameters.Using WALLABY we will produce the largest sample of galaxies that is possible to detect in H I emission in a given observing time with ASKAP, allowing us to address fundamental science questions about galaxy formation, galaxy evolution and cosmology.

        <p>WALLABY data will be suitable for a large range of Galactic and extragalactic studies. While the extragalactic studies form the main WALLABY science, our proposed velocity coverage includes H I mapping of the Milky Way and Galactic high velocity clouds (e.g., Westmeier 2018). Beyond our Galaxy, we expect to discover a large number of new Local Volume galaxies, in particular dwarf irregular and transitional galaxies, ultra-diffuse and low surface brightness galaxies (e.g., Irwin et al. 2007;Ryan-Weber et al. 2008;Westmeier et al. 2015;Adams and Oosterloo 2018;For et al. 2019), as well as the occasional H I cloud complex (e.g., Kilborn et al. 2000;Ryder et al. 2001;Koribalski et al. 2004). Examples of such new galaxy discoveries in the vicinity of known spirals are presented in the 'Local Volume H I Survey' (LVHIS) galaxy atlas (Koribalski et al. 2018). WALLABY will measure the H I content of galaxy groups, quantify the amount of intra-group gas, highlight any ongoing tidal interactions, and characterize their evolutionary state (e.g., Serra et al. 2015a;Lee-Waddell et al. 2019). Similarly, mapping H I in galaxy clusters will reveal filaments and streams resulting from violent galaxy interactions and stripping processes (e.g., Oosterloo and van Gorkom 2005;Chung et al. 2009;Wolfinger et al. 2013;Scott et al. 2018).WALLABY data will be suitable for a large range of Galactic and extragalactic studies.

        <p>WALLABY will also measure the velocity structure of galaxies and enable inference of their dark matter distribution. The widefield coverage of WALLABY will allow for the discovery of H I in many previously uncatalogued galaxies, as well as provide redshifts for a large number of catalogued galaxies (see, e.g., Kleiner et al. 2019;For et al. 2019). It will trace the H I structure and kinematics of interacting galaxies (Hibbard et al. 2001) and pinpoint candidate tidal dwarf galaxies (e.g., Lee-Waddell et al. 2018, 2019).

        <p>The volume covered by WALLABY (∼0.4 Gpc 3 for M * HI galaxies) is large enough for the measurement of cosmological parameters without substantial cosmic variance. We expect to accurately measure the density-dependence of the H I mass function, the clustering and bias parameter for gas-rich galaxies and the local flow field (e.g., Beutler et al. 2011;Papastergis et al. 2013). Further, we expect a possible detection of Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) at the lowest redshift. Independently of forthcoming optical surveys, WALLABY could reduce the errors on the dark energy parameter w and the Hubble constant H 0 by up to a factor of two when compared to PLANCK-only data. WALLABY will serve as an accurate low-redshift anchor for later SKA H I surveys of the distant Universe and allow optimization of SKA H I survey design. It will provide an important pathfinder for key SKA H I science projects. Combined with existing and new surveys from optical, infrared, X-ray and millimeter/sub-millimeter facilities, WAL- LABY will be part of an exciting new generation of panchromatic studies of the Local Universe. In the following we provide more details on the broad WALLABY science goals outlined above.The volume covered by WALLABY (∼0.4 Gpc 3 for M * HI galaxies) is large enough for the measurement of cosmological parameters without substantial cosmic variance.

        <p>The Local Group provides a unique test bed for galaxy formation and subsequent evolution. No other family of galaxies can be observed in such detail and fine mass resolution (see Fig. 9 and references therein). Since 2005, more than 40 new dwarf galaxies have been uncovered in orbit around the Milky Way and M 31. New widefield optical imaging surveys, such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES), continue to discover faint dwarf galaxy candidates (e.g., Bechtol et al. 2015). While the new discoveries have shrunk the gap between the number of observed galaxies and the hundreds of satellites predicted by cosmological simulations (Klypin et al. 1999), a missing dwarf galaxies problem has emerged (Klypin et al. 2015). Some authors argue that luminosity bias alleviates the problem (Tollerud et al. 2008), while others require significant suppression of star formation in low-mass galaxies (Koposov et al. 2009), perhaps due to cosmic reionization changing the Jeans mass or 2019). WAL- LABY will detect all Local Group galaxies with H I, including transition-type galaxies like Leo T. Discovering more dwarf galaxies in and around the Local Group will help us understand the mechanisms for gas retention in the smallest known galaxies tidal stripping of gas due to the proximity of a much larger parent (e.g., Ricotti and Gnedin 2005;Mayer et al. 2001;Bovill and Ricotti 2009). These comparisons extrapolate the number of known dwarfs by at least a factor of 10, thus the total expected number of galaxies is still highly uncertain.The Local Group provides a unique test bed for galaxy formation and subsequent evolution.

        <p>One of the most important recent discoveries in the Local Group was the galaxy Leo T (Irwin et al. 2007;Ryan-Weber et al. 2008). Based on new WSRT data, Adams and Oosterloo (2018) give an H I mass of 4.1 × 10 5 M (for D = 420 kpc), an H I radius of ∼3.3 arcmin (400 pc), and a dynamical mass of at least 1.4 × 10 7 M . Leo T is a gas-rich 'transitional' dwarf galaxy (see Fig. 9) with both an old stellar population as well as new stars. It does not fit the idea that reionization suppressed star formation in low-mass dwarfs, although simulations suggest that some gas may remain (Revaz et al. 2009) or is subsequently gained through late accretion (Ricotti 2009). Evidence suggests that this gas can survive galactic winds and supernovae explosions as highlighted in the case of the Phoenix dwarf, where the gas is adjacent to the stars but regularly falls back to trigger more star formation (Young et al. 2007). Most baryons in Leo T are in H I, highlighting the potential to discover many more gas-rich dwarf galaxies in a widefield and high-resolution H I survey such as WALLABY (DeFelippis et al. 2019). We expect most new H I detections at distances between 300 and 1500 kpc from the Milky Way; our H I mass detection limit for dwarf galaxies (∼25 km s -1 velocity width) is M HI 1.9 × 10 4 D 2 M (see Table 2). Figure 9 summarises our current knowledge of dwarf galaxy H I masses and mass limits as a function of distance from the Milky Way. It highlights the lack of H I-detected dwarf galaxies closer than 300 kpc, where gas may have been removed by tidal and/or ram pressure forces, and the increasing number of H I detections further out (see also Tolstoy et al. 2009).One of the most important recent discoveries in the Local Group was the galaxy Leo T (Irwin et al. 2007;Ryan-Weber et al. 2008).

        <p>Together with parallel data from optical/IR surveys, we will address the following questions:Together with parallel data from optical/IR surveys, we will address the following questions:</p>
        <p>• How do galaxies retain/gain gas and form stars? We will be able to compile physical evidence of gas stripping and galaxy 'harassment' as a function of environment. The discovery of more transitional (dIrr/dSph) galaxies, typically with small amounts of H I gas offset from the stellar body, can lead to a better understanding of the underlying physical processes. • By moving further from the 'zone of destruction', i.e., beyond 250-350 kpc from the Milky Way / M 31 (see Fig. 9), will we find more gas-rich dwarfs with M vir ∼ 10 7 M ? • Is there a common minimum halo mass for star formation (see, e.g., Warren et al. 2007)? • Is a galaxy's star formation history and H I mass-to-light ratio dominated by initial conditions (total mass, baryon fraction), or distance to the nearest spiral? • Are there any gas-rich galaxies without stars? The vicinity of the Local Group would be the best place to find them since low-mass galaxies have the lowest detected star formation efficiencies. • Is there a minimum mass for the smallest galaxies? Such a limit can give information on whether dark matter is cold or warm (e.g., Macció et al. 2019).• How do galaxies retain/gain gas and form stars?

        <p>The Milky Way itself provides an ideal local laboratory to study some of the above questions in great detail, in particular with respect to gas inflow and outflow (e.g., Kalberla and Dedes 2008;Putman et al. 2012;Lockman and McClure-Griffiths 2016). Such processes are crucially important in linking gas physics to the physics of star formation and galaxy evolution (e.g., Putman et al. 2012). The lowest redshift WALLABY data will therefore be used for an all-sky study of high-velocity clouds (see, e.g., Westmeier 2018), the disc-halo interface (e.g., For et al. 2014For et al. , 2016)), and the Galactic Plane, by supplementing data collected by GASKAP.The Milky Way itself provides an ideal local laboratory to study some of the above questions in great detail, in particular with respect to gas inflow and outflow (e.g., Kalberla and Dedes 2008;Putman et al. 2012;Lockman and McClure-Griffiths 2016).

        <p>By combining WALLABY with single dish H I data to form high resolution maps of all H I phases, new light will be shed on these potential discrepancies. The phase transitions of gas are inherently related to local density, dust content and magnetic field strength (Krumholz 2013). In fact, recent work has shown that density variations in the ISM are accompanied by variations in magnetic field strength (Kalberla et al. 2017;Kalberla and Kerp 2016;Zaroubi et al. 2015). Only a combined analysis of the depolarized radio continuum emission with H I observations will allow us to identify the origin of highly polarized, but radio dark filaments.By combining WALLABY with single dish H I data to form high resolution maps of all H I phases, new light will be shed on these potential discrepancies.

        <p>The star formation law or the Kennicutt-Schmidt relationship between gas surface densities and star formation rate (SFR) densities is largely understood in M * -type galaxies (e.g., Bigiel et al. 2008;Leroy et al. 2008).

On the other hand, there are still large gaps in our understanding of star formation at low surface brightness (LSB) and in low-mass dwarf galaxies (Lee et al. 2009;Kovač et al. 2009;Bigiel et al. 2010;Roychowdhury et al. 2017;López-Sánchez et al. 2018).

        <p>The star formation theory from Krumholz (2013) suggests that stars can form directly from low temperature gas whether or not gas is in its molecular state (i.e., when the free-fall timescale is less than the chemical timescales, it is not necessary for molecular gas to form first). Can such direct formation of stars occur in the outer regions of disk galaxies (and LSB dwarf galaxies) where H I appears to be the dominant phase of cold gas? In addition, there exist extreme conditions where the ISM appears to be H I- rich but CO-deficient (e.g., Bicalho et al. 2019). For example, the ISM in collisional ring galaxies, which experience compression-triggered star formation, is one such starforming ISM that is H I-rich but CO-poor (e.g., Wong et al. 2017;Higdon et al. 2011). WALLABY will much increase the H I samples of low-mass and LSB galaxies as well as ring galaxies (see Bait et al. 2020).The star formation theory from Krumholz (2013) suggests that stars can form directly from low temperature gas whether or not gas is in its molecular state (i.e., when the free-fall timescale is less than the chemical timescales, it is not necessary for molecular gas to form first).

        <p>WALLABY will enable detailed studies of the H I content of galaxies through all environments, from the densest clusters, to compact and loose groups, to voids. We will combine the WALLABY data with widefield optical and infrared surveys such as SkyMapper and WISE (see Sect. 4.6.1), to investigate the relation between H I mass, environment, SFR, and morphological type, and how these dependencies change with redshift. The resolution of WALLABY will enable investigation of the shapes and frequency of asymmetries in the H I distribution, e.g., lopsidedness and warping, to determine the impact of gravitational interactions (e.g., mergers, harassment) and hydrodynamical interactions (e.g., ram pressure stripping, evaporation). We will compare our observations with theoretical predictions of galaxy formation, including semi-analytic models to describe the large-scale H I distribution and changes in H I mass function (e.g., Power et al. 2010), and hydrodynamic simulations (e.g., Marasco et al. 2016;Crain et al. 2017;Stevens et al. 2019) to investigate the physical processes occurring in the galaxies, both internal (e.g., feedback, outflows) and external (e.g., ram pressure stripping, gravitational interactions). By characterizing the global H I spectra of around half a million galaxies, we will obtain a wealth of properties, including their systemic and rotational velocities, H I and total dynamical mass estimates, and their profile shape. The latter can be an excellent indicator of environmental effects, with highly symmetric H I profiles typically found in isolated spiral galaxies (Espada et al. 2011) and asymmetric H I profiles in galaxies affected by tidal interactions and/or ram pressure stripping (Giese et al. 2016;Scott et al. 2018). The Local Universe can be used as a test bed for galaxy evolution theory. The standard model for structure formation and evolution states that galaxies arise from early perturbations in a CDM Universe that grow and merge to become the galaxies we observe today. This model is able to reproduce the large-scale features observed in the Universe such as the galaxy two-point correlation function, the galaxy clustering amplitude and baryon acoustic oscillations (Springel et al. 2005). However, the complex physics of the ISM and its interaction with stellar populations largely remains beyond the ability of these simulations to model in a self-consistent manner. H I is a vital component of the ISM, and WALLABY observations provide stringent tests for any models of galaxy evolution.WALLABY will enable detailed studies of the H I content of galaxies through all environments, from the densest clusters, to compact and loose groups, to voids.

By characterizing the global H I spectra of around half a million galaxies, we will obtain a wealth of properties, including their systemic and rotational velocities, H I and total dynamical mass estimates, and their profile shape. The latter can be an excellent indicator of environmental effects, with highly symmetric H I profiles typically found in isolated spiral galaxies (Espada et al. 2011) and asymmetric H I profiles in galaxies affected by tidal interactions and/or ram pressure stripping (Giese et al. 2016;Scott et al. 2018). The Local Universe can be used as a test bed for galaxy evolution theory. The standard model for structure formation and evolution states that galaxies arise from early perturbations in a CDM Universe that grow and merge to become the galaxies we observe today. This model is able to reproduce the large-scale features observed in the Universe such as the galaxy two-point correlation function, the galaxy clustering amplitude and baryon acoustic oscillations (Springel et al. 2005). However, the complex physics of the ISM and its interaction with stellar populations largely remains beyond the ability of these simulations to model in a self-consistent manner. H I is a vital component of the ISM, and WALLABY observations provide stringent tests for any models of galaxy evolution.</p>
        <p>Gas accretion from the IGM or through minor and major mergers plays a fundamental role in galaxy evolution and depends strongly on the environment a galaxy lives in. Accretion influences the gas content, SFR, stellar populations, and the galaxy morphology over cosmic time (e.g., Bournaud et al. 2007;Keres et al. 2005Keres et al. , 2009)). There is some observational evidence for accretion of neutral gas onto spiral galaxies, including from gas-rich dwarf galaxies, extraplanar gas, and warped discs (e.g., Sancisi et al. 2008), although Di Teodoro andFraternali (2014) find minor mergers to play a minor role. For example, gas accretion by the nearby dwarf galaxy NGC 5253, which is located in the M 83 galaxy group (Koribalski et al. 2018), may have triggered a powerful starburst (López-Sánchez et al. 2012). Similarly, the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 1512, which is interacting with the blue compact dwarf galaxy NGC 1510 (Koribalski and López-Sánchez 2009), is accreting intergalactic metal-poor gas (López-Sánchez et al. 2015). Analysis of the HVC population surrounding the Milky Way has provided particular insights and limits into potential accretion (Wakker et al. 1999;Putman 2006).Gas accretion from the IGM or through minor and major mergers plays a fundamental role in galaxy evolution and depends strongly on the environment a galaxy lives in.

        <p>Surveys such as LVHIS have used their large sample sizes to identify a handful of candidates that could be accreting (Koribalski et al. 2018). WALLABY's sample sizes will be many times larger, and we will study the H I morphology of galaxies as a function of environment, e.g., identify asymmetries, close companions and tidal features. By analysing the galaxy outskirts we can estimate gas accretion rates across a range of environments and galaxy densities (see, e.g., Serra et al. 2015a;Lee-Waddell et al. 2019). In conjunction with simulations, the dependence of galaxy asymmetries on different environments can be used to assess the relative importance of ram pressure, tidal interactions and 'harassment' in driving galaxy evolution. In the most isolated galaxies, where gas captured from companions and galactic fountains (due to SF and AGN) is minimized, as shown in the AMIGA project (Verdes-Montenegro et al. 2005), cold gas accretion from the cosmic web should stand out prominently.Surveys such as LVHIS have used their large sample sizes to identify a handful of candidates that could be accreting (Koribalski et al. 2018).

        <p>Gas-rich galaxies residing in clusters are affected by their massive potential, hot intra-cluster medium, and galaxygalaxy interactions. Late-type galaxies in clusters typically are H I deficient compared to isolated galaxies of similar optical morphology (e.g., Solanes et al. 2001;Chung et al. 2009;Brown et al. 2017). Studies of the Virgo cluster revealed H I filaments stripped from galaxies in this extreme environment (e.g., Koopmann et al. 2008;Oosterloo and van Gorkom 2005;Boselli et al. 2018aBoselli et al. , 2018b)). The conditions for stripping, in particular ram pressure stripping, are becoming better understood through the increasing efforts in observations and modelling. Galaxy clusters also influence the morphologies of galaxies at large distances from their cores: observations in the outskirts of the Virgo cluster found galaxies affected by the cluster potential before they reach the central regions (Chung et al. 2007;Yoon et al. 2017), so-called pre-processing. Furthermore, the SFRs of cluster members are affected well outside the virial radius (Lewis et al. 2002), indicating an early effect on the hydrogen component, which is the fuel for star formation.Gas-rich galaxies residing in clusters are affected by their massive potential, hot intra-cluster medium, and galaxygalaxy interactions.

        <p>With the majority of galaxies in the Local Universe residing in groups (e.g., Eke et al. 2004;Yang et al. 2007), this medium-dense environment also plays an important role in driving galaxy evolution. Galaxy-galaxy interactions are thought to be more effective at stripping gas from galaxies in groups than their counterparts in clusters, owing to the smaller velocity dispersions in the former. However, the effectiveness of other mechanisms such as ram pressure stripping and strangulation in the group environment is still under investigation (e.g., Rasmussen et al. 2008;Westmeier et al. 2011;Stevens and Brown 2017). Systematic investigations of both compact (e.g., Verdes-Montenegro et al. 2001;Borthakur et al. 2010) and loose (e.g., Kilborn et al. 2009;Freeland et al. 2009;Hess and Wilcots 2013;Westmeier et al. 2017;Hess et al. 2019) groups can act as test cases for ram pressure stripping and galaxy merger models. H I studies of galaxies in underdense regions, like the carefully selected sample of void galaxies by Kreckel et al. (2012), are also important.

We will use this estimate for galaxy population studies involving the TF relation itself and the baryonic version of it (e.g., Oh et al. 2011).2.

        <p>With WALLABY, this study can be extended for the larger galaxies. At large radii (typically beyond the 25th B-band magnitude), the spin vectors of H I discs of spiral discs often appear to be tilted with respect to the inner discs, i.e., galactic discs become warped where the stellar component is fading (Koribalski 2015). The warp, the transition from one orientation to the other, often appears in a confined radial range, indicating a two-regime structure of an inner bright disk and a faint, inclined outer disk (e.g., Briggs 1990;van der Kruit 2007;Józsa 2007;Kam et al. 2017). The transition is sometimes marked by a break in surface brightness as well as in their kinematics (Józsa 2007). Warps have long been suggested to trace a large-scale alignment (Battaner et al. 1990), can potentially trace accretion from the IGM with misaligned angular momentum (van der Kruit 2007), and have been suggested to trace IGM properties in different environments (Haan and Braun 2014). While attempts to use warps as tracers of large-scale accretion in optical wavelength (Lopez-Corredoira et al. 2008) are hampered by the fact that the optical disk tapers off before a warp is detectable, the same is not true for well-resolved H I discs. The environment also influences the intrinsic warp structure and the warp kinematics, providing clues on warp formation.With WALLABY, this study can be extended for the larger galaxies.

        <p>While the main trends of decreasing H I content (normalised by a scale parameter such as luminosity) for more luminous, redder and earlier-type galaxies have been known for over two decades (e.g., review by Roberts and Haynes 1994), this remains an active area of research. Practical applications of gas scaling relations include: quantifying environmental effects (H I-deficiency, e.g., Giovanelli and Haynes 1985;Boselli and Gavazzi 2006;Cortese et al. 2011;Dénes et al. 2014;Brown et al. 2017); predicting gas content when H I observations are not available (photometric gas fractions, e.g., Zhang et al. 2009;Eckert et al. 2015), identifying interesting populations of galaxies that are outliers in some of those relations (e.g., H I-excess galaxies, Lutz et al. 2017;Geréb et al. 2016Geréb et al. , 2018)).While the main trends of decreasing H I content (normalised by a scale parameter such as luminosity) for more luminous, redder and earlier-type galaxies have been known for over two decades (e.g., review by Roberts and Haynes 1994), this remains an active area of research.

        <p>Gas scaling relations have been obtained from both HIPASS (Dénes et al. 2014) and ALFALFA (Huang et al. 2012). However, H I-blind surveys detect only the most gasrich systems over their full volumes, hence care must be taken to recover gas scaling relations that are representative of the local galaxy population (see, e.g., Huang et al. 2012).Gas scaling relations have been obtained from both HIPASS (Dénes et al. 2014) and ALFALFA (Huang et al. 2012).

        <p>Significant effort has been devoted in the past decade to measure H I properties of galaxies that are typically missed by H I-blind surveys, such as early-type galaxies (ATLAS-3D, Serra et al. 2012a) and stellar mass selected samples (GASS, Catinella et al. 2010Catinella et al. , 2013;;xGASS, Catinella et al. 2018; see also RESOLVE, Stark et al. 2016). In particular, the gas fraction limited nature of the GASS and xGASS surveys probed the gas-poor regime for a statistical sample of ∼1200 galaxies, providing benchmark gas scaling relations in the Local Universe (z ≤ 0.05) that have been widely used to test semi-analytic models and hydrodynamic simulations (e.g., Lagos et al. 2014Lagos et al. , 2015;;Popping et al. 2015;Marasco et al. 2016;Crain et al. 2017;Davé et al. 2017;Zoldan et al. 2017;Stevens et al. 2019).Significant effort has been devoted in the past decade to measure H I properties of galaxies that are typically missed by H I-blind surveys, such as early-type galaxies (ATLAS-3D, Serra et al. 2012a) and stellar mass selected samples (GASS, Catinella et al. 2010Catinella et al. , 2013;;xGASS, Catinella et al. 2018; see also RESOLVE, Stark et al. 2016).

        <p>From a theoretical viewpoint it has long been expected that the H I content of galaxies correlates with the angular momentum in the disc. Several empirical studies supported this view (e.g., Huang et al. 2012). Based on analytical stability considerations, Obreschkow et al. (2016) proposed a parameter-free model to quantitatively predict the H I fraction as a function of the mass and angular momentum of galactic discs in dynamic equilibrium. They showed that local H I selected galaxies (from HIPASS, THINGS and LITTLE THINGS) follow the model prediction remarkably well. Moreover, isolated H I-excess galaxies (see Lutz et al. 2017Lutz et al. , 2018) ) and H I-deficient late-type galaxies (see Murugeshan et al. 2019), with similar stellar masses and optical morphology are observed to follow this relation consistently. Such a disparity will naturally bring about scatter in the M HI -M star scaling relations. Therefore, understanding this relation is crucial to understanding a potential source of scatter in H I scaling relations. WALLABY will resolve the H I discs of ∼5 000 galaxies with five or more beams (corresponding roughly to the catalogued HIPASS detections), enabling us to derive accurate outer rotation curves and thus to calculate the angular momentum for large samples of galaxies from different environments (low to high densities). Such a study will for the first time allow us to understand the origin of the scatter in H I scaling relations from an angular momentum perspective (see Kurapati et al. 2018).From a theoretical viewpoint it has long been expected that the H I content of galaxies correlates with the angular momentum in the disc.

        <p>One of the most interesting aspects of gas scaling relation studies is to determine what physical processes drive their scatter. This requires the ability to bin galaxies simultaneously by multiple properties, providing larger statistics than provided by the xGASS survey, described above, and is best tackled with spectral stacking. As mentioned in Sect. 1, H I spectral stacking is a powerful technique to exploit H I-blind surveys well below their nominal sensitivity limits, making use of spectra of non-detected galaxies that are present within their volumes. In addition to constraining the H I cosmic density up to redshifts as high as z ∼ 1.265 (Kanekar et al. 2016), spectral stacking is an excellent tool to investigate gas scaling relations (Fabello et al. 2011(Fabello et al. , 2012;;Brown et al. 2015Brown et al. , 2017)). By applying this technique, for instance, to a stellar mass-selected sample of ∼25 000 galaxies within the ALFALFA volume (mostly undetected in H I), Brown et al. (2015) showed that the scatter of the gas fraction-stellar mass relation is driven by a specific star-formation rate, and its slope is determined by the bimodality of local galaxies (with gas-rich, star-forming systems dominating in numbers at the low stellar mass end, and gas-poor, quiescent systems found preferentially at the high stellar mass end). Even more interestingly, Brown et al. (2017) presented for the first time convincing evidence for systematic environmental suppression of gas content at both fixed stellar mass and fixed specific SFR in satellite galaxies, and showed that gas suppression begins in halo masses typical of the group regime, well before galaxies reach the cluster environment. WALLABY will advance these studies not only by providing H I spectra (see Fig. 1) and their properties for around half a million galaxies, but also and especially by covering an unprecedented volume, which will be a goldmine for spectral stacking analyses of optically-selected samples.One of the most interesting aspects of gas scaling relation studies is to determine what physical processes drive their scatter.

        <p>In addition to the scaling relations between the total H I mass and stellar properties, other scaling relations also provide useful tools. The H I size-mass relation (Broeils and Rhee 1997;Wang et al. 2016) provides an estimate of the H I disk size for unresolved H I masses and also puts strong constraints on the star formation and stellar feedback recipes adopted in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation (e.g., Bahé et al. 2016). The TF relation between stellar or baryonic mass and H I velocity width implies the significant role that the dark matter halo may have played in the assembly of the galaxies and has also been studied with spectral stacking (Meyer et al. 2016).In addition to the scaling relations between the total H I mass and stellar properties, other scaling relations also provide useful tools.

        <p>The H I mass function (HIMF) describes the volume density of galaxies of a given H I mass and is therefore the neutral hydrogen equivalent of the optical luminosity function. The HIMF is one of the most important statistical tools that astronomers use to describe and characterize gas-rich galaxy populations. One important parameter that can be derived from the H I mass function is the cosmic H I mass density, HI : the number of neutral hydrogen atoms per unit volume. This HI is a key input into the understanding of the evolution of the cosmic SFR density. The evolution of the H I mass density can be mapped out and compared to models of gas and galaxy evolution when the local 21-cm-derived HI is combined with damped Lyα measurements at higher redshifts (e.g., Noterdaeme et al. 2012, and references therein). In particular, the comparison with the predictions of semianalytic or hydrodynamic models can provide insights into the processes governing the distribution and evolution of cool gas (e.g., Obreschkow et al. 2009a;Lagos et al. 2011;Diemer et al. 2019).The H I mass function (HIMF) describes the volume density of galaxies of a given H I mass and is therefore the neutral hydrogen equivalent of the optical luminosity function.

        <p>The shape of the H I mass function at z = 0 is an equally important constraint in cosmological models of galaxy evolution. For example, semi-analytic models (Obreschkow et al. 2009a;Lagos et al. 2011;Neistein and Weinmann 2010;Kim et al. 2011;Stevens et al. 2016) use the H I mass function shape as an essential input. Compared to the stellar mass function, the H I mass function provides additional limits because the correlation between halo mass and cold gas mass is very different from that between halo mass and stellar mass. In the models, the most gas-rich galaxies often have low halo masses. Kim et al. (2013) show that the H I mass function is a more sensitive probe of the effects of cosmological reionization on galaxy formation models than the luminosity function. Furthermore, these authors show how different star formation laws affect the shape of the H I mass function.The shape of the H I mass function at z = 0 is an equally important constraint in cosmological models of galaxy evolution.

        <p>The first direct measurements of the H I mass function were the result of Arecibo surveys in the late 1990s (Zwaan et al. 1997;Spitzak and Schneider 1998;Rosenberg and Schneider 2002). These surveys detected up to a few hundred galaxies over small areas of the sky, but were able to determine the mass function for H I masses more than a few times 10 7 M . Like the optical luminosity function, the H I mass function was demonstrated to follow a Schechter function with a power-law faint-end slope and an exponential fall-off at the high mass end. However, different surveys disagreed on the slope of the low-mass end and hence the sig-nificance of the low H I mass population remained Schneider et al. 1998;Kovač et al. 2009).The first direct measurements of the H I mass function were the result of Arecibo surveys in the late 1990s (Zwaan et al. 1997;Spitzak and Schneider 1998;Rosenberg and Schneider 2002).

        <p>The accuracy of measured H I mass functions improved considerably with the new generation of blind 21-cm surveys: HIPASS and ALFALFA. HIPASS produced a catalogue of several thousand galaxies and put particular effort into understanding the completeness and reliability of the catalogue (Zwaan et al. 2004). With HIPASS, it became possible to divide the sample into different sub-samples to study, for instance, the effect of environment on the shape of the mass function. However, controversy still surrounds the magnitude and sign of the density-dependence of the H I mass function, possibly due to depth and cosmic variance issues with existing shallow surveys (Springob et al. 2005;Zwaan et al. 2003Zwaan et al. , 2005)). ALFALFA covers a much smaller region of the sky than HIPASS, but is considerably deeper. Jones et al. (2018b) derive the H I mass function from the final AL-FALFA catalogue as well as separately for the two survey regions (the Virgo cluster and the local void). They find a large discrepancy in the low-mass slope between the two regions (-1.29 vs. -1.15), likely due to the difference in galaxy density. Their global slope of α = -1.25 ± 0.02 ± 0.03 is slightly below the global HIPASS slope of α = -1.37 ± 0.06 from Zwaan et al. (2005).

        <p>The number of galaxies detected by WALLABY will be &gt;10 times larger than that found by HIPASS and ALFALFA combined. Compared to HIPASS, WALLABY can detect lowmass galaxies over a ∼100 times larger volume and is therefore much less sensitive to cosmic variance. Figure 12 shows that with WALLABY the local H I mass function can be reliably measured down to masses below M HI = 10 6 M . In addition, the large number of WALLABY detections will allow for a detailed look at the connection between H I and halo mass through measurements of the conditional HIMF (similar to the conditional stellar mass function; Yang et al. 2005Yang et al. , 2008;;Reddick et al. 2013). Projection of the Conditional HIMF along its two dimensions results in measurements of the full HIMF and the occupancy of H I galaxies within halos of a given mass, and so provides insight into the formation of H I galaxies.

        <p>There are two key aspects for WALLABY studies of the intergalactic medium (IGM): at low redshift WALLABY will detect the IGM in emission, in the form of intragroup and intra-cluster H I gas, typically present in nearby Fig. 12 The reconstructed H I mass function for the simulated WAL-LABY volume. A 2D stepwise maximum likelihood method (SWML; Zwaan et al. 2003) method has been used to measure the space density of galaxies, which can be measured accurately down to H I masses of M HI = 10 6 M . The grey line is a Schechter fit to the data points groups/clusters, where tidal interactions and harassment/ stripping are on-going (see Sect. 5.3). Examples are: the M 96 group (Schneider et al. 1983), the M 81 group (de Blok et al. 2018;Sorgho et al. 2019), the NGC 2434 group (Ryder et al. 2001), the NGC 3263 group (English et al. 2010), the IC 1459 group (Serra et al. 2015a;Saponara et al. 2018), compact groups (Verdes-Montenegro et al. 2001;Serra et al. 2013), the Virgo cluster (Kent et al. 2009;Oosterloo and van Gorkom 2005;Kent et al. 2009;Chung et al. 2009) and the Abell 1367 cluster (Scott et al. 2018). At the WALLABY resolution of ∼30 arcsec, an H I cloud with a diameter of 7 kpc can be spatially resolved to a redshift of 0.011 (cz = 3400 km s -1 ). Assuming a velocity width of 25 km s -1 , the 5σ H I detection limit is 4 × 10 19 cm -2 . Therefore, WALLABY will be able to locate and map all the emission from H I gas at cz &lt; 3400 km s -1 that is capable of producing a DLA. At the high redshift end of our band, the IGM can be characterized via intervening H I absorption line systems in spectra towards bright continuum background sources.

        <p>WALLABY will provide a first-ever large-scale, unbiased look at the denser parts of the IGM, which so far has mainly been seen in Lyα absorption lines against background quasars. About one-third of the z ∼ 0 baryons are in this photoionized phase with T ≈ 10 4 K (Danforth and Shull 2008), with the remaining two-thirds in galactic concentrations and the warm-hot IGM. Wakker and Savage (2009) show that 50% of the photoionized Lyα forest lies within 400 kpc of galaxies and that the highest column density forest lines mostly occur close to galaxies. Lyα absorption lines are very rare in the Local Universe because their detection requires space-based ultraviolet observations. Of the highest column density absorbers, the DLA and sub-DLA systems, only ∼10 instances are known at z &lt; 0.2. Of the nearest four, two originate in the disk of a spiral galaxy, one in a dwarf galaxy, and one (seen toward the quasar PG 1216+069) appears to be an intergalactic cloud behind the Virgo Cluster (see Chengalur et al. 2015, and references therein). This will allow us to answer questions about the exact relationship between these intergalactic clouds and galaxies, such as what fraction originates in galaxy discs and how far from galaxies they occur. It will also give us a zeroredshift marker from which we can track evolution through higher-redshift absorption line studies.WALLABY will provide a first-ever large-scale, unbiased look at the denser parts of the IGM, which so far has mainly been seen in Lyα absorption lines against background quasars.

        <p>A series of landmark observations have confirmed many of the predictions of the standard CDM cosmology. However, uncertainties remain over the validity of CDM because there is no physical understanding of either dark matter or dark energy, and there remains the possibility that there may exist other, as yet undetected, components such as warm dark matter and primordial black holes. The unique widefield capabilities of ASKAP allow WALLABY to detect a large number of galaxies over a large volume of the local Universe and allow several cosmological experiments to be conducted. These experiments will provide tests of General Relativity, the CDM paradigm, and refine cosmological parameters.A series of landmark observations have confirmed many of the predictions of the standard CDM cosmology. However, uncertainties remain over the validity of CDM because there is no physical understanding of either dark matter or dark energy, and there remains the possibility that there may exist other, as yet undetected, components such as warm dark matter and primordial black holes. The unique widefield capabilities of ASKAP allow WALLABY to detect a large number of galaxies over a large volume of the local Universe and allow several cosmological experiments to be conducted. These experiments will provide tests of General Relativity, the CDM paradigm, and refine cosmological parameters.</p>
        <p>WALLABY will determine the 3D locations of large numbers of local galaxies. Firstly, this will allow the measurement of the baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) scale at the present epoch. When combined with other surveys such as 2dFGRS, SDSS and WiggleZ (which have measured the BAO scale 2-3 billion and seven billion years ago, respectively), WALLABY will provide complete information on cosmic expansion to the present day. In the Local Universe, WALLABY will improve on the 6dFGS measurement of the Hubble constant (Beutler et al. 2011), and provide a valuable complement to the TAIPAN optical spectroscopic survey (Da Cunha et al. 2017). WALLABY and TAIPAN will yield the present-day expansion rate of the universe, H 0 , to better than 1% precision.WALLABY will determine the 3D locations of large numbers of local galaxies.

        <p>Secondly, CDM also makes specific predictions as to how the gravitational attraction of dark matter produces variations in the otherwise smooth expansion of galaxies. This gives rise to structure in the distribution of galaxies and also gives rise to non-Hubble velocities and redshift-space distortions. These can be measured via the density and velocity/momentum power spectra. Combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) derived priors, the full-shape of the clustering measured with WALLABY can be used to constrain the CDM cosmological model and its extensions, providing constraints on: m and b , the total matter and baryon densities defined relative to the critical density; h, the Hubble constant in units of 100 km s -1 Mpc -1 , f , the growth rate of structurer; σ 8 , the present amplitude of the matter perturbations; n s , the spectral index of the density fluctuations; and finally the equation of state parameter for dark energy, w, where w = -1 is the cosmological constant. The main impact of WALLABY is to reduce the error on h and w by a factor two (Beutler et al. 2011;Duffy et al. 2012b) relative to the value achieved with the Planck satellite alone; and to improve the constraints on f σ 8 at z ≈ 0 by a factor of three (Koda et al. 2014;Howlett et al. 2017c) compared to 6dFGS (Beutler et al. 2012;Adams and Blake 2017). This latter improvement results from the fact that WALLABY will provide both a redshift sample and redshift-independent distances.Secondly, CDM also makes specific predictions as to how the gravitational attraction of dark matter produces variations in the otherwise smooth expansion of galaxies.

        <p>About 10% of the WALLABY H I detections will be of suitably inclined galaxies with profiles of sufficient S/N ratio to yield reliable distances via the TF relation. Such distances rely on quality infrared or near-infrared photometry from surveys such as SkyMapper (Wolf et al. 2018), 2MASS (Skrutskie et al. 2006), WISE (Wright et al. 2010;Jarrett et al. 2012Jarrett et al. , 2019) ) and the VISTA Hemispheric Survey (Sutherland et al. 2015). Such a sample will provide the most comprehensive TF dataset to date, exceeding the recent 2MTF survey (Hong et al. 2019) by an order of magnitude. It will also complement the existing 6dFGS peculiar velocity survey of 10 000 early-type galaxies (Campbell et al. 2014) and the future TAIPAN survey of up to 100 000 early-type galaxies (Da Cunha et al. 2017), potentially similar numbers of supernova from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and LSST (Howlett et al. 2017b;Graham et al. 2019), and will significantly add to the totality of redshift-independent distances available in the cosmicflows compilation (Courtois et al. 2017).About 10% of the WALLABY H I detections will be of suitably inclined galaxies with profiles of sufficient S/N ratio to yield reliable distances via the TF relation.

        <p>Crucially, the differences in sample type and distance indicator between WALLABY and other surveys will provide two completely independent probes of the galaxy motions and density field over a volume with considerable overlap. Furthermore, while the early-type galaxies in TAIPAN tend to be found in clusters and other over-densities, the late-type galaxies of WALLABY will better trace the lowdensity filaments and the large-scale structures, including across the Zone of Avoidance which otherwise masks some of the most massive regions in the local Universe (Staveley-Smith et al. 2016). The combined power of WALLABY TF data, the TAIPAN Fundamental Plane data and future supernova samples will provide the best route to estimate the dis-tribution of mass in the Local Universe and the total matter density (e.g. Erdogdu et al. 2006;Graziani et al. 2019). Combined measurements of H I line width and central stellar velocity dispersion can improve the TF relation and extend it to a generalised scaling relation (Cortese et al. 2014;Tiley et al. 2019;Barat et al. 2019) and reduce the uncertainties in the velocities of individual galaxies, currently sitting at ∼20%, and expand the range of application to galaxies of all morphological types.Crucially, the differences in sample type and distance indicator between WALLABY and other surveys will provide two completely independent probes of the galaxy motions and density field over a volume with considerable overlap.

        <p>Such velocity fields can be used to provide better values for the bulk and shear motion of galaxies over greater depths in the local Universe (Scrimgeour et al. 2016;Hong et al. 2019;Qin et al. 2019b). CDM provides testable predictions for the expected range for these measurements. The velocity fields can also be compared with the density distributions inferred from redshift surveys, including WALLABY itself. These can also be used to test CDM and General Relativity by constraining to growth factor f σ 8 at low redshifts (Springob et al. 2016). Furthermore, the velocity or momentum auto power and their crosspower spectrum with the density field can be used to accurately measure f σ 8 (Koda et al. 2014;Howlett 2019;Qin et al. 2019a).Such velocity fields can be used to provide better values for the bulk and shear motion of galaxies over greater depths in the local Universe (Scrimgeour et al. 2016;Hong et al. 2019;Qin et al. 2019b).

        <p>Studies of the TF relation require high signal-to-noise, double-horn H I spectra of undisturbed galaxies, ideally with steep wings. Using the Busy Function (Westmeier et al. 2014) to characterize the WALLABY galaxy H I spectra may allow us to use a lower signal-to-noise threshold than previously employed (e.g., Hong et al. 2013Hong et al. , 2019)).Studies of the TF relation require high signal-to-noise, double-horn H I spectra of undisturbed galaxies, ideally with steep wings.

        <p>The observed large-scale structure of the Universe, as traced by the spatial distribution of galaxies, is a complex web of sheets, filaments and knots (e.g., Einasto et al. 1997). Numerical simulations have been successful at reproducing the basic properties of the formation and evolution of the cosmic web (e.g., Colberg et al. 2005), although the processes regulating the baryonic component are still not fully understood.The observed large-scale structure of the Universe, as traced by the spatial distribution of galaxies, is a complex web of sheets, filaments and knots (e.g., Einasto et al. 1997).

        <p>We now know that filaments of galaxies stretch between clusters, and that these provide the environment in which the overwhelming majority of galaxies form and spend a significant fraction of their lives. The 2dFGRS and SDSS surveys have helped to establish the monotonic decline of star formation in galaxies from the low-density field to the cores of clusters (e.g., Lewis et al. 2002;Kauffmann et al. 2004). What comes as a surprise is the high incidence of star formation in the outskirts of clusters (at 1-2 times the virial radii), particularly for clusters that are part of a filamentary network (e.g., Porter et al. 2008). This seems to indicate that the web of filaments plays a very important role in processing a large fraction of galaxies before they are assimilated in modern-day clusters.We now know that filaments of galaxies stretch between clusters, and that these provide the environment in which the overwhelming majority of galaxies form and spend a significant fraction of their lives.

        <p>Within z &lt; 0.1, there are several remarkable superclusters that consist of &gt;20 rich clusters and associated filaments, namely Shapley (Raychaudhury 1989), Horologium-Reticulum (Fleenor et al. 2005), Pisces-Cetus (Porter and Raychaudhury 2005) and possibly the Vela Supercluster (Kraan-Korteweg et al. 2017). Such systems provide a wide range of environments, in local density and local velocity dispersion, within a small volume. The measurement of H I deficiency and the morphology of neutral gas will allow the study of effects like the interaction between the galaxies and the intra-cluster medium (stripping and strangulation), galaxy-galaxy interactions (harassment, mergers), and star formation in clusters and on the inter-cluster filaments (e.g., Dénes et al. 2014).Within z &lt; 0.1, there are several remarkable superclusters that consist of &gt;20 rich clusters and associated filaments, namely Shapley (Raychaudhury 1989), Horologium-Reticulum (Fleenor et al. 2005), Pisces-Cetus (Porter and Raychaudhury 2005) and possibly the Vela Supercluster (Kraan-Korteweg et al. 2017).

        <p>During ASKAP Early Science (Oct 2016 -Mar 2018) the WALLABY team obtained ∼800 h of H I spectral line observations for four target fields with an array of up to 16 PAF-equipped antennas. Using all 36 beams, typically arranged in a square 6 × 6 pattern, we achieved the desired field of view of 30 sq deg. Our aim was to reach full WAL- LABY depth (see Table 1), which required spending ∼150 h per field spread over multiple nights. By targeting nearby, gas-rich galaxy groups and clusters, we set out to explore the H I content, kinematics, and star formation of galaxies and their surroundings as a function of local environment. The WALLABY Early Science fields were ideal commissioning targets, delivering not only H I emission and absorption data, and studies of radio transients, but also radio continuum and polarization maps.

        <p>For the first field, centered on the NGC 7232 galaxy group, we were able to use only a limited ASKAP bandwidth of 48 MHz, divided into ∼2500 channels. Most observations were conducted from Oct to Dec 2016 with an array of up to 12 PAF-equipped ASKAP antennas. WALLABY Early Science results obtained from target areas within this field are published by Lee-Waddell et al. (2019) on the interacting NGC 7232/3 galaxy triplet and surroundings (see Fig. 13), Kleiner et al. (2019) on the spiral galaxy IC 5201 and companions, and Reynolds et al. (2019) on the NGC 7162 galaxy group. The second field targeted the Fornax Cluster in Dec 2016; the available observing bandwidth was 192 MHz. Our third and fourth fields were centered on the Dorado and M 83 galaxy groups, respectively, covering a full 24 hour LST range suitable for continuous observing in 2016/7. We took particular care to minimise solar sidelobes entering the ASKAP dishes and the ASKAP PAFs for our day-time field (towards the M 83 group). This set of data In Mar 2019, the first observations were conducted with the full array of 36 PAF-equipped ASKAP antennas (ASKAP-36) and a bandwidth of 288 MHz targeting the Eridanus galaxy group. This was followed by the first round of pilot science surveys between Aug 2019 and May 2020.

        <p>In Figs. 10 &amp; 14 we show our first H I results from ASKAP-36 observations of the Hydra galaxy cluster. An area of ∼60 sq degr was observed using four interleaved pointings (8h each). Each data set was then calibrated and imaged using the 
            <rs type="software">ASKAPsoft</rs> pipeline (Whiting et al. 2017;Kleiner et al. 2019) and a 30 arcsec restoring beam. The resulting cubes were combined before running 
            <rs type="software">SoFiA</rs> to find and extract all reliable H I detections. Due to significant RFI in the lower part of the band, we focus on the 1.3 -1.42 GHz range, obtaining a median rms of 1.5 mJy beam -1 for the central beams. The rms noise does increase by a factor ∼1.4 towards the outer beams. The ∼150 WALLABY detections in the displayed part of the Hydra cluster (see Fig. 14, top left) compare to ∼50 known H I galaxies, including eight HIPASS detections.

        <p>A full space sampling for nearby, large galaxies can be achieved by combining WALLABY data with data from single-dish telescopes. We have started a pilot campaign of synergetic observations with FAST on a 20 sq deg field around the center of the NGC 4636 group at a distance of 15.9 Mpc, with the aim of detecting the faint, diffuse H I stripped by environmental effects. The FAST image is under reduction and expected to achieve a column density limit of a few times 10 18 cm -2 . We expect a depth of ∼10 19 when combining FAST and WALLABY data with roughly equal weights.A full space sampling for nearby, large galaxies can be achieved by combining WALLABY data with data from single-dish telescopes.

        <p>WALLABY is an extragalactic H I survey which builds on recent large-area surveys conducted with multibeam feed arrays on single-dish telescopes (e.g., HIPASS, ALFALFA), and complements planned northern surveys with new instruments (Apertif, FAST). WALLABY will become a lowredshift reference survey which will anchor our knowledge of the H I properties of galaxies and the effect of environment on the formation and evolution of galaxies. This sets the scene for several deep H I surveys with ASKAP and MeerKAT (DINGO, MIGHTEE-HI, LADUMA) and, later, the SKA and better informs us on the evolution of the gaseous properties of galaxies, and will expand our knowledge of gas accretion, outflow and galaxy interactions.WALLABY is an extragalactic H I survey which builds on recent large-area surveys conducted with multibeam feed arrays on single-dish telescopes (e.g., HIPASS, ALFALFA), and complements planned northern surveys with new instruments (Apertif, FAST).

        <p>A major advantage of WALLABY over previous surveys, an overview of which is provided here, will be its ability to clearly separate individual galaxies in group and cluster environments, and to well-resolve thousands of nearby galaxies, thus allowing accurate studies of their kinematics and interstellar medium. We confirm previous predictions that WALLABY is expected to detect around 500 000 galaxies, the vast majority with redshifts z &lt; 0.1.

At the top left we show the SoFiA-derived H I intensity map of ∼150 reliably detected galaxies over approximately a third of the observed field and a velocity range from 500 to 15 000 km s -1 (z &lt; 0.05). The full Hydra field consists of two sets of interleaved 36-beam observations for two adjacent 30 sq degr fields. The four data cubes were combined and we achieve a median rms of 1.5 mJy beam -1 , as demonstrated in the bottom plot. At the top right we show zoom-ins for regions A and B, centred on the galaxies NGC 3313 (face-on) and NGC 3285 (edge-on).

        <p>Our WALLABY Early Science results (based on a limited number of ASKAP antennas) and recent ASKAP-36 pilot surveys, both achieving full WALLABY depth, have already demonstrated the scientific potential of large H I surveys with widefield Phased-Array Feeds. They have also shown the capability of the 
            <rs type="software">ASKAPsoft</rs> data reduction pipeline and our post-processing software tools. Further refinement of analysis pipelines using the full 36-antenna ASKAP telescope is presently occurring, and it is expected that full WALLABY observations will commence in late 2021 after a second round of pilot surveys. Fully-reduced WALLABY data are made available to the astronomy community following quality control, with advanced data products (verified source catalogues, galaxy parameters, velocity fields etc.) being released in CASDA and updated at regular intervals.
