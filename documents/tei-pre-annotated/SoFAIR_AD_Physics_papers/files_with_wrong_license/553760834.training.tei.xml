Prominent examples of this continuous journey are the identification of a first joint source of high-energy gamma rays and neutrinos, TXS 0506 + 056 (Aartsen et al. 2018a(Aartsen et al. , 2018b)), increasing hints for the emission of high-energy neutrinos from the radio galaxy NGC1068 (Aartsen et al. 2020a), and detection of a particle shower at the Glashow resonance energy (Aartsen et al. 2021a).The field of neutrino astronomy has gained momentum since the IceCube collaboration discovered a diffuse flux of astrophysical neutrinos in multiple detection channels (Aartsen et al. 2013(Aartsen et al. , 2016(Aartsen et al. , 2020c)).

        <p>The origin of high-energy neutrinos has been predicted from nonthermal Galactic and extragalactic sources, as reviewed in Learned &amp; Mannheim (2000), Becker (2008), Halzen &amp; Klein (2010), and Ahlers &amp; Halzen (2018). As the diffuse flux detected by IceCube is close to isotropically distributed and does not follow the Galactic plane, Galactic sources have been disfavored, while still being discussed as a subdominant contribution; see Becker Tjus &amp; Merten (2020) for a summary. The prompt phase of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has also been excluded as a dominant neutrino source by dedicated IceCube analyses (Abbasi et al. 2012a;Aartsen et al. 2017d).The origin of high-energy neutrinos has been predicted from nonthermal Galactic and extragalactic sources, as reviewed in Learned &amp; Mannheim (2000), Becker (2008), Halzen &amp; Klein (2010), and Ahlers &amp; Halzen (2018).

        <p>However, prominent possible sources of neutrinos exist; for example, choked GRBs in dense environments (Senno et al. 2016;Biehl et al. 2018). A second promising source of high-energetic extragalactic sources is active galactic nuclei (AGNs; Murase et al. 2014;Kimura et al. 2015;Liu et al. 2018), including BL Lac objects (Tavecchio &amp; Ghisellini 2015;Padovani et al. 2015). Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are a third promising source class of high-energy neutrinos and ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (Farrar &amp; Piran 2014;Dai &amp; Fang 2017;Guépin &amp; Kotera 2017;Lunardini &amp; Winter 2017;Senno et al. 2017;Biehl et al. 2018;Stein et al. 2021). Here, particle acceleration could be driven by either a hidden jet, a hidden subrelativistic wind, emission from a hot corona above the accretion disk, or radiatively inefficient accretion flows (see Hayasaki 2021 for a review). Starburst galaxies have also been considered a possibly contributing source class (Loeb &amp; Waxman 2006;Tamborra et al. 2014). These models have in common that they expect neutrinos to be produced when a power-law-distributed population of cosmic rays interacts with gas or photon fields in the source or its vicinity in order to produce pions and kaons, which in turn, decay into neutrinos. These neutrinos would follow the same power law as the initial cosmic-ray population, however, effects like an energy-dependent cross section, breaks, or spectral features in the accelerated cosmic-ray spectrum can lead to deviations from a pure power law. In this paper, we present an improved measurement of the energy spectrum of astrophysical muon neutrinos, including models beyond the single power law and tests of a selection of the abovementioned models. Also, we update the sample of up-going muon tracks (θ zenith &gt; 85°) originating from the northern celestial hemisphere (Aartsen et al. 2016).However, prominent possible sources of neutrinos exist; for example, choked GRBs in dense environments (Senno et al. 2016;Biehl et al. 2018).

        <p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a gigaton-scale Cherenkov detector embedded in the Antarctic ice at the geographical South Pole (Aartsen et al. 2017a). Its fundamental building blocks are 5160 digital optical modules (DOMs). These spherical detection units each include a 10″ (25.4 cm) photomultiplier tube suited to detect weak light signals (Abbasi et al. 2010), read-out, and digitization electronics (Abbasi et al. 2009), and are positioned on 86 vertical cable strings that are arranged in a hexagonal grid. In this analysis, the data from eight strings forming the denser instrumented region of the DeepCore array (Abbasi et al. 2012b) are excluded in favor of a more homogeneous detector geometry. Neutrinos are detected indirectly via the Cherenkov light emitted by charged relativistic secondary particles. These emerge from deep inelastic neutrino-nucleon interactions which occur in the instrument and the surrounding ice or the bedrock below IceCube. The final detector configuration (IC86) was completed in 2010 December. Recording of data already occurred prior to finalization with partial configurations. Data from two such partial configurations, IC59 and IC79, are included in this analysis, with the number indicating the number of active strings.The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a gigaton-scale Cherenkov detector embedded in the Antarctic ice at the geographical South Pole (Aartsen et al. 2017a).

        <p>The presented study is based on a sample of through-going and starting muon tracks detected between 2009 May 20 and 2018 December 31. Muons can travel through the ice for hundreds or thousands of meters, producing track-like signatures in the detector. The event selection is identical to the one presented in Aartsen et al. (2016). It focuses on events with extended track-like signatures and filters out cascade-like events, which are events where the light emission region is small compared to the detector string spacing of 125 m. Such events can, for example, arise from neutral current interactions or electron-neutrino-induced charged current interactions. Neutrino-induced muon tracks are dominated by charged current interactions of muon neutrinos. A small additional energy-dependent contribution arises from muonic tau decays in tau neutrino interactions which contributes roughly 5% (Stettner 2021). This is included in the signal expectation of the analysis. The contribution of tracks from Glashow resonance interactions (Aartsen et al. 2021a) is negligible in this analysis. By restricting the field of view of the detector to zenith angles θ zenith &gt; 85°, the overwhelming background of atmospheric muons from cosmic-ray-induced air showers is successfully suppressed (purity &gt; 99.8%) as these muons are stopped in the Earth or the ice overburden before reaching IceCube. The direction of the selected muon-track events is obtained using the MPE algorithm with tabulated ice properties (Ahrens et al. 2004;Schatto 2014) and the muon energy is reconstructed using the truncated energy (DOM's method) algorithm described in Abbasi et al. (2013) which takes the stochastic energy losses of highenergy muons into account, resulting in an energy resolution of 0.22 in m E log 10 (Abbasi et al. 2013). The resulting proxy energy E μ,proxy is inherently only a lower limit on the true muon and primary neutrino energies, as the neutrino-nucleon interactions can occur outside the detection volume.The presented study is based on a sample of through-going and starting muon tracks detected between 2009 May 20 and 2018 December 31.

        <p>The event with the highest reconstructed energy from this additional period is the horizontal track event with ID II.32 (Table 7) which has an energy of more than E μ,proxy  1.1 PeV, and has also been reported as a real-time alert (Aartsen et al. 2017b). The event with the overall highest reconstructed energy has the table ID II.22, and is described in detail in Aartsen et al. (2016). The threshold E μ,proxy  200 TeV to report individual events does not change significantly with the updated best-fit parameterization for the energy spectrum discussed in Section 4. 64 The modified calibrations, however, which include a -4% shift of the charge corresponding to a single photoelectron, do lead to changes of the reconstructed energies and directions of some of the events that have been reported in Aartsen et al. (2016), shown in the rightmost three columns of Table 7. The impact on the reported quantities is small, especially for the directional reconstructions (most directions change by less than 0°. 1 and stay well within their uncertainty ranges), but for single events with special topology, deviations in reconstructed energy can occur. Notably, such deviations arise for data taken in 2010 (IC79), where the information from the DeepCore strings is now excluded. As a consequence, six of the previously reported events fall below the threshold of E μ,proxy  200 TeV. Additionally, one event (ID6 in Aartsen et al. 2016, IC79-season) does not pass the event selection anymore, because the IC79 season data as used in Aartsen et al. (2016) were based on an individual dedicated event selection, which has now been unified with the treatment of later seasons where the event selection includes additional measures to reject cascade-like events more efficiently. These had not been applied to the IC79 data previously.

        <p>In order to calculate the expected number of events at the detector, a large sample of events is simulated, taking into account the following propagation steps: the propagation of neutrinos through matter, primary neutrino-nucleon interactions (CSMS cross section: Cooper-Sarkar et al. 2011), propagation of secondary particles through the ice (PROPO-SAL code: Köhne et al. 2013), and the production and propagation of Cherenkov photons in the detector medium (Chirkin 2015),

        <p>Four flux components are considered and the expected number of events is given as a sum of these components per bin. First and second, atmospheric backgrounds are considered: conventional atmospheric neutrinos, emerging from the decay of pions and kaons in cosmic-ray-induced air showers and prompt atmospheric neutrinos from the decay of heavy charmed hadrons in the same showers. For both contributions, the prediction is updated with respect to Aartsen et al. (2016), which used a prediction from Honda et al. (2007). The software

            <rs type="software">MCEq</rs> (Fedynitch et al. 2015), is employed assuming the flux model Gaisser-H4a (Gaisser 2012) for primary cosmic rays and the hadronic interaction model Sibyll 2.3c (Fedynitch et al. 2019). Third, a subdominant contamination from atmospheric muons is expected and modeled based on a large sample of cosmic-ray air showers. The resulting model for this background flux is denoted as the muon template. It is simulated with the 
            <rs type="software">CORSIKA</rs> package (Heck et al. 1998), assuming the mentioned primary cosmic-ray and hadronic interaction models. Fourth, and most important, a signal component of astrophysical neutrinos is considered. It represents the cumulative flux from all sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, which we assume to be isotropic.

        <p>A wide range of parameterizations for the energy spectrum of the astrophysical component are investigated in Sections 4 and 5. The expected rate of events as a function of zenith and energy is visualized in Figure 1 for all four components assuming a single power-law spectrum of astrophysical neutrinos. Figure 2 further illustrates the potential to measure astrophysical neutrinos at high energies by showing the expected ratio of astrophysical signal over background.A wide range of parameterizations for the energy spectrum of the astrophysical component are investigated in Sections 4 and 5.

        <p>In order to absorb systematic uncertainties of the measurement, nuisance parameters are introduced in the fit. The first class of systematic uncertainties covers the detector response and reconstruction quality of IceCube. Optical properties of the natural ice and the ice in the man-made boreholes are considered as well as the optical detection efficiency. Compared to the last iteration of this analysis, the model of optical properties in the natural ice has been updated (Spice 3.2.1: Rongen 2019) and the impact of the ice in the boreholes (unified hole-ice model: Eller 2019) is now taken into account as an additional source of uncertainty. For each of these systematic uncertainties, dedicated simulations have been performed and the impact on reconstructed energy and zenith have been parameterized.In order to absorb systematic uncertainties of the measurement, nuisance parameters are introduced in the fit.

        <p>The second class of systematic uncertainties arises from the flux predictions of atmospheric neutrinos. Since the absolute normalization of the primary cosmic-ray flux and the yield of neutrinos from cosmic-ray-induced air showers are not known precisely, the absolute flux normalizations f conv and f prompt are free fit parameters. Additionally, the parameters Δγ CR (CR spectral index shift) and λ CR Model , which is a prior-constrained linear interpolation between the Gaisser-H4a and GST-4gen flux models (Gaisser 2012;Gaisser et al. 2013), are introduced analogously to Aartsen et al. (2016) in order to cover uncertainties on the exact spectral shape of the primary cosmic-ray flux. This shape affects all atmospheric flux components alike. Furthermore, we update the treatment of atmospheric flux uncertainties by adopting the scheme from Barr et al. (2006). By varying the relevant parameters H (pions), W (kaons), Y (kaons), and Z (kaons) within their estimated prior ranges and repeating the calculation of atmospheric fluxes, uncertainties from hadronic interaction models are covered by this suite of parameters. The parameters affecting the spectral shapes of the atmospheric fluxes are correlated with the absolute normalizations. For more details, see A.1 and Figure 6 in the supplementary material. Finally, the absolute normalization of the subdominant muon contamination is included as a parameter and allowed to vary within its estimated prior range as well, which is a Gaussian with a width of 0.5.The second class of systematic uncertainties arises from the flux predictions of atmospheric neutrinos.

(2016) in order to cover uncertainties on the exact spectral shape of the primary cosmic-ray flux. This shape affects all atmospheric flux components alike. Furthermore, we update the treatment of atmospheric flux uncertainties by adopting the scheme from Barr et al. (2006). By varying the relevant parameters H (pions), W (kaons), Y (kaons), and Z (kaons) within their estimated prior ranges and repeating the calculation of atmospheric fluxes, uncertainties from hadronic interaction models are covered by this suite of parameters. The parameters affecting the spectral shapes of the atmospheric fluxes are correlated with the absolute normalizations. For more details, see A.1 and Figure 6 in the supplementary material. Finally, the absolute normalization of the subdominant muon contamination is included as a parameter and allowed to vary within its estimated prior range as well, which is a Gaussian with a width of 0.5.</p>
        <p>The result of the likelihood fit is shown as a one-dimensional projection by the solid black line in Figure 1 together with the experimental data. At energies above E μ,proxy  100 TeV, the excess of astrophysical neutrinos above the atmospheric components is clearly visible. Overall, the data are well described by the sum of atmospheric components and an astrophysical component following the standard paradigm of a single power-law energy spectrum. Figure 7 in the supplementary material shows the statistical pull for all bins in the two-dimensional histogram indicating no obvious mismatches. Taking the systematic and statistical uncertainty of the best-fit expectation into account, a χ 2 /(degrees of freedom) for the single power-law fit is calculated to be 1.0, resulting in a p-value of 50% and confirming that the fit result is a viable description of the measured data. The corresponding best-fit parameters of the astrophysical flux are listed in Table 2 and the profiled likelihood landscape of the two astrophysical signal parameters is shown in Figure 3. The sensitive energy range of the astrophysical measurement is determined by comparing the per-bin likelihood values of the best-fit hypothesis to the values obtained when repeating the fit assuming a background hypothesis. The true neutrino energy distribution is then weighted with these likelihood differences, and the central 90% range of the obtained distribution is E ν = 15 TeV-5 PeV. This energy range extends to lower energies than previous measurements, where this energy range extended from E ν = 200 TeV-8 PeV (Aartsen et al. 2016). This change is driven by the updated modeling of the conventional atmospheric flux in this energy region.The result of the likelihood fit is shown as a one-dimensional projection by the solid black line in Figure 1 together with the experimental data.

        <p>We find that the normalization of prompt atmospheric neutrinos is constrained less strongly compared to the last publication. This is related to the observed softening of the spectral index of the astrophysical neutrino flux, resulting in an overall more similar shape of the two flux components. For the calculation of a prompt limit, the dominating astrophysical flux in the regions below the sensitive energy range of this analysis poses a fundamental limitation to our ability to quantitatively constrain the subdominant flux of prompt neutrinos.We find that the normalization of prompt atmospheric neutrinos is constrained less strongly compared to the last publication.

        <p>It has been checked in detail that the measurement of the astrophysical component is not impacted by the prompt flux normalization: for example, we find a spectral index of γ SPL = 2.33, well within the quoted uncertainty range, if the likelihood fit is repeated with the prompt component fixed to its nominal prediction (f prompt = 1.0). Also, the observed suppression of the prompt component occurs at similar strength when the likelihood fit is repeated while excluding energies above ≈ 15 TeV, confining it to an energy region dominated by conventional atmospheric neutrinos and well below the sensitive energy range for astrophysical neutrinos. The exact reason for this nonobservation remains an open question and an updated limit on the prompt flux normalization with respect to Aartsen et al. (2016) is not computed here.It has been checked in detail that the measurement of the astrophysical component is not impacted by the prompt flux normalization: for example, we find a spectral index of γ SPL = 2.33, well within the quoted uncertainty range, if the likelihood fit is repeated with the prompt component fixed to its nominal prediction (f prompt = 1.0).

        <p>Power-law energy spectra are well motivated from the assumed acceleration mechanisms of cosmic rays, but they extrapolate over large energy ranges and potential structures in the energy spectrum can thus not be identified. In this section, a number of parameterizations beyond a single power law are compared to the experimental data.

        <p>The first natural extension to the single power law would be a cutoff in the energy spectrum, e.g., introduced if an astrophysical source of cosmic rays (and neutrinos) reaches its maximum energy. The flux parameterization given in Equation (3) extends the single power law with an exponentially decaying term. The cutoff neutrino energy E cutoff is consequently added as a third signal parameter in the likelihood fit: 3 lists the obtained fit result using this parameterization: while the astrophysical normalization does not change strongly, a hard spectral index of g = is found. Compared to the single power-law hypothesis, the fit improves by 2ΔLLH = 4.24. The probability to randomly achieve any such improvement by introducing E cutoff corresponds to a p-value of p( &gt; 2ΔLLH|SPL) = 6.1%, which is calculated from pseudoexperiments obtained from Monte Carlo simulations.The first natural extension to the single power law would be a cutoff in the energy spectrum, e.g., introduced if an astrophysical source of cosmic rays (and neutrinos) reaches its maximum energy.

        <p>In order to overcome the limitations of the parameterizations discussed in previous sections, a "piece-wise" model is introduced. Here, the energy spectrum is described as sum of power laws with a fixed spectral index (γ = 2.0) in pre-defined, fixed segments of neutrino energy. This allows for measuring the flux strength in a well-defined range of neutrino energy and enables easy comparison to predictions from the literature and to other measurements. The total flux strength is then given by Equation (5), where the flux normalizations per bin f i piece are fit parameters and E i low and E i high form the bounds of bin i.In order to overcome the limitations of the parameterizations discussed in previous sections, a "piece-wise" model is introduced.

Additionally, one segment above and below have been added, respectively, to cover the full energy range. The full parameterization of the astrophysical flux is given in Equation (5), and the energy ranges and obtained best-fit normalizations f i piece are listed in Table 5. Figure 4 visualizes the obtained flux measurement of the piecewise parameterization together with the results of the single power law, power law with cutoff, and log-parabola models. In all models beyond the single power law, hints for a softening of the spectral shape as a function of energy are found.Prior to performing the fit on the experimental data, the energy ranges of the segments were defined to be equally spaced in logenergy spanning the sensitive energy range of the astrophysical measurement (see Section 4) with three segments.

        <p>Besides the wide range of generic parameterizations for the energy spectrum discussed in the sections above, it is also possible to compare the experimental data to source-class specific flux predictions directly. The total astrophysical flux may originate from multiple source classes, thus it is not expected that a single flux prediction can fully explain the observed data. Instead, we model the total astrophysical component as sum of the predicted energy spectrum model times a free normalization f model and a single power law to cover other potential flux contributions:Besides the wide range of generic parameterizations for the energy spectrum discussed in the sections above, it is also possible to compare the experimental data to source-class specific flux predictions directly.

The test statistic TS free model from Equation (7) compares the best-fit result including the additional component of the source-class specific flux prediction to the hypothesis of only a single power law. That is, TS free model = 0 implies that the description of the experimental data can not be improved with an additional contribution from the model prediction and the fit instead prefers the single power-law model. For these cases, upper limits on the model normalization are computed at 90% CL employing Wilks' theorem.A representative set of different source-class specific predictions have been selected, focusing on predictions not already covered by the performed test of a single power law, and including variations of the benchmark models shown in the publications (see Table 6).

Our update consists of more than three years of additional data (roughly doubling statistics), a re-processing of the full data with latest calibration and filtering standards (Pass-2) and an updated treatment of systematic uncertainties (detector effects and atmospheric fluxes).

        <p>The nuisance parameters are included in the fit to cover the systematic uncertainties affecting this measurement, with the goal of measuring an unbiased result. The scheme from Barr et al. (2006) was adopted to cover atmospheric flux uncertainties. Previous analyses used a parameter describing the ratio between the integrated neutrino fluxes arising from kaon and pion decays, respectively (Aartsen et al. 2016;Haack &amp; IceCube Collaboration 2018). In principle, the Barr scheme allows for an uncertainty in the production yield of each individual meson, for example pions and antipions. Different from a global scaling of these production yields, each parameter describes uncertainties in a specific region of meson production phase space, with the goal of having different parameters for regions dominated by different physical effects and with different experimental coverage. Since the total n n + flux is measured in this analysis, the parameters for mesons and antimesons can be combined into single parameters here. Flux gradients are then calculated from flux predictions obtained with different parameter values, and the Barr parameters in the fit then scale this gradient to obtain a flux prediction depending on parameter value. Since they affect the neutrino production, the Barr parameters are correlated to the absolute normalization of the conventional atmospheric flux, but crucially also introduce energy-dependent flux variations (Stettner 2021). The correlations between the nuisance parameters are shown in Figure 6. Best-fit parameters and uncertainty contours for the single power-law hypothesis are drawn for studies based on high-energy starting events (Abbasi et al. 2021), cascade-like events (Aartsen et al. 2020c), and an inelasticity study (Aartsen et al. 2019) by IceCube. ANTARES observes a mild excess of events over the expected atmospheric backgrounds in a combined study of tracks and cascades (Fusco &amp; Versari 2019).The nuisance parameters are included in the fit to cover the systematic uncertainties affecting this measurement, with the goal of measuring an unbiased result. The scheme from Barr et al. (2006) was adopted to cover atmospheric flux uncertainties. Previous analyses used a parameter describing the ratio between the integrated neutrino fluxes arising from kaon and pion decays, respectively (Aartsen et al. 2016;Haack &amp; IceCube Collaboration 2018). In principle, the Barr scheme allows for an uncertainty in the production yield of each individual meson, for example pions and antipions.
