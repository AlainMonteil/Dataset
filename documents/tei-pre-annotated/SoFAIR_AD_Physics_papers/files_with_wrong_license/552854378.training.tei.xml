        <p>We compute the spherically averaged power spectrum from four seasons of data obtained for the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) project observed with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). We measure the EoR power spectrum over k = 0.07-3.0 h Mpc -1 at redshifts z = 6.5-8.7. The largest aggregation of 110 h on EoR0 high band (3340 observations), yields a lowest measurement of (43 mK) 2 = 1.8 × 10 3 mK 2 at k = 0.14 h Mpc -1 and z = 6.5 (2σ thermal noise plus sample variance). Using the Real-Time System to calibrate and the CHIPS pipeline to estimate power spectra, we select the best observations from the central five pointings within the 2013-2016 observing seasons, observing three independent fields and in two frequency bands. This yields 13 591 2-min snapshots (453 h), based on a quality assurance metric that measures ionospheric activity. We perform another cut to remove poorly calibrated data, based on power in the foreground-dominated and EoR-dominated regions of the two-dimensional power spectrum, reducing the set to 12 569 observations (419 h). These data are processed in groups of 20 observations, to retain the capacity to identify poor data, and used to analyse the evolution and structure of the data over field, frequency, and data quality. We subsequently choose the cleanest 8935 observations (298 h of data) to form integrated power spectra over the different fields, pointings, and redshift ranges.We compute the spherically averaged power spectrum from four seasons of data obtained for the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) project observed with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA).

        <p>Currently, LOFAR, LWA, and MWA are contributing ongoing and dedicated effort to analyse the thousands of hours of data collected by their experiments, and are publishing results from the best of these data. Recent reported measurements include those of Patil et al. (2017) and Gehlot et al. (2019) from LOFAR, Eastwood et al. (2019) from LWA, and Barry et al. (2019b) and Li et al. (2019) from MWA. LOFAR have deep observations in two fields (NCP and 3C 196), although all published work uses the NCP field only. The PAPER array has also replaced all of their previous results with a robust re-analysis of their data (Cheng et al. 2018;Kolopanis et al. 2019). However, these reports have often used relatively small sets of data, obtained over a given observing field and in a limited time duration. In this work, we use data quality metrics to assess the quality of 13 591 MWA observations (453 h) observed from 2013 August to 2017 January over three observing fields and in two bands. These bands span 139-197 MHz, corresponding to z = 9.3-6.2, a time when the EoR signal is expected to be observed in emission with respect to the CMB, and decreasing in power with decreasing redshift. We present multiredshift limits from the largest set of data ever aggregated, moving from the sets of tens of hours towards the thousand-hour nominal data-set required to yield a detection. The breadth and depth of the data sets provide a stringent set of results that set the path forward for the MWA experiment and future SKA.Currently, LOFAR, LWA, and MWA are contributing ongoing and dedicated effort to analyse the thousands of hours of data collected by their experiments, and are publishing results from the best of these data.

Algorithmically, the power spectrum is formed from a data cube with dimensions (u, v, f), where the angular Fourier Transform to (u, v) is performed natively by the interferometer, and the spectral channels are used to map the line of sight. Data are observed over time and integrated together coherently by gridding measured visibilities on to a common discretized uv-plane.

        <p>The alternative approach to approximating the power spectrum is the delay transform (Parsons et al. 2012;Jacobs et al. 2015). Here, each individual baseline's data are Fourier Transformed along its frequency channels, and the power formed through their squared quantities. This approach is straight forward, but can be difficult to interpret cosmologically, because the k-vectors are non-orthogonal except on short baselines (the line-of-sight transform evolves with frequency) and there is no angular correlation encoded between baselines with similar lengths and orientations. None the less, the delay transform is very useful for quality assurance to ensure the visibility data are not corrupted or contaminated in the regions of parameter space used for EoR analysis (i.e. the 'EoR Window', a region of k ⊥ , k parameter space outside of the region expected to be dominated by smooth-spectrum foregrounds).The alternative approach to approximating the power spectrum is the delay transform (Parsons et al. 2012;Jacobs et al. 2015).

        <p>CHIPS -the Cosmological HI Power Spectrum estimator (Trott et al. 2016) -is one of the signal processing pipelines used by the MWA EoR collaboration for taking calibrated data and processing them to output power spectra, with associated uncertainties. In its original form, it was intended to undertake a full thermal noise plus residual foreground signal inverse covariance weighting, to optimally extract cosmological information. There are difficulties with this approach, and these were explored in the literature at the time, and have more recently been demonstrated in the retracted results from the PAPER collaboration (Cheng et al. 2018). Inaccurate residual foreground models, and failure to fully and independently understand their internal covariance and covariance pointings. The rotation of foreground structures through different primary beam responses combined with the evolution of the beam response with frequency, lead to shifting foreground contamination in parameter space. In particular, the ratio demonstrates the changing horizon power over pointings. The black solid (dashed) lines correspond to the horizon (first beam null) for a flat-spectrum point source.CHIPS -the Cosmological HI Power Spectrum estimator (Trott et al. 2016) -is one of the signal processing pipelines used by the MWA EoR collaboration for taking calibrated data and processing them to output power spectra, with associated uncertainties.

        <p>Line-of-sight modes for computing the power spectrum are extracted from spectral sampling of the data. The MWA's signal processing chain contains filterbanks that yield 24 coarse channels of 1.28 MHz over the full 30.72 MHz band. Within these coarse channels, the native spectral resolution is 10 kHz, but EoR data are observed at 40 kHz resolution and processed at 80 kHz resolution. The shape of the fine polyphase filterbank leads to poor bandpass characteristics at the coarse channel edges, and as such, a single 80 kHz channel is flagged at each end of each coarse channel. This yields regularly spaced missing channels in the final output visibilities. A Fourier Transform over the data to retrieve the line-of-sight spatial scales will contain a comb shape due to these missing channels, where the k = 0 mode is copied in harmonics of the coarse channel separation. There are several ways to handle this; in this implementation of CHIPS, we use an ordinary kriging (a Gaussian Process Regression) to provide an interpolate of these data that uses the covariance structure of the data (Wackernagel 2003;Rasmussen &amp; Nickisch 2010). Kriging has been used to fit for foregrounds in LOFAR EoR data sets, using an optimized set of hyperparameters (Mertens et al. 2018). The kriging kernel (variogram) is estimated conservatively to contain a noiselike variance and a frequency covariance which decays smoothly across several megahertz.

This is a function of the data that have been calibrated, and not a reflection on the overall contributions of each. However, in general EoR2 is observable at the end of the season, and there are fewer hours available for it than for EoR0 and EoR1.</p>
        <p>The data used in this work span Phase I and II of the array. Despite redundancy being available in Phase II, and used in other MWA pipelines such as Fast Holographic Deconvolution (FHD; Barry et al. 2019a) plus Omnical (Li et al. 2018(Li et al. , 2019;;Zhang et al. ), the RTS calibration currently only performs sky-based calibration. Given the interest in understanding the utility of hybrid arrays with redundant and non-redundant baselines, it would be useful to compare the results for the different configurations. Unfortunately, the data in this work are 92 per cent Phase I and 8 per cent Phase II, with no individual Phase II set exceeding 5 h. As such, comparison of data sets suffers from the small and concentrated number of observations, and is not useful. Data used in this work were observed over five pointings, separated by ∼6.8 • on the sky (27 min per pointing), corresponding to the beamformer analogue delay settings that produce a consistent primary beam response. Of all of the pointings, the five central pointings (including zenith) are found to have the least contaminated power (Beardsley et al. 2016), and have the most well-behaved beam patterns, and are used exclusively in this work. Off-zenith pointings are only pursued for EoR0 and EoR2, because the zenith results from these fields are sufficiently interesting to warrant coherently combining data from differing pointings. Table 1 lists the Alt/Az and name for each pointing used here.The data used in this work span Phase I and II of the array.

        <p>The data were selected by extracting all of the observations available in the MWA database (hosted by the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre) from 2013 to 2017, which had been successfully calibrated with the RTS (output files were produced with finite values, and bandpass and phase plots looked reasonable), had complete calibrated visibility files with the standard temporal (8 s) and spectral (80 kHz) resolution, and had an ionospheric activity metric value associated with them. In all cases, the most recently processed calibration was used, with processing dates ranging from 2017-2019. The same RTS version was used for all processing. Most data that satisfy the requirements are from 2013-2017.

        <p>There are four main quality assurance metrics applied to refine the data set to be selected for power spectrum analysis: (1) calibration success (no errors; all frequencies present with finite-valued data), (2) ionospheric activity, (3) delay-space EoR Window Power, and (4) delay-space EoR Wedge Power. Here, we describe these metrics and the order in which they are applied.There are four main quality assurance metrics applied to refine the data set to be selected for power spectrum analysis: (1) calibration success (no errors; all frequencies present with finite-valued data), (2) ionospheric activity, (3) delay-space EoR Window Power, and (4) delay-space EoR Wedge Power.

        <p>(i) Calibration: Data are calibrated using the MWA Real-Time System (RTS; Mitchell et al. 2008;Jacobs et al. 2016;Trott et al. 2016); the RTS performs direction-independent and directiondependent (DD) calibration. It uses the primary beam model from Sokolowski et al. (2017) to select the 1000 apparent brightest sources for each snapshot pointing for calibration. The brightest five are used for DD calibration with a full Jones matrix solution for each source. These DD solutions are applied to the full set of 1000, effectively peeling five and directly subtracting the remaining 995. These calibrated data are fed through a validation process that confirms existence of all spectral channels with finite-valued data;(i) Calibration: Data are calibrated using the MWA Real-Time System (RTS; Mitchell et al. 2008;Jacobs et al. 2016;Trott et al. 2016); the RTS performs direction-independent and directiondependent (DD) calibration.

        <p>(ii) Ionospheric activity: we use the ionospheric activity metric developed by Jordan et al. (2017), which uses the measured versus expected source positions of 1000 point sources in the field of view to estimate an ionospheric phase screen, and derive an activity metric that combines median source offset with sourceoffset anisotropy. Different thresholds are set for Phase I and Phase II data sets, where the reduced angular resolution of the latter array configuration yields a higher base activity level;(ii) Ionospheric activity: we use the ionospheric activity metric developed by Jordan et al.

        <p>(iii) Window Power: we use the delay transform power spectrum estimator to compute the power in the EoR Window, below the MWA's first coarse channel harmonic. Power is computed incoherently across baselines. Window Power is computed in the region bounded by the main beam lobe and the first coarse channel harmonic, for baselines with length &lt;100λ (0 &lt; | u| &lt; 100λ, k ⊥ &lt; k &lt; 0.4);(iii) Window Power: we use the delay transform power spectrum estimator to compute the power in the EoR Window, below the MWA's first coarse channel harmonic.

        <p>(iv) Wedge Power: we use the delay transform power spectrum estimator to compute the power below the EoR Window, in the primary beam main lobe wedge. Power is computed incoherently across baselines. The Wedge Power is computed for a region bounded by k = 0 and the main beam lobe wedge, also for baselines with length &lt;100λ (0 &lt; | u| &lt; 100λ, k ⊥ &gt; k &gt; 0). Both are normalized by the number of contributing cells to yield an average power per cell (Jy 2 ).(iv) Wedge Power: we use the delay transform power spectrum estimator to compute the power below the EoR Window, in the primary beam main lobe wedge.

        <p>Using these metrics, cuts are made as follows, with the intent that unusually high-valued, or unusually low-valued snapshots are omitted. We take the full data set and compute the average and standard deviation wedge and window power metrics for each data type (Phase I or II, and high and low band). We omit snapshots that have wedge and window power values that fall outside of the primary mode of the distribution of values, and also snapshots that show consistent wedge power but high window power. The ionospheric cuts are made based on the metric values that are expected to produce biased results according to the analysis of Trott et al. (2017). After the cuts are applied, data sets are then ordered by ionospheric metric value only. The distributions of Window Power are not Gaussian, and are generally multimodal. Fig. 1 displays the distribution for EoR0 high band, with blue denoting included observations, and red denoting omitted. There is a clear separation of the two clusters, suggesting that calibration errors, and not statistical fluctuations, are the primary cause. This distinct behaviour is also observed for the other data sets. The data cuts are conservative in so far as all observations in the primary mode are included for all data sets.Using these metrics, cuts are made as follows, with the intent that unusually high-valued, or unusually low-valued snapshots are omitted.

        <p>Table 2 describes the components of each data set, and the changes after each stage of assessment. Figs 2, 3, 4, and5 show examples of power in the EoR window versus ionospheric activity for different fields and frequencies. The omitted observations plotted in these figures are all from Phase I; Phase II observations extracted from the data base were consistent with a quiet ionosphere. Blue and green filled circles denote observations that meet the assessment criteria for Phase I and II, respectively. Open red circles are observations that are omitted due to high Window power or high ionospheric activity. These cuts remove 10-20 per cent of the data. The majority of the removed data contain particular tiles or baselines with very poor calibration, leading to excess power in those modes.Table 2 describes the components of each data set, and the changes after each stage of assessment.

        <p>Correctly calculating the normalization from measurement units (Jansky and Hertz) to cosmological units (megaparsecs) seems trivial, but is complicated by the choices made during the analysis pipeline (e.g. cross-multiplying even and odd samples for the cross power spectrum, and the definition of Stokes I with respect to polarization axes). It is important to ensure that the normalization is correct, and that signal is not being lost due to coherence of coherently gridded data. The former can be ensured via matching of different approaches to calculating the noise, and to internal consistency between independent MWA analysis pipelines (Barry et al. 2019a). The latter can be achieved using a signal simulation; ensuring that the input power spectrum is recovered after passing through the CHIPS pipeline.Correctly calculating the normalization from measurement units (Jansky and Hertz) to cosmological units (megaparsecs) seems trivial, but is complicated by the choices made during the analysis pipeline (e.g. cross-multiplying even and odd samples for the cross power spectrum, and the definition of Stokes I with respect to polarization axes).

        <p>We performed a large simulation using a modified version of 21cm FAST (Mesinger, Furlanetto &amp; Cen 2011;B. Greig private communication), tuned to the MWA's large primary beam size and frequency resolution. A box with 6400 pixels on each side was produced, with 7500 cMpc on angular sides, and 1.172 cMpc lineof-sight resolution. This large simulation is important for creating simulations that can be directly applied to MWA, without need for padding or interpolation. The data are produced as a light-cone, with signal evolution as a function of redshift. We apply a beam model to the slices, perform an angular Fourier Transform, and convert the brightness temperature units to Jansky per steradian.We performed a large simulation using a modified version of 21cm FAST (Mesinger, Furlanetto &amp; Cen 2011;B.

        <p>Fig. 6 shows the input EoR 21cm power spectrum over 384 channels centred at z = 6.8 (green) and the signal power recovered through CHIPS (red). This demonstrates good consistency of the input and output signal levels in both shape and amplitude. Given that we do not perform any post-calibration subtraction of signal from the data, these results provide confidence that signal loss is not occurring in the CHIPS pipeline.Fig. 6 shows the input EoR 21cm power spectrum over 384 channels centred at z = 6.8 (green) and the signal power recovered through CHIPS (red).

        <p>In addition to the regular simulation, we also perform the same operation but with the missing channels corresponding to those in the actual data. We apply the kriging to the mitigate the missing channels and check that the output power levels are still consistent. This procedure demonstrates that (1) the kriging is not biasing the results, and (2) that kriging is offering no benefit at small k, but does close to the coarse channel harmonics. Note that we do not use those harmonic modes in our measurements. Fig. 7 shows the 1D power spectra from the same simulation with the kriging applied (blue) and the full data set (red). The contaminated modes, where there is a discrepancy, correspond to the location of the coarse channel harmonic. The primary results shown in this work are for k &lt; 0.4 h Mpc -1 .In addition to the regular simulation, we also perform the same operation but with the missing channels corresponding to those in the actual data.

        <p>We also compare simulation outputs through RTS-CHIPS with those through FHD-ppsilon (Barry et al. 2019b), to ensure power and noise-level consistency. A similar EoR simulation was produced and passed through both pipelines, yielding consistent results (Barry, private communication). Although, this deviates somewhat from previous MWA EoR papers where the actual data sets were processed through both pipelines (Fig. 7, Beardsley et al. 2016;Barry et al. 2019b;Li et al. 2019), this retains the same philosophy of ensuring robustness of results using independent calibration and analysis methods.We also compare simulation outputs through RTS-CHIPS with those through FHD-ppsilon (Barry et al. 2019b), to ensure power and noise-level consistency.

        <p>The data are divided into their respective fields and observing bands. In order to present results that are cosmologically relevant, the data need to be analysed in sub-bands to ensure signal ergodicity within the volume (i.e. the signal does not evolve over the bandwidth of the experiment). For these data, we use a set 15.36 MHz band, which, after tapering by the line-of-sight Blackman-Harris window function, yields an effective bandwidth of ∼10 MHz. For our purposes, this amounts to three overlapping 15.36 MHz bands (192 channels) within the 30.72 MHz (384 channels), with a 96-channel separation between the centres of each. This leads to a correlation level of 3 per cent within each band between redshift bins, and 0 per cent between bands, which should be accounted for in future parameter estimation work.The data are divided into their respective fields and observing bands.

        <p>In addition to the different fields and bands, some data sets have both zenith and off-zenith pointings. Ideally, given that these observation sets have the same phase centre, these should be able to be added coherently to obtain the best thermal noise reduction. However, the instrument response changes between pointings, and it is important that we can demonstrate that coherent addition does not lead to signal loss through decoherence.In addition to the different fields and bands, some data sets have both zenith and off-zenith pointings.

        <p>For all data, we take consistent cuts to average from 2D to 1D: k &gt; 3.5k ⊥ ; k &gt; 0.15h Mpc -1 ; 0.01 ≥ k ⊥ ≥ 0.04h Mpc -1 . These cuts are bounded by the angular modes that are well-sampled by the MWA baselines, and line-of-sight modes that lie outside of the foreground horizon line (plus a k = 0.05 h Mpc -1 buffer). Note that formation of 1D power spectra is made directly from the 3D modes, and not through 2D. We start by displaying some of the range of data found in each of the sets of 20 observations, as indicative of the qualitative difference between clean and contaminated data. Fig. 8 shows the 1D full-band power spectra from the EoR0Low field zenith sets, as an example. There is a clear distinction between the clustered data and the erroneous data. These contaminated data sets may only contain one bad observation, but that can be enough to cause excess power. We subsequently remove the clearly contaminated data, and retain only the clustered data. We are careful to cut conservatively, in order to avoid biasing the data by cleaning normal, but statistically high, data. Some data sets show no contaminated sets, and all data are retained for further analysis. Despite the Window and Wedge power cuts made to the initial data, outlier power spectra can still arise. This is due to the power spectra being formed from a smaller sub-set of the data than used for the cuts, and the conservative cuts made initially to the data sets.For all data, we take consistent cuts to average from 2D to 1D: k &gt; 3.5k ⊥ ; k &gt; 0.15h Mpc -1 ; 0.01 ≥ k ⊥ ≥ 0.04h Mpc -1 .

        <p>In the results that follow, kriging to in-paint the missing channels is always applied with the same set of hyperparameters. In some cases, this does a poor job to cleanly smooth over the missing data, most notably for the low-band data. Instead of trying to optimize the hyperparameters and potentially biasing the results, we leave them as fixed and accept poorer performance in these modes. The source of the poor performance is not likely the missing channels themselves, but an increased signal variance observed in edge channels for some data sets that is due to poor bandpass calibration.In the results that follow, kriging to in-paint the missing channels is always applied with the same set of hyperparameters.

        <p>EoR0 is centred at RA = 0 h, Dec = -27 • and contains no major extended radio sources. It is the best studied of the MWA EoR fields, with all currently published results derived from it. Fig. 9 shows the primary beam response at 180 MHz of the Minus2, Zenith, and Plus2 pointings. The setting Galactic Centre is prominent in the Minus2 pointing. Fig. 10 shows the 2D power spectrum for the best observations from the five central pointings (colour scale and parameter space have been reduced to highlight differences), and the ratio of Minus2 to Plus2 pointings. The diagonal stripes of increased power show the sidelobes of the primary beam response, and the ratio shows the changing horizon power. EoR0 high-band zenith contains the largest number of observations in the whole data set. To test the utility of continuing to add further zenith data, and the usefulness of the metrics we have used for data selection, we can study the 1D power spectrum for different subsets of the data: 300, 500, 680, and 820 observations (Fig. 11). There is little improvement in adding extra data from 300 observations onwards, until the final aggregation with 820 observations. The data are ordered only by ionospheric metric, and therefore the window power can change from observationto-observation (after initial cuts). However, these data are all selected to be ionospherically quiet and these results indicate that contamination in the EoR Window may be a stronger selector for high-quality data than ionospheric activity. To test this, we order the EoR0 high-band data by window power, and compute the 1D power spectra for the first 20 sets of 20 snapshots. This results in power levels in the k = 0.07-0.2 h Mpc -1 range that are 1.5-1.7 times lower than ordering on ionospheric metric, consistent with the window power being a stronger selector. In either case, the power spectra are clearly systematics dominated, exceeding the thermal noise level across most scales.EoR0 is centred at RA = 0 h, Dec = -27 • and contains no major extended radio sources.

        <p>Fig. 12 shows the measured 1D power spectra from the five central pointings and the lowest redshift, z = 6.5 (182-197 MHz). They are broadly consistent. Thermal noise curves at 2σ are shown as the green diagonal lines for the zenith (1000 observations) and Minus1 pointing (500 observations) to give indicative noise levels. The Galactic Centre having set in the later pointings (Plus1, Plus2) seems to translate into lower power for these.Fig. 12 shows the measured 1D power spectra from the five central pointings and the lowest redshift, z = 6.5 (182-197 MHz).

The Plus2 pointing has been omitted due to the small data set that remained after the quality assurance cuts were applied. The results are poorer at the higher redshift. This is due to a combination of higher system temperature, increased ionospheric distortion, broader primary beam shape, and larger distance to the field, with the increased beam size capturing more Galactic emission of prime importance.Fig. 13 shows the equivalent lowest redshift band for the EoR0Low data (z = 7.8).

        <p>Fig. 14 shows the sky map and primary beam response in the high and low band for the zenith pointing of the EoR1 field. Fornax A, a several hundred Jansky extended radio galaxy, appears in the main beam lobe, contributing tens of Janskys of apparent flux density into the data. Previous work has shown that accurate removal of Fornax A is crucial for scientifically useful results from the EoR1 field (Procopio et al. 2017). For these data, the Fornax A calibration model used a preliminary shapelet-based model. Future calibrations will use an improved shapelet model, which has been demonstrated to be more accurate than the previous shapelet model and a point source-based model (Line et al. in preparation), although this does not seem to be the largest systematic in this field. We expect that results from this field will improve with the new calibration.Fig. 14 shows the sky map and primary beam response in the high and low band for the zenith pointing of the EoR1 field.

        <p>Fig. 15 shows the measured 1D power spectrum (solid line) and the power plus 2σ noise uncertainty for the best 600 observations (20 h) from EoR1 high band from the zenith pointing. Fig. 16 then shows the measured 1D power spectrum and power plus 2σ noise uncertainty for the best 800 observations (27 h) from EoR1 low band from the zenith pointing. The results are substantially poorer than those from the EoR0 field, likely owing to the more complicated, and less developed, sky model required to calibrate data and peel foregrounds.Fig. 15 shows the measured 1D power spectrum (solid line) and the power plus 2σ noise uncertainty for the best 600 observations (20 h) from EoR1 high band from the zenith pointing.

        <p>The robustness of this conclusion, and the reproducibility of the increased power, can be tested by splitting the data into two equal data sets of 300 observations and computing the power. This produces power spectra that are statistically equivalent, suggesting that overall data quality for the EoR1 field with this calibration model is reduced, rather than particular poor observations contaminating the results.The robustness of this conclusion, and the reproducibility of the increased power, can be tested by splitting the data into two equal data sets of 300 observations and computing the power.

        <p>The EoR2 field is centred at RA = 10 h, Dec. = -10 deg. It contains the bright radio galaxy Hydra A on the edge of the main lobe of the primary beam, and the Galactic Plane with the Puppis A supernova remnant and Centaurus A rotating through a 0.1-1.0 per cent sidelobe. Fig. 17 shows the primary beam response at 180 MHz for three pointings used in this work and the EoR2 field. The Galactic Plane is most prominent in the Plus2 pointing, with structure over a range of spatial scales. Given its location in a sidelobe, we expect its power spectrum signature to imprint power along the horizon line at a range of k modes. The degree of structure in the beam sidelobes will result in time-dependent instrumental spectral indices for these complex sources, and the best outcomes for EoR2 will require subtraction of models for the Galactic Plane and prominent features.The EoR2 field is centred at RA = 10 h, Dec. = -10 deg.

        <p>The equivalent 2D power spectra from each pointing, and the ratio of power in the Minus2 to Plus2 pointings, are shown in Fig. 18. The aggregated data include 1420 observations and are therefore representative of the signal in the pointings (i.e. not thermal-noise dominated). The parameter space and colour scale have been reduced to highlight the differences outside of the main foreground-dominated region at low k . The data broadly show more contamination in the EoR window (k &lt; 0.4) than was observed with the EoR0 field. This is due to the increased Galactic Plane power in the beam in EoR2, the simple two point-source model used for Hydra A, and the fact that the sky model for EoR0 has received a lot of attention from the collaboration, while EoR2 has been largely ignored (i.e. EoR0 is our primary field). Encouraging results in this work will motivate a better focus of effort on the EoR2 sky model. Fig. 19 shows the 1D power spectra from each of the five central pointings. There is some statistically different behaviour from different pointings. This is likely owing to the changing spectral and spatial sampling of the Galactic Plane and major extended radio galaxies. Without careful modelling of this field, which will be explored in coming work, we can only speculate about these differences.The equivalent 2D power spectra from each pointing, and the ratio of power in the Minus2 to Plus2 pointings, are shown in Fig. 18.

        <p>Ultimately, the aim is to combine data from individual pointings coherently. The data have been processed using the same phase centre, with a common framework, and with an optimal weighting to allow for coherent addition of data (i.e. the weights are carried through the analysis such that separate data sets can be added using an optimal weighting). However, the primary beam response of the telescope changes appreciably between pointings, and there is scope for decoherence if the telescope response is not correctly modelled, which would lead to undesirable signal loss.Ultimately, the aim is to combine data from individual pointings coherently.

        <p>We can test for this decoherence by comparing the regions of parameter space that should be consistent, e.g. the foregrounddominated EoR Wedge region at low k . Because this is sky power, it should be retained between pointings and upon coherent addition of pointings. It will not be identical; the different sky response will mean that the power is in different locations, but it should retain an overall power level. Fig. 20 plots the k = 0 mode power for the zenith (red), off-zenith (green), and combined (black) data sets for EoR0High at z = 6.5. The power is retained during coherent addition. Fig. 21 then displays the ratio (left) and fractional difference (right) of 2D power for the zenith pointing and combined pointings. A ratio consistent with unity and small fractional difference (&lt; 10 per cent) in the foreground wedge (low k ) demonstrates that combining pointings coherently is reasonable, because power is not being lost.We can test for this decoherence by comparing the regions of parameter space that should be consistent, e.g. the foregrounddominated EoR Wedge region at low k .

        <p>Having established that coherent addition of data from the same observing field and frequency range, is possible, we combine the best zenith-pointed observations with the four off-zenith pointings for EoR0 high and low bands, and the EoR2 high and low bands. Note that we do not present off-zenith pointings for the EoR1 field, due to the poor results from the zenith data. The results for the lowest nine wavenumbers and each field and redshift are presented in Table 3, and the best results at each redshift are reproduced in Table 4.Having established that coherent addition of data from the same observing field and frequency range, is possible, we combine the best zenith-pointed observations with the four off-zenith pointings for EoR0 high and low bands, and the EoR2 high and low bands.

        <p>The results of combining data from different pointings for EoR0 and EoR2 demonstrate better performance in EoR0 at low redshift and EoR2 at high redshift. Given that the distributions of ionospheric activity and EoR Window Power are comparable between the fields, this is likely due to the different Galactic and extended structures drifting through the primary beam sidelobes as a function of frequency. The MWA primary beam introduces strong spectral gradients in the beam nulls, amplifying any effect of mis-modelling of the sources or primary beam in this regions, and potentially imprinting strong spectral structure on residual signals.The results of combining data from different pointings for EoR0 and EoR2 demonstrate better performance in EoR0 at low redshift and EoR2 at high redshift.

        <p>In EoR0, the Galaxy presents more prominently at low frequency due to the larger beam size, whereas the Puppis A, Centaurus A, and Centaurus B sources in the EoR2 sidelobes may be better placed with respect to large spectral gradients in the primary beam. Fig. 26 demonstrates this in the high band 2D power spectrum, showing the ratio and difference of the power in the EoR0-EoR2 fields. Aside from an overall decrement in the power in EoR0 (red), there is a power increase along the horizon modes in EoR0, indicative of the effect of the spectrally smooth Galactic Plane. Conversely, the lack of any extended models for the spectrally complex Centaurus A and Puppis A sources leads to additional leaked power in the EoR Window on large scales. We can study the instrumental response to the sky for the pointings where the results are best: EoR0 in high band, and EoR2 in low band. In Figs 27 and 28, we overlay the sky with the spectral gradient of the primary beam response, for the zenith pointing of EoR0 and EoR2, respectively (Cook &amp; Seymour, private communication). In the right-hand plots, the beam gradient is shown separately for clarity.In EoR0, the Galaxy presents more prominently at low frequency due to the larger beam size, whereas the Puppis A, Centaurus A, and Centaurus B sources in the EoR2 sidelobes may be better placed with respect to large spectral gradients in the primary beam.

        <p>In EoR0, the Galactic Plane is in the spectrally flat horizon region, and the bright source 3C 444 (80 Jy) is away from regions of large index.

        <p>For both of these fields, one can see that small changes in the location of the spectrally steep beam nulls (as occurs when changing frequency bands) could lead to complex sources incurring large instrumental indices. Given that these bright sources near the field edges are rarely well-subtracted in the current sky models (if a good model even exists), there is potential for leakage into the EoR Window. Dead dipoles (i.e. those where the dipole is present but not delivering signal) within a tile will tend to smooth out these nulls, leading to additional complexity in the sampled signal. The impact of this for these fields is left for future work.For both of these fields, one can see that small changes in the location of the spectrally steep beam nulls (as occurs when changing frequency bands) could lead to complex sources incurring large instrumental indices.

        <p>To study this, we plot the overlaid images for the EoR0 Low band and EoR2 High band (zenith) in Fig. 29. In EoR0, 3C 444 (50 Jy) resides in an area of large spectral index. As one of the brightest sources in the field, this may be having an impact if not adequately modelled. In EoR2, large areas of the Galactic Plane overlay regions of large spectral index. Without more in-depth modelling, which we leave to the next stage of this work, it is difficult to ascertain the direct impact of this complicated field.To study this, we plot the overlaid images for the EoR0 Low band and EoR2 High band (zenith) in Fig. 29.

        <p>This work has presented the most broad and complete census of data from the MWA EoR project over four observing seasons, and multiple fields and redshifts. Despite the same metrics being applied to all data sets, there are clear differences in the structure and power levels of the different fields and observing frequencies. These differences point to sky calibration and source subtraction models as primary drivers, underpinned by the different spatial and spectral structure present in each field. Although EoR1 has only Fornax A as the apparent complex source, the model used for it in this work is sub-optimal. It is difficult to say definitively whether Fornax A residuals are dominating the errors, or whether other components of the sky model are inaccurate.This work has presented the most broad and complete census of data from the MWA EoR project over four observing seasons, and multiple fields and redshifts.

        <p>Conversely, EoR0 and EoR2 show promising results. EoR0 appears clean of bright, extended sources, and has had the most concentrated effort on sky modelling. It produces the best results at low redshift. EoR2 has received the least attention, and contains bright and structured sources in spectrally steep regions of the instrument response. It shows the best results at high redshift, providing good motivation to improve its sky modelling to further improve results. These lessons can feed into planning for observing fields with the SKA.Conversely, EoR0 and EoR2 show promising results.

        <p>The upper limits presented in this work are competitive in the research field at a number of redshifts, particularly when considering the wavemodes (k modes) where the 21cm signal is expected to be strongest.

        <p>This work comes after the publication of MWA EoR upper limits from 2013 Phase I EoR0 high-band data (Beardsley et al. 2016;Barry et al. 2019b) and 2016 Phase II EoR0 high-band data (Li et al. 2019). Those works focused on improved calibration and data analysis strategies to produce more sensitive results at low redshift. Their z = 6.5-6.8 results are comparable to those here, although their limits are at a different wavenumber; k = 0.20, k = 0.59 h Mpc -1 compared with k = 0.14 h Mpc -1 . It is interesting that their analysis using FHD and ppsilon yields systematic errors at different wavenumbers than the RTS plus CHIPS pipeline. With 110 h of data, this work produced upper limits only a factor of 1.5 lower than Li et al. (2019) produced with 40 h, showing that systematics are clearly still a dominant factor in our results. The previous work did not have the benefit of the cuts made in this work, but this work also did not fully utilize the calibration and data quality improvements (e.g. SSINS) used in their work. We have confidence therefore that combining these efforts will lead to some further improvement, albeit modest. A larger step to reducing limits can be achieved by updating the MWA signal backend, removing the two-stage filterbank that produces the coarse band structure and forces us to remove spectral channels.This work comes after the publication of MWA EoR upper limits from 2013 Phase I EoR0 high-band data (Beardsley et al. 2016;Barry et al. 2019b) and 2016 Phase II EoR0 high-band data (Li et al. 2019).

        <p>This latter point has some support from the results of using different amounts of data for the EoR0 high band (Fig. 11), and the lack of correlation found between 1D power spectrum limits and ionospheric activity metric (plot not shown). Although previous work has demonstrated that moderate-strong ionospheric activity can leave residual power in the power spectrum (Jordan et al. 2017;Trott et al. 2017), the data in this work are selected to be ionospherically quiet, and sorting based on that metric as the primary dimension may not be the optimal approach.This latter point has some support from the results of using different amounts of data for the EoR0 high band (Fig. 11), and the lack of correlation found between 1D power spectrum limits and ionospheric activity metric (plot not shown).

        <p>Addressing residual spectral structure from non-smooth bandpass solutions, and mis-modelled bright structures with large instrumental spectral indices, will put us on the path to extend this several hundred hour analysis to a thousand hour analysis.Addressing residual spectral structure from non-smooth bandpass solutions, and mis-modelled bright structures with large instrumental spectral indices, will put us on the path to extend this several hundred hour analysis to a thousand hour analysis.</p>
        <p>Looking towards SKA, most of these lessons are still relevant. Ionospheric and RFI conditions will be identical for MWA and SKA due to the common site, and SKA's high sensitivity will demand more stringent quality assurance for these effects. The SKA stations will have randomized antenna locations, smoothing the beams nulls and high instrumental spectral index caused by the MWA's regular aperture array grid. However, each station will have its own custom beam structure, and induced spectral index will play a role for bright sources. Even with the SKA, which has smaller fields of view than the MWA, the increased sensitivity will mean that there are few (if any) pointings that do not capture some extended or Galactic emission in the sidelobes. Modelling of these will be crucial for SKA's demanding science goals in the EoR and Cosmic Dawn.Looking towards SKA, most of these lessons are still relevant.
