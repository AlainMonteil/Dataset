        <p>Context. The eROSITA X-ray telescope on board the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma ( SRG) observatory combines a large field of view and a large collecting area in the energy range between ∼0.2 and ∼8.0 keV. This gives the telescope the capability to perform uniform scanning observations of large sky areas. Aims. SRG/eROSITA performed scanning observations of the ∼140 square degree eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey field (the eFEDS field) as part of its performance verification phase ahead of the planned four years of all-sky scanning operations. The observing time of eFEDS was chosen to slightly exceed the depth expected in an equatorial field after the completion of the all-sky survey. While verifying the capability of eROSITA to perform large-area uniform surveys and serving as a test and training dataset to establish calibration and data analysis procedures, the eFEDS survey also constitutes the largest contiguous soft X-ray survey at this depth to date, supporting a range of early eROSITA survey science investigations. Here we i) present a catalogue of detected X-ray sources in the eFEDS field providing information about source positions and extent, as well as fluxes in multiple energy bands, and ii) document the suite of tools and procedures developed for eROSITA data processing and analysis, which were validated and optimised by the eFEDS work. Methods. The data were fed through a standard data processing pipeline, which applies X-ray event calibration and provides a set of standard calibrated data products. A multi-stage source detection procedure, building in part on experience from XMM-Newton, was optimised and calibrated by performing realistic simulations of the eROSITA eFEDS observations. Source fluxes were computed in multiple standard energy bands by forced point source fitting and aperture photometry. We cross-matched the eROSITA eFEDS source catalogue with previous XMM-ATLAS observations, which confirmed the excellent agreement of the eROSITA and XMM-ATLAS source fluxes. Astrometric corrections were performed by cross-matching the eROSITA source positions with an optical reference catalogue of quasars. Results. We present a primary catalogue of 27910 X-ray sources (542 of which are significantly spatially extended) detected in the 0.2-2.3 keV energy range with detection likelihoods ≥ 6, corresponding to a (point source) flux limit of 6.5 × 10 -15 erg/cm 2 /s in the 0.5-2.0 keV energy band (80% completeness). A supplementary catalogue contains 4774 low-significance source candidates with detection likelihoods between 5 and 6. In addition, a hard-band sample of 246 sources detected in the energy range 2.3-5.0 keV above a detection likelihood of 10 is provided. In an appendix, we finally describe the dedicated data analysis software package, the eROSITA calibration database, and the standard calibrated data products.Context.

        <p>The scientific motivation for the eROSITA design was the desire to detect and spatially resolve a large number (about 105 ) of clusters of galaxies over a wide redshift range (up to at least z ∼ 1) in order to constrain cosmological parameters (see e.g. Allen et al. 2011;Pillepich et al. 2018) at the level of a Stage-IV Dark Energy experiment (Albrecht et al. 2006) by characterising the growth of structure.The scientific motivation for the eROSITA design was the desire to detect and spatially resolve a large number (about 105 ) of clusters of galaxies over a wide redshift range (up to at least z ∼ 1) in order to constrain cosmological parameters (see e.g. Allen et al. 2011;Pillepich et al. 2018) at the level of a Stage-IV Dark Energy experiment (Albrecht et al. 2006) by characterising the growth of structure.</p>
        <p>Following the successful launch in July 2019, and before the start of the all-sky survey, a number of performance verification (PV) observations were carried out during the early phases of the SRG mission, aimed at verifying all different aspects of the instrument capabilities. These early post-commissioning phases of science operations have clearly demonstrated that eROSITA is capable of delivering the design performance in terms of sensitivity, image quality, and spectroscopic capabilities (see e.g. Merloni et al. 2020;Predehl et al. 2021). Nevertheless, the ambitious scientific goals of eROSITA, and in particular its cosmological objectives, require accurate control over a number of elements, including the modelling of the instrumental and astrophysical backgrounds, the reconstruction of the selection function for both point-like and extended X-ray sources over very large sky areas, the identification of reliable counterparts of the X-ray sources at longer wavelengths, the measurement of their distances (redshifts), the calibration of the empirical (or physical) relations between X-ray observables (e.g. cluster luminosities, temperatures, and density profiles) and cosmologically meaningful parameters, particularly cluster masses.Following the successful launch in July 2019, and before the start of the all-sky survey, a number of performance verification (PV) observations were carried out during the early phases of the SRG mission, aimed at verifying all different aspects of the instrument capabilities.

        <p>The eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS) was the largest investment of observing time during the PV phase (about 360 ks, or 100 h, in total), and was designed to test the key elements of the science workflow from X-ray photon detection to astrophysics and cosmology. The eFEDS field, an area of approximately 140 deg2 composed of four individual rectangular raster-scan fields of ∼35 deg 2 each, was chosen because its multi-wavelength coverage for an extragalactic field of this size is one of the richest, and because it was visible for eROSITA in the limited time period allocated to PV observations. The field coincides with an area enriched by deep optical and near-infrared (NIR) imaging of the HSC 2 Wide area Survey (Aihara et al. 2018), KIDS-VIKING3 (Kuijken et al. 2019), DESI Legacy Imaging Survey4 (Dey et al. 2019), and, among others, GAMA 5 (Driver et al. 2009), WiggleZ (Drinkwater et al. 2018), LAMOST 6 , and the SDSS7 (Blanton et al. 2017) spectroscopic coverage. A full description of the available multiwavelength data, together with the identification of the multiwavelength counterparts, is presented in Salvato et al. (2022). The field also contains a medium-wide XMM-Newton survey field (the XMM-ATLAS; Ranalli et al. 2015), which provides a useful dataset for a comparison and validation of the eROSITA X-ray analysis pipeline.The eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS) was the largest investment of observing time during the PV phase (about 360 ks, or 100 h, in total), and was designed to test the key elements of the science workflow from X-ray photon detection to astrophysics and cosmology.

        <p>The eFEDS observational strategy was designed so as to provide uniform exposure over the field about 50% deeper than what is expected for eRASS at the ecliptic equator (i.e. over most of the sky) at the end of the 4-yr all-sky survey program, while at the same time covering a sufficiently wide area to provide large statistical samples of different source classes. In particular, enough clusters were to be provided for calibrating the massobservable relation using the weak-lensing maps provided by the exquisite optical imaging of the HSC survey.The eFEDS observational strategy was designed so as to provide uniform exposure over the field about 50% deeper than what is expected for eRASS at the ecliptic equator (i.e. over most of the sky) at the end of the 4-yr all-sky survey program, while at the same time covering a sufficiently wide area to provide large statistical samples of different source classes.

        <p>The SRG mission supports three principal observing modes (Predehl et al. 2021;Sunyaev et al. 2021). As its main objective, SRG is in the process of performing a 4-yr survey of the full sky in continuous scanning mode, in which the spacecraft pointing direction traces great circles in the sky with a rotation speed of 90 degrees per hour (or ∼90 s -1 ). In addition, SRG is capable of making pointed observations of individual targets, as well as extended rectangular fields in so-called field-scanning mode. The pattern of the field-scanning mode consists of parallel Right ascension Declination Fig. 1. 0.2-2.3 keV exposure map (vignetting corrected, in units of seconds; upper panel) and background map (in units of counts per pixel; lower panel). The bright circles mark high-exposure regions and are a result of the scanning mode used in the observations. They are created due to the waiting time of the spacecraft before inverting its scanning direction. The darker stripe in the second rectangular chunk on the right is due to the malfunction of two of the seven eROSITA cameras during that period. The upper panel also shows the footprints of a few relevant optical and NIR, imaging and spectroscopic surveys.The SRG mission supports three principal observing modes (Predehl et al. 2021;Sunyaev et al. 2021).

        <p>scans in alternating directions, offset by 6 . Given the eROSITA field of view (≈1 degree in diameter), each sky position is thus observed in ten consecutive scans. The maximum supported size of the scanned rectangles is 12.5 • × 12.5 • . In the interest of operational simplicity, the orientation of the rectangles is aligned with the ecliptic coordinate system. For mission planning purposes, individual field-scan observations are scheduled to be not significantly longer than one day, thus fitting between consecutive ground contacts with the SRG spacecraft. These constraints necessitate splitting the observations of the eFEDS field into four sub-fields of size 4.2 • × 7.0 • (this is the area with the nominal exposure depth; the area is larger by ∼0.5 • on each side, but the exposure is reduced). A scanning speed of 13. 15s -1 results in a uniform exposure depth of ∼2.2 ks (∼1.2 ks after correcting for telescope vignetting) across most of the field. Each source is observed continuously for up to 4.7 min in an individual scan when passing through the central part of the field of view and for shorter time periods in peripheral scans. The eFEDS observations were carried out at the beginning of November 2019 with all seven eROSITA Telescope Modules (TM1-7) in operation. However, due to an unrecognised malfunction of the camera electronics, 28% of the TM6 data of eFEDS sub-field I and 48 and 43% of the TM5 and TM6 data, respectively, of eFEDS sub-field II could not be used. This resulted in a reduced exposure depth in the affected areas of up to ∼30% (as visible in Fig. 1).scans in alternating directions, offset by 6 .

        <p>We report an unrecognized calibration error of 1 s in the arrival time correction for approximately half of the TM6 data of eFEDS sub-field I prior to the malfunction. Because of the scanning pattern of the eROSITA field-scan observing mode, this causes photons observed by this camera to be projected onto the sky with an offset of ∼13 on either side of the true position, resulting in an elongation of the merged all-camera point spread function (PSF) in the scanning direction in the affected area on the eastern side of sub-field I. Some technical details about the cause and correction method of these 1 s time shifts are provided in Appendix B.3.We report an unrecognized calibration error of 1 s in the arrival time correction for approximately half of the TM6 data of eFEDS sub-field I prior to the malfunction.

        <p>TM7), the suppression of optical light is achieved by a 100 nm Al layer on an external filter in the filter wheel. After launch it was found that a small amount of scattered sunlight can reach the CCDs from the side, bypassing the filter wheel ('light leak'; see Predehl et al. 2021). This causes a spatially inhomogeneous raised background at low energies in TM5 and TM7 that changes with the orientation of the spacecraft with respect to the Sun. This light-leak noise, which is smoothly distributed at scales &gt;10 , will be included in the background map and thus has a minor impact on the source detection. The optical photons may also cause an energy shift that is negligible for the source detection, however. Therefore, all seven cameras are used in this work.TM7), the suppression of optical light is achieved by a 100 nm Al layer on an external filter in the filter wheel.

        <p>We carried out an initial round of astrometric corrections of the X-ray dataset as follows. We created images and detected sources in the 0.2-2.3 keV band separately for each of the four eFEDS ObsIDs (using the methods described below). For each ObsID, we searched for the closest optical and IR AGN in the Gaia-unWISE AGN catalogue (Shu et al. 2019) for each detected point source (EXT = 0) within a maximum separation of 30 using an iterative 3σ clipping algorithm. We found 1600-1900 matches per ObsID and calculated the right ascension (RA; α) and declination (DEC; δ) offsets ∆α, ∆δ for each ObsID. This removes the mean linear offsets of the X-ray sources from the Gaia DR2 positions. We applied the computed corrections (see Table 1) to the observation attitude and then recalculated the event coordinates using the tasks evatt and radec2xy (see Appendix A.2).We carried out an initial round of astrometric corrections of the X-ray dataset as follows.

In the merged events, we searched for background flares by running flaregti (see Appendix A.5) in the 0.2-5 keV band12 . Only one short (&lt;1 ks) significant flare was detected by flaregti in the entire dataset (algorithm described in Appendix A.5).

        <p>Using evtool, we extracted the events in specific energy ranges and created images with a resolution of 4. 0 per pixel. This is a factor 2.4 higher than the size of the physical pixels of the eROSITA cameras (9. 6). We created vignetted exposure maps in each band and an unvignetted exposure map using 
            <rs type="software">expmap</rs>. A source detection mask was created with ermask on the basis of the 0.2-2.3 keV band vignetted exposure map by applying a minimum cut at 1% of the maximum value. By adopting such a low exposure threshold, we included the field border in the analysis. The depth is significantly shallower than the main field in the border. These shallow border regions can be excluded when necessary (Sect. 4.2).
        </p>
        <p>We created the main eFEDS catalogue by running a single-band source detection in the 0.2-2.3 keV band using all TMs. This band guarantees the highest sensitivity given the shape of the eROSITA response (Predehl et al. 2021). This was shown by simulation tests (Liu et al. 2022c). In addition, we also ran the same source detection procedure simultaneously in three bands (0.2-0.6, 0.6-2.3, and 2.3-5 keV), in order to select sources with particularly hard (or soft) spectra. As the eSASS tasks are able to handle either one set of files (e.g. event file, image, or background map) in a particular energy band or multiple sets of files in a few bands, the source detection procedure is identical for the single-band detection and the three-band detection. The source detection procedure is illustrated in Fig. 3 and is described below. We present the adopted values of the key parameters of the eSASS tasks we used here.

        <p>Our core source detection algorithm selects source candidates according to the statistics of fitting source images with a A1, page 5 of 25 A&amp;A 661, A1 (2022) PSF-convolved model (beta model or δ function), which is called PSF-fitting hereafter. Before the PSF-fitting, a preliminary catalogue that contains all the potential source candidates must be prepared. To prepare thispreliminary catalogue, a background map must be available. We therefore first ran 
            <rs type="software">erbox</rs> 13 in local mode (without background map) and adopted a detection likelihood threshold of 6 and a box size of 9 pixels (boxsize = 4) to create an initial catalogue. This initial catalogue, in which the quality is not controlled, was only used to create a background map using erbackmap (adopting a likelihood threshold of 6 and a required signal-to-noise ratio of 40), which masks out the sources in the catalogue and then adaptively smooths the image to create the background map. After preparing the background map prepared, we ran 
            <rs type="software">erbox</rs> in map mode, adopting a detection likelihood of 4 and a box size of 9 pixels, to create an updated catalogue. Considering that this updated catalogue is affected by the settings that were adopted when the initial catalogue was adopted through the background map, we repeated the step of creating a background map and running 
            <rs type="software">erbox</rs> with the same parameters and updated the catalogue again, creating the preliminary catalogue. This preliminary catalogue is determined by the parameter settings used in the background map creation and the map-mode erbox detection. Using the preliminary catalogue, we created a final background map using the same parameters as above. The bottom panel of Fig. 1 shows the resulting background map in the 0.2-2.3 keV band.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, the preliminary catalogue was used as input to the PSF-fitting in the next step, which selects reliable sources from this catalogue. We ran photon-mode PSF-fitting using 
            <rs type="software">ermldet</rs> and adopted a PSF-fitting radius (cutrad) of 15 pixels, a multiple-source searching radius (multrad) of 20 pixels, a detection likelihood threshold (likemin) of 5, an extent likelihood threshold (extlikemin) of 6, an extent range between 2 and 15 pixels, a maximum of four sources for simultaneous fitting, and allowed a source to be split into two sources at most. We finally used catprep to format the final catalogue. The preliminary catalogue (containing 84 565 sources in the singleband detection and 58 227 sources in the three-band detection) is much larger than the PSF-fitting output catalogue. As mentioned before, the PSF-fitting itself was performed within a circular region with a radius that was fixed by cutrad, which is an essential parameter of 
            <rs type="software">ermldet</rs>. Through simulation tests, we determined that cutrad = 15 is a good choice. Adjusting it does not improve the detection efficiency of point sources significantly.
        </p>
        <p>By comparing the best-fit source model with a zero-flux (pure background) model, 
            <rs type="software">ermldet</rs> calculates a detection likelihood (DET_LIKE) L for each source, defined as L = -ln P, where P is the probability of the source being caused by random background fluctuation. By comparing the extended beta model with a δ function, 
            <rs type="software">ermldet</rs> also calculates an extent likelihood EXT_LIKE for each source, which is defined corresponding to the probability of a source being unresolved rather than extended. Sources with an extent likelihood above and below extlikemin (6) were fitted with the beta model and δ function, respectively. These sources have catalogue values EXT = 0.0 and EXT_LIKE = 0.0. A low threshold of extlikemin = 6 was chosen in order to achieve a high completeness of the extended source sample, allowing some point sources to be misclassified as extended (Liu et al. 2022c). To increase the completeness of the point source catalogue or the purity of the extended source catalogue, a higher cut on EXT_LIKE, such as 8 or 12, can be 13 For erbox, we always adopted two-step image rebinning (nruns = 2). applied when needed. By minimising the C-statistic, 
            <rs type="software">ermldet</rs> measures the source position, extent, and count rate, together with the 68% confidence intervals. The task determines error margins by varying each fit parameter from the best-fit position in both directions to find the points at which the likelihood function ∆C = C -C best reaches the value 1.0. The error values from both directions are averaged and a single error value is written to the output file. For this reason, the error values and the combined errors for faint sources with large uncertainties have to be treated with caution. In the case of multi-band detection, the total-band count rates ML_RATE_0, counts ML_CTS_0, and fluxes ML_FLUX_0 have the errors of the single-band rates, counts, and fluxes added in quadrature, treating them as Gaussian errors. The algorithm of 
            <rs type="software">ermldet</rs> is described in more detail in Appendix A.5.

        <p>For the single-band detection, the 0.2-2.3 keV event file, image, and vignetted exposure map were used. For the threeband detection, the background maps were created using the same masking catalogue, but separately in the three bands; and the event files, images, exposure maps, and background maps of the three bands are input simultaneously into erbox and ermldet for source detection. The vignetted exposure map was used except for the 2.3-5 keV band, where the unvignetted exposure map was used instead because the background in the hard band is dominated by high-energy particles (Predehl et al. 2021).For the single-band detection, the 0.2-2.3 keV event file, image, and vignetted exposure map were used.

We made a second-pass astrometric correction of the catalogue in right ascension and declination, allowing a linear shear term rather than considering only linear shift (as was done in Sect. 3.2). Simulations show that the direct measurements of the positional uncertainty are slightly underestimated (Liu et al. 2022c). We therefore also computed an empirical correction of the raw positional uncertainty estimates ∆θ, that brings the distribution of the observed X-ray to reference catalogue offsets closer to the expected Rayleigh distribution.

        <p>When a low detection likelihood threshold of 5 is adopted, the single-band detection results in a large sample of 32 684 sources, which includes a relatively high fraction of spurious sources (see Sect. 4.1 for details). Despite the high spurious fraction, we adopted this low threshold because many faint but potentially interesting sources can be detected, possible cases of blended faint sources can be verified by multiple PSF-fitting, and faint sources can be effectively masked out when the properties of nearby sources are measured. As discussed in Liu et al. (2020), our strategy is to adopt a low threshold in the source detection and to apply further likelihood filtering on the output as needed. In this paper, we selected the 27 910 single-band detected sources with a detection likelihood ≥6 as constituting the eFEDS Main catalogue. The 4774 sources with detection likelihood &lt; 6 are kept in a supplementary catalogue, which we also publish here. The selection criteria for the sub-catalogues are listed in Table 2. 14 We used ermldet-1.47 here because a bug that affects the forced PSF-fitting in the c001 version of

        <p>As shown by simulation, the three-band detection is not as efficient as the single-band detection for the main population of X-ray sources, which have soft spectral shapes. In this work, the only aim of the three-band detection is to select hard sources (particularly AGN) that are detected above 2.3 keV. We used three bands rather than only the 2.3-5 keV hard band because most of the hard-band observed sources have much stronger signals in the soft band. Including the soft signals improves the measurement accuracy of source position and extent. The source detection likelihood is meanwhile independently calculated in each of the three bands, allowing us to focus only on the hard band. From the three-band detected sources, we selected a sample of 246 sources with an extent likelihood of 0 and a 2.3-5 keV band detection likelihood 10 as the Hard eFEDS catalogue. The three-band detected sources are not published except for this small Hard sample. We adopted a high 2.3-5 keV DET_LIKE threshold of 10 in order to guarantee a high purity of the sample. Above this threshold lie eight significantly extended sources with EXT_LIKE &gt; 47, and all the other 246 sources have EXT_LIKE = 0. Only 20 of these 246 sources are not included in the single-band detected main catalogue. The number is small because eROSITA has a small effective area and a high particle background above 2.3 keV. However, we remark that this sample is valuable for AGN demography studies. Although most of them are already in the main catalogue, these sources are detected independently and thus have independent position and fluxe measurements.

            <rs type="software">ersensmap</rs>, we calculated the sensitivity for point sources in the 0.2-2.3 keV band. As a reference, we compare in Fig. 8 the sky coverage of the main sample (detection likelihood 6) and of the full single-band detected sample (detection likelihood 5), converted into the 0.5-2 keV band, with that of a few contiguous Chandra and XMM-Newton surveys, including the XMM-XXL North survey (Liu et al. 2016), the Chandra COS-MOS Legacy survey (Civano et al. 2016), the XMM-RM survey (Liu et al. 2020), and the CDWFS survey (Masini et al. 2020).

        <p>In this catalogue, we detect 542 candidate extended sources with a detection likelihood ≥5 and extent likelihood ≥6 (see Table 2). This number corresponds to a density of about four extended sources per square degree over the full eFEDS field. The extent and detection likelihoods of this sample are shown in Fig. 9. The emission from the detected extended sources was fit using a beta model with a slope fixed to 2/3 and r core as the extent parameter after convolution with the PSF. The fluxes and count rates were then calculated from the normalisation of this fit model and hence correspond to the total integral over the beta model. During this process, a constant temperature of the intra-cluster medium and a constant value of the Galactic absorption (see above) were assumed. Our source detection algorithm automatically deconvolves the source flux when a nearby point source lies within a radius marked 'multrad'. If the multrad parameter is smaller than the physical radius within which the flux of the extended source is measured, emission from the point source might contaminate the signal from the extended source. Furthermore, a diligent analysis of the instrumental background and X-ray foreground has to be performed when the extended source flux is calculated because the source detection algorithm might overestimate the background if the source is very extended. Therefore, the fluxes and count rates given in the main eFEDS catalogue must be treated with extreme care. We provide the corrected count rate, flux, and luminosity measurements of the full extent-selected sample at two fixed radial distances (300 and 500 kpc) in Liu et al. (2022a) and at physical overdensity radius of R 500 in Bahar et al. (2022). The extended sources in the sample are characterised in Ghirardini et al.

        <p>Figure 10 displays the detected fraction of input point sources (AGN and stars) in a differential (top panel) and cumulative (bottom panel) manner. At a threshold of DET_LIKE &gt; 5 and DET_LIKE &gt; 6, 94 and 93%, respectively, of the simulated point sources are detected down to a 0.5-2 keV flux limit of 10 -14 erg cm -2 s -1 . Down to a flux limit of 4 × 10 -15 erg cm -2 s -1 , the completeness reduces to 63% for DET_LIKE &gt; 5 and 59% for DET_LIKE &gt; 6. To guarantee a 80% completeness, the flux limit is 6 × 10 -15 erg s -1 cm -2 for DET_LIKE &gt; 5 and 6.5 × 10 -15 erg s -1 cm -2 for DET_LIKE &gt; 6. Using ersensmap, we calculated the flux limit corresponding to the detection likelihood threshold (DET_LIKE = 5) and thus the sky coverage area curve as a function of this flux limit. When this curve is normalised to a total area of 1 (solid black line in Fig. 10), this function also predicts the detectable fraction. However, this fraction only reflects the ersensmap definition of the detectable flux limit. As displayed in Fig. 10, a source above the detectable flux limit might still be missed because of the fluctuation and measurement uncertainty in the source and background or because of blending with nearby sources. A source below the limit still has a significant probability of being detected because of fluctuation.Figure 10 displays the detected fraction of input point sources (AGN and stars) in a differential (top panel) and cumulative (bottom panel) manner.

        <p>Figure 11 displays the distribution of all the single-band detected sources from the simulations as a function of their detection likelihood. The detected sources are divided into five classes: the primary counterpart of an input point source (class 1, purple in Fig. 11), the primary counterpart of an input cluster (class 2, red), the secondary counterpart of an input point source (class 3, green), or an input cluster (class 4, orange), and spurious sources due to background fluctuations (class 5, blue). When one input source results in multiple detected sources, the source with the largest number of photons is considered as the primary counterpart (class 1 or 2), and the secondary sources (class 3 or 4) correspond to the signal in the outer wing of an input point sources or to substructures or fluctuations in an input cluster. More details are discussed in Liu et al. (2022c).Figure 11 displays the distribution of all the single-band detected sources from the simulations as a function of their detection likelihood.

        <p>According to the definition, the detection likelihood DET_LIKE corresponds to a probability of exp(-DET_LIKE) of one source being spurious. This probability is too low to be plotted in the bottom panel of Fig. 11; the actual spurious fraction (blue line) is significantly higher. This is because the likelihood is defined in an ideal situation, considering only Poissonian fluctuations. In reality, additional uncertainties such as background measurement or source deblending affect the source detection A1, page 10 of 25 process in every step. The only way to measure the spurious fraction of a catalogue reliably therefore is through detailed simulation, as we have done here.According to the definition, the detection likelihood DET_LIKE corresponds to a probability of exp(-DET_LIKE) of one source being spurious.

        <p>The middle panel of Fig. 11 shows that above a detection likelihood of 5, the sample includes 11.5% spurious sources. When a likelihood threshold of 6 or 8 is adopted, the spurious fraction reduces to 6.3 or 1.8%, respectively. The availability of a classification for all detected sources means that the simulation provides the fraction of any type of input in any specifically selected sample. In the suite of accompanying papers, we have made extensive use of this valuable information in order to estimate, for example, the fraction of spurious sources in the hard-band selected eFEDS point source catalogue (Nandra et al., in prep.) and the fraction of true/spurious clusters in the extended source catalogue (Liu et al. 2022a;Klein et al. 2022), and so on (see more detailed discussions in Liu et al. 2022c).The middle panel of Fig. 11 shows that above a detection likelihood of 5, the sample includes 11.5% spurious sources.

        <p>This section presents the X-ray point-source number count distribution of the eFEDS survey, which requires a knowledge of the selection function, that is, the probability of a source with a given flux to be detected. It has been demonstrated that the selection function can be estimated on the basis of aperture photometry (Georgakakis et al. 2008;Lehmer et al. 2012). Therefore, we ran aperture photometry using the apetool task (see Appendix A.5). apetool uses the aperture source and background counts to calculate a Poisson false rate for each source, that is, the probability that the source is generated by background fluctuations. This can be expressed in terms of logarithmic likelihood L asln(probability). This likelihood can be used for the sample selection. It can also be converted into a sensitivity map containing the minimum required number of photons to reach a given likelihood. This map can then be used to correct for the incompleteness of the eFEDS point-source catalogue as a function of X-ray flux. During the forced PSF-fitting photometry for each band, we also created a background map and a source map (source extent model convolved with PSF) in addition to calculating the fluxes. Making use of them, we ran apetool within a radius of 60% encircled energy fraction (EEF), adopting an aperture likelihood threshold of 12. The aperture size and likelihood threshold were selected according to simulation tests (Liu et al. 2022c). In this analysis, we excluded the border of the field, where the exposure is much lower than the typical depth of eFEDS. We adopted the inner region, in which the 0.2-2.3 keV vignetted exposure value is above 500 s. This region comprises 90% of the total area.This section presents the X-ray point-source number count distribution of the eFEDS survey, which requires a knowledge of the selection function, that is, the probability of a source with a given flux to be detected.

        <p>Based on the aperture photometry results, we converted the 0.5-2 keV count rate into flux corrected for Galactic absorption using an ECF of 1.104 × 10 12 cm 2 erg -1 , and converted the 2.3-5 keV count rate into 2-10 keV flux corrected for Galactic absorption using an ECF of 5.518 × 10 10 cm 2 erg -1 , assuming the same spectrum model as used in Sect. 3.4, that is, a power law with a photon index of 2.0. We selected point sources with an aperture Poissonian likelihood &gt;12, which resulted in 13 457 sources in the 0.5-2 keV band and 151 sources in the 2.3-5 keV band. Based on these two sub-samples and using the method described in Georgakakis et al. (2008), we calculated the number counts in the 0.5-2 and 2-10 keV bands and compared them with those measured in Chandra surveys (Georgakakis et al. 2008) and in the XMM-COSMOS survey (Cappelluti et al. 2009) simulation. The flux distribution of the output AGN catalogue is different from that of the input AGN catalogue mainly because of (i) sample incompleteness (Fig. 10), (ii) sample contamination (Fig. 11), (iii) flux overestimation caused by source blending, and (iv) Eddington bias. The ratio of the input and output flux distributions of the simulation can be used to convert the flux distribution of the real catalogue into the intrinsic number counts. The soft-band number counts derived in this way from the real point sources with DET_LIKE &gt; 8 are displayed in Fig. 12. This is slightly lower than the number counts measured using the method based on aperture photometry because the simulation-based method has corrected for the effects of sample contamination and source blending, which can only be quantified through simulations. These two effects are negligible in deep survey with high spatial resolution such as the CDWFS.Based on the aperture photometry results, we converted the 0.5-2 keV count rate into flux corrected for Galactic absorption using an ECF of 1.104 × 10 12 cm 2 erg -1 , and converted the 2.3-5 keV count rate into 2-10 keV flux corrected for Galactic absorption using an ECF of 5.518 × 10 10 cm 2 erg -1 , assuming the same spectrum model as used in Sect. 3.4, that is, a power law with a photon index of 2.0.

        <p>The apetool-generated catalogues were also used to assess the photometric calibration of the eFEDS field by comparing the fluxes of the detected sources to external catalogues. The choice of aperture photometry for this application enables the statistically robust estimation of the random (shot-noise) and systematic uncertainties (e.g. Eddington bias) affecting source fluxes (e.g. Laird et al. 2009). This means that observational effects can be fully accounted for when fluxes from different experiments are compared to test cross-calibration issues. We also chose to use fluxes in the 0.5-2 keV energy interval because in this standard band, many X-ray catalogues in the literature report fluxes.The apetool-generated catalogues were also used to assess the photometric calibration of the eFEDS field by comparing the fluxes of the detected sources to external catalogues.

        <p>The external dataset adopted in this work is the XMM-ATLAS survey (Ranalli et al. 2015). This is one of the wide-area (6 deg 2 ) and shallow (F 0.5-2 keV ≈ 2 × 10 -14 erg s -1 cm -2 ) surveys carried out by XMM-Newton and it also overlaps with the eFEDS field. A custom reduction of the XMM-ATLAS survey field was used based on the methods described by Georgakakis &amp; Nandra (2011). The advantage of using a custom analysis rather than the publicly available XMM-ATLAS catalogue is control over systematics (e.g. Eddington bias and conversion factor of counts to flux). The identification numbers of the relevant XMM-Newton observations are 0725290101, 0725300101, and 0725310101. They were reduced using the

They were compared against a total of 985 eFEDS sources that lie within the XMM-ATLAS footprint and have a detection likelihood in the 0.6-2.3 keV band of DET_LIKE &gt; 10. This threshold was chosen to minimise spurious detections while keeping number statistics high. The calculation of fluxes for the eFEDS and XMM-ATLAS fields was based on aperture photometry and used the Bayesian method described by Laird et al. (2009) and Georgakakis &amp; Nandra (2011). A description of the basic flux-estimation algorithm is also provided in Boller et al. (2022). The fluxes in both samples are estimated in the 0.5-2 keV spectral band assuming a power-law spectral model with Γ = 1.4 that is absorbed by a Galactic column density of log N H /cm -2 = 20.3. We emphasise that this is different from the spectral model adopted for the calculation of fluxes in the main eFEDS catalogue. The reason for this is that the XMM-ATLAS reduction adopts Γ = 1.4 for the determination of fluxes.The 987 sources detected in the 0.5-2 keV band to the threshold above are relevant here.

        <p>The eFEDS and XMM-ATLAS samples have 616 sources in common. They were identified by matching the two catalogues within a radius of 15 . For the sky density of the XMM-Newton and ATLAS sources, this threshold corresponds to 1 spurious associations. Figure 13 compares the 0.5-2 keV fluxes of the common sources in the two surveys. It plots the histogram of the flux difference between the eFEDS and XMM-ATLAS normalised to the flux errors (68% confidence interval) added in quadrature. This distribution is compared with a Gaussian with unity variance and zero mean. There is no evidence for strong systematic offsets in Fig. 13, suggesting an overall good photometric agreement between the XMM-ATLAS and eFEDS data analysis. There are more sources with large normalised flux differences than expected for the normal distribution, however. We attribute this excess power at the wings of the histogram in Fig. 13 to the intrinsic flux variability of AGN. This effect is discussed further in Boller et al.

        <p>pattern. The charge cloud released by the absorption of an Xray photon may extend over several pixels. The task pattern tries to identify these pixels, so that the total released charge can be reconstructed.

The task energy tries to reconstruct the energy of each detected photon from the charge distributions found in individual pixels and as a byproduct, also constrains its sub-pixel position. It makes use of the results of the pattern task, which must thus be executed beforehand. The reconstruction of the energy of an incident photon is essentially performed in three steps: First, a charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) correction: the charge loss caused by shifting the charge from its original location to the readout node must be corrected for. Second, a gain correction: the eROSITA CCDs are characterised by parallel readout, where each transfer channel is equipped with an amplifier of its own, and the amplification factors need to be individually determined. Third, a recombination of the reconstructed energies from all the pixels of a pattern. In addition to these essential steps for X-ray spectroscopy, it is also possible to obtain an improved location of the centre of the charge cloud from the individual components, so that the location where the X-ray photon had hit the CCD can be determined with sub-pixel resolution (Dennerl et al. 2012).

            <rs type="software">srctool</rs>. The 
            <rs type="software">srctool</rs> task is responsible for the generation of standard source products, including spectra, response matrices, background spectra, and light curves. It takes as input the calibrated event file, source lists, region files, and the calibration data. The task is designed to create products that take the scanning of the telescope across the sky into account. The mechanism it uses to do this is to take a set of sample points as a function of position and as a function of energy, given a source model and extraction region. The source regions and background regions are both sampled in this way. These samples are propagated through time to take the vignetting and bad pixels as a source scans across the detectors into account, which is included in the computation of the source-specific effective area curves and in the area calculation for light curves. The GTI and exposure for a source are computed from when the sample points for a source enter and exit the field of view. Similarly, the area on the sky of the source, when used for background subtraction, and the geometric area of the extraction region are computed as the average values computed from the sample points during the GTIs. The accuracy to which the output effective areas and exposure times is calculated depends on the parameters giving the spacing of the sample points on the sky and in time. 
            <rs type="software">srctool</rs> takes the source morphology into account by a model chosen by the user (e.g. a point source, top hat, beta model, or a provided image). If PSF losses are taken into account, the source model is convolved by the PSF to compute how much flux is lost outside the extraction region for each time step. The task supports a number of geometric regions for source extraction, including circles, ellipses, and boxes, in addition to a generic mask image option, all of which can be combined or subtracted. 
            <rs type="software">srctool</rs> also has the ability to compute extraction regions automatically given a source list. In this mode, the aim is to increase the source and background extraction circular regions until the signal-to-noise ratio is maximised, while taking into account excluding neighbouring sources.

            <rs type="software">expmap</rs> task generates FITS-format exposure maps to match the location and dimensions of a supplied template image in register. The exposure is expressed in units of the time (seconds) that each sky location was in the field of view. It can optionally be folded with the telescope vignetting function in each energy band. The algorithm samples periods of GTI in the input event list and projects the CCD onto the sky at each sample time according to the record of spacecraft attitude contained in CORRATT extensions. Other inputs to the maps are bad pixels as listed in the 
            <rs type="software">BADPIX</rs> extensions, dead time as recorded in the DEADCOR extensions, the detector mask, and the vignetting function. While the vignetting function is energy dependent, we followed the approach of XMM-Newton exposure maps (XMM-SAS17 ) to not weight the vignetting with an assumed spectral model. This results in systematic errors of the vignetted exposure and derived count rates and fluxes in the energy bands of interest in the few-percent range. Future versions of the 
            <rs type="software">expmap</rs> task will provide an option to fold the vignetting function with a suitable spectral model. Exposure maps for individual telescope modules and also weighted all-eROSITA 'merged' maps are available as outputs.

Pixels in image areas that can be used for source detection are set to 1, all other pixels are set to 0. The area selection is based on two configurable thresholds setting either a lower limit on the exposure as a fraction of the maximum map value or an upper limit for the spatial gradient of the exposure map. In the current pipeline versions only the fractional exposure threshold is set.

In a first step, the task calculates a mask to blank out circular regions around the sources from the input list. The radii of these circles depend on the source count rate, the PSF, and on source extent parameters from the input list. A second step smooths the remaining images and interpolates the map into the masked out regions around the input sources. For this step either a two dimensional smoothing spline or an adaptive smoothing algorithm (recommended) can be selected. The adaptive smoothing algorithm convolves the input images with Gaussian smoothing kernels of different scales and chooses the smoothed map for each pixel that reaches the user-defined signal-to-noise ratio.

        <p>Appendix A.5: Source detection and photometry flaregti. The task flaregti creates a set of GTIs that optimise the ability of sources to be detected or created from a fixed count rate threshold. The first step is to remove bright point sources using a simple detection algorithm that identifies bright pixels in a binned image, which are later excluded from the light-curve production. A light curve of the count rate per unit area is then computed from the data in a given energy band, given the input GTIs. A regular grid of points is chosen over the area of the sky that is contained within the event file. For each grid point, light curves are constructed by selecting a subset of time bins from the total point-source masked light curve for those periods when the grid point in question is within the field of view. Each of these lightcurves is analysed to either choose an optimal threshold for that spatial location in standard operation, or to apply a fixed threshold. When an optimal threshold is calculated, the task chooses a threshold that minimizes the flux at which a source of a specified size can be detected against the average sky surface brightness. When it has a set of thresholds for each grid point, the task then identifies for each time bin within the light curve the grid point that is closest to the centre of the field of view. For each time bin, the threshold of this nearest grid point and the measured rate is used to decide whether a time bin is good or bad, and the tool then constructs the GTIs. These flarebased GTIs are merged with the original input GTIs to make new combined GTIs for each TM. The task then repeats the whole processes back to the source detection stage based on these new GTIs for a given number of iterations. flaregti writes the output FLAREGTI GTI data back into the original event file as extensions or to a separate GTI file, and optionally writes light curve, point-source mask, and spatial threshold files.Appendix A.5: Source detection and photometry flaregti.

The peaks are then tested for statistical significance by comparing the number of box counts n i with the expected background counts b i in each input image i using the (logarithmic) likelihood

An extent likelihood quantifying the probability that an extended model is required to fit the count distribution of a source is calculated in a similar fashion. In this case, the value C null for the null hypothesis is calculated for the best-fitting point source model. Again, the relation between the extent likelihood L ext and the incidence of false classifications as extended sources needs to be calibrated by simulations.</p>
        <p>If the extended model fit results in an extent likelihood below the user-defined threshold, the fit is repeated with a PSF model and the fit parameters of the point source model are written to the source list. After each source fit, the best-fitting model is added to the internal background map used for the model fits of subsequent (fainter) sources. The final source model + background maps can be written as FITS images.If the extended model fit results in an extent likelihood below the user-defined threshold, the fit is repeated with a PSF model and the fit parameters of the point source model are written to the source list.

        <p>Assuming ∆C follows a χ 2 distribution, we can calculate the parameter errors corresponding to 68% confidence intervals by varying the parameter of interest from its best value in both directions until C = C best + 1.0 is reached. These boundaries are determined by an iterative procedure, and the errors for both directions are averaged and written to the output table. When for one direction the algorithm fails to converge after the given number of iterations, the errors determined for the other direction are adopted. When no error margin can be determined in either direction, a zero is written to the output table. The positional errors are given in units of image pixels for both X and Y positions and for an error radius in units of arcseconds:Assuming ∆C follows a χ 2 distribution, we can calculate the parameter errors corresponding to 68% confidence intervals by varying the parameter of interest from its best value in both directions until C = C best + 1.0 is reached.

        <p>The PSF of eROSITA is modelled using the shapelet basis functions (Refregier 2003;Refregier &amp; Bacon 2003). The shapelet coefficients that describe the distribution of photons at a certain energy and at a given position in the eROSITA field of A1, page 18 of 25 view are stored in a calibration file. To construct the PSF map, the apetool first extracts the GTI from the attitude file. For each time interval, the shapelet coefficients at the positions of a given pixel are retrieved from the calibration file. The average of each shapelet coefficient across all time intervals is used to reconstruct a model of the PSF at the position of interest. This is then used to measure the size of the PSF in pixels at encircled energy fractions (EEF) between 40-95% in steps of 5%. The apetool estimates the PSF size in a regular grid of positions in the eROSITA field of view. The density of the grid is a trade-off between speed, size of the final PSF map, and an adequate description of the variations in PSF size across the field of view. The default setup is a grid of 21 × 21 positions along the X and Y direction.The PSF of eROSITA is modelled using the shapelet basis functions (Refregier 2003;Refregier &amp; Bacon 2003).

        <p>In the case of aperture photometry, there are two options. Counts are either extracted at source positions defined in a source catalogue generated by the ermldet task or at arbitrary userdefined positions. The difference between the two options is the format of the input and output source lists. In the first case, the ermldet source catalogue is supplemented with aperture photometry products. These include i) the total counts at a given position (source and background) extracted within an aperture of size defined in units of EEF, ii) the background counts extracted from the source maps generated by the ermldet, iii) the mean exposure time, iv) the EEF used to define the extraction radius, v) the size of the extraction radius in pixels, and vi) the Poisson probability that the extracted counts (source + background) are a fluctuation of the background. These quantities can be combined to estimate the source flux. The case of aperture photometry at arbitrary source positions corresponds to science applications related to, for instance, X-ray stacking analysis or searches for faint X-ray emission (i.e. below the formal X-ray detection threshold) associated with counterparts selected at other wavelengths or external (non-eROSITA) X-ray catalogues. The apertures within which counts are extracted at user-defined positions are expressed in terms of EEF. The quantities as listed above are estimated and stored in an output file.In the case of aperture photometry, there are two options.

        <p>The sensitivity map generated by apetool has units of counts. They represent the minimum number of photons (source and background) within the extraction aperture (expressed in EEF units) at a given position on the detector, so that the Poisson false-detection probability is lower than a user-defined value. The Poisson false-detection probability is defined as the probability that the background fluctuats in a random fashion to produce counts within an aperture above a given value. This probability is given by the survival function of the Poisson probability distribution. The resulting sensitivity maps can be combined with the aperture photometry determined by apetool for the ermldet sources to provide an accurate representation of the point-source selection function (probability of detecting a source) at a given Poisson false-detection threshold (see Georgakakis et al. 2008). The combination of the apetool sensitivity maps with the aperture photometry of the ermldet-detected sources (also via apetool) enables, among others, the accurate estimation of the X-ray point-source number count distribution as a function of X-ray flux, that is, log Nlog S (see Section 4.2).The sensitivity map generated by apetool has units of counts.

        <p>The sensitivity map FITS file includes three image extensions: i) the sensitivity map itself, that is, the minimum number of counts as described above as a function of detector position, ii) the expected background within the extraction radius, and iii) the corresponding average exposure time (mean of the exposure map) within the extraction radius. With these three components, it is possible to estimate the detection probability of a source with a given count rate or flux. The resulting area or sensitivity curve is stored in the fourth (table) extension of the sensitivity map fits files.

        <p>In order to obtain the required large number of PSFs within a reasonable time, the measurements were taken at very high photon rates, taking extreme pile-up into account and making use of the fact that, if the dominant incident energy is known, the number of photons per pixel can be reconstructed from the total charged released there. In this mode, however, it is not possible to apply the usual technique to identify and suppress the traces of minimum ionising particles by selecting only valid pixel patterns, because photon pile-up may also create 'invalid' pixel patterns. This problem could be solved by developing specific criteria for spotting suspicious pixel patterns, by removing all the contaminated CCD frames, and by visually checking the remaining frames for each of the 4860 PSF exposures. It turned out that only ∼ 5% of the frames needed to be rejected. In this way, the exposure time per PSF could be reduced from several h to ∼ 80 seconds, boosting the efficiency by two orders of magnitude.In order to obtain the required large number of PSFs within a reasonable time, the measurements were taken at very high photon rates, taking extreme pile-up into account and making use of the fact that, if the dominant incident energy is known, the number of photons per pixel can be reconstructed from the total charged released there.

        <p>Another challenge was that the PSFs were available only at the native 9. 5 resolution provided by the TRoPIC pixel size (sub-pixel resolution could not be used here because of the high pile-up). In order to increase the spatial resolution, we tried to find plausible flux distributions that agreed with the measured ones after binning them into 9. 5 × 9. 5 pixels. This was done by developing a modified method of bicubic spline interpolation, which was made to be flux conservative (Fig. B.1). These images are the basis for modelling the PSF.

        <p>Point spread function: shapelet model. The eROSITA optics and large field of view translate into a complex PSF shape that depends on both off-axis angle and energy. The regular nearly Gaussian PSF on-axis is distorted with increasing offaxis angle, leading to elongated features and asymmetries (see Figure B.2) that are hard to model using analytic functions. This has motivated an approach whereby the PSF at a given position is linearly decomposed into an appropriately chosen two-dimensional set of localised basis functions. The PSF can then be represented by the coefficients of the basis function components. The decomposition uses the shapelet functions proposed by Refregier (2003); Refregier &amp; Bacon (2003), which represent a complete and orthonormal set in the two-dimensional space.

        <p>In the case of the eROSITA PSF, we used three independent sets of shapelet functions, ψ ν,µ (x, y; β), each of which corresponds to a different scale. They are intended to model the core, the main body, and the wings of the PSF. The scales of each of the three components were fixed to β = 1, 1.5, and 6 pixels of the ground-calibration images, which have a pixel scale of 9. 5. The number of shapelet orders is set by the requirement n + m ≤ N max , where N max = 0, 10, and 8 for each of the three scales β = 1, 1.5, and 6 pixels, respectively. The choice of N max = 0 for the smallest scale translates into a single Gaussian function to model the core of the PSF. There are 66 and 45 shapelet coefficients for N max = 10 (scale β = 1.5 pixels) and N max = 8 (scale β = 6 pixels).

For comparison, the shapelet-model reconstruction of the PSF is also presented in this figure. The fraction of photons predicted by the shapelet model within a fixed radius is typically within 10-20% of the PANTER measurement.

The columns include the midpoint of the time bin (TIME), the width of the bin (TIMEDEL; δ T ), the number of counts in each band (COUNTS; c), the number of counts in the background region in each energy band (BACK_COUNTS; c B ), the fraction of the nominal on-axis effective collecting area computed in each band (FRACAREA; f A ), the fraction of the time bin that overlaps with input GTIs and when the source was visible in the field of view (FRACTIME; f T ), the product of the fractional collecting area and fractional temporal coverage (FRACEXP; f E = f A f T ), the mean off-axis angle during the bin, and the ratio by which the background counts need to be scaled to give the background contribution in the source aperture (BACKRATIO, r). The RATE column is calculated from the other columns in each band as (cr c B )/( f E δ T ). The 1σ uncertainty on the rate is given for each energy band in RATE_ERR, providing there are more than 25 counts in the respective counts column, using √ c + r c B /( f E δ T ). The RMFs were derived from measurements that had been performed with a prototype version of the eROSITA CCDs at the synchrotron radiation facility BESSY II, where the energy range 0.08 -11.0 keV was sampled with monochromatic measurements at 29 energies (Ebermayer et al. 2010). The measurements were cleaned from artefacts (e.g. higher orders), filtered to contain only single-pixel events, and then used to derive an empirical mathematical function that reproduced the observed spectra. After this function was available, it was straightforward to evaluate it at any energy and to compose an empirical RMF. This method was also applied to the other three valid pattern types (doubles, triples, and quadruples) by using the same generic function and modifying only some parameters. This re-sulted in four initial RMFs, one for each pattern size (Dennerl et al. 2020). These are the RMFs that are currently used for all TMs. It is planned to adapt these generic RMFs to the properties of the individual TMs by using dedicated calibration observations of suitable astrophysical targets. In this way, it should also be possible to take temporal variations into account.Light curves.

The 1σ uncertainty on the rate is given for each energy band in RATE_ERR, providing there are more than 25 counts in the respective counts column, using √ c + r c B /( f E δ T ). The RMFs were derived from measurements that had been performed with a prototype version of the eROSITA CCDs at the synchrotron radiation facility BESSY II, where the energy range 0.08 -11.0 keV was sampled with monochromatic measurements at 29 energies (Ebermayer et al. 2010). The measurements were cleaned from artefacts (e.g. higher orders), filtered to contain only single-pixel events, and then used to derive an empirical mathematical function that reproduced the observed spectra. After this function was available, it was straightforward to evaluate it at any energy and to compose an empirical RMF. This method was also applied to the other three valid pattern types (doubles, triples, and quadruples) by using the same generic function and modifying only some parameters. This re-sulted in four initial RMFs, one for each pattern size (Dennerl et al. 2020). These are the RMFs that are currently used for all TMs. It is planned to adapt these generic RMFs to the properties of the individual TMs by using dedicated calibration observations of suitable astrophysical targets. In this way, it should also be possible to take temporal variations into account.</p>
        <p>Auxiliary response files. The auxiliary response files (ARFs) made by 
            <rs type="software">srctool</rs> are OGIP-compliant. These files include several different effects that are applied to the on-axis effective area, including vignetting, PSF correction, and corrections for times at which the source is only partially visible. The ARF files contain a SPECRESP extension that in turn contains the standard columns of ENERGY_LO, ENERGY_HI , and SPECRESP , which give the effective area curve. In addition, 
            <rs type="software">srctool</rs> writes columns for diagnostic purposes that give the corrections applied to the on-axis effective area due to PSF (as CORRPSF), vignetting (as CORRVIGN), and the two combined (CORRCOMB).

        <p>The current versions of the catalogues contain a small number of NULL values in the PSF-fitting error measurement columns, for example, ML_RATE_ERR, RADEC_ERR_ERR, and EXT_ERR, because in some cases the ermldet algorithm that determines the parameter errors failed to converge.

        <p>The eSASS calibration database (CALDB) contains all information required for calibrating the data collected with the eROSITA telescope modules (TMs). It is based on the HEASARC 18 CALDB framework for managing calibration files. Each of the seven telescope modules of 
            <rs type="software">eROSITA</rs> has its own set of calibration files. The names of the calibration files follow a naming convention that specifies the telescope module, calibration type, and, if necessary, the type of detector or filter for which this calibration file is intended, as well as the date from which this information is valid and the version number of the file. For example, tm2_badpix_190712v01.fits contains the information on the bad pixels of TM2 valid from 12 July 2019 (i.e. before launch) in the first version.

        <p>Vignetting. Vignetting is defined here as the flux of a point source contained in a circle of 4 radius relative to that flux at the on-axis position. The vignetting database contains parameters for computing this value for any given photon energy and off-axis angle. These parameters were derived from the same data as were taken to determine the point spread function (see below). Variations in the flux of the X-ray source were considered by performing simultaneous measurements with a monitor counter. This method did not only save measurement time, but also had the advantage that the vignetting centre (i.e. the point of minimum vignetting, which is not necessarily coincident with the point of minimum HEW and which may move with energy) could be determined from the narrow grids of PSF measurements, and that the assumption of azimuthally symmetric vignetting could be verified. Comparisons between the measured values and the modelled vignetting curves are shown in Fig. 7 of Dennerl et al. (2020).Vignetting.

        <p>Point spread function: images. In the ground calibration, images of the PSF were obtained at the MPE PANTER facility 19 individually for each mirror assembly (MA) at the energies of the C-K, Cu-L, Al-K, Ag-L, Ti-K, Fe-K, and Cu-K emission lines, covering the energy range from 0.3 to 8.0 keV. The MAs were placed 124 m away from an X-ray point source and mounted together with the X-ray camera TRoPIC on a rigid platform, which could be tilted horizontally and vertically. The TRoPIC X-ray CCD is identical in its pixel size to the eROSITA Appendix B.2: Pattern recombination and energy calibration While no calibration data are needed for the pattern recombination, this is very different for the energy calibration because each CCD column is characterised by an individual CTI and gain, and these values depend on the energy, the CCD temperature, and the time of the observation. The initial database, which did not yet consider the last two dependences, contains already 21616 parameters. In the updated currently used database, which considers the effects of the CCD temperature and the time of the observation, the number of parameters has increased to 29764. Another database, consisting of a total of 1799 sub-pixel maps, is used for a fast reconstruction of the sub-pixel position from the distribution of the charge over the pattern (Dennerl et al. 2012).Point spread function: images.

        <p>In order to inspect and optimise the source detection for 
            <rs type="software">eROSITA</rs>, we ran extensive simulations as described in Liu et al. (2022c). The simulation of eFEDS is briefly summarised here. We used sixte-2.6.2 22 to create mock eFEDS event files and implemented 18 realisations. To make them as representative as possible to the real data, we input the real 
            <rs type="software">eROSITA</rs> calibration files and eFEDS attitude file, and AGN, star, and cluster catalogues generated from cosmological simulations (Comparat et al. 2020). We measured the mean X-ray and particle background spectra from the eFEDS data and simulated the source signal, X-ray background, and particle background separately to account for their different vignetting. We ran the eFEDS source detection pipeline on the mock data and then associated the detected sources with the input on the basis of the source-ID flag on each photon. By checking the number of photons contributed by each input source in the core region of a detected source, we identified its primary and secondary (if existed) input counterparts. The point sources (AGN and stars) and extended sources (clusters) were considered separately. In this way, we were able to identify not only the cases where one input source was uniquely matched to one detected source that was correctly classified (as point-or extended source) or not, but also the cases where one input source was detected as multiple sources and the cases where one detected source was due to a blending of multiple input sources.

        <p>Based on the input-output association, we were able to measure the source detection efficiency, that is, the completeness (detected fraction) and contamination level (fraction of spurious sources). The final source detection strategy was chosen according to the impact on source detection efficiency caused by any adjustment of the source detection procedure and parameters.Based on the input-output association, we were able to measure the source detection efficiency, that is, the completeness (detected fraction) and contamination level (fraction of spurious sources).
