        <p>This review aims to summarize more than 100 years of research on spinel compounds, mainly focusing on the progress in understanding their magnetic, electronic, and polar properties during the last two decades. Over the years, more than 200 different spinels, with the general formula AB 2 X 4 , were identified or synthesized in polycrystalline or single-crystalline form. Many spinel compounds are magnetic insulators or semiconductors; however, a number of spinel-type metals exists including superconductors and some rare examples of d-derived heavy-fermion compounds. In the early days, they gained importance as ferrimagnetic or even ferromagnetic insulators with relatively high saturation magnetization and high ordering temperatures, with magnetite being the first magnetic mineral known to mankind. From a technological point of view, spineltype ferrites with the combination of high electrical resistance, large magnetization, and high magnetic ordering temperature made them promising candidates for many applications. However, spinels are also known as beautiful gemstones, with the famous ''Black Prince's Ruby'' in the front centre of the Imperial State Crown. In addition, spinels are important for the earth tectonics, and the detection of magnetite in a Martian meteorite even led to the speculation of life on Mars. However, most importantly in the perspective of this review, spinels played an outstanding role in the development of concepts of magnetism, in testing and verifying the fundamentals of magnetic exchange, in understanding orbital-ordering and charge-ordering phenomena including metal-toinsulator transitions, in developing the concepts of magnetic frustration, in establishing the importance of spin-lattice coupling, and in many other aspects. The still mysterious Verwey transition in magnetite was one of the very first illuminating examples of this complexity, which results from the fact that some ions can exist in different valence states in spinels, even at a given sublattice.

        <p>Spinels are a large group of compounds having the general formula AB 2 X 4 with the same crystal structure as the mineral MgAl 2 O 4 . The anions X often are O 2-, S 2-, Se 2-, or Te 2-. However, spinels with the anion being fluorine F -, nitrogen N 3-or cyanide (CN) 1-were also reported to form stable compounds. A-site cations can be the alkali ion Li + , the earth-alkaline ions Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ , and Ba 2+ , the heavier 3d transition-metal ions Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn, as well as Ge, Cd, and Hg. B-site cations favourably are Al, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni, as well as Ga, In, and Tl. In addition, spinels with B = Mo, Rh, or In were synthesized. In connection with the anions X = F -or (CN) -, the B sites can also be occupied by the alkali ions Li + , Na + , or K + . More than 200 spinel compounds, which were identified or synthesized over the years, are listed in Refs. [1,2]. Mineral species with a spinel-type structure and with their original names given by mineralogists or crystallographers are described in Ref. [3]. Like a great variety of oxides, spinel compounds also consist of a face-centred cubic (fcc) lattice of the X 2-anions, which is stabilized by interstitial cations. There are two types of interstices in such an anion lattice: Tetrahedral interstices with four nearest neighbours and octahedral interstices with six nearest neighbours. If all tetrahedral sites are empty and all octahedral sites are full, the crystal has rock-salt structure. If only tetrahedral sites are occupied, the crystal has zinc-blende structure. In the spinel structure, twice as many octahedral as tetrahedral sites are occupied and the spinel structure can be thought as an ordered mixture of zinc-blende and rock-salt unit cells. In spinel compounds there exist two general classes having this lattice, the 2-4 spinels with the formula 2B 2+ X 2-Spinels are a large group of compounds having the general formula AB 2 X 4 with the same crystal structure as the mineral MgAl 2 O 4 .

        <p>resulting in the general formulas AB 2 X 4 or B(AB)X 4 , where the ions within the parenthesis occupy octahedral sites only. The third possibility, the realization of 1-6 spinels is very rare. If there is only one type of cation at the octahedral sites, the spinel is called normal. If there are equal amounts of both kinds of cations at the octahedral sites, the spinel is inverse. Spinels with unequal numbers of each type of cation in the octahedral site are called mixed [4]. Another common way to describe the dense anion and cation packing of spinels assumes to subdivide the cubic unit cell into eight octants. The spinel structure then is a face centred compilation of two types of cubes, A 2 X 4 (A in four-fold coordination) and B 4 X 4 (B in six fold coordination) [5].resulting in the general formulas AB 2 X 4 or B(AB)X 4 , where the ions within the parenthesis occupy octahedral sites only.

        <p>In nature, some spinels are found as beautifully coloured and transparent gemstones, with a variety of colours due to different dopants. In early times, they were confused with rubies, the most prominent example being the Black Prince's Ruby in the front centre of the British Imperial State crown, which later was identified as spinel (Fig. 1). In 1779 they were named by Jean Demeste, derived from the Latin word ''spinella'', which means little thorn and refers to their sharp octahedral crystal shapes. The determination of the crystal structure of spinels by Bragg [6] and independently by Nishikawa [7] was one of the very early accomplishments of crystal-structure analysis. The spinel structure is cubic with a large unit cell containing 8 formula units, e.g., 8 A, 16 B and 32 X atoms. In most cases the anions X can be approximated by cubic close packing, while the cations fill certain interstices as described above. Later it was found that in addition to the normal variant of the spinel structure AB 2 X 4 and inverted structure of B(AB)X 4 can exist, which was termed inverse spinel [8].In nature, some spinels are found as beautifully coloured and transparent gemstones, with a variety of colours due to different dopants.

        <p>Due to their remarkable electrical and magnetic properties, spinels are of considerable technological interest, specifically due to the need of insulating or semiconducting ferromagnets. One should have in mind that permanent magnetism was first observed in lodestone, naturally magnetized pieces of the mineral magnetite, Fe 3 O 4 , which was also called the Magnesian stone, resulting in the nomenclature of the word magnetism. The development of models and theories of magnetism are closely related to magnetite, starting more than 2500 years ago. Early on it was recognized that lodestone can attract pieces of iron and the Greek philosopher Thales of Milet (625-545 B.C.) probably provided the first scientific discussion of lodestone. About 585 B.C. he stated, as witnessed by Aristotle [10] that loadstone attracts iron because it has a soul. Since then, this material fascinated countless scientists. In ancient China a variety of compass needles were invented, either using south-pointing chariots, two-wheeled vehicles that carried a movable pointer to indicate the south, no matter how the chariot turned, or south-pointing spoons (see Fig. 2). Each time the spoon manufactured from naturally occurring magnetite is spun on a non-magnetic plate, it comes to rest with its neck pointing south [9].Due to their remarkable electrical and magnetic properties, spinels are of considerable technological interest, specifically due to the need of insulating or semiconducting ferromagnets.

        <p>Even nowadays non-metallic ferromagnetic (FM) materials are rare and interestingly, many spinels are insulating ferrimagnets, in many cases with relatively high saturation magnetization and high magnetic-ordering temperatures. Hence, an early fundamental characterization of structural, electrical, and magnetic properties of various spinels, which will be discussed later in this review, has been performed in the Natuurkundig Laboratorium of the N. V. Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken in the Netherlands. Before World War II, Verwey and coworkers performed the most pertinent work on spinel compounds, later on, in the early fifties, this work was continued by Gorter, Lotgering, Romeijn, and coworkers to name a few.Even nowadays non-metallic ferromagnetic (FM) materials are rare and interestingly, many spinels are insulating ferrimagnets, in many cases with relatively high saturation magnetization and high magnetic-ordering temperatures.

        <p>Model of a magnetic compass used in ancient China. An iron spoon manufactured from naturally occurring magnetite is placed on a non-magnetic plate. When it comes to rest after turning, the handle points south and hence, the name ''Si Nan'' means South seeker. Source: Fig. reproduced from Ref. [9]. ions like Fe, Co, Cr, or Ni, can be found in information technology, in biotechnology, and in applications for spintronic devices. Ferrites, which mainly are ceramic and composite spinel compounds, already play an important technological role because of their interesting electrical, magnetic, and dielectric properties. The combinations of high electrical resistivity, low eddy currents, low dielectric losses, high saturation magnetization, and high permeabilities, together with high Curie temperatures, good chemical stability, and mechanical compactness make them extremely useful for applications such as rod antennas, electronic devices, sensors, memory devices, data storage, or tele-communication. The optical properties of transparent or semi-transparent spinels were utilized for photo-luminescence as well as for magneto-optical recording. Furthermore, the electrical characteristics of spinels have allowed their application in the field of energy-storage materials, such as super-capacitors. In addition, they also have been widely used as electrodes in Li-ion batteries, and last not least, their controllable composition, structure, valence, and morphology have made them suitable as catalysts in a variety of chemical reactions.

        <p>Quite generally, magnetic insulators are promising materials for spintronics, spin-caloritronics, nonvolatile memories, and microwave applications. Magnetic insulating heterostructures in form of single crystalline thin films, grown on suitable substrates, are important and even critical for realizing quality interfaces for these applications. However, magnetic and insulating single crystalline materials with a Curie temperature well above room temperature are rare. In these introductory remarks, we tried to document that spinel ferrites constitute a class of materials that were recognized having significant potential for these applications and FM as well as ferrimagnetic (FiM) insulating spinel oxides were synthesized as thin films or heterostructures and were carefully characterized. To document this broad and important field of applications, we include a chapter dealing with synthesis and possible applications of spinel-derived thin films Martian meteorite ALH84001 containing magnetite microcrystals. This meteorite was found in the Alan Hill ice field (Antarctica). It was speculated that these magnetite crystals were produced in ancient times by magneto-receptive Martian bacteria (see text).

        <p>Spinels are also of utmost importance for the earth tectonics: spinel compounds form the so-called transition region between the lower and the outer mantle of the earth structure, extending roughly from 450 to 600 km below the earth's surface, forming an important zone for seismic activities of the earth. In this regime of the earth's mantle, the spinel-olivine transition is important in driving the plate tectonics.Spinels are also of utmost importance for the earth tectonics: spinel compounds form the so-called transition region between the lower and the outer mantle of the earth structure, extending roughly from 450 to 600 km below the earth's surface, forming an important zone for seismic activities of the earth.

        <p>Finally, spinels in form of magnetite or greigite are believed to act as magnetic receptors in magneto-receptive species, including honeybees, birds, sea turtles, salmons, and a variety of phytoplankton and bacteria [12]. The identification of magnetite in the Martian meteorite ALH84001 (Fig. 3), which was collected in the Antarctica in Alan Hills ice field, even led to the conclusion of life on mars [13] by correlating the found magnetite micro crystals with the activity of magneto-receptive bacteria. Regarding this Mars meteorite discovery, the possibility of life on mars was even mentioned in a press-release statement by US president Clinton on August 7, 1996. It should be noticed that scientifically this claim later on was strongly challenged.Finally, spinels in form of magnetite or greigite are believed to act as magnetic receptors in magneto-receptive species, including honeybees, birds, sea turtles, salmons, and a variety of phytoplankton and bacteria [12].

        <p>During the past decades, magnetic nanoparticles have attracted continuous interest and were intensively explored and studied for both, basic research phenomena and potential applications in a variety of different fields ranging from data storage, energy storage, spintronics, and magneto-optical devices, to contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging. Quite generally, they also are of interest in biomedicine in areas like medical diagnostics, drug delivery, and magneto-hyperthermia, in environmental purification, and in catalysis, to name a few. In first respect, nano-structured materials exhibit unique magnetic features depending on nanoscale size modulation and grain-boundary engineering. When compared to the bulk, nanomaterials are strongly dependent on the microcrystalline grain size and on distribution, thickness, and chemical constitution of the grain boundaries. In addition to grain size and size dispersion, materials engineering regarding core-shell design, shape, morphology, crystallinity, and surface decoration opens up a variety of prospects for potential application and innovation. Over the years, spinel-type ferrite nanoparticles played an important role, specifically with respect to cobalt ferrites and magnetite. The physics and chemistry of magnetic nanoparticles constitute an entire new research field on its own and it is impossible to review their synthesis, structural and magnetic characterization, and possible applications in this review, which mainly focuses on the basic principles of magnetism of mostly single-crystalline spinel compounds. The interested reader is referred to reviews on the importance of magnetic nanoparticles in general [14][15][16] and specifically on work dealing with spinel-type nanoparticles and nanocomposites [17][18][19][20], which only provide a very first look into this recent universe of nanoscience.During the past decades, magnetic nanoparticles have attracted continuous interest and were intensively explored and studied for both, basic research phenomena and potential applications in a variety of different fields ranging from data storage, energy storage, spintronics, and magneto-optical devices, to contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging.

        <p>Here we mainly will focus on magnetic, electric, and multiferroic (MF) properties of spinel compounds, where in the context of this work, multiferroicity denotes the coexistence of magnetic and polar order. As will be documented in the course of this work, the complex and partly exotic magnetism of many spinel compounds results from magnetic frustration and competing interactions. As mentioned above, the pyrochlore network formed by the B sites can give rise to strong magnetic frustration in three dimensions (3D) [21]. In the bipartite diamond lattice of the A sites, depending on the magnetic exchange interactions within or in-between the two sublattices, again strong spin-frustration effects can occur [22]. The importance of frustration and competing interactions was recognized early on in studying the magnetic ground-state properties of spinels. In B-site spinels the magnetic moments occupy the corners of a pyrochlore lattice and are coupled by antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange. In the seminal work on antiferromagnetism in spinels, Anderson [23] noticed that in such a lattice nearest-neighbour forces alone can never lead to long-range order. However, it is possible to achieve essentially perfect short-range order while maintaining a finite entropy. Down to the lowest temperatures, there will be residual zero-point entropy and Anderson noticed the closeness of this problem to the ice-rules developed by Pauling for hydrogen bonds in water. In spinels, where both, A and B sites are occupied by magnetic moments exhibiting dominant AFM exchange between the A and B cations, Yafet and Kittel [24] predicted a resulting triangular spin structure, the famous Yafet-Kittel (YK) spin structure, which later indeed was identified in MnCr 2 S 4 [25]. In the more recent past, it has been recognized that as function of an external magnetic field, the spin structure of this compound exhibits unusual magnetic states, like an ultra-robust magnetization plateau or a spin supersolid phase [26]. In a number of spinel compounds a variety of complex spin configurations driven by magnetic frustration, e.g., composite spin degrees of freedom forming spin loops in ZnCr 2 O 4 [27] or the formation of a spin-spiral liquid state in MnSc 2 S 4 [22,28], were identified. As will be documented in Section 3.2, also the orbital degrees of freedom play an important role in the physics of spinel compounds, ranging from the cooperative Jahn-Teller effect to an orbital-ordering driven dimensional reduction in spinel systems like MgTi 2 O 4 or CuIr 2 S 4 . Such orbital effects are described in detail in a recent review by Khomskii and Streltsov [29].Here we mainly will focus on magnetic, electric, and multiferroic (MF) properties of spinel compounds, where in the context of this work, multiferroicity denotes the coexistence of magnetic and polar order.

In the more recent past, it has been recognized that as function of an external magnetic field, the spin structure of this compound exhibits unusual magnetic states, like an ultra-robust magnetization plateau or a spin supersolid phase [26]. In a number of spinel compounds a variety of complex spin configurations driven by magnetic frustration, e.g., composite spin degrees of freedom forming spin loops in ZnCr 2 O 4 [27] or the formation of a spin-spiral liquid state in MnSc 2 S 4 [22,28], were identified. As will be documented in Section 3.2, also the orbital degrees of freedom play an important role in the physics of spinel compounds, ranging from the cooperative Jahn-Teller effect to an orbital-ordering driven dimensional reduction in spinel systems like MgTi 2 O 4 or CuIr 2 S 4 . Such orbital effects are described in detail in a recent review by Khomskii and Streltsov [29].</p>
        <p>In the late fifties and early sixties, the magnetism of spinels was important for developing theories predicting the ground state properties of Néel type, YK like, or spiral spin structures. In addition, spinel compounds gained considerable importance in elucidating the complex physics driven by the interplay of spin, charge, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom in materials with partly filled d or f shells. This entanglement of the internal degrees of freedom supports an exceptionally rich variety of phase transitions and complex ground states, in many cases with emerging functionalities. It also makes these materials extremely susceptible to temperature, pressure, or external magnetic and electric fields an important prerequisite to achieve technological functionality. The first illuminating example of a strong entanglement of spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom was given by Verwey [30] by detecting a ''mysterious'' transition in magnetite close to 120 K, where the resistivity increases by two orders of magnitude. Despite enormous attempts in recent times, the microscopic nature of this metal-to-insulator transition (MIT), nowadays called Verwey transition, so far has not been completely unravelled. Other examples of the coupling of internal degrees of freedom in spinel compounds are, e.g., colossal magneto-resistance (CMR) effects in FeCr 2 S 4 [31], the occurrence of multiferroicity in CdCr 2 S 4 [32], CoCr 2 S 4 [33], FeCr 2 S 4 [34], and MnCr 2 S 4 [35], structural phase transitions induced via a spin-Jahn-Teller effect [36][37][38] in a number of chromite spinels, and the formation of iridium octamers and spin dimerization at the charge ordering MIT in CuIr 2 S 4 [39]. The complexity of the orbital physics in some of the spinel compounds is best documented by the observation of a spin-orbital-liquid (SOL) state in FeSc 2 S 4 [40] and the report on the observation of an orbital glass in FeCr 2 S 4 [41].In the late fifties and early sixties, the magnetism of spinels was important for developing theories predicting the ground state properties of Néel type, YK like, or spiral spin structures.

        <p>High-purity spinels can be synthesized in ceramic form and as single crystals by a variety of methods. Many of the preparation routes are given in the original literature cited in this review. A detailed summary of synthesis methods of spinel compounds is given in [2]. Here we only want to mention the extreme sensitivity of many physical properties on minor changes of impurities or defects introduced by the different synthesis routes. One illuminating example is FeSc 2 S 4 : There exist contrasting experimental results on spin and orbital order (OO) in this compound [40,55,56]. It was unambiguously shown that the magnetic order in some samples results from excess Fe forming a second phase corresponding to a vacancy-ordered iron sulphide with composition close to the 5C polytype of pyrrhotite (Fe 9 S 10 ) [55]. It is also now well established that the growth of thio-spinels by chemical transport reaction using chlorine as transport agent, by minor substitution of chlorine ions for sulphur, results in an enhanced defect-induced conductivity and in distinct differences of magnetocapacitive effects. This has been documented in full detail comparing single crystals grown by chemical transport using chlorine as well as bromine as transport agents and comparing the results to stoichiometric ceramic samples [57].High-purity spinels can be synthesized in ceramic form and as single crystals by a variety of methods.

        <p>However, there also exist a number of spinels with partial inversion and a lot of experimental and theoretical work has been performed to model the distribution of cations on A or B sites. The cation distribution is influenced by electrostatic energy and size effects as outlined by Sickafus et al. [59]: (i) anions and cations exhibit repulsion and attraction due to electrostatic energy. These Coulomb terms imply that the A site is occupied by either large ions with low charge or small ions with high charge, (ii) within one sublattice, there exists an energy for ordering phenomena between different ions. This energy term becomes important when two transition metals can occupy the same site and (iii) concerning the site-preference energy of certain ions: Some ions have a distinct preference for distinct coordination numbers, e.g., Fe 2+ for tetrahedral and Cr 3+ for octahedral coordination. The site preference of the spinel structure is given by the difference between the stabilization of this ion on B sites and that on A sites. Dunitz and Orgel [60] and independently McClure [61] have deduced site preferences in spinels from an electrostatic model, which can be summarized as follows: There is a distinct octahedral site preference of ions with d 3 configuration, there is no site preference of ions with d 0 , d 1 , d 2 , d 4 , and d 8 configuration. Ions with d 5 , d 6 , d 7 , d 9 , and d 10 configuration prefer tetrahedral sites. From these rules it is clear that a number of spinels can be synthesized in pure normal or pure inverse form, but always reveal partial inversion. A representative result is provided by ternary aluminium oxides AAl 2 O 4 where the A-site ions are Mn, Fe, or Co. Despite the fact that in these compounds, the transition metals prefer the A site and aluminium the B site, minor site inversion with a small percentage of the transition metals on the B site cannot be excluded [62], which might explain differences in published results and the spin-glass like ground states in the Fe and Co compounds.However, there also exist a number of spinels with partial inversion and a lot of experimental and theoretical work has been performed to model the distribution of cations on A or B sites.

        <p>The applicability of the hard-sphere ionic model for the spinel structure has been proven by Hill et al. [1]. These authors have shown that the lattice constants of binary and ternary oxide spinels are a simple and approximately equal function of the effective radii of the octahedral and tetrahedral cations, but are essentially independent of the electro-negativities of the respective ions. They also documented that for thiospinels the cell edge is primarily a function of the radius of the octahedral cation alone, with small additional contributions from the tetrahedral cation radius and from the octahedral cation electronegativity. As outlined above, the anions in the spinel structure are located on equipoint 32e, with their detailed position determined by one parameter x, called the fractional coordinate or the anion positional parameter. Hill et al. [1] also showed that there is a simple relationship between this positional parameter and the ratio of the octahedral and tetrahedral bond lengths. In case the bond lengths are equal, the positional parameter x = 0.2625.The applicability of the hard-sphere ionic model for the spinel structure has been proven by Hill et al. [1].

        <p>A detailed review on the physical and crystallographic properties of spinels has been given by Romeijn [42,43]. Spinel compounds can be synthesized in high quality and purity, in ceramic form, and in many cases as single crystals. An example is given in Fig. 5 showing the neutron-diffraction pattern of two polycrystalline thiospinels, namely MnSc 2 S 4 and FeSc 2 S 4 [40]. The room-temperature spectra were fitted using Rietveld refinement. Bragg peaks with resolution-limited width and the good agreement of experimentally observed and calculated intensities document high-quality and strainfree samples. The difference spectra, shown in the lower parts of each frame, document the absence of any impurity phases. From the detailed Rietveld refinement (solid lines in Fig. 5) the lattice constant and the fractional coordinate of the sulphur atom were determined as a = 10.621 Åand x = 0.2574 Åfor the Mn compound, and a = 10.519 Åand x = 0.2546 Åfor the Fe compound, respectively. The deviation of the sulphur parameter x from the ideal value 1/4 indicates a slight trigonal distortion of the octahedra around the B sites, while the tetrahedra remain undistorted. These results obtained in Sc spinels are typical values observed in spinel compounds and document the large unit cell with eight formula units per cell. In this work the [63] Bragg reflection of the iron compound was followed as function of temperature (inset of Fig. 5) and the absence of any broadening or splitting allowed to exclude any structural phase transition in the temperature range investigated.A detailed review on the physical and crystallographic properties of spinels has been given by Romeijn [42,43].

        <p>The magnetic and electronic properties of transition-metal compounds are strongly influenced by the crystal-electric field (CEF) splitting of the energy levels of the d electrons in a crystalline lattice. Since the ground-breaking work of Bethe [64] and van Vleck [65], there exists an enormous amount of literature covering this field, which certainly nowadays belongs to textbook knowledge. There are two limiting descriptions of the atomic outer electrons after the atoms have been brought together to form a crystal: Crystal-field theory rests on the assumption that the outer electrons are localized at discrete atomic positions, whereas band theory assumes that each electron belongs collectively to all the atoms of the periodic crystalline array [66]. The crystal-field model assumes that in a crystalline lattice a group of ligands, which can be represented by negative point charges, surrounds a transition-metal ion. This CEF will lift the degeneracy of the d electrons and the resulting CEF splitting strongly depends on the symmetry of the surrounding electric field. A prototypical example of the CEF splitting of d electrons, most representative for spinel compounds, is shown in Fig. 6, for a tetrahedral and an octahedral environment of the transition-metal ion. The angular parts of the lobes of the d orbitals are plotted in the right frame of Fig. 6. The energies of the electrons within the five d orbitals separate into two groups, namely into e g and t 2g orbitals. In octahedral symmetry, the e g orbitals directly point towards the neighbouring negative charges, while the t 2g orbitals point in between these charges. The Coulomb energies of these different ionic constellations yield a splitting of the involved energy levels. In tetrahedral symmetry where the orbital lobes do not point directly to or in between the neighbouring ions, these Coulomb-energy considerations result in a significantly smaller splitting of the d levels. In both symmetries, the splitting is always barycentric, following a centre-of-gravity-type rule. Depending on the valence of the transition-metal ion, the five d levels can now be occupied by up to 10 electrons, strictly following Pauli's exclusion principle. If the crystal-field splitting is moderate or small, the distribution of electrons within these levels strictly follow Hund's rules, i.e. each electronic level first is populated with one spin species before it is doubly occupied (high-spin case). If the CEF splitting is strong, the low levels are fully occupied, before the excited levels become occupied and a low-spin state is realized. The Jahn-Teller (JT) theorem [67] states, ''any non-linear molecular system in a degenerate electronic state will be unstable and will undergo a distortion to form a system of lower symmetry and lower energy thereby removing the degeneracy''. Notably, spinel compounds played an important role in realizing the importance of the JT effect in transition-metal oxides. A transition-metal ion and its immediate anion neighbours can be considered as the molecule in this case, and the occurrence of degeneracy in the ground state of the ''molecule'' may be predicted from the optical spectrum and the crystal-field theory [61,68]. The degeneracy of an electronic state makes a symmetric configuration of atoms unstable, causes a structural phase transition, thereby lowering one of the electronic energy levels and, hence, the total electronic energy of the atom embedded in a deformable crystal lattice. Via the structural phase transition and the lowering of one energy level, one specific type of orbital orientation is favoured, yielding long-range OO. Hence, the JT transition always is directly connected with orbital-ordering phenomena. Staying with the example of d electrons in octahedral or tetrahedral environment as given in Fig. 6, the corresponding ions with the electronic configurations d 4 (Cr 2+ , Mn 3+ ) and d 9 (Cu 2+ , Ag 2+ ) in an octahedral CEF or d 1 (Ti 3+ , V 4+ ) and d 6 (Fe 2+ , Ni 3+ ) in tetrahedral surroundings, usually are called ''Jahn-Teller ions'' and are prone to orbital-ordering effects. Of course, there are also many ions that are not JT active, e.g., for Mn 2+ (d 5 ) each orbital would be occupied by just one electron, preventing any energy gain by a lattice distortion. Compounds, which contain these ions having an orbital degeneracy, are found among magnetic insulators of essentially all material classes. Their properties are significantly different from those of the corresponding materials containing non-JT ions: Their crystal structure is distorted, they exhibit structural phase transitions and in most cases, the magnetic structure seems to be more complicated with an anomalously pronounced magnetic anisotropy and magnetostriction. Goodenough [69], Gehring and Gehring [70], and Kugel and Khomskii [71] provided detailed reviews on JT phenomena in solids. In electronically strongly correlated systems, OO may also be established by the Kugel-Khomskii mechanism [71] where the orbital degeneracy is removed via a purely electronic interaction. The beauty, structural, and electronic importance of orbital physics is described in detail in a recent review by Khomskii and Streltsov [29].The magnetic and electronic properties of transition-metal compounds are strongly influenced by the crystal-electric field (CEF) splitting of the energy levels of the d electrons in a crystalline lattice.

        <p>With respect to the spinel compounds reviewed in this work, Fe 2+ at the tetrahedral A site is of prime importance. As outlined above, the energy-gain of a structural transition driven by orbital-ordering phenomena is small and hence the transition energies are low. In FeCr 2 S 4 the JT transition appears at 10 K and can easily be identified via heat-capacity experiments or via ultrasound investigations [72]. In FeSc 2 S 4 , the JT energy is too low, OO is completely suppressed and this A-site spinel belongs to the rare examples of a SOL, where spin and orbital degrees of freedom are strongly entangled and do not show any type of long-range order down to the lowest temperatures [40].

        <p>A large number of compounds with localized magnetic moments does not show magnetic long-range order at low temperatures despite strong magnetic interactions. Long-range magnetic order can be suppressed by substitutional or structural disorder, by dimensionality or by frustration effects. Geometric frustration in spin systems can be found in a variety of crystallographic structures: Ising spins on a triangular lattice, spins on a Kagome or honeycomb lattice, or spins on a pyrochlore lattice. The ground state in frustrated spin systems either can be a spin liquid, a dynamically disordered quantum state, or as experimentally observed in the vast majority of cases, the ground state is non-generic and is driven by some non-leading marginal magnetic interactions.

        <p>While from a theoretical point of view very different and complex spin-liquid phases can evolve, from an experimental point of view the identification of strong frustration effects in magnetic systems is much easier. From an analysis of the PM susceptibility, the magnitude of frustration can easily be identified, as indicated in Fig. 7. In systems with localized magnetic moments, the high-temperature magnetic susceptibility follows a CW behaviour, defining a CW temperature Θ CW , which in antiferromagnets lies on the negative temperature axis. The AFM phase transition is expected to occur at the modulus of this temperature, at the AFM ordering temperature T N ∼ |Θ|. In frustrated magnets however, conventional magnetic order is suppressed and a spin-liquid ground state with zero ordering temperature or the onset of non-generic magnetic order at a temperature T f will be observed instead. From a plot of the inverse susceptibility vs. temperature, a frustration parameter can be defined via f = |Θ CW |/T N . Following the proposal of Ref.

        <p>Spin ordering in magnetic compounds including spinel ferrites, like magnetite Fe 3 O 4 , was described in Néel's work [76], which is based on the Weiss molecular-field approximation within the framework of the Heisenberg model: the ground state is that of the Heisenberg model with the spin operators replaced by classical spins of fixed lengths, equal to the respective quantum numbers. Néel assumed the dominant exchange interactions between nearest-neighbour A-B pairs of spins of the form H AB = J AB S A S B , with J AB &gt; 0. This assumption led to A-site spins being antiparallel to the B-site moments, which is called Néel configuration. Shortly after Néel's proposal of a two-sublattice model of uncompensated antiparallel spins for ferrimagnets [76], Anderson put forth a microscopic model utilizing an indirect exchange mechanism [83], while Kanamori [84] and independently Goodenough and coworkers [85][86][87][88] proposed a number of coupling rules between neighbouring and overlapping electron orbitals. Depending on geometrical constraints and electron orbitals involved, At high temperatures, the inverse susceptibility follows a CW law with a given negative CW temperature Θ CW (bold and dashed red line). In non-frustrated magnets, magnetic order is expected approximately at T N ∼ |Θ CW |. By frustration effects magnetic order is suppressed and PM susceptibility can be found deep below |Θ CW |. At low temperatures, the system realizes a spin-liquid phase or non-leading interactions drive a non-generic spin order below T f . these Kanamori-Goodenough rules provided a realistic estimate of FM or AFM exchange mechanisms important for establishing long-range ordered magnetic ground states.

        <p>The fact that spin configurations can be much more complex was proposed by Yafet and Kittel [24] assuming further nearest neighbour magnetic A-A and B-B interactions, which are AFM and not negligible. As the most significant result, these authors found a triangular spin structure of the magnetic moments located at two magnetic sublattices, which nowadays is known as the YK spin structure. To our knowledge, this was the first proposal of non-linear spin configurations in ordered magnets. Experimental evidence for the existence of this triangular YK structure has been provided by Lotgering [49] for some normal chromium-spinel compounds.

        <p>Subsequently, magnetic ordering of the normal spinel ferrimagnets CoCr 2 O 4 and MnCr 2 O 4 has been investigated by detailed neutron-scattering experiments in order to prove these LKDM predictions. In these spinel compounds the magnetic Co 2+ or Mn 2+ ions occupy the A sites, while the magnetic Cr 3+ ions occupy the B sites.

        <p>For MnCr 2 O 4 , Corliss and Hastings [101] found that the FiM spiral model proposed by LKDM does indeed give an approximately qualitative account of the intensities of the satellite lines. They also were able to show that neither a simple Néel model nor the YK model account for the major qualitative features of the diffraction pattern even at the lowest temperatures. Similar results with analogous conclusions were obtained by Menyuk et al. [102] for CoCr 2 O 4 . Their results indicated that the true configuration determined experimentally closely approximates the model predictions. However, they concluded that the range of exchange-interaction ratios obviously well extends beyond the onset of the theoretically predicted instability. 40 years later, Tomiyasu et al. [103] reinvestigated both chromite spinels by magnetization and neutron scattering experiments on single crystalline compounds. The use of single crystals and the enormous experimental achievements in neutron scattering techniques allowed performing the experiments with much better resolution. They analysed their results using a FiM spin-spiral structure similar to the one proposed by LKDM, but with the cone angles of the individual magnetic sublattices not restricted to the LKDM theory. The main and new result of their work is that the spin structure of both compounds is essentially the LKDM FiM spiral, but with long-range order (LRO) of all the spin components replaced by LRO of the longitudinal spin components and short-range order (SRO) of the transverse, or spiral, components.For MnCr 2 O 4 , Corliss and Hastings [101] found that the FiM spiral model proposed by LKDM does indeed give an approximately qualitative account of the intensities of the satellite lines.

        <p>Later on, Ederer and Komelj [104] presented first-principle LSDA+U calculations of the magnetic coupling constants in the spinel magnets CoCr 2 O 4 and MnCr 2 O 4 . One of the main conclusions of their work is that the coupling between the A-site cations, neglected in the classical LKDM theory, is of appreciable size in both compounds and definitely not negligible. As a summary of these investigations of chromium spinel oxides, Fig. 8 provides an overview of predictions of spin states as function of the u parameter of the LKDM theory including some spinel compounds, which are discussed in the course of this work.

        <p>While the investigation of oxide spinels started in the early fifties, detailed and systematic research on thiospinels, or more generally on spinels with the anions being a chalcogenide, namely X = S, Se, or Te, started ten years later, despite the fact that first magnetic measurements on thiospinels were carried out by Lotgering [49,50] much earlier.While the investigation of oxide spinels started in the early fifties, detailed and systematic research on thiospinels, or more generally on spinels with the anions being a chalcogenide, namely X = S, Se, or Te, started ten years later, despite the fact that first magnetic measurements on thiospinels were carried out by Lotgering [49,50] much earlier.</p>
        <p>However, intensive research started with the observation that the chalcogenide spinels CuCr 2 X 4 (X = S or Se) are metallic ferromagnets with Curie temperatures well above 300 K [105] and the subsequent discovery that a number of chromium spinels MCr 2 X 4 , with M = Cd or Hg, and X = S or Se, are semiconducting ferromagnets [106,107]. While it seemed that from a viewpoint of application oxide spinels are more important, thiospinels exhibit a much broader variety of ground states being highly interesting when viewed with the focus on basic research. The rich physics of the thiospinels will be detailed throughout this review. Interestingly, the electronic ground state of CuCr 2 S 4 , exhibiting metallic conductivity, is even today far from being completely understood. Lotgering [105] and Lotgering and van Stapele [108] assumed monovalent copper at the A site and mixed valent Cr 3+ and Cr 4+ at the B site. Alternatively, Goodenough proposed divalent copper at the A site and conventional trivalent chromium at the B site [109]. Goodenough's model gained support from detailed neutron-scattering experiments on CuCr 2 Se 4 from Robbins et al. [110]. These neutron diffraction experiments indicate a magnetic moment of 3 µ B on each B site and zero moment at the A site. The neutron results and the metallic conductivity are consistent with the ionic configuration Cu 2+ and Cr 3+ in which the copper orbitals are delocalized and form a partially filled band. A detailed review on the physics of sulphospinels was published by van Stapele [111]. It is almost impossible to review all the experimental and theoretical work published on the magnetism of oxide spinels and thiospinels during the last 70 years or so. We decided to exemplify the complexity of magnetic behaviour and of the magnetic ground states by documenting a survey of the work performed on some selected spinel compounds, which early on were in the focus of our own experimental work.However, intensive research started with the observation that the chalcogenide spinels CuCr 2 X 4 (X = S or Se) are metallic ferromagnets with Curie temperatures well above 300 K [105] and the subsequent discovery that a number of chromium spinels MCr 2 X 4 , with M = Cd or Hg, and X = S or Se, are semiconducting ferromagnets [106,107]. While it seemed that from a viewpoint of application oxide spinels are more important, thiospinels exhibit a much broader variety of ground states being highly interesting when viewed with the focus on basic research. The rich physics of the thiospinels will be detailed throughout this review. Interestingly, the electronic ground state of CuCr 2 S 4 , exhibiting metallic conductivity, is even today far from being completely understood. Lotgering [105] and Lotgering and van Stapele [108] assumed monovalent copper at the A site and mixed valent Cr 3+ and Cr 4+ at the B site. Alternatively, Goodenough proposed divalent copper at the A site and conventional trivalent chromium at the B site [109]. Goodenough's model gained support from detailed neutron-scattering experiments on CuCr 2 Se 4 from Robbins et al. [110]. These neutron diffraction experiments indicate a magnetic moment of 3 µ B on each B site and zero moment at the A site. The neutron results and the metallic conductivity are consistent with the ionic configuration Cu 2+ and Cr 3+ in which the copper orbitals are delocalized and form a partially filled band.

        <p>During the last twenty years, we tried to solve related questions concerning the spin ground state in MnCr 2 S 4 by a variety of experimental techniques including magnetic susceptibility, magnetization and heat capacity experiments as well as electron-spin resonance (ESR) measurements, all performed on single-crystalline material. The main conclusions including also results from other groups are detailed below. Here we mainly focus on the temperature dependent properties. The magnetic-field dependence including high-field experiments will be discussed in the chapter on MF compounds (3.4.2) as well as in the chapter on spinels in high magnetic fields (3.10.1). First reports on the magnetic properties of the cubic MnCr 2 S 4 were reported by Lotgering [49] using magnetization experiments and by Menyuk et al. [112] utilizing magnetization and neutron-diffraction experiments. MnCr 2 S 4 is a normal cubic spinel, with Mn 2+ and Cr 3+ occupying the A and B sites respectively. The FiM ordering temperature is of order ∼65 K and one observes a pronounced maximum in the temperature-dependent magnetization close to 40 K. The magnetization results and the absence of a (200)-reflection peak in neutron-diffraction experiments [112] were interpreted in the framework of a collinear Néel model. However, this was only possible assuming large and FM B-B interactions and a significantly reduced magnetic moment of the Mn 2+ ions. In subsequent magnetization experiments, Lotgering [25] documented a low-temperature transition at 5 K to a canted spin state, with spin canting of the manganese moments occupying the tetrahedral A sites, constituting the triangular YK spin structure. This magnetic transition into a canted YK phase was further corroborated by the observation of the appearance of a (200) reflection below the transition temperature in subsequent neutron-diffraction experiments [113]. Thirty years later, Tsurkan et al. [114] started a series of experiments in single crystalline MnCr 2 S 4 . Fig. 8 shows the temperature-dependent magnetization below 80 K for a series of external magnetic fields up to 2 kOe (0.2 T). These measurements were performed with the external field along the crystallographic &lt;001&gt; direction. The significant field dependence results from demagnetizing fields. For low external fields the sample is in a multidomain state, while for high fields (&gt; 1 kOe) a single-domain state is formed. For higher fields, the temperature dependent magnetization reveals the prominent maximum close to 40 K. A break of slope close to the transition temperature into the triangular YK state at T YK ∼ 5 K is clearly visible. The inset in Fig. 9 documents that the FiM transition temperature T c ∼ 65 K is rather constant as measured in different single crystals, but is slightly enhanced in polycrystalline material.During the last twenty years, we tried to solve related questions concerning the spin ground state in MnCr 2 S 4 by a variety of experimental techniques including magnetic susceptibility, magnetization and heat capacity experiments as well as electron-spin resonance (ESR) measurements, all performed on single-crystalline material.

        <p>The measurements in the single-domain phase indicate a striking non-monotonic temperature dependence of the magnetization with a maximum close to 40 K. For low temperatures, the extrapolated magnetization tentatively approaches a value of 1 µ B (dashed line in Fig. 9), which corresponds to the expected resulting magnetic moment, if the moments of the Cr and Mn ions are assumed to be in a strictly antiparallel collinear arrangement. However, below 5 K the magnetization levels off to a nearly constant value of about 1.23 µ B down to the lowest temperature at 1.8 K. This change of slope of the magnetization below 5 K is attributed to the transition into a non-collinear YK-like triangular spin structure. It is assumed that an additional AFM A-A magnetic exchange interaction induces a finite angle between the two manganese spins located at the two lattice sites on the diamond lattice.The measurements in the single-domain phase indicate a striking non-monotonic temperature dependence of the magnetization with a maximum close to 40 K.

        <p>At 100 kOe (10 T) the FiM ordering transition is smeared out and shifted to higher temperatures. The YK phase transition is shifted to 10 K and reveals a broad additional hump at lower temperatures. The field-dependent measurements on MnCr 2 S 4 including a detailed (H, T )-phase diagram will be discussed in Section 3.4 on multiferroics. The temperaturedependent magnetization as measured at low external fields of 20 Oe is shown in Fig. 10(b). The onset of spontaneous magnetization at the FiM ordering is followed by a non-linear temperature dependence of the magnetization. The decrease is interrupted at T YK and is interpreted as realization of the triangular YK spin structure, which is indicated in Fig. 10(b).At 100 kOe (10 T) the FiM ordering transition is smeared out and shifted to higher temperatures.

        <p>Here the manganese moments span a finite angle with a residual FiM moment with respect to the chromium spins. In Ref. [114] it was assumed, that just below the onset of FiM ordering at T c the manganese moments exhibit already a conical spin structure and are not strictly antiparallel to the chromium moments. However, in the temperature regime T C &gt; T &gt; T YK with a conical-like spin structure, the transverse spin components are still paramagnetically disordered [114]. At T YK the manganese spins lock-in into a fixed triangular structure with AFM transverse components of the manganese spins. The residual longitudinal component exhibits ideal FiM order with respect to the chromium moments. To our knowledge, MnCr 2 S 4 is the only compound where the triangular YK spin structure has been proven to be the magnetic ground state.Here the manganese moments span a finite angle with a residual FiM moment with respect to the chromium spins.

        <p>A number of spinel compounds also reveal spin spiral order at low temperatures, with HgCr 2 S 4 probably being the most prominent example. As outlined earlier, there were early reports on FM and insulating chromium spinels by Baltzer and coworkers [106,107], which gained considerable attention. All these FM chromium spinels, e.g., CdCr 2 S 4 , CdCr 2 Se 4 , HgCr 2 S 4 , and HgCr 2 Se 4 , are characterized by a sulphur or selenium anion at the X position of the spinel lattice. It was proposed that ferromagnetism is induced by an increasing importance of the indirect nearest neighbour (NN) 90 • FM B-X -B super-exchange compared to the direct AFM NN B-B exchange, which is dominating in the oxide spinels. These exchange paths are competing in the oxides and are responsible for low AFM ordering temperatures, but the 90 • FM B-X -B super-exchange paths gain increasing importance with increasing lattice constants in the sulphides and selenides [38,107]. In Section 3.3 on magnetic ground states governed by frustration, these competing exchange paths in the spinels will be discussed in more detail. Already Baltzer et al. [106] found that HgCr 2 S 4 , despite a FM CW temperature Θ ∼140 K, undergoes a magnetic transition at low magnetic fields close to 25 K. Soon after, utilizing neutron diffraction experiments the ground state of the mercury chromium sulphide was determined to be a spin spiral. The low-temperature spin structure was described by a helical spin order, with the propagation vector parallel to one of the cube edges and the spin-spiral plane perpendicular to the propagation vector [115]. Later on, this unconventional non-collinear spin state was investigated in detail by a variety of techniques in Ref. [116]. The magnetization of HgCr 2 S 4 as function of an external field at temperatures between 2 and 60 K is shown in Fig. 11. At low temperatures, a clear metamagnetic transition between 1 and 2 T is documented in Fig. 11(a), while at temperatures &gt; 20 K, the magnetization resembles that of a field-induced ferromagnet. At 2 K [Fig. 11(b)], the magnetization seems to be even more complex with a further critical field close to 5 T and saturation magnetization beyond 8 T. The low-field transition at the critical field H 1 is characterized by a strong hysteresis indicative for a first-order transition.A number of spinel compounds also reveal spin spiral order at low temperatures, with HgCr 2 S 4 probably being the most prominent example.

        <p>Since early 2000, orbital physics became a fascinating topic in modern solid-state physics and materials science. The spatial orientations of the electronic orbitals govern magnetic exchange and hence determine long-range spin order. If the orientational order of orbitals can be changed by external fields, e.g. strain, the magnetic order will change concomitantly.Since early 2000, orbital physics became a fascinating topic in modern solid-state physics and materials science.

        <p>On long terms, such a tuning of electronic orbitals, so called orbitronics, could be an important ingredient of a future correlated-electron technology [117]. In normal cubic spinels JT effects giving rise to OO can arise either from the A or from the B sites, or from both simultaneously.On long terms, such a tuning of electronic orbitals, so called orbitronics, could be an important ingredient of a future correlated-electron technology [117].

        <p>As outlined above, the cooperative JT effect in transition-metal compounds is a phase transition, which is driven by the interaction between localized orbital electronic states and the crystal lattice. It involves the simultaneous splitting of the degenerate electronic states with concomitant orientational ordering of the electronic orbitals and a symmetry-lowering distortion of the lattice. Already in the early fifties, structural distortions and the observation of symmetry-lowering phase transitions were interpreted in relation to the JT theorem. In 1952, Orgel [118] suggested that the Cu 2+ compounds have unsymmetrical environments because of the JT effect. Orgel and Dunitz [119] published a survey of the stereochemistry of copper compounds and subsequently discussed the occurrence of the JT effect in numerous materials with a special focus on spinel compounds [68]. Independently, using optical absorption spectroscopy McClure [61] showed that the apparent values of the crystal-field parameter D q for Mn 3+ , Cr 2+ and Cu 2+ located in an octahedral environment are much larger than for other ions having the same electronic charge. This fact was explained by taking into account a JT splitting of several thousand wave numbers in addition to the cubic crystal-field splitting. Already somewhat earlier, Goodenough and Loeb [85] noted that spinels containing a sufficient concentration of octahedral-site Mn 3+ or Cu 2+ ions at room temperature were tetragonal with lattice parameters c/a &gt; 1 rather than being cubic. Being unaware of the JT theorem, these authors used Pauling's time-honoured bonding concepts to show that the tetragonal distortions were due to orbital ordering that removes the orbital degeneracies of the Mn(III) and Cu(II) ions, respectively. Later on there followed detailed studies of orbital ordering transitions in a number of spinels with Cu 2+ , Fe 2+ , Ni 2+ , or Co 2+ at the tetrahedral A site [120,121]. The authors of Ref. [121] focused on the investigation of mixed chromium spinels to elucidate the experimental fact that if either Cu(II) or Fe(II) are at the A site, the tetragonal distortion is c/a &lt; 1. For Ni(II) the distortion c/a &gt; 1, while for Co(II) the spinel does not distort at all. JT-active mixed chromium spinels were also investigated in detail by Kataoka and Kanamori [122]. A molecular-field treatment of the cooperative JT effect, with a specific focus on spinel compounds, was given by Englman and Halperin [123].As outlined above, the cooperative JT effect in transition-metal compounds is a phase transition, which is driven by the interaction between localized orbital electronic states and the crystal lattice.

        <p>Since then, numerous experimental and theoretical works on the JT effect in a variety of spinel compounds have been performed and it certainly exceeds the frame of this work to provide a rigorous and complete review on the work published. We decided instead to elucidate the complexity of the JT physics and of orbital-ordering transitions by predominantly treating the normal spinel FeCr 2 S 4 . In this compound the Cr sublattice (Cr 3+ : 3d 3 , S = 3/2) at the B sites is dominated by FM exchange via the 90 • Cr-S-Cr bond angle. The low-lying t 2g triplet in octahedral symmetry is half filled and the orbital moment is quenched. The Fe ions (Fe 2+ : 3d 6 , S = 2) are located at the tetrahedrally coordinated A sites. In this case, the five-fold degenerate ground state is split by the crystal field into a lower orbital doublet and an excited triplet (see Fig. 6). The e ground doublet is split by SOC and additionally is weakly JT active. Goodenough [120] concluded, that in case the octahedral site cations do not contribute to the elastic anisotropy, then the elastic energy may be too small to induce a static JT distortion, but in case a distortion occurs, it should be to tetragonal symmetry (c/a &lt; 1).Since then, numerous experimental and theoretical works on the JT effect in a variety of spinel compounds have been performed and it certainly exceeds the frame of this work to provide a rigorous and complete review on the work published.

        <p>In FeCr 2 S 4 magnetic order, driven by the strong FM Cr-Cr exchange, occurs close to T c = 180 K [49]. Via an AFM coupling of the Fe sublattice to the Cr moments, FiM order with antiparallel chromium and iron moments is established at the magnetic phase transition. From neutron powder diffraction at 4.2 K it has been concluded that the compound remains cubic down to the lowest temperatures and that the spin arrangement is of simple Néel type [124]. The observed magnetic intensities have well been described assuming magnetic moments of µ Fe = -4.2 µ B and µ Cr = 2.9 µ B (here the minus sign indicates antiparallel alignment of the moments). The former was thought to be enhanced due to moderate SOC (Fe 2+ : g = 2.2, µ = 4.0 µ B ), the latter is close to the spin-only value of (Cr 3+ : g = 2, µ = 3.0 µ B ). These values seem to be slightly enhanced compared to subsequent neutron-diffraction work: At 10 K, Kim et al. [125] determined ordered moments of -3.52 (Fe) and 2.72 µ B (Cr). In recent high-resolution neutron-diffraction experiments, Bertinshaw et al. [34] measured the temperature dependence of the iron and chromium magnetic moments. At 4 K and in zero external magnetic fields, these authors determined moments of -3.69(6) and 2.64(3) µ B for iron and chromium, respectively. The reduced magnetic moments in zero-field were explained taking a transverse quasi-PM component of the magnetic moment of the Fe 2+ ions into account, an effect, which will be discussed later in more detail.In FeCr 2 S 4 magnetic order, driven by the strong FM Cr-Cr exchange, occurs close to T c = 180 K [49].

        <p>Early on there have been a number of Mössbauer studies in FeCr 2 S 4 reporting the observation of non-zero quadrupole shifts of the hyperfine pattern, usually indicating substantial deviations from cubic symmetry [126][127][128][129][130]. It has to be noted that the spatial symmetry of Fe 2+ at the tetrahedral site, according to neutron scattering [124] is cubic down to the lowest temperatures and that the observation of a nonzero quadrupole shift is not expected. From these early Mössbauer experiments there arose a substantial controversy how to explain the experimental results. In reference [127] the quadrupole shift was explained by a model utilizing the concept of a magnetically induced electric-field gradient (EFG). In Ref. [128] this interpretation was discarded in favour of magnetostriction effects, and in [129] it was concluded that the EFG might be magnetically induced for T &gt; 40 K, but was implausible at lower temperatures. It was by the authors of Ref. [130] to identify an orbital-order transition at T oo ∼10 K: At this temperature, they identified abrupt changes of hyperfine field and EFG and explained these observations in terms of a static distortion of the tetrahedral sites with c/a &lt; 1 and attributed this distortion to a JT stabilization of the 5 E g ground state of Fe 2+ in tetrahedral symmetry. For temperatures &gt; 10 K they proposed to explain the Mössbauer data in terms of a dynamic JT stabilization. They concluded that FeCr 2 S 4 may be one of the rare examples, which allows studying the transition from a dynamic to a static JT effect. Later on this proposal has been substantiated by further Mössbauer [131][132][133] and low-temperature heat-capacity experiments [132].

In reference [127] the quadrupole shift was explained by a model utilizing the concept of a magnetically induced electric-field gradient (EFG). In Ref. [128] this interpretation was discarded in favour of magnetostriction effects, and in [129] it was concluded that the EFG might be magnetically induced for T &gt; 40 K, but was implausible at lower temperatures. It was by the authors of Ref. [130] to identify an orbital-order transition at T oo ∼10 K: At this temperature, they identified abrupt changes of hyperfine field and EFG and explained these observations in terms of a static distortion of the tetrahedral sites with c/a &lt; 1 and attributed this distortion to a JT stabilization of the 5 E g ground state of Fe 2+ in tetrahedral symmetry. For temperatures &gt; 10 K they proposed to explain the Mössbauer data in terms of a dynamic JT stabilization. They concluded that FeCr 2 S 4 may be one of the rare examples, which allows studying the transition from a dynamic to a static JT effect. Later on this proposal has been substantiated by further Mössbauer [131][132][133] and low-temperature heat-capacity experiments [132].

        <p>Fig. 12 schematically shows the electronic level splitting in FeCr 2 S 4 in the different temperature regimes and the internal microscopic driving forces for these effects, which are experimentally observed in Mössbauer experiments. By the tetrahedral crystal field, Fe 2+ is split into an excited triplet t 2 and a ground-state doublet e. The tetrahedral crystal-field splitting ∆ tet is of order 0.5 eV. Below the onset of FiM order, the spin degeneracy of the spin state S = 2 at the iron site is removed and the electronic ground state will be split into five equidistant doublets by the magnetic exchange field. Finally, at the lowest temperatures a further splitting due to second-order spin-orbit interactions is expected. This splitting can be estimated as 2δ ∼12 λ 2 /∆ tet , where λ represents the spin-orbit interaction. Hence, despite the fact that the overall symmetry is almost cubic, there will be a finite magnetically-induced EFG. Below the JT transition with long-range OO, the lowest doublet will additionally split characterized by a splitting ∆ oo . This splitting will compete with the splitting due to the spin-orbit interaction and in most cases will yield changes in the level splitting. In addition to these changes of the level splitting also the level scheme can be inverted [Fig. 12(d)]. Obviously, in FeCr 2 S 4 the energies of spin-orbit and spin-phonon coupling compete and favour different ground states.Fig. 12 schematically shows the electronic level splitting in FeCr 2 S 4 in the different temperature regimes and the internal microscopic driving forces for these effects, which are experimentally observed in Mössbauer experiments.

In the left frame, a series of 57 Fe absorption spectra as observed in FeCr 2 S 4 is documented, characteristic for the different temperature regimes revealing different magnetically or orbitally ordered phases. The shape of these spectra resembles those reported in earlier Mössbauer experiments. Above T c , in the PM phase at 292 K, a dominant single Lorentzian resonance is observed as expected for an ideal A site tetrahedral sulphur coordination of Fe 2+ . Below T c , in the FiM phase at 136.1 K, a symmetrical six-line pattern is observed, typical for a collinear FiM structure, yet with a small quadrupole interaction due to an axially symmetric EFG. The EFG is increasing with increasing magnetic hyperfine field. The observation of a finite quadrupole interaction at the iron site below the Curie temperature, despite the fact that neutron data [124] have identified a cubic structure even in the magnetically ordered phase, was discussed controversially [126,127,129,[131][132][133][138][139][140].

Its temperature dependence below T c is typical for a second-order magnetic phase transition and smoothly follows the sublattice magnetization down to ∼50 K. Below 50 K, the spectra cannot be described by a single magnetic site (see absorption spectra at 24.8 K). Three sets of hyperfine interactions with equal spectral weight, characteristic for three magnetically and structurally non-equivalent sites were necessary to fit the data [135]. At this temperature, the local axial symmetry is lost and an asymmetry parameter was necessary to describe the field-gradient tensor, which is in agreement with transmission-electron microscopy studies indicating a cubic-to-triclinic phase transition [141].

The gradual decrease of B hf below 50 K (upper right frame of Fig. 13) is caused by continuous changes in the crystalline electric field. Finally, below 10 K a significant change in quadrupole interaction was identified with a change of sign and re-orientation of the EFG (see absorption spectra at 4.2 K). These dramatic changes in the spectra are best documented by the temperature dependence of the quadrupole splitting, shown in the lower right frame of Fig. 13. Its major axis is now pointing perpendicular to the magnetic hyperfine field. Quantitatively similar conclusions have been drawn already in Ref. [129].

        <p>Field-cooled (FC) and zero-field cooled (ZFC) magnetic susceptibilities as measured in external magnetic fields of 100 Oe (10 mT) in Ref. [142] are shown in Fig. 14. The well-defined step-like increase of the susceptibility close to T C = 165 K signals the onset of FiM order with strictly antiparallel alignment of chromium and iron spins. The splitting of FC and ZFC susceptibilities can be explained in terms of domain-wall dynamics. A well-defined decrease of both susceptibilities close to T m ∼ 60 K signals a further magnetic transition into a more complex spin state, probably a spiral spin order, which will be discussed later. Finally, a small anomaly at T OO ∼ 9 K was interpreted as onset of OO of the JT active orbitals of the Fe 2+ ions in tetrahedral environment. Fig. 14 also shows the relative change of the longitudinal sound velocity (right ordinate) as function of temperature. The strong coupling of the iron orbitals to the lattice degrees of freedom is documented by a significant anomaly with a clear V-shaped minimum sound velocity at T oo . The sound velocity starts to decrease below 60 K, which probably signals the onset of orbital fluctuations with a strong coupling to longitudinal sound waves. In the temperature dependence of the longitudinal sound velocity, the onset of FiM order is indicated by a small anomaly only. Before discussing the orbital ordering transition in full detail, we shortly mention the magnetic transition close to 60 K, which will be discussed later -in the chapter on multiferroics -in more detail. The critical temperature T m ∼60 K probably indicates a transition into a non-collinear spin configuration of chromium and iron moments. This anomaly has been identified earlier in ESR experiments [143] as well as in ac susceptibility measurements [144]. However, the most convincing evidence has been derived from muon spin-rotation spectroscopy [136] as well as from Mössbauer experiments as documented in Fig. 13 and outlined above [135].

        <p>To further elucidate the orbital ordering transition in FeCr 2 S 4 , Fig. 15 shows the temperature dependence of the specific heat as taken from Ref. [142]. For presentation purposes, the specific heat is plotted as C /T vs. T. Two well-defined λ-type anomalies indicate the phase transitions into the FiM (T C ) and into the orbitally ordered (T OO ) phases. The pure phononderived contribution to the heat capacity was estimated utilizing a Debye-Einstein model with appropriate characteristic temperatures, which is indicated by the blue dashed line in Fig. 15 [142]. After subtracting the pure lattice contributions to the heat capacity, the temperature dependence of the remaining magnetic entropy can be calculated and is shown in the inset of Fig. 15. The entropy release at the orbital ordering transition is expected to be of order Rln2, corresponding to the ground state doublet. Approximately half of this entropy value is reached just at T OO only. It is interesting to note that full entropy release, which is expected for the orbital doublet involved in the JT transition, is reached close to the critical temperature T m , again indicating that this temperature denotes the onset of orbital fluctuations and via a strong spin-lattice coupling a magnetic phase transition with a more complex, probably spiral-like spin structure is induced.To further elucidate the orbital ordering transition in FeCr 2 S 4 , Fig. 15 shows the temperature dependence of the specific heat as taken from Ref.

In FeCr 2 S 4 , taking the orbital-ordering transition at a temperature of 9 K as given, the zero-gap value should be of order ∼18 K. The result of a mean-field model fit is shown as red solid line in the inset of Fig. 16 and was derived assuming a zero-temperature gap ∆ 0 ∼14.8 K, in reasonable agreement with the model prediction ∆ 0 = 2 T OO [145]. As documented in the inset of Fig. 16, the jump at the orbital-ordering transition is significantly smaller than the predicted value of 1.5 R. A fact that again documents that precursor phenomena due to orbital ordering are established already at significantly higher temperatures. The orbital gap as derived from these thermodynamic measurements is notably smaller than the value of the orbital gap as determined from Mössbauer spectroscopy [135], where a gap value of ∆ 0 ∼32 K has been determined. To explain this difference, three things have to be stated: (i) as can be seen in Fig. 12, the ground state doublet is already split, even above the orbital-ordering transition by second-order spin-orbit interactions, which compete with the spin-phonon energy, both energies obviously preferring a different ground state. At the JT transition the level splitting is dictated by the long-range spin-phonon coupling; at the phase-transition temperature the splitting is increased and reversed. In the analysis of the temperature-dependence of the specific heat, the level splitting above the onset of OO was not taken into account. (ii) the heat capacity measures bulk properties averaging over possible gap anisotropies and averaging over local exchange fields, and (iii) in FeCr 2 S 4 there is significant sample dependence of the JT splitting as outlined in Ref. [142]. Symmetry-lowering phase transitions can easily be identified by infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy following the temperature evolution of phonon eigenfrequencies crossing structural, orbital, or magnetic phase transitions. The IR active phonon modes of FeCr 2 S 4 have been investigated by a number of groups [147][148][149], however, with no special focus on the low-temperature orbital ordering transition or on the magnetic transition at the critical temperature T m . Raman active modes were reported by Choi et al. [150], only reporting anomalies in phonon frequencies and excitation linewidths around the FM ordering temperature T C . In a recent far-infrared spectroscopy study, the detailed temperature dependence of all phonon eigenfrequencies was studied in detail, when crossing all critical phase transitions [146]. The temperature dependence of the phonon eigenfrequencies as reported in this work are documented in Fig. 17. The cubic high-temperature phase of FeCr 2 S 4 is characterized by four IR-active phonon modes. These four modes exhibit a moderate and continuous temperature evolution, where the modes 3 and 4 soften, while the eigenfrequencies of modes 1 and 2 rather moderately increase on cooling. This behaviour signals the importance of spin and orbital degrees of freedom coupled to the lattice. Assuming a crystalline lattice without any further internal degrees of freedom, on decreasing temperatures the evolution of all mode-eigenfrequencies would exhibit a moderate softening due to anharmonic effects.at the ordering temperature in the heat capacity amounts to 1.5 R, where R is the gas constant.

This behaviour signals the importance of spin and orbital degrees of freedom coupled to the lattice. Assuming a crystalline lattice without any further internal degrees of freedom, on decreasing temperatures the evolution of all mode-eigenfrequencies would exhibit a moderate softening due to anharmonic effects.</p>
        <p>In addition, the lowest-lying T 1u (1) mode broadens and splits on passing the characteristic temperature T m ∼60 K. This is further experimental evidence for symmetry lowering, associated with the appearance of an incommensurate (IC) helical magnetic order, as has been identified by muon-spin relaxation experiments [136] and as documented in Fig. 14 via magnetic-susceptibility experiments [142]. Two new modes, R 1 and R 2 , appear below the onset of OO (see Fig. 17). These new modes are Raman active and have been reported in Raman experiments [150]. They are interpreted as signatures of a symmetry-lowering transition with the loss of inversion symmetry reflecting the MF and orbitally-ordered ground state (for more details see the Section 3.4 on multiferroics).In addition, the lowest-lying T 1u (1) mode broadens and splits on passing the characteristic temperature T m ∼60 K.

        <p>Astonishingly, there appears a new mode M below the characteristic temperature T * ∼120 K well within the ferrimagnetically ordered regime. In this temperature regime, no evidence for a structural change has been reported. However, several experimental studies noticed significant changes in this temperature regime: The magnetocrystalline anisotropy seems to change below this temperature as evidenced by ac susceptibility [144], electron spin resonance [143], as well as by magnetization and time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr spectroscopy studies [151]. Moreover, the evaluation of the Fe-Mössbauer spectra by Kalvius et al. [136] pointed towards a finite EFG in the magnetically ordered phase, which starts to increase monotonously on cooling below 120 K. The latter authors speculate about a minor lattice distortion occurring below this temperature, which does not alter the collinear spin arrangement, but influences the electric quadrupolar field at the iron nuclei. Such a scenario is consistent with an interpretation of the symmetry of mode M, which directly couples to the electronic e orbitals of the Fe ions. However, another scenario should be taken into account, which will be later discussed in full detail: A number of chromium spinels reveal anomalies approximately in this temperature regime, which were thought to arise from the relaxation dynamics of off-centre chromium ions constituting a local static dipole moment. One is tempted to speculate that FeCr 2 S 4 also belongs to this class of spinel materials with a locally broken inversion symmetry and with a tendency towards polar order.Astonishingly, there appears a new mode M below the characteristic temperature T * ∼120 K well within the ferrimagnetically ordered regime.

        <p>In these crystals the λ-like anomaly due to orbital ordering as observed in the temperature dependence of the specific heat becomes suppressed leaving a hump-like anomaly close to 5 K, which was interpreted as an orbital glass transition [41,153]. It was argued that at this orbital-glass transition, the orientations of the electronic orbitals freeze in into random orientations without establishing long-range OO as resulting from a cooperative JT transition. To our knowledge, FeCr 2 S 4 is the only material where such an orbital-glass transition was identified. The dynamics and the slowing down of the orbital reorientations was studied in detail by dielectric spectroscopy by Fichtl et al. [41]. It was argued that the electron density coupled to local lattice distortions induces dipolar moments and allows following the orbital reorientational dynamics by dielectric spectroscopy. A schematic view of the orbital orientations with their local structural distortions for the different scenarios, namely a high-temperature orbital liquid (OL), OO and orbital glass is shown in Fig . 18 [154]. The OL is characterized by an orbitally degenerate ground state or by a small level splitting of the ground state, resulting in an equal thermal population of the involved energy levels. Here, on time average, the orbitals point in all symmetry-allowed crystallographic directions establishing over-all cubic symmetry. A cooperative JT transition induces long-range OO with accompanying long-range structural distortions. Due to disorder and frustration effects, long-range order can be suppressed and the electronic orbitals coupled to their local structural distortions, essentially freeze into random orientations yielding a low-temperature glass-like state. In contrast to a canonical glass transition, however, here quantum-mechanical tunnelling prevents complete freezing-in and at the lowest temperatures, orbital motion still is possible, albeit with typical time scales of the order of 0.1 s. This is exceptionally slow for electronic degrees of freedom, which reflects the involved coupled lattice distortions. In the orbital glass, the overall cubic lattice symmetry is not broken. However, locally strong deviations occur, which are practically frozen on quasi-static time scales. This orbital glass phase seems to be closely related to the freezing observed in orientational glasses and so-called plastic crystals, where molecular orientations freeze into random directions devoid of long-range orientational order [155,156].In these crystals the λ-like anomaly due to orbital ordering as observed in the temperature dependence of the specific heat becomes suppressed leaving a hump-like anomaly close to 5 K, which was interpreted as an orbital glass transition [41,153].

        <p>It is known since more than 50 years that the chromium spinels ACr 2 X 4 , with A = Zn, Mg, Cd, and Hg, and X = O, S and Se, span an enormous range of magnetic exchange interactions, with CW temperatures ranging from -600 K to +200 K [106]. A summary of crystallographic data, PM moments p eff , CW temperatures Θ CW , and magnetic ordering temperatures T m , as reproduced from Ref. [38] is provided in Table 1. From this table it becomes immediately clear that when considering all chromium spinels, ranging from zinc to mercury at the A site and from oxide to selenide at the X site, the lattice constants strongly depend on the constituents of the lattice, increasing from oxygen to selenium and from zinc to mercury. Concomitantly the magnetic properties change considerably: the CW temperatures range from -398 K in ZnCr 2 O 4 to +200 K in the mercury selenide, indicating drastic changes of the magnetic exchange interactions. CdCr 2 S 4 , CdCr 2 Se 4 , and HgCr 2 Se 4 exhibit true FM ground states and belong to the rare classes of FM insulators or FM semiconductors, while all the other compounds reveal complex AFM spin order, with ordering temperatures ranging from 10-20 K, irrespective of the CW temperature. Hence, also the frustration parameter changes considerably, ranging from values close to f ∼ 30 in some oxides with the smallest lattice constants, to values of order f ∼ 1 in the selenides with FM spin structure. At this point it has to be mentioned that the frustration parameter f signals geometrical frustration effects of magnetic moments with AFM interactions. In the case of ZnCr 2 S 4 , the value of f = 0.5 does not signal the complete absence of frustration effects, but rather competing FM and AFM exchange interactions of considerable but comparable strength. These competing magnetic exchange interactions result in an almost zero CW temperature, but establish a complex low-temperature spin structure, which will be elaborated in the course of this review.It is known since more than 50 years that the chromium spinels ACr 2 X 4 , with A = Zn, Mg, Cd, and Hg, and X = O, S and Se, span an enormous range of magnetic exchange interactions, with CW temperatures ranging from -600 K to +200 K [106].

        <p>Cr 3+ with an electronic d 3 configuration is located in an octahedral environment of oxygens with a lower t 2g triplet (see Fig. 6), which consequently is half filled. Hence a spin-only value of the magnetic moment is expected with very little spinlattice coupling. As will be seen later, experimentally this is not at all observed. The different CW temperatures and the resulting magnetic ground states as a function of lattice constants are driven by the dominating exchange interactions: at small Cr-Cr separation, strong direct AFM exchange dominates. With increasing separation, the 90 • FM Cr-X -Cr exchange becomes more and more important. Probably, for all lattice spacings a complex Cr-X -A-X -Cr SE is active.

        <p>Fig. 19 shows a schematic diagram with the characteristic ordering temperatures plotted vs. the CW temperatures. It is obvious that in this series of spinel compounds the CW temperature scales with the lattice constant (see Table 1), or to be more precise with the chromium-chromium separation. However, in the chosen type of presentation the coaction of frustration effects and competing interactions are clearly visible. ZnCr 2 O 4 , with the smallest lattice spacing, is dominated by strong and direct AFM exchange resulting in a large and negative CW temperature. In the selenides characterized by much larger lattice spacings, the 90 • FM exchange is the dominant interaction resulting in positive CW temperatures. In the intermediate range, FM and AFM exchange compete and partly compensate, yielding characteristic temperatures close to zero. Two straight lines given by the positive, respectively negative CW temperatures define the tentative ordering temperatures of non-frustrated magnets and represent the ideal FM or AFM exchange.

        <p>In the AFM regime, corresponding to large and negative CW temperatures, strong magnetic frustration is active, with ZnCr 2 O 4 and MgCr 2 O 4 revealing the strongest effects with f ∼ 30. These compounds seem to be prototypical examples of strongly frustrated pyrochlore lattices where no spin configuration simultaneously can satisfy all six AFM interactions among the spins located at vertices of the tetrahedral building blocks. It is theoretically documented that this so-called pyrochlore antiferromagnet has no phase transition for any spin S and forms a quantum spin liquid with low-lying singlet excitations for S = 1 2 [158][159][160]. However, small perturbations away from the ideal model or further non-leading interactions can induce low-temperature phase transitions. ZnCr 2 O 4 undergoes a first-order cubic to tetragonal phase transition concomitant with the onset of AFM order at 12.5 K [162]. The full spin entropy of this transition, 2Rln4, is reached well above room temperature only, consistent with strong magnetic frustration and a high CW temperature [162]. This magneto-structural transition has been interpreted as being of spin-Peierls type [163]. That the symmetry of the AFM phase may be even lower than tetragonal was concluded from a detailed AFM resonance study [164]. Several resonance modes corresponding to different structural domains were observed, but the number of domains could be reduced by field cooling the sample through the transition point. To describe the AFM resonance spectra, it was necessary to assume an orthorhombic lattice distortion in addition to the above-mentioned tetragonal distortion.In the AFM regime, corresponding to large and negative CW temperatures, strong magnetic frustration is active, with ZnCr 2 O 4 and MgCr 2 O 4 revealing the strongest effects with f ∼ 30.

        <p>In addition, in the ordered phase a localized spin resonance located at an energy of 4.5 meV develops abruptly out of the PM spin-fluctuation spectrum. The most detailed low-temperature model is based on synchrotron X-ray single-crystal diffraction [165]. This model comprises a complex low-temperature structure with three types of tetrahedra with different bond distortions. The authors of Ref. [165] concluded that the match between the local structural distortions with different bond lengths and the moment arrangement within the tetrahedra is incomplete. Subsequently, Lee et al. [27] utilizing neutron-scattering experiments measured the form factor of the lowest-energy excitations in ZnCr 2 O 4 and recognized that it results from AFM hexagonal spin loops. The measurements were performed in the PM regime just above the ordering temperature and the hexagonal spin loops were interpreted as local zero-energy modes of the pyrochlore Heisenberg antiferromagnet. Similar quasi-elastic and inelastic neutron scattering techniques experiments, documenting that the magnetic ground state in these strongly frustrated chromium oxides is not a simple antiferromagnet, but that the spins form complex spin molecules or spin clusters with accompanying molecular-like quasiparticle excitations, were conducted by Tomiyasu et al. [166,167] in MgCr 2 O 4 . Astonishingly, these authors identified a set of molecular spin excitation modes in the PM and in the magnetically ordered phase, an observation, which was explained using a concept of frustrated excitations [167]. A detailed report on the low-temperature magneto-structural transitions in this compound and the resulting complex crystallographic and spin order has also been given by Gao et al. [168]. By neutron diffraction in the magnetically ordered phase these authors confirmed two main magnetic propagation vectors k 1 = ( 1 2 1 2 0) and k 2 = (1 0 1 2 ). The corresponding reflections respond differently to external magnetic fields implying the formation of multiple domains. It is worth mentioning that a quantum mean-field model for the pyrochlore lattice has been developed in Ref. © 2007 by the Institute of Physics (IOP). [169]. In this model, not single spins but the assumption of a set of interacting corner-sharing tetrahedra was utilized to explain the temperature dependence of the susceptibility in ZnCr 2 O 4 . Now, returning to Fig. 19, with decreasing CW temperatures, AFM and FM exchange interactions compete, are almost of equal strength, and again establish complex magnetic ground states. The oxides CdCr 2 O 4 and HgCr 2 O 4 , as well the sulphide ZnCr 2 S 4 are very close to this limit, where the two dominating exchange interactions almost completely compensate (see Fig. 19). CdCr 2 O 4 also undergoes a spin-Peierls-like phase transition close to ∼8 K [162,170]. Despite the fact that the cadmium and zinc chromium oxide are closely related compounds governed by similar frustration effects, in contrast to the distortion observed in ZnCr 2 O 4 , at the magneto-structural transition CdCr 2 O 4 undergoes elongation along the c axis and exhibits an IC Néel order at the lowest temperatures [170]. The difference in the structural distortions and the resulting difference in the spin structure could result from the fact that the zinc compound is governed by geometrical frustration and is a prototypical example of a frustrated Heisenberg AFM, while in the cadmium compound frustration results from competing interactions with increasing importance of FM exchange. It has been shown that the lattice distortion of the cadmium compound stabilizes coplanar magnetic order and that the lack of inversion symmetry makes the crystal structure chiral [171]. Later on, model calculations and comparison to experiments revealed that a soft optical phonon triggers the magnetic transition and endows the lattice chirality [172]. Interestingly, the spin relaxation in the chromium oxide spinels ACr 2 O 4 (A = Mg, Zn, Cd) was investigated in the PM regime by ESR [173]. The temperature dependence of the ESR linewidth indicates an unconventional spin-relaxation behaviour, similar to spin-spin relaxation in the two-dimensional (2D) triangular lattice antiferromagnets. The authors of Ref. [173] were able to describe these ESR results in terms of a generalized Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type scenario for 2D systems with additional internal symmetries. Based on the characteristic exponents obtained from the evaluation of the ESR linewidth, short-range order with a hidden internal symmetry was suggested.In addition, in the ordered phase a localized spin resonance located at an energy of 4.5 meV develops abruptly out of the PM spin-fluctuation spectrum.

        <p>On cooling without external field, HgCr 2 O 4 undergoes an orthorhombic distortion at the Néel ordering temperature T N = 5.8 K [174]. Its frustration parameter f = 5.5 (Table 1) is not very large, but in this compound competing FM and AFM exchange interactions certainly play an important role. Like the other chromium oxide spinels, it shows a magnetic ordering with concomitant structural distortions. However, the symmetry of the lattice is orthorhombic as opposed to tetragonal of the other oxide compounds, and the volume change at the transition is substantially larger [174]. Elastic magnetic-neutron scattering data obtained in zero magnetic field documented that in the low-temperature phase the spins order long range with two characteristic magnetic-ordering wave vectors (1/2,0,1) and (1,0,0) [175]. All the chromium oxides gained considerable attention because of the observation of a sequence of fractionalized magnetization plateaus in high-field magnetization experiments, which will be discussed in the next chapter. An informative and detailed review on these novel states of matter induced by frustration effects in this class of chromium oxide spinels was given by Lee et al.

Elastic magnetic-neutron scattering data obtained in zero magnetic field documented that in the low-temperature phase the spins order long range with two characteristic magnetic-ordering wave vectors (1/2,0,1) and (1,0,0) [175]. All the chromium oxides gained considerable attention because of the observation of a sequence of fractionalized magnetization plateaus in high-field magnetization experiments, which will be discussed in the next chapter. An informative and detailed review on these novel states of matter induced by frustration effects in this class of chromium oxide spinels was given by Lee et al. [176].</p>

        <p>ZnCr 2 Se 4 exhibits a first-order phase transition at 21 K into an IC helical spin structure propagating along &lt;100&gt; [186]. This IC spin helix, characterized by a proper screw structure with a propagation vector (0 0 0.44), reminds on the spin-spiral structure of the sulphide in the intermediate phase. The magnetic excitation spectrum of the helimagnetic ZnCr 2 Se 4 was investigated by neutron spectroscopy and analysed in detail by theoretical model calculations [187]. Lowenergy magnetic excitations were observed in the single-domain proper-screw spiral phase and were interpreted as soft helimagnon modes with a small energy gap of ∼0.17 meV, which emerge from two orthogonal wave vectors where no magnetic Bragg peaks are present. These Goldstone modes in ZnCr 2 Se 4 were related to the occurrence of a magneticfield driven quantum critical point (QCP), which was proposed and identified by Gu et al. [188]. The evolution of specific magnon modes across the QCP, which separates the spin-spiral from the field-induced FM phase, was recently investigated by a combination of neutron scattering, ultra sound velocity and dilatometry experiments by Inosov et al. [189]. These authors found that the magnon modes completely soften at the QCP, restoring over-all cubic symmetry, and linearly increase with increasing magnetic field when entering the field-polarized phase. In addition, based on NMR experiments by Park et al. [190], a partial transfer of chromium moments to the neighbouring Se sites was proposed, a fact that could explain the finite spin-lattice interactions.ZnCr 2 Se 4 exhibits a first-order phase transition at 21 K into an IC helical spin structure propagating along &lt;100&gt; [186].

        <p>Neutron-diffraction studies of the normal spinel HgCr 2 S 4 [184] show that the magnetic structure is a simple spiral, similar to the observations in ZnCr 2 Se 4,179 . The propagation vector is along the symmetry axis of the spiral and directed along a particular cube edge of a given domain. The ordered moment of Cr 3+ was found to be 2.73 µ B , in agreement with bulk magnetization measurements. Further magnetization, ESR, and specific-heat studies documented strong FM fluctuations close to 50 K and the occurrence of complex AFM order below T N ∼ 22 K [116]. The highly unconventional magnetic behaviour resembles properties of a helical antiferromagnet and of a soft ferromagnet, dependent on temperature and magnetic field.

        <p>In this respect it is important to mention that the critical behaviour of CdCr2S4 close to the Curie temperature follows that expected for an ideal 3D Heisenberg system, however, in an unusually narrow window of temperature and in low magnetic fields only [193]. Moreover, in the FM phase of CdCr 2 S 4 detailed investigations of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) revealed a pronounced anomalous cubic anisotropy not expected for the spin S =3/2 ground-state quartet of Cr 3+ , which should remain degenerate in purely cubic symmetry. In Ref. [194] any extrinsic effect, which would explain the magneto-crystalline anisotropy could be ruled out. Indeed, a model with local trigonal distortions along the four &lt;111&gt; cube-space diagonals gave a satisfactory description of the data. Moreover, the superposition of four uniaxial anisotropies coalescing into one ESR line by exchange narrowing helped to understand the linewidth anomalies. From a theoretical point of view, the trigonal distortion of the CrS 6 octahedra (along the four &lt;111&gt; directions) partially lifts the degeneracy of the spin quartet into two doublets and thus gives rise to a locally uniaxial anisotropy.In this respect it is important to mention that the critical behaviour of CdCr2S4 close to the Curie temperature follows that expected for an ideal 3D Heisenberg system, however, in an unusually narrow window of temperature and in low magnetic fields only [193].

        <p>As outlined above, the chromium spinels are expected to be Mott insulators with a half-filled t 2g shell, with S = 3/2, an almost spherical charge distribution and negligible spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In fact, one can expect that in these compounds orbital effects are quenched and they behave like spin-only systems with weak coupling to the lattice only. However, as documented in the preceding chapter, rather unexpectedly the magnetic transitions in all compounds are strongly coupled to the lattice and the complex spin-ground states can only be explained taking considerable spin-lattice coupling into account. This unusual spin-lattice coupling in chromium spinels has early been recognized by Kino and Lüthi [195] analysing ultrasonic experiments in ZnCr 2 O 4 . These authors observed a strong softening of the shear elastic constant (c 11 -c 12 ), which at that time remained unexplained. Later on this strong spin-phonon coupling in chromium spinels has been treated on the basis of a spin-driven JT effect [36,37,196] which subsequently has been called magnetic JT or spin JT effect. These theories proposed an elegant mechanism for lifting the frustration of spins on a pyrochlore lattice through a coupling between spin and lattice degrees of freedom. The high symmetry of the pyrochlore lattice and the spin degeneracy drive a distortion of the corner-sharing tetrahedra via a magnetic-type JT effect. The resulting low-temperature state exhibits a transition from cubic to tetragonal symmetry and the development of bond order in the spin system with unequal spin correlations &lt; S i • S j &gt; on different bonds of the tetrahedra. In the ordered phase, there are 4 (2) strong and 2 (4) weak bonds per tetrahedron.

        <p>The magnetic structure can be described by AFM spin order along b accompanied by a slight buckling of the surrounding oxygen octahedral (see middle frame of Fig. 20). The spin structure within a single tetrahedron is shown in the left frame. Later on, a controversy arose about the role of the vanadium orbitals in these vanadium-oxide spinels. Tsunetsugo and Motome [201] proposed that the structural transition in ZnV 2 O 4 observed at 50 K should be attributed to the onset of OO introducing spatial modulations of spin-exchange couplings, which partially releases frustration and leads to subsequent spin order at 40 K. The scenario was corroborated by inelastic neutron-scattering experiments showing that the spin-excitation spectra adopt one-dimensional characteristics [202].

        <p>Some archetypal examples of the splitting of phonon modes at the magneto-structural transitions in a number of spinel compounds are documented in Fig. 21 [38]. This phonon splitting is driven by the spin JT effect, which is active for antiferromagnetically coupled spins located at the vortices of a pyrochlore lattice. At room temperature, the four IR-active modes of the cubic spinel lattice are observed. Please note that the eigenfrequencies strongly depend on the anion: The mode frequencies are stiff for the oxide and rather soft for the selenide. The continuous increase on cooling results from conventional anharmonic interactions of the phonons [38]. For CdCr 2 O 4 , ZnCr 2 S 4 , and ZnCr 2 Se 4 a clear splitting of some of the phonons can be observed below the magneto-structural phase transitions, which certainly depends on symmetry and how much the chromium ion, carrying the localized spin, is involved in the specific displacement pattern of a given excitation. In most cases, the phonon splitting when observed is of order 10 cm -1 corresponding to energies of ∼1 meV. Sushkov et al.

In this compound AFM ordering can be suppressed in an external magnetic field of 7 T and the spin system enters into a field-polarized FM phase [180]. This transition from the AFM to the spin-polarized state can be mirrored by optical spectroscopy and can be identified via the splitting of the lowest-frequency phonon mode. A representative result is documented in Fig. 22, where the splitting of the mode close to 95 cm -1 is suppressed in an external magnetic field of 7 T [206]. Later on, utilizing magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and thermal expansion experiments, it was documented that the spin spiral state is separated from the field-polarized phase by a QCP [188] close to 6 T. At this QCP the magnon modes completely soften and the cubic symmetry of crystalline lattice is restored [189], fully compatible with the suppression of the phonon splitting as documented in Fig. 22.That spin-lattice coupling can also be suppressed by external magnetic fields has been impressively documented by Rudolf et al.

        <p>Here S i and S j are neighbouring spins on a single tetrahedron, J is the magnetic exchange and b measures the strength of the spin-lattice coupling. The sum &lt;ij&gt; runs over all nearest-neighbour bonds of the pyrochlore lattice. The resulting generalized phase diagram is shown in Fig. 23. For small fields h the lattice has overall tetragonal symmetry with distorted tetrahedra, with two long FM bonds and four short canted AFM bonds. In this regime, the magnetization remains linear, but with reduced slope [213]. For h ∼ 3 J and b ≥ 0.05, the system undergoes a first-order transition into a collinear phase with three spins up and one spin down irrespective of the external magnetic field h. This 3:1 phase exhibits an extended and stable half-magnetization plateau over a broad field range. In this half-magnetization plateau phase, each tetrahedron has three long FM and three short AF bonds, giving rise to an overall trigonal lattice distortion. The width of the halfmagnetization plateau shrinks linearly with decreasing coupling strength and at low values of b two further phases, a coplanar 2:1:1 canted phase and a coplanar 3:1 canted phase are stabilized. Finally, at large fields there is a transition into a cubic fully saturated FM phase. Later on the ordered and disordered phases of this bilinear and biquadratic Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice were studied at finite temperatures and fields [215]. In these calculations, the authors found a rich collection of unconventional spin states, like nematic and vector-multipole phases with distinct symmetries, separated by a half-magnetization plateau. All of these states were deduced from a proper understanding of the geometry of the pyrochlore lattice and the properties of a single tetrahedron and along these lines the zero-temperature phase diagram can be explained from an assembly of ordered tetrahedra into complex states of higher symmetry.Here S i and S j are neighbouring spins on a single tetrahedron, J is the magnetic exchange and b measures the strength of the spin-lattice coupling. The sum &lt;ij&gt; runs over all nearest-neighbour bonds of the pyrochlore lattice. The resulting generalized phase diagram is shown in Fig. 23. For small fields h the lattice has overall tetragonal symmetry with distorted tetrahedra, with two long FM bonds and four short canted AFM bonds. In this regime, the magnetization remains linear, but with reduced slope [213]. For h ∼ 3 J and b ≥ 0.05, the system undergoes a first-order transition into a collinear phase with three spins up and one spin down irrespective of the external magnetic field h.

        <p>This extended half-magnetization plateau was clearly observed in high-field magnetization experiments up to 50 T in the chromium oxide spinels CdCr 2 O 4 [211] and HgCr 2 O 4,173,211 as documented in Fig. 24. In the former compound, the half-magnetization plateau evolves beyond 30 T. In the mercury spinel the plateau extends roughly between 10 and 30 T. It is interesting that no magnetization plateaus up to 50 T were observed in ZnCr 2 O 4 and MgCr 2 O 4 . However, in these compounds half magnetization is still not reached even at the highest field values of these experiments and it can be expected that similar half-magnetization plateaus will be reached at significantly higher fields. In addition, magnetization plateaus were not observed in ZnCr 2 S 4 and ZnCr 2 Se 4 . These compounds are characterized by a continuous increase of the magnetization until the fully field-polarized FM state is reached. The missing evolution of fractionalized magnetization values in these latter compounds already signals a significantly different frustration mechanism. Indeed, while in the oxides the spins on the pyrochlore lattice are strongly antiferromagnetically coupled and frustration is released via a spin-JT effect, in ZnCr 2 S 4 and ZnCr 2 Se 4 FM and AFM exchange interactions compete (see Fig. 19) and in increasing external fields the FM exchange will be continuously strengthened.This extended half-magnetization plateau was clearly observed in high-field magnetization experiments up to 50 T in the chromium oxide spinels CdCr 2 O 4 [211] and HgCr 2 O 4,173,211 as documented in Fig. 24.

        <p>The theoretically predicted structural phase transition at the evolution of the half-magnetization plateau in CdCr 2 O 4 was measured utilizing a high-field X-ray diffraction technique by Inami et al. [216]. Theoretically, in the 3:1 phase with three long FM and three short AFM bonds a rhombohedral or cubic lattice symmetry is expected, depending on the sign of the next-nearest neighbour interaction. If the plateau phase was rhombohedral, the 440 reflection would split into two peaks, which however, experimentally was not observed. Hence, it was concluded that the half-magnetization plateau exhibits cubic symmetry, or a splitting, which is too small to be experimentally observed [216]. Spin order and lattice symmetry of the half-magnetization plateau, which evolves between 10 and 30 T in HgCr 2 O 4 has also been investigated in detail by high-field neutron and synchrotron X-ray scattering techniques [175]. These authors found that the magnetic structure has the same symmetry as the crystal structure: When entering the field-induced half-magnetization plateau the symmetry of the system changes from the orthorhombic Néel state with total zero spin by a first-order transition into a cubic collinear AFM 3:1 state with half the magnetization of the total spin system.The theoretically predicted structural phase transition at the evolution of the half-magnetization plateau in CdCr 2 O 4 was measured utilizing a high-field X-ray diffraction technique by Inami et al.

        <p>In the following years, the chromium oxide spinels were investigated in ultra-high external magnetic fields up to 600 T utilizing magneto-optical techniques, like Faraday rotation or magneto-optical absorption techniques [217][218][219][220][221][222][223]. These experiments were mainly devoted to establish the full (H,T )-phase diagrams of compounds governed by strong magnetic couplings between nearest neighbouring chromium ions, e.g., like ZnCr 2 O 4 , MgCr 2 O 4 and CdCr 2 O 4 , where full saturation of the field-polarized phase could not be reached with external magnetic fields up to 50 T (see Fig. 24). All these compounds exhibit stable half-magnetization plateaus and in all compounds, finally the fully polarized field could be reached, which is established at 90 T in the cadmium compound [217], at ∼130 T in the magnesium compound [222] and at fields of ∼400 T in the zinc compound [219]. In addition to the observation of the sequence of known spin patterns like the 3:1 or the canted 3:1 phase, theoretically predicted phases, like a canted 2:1:1 phase, were identified in these experiments [218,219,222]. Some of these magnetic phases were discussed as symmetry analogues to the quantum phases of liquid helium, like super-solid or super-liquid phases [218,220].

        <p>There were a number of high-field magnetization and ultrasound studies in spinel chromium sulphides and selenides with AFM ground states [224,225]. As is documented in Fig. 24, neither in ZnCr 2 S 4 nor in ZnCr 2 Se 4 , up to full fieldpolarization fractional magnetization plateaus were observed, but in both compounds, the magnetization rather increases continuously. In the selenide, the field-polarized phase is already established in external fields well below 10 T, while in the sulphide the field-polarized phase is reached beyond 40 T [174]. Compared to the chromium oxides, these spinel compounds are characterized by a strongly enhanced indirect FM exchange. In the zinc sulphide AFM and FM exchange are of equal strength, resulting in an almost zero CW temperature. In zinc selenide the FM exchange dominates and the CW temperature is of order 100 K (see Table 1). In the latter, the strong FM exchange is mirrored by the low saturation field of 10 T. It is obvious that the spin-JT mechanism, which releases frustration in the chromium oxides, is not active in the AFM sulphide and selenide. In these compounds, frustration must be released by another mechanism depending on the strength of bond frustration.

        <p>Temperature and field-dependent sound-velocity measurements are highly sensitive to unravel possible structural deformations occurring at magnetic transition either as function of temperature or magnetic field. From magnetic susceptibility, thermal-expansion and heat-capacity experiments, it is well known that in ZnCr 2 S 4 two subsequent magnetic transitions appear close to 15 and 8 K [177]. The temperature dependence of the longitudinal sound velocity as observed in experiments in a single crystal along the [1] direction, which in cubic crystals is determined by the elastic constant c 11 , is documented in Fig. 25. In zero external magnetic field and on decreasing temperatures, the sound velocity undergoes strong softening when approaching the AFM phase transition and reveals a narrow dip-like minimum at T N1 , accompanied by a spike-like maximum in the sound attenuation. On further decreasing temperatures, the sound velocity passes through a broad minimum close to 10 K and increases again on further cooling. The second AFM transition at T N2 is hardly visible in the temperature dependence of the sound velocity, but is indicated by a broad maximum in the temperature dependent damping. On increasing fields, both AFM transitions are slightly shifted to © 2011 by the American Physical Society. lower temperatures and the minimal sound velocity between the two phase transitions becomes less significant, but the damping strongly increases.

Remarkably, at 10 K plateaus develop in the field dependence of the sound velocity indicating crystallographic structures with constant stiffness, while the continuous increase of magnetization [Fig. 26(c)] signals that these structural changes are not accompanied by significant changes in the spin structure.

        <p>In A-site spinels only the A site of the spinel lattice is occupied by magnetic ions, while non-magnetic ions are located at the B site. Over the years, there were not too many investigations on A-site spinels due to the fact that A-A exchange interactions were expected to be rather weak due to an indirect exchange path through three intermediate ions resulting in low magnetic ordering temperatures. An illustrative example of A-A magnetic exchange paths in AB 2 O 4 spinels is given in Fig. 27 [228]. First interest in this class of materials arose because an unexpectedly high AFM ordering temperature of T N = 40 K was found in Co 3 O 4 [228]. In this normal spinel compound Co 2+ ions (d 7 ) are located at the tetrahedral A site and carry a spin S = 3/2. The Co 3+ ions (d 6 ) occupy the octahedral B sites and have zero magnetic moment as a consequence of the large splitting of the 3d levels by the octahedral crystal field and a resulting low-spin configuration.In A-site spinels only the A site of the spinel lattice is occupied by magnetic ions, while non-magnetic ions are located at the B site.

In these studies, the problem of possible inversion was avoided, by synthesizing the samples at the lowest possible temperatures, which still guaranteed reasonable diffusion rates and in addition, all samples were ultra-slowly cooled to room temperature [62]. The magnetic susceptibility measurements as reported by Tristan et al. [62] are shown in Fig. 28. These measurements were taken between 1.8 and 400 K in external magnetic fields of 1 T. The high-temperature susceptibilities were fitted by a CW behaviour and the resulting fit parameters, namely CW temperatures Θ, PM moments p eff , and resulting g values are given in Table 2. The g value for the manganese compound is close to the value expected for a spin-only compound with a half-filled shell. The g values of the iron and cobalt compound are significantly larger than 2. This enhancement can be understood by a residual SOC, as expected for magnetic ions with a more than half-filled shell. From the susceptibilities alone, it would be rather uncertain to determine the magnetic ordering temperatures. Hence Tristan et al. [62] performed additional magnetization, FC and ZFC experiments, as well as ESR experiments to determine the exact ordering temperatures and the nature of the magnetic phase transitions. From this analysis, it was concluded that the manganese compound undergoes AFM order close to 40 K, while iron and cobalt compounds reveal spin-glass freezing close to 5 and 12 K, respectively.Later on detailed magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity experiments [62], as well as neutron scattering experiments [230] were performed on the aluminium-oxide spinels.

        <p>After the prediction of a spin-spiral liquid state in A-site spinels by Bergman et al. [22], which will be discussed in more detail in the next section, the ground states of pure and doped CoAl 2 O 4 gained considerable attention and were re-investigated by various experimental methods including, magnetic, thermodynamic, ESR, X-ray diffraction, as well as by detailed quasi-elastic and inelastic neutron-scattering techniques [233][234][235][236][237][238]. These experiments on the pure cobaltoxide spinel were supplemented by systematic experiments on the mixed spinel compounds Co(Co 1-x Al x ) 2 O 4 [234,235], as well as by Monte Carlo simulations [235]. While all the different experimental investigations generally agreed on some type of disordered ground state, the true microscopic nature still is under debate. The latest proposal is that at the freezing temperature, AFM correlations become arrested and the low-temperature scattering contributions can be explained assuming the freezing of domain-wall motions preventing the formation of true long-range AFM order [238].After the prediction of a spin-spiral liquid state in A-site spinels by Bergman et al. [22], which will be discussed in more detail in the next section, the ground states of pure and doped CoAl 2 O 4 gained considerable attention and were re-investigated by various experimental methods including, magnetic, thermodynamic, ESR, X-ray diffraction, as well as by detailed quasi-elastic and inelastic neutron-scattering techniques [233][234][235][236][237][238].

        <p>The research on A-site spinels was heavily intensified by the report of Fritsch et al. [40] documenting strong spin frustration effects in MnSc 2 S 4 and FeSc 2 S 4 . In a series of subsequent magnetization and heat capacity measurements [239], as well as NMR [240] and neutron scattering experiments [241] it was documented that both compounds reveal strong frustration parameters: The manganese compound has a CW temperature close to 20 K and reveals complex magnetic order below 2 K. The iron compound is characterized by a CW temperature of 50 K, revealing no long-range magnetic order down to the mK regime. In addition, Fe 2+ with a d 6 electronic configuration is tetrahedrally coordinated by sulphur S 2-ions and reveals a twofold orbital degeneracy (see Fig. 6). Consequently, a JT transition leading to long-range OO is expected at low temperatures, which, however, is not observed. In FeSc 2 S 4 , in addition to the spin degrees of freedom, also the orbital degrees of freedom seem to be frustrated and this iron-spinel compound belongs to the rare class of materials with a SOL state persisting down to the lowest temperatures. Fig. 30 shows the inverse magnetic susceptibilities for the manganese and the iron compounds. Both susceptibilities reveal almost ideal CW behaviour at elevated temperatures. At the lowest temperatures, slight deviations appear in MnSc 2 S 4 with a clear fingerprint of subsequent AFM ordering transitions at 2.3 and 1.8 K (see lower inset of Fig. 30). No indication of a magnetic or structural phase transition can be identified in FeSc 2 S 4 and the close agreement of ZFC and FC measurements document the absence of any spin-glass like freezing process (upper inset of Fig. 30).The research on A-site spinels was heavily intensified by the report of Fritsch et al.

        <p>The results of the corresponding heat-capacity experiments on both compounds are shown in double-logarithmic representation in Fig. 31, together with measurements of the non-magnetic reference compound CdIn 2 S 4 . In the two magnetic compounds, phonon contributions govern the heat capacity above 10 K, while below this temperature spin and orbital contributions dominate. In the manganese compound, a double-peak structure close to 2 K indicates two subsequent magnetic transitions. A broad hump in the iron compound probably results from the orbital degrees of freedom [40]. There is no evidence for any type of phase transition down to 50 mK. In this respect these two scandiumbased A-site spinels are prototypical examples of strongly frustrated magnets with frustration parameters of f &gt; 10 for the manganese compound and at least larger than 1000 for the iron compound.The results of the corresponding heat-capacity experiments on both compounds are shown in double-logarithmic representation in Fig. 31, together with measurements of the non-magnetic reference compound CdIn 2 S 4 .

        <p>Subsequently, the magnetic structure and the excitation spectrum of the AFM state of MnSc 2 S 4 have been determined by elastic neutron-scattering experiments by Krimmel et al. [242]. The spiral spin structure formed at low temperatures is shown in Fig. 32. The magnetic structure found at T = 1.5 K is a spiral within the ab plane characterized by a propagation vector of q = (3/4,3/4,0). The temperature dependence of the magnetization roughly follows mean-field behaviour with a saturation value close to 5 µ B as expected for a half-filled d shell. A slight anomaly in the temperature dependence of the magnetization shows up close to 1.8 K indicating a second magnetic phase transition in good agreement with the heat-capacity experiments [242].Subsequently, the magnetic structure and the excitation spectrum of the AFM state of MnSc 2 S 4 have been determined by elastic neutron-scattering experiments by Krimmel et al.

        <p>Quasielastic and inelastic neutron scattering experiments were also performed in polycrystalline FeSc 2 S 4 [241]. The most fascinating results showing the evolution of the dynamic structure factor as function of temperature are documented in Fig. 33 and show strong dispersion effects of the magnetic excitation spectrum with strong softening on cooling. At the lowest temperature of this investigation, the magnon response has almost completely softened at the zone boundary with a very small excitation gap of order 0.2 meV at the lowest temperatures. In the colour-coded contour plot of Fig. 33 this softening is revealed by the extended intensity minima appearing close to the hypothetical AFM wave vectors (lower frame of Fig. 33). These intensity minima indeed correspond to strongly dispersing magnon-like modes around the AFM Bragg points, as has been documented by constant-energy scans in [241]. At 80 K, again at the zone boundary of the high-temperature PM phase, corresponding to the AFM ordering wave vector, considerable spin fluctuations show up, characteristic for an antiferromagnet just beyond the onset of magnetic order (upper frame of Fig. 33). At the lowest temperatures, well below the modulus of the CW temperature, soft excitations dominate the spectrum, which clearly indicate that FeSc 2 S 4 is very close to magnetic and, in addition close to OO. Indeed, subsequent detailed theoretical work of Balents and coworkers [243,244] documented that the iron compound is close to quantum criticality and that a critical spin-orbital spectrum, like that documented in Fig. 33 evolves close to the hypothetical AFM ordering wave vector.Quasielastic and inelastic neutron scattering experiments were also performed in polycrystalline FeSc 2 S 4 [241].

        <p>Interestingly, it has been suggested that the SOL state in FeSc 2 S 4 does not result from frustration, but is the consequence of a strong competition between the local and on-site SOC, and intersite spin-orbital exchange [243,244]. SOC is responsible for splitting of the electronic states, while spin-orbital exchange is the reason for significant dispersion effects. While spin and orbital exchange, both favour long-range ordered ground states, strong SOC can result in a SOL. A schematic (x, T ) phase diagram as taken from Mittelstädt et al. [245] is plotted in Fig. 34. Here the control parameter x represents the ratio of magnetic exchange J to the effective spin-orbit interaction λ [243,244]. In this phase diagram, a quantum-critical region separates the disordered ground state, the SOL or spin-orbital singlet (SOS) from the ground state with long-range AFM and concomitant OO. In Fig. 34 diagram. Here it is proposed that this iron-scandium-sulphide spinel exhibits a SOL ground state, with neither magnetic nor orbital long-range order.Interestingly, it has been suggested that the SOL state in FeSc 2 S 4 does not result from frustration, but is the consequence of a strong competition between the local and on-site SOC, and intersite spin-orbital exchange [243,244].

Considering the d 6 electron configuration of this ion, Hund's-rule coupling and assuming a high-spin configuration leads to a spin S = 2 system with a hole in the ground-state doublet. This CEF configuration is JT active and OO is expected at low temperatures, which however, experimentally is not observed in FeSc 2 S 4 . Consequently, the orbital doublet is split by second-order spin-orbit interaction into five equally spaced levels separated by λ = 6λ 2 0 /∆, where ∆ is the crystalfield splitting and λ o is the atomic SOC constant.

        <p>The experimental excitations of FeSc 2 S 4 documented in Fig. 33 reveal strong dispersion effects of the entangled spin and orbital degrees of freedom. For comparison of the neutron-scattering results with model calculations of these spin-orbital entangled excitations, which were measured on polycrystalline samples, the imaginary part of the angular-averaged spin susceptibility was calculated in zero external magnetic field [244]. The results are shown in Fig. 35. The excitation minima near wave vectors k = 2π /a and 5π /a agree well with the inelastic neutron-scattering data [241] and can directly be compared with the contour plots derived from these neutron-scattering experiments that are documented in Fig. 33. From these findings, it was concluded that FeSc 2 S 4 is close to the quantum critical point, but still in the SOS phase as shown in Fig. 34. It is interesting to note that theoretically no magnetic field-induced transition to an ordered state was found or predicted [244]. Indeed, NMR experiments in magnetic fields up to 8.5 T showed no signs of magnetic ordering [240], but still indicated a PM and orbitally disordered low-temperature phase.The experimental excitations of FeSc 2 S 4 documented in Fig. 33 reveal strong dispersion effects of the entangled spin and orbital degrees of freedom.

        <p>To investigate the microscopic nature of the spin-orbital coupled ground state in FeSc 2 S 4 , detailed THz spectroscopic studies were performed [245,246]. As documented in Figs. 33 and35 and as outlined in the crystal-field scenario above, a strongly wave-vector dependent singlet-triplet excitation is expected. This propagating mode is almost zero at the AFM zone boundary and strongly enhanced at the zone centre. A zone-centre value of 1.9 λ can be deduced from Fig. 35, was calculated in Ref. [244], and should be observable by THz spectroscopy. Indeed a well-defined excitation has been identified in THz experiments [245,246] close to 35 cm -1 corresponding to ∼4.5 meV. Its triplet character has been demonstrated by field-dependent experiments documenting a clear splitting of this mode [246]. Its temperature dependence has been studied in detail by Mittelstädt et al. [245] and is shown in Fig. 36. Here the temperature dependent dielectric loss is shown as determined in THz transmission experiments on polycrystalline FeSc 2 S 4 samples. A well-defined excitation close to 35 cm -1 evolves from a continuously increasing background at low temperatures. In Ref. [245] this excitation of strongly entangled spin and orbital degrees of freedom was called spin-orbiton.

        <p>The A-site spinels gained further attention by the theoretical prediction of a possible spin-spiral liquid state in A-site spinels [22,247]. It was argued that the formation of a spiral spin liquid strongly depends on the ratio of the strengths of the intra J 1 and inter-site interactions J 2 of the bipartite diamond lattice. Exchange ratios J 2 /J 1 &gt; 1/8 result in a spin-liquid state, in which the ground state is an enormously degenerate set of coplanar spin spirals with propagation wave vectors lying on a two-dimensional surface in momentum space [22]. From this modelling, it seemed that MnSc 2 S 4 should be the prime candidate to observe this exotic spin-liquid state. The authors of Ref. [22] predicted that the spiral propagation vectors form a unique spiral surface of strong spin fluctuations in momentum space, which they proposed could be observed by neutron-scattering experiments. However, at the time of this theoretical prediction, single crystals of appropriate size © 2015 by the American Physical Society. and quality to perform inelastic and quasielastic neutron-scattering experiments were not available. After 10 years of hard work it was possible to grow single crystals, large enough to perform quasi-elastic neutron scattering [248] and neutron-scattering experiments have been performed at the Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum in Munich, as well as at the spallation neutron source SINQ of the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen (CH) [28]. One main result of this work is shown in Fig. 37: Here the experimental neutron scattering results are compared to the theoretical predictions. Fig. 37(a) shows the two interpenetrating fcc lattices of the diamond lattice with the intra-exchange J 1 and the inter-exchange J 2, within one and in between the two sublattices. Very recently, by combining neutron-scattering measurements with extensive Monte Carlo simulations, it was demonstrated that at low temperatures (&lt;1 K) and at moderate external magnetic fields ranging from approximately 4-6 T, a fractional antiferromagnetic skyrmion lattice is stabilized in MnSc 2 S 4 . This very rare and incipient meron (half skyrmion) structure is stabilized through anisotropic couplings and is composed of three antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices, with each sublattice showing a triangular skyrmion lattice that is fractionalized into two parts with an incipient meron character [249].The A-site spinels gained further attention by the theoretical prediction of a possible spin-spiral liquid state in A-site spinels [22,247].

        <p>The use of FM metals even in laminated form as high-permeability magnet-core materials is restricted to rather low frequencies because of eddy-current losses. The ideal core material is an insulating ferromagnet (or ferrimagnet) with high permeability and such low conductivity that eddy-current loss can be completely ignored. After Snoek's proposal [250,251] to use semiconducting spinel ferrites, which have been developed in the Philips Research Laboratories over the years (see e.g., Verwey and Heilman [5], Polder [252]), as high-permeability core materials, there has been a tremendous increase on research activities on their magnetic properties as outlined in the preceding chapters of this review. The resistivity of the majority of this class of materials was sufficiently high to neglect eddy-current losses in inductance applications and, hence, resistance or dielectric impedance experiments were seemingly unnecessary and rare. However, the increasing interest in microwave applications of ferrites stimulated careful dielectric characterization yielding rather astonishing and unexpected results with the observation of unusually large dielectric constants at low frequencies, finally promoting speculations about the existence of local dipolar moments in spinels.The use of FM metals even in laminated form as high-permeability magnet-core materials is restricted to rather low frequencies because of eddy-current losses.

        <p>More than 80 years ago, Blechschmidt [253] found an anomalous enhancement of the dielectric constants towards low frequencies in certain manganese ferrites. Comparing these results with similar measurements in inhomogeneous graphite-paraffin or copper-paraffin mixtures, he concluded that the manganese ferrites under investigation are inhomogeneous compounds consisting of metallic and insolating regions. More than a decade later, in the early fifties, large dielectric constants were measured in manganese-zinc ferrites by Brockman et al. [254], in nickel-zinc ferrites by Koops [255], in copper-zinc ferrites by Möltgen [256], and in nickel and cobalt ferrites by Kamiyoshi [257]. These authors proposed that the strong frequency dependence of the dielectric constants reaching large or even colossal values at low frequencies can be explained assuming an inhomogeneous dielectric structure as discussed by Maxwell [258] and Wagner [259]. A simple model of grains of conducting material separated by poorly conducting sheets was able to explain some of the results [255] and the assumption of an electronic circuit consisting of a resistance and a capacitance in parallel, provided a qualitative understanding of the reported dispersion effects. Later on the dielectric properties of a variety of ferrites were summarized and analysed in detail by van Uitert [260] and by Fairweather et al. [261]. Finally, Peters and Standley [262] performed broadband dielectric experiments on magnesium-manganese ferrites ranging from 100 Hz to 100 MHz and again found significant dispersion effects and dielectric constants strongly increasing towards decreasing frequencies. These authors questioned the previous analysis given in terms of an inhomogeneous material with conducting and insulating particles and, for the first time, speculated about the existence of intrinsic relaxation phenomena of permanent dipole moments. A critical discussion of dielectric measurements in semiconducting materials and relaxation spectra as observed in transition-metal compounds can be found by Miles et al. [263]. The experimentally observed behaviour was described as being typical for conducting materials through which the free flow of current is impeded, for example, by grain boundaries and barrier layers. They showed that the dispersion caused by a Maxwell-Wagner type double layer is identical with that of a dipolar relaxation. In the late fifties, this debate about the existence and the origin of large dielectric constants in semiconducting spinels faded away without a final answer and apparently became forgotten. This discussion about large dielectric constants and possible intrinsic dipolar relaxations in spinel compounds was revived in the early seventies when speculations about possible off-centre positions of chromium ions in some oxide and sulphide spinels came up.More than 80 years ago, Blechschmidt [253] found an anomalous enhancement of the dielectric constants towards low frequencies in certain manganese ferrites.

        <p>As a side remark, it is worth mentioning that in the first decade of the 21 stt century this debate on colossal dielectric constants (CDCs) suddenly became revived by the observation of CDCs in perovskite-derived transition metal oxides [264]. Large dielectric constants of order 10 6 were observed in CaCu 3 Ti 4 O 12 in a broad range of frequencies and temperatures, with Arrhenius-type relaxation dynamics on decreasing temperatures. The temperature and frequency dependencies of the complex dielectric response were interpreted in terms of a relaxor-like dynamical slowing down of dipolar fluctuations of nanosize domains [264]. In subsequent work, structural and electronic properties of CaCu 3 Ti 4 O 12 were calculated using density-functional theory within the local spin-density approximation. No direct evidence was found for intrinsic lattice or electronic mechanisms rationalizing this polar behaviour, a result rather pointing towards an extrinsic effect of the observation of CDCs [265]. Indeed, in further detailed dielectric experiments on this compound [266,267] it was proven that the CDCs and the concomitant relaxation phenomena can be explained by Maxwell-Wagner type phenomena due to internal or external barrier-layer capacitors, i.e., due to grain boundaries or surface-layer effects at the electrodes. In addition, it was documented that this finding of CDCs is quite common in semiconducting transition-metal oxides [268]. Nevertheless, this early work on CDCs stimulated enormous research activities, which were reviewed, e.g. by Lunkenheimer et al. [269].As a side remark, it is worth mentioning that in the first decade of the 21 stt century this debate on colossal dielectric constants (CDCs) suddenly became revived by the observation of CDCs in perovskite-derived transition metal oxides [264]. Large dielectric constants of order 10 6 were observed in CaCu 3 Ti 4 O 12 in a broad range of frequencies and temperatures, with Arrhenius-type relaxation dynamics on decreasing temperatures. The temperature and frequency dependencies of the complex dielectric response were interpreted in terms of a relaxor-like dynamical slowing down of dipolar fluctuations of nanosize domains [264].

        <p>The observation of CDCs and their possible origin in local dipolar moments in spinel compounds in principle can be viewed as precursor phenomena of possible polar order in spinel compounds. The true story about ferroelectricity in spinels started with early ESR [270] and optical spectroscopy investigations [271] of chromium-doped MgAl 2 O 4 . In this material, the chromium ions (Cr 3+ , 3d 3 ) substitute aluminium at the B site of the normal spinel structure and are embedded in a regular octahedron of oxygen ions. Hence the three electrons of the chromium d shell occupy the three t 2g levels of the electronic ground state (see Fig. 6) and constitute a spin-only value of S = 3/2 with negligible SOC. The octahedral site symmetry for an ideally cubic spinel is D 3d , which indeed was identified in the low impurity limit. However, for chromium concentrations &gt; 2 %, both sets of data, ESR as well as optical results, were consistently explained by significant trigonal distortions of the local crystal field along the crystallographic [112] direction [270,271]. Later on, performing detailed structural and optical investigations in the mixed molecular compounds MgCr x Al 2-x O 4 Grimes and coworkers [272][273][274] substantiated these findings of a locally distorted C 3v symmetry at the chromium site. It was concluded that the chromium ions in this series of alloys behave like JT ions, despite the fact that chromium has a half-filled shell, characterized by zero or small SOC and no JT activity. Grimes and Collett [274] documented that the infrared spectra exhibit increasing complexity with increasing chromium concentration and that the IR spectra in accordance with the structural data can be satisfactorily explained assuming local distortions with C 3v symmetry at the chromium site. It was concluded that the over-all cubic symmetry of the spinel structure and its optical isotropy are the consequence of a statistical distribution of local trigonal distortions along all symmetry-equivalent &lt;111&gt; directions. This observation together with an increasing number of experimental evidence led Grimes [275] finally to the conclusion that the spinel compound MgCr 2 O 4 is not satisfactorily described by the space group Fd3m, but most likely exhibits the space group F 43m. It was further documented that the displacements from conventional positions of the cubic spinel structure cannot be larger than 0.10 Å and it was stated that the microscopic origin of this trigonal distortion remains to be settled. Finally, the claim that a large number of spinel compounds contrary to conventional description cannot be referred to as space group Fd3m, was further substantiated by a detailed analysis of the Debye-Waller factors of a large number of spinel compounds [276], including a number of ferrites, cobaltates and chromates, with ZnCr 2 O 4 and MgCr 2 O 4 being the most prominent examples. These found significant deviations from cubic symmetry, the observation of a possible noncentrosymmetric space group together with anomalous dielectric results discussed above, led Grimes finally to conclude about a polar, specifically antiferroelectric ground state in some spinel compounds [277]. This idea of a space group F 43m with no inversion centre in some spinel compounds was further elaborated by Schmid and Ascher [278]. The occurrence of off-centre chromium was rationalized by electrostatic potential considerations in semiconducting spinel compounds. Hence, it seemed important to check the symmetries in metallic spinel compounds, where metallic electrical conductivity might help to retain the high cubic symmetry. Williams and Grimes [279] published a detailed X-ray diffraction study of the metallic thiospinels CuCr 2 S 4 and CuCo 2 S 4 and indeed found that the space group Fd3m describes the structure of these metallic compounds satisfactorily.The observation of CDCs and their possible origin in local dipolar moments in spinel compounds in principle can be viewed as precursor phenomena of possible polar order in spinel compounds.

        <p>This final proposal about a polar ground state of some insulating or semiconducting spinel oxides started a longstanding dispute with a large number of pros and cons, which, to our knowledge, up to now, has not been settled satisfactorily and will be shortly summarized below. We would like to recall, that as outlined in Section 3.4.1B, various chromium oxide spinels are strongly frustrated magnets and, according to recent wisdom, undergo a spin-driven JT effect, with a structural distortion concomitantly with magnetic ordering. However, these effects arise at low temperatures in the magnetically ordered state. As outlined above, many of the chromite spinels instead reveal this so-called JT activity already at high temperatures, far above the onset of magnetic order, a fact that has been widely overlooked in the recent literature and has neither been discussed nor was taken into consideration in all theoretical models dealing with the spin-JT effect. In what follows, we shortly summarize the controversy on the assignment of the correct space group in spinel compounds: The controversy mainly referred to the observation of ''forbidden'' reflections in diffraction experiments and the question whether their occurrence is simply due to multiple-scattering events or is a hallmark for lower symmetry without inversion centre. Utilizing neutron-diffraction experiments on Fe 3 O 4 and on MgAl 2 O 4 , Samuelson [280] and Samuelson and Steinsvoll [281,282] could not observe intrinsic {200} reflections indicative for space group F 43m and they concluded that the loss of inversion symmetry must be based on other evidence than the presence of these forbidden reflections. This conclusion was confirmed by Smith [283], performing electron-diffraction experiments on a natural spinel of composition Mg 0.85 Fe 0.15 Al 2 O 4 and by Tokonami and Horiuchi [284] as well as De Cooman and Carter [285] again with electron diffraction on MgAl 2 O 4 . These conclusions concerning the space group Fd3m derived from diffraction experiments were further confirmed by electron-nuclear double-resonance experiments on Cr 3+ in natural MgAl 2 O 4 [286]. The observation of intrinsic ''forbidden'' reflections, which were not explained by double or multiple diffraction processes were reported utilizing electron diffraction [287][288][289][290] as well as X-ray diffraction techniques [291]. Results from latticeenergy calculations [292] also supported the loss of inversion symmetry and F 43m being the appropriate symmetry for MgAl 2 O 4 . From our point of view, this dispute about the true symmetry of some of the spinel compounds was never finally settled. Over the years there were a number of experimental observations, which will be detailed and mentioned below, indicative for some structural effects in a variety of spinels, like off-centre chromium ions, which appear at elevated temperatures in the ∼150 K range and could be interpreted in terms of a loss of inversion symmetry.This final proposal about a polar ground state of some insulating or semiconducting spinel oxides started a longstanding dispute with a large number of pros and cons, which, to our knowledge, up to now, has not been settled satisfactorily and will be shortly summarized below.

        <p>The possibility of the existence of a linear coupling of electric and magnetic fields for substances with certain types of magnetic crystal symmetry was known since Landau and Lifshitz. Antiferromagnetic Cr 2 O 3 was the first material, which was predicted [293] and has been proven to show this linear ME effect [294]. In a ME material with linear coupling, the magnetization depends on the external electric field and the polarization on the external magnetic field. The cross coupling between the magnetic and electric order parameters provides an additional degree of freedom, which seems promising to design future electronic devices. ME materials are limited by symmetry requirements, where spatial inversion as well as time reversal symmetry need to be broken simultaneously. A linear ME effect can exist in materials without spontaneous electric polarization as observed in AFM Cr 2 O 3 and were routinely reported in MF materials with concomitant magnetic and polar order. In recent years a number of A-site spinels, including Co 3 O 4 , MnAl 2 O 4 , MnGa 2 O 4 [295], and CoAl 2 O 4 [296] were recorded. In the latter compound, the authors documented that the linear ME effect depends on the A-site disorder and becomes suppressed with increasing disorder. This fact supports the conclusion that CoAl 2 O 4 with low site disorder exhibits a long-range ordered AFM state at low temperatures [296].

        <p>The attempts to synthesize a material exhibiting both, magnetic and polar order (as homogeneous bulk samples or as heterogeneous ceramics) started in the 1960s, mainly by the groups of Smolenskii [297] and Venevtsev [298,299] in the former Soviet Union. Materials combining these different ferroic properties were later on called multiferroics. It was argued that in these MF materials the cross coupling of magnetization to electric fields and of polarization to magnetic fields would be strongly enhanced allowing incorporation into practical devices providing novel device paradigms for future technological applications. After these early attempts and being quite silent for many years, in the first decade of the 21st century the research on multiferroics was highly accelerated by a revived discussion on novel materials. It started with the observation of a relatively strict exclusion principle of magnetic and ferroelectric (FE) order, mainly focusing on the broad class of perovskites: In this class of compounds the canonical ferroelectrics, e.g., BaTiO 3 , are characterized by a d 0 -ness, while magnets, like e.g. LaMnO 3 , are found in systems with incompletely filled d shells. These facts were summarized and elaborated in an illuminating article by Hill [300]. In addition and shortly after, spindriven ferroelectricity was found in TbMnO 3 [301] where the onset of spin-spiral order destroys inversion symmetry and allows for FE polarization in the magnetically ordered phase. Ferroelectricity at the onset of spin-spiral order theoretically was explained in terms of a spin-current mechanism [302] or by an inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (iDM) interaction [303,304].

As outlined above, this chromium selenide undergoes spiral spin ordering below 21 K (see Table 1). The IC spin helix propagates along one of the cube axes with the plane of rotation of the spins perpendicular to the propagation vector and, hence, in zero external magnetic field will be non-polar. The screw spin structure with a unique propagation vector has still two domains with clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation of the spins. Utilizing neutron-diffraction techniques, Siratori et al.

Later on Siratori and Kita [314] measured the temperature and the magnetic-field dependence of the ME coupling. An external magnetic field will induce a conical spin structure and, in addition, can tilt the cone axis away from the propagation vector.

        <p>We have already discussed earlier that the chromium-oxide spinels MnCr 2 O 4 and CoCr 2 O 4 crystallize in the normal spinel structure with values of the effective exchange parameter u, which according to the LKDM theory are in the locally unstable region (see Fig. 8). These compounds undergo a FiM-type of spin-spiral ordering, where the magnetic moments of the ions at the A and the B site form FM conical spirals, with their longitudinal FM moments pointing opposite to each other [103]. The polar ground state and multiferroicity was investigated in detail by Yamasaki et al. [316] in CoCr 2 O 4 . This compound reveals a FiM transition at 93 K and on further cooling undergoes a transition into cycloidal spin states at 26 K, where both spirals evolve into longitudinal conical structures with opposite spin directions as described above. This means that the ground state exhibits a uniform spontaneous magnetization (like in conventional ferrimagnets) plus a transverse spin-spiral component. The IC propagation of the spirals is along the crystallographic [111] direction, while the basal plane of the spin rotation is in one of the cube planes, perpendicular to [1]. Hence, according to the vector rules of the iDM interaction there should appear spin-driven FE polarization along [110]. At the transition to the conical spin-spiral state at 26 K this polarization indeed was observed [316]. In addition, due to the existence of a spontaneous FM magnetization due to FiM order of the longitudinal spin components it was possible to reverse the polarization by the reversal of rather small external magnetic fields of order 0.1 T.We have already discussed earlier that the chromium-oxide spinels MnCr 2 O 4 and CoCr 2 O 4 crystallize in the normal spinel structure with values of the effective exchange parameter u, which according to the LKDM theory are in the locally unstable region (see Fig. 8).

It reveals the characteristic magnetic susceptibility of a low-dimensional spin system and, due to weak inter-chain couplings, below ∼2.5 K exhibits three-dimensional long-range magnetic order. At this phase transition, a cycloidal spin order is established, with a propagation vector of the spiral along b and with the spin-rotation plane within the a,b plane, with the normal vector e parallel to the crystallographic c direction. Hence, according to the symmetry rules of spiral magnets, polar order is expected with FE polarization P aligned along the a direction.The magnetism of LiCuVO 4 is well characterized by magnetic susceptibility [317,318], NMR [319][320][321], ESR [318,319] and neutron scattering techniques [322].

        <p>In subsequent dielectric experiments this polar order indeed was observed [323][324][325]. Fig. 38 shows the temperature dependence of the real [Fig. 38(a)] and the imaginary part [Fig. 38(b)] of the dielectric constant at a series of frequencies between 320 Hz and 10 kHz below 10 K. At about 2.5 K, the real part of the dielectric constant shows a λ-like anomaly and a concomitant loss peak with very little frequency dependence. The absolute values of dielectric constant and of the loss close to the peak maxima are relatively low and do not indicate any kind of dipolar criticality, as would be observed in ferroelectrics driven by soft phonon modes or in order-disorder FE phase transitions. These small and frequencyindependent anomalies, without any precursor phenomena like dipolar fluctuations in the paraelectric (PE) phase, are characteristic for an incipient FE, where polar order is not the primary order parameter, but driven and induced by another ordering phenomenon, here the onset of spin order. The inset of Fig. 38(a) shows the temperature dependence of the FE polarization, which evolves along the crystallographic a direction as expected by applying the symmetry rules of the iDM interaction. To probe FE order, the pyro-current was integrated to determine the temperature dependence of the spontaneous polarization [323].In subsequent dielectric experiments this polar order indeed was observed [323][324][325].

        <p>In a series of detailed dielectric experiments as function of temperature and external magnetic field, as well as in a series of pyro-current and magneto-current experiments [323] a complex (H,T )-phase diagram of LiCuVO 4 was established, which is shown in Fig. 39. At low magnetic fields (H &lt; 2 T), as long as the anisotropy of the system dominates the spin structure, the basal plane of spin helix always lies within the ab plane (e ∥ c). As soon as the external magnetic field overcomes the magnetic anisotropy of the system, in fields approximately above 2 T, the basal plane of the spin helix follows the external magnetic field. In Ref. [323] the authors were able to document that the polar order can be switched by switching the external magnetic field with a concomitant switching of the FE polarization. Hence, when the spin helix follows the external magnetic field, also the polarization becomes switched following the vector rules of the iDM interaction. Overall, the findings in this system provide a nice confirmation of the theoretically predicted symmetry relations for spin-driven FE in spiral magnets. Finally, above 8 T the spin system undergoes a modulated collinear ordering with no induced spin-driven polarization, and the title compound remains PE down to the lowest temperatures.In a series of detailed dielectric experiments as function of temperature and external magnetic field, as well as in a series of pyro-current and magneto-current experiments [323] a complex (H,T )-phase diagram of LiCuVO 4 was established, which is shown in Fig. 39.

        <p>In this chapter, we will discuss MF behaviour of spinel compounds, which cannot be straightforwardly explained by a canonical spin-driven mechanism, i.e. by an iDM effect. Instead, probably different routes to polar order have to be taken into account, like charge-and/or orbital-ordering phenomena. However, other spin-driven mechanisms, like exchangestriction, also could play a role and in many cases the true driving force for polar order is not finally established. In this respect, the dipolar relaxation dynamics due to off-centring of chromium ions, have largely been overlooked and may play a more important role as a precursor phenomenon of a polar ground state, which becomes enhanced and activated via the onset of magnetic interactions or via charge ordering phenomena.In this chapter, we will discuss MF behaviour of spinel compounds, which cannot be straightforwardly explained by a canonical spin-driven mechanism, i.e. by an iDM effect.

        <p>Fe 3 O 4 , the most popular spinel ferrimagnet, undergoes FiM ordering close to 780 K and the Verwey transition [30], a complex type of MIT, close to 125 K [327]. Early on there were reports on ferroelectricity and large ME effects in © 2011 by the American Physical Society. magnetite: First observations of linear and bilinear ME effects observed in magnetically biased Fe 3 O 4 were published by Rado and Ferrari [328]. Subsequently, Kita et al. [329,330] reported measurements of FE hysteresis loops in magnetite at low temperatures, well below the Verwey transition. Finally the temperature dependence of the ME effect under applied strain was measured in [331,332] and in [333] it was shown that the ME polarizations can be successfully reversed by reversing the dc electric field, documenting that magnetite at low temperatures is a true and switchable FE. A detailed dielectric spectroscopy study below the charge-ordering Verwey transition, in a wide range of probing frequencies covering more than 10 decades of frequency, was reported by Schrettle et al. [326]. Their main result of the temperature dependence of the real part of the dielectric constant below the Verwey transition, for a series of measuring frequencies between mHz and GHz, is documented in Fig. 40. On cooling, for the higher frequencies ε'(T ) shows a single steplike decrease from the static dielectric constant ε s of the order of several thousands to its high-frequency limit ε ∞ ≈ 60. This feature shifts to lower temperatures with decreasing frequency. From the fact, that this step-like decrease strongly depends on the electrical contacts used for these experiments, it was concluded that the large or even CDCs of Fe 3 O 4 at elevated temperatures result from non-intrinsic Maxwell-Wagner like effects [326], as have been observed in a variety of semiconducting transition-metal oxides [268].Fe 3 O 4 , the most popular spinel ferrimagnet, undergoes FiM ordering close to 780 K and the Verwey transition [30], a complex type of MIT, close to 125 K [327].

        <p>For frequencies below about 100 kHz, a second relaxation-like phenomenon appears in the temperature dependence of ε'(T ) below 50 K, developing into a broad cusp-like maximum for the lowest frequencies. With decreasing frequency, the height of this peak increases, while shifting to lower temperatures. This is the typical behaviour of relaxor ferroelectrics, which are characterized by a diffusive polar phase transition and the freezing-in of short-range cluster-like FE order [63].For frequencies below about 100 kHz, a second relaxation-like phenomenon appears in the temperature dependence of ε'(T ) below 50 K, developing into a broad cusp-like maximum for the lowest frequencies.

        <p>In these relaxor-like materials, the dipolar degrees of freedom are believed to freeze-in with local but not long-range order, establishing a nano-or micro-domain polar phase at low temperatures. They usually show sizable polarization and switchable ferroelectricity. It was concluded that FiM magnetite has a polar ground state, however, with short-range FE order only. The temperature dependence of the peak maxima as documented in Fig. 40 follows a CW law with a critical ordering temperature, which is located at rather low temperatures. However, from Fig. 40 this critical temperature is very close to a possible divergence of the dipolar relaxation strength as outlined in [326] and as documented in Fig. 40. From this relaxor-like relaxation it is clear that polar hysteresis effects should be observable on macroscopic time scales below ∼30 K. Figs. 40 and 41 document that Fe 3 O 4 indeed is a MF with switchable magnetization and switchable polarization. However, sizable MF order sets in deep in the magnetically ordered phase and well below the Verwey transition. It seems clear that the onset of polar order is driven by charge-ordering phenomena. However, it still is unclear why macroscopic polarization appears far below the onset of charge order (CO), which definitely sets in at the Verwey transition. These results certainly may help to resolve the long-standing problem about the low-temperature crystal symmetry of magnetite: For cluster-like ferroelectricity, the inversion symmetry can be lost on a local scale, while on the average monoclinic symmetry can be retained [335]. These findings also could have important implications for the CO in magnetite: It's polar and charge degrees of freedom are intimately related and, thus, the CO should also be of shortrange type only. This fact seems to be even more plausible, having in mind that charge ordering happens on a strongly frustrated pyrochlore lattice. Anyway, charge ordering seems to be the driving force of ferroelectricity established in FiM Fe 3 O 4 and the model developed by Efremov et al. [336] to explain ferroelectricity in certain charge-ordered perovskites may well be appropriate for magnetite below its Verwey transition [307]. By means of first-principles simulations, it was unambiguously shown that improper ferroelectricity in magnetite is driven by charge-ordering phenomena and that the polarization arises because of charge disproportionation of electronic charges between octahedral Fe sites, leading to a non-centrosymmetric Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ charge-ordered pattern [337]. Finally, the complexity of this charge ordering transition was further elucidated by Attfield and coworkers in a series of fundamental contributions [327,338,339], which will be discussed later in this review in the chapter dealing with the MIT in spinel compounds. CdCr 2 S 4 : An astonishing and rather unexpected experimental result was the observation of polar order and FE polarization in FM CdCr 2 S 4 [32]. The most important findings elucidating its MF behaviour are documented in Fig. 42. CdCr 2 S 4 is dominated by FM exchange interactions, documented by a positive CW temperature of 155 K and exhibits long-range FM order below ∼85 K [see Fig. 42(a) and Table 1], with an ordered moment of 6 µ B per formula unit [see inset in Fig. 42(a)] as expected for two Cr 3+ ions per unit cell, that are octahedrally coordinated and have half-filled t 2g levels (see Fig. 6). FE polarization evolves in the magnetically ordered phase and practically follows the evolution of spontaneous FM magnetization, however, slightly shifted to lower temperatures [Fig. 42 The dielectric constant passes through a broad maximum well below the onset of FE ordering, a temperature evolution significantly different to what is expected in second-order displacive polar phase transitions, where a maximum dielectric constant is expected just at the ordering temperature. At 25 K, well below the MF ordering transition a FE polarization hysteresis was measured [Fig. 42(c)], supporting an interpretation in terms of macroscopic polar order.In these relaxor-like materials, the dipolar degrees of freedom are believed to freeze-in with local but not long-range order, establishing a nano-or micro-domain polar phase at low temperatures.

        <p>Despite the fact that the polar order detected in CdCr 2 S 4 obviously appears below the onset of FM order and in this sense certainly has the characteristics of a spin-driven ferroelectricity, from the very beginning it was clear that a conventional spin-driven mechanism via an iDM interaction as outlined above can be excluded and one has rather to think of polar order driven by an exchange-striction mechanism. However, CdCr 2 S 4 belongs to the broad class of spinel compounds, which seem to be prone to polar order already at much higher temperatures, most probably driven by an off-centre motion of the Cr ions in double-well potentials (see Section 3.4.1). For some of these sulphide and selenide spinels, it was argued that the relatively large radii of the A-site ions destabilize the cubic structure and support the tendency towards ionic off-centre displacements. Indeed, utilizing detailed X-ray diffraction experiments, for CdCr 2 S 4 and CdCr 2 Se 4 negative thermal expansion and an anomalous broadening of Bragg reflections was detected well above the magnetic ordering temperature, indicating the softening of the spinel structure of these compounds towards lower temperatures [340].Despite the fact that the polar order detected in CdCr 2 S 4 obviously appears below the onset of FM order and in this sense certainly has the characteristics of a spin-driven ferroelectricity, from the very beginning it was clear that a conventional spin-driven mechanism via an iDM interaction as outlined above can be excluded and one has rather to think of polar order driven by an exchange-striction mechanism.

        <p>Having these claims of possible polar order in spinel compounds in mind, magneto-capacitive effects in CdCr 2 S 4 were studied in detail already well above the onset of FM order [32,341]. The temperature and field-dependent dielectric constants are shown in Fig. 43 in a broad range of temperatures, magnetic fields and probing frequencies. Indeed, very unusual dipolar relaxations as function of temperature and magnetic fields were found, indicative for the existence of reorienting dipolar moments already at elevated temperatures. Starting below room temperature, a significant dipolar relaxation was observed, which appears as a broad hump-like peak in the real part [Fig. 43(a)] and as a symmetrically shaped maximum in the imaginary part of the dielectric constant [inset of Fig. 43(a)]. On cooling, these features reveal a strong increase and are shifted to lower temperatures. This observation was explained by a relaxor FE-type dielectric function with a characteristic temperature of 135 K, where the static dielectric constant would diverge in case thermodynamic equilibrium could be reached. Interestingly, this critical temperature is not too far from the onset of long-range magnetic order and it is clear that the dipolar relaxations become very slow and the sample should fall out of thermodynamic equilibrium at somewhat higher temperatures [the mean relaxation time is of the order of 0.1 s already at 151 K, see inset of Fig. 43(a)]. From these experiments [32,341] it was concluded that in CdCr 2 S 4 only short-range polar order in nano-or micro-domains can be established. However, it is evident that this dipolar relaxational behaviour is another fingerprint of a possible FE behaviour of spinel compounds as discussed earlier in this chapter and it seems obvious that short-range ordered dipolar moments are present already well above the onset of long-range magnetic order, an observation which certainly makes CdCr 2 S 4 an unconventional MF. As becomes obvious from Fig. 43 The relaxation dynamics of the dipolar entities in CdCr 2 S 4 was further detailed using broadband dielectric spectroscopy [341]. In this work, the authors provided strong evidence that the variation of the dielectric constant at the magnetic transition and the concomitant colossal magnetocapacitive effect are caused by a drastic speeding-up of the polar relaxation dynamics under the formation of FM spin order. Hence, the dipolar relaxations freeze-in already well above the onset of magnetic order, forming a relaxor-like polar state. However, with the onset of FM order the relaxation dynamic becomes significantly faster again allowing for a macroscopic growth of the micro-domains documented by the FE hysteresis experiments shown in Fig. 42(c). Stimulated by these results, in subsequent experimental work the magnetic field-dependent dielectric and magnetic properties in CdCr 2 S 4 were investigated by different groups [342][343][344]. Sun et al. [342] reported on the observation of a glassy polar state at the onset of FM order, followed by subsequent FE order close to 56 K, which is further enhanced by external electric fields. The authors explained these field dependent MF states by strong spin-lattice coupling and exchange-striction effects. In subsequent work, this group reported the observation of colossal magnetoresistance and colossal electroresistance effects, which are induced by external electric fields in CdCr 2 S 4 [343]. Utilizing local probe techniques, Oliveira et al. [344] established that the dynamic off-centring of the Cr 3+ ions play a key role in establishing a MF ground state in this material.Having these claims of possible polar order in spinel compounds in mind, magneto-capacitive effects in CdCr 2 S 4 were studied in detail already well above the onset of FM order [32,341].

We would like to recall that CdCr 2 S 4 , indium doped CdCr 2 S 4 and CdCr 2 Se 4 exhibit long-range ordered FM ground states. Only HgCr 2 S 4 exhibits a helical spin structure, however with the basal plane perpendicular to the propagation vector. In addition, very small fields switch the mercury compound into an induced FM state. We conclude that in these compounds the conventional iDM mechanism cannot induce polar order. It always was suspected that these spinel compounds are close to ferroelectricity due to relaxing off-centre chromium moments and that finally the onset FM spin order induces polar ground states. This obviously happens via a drastic acceleration of the relaxation dynamics with the onset of FM order, which appeared to be almost frozen-in at temperatures well above the magnetic phase transition.Similar observations of dipolar relaxations and large magnetocapacitive effects were also reported for FM CdCr 2 Se 4 [345], for HgCr 2 S 4 with helical spin order [152,192] and for FM indium doped CdCr 2 S 4 [152].

        <p>In this review, we do not want to dissimulate concerns about a possible extrinsic nature of the reported polar effects. These concerns were also triggered by reports that in polycrystalline samples these significant magneto-capacitive effects are very small or even missing [152]. From the very beginning, after observing these effects in CdCr 2 S 4 , the authors of Ref. [32,341] tried to prove the intrinsic nature of the reported effects and to provide experiments to exclude Maxwell-Wagner-like phenomena or that the reported anomalies stem from inhomogeneous samples. It is important to recall that these authors belonged to the first groups being aware of the importance of Maxwell-Wagner phenomena in transition-metal oxides [267,268]. In due course, they provided a variety of experimental results on differently synthesized samples, differently doped samples, and measurements with different electrical contacts and different contact geometries [57,152,345] to exclude extrinsic effects and finally concluded about the intrinsic character of the reported results in CdCr 2 S 4 . The first criticism was raised in a brief communication arising by Catalan and Scott [346] to the work of Hemberger et al. [32] and was answered and commented by Hemberger et al. [347]. This controversy finally stimulated a dispute about ferroelectrics going bananas, where Scott [348] stated that most of the work reported on FE hysteresis reported in literature concerning transition-metal oxides could equally well be measured in bananas. Responding to this note, Loidl et al. [349] provided measurements on a real banana skin documenting that when care is taken in the appropriate dielectric measurements the correct behaviour can be deduced.In this review, we do not want to dissimulate concerns about a possible extrinsic nature of the reported polar effects.

[349] provided measurements on a real banana skin documenting that when care is taken in the appropriate dielectric measurements the correct behaviour can be deduced.</p>
        <p>Subsequently the phonon properties of CdCr 2 S 4 were studied in full detail as function of temperature by IR [210] and Raman-scattering techniques [350], as well as by ab-initio calculations within frozen-phonon and Berry-phase techniques within the framework of LSDA+U [351]. The first-principle phonon calculations of the IR active phonons within the cubic spinel structure found that all phonons should be rather well behaved and cannot account for the large dielectric responses observed at lower frequencies, hence suggesting that the origin for the observed relaxor behaviour in CdCr 2 S 4 cannot result from a displacive polar soft mode. However, the experimental Raman and IR work identified the observation of new modes and significant anomalies in the temperature-dependent phonon properties. Anomalies in the temperature dependence of IR active phonon eigenfrequencies and damping, i.e. striking deviations from the conventional anharmonic behaviour, were reported by Rudolf et al. [210]. These anomalies appeared at temperatures ∼130 K, well above the onset of FM order, and appeared in a temperature regime where anomalous thermal expansion and a broadening of Bragg reflections were reported earlier [340]. It was speculated that these phonon anomalies may also result from chromium off-centre relaxations, which locally break the cubic symmetry. Possible relaxations of these dipolar modes at elevated temperatures can be identified in the dielectric spectra shown in Fig. 43. The appearance of new modes at low temperatures in Raman experiments [350] was interpreted in terms of a loss of inversion symmetry and as an indication of Cr off-centring, supporting the MF ground-state picture in CdCr 2 S 4 .Subsequently the phonon properties of CdCr 2 S 4 were studied in full detail as function of temperature by IR [210] and Raman-scattering techniques [350], as well as by ab-initio calculations within frozen-phonon and Berry-phase techniques within the framework of LSDA+U [351].

        <p>FeCr 2 S 4 , with its FiM transition close to 165 K and the JT transition at 9 K has been discussed in some detail in Section 3.2. Further interest in this compound arose due to the fact that after reports of a structural phase transition in the 50-60 K range from a cubic high-temperature to a triclinic low-temperature phase [141], a concomitant transition from a collinear ferrimagnet to a spin-spiral state were observed in Mössbauer [135,137] and muon-spin rotation experiments [136]. These structural and magnetic phase transitions, which possibly are triggered by the onset of orbital fluctuations, are also clearly visible in magnetic susceptibility measurements (see Fig. 14). Finally, from detailed neutron diffraction, thermal expansion, magnetostriction, dielectric, and specific-heat measurements on polycrystalline FeCr 2 S 4 as function of temperature and external magnetic fields it was concluded that it undergoes FE ordering when passing into the orbitally ordered phase [34]. The multiferroicity of FeCr 2 S 4 for T &lt; T OO was concluded from a series of dielectric experiments with the electric field parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field and finally resulted in a (H, T )-phase diagram which is reproduced in Fig. 44. This phase diagram reveals the sequence of PM, collinear FiM, non-collinear FiM in an OL, which is characterized by strong orbital fluctuations, and finally an orbitally ordered phase, which is non-collinear FiM and FE. This phase diagram implies that FE order exists up to higher magnetic fields (&gt;5 T) where collinear FiM order is re-established. This observation excludes a conventional spin-driven iDM mechanism. In this case one also would expect that macroscopic FE polarization evolves at the magnetic phase transition close to 60 K, where the spins become non-collinear. It rather seems that in the case of FeCr 2 S 4 , FE polarization is coupled to the onset of OO. triangular YK phase at low temperatures [25,114]. FiM ordering sets in below ∼65 K and is followed by a low-temperature magnetic phase transition at 5 K where a triangular spin structure is formed: The manganese moments, which are aligned antiparallel to the chromium spins, undergo canting and the chromium moment together with two manganese moments form a spin triangle, the so-called YK phase. It is though that in the FiM phase for temperatures above the YK phase, the chromium moments are aligned parallel to the external field and concerning the manganese moments, only the longitudinal components are ferrimagnetically ordered, while the transverse components still are dynamically disordered (see Fig. 10 for details).FeCr 2 S 4 , with its FiM transition close to 165 K and the JT transition at 9 K has been discussed in some detail in Section 3.2.

        <p>Recently, the (H, T )-phase diagram of MnCr 2 S 4 was investigated utilizing field-dependent sound velocity and pulsed magnetization experiments in external magnetic fields up to 60 T [26]. Some representative results are shown in Fig. 45. In Fig. 45(a) the field-dependence of the magnetization M as measured at 1.5 K is shown as blue solid line. After a strong increase of M due to domain-orientation effects below 1 T, M(H) reveals a continuous increase up to ∼ 11 T, where obviously spin-reorientation occurs, visible via a significant change of slope (labelled Nr. 1). This field regime characterizes the YK phase, which obviously extends up to 11 T. On increasing magnetic fields, the angle between the manganese moments opens and, hence, the magnetization increases. Beyond 11 T, M(H) further increases up to ∼25 K followed by an extremely wide magnetization plateau extending from 25 to 50 T. The change of slope again signals a change in the spin configuration (labelled by ''2''). The plateau regime exhibits a fixed and constant magnetization of 6 µ B , a value signalling FM alignment of the chromium moments in the external field with perfect AFM alignment of the two manganese sublattices. Beyond 50 T the magnetization increases further (labelled ''3''). The field dependence of the magnetization was investigated at temperatures up to 28 K, where a continuous increase of the magnetization with increasing fields was detected [Fig. 45(b)]. The field dependence of the longitudinal sound velocity is documented in Fig. 45(a) (left scale) and reveals the same characteristic temperatures indicative for magnetic phase transitions coupled to the lattice. Specifically, the anomaly 2, just when reaching the magnetization plateau, indicates strong softening of the lattice followed by a constant sound velocity, a fingerprint of a stable structural phase in the plateau regime. Like in the chromium oxides, where the half-magnetization plateau is accompanied by a significant structural phase transition [216], also in MnCr 2 S 4 the transition into the magnetization plateau comes together with a significant structural phase transition.Recently, the (H, T )-phase diagram of MnCr 2 S 4 was investigated utilizing field-dependent sound velocity and pulsed magnetization experiments in external magnetic fields up to 60 T [26].

        <p>In subsequent work, it was attempted to interpret [26,353] and to model [354] the spin structures of MnCr 2 S 4 as function of external magnetic fields. A schematic sketch of the spin structures on increasing fields, taken from Ref. [353], is reproduced in Fig. 46. In Fig. 46(a) the spin structure of the YK phase is plotted in a specific crystallographic plane containing the chromium as well as both manganese ions, which are situated on the two sublattices of the diamond lattice: The two canted manganese moments have an overall FiM alignment with respect to the chromium spins. When compared to the structure of pure A-site spinels as shown in Fig. 27, we see the influence of the strong AFM exchange of chromium spins acting on the manganese moments. In principle the chromium exchange tends to align both manganese moments antiparallel, but is competing with the weaker AFM Mn-Mn exchange. Fig. 46(b) shows the spin alignment of all magnetic moments within the three-dimensional unit cell. Finally, Fig. 46(c) shows the spin orientations with increasing external fields. It was assumed that the chromium moments are always aligned parallel to the external field. The triangular YK structure is followed by an intermediate phase (IM1), where the triangle, defined by the manganese spins, is rotated with respect to the chromium moments. The AFM phase characterizes the stable magnetization plateau [Fig. 45(a)] and here the manganese moments exhibit ideal AFM order and do not contribute to the magnetization. In the plateau region, the external field compensates the chromium exchange and the manganese moments do not feel any additional field except their own exchange field, resulting in pure AFM order. Finally, the spin structure passes into a further intermediate phase (IM2) and subsequently forms an inverse YK (IYK) structure before reaching the completely spin-polarized FM phase. The complete (H, T )-phase diagram up to 100 T will be discussed later in full detail.In subsequent work, it was attempted to interpret [26,353] and to model [354] the spin structures of MnCr 2 S 4 as function of external magnetic fields.

        <p>Here it should be noted that some of the spin structures as depicted in Fig. 46(c) can be interpreted as magnetic analogues of superliquids and supersolids, so-called spin superfluids and spin supersolids. They are characterized by complex spin structures, with independent order of the longitudinal and transverse spin components and were identified earlier in some chromium oxo-spinels [220][221][222]. The identification of supersolid spin states can be based on the analogy of bosonic and spin systems, as outlined in the pioneering work of Matsuda and Tsuneto [355] and Liu and Fisher [356]. In spin systems, the longitudinal AFM order is an analogue of the crystalline order, which, in the quantum lattice-gas model, corresponds to diagonal long-range order, whereas off-diagonal long-range order, which is characteristic of superfluidity, is the counterpart of transverse (XY) AFM order without longitudinal AFM components. Naturally, this analogy also applies for the PM and the supersolid phases. The former, with both orders destroyed, corresponds to a liquid, whereas the latter, hosting both orders, is the spin analogue to the supersolid. Note that in this analogy, the FM phase is equivalent to the paramagnet.Here it should be noted that some of the spin structures as depicted in Fig. 46(c) can be interpreted as magnetic analogues of superliquids and supersolids, so-called spin superfluids and spin supersolids.

        <p>In this paragraph, we are interested in possible MF phases in the H, T phase diagram of MnCr 2 S 4 . It seems natural to check whether the non-collinear spin states as plotted in Fig. 46(c) possibly are also FE. Ruff et al. [353] recently performed a careful dielectric investigation of MnCr 2 S 4 in a broad temperature range and in high external magnetic fields. This study was made possible by the development of experimental techniques, which allow to measure magneto currents in pulsed © 2019 by the American Physical Society. magnetic fields up to 60 T [357]. The phase diagram as derived in Ref. [353] is shown in Fig. 47. The lower frame of this figure [Fig. 47(b)] shows the phase diagram as determined in static magnetic fields up to 14 T. The upper frame [Fig. 47(a)] documents the phase diagram as deduced in pulsed high-magnetic fields experiments up to 60 T. Fig. 47(b) was derived from a series of experiments measuring the dielectric constant as function of temperature and field as well as measuring the pyrocurrent at a series of magnetic fields or the magnetocurrent at different temperatures. In all these experiments, the external magnetic field was aligned parallel to the crystallographic [112] direction and the electric field was aligned perpendicular to the magnetic field [353]. In the low-temperature and low-field diagram [Fig. 47(b)], three FE phases (FE1, FE2 and FE3) were identified, in addition to the PE phase, which is stable beyond the YK phase boundary. The YK phase exhibits ferroelectricity and hence is MF. It also shows that the two intermediate phases, IM1 and IM2, which can be assigned as spin-supersolid phases, are also FE. The broad magnetization plateau [Fig. 45(a)] with ideal collinear AFM order of the manganese spins is paraelectric. It seems clear that all MF phases displayed in Fig. 47 are spin driven. However, as outlined by the authors of Ref. [353] the title compound does not show conventional spin-spiral order, but canted magnetism of spin pairs located on a bipartite diamond lattice and it was speculated that this type of multiferroicity corresponds to a new type of spin-driven ferroelectricity. At high magnetic fields, beyond the extended plateau regime the inverted YK phase again seems to be a polar phase [353] and in the phase diagram is indicated as FE4 [Fig. 47(a)]. The origin and nature of the MF phases of MnCr 2 S 4 are still under discussion: As documented in Fig. 47, FE and hence, MF behaviour appears in all non-collinear phases, while the strictly antiparallel phase is paraelectric. In addition, in model calculations to explain the spin structure as function of an external magnetic field [354] it was shown that only incorporating spin-lattice coupling can explain the complex spin structures including the ultra-stable magnetization plateau. However, it was proposed that this term also induces deviations of the chromium moments from the magnetic field direction, at least in the intermediate (supersolid) phases. In these complex triangular spin structures, iDM interactions still could be responsible for spin-driven ferroelectricity. Very recently, in addition to FE polarization below the onset of YK order, macroscopic polarization has been reported in the FiM phase below ∼65 K in polycrystalline MnCr 2 S 4 [358]. It was argued that FM order of the chromium moments probably induces FE polarization via an exchange striction mechanism. This polarization, which was also measured in external magnetic fields up to 9 T, seems to be much stronger than the polarization induced by the triangular YK spin structure. This recent experimental report documents that much more work is needed to identify possible polar phases in spinel compounds. © 2019 by the American Physical Society.In this paragraph, we are interested in possible MF phases in the H, T phase diagram of MnCr 2 S 4 .

        <p>As detailed above, LiCuVO 4 is an inverse spinel and exhibits spin S = 1 2 chains along the crystallographic b direction. Due to residual inter-chain coupling this compound undergoes 3D ordering at 2.5 K, a temperature which also marks the onset of spin-driven ferroelectricity with polarization P along a. The MF ground state can be explained in terms of a conventional iDM mechanism and the polarization is switchable by external magnetic fields. Very recently, Ruff et al.

Even in the context of spin-driven improper ferroelectricity the polarization is very small and the strong polarization increase below 2.5 K is due to the onset of conventional spin-driven FE. As was documented in Fig. 38, the polarization in the MF ground state reaches values of about 30 µC/m 2 . The field dependent measurements [Fig. 48(b)] document the onset of polar order at 3 T. The inset in Fig. 48(b) shows a marked anomaly of the field-dependent dielectric constant when passing into this field-induced polar phase. This dielectric anomaly provides even more significance for a possible phase boundary in low magnetic fields and at temperatures well above the MF ground state. It was argued [359] that this could be experimental evidence for a long-sought vector-chiral (VC) phase, where ferroelectricity is induced by the chirality alone and not by coherent 3D spin ordering.As detailed above, LiCuVO 4 is an inverse spinel and exhibits spin S = 1 2 chains along the crystallographic b direction.

        <p>Vector chirality, defined by the vector product of spins at adjacent lattice sites, S i × S j , is one of the key concepts in quantum magnetism and an important symmetry element of spin spirals.

In 1D magnets, both, chirality and spin order exhibit long-range order. However, either finite temperatures or quantum fluctuations can completely suppress the long-range spin order of a spiral, while leaving the chiral twist less affected, leading to a VC phase. Long ago, for 1D helimagnets Villain [360] predicted such a phase appearing between the high-temperature paramagnet and the conventional long-range ordered 3D helical spin solid. Villain argued that this chiral order is similar to the ordering of 2D XY helimagnets and that the order parameter is not the real 2D spin, but the fictive Ising spin, which can be related to the chirality and shows up in the four-spin correlation function.Vector chirality, defined by the vector product of spins at adjacent lattice sites, S i × S j , is one of the key concepts in quantum magnetism and an important symmetry element of spin spirals.

        <p>A possible proof of Villain's conjecture of a VC phase was reported, supported by the observation of a two-step magnetic process in the helimagnet Gd(hfac) 3 NITEt [361]. However, in light of the mentioned FE polarization induced by chiral spin twists the most promising route seems to search for VC phases by identifying FE polarization at temperatures slightly above well-known 3D-ordered spin-driven MF phases [362], with LiCuVO 4 being a possible candidate. However, some critical remarks have to be made: Screw-type helical spin structures, with the spin plane perpendicular to the screw axis, are chiral but not polar. On the other hand, cycloidal spin structures break inversion symmetry and are polar but not chiral. Hence, cycloidal spin structure can show clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation, but strictly should not be termed chiral.A possible proof of Villain's conjecture of a VC phase was reported, supported by the observation of a two-step magnetic process in the helimagnet Gd(hfac) 3 NITEt [361].

        <p>The experimentally determined (H, T )-phase diagram, with a focus on temperatures below 12 K and magnetic fields below 9 T, as taken from Ref. [359] is documented in Fig. 49. The phase diagram has been taken with the external magnetic field along the crystallographic c direction and with the electrical field parallel to a. This corresponds exactly to the field configurations, where below 2.5 K, with the onset of 3D magnetic order, long-range FE order was identified. The phase boundaries were identified by pyrocurrent as well as magnetocurrent experiments in addition to dielectric, heat capacity, and magnetization experiments. It was assumed that at zero magnetic fields, cycloidals are formed, however, in equal amounts of clockwise and counter clockwise spin rotation and, hence, with zero macroscopic polarization. At higher fields, above 4 T small macroscopic FE polarization is induced, documenting an imbalance of clockwise and counter-clockwise cycloidals. It is thought that a finite polarization is induced similar to the bulk polarization induced by magneto-electric cooling in ZnCr 2 Se 4 [313]. However, in LiCuVO 4 the polarization results from correlations of the handedness of the spin system only, and is not induced by long-range spin order.The experimentally determined (H, T )-phase diagram, with a focus on temperatures below 12 K and magnetic fields below 9 T, as taken from Ref.

        <p>As documented in the previous chapters, spinel compounds constitute a class of materials with significant application potential ranging from technologies such as transformer cores, high-frequency microwave devices like circulators or phase shifters, millimetre-wave integrated circuitry, and magnetic recording. While some of these applications can be realized utilizing bulk technologies, most of them rely on the synthesis of thin films and heterostructures. For these applications it seems important that the electronic properties of the bulk compounds equally hold for thin films or heterostructures. These relevant bulk properties include strong magnetic exchange with concomitant high transition temperatures and high permeabilities, high resistivity, and low-loss characteristics even at high frequencies. Having this outstanding future potential and these possible applications in mind, during the last decades considerable efforts have been undertaken, especially in the synthesis and characterization of ferrite thin films optimized for specific applications. Quite generally, ferrites are ceramic magnetic oxides with iron as an important constituent. In the early 1950s, ferrites referred mainly to spinel-structure crystals, but later on the wording ferrites was used to classify the entire family of iron oxides including spinels, garnets, hexaferrites, and orthoferrites. In this review we will only discuss spinel thin films. Their properties, including basic information on synthesis and characterization, are documented in an early review given by Suzuki [11].As documented in the previous chapters, spinel compounds constitute a class of materials with significant application potential ranging from technologies such as transformer cores, high-frequency microwave devices like circulators or phase shifters, millimetre-wave integrated circuitry, and magnetic recording.

        <p>From a more fundamental and basic-research dominated perspective, epitaxial thin films and heterostructures also can represent model systems, which exhibit novel phenomena, such as modified super-exchange interactions or perpendicular exchange couplings. In addition, since the early days of high-temperature superconductivity, epitaxial heterostructures composed of complex transition-metal oxides have fascinated theoreticians and experimenters over decades and triggered efforts to realize emergent many-body phenomena not attainable in the bulk. In this respect and during the last decade, the physics of frustrated magnets was an important research topic and a number of groups investigated the role of dimensionality when moving from truly 3D bulk materials, reducing dimensionality and finally approaching the 2D limit. Apart from stabilizing artificial structures along the conventional &lt;001&gt; direction, tuning the growth direction along unconventional crystallographic axes was found to be a promising route to realize novel quantum many-body phases and represents a rapidly developing field of geometrical lattice engineering. This geometrical lattice-engineering approach based on the synthesis of spinel films along &lt;111&gt; crystallographic directions became increasingly popular, e.g., because the B sublattice of spinel compounds along the &lt;111&gt; direction consists of alternating kagome and triangular atomic planes. Further interest in the growth of heterostructures on the basis of spinel-derived transition-metal oxides came along with the rapidly developing field of multiferroics, specifically combining polar and magnetically ordered systems. To enhance ME coupling multilayering techniques or vertically architectured nanocomposite systems were synthesized, which will be discussed later in more detail.From a more fundamental and basic-research dominated perspective, epitaxial thin films and heterostructures also can represent model systems, which exhibit novel phenomena, such as modified super-exchange interactions or perpendicular exchange couplings.

        <p>As outlined earlier, due to their unique properties including high resistivity, low loss at high frequency, high corrosion resistance, and good mechanical stability, magnetic spinel compounds have received great attention in view of their potential applications in a variety of microwave devices, perpendicular recording, and magneto-optical media. As bulk ferrite components are not compatible with planar circuit design, for integration in electronic devices, it seemed important to grow these materials in form of thin films and to characterize their structural and electronic properties as function of film thickness, substrate, as well as substrate orientation and temperature. For these purposes and using thin-film preparation techniques, it seemed important that the unique magnetic properties of the bulk materials remain relatively unchanged even in the form of thin films. As documented in the previous chapters, many of the spinel oxides constitute an important class of insulating magnetic oxides, widely used as soft magnets at high frequencies. Their general formula is AFe 2 O 4 where the iron is ferric Fe 3+ and the A site of the spinel structure is occupied by a divalent transition-metal cation, such as Mg 2+ , Mn 2+ , Fe 2+ , Co 2+ , Ni 2+ , or Zn 2+ . As documented in detail in the previous chapters, when the A and B sites of the spinel structure are occupied by magnetic ions, all the spinel ferrites are FiM with high Curie temperatures. At room temperature, all these compounds with the exception of magnetite, which is a bad metal, are insulating. Only the cobalt compounds, due to their orbital degrees of freedom exhibit sizeable magnetic anisotropy. In transition-metal oxides in general and specifically in oxide spinels, due to the strong interactions of the internal degrees of freedom, like spin, charge, orbital moment, and lattice degrees of freedom, the electronic properties are extremely sensitive to structural distortions and strain. Because of the inevitable lattice mismatch between spinel films and the substrates used, epitaxial thin films are an ideal platform to study the effects of strain on a given structure. Misfit strains induced by substrates are often employed to tune the structure and concomitant electronic properties of the thin films under investigation. Ferrite films were grown in form in nano-or polycrystalline form as well as epitaxial single crystalline thin films. To grow polycrystalline as well as epitaxial thin films, a number of techniques, including electroplating, magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, evaporation, and molecular beam epitaxy have been developed over the years and were used extensively. An overview and details of film-preparation techniques can be found in [11].As outlined earlier, due to their unique properties including high resistivity, low loss at high frequency, high corrosion resistance, and good mechanical stability, magnetic spinel compounds have received great attention in view of their potential applications in a variety of microwave devices, perpendicular recording, and magneto-optical media.

        <p>So far, mainly (Mn:Zn)Fe 2 O 4 ferrites [363][364][365][366], CoFe 2 O 4 ([364,365,367-371], ZnFe 2 O 4 [372], NiFe 2 O 4 [370,373], Fe 3 O 4 , and Co doped magnetite [374] were grown on a variety of substrates, like SrTiO 3 , MgAl 2 O 4 , or MgO by a variety of techniques. Most of these thin films were structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction, and mainly by various magnetization experiments to determine magnetic permeabilities, saturation magnetization, coercivity, and anisotropy. In many of the studies this characterization was performed as function of substrate, substrate orientation and temperature, film thickness, and microstructure. To grow high-quality single-crystalline spinel thin films, in exceptional cases spinelstructure buffer layers have been used [364]. In recent years, new spinel-based ferrite films have been synthesized with astonishing low-loss magnetization dynamics and strong magnetoelastic coupling, which possibly will enable the development of power-efficient ME and acoustic spintronic devices. In this respect, thin films with nominal composition of Ni 0.65 Zn 0.35 Al 0.8 Fe 1.2 O 4 [375] and MgAl 0.5 Fe 1.5 O 4 [376] were synthesized by pulsed laser epitaxy on single crystal MgAl 2 O 4 substrates.So far, mainly (Mn:Zn)Fe 2 O 4 ferrites [363][364][365][366], CoFe 2 O 4 ([364,365,367-371], ZnFe 2 O 4 [372], NiFe 2 O 4 [370,373], Fe 3 O 4 , and Co doped magnetite [374] were grown on a variety of substrates, like SrTiO 3 , MgAl 2 O 4 , or MgO by a variety of techniques.

        <p>In a further approach, utilizing thin-film growth techniques, it was attempted to synthesize and identify new model systems with emerging physical phenomena or many-body quantum states non-existent in the bulk. In this respect, promising modern venues are so-called interface engineering or geometrical-lattice engineering of thin films and heterostructures. Here thin films were grown on unconventional substrate planes resulting in a significant mismatch of lattice parameters between the layers, creating heavy strain and inducing unusual interactions. Furthermore, it seems interesting to investigate ultra-thin films and heterostructures along specific orientations or the stacking of very specific numbers of atomic layers. In the upcoming field of multiferroics, nanostructures and multilayers were grown on specific substrates, always attempting to enhance the ME coupling via coupling of the polar and magnetic order parameters. Consequently, there has been growing interest in the coupling of different functionalities by interfacing materials with appropriate functions, either via multilayering of different compounds or via synthesis of vertical nanocomposites.In a further approach, utilizing thin-film growth techniques, it was attempted to synthesize and identify new model systems with emerging physical phenomena or many-body quantum states non-existent in the bulk.

        <p>In this latter field, the synthesis of a nanostructured BaTiO 3 -CoFe 2 O 4 ferroelectromagnet was reported combining a FE and AFM material [377], with a potential coupling between FE and magnetic order parameters. These nanostructures were deposited on single-crystalline SrTiO 3 by pulsed laser deposition. As a result, the films showed hexagonal arrays of CoFe 2 O 4 nanopillars embedded in a BaTiO 3 matrix, with the nanopillars showing uniform size and average spacing of 20 to 30 nanometres. Since then, a number of isostructural analogues of the CoFe 2 O 4 and BaTiO 3 heterostructures have been synthesized [378]. The growth and characterization of the MF properties of magnetite thin films has been reported in Section 3.4.2. and is documented in Fig. 41 of this review [334].

        <p>One of the first attempts in geometrical lattice engineering has been reported by Lüders et al. [379] reporting the epitaxial growth of FiM CoCr 2 O 4 films on MgAl 2 O 4 resulting in self-organized {111}-faceted pyramids with almost micronsized base dimensions. Similar work concerning the epitaxial growth of (111)-oriented MgCr 2 O 4 thin films has recently been reported by Wen et al. [380]. These authors systematically characterized the structural and electronic properties of thin films grown along the &lt;001&gt; and &lt;111&gt; directions. A short review on geometrical lattice engineering of complex oxide heterostructures has been published by Liu et al. [381]. These authors document the rapidly developing field of geometrical lattice engineering with the emphasis on the design of complex oxide heterostructures along the &lt;111&gt; orientation to design new quantum phases. Another modern branch of thin-film heterostructures refers to the search for emergent magnetic states of ultra-thin films sandwiched between mostly insulating and non-magnetic spacer layers. Here it is worth mentioning a recent work by Liu et al. [382] reporting emergent magnetic states in CoCr 2 O 4 thin films sandwiched between Al 2 O 3 spacer layers. In this work, polarized neutron reflectometry revealed a significant enhancement of magnetization compared to the bulk value. Further synchrotron X-ray magnetic circular-dichroism measurements prove the appearance of FM order of both, Co and Cr spins. The observed phenomena were interpreted as being due to magnetic frustration invoked by quantum confinement effects, which are unattainable in the bulk.One of the first attempts in geometrical lattice engineering has been reported by Lüders et al.

        <p>As is clearly documented in this review, the majority of spinel compounds are insulators or semiconductors with a broad class of semiconducting magnets, interesting for both, applications and basic research. Usually the transitionmetal ions exhibit well-localized d shells, forming localized magnetic moments interacting via direct overlap or via SE interactions given rise to an astonishingly rich variety of magnetic ground state. The complexity of the magnetism arises due to frustration effects and due to competing interactions. Many cupreous oxides are magnetic semiconductors. However, all non-oxidic copper spinels CuM 2 X 4 are metals with significantly different properties: within this class, the spinels with M = Cr are metallic ferromagnets with magnetic-ordering temperatures well above room temperature. From this class of materials Br-doped CuCr 2 Se 4 gained considerable attention because of a series of experimental and theoretical reports on the occurrence of a dissipationless anomalous Hall effect in a series of manuscripts [383][384][385][386], which will be discussed later in this chapter in more detail. All the other known compounds reveal a temperature-independent Pauli paramagnetism and do not undergo magnetic order down to the lowest temperatures. In addition, CuRh 2 S 4 and CuRh 2 Se 4 exhibit superconductivity at low temperatures.As is clearly documented in this review, the majority of spinel compounds are insulators or semiconductors with a broad class of semiconducting magnets, interesting for both, applications and basic research.

        <p>We would like to recall that for the explanation of itinerant electron behaviour, specifically of CuCr 2 S 4 , two competing explanations have been proposed: Lotgering [105], and Lotgering and van Stapele [108] assumed monovalent copper at the A site and mixed valent Cr 3+ and Cr 4+ at the B site, while Goodenough proposed divalent copper at the A site and conventional trivalent chromium at the B site [109]. In this latter interpretation, the copper ions have the formal valence 2+ but their 3d electrons are delocalized and form itinerant electron bands. In this review, we will focus only on some relevant results and will not discuss the physics of these metallic spinels in great detail. A detailed (but early) review on thiospinels including the metallic samples has been given by van Stapele [111]. Later on, using hydrothermal synthesis methods for the growth of single crystals, metallic conductivity has been observed in LiV 2 O 4 [387], which later turned out to be the first heavy-fermion (HF) transition-metal oxide and will be discussed later in full detail. In the early seventies, with LiTi 2 O 4 the only oxide-spinel superconductor has been identified by Johnston and coworkers [388,389] with a relatively high superconducting-transition temperature of the order of 10 K.We would like to recall that for the explanation of itinerant electron behaviour, specifically of CuCr 2 S 4 , two competing explanations have been proposed: Lotgering [105], and Lotgering and van Stapele [108] assumed monovalent copper at the A site and mixed valent Cr 3+ and Cr 4+ at the B site, while Goodenough proposed divalent copper at the A site and conventional trivalent chromium at the B site [109].

        <p>All copper-chromium-chalcogenide spinels, CuCr 2 S 4 , CuCr 2 Se 4 , and CuCr 2 Te 4 , are FM metals with magnetic-ordering temperatures far above room temperature. These spinel-type metals were first synthesized by Hahn et al. [390], who determined the crystallographic structure and identified them to be normal spinel compounds. Subsequently, the magnetic properties of the sulphide and selenide compounds were determined by Lotgering [105]. These compounds exhibit spontaneous magnetization with Curie temperatures T c = 375, 430, and 365 K, for the sulphide, the selenide and the telluride, respectively. At liquid helium temperatures, saturated moments of 4.58, 4.94, and 4.93 µ B were determined [111]. All compounds reveal a very well-developed CW behaviour of the susceptibility below 1000 K with CW temperatures very close to the FM ordering temperatures [111]. From the very beginning, it was clear that the sulphide is relatively hard to synthesize in pure form and often contains AFM CuCrS 2 as an impurity phase.All copper-chromium-chalcogenide spinels, CuCr 2 S 4 , CuCr 2 Se 4 , and CuCr 2 Te 4 , are FM metals with magnetic-ordering temperatures far above room temperature.

        <p>The contradictory interpretation of the itinerant electron behaviour of these compounds is mentioned above. In the light of some more recent soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments on CuCr 2 S 4 and CuCr 2 Se 4 [391], it was concluded that the chromium 2p core excited spectral features of the metallic ferromagnets are similar to those of semiconducting chromium spinels, partially supporting Goodenough's conjecture of Cr 3+ at the octahedral sites. However, these studies showed that the tetrahedral sites are not occupied by divalent copper, but rather by monovalent ions with a small number of holes inducing a finite magnetic moment. It was proposed that the extra holes go to the chalcogenide p band, classifying these compounds as charge-transfer-type materials [391].The contradictory interpretation of the itinerant electron behaviour of these compounds is mentioned above.

        <p>To shed further light on the valencies of copper and chromium in these compounds, a series of solid solutions were prepared and investigated, documented in detail in Ref. [111]. Among these investigations, solid solutions between FiM and insulting FeCr 2 S 4 and FM and metallic CuCr 2 S 4 played an outstanding role. These experiments recently invoked renewed interest, as giant magnetoresistance was reported for Fe 1-x Cu x Cr 2 S 4 [31], which will be discussed later. The first magnetic experiments on these solid solutions were performed by Haacke and Beegle [392]. The main result of these investigations was the fact that only for small and large copper concentrations x, CW behaviour of the susceptibility was observed in reasonably wide temperature ranges, while at intermediate concentrations the inverse susceptibilities display no linear regions at all. In addition, throughout the concentration regime, the saturated moments evolve in a completely non-linear fashion. In this work, it was speculated that the chromium ions may be in a low-spin state at some concentrations [392].To shed further light on the valencies of copper and chromium in these compounds, a series of solid solutions were prepared and investigated, documented in detail in Ref.

The critical temperatures for this (x, T )-phase diagram were taken from magnetization [392,393] and magneto-resistance measurements [394], as well as from Mössbauer and µSR experiments [135][136][137]395]. This phase diagram documents the intrinsic complexity of spinel compounds, which is by far not completely understood. In the pure iron compound (x = 0), we find the wellknown sequence of PM and FiM phases, followed by a spin-spiral configuration coexisting with an OL, which can be thought to correspond to dynamic short-range OO (≲ 60 K) and finally by a spin-spiral ground state in combination with coherent long-range OO (≲10 K). Here it should be clearly stated that the spiral-like spin configuration below 60 K was proposed by µSR experiments [136] and still awaits a microscopic proof, e.g., by neutron-scattering techniques.

        <p>With increasing Cu concentration x, the regime of the helical spin structure is followed by a disordered spin configuration coexisting with short-range OO. With further increasing Cu concentrations, the FiM ordering temperature strongly increases. At low temperatures, this concentration regime so far is not well characterized. It is interesting to note that the regime exhibiting charge-carrier localization strongly extends and finally, close to x ∼ 0.7, there is no metallic-like regime at all. Interestingly, beyond Cu concentrations of x ∼ 0.7 the system reveals metallic and almost FM behaviour.With increasing Cu concentration x, the regime of the helical spin structure is followed by a disordered spin configuration coexisting with short-range OO.

        <p>The only oxide spinel superconductor, LiTi 2 O 4 , was synthesized and characterized by Johnston and coworkers [388,389]. The homogeneity of the spinel phase in the ternary compounds Li l+x Ti 2-x O 4 ranges from x values 0 to 1/3. For all concentrations, the samples reveal an almost temperature-independent Pauli spin susceptibility in the metallic hightemperature phase. From a crystallographic point of view, it seems more adequate to write the cation distribution for this compound following a normal spinel scheme with Li(Li x Ti 2-x )O 4 with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1/3. For x = 0, only titanium cations occupy the octahedral sites with a formal valence of 3.5 providing some arguments for itinerant d electrons. For non-zero x values a statistical distribution of Li and Ti cations at the octahedral sites is expected. Depending on the fraction of the lithium to titanium concentration, superconducting transition temperatures up to 13.7 K were found, with the highest T c values close x ∼0. Johnston [389] concluded that it is likely that the conduction electrons in LiTi 2 O 4 reside primarily on the titanium octahedral-site sublattice of the spinel structure and hence that the title compound is a d electron superconductor. To document that LiTi 2 O 4 probably can be described in terms of a conventional BCS superconductor, Fig. 51 shows the temperature-dependent heat capacity of superconducting LiTi 2 O 4 and non-superconducting Li 4/3 Ti 5/3 O 4 , results, which were published much later for comparison with the HF vanadium compound [396]. The ordering temperature T c of this single crystal close to ideal spinel stoichiometry is 11.8 K. The λ-like anomaly at the superconducting phase-transition temperature is well pronounced and the jump of the heat capacity at the critical temperature ∆Cp /γ T c = 1.75, somewhat lower than the ideal BCS ratio of 2.43.

Originally identified as a further spinel superconductor [111], later on superconductivity was discarded in measurements on high-purity single crystals down to temperatures of 60 mK [399]. This compound gained further interest via early reports of a charge-density wave formation in a strictly 3D material [400]. However, concerning the correct temperature and nature of this phase transition there were a number of contradicting reports, including an interpretation of the phase transition in terms of a cooperative JT transition [401], which are not completely settled until today [402]. Some of these contradictory experimental reports may result from the use of samples grown by different techniques with different stoichiometry, and probably different concentrations of impurity phases.It seems interesting to document the problems with sample purity and stoichiometry, specifically for a number of chalcogenide spinels, by mentioning a large number of contradicting reports in literature concerning the properties of CuV 2 S 4 .

As discussed above, this compound undergoes charge ordering and a concomitant MIT deep within the FiM state. This Verwey transition, which is still not completely unravelled, was the first example of a MIT and will be discussed in this chapter.

        <p>As mentioned above, the development of models and theories of magnetism are closely related to magnetite and started more than 2500 years ago. At 585 BC Thales of Miletus stated that loadstone attracts iron because it has a soul. Since then, this material fascinated countless scientists. Magnetite is an inverse spinel and undergoes FiM ordering with a sizable spontaneous magnetization at 780 K. As detailed in the introduction, its current applications range from compass needles to magnetic recording devices, it is an important ingredient of many iron ores, and a number of animals or biorganisms use small single magnetite crystals for orientation utilizing the earth magnetic field. A further prominent role of magnetite in solid-state physics originates from the occurrence of a well-pronounced MIT at T V ≈ 122 K. It is named after Verwey, who suggested charge ordering of Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ ions at the B sites as the mechanism driving the dramatic conductivity drop at this phase-transition [30,404,405]. Verwey suggested a low-temperature phase in which Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ ions order along two families of chains. A vast number of subsequent experimental and theoretical investigations, starting in the mid-fifties and ongoing until now, including the work by Anderson [23], Mott [406], and many others, have stimulated a still unresolved dispute on the Verwey transition, trying to explain the numerous and partly mysterious aspects of this transition. Anderson [23] pointed out that under the assumption of nearest-neighbour interactions only, there will be an exceptionally large number of states with the same energy as the structure proposed by Verwey and there will be a highly degenerate ground state, typically observed in pyrochlore lattices. Mott's view of the Verwey transition, corresponding to a phase change from an electrically conducting Wigner glass (T &gt; T V ) into an insulating Wigner crystal (T &lt; T V ), used concepts in terms of tunnelling and variable-range hopping of small polarons [406]. The early work and a number of -at that time -unresolved questions are summarized in [407,408]. In the following, we will focus on the ac and dc conductivity as observed at this MIT and will discuss some recent and modern models and theories trying to capture the essential physics of this transition.As mentioned above, the development of models and theories of magnetism are closely related to magnetite and started more than 2500 years ago.

        <p>At elevated temperatures, the electrical conductivity is of order ∼200 (Ωcm) -1 (see inset of Fig. 52) and exhibits a weak temperature dependence only. At 125 K the conductivity shows a sharp and significant drop by three orders of magnitude and exhibits semiconducting temperature characteristics on further cooling as documented in Fig. 52. Below the Verwey transition the conductivity roughly follows a thermally activated behaviour. Originally this transition has been explained in terms of pure CO of Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ ions at the B sites by Verwey and coworkers and was the very first illuminating example of a temperature driven MIT, stimulating an enormous amount of experimental and theoretical work. At high temperatures, the onset of FiM order at 858 K is indicated by a small dip-like minimum in the temperature dependent conductivity. Obviously magnetic ordering has no big influence on the electrical conductivity in magnetite. At elevated temperatures, above the Verwey transition electron transport between the octahedral iron sites obviously is easily possible and becomes strongly reduced in the charge-ordered regime.At elevated temperatures, the electrical conductivity is of order ∼200 (Ωcm) -1 (see inset of Fig. 52) and exhibits a weak temperature dependence only.

        <p>To shed some light on the charge dynamics in magnetite when crossing the MIT transition, Pimenov et al. [409] undertook broadband measurements of the dynamic conductivity combining THz and IR techniques. The frequency dependence of the real part of the dielectric constant ε 1 and of the real part of the conductivity σ 1 are documented in Fig. 53 for temperatures between 100 and 130 K, for a crystal with T V = 123 K. The complex data of the frequencydependent dielectric constant have been obtained from the transmittance and phase shift of a thin Fe 3 O 4 plate for wavenumbers below 40 cm -1 , and via a Kramers-Kronig analysis of the reflectance of a thick sample for &gt; 30 cm -1 . The spectral range can be separated into three distinct regimes. For wavenumbers between 70 and 700 cm -1 phonon excitations dominate the spectra and are followed by electronic excitations at higher wavenumbers, which are not further analysed. In this regime, only minor temperature-dependent changes can be observed. For wavenumbers &lt; 70 cm -1 , free charge carriers dominate the dielectric response, which completely change their character when crossing the Verwey transition. At the lowest temperatures, hopping conductivity with a characteristic slope σ ∼ν s , describes the real part of the conductivity. For temperatures T &gt; T V this hopping conduction abruptly changes into a Drude-like behaviour characteristic for free charge carriers. The Drude conductivity is rather small and very narrow and can be fitted assuming a low carrier concentration density and a mean relaxation rate of ∼40 cm -1 corresponding to ∼5 meV. The conductivity at low wavenumbers coincides nicely with measurements of the dc conductivity, which are indicated in the lower frame of Fig. 53. The dielectric constant (upper frame of Fig. 53) indicates a hopping term, characteristic for localized charge carriers, and turns negative at the metallic side of the transition, as expected for itinerant charge carriers. These results evidence the formation of a coherent itinerant state on the metallic side of the Verwey transition with high mobility but a low concentration of charge carriers. At low temperatures, magnetite shows the characteristic charge dynamics of semiconductors with hopping conductivity of localized charge carriers. While questions concerning the charge dynamics seem to be settled, a number of open questions remain concerning the low-temperature crystallographic structure of magnetite including the orbital degrees of freedom and the driving force for this MIT transition. The crystallographic structure of the ground state remained controversial because significant twinning of crystal domains hampers any analysis of low-temperature diffraction studies. A variety of powder-diffraction refinements and resonant X-ray studies led to different proposals of charge-ordered and bond-dimerized ground states, which are too numerous to be reviewed here. We only mention some recent progress in this field where all the relevant information can be obtained. A full low-temperature superstructure of magnetite, as determined by high-energy X-ray diffraction from a single-domain magnetite crystal was reported by Attfield and coworkers [338,339]. They impressively document that in the low-temperature charge-ordered phase, the localized d electrons are distributed over three iron sites, arranged as linear molecular units, which they call 'trimerons'. In addition, this charge-order pattern, including these three-site distortions, induces substantial off-centre atomic displacements and couples the resulting large electrical polarization to the magnetization, explaining the reported observation of ME effects. Combining these microscopic structural results of a local creation of electric polarization with the results documented in Fig. 40 and41, where dipolar relaxation and the onset of macroscopic polarization appear well below 50 K, it seems clear that this trimeron formation becomes quasi-static at low temperatures only.To shed some light on the charge dynamics in magnetite when crossing the MIT transition, Pimenov et al.

        <p>Later on it was shown that these complex trimeron molecules exist far above the MIT transition and are the driving force of the Verwey transition [410]. Spectroscopic signatures of the low-energy electronic excitations of this trimeron network were reported in Ref. [411] using terahertz spectroscopy. The use of ultrashort laser pulses allowed the authors to demonstrate the critical softening of these trimeron-derived modes and hence, to demonstrate their importance for driving the Verwey transition.Later on it was shown that these complex trimeron molecules exist far above the MIT transition and are the driving force of the Verwey transition [410].

        <p>In addition to magnetite, there are two further spinel compounds with (rather poor) metallic conductivity at high temperatures, which undergo a MIT transition below room temperature, namely CuIr 2 S 4 and MgTi 2 O 4 . However, it appears that the driving mechanism for the MIT transition in these systems is different and that CO is coupled there to spin dimerization. CuIr 2 S 4 was successfully synthesized and characterized by Nagata et al. [412] and Furubayashi et al. [413]. At 230 K this compound reveals a first-order structural phase transition lowering the crystal symmetry from cubic to tetragonal. This structural-phase transition is accompanied by a drop of the electrical resistivity by almost three orders of magnitude and a concomitant jump in the magnetic susceptibility from Pauli-like paramagnetism at high temperatures to diamagnetism in the low-temperature phase, indicative for spin-dimerization. The diffraction profile in the insulating phase evidences a superstructure, which was not identified in these early studies [413]. In subsequent studies, the crystallographic structure in the insulating low-temperature phase has been determined by Radaelli et al. [39]. Their results indicate that CuIr 2 S 4 undergoes a simultaneous charge-ordering and spin-dimerization transition. Remarkably, the authors found that the charge-ordered pattern consists of isomorphic octamers of Ir 3+ 8 S 24 and Ir 4+ 8 S 24 , which structurally are organized as isovalent bi-capped hexagonal rings. This octamer charge pattern represents an increasing complexity compared to the variety of charge-ordered structures, which are typically based on stripes, slabs, or checkerboard patterns.In addition to magnetite, there are two further spinel compounds with (rather poor) metallic conductivity at high temperatures, which undergo a MIT transition below room temperature, namely CuIr 2 S 4 and MgTi 2 O 4 . However, it appears that the driving mechanism for the MIT transition in these systems is different and that CO is coupled there to spin dimerization. CuIr 2 S 4 was successfully synthesized and characterized by Nagata et al. [412] and Furubayashi et al. [413]. At 230 K this compound reveals a first-order structural phase transition lowering the crystal symmetry from cubic to tetragonal. This structural-phase transition is accompanied by a drop of the electrical resistivity by almost three orders of magnitude and a concomitant jump in the magnetic susceptibility from Pauli-like paramagnetism at high temperatures to diamagnetism in the low-temperature phase, indicative for spin-dimerization. The diffraction profile in the insulating phase evidences a superstructure, which was not identified in these early studies [413].

        <p>MgTi 2 O 4 was synthesized in polycrystalline form by Isobe and Ueda [414]. In this compound, the titanium ions at the B site of the spinel structure constitute a pyrochlore lattice with spin S = 1 2 . The authors found a structural-phase transition close to 260 K lowering the crystal symmetry from cubic to tetragonal. These structural changes are accompanied by drastic changes of the electrical conductivity and of the spin susceptibility. The title compound transforms from a bad metal with Pauli paramagnetism at high temperatures to a spin-dimerized insulator below the MIT phase transition. In subsequent high-resolution synchrotron and neutron-powder diffraction experiments, Schmidt et al. [415] solved the low-temperature crystal structure of MgTi 2 O 4 and found that it contains dimers with alternating short and long bonds, which form a helix-like structure. Additional band-structure calculations characterized the low-temperature structure as an orbitally ordered band insulator. The MIT transition in MgTi 2 O 4 was characterized by IR spectroscopy, measuring the temperature-dependent opening of the charge gap when crossing the MIT [416]. The authors showed that the spectral changes across the MIT could be well understood utilizing the concept of a one-dimensional Peierls transition driven by the ordering of the titanium d yz and d zx orbitals.MgTi 2 O 4 was synthesized in polycrystalline form by Isobe and Ueda [414].

        <p>In the late seventies of the last century, the topic of heavy fermions (HFs) was rapidly developing in the field of solidstate physics with an incredible amount of theoretical and experimental work over the past decades. HF physics is an important sub-area in the arena of strongly correlated matter, closely linked with the physics of transition-metal oxides, high-T c superconductors and quantum criticality. Usually HFs are metallic alloys, which contain rare earth (4f, e.g., cerium) or actinide ions (5f, e.g., uranium). At high temperatures, the magnetization of these compounds follows CW laws, indicative of local-moment magnetism. However, below a characteristic temperature T * (order 10-100 K) they exhibit unusual low-temperature properties, like a linear specific heat, a large temperature-independent Pauli spin susceptibility, and a T 2 -dependent electrical resistivity, with values pointing towards the existence of exceptionally large masses of the conduction electrons, in many cases as large as a few hundred up to thousand times the free-electron mass. This electronic mass enhancement results from an enormous built-up of a high quasi-particle density of states at the Fermi energy. One well-known source of this exotic behaviour is the Kondo effect, which requires ions with quasi-localized f electrons of nearly integer number. The characteristic temperature T *, usually called Kondo-lattice or coherence temperature, can be interpreted to result from a coherent action of these f electrons establishing the anomalous low-temperature properties. Andres et al. [417] discovered the first known HF system, namely CeAl 3 . HF superconductivity was identified by Steglich and coworkers in CeCu 2 Si 2 [418], a work that gave enormous stimulus to the field. There are numerous reviews covering theory and experiment of HF compounds. Here we reference two early reviews provided by Stewart [419] as well as by Grewe and Steglich [420]. According to the recent understanding and following a relatively arbitrary definition, at low temperatures HFs are compounds characterized by Sommerfeld coefficients γ ≥ 400 mJ/(f -atom mol K).In the late seventies of the last century, the topic of heavy fermions (HFs) was rapidly developing in the field of solidstate physics with an incredible amount of theoretical and experimental work over the past decades.

        <p>The normal spinel LiV 2 O 4 was first synthesized by Reuter and Jaskowsky [421] and identified as a mixed-valence spinel Li(V 3+ V 4+ )O 4 , where the pyrochlore lattice is statistically occupied by vanadium ions with either d 1 or d 2 electron configurations. In single crystals, Rogers et al. [387] reported the occurrence of metallic conductivity down to the lowest temperatures. Rather unexpectedly, on decreasing temperatures a crossover from localized moment magnetism to heavy Fermi-liquid behaviour was reported by Kondo et al. [422] utilizing magnetic susceptibility, heat-capacity, and NMR techniques. At the lowest temperatures, the authors found an electronic heat-capacity coefficient γ ∼420 mJ/(mol K 2 ), which is exceptionally large for transition-metal compounds. By subtraction off the phonon-derived specific heat, as determined via measurements of the non-magnetic and non-superconducting Li 4/3 Ti 5/3 O 4 , it was possible to determine the purely magnetic heat capacity at low temperatures. This allowed the authors to identify a continuous increase of the magnetic heat capacity, which was well described using a conventional S = 1/2 single-ion Kondo model and hence, led to the characterization of LiV 2 O 4 as the first d-derived HF metal. In subsequent work, the structural properties were studied in detail [423] and at low temperatures, the authors identified a strongly enhanced electronic Grüneisen parameter, similar to observations in some f -electron HF compounds.The normal spinel LiV 2 O 4 was first synthesized by Reuter and Jaskowsky [421] and identified as a mixed-valence spinel Li(V 3+ V 4+ )O 4 , where the pyrochlore lattice is statistically occupied by vanadium ions with either d 1 or d 2 electron configurations.

        <p>Subsequently, transport, magnetic susceptibility, and specific-heat measurements were reported on hydrothermallygrown LiV 2 O 4 single crystals by Urano et al. [424]. Similar to the findings reported for polycrystalline samples documented above, these results also reveal the formation of a heavy-mass Fermi liquid below a coherence temperature T * ∼20 -30 K. Fig. 54 documents the temperature dependencies of electrical resistivity, heat capacity, magnetic susceptibility, and Hall coefficient, all quantities documenting the characteristic features of HF systems below the crossover temperature. At low temperatures, the resistivity significantly decreases and shows a clear T 2 dependence at the lowest temperatures [inset of Fig. 54(a)]. This T 2 dependence signals the importance of electron-electron scattering of heavy-mass quasi particles. Characteristic for HF behaviour, C /T, representing the temperature dependence of the Sommerfeld coefficient, reveals a continuous increase on cooling, reaching values close to 400 mJ/(molK 2 ) [Fig. 54(b)], and the magnetic susceptibility increases towards low temperatures reaching strongly increased values [Fig. 54(c)].

        <p>To unravel the exotic HF behaviour of this transition-metal compound a number of quasielastic and inelastic neutron scattering experiments were performed by Krimmel et al. [425], Lee et al. [426], Murani et al. [427], and Tomiyasu et al. [428]. In strongly correlated electron systems, the relaxation rate Γ (Q , T ), which can be measured as function of momentum transfer Q via the generalized dynamic susceptibility in neutron-scattering experiments, gives a rough estimate of the hybridization strength of the localized spins with the conduction electrons and, at low temperatures, is a rough measure of the characteristic temperature T *. All these spectroscopic experiments agree that strong spin fluctuations are built up in LiV 2 O 4 at low temperatures, a characteristic signature of strongly correlated materials. The relaxation rate exhibits a weak temperature dependence only and was described by a square-root [425] or a roughly linear temperature dependence [426] with a residual value of the relaxation rate of approximately 1-2 meV when extrapolated towards zero temperature, again a characteristic feature of conventional HF systems with a characteristic coherence temperature of order 20 K. However, there was no agreement concerning the origin of these spin fluctuations, as originating rather from hybridization effects between conduction electrons and localized moments as observed in Kondo-type materials or being driven by strong magnetic frustration. In Fig. 55 we reproduce a typical spin-fluctuation spectrum as observed by Murani et al. [427]. Here the dynamic structure factor S(Q , ω), a direct measure of the dynamic susceptibility multiplied by a detailed-balance temperature factor, is colour-code plotted in the energy (ℏω) vs. momentum transfer (Q ) plane. At 2 K [Fig. 55a], a broad intensity maximum close to momentum transfers of ∼0.5 Å -1 and to energy transfers ∼1.5 meV, signals dominant AFM fluctuations. With increasing temperatures, this fluctuation spectrum is shifted towards low energies and low momentum transfer, which is nicely documented in Fig. 55(b) at 40 K. From an experimental point of view based on the PM scattering rate, LiV 2 O 4 at low temperatures is dominated by AFM spin fluctuations, while at higher temperatures it has similarities with a metal close to a FM instability. This temperature-induced crossover from AFM to FM fluctuations was further elucidated by a detailed analysis of the magnetic-scattering cross section in polarized neutron studies [429]. It was proposed that the increasing importance of FM correlations may result from an increasing importance of Hund's rule coupling between itinerant and localized d moments [430].To unravel the exotic HF behaviour of this transition-metal compound a number of quasielastic and inelastic neutron scattering experiments were performed by Krimmel et al.

[422], a series of NMR experiments was published in LiV 2 O 4 , as well as in zinc and titanium doped samples, mainly utilizing 7 Li and 51 V line width, Knight shift, and spin-lattice relaxation [431][432][433][434][435][436]. The temperature dependence of the linewidth usually is determined by an inhomogeneous broadening due to local magnetic fields and often can be taken as measure of homogeneity and purity of the samples under investigation. The Knight shift provides a direct measure of the microscopic and local static susceptibility, while the spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T 1 traces the temperature dependence of the imaginary part of the dynamic susceptibility and is determined by 1/T 1 = T χ 0 / Γ (T ), where χ 0 denotes the static bulk susceptibility and Γ (T ) the temperature-dependent magnetic relaxation rate at zero momentum transfer. These are the most decisive properties of the electronic environment of the NMR nuclei, being responsible for the nuclear relaxation process. In heavy-electron systems, the spin-lattice relaxation is a linear function of temperature with a highly enhanced slope or alternatively, (TT 1 ) -1 is a constant with a relatively large value when compared to conventional metals with effective electron masses of order 1.Starting with the pioneering work by Kondo et al.

        <p>A convincing comparison of relaxation rates as observed in transition-metal oxides including LiV 2 O 4 as compared to those observed in conventional f -derived HF systems has been provided by Krug von Nidda et al.

In the upper frame, spin-relaxation rates 1/T 1 as observed in 7 Li NMR experiments in LiV 2 O 4 are compared with those observed in conventional HF compounds CeCu 2 Si 2-x Ge x . In the lower frame, the temperature dependence of the linewidth as observed in ESR experiments is compared for the Gd doped HF compound CeCu 2 Si 2 and the transition-metal oxides Gd 1-y Sr y TiO 3 . Depending on the electronic filling of the Ti 3d bands controlled by the strontium concentration y, the latter substitutional series undergoes a MIT on decreasing y between 0.2 &gt; y &gt; 0.1, realizing a Mott insulator for effective half filling at y = 0 (Ti 3+ , 3d 1 ). Close to the MIT the electronic density of states at the Fermi energy is strongly enhanced resulting in a HF-like behaviour in the metallic regime of the phase diagram. In metals, the ESR linewidth is proportional to the spin-lattice relaxation rate.

        <p>In all the compounds investigated, the relaxation rates exhibit an increase on cooling, pass through a maximum, and linearly decrease on further cooling towards the lowest temperatures. The low-temperature slopes of the relaxation rates correspond to an enormous Korringa relaxation due to a significantly enhanced electronic density of states at low temperatures. In the lower frame, the typical Korringa relaxation as observed in normal metals is indicated. The maximum in the relaxation rate corresponds to the crossover from itinerant HF to local-moment behaviour and the high-temperature behaviour indicates the CW-like behaviour of the magnetic susceptibility in the regime where local-moment magnetism is recovered. From a theoretical point of view, utilizing dynamical mean-field theory, the authors documented that the dynamic susceptibilities as calculated for the Hubbard model and for the periodic Anderson model qualitatively look rather similar. While the Hubbard model serves as representative microscopic model for the MIT transition, the periodic Anderson model is one of the canonical models for the heavy-fermion formation in Kondo-lattice systems. In both models a narrow quasiparticle peak appears at low temperatures and energies, resulting in strongly enhanced effective masses. It documents that on-site hybridization like in the periodic Anderson model and electronic correlations in systems close to half conduction-band filling like in the Hubbard model yield similar spectral densities and similar dynamic susceptibilities.In all the compounds investigated, the relaxation rates exhibit an increase on cooling, pass through a maximum, and linearly decrease on further cooling towards the lowest temperatures.

        <p>Over the years, numerous models and theories were developed to interpret the HF behaviour of LiV 2 O 4 . It is out of the scope of this review to adequately discuss the development of these theories. Here we provide a reference list of the most important publications in chronological order of appearance [403,[442][443][444][445][446][447][448][449][450][451][452][453]. Roughly speaking, the theories can be classified into two groups, either focusing on Kondo-like aspects important for conventional HF systems or on the importance of magnetic frustration and the closeness of the title compound to magnetic order and to a MIT transition. Concerning the HF picture, in ab-initio calculations, like LDA + U schemes or similar band-structure calculations, it was assumed that with respect to the mixed valence of the vanadium ions, with an overall d 1.5 configuration, one electron is localized on the pyrochlore lattice establishing a local moment with spin S = 1/2, while the remaining 0.5 electrons are itinerant and partly fill a relatively broad band. On decreasing temperatures, local moments and itinerant charge carriers hybridize, quench the local magnetic moments and establish a low-temperature state with a strongly enhanced density of states at the Fermi energy. This ansatz is analogous to what is assumed in conventional f -derived HF systems, but is unusual in that both electronic species, local moments and conduction electrons, belong to the same d electron manifold. References [442,445,450] are representative models proceding in this way and explaining the exotic low-temperature properties of LiV 2 O 4 . A number of models start with the dominance of strong magnetic frustration [443,[446][447][448], trying to explain in this way the HF-like properties at low temperatures. Finally, triggered by photoemission-spectroscopy studies, which revealed a sharp peak-like structure at ∼4 meV above the Fermi energy [454], the electronic properties of LiV 2 O 4 were recalculated using realistic LDA + DMFT (Dynamical Mean-Field Theory) methods and found good agreement with the photoemission experiments [452]. According to these calculations, the physical origin of the peak structure is not a conventional hybridization, but results from the fact that this compound is very close to a Mott-Hubbard MIT transition.Over the years, numerous models and theories were developed to interpret the HF behaviour of LiV 2 O 4 .

This ansatz is analogous to what is assumed in conventional f -derived HF systems, but is unusual in that both electronic species, local moments and conduction electrons, belong to the same d electron manifold. References [442,445,450] are representative models proceding in this way and explaining the exotic low-temperature properties of LiV 2 O 4 . A number of models start with the dominance of strong magnetic frustration [443,[446][447][448], trying to explain in this way the HF-like properties at low temperatures. Finally, triggered by photoemission-spectroscopy studies, which revealed a sharp peak-like structure at ∼4 meV above the Fermi energy [454], the electronic properties of LiV 2 O 4 were recalculated using realistic LDA + DMFT (Dynamical Mean-Field Theory) methods and found good agreement with the photoemission experiments [452]. According to these calculations, the physical origin of the peak structure is not a conventional hybridization, but results from the fact that this compound is very close to a Mott-Hubbard MIT transition.</p>
        <p>Giant magnetoresistance, which, e.g., in metallic multilayers, is caused by spin-dependent electron scattering, in the past has attracted considerable attention in the area of fundamental research, but also for device applications as magnetic recording heads. In the early nineties of the past century, so-called CMR effects were observed in Ba- [455] or Ca-doped [456] LaMnO 3 perovskite-derived thin films, reaching magneto-resistance (MR) values MR = [R(0) -R(H)]/[R(0)] of 60% and more than 1000%, respectively. It was speculated that these colossal MR values result from a phase transition of a hightemperature insulating AFM into a metallic and FM phase. Somewhat later, similar CMR effects were observed in FeCr 2 S 4 and in Fe:CuCr 2 S 4 compounds [31]. A representative result is depicted in Fig. 57. Here the temperature dependence of the magnetization M (upper frame) at various external magnetic fields is shown together with the thermopower S (middle frame) and the resistivity ρ at different fields (lower frame, left scale). Here also the temperature dependence of the MR is shown as determined at 6 T (right scale). The upper frame reveals the weakly field dependent onset of spontaneous magnetization around the onset of FiM ordering, which for FeCr 2 S 4 was discussed in detail in Section 3.2 (see Fig. 14). The enhancement of the thermopower close to the magnetic ordering transition was recognized already much earlier [457] and was explained by the fact that at the magnetic transition temperature the charge carriers acquire additional kinetic energy, due to magnon-hole interactions. The CMR effects are documented in the lower frame of Fig. 57. The origin of this effect remains unclear: In the doped perovskite manganates, it is thought that the double-exchange mechanism plays an important role, whereby charge transport is enhanced by the magnetic alignment of neighbouring Mn ions with different valence configurations Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ . Heterovalency plays no role in FeCr 2 S 4 and hence, cannot explain the experimentally observed CMR effects. It can rather be associated with spin-disorder scattering.Giant magnetoresistance, which, e.g., in metallic multilayers, is caused by spin-dependent electron scattering, in the past has attracted considerable attention in the area of fundamental research, but also for device applications as magnetic recording heads.

        <p>A systematic study of the evolution of the electric resistivity and CMR effect dependent on the copper content was performed on Fe 1-x Cu x Cr 2 S 4 single crystals by Fritsch et al. [394]. As shown in the top frame of Fig. 58 for x ≤ 0.5 the temperature dependence of the resistivity is qualitatively similar to that of x = 0, i.e. increasing on decreasing temperature in the PM regime with a peak close to T C , then decreasing below T C , passing a minimum, and again increasing down to lowest temperatures. While T C is monotonously increasing with x, as documented in Fig. 50, the resistivity minimum first drops from about 140 K for x = 0 down to 70 K for x = 0.1 and then gradually returns to 140 K for x = 0.5. In that study, the absolute value of the resistivity at room temperature drops from about 2 Ωcm for x = 0 down to 10 mΩcm for x = 0.1 and then increases up to 25 mΩcm for x = 0.5. For higher x (not shown) the room-temperature resistivity passes a maximum of about 250 mΩcm at x = 0.6, drops down to 1.5 mΩcm at x = 0.7, and remains on a level of a few m cm at higher x [458]. At these higher Cu contents, the anomaly at T C is less pronounced, but a slight increase of the resistivity with decreasing temperature is always observed. Source: Material from: Ramirez et al.

        <p>In general, the conductivity in this substitutional series is explained to arise from hole doping by monovalent Cu + resulting in trivalent Fe 3+ on the A site for x &lt; 0.5. Hence, electron hopping between Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ dominates the electrical-transport properties in this range of copper concentration. This hopping becomes more effective in case of magnetic order. In analogy to Zener's double exchange between ferromagnetically aligned Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ ions in CMR manganites, a triple exchange between two ferromagnetically aligned Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ ions involving the antiferromagnetically aligned Cr 3+ ions was suggested [459] agreement with electronic band-structure calculations [460]. For x &gt; 0.5, when only Fe 3+ exists, mixed valence of Cr 3+ and Cr 4+ is suggested to drive the conductivity in terms of a regular doubleexchange process or alternatively hole conductivity in the sulphur 3p band is possible. However, a complete single-crystal study of the copper-rich side does not exist up to now, because stable single crystals have been obtained up to x = 0.8 so far and higher concentrations exist only in polycrystalline form.In general, the conductivity in this substitutional series is explained to arise from hole doping by monovalent Cu + resulting in trivalent Fe 3+ on the A site for x &lt; 0.5.

        <p>Regarding the MR, significant effects have been observed for the iron-rich side only (Fig. 58, middle frame). Starting from high temperatures in the PM regime, one observes a positive magnetoresistance with a peak at T C , as already reported for pure FeCr 2 S 4 . On further decreasing temperature and for the external magnetic field aligned along the hard &lt;111&gt; direction, the MR changes its sign and diverges on approaching zero temperature. But for the magnetic field applied along the easy &lt;100&gt; direction, the magnetoresistance remains positive, but small compared to the peak at T C . This behaviour is directly connected to the increase of the magnetic anisotropy on decreasing temperature, which is documented by the concomitant increase of the magnetic anisotropy as obtained from the significant shift of the FMR fields (Fig. 58, bottom frame). This magnetic anisotropy due to the Fe 2+ Jahn-Teller ions and the related CMR effect weaken on increasing Cu+ content as the Fe 2+ content decreases. These results show that the electric conductivity strongly depends on the mutual orientation of the magnetic sublattices of iron and chromium in accordance with the suggested triple-exchange mechanism.Regarding the MR, significant effects have been observed for the iron-rich side only (Fig. 58, middle frame).

        <p>For exploration of the phase diagram of LiCuVO 4 up to full polarization of all copper spins at the saturation field µ 0 H sa t = 45 T, high-field 51 V and 7 Li NMR measurements contributed valuable information [464,465]. In the IC spin-modulated phase above 7.5 T the 51 V NMR spectra reveal a characteristic double-horn shape for the magnetic field applied along the crystallographic c axis. This results from the fact that the magnetic moments are aligned parallel to the applied field H and their values alternate sinusoidally along the magnetic chains. As expected for such a modulated spin structure, the spin-spin relaxation time T 2 at the vanadium sites depends on the particular position of the probing 51 V nucleus with respect to the magnetic copper moments.

        <p>Close to saturation, a long-range ordered spin-nematic phase was theoretically predicted for the frustrated chain antiferromagnet [466]. Indeed, on approaching the saturation field, the double-horn shape of the 51 V NMR spectra transforms into a single Lorentzian line around µ 0 H c3 = 40.5 T. Although the magnetization curve M(H) shows a linear increase of magnetization in the field range H c3 &lt; H &lt; H sat [467], the internal field corresponding to the peak of the NMR spectra remains unchanged above 41.4 T, indicating that the moments surrounding the majority of vanadium nuclei are already saturated in this field range. Moreover, the temperature-and field-dependence of the 7 Li nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate reveals an energy gap expected for bound-magnon pairs above saturation at 41.4 T. Thus, the theoretically predicted nematic ordered phase is supposed to be realized in the narrow field range between 40.5 T and 41.4 T [465].Close to saturation, a long-range ordered spin-nematic phase was theoretically predicted for the frustrated chain antiferromagnet [466].

        <p>From the very beginning, research on magnetism of spinel compounds tried to unravel the dependence of different exchange interactions on lattice spacing. This was done by comparing ordering temperatures and CW temperatures of different compounds and investigating the evolution of these characteristic temperatures in solid solutions as function of lattice spacing, ion-ion separation, and bonding angles. The first detailed study in this respect was performed by Baltzer et al. [107] trying to relate the characteristic Curie or Néel and CW temperatures of the FM semiconducting chalcogenides ACr 2 X 4 (A = Cd, Hg; X = S, Se) on the 90 • FM Cr-X -Cr SE interactions and on the more distant AFM Cr-X -A-X -Cr exchange via three intermediate ions. In the sulphides and selenides with the larger lattice constants compared to the oxides, the direct AFM NN Cr-Cr exchange is negligible. For CdCr 2 S 4 , CdCr 2 Se 4 , and HgCr 2 Se 4 compounds with FM ground state and metamagnetic HgCr 2 S 4 , Baltzer et al. [107] introduced a FM NN exchange J and an additional AFM NNN exchange K averaging over 30 similar but slightly different exchange paths and calculated the observed ordering and CW temperatures depending on the parameters J and K. With increasing lattice spacing when going from sulphides to selenides, an increase of the value of the FM NN exchange J and decrease of the AFM NNN exchange K was show.From the very beginning, research on magnetism of spinel compounds tried to unravel the dependence of different exchange interactions on lattice spacing.

        <p>In the early work, experiments on the pressure dependence of ordering temperatures of spinel compounds were conducted to check these ideas concerning the competing FM and AFM exchange and to determine the pressure dependencies of J and K [469,470]. Srivastava [469] measured the pressure dependencies of the Curie temperatures T C of CdCr 2 S 4 , CdCr 2 Se 4 , and HgCr 2 Se 4 up to 1 GPa. From the negative sign of the pressure derivative dT C /dp for these three FM compounds a decrease of the AFM exchange K under pressure was concluded, however assuming a week dependence of the FM NN exchange J on the lattice compression. In contrast, for HgCr 2 S 4 a positive sign of dT C /dp was found. At that time, HgCr 2 S 4 was treated as ferromagnet, while later studies found that this mercury-sulphide compound undergoes AFM spin-spiral ordering close to 25 K. Later on the research moved towards pressure-dependent investigations of strongly frustrated oxides [471,472]. Jo et al. [471] studied magnetic properties under pressure up to 0.96 GPa on the geometrically frustrated ZnCr 2 O 4 spinel. This compound shows a simultaneous AFM and structural transition at 12.5 K, which is attributed to a spin-Jahn-Teller effect that reduces the crystal symmetry from cubic to tetragonal and thereby releases magnetic frustration. The reported increase of the magnetic transition temperature under pressure, which was treated in the frame of a quantum mean-field theory. In this model, it was shown that increasing pressure leads to an increase of the NN exchange J 1 that characterizes interaction between the nearest spins that belong to the same tetrahedron and a decrease of the exchange J 2 representing next-nearest-neighbour interactions. Ueda and Ueda [472] studied two further geometrically frustrated chromium oxide spinels, namely CdCr 2 O 4 and HgCr 2 O 4 . They found that both, Néel and CW temperatures for these compounds increase by applying pressure indicating that the nearest-neighbour direct AF interactions were enhanced through increasing overlap of t 2g orbitals. A further important and significant observation of this work concerns the exotic field-induced transition to a half-magnetization plateau observed in high magnetic fields for these oxide spinels. The critical field of the transition into the plateau state for HgCr 2 O 4 was found to scale with the CW temperature under pressure, implying that this transition is governed by AFM NN interactions [472].In the early work, experiments on the pressure dependence of ordering temperatures of spinel compounds were conducted to check these ideas concerning the competing FM and AFM exchange and to determine the pressure dependencies of J and K [469,470].

        <p>These authors provide a systematic investigation of AV 2 O 4 spinels, with A = Mg, Zn, Mn, and Cd. The authors speculate that these vanadium spinels might be close to a MIT due to the direct overlap of the vanadium orbitals. They plot the AFM ordering temperature as function of the inverse V-V separation and locate the Cd and Mg compound in the PM and insulating regime, while the Zn and Mg vanadates come close to the regime with strong overlap enhancing the probability for the vanadium electrons to become itinerant. By systematic pressure-dependent studies of the AFM ordering temperatures, they indeed find arguments for a breakdown of localized electron behaviour within this vanadium spinel series [473]. Finally there were numerous high-pressure X-ray diffraction and Raman scattering studies up to much higher pressure of 50 GPa, mainly to detect pressure-induced magneto-structural phase transitions, also combined with possible MIT transitions [474][475][476][477][478][479][480][481]. Some of these high-pressure experiments dealt with the investigations of the ME and MF compounds. Efthimiopulous et al. [475] found that pressurizing ME HgCr 2 S 4 induces three reversible structural phase transitions. Here, the starting cubic (Fd3m) phase adopts a tetragonal I4 1 /amd structure at 20 GPa. This structural transition is of the first order and accompanied by a 4% reduction of the cell volume. The cubic-to-tetragonal transformation appears to be concomitant with a MIT transition as was concluded from the substantial reduction of the Raman intensity under pressure. This conclusion is supported by spin-polarized LSDA+U calculations for both, cubic and tetragonal phases. These calculations also have shown that at high pressure a significant reduction of the density-of-states of the Cr t 2g electrons at the Fermi energy takes place, indicating a tendency to suppress magnetism in the I4 1 /amd phase [475]. Above 26 GPa, in HgCr 2 S 4 a further structural transformation into a state with orthorhombic distortions takes place. Above 36 GPa a third transition into a high-pressure phase HP3 phase was found. However, the symmetry of this phase still has to be resolved.These authors provide a systematic investigation of AV 2 O 4 spinels, with A = Mg, Zn, Mn, and Cd.

        <p>Under pressure, X-ray and Raman studies of the mercury-chromium-selenide spinel HgCr 2 Se 4 identified two subsequent structural phase transitions [474]. The ambient-pressure (Fd3m) phase was found to transform into a tetragonal I4 1 /amd structure above 15 GPa. Again, it was speculated that this transition is accompanied by an MIT, resulting in a vanishing Raman signal in the high-pressure phase. Further compression of HgCr 2 Se 4 leads to structural disorder beyond 21 GPa. This behaviour was interpreted as precursor phenomenon of another crystalline phase with higher cationic coordinations, which cannot crystallize due to kinetic effects. The respective spin-resolved band structure calculations performed in [474] revealed significant changes in the electronic structure of HgCr 2 Se 4 after the cubic-to-tetragonal transition, whereas the FM NN SE interactions are found to dominate in both structures.Under pressure, X-ray and Raman studies of the mercury-chromium-selenide spinel HgCr 2 Se 4 identified two subsequent structural phase transitions [474].

        <p>The cubic (Fd3m) structure of MF compound CoCr 2 O 4 is stable up to 16 GPa [476]. Further compression leads to a reversible asymmetric broadening for the Bragg peaks. Detailed X-ray and Raman studies excluded non-hydrostatic conditions or cationic inversion as a possible origin of the broadening of the Bragg peaks and attributed it to a first-order phase transition into a phase with lower, probably tetragonal I4 1 /amd symmetry. The analysis of the evolution of the cation-oxygen bond lengths and interatomic bond angles under pressure have shown that the Co-O bond length exhibits a significant reduction compared to the Cr-O length, which remains almost uncompressible. These two bond lengths become comparable just before arriving the critical pressure of 16 Gpa. At the same time, the interatomic bond angles Cr-O-Co and Cr-O-Cr change very little with pressure. The ab-initio density-functional-theory calculations performed in [476] have shown that the high pressure tetragonal phase favours a FM ground state compared to the PM state in the cubic Fd3m phase. The analysis of the exchange interactions J AA , J AB and J BB revealed that with increasing pressure the ratio J BB /J AB increases significantly suggesting enhanced magnetic frustration.The cubic (Fd3m) structure of MF compound CoCr 2 O 4 is stable up to 16 GPa [476].

        <p>High-pressure Raman and X-ray studies of MF ZnCr 2 Se 4 [477] documented that the cubic Fd3m structure persists up to 15 GPa, while above 18 GP a new structure comparable to a CrMo 2 S 4 -type structure -a distorted variant of the monoclinic Cr 3 S 4 structure -is established. This structural transformation in ZnCr 2 Se 4 is reversible and of first order. In the monoclinic phase both type of cations (Zn and Cr) are in six-fold coordination with alternative layers of ZnSe 6 and CrSe 6 stacked along the c axis. The substantial reduction of the Raman signal above 12.5 GPa suggests that this structural transformation again is accompanied by a MIT. Ab initio-DFT calculations successfully reproduced the cubic-to-monoclinic structural transition.

        <p>High-pressure X-ray diffraction and Raman studies up to 42 GPa were conducted on CdCr 2 Se 4 , which is governed by FM exchange, and resolved three structural phase transitions [478]. The cubic structure at ambient pressure transforms at ∼11 GPa into a tetragonal I4 1 /amd structure and undergoes a further orthorhombic distortion at ∼15 GPa. It seems that significant structural disorder is induced beyond 25 GPa. Comparing these results with pressure results from other chromium sulphide and selenide spinels, the authors found a clear correlation between the cubic-tetragonal transition pressures and the next-nearest-neighbour magnetic exchange interactions and concluded that the cubic-to-tetragonal transitions in these systems are governed by magnetic exchange alone [478]. These conclusions were further corroborated by high-pressure X-ray diffraction studies on MnCr 2 O 4 and NiCr 2 O 4 spinels [481], providing experimental evidence that the Cr-Cr magnetic exchange interactions alone suffice to account for the high-pressure behaviour of these systems.High-pressure X-ray diffraction and Raman studies up to 42 GPa were conducted on CdCr 2 Se 4 , which is governed by FM exchange, and resolved three structural phase transitions [478].

        <p>High-pressure X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy studies of ZnCr 2 S 4 spinel found a sequence of structural transformations from cubic Fd3m to tetragonal I4 1 /amd structure at 21 GPa, followed by transition to orthorhombic Imma state above 33 GPa [479]. Interestingly, similar structural transformations take place at ambient pressure on decreasing temperature from 300 K (in the PM state) to 16 K and 8 K into two different magnetic states with complex AFM spin ordering [179]. This supports the above conclusion that the structural cubic-to-tetragonal transformation mainly is driven by the variation of magnetic exchange. A careful inspection of the XRD and Raman data revealed an additional isostructural transformation in ZnCr 2 S 4 between 9 and 14 GPa, which was speculated to be induced by changes of the electronic state of the Cr ions. The sequence of structural phase transitions as observed in a number of chromium sulphide and selenide spinels up to a hydrostatic pressure of ∼40 GPa is shown in Fig. 61 [479].

At ambient pressure this compound exhibits FM behaviour and metallic conductivity. The cubic Fd3m structure of CuCr 2 Se 4 is stable up to 8 GPa. Above this pressure, several new Bragg reflections appear in the XRD pattern, however this transformation becomes complete only at 20 GPa. The contrasting pressure behaviour of Cu and Zn based selenides, as compared to sulphide and oxide spinels was attributed to steric effects, which are proposed to be the driving force of the cubic-to-monoclinic transformation.A second example of cubic-to-monoclinic structural transformation under pressure was reported for CuCr 2 Se 4 [480].

In addition to detailed discussions of the complex magnetic ground states, including Jahn-Teller and orbital-ordering effects, and of the many open questions concerning the occurrence of ferroelectricity and multiferroicity, we also have mentioned a number of interesting and outstanding features, like the observation of heavyfermion behaviour, superconductivity in spinels, as well as the occurrence of CMR and metal-to-insulator transitions. Finally, we have commented ongoing attempts to measure and analyse high magnetic-field data, as well as high-pressure results. This review clearly documents the outstanding importance of spinels in developing models and theories for magnetic compounds, and specifically the significance of magnetic frustration in these compounds.This review summarizes the research on spinel compounds, mainly focusing on recent studies of the magnetic and polar properties of this class of compounds.

        <p>In parallel, the basic principles of magnetic exchange and magnetic order, as well as the importance of crystalelectric-field effects and orbital-ordering phenomena, were tested and exemplified on a variety of spinel compounds: The occurrence of ferrimagnetism and of the triangular YK phase were experimentally verified in spinel compounds. In addition, since decades the Verwey transition, a metal-to-insulator like transition observed in magnetite, is in the focus of basic research. Spinels in modern research of magnetism are highly interesting because of frustration effects: The A sites in the spinels constitute a bipartite diamond lattice, and are responsible for unconventional magnetic ground states, which strongly depend on the ratio of the exchange interactions within and between the two sublattices. B-site ions are located at the vertices of a pyrochlore lattice, one of the strongest contenders of frustration in 3D. If A and B sites in the lattice are occupied by magnetic ions, again, competing magnetic exchange interactions are responsible for a variety of complex spin configurations. The complexity of many spinel compounds is further enhanced by additional orbital-ordering and charge-ordering phenomena and in many cases, a strong spin-lattice coupling. Spinels belong to a class of transitionmetal compounds with an extremely strong entanglement of spin, charge, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom, with a variety of emerging complex phenomena: spin liquids, spin-spiral liquids, spin-orbital liquids, orbital glasses, spin-driven Jahn-Teller effect, the occurrence of metal-to-insulator transition, heavy-fermion behaviour, fractionalized magnetization plateaus, and colossal magnetoresistance, to name a few, are illuminating examples and are discussed in detail in the present review.In parallel, the basic principles of magnetic exchange and magnetic order, as well as the importance of crystalelectric-field effects and orbital-ordering phenomena, were tested and exemplified on a variety of spinel compounds: The occurrence of ferrimagnetism and of the triangular YK phase were experimentally verified in spinel compounds.

        <p>Many of the phenomena reported during the last years are far from being completely understood: The microscopic origin of multiferroicity in a variety of spinels is not finally unravelled. Whether some of the spinel compounds indeed exhibit a tendency to off-centring of the B-site ions is not clear and far from being well established. The existence of spinsupersolid and spin-superliquid phases, which are claimed to exist for some chromium spinels at high magnetic fields, has not been finally verified experimentally and the correspondence of these phases to supersolids and superliquids is not settled from a theoretical point of view. Thus, many open questions remain and have to be resolved in the forthcoming years. It is clear that highly improved sample-growing techniques, which allow the growth of single crystals large enough, even for inelastic neutron scattering studies, and the continuous and significant improvement of various experimental techniques operating in a broad range of external parameters, will strongly advance the field. Specifically, X-ray absorption techniques and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism experiments, which can nowadays be performed at high external magnetic fields will provide microscopic views on spin structures and moment orientations and should help to finally solve a number of open questions.Many of the phenomena reported during the last years are far from being completely understood: The microscopic origin of multiferroicity in a variety of spinels is not finally unravelled.

        <p>Research on spinel compounds was in the focus of the experimental work performed in Experimental Physics V at the Center of Electronic Correlations and Magnetism at the University of Augsburg. This research was carried out by the authors of the present review over the past 20 years. However, this research has benefited a lot from contributions of a number of people, either being former members of the group or researchers with close and long-standing collaborations over the years. We are especially grateful to Manuel Brando, Norbert Büttgen, Ilias Efthimiopoulos, Viorel Felea, Veronika Fritsch, Axel Günther, Joachim Hemberger, Christian Kant, Alexander Krimmel, Stephan Krohns, Franz Mayr, Atsuhiko Miyata, Andrei Pimenov, Lilian Prodan, Thorsten Rudolf, Alexander Ruff, Michael Schmidt, Florian Schrettle, Yurii Skourski, Natalia Tristan, Zhe Wang, and Sebastian Widmann, who have worked with us over the years and helped to make this research exciting and successful. In addition, we are indebted to our colleagues Leon Balents, Mike Kalvius, Peter Lemmens, Jochen Litterst, Christian Rüegg, Yuejian Wang, Jochen Wosnitza, Oksana Zaharko, and Sergei Zherlitsyn for fruitful collaborations and illuminating discussions.Research on spinel compounds was in the focus of the experimental work performed in Experimental Physics V at the Center of Electronic Correlations and Magnetism at the University of Augsburg.
