        <p>For the past three decades, nanoscience has widely affected many areas in physics, chemistry, and engineering, and has led to numerous fundamental discoveries as well as applications and products.</p>
        <p>Concurrently, quantum science and technology has developed into a cross-disciplinary research endeavour connecting these same areas and holds a burgeoning commercial promise. Although quantum physics dictates the behaviour of nanoscale objects, quantum coherence, which is central to quantum information, communication and sensing has not played an explicit role in much of nanoscience. This Review describes fundamental principles and practical applications of quantum coherence in nanoscale systems, a research area we call quantum-coherent nanoscience. We structure this manuscript according to specific degrees of freedom that can be quantum-coherently controlled in a given nanoscale system such as charge, spin, mechanical motion, and photons. We review the current state of the art and focus This is a previous version of the article published in</p>
        <p>on outstanding challenges and opportunities unlocked by the merging of nanoscience and coherent quantum operations.</p>
        <p>Quantum mechanics dictates the basic laws that govern the behaviour of matter and fields at the scale of particles, atoms, and molecules. Therefore, all functionalities at the nanoscale are, at some level, underpinned by quantum effects. Nevertheless, many current functional nanoscale devices are designed and operated without resorting to an explicit quantum treatment. In this manuscript, we describe a more recent development in nanoscience, where quantum coherent phenomena at the nanoscale are explicitly harnessed to enable novel functionalities. We call this endeavour quantum-coherent nanoscience. It represents the core capability that will empower emerging quantum technologies such as quantum computing, quantum simulation, quantum communication, and quantum sensing based on solid-state or molecular nanosystems. In quantum-coherent nanoscience, the behaviours and functionalities that one seeks are the profound, fundamental properties of quantum states, such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum coherence. We will describe how such quantum properties can be designed to persist in engineered materials and devices at the nanoscale. Quantum-coherent nanoscience, lying at the intersection between nanoscience and quantum science, is a discipline within the fields of condensed matter physics, materials science, and molecular chemistry.</p>
        <p>There are three broad reasons for exploring the nanoscale. First, a lesson from the development of classical information technologies is the value of miniaturisation. A quantum technology built on nanoscience has the potential for a density of components approaching the exceptional scale achieved by semiconductor devices, which has enabled the modern era of information technology.</p>
        <p>Second, a range of useful phenomena occur when available quantum excitations are confined or manipulated at the nanoscale, see Box.1 . For example, electrons confined to regions in a semiconductor with dimensions of order tens of nanometers find their kinetic energy quantised on the scale of kB*10 K, offering the possibility of engineering quantum dots with tailored properties 1 . In high-dielectric materials, structures with features on a similar length scale (photonic crystals) can be used to tailor, guide, and localise electromagnetic excitations 2 . Additionally, nanoscale objects constructed with specific materials exhibit acoustic modes with frequencies in the GHz range 3,4 , allowing the control of individual quanta of mechanical motion. environment and with each other must be controlled, which in many systems leads to an associated length scales in the nanometer range. For example, the tunnelling of electrons between neighbouring quantum dots separated by a nanoscale barrier can be sufficient to create and manipulate coherent superpositions of charge states 5 . In combination with the Pauli exclusion principle, the analogous tunnelling of electrons between atoms positioned with few lattice spacing separations on a surface 6 or inside a material 7 , or through the chemical bonds in molecules 8 , gives rise to effective exchange or dipolar magnetic interactions which offer the means to generate entanglement between spins 9,10,11 .</p>
        <p>The goal of this Review is to illustrate how the ability to design and control structures at the nanoscale enables the implementation of quantum coherent functionalities. We do so by describing a nonexhaustive set of practical examples, organized on the basis of the physical degrees of freedom (DOF) involved in the quantum dynamics: electrical charge in quantum dots; spins of electrons and nuclei associated with quantum dots, defects in insulators and semiconductors, atoms on surfaces, and magnetic molecules; photons emitted and detected by nanostructures; nanomechanical oscillators; and hybrid quantum systems involving coherent coupling between different DOFs. We note that quantum coherence is a natural and crucial aspect of the behaviour of trapped ions and cold atomic gases. However, since these systems do not require engineered nanostructures in order to harness their quantum properties, we shall not cover them in this nanoscience review.</p>
        <p>The degree of freedom of the electrical charge is undoubtedly the most crucial for today's information technologies, ranging from transistors for data processing to flash memories for long-term data storage. Therefore, we start our investigation into quantum-coherent nanoscience with the charge degree of freedom.</p>
        <p>Silicon transistor technology has fuelled the information processing revolution of the last fifty years, driven in large part by a reduction in device dimension that reached the realm of nanoscience (&lt; 100 nm) in commercial products in the early 2000's. The industry is now at the 7 nm node, producing devices with critical dimensions in the 10-40 nm range. At these length scales, confined electrons begin to exhibit quantum effects. While the transistors in today's processors are carefully designed to work around such quantum effects and operate as classical logic elements, the commercialization of electronic devices in the nanoscale creates future opportunities for fundamentally quantum-mechanical electronic devices. confinement and Coulomb interaction limit the number of electrons on the island -down to even a single electron. At cryogenic temperatures, the confined electron(s) exhibit discrete orbitals along with the electron spin degree of freedom. Due to their resemblance to natural atoms, quantum dot systems are often described as artificial atoms 1,13 . Charging effects are similarly observed in superconducting islands, where pairs of electrons called Cooper pairs can be added one at a time.</p>
        <p>Both individual electrons and Cooper pairs can exist in spatial superpositions on two separate islands 14,15 and coherently oscillate between them, forming the basis for a charge qubit 5,16 , see Fig. 1. Charge qubits have featured energy decay times exceeding 100 µs 17 , but due to ubiquitous charge noise, the dephasing is generally limited to below 1 µs with pronounced temporal and device-to-device variations. However, this strong interaction with the environment also enables charge qubits to become strongly coupled to other quantum degrees of freedom, resulting in excellent sensors as well as hybrid quantum systems 18,19 .</p>
        <p>For instance, the addition of a single electron charge to a quantum dot or donor is easily detected by a nearby electrometer and, in combination with spin-dependent tunnelling, also facilitates single-shot spin readout 20,21 . Redesigning superconducting charge qubits to suppress the impact of charge noise 22 -such that the phase rather than the charge degree of freedom dominates the behaviour -has reproducibly improved qubit coherence times of superconducting devices beyond 100 µs with gate times in the 10-50 ns range 23 . Recently, highly precise control of a circuit of 53 superconducting qubits was demonstrated; at this scale it is no longer feasible for a classical supercomputer to simulate the qubits' state 24 .</p>
        <p>The achievement of quantum-coherent manipulation and readout of individual spins in solids and molecules reinforces the promise of condensed-matter spins for applications in quantum information and quantum sensing. In terms of international research efforts, the coherent manipulation of spins comprises the largest part of quantum-coherent nanoscience. Systems currently under investigation include magnetic defects in insulators 25,26 and semiconductors 21,27,28 , spins in lithographically-defined quantum dots 29,30,31 , magnetic molecules 32,33,34 , and magnetic atoms on surfaces 6,35,36 . The intrinsic compactness of spin-based devices holds promise for dense integrated technologies and plays an important role in spatially-resolved quantum sensing. Conversely, the small inherent length scale results in challenges for controlling individual qubits and their interactions in quantum information technologies. electronic and nuclear spins. Nevertheless, a surprising variety of implementations based on oscillating magnetic or electric fields 12,13 as well as photonic sources 37 have been employed, see Box 2. Confining individual nuclear and electron spins such that they can be individually addressed as qubits (a term which we do not limit to quantum computation) requires devices with nanoscale dimensions.</p>
        <p>In addition to the formation of qubits and control of quantum-coherent states, the nanoscale plays a key role in the readout of spin states, which often requires integration in nanoscale electronic devices. This is particularly true for spin to charge conversion in quantum dots, dopants in semiconductors, and scanning tunnelling microscopy. In special cases, optical excitations and detection of single-spin states are possible, for example in the case of colour centres, e.g. nitrogen-vacancy in diamond 25,26,38 , or optically-active spin centres in silicon carbide 28 and in molecules designed for this purpose 34 .</p>
        <p>Quantum dots offer a quintessential example of a spin in a nanoscale system since an individual confined electron in such an artificial atom has a spin of S = ½ 29 . Alternatively, multiple electrons in different dots can be combined to have two-level quantum spaces amenable to electrical control 39,40 . The spin is much less sensitive to its microscopic environment than the charge qubits 13,30,31 , and coherence times up to tens of milliseconds 41 have been reported when using host materials such as 28 Si, which contains no nuclear spins. Using this platform, two-qubit logic gates 42 and simple two-qubit algorithms have already been implemented 43 , linear arrays of nine quantum dots can be controllably formed 44 and universal quantum logic with fidelity above 99% 45 , and entanglement between three electron spins 46 have been demonstrated. Four qubits in a 2x2 array have been controlled in a germanium-based platform 47 . Figure 2a,b shows an example of creating and controlling entangled states in quantum-dot spins, a key feature that unambiguously distinguishes quantum from classical behaviour 43 .</p>
        <p>Lithographically defined nanostructures also play a key role when controlling the quantum properties of individual dopants in a semiconductor. Typically, their spin degree of freedom is only weakly coupled to other excitations, making such spin qubits highly coherent. In isotopically-enriched 28 Si, dilute bulk 31 P donor electron spins can remain coherent for 10 seconds, and the nuclear spin for 3 hours 48 . In functional nanoelectronic devices with the infrastructure for qubit manipulation and readout, these values remain close to 1 second for the electron and 30 seconds for the nuclear spin 49 . Figure 2c,d shows such an example and illustrates that a two-qubit system consisting of one electron and one nuclear spin can be used to unequivocally demonstrate entanglement between these two qubits by violating the Bell's inequality 10 . Such entanglement has been extended to a system of two nuclei and one electron, wherein nuclear two-qubit gate fidelities exceed 99% 50 .</p>
        <p>The challenges in the exploitation of donor spins in semiconductors for quantum information lie almost entirely in the fabrication. A scalable quantum processor requires large arrays of controllably coupled qubits, demanding very tight fabrication protocols, or creative ways to introduce multi-qubit interactions.</p>
        <p>These scalability challenges are being tackled using two alternative approaches. The first is to push the fabrication tolerances to the sub-nanometre level, using scanning probe lithography. This method yields extremely precise placement of the donors, which typically aggregate in small clusters of 2-3 atoms 7 . The second method continues to develop the industry-standard ion implantation method, which leaves an inherent placement uncertainty of order 10 nm, but seeks to encode and manipulate the quantum information in a way that makes the system less sensitive to exact donor position 51 .</p>
        <p>Quantum-coherent measurements of spin states of individual defects in insulators were one of the initial drivers of quantum-coherent nanoscience, with the Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centre in diamond as the most prominent early contestant 52 . Initialization and read-out of the low-energy S = 1 spin states is achieved via resonant or non-resonant optical excitation 52 . In contrast to most other spin systems discussed here, this is even possible at room-temperature with good quantum coherence times. Due to the random placement of the defects, studying isolated qubits requires high dilution. However, these qubits are often coupled to nearby nuclear spins offering quantum-coherent control of multi-partite systems 53 . NV centres and related defects have become powerful quantum sensors with nanometre-scale spatial and very high electric and magnetic field resolution, see Fig. 3 c,d. Challenges in using NV centres as quantum sensors stem from the decay of the quantum coherence when they are brought close to a surface 54 , a requirement for achieving spatial resolution below 10nm. Progress is made, for example by using ion-beam lithography to place individual point defects in controlled positions with about 10 nanometre precision 55 .</p>
        <p>Atoms on clean surfaces offer yet another path towards controlling individual spins in solids. Recently, GHz-frequency electric fields between the tip and the sample in a Scanning Tunnelling Microscope (STM) were used to drive CW 35,36,56 and pulsed ESR 6 of single atoms, see Fig. 3a. While the access to spins on the atomic scale as offered in scanning probe microscopy has great benefits, this approach also has major disadvantages, such as the presence of conduction electrons tunnel-coupled to the spin. Every electron, even those that are inherent in the operation of the STM, gives rise to a loss of quantum coherence 57 . Thus, the quantum coherence time is presently limited to some 100ns (Fig. 3b) with gate operation times of about 10ns 6 . The detrimental effects of conduction electrons could be overcome by working with thick insulating films and very small tunnel currents.</p>
        <p>Self-assembly is the hallmark of chemistry, which yields parallel production of tuneable functional building blocks and integrated assemblies, which can be incorporated into nanoscale devices 32 . Molecular quantum nanoscience thus offers the enticing prospect of engineering structures to achieve intended functions at the smallest length scale possible. Early evidence of incoherent quantum tunnelling in molecular magnets stimulated theoretical and experimental work to push into the quantum coherent regime, exploiting magnetic molecules as components in quantum information technologies 8,58 . This motivated the design of magnetic molecules with coherence times of tens or hundreds 59 of microseconds at low temperatures and coherent spin dynamics persisting at room temperature 60 . Light 34 and electric fields 32,61 offer rapid manipulation of functional units and interconnects and may provide controls for implementing conditional classical or quantum information operations 62 .</p>
        <p>A major breakthrough came from measuring electrical transport on a single molecule incorporating a magnetic terbium atom, see Fig. 3e,f. Via a carefully crafted hierarchy of interactions between the itinerant electrons and the electronic and nuclear magnetic moments, it was possible to interrogate and manipulate the quantum state of the terbium nuclear spin 32 and thereby implement projective readout and simple quantum algorithms. The detrimental effect of conducting electrons is here reduced because they flow through the ligand and therefore only weakly perturb the metal ion's spin.</p>
        <p>Spins in condensed matter systems are not only the building blocks of potential devices and technologies, but also underpin intriguing emergent quantum phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity and spin liquids 63 . An outstanding challenge for quantum-coherent nanoscience is the fabrication of quantum simulators of 2D arrays of spins to simulate Hubbard models with a number of sites beyond the tractable limit of classical simulators, a limit that one could describe as Analog Quantum Advantage, in analogy with the quantum advantage term used in the context of digital quantum computing 24 . This is also an objective in ion and atom trap systems 64 . Steps in this direction have been taken, for instance, adatom spin chains realize 1D spin models 65,66 , though these can still be efficiently simulated classically using density matrix renormalization methods. Quantum simulators of Hubbard dimers and 4-site plaquettes have been fabricated using dopants 67 , spins on surfaces 68 , and quantum dots 69 , but the number of sites needs to increase to surpass simulations on classical computers.</p>
        <p>Photons have been a carrier of information for a long time -from the signal fires of ancient civilisations to the glass fibres of today's broadband internet -for very good reasons. Photons travel fast and have a high frequency, which allows high-rate information transfer. Furthermore, they largely do not interact, which makes them insensitive to electromagnetic interference and enables frequency multiplexing of data.</p>
        <p>In the age of quantum information, photons will have an even more important role to play: Quantum communication relies on the faithful emission and detection of single-photons 70 ; quantum networks require stationary qubits to be entangled with single-photons 71,72,73 ; and all-optical computers can operate much faster than their electronic counterparts when using optical transistors 74,75 . The challenges are how to produce single-photons on-demand with high purity 76 , how to detect them with high efficiency 77 , and how to make them interact with either a stationary qubit 78,79 or another photon 75 . To solve these challenges, we need to invoke nanoscale dimensions and quantum effects 80 .</p>
        <p>Optical photons have historically been produced by high temperatures, resulting in high numbers of photons with classical statistics that are unusable for quantum applications. The discrete energy levels in atoms, ions and molecules restrict photons to be emitted one-by-one, but trapping and holding a single atom or molecule can be a challenging task. Therefore, solid-state emitters -that are inherently stationary -have been studied as an alternative 81 . Atomistic defects in wide-bandgap semiconductors and 2D materials emit single-photons at high rates with low multi-photon probabilities 82,83 . The currently best performing single-photon emitters are self-assembled InGaAs quantum dots (QDs) embedded in a GaAs host matrix 76 . The small dimensions of 10-30 nm in lateral and 2-5 nm in vertical direction quantize the energy levels and provide the atom-like emission spectrum required for single-photon emission.</p>
        <p>Integrating these QDs into photonic cavities to further enhance the spontaneous emission rate and improve the collection efficiency 76,84 , in combination with resonant optical excitation to impede multiphoton emission, has led to photon extraction efficiencies of 60-80%, single-photon purities of 99% and indistinguishability of 97-99% 76 .</p>
        <p>The detection of single-photons relies on converting their energy into a measurable electrical signal, usually via a cascade or avalanche effect as in photo-multiplier-tubes and avalanche photodiodes. The more recently developed superconducting-nanowire single-photon detectors outperform earlier detectors in terms of spectral bandwidth (ultraviolet to mid-infrared), temporal resolution (&lt;10ps), dark counts (&lt;10/s) and quantum efficiency (&gt;90%) 77 . This is achieved using a superconducting nanowire of approximately 5x100nm cross-section that is biased close to the critical current. The absorption of a drop. Different geometries and materials, optical cavities to optimize the absorption cross-section, and cryogenic amplifiers have been used to enhance the performance of these detectors and tailor them to specific applications. Further developments include on-chip integration on devices 85 , photon number resolving detectors and 2D arrays 77 .</p>
        <p>Single-photon emission and detection rely on single emitters, quantum confinement, superconductivity and nanoscale dimensions, but they are predominantly based on incoherent effects. In order to create spin-photon entanglement or photonic switching, we do however require quantum-coherent interactions between photons, excitons and spins 80 . The challenge here is to enhance the photonic coupling beyond the losses and dissipation in the system. This is achieved by confining the photon to a photonic cavity with high cooperativity 79,86 , or by tailoring the photonic dispersion relation to slow them down and prolong their interaction time 87 . Recent achievements include the photon-mediated interaction between two SiV centres in a diamond nanocavity that is switchable via the electronic spin state 78 and the heralded storage of a photonic qubit via spin-photon entanglement in a similar system 79 . For semiconductor spin qubits, the coherent coupling to microwave photons in superconducting cavities is similarly advanced 88 . Finally, there is photon switching 75,78 , where a single-photon controls the transmission of a second incident photon through the coherent interaction of a quantum two-level system with a photonic cavity 75 . This allows the construction of optical transistors for building an all-optical computer 74 .</p>
        <p>The field of nanoscale quantum optics has seen huge progress over the last two decades 80 . Engineering of materials to supply bright, stable and coherent quantum emitters was as crucial as the availability of nanopatterning tools 72 . However, some of the current challenges on the way to realizing a quantum network are still related to samples and materials 71 . For example, state-of-the-art single-photon sources operate at near-infrared wavelengths just below 1µm, outside the telecom bands. QDs emitting at 1.3µm and 1.55µm exist but do not yet have the same performance, and wavelength conversion involves a loss in efficiency 76 ,81 . At the same time, material defects, surface roughness and fabrication defects can lead to enhanced dissipation and scattering of photons inside cavities and waveguides. This reduces the cooperativity of the quantum system -photon interaction, which is the key figure of merit for achieving coherent spin-photon coupling and photon-mediated spin-spin coupling as required for repeater nodes of quantum networks 71,78,79 . With increasing knowledge about material systems and improvements in fabrication processes these challenges can surely be tackled. Recent highly-integrated devices show us a glimpse of what will be possible in the future 72 ,85 .</p>
        <p>Mechanical degrees of freedom, despite the participation of large numbers of atoms, often more than 10 6 , can now routinely be observed and operated in the quantum regime. The quantum-coherent control of phononic excitations is of interest for many reasons, including fundamental studies of quantum mechanics and decoherence at increasingly large scales, quantum memories, quantum sensors, and quantum transducers. Their broad applicability in the field of quantum science is enabled by a combination of their extraordinarily high quality factors and versatile coupling to a variety of fields.</p>
        <p>Mechanical oscillators are ubiquitous in nature and in today's technologies, fuelling e.g. signal filtering in cell phones and gravitational wave sensing in the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). With their exquisite sensitivity 89,90,91 for force of aN/Hz 1/2 and mass of yg/Hz 1/2 , mechanical sensors can detect sub-proton masses 92 , the flip of a single electronic spin 93 , or the impact of a single photon 3 . Harnessing quantum mechanics in the operation of mechanical oscillators promises to enhance their performance, via e.g. quantum mechanical squeezing 94 or back action evasion 95 , while also opening up new horizons in the fields of quantum computing and networking. Controlled single phonon excitations can form on-chip quantum transducers that mediate quantum information between remote or dissimilar elements, such as spins and photons or microwave and optical photons 96 . This provides several advantages over nano-photonic links such as tighter confinement, stronger couplings, slower speeds, and less crosstalk. Further, the long lifetimes of quantum mechanical excitations are promising for the storage of quantum information.</p>
        <p>Mechanical resonators enter the quantum regime when the phonon occupation number, 𝑛𝑛 𝑚𝑚 of a particular mode approaches 1, necessitating 𝑘𝑘 𝐵𝐵 𝑇𝑇/ℎ𝑓𝑓 𝑚𝑚 → 1 where 𝑓𝑓 𝑚𝑚 is the mechanical oscillator's resonant frequency and 𝑇𝑇 is the oscillator mode's temperature. This requirement presents a significant challenge, as unlike optical photons, whose PHz-scale frequencies land them squarely in the quantum regime at room temperature, even the highest (~GHz-scale) frequency mechanical resonators see 𝑛𝑛 𝑚𝑚 ≫ 1 above dilution refrigerator temperatures. Over the last decade, several different approaches have succeeded in overcoming this challenge, ranging from cooling in a cryogenic environment 91,97 to laser cooling 98,99 . However, it still imposes a significant technical hurdle to mechanical resonators' operation in the quantum regime. Also critical for observing quantum behaviour is a high mechanical quality factor 𝑄𝑄, enabling a sufficiently low thermal decoherence rate 𝑘𝑘 𝐵𝐵 𝑇𝑇/ℏ𝑄𝑄, which characterizes the inverse time for one quantum to enter from the environment when the oscillator is in the ground state. Another important figure of merit is the 𝑄𝑄𝑓𝑓 𝑚𝑚 product, where 𝑄𝑄𝑓𝑓 𝑚𝑚 &gt; 𝑘𝑘 𝐵𝐵 𝑇𝑇/ℏ is the requirement for neglecting thermal decoherence over one mechanical oscillation cycle. An intensive investigation into material properties, resonator geometries, and mechanical loss mechanisms has resulted in huge leaps forward in Q-factor engineering, with Q's in excess of 5 × 10 10 and 𝑄𝑄𝑓𝑓 𝑚𝑚 products in excess of 2 × 10 20 being realized 4 .</p>
        <p>Mechanical oscillators of many different forms, sizes, and materials have been explored to address the wide variety of end goals envisioned with operation in the quantum regime 3 . Several notable developments in the engineering of nanoresonators have significantly sped up progress towards harnessing quantum phenomena. As one example, the discovery that strained SiN membranes with sub micrometer-scale thicknesses can exhibit very large Q-factor 100 while being easily coupled to a macroscopic optical cavity has enabled laser cooling to the quantum mechanical ground state 99 , observation of the quantum nature of the back action of light, see Fig. 5, and ponderomotive squeezing of light 101 . Optomechanical crystals 4 are another powerful nanoscale phonon-confining geometry that provides simultaneous strong confinement of high-Q, high frequency phononic modes and high-Q optical modes, as well as optomechanical coupling between the two DOF in a chip-scale integrated platform that can be realized in a variety of different materials. The high Qs arise from a separation in both real and frequency space of the resonator mode from other modes in the environment. The optomechanical coupling facilitates optical cooling and readout of the mechanics. Both SiN membranes and optomechanical resonators provide powerful platforms in which to realize quantum microwave-to-optical transduction, a key goal for quantum technologies, as well as long-lived mechanical quantum memories.</p>
        <p>Another exciting development in recent years is the idea of "soft-clamping", a technique that minimizes loss in stressed membrane-based resonators via dissipation dilution and strong mode confinement 102 .</p>
        <p>Mechanical oscillators make excellent sensors. Seminal experiments in 2004 used an ultrasensitive silicon nanocantilever to detect the magnetic field associated with a single electron spin via the dipolar magnetic force imparted to the cantilever 93 , and experiments continue to march towards mechanical detection of single nuclear spins. In another remarkable feat, carbon nanotube mechanical resonators were used to detect a yoctogram change in mass, equivalent to that of a single proton, via changes in the resonator's frequency 92 . As mechanical oscillators are pushed to better sensitivities, the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics looms large, imposing limits to their ultimate sensitivity. For instance, the so-called standard quantum limit (SQL) is an 'ordinary' limit that represents the optimal tradeoff between the precision of a measurement and the measurement's undesirable backaction. However, by clever quantum engineering, it is possible to break the SQL with approaches that include quantum nondemolition measurements 103 and utilization of quantum correlations in the noise. Using the latter technique, the SQL was recently experimentally broken in the measurement of a 20 nm thick SiN membrane resonator 104 by exploiting mechanically-induced quantum correlations in the spectrum of the light used to measure the oscillator. Another quantum-inspired sensitivity improvement invokes the concept of squeezing of the quantum mechanical noise. Squeezing of the mechanical motion of a micronscale mechanical resonator coupled to a microwave circuit was demonstrated in 2015 94 .</p>
        <p>Coupling mechanical oscillators to other quantum elements, such as spins 105 and atomic systems 106 , is another exciting frontier that provides a means towards generating quantum nonlinearities and distinctly non-classical states in mechanical resonators 3 . Further mechanical coupling to spins could allow spindriven cooling of the mechanics, mechanically-mediated squeezing of spins, and quantum transduction between localized spins and other quantum elements 107 .</p>
        <p>The previous sections gave an overview of how diverse degrees of freedom such as charge, spin, photons, and phonons are amenable to coherent quantum control and functionality at the nanoscale. Hybrid quantum systems 19,108 constitute, in a sense, the culmination of the quantum-coherent nanoscience program -a platform where different DOF coherently interact with each other.</p>
        <p>Transducing between DOF is often necessary to achieve basic functionalities such as measurement: for example, the quantum state of a single spin is extremely difficult to detect directly via its magnetic dipole 93 .</p>
        <p>Therefore, single-spin measurements require transduction to a charge for quantum dots 20 , dopants in semiconductors 21 , and surface atoms 6 , or to a photon for optically-active defects 25,109 , and molecules 34 . This transduction is accompanied by a large energy amplification, allowing detection with a classical apparatus, but destroys the coherence of the original quantum state.</p>
        <p>Here we focus on the case where the coherence is preserved. This enables the fundamental functionalities of transport and storage of quantum states. Quantum state transport typically involves two or more DOF, one of which is tightly localised, while the other is more spread out or travels through a guiding structure.</p>
        <p>Quantum state storage serves the reverse purpose, either by locally storing the quantum state of a moving DOF or by swapping the state from an easily accessible DOF to a more isolated one, where a coherent superposition can be preserved for longer times.</p>
        <p>The fundamental requirement for coherent hybrid systems is the existence of a coupling g between two DOF, with strength larger than the intrinsic dephasing rate 𝛾𝛾 of each DOF. Often, one of the DOF is of bosonic nature, such as a photon or a phonon, and is confined within a cavity. Here, the key parameter is the rate of loss or leakage 𝜅𝜅 out of the cavity 110 . The regime of coherent hybridization is achieved when the cooperativity 𝐶𝐶 = 𝑔𝑔 2 𝜅𝜅𝛾𝛾 ⁄ exceeds unity.</p>
        <p>The answer to `why nano?' is particularly subtle for hybrid quantum systems. The coupling 𝑔𝑔 is usually proportional to the relative volume shared by the different DOF. High 𝑔𝑔 can be achieved by confining to the nanoscale a bosonic mode to be coupled to an atomic-size object, or by increasing the footprint of the solid-state object, as in the case of superconducting qubits.</p>
        <p>The development of circuit-quantum electrodynamics (cQED) 110,111 gave a huge impetus to the field of hybrid quantum systems. The prototypical example is an engineered superconducting circuit whose charge state coherently couples to a photon in a microwave resonator. From the first Cooper-pair boxes coupled to planar resonators 112 to the millimetre-size transmons in bulk cavities 113 , the coupling strengths and coherence times have steadily improved, often by increasing the physical size of the systems far beyond the nanoscale. Notably, recent work incorporating van der Waals heterostructures with temporally coherent cQED architectures seeks to reduce this footprint 114 . Nonetheless, the nonlinearity provided by a nanoscale Josephson junction remains the key ingredient for this technology.</p>
        <p>Charge-photon hybridisation has also been achieved in semiconductor quantum dot systems. In the optical frequency range, strong coupling is routinely achieved between photons and atom-like levels in self-assembled quantum dots embedded in nanocavities 115 and, more recently, in SiV centres in diamond 79 . In the microwave regime, the size mismatch between the nanometre-scale of quantum dots and the millimetre-wavelength of the microwave photons requires exquisite material quality to minimize charge dephasing 𝛾𝛾, and benefits from careful engineering of the microwave resonators 116 , 117 . A high characteristic impedance 𝑍𝑍 𝑟𝑟 = �ℒ/𝒞𝒞 of the resonator maximises the zero-point quantum fluctuations of the cavity voltage 𝑉𝑉 𝑟𝑟𝑚𝑚𝑟𝑟 ∝ 𝜔𝜔 𝑟𝑟 /�𝑍𝑍 𝑟𝑟 and facilitates coupling to small electric dipoles. High-𝑍𝑍 𝑟𝑟 is achieved by making very narrow and thin (down to ∼ 10 nm) cavity wires to maximise the inductance 118 , or by inserting SQUID loops 119 .</p>
        <p>Direct magnetic coupling of a single spin to a microwave photon is even more challenging and has not yet been achieved. This hurdle is circumvented by integrating nanoscale ferromagnets that produce intense magnetic field gradients, introducing a coherent spin-charge coupling for electrons in quantum dots , 117,118 , see Fig. 6. This results in a coherent spin-photon coupling, mediated by the charge, i.e. a three-DOF hybrid system. Even a four-DOF hybrid has been built 119 , by connecting to the same microwave cavity a transmon and a spin qubit, the latter coupled to the cavity via its charge degree of freedom. A recent experiment demonstrated the detection of a single magnon in a ferromagnetic crystal by hybridising it with a transmon in a three-dimensional microwave cavity 120 .</p>
        <p>Building hybrid quantum systems requires balancing the contrasting requirements of high intrinsic coherence of the individual DOF with strong coupling between the DOF. Also, since the coupling is most often achieved when the DOF are in resonance, it is usually necessary to make at least one of the DOF individually tunable, which can open up channels for noise to disrupt the operation. The steady improvement in the cleanliness of materials and interfaces, and further developments in nanometre-scale lithography methods will bring an increasing number of physical systems within the realm of hybrid quantum systems.</p>
        <p>In this Review, we have described the coherent quantum phenomena that arise in different DOF, such as charge, spin, electromagnetic radiation, and mechanical motion. We have emphasised the importance of controlling matter and waves at the nanometre scale in order to increase quantisation energies, interaction strengths and coherence times, and unlock novel functionalities explicitly enabled by quantum mechanics.</p>
        <p>Paramount to any technological application of quantum-coherent nanoscience is the development of robust, reproducible, and scalable devices that can be built into larger-scale systems without compromising performance. Although we have organised our review along each type of DOF, the broader field of quantum coherent nanoscience can be further regrouped according to the manufacturing methods: "top-down" and "bottom-up".</p>
        <p>In the top-down method, quantum coherent devices are produced using the tools of nanofabrication developed for the semiconductor and superconductor nanoelectronic industry, where feature sizes approach the 10 nm scale. This is the pathway used for gate-defined quantum dots, ion-implanted dopants, and superconducting circuits. Top-down fabrication allows natural integration with classical nanoelectronics for control and readout, and scalable manufacturing. Addressing an increasing number of qubits might require breaking with the two-dimensional, planar architecture and moving the interconnects into the third dimension 121 . The challenge for this approach will be to maintain uniformity and quantum coherence as the devices become more complex and the fabrication scales to ever smaller dimensions.</p>
        <p>In the bottom-up method, quantum coherent devices are built upon the intrinsic quantum properties of atoms, molecules or point defects. At this atomic scale, the tools for top-down manufacturing can be ineffective because they are too coarse. Therefore, bottom-up manufacturing seeks to design components and interactions such that devices build themselves by directed self-assembly.</p>
        <p>Nanotechnologies building on the development of synthetic DNA 122 may offer the toolkit for these new construction paradigms. Integration of molecular qubits into such devices and electric field control 61,123 of the qubits are key challenges. Atomic spin qubits on surfaces have the advantage that they can be arranged into arbitrary nanostructures with atomic-scale precision 124 . Most urgently, methods need to be developed to coherently control multiple coupled surface qubits. Finally, point defects in solids have excellent quantum coherence, extending even to room temperature. This enables great performance as quantum sensors. In such systems, one of the next challenges lies in creating controllable interactions between large arrays of such defects, for example through hybrid quantum devices linking these spin qubits to optical or mechanical DOF.</p>
        <p>The coherent control of individual atoms and photons in vacuum 125 was the scientific breakthrough that led us into the second quantum revolution 126 . The scientific and technological program of quantumcoherent nanoscience consists of expanding this toolbox to harness quantum degrees of freedom within solid-state and molecular platforms built and controlled at the nanometre scale. In the coming years and decades, we expect quantum coherent nanoscience to make an impact in sensing and metrology applications, secure communications, quantum simulations, and universal quantum computing. Recent progress in this field has been tremendous and even cautious extrapolation into the near future promises exciting times with new discoveries and inventions. Spins in nanosystems are well protected from the environment, which gives rise to relatively long quantum coherence times. The corollary is that it is challenging to coherently control and measure individual spins. The first coherent control methods borrowed the primary driving mechanism from ensemble spin resonance and utilized oscillating magnetic fields (upper row: S electron spin, Bx magnetic field perpendicular to static field, IRF current at high angular frequency ω). However, it is often desirable to confine the driving on the nanometer length scale, which requires electric fields.</p>
