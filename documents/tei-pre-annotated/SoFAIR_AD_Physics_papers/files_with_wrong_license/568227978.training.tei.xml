        <p>Context. ESPRESSO is the new high-resolution spectrograph of ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT). It was designed for ultra-high radial-velocity (RV) precision and extreme spectral fidelity with the aim of performing exoplanet research and fundamental astrophysical experiments with unprecedented precision and accuracy. It is able to observe with any of the four Unit Telescopes (UTs) of the VLT at a spectral resolving power of 140 000 or 190 000 over the 378.2 to 788.7 nm wavelength range; it can also observe with all four UTs together, turning the VLT into a 16 m diameter equivalent telescope in terms of collecting area while still providing a resolving power of 70 000. Aims. We provide a general description of the ESPRESSO instrument, report on its on-sky performance, and present our Guaranteed Time Observation (GTO) program along with its first results. Methods. ESPRESSO was installed on the Paranal Observatory in fall 2017. Commissioning (on-sky testing) was conducted between December 2017 and September 2018. The instrument saw its official start of operations on October 1, 2018, but improvements to the instrument and recommissioning runs were conducted until July 2019. Results. The measured overall optical throughput of ESPRESSO at 550 nm and a seeing of 0.65 exceeds the 10% mark under nominal astroclimatic conditions. We demonstrate an RV precision of better than 25 cm s -1 during a single night and 50 cm s -1 over several months. These values being limited by photon noise and stellar jitter shows that the performance is compatible with an instrumental precision of 10 cm s -1 . No difference has been measured across the UTs, neither in throughput nor RV precision. Conclusions. The combination of the large collecting telescope area with the efficiency and the exquisite spectral fidelity of ESPRESSO opens a new parameter space in RV measurements, the study of planetary atmospheres, fundamental constants, stellar characterization, and many other fields.Context.

        <p>High-resolution spectroscopy enables key physical insight into the study of stars, galaxies, and interstellar and intergalactic media. High precision and high dispersion have emerged in recent years as crucial elements in the spectroscopy of faint objects, which called in turn for the use of larger telescopes to increase the photon-collecting area. Furthermore, many science cases require repeatable observations over a long temporal baseline. For instance, the HARPS spectrograph at the ESO 3.6 m telescope has established itself as a pioneering instrument for radial-velocity (RV) measurements (Mayor et al. 2003) because of its ultra-high precision, as well as its operational efficiency and continuous availability on a medium-size telescope.High-resolution spectroscopy enables key physical insight into the study of stars, galaxies, and interstellar and intergalactic media.

        <p>The search for and characterization of terrestrial planets in the habitable zone (HZ) of their parent stars will be one of the most exciting science topics of the coming decades and one of the main science drivers for the new generation of space missions and extremely large telescopes. These goals rely on the definition of a suitable target list that has been cleaned of false positives and is filled with good targets for follow-up and characterization. There is a gap between past observations and surveys with small-and medium-size telescopes (&lt;4 m diameter) and the target-focused observations on future large facilities (e.g., the Extremely Large Telescope; ELT), which can and must be filled by the optimum use of new instruments on currently accessible 10-m class telescopes.The search for and characterization of terrestrial planets in the habitable zone (HZ) of their parent stars will be one of the most exciting science topics of the coming decades and one of the main science drivers for the new generation of space missions and extremely large telescopes.

        <p>Another aspect that must be considered is the fast evolution of the field from exoplanet search to exoplanet characterization. A sudden change was induced by space-based transit searches such as CoRoT and Kepler. The latter in particular started delivering thousands of transiting candidates that had to be confirmed, and, more importantly, for which we were lacking mass measurements. This situation emphasized the synergy between RVs and transit observations, and thus the need for ground-based RV follow-up in view of better understanding the internal structure and composition of exoplanets. Unfortunately, most of the transiting candidates delivered by Kepler are too faint for RV followup with small and medium-size telescopes, and they are "even fainter" when attempts are made at observing planetary atmospheres by the means of ground-based transit spectroscopy.Another aspect that must be considered is the fast evolution of the field from exoplanet search to exoplanet characterization.

        <p>These facts were recognized by the ESO-ESA working group report on extrasolar planets in 2005, which emphasized the need for HARPS-like instruments on large telescopes (Perryman et al. 2005). Simultaneously, the idea of a HARPS-like instrument for the Very Large Telescope (VLT) was directly derived from the CODEX project (Pasquini et al. 2005;Molaro et al. 2006;Molaro 2009), a phase-A study for the development of an ultrahigh-precision spectrograph for the European ELT that was presented by Pasquini et al. (2009) in 2007 at the conference Science with the VLT in the ELT Era. Following this idea, ESO's Scientific Technical Committee (STC) recommended the development of second-generation VLT instruments in October 2007, and this proposal was endorsed by the ESO Council in December of the same year. Among others, a high-resolution, ultra-stable spectrograph for the VLT combined-Coudé focus was suggested. Following these recommendations, ESO issued a call in March 2008 for proposals to carry out the Phase-A study for such an instrument driven by three main science cases: "(1) detection and characterization of rocky planets in the HZ; (2) study of the variability of fundamental constants; and (3) analysis of the chemical composition of stars in nearby galaxies". The proposal submitted by the ESPRESSO Consortium1 was accepted by ESO and the consortium was selected to carry out the construction of this spectrograph in collaboration with ESO as a partner. In exchange for funding and building the instrument, the ESPRESSO Consortium was awarded 273 nights of Guaranteed Time Observation (GTO) in order to pursue part of the science cases described above.These facts were recognized by the ESO-ESA working group report on extrasolar planets in 2005, which emphasized the need for HARPS-like instruments on large telescopes (Perryman et al. 2005).

        <p>The project kick-off was held in February 2011, and the design phase ended with the final design review in May 2013. The procurement of components and manufacturing of subsystems took roughly three years, considerably longer than originally planned. Integration started in early 2016 with the first subsystem, the large vacuum vessel, in the integration hall of the Geneva Observatory, which overlapped with the procurement phase of other subsystems in the various consortium partner institutes. Assembly, integration, and verification (AIV) was completed with the Provisional Acceptance Europe (PAE) in June 2017. In parallel to the procurement and AIV phase of the spectrograph in Europe, the unexploited Combined-Coudé Laboratory (CCL) of the VLT was cleared and equipped with an air-conditioned environment to accept the ESPRESSO spectrograph. A considerable effort was devoted by the Consortium and ESO to equip all the Unit Telescopes (UTs) of the VLT with the so-called Coudé-Train (CT), an ensemble of optics, mechanics, and control units to route the light from each UT through the "incoherent" Coudépath and the tunnels to the CCL, where it can be either combined to use ESPRESSO in the 4-UT configuration or individually selected to feed the spectrograph in its one-UT configuration. Both the CCL (2015CCL ( -2016) ) and the CT (October 2016) had been commissioned by the PAE and were ready to welcome the spectrograph, even though some UT branches of the CT would have to be commissioned and realigned later on during the commissioning of the spectrograph. The spectrograph was shipped from Geneva to Paranal in summer 2017.The project kick-off was held in February 2011, and the design phase ended with the final design review in May 2013.

        <p>During fall 2017, the on-site reassembly in the CCL started, followed by the integration with the CT. The CT had been commissioned to verify all interfaces, functionalities, and performance, especially with respect to telescope selection, optical path configuration, telescope presetting, pointing, acquisition, tracking, and guiding. ESPRESSO required on-sky configuration and testing on each of the UTs individually in the 1-UT configuration and on all four UTs together in the 4-UT configuration. The commissioning plan and strategy was adapted to scheduling requirements, and the commissioning runs were performed on the dates reported in Table 1.During fall 2017, the on-site reassembly in the CCL started, followed by the integration with the CT.

        <p>First light of ESPRESSO in the 1-UT configuration took place on November 27, 2017, the date on which the official ESPRESSO commissioning started (ESO Release eso1739). This commissioning run was followed by others in January, February, April, and July 2018. During these runs, all modes of ESPRESSO (including the 4-UT configuration) were tested "on sky" and characterized. First light in the 4-UT configuration took place during the January 2018 run in the presence of ESO's director general (ESO Release eso1806). The simultaneous use of the four UTs implies a great complexity of the control system. Despite this, all processes -communication with the telescopes, configuration of the instrument in this new mode, slewing and pointing of the telescopes, acquisition of the target on all the telescopes, guiding, and exposing -were carried out without failure and produced, on the first attempt, the first visible high-resolution spectrum of an astronomical target obtained with the collecting area of a 16 m diameter telescope equivalent.First light of ESPRESSO in the 1-UT configuration took place on November 27, 2017, the date on which the official ESPRESSO commissioning started (ESO Release eso1739).

        <p>Minor improvements on hardware and software were performed in parallel to the commissioning phase, but the instrument demonstrated excellent operational performance and reliability from the beginning. While RV and stability requirements were essentially met, optical throughput suffered an unexpected deficiency. For this reason, the spectrograph was reopened and individual elements were optically tested in September 2018. It was found that the main culprit was the fiber link, but it was neither possible nor suitable to perform corrective actions on the spot because throughput and RV precision in the 1-UT configuration were satisfactory and the instrument was about to start operations. Two additional nights of 4-UT commissioning period took place in December 2018 in order to perform general functional and preliminary performance tests.Minor improvements on hardware and software were performed in parallel to the commissioning phase, but the instrument demonstrated excellent operational performance and reliability from the beginning.

        <p>The official start of operations in 1-UT configuration took place on October 1, 2018, the date on which ESPRESSO was offered by ESO both to the community for open-time observations and to the ESPRESSO Consortium for GTO. During the first semester of operations, and in view of the start of operations in the 4-UT configuration by April 2019, the spare fiber link was sent back to Europe, repaired, and upgraded. Laboratory tests at the Osservatorio Astronomico di Brera in Merate immediately showed that an improvement in throughput was within reach. After returning the spare fiber link to Paranal, the component was installed and tested on the instrument in June 2019. This major intervention required a partial recommissioning of the 1-UT configuration and completion of the 4-UT configuration commissioning. Both were conducted successfully, despite bad weather conditions, from July 3 to 8, 2019. By July 9, 2019, the instrument could be considered to be in its final configuration and fully operational. No changes were made after this date apart from developing and implementing a new instrument mode -the HR42 mode, which is a standard-resolution mode with heavier binning and slow readout speed -with the aim of pushing the readout noise (RON) limited magnitude range to fainter magnitudes. While the practical implementation of this mode in the instrument software turned out to be straightforward, the adaptation of the data reduction software demanded quite a bit of effort due to the different spectral format.The official start of operations in 1-UT configuration took place on October 1, 2018, the date on which ESPRESSO was offered by ESO both to the community for open-time observations and to the ESPRESSO Consortium for GTO.

        <p>ESPRESSO is a fiber-fed, cross-dispersed, high-resolution echelle spectrograph located in the CCL at the incoherent focus of the VLT, where it can be fed by the light of either one UT (1-UT configuration) or all four UTs (4-UT configuration). In each of its configurations, two fibers illuminate the spectrograph: One fiber carries the light from the science target, and the second carries either the light from the sky background (7 away) or the light from a reference source for simultaneous drift measurements. A detailed description of the instrument and all its subsystems is given in Pepe et al. (2014), Mégevand et al. (2014), González Hernández et al. (2018), and references therein. The control software (CS) and electronics are described more specifically in Calderone et al. (2016Calderone et al. ( , 2018)), Baldini et al. (2016). An overview of the scientific software and the description of its flow and products are presented in Sect. 3.3.

        <p>The telescope light is brought to the CCL via the CT (Fig. 1). The CT is an all-optical system of prisms, mirrors, and lenses that guide the light from the Nasmyth focus through the elevation axis, the telescope structure, and the azimuth axis to the Coudé room (basement) of the specific telescope. There, the beam is bent and launched through the incoherent tunnels to the CCL, where the light passes through an atmospheric dispersion compensator (ADC). A detailed description of the highly complex CT can be found in Cabral et al. (2013Cabral et al. ( , 2014Cabral et al. ( , 2019)). Its installation and alignment (Avila et al. 2016) represented a considerable share of the overall project effort, but it was necessary to transform ESPRESSO into the first (and only) instrument able to make use of the incoherent focus of the VLT, as such converting the VLT into the largest collecting-area optical telescope currently available.The telescope light is brought to the CCL via the CT (Fig. 1).

        <p>In the CCL, the front end (FE) shapes and collects the light beams from one to four telescopes. Its design is described in Pepe et al. (2014) and Riva et al. (2014a). The FE is composed of four units, one per telescope, each of which serve H Fig. 1. Optical light path of the CT from the Nasmyth platform to the CCL. P4 to P7 are folding prisms that route the beam from the Nasmyth platform to the telescope's Coudé room. The mirrors R8 and R9 form a periscope that redirects the beam into the tunnel. At the entrance and the exit of the tunnel, respectively, the two lenses L10 and L11 recondition the light beam so it can enter the FE unit inside the CCL with a specified F-number (fixed for all telescopes). Two counter-rotating double prisms, ADC12, eventually correct for atmospheric dispersion across the wide spectral range of the spectrograph. This figure is from Pepe et al.

        <p>One important role of the FE is to perform field stabilization (or secondary guiding) that corrects for the tip-tilt motion of the star not corrected by the primary stabilization of the telescope or introduced along the optical path of the CT at frequencies &lt;10 Hz. The images acquired by the field-stabilization camera are analyzed by a control loop to: determine the difference in position of the stellar image with regard to that of the fiber entrance; compute the error; and apply the correction to the tip-tilt mirror. This system both optimizes slit efficiency and avoids RV effects due to off-centered light injection (Pepe et al. 2002).One important role of the FE is to perform field stabilization (or secondary guiding) that corrects for the tip-tilt motion of the star not corrected by the primary stabilization of the telescope or introduced along the optical path of the CT at frequencies &lt;10 Hz.

        <p>The light from various calibration sources can be injected through the FE in any of the fibers in order to perform orderdefinition and spectral flat-fielding (white light), wavelength calibration (absolute spectral reference), and drift measurement (stable spectral source) in simultaneous-reference mode (Mayor et al. 2003;Pepe et al. 2002). The white light consists of the laser-driven light source (LDLS) EQ-99X from Energetiq. Wavelength calibration is obtained by combining ThAr-lamp spectra with a white-light illuminated Fabry-Pérot. The former provides accuracy, and the latter delivers a high number of uniform spectral emission lines across the whole spectrum that ensure "local" wavelength precision (see Sect. 3.3.2 as well as Cersullo et al. 2019 and references therein). All these sources are coupled with optical fibers to two calibration units (Mégevand et al. 2014), one for each fiber channel of the spectrograph. The calibration units have the functionality of attenuating the light of the calibration source and redirecting it through another optical fiber to the corresponding FE unit.The light from various calibration sources can be injected through the FE in any of the fibers in order to perform orderdefinition and spectral flat-fielding (white light), wavelength calibration (absolute spectral reference), and drift measurement (stable spectral source) in simultaneous-reference mode (Mayor et al. 2003;Pepe et al. 2002).

        <p>A laser frequency comb (LFC) is also available and should have replaced both the ThAr lamp and the Fabry-Pérot (Pasquini &amp; Hubin 2018;Frank et al. 2018;Huke et al. 2018); however, due to a lack of reliability and limited spectral coverage, it is currently not integrated in the operational scheme. At the time of writing, it is still unclear when the LFC will become operational. It must be noted that, given the currently limited wavelength range, the LFC will not be used alone for complete wavelength calibration. This situation might compromise the ability of ESPRESSO to guarantee RV repeatability at the 10 cm s -1 -level over years, since the wavelength calibration will have to rely on hollow-cathode lamps.A laser frequency comb (LFC) is also available and should have replaced both the ThAr lamp and the Fabry-Pérot (Pasquini &amp; Hubin 2018;Frank et al. 2018;Huke et al. 2018); however, due to a lack of reliability and limited spectral coverage, it is currently not integrated in the operational scheme.

        <p>At the back of each of the two pinholes in the mirror, relay optics re-image the light entering the pinholes onto two octagonal fibers, the target fiber and the reference fiber (for simplicity, called fiber A and B, respectively, hereafter). Each fiber individually carries the light to the double scrambler, which is mounted on the vacuum vessel. The main functionality of the double scrambler is to convert the far-field of the incoming optical fiber into the near field, and vice versa, while injecting the beam into a second section of an identical fiber. This system ensures, in combination with the use of octagonal fibers, a homogeneous and stable illumination of the spectrograph, which is fundamental for repeatable RV measurements (Chazelas et al. 2010(Chazelas et al. , 2012;;Cosentino et al. 2012). The double scrambler also integrates a vacuum window that provides the optical vacuum feedthrough of the scientific light. The exposure shutters, one for each mode, are installed on the air-side of the feedthrough within the double scrambler mechanics. In the 4-UT configuration, the double scrambler also has the task of combining the light from the four fibers of each channel, A and B, from the four telescopes into one single square-shaped fiber for each channel (Gracia Temich et al. 2018b). All the fibers from the scrambler are then routed to the focal plane of the spectrograph to form a single entrance "slit" (see the right-hand side of Fig. 4). The two fibers, A and B, of each mode are aligned vertically along the cross-dispersion direction, while all A and all B fibers are arranged side-by-side horizontally along the main-dispersion direction. The three separate exposure shutters for the three modes ensure that only one mode feeds the spectrograph at a time. The fiber-link design was based on the concepts originally developed for HARPS and HARPS-N (Cosentino et al. 2012;Lo Curto et al. 2015) and was adapted to ESPRESSO with its various observing and instrument modes (Mégevand et al. 2014).At the back of each of the two pinholes in the mirror, relay optics re-image the light entering the pinholes onto two octagonal fibers, the target fiber and the reference fiber (for simplicity, called fiber A and B, respectively, hereafter).

        <p>The light of the fibers entering the spectrograph is dispersed, and the spectra are imaged through two different camera arms, a red and a blue one, onto two distinct detectors. First, an anamorphic pupil slicing unit (APSU, Riva et al. 2014b;Oggioni et al. 2016) shapes the beam in order to reduce the size of the spectrograph optics; without the APSU, the size of the echelle grating would have to be 60 × 240 cm to achieve the desired spectral resolution. Instead, the APSU slices and superimposes the produced half-pupils in the main dispersion direction, while in the other direction it anamorphically compresses the beam by a factor of 3. The collimator, an off-axis parabola used in double pass, collimates the beam to a rectangular shape of 20×30 cm that matches the 20 × 120 cm physical surface of the 76 • (R4) echelle mosaic (Lizon et al. 2018). A dichroic beamsplitter placed before the intermediate spectrum sends the light to the blue and the red channels. For each channel, a specific (spherical) transfer collimator re-images the white pupil of the echelle grating onto the cross-dispersers, a volume-phase holographic (VPH) grating (Arns 2016). Two camera lenses eventually focus the blue and red portions of cross-dispersed echelle spectra separately, each onto its own large CCD detector.The light of the fibers entering the spectrograph is dispersed, and the spectra are imaged through two different camera arms, a red and a blue one, onto two distinct detectors.

        <p>Compared to a classical UVES-like white pupil design, ESPRESSO uses several design innovations: (1) By adjusting the power of the red field lens and the blue field mirror at the intermediate focal planes (white spectrum), the field curvature is compensated, thus avoiding the need for a cylindrical field lens in front of the detector. (2) The transfer collimator is a tilted sphere with a focal length much shorter than the main collimator; this significantly reduces the beam size on the cross-dispersers (asymmetric white pupil). ( 3) By adjusting the tilt angle of the spherical mirrors and deliberately operating the VPH cross-disperser in a non-collimated beam, aberrations introduced by the main collimator are compensated for, with the exception of the residual spherical aberration that is corrected for in the camera lenses. ( 4) A prism cemented to the VPH lifts the residual 1:1.5 anamorphism and returns a square beam. Furthermore, it compresses the spectral orders in the cross-dispersion direction by the same factor (1.5), reducing spatial sampling and needed CCD space. (5) The camera lenses each consist of only three lenses of inexpensive glass, the last of which is used as the cryostat window.

        <p>Thanks to the use of a pupil slicer, the spectrograph delivers two simultaneous spectra of the light from the two fibers in a wavelength range between 378.2 and 788.7 nm and at a resolving power reaching R &gt; 190 000 in the UHR mode and R ∼ 140 000 in the HR mode, the two instrument modes available in the 1-UT configuration. In the 4-UT configuration, also called MR mode, that combines the light collected by all the UTs, the same wavelength range is covered, but the increased etendue of the telescope comes at the price of a larger input fiber and thus a reduced resolving power of R ∼ 70 000. This value is nevertheless remarkable and exceptional, considering that ESPRESSO is the first optical spectrograph working with a 16 m diameter equivalent telescope.Thanks to the use of a pupil slicer, the spectrograph delivers two simultaneous spectra of the light from the two fibers in a wavelength range between 378.2 and 788.7 nm and at a resolving power reaching R &gt; 190 000 in the UHR mode and R ∼ 140 000 in the HR mode, the two instrument modes available in the 1-UT configuration.

The exposure meter produces a low-resolution spectrum and records the light entering the spectrograph in blue, green, and red channels for the two spectrograph-fiber channels independently. The exposure meter allows us to not only monitor the efficiency of the instrument, but also record the flux of the astronomical target and, as such, precisely compute the flux-weighted mean time of exposure (MTE); this, in turn, is used to determine the precise value of the Earth's barycentric velocity along the line of sight for which the recorded spectrum must be corrected for (Landoni et al. 2014).In order to track the flux entering the spectrograph in real time, and thus monitor the instantaneous efficiency, the part of the spectrograph beam that would fall outside the clear aperture of the spectrograph is collected within the APSU by a flat mirror with a central hole (pupil stop for the spectrograph).

        <p>ESPRESSO is designed for an extreme RV precision of 10 cm s -1 , which requires a perfect control of the metrological stability of the spectrograph. This extreme stability, which corresponds to a physical shift of the spectrum in the focal plane of the spectrograph by a few nanometers, cannot be achieved passively, and the physical parameters ruling it must be permanently controlled, or at least monitored. ESPRESSO therefore applies the "simultaneous-reference" technique (Mayor et al. 2003;Pepe et al. 2002), where the second fiber, B, can be fed with a spectral reference instead of the sky light and is used to track possible residual instrumental drifts down to the requested RV precision level. The simultaneous reference is only needed when the (photonic) RV error achieved on the scientific target is expected to be comparable to or lower than the typical instrumental drifts on the order of m s -1 . Consequently, the simultaneous-reference technique is applied for bright objects and when high RV precision is aimed at. For faint targets, the second fiber is fed with sky light so that sky background can be measured and subtracted.ESPRESSO is designed for an extreme RV precision of 10 cm s -1 , which requires a perfect control of the metrological stability of the spectrograph.

For some representative diffraction orders of the echelle spectrograph, we provide the central wavelength (CW) in the middle of the order, the start and end wavelength of the FSR, and the start and end wavelength of the total (extracted) spectral range (TSR). Additionally, the spectral size of a physical detector pixel (resolution bin) located in the center of the order is given.

A view of the secondaryguiding panel can be seen in the lower part of Fig. 5. The maximum correction frequency is 10 Hz, but the actual speed depends on the magnitude of the target. The secondary-guiding system also provides pupil stabilization. However, given the excellent stability of the pupil, this correction is not performed during observations. The observation consists of one or more exposures (integrations) on the same target, ending in the readout and storage of the raw individual frames. The observation is assisted by the exposure meter, which measures the flux entering the fiber in real time and computes the flux-weighted MTE.</p>
        <p>Operation in the 4-UT configuration is very similar to that in the 1-UT configuration. While in the 1-UT configuration the observing software dispatches instructions to the selected UT and ESPRESSO, in the 4-UT configuration it simultaneously sends instructions to the four UTs as well as the instrument. Presetting and target acquisition is done on all four UTs simultaneously. After this step, one needs to center the target of every UT on the specific fiber located inside the corresponding FE unit. This step is performed sequentially, moving the star's position on the focal plane of the fiber by offsetting the telescope. Once the target is centered and the secondary guiding is activated and stable for every telescope, the exposure is started. During the exposure, all four FE units, including the respective ADCs and secondary guiding, are active and independent. A screenshot of the field-stabilization panel in the 4-UT configuration is shown in Fig. 6.Operation in the 4-UT configuration is very similar to that in the 1-UT configuration.

        <p>The main instrument characteristics in the various observing configurations and instrument modes are summarized in Table 3. An ESPRESSO user can choose from two observing modes: the 1-UT configuration (one single telescope, any of the UTs) or the 4-UT configuration6 (all UTs simultaneously). In the 1-UT configuration, four different instrument modes exist. In HR mode, the light is collected using (octagonal) fibers with projected sky diameters of 1 . This mode is intended for spectroscopy and RV monitoring. Three different detector readout modes offer optimized solutions depending on the target magnitude. In case of bright targets (HR11, 1 × 1 binning), the detector will be saturated quickly and the exposure time therefore has to be short. Overheads are reduced by a faster readout and the dynamic range is maximized by avoiding binning. Given the high signal level expected for a bright star, the higher RON is acceptable. For faint or very faint objects, the HR21 (2 × 1 binning) or HR42 (4 × 2 binning) should be used instead. The difference between these two modes is that the total RON per spectral bin is further reduced in the HR42 mode, and the limiting magnitude, at which the noise starts to be dominated by the detector RON, is improved. This gain comes at the cost of a slightly reduced resolving power since the resulting pixel sampling gets close to the Nyquist limit. This is especially the case on the blue side of the longest (reddest) echelle orders, where the anamorphic de-magnification reduces the size of the projected slit (fiber entrance) and thus the sampling. At the very blue end of the reddest echelle order, the sampling of the HR42 mode (worst case) is reduced by 30% (i.e., to about 1.7 pixels). Finally, the UHR11 mode delivers the highest resolving power, but the required use of a 0.5 diameter fiber leads to reduced spectral sampling and higher slit losses. Due to the latter issue, A96, page 8 of 26 this mode is particularly suitable for ultra-high-resolution observations on relatively bright targets.The main instrument characteristics in the various observing configurations and instrument modes are summarized in Table 3.

        <p>It must be noted that the pixel sampling given in Table 3 for the individual modes refers to the value expected at the center of an extracted echelle order. This value remains constant across all orders and over both detectors, as does also the resolution bin (pixel) size expressed in m s -1 , which results from a typical feature of cross-dispersed echelle spectrographs. Another very elegant characteristic of echelle spectrographs, when used in Littrow condition, is that the resolution bin size (again expressed in m s -1 or ∆λ/λ) remains essentially constant along the echelle order since the anamorphic effect on the projected slit (fiber) size and the variation of linear dispersion compensate almost perfectly. Finally, our design choice of oversizing the detector in order to extract at least 20% more than the FSR of the longest (reddest) orders (see Fig. 4) leads to the third elegant feature of echelle spectrographs: by summing up the flux of a given wavelength recorded at the edges of two subsequent echelle orders, one recovers almost the same number of photoelectrons as for wavelengths located close to the blaze (center) of the echelle order. This means that after extracting and merging the orders, the detection efficiency obtained at a given wavelength is close to constant. For all these reasons, we will describe hereafter the measured signal (and S/N) as the value obtained at the center of the order and for a given extracted pixel (resolution bin), under the motivated assumption that this value varies only by a small amount along the echelle order.It must be noted that the pixel sampling given in Table 3 for the individual modes refers to the value expected at the center of an extracted echelle order.

        <p>By design, the 4-UT observing configuration is intended for spectroscopy of very faint targets. The lower resolution is a price to pay for the usage of an equivalently wider (square) fiber in the spectrograph that can carry the light of the four telescopes. Collecting the light from the four telescopes reduces the contribution of detector readout and (partially) dark noise when adequate slit configurations and binning levels are adopted. The two instrument modes MR42 (4 × 2 binning) and MR84 (8 × 4 binning) therefore enable very low S/N spectroscopy and the study of fast transient events.By design, the 4-UT observing configuration is intended for spectroscopy of very faint targets.

        <p>The observations are prepared using the usual P2 tool7 . On top of allowing the user to select from all the possible instrument configurations and defining observational constraints, it provides advanced functionalities such as target data retrieval from the SIMBAD database, definition of "blind offset" from nearby stars, and monitoring of the field scanned by the reference fiber when in simultaneous sky mode. For the computation of the exposure time and the expected S/N and RV precision, the user is referred to the ESPRESSO ETC 8 . We shall nevertheless provide a benchmark: in a 1 min integration in HR11 on a K2 star with V = 8 mag observed at an airmass of 1 and under median seeing conditions of 0.8 , an S /N ∼ 115 at blaze and per extracted pixel (or resolution bin) of 0.486 km s -1 is reached. This corresponds to a gain of about two magnitudes with respect to HARPS at the 3.6 m telescope. By using the relation between S/N and RV precision derived for nonrotating G and K dwarfs, one estimates that this S/N delivers a photon-noise limited RV precision of about 50 cm s -1 . Further details are available in Sect. 4.1.4. An option available to the observer is the use of fiber B. ESPRESSO provides two mutually exclusive possibilities: The user can either illuminate fiber B with a simultaneous spectral reference to measure the instrument's internal drift or to use it to independently measure the sky background. In the first option, the secondary fiber is illuminated by the Fabry-Pérot light. The many spectral lines are used to measure and correct for the minute-scale motions of the spectra on the CCDs induced by the short-term variations of pressure and temperature inside the spectrograph and the detector. This option becomes important when one wants to achieve an RV precision similar to or better than the intrinsic stability of the instrument over the timescale of a night of about 1 m s -1 rms. If one aims at on-target RV photon-noise precision better than this value, then it is recommended to use the simultaneous reference. Conversely, if this precision is not required, or one wants to perform any kind of measurement for which sub-m s -1 precision is not needed (e.g., transmission spectroscopy), then the use of the simultaneous reference is not necessary. In fact, in the latter case, and when high spectral fidelity observations are desired, one needs instead to consider the contribution of the sky background. During solar activity minima and in a region of the sky devoid of starlight or moonlight, the V-band magnitude of sky spectra as seen through a 1 fiber is still of V = 20-21 mag. In the presence of a full Moon and thin clouds, the sky brightness can increase by many magnitudes. If we consider this, then it becomes clear that moonlight contamination may become an issue for precise RV measurements even at magnitudes as low as V ≤ 11 mag (see e.g., Cunha et al. 2013or Roy et al. 2020). It is therefore recommended to use fiber B to measure the sky background for "faint" targets. The numbers and magnitudes provided here are only a general guideline.

        <p>The ESPRESSO DFS concept (Di Marcantonio et al. 2018) was conceived during its preliminary design phases with the goal of maximizing operational efficiency, flexibility, and scientific output while complying with the standard Paranal Observatory operational scheme. The main challenge derives from the requirement to operate ESPRESSO in a seamless way with any of the UT's or with all four UT's simultaneously. This must be possible not only with a predetermined schedule, but also "on the fly". The flexibility in ESPRESSO's operations has been tackled by adopting a new DFS deployment plan described in Di Marcantonio et al. (2018) that is exceptional under various aspects because it has to cope with various telescope and instrument configurations while remaining operationally simple. Figure 8 shows the main ESPRESSO DFS elements and their final deployment. Besides the software packages already described, part of the software for the control of the CT devices has been incorporated into the VLT telescope CS to allow CT operations even when ESPRESSO is offline (thus avoiding conflicts, e.g., with instruments of the VLT Interferometer operations). In addition to the standard DFS software packages, ESPRESSO is the first instrument to also provide a data analysis A96, page 9 of 26 A&amp;A 645, A96 (2021) Notes.

        <p>The ESPRESSO DRS builds on a vast heritage of data reduction techniques and software. On the scientific side, it represents the next generation of a series of pipelines that started with the ELODIE spectrograph in the early 1990s (Baranne et al. 1996), then followed by CORALIE (Queloz et al. 2000;Pepe et al. 2002),

        <p>On the implementation side, the 
            <rs type="software">ESPRESSO</rs> pipeline is based on a software framework imposed by ESO on all VLT instrument pipelines, namely the Common Pipeline Library (CPL), a C-based toolkit offering basic functionalities for astronomical data manipulation and reduction 11 . The pipeline is structured as a set of top-level recipes, written in C, which handle the various raw data types produced by the instrument (all types of calibration and science frames). The DRS recipes can be called either through the 
            <rs type="software">EsoRex</rs> command-line interface or through the 
            <rs type="software">EsoReflex</rs> graphical user interface (GUI) workflow environment, both of which are developed and maintained by ESO. The

        <p>Data processing is organized as a sequential reduction cascade in which each raw data type is associated with a dedicated DRS recipe. The pipeline generates intermediate data products at each stage, many of which are then used as inputs in the subsequent steps of the cascade. The final task is the reduction of science spectra. The main steps of the science processing are: (1) bias and dark subtraction; (2) subtraction of inter-order background; (3) optimal extraction of spectral orders using master flat-field as order profile, with masking of dead, hot, and saturated pixels and rejection of cosmic rays; (4) creation of extracted spectra (S2D) in (order, pixel) space with associated error and quality maps; (5) flat-fielding and de-blazing of S2D spectra; (6) wavelength calibration of S2D spectra using either a combination of ThAr and Fabry-Perot sources or the LFC; 97 computation of barycentric correction and shift of wavelength solutions to the Solar System barycenter; (8) instrumental drift computation and correction using fiber B (simultaneous reference mode); (9) extraction of sky spectrum and creation of sky-subtracted S2D spectra using fiber B (simultaneous sky mode); ( 10) creation of rebinned and merged 1D spectra (S1D) with associated error and quality maps; (11) creation of fluxcalibrated S1D spectra using estimated absolute efficiency and extinction curves; ( 12) computation of the cross-correlation function (CCF) of the S2D spectrum with a stellar binary mask; (13) fit of the CCF with a Gaussian model to derive RV and associated CCF parameters (full width at half maximum; FWHM, contrast, bisector span, asymmetry); and ( 14) computation of sky-subtracted CCFs with associated RV and CCF parameters (simultaneous sky mode).Data processing is organized as a sequential reduction cascade in which each raw data type is associated with a dedicated DRS recipe.

        <p>The ESPRESSO DAS is designed to perform scientific measurements on reduced data and to provide users with high-level science-grade observables and products, such as lists of lines, continuum models, and best-fit values of physical parameters. Like the DRS, it is structured as a set of recipes that can be launched individually (using the ESO's command-line interface 
            <rs type="software">EsoRex</rs>) or collectively as a workflow (through the ESO Reflex environment). Each recipe performs a specific operation and may take as input both DRS products and static calibration (list of reference lines, etc.).

        <p>To cope with the nonlinear nature of the analysis procedure, six different Reflex workflows are included in the DAS, each with its own specific cascade of recipes. Three workflows are devoted to the analysis of stellar spectra. First, star_I combines multiple exposures of the same stellar spectrum correcting for RV (recipe espda_coadd_spec), determines the equivalent width of selected absorption lines (recipe espda_compu_eqwidth), and compares the equivalent widths with static calibrations to determine the effective temperature and the metallicity of the star (recipe espda_compu_starpar).To cope with the nonlinear nature of the analysis procedure, six different Reflex workflows are included in the DAS, each with its own specific cascade of recipes.

        <p>The wavelength range of ESPRESSO was originally specified by ESO to cover at least the full visible range from 380 to 680 nm, similar to the HARPS spectrograph, with an optional extension to 350 nm on the blue side and to 760 nm on the red side. While the extension to the red side could easily be implemented, the blue extension would have produced considerable technical challenges. The implemented spectral range continuously covers the domain from 378.2 nm to 788.7 nm.

        <p>The resolving power R = λ/∆λ of a spectrograph is defined as the ratio between the wavelength λ and the FWHM ∆λ of a non-resolved spectral line. In astronomical spectrographs, the slit width or fiber diameter is the result of the trade-off between resolving power and slit-efficiency. In order to contain slit losses, the on-sky projected slit width (fiber diameter) is usually chosen to be comparable to or larger than the median seeing of the observing site. In opposition, the spectrograph's optical design (size, dispersion) is adapted to produce the desired resolving power. As a consequence, the resolving power is not determined by the diffraction limit of the optics, but simply by the fiber diameter. Transferred to ESPRESSO, this implies that the spectral resolution ∆λ covered by the fiber projected on the detector is directly proportional to the fiber width and that the resolving power is inversely proportional. The different modes of ESPRESSO produce, therefore, a different resolving power, as shown in Table 3.The resolving power R = λ/∆λ of a spectrograph is defined as the ratio between the wavelength λ and the FWHM ∆λ of a non-resolved spectral line.

        <p>However, the geometrical image of the optical fiber is convolved with the "local" instrumental profile (IP) of the spectrograph that represents the impact of optical aberrations and diffraction on the image of a perfectly monochromatic source feeding the spectrograph. As a consequence, the fiber image on the detector will be slightly blurred and the resolving power will be reduced. Of course, the effect is larger, in relative terms, when the IP is comparable in width to the fiber diameter. In other words, the narrower the fiber -and thus the higher the resolving power -the larger the reduction in resolving power will be compared to its theoretical value computed from geometrical considerations alone.However, the geometrical image of the optical fiber is convolved with the "local" instrumental profile (IP) of the spectrograph that represents the impact of optical aberrations and diffraction on the image of a perfectly monochromatic source feeding the spectrograph.

        <p>In order to study the effectively achieved resolving power in the various modes and across the full spectrum, we have used thorium-argon lamp calibration frames, assuming that most of the thorium emission lines are not or are only marginally resolved13 by the spectrograph. For all non-saturated thorium lines with sufficient signal we measured the line width and converted the FWHM into resolving power. Using 2D interpolation, we produced a 2D map of the resolving power as a function of "extracted pixel" (spectral direction, i.e., main dispersion) and echelle order (spatial direction, i.e., cross-dispersion). The three images in Fig. 11 represent, from top to bottom, the UHR, the HR, and the MR modes. Each image is composed of one larger frame (top) showing the red chip and a smaller frame (bottom) showing the blue chip. The wavelength increases from bottom to top (cross-dispersion direction) and from left to right (maindispersion direction along the order). For each order of the HR and UHR modes, both slices are shown side-by-side, and, as can be seen, the resolving power is slightly different. In the MR mode, the two (adjacent) slices must be extracted simultaneously by the DRS, resulting in a resolution map of one line per order. The map also shows the position of the thorium line used for determining the resolving power and interpolating the maps.In order to study the effectively achieved resolving power in the various modes and across the full spectrum, we have used thorium-argon lamp calibration frames, assuming that most of the thorium emission lines are not or are only marginally resolved13 by the spectrograph.

        <p>In the HR mode, the standard mode, a median resolving power of R = 138 000 is measured (requirements: R = 120 000). In the MR mode (4-UT configuration), the resolving power is reduced by about a factor of 2 (i.e., R = 72 500) due to the larger fiber diameter (requirement: R = 30 000). The UHR mode achieves a median resolving power on the order of R &gt; 190 000 in the blue arm, while exceeding R = 220 000, and thus being up to specification, in the red arm.In the HR mode, the standard mode, a median resolving power of R = 138 000 is measured (requirements: R = 120 000).

        <p>At first glance, a similar global behavior is observed in all modes. The blue spectrum (lower chip) is slightly less well resolved and a trend to higher resolving power is observed along every order from left (blue end) to right (red end). Slight variations of resolving power are indeed expected from optical-design considerations and are known to depend on the manufacturing parameters of each component and the effective alignment of the spectrograph.At first glance, a similar global behavior is observed in all modes.

        <p>Figure 12 shows the measured detection efficiency at 550 nm for airmass AM = 0 (no absorption) as a function of measured image quality IA.FWHM 14 . The IA.FWHM represents the "seeing" value at the Nasmyth focus of the telescope as computed by ESO's standard "Image Analysis" tool. Blue data points show the measured efficiency of ESPRESSO shortly after first commissioning, while the red data points were obtained in the months following the fiber-upgrade mission of June 2019. The plot demonstrates that, after the fiber upgrade, the photondetection efficiency at airmass 0 and for a seeing of 0.65 is close to 12%, about 40% higher than prior to the fiber exchange. Introducing an airmass of 1 causes the values to drop by 10-20% depending on the wavelength, such that the peak photon-detection efficiency still marginally reaches the specified 10% level. 14 FITS-header keyword available in the raw images. IA.FWHM gives the FWHM measured on the individual sub-apertures of the Shack-Hartmann scaled to zenith and at 550 nm. DIMM seeing is instead defined at zenith and 500 nm.

Figure 13 shows the detection efficiency for the HR mode as a function of wavelength as measured by the pipeline (raw), corrected for atmospheric absorption (airmasscorrected) and slit losses (seeing and airmass-corrected). The raw efficiency reaches 10% at 550 nm and exceeds it in the range between 550 and 680 nm. The same plot shows, however, that the requirement that the photon-detection efficiency not drops below 7% inside the specified minimum wavelength range (380-680 nm) of ESPRESSO is not completely fulfilled. Indeed, for wavelengths bluewards of 430 nm, the photon-detection efficiency goes below 7% and falls to a value of about 2% at the very blue end of the spectrum.Figure 12 shows the measured detection efficiency at 550 nm for airmass AM = 0 (no absorption) as a function of measured image quality IA.FWHM 14 .

        <p>In order to estimate the S/N and the RV precision as well as to provide benchmarks for the standard HR11 mode, we analyzed GTO RV data from July to December 2019 (after the fiber upgrade). Figure 16 shows the S/N obtained at a 550 nm wavelength in an extracted-pixel bin of 9 mÅ (0.49 km s -1 , no binning in spectral direction) as a function of target magnitude after they are normalized to the exposure time of 20 min. Taking the upper envelope shown by the dashed line, we measure an S/N on the order of S /N = 430 for V = 8 mag and S /N = 70 for V = 12 mag. Starting at V = 14 mag, a significant departure from the photon-noise limited behavior is observed.In order to estimate the S/N and the RV precision as well as to provide benchmarks for the standard HR11 mode, we analyzed GTO RV data from July to December 2019 (after the fiber upgrade).

        <p>We consider thus V = 14 mag to be the "limiting magnitude" (transition between photon-noise and detector RON limit) in the HR11 mode. While the S/N obtained in the HR21 and HR42 binning modes is identical up to this limiting magnitude, the limiting magnitudes themselves are shifted to about V ∼ 16 mag and V ∼ 18 mag, respectively. While the resolving power in the HR42 mode is reduced by about 5% compared to the HR21 or HR11 modes, this difference is barely noted, since stellar absorption lines are resolved to some extent. Figure 17 shows a comparison of a small portion of the spectrum of HD 85512 observed with ESPRESSO in the HR21 and HR42 modes. The two spectra match almost perfectly after re-scaling, demonstrating the quality of the spectral extraction in the new HR42 mode and the negligible difference in spectral performance of the two modes.

        <p>On the night of July 7, 2019 (i.e., after the fiber upgrade), we observed the QSO J16585649-5240283 of V = 17.07 mag in HR21 mode with an integration time of 1800 s. The image quality measured at the Nasmyth platform of the telescopes was of IA.FWHM = 1.1 , while the DIMM seeing monitor indicated a seeing on the order of 0.9 during the exposure. The airmass was AM = 1.15 on average. The average S/N measured at 550 nm yields an S /N = 6.6 in a spectral bin (extracted pixel) of 9 mÅ (0.49 km s -1 ), and thus perfectly in line with the extrapolated envelope shown in Fig. 16. In order to compare it with the technical requirements for the 1-UT configuration, this value has to be converted to an exposure of t exp = 3600 s and a spectral bin of 24 mÅ, where it yields an S /N = 15, well above the specified value of S /N = 10.

The average S/N measured at 550 nm in HR84 mode yields, after subtraction of the background, S /N = 8.5 measured in the spectral bin specified for the 4-UT configuration of 48 mÅ (2.63 km s -1 ); the extracted spectral bin (four physical pixels) is about 35.5 mÅ (1.94 km s -1 ) and contains a measured S/N of about 7.3.

        <p>The reported measurement was obtained before the fiber-link intervention, thanks to which a gain of up to 40% in throughput was achieved for the MR mode. We extrapolate from this result that an S /N = 9.7 is achieved after the fiber upgrade, which is very close to the specified value of 10 (spectral bin of 48 mÅ, seeing = 0.8 ). Finally, we would also like to point towards successful science verification (SV) observations performed in August 2019 on a very faint lensed galaxy (Vanzella et al. 2020) with V ∼ 21.5 mag and t exp = 3600 s yielding to the significant detection of relevant emission lines despite the faint magnitude of the source and the high spectral resolution of the measurement.The reported measurement was obtained before the fiber-link intervention, thanks to which a gain of up to 40% in throughput was achieved for the MR mode.

        <p>In Fig. 20, we plot the measured on-sky internal (photon-noise limited) precision in the standard HR mode as a function of measured S/N for several RV standards. At S /N = 430, 10 cm s -1 precision is reached for M stars, while for K and G dwarfs the RV precision lies between 10 and 20 cm s -1 , depending on the rotational level of the star, thus slightly worse than the specified value.In Fig. 20, we plot the measured on-sky internal (photon-noise limited) precision in the standard HR mode as a function of measured S/N for several RV standards.

        <p>In order to determine short-and medium-term RV repeatability, we observed, during the commissioning and in the frame of our GTO program, RV-standard stars taken from the HARPS high-precision program (Pepe et al. 2011). In Fig. 21, we show a time series recorded during commissioning 2A (March 1, 2018) on the V = 7.65 mag K5-dwarf HD 85512, a nonrotating, very quiet star. The sequence covers about seven consecutive hours of observations in HR mode, binning 2 × 1, during which an average photon-noise error of 25 cm s -1 was obtained on each single exposure of 300 s. The measured raw dispersion on the data is of 28 cm s -1 rms, very close to the photon-noise uncertainty. When the exposures are binned in groups of five data points, the dispersion is reduced to 8 cm s -1 , again similar to the estimated average photon noise of 11 cm s -1 .In order to determine short-and medium-term RV repeatability, we observed, during the commissioning and in the frame of our GTO program, RV-standard stars taken from the HARPS high-precision program (Pepe et al. 2011).

        <p>The dependence of the measurement of the RV from the telescope was tested using observations of the same star. Although this star hosts a planet (K ∼ 0.8 m s -1 , P ∼ 58 days), it is one of the quietest stars observable with ESPRESSO. Its magnitude is such that we can achieve a photon noise smaller than 20 cm s -1 in 15 min of exposure. During a night with stable seeing and a clear sky, the star was observed in rapid sequence with all four UTs. The exposure time of 900 s allowed us to average the stellar acoustic pulsation (p-modes). As the data points in Fig. 24 show, the RV variation between telescopes is within the 18 cm s -1 photon noise in this case. The RV variation observed when repeating the observation with UT1 and UT3 is attributed to stellar effects (Dumusque 2012).The dependence of the measurement of the RV from the telescope was tested using observations of the same star.

        <p>In order to test the long-term "precision" (measurement repeatability), we collected measurement series of RV-standard stars observed during the first year of operations. We note that the series include the moment of the fiber upgrade in June 2019 and are likely to be affected by an instrumental RV offset. We advise ESPRESSO users to distinguish between ESPRESSO data taken before and after June 2019 by introducing a free offset parameter since it cannot be guaranteed that no instrumental RVoffset was introduced by this intervention on the spectrograph.In order to test the long-term "precision" (measurement repeatability), we collected measurement series of RV-standard stars observed during the first year of operations.

        <p>Figure 22 shows the radial velocities of HD 10700, one of the two stablest stars of the GTO Working-Group 1 program (blind search for rocky planets). Data points taken before the fiber upgrade are shown in blue, those after the intervention in orange. The raw scatter of the unbinned data obtained before the fiber upgrade is 0.94 m s -1 , and the raw scatter after the fiber upgrade is 0.72 m s -1 . We suspect that the higher dispersion in the early lifetime of the instrument is due to some "instabilities" introduced by operational issues (air-condition failures, thermal instabilities of the detector cryostat, etc.). The scatter of the radial velocities of τ Cet (HD 10700) decreases to 0.5 m s -1 when nightly bins are considered (Fig. 23). In summary, a long-term (∼1 year) RV precision of better than 0.5 m s -1 is demonstrated, despite the intrinsic measurement limitations set by the astrophysical targets themselves. ESPRESSO delivers (non-photon-noise limited) RVs better than HARPS when compared over a similar time span, and the RV performance tested thus far is compatible with the 10 cm s -1 -precision requirement.Figure 22 shows the radial velocities of HD 10700, one of the two stablest stars of the GTO Working-Group 1 program (blind search for rocky planets).

        <p>The fact that ESPRESSO can operate with any of the four UTs calls for a very particular requirement, namely that any performance figure of ESPRESSO is independent from the telescope used. While transmission may vary between one telescope and another, for example due to the different ages of the mirror coatings (typically re-coated every two years), these differences are comparable to the absolute and chromatic variability introduced by the varying astroclimatic conditions (seeing, transparency and airmass, clouds). Despite these possible variations, we conducted on-sky tests to demonstrate that neither transmittance nor RVs measured with ESPRESSO depend on the UT on which the observations are carried out. Figure 24 shows RV measurements of the same star when switching from one telescope to another. Error bars show that the photonic RV uncertainty (∼18 cm s -1 ), and thus the telescope transmittance, remain essentially constant. Since RV precision depends linearly on S/N, this test also demonstrates that the throughput of ESPRESSO varies from one UT to another at a level below the effect induced by the variability of observing conditions. A similar statement holds true for the RV measurement: while cycling through the telescopes (first four measurements), no significant RV offset is observed. Returning to UT1 (fifth measurement), the same RV is obtained, within the error bar, as for the very first measurement. The second measurement on UT2 (sixth measurement) shows a 2-sigma deviation from the previous measurements. The RV dispersion of the series nevertheless remains compatible with the photonic error of (∼18 cm s -1 ). The test was repeated on other stars and under different conditions, and similar results were obtained. These results demonstrate that if RVoffsets are induced by changing the UT, they must be smaller than 20 cm s -1 rms.The fact that ESPRESSO can operate with any of the four UTs calls for a very particular requirement, namely that any performance figure of ESPRESSO is independent from the telescope used.

        <p>The search for extrasolar planets is one of the fastest-expanding subjects in modern astrophysics. It was the detection of 51 Peg b, the first extrasolar planet around a solar-type star, by Mayor &amp; Queloz (1995) that engaged a whole new community in the hunt for exoplanets. 51 Peg b was detected through the RV variation its orbit induced on its parent star, which became one of the most efficient techniques for the detection and characterization of exoplanets. After providing a significant wealth of information on hot-Jupiter characteristics, the RV technique has progressively revealed the existence of planets with lower masses down to the Earth and super-Earth mass regime (including around our neighboring M-dwarf Proxima Cen (Anglada-Escudé et al. 2016). Over the past two decades, we have learned that at least 50% of stars in the solar neighborhood host a planet and that most of these can be found in multi-planetary systems (e.g., Lovis et al. 2011). Much of what is known about the exoplanet population comes from the detailed analysis of RV surveys (e.g., Udry et al. 2019). The efficiency of the RV technique is only challenged by that of space missions like Kepler (e.g., Borucki et al. 2011;Batalha et al. 2013), which have delivered the largest number of transit candidates for the more than 4000 planets known today.The search for extrasolar planets is one of the fastest-expanding subjects in modern astrophysics.

        <p>The combination of transits and spectroscopy played a fundamental role in the detailed characterization of individual planets. Together, that is by the technique called "transit spectroscopy", they provide information on the parent star, precise measurement of planetary masses and radii, and, therefore, planetary densities, and allow the investigation of planetary atmospheres. High-fidelity spectroscopy and RVs are essential tools for achieving these goals. When officially proposed to ESO (before the first results provided by the Kepler mission and well before the discovery of Earth-mass planets around stars in the solar neighborhood), ESPRESSO had already been conceived to pursue the following scientific objectives in the exoplanetary field: the discovery and characterization of Earth-mass planets (possibly) within the HZs of their parent stars of spectral types GKM, the characterization of the atmospheres of individual exoplanets, and the precise mass determination of low-mass transiting planets discovered by the Kepler and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) missions. In what follows, we describe these three sub-programs.The combination of transits and spectroscopy played a fundamental role in the detailed characterization of individual planets.

        <p>One of the main science drivers for ESPRESSO is the detection of Earth-mass planets in the HZ around GKM stars. It was this driver that set the most stringent constraints on spectral resolution, thermo-mechanical stability, and illumination stability, ultimately aiming for 10 cm s -1 of RV precision. This enables the search for Earth-mass planets inside the HZs of solar-type stars, provided that these stars are "quiet" and sufficiently bright, thus pointing towards late-G, K and M dwarfs of the solar neighborhood. Their proximity make them particularly suitable for follow-up studies regarding, for example, direct detection and characterization of their atmospheres. Starting in 2010, we performed several preparatory studies to define our target sample. We investigated the possible contamination by faint, spatially unresolved companions (Cunha et al. 2013) and the impact of micro-tellurics on precise RVs (Cunha et al. 2014), among other topics. To avoid being biased by previous RV surveys, we built our WG-1 catalog from scratch, performing a spectroscopic characterization for the stars that had not yet been observed at high spectral resolution. We obtained observing time on HARPS, HARPS-N, and UVES to complement HARPS observations retrieved from the ESO archive. For all candidates, we performed a detailed spectroscopic characterization as well as calculated the rotational velocity and chromospheric activity indices, among several other studies. The final target list contained 77 close-by, quiet, nonrotating stars covering a wide range of right ascension values and being thus observable the entire year. For these stars, the photon noise attained in a 15 min integration time (or 30 min for the faintest targets) allows us to detect the RV signal of a one Earth-mass planet orbiting inside the HZ. The details regarding target selection, spectral characterization, and further studies, along with reduced data access, are presented in Hojjatpanah et al.

        <p>The study of planetary atmospheres from the ground (see e.g., Snellen et al. 2008;Redfield et al. 2008;Charbonneau et al. 2002) represents a breakthrough in our understanding of what exoplanets are made of (chemical composition), which is essential for determining planetary evolution and may be key to better understanding planet formation processes, for example, whether a planet was born in the orbit it is observed in or whether it has migrated over a large distance. This is the case of warm and hot exoplanets with short orbital periods that lie very close to their parent stars. These exoplanets are a natural laboratory for chemistry and, quite likely, formation studies. Their high atmospheric temperatures prevent condensation and the sinking of refractory species, thus making the atmospheric composition more representative of the whole chemical content. Before ESPRESSO, various atomic and molecular species were detected at optical wavelengths in Jupiter-mass planets with expected equilibrium temperatures typically above ∼1000 K (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, neutral and ionized iron and titanium, titanium oxide, and hydrogen; see, for example, Hoeijmakers et al. 2019;Casasayas-Barris et al. 2019, and references therein). Water vapor, helium, and possibly methane and carbon-bearing species are also seen in hot massive exoplanets in the near-infrared (for example, see Nortmann et al. 2018;Sotzen et al. 2020, and references therein). Some warm Neptunes (e.g., GJ 436b and GJ 3470b) and the super-Earth GJ 1214b, on the contrary, show cloudy atmospheres, which do not allow the determination of their composition. The least dense planets at small orbital distances from their host stars present atmospheres undergoing evaporation processes. These pioneering results have been possible through transit spectroscopy with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Spitzer as well as ground-based facilities, including a pathfinder ESO program that uses 
            <rs type="software">HARPS</rs> and HARPS-N (Wyttenbach et al. 2017). Complementing these studies, high-resolution spectroscopy with HARPS has also been shown to be a promising method for detecting exoplanet atmospheres in reflection (Martins et al. 2015a). There seems to be a great variety of planetary atmospheres, and even though studies of individual outstanding exoplanets represent a highlight per se, large number of observations are needed to address relevant questions on planet diversity, formation, and evolution. The ESPRESSO GTO program will provide optical spectra of more than 30 exoplanetary atmospheres (from hot to warm planets) over the GTO duration and will contribute to the direct measurement of their atmospheric composition and structure.

        <p>One of the first ESPRESSO-GTO results is first the detection of an asymmetric absorption signature due to neutral iron during the primary transit of the ultra-hot giant planet WASP-76b (Ehrenreich et al. 2020). This feature is blueshifted in the trailing limb (probably owing to the combination of planetary rotation and atmospheric wind), but no signature appears in the leading limb. We interpreted this as evidence of the condensation of gaseous iron, which is injected from the hot (day) side atmosphere onto the cool (night) side of the planet. In coming papers, the ESPRESSO-GTO team will show that this scenario likely happens in more planets with similar temperatures as those of WASP-76b and will report robust detections of atomic elements in the atmospheres of warm planets, such as lithium, that were not solidly established before (Tabernero et al., in prep.; Borsa et al., in prep.).One of the first ESPRESSO-GTO results is first the detection of an asymmetric absorption signature due to neutral iron during the primary transit of the ultra-hot giant planet WASP-76b (Ehrenreich et al. 2020).

        <p>The Kepler space mission has revolutionized our knowledge of exoplanets by discovering thousands of small transiting planets with radii below 4 R ⊕ . It has thereby confirmed that systems of short-period super-Earths and Neptunes are ubiquitous in our Galaxy; in fact, they appear to be a very frequent outcome of planet formation. However, the picture that emerged from the Kepler results has remained largely incomplete: The faintness of the host stars has been hampering a comprehensive characterization of the Kepler systems through ground-based follow-up. In particular, host star fundamental parameters such as stellar radii are only poorly known in many cases, leading to inaccurate planetary radii (Fulton et al. 2017;Van Eylen et al. 2018). Furthermore, planet masses could only be reliably measured in a limited number of systems that have sufficiently bright host stars (e.g., Buchhave et al. 2016). This situation improved with the advent of the K2 mission, which scanned the ecliptic plane in search of new transiting planets orbiting typically brighter stars than those of the original Kepler discoveries. Since 2018, another space mission has been further revolutionizing the exoplanet field: the TESS. TESS is currently performing an all-sky transit search from space and has already discovered hundreds of new transiting planets orbiting stars brighter than those discovered by K2. Intense follow-up efforts using HARPS-like instruments to characterize the super-Earths and Neptunes found by these missions have been ongoing for almost a decade, however still with a limited scope; only the more massive planets on shorter-period orbits are amenable to robust mass measurements.The Kepler space mission has revolutionized our knowledge of exoplanets by discovering thousands of small transiting planets with radii below 4 R ⊕ .

        <p>ESPRESSO represents a breakthrough in this respect: Its 2 mag gain and improved RV precision with respect to HARPSlike instruments will, for the first time, enable a thorough exploration of the rocky planet population detected by K2 and TESS. These rocky worlds have radii below ∼1.8 R ⊕ and their expected masses are typically below 6-8 M ⊕ , although their mass distributions currently remain largely unconstrained. ESPRESSO observations will be able to constrain the internal composition of these objects, namely their iron/rock/water mass fraction, under the reasonable assumption that they do not have any H/He envelopes. Moreover, ESPRESSO will explore how the properties of this population vary with stellar irradiation, stellar mass, planetary architecture, and even stellar composition (Santos et al. 2017), shedding new light on the formation and evolution pathways of these systems. Ultimately, ESPRESSO will be able to characterize transiting rocky planets within the HZ of their host star with unprecedented detail.ESPRESSO represents a breakthrough in this respect: Its 2 mag gain and improved RV precision with respect to HARPSlike instruments will, for the first time, enable a thorough exploration of the rocky planet population detected by K2 and TESS.

        <p>The ESPRESSO-GTO K2/TESS planet sample has been defined based on the following criteria: (a) confirmed or validated planet candidate; (b) planet radius &lt;2.0 R ⊕ ; (c) host star V &lt; 14.5 mag (spectral-type dependent); and (d) no precise mass measurement available. In addition, we intend to probe the rocky-to-gaseous transition at a given stellar irradiation level. This will allow us to constrain the evaporation processes that transform sub-Neptunes into naked rocky cores under the influence of extreme UV (XUV) irradiation from the host star. According to the results of Fulton et al. (2017), a particularly interesting irradiation range to carry out this experiment is ∼50-200× Earth's irradiation levels, where both gas-rich sub-Neptunes and gas-poor rocky planets appear to coexist. Mass and density measurements from ESPRESSO will thus probe the mass and density thresholds, leading to significant evaporation of planetary envelopes. The target sample for this experiment is the same as the one defined above, complemented in the following ways: (1) adding the larger planets that are in the same systems as the rocky planets defined above, and (2) adding a few more sub-Neptunes and Neptunes (&lt;4 R ⊕ ) in other systems, which are under irradiation levels of 50-200× Earth's level. The main objective of the program is to measure precise masses and bulk densities for all these objects.

        <p>To illustrate the potential of ESPRESSO and this subprogram, we refer to the case of the planetary system π Men. π Men is a bright, "naked-eye" G0V-star (V = 5.6 mag) known to host a sub-stellar companion on a long-period and very eccentric orbit of P b ∼ 2000 days. On September 6, 2018, NASA announced the discovery by TESS (Ricker et al. 2015) of a second planet, the transiting super-Earth π Men c (P c = 6.27 days; R c = 2 R ⊕ ). Following the announcement, Huang et al. (2018) and Gandolfi et al.

        <p>The brightness of the star makes π Men a perfect target for testing the performance of ESPRESSO in measuring the masses and bulk densities of low-mass planets. From September 5, 2018, to March 25, 2019, we recorded therefore a total of 275 spectra and covered a time span of 201 days. The spectra were acquired with a typical exposure time of 120 s, providing median S /N = 243 per extracted pixel at λ = 500 nm and a median RV (internal) precision of 25 cm s -1 . During each observing night, we collected series of multiple spectra at a rate of two to 12 consecutive exposures, leading to a typical in-night RV precision of the binned data points of about 10 cm s -1 . Furthermore, TESS reobserved the host star during cycle 1 (sectors 4, 8, and 11-13) from October 2018 to July 2019, collecting 19 additional transits of planet c in short-cadence mode.The brightness of the star makes π Men a perfect target for testing the performance of ESPRESSO in measuring the masses and bulk densities of low-mass planets.

        <p>The standard model of particle physics depends on many (∼27) independent numerical parameters that determine, inter alia, the strengths of the different forces and the relative masses of all known fundamental particles. There is no theoretical explanation for their actual value, but they nevertheless determine the properties of atoms, cells, stars, and the whole Universe. They are commonly referred to as the fundamental constants of nature, and our only definition for them is: any parameter that cannot be calculated from first principles in a given theoretical framework and therefore must be determined by experiment. Nevertheless, most of the modern extensions of the standard model predict a variation of these constants at some level (Uzan 2011;Bonifacio et al. 2014;Martins 2017).The standard model of particle physics depends on many (∼27) independent numerical parameters that determine, inter alia, the strengths of the different forces and the relative masses of all known fundamental particles.

        <p>For instance, in any theory involving more than four spacetime dimensions, the constants we observe are merely 4D shadows of the truly fundamental high-dimensional constants. The 4D constants will then be seen to vary as the extra dimensions change slowly in size during their cosmological evolution. The most common examples in modern cosmology are the quintessence models for dark energy, in which the underlying dynamical scalar field is naturally expected to couple with the electromagnetic sector of the theory and lead to a variation of the fine-structure constant (Carroll 1998); thus tests of the stability of the fine-structure constant are a competitive cosmological probe (Martins et al. 2015b). Earth-based laboratories can measure the local drift rate of these constants. For the fine structure constant α, this has been constrained to a few parts per 10 -17 yr -1 (Rosenband et al. 2008). This is more than six orders of magnitude slower that the typical cosmological drift rate (viz. 10 -10 yr -1 ), showing that any such scalar field must be evolving very slowly.For instance, in any theory involving more than four spacetime dimensions, the constants we observe are merely 4D shadows of the truly fundamental high-dimensional constants.

        <p>Astronomical observations have great potential for probing the stability of fundamental constants at very large distances and in the early Universe, and therefore identifying any slow but nontrivial evolution. In fact, the transition frequencies of the narrow metal absorption lines observed in the spectra of distant quasars are sensitive to α, as first pointed out by Bahcall &amp; Schmidt (1967), and those of the rare molecular hydrogen clouds are sensitive to µ, the proton-to-electron mass ratio, as first pointed out by Thompson (1975).Astronomical observations have great potential for probing the stability of fundamental constants at very large distances and in the early Universe, and therefore identifying any slow but nontrivial evolution.

        <p>With the advent of 10 m class telescopes, observations of spectral lines in distant QSOs provided the first hints that the value of the fine structure constant might change over time, being lower in the past by about 6 ppm (Webb et al. 1999;Murphy et al. 2004). The addition of another 143 VLT/UVES absorbers have revealed 4σ evidence for a dipole-like variation in α across the sky at the 10 ppm level (Webb et al. 2011;King et al. 2012). Several other constraints from higherquality spectra of individual absorbers exist (Molaro et al. 2013;Evans et al. 2014;Murphy et al. 2016;Kotus et al. 2017;Bainbridge &amp; Webb 2017;Murphy &amp; Cooksey 2017) but none of them directly support or strongly conflict with the α dipole evidence, and a possible systematic producing opposite values in the two hemispheres is not easy to identify.With the advent of 10 m class telescopes, observations of spectral lines in distant QSOs provided the first hints that the value of the fine structure constant might change over time, being lower in the past by about 6 ppm (Webb et al. 1999;Murphy et al. 2004).

        <p>Extraordinary claims requ ire extraordinary evidence, and a confirmation of variability with high statistical significance -in practice, at the level of 1 ppm -is of crucial importance. Only a high-resolution spectrograph that combines a large collecting area with extreme wavelength precision can provide definitive clarification.

        <p>The vast majority of known stars of ultra-low metallicity are known to be enhanced in carbon and to belong to the lowcarbon band (A(C) ≤ 7.6). It is generally, although not universally, accepted that this peculiar chemical composition reflects the chemical composition of the gas cloud out of which these stars were formed. The first ultra metal-poor star discovered, HE 0107-5240, is also enhanced in carbon and belongs to the low-carbon band. It has recently been claimed that its peculiar composition could be due to mass-transfer to a formerly AGB companion (Arentsen et al. 2019). ESPRESSO observations obtained in 2018 demonstrate unambiguously that the RV of HE 0107-5240 increased between 2001 and 2018 and that the star is indeed a binary (Bonifacio et al. 2020). However, binarity does not necessarily imply mass exchange, and the nature of the companion remains undetermined. The companion could be either a white dwarf or an unevolved star. The binarity of such an object holds important information on the formation of small mass objects from a cloud without elements able to cool the gas and facilitate the first condensations. High-resolution simulations of star formation from primordial gas have shown the importance of the fragmentation processes (Greif et al. 2011). This provides a way of producing low-mass stars even in the absence of efficient cooling mechanisms, favoring the formation of binary systems.The vast majority of known stars of ultra-low metallicity are known to be enhanced in carbon and to belong to the lowcarbon band (A(C) ≤ 7.6).

An estimate of the oscillation-mode amplitude, frequency domain, frequency of the maximum amplitude ν max , and large splitting ∆ν in a mid-K dwarf with an effective temperature T eff lower than 5000 K will allow us to refine the scaling relation from the Sun (Kjeldsen &amp; Bedding 2011) at the cool edge of the main sequence. The frequency at which a solar-like oscillator presents its strongest amplitude ν max scales with the surface gravity log g and effective temperature T eff . The detection of p-mode oscillations in K dwarfs is still out of reach of photometric space missions, and the level of RV precision required is out of reach of any spectrograph other than ESPRESSO.So far, no p-mode oscillations have been detected on solartype stars with spectral types later than K1V (e.g., α Cen B Carrier &amp; Bourban 2003;Kjeldsen et al. 2005).

        <p>HD 40307 is one of the brightest mid-K dwarfs and is well located for a long time-series acquisition from the Southern Hemisphere. According to HARPS monitoring (Díaz et al. 2016), HD 40307 is a quiet star with logR hk of -4.94, which presents a magnetic cycle with a period of about 10 years and hosts a four-planet system. According to its effective temperature (4977 K), luminosity (0.228 L ), and mass (0.77 M ), HD 40307 is expected to have p-mode oscillations with an amplitude of 6-10 cm s -1 and a typical period of 2.5-3 min as well as a large separation of modes ∆ν ∼ 220-230 µHz.HD 40307 is one of the brightest mid-K dwarfs and is well located for a long time-series acquisition from the Southern Hemisphere.

        <p>In December 2018, we conducted an asteroseismological campaign on HD 40307 with ESPRESSO over five nights. The detailed analysis of the RV time series and spectroscopic activity indicators (CCF FWHM, bisector span, CaII, Hα, etc.) will be presented in Bouchy et al. (in prep.). During this campaign, a total of 1150 measurements were obtained. The exposure time was set to 30 s. The duty cycle was close to 78 s due to increased overhead time, which has since been slightly reduced. The average photon-noise uncertainty per exposure is 95 cm s -1 . Figure 25 shows the ESPRESSO and HARPS radial velocities phase-folded to the 4.31 day planet of the HD 40307 system. ESPRESSO's exposure time was 30 times shorter than that of HARPS (900 s). The typical dispersion of ESPRESSO RVs is 110 cm s -1 and not limited by the photon-noise. Figure 26 presents the RV dispersion as a function of the number of binned data points. One can see that by binning six data points (8 min bin), the dispersion is reduced to less than 50 cm s -1 and the additional noise (instrumental and stellar) is at the level of 30 cm s -1 . By averaging 27 data points (35 min bin), the dispersion is further reduced to below 20 cm s -1 . These values suggest that the binning process progressively damps the signals that have a stellar origin. Hence, Fig. 26 leads us to believe that the residual instrumental noise must be at the level of only 10 cm s -1 .In December 2018, we conducted an asteroseismological campaign on HD 40307 with ESPRESSO over five nights.

        <p>We find weak evidence of p-mode detection at a level of only 3-4 cm s -1 , very close to our detection limit, slightly below the expected amplitude, and with a large separation of modes close to 220 µHz. Furthermore, we expected to see the excitation and damping of p-mode oscillations on the timescale of a few hours. Figure 27 shows the RV time series obtained on December 24, 2018. The RV jitter increases suddenly after BJD = 8 477.71 and with a modulation of 2.5 min. This pattern could not be linked to any (known) instrumental parameters, and we think that it shows the onset of coherent pulsation modes in realtime, a snapshot of a "stellar quake".We find weak evidence of p-mode detection at a level of only 3-4 cm s -1 , very close to our detection limit, slightly below the expected amplitude, and with a large separation of modes close to 220 µHz.

        <p>Observations of the abundances of the primordial elements produced in the Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) provide one of the earliest (first few minutes) probes of the cosmological scenario, and any departure from the standard values and from homogeneity can be the smoking gun of new physics. Among the various elements and isotopes (He 3 , He 4 , Li), deuterium is known to be a powerful diagnostic, in particular providing the best constraint on the baryon abundance thanks to its sensitivity and monotonic dependence on the baryon-to-photon ratio, η 10 .Observations of the abundances of the primordial elements produced in the Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) provide one of the earliest (first few minutes) probes of the cosmological scenario, and any departure from the standard values and from homogeneity can be the smoking gun of new physics.

        <p>For nearly 20 years, primordial deuterium abundance has been measured with the ratio of D I to H I column densities in absorption systems observed in high-redshift quasar spectra. This is not an easy task: high-resolution data have been used to this end, and both high S/N and a strict control on systematics are required. Systematics can be related to the process of measurement (continuum fitting, H I Lyman-α line contamination, deblending of the velocity structure) as well as to external possible correlations of the abundance with the column (over-)density, metallicity, and/or redshift of the absorber.For nearly 20 years, primordial deuterium abundance has been measured with the ratio of D I to H I column densities in absorption systems observed in high-redshift quasar spectra.

        <p>The relative large scatter observed in the D/H values throughout the era of accurate measurements has been typically ascribed to underestimates of the systematic errors. In a recent paper, Cooke et al. (2018) selected only seven absorbers that are able to provide a significant measurement. Their results turn out to be compatible with a uniform primordial D/H = (2.53 ± 0.03) × 10 -5 and consistent within 2σ with the baryon density measurable from the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations.The relative large scatter observed in the D/H values throughout the era of accurate measurements has been typically ascribed to underestimates of the systematic errors.

        <p>ESPRESSO, with its characteristics of stability and wavelength accuracy, can provide measurements with much lower systematics. Furthermore, observations in 4-UT configuration allow us to observe a bright quasar with a resolution ∼1.5-1.75 times larger than those normally obtained with UVES at VLT or HIRES at Keck. A larger resolution is critical for improving the determination of the continuum level and the characterization of the velocity structure of systems.ESPRESSO, with its characteristics of stability and wavelength accuracy, can provide measurements with much lower systematics.

        <p>In August 2018, we observed the quasar PKS 1937-1009 for 5 h with ESPRESSO in 4-UT configuration. This is one of the brightest quasars (V = 16.95 mag) in the southern sky with a relatively high emission redshift (z em 3.787), allowing us to observe its Lyman forest in the ESPRESSO wavelength range. In the spectrum of this object there are two Lyman limit systems (log(N HI ) ∼ 18) for which primordial deuterium measurements were carried out at z 3.256 and at z 3.572 (see Riemer-Sørensen et al. 2015, 2017 andreferences therein). The analysis of the ESPRESSO spectra (D'Odorico et al., in prep.) is improving our knowledge of the chemical abundances of the two systems, while the S/N in the Lyman forest will probably need to be increased to obtain a more accurate determination of the D/H abundances than previously reported.In August 2018, we observed the quasar PKS 1937-1009 for 5 h with ESPRESSO in 4-UT configuration.

        <p>A number of studies on the large-scale properties of the intergalactic medium have concentrated on the crucial problem of the physical scale of Lyman absorbers. Observations (e.g., D'Odorico et al. 1998, 2002;Rauch et al. 2005) have shown that their typical size is large and that they must be part of the general large-scale structure. Ionization arguments, analytical and Monte Carlo modeling of absorption in double lines of sight (Findlay et al. 2018 and references therein), and cosmological hydro-simulations all suggest that the absorbing structures are part of a filamentary cosmic web that is expected to follow the Hubble flow on large (megaparsec) scales, that is to say, on scales that are at least larger than the typical coherence length of these structures. On intermediate scales (on the order of 100 kpc), the effects of gravitational collapse may become more pronounced, with the gas gaining kinetic energy in the galactic potential wells, while on the smallest (subkiloparsec) scales, processes like stellar winds and supernova explosions should be the dominant sources of momentum.A number of studies on the large-scale properties of the intergalactic medium have concentrated on the crucial problem of the physical scale of Lyman absorbers.

        <p>We have taken advantage of the unique capabilities of ESPRESSO to explore the kiloparsec and subkiloparsec scales and gain insight into the feedback processes governing the formation of galaxies as well as to verify whether systematic variations of the dynamical and ionization states in the Lyman forest might affect the Sandage test (Loeb 1998;Cristiani et al. 2007;Liske et al. 2008) in future experiments. We observed a bright lensed QSO with emission redshift 2.72 and image split on the sky of 2.5 with ESPRESSO in 4-UT configuration. The lines of sight of Q0142-100AB span the Ly-alpha redshift from z = 2.7 down to 2.2 and represent, due to the geometry of the lens, transverse scales from about 15 physical kiloparsecs down to the subkiloparsec range. This is the brightest known lens in the southern sky for which the Lyman forest is observable by ESPRESSO and the separation of at least two images of the lens is above 2 (in order to avoid fiber flux contamination). The Lyman forest on these scales shows a remarkable stability: Pairs of absorptions observed in the two lines of sight display the same column density, Doppler parameter, and redshift within the measurement error of the photon statistics (Fig. 28,top). In particular, the velocity differences appear to be below the observational rms limit of 1.1 km s -1 . On the contrary, metal lines, and the CIV species in particular (Fig. 28, bottom), show strong variations, indicating that they must have variations of structures on scales on the order of 10 2 pc (Cristiani et al., in prep.).We have taken advantage of the unique capabilities of ESPRESSO to explore the kiloparsec and subkiloparsec scales and gain insight into the feedback processes governing the formation of galaxies as well as to verify whether systematic variations of the dynamical and ionization states in the Lyman forest might affect the Sandage test (Loeb 1998;Cristiani et al. 2007;Liske et al. 2008) in future experiments.

        <p>Using on-sky tests carried out during the commissioning phase and the first year of operations, we demonstrated that all the main performance requirements have been met. First, high resolving power of R ∼ 140 000 and R &gt; 190 000 is provided in the 1-UT configuration over the full wavelength range from 378.2 to 788.7 nm. In 4-UT configuration, a resolving power of R ∼ 70 000 is achieved despite having to cope with the etendue of four 8 m telescopes. Second, the overall throughput, from the top of the atmosphere to the detector, peaks at 10% in both the 1-UT and the 4-UT configurations. Third, short-term (night) RV measurement are limited by photon noise down to the 10 cm s -1 level. Over the long term (months), a repeatability of better than 50 cm s -1 rms has been demonstrated. Given the fact that photon noise and stellar jitter affect single RV measurements, this value provides an upper limit for the instrumental precision. Last, we have demonstrated that throughput and RV measurement do not depend on the used telescope. This fact allows for a unique versatility of the VLT in its operations.Using on-sky tests carried out during the commissioning phase and the first year of operations, we demonstrated that all the main performance requirements have been met.

        <p>We presented our GTO program that is being carried out on ESPRESSO. Due to the time-series nature of the RV observations, and in particular the blind-search subprogram, we were not expecting to produce results shortly after the start of operations. Two other subprograms, aiming at the RV followup of TESS and K2 and at observing planetary atmospheres through transit spectroscopy, however, immediately benefited from the unique spectroscopic capabilities of ESPRESSO (e.g., Ehrenreich et al. 2020). Furthermore, the simultaneous start of TESS and ESPRESSO operations enabled exceptional synergies between spaced-based transit searches and ground-based RV observations. The results on π Men presented in Damasso et al. (this same edition of the journal) are the direct demonstration of the power of simultaneous high-precision photometric and spectroscopic observations.We presented our GTO program that is being carried out on ESPRESSO.
