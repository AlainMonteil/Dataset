        <p>The ensemble of chemical element abundance measurements for stars, along with precision distances and orbit properties, provides high-dimensional data to study the evolution of the Milky Way. With this third data release of the Galactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) survey, we publish 678 423 spectra for 588 571 mostly nearby stars (81.2 per cent of stars are within &lt;2 kpc), observed with the HERMES spectrograph at the Anglo-Australian Telescope. This release (hereafter GALAH+ DR3) includes all observations from GALAH Phase 1 (bright, main, and faint survey, 70 per cent), K2-HERMES (17 per cent), TESS-HERMES (5 per cent), and a subset of ancillary observations (8 per cent) including the bulge and &gt;75 stellar clusters. We derive stellar parameters T eff , log g, [Fe/H], v mic , v broad , and v rad using our modified version of the spectrum synthesis code Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME) and 1D MARCS model atmospheres. We break spectroscopic degeneracies in our spectrum analysis with astrometry from Gaia DR2 and photometry from 2MASS. We report abundance ratios [X/Fe] for 30 different elements (11 of which are based on non-LTE computations) covering five nucleosynthetic pathways. We describe validations for accuracy and precision, flagging of peculiar stars/measurements and recommendations for using our results. Our catalogue comprises 65 per cent dwarfs, 34 per cent giants, and 1 per cent other/unclassified stars. Based on unflagged chemical composition and age, we find 62 per cent young low-α, 9 per cent young high-α, 27 per cent old high-α, and 2 per cent stars with [Fe/H] ≤ -1. Based on kinematics, 4 per cent are halo stars. Several Value-Added-Catalogues, including stellar ages and dynamics, updated after Gaia eDR3, accompany this release and allow chrono-chemodynamic analyses, as we showcase.The ensemble of chemical element abundance measurements for stars, along with precision distances and orbit properties, provides high-dimensional data to study the evolution of the Milky Way.

        <p>The connections between the chemical compositions and dynamics of stars across the vast populations in our Galaxy are a topic of significant ongoing research. Although we speak of the Milky Way in terms of the thin and thick disc (Yoshii 1982;Gilmore &amp; Reid 1983), the bulge (Barbuy, Chiappini &amp; Gerhard 2018), and the stellar halo (Helmi 2020) as its main components (Bland-Hawthorn &amp; Gerhard 2016), we understand that the Galaxy is more than a superposition of independent populations. With the data now at hand, we can analyse the Galaxy from a chemodynamical perspective, and use stars of different ages as time capsules to trace back the formation history of our Galaxy (see e.g. Rix &amp; Bovy 2013;Bland-Hawthorn et al. 2019). As one example, the most recent data release from Gaia has enabled significant leaps in our understanding of the enigmatic Galactic halo (for an overview see e.g. Helmi 2020). 6D phase space information from Gaia has revealed a large population of stars in the Solar neighbourhood that stand out against the smooth halo background as a coherent dynamical structure, pointing to a significant accretion event that is currently referred to as 'Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage' (GES) a combination of 'Gaia-Enceladus' (Helmi et al. 2018) and 'Gaia Sausage' (Belokurov et al. 2018). Additionally, while we would expect the chemical composition of stars to be correlated with their ages and formation sites (see e.g. Minchev et al. 2017), observations can now clearly demonstrate these connections (see e.g. Feuillet et al. 2018;Buder et al. 2019), and can also demonstrate that stars within our Solar neighbourhood have experienced significant radial migration through their lifetimes (see e.g. Frankel et al. 2018;Hayden et al. 2020).The connections between the chemical compositions and dynamics of stars across the vast populations in our Galaxy are a topic of significant ongoing research.

        <p>Despite these significant advances, the full detail of our Galaxy's formation and history still elude us. Many of the pieces that make up that puzzle are presently missing, or remain contentious. As a result, a number of questions still remain to be answered. These include the discrete merger history of our Milky Way, the (non-)existence of an in situ halo and the reason for the sharp transition from formation of stars with high α-element abundances in what has historically been called the 'thick disc' to younger stars with Solar-like α-element abundances in the 'thin disc'. We have learnt a great deal about contributions of supernovae to element abundances, starting from the foundational work by Burbidge et al. (1957), and how we can use diagrams displaying element abundances, e.g. in [Fe/H]versus [α/Fe]diagrams, as diagnostic tools of stellar and Galactic evolution. These advances in our understanding are largely thanks to the pioneering and seminal studies by Tinsley (1979Tinsley ( , 1980) ) and others, building on the trail-blazing observational achievements of Wallerstein (1962) and others. To honour the fundamental contributions by Beatrice M. Tinsley and George Wallerstein, connecting the contributions of SNIa and SNII with element abundances in the [Fe/H]versus [α/Fe]diagrams, we will hereafter refer to these as the 'Tinsley-Wallerstein diagrams'.Despite these significant advances, the full detail of our Galaxy's formation and history still elude us.

        <p>Previous and ongoing spectroscopic surveys by collaborations like RAVE (Steinmetz et al. 2020a,b), Gaia-ESO (Gilmore et al. 2012), SDSS-IV APOGEE (Ahumada et al. 2020), and LAMOST (Cui et al. 2012;Xiang et al. 2019) have certainly shed light on several of these outstanding questions. Answering them completely, requires more and/or better data to map out the correlations between stellar ages, abundances, and dynamics. Upcoming surveys like SDSS-V (Kollmeier et al. 2017), WEAVE (Dalton et al. 2018), 4MOST (de Jong et al. 2019), and PFS (Takada et al. 2014) will certainly continue to broaden our capabilities and understanding surrounding our Galaxy's physical and chemical evolution. The data currently at hand, derived from spectroscopy, photometry, astrometry, and asteroseismology, provide high-dimensional information, and we must develop methods to extract the most accurate and precise information from them (for reviews on this see e.g. Nissen &amp; Gustafsson 2018;Jofré, Heiter &amp; Soubiran 2019).Previous and ongoing spectroscopic surveys by collaborations like RAVE (Steinmetz et al. 2020a,b), Gaia-ESO (Gilmore et al. 2012), SDSS-IV APOGEE (Ahumada et al. 2020), and LAMOST (Cui et al. 2012;Xiang et al. 2019) have certainly shed light on several of these outstanding questions.

        <p>The recent growth in the quantity of available spectroscopic stellar data has delivered a new technique to galactic archaeologists -namely 'Chemical Tagging', which allows the identification of stars that formed together using their chemical composition and an understanding of the astrophysics driving the dimensionality of chemical space. This technique is proving a vital tool, enabling us to observationally isolate and characterize the building blocks of our Galaxy. As a result, it remains a major science driver for the GALactic Archaeology with HERMES1 (GALAH) collaboration2 (De Silva et al. 2015). With the large variety of nucleosynthetic channels that can enrich the birth material of stars (see e.g. Kobayashi, Karakas &amp; Lugaro 2020), the hypothesis is that we should be able to disentangle stars with different enrichment patterns, provided we observe enough elements with different enrichment origins. The success of some chemical tagging experiments (see e.g. Kos et al. 2018;Price-Jones et al. 2020) is challenged by the broad similarities in chemical abundance in populations like the low-α disc (see e.g. Ness et al. 2018), and by the small but real inhomogeneities even within star clusters (Liu et al. 2016a, b). To put detailed chemical tagging into action, we will need a massive data set (see e.g. Ting, Conroy &amp; Rix 2016) consisting of measurements made with outstanding precision (Ting &amp; Weinberg 2021).The recent growth in the quantity of available spectroscopic stellar data has delivered a new technique to galactic archaeologists -namely 'Chemical Tagging', which allows the identification of stars that formed together using their chemical composition and an understanding of the astrophysics driving the dimensionality of chemical space.

        <p>The publication of the previous second data release of the GALAH survey (Buder et al. 2018), entirely based on observations as part of GALAH Phase 1 with the HERMES spectrograph at the Anglo-Australian Telescope, has provided for the community abundance measurements of 23 elements based on 342 682 spectra. Observations for this phase have continued and we are able to publish all 476 863 spectra for 443 843 stars of the now finished Phase 1 observations as part of this third data release. In parallel, spectroscopic followup observations of K2 and TESS targets have been performed with HERMES and we are able to also include these observations (112 943 spectra for 99 152 K2-HERMES stars and 34 263 spectra for 26 249 TESS-HERMES stars) in our release. We further include ancillary observations of 54 354 spectra for 28 205 stars in fields towards the bulge and more than 75 stellar clusters. Given the significant contribution from these programmes to this GALAH release, we will hereafter refer to the release as GALAH+ DR3.The publication of the previous second data release of the GALAH survey (Buder et al. 2018), entirely based on observations as part of GALAH Phase 1 with the HERMES spectrograph at the Anglo-Australian Telescope, has provided for the community abundance measurements of 23 elements based on 342 682 spectra.

        <p>For the previous (second) data release of the GALAH survey (Buder et al. 2018), we made use of the data-driven tool 
            <rs type="software">The Cannon</rs> (Ness et al. 2015) to improve both the speed and the precision of the spectroscopic analysis. This was performed almost entirely without non-spectroscopic information for individual stars, using a 'training set' of stars with careful by-hand analysis. Although the data-driven approaches were successful for the majority of GALAH DR2 stars, we know that these approaches can suffer from signal aliasing (e.g. moving outliers closer to the main trends), can learn unphysical correlations between the input data and the output stellar labels, and that the results are not necessarily valid outside the parameter space of the training set. As part of this study, we aim to assess how accurately and precisely the stellar parameters and abundances were estimated by the data-driven approaches. We have therefore adjusted our approach to the analysis of the whole sample and now restrict ourselves to smaller wavelength segments of the four wavelength windows observed by HERMES per star with reliable line information for spectrum synthesis instead and include even more grids for an accurate computation of line strengths when the conditions depart from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE; e.g. Mihalas &amp; Athay 1973;Asplund 2005;Amarsi et al. 2020).

        <p>The publication of Gaia DR2 (Gaia Collaboration 2018; Lindegren et al. 2018) provided phase space information up to 6 dimensions (coordinates, proper motions, parallaxes, and sometimes also radial velocities) for 1.3 billion stars, and having this information available for essentially all (99 per cent) stars in GALAH has allowed us to make major improvements to our stellar analysis. By combining our knowledge of the (absolute) photometry and spectroscopy of stars, we can break several of the degeneracies in our standalone spectroscopic analyses, which arise due to the fact that absorption lines do not always change to a detectable level as a function of stellar atmospheric parameters. The data analysis process for this third data release from the GALAH collaboration makes use of fundamental correlations, and this quantifiably improves the accuracy and precision of our measurements.The publication of Gaia DR2 (Gaia Collaboration 2018; Lindegren et al. 2018) provided phase space information up to 6 dimensions (coordinates, proper motions, parallaxes, and sometimes also radial velocities) for 1.3 billion stars, and having this information available for essentially all (99 per cent) stars in GALAH has allowed us to make major improvements to our stellar analysis.

        <p>As large Galactic Archaeology-focused surveys continue to collect data (like GALAH in its ongoing Phase 2), the overlap between them increases. This enables us to compare results when analysing stars in the overlap, which have the same stellar labels (stellar parameters, abundances, or other non-spectroscopic stellar information), and it also allows us to propagate labels from one survey on to another (see e.g. Casey et al. 2017;Ho et al. 2017;Xiang et al. 2019;Nandakumar et al. 2020;Wheeler et al. 2020). This label propagation makes it possible to combine these complementary surveys for global mapping of stellar properties and abundances, and we show an example of this in Section 8, placing GALAH+ DR3 data in context with the APOGEE and LAMOST surveys.As large Galactic Archaeology-focused surveys continue to collect data (like GALAH in its ongoing Phase 2), the overlap between them increases.

        <p>This paper is structured as follows: We describe our target selection, observations, and reductions in Section 2. While the target selection and observation of the several projects like K2-HERMES and TESS-HERMES were slightly different from the main GALAH survey, we have reduced and analysed all data (combined under the term GALAH+) in a consistent and homogeneous way. The analysis of the reduction products is described in Section 3, focusing on the description of the general workflow of the analysis group and highlighting changes with respect to the previous release (GALAH DR2). Sections 4 and 5 address the validation efforts for stellar parameters and element abundances, respectively. These address the accuracy and precision of these labels as well as our algorithms to identify and flag peculiar measurements or peculiar stars. Based on experience with the data set, we stress the importance of the flags, but also how complex the flagging estimates are, with several examples of peculiar abundance patterns. We also highlight possible caveats (and possibly peculiar physical correlations) of our analysis in Section 6. We present the contents of the main catalogue of this data release in Section 7. In this section, we also present the Value-Added-Catalogues (VACs) that accompany this release, namely a VAC (see Section 7.3.1) created by cross-matching our targets with Gaia eDR3 (Gaia Collaboration 2021) and the distance estimates by Bailer-Jones et al. (2021), a VAC (see Section 7.3.2) with estimates (such as stellar ages and masses) from isochrone fitting, a VAC (see Section 7.3.3) with stellar kinematic and dynamic estimates, a VAC (see Section 7.3.4) with radial velocity estimates based on different methods, and a VAC (see Section 7.3.5) on parameters of binary systems. While we made use of data from Gaia DR2 (Gaia Collaboration 2018) for our spectroscopic analysis, we also provide a second version of each of our catalogues with new cross-matches and VACs with updated data making use of Gaia eDR3 (Gaia Collaboration 2021), which was published shortly after our data release and supersedes Gaia DR2. We describe all changes of the catalogues between version 1 (based on Gaia DR2) and version 2 (with VACs now based on Gaia eDR3) in Section 7.1. We highlight the scientific potential of the data in this release in context by using the combination of dynamic information and ages together with the element abundances of the main catalogue in Section 8. We focus on Galactic Archaeology on a global scale and the chemodynamical evolution of our Galaxy. Along with the main and value-addedcatalogues of this release, we publish the observed optical spectra for each of the arms of HERMES on the DataCentral3 and provide the scripts used for the analysis as well as post-processing online in an open-source repository4 GALAH+ DR3 was timed to allow the scientific community to directly use abundances together with the latest Gaia eDR3 information.

        <p>While our previous data release (Buder et al. 2018) contained only stars from the main GALAH survey, the current catalogue combines data from multiple projects with different science goals, all conducted with the HERMES spectrograph (Sheinis et al. 2015) and the 2dF fibre positioning system (Lewis et al. 2002) at the 3.9-metre Anglo-Australian Telescope. All the spectra have therefore been processed through the same data reduction pipeline. The collection into a single catalogue, which includes the K2-HERMES (S. Sharma et al., in preparation) and TESS-HERMES (S. Sharma et al., in preparation) surveys, was chosen for ease of use. Full details of these additional surveys are presented in their corresponding data release papers and users are advised to refer to those when using data from these surveys. The column survey name in the catalogue denotes the survey each star belongs to. Data from four main projects, plus a number of smaller observing programmes, are included in GALAH+ DR3. Fig. 1 shows their on-sky distribution. The majority of the stars are nearby, with a median distance of 826 pc (see Fig. 2a), and cover a large variety of stellar types and evolutionary stages, as can be seen in the colour-magnitude diagrams both with Gaia (Fig. 2b) and 2MASS (Fig. 2c) bandpasses.

        <p>The GALAH input catalogue was made by combining the 2MASS (Skrutskie et al. 2006) catalogue of infrared photometry with the UCAC4 (Zacharias et al. 2013) proper motion catalogue. We only included stars with reliable 2MASS data, as captured in their data quality flags (Q='A', B='1', C='0', X='0', A='0', prox≥6 arcsec). We also rejected any star that had a nearby bright neighbour, with a rejection radius dependent on the bright star's V magnitude, such that the potential target is rejected if the bright star is closer than (130 -[10 × V]) arcsec. The APASS photometric catalogue (Henden et al. 2012) was not complete in the Southern sky at the start of GALAH observations in 2013, so we use a synthetic V JK magnitude calculated from 2MASS photometry: V JK = K + 2(J -K + 0.14) + 0.382e ((J -K -0.2)/0.5) . Sharma et al. (2018) demonstrate by using PARSEC isochrones (Marigo et al. 2017) that this is a reasonable approximation for the V magnitude for the types of stars observed in GALAH.The GALAH input catalogue was made by combining the 2MASS (Skrutskie et al. 2006) catalogue of infrared photometry with the UCAC4 (Zacharias et al. 2013) proper motion catalogue.

        <p>Four main projects are included in the GALAH+ DR3 catalogue (GALAH-main, GALAH-faint, K2-HERMES, and TESS-HERMES), each of which has its own selection function. We have attributed each possible pointing of the major sub-surveys to a specific field id, as listed in Table 1. The main GALAH survey takes as potential targets all stars with 12.0 &lt; V JK &lt; 14.0, δ &lt; +10 • and |b| &gt; 10 • in regions of the sky that have at least 400 targets in π square degrees (the 2dF field of view). We then segment this data set into 6546 'fields' with a fixed centre and radius between 0.7 • and 1 • . Fields containing more than 400 stars are observed multiple times with separate target lists. The GALAH-faint programme was aimed at extending survey observations to regions with low target density. The target selection was shifted to 12 &lt; V JK &lt; 14.3 as a way to maintain at least 400 stars per field. The GALAH survey also includes a few other extensions. The GALAH-bright programme targets bright stars (9.0 &lt; V JK &lt; 12.0) to be observed in twilight or poor observing conditions. For bright stars, we use the same field centres as in regular survey observing, and require at least 200 stars per field. The GALAH-ultrafaint programme targets very faint stars 14 &lt; V JK &lt; 16. This was aimed at extending the survey into regions further away from the Sun. These fields were only observed under dark conditions. The K2-HERMES survey leverages the excellent match between the two degree diameter of the 2dF fibre positioner and the five square degrees covered by each detector in the Kepler spacecraft to create an efficiently observed spectroscopic complement for red giants in the K2 campaign fields. The K2-HERMES programme has both 'bright' (10 &lt; V JK &lt; 13) and 'faint' (13 &lt; V JK &lt; 15, J -K S &gt; 0.5) target cohorts, to complement the asteroseismic targets that are the focus of the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program (Stello et al. 2015(Stello et al. , 2017)). Analysis of asteroseismic and spectroscopic data together is key for GALAH+ DR3, and enables in-depth exploration of the structure and history of the Milky Way (e.g. Sharma et al. 2016Sharma et al. , 2019)).

        <p>The TESS-HERMES survey collected spectra for stars in the range 10.0 &lt; V JK &lt; 13.1 in the TESS Southern Continuous Viewing Zone, within 12 • of the Southern ecliptic pole. TESS-HERMES aimed to provide accurate stellar parameters for candidate TESS input catalogue stars (Stassun et al. 2019), to better focus TESS target selection on the most promising asteroseismic targets. The results of the TESS-HERMES project are publicly available, and the project and outputs are described in Sharma et al.

        <p>Since GALAH observes stars mainly nearby stars (81.2 per cent of the sample is within 2 kpc, as shown in Fig. 2), almost all GALAH targets have well measured 5D (99 per cent) or even 6D (45 per cent) information from Gaia (Gaia Collaboration 2018; Lindegren et al. 2018). An overview of the astrometric and spectroscopic quality for the observed stars can be found in Fig. 3(a). The median fractional parallax error for GALAH stars is 2.7 per cent, and 95 per cent (561 229) of GALAH stars have parallax errors below 20 per cent (see panel a). A total of 588 571 of our observations are of stars with matched Gaia parallax measurements. When dividing the sample into giants (T eff &lt;5500 K and M K S &lt; 2 mag) and dwarfs (T eff ≥5500 K or M K S ≥ 2 mag), 96 per cent (369 227/383 088) of the observed dwarf stars have parallax uncertainties below 10 per cent and 70 per cent (140 840/200927) of the observed giant stars have parallax uncertainties below 10 per cent.

        <p>Additionally, the available asteroseismic information is growing steadily as the analysis of data from the K2 campaigns progresses. The overlap between GALAH targets and K2 targets from campaign C1-C8 and C10-C18 has increased to more than 10 000 stars with measured asteroseismic ν max values (Zinn et al. 2020) and spectroscopic information, and covers almost the entire red giant branch (log g ∼ 1.5-3.0 dex) and helium-core burning red clump.Additionally, the available asteroseismic information is growing steadily as the analysis of data from the K2 campaigns progresses.

        <p>The magnitude limited selection of the GALAH survey (see the magnitude distribution in Fig. 4a) causes a strong correlation between increasing distance (and decreasing parallax quality) with increasing luminosity. This tradeoff between luminosity and parallax uncertainty was also visible for the stars in common between Gaia DR1 and GALAH DR2 (Buder et al. 2019) and is still present with the use of Gaia DR2, as we illustrate in Kiel diagrams in Fig. 3(b), showing that especially giants with larger distances suffer from large parallax uncertainties.The magnitude limited selection of the GALAH survey (see the magnitude distribution in Fig. 4a) causes a strong correlation between increasing distance (and decreasing parallax quality) with increasing luminosity.

        <p>GALAH data are acquired with the 3.9-metre Anglo-Australian Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory. Up to 392 stars can be observed simultaneously using the 2dF robotic fibre positioner (Lewis et al. 2002) that sits at the telescope's prime focus. The fibres run to the High Efficiency and Resolution Multi-Element Spectrograph (HERMES; De Silva et al. 2015;Sheinis et al. 2015), where the light is dispersed at R ∼ 28 000 and captured by four independent cameras. HERMES records ∼1000 Å of the optical spectrum across its four non-contiguous channels (4713-4903, 5648-5873, 6478-6737, and 7585-7887 Å).

        <p>Since HERMES was first commissioned, raw data it obtains has been contaminated by odd saturated points with vertical streaking, which was traced back to the choice of glass for the field flattening lens inside each of the four cameras (Martell et al. 2017). The original glass had been chosen for its high index of refraction, but uranium in the glass emitted α particles that caused the saturated points and vertical readout streaks when they were captured by the HERMES CCDs (Edgar et al. 2018). In the first half of 2018, the original field flattening lenses were replaced with lenses made from a less radioactive glass, and the vertical streaks have almost stopped occurring in the data. The point spread function in the HERMES cameras changed as a result of changing the field flattening lenses, and is now larger and less symmetric in the corners of the detectors. As part of HERMES recommissioning, the GALAH team fed light from a Fabry-Perot interferometer into HERMES to characterize the new PSF across each detector, and this information has been incorporated into the data reduction procedure.Since HERMES was first commissioned, raw data it obtains has been contaminated by odd saturated points with vertical streaking, which was traced back to the choice of glass for the field flattening lens inside each of the four cameras (Martell et al. 2017).

        <p>The observing procedure and targeting strategy for this data release are the same as for previous public GALAH data, including the selection of fields via the GALAH-internal OBSMANAGER (keeping track of already observed fields and suggesting fields with lowest airmass at a given observing time for a given programme) and the assignment of targets on to 2dF fibres via CONFIGURE (Miszalski et al. 2006).

        <p>GALAH, K2-HERMES, and TESS-HERMES observers choose from a data base of available fields depending on conditions, limiting the hour angle to within ±2 h whenever possible. The standard observing procedure for regular GALAH survey fields is to take three 1200 s exposures, with an arc lamp and flat lamp exposure taken at the same sky position as each field to enable proper extraction and calibration of the data. Bright-star fields are observed in evening and morning twilight, and when the seeing is too poor for the regular survey fields. They receive three 360 s exposures and the same calibration frames as for the regular fields.GALAH, K2-HERMES, and TESS-HERMES observers choose from a data base of available fields depending on conditions, limiting the hour angle to within ±2 h whenever possible.

        <p>The median seeing at the AAT is 1. 5, and the exposure time is extended by 33 per cent if the seeing is between 2. 0 and 2. 5 and by 100 per cent if the seeing is between 2. 5 and 3. 0. This exposure time was chosen to achieve an S/N of 50 per pixel (equivalent to 100 per resolution element) in the HERMES green channel (CCD 2). This is accomplished in nominal seeing when a star has an apparent magnitude of 14 in the photometric band matched to the camera (B = 14 and CCD 1, V = 14 and CCD 2, etc.) Mismatches between predicted and actual data quality are mainly caused by a combination of seeing, cloud, and airmass. We show the distribution for the actual S/N per pixel as a cumulative distribution for all four HERMES channels in V JK in Fig. 4(c). Depending on the spectral type, the S/N achieved for a given star in each CCD varies (i.e. a hot star will be brighter in the blue and green passbands and fainter in the red and infrared passbands).The median seeing at the AAT is 1. 5, and the exposure time is extended by 33 per cent if the seeing is between 2. 0 and 2. 5 and by 100 per cent if the seeing is between 2. 5 and 3. 0.

        <p>Since the release of GALAH DR2, we have improved our reduction pipeline (Kos et al. 2017), and as a result, all spectra included in DR3 have been reduced using the new, improved pipeline. As in GALAH DR2, raw images are corrected for bias level and flat-field, and cosmic rays are removed with a modified LaCosmic algorithm (van Dokkum 2001). Scattered light and fibre cross-talk signals are removed. The wavelength solution for the extracted spectra is found via fitting of ThXe arc lamp observations. Sky spectra are modelled from the 25 sky fibres included in each field and subtracted, and synthetic telluric lines are computed using 
            <rs type="software">MOLECFIT</rs> (Kausch et al. 2015;Smette et al. 2015) and removed from observed spectra. The reduction pipeline runs a cross-correlation with AMBRE spectra (De Laverny et al. 2012) to provide a first estimate of the stellar parameters effective temperature T eff , surface gravity log g, iron abundance [Fe/H], as well as radial velocity v rad , and to normalize the spectra.
        </p>
        <p>The main improvement is the wavelength solution, which is now more stable at the edges of the green and red CCDs, where we lack arc lines. This has been achieved by monitoring the solution and fixing the polynomial describing the pixel-to-wavelength transformation, if deviations from a typical or average solution are detected. The solution is described by a 4th order Chebyshev polynomial. We use IRAF's IDENTIFY function to find the positions of arc lines in each image and match them with our linelist. Fitting the solution, however, is now done in a more elaborate way. Initially, all spectra from the same image are allowed to have an independent solution. Then the four coefficients of the Chebyshev polynomial are compared. The first coefficient defines the zero-point. Because the 2dF fibres are not arranged monotonically in the pseudo-slit, the first coefficient is truly independent of the spectrum number (spectra being numbered 1 to 400 in each image). The values of the other three coefficients should be a smooth function of the spectrum number. If a coefficient for a specific spectrum deviates by more than 3σ from a smooth function, it is corrected to lie on the smooth function. This successfully fixes the previous problems with incorrect wavelength solutions at the edge of the image.The main improvement is the wavelength solution, which is now more stable at the edges of the green and red CCDs, where we lack arc lines.

        <p>Our improved reduction pipeline also features an improved parametrization of cross-talk. It can only be measured in larger gaps between every 10th spectrum. Cross-talk was previously represented as a function of the position in the image, but now each batch of 10 spectra (from one slitlet) is assigned the measured cross-talk without any interpolation. The cross-talk is still a function of the direction along the dispersion axis. The normalization has been improved with a new identification of continuum sections (regions of a spectrum where the continuum is measured) and optimized polynomial orders. The pipeline has been actively maintained and adapted to perform well with the recommissioned instrument following the replacement of the field flattening lenses in 2018 May. Other minor improvements and computing optimizations were made.Our improved reduction pipeline also features an improved parametrization of cross-talk.

        <p>As we lay out in the next section, with the analysis approach via spectrum synthesis chosen for GALAH+ DR3, we will not make use of the full spectra of GALAH, but restrict ourselves to absorption features with reliable line information for spectrum synthesis, when estimating stellar parameters and abundances.As we lay out in the next section, with the analysis approach via spectrum synthesis chosen for GALAH+ DR3, we will not make use of the full spectra of GALAH, but restrict ourselves to absorption features with reliable line information for spectrum synthesis, when estimating stellar parameters and abundances.</p>
        <p>In this section, we describe how the outputs from the data reduction process are used to estimate the final stellar parameters for each spectrum as well as up to 30 element abundances. The starting points for the analysis are the products of the reduction pipeline, described in Section 2.3, that is reduced spectra, initial estimates of radial velocity v rad , as well as initial estimates of the stellar parameters T eff , log g, and [Fe/H]. Contrary to GALAH DR2, we do not use the reduction-pipeline based, v rad -shifted, normalized spectra for the spectrum analysis of this release.In this section, we describe how the outputs from the data reduction process are used to estimate the final stellar parameters for each spectrum as well as up to 30 element abundances.

        <p>The two most important differences to the workflow of our analysis are the following: First, we are using astrometric information from the Gaia mission to break spectroscopic degeneracies. Secondly, we do not use data-driven approaches for the spectrum analysis in GALAH+ DR3, but only the spectrum synthesis code 
            <rs type="software">Spectroscopy</rs> Made Easy (Valenti &amp; Piskunov 1996; Piskunov &amp; Valenti 2017, hereafter SME), which had only been used for the training set analysis in DR2. We visualize the reasons for this step with the comparison of GALAH DR2 and DR3 in Fig. 5. We found in DR2 that stars at the periphery in stellar label space, e.g. high temperature (compare panels a and d) or low metallicity (compare panels b and e) did not receive optimal labels from the data-driven process.
        </p>
        <p>Data-driven models that also use astrometric information may likely perform equally well as, or possibly better than, our DR3 analysis for many aspects. In DR3, we chose to apply the more traditional method to the full sample to assess the limitations of the data-driven approach. This includes testing the flexibility of the model we used, as we found that quadratic models (as used for GALAH DR2) are too inflexible to be applicable across the entire stellar parameter space. Training by using χ 2 -optimization may give too much weight to outliers. Furthermore, we want the results to be independent of the exact selection criteria used to define the training set, since data-driven models can struggle to inter-and extrapolate for spectra which are not sufficiently represented and modelled in the training step. Limited by the scope of the training set, we had to flag several abundance measurements for a vast majority of elements, where we suspected extrapolation. The flagged results are shown as the lighter blue background in Fig. 5, where we find in panel (a) that some of the inferred stellar parameters are unphysical, such as the upturn in the low-mass main sequence and the correlation between T eff and log g for hot stars. The effect of flagging on the number of inferred stellar abundances can best be seen in the drastic increase in Li detections in DR3 (compare panels c and f), where detections in DR2 were limited to warm dwarfs and Li-rich giants. This was a direct result of the choice of training set stars, with the numbers of detections in DR2 being further lowered by our use of more conservative criteria of detections for lines.Data-driven models that also use astrometric information may likely perform equally well as, or possibly better than, our DR3 analysis for many aspects. In DR3, we chose to apply the more traditional method to the full sample to assess the limitations of the data-driven approach. This includes testing the flexibility of the model we used, as we found that quadratic models (as used for GALAH DR2) are too inflexible to be applicable across the entire stellar parameter space. Training by using χ 2 -optimization may give too much weight to outliers.

        <p>Being able to estimate reliable stellar parameters for hot stars (see panel d) has also enabled the determination of several of their abundance patterns, which was not possible in DR2. Intriguingly, some of the A-and F-type main sequence stars exhibit underabundant [α/Fe](see lowest measurements in panel e) and overabundant iron-peak and neutron-capture elements, which is the peculiar chemical compositions of Am/Fm stars (see e.g. Xiang et al. 2020). In DR3, we are also able to estimate more accurate element abundances for metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] &lt; -1 dex), in particular those with the previously identified low-α5 'outer' halo pattern (see e.g. Nissen &amp; Schuster 2010).Being able to estimate reliable stellar parameters for hot stars (see panel d) has also enabled the determination of several of their abundance patterns, which was not possible in DR2.

        <p>For this data release, we run the analysis pipeline only for spectra that have initial radial velocity estimates either as part of previous unflagged GALAH data releases, unflagged measurements from the DR3 reduction pipeline, or from Gaussian fits to the Balmer lines with less than 5 km s -1 uncertainty. We therefore excluded 81 007 spectra6 ). Further we restrict this release to stars with external information on parallaxes from Gaia (Lindegren et al. 2018), thus excluding 9080 spectra. For a few tens of bright stars that are not in Gaia DR2, we take distances and parallaxes from Hipparcos (van Leeuwen 2007), which can be identified via missing extended astrometric information. (f). The stellar parameters and abundances from GALAH DR2 appear more tightly constrained, but we note that this is an artefact of the data-driven approach, which tends to find solutions closer to the mean parameter/abundance patterns. We include all DR2 and DR3 stars in these panels, and not just the stars common to both to highlight the increase in observations, accuracy of stellar parameters, and coverage of abundances, rather than the improvement in precision for the same spectra.For this data release, we run the analysis pipeline only for spectra that have initial radial velocity estimates either as part of previous unflagged GALAH data releases, unflagged measurements from the DR3 reduction pipeline, or from Gaussian fits to the Balmer lines with less than 5 km s -1 uncertainty.

        <p>Our general workflow follows the same approach as the spectrum synthesis analysis for DR2, with the aim to homogeneously and automatically analyse a large number of spectra that intrinsically look very different. The analysis is divided into two fundamental steps: first, we estimate the stellar parameters; and secondly, we keep the stellar parameters fixed while only fitting one abundance at a time for the different lines/elements in the GALAH wavelength range. For the stellar parameter estimation (first step), we first perform a normalization and a first rough stellar parameter fit with one iteration, followed by a final normalization and finer parameter fit that is iterated on until convergence. For this, we limit ourselves to 46 selected segments of the GALAH spectra which include the lines with reliable line data for the stellar parameter analysis, as described in detail in Section 3.3. For the abundance analysis (second step), we perform only one normalization and iteratively optimize the abundance based on those data points of the lines/elements that we estimate to be unblended enough after comparing a synthetic spectrum with all lines with another one that only has the lines of the element in question. To achieve most accurate results, our analysis is based on the most recent line data, atmosphere grids, and grids to compute departures from the common LTE assumption during the line formation, as described in detail in Section 3.3.

        <p>The non-LTE grids of departure coefficients that we use for the onthe-fly synthesis of 1D non-LTE spectra are described in Amarsi et al. (2020). In brief, new grids of departure coefficients were constructed by adopting the non-LTE model atoms presented for H (Amarsi et al. 2018a), Li (Lind, Asplund &amp; Barklem 2009;Wang et al. 2021), C (Amarsi et al. 2019), O (Amarsi et al. 2018b), Na (Lind et al. 2011), Mg (Osorio et al. 2015), Al (Nordlander &amp; Lind 2017), Si (Amarsi &amp; Asplund 2017), K (Reggiani et al. 2019), Ca (Osorio et al. 2019), Mn (Bergemann et al. 2019), and Ba (Gallagher et al. 2020), and running on the MARCS model atmosphere grid using the non-LTE radiative transfer code BALDER (Amarsi et al. 2018a), a modified version of MULTI3D (Leenaarts &amp; Carlsson 2009). For Fe, the same non-LTE grids of departure coefficients that were used in GALAH DR2 were adopted here (Amarsi et al. 2016;Lind et al. 2017). As we demonstrated in Amarsi et al. (2020), relaxing LTE reduces the dispersion in the [X/Fe] versus [Fe/H] plane significantly, for example by 0.1 dex for Mg and Si, and it can remove spurious differences between the dwarfs and giants by up to 0.2 dex. Recent progress in this field will allow the implementation of non-LTE also for other large surveys (Amarsi et al. 2020;Osorio et al. 2020). The use of non-LTE grids is unique to GALAH, whereas most other current major surveys, like APOGEE (Jönsson et al. 2020), RAVE (Steinmetz et al. 2020a), and Gaia-ESO (Smiljanic et al. 2014) report 1D LTE results in their public data releases.The non-LTE grids of departure coefficients that we use for the onthe-fly synthesis of 1D non-LTE spectra are described in Amarsi et al.

We want to stress that these are not the final average uncertainties, but that these values were chosen after extensive tests of ensuring enough isochrone points to be considered for the mass interpolation within the uncertainties. For the final uncertainties of this release, we use a more sophisticated implementation (see Section 4). We convert the iron abundances into a measurement of metallicity Z by assuming the α enhancement to follow the stellar parameter relation laid out later in this section and combine this [α/Fe] and the atmospheric iron abundance to [M/H] via the correlation by Salaris &amp; Cassisi (2006) and into Z with the Solar value from the PARSEC+COLIBRI isochrones (Bressan et al. 2012;Marigo et al. 2017). We then use these PARSEC+COLIBRI isochrones on a grid with ages of 0.5...(0.5)...13.5 Gyr and [Fe/H] = -2.4...(0.1)...0.6 dex to estimate maximum-likelihood masses on-the-fly.As we do not have final uncertainties for the stars at this stage of the analysis, we assume that the parameter uncertainties σ i are 100 K, 0.5 dex, 0.2 dex, and 0.1 • L bol for T eff , log g, [Fe/H], and L bol , respectively. We want to stress that these are not the final average uncertainties, but that these values were chosen after extensive tests of ensuring enough isochrone points to be considered for the mass interpolation within the uncertainties.

These are initialized consistently with the MARCS pattern from the Solar abundances of Grevesse et al. (2007). This notation is different from the usual A(X) = A x = log (X) and we thus convert them when reading out the final abundance pattern.

        <p>Line-by-line versus combined abundance analysis was selected based on the time and computation resources available. We have therefore measured only the following elements line-by-line (and report a value based on error-weighted means): α (see next paragraph), Li, C, K, Ti, V, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Mo, Ru, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu. To estimate the abundance of the following elements, we ran combined all lines of the particular elements to fit a global abundance at the same time: O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ba. We want to stress that the use of non-LTE grids does not affect the computation time. We chose to run several elements in a combined way because of the ongoing developments of their line selection or non-LTE grids. During the development of the pipeline we have tested all individual lines for the elements run with non-LTE and only selected those with similar trends and absolute abundances to run combined. By using individual lines, we are less prone to unreliable line data, such as unreliable log gf values. Incorrect oscillator strengths introduce a bias in the absolute abundance for each line. When the Solar abundance for these lines are however estimated independently from the others, they can still be used for the combined [X/Fe] abundance, after applying individual Sun-based corrections to the absolute abundances (see Table A2).Line-by-line versus combined abundance analysis was selected based on the time and computation resources available.

        <p>Alpha-enhancement [α/Fe] is treated differently during the stellar parameter estimation step and the abundance determination step for each of the alpha-elements. In all cases, we initialize the abundances with the scaled-Solar pattern. We then adjust the alpha-enhancement for the elements O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Ti with the common enhancement pattern of [α/Fe] = 0.4 dex for [Fe/H] ≤ -1.0 dex as well as [α/Fe] = 0.0 dex for [Fe/H] ≥ 0.0 dex and a linear function between both iron abundances. We update this value consistently whenever [Fe/H] changes. For the individual lines of O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti as part of GALAH+ DR3, we then update their actual abundances while keeping the other abundances fixed. The final reported global [α/Fe] = alpha fe is then an error-weighted combination of selected Mg,Si,Ca,and Ti lines (Mg5711,combined Si,combined Ca, Ti4758, Ti4759, Ti4782, Ti4802, Ti4820, andTi5739). We stress however, that this combination is dependent on the detection of these lines and might come down to a single measurement, whereas other estimates are a combination of up to 9 measurements.Alpha-enhancement [α/Fe] is treated differently during the stellar parameter estimation step and the abundance determination step for each of the alpha-elements.

        <p>Upper limits are calculated for all measured lines/elements if no detection was possible. In this case, we estimate the smallest abundance needed to explain the strength of a line, that is the difference of line to continuum flux in the normalized spectrum of at least 0.03 or at least 1.5/(S/N) in the line mask. We interpolate these values from pre-computed estimates of line strengths for a set of stellar parameters and abundances. This approach was chosen and tested to estimate a larger number of upper limits for Li, but we want to caution the users to not blindly use them because we have not performed extensive tests for the other elements. They should only be used when essential for the science case and after thorough inspection of the observed and synthetic spectra.Upper limits are calculated for all measured lines/elements if no detection was possible.

        <p>In this section, we describe the tests that we perform to validate the stellar parameters we obtain in terms of their accuracy (systematic uncertainties) and precision. In addition, we then describe several other algorithms that we have developed in order to identify peculiar stars or spectra -cases for which our standard pipeline might fail. The result of the performed quality tests are summarized in the stellar parameter flag flag sp with flags that can be raised explained in Section 4.3. We do strongly recommend that all users take these flags into account, and make use of them unless the flags are explicitly not advisable for their particular science case. By default we recommend to use quantities with flag sp 0, as this indicates that the stellar parameter estimates have passed all quality tests. Several influences on the accuracy, like unresolved binarity, as well as some possible systematics / caveats that we have not been able to quantify and therefore not flag, are addressed in Section 6.In this section, we describe the tests that we perform to validate the stellar parameters we obtain in terms of their accuracy (systematic uncertainties) and precision.

        <p>The surface gravities we obtain are in excellent agreement with the accepted values for the GBS (Heiter et al. 2015b;Jofré et al. 2018), as expected given that both studies used the same approach to estimate these via bolometric relations. Due to the different implementations of this method, it is however reassuring to see the excellent agreement and low scatter (second panel of Fig. 6). We note a slight disagreement for the highest bolometric luminosities and masses, which cancel each other out and lead to a good agreement in log g. The only outlier of these measurements is the giant star HD 107328 (which has the largest relative mass and log g uncertainty of the GBS and a significant change from Hipparcos to Gaia parallaxes); however, both T eff and [Fe/H] are in excellent agreement with the GBS values.The surface gravities we obtain are in excellent agreement with the accepted values for the GBS (Heiter et al. 2015b;Jofré et al. 2018), as expected given that both studies used the same approach to estimate these via bolometric relations.

        <p>To test the GALAH+ DR3 pipeline, we analyse a subset of 3175 spectra, for which asteroseismic ν max estimates were available from the seismic SYD pipeline (Huber et al. 2009) as part of the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program (GAP) data release 3 (J. Zinn et al., in preparation). We compare the GALAH+ DR3 pipeline ('bolometric' or 'lbol' pipeline) with an adjusted version ('asteroseismic' or 'seis' pipeline) that uses the empirical (metallicity-independent) asteroseismic scaling relations of solar-like oscillators (see e.g. Kjeldsen &amp; Bedding 1995;Bedding et al. 2010):To test the GALAH+ DR3 pipeline, we analyse a subset of 3175 spectra, for which asteroseismic ν max estimates were available from the seismic SYD pipeline (Huber et al. 2009) as part of the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program (GAP) data release 3 (J.

The difference in estimated T eff of -20 +25 -26 K and [Fe/H] atmo of -0.02 0.03 -0.03 dex are both very small. Additionally, we have used the pipeline where log g is a free parameter for the spectrum fit ('free') to assess the improvement of our parameter estimation thanks to the use of external information (see Fig. 8). The 'free' pipeline can only estimate log g from the spectra and shows a significant scatter (especially for the red clump stars) for this stellar parameter, which propagates into larger scatter for T eff and [Fe/H]as well. With the new constraints on log g from external information from astrometry and photometry, the scatter of all parameters decreases significantly and the red clump stars show a tight distribution around log g ∼ 2.4 dex. This is consistent with the most reliable measurements, which take into account asteroseismic information (right-hand panels), although even finer structure within this small sample such as the separation between the red clump and the RGB bump is only seen when seismology is included.with ν max, = 3090 μHz (Huber et al. 2017) and T eff, = 5772 K (see Table A3).

            <rs type="software">SYD-pipeline</rs> K2 GAP measurements from J. Zinn et al. (in preparation) overlapping with GALAH+ DR3. When comparing the difference of the final values for log g estimated via equation (8) (seis) and GALAH+ DR3 (lbol) in Fig. 9(a), we see that both the difference and the scatter of the log g values has decreased from -0.06 ± 0.29 dex in GALAH DR2 (see fig. 17 from Buder et al. 2018) to -0.04 +0.12 -0.11 dex on average and we see a good agreement with the majority of asteroseismic values (colourbar) for a large parameter range of 2 dex. We note that the raw measurements of the K2 GAP overlap included 7.5 per cent K2 dwarf observations that were blended by giants in the K2 data, a slightly higher number than the 4 per cent blends found for the Kepler field (Hon et al. 2019). In the final K2 GAP sample, only a few tens of dwarfs (see high log g stars in Fig. 9b) are likely blends.

As discussed when introducing the final error estimation with equation ( 7), the two precision estimates should be the same and we thus rescale the internal SME- based uncertainties with a combination of factors and shifts, noted as (factor,shift) with (3,7.5) for T eff ,(4,0.01) for [Fe/H], (2,0.0125) for [Fe/H] atmo , (1.75,0.3) for v broad , and (2.0,0.15) for v rad towards a minimum difference with respect to the exponential fit for the repeat observations (black curve in Fig. 10).

However, for the intermediate [Fe/H] clusters NGC 1851, NGC 288, and NGC 362 we find disagreement with Harris (1996), for which we have no explanation. While APOGEE DR16 also has higher [Fe/H] for NGC 1851 (-1.08 ± 0.07 dex) and NGC 362 (-1.09 ± 0.05 dex), their [Fe/H]for NGC 288 agrees with Harris (1996). We note that the parallax uncertainties of stars in each of the three clusters is 30-40 per cent, which is significant and significantly higher than the uncertainties for 95 per cent of GALAH's targets. Taking also into account the parallax uncertainties of NGC 7099 and NGC 5139 of on average 60 and 46 per cent respectively, we conclude that these clusters are not suitable to reliably validate our pipeline.We also have observed several globular clusters, and plot the Kiel diagrams as well as [Fe/H] histograms for four of them, namely 47 Tuc, NGC 288, NGC 7099 (M30), and NGC 5139 (ω Cen) in the four panels of Fig. 12.

        <p>We used the approach by El-Badry &amp; Rix (2018) to select wide binaries using Gaia and further limit the selection to those with similar GALAH+ DR3 v rad (within 1 km s -1 ). We find 268 pairs, including dwarf-giant pairs. In Fig. 13 we plot the stellar parameters T eff , log g, [Fe/H], and v rad to illustrate the difference of [Fe/H] and v rad for these stars with sometimes quite different stellar parameters. We want to stress that we include also stars with flag sp up to 128 (for example the very cool, flagged stars as well as apparent photometric binary stars with unreliable log g). As previous studies have shown (El-Badry et al. 2018b;El-Badry &amp; Rix 2018), we expect very similar abundances for these pairs and indeed can confirm that their [Fe/H] and v rad are consistent within the uncertainties for almost all cases. The average differences of v rad = -0.05 ± 0.41 km s -1 and [Fe/H] = -0.01 ± 0.08 dex show excellent agreement over large scales (when neglecting the 8 outliers of 268 pairs, shown in red). We furthermore do not see significant trends of the differences of [Fe/H]with T eff , log g, [Fe/H], or v rad , which lends confidence that our analysis is reliable within the stellar parameter range of the observed wide binaries. Even most of the dwarf-giant pairs show a very good agreement.We used the approach by El-Badry &amp; Rix (2018) to select wide binaries using Gaia and further limit the selection to those with similar GALAH+ DR3 v rad (within 1 km s -1 ).

        <p>After the stellar parameters have been estimated, we raise flags according to the individual criteria listed in Table 4. Fig. 14 shows the derived parameter values associated with all flagged spectra. The most used flags are 8 (8.6 per cent), 1 (8.5 per cent), 256 (8.0 per cent), 4 (5.6 per cent), 512 (2.4 per cent), and 1024 (2.2 per cent). Less than 2 per cent of spectra have raised flags 2, 16, 32, 64, or 128.After the stellar parameters have been estimated, we raise flags according to the individual criteria listed in Table 4.

        <p>As for GALAH DR2 (Buder et al. 2018), we have applied the algorithm developed by Traven et al. (2017), which combined the dimensionality reduction method t-SNE (van der Maaten &amp; Hinton 2008) with the clustering algorithm 
            <rs type="software">DBSCAN</rs> (Ester et al. 1996) to arrange similar looking spectra close to each other. With these techniques we have been able to identify clusters of spectra with reduction issues, emission features, as well as clear line-splitting binaries. We have further identified possible astrometric binaries or No measurement available pre-main sequence stars (flag sp = 64) by selecting the oldest PARSEC isochrones for the particular iron abundance of each star and selecting all stars with surface gravity lower by log g = 0.15 and cooler by T eff = 150 K. This selection is most effective for the identification of binaries on the secondary main-sequence (with slightly lower log g). For stars with equal bolometric luminosity, for example a binary system with the same stellar parameters, the estimated log g can be smaller by up to ∼0.3. This deviation can be approximated via equation (1) when assuming that the bolometric luminosity of the system is twice that of a single star and the mass is estimated to be that of a single star, so that log g ∼log L bol,binary + log L bol,single = -log (2 • L bol,single ) + log L bol,single = -log 2. We have also identified unreliable parameter estimates for the coolest bright giants, for which unreasonably low iron abundances have been estimated (see tip of the RGB in Fig. 14d with many stars with incorrectly low [Fe/H]). We elaborate on this in Section 6 when addressing v mic and metallicity trends. Based on the overall distribution of stars in the S/N versus χ 2 plane (median χ 2 = 0.748), we have implemented a χ 2 flag (flag sp = 128) for χ 2 &gt; 0.1 • S/N + exp (0.08 • S/N)

Unlike for GALAH DR2, we are now not limited by the influence of the training set for this data release.

        <p>For our accuracy studies (Section 5.1), the techniques we could adopt for comparisons with accurate benchmark are limited. Contrary to the stellar parameters, where multiple methods, and especially those which are independent of spectroscopy, are available for accuracy estimations, the available benchmarks for abundance accuracy are based on spectroscopy and -with exception of the Sun and Solar twins -also strongly limited in terms of accuracy (e.g. due to neglected 3D and non-LTE effects). We are therefore only using the Sun and Solar twins to validate the accuracy of our measurements to zeroth order (abundance zero points). We do not assess our abundance accuracy quantitatively beyond this, but we do also investigate systematic trends with respect to other spectroscopic studies presented in the literature. We want to stress that a proper estimation of the accuracy uncertainties would have to involve the systematic influence of the individual stellar parameters within their uncertainties, the uncertainties of the absolute abundances / zero points in terms of log gf values and additional uncertainties from the fit to the sky flat, Arcturus, the comparison with the Solar circle sample, as well as the Solar twin comparison. For computational reasons we have not been able to quantify all of these influences, but report them if possible (see e.g. Table A2).For our accuracy studies (Section 5.1), the techniques we could adopt for comparisons with accurate benchmark are limited.

        <p>Following the definition of the bracket notation, the Solar value A(X1234) should be strictly estimated from the measurement of the particular line in the Solar spectrum. For several lines within the GALAH wavelength range, however, we are facing difficulties in estimating the Solar A(X1234). First, via 2df-HERMES, we can only perform sky (flat) observations rather than observing the Sun directly. Secondly, our observation setup is much shorter as for the normal setup of our observations. Thirdly, some lines are either not detectable (even within high S/N spectra) or their equivalent width or line strength does not increase significantly with increasing A(X), that is, we perform a measurement at a plateau on the curve of growth. Contrary to many other studies or surveys, we choose to report the absolute abundances, and only use laboratory oscillator strengths (log gf) rather than tuning these astrophysically based on the Solar spectrum with literature abundances. There are thus several solutions available to still estimate abundance zero points, which we will discuss subsequently:Following the definition of the bracket notation, the Solar value A(X1234) should be strictly estimated from the measurement of the particular line in the Solar spectrum.

For such stars, these and other studies (e.g. Nissen 2015) have found tight correlations with abundances and stellar ages, that is, chemical clocks.

For Ni and Cu, the difference is still well within the uncertainties. We are unsure of the origin of the larger differences for Mg and Cr; especially since our other zero-point comparisons (Table A2) show agreement to better than 0.05 dex.

        <p>Similar to GALAH DR2, we could assess the element abundances for selected clusters with numerous observed members. These are, however, not useful in a straightforward manner to estimate the accuracy and precision of our measurements, due to internal processes like atomic diffusion and dredge-up changing the observed photospheric abundances for different evolutionary stages for open clusters (see e.g. Bertelli Motta et al. 2018;Gao et al. 2018;Souto et al. 2018Souto et al. , 2019) ) as well as the presence of multiple populations in Since we lack good calibrators for these abundances, we choose to include overviews of several abundances for open clusters, as we expect the evolutionary effect within these to be seen, but predictable. Significant differences in abundances above the expected evolutionary effects are therefore indicative of systematic trends within our analysis. A more detailed analysis of abundances and trends in open and globular clusters will be performed in the studies by Spina et al. (2021) Some of the differences that we find between dwarfs and giants in two of the open clusters with many members, namely M 67 (NGC 2682) and Ruprecht 147, are however significantly higher than would be expected from such evolutionary effects. We list the 16/50/84th percentiles for both clusters separated into dwarfs (T eff ≥ 5500 K or log g ≥ 3.5 dex) and giants (T eff &lt; 5500 K and log g &lt; 3.5 dex) in Table 6. While for M 67 the agreement seems quite good for most elements in view of the average precision uncertainties, we find significant differences between dwarfs and giants for Al, Ni, Zn, Ba, and La for both clusters. We also find significant differences in at least one cluster for O, Na, Si, Ti II, V, Zr, Ce, Nd, and Sm. We will elaborate more on these findings in Section 6.5, where we describe caveats of abundances for Solar and metal-rich giants, especially for the elements Al, Ti II, Ni, and Ba, which seem to show in general elevated values for Solar and metal-rich giants.Similar to GALAH DR2, we could assess the element abundances for selected clusters with numerous observed members. These are, however, not useful in a straightforward manner to estimate the accuracy and precision of our measurements, due to internal processes like atomic diffusion and dredge-up changing the observed photospheric abundances for different evolutionary stages for open clusters (see e.g. Bertelli Motta et al. 2018;Gao et al. 2018;Souto et al. 2018Souto et al. , 2019) ) as well as the presence of multiple populations in Since we lack good calibrators for these abundances, we choose to include overviews of several abundances for open clusters, as we expect the evolutionary effect within these to be seen, but predictable. Significant differences in abundances above the expected evolutionary effects are therefore indicative of systematic trends within our analysis. A more detailed analysis of abundances and trends in open and globular clusters will be performed in the studies by Spina et al. (2021) Some of the differences that we find between dwarfs and giants in two of the open clusters with many members, namely M 67 (NGC 2682) and Ruprecht 147, are however significantly higher than would be expected from such evolutionary effects. We list the 16/50/84th percentiles for both clusters separated into dwarfs (T eff ≥ 5500 K or log g ≥ 3.5 dex) and giants (T eff &lt; 5500 K and log g &lt; 3.5 dex) in Table 6. While for M 67 the agreement seems quite good for most elements in view of the average precision uncertainties, we find significant differences between dwarfs and giants for Al, Ni, Zn, Ba, and La for both clusters. We also find significant differences in at least one cluster for O, Na, Si, Ti II, V, Zr, Ce, Nd, and Sm. We will elaborate more on these findings in Section 6.5, where we describe caveats of abundances for Solar and metal-rich giants, especially for the elements Al, Ti II, Ni, and Ba, which seem to show in general elevated values for Solar and metal-rich giants.</p>
        <p>We use wide binaries from GALAH, selected using the algorithms presented in El-Badry &amp; Rix (2018), for the validation of our elemental abundances, in the same way as described earlier for [Fe/H]. We plot the difference in element abundances of the two components for different nucleosynthesis channels in Fig. 17. For this comparison, we limit ourselves to those stars with similar [Fe/H](within 0.25 dex) and similar v rad (within 1 km s -1 ), and no raised stellar parameter flags. The average differences of these stars, which are believed to (on average) share very similar composition, are typically small as a function of [Fe/H], T eff , and log g, as shown in the left-hand, middle, and right-hand panels for the α-enhancement, O, Na, Si, Mn, and Ba, confirming that our analysis works rather well for stars with similar astrometric information.We use wide binaries from GALAH, selected using the algorithms presented in El-Badry &amp; Rix (2018), for the validation of our elemental abundances, in the same way as described earlier for [Fe/H].

        <p>For completeness, we list the average differences of all analysed elements in Table 7 together with their average quoted uncertainties from GALAH+ DR3. If our assumptions of equal chemical compositions among the binary stars are correct, one would expect no bias between their measured element abundances and a scatter corresponding to the measurements uncertainty. For many of these elements, we see an overall small average difference between the binary components among the elements for which we had enough abundance estimates of both components. Only for O, V, Zr, La, Ce, and Sm we see a disagreement above 0.05 dex. For these elements, however, we note that the scatter is larger compared to the other elements suggesting less precise measurements. This is confirmed by the larger precision uncertainties, confirming that our precision estimates are reliable, although not always to scale. While the scatter of the binary differences and the average reported uncertainties agree roughly for most elements, they differ significantly for Li, O, Ti II, V, La, Ce, and Sm, suggesting that our uncertainties due to precision are underestimated for these particular elements or accuracy uncertainties play an important role, which is neglected in our analysis. We can also not exclude the possibility that there are actual differences in the abundances of the wide binaries, which is expected at least for Li for binary components at different T eff .For completeness, we list the average differences of all analysed elements in Table 7 together with their average quoted uncertainties from GALAH+ DR3.

        <p>We assess the precision of our element abundances by comparing the internal SME covariance uncertainties with those from repeat observations of the same star in Fig. 18. In contrast with the case for the stellar parameter estimation, we see that the covariance errors from the individual line measurements are typically in good agreement for almost all lines. The standard deviations of the measurements are also consistent irrespective of the fibre combination. We note, however, that our final estimates of the internal SME- based uncertainties are lower than those from the repeat observations, when a large number of lines is fitted in combination rather than line-by-line, in particular Fe, which we discussed in Section 4.2. This suggests that either the SME-internal method has problems in estimating realistic errors when many pixels are involved, or that our spectrum quality indicator (snr c2 iraf) is not representative in those cases. With the exception of Fe, we have however managed to estimate abundances of elements with many lines in a line-by-line manner, such that the fitting and repeat uncertainty show a similar behaviour. Unlike for the case of the stellar parameter estimation, we only report the final abundance uncertainty based on the maximum of the raw internal covariance error for the abundance fit and the S/N-scaled repeat observation uncertainty.We assess the precision of our element abundances by comparing the internal SME covariance uncertainties with those from repeat observations of the same star in Fig. 18.

        <p>As for all of our previous GALAH releases, we want to stress that we discourage the use of flagged element abundances without consideration of the possible systematic trends that these probably less reliable measurements can introduce. However, setting flags for element abundance measurements is extremely difficult and will never be perfect. In this section, we lay out which flags we have implemented. We also point to identified possible caveats, where no flags are raised, but caution should be applied. The major abundance flags are reported as flag X fe for each element X and are listed in Table 4. For the final element abundances, we only report measurements that have passed all our quality checks with no flag raised or are an upper limit (with flag 1, see our description of upper limits in Section 3.3). For ease of use we have raised a flag value 32 if the measurement is not reported, because it did not pass the quality checks.As for all of our previous GALAH releases, we want to stress that we discourage the use of flagged element abundances without consideration of the possible systematic trends that these probably less reliable measurements can introduce.

        <p>For each individual abundance measurement (ind X1234 fe for line/combined measurements X1234), we have run a series of quality checks, which are summarized in the ind flag X1234 as listed in Table 4. These include a check of the χ 2 values (value 2), where we raise a warning, if the χ 2 value is above a very high S/N-depending threshold (estimated to be around 16 for S/N = 10, 20 for S/N = 35, and 160 for S/N = 100 from the general χ 2 -S/N trend for the elements, compared to the typical median χ 2 value of 0.5 to 1.0 at S/N = 35). A warning flag 4 for an imprecise or likely saturated measurement was raised, if the fitting uncertainty was above 0.3 dex or twice the expected uncertainty from repeat observations. We raise a flag value 8, if the wavelength solution around the Li line at 6708 Å is questionable, that is, when our Li fits with and without an additional v rad fit just at this particular spectrum region result in a difference above 10 km s -1 . We report individual measurements, but raise a flag 16, if we do not trust the stellar parameters (flag sp ≥ 128). Flag value 32 is raised, if the measurement was not successful, that is if no stellar parameters were available or the line was too shallow or too blended.For each individual abundance measurement (ind X1234 fe for line/combined measurements X1234), we have run a series of quality checks, which are summarized in the ind flag X1234 as listed in Table 4.

        <p>As we elaborate in the next section, we have identified several possible caveats, for which we have not implemented an algorithm to raise a flag, either because we could not find a way to automatically identify the caveats, or we are unsure if the measurements should be flagged.

        <p>In the previous sections, we have laid out the methods by which we flag unphysical results and spectra with peculiarities for which our pipeline is likely to underperform. However, we cannot visually inspect all of the more than 30 million measurements that have been performed for this data release. Furthermore, we aim to not follow up all of the possible correlations in full detail, because many of these pose problems to understand the possible astrophysical nature of these trends (as shown later in Section 6.3 for atomic diffusion causing systematic differences of surface abundances in open cluster stars). Instead, we choose to leave such efforts for future scientific follow-up.In the previous sections, we have laid out the methods by which we flag unphysical results and spectra with peculiarities for which our pipeline is likely to underperform.

        <p>In this section, we address several possible caveats, for which we either have not yet found or implemented a solution, or believe that these results could indeed be of an astrophysical nature. We give examples for peculiar abundance patterns and show an example where the pattern (of Am/Fm stars) is truly representing the observed surface abundances when assuming ionization equilibrium. In other cases, especially for the most metal-rich as well as coolest giant stars, we are aware that our pipeline is likely introducing systematic trends that may be ascribed first to our use of standard 1D hydrostatic model atmospheres (although the effect is partly mitigated by fudge parameters that can be tuned to mimic the effects of convection), secondly to our partly unreliable or incomplete molecular line data, and thirdly to the lack of true continuum points to use for the spectrum normalization in these stars. In the latter case, the pseudo-continuum placement can correlate strongly with the stellar parameters (especially [Fe/H]) and lead to systematic trends in the reported measurements. We address possible influences on the reliability of surface gravities and finally also lay out considerations of the uncertainties and describe how these will be improved in future data releases.In this section, we address several possible caveats, for which we either have not yet found or implemented a solution, or believe that these results could indeed be of an astrophysical nature.

            <rs type="software">SME</rs> is an actively developed software with regular improvements and bug fixes as part of version publications. For GALAH DR3, we used SME version 
            <rs type="version">536</rs>. This particular version has recently been found to have a code inconsistency which may cause non-trivial changes in synthetic fluxes and abundances (A. Gavel and A. J. Korn, private communication) with our used synthesis library 
            <rs type="software">linux</rs>.x86 64.64g. It is unlikely that this bug significantly influences our results thanks to a cancellation effect in our abundance zero-point calibration. We have performed several tests with the more recent SME version 580 on a large sample of roughly 20 000 stars, including reference stars such as the GBS, the stars with asteroseismic data, and open/globular cluster stars. For the majority of stars, we find that effects on abundances will be essentially null. This is because the bug appears to introduce a bias in abundances for all stars, which cancels in our calculation of solar-relative abundances. In practice, these effects are on the order of 0.05 dex for dwarfs and giants. Less than 10 per cent of the latter stars with very low surface gravity exhibit complex effects with biases as large as 0.15 dex. We have unfortunately not found a predictable systematic trend with stellar parameters, that would have allowed us to correct all abundance measurements. We want to stress though that our accuracy and precision estimates point towards SME 536 delivering reliable results after the zero-point correction. In the future, we will implement newer versions of

        <p>In this data release, for the first time we also include stacked spectra of repeat observations. We select the higher S/N observations for the main catalogue, but also report the individual spectra in the extended catalogue. We identify observations of the same star via matching coordinates. However, we have found few cases, where calibration observations were performed already with configurations of stellar observations, such as bias frames, sky, or dome flats. In few cases, the observations were not marked as calibration frames clearly, and have been used for the stacking of stellar spectra. We therefore caution the use of metal-poor stacked spectra, which can be identified in the 11th digit of the sobject id being 2 instead of 1, for example 160522002102FFF, where some of the science observations 0023-0025 have been stacked with dome flat observations 0016-0018, causing underestimated [Fe/H], which cannot be picked up by the pipeline, because the analysis is reasonable for the wrongly stacked spectra.

        <p>Below we present a list of possible systematic trends, as found up until the publication of GALAH+ DR3 during the validation. These do not appear in particular order. Co, Rb, Sr, Zr, Mo, Ru, La, Nd, and Sm In this data release, we try to push the boundary of what can be extracted from the observed spectra with the aim to deliver as many abundance measurements as possible. This does, however, not only push the limits of deciding what measurement is reliable, that is, significantly different from a continuum measurement, but leads to complicated cases where lines are blended, leading to possible wrong systematics. We therefore especially caution the use of elevated abundance measurements (especially above [X/Fe] of 0.3 dex, as indicated in Fig. 21) for V, Co, Rb, Sr, Zr, Mo, Ru, La, Nd, and Sm, as we suspect that these are most likely affected by blending issues close to the detection limit. Only visual inspection could however confirm this, which is not possible for the vast number of measurements at hand and we therefore advise the user to inspect the published spectra before using these measurements blindly.Below we present a list of possible systematic trends, as found up until the publication of GALAH+ DR3 during the validation.

        <p>For V, we caution the use of measurements with nr V fe 2 and 3, that is, using V I 4832. For Co, we caution the use of measurements with nr Co fe = 2 or 8, that is, measurements purely based on lines Co I 6490 and 7713. While we have not been able to narrow down the exact cause, we assume that measurements only based on these lines are caused by imperfect telluric corrections in CCD 3 for Co I 6490 and spikes or imperfect telluric corrections in CCD4 for Co I 7713. Such reduction issues introduce strong emission and absorption lines, which will either weaken the line beyond detectability or strengthen it so that only high V or Co abundances can reproduce the observation. However, the resultant fits and their χ 2 values will not appear suspicious and such reduction issues are therefore hard to identify and flag automatically.For V, we caution the use of measurements with nr V fe 2 and 3, that is, using V I 4832.

        <p>Our spectrum synthesis is performed by assuming 1D LTE and 1D non-LTE. However, modelling stellar atmospheres with a 1D description is neglecting 3D, time-dependent effects, which can only partially be mitigated by fudge factors, like v mic . While allowing this factor to be fitted as part of the analysis, our tests have shown that the abundance precision decreases. We have therefore implemented an empirical relation, estimated by Gao et al. (2018) for GALAH, over the whole parameter space, as outlined in Section 3.3, as shown in panel (a) of Fig. 19.Our spectrum synthesis is performed by assuming 1D LTE and 1D non-LTE.

        <p>During the validation of element abundances, we have discovered several temperature-dependent trends. These occur in regions where our analysis approach is prone to systematic trends anyway, that is, the coolest/most line-rich (&lt; 4500 K) and hottest/most line-poor (&gt; 6500 K) regions. We cannot exclude that the found systematic trends can also be partially caused by over-or underestimated v mic (in addition to a systematically incorrect normalization for the most line-rich spectra). Comparisons with other v mic relations, see e.g. the relations by Dutra-Ferreira et al. (2016) based on 3D atmosphere calculations (see panel b) suggest large deviations for certain stars, leading to a difference of up to 2 km s -1 (see panel c). The tests by Jofré et al. (2017) also showed that different stellar types are affected differently by inaccurate v mic , with strongest implications for (more metal-rich) giant stars among the analysed sample of GBS.During the validation of element abundances, we have discovered several temperature-dependent trends.

        <p>While our long-term goal is to implement 3D non-LTE calculations, we believe that it is worth testing the implementation of v mic as a free parameter or the relations estimated by Dutra-Ferreira et al. (2016) for certain parts of the parameter space, if the advantages outweigh the loss in abundance precision. Using v mic as a free parameter showed for example significant improvements of trends with T eff for the APOGEE survey (Holtzman et al. 2018).While our long-term goal is to implement 3D non-LTE calculations, we believe that it is worth testing the implementation of v mic as a free parameter or the relations estimated by Dutra-Ferreira et al.

        <p>For computational reasons, we estimate the abundances of all elements independently, and assume scaled-Solar patterns for most other elements during that optimization. However, our approach might introduce systematic trend for elements which are often correlated (e.g. C and O), surrounded by lines that are deviating from the scaled-Solar pattern, or when the abundance pattern in general differs from the scaled-Solar pattern, thus leading to differences in the continuum and molecular lines strengths. If computationally possible, it would therefore be preferable to fit all elements partially (Brewer et al. 2016) or fully self-consistent (Ting et al. 2019), which could also allow us to estimate abundances not only via atomic lines, but also molecular features, which follow molecular equilibria (Ting et al. 2018).For computational reasons, we estimate the abundances of all elements independently, and assume scaled-Solar patterns for most other elements during that optimization.

        <p>Stellar clusters are not the main focus of our survey, and many of the observations that were performed for them are outside of the typical GALAH magnitude, distance, and age range. Most of the open and globular clusters targeted by our observations are much more distant, which leads to less reliable distance estimates, with implications for our distance-dependent log g estimates of their stars. Many of stars in the open clusters stars are typically younger than the GALAH targets, with astrophysical implications on additional features in their spectra. Baratella et al. (2020) found that v mic is overestimated and thus [Fe/H] is underestimated when using Fe lines in clusters, a trend that we also observe in some of our cluster observations. We therefore cannot a priori exclude wrong v mic values as the influence of cluster abundance trends (see comments on v mic above).Stellar clusters are not the main focus of our survey, and many of the observations that were performed for them are outside of the typical GALAH magnitude, distance, and age range.

        <p>We note, however, that for open clusters, differences in [Fe/H]as well as other abundances have been found to be of astrophysical nature, e.g. atomic diffusion (e.g. Bertelli Motta et al. 2018;Gao et al. 2018;Souto et al. 2018Souto et al. , 2019;;Liu et al. 2019;Semenova et al. 2020) or stellar activity (e.g. Spina et al. 2020). Furthermore, astrophysical abundance trends, like anticorrelations of light elements (see Bastian &amp; Lardo 2018, and references therein), have also been found in globular clusters and are partially hard to disentangle from other abundance trends, e.g. those introduced by our analysis pipeline. We will follow this up for globular clusters with a dedicated study (D. M.

        <p>A central assumption of our observations is that each fibre observes only one star. We try to ensure this by only selecting point sources from 2MASS with a sufficient separation from other bright neighbours. Our selection does however not exclude stars that are not extended within 2MASS, for example spectroscopic binaries.A central assumption of our observations is that each fibre observes only one star.

        <p>Our means to identify (spectroscopic) binaries are, however, limited, because as part of GALAH we usually only take three spectra within typically 1 h per star, and can only resolve spectroscopic binaries if the lines of both components are resolved with the given broadening induced by our instrument and stellar rotation. Although we try to identify and flag stars as part of our validation (see Section 4.3), we expect that we are not able to identify a significant fraction of stars as binaries. Price-Whelan et al. ( 2020 The implications of not identifying a star as a binary can be manifold. First the binarity changes the astrometric solution, which is not always identified via Gaia warnings or quality values like the RUWE value. This can falsify the estimated distance of objects. Secondly, the photometry of a binary system can deviate significantly from that of the primary component, depending on the flux contribution of the secondary. Thirdly, the flux contribution within the spectrum lead to inaccurate fits when assuming a single star as quantified by El-Badry et al. (2018a, b), which leads to inaccurate stellar parameters as well as element abundances. For binaries, the measured v rad also only reflects (at best) the value at the time of observation and is thus not indicative of its Galactic orbit. We note that we have not made use of the assessment of v rad changes among our 51 539 spectra with dedicated repeat observations (typically on different nights).Our means to identify (spectroscopic) binaries are, however, limited, because as part of GALAH we usually only take three spectra within typically 1 h per star, and can only resolve spectroscopic binaries if the lines of both components are resolved with the given broadening induced by our instrument and stellar rotation.

        <p>For computational reasons we have limited the isochrones used for the on-the-fly mass estimation to a grid of 0.5..(0.5)..13.5 Gyr. We note that for the youngest stars this might not be a good choice, as we see some noding in the on-the-fly mass and age estimates, especially for hot stars and secondary RC stars. In the future we would like to make use of a better set of isochrones in terms of sampling (more ages on a logarithmic scale), which will hopefully also include different alpha-enhancements and will take into account atomic diffusion as well as stellar rotation. For a better quantification of the uncertainties, for example when using (Markov Chain) Monte Carlo sampling, it would also be useful to be able to sample ages above the age of the Universe.For computational reasons we have limited the isochrones used for the on-the-fly mass estimation to a grid of 0.5..(0.5)..13.5 Gyr.

        <p>86 per cent of the stars of this data release have estimated E(B -V ) &lt; 0.2 mag from Schlegel et al. (1998) and 95 per cent below 0.2 mag. Similarly, 90 per cent and 98 per cent of the stars have estimated A K S &lt; 0.1 mag and 0.2 mag, respectively. If a star has a high and uncertain extinction, this can influence the bolometric luminosity that we estimate and thus introduce biases in the surface gravity and thus all subsequent analyses.

        <p>An ongoing disagreement concerns the stellar parameters of metalrich giants, and especially metal-rich red clump stars.

        <p>For DR3, the use of astrometry and photometry allows us to get more accurate log g. For the metal-rich ([Fe/H] &gt; 0) giants and RC stars, however, we notice that the estimated iron abundances show a significant trend of underestimated [Fe/H] with increasing metallicity, when comparing with GALAH DR2. This is an indicator that our synthetic spectra are inaccurate for this specific type of stars or spectra. As discussed above, Jofré et al. (2017) showed that for giant stars, an over-/underestimated v mic can change the measured abundances of some lines significantly, by up to 1.5 dex. The reasons for underestimated [Fe/H] are however more diverse and also include missing/unreliable molecular line data, the underestimation of blending and incorrect continuum normalization. We believe that we can exclude incorrect estimates of log g estimates, e.g. as a result of poor mass-estimates from missing isochrone models in the supersolar [Fe/H] regime, because photometric and spectroscopic positions in the CMD and Kiel diagrams agree well.For DR3, the use of astrometry and photometry allows us to get more accurate log g.

        <p>When using the K2 sample with asteroseismic classifications of evolutionary stages within this DR (Stello, private communication), we find a significant difference of around 0.3 dex between RC and RGB stars. The reasons for this might be manifold and could for example suggest non-scaled-Solar abundance patterns for C and N among the RC stars, as shown by Tautvaišienė et al. (2013). The follow-up of these spectroscopic shortcomings are beyond the scope of this paper, but should also assess line saturation and discuss the implications of different formation depths of atomic lines (see e.g. Gurtovenko &amp; Sheminova 2015), which could possibly explain the different effect for different lines within the GALAH range as well.When using the K2 sample with asteroseismic classifications of evolutionary stages within this DR (Stello, private communication), we find a significant difference of around 0.3 dex between RC and RGB stars.

        <p>We stress that our stellar parameters for the youngest stars (below 0.5 Gyr) are likely unreliable. This is caused by our analysis setup with an isochrone grid selection favouring older stars, tying v mic to an empirical relation and estimating stellar parameters mainly from iron lines (Baratella et al. 2020), but also neglecting stellar rotation, possible stellar activity, and magnetic fields (Spina et al. 2020b) which can alter the shape of stellar lines quite drastically.We stress that our stellar parameters for the youngest stars (below 0.5 Gyr) are likely unreliable.

We especially warn the user of these overdensities at 3500 K as well as 4750..(250)..8000 K. We further have found an underdensity around stars with temperatures below 4750 K, which coincide with regions of a different atmosphere grid spacing. Comparisons with the IRFM temperatures show however that the temperatures of these stars are not drastically different and we have therefore decided to not flag them. We have further identified an overdensity at 4650 K and log g of 4.7 dex, which we can ascribe to an issue in the isochrone interpolation due to sparsely available isochrone points.Below we list several unexpected over-and underdensities, which are likely introduced by our analysis, that is, not the RC area or the red giant bump.

Subsequently, we outline the important information used to calculate the additional values for each VAC and note the changes from v1 to v2.This data release of GALAH is accompanied by four value-addedcatalogues, one for a cross-match with Gaia EDR3, one for stellar ages and masses, one with kinematic as well as dynamic information for each star/spectrum, one for more elaborate radial velocity estimates, and a fourth one with additional estimates for doublelined spectroscopic binaries.

        <p>As of 2020 December, we provide the cross-match of our allspeccatalogue with Gaia EDR3 (Gaia Collaboration 2020; Fabricius et al. 2021), with improved astrometric (Lindegren et al. 2021b) and photometric (Riello et al. 2021) information. We performed this match via the dr2 source id, specifically with the smallest angular distance24 within the internal cross-match catalogue of Gaia DR2 and Gaia EDR3 (Torra et al. 2021). For each star, we further list the parallax zero-point as queried from Lindegren et al. (2021a) to correct the parallaxes of the sources with 5 or 6-parameter astrometric solutions from Gaia EDR3 (Lindegren et al. 2021b). We further provide the photogeometric and geometric distance estimated by Bailer-Jones et al. ( 2021) which were matched via the dr3 source id.As of 2020 December, we provide the cross-match of our allspeccatalogue with Gaia EDR3 (Gaia Collaboration 2020; Fabricius et al. 2021), with improved astrometric (Lindegren et al. 2021b) and photometric (Riello et al. 2021) information.

        <p>To estimate stellar properties like age, mass, and distance we use the Bayesian Stellar Parameter Estimation code 
            <rs type="software">BSTEP</rs> (Sharma et al. 2018). 
            <rs type="software">BSTEP</rs> provides a Bayesian estimate of intrinsic stellar parameters from observed parameters by making use of stellar isochrones. For details of the adopted priors see Sharma et al. (2018), in short, a flat prior on age and metallicity was used and for density distribution of stars a combination of an exponential stellar disc and a diffuse stellar halo was used. For results presented in this paper, we use the PARSEC release v1.2S + COLIBRI stellar isochrones (Marigo et al. 2017). We use the following observables, T eff , log g, [Fe/H], [α/Fe], 2MASS J and Ks photometry, and parallax from Gaia. The effective observed metallicity was estimated using the formula

        <p>by Salaris &amp; Cassisi (2006), with Z = 0.0152 in accordance with the isochrones used. This was compared with the surface metallicity reported by the isochrones, which takes the evolutionary changes in surface metallicity Z into account. The code provides an estimate of age, actual mass, initial mass, initial metallicity, surface metallicity, radius, distance, extinction E(B -V), luminosity, surface gravity, temperature, and the probability of being a red clump star. For each estimated parameter we report a mean value and standard deviation together with the 16th, 50th, and 84th percentiles. The isochrone grid consisted of 16 768 422 grid points. An 81 × 121 grid spanning -2 &lt; log Z/Z &lt; 0.5 and 6.6 &lt; log age/Gyr &lt; 10.12 was used. The mass dimension of the grid was resampled by interpolation, such that log T eff &lt; 0.004 and log g &lt; 0.01. For each parameter, we report a mean value and standard deviation based on 16 and 84 percentiles.

        <p>For the calculation of orbit information we use version 
            <rs type="version">1.6</rs> of the python package 
            <rs type="software">GALPY</rs> (Bovy 2015). More specifically, we use its ORBIT module for coordinate/velocity transformation as well as orbit energy computation. To estimate actions, eccentricity, maximum orbit Galactocentric height, and apocentre/pericentre radii, we use 
            <rs type="software">GALPY</rs>'s ACTIONANGLESTAECKEL approximations via the Staeckel fudge (Binney 2012) with a focus of 0.45 and the method by Mackereth &amp; Bovy (2018).

        <p>For our calculations we use the best-fitting axisymmetric potential by McMillan (2017) with a Solar radius of 8.21 kpc, consistent with the latest measurement by Gravity Collaboration (2019) of 8.178 ± 0.013 stat. ± 0.022 sys. kpc, and circular velocity at this radius of 233.1 km s -1 . We use the total motion of the Sun in the V-direction of 248.27 km s -1 by evaluation of the proper motion measurements from Reid &amp; Brunthaler (2004) at our chosen Solar radius. We further place the Sun 25 pc above the plane (Jurić et al. 2008) and use the peculiar Solar velocities U = 11.1 +0.69 -0.75 km s -1 and W = 7.25 +0.37 -0.36 km s -1 by Schönrich, Binney &amp; Dehnen (2010), but V = 15.17 km s -1 . This value is higher than the 12.24 +0.47 -0.47 km s -1 from Schönrich et al. (2010), but given the ongoing debate (see e.g. the discussion in Sharma et al. 2014) of this value, we choose our value for internal consistency between the chosen total and peculiar motions of the Sun in our reference frame with a given circular velocity.For our calculations we use the best-fitting axisymmetric potential by McMillan (2017) with a Solar radius of 8.21 kpc, consistent with the latest measurement by Gravity Collaboration (2019) of 8.178 ± 0.013 stat. ± 0.022 sys. kpc, and circular velocity at this radius of 233.1 km s -1 .

We further realize 10 000 Monte Carlo samplings per star/spectrum by sampling Gaia astrometry within the uncertainties. 25 For the distance sampling in version 2, we sample with 2 Gaussians (half the sample with a standard deviation based on the 16th percentile below the median and the other half with 84th percentile above the median) linearly in the distance modulus. For version 1, we assumed Gaussian uncertainties when using the BSTEP distances or sample from a 2-sided Gaussian in distance based on the bold assumption that the distributions left and right of the mode stated by Bailer-Jones et al. (2018) are Gaussian and we can thus describe them via the stated lower and higher percentiles. 26 We then provide the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile for the user for each orbit parameter.

        <p>For the computed phase space and dynamic properties, we report a variety of statistical values. In addition to the best value, that is computed by using the best values as input, we also sample the distribution for each property within the uncertainties via Monte Carlo sampling with size 1000 and report the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles of these distributions. An example of the sampling of parameters for 100 randomly selected stars is shown in Fig. 23. We also provide the code to perform this sampling with different sampling choices. Whereas we currently sample the properties by assuming their input parameters are uncorrelated, we also provide the code to sample with the Gaia correlation matrices. The latter are currently not applying a distance prior and are thus problematic for large distances. However, we stress, that the vast majority of the stars from GALAH+ DR3 have very precise parallax measurements, for which the sampling choice is negligible (see Fig. 3).For the computed phase space and dynamic properties, we report a variety of statistical values.

In version 2 of this VAC, we list all values of measurements from SME (now with suffix sme, rather than suffix galah as in version 1), measurements from Zwitter et al. (2020) with suffix obst based on an improved algorithm based on the work by Zwitter et al. (2018). The latter estimates were performed with a grid of 718 template spectra (created from observed HERMES spectra in selected T eff , log g, [Fe/H], and [α/Fe]bins).

        <p>The GALAH collaboration releases millions of abundance measurements for 678 423 spectra of 588 571 stars. In this section, we put this achievement into perspective. This release provides, to the best of our knowledge, the largest number of element abundances from high-resolution (R ∼ 28 000) spectra published so far for a well- selected sample of stars with the promise of most precise dynamic and age information. This number is, however, still rather small compared to the roughly 1.5 billion stars observed by Gaia (Gaia Collaboration 2016b), which aims to observe about 1 per cent of all Milky Way stars, and also limited mainly to stars in the Solar vicinity within 4 kpc. However thanks to our information on stellar orbits, we can learn or infer results beyond the volume of the present day stellar positions in the Galaxy (May &amp; Binney 1986).The GALAH collaboration releases millions of abundance measurements for 678 423 spectra of 588 571 stars.

This number is, however, still rather small compared to the roughly 1.5 billion stars observed by Gaia (Gaia Collaboration 2016b), which aims to observe about 1 per cent of all Milky Way stars, and also limited mainly to stars in the Solar vicinity within 4 kpc. However thanks to our information on stellar orbits, we can learn or infer results beyond the volume of the present day stellar positions in the Galaxy (May &amp; Binney 1986).</p>
        <p>To be able to perform Galactic archaeology on a truly galactic scale, it is therefore vital to be able to use the measurements of other large-scale stellar surveys. In Section 8.1 we compare some key properties, like spatial coverage as well as observed stellar types and the major abundance tracers [Fe/H] and [α/Fe]from GALAH+ DR3 with those from two other ongoing surveys, namely APOGEE (DR16 Ahumada et al. 2020;Jönsson et al. 2020) and LAMOST (DR5 Deng et al. 2012;Zhao et al. 2012;Xiang et al. 2020). Both of these surveys provide millions of measurements for multiple elements, but we note that there are several other surveys which also provide abundance measurements (but for typically fewer elements and/or stars), like the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey (Nordström et al. 2004;Casagrande et al. 2011), SEGUE (Yanny et al. 2009), RAVE (Steinmetz et al. 2020a,b), and Gaia-ESO (Gilmore et al. 2012). In Section 8.2, we highlight the potential to further our understanding of Galactic and stellar chemical evolution with Li, one of the 30 elements measured by GALAH. In Section 8.3, we then showcase some of the specific advantages of GALAH for the exploration of the chemodynamic evolution of the Milky Way.To be able to perform Galactic archaeology on a truly galactic scale, it is therefore vital to be able to use the measurements of other large-scale stellar surveys.

        <p>To understand how we can use the available surveys on a global scale, two key points need to be considered. First, if the surveys are complementary and secondly if the surveys are on the same scale.To understand how we can use the available surveys on a global scale, two key points need to be considered.

        <p>In this section, we are rather aiming to give explanations why different surveys may not depict the same trends on first glance (based on different selection functions), while highlighting the potential of combining the different surveys.In this section, we are rather aiming to give explanations why different surveys may not depict the same trends on first glance (based on different selection functions), while highlighting the potential of combining the different surveys.</p>

        <p>These numbers show that the surveys are very complementary in the stars that they target, but also have a non-negligible overlap between them. Even more important, this overlap allows us to test if these surveys are on the same scale and even to cross-calibrate them to bring them on the same scale (see Casey et al. 2017;Ho et al. 2017;Nandakumar et al. 2020;Wheeler et al. 2020;Xiang et al. 2020).These numbers show that the surveys are very complementary in the stars that they target, but also have a non-negligible overlap between them.

        <p>Because the three surveys operate on different sites, they are typically observing different regions of the sky. This can be seen in Figs 24(a)-(f), where we show the spatial distribution of stars in heliocentric Cartesian coordinates (X versus Y in Figs 24a-c) and Galactocentric cylindrical coordinates (R versus z in Figs 24d-f). While GALAH observes stars of the Southern hemisphere, LAMOST targets mainly the Northern hemisphere (compare Figs 24a andc), and APOGEE observes both hemispheres. When looking at the Galactic spatial distribution, we see the selection function of GALAH, especially |b| &gt; 10 deg introducing a lack of stars in the plane (panel d), whereas APOGEE is mainly targeting the plane (small z in panel e) and LAMOST (panel f) targets all regions except the inner Galaxy.Because the three surveys operate on different sites, they are typically observing different regions of the sky.

        <p>The elemental abundances obtained by these surveys are data of particular interest for Galactic archaeology. A detailed comparison of those between the surveys is beyond the scope of this paper. Typically, different surveys operate at different resolutions and reach different S/N in different wavelength regions, thus selecting different lines for their analyses. Different lines again, can form at different optical depths and may be blended differently; all possible factors for possibly different abundance measurements (Jofré et al. 2019).The elemental abundances obtained by these surveys are data of particular interest for Galactic archaeology.

        <p>For α-element abundances another important consideration is how these are defined and computed. For GALAH+ DR3, we provide individual element abundances for Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti, but also compute a combined [α/Fe] value from error-weighted combinations of well selected individual lines from these elements (see Section 3.3), resulting in the distribution shown in Fig. 24(j). Because of the differences in yields between these different αelements, the enhancement pattern of different α-process elements looks slightly different to each other, and a combined α-enhancement label is only a compromise to reach a higher precision. For DR3, this compromise is dominated by Si and Ti, followed by Mg as the most precisely measured elements, with rather little contribution from Ca. For APOGEE DR16, on the other hand, [α/M], which we convert to [α/Fe]in Fig. 24(k) is computed using all lines in the APOGEE wavelength range and adjusting all of the [X/Fe] at the same time by the same amount. For LAMOST DR5, we show the VAC estimates trained on GALAH DR2 by Xiang et al. (2020). When comparing these distributions, it is important to keep in mind the quality of data that was used for the analysis. The median S/N for GALAH and LAMOST is 35, which is 4.5 times lower than the median S/N of 159 achieved by APOGEE. We therefore expect that the scatter for GALAH and LAMOST is larger, as can be seen in Figs 24(j)-(l). Furthermore it is important to keep in mind that these distributions trace different regions of the sky, different distributions of stellar types, and thus likely also different distributions of stellar populations. Especially for APOGEE, we expect a larger ratio of stars from the bulge and high-α disc, which will change the colourmap distribution.For α-element abundances another important consideration is how these are defined and computed.

        <p>When comparing with APOGEE DR16 abundances quantitatively (see Table A2), we find an excellent agreement for most abundance zero points, that is sky flats and vesta, including 0.00 ± 0.01 dex for [Fe/H] and -0.01 ± 0.05 dex for [α/Fe]. The difference for all stars with unflagged abundances between APOGEE DR16 and GALAH shows a slightly lower [Fe/H] for GALAH (-0.05 ± 0.14 dex) and slightly higher [α/Fe](0.02 ± 0.07 dex). For a comparison of the other elements we refer to Table A2.When comparing with APOGEE DR16 abundances quantitatively (see Table A2), we find an excellent agreement for most abundance zero points, that is sky flats and vesta, including 0.00 ± 0.01 dex for [Fe/H] and -0.01 ± 0.05 dex for [α/Fe].

        <p>In this section, we briefly aim to show the potential of GALAH+ DR3 for the exploration of Galactic and stellar chemical evolution, while leaving the true exploration to the scientific community. One would ideally like to take all abundance measurements into account for such an endeavour, including GALAH's main goal of the chemical tagging experiment, but here we aim to show how much potential the exploration of a single element has to offer. (Asplund et al. 2009). First of all, it is important to notice that we only plot the stars with unflagged Li measurements (flag sp = 0 and flag li fe = 0). These are 127 674 measurements or 18.8 per cent of all GALAH+ DR3 stars.In this section, we briefly aim to show the potential of GALAH+ DR3 for the exploration of Galactic and stellar chemical evolution, while leaving the true exploration to the scientific community.

        <p>In this projection, several substructures are noticeable. While the mean abundance of all stars is A(Li) = 2.2 +0.3 -0.7 dex, we actually see a large spread of A(Li) between -0.5 and 4.0 dex across for [Fe/H] &gt; -1 dex. Among many others, Ramírez et al. (2012) and Bensby &amp; Lind (2018) explored this pattern in their studies extensively by analysing its correlation with stellar parameters, stellar populations as well as age and temperature and found a strong correlation for example between temperature and A(Li). When we only plot the stars with the largest A(Li), especially above the theoretical primordial value of 2.75, we find that only specific groups of stars exhibit these abundances, see Fig. 25b, namely hot dwarf stars and few lithium-rich giants. Because of the dredge-up, we would not expect such high amounts of Li in giants, which questions our understanding of stellar physics and evolution. With the new more reliable data from GALAH+ DR3, more scenarios of Li production during binary interaction or the He-flash in giant stars (see e.g. Casey et al. 2019;Kumar et al. 2020) can be tested more reliably, indicating that lithium-rich giant stars require multiple formation channels (Martell et al. 2020).In this projection, several substructures are noticeable.

        <p>Thanks to the hundreds of thousands of Li measurements, we are also able to study phenomena which previously have mainly been analysed in cluster stars, such as the occurrence of the Li dip (Boesgaard &amp; Tripicco 1986), a region among the warm dwarf stars, for which deep mixing induced by rotation and meridional circulation causes strong Li depletion. The first analysis of this region with GALAH+ DR3 by Gao et al. (2020) has identified a significant offset between the warm and cool side of this Li dip of 0.4 -0.5 dex. Down to metallicities of [Fe/H] ∼ -1 dex this offset appears metallicity-independent which sheds new light on the famous disagreement between predicted Li abundance and the one measured in cool, old, metal-poor on the Spite plateau of A(Li) ∼ 2.3 dex (Spite &amp; Spite 1982). In particular, Gao et al. (2020) speculate that the most metal-poor stars on the warm side of the dip may have experienced insignificant Li depletion as well as insignificant Galactic Li enrichment, naturally explaining why their abundances closely reflect those predicted by standard big bang nucleosynthesis.Thanks to the hundreds of thousands of Li measurements, we are also able to study phenomena which previously have mainly been analysed in cluster stars, such as the occurrence of the Li dip (Boesgaard &amp; Tripicco 1986), a region among the warm dwarf stars, for which deep mixing induced by rotation and meridional circulation causes strong Li depletion.

        <p>Several of these metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] &lt; -1 dex) have actually been identified as stars of the accreted Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage. With GALAH data, both Molaro, Cescutti &amp; Fu (2020) and Simpson et al. (2020) show that the distribution of A(Li) from the accreted stars, like the GES agrees with different populations of the Milky Way, an important confirmation that the Cosmological Lithium problem is not a consequence of formation environment (see also Nissen &amp; Schuster 2012;Cescutti, Molaro &amp; Fu 2020).Several of these metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] &lt; -1 dex) have actually been identified as stars of the accreted Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage.

        <p>Similar to Hayden et al. (2015), we plot the distribution of αenhancement versus iron abundance for stars of GALAH+ DR3 in different spatial bins, that is different bins in Galactic radius (from inner Galaxy on the left to outer Galaxy on the right) as well as Galactic height (from the Galactic plane in the bottom to more than 1 kpc above or below the plane in the top) in Fig. 26. The Solar vicinity, which is located in the bottom centre of this figure hosts by far the most stars of GALAH+ DR3 and consists mainly of low-α (thin) disc stars. When looking at larger Galactic heights, stars of the high-α (thick) disc become dominant, in good agreement with the results by Hayden et al. (2015) based on APOGEE data. However, we find a less pronounced abundance gradient of the low-α disc with Galactic radius, which we believe is attributed to less reliable iron abundances of distant, metal-rich giants (mainly expected in the inner Galaxy), as outlined in Section 6.5. In agreement with Hayden et al. (2015), we see a clear separation of the overdensities of low-and high-α disc stars and a spatial invariance of the position of the peak/distribution of the high-α disc stars. With the improved distances thanks to the Gaia mission, we are able to also explore With the provided VAC on stellar ages, we are also able to assess the data set by this important property. Many recent studies (e.g. Haywood et al. 2013Haywood et al. , 2019;;Bensby et al. 2014;Hayden et al. 2017;Minchev et al. 2017) have shown the potential of including ages when assessing the Milky Way populations. Buder et al. (2019) have further shown that age and chemistry combined (as more conserved properties than kinematics/dynamics) can help us to dissect the disc populations. Among the 415653 stars in GALAH+DR3 with unflagged stellar parameters, [Fe/H], and [α/Fe] as well as ages, we find 1.8 per cent with [Fe/H] ≤ -1. When assigning the other stars to young (≤8 Gyr) and old (&gt;8 Gyr) as well as low-α ([α/Fe] ≤ 0.2) and high-α ([α/Fe] &gt; 0.2) groups, we find 62.5 per cent young lowα stars, 8.8 per cent young high-α stars (compare to 5.8 per cent found within APOKASC by Martig et al. 2015), and 26.9 per cent old stars (21.5 per cent low-α and 5.4 per cent high-α).Similar to Hayden et al.

        <p>The vast majority of GALAH targets, especially the 62.5 per cent young low-α stars, are expected to move on orbits very similar to the Sun. In Fig. 22 this is confirmed in all panels of kinematic and dynamic properties, where most stars are located close to the Sun (V = 248.27 km s -1 , J φ = L Z = 2038.3 kpc km s -1 ) and exhibit only small radial and vertical velocities / actions.The vast majority of GALAH targets, especially the 62.5 per cent young low-α stars, are expected to move on orbits very similar to the Sun.

        <p>Although halo stars are not the main target of GALAH, roughly 1 per cent of all GALAH targets are expected to belong to the chemical or kinematic halo (De Silva et al. 2015). While the definition of halo stars is contentious, we at least aim to assess their rough number by looking at different kinematic and dynamic properties. For this, we look at the distribution of azimuthal / transversal velocity V T with respect to the combined radial and vertical velocity V 2 R + V 2 z in Fig. 22.Although halo stars are not the main target of GALAH, roughly 1 per cent of all GALAH targets are expected to belong to the chemical or kinematic halo (De Silva et al. 2015).

        <p>The majority of stars move on almost circular orbits at Solar radius (V T ∼ v circ = 233.1 km s -1 ). Half of all GALAH stars differ by less than 57 km s -1 from this total velocity.

In the literature, the latter two values have been used to assign stars to the kinematic halo, and while such distinct cuts are debatable, their numbers are significantly higher than the initially estimated 1 per cent (De Silva et al. 2015), partially due to the additional surveys like K2-HERMES contributing to GALAH+Dr3. These stars do not move coherently with the (local) disc, but are on kinematically hotter orbits. This suggests that they are for example halo stars or belong to the bulge. 1.2 per cent of the stars even move on retrograde orbits.The majority of stars move on almost circular orbits at Solar radius (V T ∼ v circ = 233.1 km s -1 ).

        <p>Similar to Belokurov et al. (2018) we can identify an overdensity of the Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES) (see e.g. Helmi 2020, and references therein) in Fig. 22(b) along an extended range of -400 &lt; V R &lt; 400 km s -1 along small Galactocentric azimuthal velocities, that is, following closely the dashed red line indicating V T ∼ 0 km s -1 . While the stars stick out in this projection, the shown properties are not conserved and it is therefore advisable to also inspect the conserved properties of actions.Similar to Belokurov et al.

        <p>The distribution of stars in action space is shown in a view of vertical angular momentum (normalized to the Solar value) and radial action in Fig. 22(c). Most of the stars in this diagram show a similar vertical angular momentum radial action as the Sun (L Z = 2038.3 kpc km s -1 , J R = 7.7 kpc km s -1 ). Similar to the analyses by Trick et al. (2019), a much richer substructure can be seen when compared to Fig. 22(b). The overdensity of stars around L Z ∼ 0 kpc km s -1 with higher radial actions is typical for stars of the Galactic halo, especially those of the GES (see e.g. Helmi 2020, and references therein). When looking at the distribution of stellar actions relative to their total actions in Fig. 22(d), it again becomes evident that most stars are on near-circular orbits (L Z ∼ L tot ). However, this projection also allows the identification of accreted stars and stars of streams (see e.g. Myeong et al. 2019;Vasiliev 2019; Monty et al. It should be noted, that the globular cluster ω Cen, targeted by GALAH and thus part of this data release, sticks out in all panels of Fig. 22 either as overdensity at low V T ∼ -85 km s -1 in Figs 22(a) and (b) or as streak at -0.25L Z, in Fig. 22(c) and -0.6J φ /J tot in Fig. 22(d). Although beyond the scope of this paper, our release provides new and diverse data to follow up the connection of this globular cluster and possible remnant of a tidally disrupted dwarf galaxy (e.g. Bekki &amp; Freeman 2003) in combination with other stars with similar chemodynamic properties (Myeong et al. 2018) and assess if the streaks are only mainly caused by the high parallax uncertainty of 46 per cent for stars in ω Cen or might coincide with a true extension.The distribution of stars in action space is shown in a view of vertical angular momentum (normalized to the Solar value) and radial action in Fig. 22(c).

        <p>When combining dynamic information (such as actions and eccentricities) with chemistry (like [Fe/H]and α-enhancement) in chemodynamic projections, we can see the potential of GALAH+ DR3 in action. Until the recent years, analyses of the Milky Way had usually been performed either from a spectroscopic/chemical or dynamical point of view. Thanks to the advent of Gaia and stellar spectroscopic surveys, we can now bring together both disciplines.When combining dynamic information (such as actions and eccentricities) with chemistry (like [Fe/H]and α-enhancement) in chemodynamic projections, we can see the potential of GALAH+ DR3 in action.

        <p>In Fig. 27(a), we plot the distributions in action bins coloured by their mean [Fe/H]. Similar to Fig. 22(c), we see a right substructure, which strongly suggests a correlation of resonances with certain iron abundances. Furthermore, we see a gradient of iron abundance with lower angular momenta dropping from [Fe/H] = -0.13 +0.20 -0.22 dex at 1.00 +0.05 -0.05 L Z, to [Fe/H] = -0.99 +0.39 -0.47 dex at 0.00 +0.05 -0.05 L Z, . In Fig. 27(b) we plot a chemical overview, coloured by the dynamic property of eccentricity, as performed previously (e.g. Schuster et al. 2012;Mackereth et al. 2019). Here we see that the low-α disc stars are typically on rather circular orbits (with eccentrics well below 0.5), whereas high-α disc stars exhibit higher eccentricities around mean values of 0.5. The most striking feature in this projection is the stars with low [Fe/H], which almost exclusively show eccentricities above 0.5 (stars with [Fe/H]below -1.0 dex move on orbits with typical eccentricities of e = 0.70 +0.23 -0.39 ). This is strong evidence that these stars, with chemical composition that are very distinct from the stellar disc and bulge, and orbits very different from the disc are accreted (see discussions in Belokurov et al. 2018;Helmi et al. 2018;Mackereth et al. 2019;Helmi 2020). That these stars are not only different in their dynamics, can be seen in a chemical projection in Fig. 27(c), where we follow up the distinct chemical signatures of accreted halo stars as found by Nissen &amp; Schuster (2010, 2011) in the projections similar to those proposed by Hawkins et al. (2015) and Das et al. (2020). When assessing different nucleosynthesis channels via different elements, that is Al or Na, α like Mg, and Cu or Mn, the accreted halo stars clearly stick out as a distinct overdensity because of their different chemical enrichment history compared to the majority of the Milky Way disc stars. A follow-up of these findings will be presented in the chemodynamical study of accreted halo stars by S. Buder et al. (in preparation).In Fig. 27(a), we plot the distributions in action bins coloured by their mean [Fe/H].

        <p>Since the advent of galactic archaeology (Freeman &amp; Bland-Hawthorn 2002, and references therein), many large stellar surveys attempt to establish a narrative for the Galaxy by comparing vast amounts of stellar data (ages, kinematics, chemistry) to cosmological N-body + hydrodynamic simulations (e.g. Kobayashi &amp; Nakasato 2011;El-Badry et al. 2018a;Buck et al. 2019).

        <p>Astronomers have long suspected there is much to learn from examining dynamical perturbations and their dependence on the stellar properties (Minchev et al. 2009;Widrow et al. 2012). We refer this field as Galactic seismology and identify it as a subset of Galactic archaeology. Bland-Hawthorn &amp; Tepper-Garcia (2021, their Appendix A) provide a brief history of Galactic seismology dating back to its first use in 1985. Indeed, in the Gaia second data release (DR2) just two years ago (Antoja et al. 2018), a remarkable signature of incomplete phase-mixing was uncovered. If we consider a Galactic cylindrical coordinate frame defined by (R, φ, z), with velocity components (V R , V φ , V z ), the Gaia team discovered a 'phase spiral' in the z -V z plane. The vertical (z) oscillation frequency is anharmonic so this signal arises from a corrugated wave propagating across the Galactic disc. GALAH has been used to study this phenomenon in terms of stellar ages, actions, and abundances (Bland-Hawthorn et al. 2019;Laporte et al. 2019), with further analyses already under way.Astronomers have long suspected there is much to learn from examining dynamical perturbations and their dependence on the stellar properties (Minchev et al. 2009;Widrow et al. 2012).

        <p>We have learned several lessons in the analysis for this data release, which will help us to improve our analysis in the future, that is for the fourth data release of GALAH and thereafer. We have found several interesting trends, of which some are likely astrophysical, while others are not. We will follow these up in the future to hopefully minimize the unphysical trends. Several of these are likely to be addresses by improvements in the reduction of spectra with improved telluric corrections and improved stacking routines. While an indepth comparison of the data-driven versus model-driven approaches is still to be conducted, first results from our work indicates that a quadratic model reaches its limitations when used to describe a very high-dimensional space, covering the stellar parameters along A-M type stars, as well as 30 element abundances. With the introduction of more higher order models or flexible models and methods, for example neural networks or Gaussian process regression in stellar spectroscopy (Ting et al. 2019;Wang et al. 2021), we believe that such limitations can be overcome and will allow us to further overcome the significant computational costs of on-the-fly spectrum synthesis. A major limitation of all spectroscopic analyses remains with the immensely uncertain oscillator strengths used to create synthetic spectra, with significantly more effort needed. In the future, we aim to not only use improved synthetic model grids, based on 3D non-LTE computations, but also implement these more sophisticated interpolation routines combined with an Bayesian framework. The latter would allow us to include non-spectroscopic information like information from Gaia eDR3 and DR3 in a probabilistic way and help us to assess the uncertainties of our estimates more reliably.We have learned several lessons in the analysis for this data release, which will help us to improve our analysis in the future, that is for the fourth data release of GALAH and thereafer.

        <p>One of the most limiting bottlenecks of Galactic archaeology are the still significant uncertainties of stellar ages which can be estimated to no better than 10 per cent (Soderblom 2010), but are typically significantly higher. With the start of GALAH Phase 2, for which we adjust our target selection to observe more main-sequence turn-off stars to get more reliable age estimates, we also adjusted our observing strategy with longer exposure time to achieve higher spectral quality (and thus higher accuracy and precision). These adjustments will help us to more efficiently collect high-dimensional data of stars in our Solar vicinity and provide the community with a promising data set of chemistry, dynamics, and reliable ages.One of the most limiting bottlenecks of Galactic archaeology are the still significant uncertainties of stellar ages which can be estimated to no better than 10 per cent (Soderblom 2010), but are typically significantly higher.
