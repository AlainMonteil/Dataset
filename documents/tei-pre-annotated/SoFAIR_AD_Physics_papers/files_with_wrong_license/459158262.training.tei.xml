        <p>As the number of merging binary black holes observed with ground-based gravitational-wave detectors grows, increasingly accurate theoretical models are required to compare them to the observed sample and disentangle contributions from multiple channels. In formation models involving isolated binary stars, important uncertainties remain regarding the stability of mass transfer and commonenvelope evolution. To study some of these uncertainties, we have computed binary simulations using the MESA code consisting of a 30 M star in a low metallicity (Z /10) environment with a black-hole companion. We have developed an updated prescription to compute mass transfer rates including the possibility of outflows from outer Lagrangian points, as well as a method to self-consistently determine the core-envelope boundary in cases where there is common-envelope evolution. We find that binaries survive commonenvelope evolution only if unstable mass transfer happens after the formation of a deep convective envelope, resulting in a narrow range (0.2 dex) in period for successful envelope ejection. All cases where binary interaction is initiated with a radiative envelope have large binding energies (∼10 50 erg), and they result in mergers during the common-envelope phase even under the assumption that all the internal and recombination energy of the envelope, as well as the energy from an inspiral, is used to eject the envelope. This is independent of whether or not helium is ignited in the core of the donor, conditions under which various rapid-population synthesis calculations assume a successful envelope ejection is possible. Moreover, we find that the critical mass ratio for instability is such that across a large range in initial orbital periods (∼1-1000 days), merging binary black holes can be formed via stable mass transfer. A large fraction of these systems undergo overflow of their L 2 equipotential, in which case we find that stable mass transfer produces merging binary black holes even under extreme assumptions of mass and angular momentum outflows. Our conclusions are limited to the study of one donor mass at a single metallicity, but they suggest that population synthesis calculations overestimate the formation rate of merging binary black holes produced by common-envelope evolution and that stable mass transfer could dominate the formation rate from isolated binaries. This is in agreement with a few other recent studies. Further work is required to extend these results to different masses and metallicities as well as to understand how they can be incorporated into rapid population synthesis calculations.As the number of merging binary black holes observed with ground-based gravitational-wave detectors grows, increasingly accurate theoretical models are required to compare them to the observed sample and disentangle contributions from multiple channels.

        <p>In the last five years, the discoveries from ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors have driven a large effort to understand the origin of compact binary black holes (BHs). With 50 detections with a high significance (Abbott et al. 2019(Abbott et al. , 2020a)), the majority of the observed GW sources correspond to binary BH mergers covering a large range of masses ∼5-100 M . Important discoveries contained in the first Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (Abbott et al. 2019) include the discovery of BHs more massive than those detected through electromagnetic observations in the Galaxy (Abbott et al. 2016) and the direct association of short gamma-ray bursts with binary neutron star mergers (Abbott et al. 2017). The increased size of the sample on the second Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (Abbott et al. 2020a) points to additional features in the proper-ties of merging binary BHs, indicative of the contribution of multiple formation channels (Abbott et al. 2021;Zevin et al. 2021). Accurate predictions from different formation channels are then necessary to understand their relative contributions.In the last five years, the discoveries from ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors have driven a large effort to understand the origin of compact binary black holes (BHs).

        <p>A large number of formation scenarios have been proposed to form the merging binary BHs observed by ground-based detectors. Scenarios that involve binary systems include evolution through a common-envelope (CE) phase (e.g., Paczynski 1976;van den Heuvel 1976;Tutukov &amp; Yungelson 1993;Belczynski et al. 2002;Dominik et al. 2012;Stevenson et al. 2017;Giacobbo &amp; Mapelli 2018), chemically homogeneous evolution (Mandel &amp; de Mink 2016;Marchant et al. 2016;de Mink &amp; Mandel 2016;du Buisson et al. 2020;Riley et al. 2021), stable mass transfer (MT; van den Heuvel et al. 2017;Neijssel et al. 2019;Bavera et al. 2021) and Population III stars (Belczynski et al. 2004;Kinugawa et al. 2014; Article published by EDP Sciences A107, page 1 of 22 Inayoshi et al. 2017). Dynamical processes are also predicted to contribute to the observed sample, including isolated triple systems (Thompson 2011;Antonini et al. 2017;Vigna-Gómez et al. 2021) and interactions in globular (e.g., Kulkarni et al. 1993;Sigurdsson &amp; Hernquist 1993;Portegies Zwart &amp; McMillan 2000;Rodriguez et al. 2015;Di Carlo et al. 2019) and nuclear clusters (Antonini &amp; Perets 2012). Additional formation scenarios include the pairing and growth of stellar mass BHs in the disks of active galactic nuclei (McKernan et al. 2014;Stone et al. 2017;Bartos et al. 2017), and primordial BH formation (Bird et al. 2016;Sasaki et al. 2018).A large number of formation scenarios have been proposed to form the merging binary BHs observed by ground-based detectors.

        <p>Our focus is on the formation of merging binary BHs through both CE evolution and stable MT. The majority of predicted binary BHs that formed through CE evolution or stable MT in an isolated binary involve an initial phase of stable MT. This removes the hydrogen envelope of the more massive star and leads to the formation of a wide single degenerate binary (Dominik et al. 2012;Langer et al. 2020). When the secondary evolves and thus fills its Roche lobe, depending on its response to mass loss and the mass ratio of the system, it can undergo a CE phase which ejects the envelope of the secondary at the cost of hardening the binary (cf. Belczynski et al. 2016). If the second phase of MT is stable, depending on the mass ratio of the system, a phase of nonconservative mass transfer can harden the binary without the need for CE evolution, as van den Heuvel et al. (2017) argue, thus potentially allowing for the formation of compact object binaries that can merge within a Hubble time. Recent studies have claimed that the contribution from stable mass transfer to the observed sample of merging binary BHs can be comparable or even larger than those that formed through CE evolution (Neijssel et al. 2019;Bavera et al. 2021).Our focus is on the formation of merging binary BHs through both CE evolution and stable MT.

        <p>However, binary evolution models have large uncertainties associated with the CE phase (see Ivanova et al. 2013 for a recent review). Important open issues include the unknown efficiency of CE evolution (Zorotovic et al. 2010;Davis et al. 2012;Toonen &amp; Nelemans 2013), the mass boundary at which CE evolution terminates (the core-envelope boundary; Han et al. 1994;Dewi &amp; Tauris 2000;Ivanova 2011), and the actual conditions for the onset of CE evolution (Hjellming &amp; Webbink 1987;Soberman et al. 1997;Pavlovskii et al. 2017). Observational and theoretical constraints for the outcome of CE evolution in massive stars are also limited as the vast majority of observed post-CE systems as well as multidimensional hydrodynamical simulations of CE evolution correspond to low and intermediatemass stars (see Iaconi &amp; De Marco 2019 for a recent compilation of CE simulations and observed post-CE systems).However, binary evolution models have large uncertainties associated with the CE phase (see Ivanova et al. 2013 for a recent review).

        <p>One uncertainty of CE evolution that is studied in population synthesis calculations is the impact of the evolutionary stage of the star at the onset of CE evolution. Belczynski et al. (2010) proposed that in low metallicity environments, a larger number of massive stars are expected to survive CE evolution, thus leading to an enhanced formation rate of merging binary BHs. This is argued as a consequence of halted expansion after corehydrogen burning, with stellar models undergoing core-helium burning as blue supergiants and covering a larger range of radii after core-helium ignition. Belczynski et al. (2010) argued that interaction after core-helium ignition favors the ejection of the envelope as, at that point, a well defined core-envelope structure is formed. In various population synthesis codes, this argument is encoded in "pessimistic" and "optimistic" options for CE survival. In the pessimistic approach, all systems undergoing CE evolution before core-helium ignition are assumed to merge during CE evolution, while the optimistic approach allows for their survival. Recently, Klencki et al. (2020Klencki et al. ( , 2021) ) have argued that this approach likely overestimates the number of merging binary BHs that formed as most of the systems predicted to survive CE in the optimistic scenario would initiate CE evolution with a radiative envelope that has a binding energy too large to eject through an inspiral.One uncertainty of CE evolution that is studied in population synthesis calculations is the impact of the evolutionary stage of the star at the onset of CE evolution.

        <p>The aim of this work is to study, in detail, how the evolutionary stage of the stellar progenitor of a BH affects MT stability and the outcomes of CE evolution. We do this by computing detailed models with the MESA code (Paxton et al. 2011(Paxton et al. , 2013(Paxton et al. , 2015(Paxton et al. , 2018(Paxton et al. , 2019) ) of a low metallicity massive star with a BH companion, meant to reproduce the evolution of a binary system after the formation of the first BH. Recent work on the formation of binary BHs using detailed binary evolution models (in contrast to rapid population synthesis calculations) has been presented by Eldridge &amp; Stanway (2016) and Pavlovskii et al. (2017), covering a broad range of donor masses and metallicities. Our work, in contrast, focuses on a single donor mass of 30 M at a metallicity of Z /10, but with a large resolution in the initial mass ratio and period. This allows us to study, in detail, how the stability of MT and the outcomes of CE evolution are affected by the evolutionary stage of the donor. For these calculations, we have made improvements to the commonly used MT prescription of Kolb &amp; Ritter (1990, hereafter KR90) and implemented a method to model CE evolution which selfconsistently determines the core-envelope boundary. Our methods are described in Sect. 2 and we present our results in Sect. 3. We conclude by discussing our results in Sect. 4.

        <p>We performed our simulations using version 
            <rs type="version">15140</rs> of the 
            <rs type="software">MESA</rs> stellar evolution code. Our models consist of binary systems with a 30 M donor star and a BH companion. The objective of these simulations is to model a MT event happening after the formation of the first BH in the system, which is argued to be the most important MT phase where a CE can lead to the formation of a merging binary BH (cf. Dominik et al. 2012). Since we did not model the previous evolution of the system, we approximated the starting state of the donor star in the system as a zero-age mainsequence (ZAMS) star of its mass. Evolution was computed until either core carbon was depleted or until a merger between the donor star and the BH occurred.

        <p>Mass transfer rates were computed using the method described in Sect. 2.1, while the actual accretion rate into the BH was limited to its Eddington rate as described in Marchant et al. (2017). Our model for CE evolution is described in Sect. 2.2. Mass loss, either due to stellar winds from the donor or from mass ejected from the vicinity of the BH by MT above the Eddington limit, was assumed to take an amount of angular momentum corresponding to the specific orbital angular momentum of each component. We also accounted for the possibility of a star growing to the point that not only it overfilled its Roche lobe, but also overflowed its outer Lagrangian point. Whenever this happened, we accounted for the loss of mass and angular momentum as described in Sect. 2.1.5. Angular momentum loss from GW radiation was also included (Peters 1964), but it does not play a role in the timescales of evolution of our models which are of the order of millions of years. Our simulations do not take stellar rotation or spin-orbit coupling into account.Mass transfer rates were computed using the method described in Sect. 2.1, while the actual accretion rate into the BH was limited to its Eddington rate as described in Marchant et al.

        <p>Our stellar models were computed at a low metallicity of Z = Z /10, where we took the relative metal mass fractions from Grevesse &amp; Sauval (1998) and the solar abundance to be Z = 0.0142 (Asplund et al. 2009). Opacities were computed using opacity tables from the OPAL project (Iglesias &amp; Rogers 1996), together with the low temperature opacity tables of Ferguson et al. (2005). The equation of state used by MESA consists of a combination of OPAL (Rogers &amp; Nayfonov 2002), HELM (Timmes &amp; Swesty 2000), PC (Potekhin &amp; Chabrier 2010), and SCVH (Saumon et al. 1995).

        <p>Convection was modeled using the mixing length theory of Böhm-Vitense (1958) as described by Cox &amp; Giuli (1968), using a mixing length parameter α MLT = 2. Convective regions were determined using the Ledoux criterion (Ledoux 1947). We included overshooting of the hydrogen burning convective core using a step-overshooting scheme, extending the size of the convective core by α ov = 0.335 pressure scale heights following the calibration of Brott et al. (2011). Overshooting from other convective regions is not well understood, so for convective cores after the main-sequence, we included a small amount of exponential overshooting (Herwig 2000) given by a length scale for exponential decay of the mixing coefficient of f = 0.012 . We also included semi-convective mixing (Langer et al. 1983) and thermohaline mixing (Kippenhahn et al. 1980). Following Schootemeijer et al. (2019), we adopted a large value for the efficiency parameter for semiconvection α sc = 100, while for thermohaline mixing we adopted an efficiency parameter of unity.Convection was modeled using the mixing length theory of Böhm-Vitense (1958) as described by Cox &amp; Giuli (1968), using a mixing length parameter α MLT = 2.

        <p>Stellar winds were accounted for using a combination of different mass loss rate prescriptions as described by Brott et al. (2011). This includes the line-driven mass loss rates derived by Vink et al. (2001) for stars with a hydrogen surface mass fraction of X &gt; 0.7 and the Wolf-Rayet mass loss rate of Hamann et al. (1995) for X &lt; 0.4, scaled by a factor of 10 to account for wind clumping (Yoon et al. 2010). For surface hydrogen mass fractions between X = 0.7 and X = 0.4, we interpolated between the rate of Vink et al. (2001) and Hamann et al. (1995) to provide a continuous transition. At temperatures below that of the bistability jump (as derived by Vink et al. 2001), we took the maximum between the rate of Nieuwenhuijzen &amp; de Jager (1990) and the one resulting from the combination of the Vink et al. (2001) and Hamann et al. (1995) rates we just described. Additionally, we scaled the Nieuwenhuijzen &amp; de Jager (1990) rate by the same factor (Z/Z ) 0.85 predicted by Vink et al. (2001) for line-driven winds. This significantly lowers the mass loss rates of red-supergiants in low metallicity environments, although observations suggest there is only a weak dependence on metallicity (van Loon et al. 2005;Goldman et al. 2017). Nevertheless, we kept this scaling for the sake of comparison, as it is commonly used in population synthesis calculations.Stellar winds were accounted for using a combination of different mass loss rate prescriptions as described by Brott et al.

As pointed out by Ivanova (2011), a star can significantly contract during a phase of rapid mass loss, but re-expand by orders of magnitude on a few thermal timescales if mass loss is suddenly shut off. Because of this, they determined the core mass of a stellar model by performing rapid mass loss simulations and finding at which mass coordinate the resulting star would not re-expand after mass loss is shut off. In our simulations, we did find re-expansion after CE, which, according to Ivanova (2011), would indicate that the core boundary is at a deeper mass coordinate.

        <p>In this work, we focus on the evolution of a 30 M star at a metallicity of Z /10 in order to assess how some of the differences expected from evolution in low metallicity environments can affect the outcome of either MT or CE evolution. As we did not perform a broad analysis for different donor masses and metallicities, we cannot perform population synthesis to compute, for example, the resulting rates of binary BHs observable by groundbased detectors. However, this serves to assess if some of the assumptions commonly used in rapid population synthesis codes are justified. In particular, Belczynski et al. (2010) argued that for BH progenitors, ejection of the envelope during CE evolution is more likely to happen in low metallicity environments, as these systems are predicted to halt their expansion in the Hertzsprung gap (HG) before rising on the Hayashi line as red supergiants, spending a significant fraction of their core helium burning lifetime as blue supergiants. After core helium ignition, it is argued that a well defined core-envelope structure is formed, which allows for a successful envelope ejection. A halted expansion after the main sequence is a common feature in stellar evolution calculations at low metallicity (see Appendix C). Before discussing grids of binary simulations, it is instructive to study how our 30 M donor evolves as a single star. The top panel of Fig. 4 shows the evolution in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram for this star under the physical assumptions described in Sect. 2, for which we find that expansion is halted before becoming a red supergiant. Most of the helium-burning phase of this star would be spent as a blue supergiant with a convective envelope developing only near core helium depletion. This type of evolution is sensitive to physical assumptions in the model. In particular, Fig. 4 shows the effect of increasing overshooting during core hydrogen burning, as well as increasing wind strengths. With increased overshooting, the star undergoes rapid expansion after the main sequence and becomes a red supergiant before core helium ignition. The model with a higher mass loss rate slows down its expansion before becoming a red supergiant, but it expands to a larger radius during the HG than our default model. These variations are not captured in rapid population synthesis codes, in particular those reliant on the fits to single star evolution of Hurley et al. (2000) which are based on detailed stellar models without mass loss and with a fixed amount of overshooting. Stellar winds may be overestimated in our calculations (Björklund et al. 2021), while observations of massive stars suggest that our choice for overshooting from a convective hydrogen-burning core is underestimated for stars with masses &gt;15 M (Castro et al. 2014). Keeping in mind that due to uncertainties in stellar evolution, a halted expansion in the HG is uncertain, we can still study what would be the consequences in the evolution of a star if this effect is real.In this work, we focus on the evolution of a 30 M star at a metallicity of Z /10 in order to assess how some of the differences expected from evolution in low metallicity environments can affect the outcome of either MT or CE evolution.

        <p>Focusing only on our model that uses our default set of assumptions, we assessed if core helium ignition has a significant impact on the core-envelope structure of the star which could favor CE ejection. Figure 5 shows a Kippenhahn diagram for the 30 M model, indicating how the stellar radius and binding energy of the envelope evolve. Assuming that the coreenvelope boundary is located at the points where the hydrogen mass fraction drops below either X = 0.1 or X = 0.3 (similar to Dewi &amp; Tauris 2000), we find that the binding energy of the star remains at ∼10 50 erg from terminal-age main sequence (TAMS) to the point where a convective envelope is developed. This happens despite a ∼30 fold increase in the stellar radius. This model experiences the formation and merger of multiple intermediate convection zones during the HG phase, so we performed convergence tests to verify that our results are not significantly affected by changes in temporal and spatial resolution during this phase (see Appendix D).Focusing only on our model that uses our default set of assumptions, we assessed if core helium ignition has a significant impact on the core-envelope structure of the star which could favor CE ejection.

        <p>If one computes the binding energy using, for example, the fit provided by Claeys et al. (2014) rather than the structure of the model, the resulting binding energy is always underestimated, with more that an order of magnitude difference in late stages 5 . In particular, this fit to the binding energy is used in population synthesis calculations of GW sources, including the MOBSE (Giacobbo &amp; Mapelli 2018) and COSMIC (Breivik et al. 2020) codes.

In this case, we also find a consistent underestimation of the binding energy 5 Claeys et al. (2014) provide fits for the dimensionless λ parameter, which is defined as E bind = G(M -M core )M/λR, where M core is the core mass that would remain after CE. We computed the corresponding binding energy by assuming that M core is the helium core mass of our model. A description of how we computed these λ fits from our stellar models is given in Appendix E. 6 The Xu &amp; Li (2010) fits only cover masses up to 20 M . For higher masses, Dominik et al. (2012) requested additional models and performed fits to these. Although the fitting formulae are not given in Dominik et al.

        <p>The constancy of the binding energy while the star expands with a radiative envelope is also illustrated by Fig. 7, which shows the full binding energy profiles at different evolutionary phases. In particular, between the end of the HG and the point where a deep convective envelope starts to develop, the radius of the star increases by more than an order of magnitude, but this expansion only happens in the outermost mass layers of the star. It is only after the formation of the convective envelope that a large fraction of the envelope mass is pushed to large radii with correspondingly low binding energies that would make envelope ejection during CE feasible. All of this points to the ignition of helium at the stellar core having no impact on the binding energy of the envelope, and also since the ignition of helium does not modify the mode of energy transport in the outer layers, the stability of MT should not be impacted in a fundamental way either.The constancy of the binding energy while the star expands with a radiative envelope is also illustrated by Fig. 7, which shows the full binding energy profiles at different evolutionary phases.

        <p>Using our prescription for MT and our method to calculate the outcome of CE evolution, we computed a grid of models consisting of a 30 M donor with a BH accretor in a circular orbit. Our method for CE evolution still leaves the efficiency α CE as a free parameter, and we computed simulations with both α CE = 1, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.1. The grid spans a period range between -0.3 &lt; log 10 (P i /d) &lt; 3.5 and initial mass ratios q = M BH /M 1,i between 0.01 and 0.59. This includes BHs with masses as low as 0.3 M that are not expected to form through stellar evolution, but they were included to test the limits of MT stability. This allowed us to cover the entire parameter space where CE happens, as well as to cover systems from the boundary of RLOF at ZAMS, to effectively single star evolution at large periods. Owing to the small amount of radial expansion occurring in the phases where the star has a convective envelope, we adopted two different resolutions in the period for our grid. For log 10 (P i /d) &lt; 3.2, we used a spacing of ∆ log 10 (P i /d) = 0.1, while at higher initial orbital periods we increased the resolution in the period to ∆ log 10 (P i /d) = 0.01. The resolution in mass ratio of the grid is ∆q = 0.02. The final outcomes of our grid with α CE = 1 are shown in Fig. 8. As a simple approximation to determine if a simulation can produce a merging binary BH, for stars that reach core carbon depletion we assumed the donor star collapses directly to form a BH with a mass equal to its baryonic mass. Our 30 M donor produces final helium core masses ∼14 M , for which the formation of a BH through direct collapse is indeed expected (Fryer 1999). From our simulations, we did not find any cases of successful envelope ejection from CE evolution for initial orbital periods below log 10 (P i /d) &lt; 3.2. Below this period range, the boundary between systems undergoing stable MT and those merging during CE evolution varies continuously with the period, going from q ∼ 0.5 for systems interacting close to ZAMS, down to q ∼ 0.15 for cases where interaction happens right before the formation of a deep convective envelope. The boundary is not sensitive to whether an interaction happens before or after the TAMS, or before or after the end of the HG. This is to be expected as the radial response to rapid mass loss is dependent on the mode of energy transport in the stellar envelope (Hjellming &amp; Webbink 1987), and the envelope of the star across all these phases is radiative. Pavlovskii et al. (2017) also find stable MT between a star and a BH for such extreme mass ratios for different donor masses, but owing to their coarse mass ratio sampling (no more than three different mass ratios for each donor mass), they cannot describe in detail how the boundary for stability shifts with the initial orbital period.Using our prescription for MT and our method to calculate the outcome of CE evolution, we computed a grid of models consisting of a 30 M donor with a BH accretor in a circular orbit. Our method for CE evolution still leaves the efficiency α CE as a free parameter, and we computed simulations with both α CE = 1, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.1. The grid spans a period range between -0.3 &lt; log 10 (P i /d) &lt; 3.5 and initial mass ratios q = M BH /M 1,i between 0.01 and 0.59. This includes BHs with masses as low as 0.3 M that are not expected to form through stellar evolution, but they were included to test the limits of MT stability. This allowed us to cover the entire parameter space where CE happens, as well as to cover systems from the boundary of RLOF at ZAMS, to effectively single star evolution at large periods. Owing to the small amount of radial expansion occurring in the phases where the star has a convective envelope, we adopted two different resolutions in the period for our grid. For log 10 (P i /d) &lt; 3.2, we used a spacing of ∆ log 10 (P i /d) = 0.1, while at higher initial orbital periods we increased the resolution in the period to ∆ log 10 (P i /d) = 0.01. The resolution in mass ratio of the grid is ∆q = 0.02. The final outcomes of our grid with α CE = 1 are shown in Fig. 8. As a simple approximation to determine if a simulation can produce a merging binary BH, for stars that reach core carbon depletion we assumed the donor star collapses directly to form a BH with a mass equal to its baryonic mass. Our 30 M donor produces final helium core masses ∼14 M , for which the formation of a BH through direct collapse is indeed expected (Fryer 1999). From our simulations, we did not find any cases of successful envelope ejection from CE evolution for initial orbital periods below log 10 (P i /d) &lt; 3.2. Below this period range, the boundary between systems undergoing stable MT and those merging during CE evolution varies continuously with the period, going from q ∼ 0.5 for systems interacting close to ZAMS, down to q ∼ 0.15 for cases where interaction happens right before the formation of a deep convective envelope. The boundary is not sensitive to whether an interaction happens before or after the TAMS, or before or after the end of the HG. This is to be expected as the radial response to rapid mass loss is dependent on the mode of energy transport in the stellar envelope (Hjellming &amp; Webbink 1987), and the envelope of the star across all these phases is radiative. Pavlovskii et al. (2017) also find stable MT between a star and a BH for such extreme mass ratios for different donor masses, but owing to their coarse mass ratio sampling (no more than three different mass ratios for each donor mass), they cannot describe in detail how the boundary for stability shifts with the initial orbital period.</p>
        <p>The lack of systems surviving CE evolution between the end of the HG and the formation of a deep convective envelope can be understood in terms of the binding energy of the envelope. As was discussed for the single 30 M model, the binding energy during this phase is ∼10 50 erg. Considering evolution between the end of the HG and the formation of a convective envelope, we find that CE evolution only happens for BH masses 5 M , and that stripping the hydrogen envelope of the 30 M star would result in a ∼14 M helium core. For these masses and assuming a fully efficient use of the orbital energy to eject the envelope, in order to release 10 50 erg, the orbital separation needs to be reduced below 1.3 R , an orbit for which a helium star of 14 M would overfill its Roche lobe. Population synthesis calculations that underestimate the binding energy during this phase and find successful CE ejection, for example, by using fits such as those of Claeys et al. (2014) or by assuming a fixed value of the λ parameter, potentially overestimate the rate of formation of merging binary BHs through CE evolution (Gallegos-Garcia et al., in prep.). The boundary for unstable MT is also right at the place where it allows for a narrow band of systems undergoing stable MT that produce a binary BH merging in less than a Hubble time. In this case, the shrinkage of the orbit from stable MT is sufficient to produce a compact BH binary (van den Heuvel et al. 2017), and we find this outcome for a wide range of initial orbital periods ranging from 1 to 1000 days. Multiple systems undergoing stable MT fill their outer Lagrangian point during that process, but remain stable despite the increased angular momentum loss. For wider orbital periods, where MT occurs after the development of a deep convective envelope, the critical mass ratio for stability shifts upwards (up to q ∼ 0.5 for systems interacting after core helium depletion). The majority of our models with an assumed efficiency of α CE = 1 that manage to eject their envelopes during CE evolution result in wide BH binaries, for which GW radiation is insufficient to produce a merger in less than a Hubble time. Figure 9 shows the outcome of our simulations with CE efficiencies of α CE = 0.4, 0.2, and 0.1, in which case we find that most systems that produce wide binary BHs at α CE = 1 would merge during CE evolution rather than produce merging binary BHs at lower efficiencies. One important concern in our simulations that form merging binary BHs through stable MT is that an important fraction of these undergo overflow of L 2 or even L 3 . The methods we have developed to account for this are necessarily an approximation, as they rely on hydrostatic one-dimensional stellar models. Moreover, the simulations shown in Fig. 8 do not account for potential outflows through L 2 when M a &lt; M d , which could remove significant mass and angular momentum from the system. Using the alternate method described in Sect. 2.1.6 for L 2 outflows, we can test if the systems that form merging binary BHs through stable MT are sensitive to the potential presence of such outflows. Figure 10 shows simulations done using this method that cover the region where we find that stable MT leads to merging binary BHs, including cases where we assume that the specific angular momentum removed by material outflow-ing L 2 is up to nine times the specific angular momentum of the L 2 point. Compared to our simulations that only account for overflow of the outer Lagrangian point of the donor, we find that the boundary for instability is pushed to higher BH masses. However, we still find systems across a large range of periods that form merging binary BHs, as additional angular momentum losses lead to the formation of more compact binaries post-MT. Given this, the conclusion that stable MT can lead to the formation of merging binary BHs across a large range of periods appears to be robust.The lack of systems surviving CE evolution between the end of the HG and the formation of a deep convective envelope can be understood in terms of the binding energy of the envelope.

        <p>As our models do not include the evolution prior to the formation of the first BH, we cannot assess the relative likelihood of each of our individual simulations to occur in nature. However, if we make the simplistic assumption that after BH formation the orbital period is distributed flat in log 10 P and the mass ratio distribution is flat in q, our grid with α CE = 1 gives a ratio between the number of merging binary BHs that formed through CE evolution to those that formed via stable MT of 0.017. The actual outcome of our simulations for systems surviving CE evolution should be considered with care, since we approximated a complex three-dimensional phenomenon with one-dimensional hydrostatic models. However, even under the extreme case that all our systems that survive CE evolution would produce a binary BH that merges in less than a Hubble time, we find that the ratio between merging binary BHs that formed through CE evolution to those that formed via stable MT is 0.35. This resembles the results from population synthesis calculations of Neijssel et al. (2019), who find that depending on the metallicity distribution of the star formation history, most merging binary BHs that will be observed by current generation GW detectors at design sensitivity would have been formed through stable MT. Our results suggest that the yield of merging binary BHs from CE evolution is overestimated at low metallicities, which would further increase the relative contribution of stable MT relative to CE evolution in population synthesis calculations such as those of Neijssel et al.

        <p>We consider here two cases from our simulation grid that lead to the formation of a merging binary BH: a system interacting before the end of HG (M BH = 7.5 M , P i = 31.6 days) and one interacting after it (M BH = 4.5 M , P i = 1000 days). The short period system evolves without overflowing its outer Lagrangian point, while the long period one is expected to overflow it, so we can use it to study how the resulting outcome is modified when accounting for this on our MT prescription. To evaluate the impact of the changes we have made to the MT prescription of (KR90), we used four different setups for our simulations: 1. A full implementation of our MT prescription including overflows from the outer Lagrangian point as described in Sect. 2.1.5. 2.

        <p>prescription, and in the absence of outflows from the outer Lagrangian point, the computed MT rate is expected to be higher than that of KR90. This is because dropping the assumption of P/ρ = kT/µm H of KR90 and accounting for the linear term in dA/dΦ increases the value of the integrand in Eq. ( 24). As shown in Fig. 12, we do find that both of these assumptions result in a lower MT rate and a higher amount of RLOF compared to our full MT scheme. This is very noticeable in the slower second MT phase, where our new MT prescription predicts a maximum Roche filling factor of R/R RL = 1.16, while the standard prescription from KR90 reaches R/R RL = 1.37 during this phase. For this example system, we find that the largest difference from the KR90 prescription comes from dropping the assumption that P/ρ = kT/µm H , while the contribution of the linear term in dA/dΦ has a much smaller impact.

        <p>maximum accounts for less than 9% of the total mass loss rate of the star. Since most mass is still transferred through L 1 , the additional angular momentum loss from mass loss through L 3 only produces a small change in the final orbital separation, with the model using the prescription of KR90 resulting in a final orbital period of 1.6 days compared to the 1.5 day result when using our updated MT prescription. For this binary system, we find that during overflow of the outer Lagrangian point including the linear term in dA/dΦ has an effect comparable to that of assuming P/ρ = kT/µm H .

        <p>As the specific angular momentum that would be carried by material being ejected through the outer Lagrangian point is uncertain (we assume by default that it corresponds to the location of the Lagrangian point), we also repeated the 1000 day simulation but increased the angular momentum loss rate associated with this effect by factors of 4 and 9. In both cases, we still find the system to be stable, but they result in much shorter final periods of 1.2 day and 0.83 day. This corresponds to delay times of 3.6 Gyr and 1.2 Gyr, compared to the 6.0 Gyr delay time for our default model. This additional uncertainty could then allow for stable MT to produce systems with short delay times, where tidal spin-up can result in a high spin second formed BH (cf. Bavera et al. 2020).

        <p>To illustrate the result of our simulations that survive CE evolution, we consider a particular model that results in successful ejection in both our α CE = 1 and α CE = 0.1 grids, which has a 30 M star with a 14.1 M BH in an initial orbit of 2344 days. This model undergoes RLOF after core helium depletion and the evolution of their stellar and Roche lobe radii is shown in Fig. 14 for both CE efficiencies considered. Before the onset of RLOF, wind mass loss reduces the mass of the donor to 28.2 M and before hitting the threshold value of Ṁhigh = 1 M yr -1 at which we started modeling the system as a CE, the mass of the donor is reduced to 24.7 M . The onset of CE happens after the star slightly overflows its outer Lagrangian point (R/R L out = 1.08), at which point our MT prescription predicts 53% of the mass to be lost by the star going through L 3 . During the CE calculation, we artificially removed the mass and adjusted the separation according to the binding energy of the removed layers, resulting in a sharper decrease in mass of the Roche lobe radius for the lower CE efficiency. The stellar radius remained larger than 10 3 R until the mass of the star was lowered below 15 M , at which point the radius began to decrease sharply with the mass.To illustrate the result of our simulations that survive CE evolution, we consider a particular model that results in successful ejection in both our α CE = 1 and α CE = 0.1 grids, which has a 30 M star with a 14.1 M BH in an initial orbit of 2344 days.

        <p>Figure 15 shows the binding energy profiles of the star at different phases of evolution. Between the beginning of RLOF and the onset of CE evolution, the donor loses ∼3 M of mass which modifies the binding energy of the convective envelope but not of the deeper layers. The binding energy of the ejected envelope changes significantly between the α CE = 1 and α CE = 0.1 simulations with E bind = -3.9 × 10 47 erg and E bind = -4.3 × 10 48 erg, respectively. For the fully efficient simulation, all ejected mass formed part of the convective envelope at the onset of CE. This factor of about 10 difference on the binding energy, coupled with the factor of 10 difference in CE efficiency leads to very different outcomes post-CE. The α CE = 1 simulation terminates CE evolution with an orbital separation of 570 R , while the α CE = 0.1 simulation finishes CE with an orbital separation of 8.4 R . As discussed by Deloye &amp; Taam (2010), the core-envelope boundary is not uniquely defined, resulting in different values depending on the mass ratio and efficiency of the process. One caveat of our simulations is that the amount of mass loss previous to CE evolution is sensitive to our choice of Ṁhigh , which modifies the binding energy of the outer layers of the star (see Appendix B). This modifies the post-CE separation for systems we predict to remain wide, such as the α = 1 system discussed here. Accurate predictions for these wide post-CE models requires a better description of how the star transitions from stable MT to CE evolution.Figure 15 shows the binding energy profiles of the star at different phases of evolution.

        <p>After detachment, for both efficiencies we find that the donor undergoes a thermal pulse and re-expands, filling its Roche lobe but undergoing stable MT rather than developing a CE again. Figure 16 shows the evolution in the HR diagram both before and after CE evolution. For the case of fully efficient CE evolution, during this additional phase of MT the star would appear as an extended blue or yellow supergiant with a surface hydrogen mass fraction of X s ∼ 0.4. The duration of this MT phase for the case of α CE = 1 is ∼2000 years, during which mass is transferred at a rate above the Eddington limit of the 14.1 M BH companion. For the α CE = 0.1 case, the donor star has a radius of just 2 R with a surface hydrogen mass fraction of X s ∼ 0.3, and it transfers mass at super-Eddington rates for ∼800 years. Given that the Eddington luminosity of a 14.1 M BH is ∼2 × 10 39 erg s -1 , during this final MT phase the system can potentially appear as an ultra-luminous X-ray source (see Kaaret et al. 2017 for a recent review), but owing to the short time before core carbon depletion, the number of observable sources could be negligible compared to those that formed by other evolutionary pathways. Not all our simulations that survive CE evolution have short lifetimes as X-ray sources. For the system we have discussed so far, this is the case because CE evolution happens after core helium depletion. If we consider a system with a 7.5 M BH at an initial orbital period of 2000 days and α CE = 1, we find that the onset of CE happens when the donor has a central helium mass fraction of Y c = 0.02, and for the entirety of its post-CE lifetime until core carbon depletion (26 000 years), it is a Rochelobe filling binary. This matches the results of Quast et al. (2019) who argue that post-CE systems can undergo MT on the nuclear timescale of the donor. We expect that in cases where the star does not halt its expansion in the HG, CE evolution is initiated with a much larger value of Y c , leading to a longer lifetime as an X-ray source post-CE.After detachment, for both efficiencies we find that the donor undergoes a thermal pulse and re-expands, filling its Roche lobe but undergoing stable MT rather than developing a CE again. Figure 16 shows the evolution in the HR diagram both before and after CE evolution.

        <p>The single model we considered with different values of α CE illustrates how the binding energy is dependent on the efficiency of CE evolution, but using the models from our grid we can see how the resulting binding energy of systems surviving CE evolution depends on the mass ratio as well. Figure 17 illustrates the binding energy as a function of the radius at RLOF resulting from models at three different initial mass ratios, α CE = 1, and varying initial orbital periods. For most of these simulations, we find that CE evolution terminates near or above the mass coordinate of the bottom of the convective envelope at RLOF, resulting in binding energies &lt;10 48 erg.

        <p>All of these simulations managed to eject their envelopes during CE evolution, and Fig. 18 shows the resulting masses post-CE as well as the binding energy of the ejected layers. We find that CE terminates when the surface hydrogen mass fraction is relatively high (X ∼ 0.4-0.5) and that the binding energy of the envelope varies between 1.3 × 10 50 erg and 6.6 × 10 49 erg, a factor of 2 variation despite a change by a factor of 20 in radius at RLOF. Figure 18 also illustrates that whether RLOF occurs before or after the end of the HG has no impact on the binding energy. Estimating the binding energy using either the Claeys et al.

Since the binding energy just changes by a factor of 2 despite over an order of magnitude change in the radius of the star, population synthesis calculations that approximate E bind using a fixed value of the dimensionless λ parameter cannot reproduce the variation of E bind with radius, independent of the choice of λ.All of these simulations managed to eject their envelopes during CE evolution, and Fig. 18 shows the resulting masses post-CE as well as the binding energy of the ejected layers.

        <p>1. Stable MT after the formation of the first BH in a binary can produce merging binary BHs for a broad range of orbital periods. The boundary between stable and unstable MT is located at a point that allows for orbital hardening just from stable MT, without requiring a CE phase (van den Heuvel et al. 2017). This includes cases where MT between the star and the first formed BH is initiated during the main sequence. We also find cases where the low density envelope of the donor would overflow its outer Lagrangian point. Using our model to quantify this outflow, we find that binaries can remain stable despite the high specific angular momentum of this outflow, resulting in more compact binaries after MT than if the process is ignored. 2. We do not find any case of CE evolution initiated with a star with a radiative envelope where the envelope is successfully ejected. Between the TAMS and the start of the rise in the Hayashi line, the binding energy of the envelope remains at ∼10 50 erg, varying by just a factor of two despite an increase of more than an order of magnitude in radius. Before the formation of a deep convective envelope, we find that the prescriptions of Xu &amp; Li (2010), as developed by Dominik et al. (2012) for M &gt; 20 M , and Claeys et al. (2014) underestimate the binding energy of the envelope by up to an order of magnitude. 3. The parameter space where systems can survive CE is limited to a small range in the initial orbital period (∼0.2 dex) where RLOF happens after the formation of a deep convective envelope. Assuming that all internal and recombination energy as well as all the energy from inspiral during CE is used to eject the envelope, we find that the majority of these systems surviving CE would form binary BHs too wide to merge within a Hubble time. 4. As in Deloye &amp; Taam (2010), we find that the core-envelope boundary is not uniquely defined, with different CE efficiencies (or similarly, different mass ratios) resulting in different binding energies for the envelope. In particular for the case discussed in Sect. 2.2, we computed binding energies that differ by over an order of magnitude depending on the efficiency of CE evolution. This is in contrast to the way binding energies are determined in population synthesis codes, where a star has a uniquely defined binding energy at each point of its evolution. 5. Under the simple assumption of a flat distribution in the mass ratio and a flat distribution in log P after the formation of the first BH, we find that stable MT would dominate the formation rate of merging binary BHs. If we consider CE efficiency to be 100%, the ratio of binaries surviving CE evolution (independent of whether they form a compact or wide binary BH) to those that form merging binary BHs from stable MT is 0.35. This is further reduced to 0.017 if we take only the CE simulations that produce merging binary BHs. This is in significant contradiction with rapid population synthesis calculations that predict the vast majority (&gt;90%) of BHs are formed via an initial phase of stable MT before the formation of the first BH, followed by a CE phase when the secondary fills its Roche lobe (cf. Table 4 of Dominik et al. 2012). These results broadly agree with those of Klencki et al. (2020Klencki et al. ( , 2021)), who have used single star models with a fixed definition of the core-envelope boundary to propose that current population synthesis calculations may overestimate the production rate of merging binary BHs from CE evolution. Since our simulations are restricted to a 30 M donor at Z = Z /10, it is necessary to further explore different masses and metallicities to understand how generally our conclusions apply (Gallegos-Garcia et al., in prep.). Recent investigations using rapid population synthesis codes have indicated that given current uncertainties in binary evolution such as the cosmic star formation rate (Neijssel et al. 2019) or the critical mass ratio for stable MT (Andrews et al. 2020), stable MT could be an important production channel for the merging binary BHs observed with gravitational waves. Our results indicate these rapid population synthesis calculations still significantly overestimate the number of systems surviving CE evolution at low metallicities, and accounting for this would further reduce the contribution from the CE evolution channel.1.

        <p>As we find that the boundary between stable and unstable MT is located right at a point that allows for the formation of merging binary BHs via stable MT, any uncertainties that can shift this boundary can have a large effect on the number and properties of expected GW sources. Among such uncertainties, we can point out that our simulations do not include stellar rotation or tidal coupling to the orbit. This additional sink of orbital angular momentum can potentially affect the stability of MT in our calculations. We have explicitly checked in our stable MT simulations that the moment of inertia of the star is too low to undergo the Darwin instability (Darwin 1879), which is the limit were tidal coupling leads to a runaway shrinkage of the orbit. Another important simplification is that we did not account for the effect of the companion in the momentum equation, which would make the adiabatic response of the star to mass loss dependent on the mass ratio of the system and its separation. It has also been argued that hydrodynamics need to be considered to assess the stability of MT for giant donors (Pavlovskii &amp; Ivanova 2015), although a consistent treatment of hydrodynamics needs to consider the perturbation to the gravitational potential from the companion star as well. Additionally, a significant number of the systems we predict that form merging binary BHs also undergo overflow of the L 2 and even the L 3 equipotentials. Although for these large overflow cases, we have verified that merging binary BHs are formed even under extreme assumptions of mass and angular momentum outflows, three-dimensional hydrodynamic studies are required to accurately model outflows in such systems. All these uncertainties need to be studied in detail to determine if stable MT can indeed produce merging binary BHs.As we find that the boundary between stable and unstable MT is located right at a point that allows for the formation of merging binary BHs via stable MT, any uncertainties that can shift this boundary can have a large effect on the number and properties of expected GW sources.

        <p>Our simulations for the outcome of CE evolution also have important uncertainties. Although we do not have the coreenvelope mass boundary as a free parameter, we still have the CE efficiency as an unknown variable. The efficiency can be reduced by radiative processes or also by a surplus of energy being removed as kinetic energy from the system (cf. Nandez &amp; Ivanova 2016). Within the context of one-dimensional stellar models, it might be possible to constrain the efficiency of the CE process by means of simplified hydrodynamical simulations of the inspiral (Taam et al. 1978;Clayton et al. 2017;Fragos et al. 2019) or, ideally, with full three-dimensional simulations of CE evolution in massive stars (Taam &amp; Sandquist 2000;Ricker et al. 2019;Law-Smith et al. 2020). Despite these uncertainties that significantly affect the outcome of systems that survive CE evolution, we consider our conclusion that massive stars would merge when undergoing CE prior to the formation of a convective envelope as much more certain. We find this result for the case of full efficiency for the CE process, including recombination energy. Our method to determine the coreenvelope boundary can also be considered to produce a lower bound on the binding energies. If we were to consider the boundary deeper inside down at the point where thermal pulses would not happen post-CE (Ivanova 2011), we would find larger binding energies and less systems surviving CE evolution. Our simulations do not exclude CE evolution as an efficient mechanism to form merging binary neutron stars. At lower masses, a larger fraction of the stellar expansion of a star during its lifetime happens after the formation of a deep convective envelope (Fig. 19). This results in a broader range of orbital periods where we expect the ejection of a CE to be possible, leading to binaries compact enough to merge from GW radiation. Following the work of Misra et al. (2020), the boundaries for stable MT between a star and a neutron star companion do not allow for stars massive enough to form a second neutron star in the system. This excludes stable MT as a formation channel for merging neutron stars. The case of MT and CE evolution in the case of neutron star companions will be studied in future work.Our simulations for the outcome of CE evolution also have important uncertainties.

        <p>The relative importance of the constant and linear terms for dA/dΦ shown in Eq. ( 8) can be assessed by using the ratio of dA/dΦ(∆Φ = 0) and d 2 A/dΦ 2 (∆Φ = 0). This essentially quantifies how large ∆Φ needs to be to produce a significant change in dA/dΦ, with smaller values indicating a higher sensitivity to ∆Φ, and thus a larger importance of the higher-order term. Figure A.1 shows this value at different mass ratios both for the L 1 and L out points of a star. This value is always positive, indicating that the inclusion of the higher-order term results in an increased value of the computed MT rate. We also see that the value of the ratio is much smaller for the outer Lagrangian point, and in the case where the donor is the more massive component in the binary, a variation of Φ on the order of 0.1 GM d /a can modify dA/dΦ significantly. This points out that the inclusion of the higher-order term has a larger impact on the computation of outflows from the outer Lagrangian point than from L 1 . As our algorithm to model CE evolution has various numerical parameters, it is important to evaluate in detail how our results depend upon these. Here we modify the three parameters described in Sect. 2.2: Ṁhigh , Ṁlow , and δ, for which in our default model we used 1 M yr -1 , 10 -5 M yr -1 , and 0.02, respectively. Here, we consider the difference in the outcome of the CE simulations shown in Sect. 3.3 for variations in these three parameters, with the properties of the system post-CE being shown in Table B.1. For all parameters, we find only ∼5% variations in the post-CE properties, except for variations of Ṁhigh when using an efficiency α CE = 1. Detachment in these systems happens in the proximity of the mass coordinate from the bottom of the convective envelope at the onset of CE. Variations in Ṁhigh modifies the mass of the star at the onset of CE, as is shown in Table B.1. This modifies the binding energy in the outermost layers, which is illustrated in Fig. B.1, making evolution sensitive to the exact point at which we switched between MT and CE evolution. This is not the case for the system with α CE = 0.1, as the core-envelope boundary is computed to be deeper in the star, in layers that are not affected by the exact point at which we switched between MT and CE evolution. Notes. Results are shown for the system with a 14.1 M BH and an initial period of 2344 days which is described in Sect. 3.3. The default choices for the numerical parameters are Ṁhigh = 1 M yr -1 , Ṁlow = 10 -5 M yr -1 , and δ = 0.02. The variations of these parameters that we consider correspond to varying Ṁhigh and Ṁlow by up to a factor of 4, and modifying δ to 0.001 and 0.04. For each case, the first two columns show the mass and separation of the system at the onset of CE, while the rest of the columns show the resulting core mass M core , binding energy E bind , and post-CE separation a post CE derived by the simulations for both α CE = 1 and α CE = 0.1. Given the formation of multiple intermediate convection zones in our models during the HG phase, we performed a resolution test to see if our results are significantly modified by increased spatial and temporal resolution. We made use of the mesh_delta_coeff and time_delta_coeff options that allow for an approximate scaling of all spatial and temporal resolution controls, and used models with approximately two, four, and eight times the resolution of our default setup. The resulting tracks in the HR diagram are shown in Fig. D.1. We see small variations with changes in resolution on the evolution during the HG phase, producing a variation of about 10% on the effective temperature at which the HG phase ends.The relative importance of the constant and linear terms for dA/dΦ shown in Eq.

        <p>The fits from Claeys et al. (2014) and Xu &amp; Li (2010) depend on the mass of the star, its radius, and its evolutionary stage in terms of the star-types defined by Hurley et al. (2002). A model analogous to our 30 M model is assigned types "HG" during the HG, "CHeB" during core helium burning but before ascending the Hayashi line, and "EAGB" while on the Hayashi line. To distinguish between the CHeB and EAGB types in our models, we considered models with convective envelopes &gt;1 M to be of type EAGB, as we found this is close to the point where the star rises on the Hayashi line.
