        <p>Experiments at the interface of quantum optics and chemistry have revealed that strong coupling between light and matter can substantially modify the chemical and physical properties of molecules and solids. While the theoretical description of such situations is usually based on nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics, which contains quadratic light-matter coupling terms, it is commonplace to disregard these terms and restrict the treatment to purely bilinear couplings. In this work, we clarify the physical origin and the substantial impact of the most common quadratic terms, the diamagnetic and self-polarization terms, and highlight why neglecting them can lead to rather unphysical results. Specifically, we demonstrate their relevance by showing that neglecting these terms leads to the loss of gauge invariance, basis set dependence, disintegration (loss of bound states) of any system in the basis set limit, unphysical radiation of the ground state, and an artificial dependence on the static dipole. Besides providing important guidance for modeling of strongly coupled light-matter systems, the presented results also indicate conditions under which those effects might become accessible.Experiments at the interface of quantum optics and chemistry have revealed that strong coupling between light and matter can substantially modify the chemical and physical properties of molecules and solids.

        <p>D riven by substantial experimental progress in the field of cavity-modified chemistry, [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] theoretical methods at the border between quantum-chemical ab initio methods and optics have become the focus of many recent investigations. The high complexity of a molecular system, which can undergo, e.g., chemical reactions or quantum phase transitions, coupled strongly to photons makes the use of some sort of approximation strategy necessary. A common approach is to use approximation strategies designed for atomic two-level-like systems in highquality optical cavities [59][60][61] and to apply them to the quite different situation of molecular systems. However, under the generalized conditions of cavity-modified chemistry, contributions in the theoretical description that are usually disregarded, e.g., quadratic terms describing the coupling between light and matter, can become important 15,62,63 and might even dominate the physical properties. [13][14][15][16]64,65 While the existence of these quadratic terms is well-known, [66][67][68][69][70][71][72][73] their origin, interpretation, and consequences are less clear, and when to include them has become the subject of recent intense discussions. 15,40,62,[74][75][76][77][78][79][80][81][82] Here we will elucidate these terms for the most relevant setting of cavity-modified chemistry (i.e., in the Coulomb gauge and in the long-wavelength limit), clarify their origins, physical interpretations, and consequences, and show under which conditions and for which observables they become relevant. This will also highlight the domain of applicability of common approximations that disregard these quadratic terms and at the same time indicate under which conditions substantial influence can be expected, 12 accessible with ab initio techniques such as quantum-electrodynamic density functional theory (QEDFT). 12,16,22,25,83 Before we do so, let us briefly outline the theory that we will consider and collect a set of fundamental conditions that we deem to be important for a reasonable theoretical description.D riven by substantial experimental progress in the field of cavity-modified chemistry, [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] theoretical methods at the border between quantum-chemical ab initio methods and optics have become the focus of many recent investigations.

        <p>Any theory that we employ to model coupled light-matter systems should obey certain fundamental constraints. Which ones these are often depends on the specific situation being considered. For instance, in the case of high-energy physics, an adherence to special relativity (physical laws should be Lorentzinvariant) is paramount, and hence, the use of Dirac's equation becomes necessary to capture the behavior of electrons. If we further want to ensure that all of the interactions among the electrons are local and our theory should stay invariant under local phase transformations, we find the Maxwell field coupled to Dirac's momentum operator in a linear (minimal) fashion.Any theory that we employ to model coupled light-matter systems should obey certain fundamental constraints.

        <p>However, the resulting theorywhich, if quantized, is called quantum electrodynamics (QED) and perfectly describes highenergy scattering eventshas many subtle issues. 84 For lowenergy physics, a simplified version, where instead of the relativistically invariant momentum the nonrelativistic momentum is employed, has been shown to be able to resolve many of these issues. 73 The resulting theory of nonrelativistic QED (also sometimes called molecular QED 69,72,85,86 ) is ideally suited to describe atoms, molecules, or solids interacting with the quantized light field. [87][88][89] However, the coupling between light and matter is only defined up to a phase, and we need to make a specific choice for this phase, i.e., we need to fix a gauge. Changing the gauge or performing a local unitary transformation should not modify physical observables but merely affect their representation in terms of canonical coordinates. While gauge independence is respected by nonrelativistic QED, this constraint is specifically challenging for dimensionally reduced, simplified models. 15,77,80,82 Besides gauge independence, nonrelativistic QED guarantees a set of further intuitive and essential conditions. For instance, it guarantees that the physical observables are independent of the chosen coordinate system (or, in more quantum-chemical terms, where a specific spatial basis is just one of many basis set choices, basis-setindependent), and it also guarantees the stability of matter, i.e., atoms and molecules are stable if coupled to the vacuum of the electromagnetic field. 73 A direct consequence of this fundamental condition is that the combined ground state of light and matter has a zero transverse electric field expectation value. If this were not the case, the system could emit photons and lower its energy. To summarize, a few basic constraints to which we want a theory of light-matter interactions to adhere are the following: all physical observables should be independent of the gauge choice and the choice of coordinate system (e.g., it would be unphysical that the properties of atoms and molecules would depend on the choice of the origin of the laboratory reference frame); the theory should support stable ground states (or else we could not define equilibrium properties and identify specific atoms and molecules); and the coupled light-matter ground state should have a zero transverse electric field (or else the system would radiate and cascade into lowerenergy states).However, the resulting theorywhich, if quantized, is called quantum electrodynamics (QED) and perfectly describes highenergy scattering eventshas many subtle issues. 84 For lowenergy physics, a simplified version, where instead of the relativistically invariant momentum the nonrelativistic momentum is employed, has been shown to be able to resolve many of these issues. 73 The resulting theory of nonrelativistic QED (also sometimes called molecular QED 69,72,85,86 ) is ideally suited to describe atoms, molecules, or solids interacting with the quantized light field.

The nonrelativistic limit of the minimal coupling procedure therefore naturally leads to the appearance of a quadratic term (see also Fundamental Coupling of Light with Matter and the Emergence of Diamagnetism). This quadratic term provides the diamagnetic shift 93 of the bare modes and introduces a lowest allowed frequency, 94 which then removes the infrared divergence. 73 It is therefore not a drawback to have this term. 74 In contrast, it affects, for instance, optical spectroscopy, 95,96 and it is responsible for diamagnetism 97 and hence implies very important physical processes, such as the famous Meissner effect. Recent theoretical 14,94,98 and experimental 76 studies focused on ultrastrongly coupled light-matter dynamics as well as the prediction of enhanced electronphonon coupling 64,65,99 highlight the non-negligible influence of the collective diamagnetic shift. Let us next for convenience assume linear polarization (i.e., ϵ n,λ = ϵ n,λ * ) and, to connect to the more common formulation, switch to atomic units, such that ϵ 0 = 1/4π, c = 1/α 0 , and the elementary charge (e) is equal to 1. There is a well-known procedure to connect to a Hamiltonian corresponding to the macroscopic Maxwell's equation by employing the unitary Power-Zienau-Woolley (PZW) transformation (see also The Power-Zienau-Wooley Gauge Transformation): where the jth nucleus has the effective positive charge Z j . This implies that all of the physical charges contribute to the bound current, such that j f = 0, ∇•D = ε 0 ∇•E + ∇•P = 0, and therefore D = D ⊥ . However, since the vector potential operator is purely transverse, it also only couples to the transverse part of the polarization operator, which can be expressed in terms of the transverse δ distribution 92 or we use the mode expansion of the vector potential directly. To do so, for notational simplicity we first introduce the abbreviation α ≡ (n, λ), and then we use the fact that the vector-valued functions S n,λ (r) in eq 2 form a basis for the transverse square-integrable vector fields (see Transverse Basis and Distributions).

        <p>The mode expansion provides a consistent regularization such that terms like P ̂⊥ 2 (r) are well-defined, a necessity when multiplying δ distributions (see Transverse Basis and Distributions). This avoids the usual auxiliary assumption that some of these terms, which contribute to the polarization self-energy, are only taken into account perturbatively. 79 It furthermore highlights how the condition of transversality of the Maxwell field also affects matter-only operators like the polarization. So far, the only restriction we have employed is that we have considered nonrelativistic particles. However, this simplification is usually not yet enough to allow for practical calculations. In the following we do not want to consider this more general case but rather assume only dipole interactions. This approximation is very accurate provided that the dominating modes of the photon field have wavelengths that are large compared with the extent of the matter subsystem. In the multipole form of the nonrelativistic QED Hamiltonian this means that we discard the integration over s in our transformation and the polarization operator. 69 The Hamiltonian we then find is the same as the one that we get if we approximate A ̂(r) ≈ A ̂(r matter ) for the bilinear and quadratic coupling terms. This does not restrict the form of the cavity modes itself but merely their spatial extension in relation to the matter subsystem. In practice, where, e.g., an ensemble of molecules interacts with the cavity mode, this simplification can become questionable.

If we consider many photon modes, they give rise to radiative losses, that is, they constitute the photon bath of the matter subsystem into which the excited states can dissipate their energy. 50 Vacuum fluctuations give rise to effects like spontaneous emission, that is, turning the discrete eigenstates of the closed system described by a Schodinger equation into resonances with finite line width. 50 Selecting furthermore only one or a very limited set of modes α will restrict retardation effects and can lead to unphysical superluminal transfer appearing in the (deep) ultrastrong coupling regime. 106 In this work, however, we are not interested in lifetimes but in equilibrium states of the coupled light-matter system. In this case, instead of keeping many modes we can subsume the vacuum photon bath by renormalizing the bare masses m e and M j of the charged particles, i.e., we use the usual physical masses such as m e = 1 in atomic units and keep only a few important modes that are enhanced with respect to the free-space vacuum.Finally, there is one subtle question left.

        <p>As a side remark, we note that although the validity of the dipole approximation for high frequencies is questionable, the quadratic self-polarization term guarantees that the highfrequency photons are essentially decoupled from the matter subsystem. If only a purely linear coupling is assumed, then the UV behavior is completely wrong, as photons with arbitrarily high energies still interact with the matter subsystem. 100 Radiating Eigenstates without Self-Polarization. Let us look at another unphysical feature that appears when the selfpolarization is neglected. In the case of the simple Rabi or Dicke model, where the particle is assumed to be perfectly localized (assuming effectively classical particles), the polarization is zero, and we can associate the expectation values of the modes in the PZW gauge with the electric field. However, if we consider an ab initio treatment, this is no longer the case, and we need to use the correct definition of the electric field given in eq 8. In Figure 5 we show the expectation values of the displacement and the electric field as we increase the number of basis functions. This is again the same as allowing the electrons and nuclei to extend over an ever-increasing spatial region, which is equivalent to exploring the full Hilbert space. Also in these observables we see that the system with the self-polarization term included leads to results that are independent of the simulation box size after roughly 45-50 Å (blue and red solid lines). When the box is extended only slightly to ∼60 Å, the system without the self-polarization disintegrates (blue and red dashed lines). By construction, the system with the self-polarization term always obeys the basic constraint of zero electric field, while the system with only bilinear coupling leads for large extensions to an eigenstate with nonzero electric field.

        <p>Coordinate System and Dipole Dependence without Self-Polarization. The Hamiltonian of eq 5 and its variants guarantee that all of the physical observables in equilibrium are independent of the chosen coordinate system. This is obvious if we have a charge -neutral system, where the Hamiltonian of eq 5 is completely translationally invariant. This constraint is physically very reasonable because without a spatial dependence (i.e., the manifestation of the long-wavelength approximation), the electromagnetic field cannot break the translational symmetry of the bare molecular system. If the system is not charge-neutral, e.g., when we consider only electrons in an external binding potential, we no longer have trivial translational invariance. To see this, consider a shift of the origin of the coordinate system along the polarization of the field such that the total dipole moment operator R ̂is also shifted. It should be noted that this also changes the origin of the cavity, as the longwavelength approximation enforces that all molecules see the same field (of the now also shifted reference point) of the cavity. However, because of the zero-electric-field condition of a physical ground state, we explicitly know that the relation between the (shifted) dipole moment expectation value ⟨R⟩ of the matter subsystem and the expectation values of the displacement fields is 15,25,62 If we then further re-express the light-matter coupling with fluctuation quantities ΔR = R -⟨R⟩ such that eq 6 becomesCoordinate System and Dipole Dependence without Self-Polarization.

        <p>we find that at equilibrium the shifts cancel and the only remaining contribution in the Hamiltonian is given by the fluctuations around the mean values. Indeed, the equilibrium wave function in the new coordinate system is just the original wave function translated in space and the photon subsystem coherently shifted. As a consequence, the light-matter-coupled system is invariant under shifts of the origin in equilibrium, and no physical observable has a dependence on the permanent dipole. The fact that the equilibrium properties of light-matter-coupled systems do not depend on a possible permanent dipole is merely a consequence of how particles couple to the transverse electromagnetic field: only currents can interact with photons. A permanent dipole only shifts the photonic displacement field, which is not a physical observable, and the permanent dipoles of molecules contribute only when the combined system is moved out of equilibrium.we find that at equilibrium the shifts cancel and the only remaining contribution in the Hamiltonian is given by the fluctuations around the mean values.

        <p>Only when the self-polarization term is neglected can an unphysical dependence on the permanent dipole in equilibrium arise. To illustrate that even for small systems and shifts this can have a large influence, we consider the Shin-Metiu model from before, but we slightly charge the complete system by using Z = +1.05e. We then perform a small shift x → x + μ in the coordinate system, solve the corresponding Shin-Metiu model, determine the ground-state electron density n e μ (x), and then translate back to obtain n e μ (x -μ) and compare it with the original (unshifted) solution n e (x).Only when the self-polarization term is neglected can an unphysical dependence on the permanent dipole in equilibrium arise.

        <p>As expected, when the self-polarization is included, we just recover the old density, and n e μ (x -μ)n e (x) ≡ 0. In contrast, in Figure 7 we show the differences without the self-polarization and find an ever-increasing difference for larger μ (increasing permanent dipole moment). The behavior of the Shin-Metiu model without the self-polarization is clearly unphysical, since observables should not depend on the coordinate system. Any approximate method tailored to perform self-consistent calculations should respect the above coordinate-system independence by retaining the balance between bilinear and quadratic contributions. Consider for example the performance of the nonvariational Krieger-Li-Iafrate approximation for ab initio QEDFT presented in ref 16, which breaks this balance.As expected, when the self-polarization is included, we just recover the old density, and n e μ (x -μ)n e (x) ≡ 0.

        <p>Collectivity, the Limit of the Dicke Model, and Plasmonic Systems. When considering a system of several molecules, we can separate their instantaneous interactions mediated by longitudinal and transverse polarization fields (in the PZW gauge) by ∫ d 3 r P 2 = ∫ d 3 r P ̂∥ 2 + P ̂⊥ 2 . Here the first term on the right-hand side corresponds to the Coulomb interaction, and the second term corresponds to the self-polarization contribution. 85 We can further approximately distinguish between situations where the wave functions of the different constituents overlap strongly and situations where there is no strong overlap. The former situation, often termed intramolecular, demands careful consideration of the Coulomb and self-polarization contributions simultaneously, where the Coulomb contribution dominates in most situations. The latter situation of contact-free interactions between matter subsystems, termed intermolecular, leads to a perturbative (dipolar approximation) cancellation of instantaneous interactions such that ∫ d 3 r P ̂A•P ̂B ≈ 0, and we are left approximately with purely bilinear and retarded interactions between those separated matter subsystems. 112 This situation, however, does not allow longitudinal or transverse interactions to be neglected when calculations are performed locally for one of the subsystems. A consistent calculation considering, for example, molecular rearrangements during chemical reactions due to the influence of cavity-mediated strong light-matter coupling will thus also demand a consistent treatment of Coulomb and self-polarization contributions.Collectivity, the Limit of the Dicke Model, and Plasmonic Systems.

        <p>If we now enter into the realm where instantaneous contributions to the intermolecular interaction cancel, it is often instructive to assume that indeed the local (i.e., subsystem) eigenstates are not affected by intermolecular interactions and do not need to be updated during the process. In this case we can perform the pinned-dipole approximation, which implies that each subsystem is localized at a specific position and distinguishable. Starting from eq 5, we can then recover the Dicke model by absorbing the self-polarization contribution perturbatively by renormalizing the mass of the particles (similar to the perturbative treatment of the Lamb shift) such that the effective interaction reduces to the common bilinear coupling. 72 In the case of the pinned-dipole approximation, the bilinear coupling to the displacement field becomes equivalent to a coupling to the electric fields since the local polarization in E ̂⊥ = 4π(D ̂⊥ -P ̂⊥) is zero by construction. To assume that the quantum subsystems are perfectly localized and distinguishable is in stark contrast to an ab initio quantum-mechanical description of molecules. Thus, applying the Dicke model to deduce the influence of strong coupling on the local molecular states calls for a very careful analysis of all of the applied approximations and their consequences. It furthermore permits physical features such as when charge distributions start to overlap, as is often the case in quantum-chemical calculations, leading to a dependence of the local observables on the surrounding (collective) ensemble. 16 The occurrence of quadratic (i.e., Debye-Waller) terms in the electron-nuclear coupling highlights how general quadratic components are in a nonrelativistic theory. More closely connected to our current situation is the coupling to modes of a plasmonic environment. In principle, if we describe the plasmonic environment as part of the full system, 113,114 the density oscillations of the plasmonic environment are captured in an ab initio description by the Coulomb interaction and the induced transverse photon field, and hence, eq 5 is directly applicable. Let us assume, however, that we are not interested in a self-consistent calculation, can safely disregard contact terms (i.e., ∫ d 3 r P ̂A•P ̂B = 0), and rather care about perturbative corrections. This consideration will lead to van der Waals (dipole-dipole)-type interactions with different scalings in terms of their intermolecular distance R AB , independent of the choice of Coulomb or PZW gauge. 72 The consideration of large distances subject to significant retardation is described by attractive Casimir-Polder interactions, 115,116 which scale as -R ( ) AB 7 . For smaller R AB , retardation might be omitted, and we would enter the realm of instantaneous attractive interactions captured by the London dispersion potential, which scale as -R ( ) AB 6 . While those considerations are well-tested and allow for excellent perturbative results, they would not allow a selfconsistent calculation, as these forces would merely result in a collapse of the wave function onto a singular point because of its unbalanced attraction. Assuming for instance a set of harmonic oscillators describing the plasmonic excitations coupled merely bilinearly to the system of interest would introduce divergent forces proportional to -∑ α λ α (λ α •R). 15 The Coulomb potential, wave function overlap, and the Pauli principle give rise to repulsive components for small R AB , modeled for example by the empirical -R ( ) AB 12 term of the Lennard-Jones potential or the -(e ) R AB term of the Buckingham potential. It is therefore the higher-order components that ensure the stability of matter. A self-consistent treatment of molecules in a plasmonic cavity, which itself is modeled as, e.g., a simple harmonic oscillator, 40,117 thus needs to include higher-order couplings to describe a stable and physical system. Self-consistent calculations would therefore demand extending the quasistatic approximation [118][119][120] for plasmonic systems such that the plasmonic cluster responds to Figure 7.

In the Shin-Metiu model, the charge of the moving nucleus was slightly increased to Z = +1.05, and electronic and nuclear box sizes of 59.27 and 5.93 Å, respectively, were chosen (i.e., before any scattering states appear). All of the other parameter values remained as before. the coupled molecule. This is precisely the physical origin of the quadratic terms in QED, which allow the photonic or matter system to respond to the coupling by adjusting their excitation energies. For instance, the A ̂2 part can be subsumed into adjusted mode frequencies and further defines a minimal frequency (i.e., cures the infrared divergence), while the P ̂⊥ 2 term renormalizes the energies of the material, all within the longwavelength approximation. The very same effects should be present for a plasmonic cavity when consistently quantized. Such effects are already observed when ab initio calculations are performed with solely the longitudinal Coulomb interaction. 114 For small clusters, and therefore a small effective volume and high coupling strength, the modification of the response and volume due to the presence of the coupled molecule is nonnegligible and modifies the plasmonic modes of the cluster. A purely bilinear coupling dictates entirely different physics (see Spectral Features of Operators for a detailed discussion), violates all of the aforementioned basic constraints, and leaves such a simplification as inherently perturbative.

        <p>When looking beyond the simple Rabi splitting of spectral lines, which is the accepted indicator of the onset of strong coupling, other observables that contain further information about the matter subsystem should be able to highlight the necessity to modify the common Dicke or Rabi models, e.g., as demonstrated in ref 76. By consideration of photonic and matter observables at the same time, the dipole-approximated bilinear coupling can be further scrutinized, the influence of quadratic coupling terms can be revealed, and effects that are due to spatially inhomogeneous fields (beyond the long-wavelength approximation) can be observed. Furthermore, when the lightmatter coupling causes bilinear, self-polarization, and Coulomb interactions to act on comparable energy scales, nonperturbative effects can be expected. At this point it is important to realize that this statement also holds spatially, i.e., that while a coupling might be considered small for certain bond lengths/extensions of the molecular system, at other parts or on other scales it might become substantial. The extension criterion (eq 11), which weighs the divergent forces (which increase with increasing spatial extension) against the ionization energy, is motivated precisely with this spirit in mind, providing the g/ω complementing parameter estimate. Consider for example the binding curve of a molecule. Probing the dissociative regime at large distances will change the ratio of the aforementioned contributions until van der Waals-type interactions containing retardation effects have to be considered, a problem that is also of chemical interest. 125 Not just the equilibrium distance of molecules will change, but especially their behavior in the stretched configuration will be affected, 13,14 a feature essential to describe chemical reactions. For relatively large systems, which are yet still small compared with the relevant wavelengths of the photon field, stronger effects would be expected. In the simple models presented here, we could have used a smaller coupling strength yet a spatially more extended system, and we would have found similar effects. Dynamics that probes the long-range part of potential energy surfaces should be affected more strongly, and this is especially true compared with dynamics due to classical external laser fields in the dipole approximation ignoring the self-polarization term. While our focus remained on the single-molecule limit, an additional essential scale of the system is represented by the number of charge carriers, amplifying the dipole moment, polarizability, and therefore the self-polarization contribution. Extended systems (e.g., solids and liquids) and molecular ensembles with charge contact (e.g., biomolecules) are therefore expected to experience quite sizable influences by quadratic components, i.e., perturbatively seen renormalizing photonic or matter excitations due to the collective light-matter interaction. 15,62,75 Recent investigations of cavity-enhanced electron-phonon coupling 64,65 and its role for superconductivity 99 might indicate the substantial scientific impact of this realization. Exploring these situations where our theoretical descriptions begin to differ strongly thus holds promise to reveal further yet undiscovered effects. 12When looking beyond the simple Rabi splitting of spectral lines, which is the accepted indicator of the onset of strong coupling, other observables that contain further information about the matter subsystem should be able to highlight the necessity to modify the common Dicke or Rabi models, e.g., as demonstrated in ref 76.

In the simple models presented here, we could have used a smaller coupling strength yet a spatially more extended system, and we would have found similar effects. Dynamics that probes the long-range part of potential energy surfaces should be affected more strongly, and this is especially true compared with dynamics due to classical external laser fields in the dipole approximation ignoring the self-polarization term. While our focus remained on the single-molecule limit, an additional essential scale of the system is represented by the number of charge carriers, amplifying the dipole moment, polarizability, and therefore the self-polarization contribution. Extended systems (e.g., solids and liquids) and molecular ensembles with charge contact (e.g., biomolecules) are therefore expected to experience quite sizable influences by quadratic components, i.e., perturbatively seen renormalizing photonic or matter excitations due to the collective light-matter interaction. 15,62,75 Recent investigations of cavity-enhanced electron-phonon coupling 64,65 and its role for superconductivity 99 might indicate the substantial scientific impact of this realization. Exploring these situations where our theoretical descriptions begin to differ strongly thus holds promise to reveal further yet undiscovered effects. 12</p>

        <p>We have therefore divided the interaction due to coupling with a charge current into purely longitudinal (electrostatic) and purely transverse ones.

        <p>This clear procedure holds true if we consider QED with Dirac particles and thus the Dirac current. However, if we take the nonrelativistic limit for the particles and thus also for the conserved charge current, a subtlety arises with important consequences. When the positronic degrees of freedom are expressed to first order in 1/mc 2 in terms of the electronic components, a term that is quadratic in the vector potential appears. 25,126 This means that in eq 15, if we use the conserved current j(r, t) = j p (r, t) + j d (r, t) that consists of the paramagnetic current j p plus the diamagnetic current j d , 97 a correction term of the formThis clear procedure holds true if we consider QED with Dirac particles and thus the Dirac current.

However, in practice often only one of the two interactions is treated explicitly, depending on which properties of the combined light-matter system are of interest. 12 Focusing on quantum mechanics (e.g., on the electronic structure, as is essential to describe chemical reactions), the transverse interaction is often omitted, and one merely implicitly considers the fluctuations in form of the physical mass. 15,73 Quantumoptical considerations on the other hand typically focus on the description of the transverse fields and thus strongly simplify the ACS Photonics pubs.acs.org/journal/apchd5 electronic structure.

        <p>Under certain assumptions, the diamagnetic term can indeed be absorbed by a redefinition of the frequencies and polarizations of the field modes. 15,75,93,94 These redefinitions depend on the matter subsystem (more specifically the number of charged particles) and lead to a diamagnetic shift of the photon field, which can be observed experimentally. 98,127,128 Since the difference between the bare and diamagnetically dressed photonic quantities goes as N V / , where N is the total number of particles and V is the quantization volume, it is often argued 93 that one can use the bare quantities for finite systems. This is not entirely correct. The same argument would predict that the coupling between light and matter (see eq 7) would be zero. The reason for nonzero coupling lies in the fact that as the quantization volume becomes larger (approaching free space), the number of modes in any frequency interval approaches infinity as well. Thus, while the coupling to an individual mode indeed becomes zero, the coupling to the continuum of modes is nonzero. Therefore, when we keep individual modes in our theoretical description, we effectively treat a small but finite frequency interval of modes. This frequency interval can be related to the effective mode volume, since it gives the spacing between the effective modes. Consequently, we also need to dress the photon operators diamagnetically.Under certain assumptions, the diamagnetic term can indeed be absorbed by a redefinition of the frequencies and polarizations of the field modes. 15,75,93,94 These redefinitions depend on the matter subsystem (more specifically the number of charged particles) and lead to a diamagnetic shift of the photon field, which can be observed experimentally. 98,127,128 Since the difference between the bare and diamagnetically dressed photonic quantities goes as N V / , where N is the total number of particles and V is the quantization volume, it is often argued 93 that one can use the bare quantities for finite systems.

        <p>While here we performed the unitary PZW transformation after choosing the Coulomb gauge quantization, which leaves the vector potential operator invariant but leads to an adjusted photon field momentum and coupling, one can equivalently use the PZW (multipolar) gauge of the field to perform the quantization procedure. 68 This gauge is connected to the Coulomb gauge by an adjustment of the phase of each particle by θ(r) = -qα 0 ∫ 0 1 r•A(sr) ds. 68 This extra phase removes the explicit diamagnetic component from the physical current but also assigns a longitudinal component to the vector potential that can be associated with the Coulomb interaction. While the PZW gauge features purely transverse light-matter coupling, similar to the Coulomb gauge, it mixes light and matter degrees of freedom in accordance with the macroscopic Maxwell's equations. [66][67][68]79,85 Transverse Basis and Distributions For an arbitrary cavity geometry, the vector-valued eigenfunctions can be very complicated, deviating from simple plane waves. Still, this basis S α (r) is assumed to obey the condition ∇•S α (r) = 0. In this case, we need to perform the mode expansion of the vector potential operator and the polarization operator with the corresponding modes. Selecting a basis defined the representation of the δ distribution and the according polarization. It is important to note that while there are many equivalent representations of the δ distribution, e.g., by using different basis sets S α (r), multiplications of distributions are not uniquely defined. 129,130 Indeed, the origin of the divergence in quantum field theories stems from the fact that (operator-valued) distributions are multiplied 131 and a regularization and renormalization procedure needs to be employed to give a finite answer. The usual method of regularization is equivalent to introducing a cutoff in the mode expansion α, and hence, by keeping this explicit instead of working with an unspecified representation of the δ distribution we avoid nonuniqueness problems. 79 We could straightaway also use the full infinite space, 73 but this would just make the notation unnecessarily complicated, as the above Hamiltonian converges in the norm-resolvent sense to the infinite-space Hamiltonian for M p → ∞. 132 Hence, the above Hamiltonian can be made equivalent to the full infinite-space Hamiltonian if we increase the quantization volume.While here we performed the unitary PZW transformation after choosing the Coulomb gauge quantization, which leaves the vector potential operator invariant but leads to an adjusted photon field momentum and coupling, one can equivalently use the PZW (multipolar) gauge of the field to perform the quantization procedure. 68 This gauge is connected to the Coulomb gauge by an adjustment of the phase of each particle by θ(r) = -qα 0 ∫ 0 1 r•A(sr) ds. 68 This extra phase removes the explicit diamagnetic component from the physical current but also assigns a longitudinal component to the vector potential that can be associated with the Coulomb interaction.

        <p>Most arguments for performing a multipole expansion for a Hamiltonian are based on perturbation theory, where local properties derived from a fixed wave function only slightly depend on higher-order contributions of a perturbing operator. 72 However, this does not mean that such arguments still apply for nonperturbative considerations, i.e., when the operator itself is changed and we solve the resulting equation self-consistently. Indeed, if we consider the influence of such expansions on the Hamiltonian directly, the opposite is usually true: the highest-order terms determine all of the basic properties. An instructive example is a one-dimensional model atom with H ̂= -∂ x 2 /2 + v(x), where v(x) is some binding potential centered at x = 0 with v(x) → 0 for x → ∞. Its spectrum as a self-adjoint operator in L ( ) 2  contains both bound states (eigenfunctions exponentially localized around x = 0) and scattering states (distributional eigenfunctions corresponding to the continuous spectrum). In such cases, a harmonic approximation for certain ground-state properties, v(x) ≈ v(0) + v′(0)x + v″(0)x 2 /2, is reasonable (assuming v″(0) &gt; 0), and the perturbative influence of higher-order terms proportional to x n with n &gt; 2 is minor. However, if we consider the actual Hamiltonian and treat higher-order terms proportional to x n nonperturbatively in L ( ) 2  , we see that either we have an operator that is unbounded from below (having no ground state) with a purely continuous spectrum (no eigenfunctions but only scattering states) for odd n 62 or bounded from below with only bound states for even n (again assuming that all v (n) (0) &gt; 0). Thus, all of the basic properties are determined only by the highest order of n. We therefore find that an expansion of an operator becomes meaningful only if we also indicate whether we consider it perturbatively for a fixed wave function or nonperturbatively. In this work, we focus on the nonperturbative situation. Let us also mention that as an alternative to perturbation theory, a nonperturbative consideration but on a different Hilbert space of a restricted domain ϑ ⊂ 3  becomes possible, i.e., we consider the operators on L 2 (ϑ) with appropriate boundary conditions or on a restricted state space {Ψ Ψ} ⊂ L , ..., ( ) r 1 2  . As illustrated in Necessity and Implications of Quadratic Couplings in the Dipole Approximation, this will render the restricted domain or subset a relevant parameter for the theoretical prediction since the physical properties can then crucially depend on this parameter.Most arguments for performing a multipole expansion for a Hamiltonian are based on perturbation theory, where local properties derived from a fixed wave function only slightly depend on higher-order contributions of a perturbing operator. 72 However, this does not mean that such arguments still apply for nonperturbative considerations, i.e., when the operator itself is changed and we solve the resulting equation self-consistently.
