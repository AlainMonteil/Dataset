        <p>We analyse FIR dust continuum measurements for 14 galaxies (redshift z ≈ 7) in the ALMA Reionization Era Bright Emission Line Surv e y (REBELS) Large Program to derive their physical properties. Our model uses three input data, i.e. (a) the UV spectral slope, β, (b) the observed UV continuum flux at 1500 Å, F 1500 , (c) the observed continuum flux at ≈ 158 μm, F 158 , and considers Milky Way (MW) and SMC extinction curves, along with different dust geometries. We find that REBELS galaxies have 28 -90.5 per cent of their star formation obscured; the total (UV + IR) star formation rates are in the range 31 . 5 &lt; SFR / (M yr -1 ) &lt; 129 . 5. The sample-averaged dust mass and temperature are (1 . 3 ± 1 . 1) × 10 7 M and 52 ± 11 K, respecti vely. Ho we ver, in some galaxies dust is particularly abundant (REBELS-14, M d ≈ 3 . 4 × 10 7 M ), or hot (REBELS-18, T d ≈ 67 K). The dust distribution is compact ( &lt; 0.3 kpc for 70 per cent of the galaxies). The inferred dust yield per supernova is 0 . 1 ≤ y d / M ≤ 3 . 3, with 70 per cent of the galaxies requiring y d &lt; 0 . 25 M . Three galaxies (REBELS-12, 14, 39) require y d &gt; 1 M , which is likely inconsistent with pure SN production, and might require dust growth via accretion of heavy elements from the interstellar medium. With the SFR predicted by the model and a MW extinction curve, REBELS galaxies detected in [C II ] nicely follow the local L CII -SFR relation, and are approximately located on the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. The sample-averaged gas depletion time is 0 . 11 y -2 P Gyr, where y P is the ratio of the gas-to-stellar distribution radius. For some systems, a solution simultaneously matching the observed ( β, F 1500 , F 158 ) values cannot be found. This occurs when the index I m = ( F 158 / F 1500 )/( ββ int ), where β int is the intrinsic UV slope, exceeds I * m ≈ 1120 for an MW curve. For these objects, we argue that the FIR and UV emitting regions are not co-spatial, questioning the use of the IRX-β relation.We analyse FIR dust continuum measurements for 14 galaxies (redshift z ≈ 7) in the ALMA Reionization Era Bright Emission Line Surv e y (REBELS) Large Program to derive their physical properties.

        <p>These combined efforts were amazingly successful, and they have allowed to build the UV and Ly α luminosity functions (LF) of EoR galaxies down to very faint magnitudes. For example, at z 7 the UV LF is now sampled o v er about 8 mag in the range -22.6 &lt; M UV &lt; -14.5 (Ono et al. 2018 ). These observations used a combination of space-born surv e ys using HST (Oesch et al. 2010 ;McLure et al. 2013 ;Bouwens et al. 2014 ), in some cases exploiting gravitational lensing of massive galaxy clusters, such as the Hubble Frontier Fields (Livermore, Finkelstein &amp; Lotz 2017 ;Lotz et al. 2017 ;Ishigaki et al. 2018 ;Bhatawdekar &amp; Conselice 2021 ) and other similar programmes such as RELICS (Salmon et al. 2018 ), and ground telescopes (Bowler et al. 2015 ;Bouwens et al. 2016 ). A full description of the development in the field along with the theoretical implications can be found in Dayal &amp; Ferrara ( 2018 ). A comprehensi ve re vie w of the present knowledge of the LF up to z = 9 is given in Bouwens et al. ( 2021a ), Oesch et al. ( 2018 ), and Bowler et al.

This is because to a first approximation, and for a fixed dust yield, the dust mass is expected to be proportional to the stellar mass.Indeed, if dust is present already at these very early cosmic epochs, its effects are expected to be more evident on the most massive galaxies.

        <p>The presence of sizeable amounts of dust has a strong impact on galaxy evolution. Dust go v erns the interstellar medium (ISM) thermal balance (Draine 2003 ;Galliano, Galametz &amp; Jones 2018 ) by providing photoelectric heating, it controls important chemical processes such as the formation of H 2 (Tielens 2010 ), which in turn drives molecular chemistry. Thus, determining the dust content of EoR galaxies is crucial to interpret observations (Mancini et al. 2016 ;Behrens et al. 2018 ;Wilkins et al. 2018 ;Arata et al. 2019 ;Vogelsberger et al. 2020 ;Inoue et al. 2020 ;Di Mascia et al. 2021a , b ;Shen et al. 2021 ), and build a coherent picture of early galaxy formation.The presence of sizeable amounts of dust has a strong impact on galaxy evolution.

        <p>Grains absorb the stellar UV light and re-radiate it in the infrared, shielding the dense gas, ultimately triggering the formation of molecular clouds where new stars are born.

Combining UV and IR observations is then fundamental to constrain the dust content and, even more crucially, the optical and physical properties of the grains, such as their temperature, size distribution, and composition (Draine 2003 ).Grains absorb the stellar UV light and re-radiate it in the infrared, shielding the dense gas, ultimately triggering the formation of molecular clouds where new stars are born.

        <p>In the last few years ALMA observations (Watson et al. 2015 ;Laporte et al. 2017 ;Hashimoto et al. 2019 ;Bakx et al. 2020 ;Faisst et al. 2020 ; Hodge &amp; da Cunha 2020 ; Gruppioni et al. 2020 ;Schouws et al. 2021 ;Bakx et al. 2021 ) have detected dust thermal emission in 'normal' galaxies2 well into the EoR ( z ≈ 7). The copious IR continuum emission from these early galaxies came, at least partly, as a surprise. Naively, a common expectation was that these remote galaxies are lo w-metallicity, lo w-dust content systems, although some highresolution simulations have suggested that enrichment could be very fast, particularly close to star-forming regions (Behrens et al. 2018 ;Wilkins et al. 2018 ;Pallottini et al. 2019 ;Graziani et al. 2020 ).In the last few years ALMA observations (Watson et al. 2015 ;Laporte et al. 2017 ;Hashimoto et al. 2019 ;Bakx et al. 2020 ;Faisst et al. 2020 ; Hodge &amp; da Cunha 2020 ; Gruppioni et al. 2020 ;Schouws et al. 2021 ;Bakx et al. 2021 ) have detected dust thermal emission in 'normal' galaxies2 well into the EoR ( z ≈ 7).

        <p>The dust mass of detected EoR galaxies remains nevertheless uncertain, due to the de generac y with dust temperature; estimates are in the range of 10 6 -8 M . Interestingly, a quasi-linear, global redshift evolution of the dust temperature is suggested by some studies (Magdis et al. 2012 ;Schreiber et al. 2018 ;Bethermin et al. 2020 ;Faisst et al. 2020 ). Ho we ver, the errors in the existing data are large and do not allow to draw firm conclusions yet. 3 A statistically significant sample of EoR galaxies is a precondition to assess the existence and physical nature of the relation.The dust mass of detected EoR galaxies remains nevertheless uncertain, due to the de generac y with dust temperature; estimates are in the range of 10 6 -8 M .

        <p>The method uses as an input three quantities (in addition to the source redshift z s ) measured by REBELS: (a) the UV spectral slope, β, such that the specific luminosity L λ ∝ λ β in the wavelength range of 1600-2500 Å; (b) the observed UV continuum flux, F 1500 at 1500 Å, (c) the observed far-infrared continuum flux, F 158 , at ≈ 158 μm; we e xpress flux es in units of μJy. These data are presently available for 14 galaxies 4 in the REBELS sample, whose mean redshift is z s = 7.01. A summary of the rele v ant data for the galaxy in the sample is given in Table 1 . Although our model does not make predictions on the stellar mass, in the table we also report the M * values obtained by the REBELS Collaboration (Stefanon + 21, in preparation) from rest-frame UV SED fitting 5 using 
            <rs type="software">BEAGLE</rs> (Che v allard &amp; Charlot 2016 ). These are only used to check the consistency of the dust SN yield, y d , reported in the penultimate column of Tables 2 and3 .

        <p>Before we proceed it is necessary to define L λ , for which we rely on the stellar population synthesis code 
            <rs type="software">STARBURST</rs>99 (Leitherer et al. 1999 ). We assume (a) continuous star formation, (b) Salpeter initial mass function in the range of 1 -100 M , (c) metallicity Z = 0.004; all quantities below are computed at a fixed age of 150 Myr. The models adopt Gene v a stellar tracks including the early AGB evolution up to the first thermal pulse for masses &gt; 1 . 7 M . For later use, this IMF produces ν SN = (52 . 89 M ) -1 supernovae (SN) per unit stellar mass formed.

We warn that using non-parametric prescriptions for the star formation history might result in M * values on average up to ≈3 × higher (Topping et al. in preparation). 6 The choice of the Salpeter IMF is moti v ated by consistency with the standard conversion from specific UV luminosity to SFR SFR [M yr -1 ] = 1 . 4 × 10 -28 L ν (1500 Å) [ erg s -1 Hz -1 ] typically used by high-z surv e ys (e.g. Oesch et al. 2014 ) which is based on such IMF (Kennicutt 1998 ;Madau &amp; Dickinson 2014 ). Written in this form, the numerical factor corresponding to our K 1500 is equi v alent to 4.45 × 10 -29 ; the ≈3 × difference arises from the subsolar ( Z = 0.004) metallicity assumed here.</p>

        <p>Our model also constrains dust properties. The 10 systems for which a solution can be found all contain considerable amounts of dust at luk e-w arm temperatures. The sample-averaged dust mass and temperature are (1 . 3 ± 1 . 1) × 10 7 M and 52 ± 11 K, respectively. Ho we ver, in some galaxies, dust is particularly abundant (REBELS-14, M d ≈ 3 . 4 × 10 7 M ), or hot (REBELS-18, T d ≈ 67 K). The dust distribution is compact as one can infer from the values of r d . These are all sub-kpc, with 70 per cent of the galaxies showing r d &lt; 0.3 kpc. Such compact configuration, in general, produces high dust temperatures: the hottest REBELS-18 indeed is the most compact one with only 5 × 10 6 M of dust concentrated in a very small region ( r d = 0.16 kpc). As a caveat, we note that the implied compactness might partly be due to the adopted geometry, such that actual observed sizes could be larger if the dust/starlight are more inhomogenously distributed.Our model also constrains dust properties.

        <p>Finally, by using the stellar mass, M * , obtained by the REBELS Collaboration from SED fitting, we estimate the dust yield per supernova, 15 y d = M d /ν SN M * . Although this is not a self-consistent output , as it uses an independent estimate of M * , it nevertheless represents a useful reference. We find 0.1 ≤ y d /M ≤ 3.3 with a mean value y d = 0 . 9 M with 7 (out of 10) galaxies requiring y d &lt; 0 . 25 M . As already mentioned in Section 2 , stellar masses determined assuming a non-parametric star formation history might be on average a factor of ≈3 larger. In this case, the SN yield would be correspondingly decreased to 0.03 ≤ y d /M ≤ 1.1. Such dust yield range is in good agreement with available estimates (Todini &amp; Ferrara 2001 ;Hirashita et al. 2015 ;Marassi et al. 2015Marassi et al. , 2019 ; ;Gall &amp; Hjorth 2018 ; Le śniewska &amp; Michałowski 2019 ), which typically indicate y d = 0 . 01 -0 . 45 M (for a re vie w, see Cherchnef f 2014 ).

Ho we ver, three galaxies (REBELS-12, 14, 39) require y d &gt; 1 M , which is likely inconsistent with pure SN production, and might require dust growth via accretion of heavy elements from the ISM (e.g. Mancini et al. 2015 ;Popping, Somerville &amp; Galametz 2017 ;Graziani et al. 2020 ).Finally, by using the stellar mass, M * , obtained by the REBELS Collaboration from SED fitting, we estimate the dust yield per supernova, 15 y d = M d /ν SN M * .

        <p>Let us now consider the spherical case. The key difference between the two cases is due to the fact that, for a giv en e xtinction curv e, spherical geometries are more opaque (see Fig. 1 ).

        <p>The differences between the slab and spherical geometries are minor.

        <p>Using the model results, we can also investigate whether REBELS galaxies are starbursting. To quantify this statement, we follow Ferrara et al. ( 2019 ) and introduce the 'burstiness' parameter κ s , accounting for upward deviations from the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) average relation17 (e.g. Heiderman et al. 2010Using the model results, we can also investigate whether REBELS galaxies are starbursting.

        <p>Galaxies with κ s &gt; 1 show a larger SFR per unit area with respect to those located on the KS relation having the same value of g , i.e. they tend to be starburst. Values of up to κ s = 100 have been measured for submillimetre galaxies, e.g. Hodge et al. ( 2015 ) and Vallini et al. ( 2021 ). To compute κ s from equation ( 22), we need two additional quantities: (a) the radius of the stellar, r * , and gas, r g , distribution and (b) the gas mass, M g . For the former, we assume r g = y P r * = y P r d where y P , referred to as the Perito ratio after Carniani et al. ( 2018 ), is a factor of 1. The previous equalities are inspired by the empirical evidence that in high-z g alaxies, the g as (traced by [C II ] emission) is more extended than the dust/stellar emitting regions which instead show a similar size (Fujimoto et al. 2019(Fujimoto et al. , 2020 ; ;Carniani et al. 2020 ;Ginolfi et al. 2020 ). These studies suggest that y P ≈ 2; we adopt this value here, but note that the κ s values shown in Fig. 5 can be easily scaled to other y P choices recalling that, from equation ( 22) and the ] luminosity as a function of the predicted SFR for nine REBELS galaxies (red points) for an MW extinction curve and slab geometry; the L C II values and errors are measured by the REBELS surv e y. Among the 10 galaxies with a solution, REBELS-06 is undetected in [C II ] and therefore does not appear in the plot. The REBELS galaxies ( z ≈ 7) closely follow the local starburst relation (De Looze et al. 2014 , aqua band). Also shown for completeness is the ALPINE (Schaerer et al. 2020 , orange dashed) relation for 4.4 &lt; z &lt; 5.9 galaxies. For each galaxy, we give the corresponding burstiness parameter, κ s , value (purple) quantifying the upward deviation from the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation (equation 22 with y P = 2) Right: Same as left-hand panel, for an SMC curve and slab geometry. In this case, the REBELS galaxies appear to be off and above the relation. relation r g = y P r * , κ s ∝ y 2 m P = y 2 . 8 P . We then use r * and r g to write SFR = SFR / πr 2 * , and g = M g / πr 2 g . This leads us to the final step, i.e. the determination of the gas mass which is deduced from the predicted dust mass: M g = M d /D, where D is the dust-to-gas ratio18 for Z = 0.004. The derived κ s values are shown in Fig. 5 by the numbers close to each galaxy point, and reported in Tables 2 and3 for all cases. For the MW, we find 0.9 &lt; κ s &lt; 18.8, with most actively star forming systems showing larger deviations from the KS relation (i.e. they have larger κ s values). On this basis, we conclude that REBELS galaxies, in addition to the L CII -SFR relation, approximately follow the KS one as well, although a few appear to be relatively bursty (as e.g. REBELS-18, κ s = 18.8). This conclusion holds also for the SMC extinction curve: in fact, we find 0.9 &lt; κ s &lt; 3.3.Galaxies with κ s &gt; 1 show a larger SFR per unit area with respect to those located on the KS relation having the same value of g , i.e. they tend to be starburst.

For the former, we assume r g = y P r * = y P r d where y P , referred to as the Perito ratio after Carniani et al. ( 2018 ), is a factor of 1. The previous equalities are inspired by the empirical evidence that in high-z g alaxies, the g as (traced by [C II ] emission) is more extended than the dust/stellar emitting regions which instead show a similar size (Fujimoto et al. 2019(Fujimoto et al. , 2020 ; ;Carniani et al. 2020 ;Ginolfi et al. 2020 ). These studies suggest that y P ≈ 2; we adopt this value here, but note that the κ s values shown in Fig. 5 can be easily scaled to other y P choices recalling that, from equation ( 22) and the ] luminosity as a function of the predicted SFR for nine REBELS galaxies (red points) for an MW extinction curve and slab geometry; the L C II values and errors are measured by the REBELS surv e y. Among the 10 galaxies with a solution, REBELS-06 is undetected in [C II ] and therefore does not appear in the plot. The REBELS galaxies ( z ≈ 7) closely follow the local starburst relation (De Looze et al. 2014 , aqua band). Also shown for completeness is the ALPINE (Schaerer et al. 2020 , orange dashed) relation for 4.4 &lt; z &lt; 5.9 galaxies. For each galaxy, we give the corresponding burstiness parameter, κ s , value (purple) quantifying the upward deviation from the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation (equation 22 with y P = 2) Right: Same as left-hand panel, for an SMC curve and slab geometry. In this case, the REBELS galaxies appear to be off and above the relation. relation r g = y P r * , κ s ∝ y 2 m P = y 2 . 8 P . We then use r * and r g to write SFR = SFR / πr 2 * , and g = M g / πr 2 g . This leads us to the final step, i.e. the determination of the gas mass which is deduced from the predicted dust mass: M g = M d /D, where D is the dust-to-gas ratio18 for Z = 0.004. The derived κ s values are shown in Fig. 5 by the numbers close to each galaxy point, and reported in Tables 2 and3 for all cases. For the MW, we find 0.9 &lt; κ s &lt; 18.8, with most actively star forming systems showing larger deviations from the KS relation (i.e. they have larger κ s values). On this basis, we conclude that REBELS galaxies, in addition to the L CII -SFR relation, approximately follow the KS one as well, although a few appear to be relatively bursty (as e.g. REBELS-18, κ s = 18.8). This conclusion holds also for the SMC extinction curve: in fact, we find 0.9 &lt; κ s &lt; 3.3.</p>

Ho we ver, increasing M d while keeping ( ββ int ) (i.e. the ef fecti ve optical depth) low 20 implies pushing the dust temperatures to values progressively closer to the CMB, thus preventing F 158 , and hence I m , to increase beyond I * m . These findings are confirmed by the results reported in the tables. Indeed, for the MW case, the no-solution galaxies all have I m &gt; 1183.</p>
        <p>We conclude that I m &gt; I * m values can be achieved only if the FIR luminosity is spatially decoupled from the UV emitting regions. In such a scenario, the former is produced in optically thick, starforming clumps (likely, giant molecular comple x es), and produce the high F 158 values required. The small UV optical depth is produced instead by the diffuse, interclump gas component in which young stars are embedded after they disperse their natal cloud. This twophase configuration should then characterize no-solution galaxies.We conclude that I m &gt; I * m values can be achieved only if the FIR luminosity is spatially decoupled from the UV emitting regions.

        <p>We speculate that no-solution galaxies are extreme Class II systems, as defined in Section 3.3 , which have developed a prominent two-phase ISM structure with spatially se gre gated IR and UV emitting regions throughout their disc. This hypothesis is supported by Fig. 6 , showing the continuum and [C II ] emission, along with the rest-frame UV image of REBELS-19, a no-solution case. The spatial displacement between the continuum and UV emission is clearly visible. Once observed at higher spatial resolution, other REBELS no-solution galaxies might show a similar spatially decoupled structure. As a final caveat, we note that the abo v e scenario questions the use of the IRX-β relation, which implicitly assumes that the IR and UV emission are co-spatial.

        <p>The results are summarized in Tables 2 and3 for the MW and SMC curv es, respectiv ely, and for different dust/stellar relative geometries. They are also graphically shown in Fig. 4 . In general, we find that different geometries have little impact on the parameter determination; changing the extinction curve has instead a significant impact. F or e xample, the estimated SFR is ≈3 × lower for a SMC curve. We argue in Section 4 that on the basis of the measured [C II ] line luminosity, the MW extinction curve appears to be preferable.The results are summarized in Tables 2 and3 for the MW and SMC curv es, respectiv ely, and for different dust/stellar relative geometries.

        <p>Consider a uniform absorbing dust layer of total optical depth τ d , and divide it into N equal slices, each with an optical depth τ = τ d / N . The layer boundary ( N = 0) is illuminated by an external UV flux, F 0 . The flux reaching the i th slice is F i = F 0 exp (τ i ) = F 0 exp (i τ ); the absorbed flux is then F i (1exp (τ )).
