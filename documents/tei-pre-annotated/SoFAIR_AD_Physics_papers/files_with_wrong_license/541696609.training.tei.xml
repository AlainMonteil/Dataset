        <p>Entanglement plays a crucial role in quantum information science. For multiqubit systems, many of the states considered, such as for entanglement purification, secret sharing, quantum error correction, as well as interferometric measurements, belong to the family of graph states 9 . Two prominent examples are GHZ and cluster states, which are central ingredients for various measurement-based quantum information protocols [19][20][21] . One-way quantum computing 18 , for instance, represents a conceptually appealing alternative to its circuit-based counterpart. Instead of carrying out unitary quantum logic gates, computation relies on adaptive single-qubit measurements. This operational easing comes at the price that a multiqubit entangled resource state, a cluster state, needs to be prepared in advance.Entanglement plays a crucial role in quantum information science.

        <p>To address this issue, deterministic schemes have been proposed 4-6 . These use a single-spin memory qubit that mediates entanglement over a string of sequentially emitted photons. This approach is resource efficient as it permits the generation of in principle arbitrarily many entangled photons from a single device. First experiments along these lines have been performed with quantum dots 11,12 demonstrating entanglement of up to three and four qubits, respectively, in a linear cluster state. Low photon generation and collection efficiencies, a noisy semiconductor environment or the need for a probabilistic entangling gate were among the biggest obstacles for reaching higher photon numbers. Recent experiments with Rydberg superatoms 13,29 demonstrated GHZ states of up to six photons.

        <p>Our apparatus is shown schematically in Fig. 1b. It consists of a single 87 Rb atom at the centre of a high-finesse optical cavity. A magnetic bias field oriented parallel to the cavity direction defines the quantization axis and gives rise to a Zeeman splitting with Larmor frequency ω L = 2π × 100 kHz. Several laser beams propagating perpendicular to the cavity allow for various manipulations, such as state preparation by optical pumping and coherent driving of Raman transitions between the hyperfine ground-state manifolds with energy selectivity provided by the Zeeman splitting. The cavity serves as an efficient light-matter interface for atom-photon entanglement 7 with an optical cooperativity of C ≈ 1.5 (Methods). A vacuum-stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (vSTIRAP) enables the generation of photons with high indistinguishability stemming from accurate control over their temporal wave function 30 . Photons that are outcoupled from the cavity are analysed with a polarization-resolving detection setup mainly consisting of a polarizing beam splitter (PBS) and a pair of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors. Furthermore, an electro-optic modulator is used for fast selection of the measurement basis by switching between the Z basis (right and left circular polarization) and the X basis (horizontal and vertical polarization). When set to the X basis, a half-wave plate can optionally be placed to rotate the detection basis along the equator of the Bloch sphere.Our apparatus is shown schematically in Fig. 1b.

The data shown (blue for GHZ and red for cluster states) are the coincidence count rates of events in which N consecutive photons were detected starting from the first attempt. For instance, for the largest state of 14 photons, we recorded 151 coincidences in 7 h of experimental runtime, equivalent to roughly one event every 3 min. From an exponential fit to the data, we extract the overall single-photon generation and detection efficiency η = 43.18 (7)%. We estimate the intrinsic generation efficiency η 0 to be 66%, mainly limited by the cooperativity and the escape efficiency (see ref. 30 ). Both can be optimized by higher-quality mirrors and a smaller cavity-mode volume. The detection efficiency of η d = 0.7 captures all the remaining loss contributions, such as optical elements and detectors. These include free-space-to-fibre couplings (94% twice), propagation through optical fibre (97%), free-space optics (90%) and detector efficiency (90%). Correcting for the detection efficiency η d , we infer an N-photon coincidence rate at the output of the cavity, as given by the light blue line in Fig. 4. This represents the limit of our system with the current parameters. As a comparison, we also show the rate of the best available SPDC system, as well as deterministic sources using single quantum dots or Rydberg-blockaded atomic ensembles. Although the repetition rate for these systems is typically many orders of magnitude higher than in our protocol, our system far outperforms previous implementations in terms of real-time coincidence count rate as well as efficiency scaling.Figure 4 shows the raw rate of multiphoton coincidences as a function of photon number N including post-selection and experimental duty cycle.

        <p>For GHZ states, we observe a total error rate of about 1% per photon. We attribute most of the infidelity to spontaneous scattering during the photon production process, as the vSTIRAP control pulse couples to the F′ = 3 excited state of the D2 line. This opens a decay channel, which competes with the coherent emission of the photon. By post-selecting on early photon arrival, one can partly filter out events in which scattering has occurred (Extended Data Fig. 4). In the future, this could be eliminated by generating the photons on the D1 line, in which no F′ = 3 state is present.

The first photon is measured in the linear basis ( H V ⟩/ ⟩ | | ), which projects the atom onto a superposition of the qubit states |1, +1⟩ and 1, -1⟩ | . The atomic state then precesses with twice the Larmor frequency. After a certain time t, the atomic qubit is read out by mapping it onto a photon, which is then measured in the same basis as the first photon. The fidelity, which we define as the projection of the second photon on the first, shows oscillations damped by noise, such as magnetic field fluctuations. After roughly 1.2 ms, the envelope of the oscillations crosses the classical threshold of 0.66, which defines the intrinsic coherence time of the atomic qubit. For the GHZ sequence however, we observe that the effect of decoherence is intrinsically reduced. We can show this by artificially extending the length of the sequence to 1.25 ms for a six-photon GHZ state. In this case, every photon production cycle takes 300 μs.

        <p>| and F = 2⟩ | can then be varied by scanning the delay τ between the hyperfine transfer from 1, ±1⟩ | to |2, ±2⟩ and the vSTIRAP control pulse, as illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 3b. For different values of τ, we record the parity oscillations similar to Fig. 2a and infer the visibility. From the measured data, we can see a clear dependence of the visibility as a function of τ, with a rephasing appearing at around 85 μs. The maximum value is roughly equal to the six-photon coherence shown in Fig. 2 (shown as a dashed line for reference), for which the sequence length was only 250 μs. This is strong evidence that a large part of the decoherence is mitigated as an inherent feature of the protocol.| and F = 2⟩ | can then be varied by scanning the delay τ between the hyperfine transfer from 1, ±1⟩ | to |2, ±2⟩ and the vSTIRAP control pulse, as illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 3b.
