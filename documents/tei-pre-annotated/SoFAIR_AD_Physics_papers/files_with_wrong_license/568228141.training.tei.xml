        <p>Context. Gaia Early Data Release 3 (Gaia EDR3) contains astrometry and photometry results for about 1.8 billion sources based on observations collected by the European Space Agency Gaia satellite during the first 34 months of its operational phase. Aims. In this paper, we focus on the photometric content, describing the input data, the algorithms, the processing, and the validation of the results. Particular attention is given to the quality of the data and to a number of features that users may need to take into account to make the best use of the Gaia EDR3 catalogue. Methods. The processing broadly followed the same procedure as for Gaia DR2, but with significant improvements in several aspects of the blue and red photometer (BP and RP) preprocessing and in the photometric calibration process. In particular, the treatment of the BP and RP background has been updated to include a better estimation of the local background, and the detection of crowding e↵ects has been used to exclude a↵ected data from the calibrations. The photometric calibration models have also been updated to account for flux loss over the whole magnitude range. Significant improvements in the modelling and calibration of the Gaia point and line spread functions have also helped to reduce a number of instrumental e↵ects that were still present in DR2. Results. Gaia EDR3 contains 1.806 billion sources with G-band photometry and 1.540 billion sources with G BP and G RP photometry. The median uncertainty in the G-band photometry, as measured from the standard deviation of the internally calibrated mean photometry for a given source, is 0.2 mmag at magnitude G = 10 to 14, 0.8 mmag at G ⇡ 17, and 2.6 mmag at G ⇡ 19. The significant magnitude term found in the Gaia DR2 photometry is no longer visible, and overall there are no trends larger than 1 mmag/mag. Using one passband over the whole colour and magnitude range leaves no systematics above the 1% level in magnitude in any of the bands, and a larger systematic is present for a very small sample of bright and blue sources. A detailed description of the residual systematic e↵ects is provided. Overall the quality of the calibrated mean photometry in Gaia EDR3 is superior with respect to DR2 for all bands.Context.

        <p>Gaia EDR3 is based on 34 months of observations that started on 25 July 2014 (10:30 UTC) and ended on 28 May 2017 (8:45 UTC), which corresponds to 1037.9 days. In the paper, mission events are reported in the on-board mission timeline (OBMT), expressed in units of satellite revolutions (21600 s) from an arbitrary origin. A formula to convert OBMT to barycentric coordinate time (TCB) is provided by Eq. (3) in Gaia Collaboration et al. (2016). The time covered includes the range used for Gaia DR2 with an additional one year of observations, providing a 54% increase in time coverage.Gaia EDR3 is based on 34 months of observations that started on 25 July 2014 (10:30 UTC) and ended on 28 May 2017 (8:45 UTC), which corresponds to 1037.9 days.

        <p>The key input used by the photometric and low-resolution spectra processing system 
            <rs type="software">PhotPipe</rs> for the measurement of Gband fluxes are the results of the Image Parameter Determination (IPD) process performed by the Intermediate Data Update (IDU) system. This task estimates the observation time, acrossscan position (for 2D windows) and instrumental flux of the 2 https://archives.esac.esa.int/gaia source in each SM and AF window, along with their associated formal uncertainties. The modelling of the window contents is a complex process involving many calibrations, from the electronic bias through to the point-spread function (PSF, for 2D windows) or line-spread function (LSF, for 1D windows). Significant improvements have been made to these calibrations between Gaia DR2 and Gaia EDR3 and hence to the fitted G-band fluxes. Foremost is the quality of the PSF/LSF; in Gaia DR2 a single library with very limited parameterisation was used, whereas all of the major dependencies are activated in Gaia EDR3. In this release the variation of the PSF and LSF with time due to changes in focus and contamination level is tracked. The wave number from Gaia DR2 was used, when available, to properly represent the colour dependence of the profiles, and the smearing e↵ect of the across-scan motion is included, along with the variation across each charge-coupled device (CCD). To better model the Gaia PSF a shapelets-based scheme has superseded the product of the along scan (AL) and across scan (AC) LSFs used in Gaia DR2. A detailed description of the PSF and LSF modelling is provided in Rowell et al. (2020). The other calibrations used in IPD, such as the electronic bias and nonuniformity, dark signal, charge injection and release (Hambly et al. 2018) have all been redetermined in IDU to improve their self-consistency and resilience to data gaps. Enhancements have been made to the masking of saturated samples, and to remove suspected secondary sources within a window. Finally, a local background has been fitted for the majority of windows, allowing a much better tracking of the extreme straylight features.

        <p>For G BP and G RP , 
            <rs type="software">PhotPipe</rs> starts from the reconstructed satellite telemetry, which collates all acquisition information for the BP and RP instrument into a single record for each transit and deals with the generation and application of the various calibrations required to produce bias and background corrected epoch spectra, which are then geometrically calibrated, removing the optical distortions and CCD geometric e↵ects. The bias and nonuniformity mitigation (Hambly et al. 2018) is based on a set of calibrations produced by IDU. Two key improvements have been introduced for Gaia EDR3: the determination of the local background for each BP and RP observation, including both straylight and astrophysical background contributions; and an assessment of the crowding status of each observation based on the predictions of observations on the focal plane for all objects in the source catalogue covering the entire time range spanned by the processing. More information on these aspects of the BP and RP pre-processing is provided in Sect. 3.
        </p>
        <p>As already described in Riello et al. (2018), one critical piece of input information used by 
            <rs type="software">PhotPipe</rs> is the cross match produced by 
            <rs type="software">IDU</rs>. The purpose of the cross match is to identify transits belonging to the same astrophysical source and to exclude spurious detections of artefacts around bright sources. A detailed description of this key process is provided in Torra et al. (2020). It is critical for the end user of the Gaia EDR3 catalogue to realise that a Gaia source and all its properties are defined by the set of transits that have been associated with it by the cross match process. Direct comparisons of individual sources between the Gaia DR2 and Gaia EDR3 catalogues should take into account that: the fact that the source identifier is the same in the two data releases does not imply that the corresponding astrophysical source is the same; even when the astrometry is consistent it is still possible that a significant fraction of the transits that were associated with that source in the Gaia DR2 catalogue are not any longer in the Gaia EDR3 catalogue. We therefore strongly discourage the end user from drawing conclusions based on comparisons source by source between Gaia DR2 and Article number, page 2 of 35 Gaia EDR3. We instead suggest to perform statistical comparisons of similarly selected datasets from both archives (e.g. comparing colour-magnitude diagrams for particular sky regions).

        <p>Several aspects of the BP and RP (pre-)processing have not changed with respect to Gaia DR2.

        <p>The crowding evaluation process is an assessment of the crowding status of a transit based on the pre-computed 'scene'. This is defined as the predicted observation time and AC coordinate for all objects in the source catalogue computed projecting their known astrometric coordinates onto the focal plane given the satellite attitude and geometry. The scene covers the entire time range covered by the data. These predictions are used to assess whether a given transit happened to be a↵ected by crowding.The crowding evaluation process is an assessment of the crowding status of a transit based on the pre-computed 'scene'.

        <p>Here we distinguish two cases: transits can be either contaminated by a nearby source (that may or may not have had a window assigned in that specific satellite scan of that region of the sky) or blended when some additional source was captured by the same window. Transits were flagged as blended also when the non-target source was just outside the window (within 5 TDI periods in the AL direction and 2 pixel in the AC direction). The crowding assessment of course takes into account also accidental contamination or blend from the other field of view (FoV). The result of the crowding assessment for a given CCD observation is an indication of its status as contaminated, blended or not a↵ected by crowding.Here we distinguish two cases: transits can be either contaminated by a nearby source (that may or may not have had a window assigned in that specific satellite scan of that region of the sky) or blended when some additional source was captured by the same window.

        <p>While for the assessment of blends the simple knowledge of the relative positions of window and scene sources is sucient, for the contamination evaluation an estimate of the AL and AC LSFs well beyond the boundary of the window is required. For the processing leading to Gaia EDR3, the contamination surrounding a bright object has been characterised using black-listed transits (Torra et al. 2020). These are transits that were not cross-matched to any existing source and did not trigger the generation of a new source because they were considered to be spurious detections caused by di↵raction spikes around bright objects. In the AL direction the contamination profiles were described using splines. In the AC direction a simpler approach was taken interpolating linearly in magnitude space between the central value and the distance at which the brightness level was below the typical background. This distance was estimated from the analysis of the black-listed transits as a function of the magnitude of the central source. Figure 1 shows a typical 2D reconstruction of the contamination around an object of magnitude six for BP in the top panel and RP in the bottom panel. This can then be scaled according to the magnitude of the contaminating source. This simplified approach can only reproduce di↵raction spikes aligned with the AC and AL directions. There are however indications of diagonal features at a much smaller level.

        <p>The top panel in Fig. 2 shows a small stretch of computed scene, the corresponding observations and crowding evaluation results covering about 4.5 arcmin in the AL scan direction and about 1 arcmin in the AC direction close to a source of magnitude 5.4 (located at the origin of the coordinates). In this time range, one of the two FoVs was observing a high-density region near the Galactic centre. The scene objects are shown with filled circles with size and colour proportional to the source brightness (the brightest source observed in this time range appears in yellow at coordinate (0,0), while fainter objects are represented with small dark symbols) while the transits are shown with coloured rectangles of size proportional to the size of the BP and RP windows. The transit symbols are colour coded according to the residual background (i.e. the background level evaluated from the edge samples of the BP spectrum after the application of the background calibration, lighter colours correspond to larger residual background values). Larger red and blue rectangles mark transits that have been assessed as contaminated and blended respectively. From this example it is clear that blending a↵ects a large fraction of transits, while contamination is mostly relevant for transits at the same AC coordinate as the bright object. Figure 2 also shows that not all sources in the catalogue can be assigned a window during all scans (visible as filled circles with no filled rectangle around them) and that in the case of bright sources, some of the light coming from the target object is present in the edge samples thus a↵ecting our measurement of the residual background (visible as larger and brighter filled circles with light-coloured filled rectangles). This is even more evident in the bottom panel, which shows a zoom-in on a few transits around a couple of sources of magnitude close to 13. The symbol sizes and colours have the same meaning as in the top panel.

        <p>The two main components of the background in the BP and RP spectra are the straylight caused by di↵raction from loose fibres in the sunshield (Fabricius et al. 2016) and the astrophysical background (e.g. non-resolved sources, di↵use light from nearby objects, zodiacal light). In the processing for Gaia DR2 the background calibration was optimised to remove the straylight component by accumulating background measurements (from empty windows known as Virtual Objects) over periods of approximately 8 satellite revolutions (Riello et al. 2018). This process generated 2D maps of resolution 1 degree in the AL direction and 100 pixels in the AC direction (corresponding to approximately 17.7 arcsec). While this was appropriate for the smooth behaviour of the straylight in most devices, it was clearly not su cient to characterise the small-scale variations due to the astrophysical background. The validation of the Gaia DR2 data showed clear indications that significant residual background was a↵ecting the performances in crowded regions and in areas in the sky where the level of di↵use light is expected to be higher.The two main components of the background in the BP and RP spectra are the straylight caused by di↵raction from loose fibres in the sunshield (Fabricius et al. 2016) and the astrophysical background (e.g. non-resolved sources, di↵use light from nearby objects, zodiacal light).

        <p>The resolution of the background calibration is constrained by the amount of background measurements available. In the latest processing, in order to increase the resolution of the 2D maps, science windows assigned to sources fainter than G = 18.95 were used to provide additional background measurements from Table 1. Conversion between the residual flux level given in e s 1 sample 1 and a magnitude di↵erence at three di↵erent magnitudes (15, 17, and 19). The mag values listed in the table for a given level of residual background indicate the corresponding expected change in magnitude.

The mag values listed in the table for a given level of residual background indicate the corresponding expected change in magnitude. We note that since this is a magnitude di↵erence, the values provided are applicable to both G BP and G RP .</p>

        <p>To show the performance of the background calibration, we defined a quantity called residual background which is computed for each transit as the median of the flux values in the edge samples of a spectrum. In the following we present the results of the analysis on BP data as representative of both BP and RP. Figure 3 shows the distribution in the sky of the median residual background in BP spectra for the nearby source dataset with the additional magnitude cut G &gt; 17. Signatures of the Galactic Plane and other crowded regions are still visible, but the background flux residuals are limited to the range [ 0.5, 1.0] in e s 1 sample 1 . This is equivalent to an e↵ect at the mmag level for a source of magnitude 15, a hundredth of a magnitude for a source of magnitude 17 and a tenth of a magnitude level for a source of magnitude 19 (a more detailed estimate is provided in Table 1.

As indicated by the sky map, the size of this e↵ect is not constant over the sky and a correction would have to be applied at the epoch level to take into account the satellite scanning law and the overlapping fields of view.To show the performance of the background calibration, we defined a quantity called residual background which is computed for each transit as the median of the flux values in the edge samples of a spectrum.

        <p>It is important to remark that the measure of the residual background from the edge samples of a spectrum will unavoidably be a↵ected by the presence of other sources in the window (i.e. blending) and by contamination from nearby bright sources. We could have used the results of the crowding evaluation to filter out these cases, but this would have prevented us from creating a full sky map as particularly dense regions would have had very little data left. By using the median values for validation we have mitigated problems with occasional blend or contamination coming from the other FoV, but we should remember that in crowded regions our results will be biassed towards larger positive residuals.It is important to remark that the measure of the residual background from the edge samples of a spectrum will unavoidably be a↵ected by the presence of other sources in the window (i.e. blending) and by contamination from nearby bright sources.

        <p>The general flow of the flux and LSF calibration of the BP and RP spectra is very similar to the one in place for the photometry: also in this case the calibration is divided into an internal calibration using a large number of sources to constrain the calibration of all di↵erent instrument configurations to a single homogeneous system, and an external calibration which relies on a small set of sources with high accuracy external data to tie the internal system to the absolute one. As for the photometry, no external data is used in the internal calibration of the spectra implying that the process needs to be iterated between a step creating a reference catalogue of spectra for all calibrators and a step updating the calibrations. Once the reference catalogue is established, a single run over all observations will generate the final set of calibrations.The general flow of the flux and LSF calibration of the BP and RP spectra is very similar to the one in place for the photometry: also in this case the calibration is divided into an internal calibration using a large number of sources to constrain the calibration of all di↵erent instrument configurations to a single homogeneous system, and an external calibration which relies on a small set of sources with high accuracy external data to tie the internal system to the absolute one.

        <p>The photometric system is established using a set of calibrators that were selected as described in Sect. 4.3. The iterative calibration process follows the same principles used for Gaia DR2: an initial set of reference source fluxes is produced by accumulating the uncalibrated epoch photometry from the INIT period and then used to derive a set of LS calibrations. The calibrations are then applied to produce calibrated epochs that are accumulated for each source to produce an updated set of reference fluxes (see Riello et al. 2018;Carrasco et al. 2016, for more details). Having an explicit time dependency in the calibration model is not very practical due to the irregular time evolution which is both smooth, during most periods, and discontinuous, during decontamination and refocussing campaigns. Instead the LS calibrations are solved independently over short periods of ⇡ 4 rev for each time range and instrument configuration (see Riello et al. 2018, for more information). The shorter gate configurations (Gate04 and Gate07) for the AF CCDs are particularly di cult to calibrate due to the very few observations acquired with these configurations. To improve the statistics, the LS calibrations for these configuration were solved over extended time ranges of ⇡ 20 OBMT revolutions. The same approach was taken for the shorter gate configurations (Gate05 and Gate07) for the BP CCDs. For RP instead the Gate05 and Gate07 configurations were calibrated using the Gate09 calibrations be-cause the CCD response did not show any additional major feature in the longer Gate09 configuration. LS calibration solutions could not be derived for non-nominal calibration units (i.e. gated observations for window class 1 and window class 2) even when further extending the time ranges to ⇡ 60 OBMT rev because of the lack of a su cient number of observations. These instrument configurations were therefore calibrated using the corresponding ungated calibrations. A total of 20 iterations were performed (see Sect. 4.6 for a discussion of the convergence criteria).The photometric system is established using a set of calibrators that were selected as described in Sect. 4.3.

        <p>A set of calibrators were selected among all sources observed in the INIT period. The main purpose of this selection is to provide a more compact dataset to use for the iterative initialisation of the photometric system. The selection was designed to provide a wide colour range and a uniform sky coverage in both magnitude and colour. The main reason to require uniform sky coverage is to ensure that each one of the time ranges for which the LS calibrations are solved would have an adequate set of calibrators observed regardless of the satellite scan direction. To be selected, sources were required to have Gaia DR2 photometry in G, G BP and G RP (so that they could be assigned to a colour-magnitude bin) and to have at least 5 available BP and RP observations in the INIT period. The Gaia DR2 photometry was only required for the selection stage and was not used in the Gaia EDR3 calibration process. The magnitude range was restricted to 5.0  G  19.0 and the colour to 1.0  G BP G RP  6.0. In the regime G  13.5 sources will normally be assigned a 2D window and gating will be used on board to minimise the e↵ects of saturation. In order to have enough calibrators to solve for daily calibrations for these instrument configurations, all sources brighter than G = 13.5 were automatically included by the selection process. At fainter magnitudes instead, for each level k = 6 HEALPix (Górski et al. 2005) pixel a grid of 70 colour bins and 140 magnitude bins (in the ranges specified above) was created and the first four sources to be assigned to each bin were selected. The order of the sources in each bin was randomised (in a reproducible way) before the selection started. Three additional conditions were added to this selection process: 1) all spectro-photometric standard stars (SPSS, Pancino et al. 2012) and sources from the passband validation library (PVL) were automatically included in the selection (see Appendix B for detailed information on these datasets); 2) all sources that had epochs acquired with a gate configuration were automatically included in the selection to ensure proper linking between the various gated configurations (see Evans et al. 2018, for more details); 3) all sources with G G RP  0.5(G BP G)+1.2 were excluded because contamination from extragalactic objects is quite high in that region of the G G RP versus G BP G colour-colour diagram.

        <p>The large scale (LS) calibration model describes features that vary smoothly across the focal plane and that might change smoothly with time over timescales of several satellite revolutions. The main changes to the LS model for Gaia EDR3 are: 1) the colour information is represented by spectral shape coefficients (SSC) computed from the internally calibrated source mean spectra; 2) the SSCs are no longer normalised as in Gaia DR2 (see Appendix A in Riello et al. 2018) but are used to form flux ratios (see below); 3) additional terms have been included to model the flux loss caused by the on-board window acquisition process. It is important to notice that because of point 1 above, the colour information is now fixed all the way through the calibration process: in Gaia DR2 instead the reference colour information was updated at every iteration making the overall process less stable. In Gaia DR2 it was not possible to use SSCs derived from the mean spectra since the internal calibration process of the spectra was not considered to be mature enough for use in the photometric calibration. For all bands the LS model is a polynomial with a zero point z 0 , quadratic dependence from the across scan (AC) position of the observation µ and a quadratic dependence from the centring error µ , defined as the di↵erence between the predicted AC position at the observing time4 and the nominal window centre. The raw residuals (meaning with respect to the identity model) in Fig. 6 show that there are no observations with a centring error larger than ±2 pix for the G-band and for BP as well. For this reason only observations with a centring error in the range ±2 pix were used to solve for the calibration; the centring error was then clamped to ±2 pix when applying the calibrations to avoid problems caused by extrapolation. For RP the situation is more complex due to the optical design of the instrument: a wider range of ±4 pix was required for the calibration solution and for clamping when applying the calibration (additional information is available in Appendix G).The large scale (LS) calibration model describes features that vary smoothly across the focal plane and that might change smoothly with time over timescales of several satellite revolutions.

        <p>where s 0 to s 3 are the four SSCs fluxes computed from the BP mean spectrum and s 4 to s 7 are the four SSCs fluxes computed from the RP mean spectrum. The wavelength ranges defining each SSC are the same as used in Gaia DR2 (see Table 5 in Carrasco et al. 2016). The G-band LS model includes a linear dependence from all the ratios defined by Eq. 1 and Eq. 2. The LS model for BP includes only the two ratios defined by Eq. 1 while the model for RP includes only the two ratios defined by Eq. 2. The small scale (SS) calibration models the column-level CCD sensitivity. The same model (a simple zero point for each 4 pixel wide AC bin) was used as in Gaia DR2. The LS calibration models described above are summarised by Eq. 3 with Eq. 4 providing the three di↵erent colour dependencies for G-band, BP and RP:where s 0 to s 3 are the four SSCs fluxes computed from the BP mean spectrum and s 4 to s 7 are the four SSCs fluxes computed from the RP mean spectrum. The wavelength ranges defining each SSC are the same as used in Gaia DR2 (see Table 5 in Carrasco et al. 2016). The G-band LS model includes a linear dependence from all the ratios defined by Eq. 1 and Eq. 2.

        <p>The time link calibration (mitigating the e↵ect of contamination) that was introduced in Gaia DR2 was not required for Gaia EDR3 because the throughput in the INIT period was more stable and less a↵ected by contamination than the one used for Gaia DR2.

This e↵ectively shows the response loss mainly caused by the contamination which a↵ected the early stages of the mission more severely (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016). It is interesting to note that the rate of contamination changed behaviour between the two FoVs following the three decontamination events, possibly indicating that the deposition of the contaminant (assumed to be water ice) flipped from one FoV mirror system to the other. This can be seen in the bottom right Article number, page 7 of 35 part of these diagrams.

Here two sets of calibrations are shown for a particular CCD corresponding to 1D (shown in red) and 2D (shown in black) configurations which cover di↵erent magnitude ranges. The fact that the two calibra-tions overlap almost perfectly, even though they are produced using completely independent datasets, confirms that even the smallest features visible in the calibrations are indeed real and not noise. We can therefore conclude that the SS calibration is measuring the CCD response to better than the mmag level.An example of the quality of the SS calibrations (equivalent to a 1D flat field) is shown in Fig. 8.

        <p>One of the improvements made in the IPD processing leading to Gaia EDR3 is a better handling of hot columns.

This is shown in Fig. 9 where for Gaia DR2 (upper plot) the hot columns can be seen as five narrow peaks.

        <p>The main method used to assess the convergence of the photometric system is the same one as used in Gaia DR1 and DR2 and is described in Evans et al. (2017). This uses the L1 Norm metric to determine the typical change in photometry using the calibration coe cients. Figure 11 shows this metric for four major configuration groupings. While this is much better than seen in Gaia DR2 (Evans et al. 2018), the metric does not converge to zero. Using these plots it was decided to terminate the iterations at the 20th iteration.The main method used to assess the convergence of the photometric system is the same one as used in Gaia DR1 and DR2 and is described in Evans et al.

        <p>Another set of metrics to analyse as a function of iteration number is the calibration coe cients. In an ideal system, when the photometry has converged, the coe cients will remain the same between iterations. For Gaia EDR3, while this is true for the coe cients involving the AC position and the centring error and also the overall calibration factor and standard deviation of the solution, it is not true for the colour coe cients and these values can change by up to 0.01 over 20 iterations. The reason for this is that there is a strong correlation between the colour coe cients and this causes a partial degeneracy in the calibration model. However, the overall calibration factor is stable at the sub-mmag level and the only implication of this is that these coe cients cannot be used in additional validation analyses for example plotting them as a function of time.Another set of metrics to analyse as a function of iteration number is the calibration coe cients.

        <p>A single overall photometric system will form when there is good mixing between the di↵erent configurations, meaning that each configuration is calibrated with many calibrators and each calibrator is observed under many di↵erent configurations. Problems can arise when configurations are limited to certain magnitude ranges and if systematic e↵ects are present in the data that are not accounted for by the calibration model. For the di↵erent gate configurations this is not a problem as the magnitude ranges of activation of each gate are small and the uncertainty of the onboard magnitude determination is large in comparison. However, for the window class configurations (with boundaries at G = 13 and 16) the on-board magnitude accuracy is good (about 1%) which means that the number of sources that are observed in more than one window class is small. The e↵ect of this is that the ability of the iterations to create a consistent photometric system across all configurations is limited. This can be seen in Fig. 12 which shows the di↵erence in photometry between subsequent iterations as a function of magnitude for a test calibration model (top panel) and the final one used (bottom panel). In the test calibration model, it can be seen that there are discontinuities occurring in correspondence to window class configuration changes. While there is a physical reason for the discontinuity occurring at G = 13 due to di↵erent flux loss e↵ects in 2D and 1D windows, the jump at G = 16 can only be due to a problem in the convergence to a consistent system across di↵erent configurations. The convergence process occurs very slowly due to the poor mixing between these magnitude ranges. For the final model an o↵set was introduced between the window class configurations separated at G = 13 to speed up the convergence and the two faintest window class configurations were combined into a single one. The improvement can be seen in the lower panel of Fig. 12. The lack of discontinuities at G = 13 and G = 16 can also be seen in Fig. 17. We note however, that while this strategy will ensure that the final photometric system does not show discontinuities due to poor mixing between di↵erent instrument configurations, it is still possible for unmodelled systematics to cause small inhomo-Article number, page 9 of 35 A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. aa39587 geneities in the internal photometric system that might require further treatment (see also Sect. 7).A single overall photometric system will form when there is good mixing between the di↵erent configurations, meaning that each configuration is calibrated with many calibrators and each calibrator is observed under many di↵erent configurations.

        <p>An epoch contribution to this weighted mean flux is considered valid when both the LS and SS calibrations have been successfully applied and the calibrated flux is at least 1 e s 1 . This minimum flux threshold was introduced in Gaia DR2 to mitigate the impact of extreme outliers (Riello et al. 2018): the impact of this flux threshold for Gaia EDR3 is discussed in Sect. 8.1. Calibrated epochs could also be excluded a priori from contributing to the mean photometry in a given band depending on quality metrics based on acquisition and processing flags. AF observations were excluded from the mean photometry when any of the following criteria were met: AC trimmed windows acquired around 2230 OBMT revolutions as part of a set of tests that were performed to assess the impact of reducing the AC size of AF windows; windows a↵ected by a charge injection; windows that had some of the samples removed because of inter-FoV truncation; windows for AF2 ROW5 with a reference AC position larger than 1203 pixels (the data is severely a↵ected by a deep trap in the serial register); windows for which the IPD was flagged as not successful; windows for which the source predicted AC position was not available; AF observations in the periods immediately following a decontamination campaign have also been excluded due to large variations in the system response caused by the focal plane having not reached thermal equilibrium yet (see Appendix D for more information). BP and RP observations were excluded from the mean photometry when any of the following criteria were met: truncated windows; windows a↵ected by a charge injection; windows acquired with multiple gates; windows for which the source predicted AC and AL positions were not available (this information is required for the preprocessing of the epoch spectrum from which the raw epoch flux is produced); windows a↵ected by bad columns. To apply the LS calibration to the epoch observations of a given source, it is necessary to use the source SSCs derived from the internally calibrated mean spectra. Depending on the availability of the SSCs (see Sect. 4.4), there are three di↵erent calibration procedures: 'gold' -when all eight SSCs are available; 'silver' -when for either BP or RP some or all SSCs are missing; 'bronze' -when SSCs are missing or incomplete for both BP and RP or if the silver processing failed (see below). Since the calibration model involves ratios of SSC fluxes (see Eq. 1 and Eq. 2) the set of BP SSCs is considered complete when all four SSCs are present and s 1 + s 2 &gt; 0 and analogously for RP but with s 5 + s 6 &gt; 0. It is important to stress that the 'grade' of a source is determined solely by the availability of the SSCs and has no implications about the availability of mean photometry in the various bands. In particular, it is possible for a gold source to be missing the photometry in any of its bands or for a bronze source to have photometry in any of the bands. This is a consequence of the independence between the spectral processing (leading to the generation of the mean spectrum and SSCs) and the calibration of the integrated photometry.An epoch contribution to this weighted mean flux is considered valid when both the LS and SS calibrations have been successfully applied and the calibrated flux is at least 1 e s 1 .

        <p>In order to calibrate non-gold sources it is necessary to produce an estimate of the missing SSCs. For bronze sources, a set of default SSCs are used for every source: this is analogous to how bronze sources were calibrated in Gaia DR2. For silver sources, the missing SSCs are estimated from the G-band and the available BP and RP band using empirical relationships derived using a set of gold sources. For silver sources an iterative process is used to generate the mean photometry: an initial estimate of the source photometry is derived using the default SSCs; this initial guess is then used to obtain an updated set of SSCs for the missing band using the empirical relationships described in Appendix E; the resulting set of estimated SSCs is then used to produce the updated mean photometry. The iterative process is considered successful when the mean G flux between two consecutive iterations has changed by less than 0.05% or if a maximum of 20 iterations is reached. If the mean G flux fails to be produced then the iterations are stopped and the source is then handled as bronze.In order to calibrate non-gold sources it is necessary to produce an estimate of the missing SSCs.

        <p>Figure 14 shows the uncertainty on the weighted mean as a function of magnitude for the gold photometry. Only sources with approximately 200 G-band CCD observations (and analogously 20 in G BP and G RP ) have been included to allow comparing with the predicted uncertainties (Jordi et al. 2010). The dotted line in each of the three panels shows the predicted uncertainty for a nominal mission and 200 CCD observations. The dashed line in each of the three panels shows the same predictions but combined with a calibration error of 2.0, 3.1, and 1.8 mmag for G, G BP , and G RP , respectively. The figure includes also the Gaia DR2 and DR1 uncertainties for comparison (for the latter only the G-band uncertainties are shown since the BP and RP photometry was not part of that release). In the G-band a large improvement can be seen in the range 10.5 . G . 11.5 thanks to improvements in the handling of saturated samples in the IPD process. The G-band uncertainty can be seen to increase in the range 11.5 . G . 13 to then drop again following the dark dashed line (see top panel of Fig. 14). This increase in the uncertainty is due to the fact that the PSF modelling did not include the dependency from the AL rate (see Rowell et al. 2020): the e↵ect is expected to become more significant for longer gates which is indeed reflected by the behaviour observed for the errors. The AL rate e↵ect on the PSF will be included in the modelling for Gaia DR4 which is therefore expected to have improved errors in this magnitude range. A significant improvement is also noticeable at the very bright end, G . 6, which is mostly due to improvements in the handling of saturated samples in the IPD process. For G BP and, to a larger extent (see Appendix G), G RP the improvements at the brighter end are also due to the modelling of flux-loss in the photometric calibrations. At the fainter end, instead, the improvements are due to the improvements in the background mitigation, which for Gaia EDR3 includes an estimate of the local background (see Sect. 3.2).Figure 14 shows the uncertainty on the weighted mean as a function of magnitude for the gold photometry.

        <p>By plotting various statistics as a function of sky position it is possible to identify problems with the processing. In Gaia DR2, the skewness of the flux distribution of each source was used to identify periods where the calibration had been problematic. During these periods, for example after decontamination, the calibration had not worked well and caused observations acquired during such periods (about four days) to be poorly calibrated and become outliers for these sources. These sources would tend to have larger skewness values than normal and they would form great circles in the sky distribution of the skewness. Figure 15 shows the sky distribution of the source G flux skewness for Gaia EDR3. As can be seen, larger skewness values do not distribute along great circles but in areas of very high source density (Galactic centre and LMC) and in regions with higher scan coverage. This second e↵ect is not fully understood yet but it is of much lower significance than the one related to the sky density.By plotting various statistics as a function of sky position it is possible to identify problems with the processing.

Figure 16 shows the sky distribution of Gaia EDR3 sources with G &gt; 22: the only visible features are linked to the scanning law and are explained by the fact that re- gions with higher number of observations (primarily because of more frequent scans) tend to reach a fainter magnitude limit.

        <p>Comparisons with external catalogues are usually quite difficult to carry out since they involve di↵erent passbands. Additionally, if the comparison shows a discrepancy, it can be difficult to establish whether it should be ascribed to the internal catalogue or external one. In Gaia DR1 (Evans et al. 2017) and Gaia DR2 (Evans et al. 2018), a discontinuity was present in the comparisons with APASS at G = 13 (Henden et al. 2015) and with SDSS DR15 (Aguado et al. 2019) at G = 16. Since at these magnitudes there are two important changes in the Gaia window configuration, it was reasonable to conclude that the discontinuities were a result of the Gaia processing or observation process. The equivalent comparisons have been carried out also for Gaia EDR3 (using the colour transformations given in Appendix C) and are presented in Fig. 17 showing that the discontinuities are not visible anymore.Comparisons with external catalogues are usually quite difficult to carry out since they involve di↵erent passbands.

        <p>In Gaia DR2 the background treatment for BP and RP was limited to the mitigation of the time and CCD-dependent straylight contribution (Riello et al. 2018) and was based on maps derived from ⇡ 8 revolutions. For this reason the maps were very insensitive to variations in the local background level, which therefore was still a↵ecting the G BP and G RP integrated photometry, especially at the faint end. Evans et al. (2018) introduced a quality standards. Only Gaia EDR3 photometry from gold sources was used in the analysis. Using a single polynomial to fit the data tends to perform poorly at the blue and red ends of the distribution. The blue end of the distribution is better described by a quadratic polynomial; the central part of the distribution is well fitted by a cubic polynomial whereas the red end can be well represented by a linear fit. The coe cients of the three polynomials and their applicable colour range are provided in Table 2. The resulting fit, valid in the colour range 1.0  G BP G RP  7.0, is shown in the top panel of Fig. 18 and was used to compute the corrected BP and RP flux excess C ⇤ for a selection of ⇡ 6.8 million nearby sources which are shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 18: the C ⇤ has a flat distribution in colour centred on zero. We note here that, for DPAC-internal operational reasons, the Gaia EDR3 archive provides only the uncorrected BP and RP flux excess C via the phot_bp_rp_excess_factor column: the user can compute the corrected BP and RP excess factor C ⇤ as defined by Eq. 6 using the polynomials provided in Table 2. The corrected BP and RP excess factor C ⇤ can be used to iden- tify sources for which the G-band photometry and BP and RP photometry is not consistent. We will now consider a number of possible problems that might occur in the processing to try and quantify the size of their e↵ect on C ⇤ . This should help understanding the possible causes for (some of) the large C ⇤ values seen in the Gaia EDR3 photometry.In Gaia DR2 the background treatment for BP and RP was limited to the mitigation of the time and CCD-dependent straylight contribution (Riello et al. 2018) and was based on maps derived from ⇡ 8 revolutions.

        <p>In Gaia EDR3 the background treatment for BP and RP has been considerably improved to deal with local variations for each individual transit (see Sect. 3.2). As we have shown, some systematic e↵ect related to crowded regions seems to be still present in the data judging from the analysis of residual background. We have also pointed out how di cult it is to disentangle background from crowding e↵ects when measuring the residual background using the edge samples of BP and RP spectra. The two panels of Fig. 19 show the distribution of the flux excess factor versus colour for the same selection of sources with di↵erent colour coding: in the top panel the colour of the dots indicates the median residual background in BP, while in the bottom panel the colour-coding is by an estimated 'blend probability'. This latter parameter is a combination of the fraction of blended transits (as available in Gaia EDR3) and an additional indicator resulting from a clustering analysis of all BP and RP epoch spectra for a given source. The number of blended transits included in the release is based on the available source catalogue. There will be cases where the blending source was not in the catalogue, this could be due to the secondary source being too close and/or too Article number, page 13 of 35 faint with respect to the primary and therefore never detected or in very crowded regions, because the priority scheme on board simply favoured brighter sources. In the blend cases, some of the epoch spectra present clearly multiple peaks showing the presence of more than one source in the window, however the position and brightness of the peaks change with the scan angle and due to the scanning law, often two groups of epoch spectra form with quite distinct features. This is what the clustering analysis is trying to detect. We have defined the metric based on the clustering analysis as the fraction of the spectrum in which the analysis clearly detected a split in the epoch spectra measurements (e.g. if only in ten out of 50 samples used for the analysis the epoch sample measurements formed two distinct groups, the metric will be equal to 0.2). In the bottom panel of Fig. 19 the fraction of blended transits and the newly defined metric have been multiplied to form a single blend probability. Clearly there are large correlations between the residual background and the blend probability and sources with large flux excess tend to have large values for both parameters. From the top plot is also clear how the low flux excess values are very likely due to a slight overestimate of the background. There is however a population of sources that have high blend probability and not so large residual background. It is also important to notice that the residual background estimates obtained for these sources are often not su cient to justify their position in the flux excess versus colour diagram. Using the residual background estimates to correct the integrated BP and RP fluxes entering the computation of the flux excess still leaves a significant fraction of sources with large flux excess.

        <p>It is therefore interesting to analyse in more detail some of the sources with very small and large corrected excess factor to assess the origin of the discrepancy between the G and BP and RP photometry. First we considered the small number of sources in the dataset shown in the top panel of Fig. 18 with very low C ⇤ (e.g. C ⇤  0.15): analysis of the epoch spectra for these sources showed that in all cases the background had been over corrected, leading to anomalously low flux level in BP and RP. Looking instead at the mean spectra of the ⇡ 100 sources with highest excess the situation was less clear. Sometimes there was a clear indication of variability, sometimes there was clear indication of occasional multiple sources (e.g. blends) and sometimes the spectra did not show any apparent anomaly. In all cases the background appeared to have been corrected appropriately. To explore this further, we used a catalogue of ⇡ 8 million sources that was collated from the literature (and then cross-matched with the Gaia EDR3 catalogue) including several di↵erent types of variable stars, galaxies, quasars and planetary nebulae. Figure 21 shows the corrected flux excess C ⇤ versus G BP G RP colour plot for this selection colour-encoded with the source type (for a subset of those deemed to be of most interest).It is therefore interesting to analyse in more detail some of the sources with very small and large corrected excess factor to assess the origin of the discrepancy between the G and BP and RP photometry.

        <p>One important feature revealed by this plot is that galaxies tend to have a large discrepancy between the G and the G BP , G RP fluxes. This is not surprising since the IPD and LSF/PSF modelling producing the integrated G fluxes is optimised for point sources. Additionally, for extended sources the di↵erent satellite scan angle under which each epoch observation is acquired will lead to large fluctuations in the integrated G flux. For BP and RP the window size is much larger and will therefore mitigate the Article number, page 14 of 35 M. Riello et al.: Gaia Early Data Release 3: Photometric content and validation e↵ect, more so for sources with smaller angular sizes (see Appendix F for further details). Improvements in the LSF/PSF modelling and the BP and RP background mitigation in Gaia EDR3 have also led to an improvement in the BP and RP flux excess. In particular when comparing the sky distribution of the corrected BP and RP flux excess in Fig. 22 with the distribution of C from Gaia DR2 (see Fig. 18 from Evans et al. 2018) it is clear that the ecliptic plane pattern caused by zodiacal light is no longer visible.One important feature revealed by this plot is that galaxies tend to have a large discrepancy between the G and the G BP , G RP fluxes.

        <p>From Fig. 21 it is also evident that sources with anomalous SEDs, primarily those dominated by emission lines such as QSOs and PNe, also show positive values of the corrected flux excess. In the case of point-like sources such as QSOs this is primarily due to the presence of strong emission line in the wavelength range where the RP passband has a larger transmissivity with respect to the G passband. For PNe both mechanisms (the presence of an extended structure and of strong emission lines) may be at play. Similar deviations from zero of the corrected flux excess can be expected for other analogous cases such as sources in HII regions.From Fig. 21 it is also evident that sources with anomalous SEDs, primarily those dominated by emission lines such as QSOs and PNe, also show positive values of the corrected flux excess.

        <p>The analysis presented in this section is based only on sources with gold photometry. Looking at at C ⇤ for silver and bronze sources is only possible for the subset of these two samples with photometry available for all bands: 34% and 0.0007% of the whole sample, respectively. Although the distribution of C ⇤ versus colour is similar to that of the gold sources, some deviations can be observed. This is not surprising because of the limitations in the calibration process caused by the partial or complete lack of colour information. For these sources the most reliable photometric information is the G-band: G BP and G RP have been provided when possible but are clearly not expected to be very reliable. Since C ⇤ is a quantity derived from the G, G BP , and G RP fluxes it is expected that its reliability and usefulness will diminish as the quality of its components is reduced. For this reason we argue that C ⇤ is a metric that end users will find e↵ective mostly for sources with gold photometry.The analysis presented in this section is based only on sources with gold photometry.

        <p>The recommendation for Gaia EDR3 is to treat the BP and RP flux excess C, or better the corrected one C ⇤ , purely as an indicator of consistency between the G photometry and the G BP and G RP photometry and not as a data quality indicator.

        <p>The determination of Gaia DR2 passbands relied uniquely upon the set of Spectro-Photometric Standard Sources (SPSS, Pancino et al. 2012;Altavilla et al. 2015;Marinoni et al. 2016, see also Appendix B) as calibrators; however that experience revealed the low sensitivity of the calibration strategy to the actual shape of the passbands, witnessed also by rather large number of published curves: two di↵erent sets in Evans et al. (2018), others in Weiler (2018) and Maíz Apellániz &amp; Weiler (2018), all providing minimal changes in the SPSS residuals between observed and synthetic photometry. The problem is that the most reliable and stable flux calibrators, such as the SPSS, constitute necessarily a limited set of spectral distributions that can only constrain a subset of model components leaving others completely unconstrained (Weiler et al. 2018). To mitigate this limitation, for Gaia EDR3 we decided to employ a much larger set of auxiliary calibrators covering a wide range in stellar types: we selected a large number of sources (N ' 100000) from the Stetson (2000) secondary standards with 10 &lt; G &lt; 20 (see Appendix B.2 for more details) and reconstructed the corresponding SEDs from externally calibrated BP and RP spectra. These data will be publicly available with the forthcoming Gaia DR3 release, while the complete description of the spectral instrument model calibration and methods will be provided in Montegri↵o et al. (in preparation). The interested reader can find a summary of the approach followed for the external calibration of BP and RP spectra in Appendix A. It is however worth mentioning that no external photometry from the Stetson sample has been used in the calibration process: the calibration relies entirely on Gaia data. Furthermore, the usage of a large set of BP and RP spectra ensures that the internal photometric system is robustly tied to the photometric system of BP and RP spectra: extended validation of such photometric system will be provided in Monte-gri↵o et al. (in preparation). Finally, the external calibration of BP and RP spectra is based on the SPSS calibrators and hence the Gaia EDR3 flux scale is tied to the Vega flux scale to an accuracy of 1%. In the external calibration of the BP and RP instrument model, the issues related to the limited size of the SPSS dataset have been mitigated by the addition of di↵erent kind of calibrators, mostly emission line sources such as QSO or WR stars that were used to constrain specific components (LSF and absolute wavelength scale). The comparison between Gaia EDR3 magnitudes and the synthetic ones computed with a preliminary set of passbands revealed two di↵erent problems a↵ecting the internally calibrated flux scales: a colour term in the G band was present for sources with G &lt; 13 and colour G BP G RP &lt; 1.1; a small discontinuity in the G BP residuals was visible around G ' 10.8. Magnitude G = 13 corresponds to the transition between window class 0 and 1 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016), therefore the first issue has been interpreted as an interaction between a non-optimal convergence of the internal calibration between the two instrument configurations and the known colour-dependent issues with the PSF calibration (Rowell et al. 2020), rather than being due to some unidentified issue a↵ecting the calibration of BP and RP spectra, a hypothesis enforced also by the lack of a similar e↵ect in the G BP and G RP residuals. Regarding the second e↵ect, discontinuities in the behaviour of the G BP photometry around this value of G magnitude were noticed also in Gaia DR2 (first reports were in Arenou, F. et al., 2018, but see also Weiler et al., 2018, andMaíz Apellániz &amp;Weiler, 2018). While the Gaia EDR3 and DR2 photometric systems should be considered independent due to the substantial di↵erences in the processing that lead from the raw data to the final photometric catalogue and to the addition of a large amount of new data, the fact that a similar feature is still present indicates that this might be connected to a change in the instrument configuration, for example a gate activation, occurring at approximately this magnitude and that has not yet been fully calibrated out. To minimise these e↵ects in the final photometry a correction has been applied to the (epoch and mean) I G and I BP fluxes available from the Gaia EDR3 archive. The I G fluxes correction has been derived as a polynomial function of the BP and RP flux ratio:The determination of Gaia DR2 passbands relied uniquely upon the set of Spectro-Photometric Standard Sources (SPSS, Pancino et al. 2012;Altavilla et al. 2015;Marinoni et al. 2016, see also Appendix B) as calibrators; however that experience revealed the low sensitivity of the calibration strategy to the actual shape of the passbands, witnessed also by rather large number of published curves: two di↵erent sets in Evans et al.

        <p>To exemplify the issue, we selected from the Gaia EDR3 archive all gold nearby sources with an error on the parallax smaller than 1 mas providing a sample of ⇡ 3.4 million sources. The left panel of Fig. 26 shows the G vs G BP G colourmagnitude diagram (CMD) for these sources. A striking feature of this CMD is the tail at the faint end of the main sequence bending towards bluer colours, which is clearly unexpected. This feature is produced by the fact that the 1 e s 1 minimum flux threshold adopted for the G-band was also applied to G BP : when progressively fainter red sources are observed, the distribution of their epoch photometry will be progressively more clipped at its faint end leading to an overestimated mean flux. To confirm the nature of this feature we performed a simple experiment in which we regenerated the mean G BP source photometry removing the minimum flux threshold. The result of the experiment is shown in the right panel of Fig. 26, which presents the CMD for the same set of sources but using the new G ⇤ BP computed without the low flux threshold: the tail feature is no longer visible and the sources previously located there have been redistributed towards redder colours.To exemplify the issue, we selected from the Gaia EDR3 archive all gold nearby sources with an error on the parallax smaller than 1 mas providing a sample of ⇡ 3.4 million sources.

        <p>The low flux threshold has also the e↵ect of reducing the measured scatter in the G BP mean source photometry. To estimate the size of this e↵ect we selected sources with at least 50 epoch observations in G ⇤ BP in a set of 5 mmag slices at G ⇤ BP =20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and computed the median and MAD of the calibrated epoch fluxes for all the sources in each slice using all epochs or just those with flux larger than 1 e s 1 . The analysis is done in flux-space because the error distributions in magnitudespace are not symmetric with the discrepancy becoming progressively larger towards fainter fluxes (see Appendix H). The scatter measured at these faint magnitudes will have significant contributions from non-poissonian sources of uncertainties, such as background, contamination and blends. The results are sum- marised in Table 4: the increase in scatter when using all transits is rather modest for sources close to G ⇤ BP ⇡ 20 and only increases to 30 40% at fainter G ⇤ BP magnitudes. Although the increase in scatter for the G ⇤ BP =24 slice is smaller than for the G ⇤ BP =23 slice, it should be noted that these two fainter slices have ten times fewer epochs available than the brighter slices and therefore the discrepancy is probably due to small number statistics. Finally, it should be noted that at G ⇤ BP ⇡ 22 the scatter is already of the same order of magnitude as the mean flux and since Fig. 27 suggests that the corrected G ⇤ BP magnitude could reach values even fainter than 25, it is unlikely that the photometry of these sources would be of much scientific value.The low flux threshold has also the e↵ect of reducing the measured scatter in the G BP mean source photometry.

        <p>Even allowing for a generous error in the on-board estimated magnitude, it is clearly not possible for Gaia to have observed sources much fainter than G ⇡ 21. The cause of these unrealistically faint sources was found to be due to unreliable reference SSCs estimated from the mean spectra used in the calibration process. It is indeed possible that if the SSCs fluxes forming the ratios used in the LS calibration model (see Sect. 4.4) have extreme values the resulting calibration factor could have a value considerably smaller than 1 leading to a much fainter calibrated flux. It should be noted that the calibrations do not have any problem, the issue is caused by unreliable colour information (i.e. the SSCs) being used when applying the calibration to the epoch photometry of some sources.Even allowing for a generous error in the on-board estimated magnitude, it is clearly not possible for Gaia to have observed sources much fainter than G ⇡ 21.

In some cases, this value is not available, so a default one is used: this will lead to a systematic e↵ect in both astrometry and G-band photometry. In the former case, the handling of the chromaticity e↵ects in the astrometric solution automatically dealt also with this systematic (Lindegren et al. 2020). Unfortunately the importance of this e↵ect was not recognised early enough to be included in the photometric calibration model and therefore the only option for Gaia EDR3 is to derive a correction to the internally calibrated mean source photometry.

        <p>Investigation as a function of magnitude showed that the systematic was mainly dependent on the window class configuration, thus the analysis was divided into the magnitude ranges G &lt; 13, 13 &lt; G &lt; 16, and G &gt; 16. There is a further slight magnitude dependence at the faintest magnitudes, but this is not taken into account. Figure 28 shows that there is no significant correction needed for the brightest range that corresponds to sources observed mainly with 2D observations. This is probably due to the colour calibration of the PSF not being as good as that of the LSF (Rowell et al. 2020) and therefore the difference between the normal and default ⌫ e↵ processing not being as pronounced. A simple cubic relationship as a function of colour f (G BP G RP ) was fitted to the measured systematic and the coe cients are given in Table 5 for the two magnitude ranges for which the correction is required.

G-band magnitude term for blue and bright sources An anomaly has been detected in the data while looking at the residuals between Gaia EDR3 and synthetic magnitudes derived from BP and RP spectra for an all-sky sample of extremely blue and bright sources (G &lt; 13 and G BP G RP &lt; 0.1): the residuals plotted in Fig. 30, show a trend of about 5 mmag/mag for the magnitude range 8 &lt; G &lt; 13. More precisely, a linear fit to data in this range results in the relation G = 0.054 0.0046 G. Brighter than G = 8, residuals are dominated by saturation effects. Such trends are not seen in the G BP and G RP cases. The origin of this behaviour is probably due to the PSF/LSF calibration where problems are known to exist with the colour-dependent part of the PSF model (Rowell et al. 2020). This magnitude trend is not noticeable in Fig. 23 and Fig. 25 because very few sources fall in this magnitude and colour interval: the interested reader can find some additional details and plots in the online documentation.Article number, page 20 of 35 8.4.

        <p>A major point made by this paper is that there is no silver bullet when it comes to identifying problematic data in a large catalogue like Gaia EDR3. The best approach is inevitably dependent on the specific scientific goal that the end user is pursuing. However, it is recognised that it can also be valuable to have a set of prescriptions that could be applied when a preliminary exploration of the data is required before committing to a more detailed analysis. In this spirit, this section provides a number of suggestions for possible quality filters that users may want to consider while also pointing out some caveats.

        <p>There are a number of caveats that should be considered when applying this kind of selection. First, the fact that a source has = 0.0 does not necessarily imply that the source is not a↵ected by crowding. The reason is that the crowding assessment (see Sect. 3.1) is limited to sources that are present in the Gaia catalogue, meaning sources that have been acquired, at least once, by Gaia. Close pairs, namely sources that are close enough on the sky to never be resolved by Gaia as a non-single source, will not be excluded by a filter on . The second caveat is that does not take into account the flux ratio between the target source and the blending source(s): for example, if = 0.5 but the target source is G BP = 14.0 and the blending source is G BP = 19.0, then the e↵ect of the blending source on the target source is probably negligible. In principle, users can assess this e↵ect, at least in the case where the blending is from a source that is close to the target source on the sky (an occasional blend could be due to a source coming from the other FoV). First all sources a↵ected by blending can be detected using a filter on , then for each of these sources a cone search query could be performed to find other sources in the Gaia EDR3 archive that are close enough to the target source to result in a blend. Since the size of a BP and RP window is approximately 3.5 ⇥ 2.1 arcsec (AL⇥AC), sources that are closer than ⇡ 1.05 arcsec should always be blended whereas sources that are at a distance larger than ⇡ 1.05 arcsec but closer than ⇡ 1.75 arcsec will occasionally be blended depending on the satellite scan direction. Once the blending source(s) have been identified it will become possible to make a more informed decision on whether the blend is likely to have a significant e↵ect on the photometry or not. 9.4. Filter on BP and RP corrected flux excess Section 6 introduced the corrected BP and RP flux excess, C ⇤ , which is obtained for a given source by subtracting from the BP and RP flux excess C (see Evans et al. 2018) the expected excess at the source colour produced by the polynomial defined in Table 2. We remind the user that C ⇤ is not available as a column in the Gaia EDR3 archive and therefore has to be computed as described in Sect. 6. C ⇤ provides a measure of consistency between the G-band, BP and RP photometry and therefore can be used to exclude sources showing inconsistencies. Section 6 analysed in detail di↵erent possible causes of the inconsistency, showing that it could originate in any of the bands. This is the major limitation with C ⇤ : it only indicates the presence of an inconsistency, without an indication to where it originates. Filtering on C ⇤ can also be problematic when completeness is important since it will have the e↵ect of excluding variable and extended sources (see Fig. 21).There are a number of caveats that should be considered when applying this kind of selection.

        <p>There are many reasons why the data from Gaia DR2 should not be used in conjunction with or compared to that in EDR3. Due to the way that the photometric systems have been set up in the two releases, the passbands are di↵erent and cannot be compared directly. In general there will be colour terms between them. Although the di↵erence between the Gaia EDR3 and DR2 passbands are smaller than between DR2 and DR1 (G-band only), it will still amount to a few percent. Specifically for the Gband, the PSF and LSF calibrations (Rowell et al. 2020) have improved greatly for data release and a number of systematic e↵ects have been corrected because of this, for example the linearity of the magnitude scale. Also, since the PSF and LSF fits are now much better for point sources, the di↵erence in the photometry between extended and point sources will be amplified. In some cases this di↵erence will amount to 0.5 mag or more. This issue is further discussed in Appendix F.There are many reasons why the data from Gaia DR2 should not be used in conjunction with or compared to that in EDR3.

        <p>The source IDs are in the majority unchanged between Gaia DR2 and EDR3, but it is still a significant number (see Sect. 7 of Torra et al. 2020, for a detailed discussion). Moreover, the list of transits associated with a given source ID may have changed significantly following improvements in the cross match process. Finally, comparisons between data releases are not recommended in general since they mainly show issues that are present in the old data that are no longer relevant. Interpretation of the di↵erences are also di cult to make for the reasons given above.The source IDs are in the majority unchanged between Gaia DR2 and EDR3, but it is still a significant number (see Sect. 7 of Torra et al. 2020, for a detailed discussion).

        <p>In this paper we have presented the photometric content of Gaia EDR3 and described the process of producing calibrated photometry for G-band, BP and RP. A few issues that have been discovered during the validation of the photometry in preparation for the data release have been discussed and possible mitigation strategies have been suggested. Although it has been stressed that selecting good quality data from the Gaia EDR3 catalogue must be tailored to the specific scientific goal of the end user, a number of quality metrics have been presented: the recommendation is to use them only in the preliminary exploratory analysis while a better ad hoc approach is being devised. Finally, we conclude providing a summary of the major improvements in the Gaia EDR3 photometry.In this paper we have presented the photometric content of Gaia EDR3 and described the process of producing calibrated photometry for G-band, BP and RP.

        <p>-Apart from saturation e↵ects for very bright sources (see Sect. C.1), the significant magnitude term found in the Gaia DR2 photometry (Casagrande &amp; VandenBerg 2018; Weiler 2018) is not visible anymore Fig. 25: over all there is no trend larger than 1 mmag/mag. However for blue sources (G BP -G RP &lt; 0.1) there is an indication of a di↵erential colour term between sources brighter and fainter than G=11 at a level of 1% in magnitude (see Sect. 8.4). -Using only one passband for the entire magnitude and colour range, does not leave systematics above the 1% level in magnitude in all bands; this increases to ⇠ 2% for the 4148 sources with G &lt; 13 and G BP G RP &lt; 0.1. -Better background estimation has been carried out in all three passbands. For the G BP and G RP bands this new processing is described in Sect. 3.2. The validation of this is shown in Fig. 22 where no trace of zodiacal light is present unlike in Gaia DR2. -The consistency between G, G BP , and G RP has improved as is shown in Sect. 6. -Better saturation handling for the G-band has been carried out for Gaia EDR3. This is seen in Fig. 14, where the bump at G = 11.2 has been reduced with respect to Gaia DR1 and DR2. This can also be seen for G &lt; 6 in this plot and in the analysis of Sect. C.1 where the correction is close to zero. -In the processing that lead to Gaia EDR3, the handling of bad data was considerably improved. This involved prefiltering data that had been identified as problematic and excluding some periods where the photometry was of poorer quality and could not be calibrated well enough. This is evidenced in Figs. 15 and 16 where no great circles (sometimes referred to as 'cat scratches') are visible. -In comparison between Gaia DR1 and DR2, no discontinuities are seen at G = 13 and 16 in the comparison with external photometry (see Fig. 17). This reflects the better stability that has been achieved in establishing a consistent photometric system between the window class configurations. -Since the number of observations available for a given source is, on average, larger in Gaia EDR3 than in DR2 (thanks to the longer time range covered) the uncertainties on the mean source photometry are also smaller. However, an even larger overall improvement was achieved with the addition of more terms to the calibration models as described in Sect. 4.4. This is clearly visible in Fig. 14 since the comparison is based on sources with the same number of observations in all three data releases and therefore the di↵erences cannot be ascribed to the di↵erent time ranges covered by the releases.-Apart from saturation e↵ects for very bright sources (see Sect.

        <p>All the improvements listed above are part of the ongoing huge e↵ort to extract the most homogeneous, precise and accurate photometry from Gaia data. This requires the calibration of hundreds of instrumental characteristics and inhomogeneities in space and time, in the attempt to standardise the overall system. As extensively discussed by Clem &amp; Landolt (2013), with current technology, this goal may be achieved up to typical uncertainties of &lt; ⇠ 1%. This can be seen as the current state-of-the-art limit in photometry (see also Ivezić et al. 2007;Magnier et al. 2020, for recent, large-scale examples). The current sub-1% precision we achieved for an enormous number of stars, covering the full range of astrophysical parameters, allows us to reveal tiny e↵ects, that we progressively try to understand and correct. Through this continuous process, the precision and accuracy of the photometric data increases with the subsequent data releases, allowing for more sophisticated treatment and understanding of the system complexity.All the improvements listed above are part of the ongoing huge e↵ort to extract the most homogeneous, precise and accurate photometry from Gaia data.

        <p>Since externally calibrated BP and RP spectra have been used to reconstruct the passbands of the Gaia EDR3 photometric systems (Sect. 7), we give here a brief description of the models and the strategy implemented to perform the external calibration of the BP and RP spectra, provided that a full description will be presented in Montegri↵o et al. (in preparation) The general scheme for the calibration of BP and RP spectra is similar to the one implemented for the photometric data, being split into an internal calibration -aimed at bringing all observations onto a common reference system (often referred to as the 'mean instrument') -and an external calibration describing an instrument model capable of reproducing the observational mean spectrum of a source given its SED. Once the instrument model is defined, it can be used to reconstruct the SED of each source starting from the corresponding BP and RP mean spectra.Since externally calibrated BP and RP spectra have been used to reconstruct the passbands of the Gaia EDR3 photometric systems (Sect. 7), we give here a brief description of the models and the strategy implemented to perform the external calibration of the BP and RP spectra, provided that a full description will be presented in Montegri↵o et al.

The traditional approach to derive a simple response of the instrument as a function of wavelength by computing the ratio between the observational spectrum and the SED for a limited set of (possibly featureless) calibrators does not work very well for Gaia because the width of the LSF is rather large compared to the wavelength scale of the response variations: as a consequence, the derived response changes with the spectral type of the calibrator. The LSF cannot be ignored and must be taken into account.where the instrument model is a combination of the e↵ective monochromatic LSF L(u, ), the dispersion relation D( ) and the overall instrument response function R( ), which includes the contribution of mirrors and prisms transmissivities, CCDs quantum e ciency etc. Two distinct models are built for the BP and RP instruments.

        <p>If the previous relation is discretised to a finite wavelength grid, it can be conveniently expressed as a matrix multiplication:If the previous relation is discretised to a finite wavelength grid, it can be conveniently expressed as a matrix multiplication:</p>
        <p>where the matrix K represents the instrument model sampled on the same wavelength grid of ! n p and on the same sample grid of ! n e . This alternative formulation points out clearly the linear nature of the instrument model. In principle, given the availability of an arbitrarily large set of calibrators spanning the widest variety of SEDs, it should be possible to derive the instrument matrix of Eq. A.2 at once from a least squares fit: unfortunately the pool of astrophysical sources that satisfy the requirements for a reliable flux calibrator (isolated and point-like source with stable flux and high S/N ratio) shrinks to a set of stars spanning a limited range of astrophysical parameters, and 
            <rs type="software">SPSS</rs> represent such a selection of sources. Moreover it can be demonstrated through principal component analysis that a set of calibrators such as the 
            <rs type="software">SPSS</rs> can only constrain a limited number of instrument components (roughly one fifth of the number of required components). We note that a similar problem holds also for the passband determination as discussed in Sect. 7. To mitigate these limitations we have followed two parallel strategies: 1) we developed the current model starting from a nominal instrument model (built on our pre-launch knowledge of the instrument hardware) so that only constrained deviations are allowed between the fitted model and the starting one; 2) we extended the calibrator set (
            <rs type="software">SPSS</rs>) with a wide variety of sources featuring strong emission lines over the entire wavelength range (mostly QSO and WR stars) and several sources taken by the PVL set (especially the reddest sources). Since these additional calibrators often exhibit flux variability (see Sect. B), we implemented an iterative scheme where each update of the instrument state is followed by a grey flux calibration of all non-SPSS sources (the flux level of each source is scaled to minimise the di↵erence between predicted and observed flux distributions). The model is bootstrapped on the nominal model and, since its formulation (Eq. A.1) is not linear with respect its parameters, the optimal model is then evaluated employing the Di↵erential Evolution algorithm (Storn &amp; Price 1997).

        <p>Once the instrument model is defined, one could use the integral equation A.1 to solve for the unknown SED, expressed in some convenient parametric form, starting from the observational spectrum. However, this equation is known as a Fredholm Integral Equation of the first kind and it is generally di cult to solve because the problem is essentially ill-conditioned: being the observed spectrum n p (u) a↵ected by noise, there are many solutions that satisfy exactly an integral solution slightly perturbed from the original. To mitigate this problem we adopted a di↵erent strategy: since BP and RP mean spectra are represented as a linear combination of a proper set of basis functions B i (u) (Carrasco et al., in preparation), for each basis function we set up an integral equation as Eq. A.1, where n p (u) is substituted with the basis B i (u). In this way we can solve these equations to build up a new set of basis functions (called 'inverse basis functions') whose images through the instrument model are the basis functions that represent the observed mean spectra. In other words, by solving the integral equation for analytic functions that are by definition noise free we can achieve a numerically stable representation of externally calibrated SEDs. BP and RP spectra are reconstructed separately and then merged to form a unique SED. SPSS candidates after constancy assessment (of the ⇡ 300 initial candidates, about 100 were discarded because of variability). Therefore, the current SPSS release contains about half of the full SPSS set and only '1500 spectra on a total of '6500 (roughly 25%). As a result, the extreme blue and red portions of the SPSS flux tables are expected to significantly improve in the future. The SPSS reference system is tied to the CALSPEC reference system 10 ( Bohlin et al. 2019) by means of the three pure-hydrogen white dwarfs G191-B2B, GD 71, and GD 153. More specifically, the SPSS flux reference system is tied to the 
            <rs type="version">2013</rs> version of CALSPEC, which is about 0.6% brighter than the current version (Bohlin et al. 2014). A comparison of the 36 stars in common with the latest version of CALSPEC confirms that the SPSS are indeed 1% brighter. On the other hand, the synthetic Johnson-Cousins magnitudes obtained from the SPSS are on average 1% fainter than the reference magnitudes by (Landolt 1992), for the 37 stars in common. The ⇠1% flux di↵erence between di↵erent standard systems appears to be the ultimate accuracy limit of current observing technology (see the discussion by Clem &amp; Landolt 2013). 2015b) and extracted from CDS (Wenger et al. 2000). can be used as a first order approximation of the discrepancy between the Gaia photometry and the SDSS photometry: as expected, the discrepancy is smaller for galaxies of small apparent size and then increases significantly for progressively larger objects.

        <p>Because of the very small size of the AF windows, it is likely that the G-band photometry of extended sources will show an excess of scatter mimicking variability. The more elongated the galaxy the larger the excess scatter is expected to be since the measured epoch flux will be a↵ected by the scanning direction of the satellite. This e↵ect can be seen in Fig. F.2 which shows the variability proxy 13 for the G-band versus the G magnitude (see e.g. Mowlavi et al. 2020) with the colour scale showing the ratio between the semi-minor and semi-major axes of the galaxy as available from the SDSS archive.

        <p>Finally, it should be noted that the PSF and LSF modelling and IPD determination has been considerably improved (Rowell et al. 2020) in Gaia EDR3 for point sources: significant di↵er-ences with respect to the Gaia DR2 photometry are therefore to be expected for extended sources.

        <p>The RP prism has a very low convergence (about 1%), which reduces the total telescope focal length but only in the acrossscan direction. It leads to the loss of samples located at the extreme AC edges of the CCD: up to 70 pixels may be lost in the RP FoV. Of course, the most a↵ected CCDs are the extreme ones (row 1 and 7 for RP), and only a minor e↵ect is expected on the central CCD (row 4). To mitigate for this e↵ect additional optical elements are used to e↵ectively magnify the RP optical path to fully cover the RP CCDs. The VPU allocates the window positions based on a set of on-board lookup tables that take into account the AC motion of the source on the focal plane: for a given AC position of the window, as assigned by the VPU, there will be a distribution of how well centred the source will be within the window. Although this is true also for BP, the RP zooming has the e↵ect of widening the distribution of this centring error. This means that to e↵ectively model flux loss in RP, it is necessary to adopt a wider range for the centring error. This is shown in the top panel of Fig. G.1 which shows the CCD response determined by the SS calibration for an initial test run which was using the ±2 pixel clamped range for the centring error. The saw-tooth pattern is caused by residual flux-loss that was not corrected due to the restriction in centring error. When the correction range for the flux loss is expanded to ±4 pixel, as shown in the bottom panel of Fig. G.1, the pattern fully disappears in the preceding FoV (red) and is considerably reduced in the following FoV (blue), although a systematic e↵ect is still present at the ⇡ 2.5 mmag level. The probable reason for the remaining error is that the flux loss terms in the LS calibrations is only a quadratic in centring error and that for RP more terms are needed.The RP prism has a very low convergence (about 1%), which reduces the total telescope focal length but only in the acrossscan direction.

        <p>The error distribution of the fluxes is reasonably symmetric and close to being Gaussian for most magnitudes (but see also Sect. 8.1). This is the reason why all the photometric calibrations are carried out in flux-space. The transformation from fluxes to magnitudes is non-linear and would cause the error distribution to become asymmetric. If the calibrations were to be done in magnitude-space a bias would be created. While this would be small, at the 1% level, the aim of the Gaia project is to push the photometric accuracy to the mmag level and beyond. The use of fluxes in the photometric processing, with flux errors being Gaussian-distributed, has the additional advantage of supporting the use of a maximum likelihood estimator for the generation of mean photometry. Furthermore, using inverse variance weighting ensures maximum signal to noise for the mean (see e.g. Lupton 1993). In general, the asymmetry caused by the fluxmagnitude transformation is small, but since the photometry is being published close to the magnitude limit it is important to consider. The error asymmetry caused by this transformation between plus and minus magnitudes for the epoch G photometry is 5%, 10%, and 20% for G magnitudes of 19, 20, and 21, respectively. For BP, the fluxes can get lower and have larger asymmetries. This is the reason why magnitude errors are not given in the Gaia archive -a single magnitude error is not su cient. If working in magnitude space is required, then lower and upper bounds of the magnitude error should be computed from the I I and I + I values converted to magnitudes using the zeropoints given in Table 3.The error distribution of the fluxes is reasonably symmetric and close to being Gaussian for most magnitudes (but see also Sect. 8.1).

The original requirement was to provide a final precision of '1% and an accuracy of 1-3% of the Gaia flux calibration with respect to Vega (Bohlin et al. 2014). Additionally, because no existing dataset satisfied simultaneously all the requirements, a dedicated observing campaign was carried out, including: (i) a strict constancy monitoring of all candidate SPSS within ±0.5% (Marinoni et al. 2016); (ii) a photometric campaign to provide BVR magnitudes for all the candidate SPSS (Altavilla et al., submitted to MNRAS); and (iii) a spectro-photometric campaign to derive accurate flux tables (Altavilla et al. 2015, Pancino et al., in preparation) 9 .Appendix B.1: Spectro-photometric standard stars The SPSS were selected to be good flux calibrators for Gaia, according to the criteria detailed by Pancino et al.

        <p>The publicly available Stetson secondary standards 11 are a set of more than 200 000 stars in di↵erent wide fields such as stellar clusters, standard fields, supernova remnants, planetary nebulae, deep galactic fields and the like. Their Johnson-Cousins UBVRI magnitudes are accurately calibrated (within 1%) on the Landolt (1992) system with the method described by Stetson (2000) and updated as in Stetson et al. (2019). The database is constantly evolving, with daily updates, but the reference system remains stably anchored to the Landolt (1992) one, only the number of stars and their individual uncertainties change with time. The version of the database that we used here was downloaded in 2019. From a sample of 177 915 UBVRI secondary standard stars assembled by merging the catalogues of Stetson's standard fields, we selected a subsample of ⇠100 000 (a) having an unambiguous counterpart in Gaia DR3 and (b) being strictly clustered along the locus of bona fide stars in the G G BP versus G G RP colour diagram. The latter criterion ensures that the selected stars have precise and consistent photometry in the three Gaia bands. We stress again that, in the present context, we use this catalogue only as a convenient sample of bona fide, well-measured stars, as all the data that we used to refine the external calibration come entirely from Gaia, namely original or synthetic G, G BP and G RP photometry.

        <p>The PVL was created as a validation set, covering a larger variety of spectral types with respect to the flux calibrators, the SPSS. In the O and B spectral type range there are luminous blue variables, Cephei and ↵ Cygni stars, slowly pulsating B stars, hot subdwarfs, and a large fraction of binaries (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2019;De Marco &amp; Izzard 2017). Similar considerations hold for very red stars, which can vary because of chromospheric and magnetic activity, rotation and spots (Iwanek et al. 2019) (Artigau 2018). Therefore, without a careful constancy monitoring on a large range of timescales, it is very di cult to pre-select suitable flux standards of extreme spectral types. For this reason the SPSS list does not include stars of types later than M2 and contains very few bright O and B stars. The PVL was thus built using space-based HST (Hubble Space Telescope) spectra, by including: (i) 39 CALSPEC hot stars that were not already included in the SPSS set for the above reasons; (ii) 17 stars from the HOT-STAR set (Khan &amp; Worthey 2018), excluding stars in planetary nebulae; (iii) the red star Proxima Centauri (Ribas et al. 2017); (iv) the two brown dwarfs in the CALSPEC set (2M0036+18 and 2M0559-14) 12 and (v) the red CALSPEC stars GJ 555 and VB 8. We did not consider stars that showed known variability above ±5% and the typical variability in the PVL set is ±2% (for comparison it is ±0.5% for the 
            <rs type="software">SPSS</rs>). For this reason, we have preferred to rely on the SPSS set as flux calibrators to ensure we can achieve our goal of 1% accuracy. All PVL stars that were calibrated on the latest CALSPEC reference system were re-aligned with the SPSS system, namely the 2013 CALSPEC system, by increasing their flux by 0.6% (Bohlin et al. 2014). In this way, the combined SPSS + PVL dataset is as homogeneous as possible and can be used to perform a range of validation tests. The PVL flux tables will be published together with the SPSS ones (Pancino et al., in preparation).

        <p>This section gives colour-colour transformations that relate the Gaia EDR3 photometric systems to other systems. Relationships for Hipparcos (ESA 1997), Tycho-2 (Høg et al. 2000), SDSS12 (Alam et al. 2015a), Johnson-Cousins (Stetson 2000) and 2MASS (Skrutskie et al. 2006) are provided here. For all fits, except Johnson-Cousins, only those sources with small magnitude error and small BP and RP excess flux were used. In the case of Johnson-Cousins, all available sources where used due to the high quality of these standards. Gaia EDR3 sources with G &lt; 13 mag, photometry in the three Gaia passbands and in the external photometric systems were cross-matched to these external catalogues. The magnitude limit was used in order to limit the influence of photometric noise on the derived relationships. However, this magnitude range is not appropriate for the SDSS12 transformations since SDSS12 sources brighter than 14 mag are saturated. Thus, for the SDSS12 transformations Gaia EDR3 sources with G &lt; 0.01 and SDSS12 magnitudes fainter than 15 were used. In order to obtain good quality fits, filtering on data quality was applied to the data (see the Gaia EDR3 online documentation for more details). The validity of these fits is only applicable in the colour ranges used for the fits (see Table C.1). The coe cients of the polynomials representing the transformations derived between Gaia and Hipparcos, Tycho-2, SDSS12, Johnson-Cousins and 2MASS can be found in Table C.2. A selection of these photometric relationships can be seen in Fig. C.1. A complete set of figures can be found in the Gaia EDR3 online documentation. The relationships shown here were derived using an early internal version of the release. Thus, some sources used in the fit could have been filtered out in the final publication. The purpose of these relationships is to provide a general transformation valid for the widest possible set of M. Riello et al.: Gaia Early Data Release 3: Photometric content and validation stellar populations and types. This will provide a reasonable estimate of their photometry when transforming from one system to another. There are cases in which di↵erent types, particularly M giants and dwarfs, that show di↵erent behaviour in the colourcolour diagram. In such cases, a single fit was carried out for the most populous type (usually M giants), covering the widest range of colours. Thus, for many of the relationships shown here the red end is only valid for M giants and not M dwarfs.This section gives colour-colour transformations that relate the Gaia EDR3 photometric systems to other systems.

        <p>The e↵ect of saturation on the photometry of bright stars is shown in Fig. C.2. The impact of saturation on the results of the G-band photometry has decreased with respect to Gaia DR2 because of improvements in the handling of saturation in the PSF fitting (Rowell et al. 2020). The figure shows the residuals when Hipparcos or Tycho-2 photometry is transformed into the Gaia EDR3 system, using the transformations in Table C.2, and compared with the Gaia EDR3 photometry. The Tycho-2 and Hipparcos data are combined to derive empirical corrections. The corrected magnitudes from the mean magnitudes in Gaia EDR3, G corr XP can be obtained with the following equations:The e↵ect of saturation on the photometry of bright stars is shown in Fig. C.2.

        <p>In the period covered by Gaia EDR3 there are a number of gaps in the photometric coverage. There are several factors that could cause a gap, the most common are: decontamination and refocussing events, gaps in the reconstructed attitude (closely related to gaps in the crossmatch, Torra et al. 2020), satellite outages, gaps in the BP and RP calibration libraries, quality filtering applied during the processing and for the selection of the Gaia EDR3 content (Fabricius et al. 2020). Some gaps a↵ect only certain instruments. Table D.1 provides a list of the known gaps in the Gaia EDR3 photometry. Decontamination campaigns involved actively heating different parts of the focal plane assembly to allow the waterbased contamination to sublimate and being vented out. A decontamination campaign terminates when the active heating is disabled, however at that stage the satellite is not yet in thermal equilibrium, which is slowly reached over the course of several revolutions. Using the photometric calibrations from the period after the decontamination campaigns it was possible to detect time ranges during which the system photometric response was changing significantly with each OBMT revolution. The LS calibrations for these time ranges are not capable of tracking the fast time evolution of the system and therefore the calibrated AF epochs have been excluded from contributing to the source photometry. The PSF/LSF modelling for these periods was also problematic with the running solution unable to keep up with the very rapid changes in the instrument. This resulted also in lower quality raw fluxes produced by the IPD process (see Figure 10 in Rowell et al. 2020). The LS calibration for BP and RP did not show the same problems and therefore the corresponding epochs were not excluded. Table D.2 provides the time ranges for which epoch observations were excluded from the source photometry.In the period covered by Gaia EDR3 there are a number of gaps in the photometric coverage.

        <p>In order to calibrate the silver and bronze sources a statistical approach has been adopted to estimate the missing SSCs. In both cases a subset of ⇡ 3 million sources was used for the calibrations. This subset was a selection that further flattened the distributions in colour, magnitude and sky position and as such is not dominated by the central colours or a particular region in the sky. In the case of the bronze sources, a set of default colours (SSC values) is used. This has been derived from the median SSC values of the subset above. In order to estimate the missing SSC values of the silver sources, we assume that the colour-SSC space distribution of carefully selected 2.9 ⇥ 10 6 gold sources in the sample above and with more than five valid transits (G, BP and RP) is representative of the overall distribution of the sources observed by Gaia. A fifth-degree polynomial is then fitted to the SSC/G versus XP/G flux ratio distributions in order to determine empirical relationships from which the missing values are estimated.

        <p>Section 6 showed that galaxies tend to have large values of the corrected BP and RP flux excess C ⇤ (see the top-left panel of Fig. 21), this has already been used to select galaxies in Gaia DR2 (see e.g. Liu et al. 2020). This behaviour can be explained considering the Gaia acquisition system and processing for G-band and BP and RP data. Fainter sources are acquired in the AF CCDs using the window configuration that corresponds to a viewing size of 0.35⇥2.1 (AL⇥AC) arcsec. BP and RP spectra are instead acquired with a window configuration providing a AL⇥AC viewing size of 3.5⇥2.1 arcsec. Since the BP and RP uncalibrated epoch flux is derived by integrating the pre-processed epoch spectra (see Sect. 3), this is equivalent to aperture photometry with a rectangular aperture. The G-band photometry instead is the result of an LSF fit, where the LSF (Rowell et al. 2020) is optimised for point sources and therefore it is likely to produce an underestimated flux as the observed sources become progressively less stellar-like. The net result is that the BP and RP flux will tend to be significantly larger than the G-band one with the colour of the source unlikely to play a noticeable role since its e↵ect will be much smaller (see Fig. 18, top panel).Section 6 showed that galaxies tend to have large values of the corrected BP and RP flux excess C ⇤ (see the top-left panel of Fig. 21), this has already been used to select galaxies in Gaia DR2 (see e.g. Liu et al. 2020).
