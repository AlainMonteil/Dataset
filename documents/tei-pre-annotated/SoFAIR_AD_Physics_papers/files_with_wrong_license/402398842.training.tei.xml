        <p>Liquid crystals (LCs), which flow like liquids and possess orientational order like crystals, show various phases because of the noncovalent and orientation-dependent interactions between condensed-phase molecules. 1 Due to the high sensitivities to temperature, 2-4 mechanical shear, 5 external electric and magnetic fields, [6][7][8][9][10] light, 11,12 and surface interactions with molecules, [13][14][15][16] LCs are considered to be an emerging class of functional and responsive materials with a wide variety of technological applications. [17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24] With the advantages of high-sensitivity and easy manufacturing, LCs have been extensively employed as signal amplifiers in sensing applications, for example, temperature, 25 gas analytes, 1,[26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36] biomolecules, 37 cells, 38 and so on. In particular, for biosensing, LCs can serve as sensitive reporters of subtle interfacial events, thus providing ultra-low concentration detection of biological targets for early diagnosis of diseases. 39 Different sensing platforms based on various interfacial structures have been developed, such as LC-solid interfaces, [40][41][42] LC-aqueous flat interfaces, 43 and LC droplets interfaces [44][45][46] . Compared to conventional technologies that require manufacturing and high-precision instruments, LCs present superiority in the biosensing field with good high-density integration, rapid response, low cost, and high sensitivity. Therefore, LCs are a promising class of candidate materials for implementing compact and portable biosensor platforms.</p>
        <p>Over past several years, applications of LC-based biosensors have become much diverse and achieved rapid growth, in both categories of sensing targets and detection methods for signal detection. Due to the extensive development in thermotropic LCbased biosensors, in this paper, we primarily focus on thermotropic LC-based biosensors to review relevant mechanisms, research works (particularly in the past five years), and their performance. Detection approaches in these thermotropic biosensors mainly rely on the molecular interactions, e.g. electrostatic forces, non-bonded van der Waals and covalent bonds, leading to the interfacial adsorption and desorption. Based on the interfacial adsorption/desorption in molecular interactions, LC molecules can be reorganized, and the optical anisotropy of LC molecules and the characteristics of output optical signals will change accordingly. This provides a basis for monitoring subtle biochemical and biophysical changes in underlying biological processes.</p>
        <p>Moreover, LC molecules at the interface are able to communicate their orientations within a vicinity of up to 100 μm to further amplify the sensing signals. 47 At the same time, the refractive indices (i.e., the ordinary refractive index no and the extraordinary refractive index ne) will vary with the direction of the light beam propagating along the LCs, resulting in changes in the phases and the polarization states detected by signal transducers. Overall, due to optical anisotropy (i.e. birefringence) of LCs and the influence from targets, the orientation variations of LC molecules and the response signals can be converted into measurable optical/electric indicators.</p>
        <p>Herein, approaches for transducing and functionalizing LC molecules (inducing direct or indirect interactions between targets and LC molecules) in these platforms have been discussed in detail to enhance the understanding of the LC molecule properties and the biological recognition processing.</p>
        <p>Main principles of LC-based biosensors are described in Section 2. Instruments for probing the interactions and transducing the sensing information to optical and electric signals are introduced in Section 3. Although the principles of the different sensors are quite similar, all arising from changes in orientation or phase characteristics, the detection methods for obtaining and magnifying signals are distinct. Besides the polarizing microscope (POM), other types of detection methods are also introduced and compared, including absorbing, reflecting, and active lasing spectra. The capacities and dielectric spectra of LC cells have diverse behavior under different biomolecule concentrations. Methods of functionalizing LC interfaces to induce both specific interactions and ordering transitions of LC molecules are discussed in Section 4. At the end of each subsection in Section 3 and Section 4, a summary table of reported works is provided for all research approaches, including LC materials, sensing platforms, targets, interaction principles, and detection methods.</p>
        <p>With the ability to detect external stimuli with high sensitivity, LC biosensors can help realize a new biosensing era. They exhibit strong potential for industrial applications due to their advantages of functional diversity and potential for selfassembly. However, there are still quite a few challenges in the development of LC biosensors, such as the mechanisms of internal interactions, the stable fabrication of sensing platforms, and the implementation of real-time signal processing, which need to be overcome to satisfy the requirements for practical and commercial applications.</p>
        <p>In Section 5, we highlight prospects to provide insights for the future development of LC-based biosensors. This paper aims to provide a clear, thorough and up-to-date review on the applications, detection methods and development of LC-based biosensors.</p>
        <p>All abbreviations throughout the paper are summarized with their full names in Appendix 1.</p>
        <p>LC materials are categorized into lyotropic LCs and thermotropic LCs. Thermotropic LC materials exhibit liquid-crystalline properties within a specific range of temperatures. Lyotropic LC materials are comprised of amphiphilic molecules and solvents. Their self-assembled configurations can be predominantly controlled by solvent molecules or by the concentration of their solution. In this review, we mainly focus on the use of thermotropic LCs.</p>
        <p>Based on unique properties possessed by LCs, biosensing systems have been explored.</p>
        <p>(1) Orientations of LCs are ultra-sensitive to external stimuli at the interface and topography variation. The external stimuli (e.g., biological analytes) can disrupt the preferred orientation of LCs (defined as easy axis). On one hand, the nanoscale structures of biomolecules affect the orientation of LC molecules, e.g. the hydrocarbon tails of target molecules or the coating/anchoring materials on LC surfaces. 48,49 On the other hand, the electrostatic interactions between LC molecules and charged biomolecules (or biological structures), also play an important role in the biosensing. 50 Interfacial interactions between biomolecules and LCs (such as hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction and ligand coordination) lead to elastic interactions between individual molecules and the increment of the free energy of the system. The high mobility of LCs and elastic forces between LC phases can further amplify and communicate their orientations in the 100 μm vicinity. 1 Noted that although LC-based biosensors have been widely studied based on the orientation transitions, the understanding of molecular-level interactions (especially, the understanding of underlying mechanisms of changes in anchoring energies) is still challenging. The LC elasticity and free energy have been detailed in reported works. 1,51 (2) Anisotropy. The optical anisotropy of LC molecules results in a birefringence. Plane polarized light will be split into two orthogonal rays (possessing orthogonal polarization planes). They will experience different refractive indices and velocities (i.e., the ordinary, no, and the extraordinary, ne). Hence, this phenomenon leads to changes in the phases and the polarization states. The phase difference δ is given by δ= 2πd λ (n e -n o )</p>
        <p>where λ is the wavelength of light and d is the thickness of the sample. When LCs are placed between two crossed polarizers, the intensity of the transmitted light I equals 0 for the homeotropic alignment of LCs, i.e., δ=0. The intensity of the transmitted light I is given by</p>
        <p>where I0 is the initial light intensity and φ is azimuthal direction angle of LCs (against the polarizer). This explains that the texture of LCs with a homeotropic alignment appears dark under crossed polarizers. Otherwise, the visual field is bright (when φ≠ 0° and φ≠90°). Moreover, due to the interference between the two orthogonal rays, colorful optical textures of LCs can be observed via crossed polarizers. Works have been carried out to provide an in-depth analysis on optical properties of LCs. (2) LC-aqueous flat interfaces. Compared to solid surfaces, aqueous interfaces have advantages in preserving the functionality of biomolecules and can provide high mobility and feasibility for targets. Abbott et al. exhibited some pioneering works using such a scheme. 54 In the absence of surfactants, purified water has triggered a planar orientation of LCs, which is parallel to the surface. 49 When there exist surfactants or self-assembly biomolecules (e.g., lipids 55 ), the aqueous solution can provide a homeotropic alignment for LCs at interfaces. The hydrocarbon chains of surfactants or lipids can penetrate into LC phase and provide the homeotropic orientation of LCs.</p>
        <p>Biological analytes in the aqueous solution can be captured at the interface, leading to the orientation transition of LCs.</p>
        <p>In this scheme, LCs are suspended in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grids.</p>
        <p>One interface is in contact with the aqueous solution. Another interface can be different, such as the solid substrate, the air and the liquid (Figure 1(b-d)). 49,54,63 Consequently, there will be various types of interfaces produced, such as solid-aqueous interface, airaqueous interface and aqueous-aqueous interface. In the scheme of solid-aqueous interface, LCs in TEM grids are placed on an alignment agent-treated solid substrate, are then immersed into the aqueous solution. In the absence of the surfactant in the aqueous phase, the hybrid alignment of LC molecules was exhibited. However, the addition of the surfactant (such as lipid) will produce the homeotropic alignment of LC molecules, as seen in Figure 1(b). In the scheme of air-aqueous interface, LC-based platform is submerged in the aqueous solution on one side, and the other side is exposed to the air. The interface between the air and LCs leads to the homeotropic alignment of LC molecules. 63 Therefore, similar to the solid-aqueous interface, the hybrid alignment of LC molecules will be produced when the aqueous solution is purified water, and the homeotropic alignment of LC molecules will be generated when there is surfactant in the aqueous solution. The orientation transition of LC molecules is shown in Figure 1(c). Compared to the solid substrate, the advantage of employing air as a substrate is that the air can consistently produce the homeotropic alignment of LC molecules at any level of humidity. In the scheme of aqueous-aqueous interface, LC-suspended grids can be immersed entirely into the aqueous solution. In the absence of the surfactant in the aqueous phase, LC molecules exhibited a planar alignment (Figure 1(d)). Note that the water flush may cause the grids to be underfilled or overfilled by LCs.</p>
        <p>of LC molecules. However, there are diverse signal detection methods for monitoring molecular orientation changes. In this section, detection methods based on polarized and bright-field images, spectra, and electrical properties of LC are introduced.</p>
        <p>To monitor the orientation transition of LC molecules, detection methods based on POM images were discussed in this section, relying on naked-eye observation or image processing. With the addition of biomolecules, the orientation of LC molecules can change and can be observed via crossed polarizers. According to the principle discussed in Section 2, these common detection methods produce bright and dark patterns in images of LCs. 56 In fact, nearly all LC-sensing experiments need polarized images to support their reliability.</p>
        <p>The simplest way for the observation of POM in LC biosensing (Table 1) is through naked eyes. 47,50,[57][58][59][60][61][62][63] Amin et al. 57 used bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a probe and the LCs as signal reporters to detect heavy metal ions via the formation of strong chelating complexes. Dark optical images were observed due to the homeotropic alignment of the LC (with the BSA) molecules. Conversely, after doping heavy metal ions, bright optical images were obtained due to the disordered orientation of LC molecules under the interactions between the heavy metal ions and the BSA (Figure</p>
        <p>A smaller LC biosensing platform can be implemented based on LC microdroplets. Under POM, the concentration of target molecules was usually detected in line with the configuration of LC droplets changing (from radial to bipolar, or from bipolar to radial) scheme, and the concentration was estimated based on the period when the orientations of all droplets were changed to the bipolar or according to the proportion of droplets that switched to the bipolar orientation within a specific time frame. 50,59,60,64,65 To observe polarized images of glucose with various concentrations, Kim et al. 60 However, in recent years, due to the difficulties in distinguishing minor changes in polarized images by the naked eye, image processing methods were introduced into LC sensing systems to further improve detection sensitivity. Methods of transforming POM images for binarization analysis, 67 such as into mean gray/brightness values, [68][69][70][71] bright area coverage ratios (Br), 72,73 and light intensity, 13 have been applied to realize the quantitative detection of target molecules, as listed in Table 1.</p>
        <p>Du et al. 69 demonstrated detection of the antimicrobial sulfadimethoxine (SDM) using POM based on the transition of LC molecule orientation according to specific surface binding between SDM and aptamers. Mean gray values were calculated for different polarized images, and a linear relationship between the mean gray values of the polarized images and the logarithmic values of the SDM concentrations was observed. Utilizing the inhibitory effects of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione (GSH) on γ-Glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT), an LC-sensing platform for detecting GSH was proposed via calculating the bright area coverage ratios of the polarized images under various concentrations of GSH. 72 These sensing platforms with image processing provide more reliable methods than the POM observation by the naked eye.</p>
        <p>The orientation transitions of LCs have been used to characterize the biological target information. The POM observation is a convenient, rapid, and low-cost detection method for LC-based biosensing platforms. However, the quantitative detection of target molecules is still a challenge. Recently, image processing techniques provide a new vision for applications of the POM observation in biosensing.</p>
        <p>Spectra of optical signals in LC biosensors can also be recorded using spectrum analyzers. These provide a more reliable, sensitive, and accurate detection than what can be achieved with the naked eye, as described in Table 2. Transmittance spectra, reflection spectra, lasing spectra etc., were applied in LC-based biosensors to expand detection approaches.</p>
        <p>Tyagi et al. 74 developed a cholesterol oxidase-based LC biosensor for detecting cholesterol according to an enzymatic reaction that can result in an enhanced nonuniform surface at the film and the disordered alignment of LC molecules (from homeotropic to planar). Since the intensity of the transmitted light changes with the ordering of LC molecules, as shown in Figure 3(a), LC cells with various concentrations of cholesterol were measured using a spectrometer to quantify the intensities of the dark/bright states in POM images (Figure 3(b)). 75 UV-vis spectra, circular dichroism (CD) spectra, and polarization modulation infrared reflectionabsorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) can also be used to characterize the intermolecular interactions on droplet surfaces between LC molecules and target molecules 76 Rastogi et al. 77 demonstrated the time-resolved fluorescence measurement and the UV absorbance in E 48 (a nematic LC)-based biosensor using oil palm leaf (OPL) nanoparticles, and demonstrated its applicability in biosensors.</p>
        <p>Blue phase liquid crystals (BPLCs) with twisted structures, leading to Bragg reflection at a specific wavelength, 78,79 can also be employed for detecting BSA. 80 With BSA immobilized on DMOAP layers, the blue shift of the reflected wavelength can be obtained by analyzing the transmission spectra of the BPLC cell, resulting from the disordered alignment of the LCs. This is the biosensing application, for the first time, utilizing two mesophases (blue phases and SmA) of a single LC material. With a moderate modification in the detection scheme, BPLCs have a great potential to implement an accurate detection of the biomolecular concentration (within a narrow range). Although a simple and label-free BSA sensing method was introduced, the corresponding specific detection ability was not examined. Hu et al. 81 proposed a biosensor based on a Mach-Zehnder fiber interferometer for detecting enzymatic reactions in penicillinase. The refractive index of LC materials varied with the increase of H + released from enzymatic reactions and the continuous rotation of LC molecules.</p>
        <p>This resulted in corresponding changes in the effective refractive index of the cladding modes and a peak shift in the interference spectrum, as illustrated in Figure 3(c). Taking advantages of a wide sensing range and a linear response, LC molecules settled on the Mach-Zehnder interferometer surface can achieve a higher sensitivity by employing a nanomaterial layer. Moreover, due to the addition of biological agents, a change in the effective refractive index and the orientation transition of the LCs led to a change of the reflectivity in the LC-surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor. Vahedi et al. 82 numerically studied the SPR effect in biological agent sensing via variations in the reflection spectra as shown in Figure 3(d).</p>
        <p>In addition, the whispering gallery mode (WGM) cavity with a high Q-factor and a low threshold in the laser emission 83 has a compact structure and can provide highsensitivity optical feedback against small changes in biological processes based on the total internal reflection effect at the curved boundary. WGM cavity has a large number of applications in biosensing systems. 25,[84][85][86] Due to the spherical and smooth surfaces of LC droplets, WGM lasing spectra can be used for biosensing by monitoring the wavelength or mode in the laser emission, 25,[87][88][89][90][91][92][93][94][95] where the binding of biomolecules will change the electrical properties and the ordering of the LC droplets. The detection limit of LC-based WGM biosensing greatly depends on the resolution of the spectrometer. Humar et al. 96 However, compared to external evanescent coupling configurations, Q-factors of LC WGM microcavities will be reduced in the case of free space excitation, which indicates the limit of sensitivity in such schemes. Further investigations need to be carried out to transfer such a fundamental detection principle into a more sensitive biosensing device.</p>
        <p>Due to the high sensitivity to surface electricity and the dielectric properties, LC biosensors were also developed to detect changes in the electrical properties of LCs, as seen in Table 3. The zeta potential of the biomolecules, which denotes the surface charge when biomolecules absorb or dissociate from the solution surfaces, was one of the key factors influencing detection sensitivity. The larger the absolute value of the zeta potential is, the stronger its effect on the LCs. 50 Recently, the reorientation of LC molecules according to the property of dielectric anisotropies was exploited using an external electric field. 67,105,106 A proteinquantitation method based on a capacitive LC cell biosensor was proposed (Figure 5(a)). 105,106 It was found that the higher the BSA concentration, the higher the voltage required for the reorientation of LC molecules to change the electric capacitance of LC cells. Therefore, the BSA concentration can be evaluated by the capacitance of the LC cell. Here BSA was used as an example test, and this LC-based capacitive platform provides the possibility for biosensors and also exhibits great potential in detecting other biomolecules. Specific detection is also required to further demonstrate its capability for biosensing. Meanwhile, in another study, to amplify the signal, an assisted electric field was applied to an LC-based DNA assay for gaining original homeotropic ordering and more prone rotation of LC molecules. 67 Note that these platforms need to be realized at the LC-solid interface which can be easily controlled by an external electric field. Due to the frequency-dependent dielectric properties, dual frequency LCs (DFLCs) were also applied in biosensors of which dielectric spectra can be analyzed. 107 These sensing approaches provide the basis for the development of LC-based capacitive and dielectric biosensors. In addition to the optical birefringence, the dielectric property of LCs is also an effective path to overcome current technical barriers in the LC signal detection and could inspire various advanced biosensing applications of electrically induced LC responses.</p>

        <p>LCs have been widely utilized in the biological area and have been employed in a large number of biosensing applications. The biosensing targets become more diverse via the functionalization of LC platforms. In this section, the methods in functionalizing LC platforms to realize the specific biomolecule detection will be reviewed in detail.</p>
        <p>As the main energy-supplemental bio-micromolecule in cells and organisms, glucose plays a very important role in the proper functioning of the human body. Many technologies have been studied to realize glucose biosensors [115][116][117][118] . As a sensitive material for signal amplification, LCs have also been used to implement glucose sensors, as summarized in Table 4. 119,120 In addition to the oxidation interaction mechanism between GOx and glucose, other methods are also exhibited in this section.</p>
        <p>Oxidation in the presence of glucose oxidase is one of the most widely-used methods to detect glucose. The reaction produces gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide.</p>
        <p>LC droplets for glucose detection have been developed accordingly. 60,121 Surfaces of 5CB droplets were coated with PAA-b-LCP to realize the immobilization of GOx. After adding the glucose, the enzymatic reaction led to the release of H + ions and a decrease in pH value. This caused the protonation and shrinkage of the PAA chains and changed the orientation of the 5CB droplets. The internal reconfiguration of LC droplets was enhanced with an increase in glucose concentration. This can be observed in polarized images (from the radial to the bipolar) via the naked eye. UV light can also be employed for LC biosensing. 122 When 5CB is exposed to UV light, a photochemical reaction will occur to generate the 4-cyano-4'-biphenylcarboxylic acid (CBA). 123 Combining the above two factors: 1) the protonation and shrinkage of the PAA chains, and 2) the ionic equilibrium of the CBA, this approach should in principle provide greater sensitivity for glucose than those relying only on the oxidation reaction between the GOx and glucose. In these two works, LC droplets were used as proton-sensitive biosensors to detect glucose with merits of low cost, portability and easy operation. Nevertheless, the underlying interfacial force balance, resulting from the protonation and the shrinkage of PAA chains, to change the orientation of LCs, remains to be fully investigated. Lee glucose. This sensing scheme indicates the possibility of the practical application of CLCs in photonic optical biosensors. Besides the observation using the naked eye, the detection via simple UV-vis spectroscopy is also employed for a quantitative analysis.</p>
        <p>A scheme of enzyme-free detection based on the deprotonation of PAA chains was also developed. 125,126 3-aminophenyl boronic acid (APBA) was used to replace GOx, and the PAA chains were then functionalized with APBA to specifically detect glucose.</p>
        <p>Recently, optical path characteristics were analyzed for glucose sensing. 127 The unique polarization-dependent diffraction properties of LC polarization gratings provide the basis for the measurement of the target concentration. The optical rotation (angle) was determined by the intensities of two diffracted light beams from the LC polarization gratings (LCPG) with a quarter-wave plate (QWP), as shown in Figure 6(b) and it can be used to estimate the concentration of glucose. 128 This work provided a new vision of LC-assisted optical path analysis in the biosensing. However, such a bulky optical setup (~100 cm) will produce barriers in practical applications. The capability of the specific detection for this scheme requires a further investigation.</p>
        <p>Proteins are involved in all vital processes within cells and organisms such as cell signaling and immune responses. Abnormal protein syntheses at the early stages of disease have been widely investigated. LC-based biosensors were also developed for detecting proteins and peptides. In this section, we will discuss the methods for functionalizing LC platforms and the LC materials with special properties applied in sensing proteins and peptides, seen in Table 5.</p>
        <p>It has been proven that amyloid fiber formation in many diseases, e.g. Alzheimer's disease, are lipid membrane-associated processes, since lipids can lead to the acceleration of aggregation by several orders of magnitude. 129 Based on the coated lipid, Sadati et al. 39 demonstrated as shown in Figure 7(a) that lipid-coated LCs can serve as reporters for distinguishing molecular motifs, such as alpha helices or beta sheets (secondary structures in proteins 39 ) of protein aggregates. In this study, the density of the amphiphilic molecules and the anchoring energy of biotargets (beta-sheet amyloid fibrils exhibit relatively strong anchoring energy) at the interface plays a key role in determining the orientation of LCs. 126,130,131 A similar platform was also implemented to distinguish the two conformationally distinct oligomers in different amyloid-forming proteins. 132 Bao et al. 133 These results provided helpful insights the re-orientation of LCs, which originates from interfacial molecular interactions. For instance, electrical double layers, hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding will contribute to the variation of the anchoring energy of LCs. The collision and the subsequent rapid spreading of amphiphiles, which can trigger a surface pressure-driven interfacial flow and nonequilibrium interfacial states of LCs, have also been discussed. 139 It is of importance to investigate the proper design of LC interfaces for the biosensing.</p>
        <p>It is known that the vertical-alignment layer of DMOAP possesses linear and flexible chains and can force LC molecules to orient perpendicularly to the surface. 140 However, the vertical anchoring force of the aligned DMOAP layer will be suppressed by BSA. 141 Fan et al. 142 showed that the appearance of the LC phases varied under the illumination of halogen light bulbs and POM from dark to bright in the microfluid with the increment of BSA concentration. Immunoassays between BSA and anti-BSA were also observed. Moreover, the reflection and transmission of light lead to a change in the color indicator of a single vertically-anchored CLC biosensor, which can also be used for detecting BSA concentration. 37 This extends the application scope of CLC biosensing platforms.</p>
        <p>Some specialized LC materials with distinct properties have also been applied in protein sensors. In addition to the birefringence, a dual-frequency-liquid-crystal (DFLC), of which the dielectric constant of the nematic director (ε) highly depends on the frequency of the external electric field, was developed to detect BSA based on the dielectric coupling effect (Figure 7(b)). 107 The dielectric relaxation fully depended on the orientation of LC molecules. The concentration of BSA affected the electric permittivity of DFLCs in both the low-frequency and high-frequency regimes and could be evaluated by calculating the relative electric permittivity parameter, seen in With diameters varying from 10 to 100 nm, nanoparticles are widely used in the labeling of biomolecules due to their good biocompatibility. [144][145][146][147][148] Recently, nanoparticles were also studied for LC-based protein sensing. [149][150][151][152] Su et al. 153,154 implemented a Cecropin B biosensor as shown in 155 showed a similar result with the application of AuNPs. In addition, a signal amplification scheme based on heparin-AuNPs was also reported for detecting prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 156 These results exhibited that nanomaterials are crucial for sensitivity improvement due to the interactions between nanoparticles and target molecules. The volume of AuNPs is much larger than that of biological targets. Therefore, AuNPs can be used to further amplify biological signals when they are combined with LCs. Besides AuNPs, other nanoparticles can also be applied as signal amplifiers in LC-based biosensors. Related works will be discussed in following sections.</p>
        <p>Moreover, an important LC-based biosensor was developed to detect IgG. Popov et al. proposed a specific sensing method based on the cascaded absorption of biotinylated lipid, avidin, biotinylated anti-goat IgG, and goat IgG (target molecules) at the LC-aqueous interface, as shown in Figure 8(c). 157 After the addition of positive control antigens, polarized images of LC sensor varied from dark to bright, indicating the decrease of the line tension between domains. Kang et al. 45,158 exploited the applications of LC droplets for IgG detection, based on specific binding between IgG and Anti-IgG. These approaches can be generalized to provide simple and highlysensitive biosensors for any antigen. For example, the detection of specific IgG is very important during the pandemic. For the detection of cardiac troponin I 159 and ischemia modified albumin (IMA) 160 , the interactions between antibodies and antigens were employed to produce transitions in the orientation of LC molecules. Park et al. 161 proposed a new method for the specific detection by preventing the non-specific adsorption and penetration at LC-aqueous interfaces. The specific protein binding at LC-aqueous interfaces was demonstrated, and further research on e.g. ligand-protein interactions were required to complete the study of the specific detection. Ren et al. 162 exploited an aptamer-based method for detecting the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which is an important tumor marker related to lung, gastric and breast cancers. The aptamer was immobilized on the glass slides, while with the arrival of CEA, the aptamer-CEA complexes were formed and these complexes further resulted in the reorientation of LC molecules (from homeotropic to disordered) and the changes of POM images (from dark to bright). In addition, magnetic beads (MBs, with a merit of easy separation) functionalized with an aptamer (apt1) can be specifically bound to tumorrelated proteins (for example, CEA). 163 To detect proteins, target-coated MBs were incubated with duplexes of another aptamer (apt2) and signal DNA (ssDNA). Therefore, complexes (with a sandwich structure) of Mbs-apt1/protein/apt2-signal DNA were formed. The signal DNA can hybridize with the probe DNA (laid on LCs), leading to the orientation transitions of LC (from bright to dark). Employing a 3D-printed optical cell, this LC-based sensing platform can overcome the potential interference from hemolysis and can provide an effective and low-cost approach for the simultaneous detection of multiple tumor markers. DNA aptamer-decorated LC cells were also used for detecting alpha-synuclein, a biomarker of Parkinson's disease. 164 The specific binding events between DNA and alpha-synuclein were accompanied with the change of the ordering of LCs. Using this scheme, the detection of alpha-synuclein in more complicated fluids, such as plasma, can be explored. In addition, this study brings new insight for the applications of DNA aptamers in the detection of biomolecules.</p>
        <p>Nearly all metabolic processes of cells occur at a fast rate with enzymes as biocatalyzers. Thus, the detection of enzymes is crucial due to the close relationship between enzymes and corresponding diseases. [165][166][167] Based on enzymatic interactions, LCs provide feasibility for implementing biosensing platforms to detect enzymes (see Table 6) 74,81,[168][169][170][171][172][173][174][175] . Besides Au nanoparticles, other nanoparticles, used as signal amplifiers in LC-based enzyme biosensors, were also discussed in this section.</p>
        <p>Recently, several research groups studied LCs as label-free signal reporters to detect protease, which plays an important role in blood coagulation 176 and is also closely related to vascular 177 and Alzheimer's diseases 178 . Jannat et al. 179,180 showed that proteases and casein (as a substrate) can be mixed homogeneously in a buffer solution to release peptide fragments. Peptide fragments can be adsorbed on the surface and disrupt the orientations of LCs. This effect can be used to detect proteases. The LC method had a detection limit of 10 ng/mL for proteases, and the sensitivity and dynamic range were significantly improved over Lowry's method (by two orders of magnitude).</p>
        <p>Researchers developed a continuous protease assay technique, using free protein molecules as substrates, to minimize errors in kinetic studies and manual sampling, which could be further developed for cost-effective enzyme assays. Chuang et al. 43 proposed a trypsin detection scheme with the use of BSA immobilized on the upper surface of LC molecules in gold grids to monitor the trypsin activity, associated with cystic fibrosis 181</p>
        <p>Nucleic acids, including DNA and RNA, store genetic information through nucleotides and preserve them for the next generation of living organisms.</p>
        <p>Fluorescence-labeled DNA was applied to detect DNA according to the hybridization between the probes and the target DNA. Some issues in the bleaching and quenching need to be solved. 189 Recently, a few technologies of electrochemistry and surface plasma resonance were studied in DNA sensing. For DNA detection, LC platforms have been widely studied in microarrays by functionalizing LC interfaces. This will be exhibited in the following content and listed in Table 7. 58,[190][191][192][193][194][195][196][197] Shen et al. 140 demonstrated as shown in Figure 9 that the homeotropic orientation of 5CB can be induced by ssDNA (immobilized onto the glass slides), due to the linearity and the flexibility of ssDNA. Compared to ssDNA, dsDNA prevents the 5CB molecules from infiltrating into the DNA film and interacting with the DNA (due to the increase of surface coverage), will arouse different orientations of LC molecules, and the transitions in orientation can be observed using POM. Complementary versus noncomplementary DNA targets can be distinguished via POM observations. Tan et al. 58 proposed a sensitive p53 mutation gene segment detection system by observing the orientation transition of LC molecules, since DNA dendrimers were adsorbed at the LC-aqueous interface. The hybridization induced electric field and conformational constraints of DNA further affected the electric-dipole coupling between DNA and LCs.</p>
        <p>Changes in the dark-to-honeycombed-to-dark texture were observed. This study showed great potential for the ultrasensitive detection of specific DNA sequences.</p>
        <p>DNA-amphiphiles, e.g. DNA-cholesterol and DNA-lipids, 198,199 were also investigated regarding their impacts on the orientation of LC molecules. Various DNAamphiphiles showed different assembly behaviors at the LC-aqueous interface. Zhou et al. 199 demonstrated that pure DNA-lipids did not cause the transition in LC molecule orientation as conventional amphiphilic molecules did, since the assemblies of DNA-lipids are too stable. With the arrival of complementary DNA targets, DNA-lipids were hybridized with the complementary DNA to form a double strand structure.</p>
        <p>Interactions between hydrophobic carbon tails of DNA-lipids and LCs were not strong enough to hold the increased bulky hydrophilic groups (doubled size compared to ssDNA). This led to the desorption of DNA-lipids from the LC-aqueous interface.</p>
        <p>Ellipsoidal domains were formed under POM. Such a DNA-modified LC-aqueous interface can be extended into a generic platform for the detection and diagnosis of biomolecules. Liu et al. 200 demonstrated that the complex generated from sodium ions and the DNA carried negative charges, can change the orientation of LC molecules according to the behavior of the anchored metal ions. 201 The impact of myricetinmetallic salts on the degradation of DNA was also investigated. 202 Myricetin (MY) at LC interface can interact with oxygen atoms to produce complexes and will biochemically target DNA molecules. 203 This can promote the degradation of DNA and the orientation transition of LCs. This sensing platform, with the merits of high sensitivity and easy preparation, also showed good stability over a long test period.</p>
        <p>Verma et al. 204 demonstrated a detection method of negatively-charged DNA using radial-ordering LC droplets coated with positively-charged PLL. Due to the generation of DNA-PLL complexes, the interaction between PLL and LCs was disrupted and this induced the reorientation of LC molecules from radial to bipolar. This study provided a simple method to respond to DNA and a novel insight to develop DNA-based drug nanocarriers. Similar as we discussed above, electrostatic interactions play a key role in LC-based biosensors, and can trigger the orientation transitions of LCs. Based on this scheme, the detection of a variety of charged biomolecules can be realized, where the sensing signals can be further amplified. Meanwhile, Su et al. 205 demonstrated that multiple genes associated with biological pathways, implemented on the ToxChip, responded actively to mixtures of LC monomers. This resulted in the expression of selected mRNAs being up-regulated in chicken embryonic hepatocytes.</p>
        <p>In this subsection, we discuss the detection of metal/nonmetallic ions using LC sensors, with a focus on heavy metal ions, calcium ions and arsenic ions. Heavy metal ions exist in the air, soil, and water. They can enter the human body through food chains and will accumulate due to difficulties in biodegradation and can lead to heavy metal poisoning. As the most abundant metal ion in the human body, calcium ions also play a vital role in the biological possesses. For the detection of metal/nonmetallic ions, many diverse methods have been explored, including LC-based metal ion sensors as listed in Table 8. 201,[206][207][208][209][210][211] As discussed for the detection of enzymes, LC molecules can be employed to detect urease based on an enzymatic reaction. Meanwhile, Qi et al. 186 also implemented an LC-based sensor for detecting heavy metal ions, where the generation of urease and the interaction between urease and urea for producing transitions in LC molecule orientation have been suppressed. The Hg 2+ is one of the metal ions that can be detected using LC sensors. 208,212,213 Singh et al. 212 proposed a Hg 2+ -specific sensing platform Ferrites nanoparticles also show a great potential in detecting other heavy metals (even more analytes). DNAzyme and its combined strand were also used for the specific detection of Pb 2+ . 215 DNA can generate a monolayer at the LC interface and can make LC molecules form a homeotropic alignment. 216 Pb 2+ can be bound with DNAzyme and this results in the catalytic cleaving of nucleic acids and the transition of LC molecule orientation. 215,[217][218][219] It not only extended the scope of LC-based biosensors, but also exhibited the wide studies of DNAzyme in biosensing. DNAzyme was also employed for L-histidine detection, to be discussed in next subsection. The effect of salts on the ordering of LC molecules has also been investigated. 220,221 A spinach RNA aptamer (SRNA) was also employed to detect Pb 2+ . 222 The cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) decorated the LC-aqueous interfaces at first, leading to the homeotropic orientations of LCs (hydrophobic interaction between hydrocarbon tails of CTAB and LCs). With the addition of negatively charged SRNA, the self-assembled LC molecules were disturbed. Pb 2+ , with the specific binding affinity to SRNA, can form stable quadruplex structures with SRNA, and the orientation of LCs became homeotropic again. Here a new method for detecting Pb 2+ was demonstrated, and the formation of Pb 2+ -SRNA complexes and a decrease in the density of SRNA at interfaces were observed. This method also shows good potential in the detection of other toxic metal ions. A low-cost sensor can be realized if a DNA aptamer was employed in the detection, although RNA quadruplexes are more stable than that of DNA. Li et al. 223 reported that Cu 2+ will induce homeotropic ordering in nematic LC molecules due to the interfacial interaction between the Cu 2+ and nitrile-containing LCs on the modified glass of self-assembled monolayers. With an increase in the density of Cu 2+ , the response time of re-orientation was reduced. This study provided a new perspective for the LC surface decoration using metal salts. Although the impact of the formation of electrical double layers on the LC orientation was demonstrated, 221 the decoration of surfaces with metal ions is still complicated and the mechanism requires further in-depth investigations.</p>
        <p>Duan et al. 91 studied the detection of heavy ions via the spectrum of WGM lasers constructed by stearic acid-doped LC droplets. The stearic acid monolayer has different affinities for different metal ions. 224 For heavy metal ions, a significant wavelength shift was observed, indicating that this method was able to accurately distinguish heavy and light metal ions. Such a biosensor can be used to monitor the environment and the water quality. Yeo et al. 211 studied the detection of Ca 2+ using PAA-b-LCP-doped 5CB in Cu grids, where the PAA block-Ca 2+ complex was formed, leading to the collapse of the PAA layers and then the transition of LC molecule orientation (from homeotropic to planar). 225,226 Note that this sensing system was sensitive to divalent ions. However, compared to other divalent ions, Ca 2+ led to a more significant variation in such a sensing platform. A new approach for the non-invasive detection of Ca 2+ in the saliva was demonstrated. Myung et al. 227 developed a divalent metal ion sensor using the photonic CLC film array, and carboxylate salts. A bridged complex was implemented to avoid swelling of the IPN film, arising from the high affinity of the divalent metal ions (e.g., Ca 2+ ) toward carboxylate, which can control the reflected color of the CLC film and determine the concentration of divalent ions. These studies indicated that LCbased biosensors have great potential in detecting various metal ions via the decoration of LC interfaces. The impact of ion species (e.g. divalent and monovalent metal ions) on the LC orientation was also revealed.</p>
        <p>Similar to the metal ion detection, LC sensing platforms for detecting nonmetallic ions have also been investigated. The bio-accumulative As 3+ (arsenic ion) and its compounds are dangerous poisons and exist in polluted water and soils. Therefore, it is essential to develop a sensitive and quickly-responsive detection method for As 3+ and its compounds. Nguyen et al. 228 implemented an As 3+ specific sensing platform based on the formation of the aptamer-As 3+ complex. CTAB was functionalized at an LCaqueous interface doped with Arsenic-binding aptamers (i.e., Ars-3 aptamers).</p>
        <p>Electrostatic interactions between Ars-3 aptamers and CTAB led to transitions in the orientation of LC molecules from homeotropic to disturbed. However, the specific binding of Ars-3 aptamers and As 3+ weakened the interaction between aptamers and CTAB. The orientation of LC molecules was changed back to homeotropic. This LCbased aptamer sensing platform offered a simple, sensitive, and label-free approach, and can also be extended for detecting other metal ions in the natural environment.</p>
        <p>Besides the above biological molecules, LC biosensors have also been developed</p>
        <p>for detecting amino acids, cholesterol, bile acid, endotoxins, nonmetallic ions, and others. In this subsection, we describe LC sensors for these other biological micromolecules, as also summarized in Table 9.</p>
        <p>As a class of amino acids, L-histidine cannot be synthesized in human bodies and must be ingested during daily life. Liao et al. 229 As components of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall, endotoxins (LPS) are composed of two polysaccharide domains and a glycophospholipid (generally named lipid A). Lin et al. 237 demonstrated interactions between lipid A and topological defects in LCs, which resulted in a transition in the ordering of LC molecules. An et al. 238 showed that LPS can be detected using corresponding aptamer molecules, e.g. highaffinity ssDNA aptamers with LPS nanomolar dissociation constants, on the LC sensing platform. Without the requirement of complex instruments or tags for visualization, this approach can also be further developed for the detection of bacteria based on the interaction between LPS (as a sensing layer) and LCs. Moreover, ractopamine 239 , dopamine, 149,240 and interferon-γ 241 can also be detected using LC-based signal enhancements and sensing platforms.</p>
        <p>Sources of sickness in human bodies, including diseased cells (e.g., cancer), harmful bacteria, and viruses, can also be the targets of LC-based biosensors. 242,243 Some researches based on LC sensing platforms have been carried out to overcome barriers in expensive, non-sensitive, and non-specific implementations. As discussed in this subsection and summarized in Table 10, LC biosensors for detecting cells and microorganisms have been widely investigated. The detection of cells/bacteria mainly relies on the manipulation of cell membranes or interactions between cells and substances that have high binding affinity with the cells and bacteria. The antigens and antibodies were also combined to detect viruses. Corresponding works will be discussed in this section.</p>
        <p>The folate receptor-specific ligand (FA), anchored on PS-b-PAA-coated LC droplets, was applied for the specific detection of KB cancer cells. 244 As shown in 5CB microdroplet. 38 This study exhibited a simple and easy-operation approach for allergen sensitized basophils. This biosensor also shows potential in the sensitivity enhancement by controlling surface properties of LC droplets. Lockwood et al. 245 demonstrated that human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) could grow at Matrigeldecorated LC interfaces. This growth led to reorganization of the Matrigel film and transition in the orientation of LC molecules. This provided a new approach to measure the cell-extracellular matrix interactions and to culture cells.</p>
        <p>In addition, the lipid-LC interface can detect the presence of phospholipases. 246,247 Monolayers form spontaneously by bimolecular lipid vesicles on LC interfaces due to their optical properties and lipid-membrane architecture. 248 This causes an LC film to become dark in POM images. 249 Lipases, which are usually released by mammalian cells after their death, can be employed to monitor cell viability via the re-orientation of LC molecules. 42 Wei et al. 250 developed a nematic LC droplet-based platform to detect chitosan-reinforced graphene oxide (CS-GO)-killed bacteria. CS-GO can more effectively puncture the phospholipid membrane using sheet adhesion and membrane puncturing. Meanwhile, lipids on the membranes of live cells can be transferred onto LC droplets and can change the ordering of LC molecules to be homeotropic. However, dead bacteria without intact cellular structures will cause the orientation to become planar. This study developed a biosensor by combining LCs and reinforced graphene oxide. This sensor can be extended into corresponding antibacterial applications, and can also establish a bridge between soft matters and emerging materials.</p>
        <p>Since the lipids within the outer wall (or coat) were transferred onto LC droplets when encapsulated viruses interacted with LC droplets, the ordering of LC droplets changed from radial to bipolar and this enabled distinguishing enveloped viruses from non-enveloped viruses. 251 Actually, this phenomenon was consistent with the lipid transfer process on the LC interfaces. The scheme exhibited a new approach to distinguish types of viruses and bacteria according to differences in their cellwall/envelope structures. Han et al. 252 developed a sensor to detect viruses on a golddeposited polymeric substrate by immobilizing antibodies onto the polymeric surface.</p>
        <p>Human cytomegalovirus-antibodies and adenovirus-antibodies were studied, which can lead to a uniform orientation of LC molecules. With the appearance of corresponding viruses, the uniform-to-random orientation transition of LC molecules occurred due to the binding of viruses to LCs and the masking of the surface topography. Polymeric surfaces with continuous anisotropic patterns can be employed for providing the original orientations of LCs and for amplifying biosensing signals. Such a system can expand the applications of LC-based biological detection on polymeric solid surfaces.</p>
        <p>An LPS monolayer (which can cause homeotropic alignment of LC molecules and forms a uniform layer on an LC interface) was investigated to detect bacterial species.</p>
        <p>Due to the surface structure of microorganisms, LPS can be smoothly removed by microorganisms, and this interaction can be monitored based on hybrid particles of quantum dots and LPS. 253 Owing to the adsorption of bacterial entities on the LPS molecules, a typical optical pattern of LC molecules produced by the interaction between the LPS and the bacteria (regardless of the viability) was observed, leading to bright polarized images of LC molecules. This reproducible sensor has a good potential in the field of antibiotic research for monitoring the effectiveness of drugs on the growth of bacterial cells.</p>
        <p>LCs are a promising branch of sensing materials and has the merits in flowability like liquids and in orientational order like solid crystals. Based on the advantages of functional diversity and the potential for self-assembly, LCs exhibit strong abilities for signal amplification and detecting external stimuli, and have been widely applied in biosensing systems. The research works reviewed in this paper demonstrated that the interactions between biomolecules and LC molecules can directly induce transitions in the orientation of LC molecules, and this phenomenon can be utilized in LC-based sensing systems to detect biomolecules and substances related to biological species.</p>
        <p>The mechanisms in these biosensors mainly originate from the rearrangement of LC molecules, where various detection approaches have been explored to capture optical and electrical characteristics of LC molecules.</p>
        <p>Recently, due to its merits of high sensitivity, low cost, and fast response, more and more researchers have been devoted to investigations of LC-based biosensors.</p>
        <p>Some initial challenges in LC-based biosensing systems have been solved. However, there is still a long way to achieve industrial applications of LC biosensors, primarily including four issues to be solved, as follows:</p>
        <p>(1) Internal mechanisms of interactions and detection at the nanoscale are still not clearly presented, although some works have claimed that electrostatic phenomena or binding behaviors may play a critical role. 100,254 (2) All reported lasers that can provide optical feedback in LC biosensors have been implemented based on LC microdroplets (WGM). Other cavities (e.g., the original F-P cavity and the random laser) should also be able to assess the behaviors of biological systems and may be able to overcome the constraints on the shape of microdroplets for lasering generation.</p>
        <p>(3) To meet the requirement of commercialization, stable sensing platforms and responsive signals are necessary. There are still some unstable factors in the fabrication of LC biosensors. For instance, deviations in thicknesses of LC cells and diameters of LC microdroplets pose an obstacle to the accuracy of biosensors. In addition, signal analyses using artificial intelligence or computer-aided technologies cannot be overlooked, otherwise, it will cost significant time to analyze such a large amount of sensing data, e.g., gray values and bright areas obtained by computer image processing to replace naked-eye observations.</p>
        <p>(4) As anisotropic elastic materials, the orientation of LC molecules can be manipulated by some special biomolecules (for example, lipid 255 ) due to the stored elastic energy. Further investigations are required to test whether the behaviors of LC molecules can control the activities of biological organisms in reverse. This can provide insights and suggestions for the development of LC materials to achieve bidirectional Adapted with permission. 66 Copyright 2016, Elsevier.
