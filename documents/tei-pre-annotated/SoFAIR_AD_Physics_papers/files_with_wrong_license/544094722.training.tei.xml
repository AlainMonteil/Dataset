        <p>Two 130+ meter diameter impact craters formed on Mars during the later half of 2021. These are the two largest fresh impact craters discovered by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter since operations started 16 years ago. The impacts created two of the largest seismic events (magnitudes greater than 4) recorded by InSight during its three-year mission. The combination of orbital imagery and seismic ground motion enables the investigation of subsurface and atmospheric energy partitioning of the impact process on a planet with a thin atmosphere and the first direct test of Martian deep-interior seismic models with known event distances. The impact at 35°N excavated blocks of water ice, which is the lowest latitude ice has been directly observed on Mars.</p>
        <p>Seismic recordings of hypervelocity impacts (&gt;3 km/s) are rare despite being the most common terrain modification process in the solar system. Earth is shielded by its atmosphere, consequently there are few seismically recorded ground impacts, and meteoroids that do reach the ground usually travel at terminal subsonic velocity and only form small craters (1)(2)(3). The Apollo Passive Seismic Experiments on the Moon recorded ground motions from artificial impacts, but these had slow relative velocities (&lt;2.6 km/s), with respect to typical impact velocities of comets or asteroids colliding with the Moon, and formed craters smaller than 30 m (4). Larger natural impacts on the Moon were detected but have not been associated with imaged craters (4,5), and all are expected to be smaller than 100 m in diameter (6). On Earth, a multitude of seismic events with known source locations, e.g., explosion sources, have been used extensively for evaluating seismic velocity models, even down to the Earth's core (7). In contrast, there were only a few confirmed seismic source locations on Mars (all impacts), but these were small (&lt;12 m in diameter) and near InSight (&lt;300 km) so the seismic paths only sampled the shallow crust (8). The two new impact craters reported here allow for the first time an evaluation of deep interior Mars global velocity models and observations of the dynamics of the hypervelocity impact process.</p>
        <p>The notable impacts (Fig. 1) were discovered using the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's (MRO) Context Camera (CTX) (9) and the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) (10) of the Interior Exploration on the Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) mission (11). Our CTX team independently discovered the Amazonis crater that we associated with the S1094b event. The earlier S1000a event, based on similar seismic signature, was then used to direct a search with MRO cameras to find the Tempe impact crater site. Both impacts generated craters &gt;130 meters in diameter making them the largest fresh craters identified since the beginning of the MRO mission 16 years ago. The seismic events have identifiable surface waves, distinguishing them from other recorded and analyzed events on Mars and indicating shallow sources (12). Before these events, surface waves had not been unambiguously identified on any terrestrial planet other than Earth. The closer impact (ID S1094b) occurred at a distance of 58.5° (3,460 km) from the InSight lander on 24 December 2021 and formed the larger of the two craters (150±10 m in diameter). The other impact (ID S1000a) occurred at a distance of 126° (7,455 km) on 18 September 2021 and formed a cluster of craters (largest 130±12 m in diameter). The formation of the craters was time constrained using the MRO Mars Color Imager (MARCI) (13) to within a day (Table S1) making the association with the seismic events highly probable. The seismic events associated with the impacts have similar characteristics, both with approximately 4.0 magnitudes (Table S1, S2). Because the seismic waves traveled deep in the mantle, both events are critical for analysis of mantle velocity models. However, due to S1000a event's large distance, direct seismic waves are eclipsed by Mars's core (14) and more complex bouncing seismic body wave phases (PP, SS) were detected (Fig. S1). The additional attenuation and scattering experienced by these waves obscure the source characteristics.</p>
        <p>This makes source analysis much more challenging. In addition, the S1000a associated crater is located on the side of a graben (Fig. S2), which perturbed the blast pattern and prevented an easy identification of impactor parameters. In contrast, the closer impact (S1094b) occurred in a flat, dust covered region. Below, we first analyze the impact process for this closer impact before considering the implications for Mars interior models of both impacts.</p>
        <p>One of the remarkable features of the S1094b impact was the prominent surface albedo disturbances it caused allowing for the estimation of ephemeral events that would otherwise be unknown, such as the impactor trajectory and the extent of atmospheric blast waves (Fig. 2, Fig. S3). The bearing of the bolide was estimated to be 60°±5° clockwise from north based on measuring the up-range "forbidden zone" (15) in the albedo ray pattern, and a down-range extended cluster of secondary impacts. We infer that the impactor approached the surface at an elevation angle of approximately 30° from horizontal. A steeper angle requires the asymmetric ejecta pattern to be muted, and a much shallower angle should have led to an elliptical crater planform (15,16). Two distinct arcuate rays ("scimitars") extending approximately northwest and south of the impact site likely formed from the superposition of two atmospheric blast waves disturbing surface dust: one generated by the passage of the meteoroid through the atmosphere (Mach cone) and the other by the ground impact (17), thus indicating both blast waves extended to at least 18 km laterally. These arcuate rays provide an independent though consistent measure of the impactor trajectory (56°). The meteoroid struck the surface at 18:49 LMST (Local Mean Solar Time) thus impacting on the orbital trailing side of Mars. We estimate the radial extent of surface dust disturbance from the crater to be 9 km (Fig. S3). This limit is consistent with the atmospheric blast pressure produced by a 0.1-1 kiloton (4×10 11 -4×10 12 J) surface explosive source (Fig. S4). The size of the atmospheric blast allows us to evaluate its contribution to the seismic signal.</p>
        <p>Crater size is an important quantity for estimating the kinetic energy and momentum of the impactor for use in numerical models. An image from another camera on MRO, the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) (18), revealed more details of the crater and its immediate surroundings (Fig. 2). The crater is irregular in shape with an estimated rim-to-rim diameter of 150±10 meters. The depth of the crater floor to the crater rim based on photogrammetry results using HiRISE stereo images is roughly 21 meters. The abundant craters surrounding the new impact are likely almost all secondaries generated by this primary impactor as in comparison areas far (&gt;10-20 km) from the new impact have few small craters. The bright patches and blocks surrounding the crater reveal that it excavated water ice from the subsurface at a lower latitude (35°N) than any prior ice-exposing crater (39°N) (19).</p>
        <p>The geological context from orbital imagery aids in determining the appropriate physical models to use in numerical calculations. The S1094b crater is in the Amazonis Planitia region in an area of rugged volcanic plains (20) with CTX images showing lava-flow morphologies mantled by a modest cover of debris. This indicates that a target ground with properties of porous fractured basalt is appropriate for modeling the surface impact. To account for a harder rock site at the crater compared to the region around InSight, we use a local subsurface velocity model based on terrestrial lava flows (21) extrapolated to Mars surface conditions (22,23) (Fig. S5; Fig. S6) for seismic modeling.</p>
        <p>The seismic source duration for an impact of this size is expected to be shorter than the crater formation timescale and limited to the duration of the non-linear shock wave propagation regime (6). The seismic event, S1094b, has a very broad frequency content and relatively flat spectra, from 0.1 Hz to 3 Hz (Fig. 3) with a signal lasting over 100 minutes (24) due to propagation coda (25). The event has an impulsive first arrival P-wave (1-sec uncertainty), followed by an emergent strong S-wave 6 min later (20-sec uncertainty). The third wave observed, arriving 8 min later, is a Rayleigh surface wave, expressed as a long-period dispersed pulse with 8-15 sec period (12). All body wave phases are characterized by a long coda, indicative of strong scattering due to a near-surface source. The spectra display unusually high corner frequencies (3 Hz) compared to most other seismic events recorded on Mars. Shock physics modeling of the impact in a porous fractured basalt target (Fig. 4) indicates that most of the seismic moment is contained within a few hundred meters of the impact (orange bar in Fig. 4A). The moment release occurs over a short time period consistent with the cutoff frequency of 3 Hz identified in the P-wave displacement spectrum (Fig. 3D). Above the cutoff frequency, the amplitude shows a cubed frequency drop-off, as also observed for closer, smaller impacts on Mars (8) and for shallow explosions on Earth (26,27).</p>
        <p>Seismic moment (M 0 ) is the key quantity that links the orbital observations of the impact and the impactor parameters to the seismic observations. For S1094b, the seismic moment estimate from S-body waves was originally calculated assuming a marsquake at 50±30 km depth to be 1.3×10 15 Nm. (28). However, the impact seismic source deposits its energy at much shallower depths, in the strongly shocked region, estimated to be between 17-and 120m depth from impact modeling, or approximately 50 m (Fig. 4B). We use our lava-flow seismic velocity model to conclude that the moment of a source at this depth is about 100 times smaller than a corresponding deep-crustal source for the same observed amplitude (Fig. 4A; Fig. S5). This is comparable to the seismic moment estimated from surface wave spectra, M 0 = 7.5×10 13 Nm, at the same source depth (Fig. S7).</p>
        <p>Empirical and numerical models were used to compute seismic moments for S1094b based on the observed crater size. The imaged crater diameter of 150±10 m corresponds to a vertical impactor momentum of 3.3±1.4×10 9 Ns based on empirical crater-scaling relationships and impactor mass, angle, and velocity probability distributions (Fig. S8; Fig. S9). For these values, numerical simulations predict seismic moments of 0.5-1.2×10 13 Nm for impacts in regolith and 2.8-7×10 13 Nm for fractured rock conditions (29,30). These estimates are consistent with the observed seismic moment corrected for relevant depths in our subsurface model (Fig. 4A). The seismic efficiency was estimated to be 10 -5 based on scaling relations between seismic moment and crater diameter (31) with an order of magnitude uncertainty. This is lower than values estimated for lunar and Earth analogues (32), but larger than that previously modeled for small martian impact craters (29).</p>
        <p>The extensive blast pattern around the S1094b crater suggests some of the seismic energy may also originate from energy released in the atmosphere and then coupled to the ground. Numerical impact simulations suggest that up to 10% of the impact energy is partitioned into kinetic energy on the planetary surface, primarily in the ejecta (33). For impact scenarios on Mars similar to S1094b, simulations with an atmosphere further suggest about 5% of the impact energy is partitioned into the blastwave (34). For an estimated impact energy of 1-8×10 13 J (Fig. S4), this could produce an atmospheric blast comparable to a 0.1-1 kT (4×10 11 -4×10 12 J) surface explosion. Therefore, both seismic and image observations are consistent with such a blast and provide coherent constraints in time and space respectively. Semi-empirical airblast theory (35) extrapolated to Mars suggests such a blast would transition from the strong shock regime after 0.2-0.4 sec, which is consistent with the observed ~3 Hz P-wave cut-off frequency. The induced blast pressure is sufficient to mobilize surface dust to a radius of ~10 km, which is consistent with the observed disturbed dust pattern (Fig. 1; Fig. S3; Fig. S4). The estimated blast energy translates to an atmospheric moment M 0 ≈ (γ-1)E = 0.1-1.3×10 12 Nm, where γ is the adiabatic index (1.33 for Mars) and E is the blast energy (36). This is remarkably consistent with the moment-depth model when extrapolated to the surface (Fig. 4A), implying that a moment of only 10 12 Nm released in the atmosphere could explain a substantial part of the seismic body wave signal, with the remaining part coming from direct coupling of the impactor with the ground.</p>
        <p>On Earth, atmospheric explosions easily excite surface waves (SW) (37) and are highly sensitive to burst altitude (38). Coupled solid/atmospheric Mars Rayleigh modes (14,39) are predicted to have excitation coefficients up to 10 times larger for a near-surface atmospheric source compared to one 50 m below the subsurface (Fig. S7). They are expected to have an increase in the excitation coefficients between 0.1 Hz and 0.15 Hz for sources above 50 meter altitude. This is not observed in the estimated S1094b spectra, and may be due to attenuation and scattering, which is not unexpected since scattering effects are predicted to generate increasing attenuation of surface waves with frequency on the Moon and Mars (40). Comparison of S1094b SW spectra with near surface excitation coefficients (Fig. S7) suggests that a portion of the SW signal could have originated from the blast just above the surface.</p>
        <p>The Marsquake Service (MQS) (41) using SEIS data (24) estimated the seismic locations for both events (S1094b and S1000a). The distance to the events is determined using S-minus-P arrival times (SS-minus-PP for S1000a) (42,43) and polarization measurements of P and Rayleigh waves (PP for S1000a) (12). For the closer event (S1094b), the epicentral distance from the InSight lander was estimated to be 59.7°±6.1° (3,530±360 km), as compared to the actual distance of 58.5 o (3460 km), a difference of only 70 km. For the second impact, S1000a, the distance was estimated at 128.3°±19° (7,591±1240 km), as compared to the actual distance of 126.1°, a difference of 130 km. Additional source parameters for these events are detailed in Tables S1 andS2.</p>
        <p>The close agreement between distance estimates and the imaged locations increases our confidence in the Martian seismic velocity models (44)(45)(46)(47)(48) for the regions sampled by the direct body waves (Fig. S10). In particular, the models indicate the absence of mantle discontinuities in the 600 to 700 km depth range, which is the depth at which the P, S, PP, and SS waves turn (44). For the S1000a event, the P diff phase, the P wave that diffracts along the core mantle boundary (CMB), has been tentatively identified (14). The PP-P diff travel time difference is sensitive to lower mantle P-velocities below 800 km. Current models at these depths are constrained by core reflected S phases and the mineral-physics-based V P /V S ratio (Fig. S10). The observed PP-P diff does not match the predicted values based on these models. This implies that either the P-velocities at the CMB need adjustment, or the V P /V S ratio in the lower mantle is different from current predictions. These two events act as calibrated measurements and help select among various Martian interior seismic velocity models (44)(45)(46)(47)(48); they corroborate Mars mantle velocity models to 800 km depth and will help to improve future models down to the CMB.</p>
        <p>The first two recorded teleseismic events on Mars with orbital ground-truth observations have been used to constrain Martian interior seismic velocity models and infer dynamic impact processes including seismic moment release, impact source duration, and atmospheresubsurface energy partitioning. The success in observing the formation of impact craters on Mars using instruments on several missions opens up a more detailed understanding of impact dynamics, atmospheric physics, and the exploration of planetary interiors.</p>

        <p>This study uses three imagers onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) (51) that has been orbiting Mars for the past 16 years. The Mars Color Imager (MARCI) is a lowresolution (1-4 km/px), wide-angle camera that acquires daily global maps of the surface and atmosphere (13). It is primarily intended for studying the atmosphere, but its daily coverage can provide tight temporal constraints on new large-scale phenomena. The Context Camera (CTX) has a 6deg FOV with a resolution of ~6m/px resulting in an image width of ~30km and up to ~250km along-track (9). The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) (18) has a resolution of 25 cm/px and FOV that results in a 5-km-wide image of the surface.</p>
        <p>The InSight mission monitors the seismicity of Mars in order to elucidate the interior structure and formation of the red planet (11). In order to achieve this,

            <rs type="software">InSight</rs> includes a full weather station (52), though due to power constraints, it was not operational at the time of the seismic events discussed. Throughout the mission so far, SEIS operates as expected, achieving and exceeding its target noise levels (25).

        <p>Table S2 is a summary of the seismic characteristics of the two impacts: S1094b (left column) and S1000a (right column). Information is from MQS (41,43). The distance and back azimuth probability density functions (PDF) for each event with error estimates are also provided. For the uncertainty estimates, we first normalize the individual PDFs by their maximum. Then we fit a univariate spline to these discrete PDFs to account for the distribution skewness. Finally, the error bounds (orange shaded regions) are calculated from the zero-crossings at a baseline of 75% from the maxima, assuming these values represent the 2-𝜎 uncertainties. The indicated mean errors are the arithmetic means of the bounds in square brackets. The final location error is shown on a map view, where combined probabilities below 0.05 are masked for visual clarity. proportional to f -4 , high-frequency roll-off. This slope likely exceeds the source roll off, but accounts for effects of attenuation which has therefore erased the source information. The long-period plateau from which the magnitude is computed is at A0=-185dB (28). See (14) for a detailed discussion of the phase picks and other seismic aspects of this event.</p>
        <p>Impact Site Imagery for S1000a showing the log ratio between before and after impact CTX images. Images were map projected and scaled to minimize the RMS of the log ratio away from the blast zone; the color map shows relative variations in albedo between images. The log ratio tends to zero (log(1)) at far distances, as expected. In the residual image, the extent of the albedo disturbance from the bolide blast wave is evident to the southwest. The two, slightly arcuate rays ("scimitars" labeled 'bolide+blast waves 1 and 2') are visible with the northwestern ray extending to at least 18 km. These are believed to follow the intersection of the conical blast wave from the hypervelocity bolide and the hemispherical atmospheric blast created upon impact (17). Because the two blast waves are likely symmetrical, the angle between the rays can be used to estimate the impactor's direction of travel (55 o ). The ring of dark linear rays (red) surrounding the crater displays a classic asymmetrical pattern associated with oblique impactors (15). This provides another method to estimate the direction of travel. To estimate the extent of the "forbidden zone" in a systematic manner, we average the residual albedo across the annulus (labeled 𝞷) that contains the highest concentration of dark linear rays. (B)</p>
        <p>The radial averaged log ratio albedo residual over annulus 𝞷 versus azimuth. The edges of the "forbidden zone" are chosen at the steepest slopes in the residual plot. This results in a 70 o arc for the forbidden zone (at 1-2 km radius). Bisecting the angle results in a trajectory estimate of 62 o clockwise from north. This is in rough agreement with the scimitar ray estimate. The travel direction is further confirmed by the concentration of rays in the downrange direction as expected for an oblique impact between 55 o and 60 o from north. (C)</p>
        <p>The azimuthal averaged log ratio albedo residual versus radial distance from the central crater. In order to estimate the size of the atmospheric blast, a measure of the blast zone that can be related to blast energy is needed. Semi-empirical airblast theory (35) extrapolated to Mars -a relation between radial wind speed and blast size (Fig. S4). Combining this relation with approximate minimum thresholds for the removal of surface dust provides a mechanism for determining the rough size of the blast. We examine the albedo residual map to estimate the limit of dust disturbance by the impact blast. In order to make this less subjective, we average the albedo residual over azimuth and examine the ratio versus radial distance. A break in the slope at 9 km makes for a reasonable estimate for the dust disturbance limit. This is consistent with the predicted limits in Fig. S4.</p>
        <p>(CTX image IDs: G18_025234_2165_XN_36N170W &amp; U05_073077_2154_XI_35N170W). and the assumption that the seismic source is in a crustal medium with V P =6000 m/s and V S =3500 m/s (42). However, the S1094b source is at shallow depth thus we need to correct the MQS moment estimate. Since P-wave amplitude depends on the medium around the source (57), we need a velocity model (blue) for the correction. We adopt a lava-flow velocity model (58) with the crustal medium as the half-space starting at 10 km depth (59).</p>
        <p>10</p>
        <p>To achieve the correct seismic moment for a source above the half-space, we calculate the Pwave amplitude (A) in the half-space from the source as</p>
        <p>where M s is the seismic moment at the source depth; ρ s and α s are the density and P-wave velocity of the medium around the source, respectively. T is the P-wave transmission coefficient from the source to the half-space (57) and we use a vertically down-going P wave. The second equality sign means that the amplitude from the shallow source is equal to that from the source at depth given by the MQS moment, M c . ρ c and α c are the density and Pwave velocity in the crustal half-space, respectively. Thus, the source moment is written as</p>
        <p>We apply the above equation to each depth above the half-space (black). For the seismic source in the Martian atmosphere (i.e., the impact airblast), we expand the above calculation to the air density (0.015 kg/m 3 ) and acoustic-wave velocity (220 m/s) to calculate the 10 corresponding acoustic moment in the atmosphere. These acoustic or seismic moments in the air or at each depth can generate the same P-wave amplitude in the crustal half-space as the MQS moment (Fig. 4A). Excavation depth is up to 10 m made within 2.5 seconds. The final crater formed within 8 seconds. This iSALE-2D simulation was made using a 5-m diameter basalt projectile at 12 km/s vertical impact speed. The target was assumed to be fractured bedrock used in previous works (63). Considering that the observed crater is irregular in morphology, and likely made under an oblique impact incidence into a heterogeneous medium, the simulated crater represents a simplified model that connects estimated impact conditions with the expected crater size. It is possible that some post-impact slumping could cause the reduction of crater depth and slightly extend crater diameter.</p>
        <p>seismic moment is 7.5×10 13 Nm. Note that this seismic moment is a lower bound for the Rayleigh wave, as the 3D scattering effects will further reduce the amplitude. (B) The amplification ratios are the normal-mode amplitude ratios between the 50-m-depth source and three atmospheric sources at different altitudes. The normal modes for the atmospheric sources are computed with the Mars atmosphere model (66,67) following (39), integrating both a radiating boundary condition at the top of the atmosphere and viscosity and relaxation of the CO2 atmosphere. See more details on such normal-mode computation for Mars in (39) and (32). Amplification with source altitude is largely dependent on the upward acoustic propagation of the Rayleigh wave which depends on ℜ 𝑖 ⋅ 𝑒 !!!"#/! for excitation coefficients (68,69), where c is the acoustic sound speed, z is the altitude, and f is the frequency. This amplification is not observed in the S1094b SW spectrum between 0.1 Hz and 0.15 Hz. Instead, the amplitude roughly decays proportional to f -2 . The shape of the surface wave spectra, including amplitude modulation features, is closer to the source located near the surface as compared to below the surface or substantially above the surface. This observation suggests a larger seismic moment release near the surface.</p>
        <p>target density. The effect of target cohesion is minimal at the size of the newly discovered crater (gray shading). The estimated range of vertical impactor momentum is 2-8 × 10 9 Ns. Fragmentation of the meteoroid is neglected. For the range of likely impact scenarios, the 10 effect of atmospheric deceleration is negligible.</p>

        <p>Fig. S7. Surface wave seismic moment estimation. (A) Seismic moment estimation of S1094b surface wave spectral amplitude and (B) the surface-wave amplification ratios of atmospheric sources relative to a 50-m-depth source. We measure the S1094b surface-wave vertical-component spectra from three time windows (300/400/500-s-long) starting at 1,150 s after the event origin. Maximum and minimum of the three spectra at each frequency are shown in red. We use these long time windows for high spectral resolution. To check the effect of a short time window, we use 40-s-long time windows from 1,150s to 1,650s after the origin time with 10% overlap between two adjacent time windows; the mean value of these spectra is plotted in a red dotted line. The seismic noise is computed from three time windows (300/400/500-s-long) ending at 1,150 s, and we plot the maxima in black. We compute wind noise in the vertical component by assuming the long-period horizontal component is due to wind. Thus, we estimate the wind noise (gray) using the compliance theory (64) and a 2-m/s environmental wind speed. The wind speed is from fitting the elliptical part of the vertical-and horizontal-component data before 1,150 s. The synthetic surface-wave spectral amplitude (blue) is obtained from normal mode summation (65), where normal modes are computed for the lava-flow model (58) with a source at 50 m depth. The Predicted differential travel times were calculated using the "

The bottom row includes three additional post-launch families of models (44,(46)(47)(48). This illustrates the calibration capability of the two impacts for improving velocity models corresponding to the P, S, PP, SS paths, sensitive down to about 800 km. The S1000a P diff phase is the first seismic wave we have detected on Mars that is sensitive to P-velocities between 800 km and the CMB (14). Current models estimate P-velocities below 800 km by using S-velocity models that were constrained based on ScS seismic waves and V P /V S ratios estimated from mineralogical and geodynamical models, e.g. (44,(46)(47)(48).

        <p>We note a significant offset of at least 20 seconds between observations and models. A portion of the time residual (5-10 sec) could be related to the larger crustal thickness at the epicenter and the PP reflection point compared to the crustal thickness predicted at InSight and Cerberus Fossae (74). The remaining time residual is a key datum to constrain P-velocity models below 800 km.</p>
