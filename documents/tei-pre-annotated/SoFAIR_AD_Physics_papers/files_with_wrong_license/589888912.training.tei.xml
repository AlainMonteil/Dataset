        <p>Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) candidates at z  10 are rapidly being identified in James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRCam observations. Due to the (redshifted) break produced by neutral hydrogen absorption of restframe UV photons, these sources are expected to drop out in the bluer filters while being well detected in redder filters. However, here we show that dust-enshrouded star-forming galaxies at lower redshifts (z  7) may also mimic the near-infrared (near-IR) colors of z &gt; 10 LBGs, representing potential contaminants in LBG candidate samples. First, we analyze CEERS-DSFG-1, a NIRCam dropout undetected in the F115W and F150W filters but detected at longer wavelengths. Combining the JWST data with (sub)millimeter constraints, including deep NOEMA interferometric observations, we show that this source is a dusty star-forming galaxy (DSFG) at z ≈ 5.1. We also present a tentative 2.6σ SCUBA-2 detection at 850 μm around a recently identified z ≈ 16 LBG candidate in the same field and show that, if the emission is real and associated with this candidate, the available photometry is consistent with a z ∼ 5 dusty galaxy with strong nebular emission lines despite its blue near-IR colors.

        <p>observations on this candidate are imperative to mitigate the low confidence of this tentative submillimeter emission and its positional uncertainty. Our analysis shows that robust (sub)millimeter detections of NIRCam dropout galaxies likely imply z ∼ 4-6 redshift solutions, where the observed near-IR break would be the result of a strong rest-frame optical Balmer break combined with high dust attenuation and strong nebular line emission, rather than the rest-frame UV Lyman break. This provides evidence that DSFGs may contaminate searches for ultra-high redshift LBG candidates from JWST observations.

        <p>The superb sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) coupled with its high angular resolution and its nearinfrared (near-IR) detectors (Rigby et al. 2022) provides a unique view of the universe previously invisible to other telescopes, from nearby star-forming regions to the farthest, faintest galaxies ever found. In the field of extragalactic astronomy, JWST allows us to extend the Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) selection technique beyond z  11, the redshift at which the Lyman break is redshifted beyond the reach of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) coverage (Hubble serving as the previous workhorse instrument for the identification of such galaxies before the arrival of JWST; see reviews by Finkelstein 2016;Stark 2016;Robertson 2022 and references therein).The superb sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) coupled with its high angular resolution and its nearinfrared (near-IR) detectors (Rigby et al. 2022) provides a unique view of the universe previously invisible to other telescopes, from nearby star-forming regions to the farthest, faintest galaxies ever found.

        <p>The identification of very high-redshift LBGs has strong implications for our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. For example, the confirmation of large numbers of z &gt; 11 galaxies can provide strong constraints on the formation epoch of the first galaxies and their star formation efficiencies. Their existence can shed light on the dark matter halo mass function in the early universe, particularly with the presence of very luminous sources found 400 Myr after the Big Bang (e.g., Behroozi et al. 2019).The identification of very high-redshift LBGs has strong implications for our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.

        <p>In the first few days after the release of the first JWST observations, an increasing number of samples of LBG candidates at z  10 were identified (Adams et al. 2023;Atek et al. 2023;Castellano et al. 2022;Donnan et al. 2023;Finkelstein et al. 2022a;Harikane et al. 2022;Naidu et al. 2022;Yan et al. 2023). The abundance and masses of these sources start to be in tension with the predictions from most galaxy formation models (Boylan-Kolchin 2022; Finkelstein et al. 2022a;Lovell et al. 2023). Nevertheless, the observed colors for some of these very high-redshift candidates may be degenerated with other populations of galaxies at lower redshifts. This results from confusion between the Lyα forest break at z &gt; 12 with the Balmer and the 4000 Å breaks combined with dust attenuation and/or strong nebular emission. This means that dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at significantly lower redshifts (z  6-7) can mimic the JWST/ NIRCam colors of z  10 LBGs, particularly in the shortestwavelength filters. While models tend to assume these galaxies are universally red in color, thus distinguishable from the typically very blue LBGs, the complex environments of the interstellar medium (ISM) within DSFGs plus contamination from nebular emission lines could lead to a mix of observed near-IR colors (Howell et al. 2010;Casey et al. 2014b), further obfuscating the secure identification of ultra-high redshift LBGs. The phenomenon of DSFGs contaminating highredshift LBG searches is, in fact, not new to JWST, as often z ∼ 2-3 DSFGs were found to contaminate z ∼ 6-8 LBG samples selected by HST (e.g., Dunlop et al. 2007); here, both the contaminants (DSFGs at z ∼ 4-6) and LBG targets (z ∼ 10-20) for JWST have shifted to higher redshifts.In the first few days after the release of the first JWST observations, an increasing number of samples of LBG candidates at z  10 were identified (Adams et al. 2023;Atek et al. 2023;Castellano et al. 2022;Donnan et al. 2023;Finkelstein et al. 2022a;Harikane et al. 2022;Naidu et al. 2022;Yan et al. 2023).

        <p>The secure identification of LBGs is thus important not only to quantify the contamination fraction in z  10 LBG samples (which could relax the observed tension between observations and model predictions) but also to constrain the volume density and physical properties of early massive quiescent galaxies and high-redshift DSFGs, an important step toward our ultimate goal of understanding galaxy formation and evolution. However, distinguishing these galaxies from other populations has proven challenging and requires spectroscopic or multiwavelength observations probing the older stellar populations (for the quiescent systems) or the dust thermal emission (for DSFGs).The secure identification of LBGs is thus important not only to quantify the contamination fraction in z  10 LBG samples (which could relax the observed tension between observations and model predictions) but also to constrain the volume density and physical properties of early massive quiescent galaxies and high-redshift DSFGs, an important step toward our ultimate goal of understanding galaxy formation and evolution.

        <p>Here, we use JCMT/SCUBA-2 850 μm and NOEMA 1.1 mm interferometric observations, in combination with the JWST data from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey (Finkelstein et al. 2017;Bagley et al. 2022;S.

We report on a galaxy, CEERS-DSFG-1, that is undetected in the NIRCam F115W and F150W filters, but whose photometric redshift is well constrained to be around z = 5 after including (sub)millimeter data. We also study the z ∼ 16.7 candidate, CEERS-93316, reported in Donnan et al. (2023), for which we find a tentative 2.6σ detection at 850 μm, and show that, if this emission is real and associated with this source, it would imply a lower-redshift solution around z ∼ 5. Finally, we examine all the available long-wavelength (mid-IR to millimeter) observations around the z ≈ 12 candidate known as Maisie's galaxy (Finkelstein et al. 2022a), finding no evidence of continuum emission.Here, we use JCMT/SCUBA-2 850 μm and NOEMA 1.1 mm interferometric observations, in combination with the JWST data from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey (Finkelstein et al. 2017;Bagley et al. 2022;S.

            <rs type="software">NOEMA</rs> continuum observations on a sample of 19 DSFG candidates in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) field in preparation for CEERS JWST data, as part of the NOEMA Program W20CK (PIs: Buat and Zavala). The targets were selected from the original sample reported in Zavala et al. (2017Zavala et al. ( , 2018b) ) based on deep observations at both 450 and 850 μm obtained with the SCUBA-2 camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). Here, we only focus on CEERS-DSFG-1 (known as 850.027 in Zavala et al. 2017Zavala et al. , 2018b)). The rest of the observations, along with a detailed description of the sample selection, will be presented elsewhere (L. Ciesla et al. 2022, in preparation).

        <p>NOEMA observations were performed using the wideband correlator Polyfix covering the frequency ranges 252.5-260 GHz (with the lower side band) and 268-275.5 GHz (with the upper side band). The on-source integration time varies from ∼10 to ∼50 minutes and was determined based on the 850 μm flux densities of each target. For the main target of this Letter, CEERS-DSFG-1, the on-source integration time was around 25 minutes. Calibration and imaging of the uv visibilities were then performed with GILDAS, 86 producing continuum maps with 0 15 × 0 15 pixels centered at 270 GHz. For CEERS-DSFG-1, the achieved rms is measured to be σ 1.1 mm = 0.10 mJy beam -1 , and the beam size is 1 35 × 0 85. The continuum flux density at 1.1 mm was extracted using an aperture of 1.5× the beam size to recover any potential extended emission resolved by the beam.NOEMA observations were performed using the wideband correlator Polyfix covering the frequency ranges 252.5-260 GHz (with the lower side band) and 268-275.5 GHz (with the upper side band).

        <p>We performed a detailed reduction as described in Bagley et al. (2022) and Finkelstein et al. (2022b). What follows is a brief summary of the main steps, and we refer the reader to these two papers for more details. We used version 1.7.2 of the JWST Calibration Pipeline,87 with custom modifications. Raw images were processed through Stages 1 and 2 of the pipeline, which apply detector-level corrections, flat-fielding, and photometric flux calibration. We also applied a custom step to measure and remove 1/f noise. We align the F200W images to an HST/WFC3 F160W reference catalog created from 0 03 pixel -1 mosaics in the EGS field with astrometry tied to Gaia-EDR3 (see Koekemoer et al. 2011 for more details about the methodology). We then aligned each NIRCam filter to F200W, achieving a median astrometric offset 0 005. Our steps represent an initial reduction that will be iteratively improved with updates to the Calibration Pipeline and reference files.We performed a detailed reduction as described in Bagley et al.

        <p>The flux extraction was done following S. Finkelstein et al. (2022, in preparation). Briefly, we use a multiwavelength photometric catalog created with Source Extractor (Bertin &amp; Arnouts 1996), that was created with a sum of F277W+F356W as the detection image, with colors measured in small Kron apertures on images PSF-matched to F444W. Total fluxes were estimated following an aperture correction based on a ratio between a large Kron (MAG_AUTO) flux and the small Kron flux in the F444W image, with an additional correction for missing light in the large aperture based on simulations. Finally, a systematic offset of 1%-5% was applied based on comparing the colors of best-fitting model templates to the photometry for ∼800 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies.The flux extraction was done following S.

        <p>The subarcsecond positional accuracy of the 
            <rs type="software">NOEMA</rs> observations allows us to directly identify the submillimeterselected galaxy, CEERS-DSFG-1, in the JWST/NIRCam observations (see Figure 1) without any ambiguity. Interestingly, CEERS-DSFG-1 is well detected in F200W and redder bands but abruptly drops out in F150W and F115W and in all the HST filters, as can be seen in Figure 2. The dropout nature of this source satisfies some of the color criteria to identify z &gt; 10 galaxy candidates. Indeed, it satisfies the criterion of m 150Wm 200W &gt; 0.8 used in Yan et al. (2023), and some (but not all) of the criteria used in Donnan et al. (2023), with a 2σ nondetection in F115W and F150W, and &gt;3σ detections in redder filters (see Figure 2 and Table 1). However, the identification of this source as a DSFG calls into question such a very high-redshift scenario, given that the highest-redshift dust continuum detections ever reported are at z ∼ 7-8 (Laporte et al. 2017;Strandet et al. 2017;Marrone et al. 2018;Tamura et al. 2019;Inami et al. 2022). Moreover, the (sub)millimeter emission would imply an extreme infrared (IR) luminosity in excess of ∼10 13 L e and a large dust mass in tension with current models. This is thoroughly discussed in Appendix A, where we show that relatively bright (sub)millimeter sources are unlikely to lie at z &gt; 10.

        <p>Here we conduct a more thorough investigation as to the possible redshift of CEERS-DSFG-1 using JWST constraints alone, (sub)millimeter constraints alone, and a combination of both JWST and long-wavelength millimeter data. The results are highly dependent on the available photometric constraints and the inferred redshifts differ significantly, as discussed below in this section.Here we conduct a more thorough investigation as to the possible redshift of CEERS-DSFG-1 using JWST constraints alone, (sub)millimeter constraints alone, and a combination of both JWST and long-wavelength millimeter data.

        <p>We first fit the SED of CEERS-DSFG-1 to JWST/NIRCam photometry alone using the EAZY (Brammer et al. 2008) SED fitting code.

        <p>Assuming the best-fit redshift of z = 5.1, the stellar mass of CEERS-DSFG-1 is constrained to be (2.1 ± 0.8) × 10 10 M ☉ . This is a factor of ∼4 smaller than the average mass of DSFGs detected by single-dish telescopes (e.g., da Cunha et al. 2015), but is aligned with expectations since our source was selected from one of the deepest SCUBA-2 850 μm surveys and has a fainter 850 μm flux density than typical galaxies identified in shallower single-dish telescope surveys. Indeed, the stellar mass of our target is in better agreement with other SCUBA-2 galaxies identified in this field, which have an average stellar mass of ≈5.6 × 10 10 M ☉ (Cardona-Torres et al. 2022), and with the masses derived for galaxies identified in recent deeper Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) surveys (e.g., Gómez-Guijarro et al. 2022; see also Khusanova et al. 2021). Similarly, the star formation rate (SFR) of CEERS-DSFG-1 of 110 ± 30 M ☉ yr -1 (averaged over the past 10 Myr) lie between those from submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) and fainter DSFGs identified in deeper ALMA observations (da Cunha et al. 2015;Zavala et al. 2018a;Aravena et al. 2020;Casey et al. 2021;Khusanova et al. 2021;Gómez-Guijarro et al. 2022). These properties imply a specific star formation rate of sSFR = 5.2 ± 2.5 Gyr -1 , meaning that CEERS-DSFG-1 lies on the main sequence of star-forming galaxies, similar to the so-called population of "HST-dark" galaxies88 (e.g., Wang et al. 2019).Assuming the best-fit redshift of z = 5.1, the stellar mass of CEERS-DSFG-1 is constrained to be (2.1 ± 0.8) × 10 10 M ☉ .

        <p>To complement these results, we test the reliability of these low signal-to-noise ratio peaks by creating a catalog of 2.5σ to 3.0σ SCUBA-2 sources and searching for counterparts in the deep VLA 3 GHz map (Dickinson, private communication).

        <p>First, we consider what the implications would be if CEERS-93316 had significant dust emission at its proposed redshift of z = 16.7. The observed 850 μm emission would probe the restframe ∼50 μm regime; in this scenario, the IR luminosity would be above 10 12 L e with a dust mass of ∼10 8 M e . A system with such high dust mass found ∼230 Myr after the Big Bang would surely be extraordinary, likely implausibly so (e.g., Dwek et al. 2014). This is further discussed in Appendix A, where we show the predicted IR luminosity and dust mass as a function of redshift for a hypothetical submillimeter detection with a flux density similar to that of the tentative emission discussed here.First, we consider what the implications would be if CEERS-93316 had significant dust emission at its proposed redshift of z = 16.7.

From the lack of clear detections, we can rule out an obvious alternate radio or 24 μm counterpart for the 850 μm emission at z  3, while we cannot rule out galaxies at z  3 since they are usually undetected at these wavelengths. The marginal 8 μm emitter on the top right (west) of CEERS-93316 is a potential counterpart, but the current data are unconstraining.</p>

The resulting SED is shown in Figure 7 along with the best-fit z ∼ 16 SEDs from EAZY and CIGALE, for comparison. In the low-redshift scenario, the strong break seen between F200W and F277W in CEERS-93316 is attributable to strong [OIII] and Hβ emission in the F277W band (see Figure 7). Similarly, the excess flux in F356W above the continuum, which produces a blue F356W-F410M color, would be attributable to Hα emission. The measured NIRCam photometry would thus require a young starburst with strong nebular line emission to satisfy a z ∼ 4.8 solution, but this would be within the realm of expectation for an early-stage DSFG in formation at these redshifts.To further explore the feasibility of this alternative redshift solution, we rerun CIGALE but fix the redshift to z = 4.8.

        <p>While deep interferometric observations at millimeter wavelengths are required to confirm or refute dust continuum emission in this high-redshift candidate, here we show (see also Appendix A) that a z ∼ 4.8 scenario associated with a DSFG with strong nebular emission is plausible for CEERS-93316 and highly likely if the submillimeter emission is confirmed, despite its blue near-IR colors that are usually associated with the emission of dust-free systems (e.g., Finkelstein 2016, and references therein). If this lower-redshift solution is true, it would contrast with the low probability of being at z &lt; 15 inferred from the different redshift probability distributions shown in Figure 6 (see also Donnan et al. 2023;Finkelstein et al. 2022b). The reason for this low probability might be related to the low significance of the tentative SCUBA-2 detection in the case of CIGALE or with the adopted templates and the fitting approach for EAZY.

        <p>Because this source is not covered by our NOEMA observations, we started by looking at the deep SCUBA-2 850 μm map (Zavala et al. 2017). As shown in Figure 8 no significant detection is found (with a measured flux density of S 850 = -0.40 ± 0.25 mJy at the position of the source). We also search for significant emission in the Spitzer 8 μm and 24 μm map; Herschel 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 μm imaging; and SCUBA-2 450 μm observations, finding only nondetections. We thus conclude that a lower-redshift scenario for Maisie's galaxy in which the source is rather associated with a DSFG is unlikely. Given the lack of far-infrared-to-submillimeter detections, the best-fit SEDs and their associated redshift probability distributions for Maisie's galaxy would be similar to those reported in Finkelstein et al. (2022a). Hence, to avoid duplication, they are not included in this Letter.Because this source is not covered by our NOEMA observations, we started by looking at the deep SCUBA-2 850 μm map (Zavala et al. 2017).

        <p>Using the available data sets from the JWST CEERS survey in combination with NOEMA and SCUBA-2 observations, we have demonstrated that DSFGs at z ∼ 4-6 can drop out in the bluest JWST/NIRCam filters while being well detected in the redder filters. This kind of galaxies could even show a significant probability of being at high redshifts when performing SED fittings. This is illustrated by studying the source CEERS-DSFG-1, a 850 μm-selected galaxy with robust interferometric observations at 1.1 mm by 
            <rs type="software">NOEMA</rs> that is undetected in the F115W and F150W bands. A joint SED fitting analysis including the NIRCam constraints and the long-wavelength (sub)millimeter data implies a photometric redshift of -+ 5.09 0.72 0.62 , with physical properties that resemble other DSFGs: M å = (2.1 ± 0.8) × 10 10 M e ; SFR = 110 ± 30 M e yr -1 ; L dust = (1.1 ± 0.3) × 10 12 L ☉ . Hence, searches of z &gt; 10 LBGs that rely only on a dropout selection could introduce significant contaminants from lower-redshift systems. This could be minimized by adopting multicolor selection criteria or by defining alternative conditions (such as a minimum redshift probability or χ 2 goodness-of-fit; e.g., Adams et al. 2023;Castellano et al. 2022;Donnan et al. 2023;Finkelstein et al. 2022a;Harikane et al. 2022). The EAZY and CIGALE fits to the JWST photometry alone are represented by the orange and red lines, respectively. The two fits suggest a high redshift around ∼16.3, in agreement with Donnan et al. (2023). The addition of the tentative submillimeter emission to the CIGALE fit does not alter the main peak of the distribution, although it increases the probability at z ∼ 4.8 as illustrated by the green shaded area. This lower-redshift solution is in good agreement with the results from EAZY when imposing a maximum redshift at z = 10 (cyan line). As thoroughly discussed in the main text, if the tentative 850 μm emission is real and associated with CEERS-93316, our analysis suggests that this high-redshift galaxy candidate rather lies at a lower redshift around z ∼ 4.8.

        <p>Taking advantage of the available submillimeter data in the field, we extended the search for dust continuum emission to two close z &gt; 10 LBG candidates recently reported, CEERS-93316 at z ≈ 16.7 (Donnan et al. 2023) and Maisie's galaxy at z ≈ 11.8 (Finkelstein et al. 2022a). We found a tentative 2.6σ detection at 850 μm around the position of CEERS-93316. A confirmation of this flux density measurement and a firm spatial association requires higher-resolution submillimeter imaging. This is particularly important given its high probability of being spurious and the large beam size (≈14 6) of the SCUBA-2 observations that encompass several galaxies.Taking advantage of the available submillimeter data in the field, we extended the search for dust continuum emission to two close z &gt; 10 LBG candidates recently reported, CEERS-93316 at z ≈ 16.7 (Donnan et al. 2023) and Maisie's galaxy at z ≈ 11.8 (Finkelstein et al. 2022a).

        <p>While additional observations are required to corroborate this identification, we use this possible association to illustrate that z ∼ 5 DSFGs can also exhibit blue colors in the JWST/ NIRCam bands when strong nebular emission lines are present (with line fluxes on the order of ∼10 -18 -10 -17 erg s -1 cm -2 ), and conclude that (sub)millimeter emission in samples of z &gt; 10 LBGs likely implies misidentifications of DSFGs at lower redshifts (z  7).

        <p>For these calculations, we adopt a modified blackbody distribution with a dust emissivity index of β = 1.8 for the dust SED (e.g., Casey 2012). Two different dust temperatures of 35 and 75 K are explored. Then, the IR luminosity at a given redshift is estimated by, first, scaling the redshifted SED to the 850 μm flux density and, second, integrating over 8-1000 μm (in the rest frame). The cosmic microwave background (CMB) effects on the observed flux density are also taken into account following da Cunha et al. (2013). The inferred IR luminosity as a function of redshift for a S 850 μm = 1 mJy dust detection is shown in the left panel of Figure 9. The corresponding dustobscured SFR estimated directly from the IR luminosity (Kennicutt &amp; Evans 2012) is also indicated on the right axis. Then, we calculate the dust mass as follows. At a given redshift, we estimate the rest-frame 850 μm flux density, S 850 μm,rest , from the scaled SED described above (which takes into account the CMB effects) and use the following equation: As clearly seen in Figure 9, a dust continuum detection of S 850 μm ∼ 1 mJy (or S 1.1 mm ∼ 0.4 mJy) at z &gt; 10 would imply a SFR in excess of ∼100 M e yr -1 , rapidly reaching ∼1000 M e yr -1 at z ∼ 15 (depending on the adopted temperature). This SFR is significantly higher than what is measured in any z  8 object and around 2 orders of magnitude higher than the SFRs inferred for JWST-selected candidates. In the right panel of Figure 9, the inferred dust mass is compared with the maximum mass limit allowed by a ΛCDM universe (which depends on redshift and survey volume92 ). To estimate this limit, we use the halo mass function from the Harrison &amp; Hotchkiss (2013) scaling; first, the halo mass down by a factor of 20 (following Marrone et al. 2018; see also Casey et al. 2021) to approximate the corresponding galaxy ISM mass, and, second, by a factor of 100, which corresponds to the ISM-to-dust ratio typically measured in massive galaxies (e.g., Magdis et al. 2012;Rémy-Ruyer et al. 2014;Scoville et al. 2016). As shown in the figure, within the volume probed by the CEERS observations, a submillimeter detection at z  6 start to be in tension (at 1σ level) with the maximum mass limit inferred from the halo mass function (when adopting T d = 35 K). This could be slightly alleviated if the dust temperature is higher. Nevertheless, Scoville et al. (2016) argue that, even when the luminosity-weighted dust temperature could be higher at higher redshifts (e.g., Faisst et al. 2017;Bakx et al. 2020;Sommovigo et al. 2022), the mass-weighted temperature is usually cold (≈25-35 K). Furthermore, even adopting the results from this relatively high dust temperature at face value, the implied dust masses exceed the expected mass limit at z  12, implying that such a system is unlikely to exist.For these calculations, we adopt a modified blackbody distribution with a dust emissivity index of β = 1.8 for the dust SED (e.g., Casey 2012).
