        <p>Black holes with hair represented by generic fields surrounding the central source of the vacuum Schwarzschild metric are examined under the minimal set of requirements consisting of i) the existence of a well defined event horizon, namely, we require the Killing horizon coincides with the causal horizon and ii) the strong or dominant energy condition for the hair outside the horizon. We develop our analysis by means of the gravitational decoupling approach. We find that trivial deformations of the seed Schwarzschild vacuum preserve the energy conditions and provide a new mechanism to evade the no-hair theorem based on a primary hair associated with the charge generating these transformations. Under the above conditions i) and ii), this charge consistently increases the entropy from the minimum value given by the Schwarzschild geometry. As a direct application, we find a non-trivial extension of the Reissner-Nordström black hole showing a surprisingly simple horizon.

        <p>Black holes are among the most extraordinary objects in the Universe. The direct observations of black holes through the detection of gravitational waves [1,2] and the reconstruction of the black hole shadow [3] have definitely raised them from being exotic solutions of general relativity, to the status of real astrophysical systems with well determined characteristics.Black holes are among the most extraordinary objects in the Universe.

        <p>The original no-hair conjecture states that black hole solutions should not carry any other charges [4] except three fundamental parameters, namely the mass M , angular momentum J and electric charge Q [5]. However, there could exist other charges associated with inner gauge symmetries (and fields), and it is now known that black holes could also have (soft) quantum hair [6]. The general existence of hairy black hole solutions is precisely the topic under study in this article.The original no-hair conjecture states that black hole solutions should not carry any other charges [4] except three fundamental parameters, namely the mass M , angular momentum J and electric charge Q [5].

        <p>For a long time different scenarios have been studied for circumventing the no-hair theorem (see Refs. [7][8][9][10][11][12][13] for some recent works and Refs. [14][15][16][17] for earlier works). For instance, scalar fields have played a preponderant role, mainly due to their simplicity and also in analogy with particle physics and cosmology (see also Refs. [18][19][20] and references therein). In this paper, following our previous work [21], instead of considering specific fundamental fields to generate hair in black holes, we shall just assume the presence of a generic source in addition to the one generating the vacuum Schwarzschild geometry. We then impose a minimal set of conditions we expect should hold for hairy black holes, namely: i) we require that the system has a well-defined event horizon and ii) the additional source is described by a conserved energy-momentum tensor θ µν which satisfies either the strong (SEC) or the dominant energy condition (DEC) in the region outside the event horizon.For a long time different scenarios have been studied for circumventing the no-hair theorem (see Refs.

        <p>From the technical point of view, we will also assume the energy-momentum tensor θ µν is decoupled from the vacuum by means of the extended gravitational decoupling method (EGD henceforth) of Ref. [22]. This approach was originally introduced in Ref. [23] in the form of the so-called minimal geometric deformation (MGD) [24,25] (for some earlier works on the MGD, see for instance Refs. [26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37], and Refs. [38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52][53][54][55][56] for some recent applications). Analogously to the electro-vacuum and scalar-vacuum cases, in this work we will thus consider a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a spherically symmetric "tensor-vacuum", represented by the aforementioned θ µν . Following the EGD, we can separate the complete Einstein field equations and obtain the "quasi-Einstein" equations for θ µν [See Eqs. ( 20)- (22) below]. These are precisely the equations of motion for the deformed Schwarzschild vacuum, which after decoupling, contains five unknown functions that can be further analysed by imposing the two conditions discussed above. Finally, we want to emphasize that this is the first work in which we investigate black hole geometries by means of the EGD starting from general physical requirements on the horizon and black hole hair. We will show that, when we apply this approach to the Schwarzschild metric, the deformation leads to known results, namely, the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole or at best, the wellknown Kiselev black hole [57]. The reason is that evading the no-hair theorem in a physically sensible way is a very non-trivial task.From the technical point of view, we will also assume the energy-momentum tensor θ µν is decoupled from the vacuum by means of the extended gravitational decoupling method (EGD henceforth) of Ref.

        <p>The paper is organised as follows: in Section II, we first review the fundamentals of the EGD approach to a spherically symmetric system containing two sources; in Section III, after imposing a simple condition to guarantee a well defined horizon, and after considering the strong and dominant energy conditions on θ µν , we show a new way to evade the no-hair theorem. We apply this to generate two new families of hairy black holes containing primary hairs. As a special case, we show a nontrivial extension of the Reissner-Nordström black hole associated with a non-linear electrodynamics; finally, we summarize our conclusions in Section IV.The paper is organised as follows: in Section II, we first review the fundamentals of the EGD approach to a spherically symmetric system containing two sources; in Section III, after imposing a simple condition to guarantee a well defined horizon, and after considering the strong and dominant energy conditions on θ µν , we show a new way to evade the no-hair theorem.

        <p>In this Section, we briefly review the EGD for spherically symmetric gravitational systems described in detail in Ref. [22]. The gravitational decoupling approach and its extended version EGD are particularly attractive for at least three reasons : a) it allows for extending known (seed) solutions of the Einstein field equations into more complex ones; b) it can be used to systematically reduce (decouple) a complex energy-momentum tensor T µν into simpler components; and c) it can be used to find solutions in gravitational theories beyond Einstein's. In light of the above, it is natural to apply the EGD for the purpose of describing hairy black holes.In this Section, we briefly review the EGD for spherically symmetric gravitational systems described in detail in Ref.

        <p>Conditions to evade the no-hair theorem have been investigated for a long time [7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17]. A straightforward possibility is to fill the static vacuum with some source of potentially fundamental origin, often described as a scalar field [18][19][20].

        <p>Using the EGD approach, we studied the emergence of hairy black holes due to matter surrounding the central source of the Schwarzschild metric. Demanding that the solution always admits a well defined horizon through Eq. (31), and that the hair satisfies the SEC or DEC through Eqs. (48) or ( 76) and ( 77), respectively, we found two new families of hairy black holes displayed in Eqs. ( 69) and (87). These geometries were analysed and, in particular, we found that the solutions satisfying the DEC contain the non-trivial extension of the Reissner-Nordström black hole shown in (104) which possesses a simple event horizon. The Lagrangian of the nonlinear electrodynamics, which sources this solution, was also obtained explicitly.Using the EGD approach, we studied the emergence of hairy black holes due to matter surrounding the central source of the Schwarzschild metric.

        <p>From the technical point of view, since aim of the present work was to study some general conditions under which hair can be added to the (spherically symmetric) vacuum black holes of general relativity, the EGD was the natural approach to employ from the onset. In fact, the EGD is precisely devised for describing deformations of known solutions of general relativity induced by adding extra sources. Moreover, the properties of the added source were restricted in order to enforce the conditions mentioned above, rather than assuming the hair is described in terms of fundamental fields. Nonetheless, we were able to give a description in terms of a nonlinear electrodynamics at least in one specific case.From the technical point of view, since aim of the present work was to study some general conditions under which hair can be added to the (spherically symmetric) vacuum black holes of general relativity, the EGD was the natural approach to employ from the onset.

        <p>Finally, we would like to remark that the charges Q and 0 = α associated with our hairy black holes admit simple physical interpretations. The charge Q can be viewed as an effective electric charge and is proportional to α, which is the generic parameter measuring the deviation from the chosen solution (which is given by the Schwarzschild metric). A special mention deserves the parameter 0 , which is associated with gauge trans-formations of the seed Schwarzschild metric and which seems to always push the event horizon to radii larger than the Schwarzschild radius. Therefore 0 = α measures how much the entropy of the black hole increases from its minimum Schwarzschild value S = 4 π M 2 when hair is added.Finally, we would like to remark that the charges Q and 0 = α associated with our hairy black holes admit simple physical interpretations.

        <p>Since there is some confusion in the literature, we adhere to the convention that conformal transformations are coordinate transformations leaving angles invariant, whereas Weyl (or scale) transformations are more general transformations of the metric which leave the angles invariant but do not affect the coordinates.Since there is some confusion in the literature, we adhere to the convention that conformal transformations are coordinate transformations leaving angles invariant, whereas Weyl (or scale) transformations are more general transformations of the metric which leave the angles invariant but do not affect the coordinates.</p>
        <p>Note that a trivial deformation which leaves the Schwarzschild metric(30) unaffected is also recovered by setting a = 1 (n = 0) in Eq.(37). We will have more to say about this in the next subsections.Note that a trivial deformation which leaves the Schwarzschild metric(30) unaffected is also recovered by setting a = 1 (n = 0) in Eq.(37).
