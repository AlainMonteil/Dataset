        <p>The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) has the potential to reveal wonders about the fundamental theory of nature at play in the extreme gravity regime, where the gravitational interaction is both strong and dynamical. In this white paper, the Fundamental Physics Working Group of the LISA Consortium summarizes the current topics in fundamental physics where LISA observations of gravitational waves can be expected to provide key input. We provide the briefest of reviews to then delineate avenues for future research directions and to discuss connections between this working group, other working groups and the consortium work package teams. These connections must be developed for LISA to live up to its science potential in these areas.The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) has the potential to reveal wonders about the fundamental theory of nature at play in the extreme gravity regime, where the gravitational interaction is both strong and dynamical.

        <p>Gravity is at the forefront of many of the deepest questions in fundamental physics. These questions include the classical dynamics and quantum nature of black holes (BHs), the matter and antimatter asymmetry of the observable universe, the processes at play during the expansion of the universe and during cosmological structure formation, and, of course, the intrinsic nature of dark matter and dark energy, and perhaps of spacetime itself. These questions are cross-generational and their answers are likely to require crossdisciplinary explorations, instead of being the purview of a particular sub-discipline.Gravity is at the forefront of many of the deepest questions in fundamental physics.

        <p>The recent observations of gravitational waves (GWs) are beginning to help us dig deeper into these questions, opening new research paths that enable the fruitful interaction of fundamental theory and observation. GWs have the potential to examine largely unexplored regions of the universe that are otherwise electromagnetically obscure. Examples of these regions include the vicinity of BH horizons, early phases in the formation of large-scale structure, and the hot big bang. Moreover, GWs can complement electromagnetic (EM) observations in astronomy and cosmology, thus enabling "multi-messenger" astrophysics and creating a path toward a better understanding of our universe.The recent observations of gravitational waves (GWs) are beginning to help us dig deeper into these questions, opening new research paths that enable the fruitful interaction of fundamental theory and observation.

        <p>The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) has the potential to contribute enormously in this quest, as this instrument is uniquely positioned to observe, for the first time, long-wavelength GWs (Amaro-Seoane et al. 2017), and therefore, new 123 sources of GW radiation. Why is this? Because LISA can provide new information about gravitational anomalies, perhaps related to the quantum nature of gravity, about quantum-inspired effects in BH physics, and even about beyond the standard model, particle physics. Examples of the information that could be gained abound, but one concrete example is the following. LISA has the potential to constrain (or detect) the activation of scalar or vector degrees of freedom around black holes, which arise in certain modified gravity theories inspired by quantum gravity. This is because these fields typically carry energy-momentum away from BH binaries, forcing them to spiral faster into each other than predicted in GR. This faster rate of inspiral then modifies the time evolution of the GW frequency, and therefore, its phase, which LISA is particularly sensitive to.The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) has the potential to contribute enormously in this quest, as this instrument is uniquely positioned to observe, for the first time, long-wavelength GWs (Amaro-Seoane et al. 2017), and therefore, new 123 sources of GW radiation.

        <p>GW observations with LISA will complement the information we have gained (and will continue to gain) with ground-based GW interferometers, such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), Virgo and KAGRA. This complementarity arises because ground-based instruments operate at higher frequencies than LISA, and therefore, they can hear GWs from a completely different type of sources. This, in turn, implies LISA is uniquely positioned to detect supermassive BH (SMBH) mergers, extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), galactic binaries, and SGWB, none of which ground-based detectors are sensitive to. The GWs emitted by some of these sources (such as those emitted by SMBH mergers) will be extremely loud, generating signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in the thousands, which will allow us to prove fundamental physics deeply. Other GWs will be less loud, but they will be extremely complex, as is the case for waves generated by EMRIs; these waves will contain intricate amplitude and phase modulations that will encode the BH geometry in which the small compact object zooms and whirls. The observation of GWs with LISA will also complement observations with pulsar timing arrays and EM observations of the B-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which can inform us about fundamental physics at even lower frequencies.GW observations with LISA will complement the information we have gained (and will continue to gain) with ground-based GW interferometers, such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), Virgo and KAGRA.

        <p>The goal of this white paper is threefold. First, we aim to identify those topics in fundamental physics beyond the current standard models of particle physics, gravity and cosmology that are particularly relevant for the scientific community, in order to delineate and sharpen LISA's potential in each of these areas. The organization of this article reflects this identification of topics, with each section covering one area. The range of areas is illustrated in Fig. 1. Second, within each section we summarize the state of the art of each of these areas, both from a theoretical and an observational point of view. In order to keep this article both manageable and useful, rather than presenting an extensive detailed review of each topic, we have opted for sufficiently concise "reviews", referring to excellent recent articles in Living Reviews in Relativity and elsewhere for more details (see e.g., Barack et al. 2019). Put differently, the philosophy behind this white paper is to strive towards completion in terms of what are relevant branches of fundamental physics for LISA that we think ought to be explored further, rather than providing extensive background and technical details on each of the topics. Third, each section then assesses what must be done in order for LISA to live up to its scientific potential in these areas of fundamental physics. This is primarily where the living part of this article enters, which should be viewed in a LISA-specific context. Finally, we bring these different strands together and identify possible synergies in a roadmap section at the end.The goal of this white paper is threefold.

        <p>In closing, let us note that this article is part of a series of LISA working group (WG) articles. Some of the topics discussed here are of interest to several WGs organized within the LISA Consortium. Strong synergies exist between the Fundamental Physics WG, the Cosmology, the Astrophysics, and the Waveform modelling WGs, each of which approaches the topics discussed in this article from different, complementary angles. One of the intended goals of this article is to promote these synergies and connect the WGs, specially the fundamental physics one to the LISA work package groups, so that the ideas presented here can be implemented and deployed in future LISA data analysis.In closing, let us note that this article is part of a series of LISA working group (WG) articles.

        <p>GWs and some of their major sources-BHs and relativistic stars-are among the most groundbreaking predictions of GR.

        <p>The various versions of the equivalence principle are commonly used as a theoretical foundation of GR and as guiding principles for tests of gravity (Will 1993).The various versions of the equivalence principle are commonly used as a theoretical foundation of GR and as guiding principles for tests of gravity (Will 1993).</p>
        <p>The Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) postulates that the trajectory of a freely falling test body is independent of its structure and composition, providing the fact that there are no external forces acting on this body such as electromagnetism. The Einstein Equivalence Principle (EEP) goes one step further and combines the WEP, Local Lorentz Invariance (LLI), and Local Position Invariance (LPI). The LLI is connected with the assumption that the outcome of any local non-gravitational test experiment is independent of the velocity of the freely-falling frame of reference where this experiment is performed. The LPI requires that the outcome of such an experiment is independent of where and when it is performed. The Strong Equivalence Principle (SEP) is equivalent to the EEP with the WEP extended to selfgravitating bodies and the LLI and LPI to any experiment.The Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) postulates that the trajectory of a freely falling test body is independent of its structure and composition, providing the fact that there are no external forces acting on this body such as electromagnetism.

        <p>The EEP dictates the universality of couplings in the standard model because of LLI and LPI. The SEP takes this even further and implies that the gravitational coupling is fixed as well. Testing the SEP is often considered synonymous to testing GR itself (Will 1993). If the SEP is fulfilled, the only field that is a mediator of the gravitational interaction should be the spacetime metric. Conversely, the existence of new fields mediating gravity would generically lead to violations of the SEP (which might appear only in specific systems, depending on how elusive the fields are).The EEP dictates the universality of couplings in the standard model because of LLI and LPI.

        <p>The discussion above already suggests strongly that testing GR (classically) amounts to looking for new fields. An independent way to reach the same conclusion is to start from Lovelock's theorem (Lovelock 1972): Einstein's field equations are unique, assuming that we are working in four dimensions, diffeomorphism invariance is respected, the metric is the only field mediating gravity, and the equations are second-order differential equations. Violating any of these assumption can circumvent Lovelock's theorem and lead to distinct alternative theories of gravity. However, the vast majority of them1 will share one property: they will contain one or more additional fields (see e.g., Sotiriou 2015b). Demonstrating this mathematically might require compactifying spacetime down to 4-dimensions, introducing additional fields to restore diffeomorphism invariance, and performing field redefinitions.The discussion above already suggests strongly that testing GR (classically) amounts to looking for new fields.

        <p>The realization that testing the SEP and looking for deviations from GR largely amounts to looking for new fields allows one to understand intuitively how compact objects and GWs can be used to probe such deviations. When the new fields have a nontrivial configuration around a BH or compact star, the latter can be thought of as carrying a 'charge' (this might not be a conserved charge associated to a gauge symmetry). Field theory intuition tells us that accelerating charges radiate. Hence, binaries beyond GR will exhibit additional GW polarizations. Emission in extra polarizations affects the rate of energy loss and, in turn, the orbital dynamics. So, the pattern of emission of conventional polarizations will also be affected. In Sect. 2.2.1 we discuss how the structure of BHs-primary sources for LISA-can be affected by new fields, whereas in the rest of Sect. 2.2 we discuss how deviations from GR can be imprinted in different parts of the waveform or affect GW propagation.The realization that testing the SEP and looking for deviations from GR largely amounts to looking for new fields allows one to understand intuitively how compact objects and GWs can be used to probe such deviations.

        <p>There exist no-hair theorems for a wide range of alternative theories of gravity (Bekenstein 1997;Doneva and Yazadjiev 2020;Hawking 1972;Herdeiro and Radu 2015;Hui and Nicolis 2013;Sotiriou 2015a;Sotiriou and Faraoni 2012) stating that the quiescent, isolated BHs are indistinguishable from their GR counterpart. If the additional fields can be excited, quasinormal mode (QNM) ringing can still be distinct from GR (Barausse and Sotiriou 2008;Molina et al. 2010;Tattersall and Ferreira 2018) and hence offer a possibility of test theories that are covered by nohair theorems. Models that manage to circumvent no-hair theorems are expected to lead to more prominent deviations from GR in GW signals, as they can posses additional charges and exhibit additional interactions that can affect all parts of the waveform.There exist no-hair theorems for a wide range of alternative theories of gravity (Bekenstein 1997;Doneva and Yazadjiev 2020;Hawking 1972;Herdeiro and Radu 2015;Hui and Nicolis 2013;Sotiriou 2015a;Sotiriou and Faraoni 2012) stating that the quiescent, isolated BHs are indistinguishable from their GR counterpart.

        <p>Scalar fields coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant or the Pontryagin density (dynamical Chern-Simons gravity) are known to lead to BH hair (Benkel et al. 2017(Benkel et al. , 2016;;Campbell et al. 1992;Delgado et al. 2020b;Delsate et al. 2018;Kanti et al. 1996;Sotiriou and Zhou 2014a, b;Stein 2014;Yagi et al. 2012c;Yunes and Pretorius 2009a;Yunes and Stein 2011) which can be observed with LISA (Maselli et al. 2020a;Yagi and Stein 2016;Yagi et al. 2012b). Such couplings are expected in low-energy limits of quantum gravity (see e.g., Ashtekar et al. 1989;Jackiw and Pi 2003;Metsaev and Tseytlin 1987) and are part of the Horndeski class of scalar-tensor theories (Kobayashi 2019). A coupling to the Pontryagin density is the leading-order parity violating term in gravity in the presence of a (pseudo) scalar (Alexander and Yunes 2009;Jackiw and Pi 2003), while the linear coupling with the Gauss-Bonnet invariant is the only term inducing hair for shift-symmetric (aka massless) scalars (Delgado et al. 2020b;Saravani and Sotiriou 2019;Sotiriou and Zhou 2014a) and the leading correction for GW emission (Witek et al. 2019). A nonlinear coupling with the Gauss-Bonnet invariant has recently been shown to give rise to BH spontaneous scalarization triggered by curvature (Blázquez-Salcedo et al. 2018;Collodel et al. 2020;Cunha et al. 2019;Doneva and Yazadjiev 2018;Macedo et al. 2019;Silva et al. 2018Silva et al. , 2019) ) or spin (Berti et al. 2021;Dima et al. 2020;Doneva et al. 2020a, b;Herdeiro et al. 2021;Hod 2020).

        <p>Attempts have also been made to circumvent no-hair theorems by relaxing their assumptions. For example, superradiance can support long-lived scalar clouds for very light scalars (Arvanitaki and Dubovsky 2011;Brito et al. 2015b) or lead to hairy BHs for complex scalars with a time dependent phase (Collodel et al. 2020;Delgado et al. 2019;Herdeiro et al. 2018a;Herdeiro and Radu 2014b;Herdeiro et al. 2015;Kleihaus et al. 2015); long-lived scalar "wigs" can be formed around a Schwarzschild BH (Barranco et al. 2012(Barranco et al. , 2014)); configurations with time-dependent scalar fields can be supported by some non-trivial cosmological boundary conditions (Babichev and Charmousis 2014;Berti et al. 2013;Clough et al. 2019;Hui et al. 2019;Jacobson 1999); BHs immersed in an inhomogeneous scalar field were considered in Healy et al.

In such theories, new fields can propagate superluminally or even instantaneously (Bhattacharyya et al. 2016a;Blas and Sibiryakov 2011), even when all known constraints are satisfied (Emir Gümrükçüoǧlu et al. 2018;Sotiriou 2018).

In GR, gravitons are massless spin-2 particles, while in alternative gravity theories, they might be massive (Abbott et al. 2016b;Hassan and Rosen 2012;de Rham et al. 2011;Will 1998), or even have a Lorentz-violating structure in the dispersion relation (Blas et al. 2010;Horava 2009b;Jacobson 2007;Jacobson and Mattingly 2001;Kostelecký and Mewes 2016;Mirshekari et al. 2012;Shao 2020;Sotiriou 2011). Modifications to the dispersion relation could lead to frequency-dependent, polarization-dependent, direction-dependent propagating velocities of GWs. Eventually, while these components travel at different velocities, the gravitational waveforms received on the Earth are distorted, with respect to their original chirping structure at generation (Kostelecký and Mewes 2016;Will 1998). Therefore, a matched-filter analysis allowing the possibility of the modified GW propagation in the waveform will reveal the nature of graviton kinematics (see e.g., Abbott et al. 2016b) and provide stringent constraints on the mass of the graviton and on Lorentz symmetry violations. The binary neutron star (NS) merger GW170817 has already provided a strong, doublesided bound on the speed of GWs to a part in 10 15 (Abbott et al. 2017e). However, Lorentz-violating theories have multidimensional parameter spaces and generically exhibit additional polarizations (Sotiriou 2018). The speed of these other polarizations remains virtually unconstrained (Emir Gümrükçüoǧlu et al. 2018;Oost et al. 2018).

Even though tests of the GR nature of the waveforms can be performed without linking to specific alternative theories of gravity within the PN or ppE approaches, connecting the predictions of the different generalizations of Einstein's theory with the possible deviations in the GR expectation values of the PN or ppE parameters is an inseparable part of testing the possible violations of the GR fundamental symmetries (Berti et al. 2018).a.

        <p>Even more intriguing is the possibility for multiband GW observations of BBH mergers. The separation between the two members of a BBH determines the frequencies of the emitted GW signal. A binary that will be in the observational band of LISA at large separation can several years later enter the band of ground-based detectors. Using LISA observations and assuming GR, one can then obtain highaccuracy predictions of the time when the binary will become observable by groundbased detectors as well as its position on the sky (Sesana 2016). Any deviation of the former, observed by a ground based detector, would imply a breakdown of GR. For example, joint observations of a LIGO/Virgo and LISA of a GW150914-like event could improve constraints on BBH dipole emission by 6 orders of magnitude (Barausse et al. 2016;Toubiana et al. 2020). The possibility of observing the same system more than once for a prolonged period will offer the opportunity to test completely nonlinear predictions of some generalized scalar-tensor theories, such as dynamical BH scalarization (Khalil et al. 2019).Even more intriguing is the possibility for multiband GW observations of BBH mergers.

        <p>b. Ringdown: In GR, numerical simulations have shown that the end state of a BBH merger is a Kerr BH (e.g., Boyle et al. 2019;Healy and Lousto 2020;Jani et al. 123 2016) in agreement with the earlier analytical studies proving that the Kerr metric is the unique stationary, asytmptotically flat, axially symmetric BH spacetime (Bunting 1983;Carter 1971;Mazur 1982;Robinson 1975) (see Chrusciel et al. 2012;Heusler 1996 for a review). Before reaching the final Kerr state, the BH emits GWs in QNMs, which are labeled by their overtone numbers, n, and angular numbers (l, m) and are determined by these numbers (l, m, n) plus the mass M and spin parameter a of the Kerr BH (Berti et al. 2009). Measuring several of these QNMs would allow for "BH spectroscopy," in which a perturbed Kerr BH is identified by the spectrum of QNMs in its ringdown GWs (Berti et al. 2006;Detweiler 1980a;Dreyer et al. 2004). Specifically, for a given BBH merger, the number and amplitude of QNMs excited during the ringdown is determined by the individual BHs and their orbital parameters prior to merger (Kamaretsos et al. 2012). If at least two of the QNMs can be measured from the ringdown of a BH, then by knowing which modes were excited, one can verify that the two QNM frequencies and two QNM damping times are both consistent with the same mass M and spin a parameters of the remnant Kerr BH, within the errors of the observation (Berti et al. 2006;Dreyer et al. 2004). For a high SNR massive BBH event measured by LISA, this "no hair" (or "final-state") test can be performed to verify the remnant is consistent with a Kerr BH to high precision (e. g., Gossan et al. 2012).b.

        <p>If the underlying gravity theory differs from GR, the ringdown of a BBH merger will also typically differ from the ringdown in GR. Computing the QNMs in modified theories is typically challenging, as is performing NR simulations of BBH mergers in modified gravity theories (both of which have only been performed in a handful of cases, e.g., Blázquez-Salcedo et al. 2016;Cardoso and Gualtieri 2009;Okounkova 2020;Okounkova et al. 2020). This makes it difficult to look for deviations in a particular modified theory. Parametrized tests are instead used to look for deviations. In Tattersall et al. (2018), deviations from linear perturbations about a Schwarzschild BH in GR were parametrized at the level of a diffeomorphisminvariant action that encompassed a large range of possible theories that lead to second-order equations of motion. A more phenomenological approach to the test for deviations from GR during ringdown is to perform a parametrized test in which the QNM frequencies are given by the Kerr values plus small deviations, in a "post-Kerr" expansion (Glampedakis et al. 2017). There are also procedures to try to combine the deviation parameters from multiple BBH events measured by LISA (Maselli et al. 2020b).

This makes it a very challenging regime to model, requiring full nonlinear evolutions of the field equations. A modelindependent self-consistency test, such as the IMR consistency test (Ghosh et al. 2016a(Ghosh et al. , 2017) ) could be used in order to avoid having to model the merger in alternative theories of gravity. However, having theory-specific waveforms that include the merger is essential. It can provide more stringent constraints and it is necessary for interpreting them physically. It can also be used to quantitatively explore deviations from GR that do not affect other parts of the waveform-e.g. new fields that are highly excited by nonlinear effects and decay rapidly-and guide and calibrate parametrizations.c.

        <p>Despite progress within GR (Pound et al. 2020), tests of gravity with EMRIs have been so far limited to systematic calculations in modified theories, in which the different couplings to the gravity sector require, in general, a theory-by-theory analysis. These additional degrees of freedom, introduced as scalar, vector or tensor modes, activate extra emission channels that modify the binary phase evolution. These changes are expected to leave a detectable footprint in the emitted signal and be augmented by the large number of cycles followed by EMRIs.

        <p>Drastic simplifications in the EMRI modelling beyond GR have been recently proven to hold for a vast class of theories, for which no-hair theorems or separations of scales provide a decoupling of the metric and scalar perturbations (Maselli et al. 2020a). This result allows one to describe the background spacetime as in GR, rendering all the modifications induced by the modified theory to be universally captured by the scalar field's charge only. It has already been used to show that the latter can be measured with unprecedented precision (Maselli et al. 2022). In this framework waveform modelling beyond GR can take advantage of all the efforts devoted so far to study the evolution of scalar charges around Kerr BHs (Barack and Burko 2000;Castillo et al. 2018;Detweiler et al. 2003;Diaz-Rivera et al. 2004;Gralla et al. 2015;Nasipak et al. 2019;Warburton 2015;Warburton andBarack 2010, 2011).Drastic simplifications in the EMRI modelling beyond GR have been recently proven to hold for a vast class of theories, for which no-hair theorems or separations of scales provide a decoupling of the metric and scalar perturbations (Maselli et al. 2020a).

        <p>GR predicts that the passage of a GW causes a permanent displacement in the relative position of two inertial GW detectors. This phenomenon is known as the displacement memory effect (Christodoulou 1991;Ludvigsen 1989;Payne 1983;Thorne 1992) (see Compère 2019a; Strominger 2018 for an account of historical references). Studies on the detection of the displacement memory effects in actual experiments have been presented in Favata (2009bFavata ( , 2009aFavata ( , 2010Favata ( , 2011)). More recently, prospects for the memory effect detection with LISA have been discussed in Islo et al. (2019) using SMBH binaries undergoing coalescence (See also Sect. 3). In addition to the displacement memory effect, other and subdominant effects such as the spin memory and center of mass memory effects can also take place (Flanagan et al. 2019;Nichols 2017Nichols , 2018;;Pasterski et al. 2016). Generalizations of the memory effect, not necessarily motivated or associated to a symmetry, which should in principle be measurable, have also been discussed in Compère (2019b); Flanagan et al.

Ideally isolated systems in GR can be described by asymptotically flat spacetimes. At null infinity, the symmetry group of asymptotically flat spacetimes in GR is known to be larger than the Poincare group of symmetries. It contains the original infinite-dimensional Bondi-Van der Burg-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group which is a semi-direct product of the Lorentz group and of an infinite-dimensional group of "angle dependent translations" called supertranslations (Bondi et al. 1962;Sachs 1962). Further extensions of the BMS group have also been proposed (Barnich and Troessaert 2010;Campiglia and Laddha 2015). BMS supertranslations can be related to the gravitational memory effect in that the relative positions of two inertial detectors before and after the passage of a GW differ by a BMS supertranslation. In addition, perturbative quantum gravity admits remarkable infrared identities among its scattering amplitudes, the soft theorems, that have been demonstrated to be the Ward identities of BMS symmetries (Strominger and Zhiboedov 2016;Strominger 2018). The classical limit of the quantum soft theorems are equivalent after a Fourier transformation to the memory effects (Strominger and Zhiboedov 2016).

        <p>In vacuum GR, the Carter-Robinson (Carter 1971;Robinson 1975) uniqueness theorem, with later refinements (see Chrusciel et al. 2012 for a review), establishes that the Kerr geometry (Kerr 1963) is the unique physically acceptable equilibrium, asymptotically flat BH solution. This led to the more ambitious proposal that, regardless of the initial energy-matter content available in a gravitational collapse scenario, the dynamically formed equilibrium BHs belong to the Kerr family (in the absence of gauge charges) (Ruffini and Wheeler 1971). Accordingly, (near-) equilibrium astrophysical BH candidates are well described by the Kerr metric. This working proposal is the Kerr hypothesis.

The most explored one is theory dependent: to consider specific choices of matter contents or modified gravity models, compute the BH solutions (which, generically, will be non-Kerr), and finally explore the different phenomenology of a given model. The second one is theory agnostic: to consider parametrized deviations from the Kerr metric, regardless of the model they solve (if any). The latter has been fruitfully employed in studying BH phenomenology in stationary scenarios, e.g., Cardoso et al.

        <p>A substantial departure from the Kerr hypothesis is to admit deviations from, or even the absence of, a classical horizon. This leads to hypothetical exotic compact objects (ECOs) with a compactness comparable to that of (classical) BHs (see Cardoso and Pani 2019 for a review). One motivation for such a dramatic scenario is that, from Penrose's theorem (Penrose 1965), a classical BH (apparent) horizon implies the existence of spacetime singularities, under reasonable energy (and other) conditions. Thus, the absence of (or deviations from) a classical horizon could circumvent the singularity problem. Another motivation is that quantum corrections may be relevant at the horizon scale, even for small-curvature supermassive objects (Almheiri et al. 2013;Giddings 2006;Lunin and Mathur 2002a, b;Mathur 2005Mathur , 2009a, b;, b;Mayerson 2020).A substantial departure from the Kerr hypothesis is to admit deviations from, or even the absence of, a classical horizon.

They may be described by their compactness (i.e. the inverse of their-possibly effective-radius in units of the total mass), reflectivity (as opposed to the perfect absorption by a classical BH horizon), and possible extra degrees of freedom related to additional fields (Cardoso and Pani 2019). Their compactness should be comparable to that of BHs; they may be (albeit need not be) ultracompact, i.e., possess bound photon orbits, such as light rings. If they do, they could be further classified according to whether the typical lightcrossing time of the object is longer or shorter than the instability time scale of circular null geodesics at the photon sphere, which in turn depends on the object compactness and internal composition (Cardoso and Pani 2019).ECOs (Giudice et al. 2016) is a generic name for a class of hypothetical dark compact objects without a classical BH horizon that, nonetheless, can mimic the phenomenology of BHs at the classical level.

Moreover, in the semi-classical approximation, BHs are thermodynamically unstable and have an entropy which is far in excess of a typical stellar progenitor (Hawking 1976).

        <p>Bosonic stars are the prototypical example of ECOs which are not meant to replace all BHs in the universe, but could in principle "co-exist" with them and be exotic sources for LISA. They could also be especially interesting for the BH seed problem at large redshift. Indeed, just like ordinary NSs, bosonic stars have a maximum mass beyond which they are unstable against gravitational collapse and classically form an ordinary BH. Other models that share the same features are anisotropic stars (Bayin 1982;Bowers and Liang 1974;Letelier 1980) (see Raposo et al. 2019a for a recent fully covariant model).

        <p>A more ambitious first-principle model of ECO-aiming instead at replacing the classical horizon completely-emerges in the fuzzball proposal (Lunin and Mathur 2002a, b;Mathur 2005Mathur , 2009a)).

These geometries represent some of the microstates in the low-energy (super)gravity description. For special classes of extremal, charged, BHs (Horowitz et al. 1996;Maldacena et al. 1997;Strominger and Vafa 1996) one can precisely count the microstates that account for the BH entropy, thus providing a regular, horizonless, microscopic description of a classical horizon. In the fuzzball paradigm, all properties of a BH geometry emerge in a coarse-grained description which "averages" over the large number of coherent superposition of microstates, or as a 'collective behavior' of fuzzballs (Bena et al. 2019b, a;Bianchi et al. 2018Bianchi et al. , 2019Bianchi et al. , 2020b)). Crucially, in this model quantum gravity effects are not confined close to the BH singularity, rather the entire interior of the BH is "filled" by fluctuating geometries, regardless of its curvature.

        <p>While microstate geometries emerge from a consistent low-energy truncation of string theory, other more phenomenological models sharing similar phenomenology have been proposed. For example, gravitational vacuum stars, or gravastars, are dark energy stars whose interior spacetime is supported by a negative-pressure fluid which is compensated by a thin shell of an ultrarelativistic positive-pressure fluid. Gravastars are not endowed with an event horizon and have a regular interior. Their model has been conceived in order to overcome the surprisingly huge BH entropy and to provide a model for a thermodynamically stable dark compact object (Mazur and Mottola 2004). The negative pressure might arise as a hydrodynamical description of one-loop QFT effects in curved spacetime, so gravastars do not necessarily require exotic new physics (Mottola and Vaulin 2006). In these models, the Buchdahl limit is evaded both because the internal effective fluid is anisotropic (Cattoen et al. 2005;Raposo et al. 2019a) and because the negative pressure violates some of the energy conditions (Mazur and Mottola 2015). Gravastars can also be obtained as the BH-limit of constant-density stars, past the Buchdahl limit (Posada and Chirenti 2019;Mazur and Mottola 2015). In this regime such configurations were found to be dynamically stable (Posada and Chirenti 2019).While microstate geometries emerge from a consistent low-energy truncation of string theory, other more phenomenological models sharing similar phenomenology have been proposed.

        <p>Despite the wealth of models, ECOs are not without challenges. In addition to the lack of plausible concrete formation mechanisms in many models, there are other generic problems. One issue is that spinning compact objects with an ergoregion but without an event horizon are prone to the ergoregion instability when spinning sufficiently fast (Friedman 1978;Yoshida and Eriguchi 1996). The endpoint of the instability could be a slowly spinning ECO (Brito et al. 2015b;Cardoso et al. 2008) or dissipation within the object could lead to a stable remnant (Maggio et al. 2017(Maggio et al. , 2019a)). Another potential issue is that ultracompact ECOs which are topologically trivial have not one but at least a pair of light rings, one of which is stable, for physically reasonable matter sources (Cunha et al. 2017). Such stable light rings have been argued to source a spacetime instability at nonlinear level (Cardoso et al. 2014a;Keir 2016), whose timescale or endpoint, however, are unclear.Despite the wealth of models, ECOs are not without challenges.

        <p>c. Tidal heating: The compact objects in the binary produce a tidal field on each other which grows as the bodies approach their final plunge and merger. If the bodies dissipate some amount of radiation, these tides backreact on the orbit, transferring rotational energy from their spin into the orbit. This effect is known as tidal heating. For BHs, energy and angular momentum absorption by the horizon is responsible for tidal heating. This effect is particularly significant for highly spinning BHs and mostly important in the latest stages of the inspiral. Tidal heating can contribute to thousands of radians of accumulated orbital phase for EMRIs in the LISA band (Bernuzzi et al. 2012b;Datta and Bose 2019;Datta et al. 2020;Harms et al. 2014;Hughes 2001;Maggio et al. 2021;Taracchini et al. 2013). If at least one binary member is an ECO instead of a BH, dissipation is in general smaller than in the BH case or even negligible, therefore significantly reducing the contribution of tidal heating to the GW phase. This would allow to distinguish between BBHs and binary involving other compact objects. For LISA binaries, constraints of the amount of dissipation would be stronger for highly spinning objects and for binaries with large mass ratios (Datta et al. 2020;Maggio et al. 2021;Maselli et al. 2018). For EMRIs in the LISA band, this effect could be used to put a very stringent upper bound on the reflectivity of ECOs, at the level of 0:01% or better (Datta et al. 2020;Maggio et al. 2021). Absence of a horizon can also produce resonances that can be excited during EMRIs (Cardoso et al. 2019c;Macedo et al. 2013b;Maggio et al. 2021;Pani et al. 2010).c.

This modifies the orbital phase, and then in turn the GW emission (Hinderer et al. 2018;Poisson and Will 2014). The imprint on the waveform is encoded in a set of quantities which, as a first approximation, can be assumed to be constant during the coalescence (Hinderer et al. 2016;Maselli et al. 2012;Steinhoff et al. 2016): the tidal Love numbers (Binnington and Poisson 2009;Damour and Nagar 2009;Hinderer 2008). These numbers can be thought of as the specific multipole moment induced by an external tidal field, in a way akin to the electric susceptibility in electrodynamics.

        <p>LISA will be able to measure the tidal Love numbers of BH mimickers (Maselli et al. 2018), which are otherwise unmeasurable by current and future ground based detectors (Cardoso et al. 2017). In the comparable-mass case, this measurement requires highly-spinning supermassive ECO binaries up to 10 Gpc. LISA may also be able to perform model selection between different families of BH mimickers (Maselli et al. 2019), although this will in general require detection of golden binaries (i. e. binaries with a very large SNR) (Addazi et al. 2019). For a large class of slowlyrotating ECOs with compactness C.0:3, LISA can measure the Love numbers with very good accuracy below 1% (Cardoso et al. 2017). For (scalar) boson stars a recent study proposed a new data analysis strategy to consistently include several corrections (multipolar structure, tidal heating, tidal Love numbers) in the inspiral signal from boson star binaries, improving the accuracy on the measurement of the fundamental parameters of the theory by several orders of magnitude compared to the case in which the effects are considered independently (Pacilio et al. 2020).LISA will be able to measure the tidal Love numbers of BH mimickers (Maselli et al. 2018), which are otherwise unmeasurable by current and future ground based detectors (Cardoso et al. 2017).

        <p>EMRIs in GR can be approximated, to zeroth-order, as geodesics of the Kerr spacetime, and the latter has enough symmetries to guarantee that geodesics are completely integrable and thus non-chaotic. Beyond the zeroth-order approximation, however, other effects, such as the spin of the small compact object, could break the integrability of the systems even within GR (Zelenka et al. 2020). In some modified theories, even the geodesic orbital motion might not be integrable (Cárdenas-Avendaño et al. 2018;Lukes-Gerakopoulos et al. 2010). This is also true for some models of ECOs, such as spinning scalar boson stars and non-Kerr BHs in GR (Cunha et al. 2016). In this sense, the presence of large chaotic features in the GWs emitted by EMRIs could signal a departure from the SEP, a violation of the Kerr hypothesis, or an environmental effect.EMRIs in GR can be approximated, to zeroth-order, as geodesics of the Kerr spacetime, and the latter has enough symmetries to guarantee that geodesics are completely integrable and thus non-chaotic.

        <p>f. Motion within ECOs: If the ECO interior is made of weakly-interacting matter, a further discriminator of the absence of a horizon (or of a hard surface) would be the motion of test particles within the object and its peculiar GW signal, most notably as in the case of an EMRI moving inside a supermassive ECO. This motion can be driven by a combination of the self-gravity of the central object, accretion, and dynamical friction, etc. The study of geodesic motion inside solitonic boson stars was analyzed in e.g., Kesden et al. (2005). The effects of accretion and drag were included in Barausse et al. (2014), Barausse et al. (2015), Macedo et al. (2013a) and Macedo et al. (2013b). These effects are model independent to a certain extent, since they mostly depend on the density profile. For this reason they also share some similarities with environmental tests of dark matter (see Sect. 4).

        <p>a. QNMs: Similarly to what was discussed in Sect. 2, measuring the ringdown modes in the post-merger signal of a binary coalescence provides a clean and robust way to test GR and the nature of the remnant. If the latter is a Kerr BH in GR, its (infinitely countable) QNM spectrum is entirely determined only in terms of its mass and spin. Thus, detecting several QNMs provides us with multiple independent null-hypothesis tests, and would allow us to perform GW spectroscopy (Berti et al. 2009;Kokkotas and Schmidt 1999). From a more theoretical perspective, the study of the QNMs of compact objects is crucial to assess their linear stability.a.

        <p>The ringdown waveform originates from the perturbed remnant object, and consists of a superposition of (complex) QNMs, whose amplitudes depend on the binary progenitors and on the underlying theory. As previously discussed, the fundamental QNM frequency and damping time have been measured by LIGO/Virgo only for a few events, providing an independent measurement of the mass and spin of the remnant which is in agreement with what inferred from the inspiral-merger phase (Abbott et al. 2019b(Abbott et al. , 2021b)). Among the entire second GW transient catalogue (Abbott et al. 2021b) the first GW event, GW150914, remains among those for which the fundamental QNM of the remnant has been measured with the highest precision (roughly 3% and 7% for the frequency and damping time, respectively). More recently, the importance of overtones has attracted considerable attention, especially because they allow one to start the fitting of the ringdown signal closer to the peak of the signal, improving mass and spin measurements (Isi et al. 2019a). Overtones are particularly useful for tests of GR with equal-mass binaries (for which other angular modes can be suppressed) (Bhagwat et al. 2020;Jiménez Forteza et al. 2020;Ota and Chirenti 2020), but a detailed study for LISA remains to be done. Overall, tests of the no-hair theorem rely also on the ability to estimate the starting time of the ringdown when the signal is dominated by the QNMs of the remnant and on the modelling of higher modes (Baibhav et al. 2018;Bhagwat et al. 2018Bhagwat et al. , 2020;;Brito et al. 2018;Giesler et al. 2019;Jiménez Forteza et al. 2020;Ota and Chirenti 2020).The ringdown waveform originates from the perturbed remnant object, and consists of a superposition of (complex) QNMs, whose amplitudes depend on the binary progenitors and on the underlying theory.

        <p>LIGO/Virgo O1 and O2 events triggered some controversial claims on hints of GW echoes detection. Independent searches found evidence for GW echoes in the O1-O2 events (Abedi and Afshordi 2019;Abedi et al. 2017;Conklin et al. 2018). However, a low statistical significance of such events has been claimed (Nielsen et al. 2019;Westerweck et al. 2018), followed by more recent negative searches (Lo et al. 2019;Tsang et al. 2020;Uchikata et al. 2019). Very recently, using a simplistic template, a dedicated search for echoes has been performed by the LIGO/Virgo Collaboration using the second GW transient catalogue (GWTC-2) (Abbott et al. 2021b), finding no evidence for echoes. This is consistent with independent studies using physically motivated templates, suggesting that that models with almost perfect reflectivity can be excluded/detected with current instruments (5r confidence level with SNR in the ringdown of % 10), whereas probing values of the reflectivity smaller than 80% at 3r or more confidence level requires SNRs of Oð100Þ in the post-merger phase (Maggio et al. 2019b;Testa and Pani 2018).

However, a low statistical significance of such events has been claimed (Nielsen et al. 2019;Westerweck et al. 2018), followed by more recent negative searches (Lo et al. 2019;Tsang et al. 2020;Uchikata et al. 2019). Very recently, using a simplistic template, a dedicated search for echoes has been performed by the LIGO/Virgo Collaboration using the second GW transient catalogue (GWTC-2) (Abbott et al. 2021b), finding no evidence for echoes. This is consistent with independent studies using physically motivated templates, suggesting that that models with almost perfect reflectivity can be excluded/detected with current instruments (5r confidence level with SNR in the ringdown of % 10), whereas probing values of the reflectivity smaller than 80% at 3r or more confidence level requires SNRs of Oð100Þ in the post-merger phase (Maggio et al. 2019b;Testa and Pani 2018). This makes LISA particularly well suited for echo searches.</p>
        <p>c. GWs as messengers from the quantum world: The high sensitivity of LISA or of other advanced detectors will also allows to advance our understanding of quantum gravitational effects. One of the most long-standing ideas in this context is the proposal that the area of BH horizons is quantized in units of the Planck area A ¼ a' 2 p N , where N is an integer characterizing the BH quantum state, a is an Oð1Þ dimensionless coefficient and ' p is Planck's length (Bekenstein 1974;Bekenstein and Mukhanov 1995;Mukhanov 1986). Transitions between states occur, surprisingly, at frequencies where ground-and space-based detectors operate. Thus, quantum BHs may have different tidal heating properties (Agullo et al. 2021;Cardoso et al. 2019a) or different tidal Love numbers (Brustein and Sherf 2022), and the coalescence of two BHs can lead to late-time echoes in the waveforms (Agullo et al. 2021;Cardoso et al. 2019a).c.

        <p>The fundamental nature of dark matter (DM) is one of the major unresolved questions in physics and cosmology. Its presence is inferred from various observations, such as galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, galaxy cluster dynamics and CMB data (see Bertone et al. 2005a;Bertone and Hooper 2018;Carr et al. 2016 for reviews). These observations constrain its behavior on larger scales: DM must broadly behave as non relativistic, collisionless matter, with an average density in galactic haloes of the order of $ 0:1 M pc À3 (1 GeV cm À3 ), low velocity dispersions of order $ 100 km s À1 , and it must be interacting weakly, if at all, with baryonic matter and with itself. However, the physical properties of its constituents, in particular their individual masses and spins, remain very poorly constrained.The fundamental nature of dark matter (DM) is one of the major unresolved questions in physics and cosmology.

        <p>Nothing prevents DM from being a combination of several different components drawn from either or both of these categories. Moreover, some models (e.g. axions), are naturally hybrids, where the DM may primarily consist of unbound particles, but also form macroscopic gravitationally bound structures such as boson stars in overdense regions. A further aspect of DM on which observations may shed light is in identifying possible formation mechanisms, e.g. signatures of phase transitions, which often motivate particular DM models.Nothing prevents DM from being a combination of several different components drawn from either or both of these categories.

        <p>Before we proceed we note two caveats. First, effects described in this section may be degenerate with environmental effects described in Sect. 7 and in the waveform modling white paper. Breaking this degeneracy will be a key factor in our ability to accurately identify DM signatures. Second, we have in most cases been optimistic in assuming that LISA measurements will be optimized for the searches we describe and that models can allow for sufficiently precise predictions to proceed. Turning these caveats around, they could both be regarded as a starting point for action items for future work in order to ensure LISA's science potential will be fully exploited.Before we proceed we note two caveats.

        <p>We now present a number of interesting particle candidates, or rather categories of candidates, that have been explored so far, without making the above qualifications necessarily explicit in each section. We start by reviewing particle candidates, separated into low mass (sub eV) and high mass cases. This roughly divides cases where wave-like and particle-like behaviour respectively would dominate on astrophysically significant scales. We then turn to macroscopic candidates such as PBHs, where we separate candidates that would clearly be of primordial origin (sub M ) from those that could arise from stellar evolution. The last two sections review the potential for enhanced signatures from additional fundamental interactions.We now present a number of interesting particle candidates, or rather categories of candidates, that have been explored so far, without making the above qualifications necessarily explicit in each section.

        <p>In the past few years, the possibility that dark matter could be composed of ultralight bosons, with masses ranging anywhere between 10 À22 eV.1 eV, has become a popular hypothesis (Ferreira 2021). A non-exhaustive list of theoretical models predicting the existence of such particles includes the well-known QCD axion proposed to solve the strong CP problem of QCD (Peccei and Quinn 1977;Wilczek 1978), axion-like particles arising in "string axiverse" scenarios (Arvanitaki et al. 2010), dark photons (Goodsell et al. 2009;Nelson and Scholtz 2011) and "fuzzy dark matter" (Hui et al. 2017).In the past few years, the possibility that dark matter could be composed of ultralight bosons, with masses ranging anywhere between 10 À22 eV.1 eV, has become a popular hypothesis (Ferreira 2021).

        <p>Quite remarkably, GW observatories such as LISA could be used to constrain or find evidence for the existence of these particles. This stems from the fact that rotating BHs can become unstable against the production of light bosonic particles, if such particles exist in nature (Brito et al. 2013(Brito et al. , 2020;;Cardoso et al. 2018a;Damour et al. 1976;Detweiler 1980b;Dolan 2007Dolan , 2018;;East 2017;Frolov et al. 2018;Moschidis 2016;Pani et al. 2012a, b;Shlapentokh-Rothman 2014;Witek et al. 2013), through a process known as BH superradiance (Brito et al. 2015b;Press and Teukolsky 1972;Zel'dovich 1971Zel'dovich , 1972;;Teukolsky and Press 1974). The instability spins the BH down, transferring up to a few percent of the BH's mass and angular momentum to the boson field, forming a long-lived bosonic "cloud" outside the horizon (Arvanitaki and Dubovsky 2011;Arvanitaki et al. 2010Arvanitaki et al. , 2015Arvanitaki et al. , 2017;;Baryakhtar et al. 2017;Brito et al. 2015a, b;Degollado et al. 2018;East 2018;East and Pretorius 2017;Ficarra et al. 2019;Herdeiro and Radu 2014b). Superradiance is most effective when the boson's Compton wavelength is comparable to the BH's gravitational radius (Dolan 2007;Witek et al. 2013), meaning that observations of astrophysical BHs in the supermassive to the stellar mass range, allow us to probe bosons with masses in the range 10 À21 -10 À10 eV.Quite remarkably, GW observatories such as LISA could be used to constrain or find evidence for the existence of these particles.

        <p>For real bosonic fields, the cloud dissipates over long timescales through the emission of nearly-monochromatic GWs with a typical frequency f $ 2c 2 m b =h, where m b is the mass of the field (Arvanitaki and Dubovsky 2011;Arvanitaki et al. 2010Arvanitaki et al. , 2015Arvanitaki et al. , 2017;;Brito et al. 2017a;Baryakhtar et al. 2017;Brito et al. 2017b;East 2018;Siemonsen and East 2020;Yoshino and Kodama 2014). These signals could be observable individually or as a very strong SGWB (Arvanitaki et al. 2015(Arvanitaki et al. , 2017;;Baryakhtar et al. 2017;Brito et al. 2017aBrito et al. , b, 2020;;D'Antonio et al. 2018;Ghosh et al. 2019;Isi et al. 2019b;Sun et al. 2020;Tsukada et al. 2019Tsukada et al. , 2021;;Zhu et al. 2020), and could thus be used to constrain the existence of light bosons in the absence of a detection. Current and future Earth-based detectors could detect GWs emitted by bosons in the range m b $ 10 À14 -10 À11 eV, while LISA could be sensitive to bosons of mass m b $ 10 À19 -10 À15 eV. It has also been proposed that LISA observations of BBHs with total masses in the range $ ½100; 6000 M will provide sufficient information to enable targeted searches for these monochromatic GW signals with future ground-based GW detectors for masses in the range m b $ 10 À14 -10 À12 eV (Ng et al. 2020).For real bosonic fields, the cloud dissipates over long timescales through the emission of nearly-monochromatic GWs with a typical frequency f $ 2c 2 m b =h, where m b is the mass of the field (Arvanitaki and Dubovsky 2011;Arvanitaki et al. 2010Arvanitaki et al. , 2015Arvanitaki et al. , 2017;;Brito et al. 2017a;Baryakhtar et al. 2017;Brito et al. 2017b;East 2018;Siemonsen and East 2020;Yoshino and Kodama 2014).

        <p>Furthermore, since BHs affected by the instability would spin down in the process, accurate measurement of the spin of astrophysical BHs can be used to strongly constrain, or find evidence for, ultralight bosons (Arvanitaki and Dubovsky 2011;Arvanitaki et al. 2015Arvanitaki et al. , 2017;;Baryakhtar et al. 2017;Brito et al. 2013Brito et al. , 2017a;;Cardoso et al. 2018a;Ng et al. 2021;Pani et al. 2012a, b). Requiring that the instability acts on timescales shorter than known astrophysical processes, such as accretion and mergers, current measurements of SMBHs spin using continuum fitting or the Iron Ka (see e.g., Jovanovic 2012) can probe bosons in the mass range m b $ 10 À20 -10 À17 eV, whereas similar measurements for stellar-mass BHs probe the mass range is m b $ 10 À12 -10 À11 eV. LISA is expected to detect binaries and measure the spins of MBHs in the range $ 10 2 -10 7 M and will therefore be able to constrain the existence of light bosons in the intermediate range m b $ 10 À16 -10 À13 eV (Brito et al. 2017a(Brito et al. , 2020;;Cardoso et al. 2018a).Furthermore, since BHs affected by the instability would spin down in the process, accurate measurement of the spin of astrophysical BHs can be used to strongly constrain, or find evidence for, ultralight bosons (Arvanitaki and Dubovsky 2011;Arvanitaki et al. 2015Arvanitaki et al. , 2017;;Baryakhtar et al. 2017;Brito et al. 2013Brito et al. , 2017a;;Cardoso et al. 2018a;Ng et al. 2021;Pani et al. 2012a, b).

        <p>When the BH-boson cloud system is part of a binary, one may also expect new phenomena that could leave imprints in the GW signal emitted by the binary system. For example, the presence of a companion can result in resonant transitions between energy levels of the cloud (Baumann et al. 2019) or complete tidal disruption (Cardoso et al. 2020), which could lead to a significant dephasing of the binary's GW signal. In particular, for EMRIs, resonant transitions could lead to long-lived floating orbits (Baumann et al. 2020;Ferreira et al. 2017;Zhang and Yang 2019). The presence of a cloud would also be imprinted in the binary's GW signal through its spin-induced multiple moment(s) and tidal Love number(s) (Baumann et al. 2019(Baumann et al. , 2020;;De Luca and Pani 2021). For eccentric orbits, resonances can occur over a larger range of frequencies, extending the possibility of detection (Berti et al. 2019). In the case of EMRIs, dynamical friction and the gravitational pull of the cloud may also leave sizable imprints on the GW waveform (Ferreira et al. 2017;Hannuksela et al. 2019;Macedo et al. 2013a;Zhang and Yang 2020).When the BH-boson cloud system is part of a binary, one may also expect new phenomena that could leave imprints in the GW signal emitted by the binary system.

        <p>Ultralight scalars can also form self-gravitating structures. These "dark matter stars" are candidates to describe (dark) haloes in the central part of galaxies (Hui et al. 2017). In this context, it is crucial to understand how such structures respond to external excitations caused by compact objects (e.g. stars or BHs) living in these environments. Stability, proper modes, excitation of resonances, and depletion of the scalar through radiation are amongst the important issues that must be addressed here (Annulli et al. 2020a, b). There is also the potential for distinctive DM density enhancements due to accretion of DM onto BHs (Bamber et al. 2021;Clough et al. 2019;Hui et al. 2019), which is analogous to the case of dark matter spikes for high mass candidates (see Sect. 4.2 below). However, such density enhancements are estimated to be several orders of magnitude weaker than those from a superradiant build up, and concentrated near the BH horizon. They are therefore below LISA sensitivity in the inspiral phase, but may have an impact on merger, something which is yet to be tested using NR simulations. On the other hand, it is also essential to know how the compact objects themselves are affected by the surrounding dark matter. GW dephasing through dynamical friction and scalar radiation deserves a proper and rigorous exploration (Annulli et al. 2020a, b;Hui et al. 2017). In particular, for sources in the LISA band, it was recently found that scalar radiation from these structures affects the gravitational waveform at leading -6 PN order with respect to the dominant quadrupolar term (Annulli et al. 2020a, b).Ultralight scalars can also form self-gravitating structures.

        <p>In summary, LISA has the potential to detect or constrain ultralight DM fields in regions of parameter space complementary to those covered by ground-based GW observations, although more work is needed to build waveform models that incorporate the effects of such fields and are sufficiently accurate to be used for data analysis purposes. It will also be important to explore in more detail BBHs with ultralight boson clouds with full NR simulations in order to understand how the presence of such boson clouds could be imprinted in the late stages of BBH mergers.In summary, LISA has the potential to detect or constrain ultralight DM fields in regions of parameter space complementary to those covered by ground-based GW observations, although more work is needed to build waveform models that incorporate the effects of such fields and are sufficiently accurate to be used for data analysis purposes.

If one or both the components of a binary system are surrounded by a dense dark matter overdensity, the binary's inspiral will be driven by both dynamical friction (Chandrasekhar 1943) and GW emission. The densities required to produce an effect observable by LISA are typically higher than the characteristic DM densities in most galaxies (Barausse et al. 2014;Cardoso and Maselli 2020). There are however several mechanisms by which the DM density can be enhanced to such higher levels, notably when a smaller seed BH grows in mass adiabatically in a DM halo to produce a DM "spike" (Ferrer et al. 2017;Gondolo and Silk 1999;Quinlan et al. 1995;Sadeghian et al. 2013;Ullio et al. 2001). DM spikes around SMBHs at the center of galactic halos are prone to disruption by a number of processes, such as major mergers and gravitational interactions with stellar cusps (Bertone and Merritt 2005;Merritt et al. 2002). DM spikes around IMBHs might be more stable over cosmological timescales, and are arguably more promising targets for indirect and GW searches (Bertone et al. 2005b). The density profile of spikes depends on the nature of DM, with warm, self-interacting, or self-annihilating DM candidates leading to shallower profiles with respect to cold, collisionless DM (Alvarez and Yu 2021;Bertone and Merritt 2005;Gondolo and Silk 1999;Hannuksela et al. 2020;Shapiro and Shelton 2016).We now discuss what we could learn with LISA about more massive cold DM particles.

        <p>The faster rate of inspiral in the presence of DM can be distinguished from the slower inspiral in vacuum, thereby allowing LISA to infer the presence of DM around a binary (Barausse et al. 2014;Eda et al. 2015;Macedo et al. 2013a). The prospects for detecting DM spikes through their influence on the GWs emitted by IMRIs were studied in (Eda et al. 2015), in which the dynamics of the IMRIs were treated in the leading Newtonian limit and the DM distribution was assumed to be static throughout the inspiral. Fisher-matrix forecasts predict that the properties of the DM spike could be mapped precisely for the higher overdensities (comparable to the errors on the detector-frame chirp mass) and to a few tens of a percent for lower overdensities.The faster rate of inspiral in the presence of DM can be distinguished from the slower inspiral in vacuum, thereby allowing LISA to infer the presence of DM around a binary (Barausse et al. 2014;Eda et al. 2015;Macedo et al. 2013a).

        <p>Conservation of energy means, however, that the energy dissipated through dynamical friction must be balanced by a corresponding change in the energy of the dark matter distribution. For a range of different DM overdensities around different IMRIs, the energy dissipated when the DM spike is assumed to be static turns out to be a substantial fraction of the binding energy of the spike, rendering the assumption of staticity questionable. In these cases, it is important to jointly evolve both the IMRIs' orbits and their surrounding distributions of DM (Kavanagh et al. 2020). When this is done, the DM distribution is found to evolve non-trivially, significantly decreasing the amplitude of the dynamical friction force and hence the difference between an inspiral in vacuum and in a DM mini-spike (Kavanagh et al. 2020). Yet for larger DM overdensities, the amplitude of the effect of the DM is seen to remain significant in the coupled evolution of the IMRI and DM spike.Conservation of energy means, however, that the energy dissipated through dynamical friction must be balanced by a corresponding change in the energy of the dark matter distribution.

        <p>A Bayesian analysis of the detectability (signal-to-noise ratio), discoverability (discrimination against in-vacuum inspiral), and measurability (prospects for measuring the parameters) of dark matter environments shows that inspirals in presence of dark matter can be easily discriminated against in-vacuum inspirals. In case of detection, the DM halo's density normalization can be distinguished from zero at high significance, with a 95% credible interval of order 10%. The DM halo's slope can also be measured, although the posterior exhibits degeneracy with the chirp mass and the mass ratio. Interestingly, unlike in-vacuum inspirals, the mass ratio can be measured even in the Newtonian limit (Coogan et al. 2022).A Bayesian analysis of the detectability (signal-to-noise ratio), discoverability (discrimination against in-vacuum inspiral), and measurability (prospects for measuring the parameters) of dark matter environments shows that inspirals in presence of dark matter can be easily discriminated against in-vacuum inspirals.

        <p>For EMRIs and IMRIs in vacuum, there is good evidence that gravitational waveforms that are accurate to first post-adiabatic (1PA) order will be sufficient to detect and perform parameter estimation (van de Meent and Pfeiffer 2020). Such vacuum waveforms are under development and are expected to be ready for the beginning of the LISA mission. By contrast, the waveform modelling for IMRIs and EMRIs with surrounding DM spikes coupled to their evolution is only just beginning: the calculations in Kavanagh et al. (2020) assumed circular orbits and worked at leading Newtonian order. A more complete modelling of these systems will be necessary to produce waveforms that are suitable for describing the full range of possible orbits and DM distributions to cover the parameter space of these systems. The possibility of finding a simpler effective description of IMRIs and EMRIs in DM spikes should be investigated in greater detail, in order to decrease the size of the parameter space needed to look for signatures of cold DM substructures. At the other end of the scale, as in the light dark matter case, it may also be interesting to study whether there is any significant impact of these dark matter overdensities on the merger signal using NR simulations.For EMRIs and IMRIs in vacuum, there is good evidence that gravitational waveforms that are accurate to first post-adiabatic (1PA) order will be sufficient to detect and perform parameter estimation (van de Meent and Pfeiffer 2020).

        <p>For masses smaller than about 10 À17 M , PBHs would have evaporated by now due to the emission of Hawking radiation, and thus do not lead to late-time imprints (Sasaki et al. 2018).

This range of masses is however notoriously difficult to probe with lensing observations. Indeed it was shown that both femtolensing and microlensing searches are not able to constrain this mass window once the extended nature of the source as well as wave optics effects are properly considered (Katz et al. 2018;Montero-Camacho et al. 2019;Smyth et al. 2020). Also, bounds coming from the survival of white dwarfs (WDs) and NSs after asteroidal mass PBHs capture were shown to be unable to constrain the abundance in this range (Montero-Camacho et al. 2019). Finally, the GWs from mergers of subsolar mass PBHs, peaking at much higher frequencies compared to the ones testable by LISA, would not lead to an observable signal.

        <p>There are several current and future experiments searching for this SGWB in various frequency ranges. In the ultra-low frequency range (around nHz), the null detections at Pulsar Timing Array experiments like PPTA (Shannon et al. 2015), NANOGrav (Arzoumanian et al. 2018) and EPTA (Lentati et al. 2015), give rise to stringent constraints on the abundance of GWs (although NANOGrav shows some evidence for a background, as discussed further below). Future experiments like SKA (Dewdney et al. 2009) (see also Moore et al. 2015) will significantly improve the detection sensitivity. These constraints can also be translated into a bound on the amplitude of the comoving curvature perturbations at the corresponding scales (Inomata and Nakama 2019;Ünal et al. 2021). Recently, the Earth-Moon system has been suggested as a detector of SGWB at lHz frequencies (Blas and Jenkins 2022a, b), providing a complementary probe to LISA for signals in this range.There are several current and future experiments searching for this SGWB in various frequency ranges.

        <p>In the intermediate frequency range (around mHz) the most relevant experiment is LISA. LISA will be able to probe the wavenumbers of the primordial curvature perturbation power spectrum on scales in the range ð10 10 À 10 15 Þ Mpc À1 (García-Bellido et al. 2016). Moreover, the production of PBHs with masses around M PBH $ O 10 À15 À 10 À8 ð Þ M would be associated to GW signals with peak frequencies which fall within the LISA sensitivity band. LISA would be therefore able to search for DM candidates in the form of PBHs within this range of masses (Bartolo et al. 2019b;García-Bellido et al. 2016, 2017). Notice that, due to the exponential sensitivity of the PBH abundance to the amplitude of the curvature power spectrum, null detection of a SGWB at LISA would imply the PBH abundance in the corresponding mass range to be negligible.In the intermediate frequency range (around mHz) the most relevant experiment is LISA.

        <p>Recently the NANOGrav Collaboration has published a 12.5 yrs analysis of pulsar timing data reporting strong evidence for a signal whose interpretation in terms of a stochastic common-spectrum process is strongly preferred against independent rednoise signals (Arzoumanian et al. 2020). At the moment, the NANOGrav Collaboration does not yet claim a detection of a SGWB due to the absence of evidence for the characteristic quadrupole correlations.

        <p>As discussed in more detail in the complementary white paper of the Cosmology WG (Auclair et al. 2022), LISA will also be able to search for signatures of primordial non-Gaussianity (Biagetti et al. 2018(Biagetti et al. , 2021;;Ezquiaga and García-Bellido 2018;Ezquiaga et al. 2020a;Franciolini et al. 2018;Pattison et al. 2021) at small scales. Primordial non-Gaussianity on small scales would have an impact on the shape of the SGWB, leading to potentially detectable signatures in the spectrum of frequencies of the observed monopole signal (Cai et al. 2019a;Unal 2019). Possible small deformations smearing the GWs spectrum can also arise from similar effects (Domcke et al. 2020). Non-Gaussian signatures in the tensor three-point function would in principle be significant, but get washed out by (Bartolo et al. 2019b, c) time-delay effects originating during the propagation of the GWs in the perturbed universe, see Bartolo et al. (2018); Margalit et al. (2020). Non-Gaussian signatures may be detectable by searching for angular anisotropies in the SGWB which, in the absence of non-Gaussianity, are generally undetectable at LISA (Bartolo et al. 2020) given its angular resolution of '.15 (Baker et al. 2021;Contaldi et al. 2020). However, local scale-invariant non-Gaussianity, constrained by the Planck Collaboration to be À11:1 f NL 9:3 at 95% C.L. (Planck Collaboration et al. 2020c), would correlate short and long scales and potentially lead to an enhancement of the SGWB, see Cai et al. (2019aCai et al. ( , 2019b)); Unal (2019); for details, and possible largescale anisotropies at detection (Bartolo et al. 2020). Now if PBHs constitute a large fraction of the DM, one expects a highly isotropic and Gaussian SGWB due to the strong constraints by CMB observations (Planck Collaboration et al. 2020b) on the isocurvature modes in the DM density fluid, associated to the non-Gaussianity (Young and Byrnes 2015). On the other hand, the detection of a large amount of anisotropy in the signal would imply that only a small fraction of the DM can be accounted by PBHs (Bartolo et al. 2020). Moreover, the propagation of GWs across disconnected regions of the universe may lead to large-scale anisotropies at detection, see e.g., Alba and Maldacena (2016), Bartolo et al. (2019a), Bartolo et al. (2020), Bertacca et al. (2020), Contaldi (2017), Cusin et al. (2017Cusin et al.

Moreover, the propagation of GWs across disconnected regions of the universe may lead to large-scale anisotropies at detection, see e.g., Alba and Maldacena (2016), Bartolo et al. (2019a), Bartolo et al. (2020), Bertacca et al. (2020), Contaldi (2017), Cusin et al. (2017Cusin et al. ( , 2019)), Jenkins and Sakellariadou (2018) and Renzini and Contaldi (2019).</p>
        <p>In this range of masses, the non detection of a SGWB will rule out the possibility of PBHs being the dark matter in the asteroidal mass range. However, this assumes the standard scenario where GWs are produced at PBH formation and the PBH abundance is exponentially sensitive to the size of the fluctuations. One should investigate whether non standard scenarios would change this conclusion, e.g. the potential role of non-Gaussianity or of other PBH formation mechanisms.In this range of masses, the non detection of a SGWB will rule out the possibility of PBHs being the dark matter in the asteroidal mass range.

        <p>For PBHs with masses larger than about a solar mass, LISA should be able to detect merger events of resolved sources, and unresolved signals in the form of a SGWB. The most relevant constraints come from CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies, which are impacted by the emission of ionizing radiation from PBHs accreting gas in the early universe at redshift between z $ ð300 À 600Þ, for which the PBH abundance is constrained to be below f PBH ðM Þ.ðM =10M Þ À4 for masses smaller than 10 4 M (Ali-Haïmoud and Kamionkowski 2017; Carr et al. 2021;Green and Kavanagh 2021;Serpico et al. 2020). At larger masses, constraints coming from CMB distortions become even more stringent (Nakama et al. 2018).For PBHs with masses larger than about a solar mass, LISA should be able to detect merger events of resolved sources, and unresolved signals in the form of a SGWB.

        <p>Late-time constraints can be set from the comparison of emitted EM signals from accreting PBHs with observations of galactic radio and X-ray isolated sources (Gaggero et al. 2017;Manshanden et al. 2019) and X-ray binaries (Inoue and Kusenko 2017), and from Dwarf Galaxy Heating observations (Lu et al. 2021). The totality of these bounds constrain the PBH abundance f PBH (the fraction of the dark matter composed of PBHs) to be below f PBH .10 À2 for masses larger than few tens of M . A comparable constraint is set by the merger rates observed by the LIGO/ Virgo Collaboration (Abbott et al. 2019c). Indeed, for masses around 30 M , a PBH abundance larger than f PBH % 10 À3 would give an expected number of events larger than the one observed. This has been shown in De Luca et al. (2020c), Hall et al. (2020) and Raidal et al. (2019); using the GWTC-1 data and recently in Wong et al. (2021) with the GWTC-2 catalog. Even though PBHs are expected to follow a Poisson distribution at formation in the absence of non-Gaussianities (Ali-Haïmoud 2018; Ballesteros et al. 2018;Desjacques and Riotto 2018;Moradinezhad Dizgah et al. 2019), they may start forming clusters even before the matter-radiation equality for large enough f PBH (Inman and Ali-Haïmoud 2019). Clustering has an impact on the PBH binary formation and subsequent disruption rates (Jedamzik 2020(Jedamzik , 2021;;Raidal et al. 2019;Trashorras et al. 2021). While ineffective for abundances smaller than f PBH .10 À2 , it is expected to reduce the merger rate prediction for larger abundances by an amount which is not enough to evade the LIGO/Virgo bound if one takes into account the fraction of PBHs in dense substructures (De Luca et al. 2020;Tkachev et al. 2020;Vaskonen and Veermäe 2020). Overall, we stress that a complete description of PBH clustering up to very low redshift along with its impact on the GW signals coming from a PBH population still represents one of the main theoretical challenges, which deserves a thorough investigation.Late-time constraints can be set from the comparison of emitted EM signals from accreting PBHs with observations of galactic radio and X-ray isolated sources (Gaggero et al. 2017;Manshanden et al. 2019) and X-ray binaries (Inoue and Kusenko 2017), and from Dwarf Galaxy Heating observations (Lu et al. 2021).

        <p>Even if PBHs within this mass range can only account for a small fraction of the dark matter in the universe, they could still both form binaries observable by LISA and act as progenitors of SMBHs, observed at high redshift as large as zJ6, through accretion of baryonic particles during the cosmological evolution (Clesse and García-Bellido 2015;Serpico et al. 2020). The presence of a strong phase of accretion through the cosmological history before the reionization epoch has the effect of shifting the corresponding late-time mass function to larger masses relaxing the constraints (De Luca et al. 2020b), even though large uncertainties are present in modelling the accretion for massive compact objects. This is a key challenge to overcome in order to assess the PBH contribution to merging binaries observable by LISA.

        <p>Given that PBHs may potentially contribute to current GW data (Franciolini et al. 2021), within this range of masses they need to be distinguished from astrophysical 123BHs formed after the collapse of stars in the late universe. Various observables could however help in discriminating the two populations. For instance, even though PBHs are expected to form with small spins (De Luca et al. 2019a;Mirbabayi et al. 2020), for PBH binaries in the mass range observable by LISA, the baryonic mass accretion leads to spin growth, potentially increasing their spins for the binary components at the merger time depending on the accretion strength before the reionization epoch (De Luca et al. 2020d), which is still however affected by many uncertainties. It is of crucial importance to investigate in details the correlation between PBH masses and spins induced by baryonic accretion as a discriminant with the prediction for astrophysical BHs. Another possibility is to look for high redshift events (i.e. zJ30) where PBHs can contribute without any astrophysical contamination (Chen and Huang 2020; De Luca et al. 2021;Koushiappas and Loeb 2017).Given that PBHs may potentially contribute to current GW data (Franciolini et al. 2021), within this range of masses they need to be distinguished from astrophysical 123BHs formed after the collapse of stars in the late universe.

        <p>Furthermore, the massive BBH merger population currently observed at LIGO/ Virgo is expected to give rise to a SGWB of unresolved sources with a tail at low frequencies which can be detected by LISA (Chen et al. 2019;Clesse and García-Bellido 2017). The primordial scenario is expected to give a stronger contribution to the SGWB with respect to the astrophysical one, due to the additional contribution given by PBH mergers happening at higher redshift (Raidal et al. 2019). In particular, the PBHs merger rate is expected to increase with redshift, while the one of stellar BHs first increases and peaks at redshift around z $ ð1 À 2Þ, and then rapidly decreases (Chen et al. 2019).

        <p>To summarize, LISA would be sensitive to many different GW signals coming from a PBH population in this mass range. Given its sensitivity to BH mergers at high redshifts and large masses, even reaching the supermassive range, it will complement the reach of ground-based detectors to search for PBHs and inform models of PBH accretion. On the theoretical side, a future goal is to sharpen the predictions for the impact of accretion and clustering on the evolution of PBH binaries and the generation of SMBHs from PBH seeds (Serpico et al. 2020), in order to differentiate between BHs with a primordial origin and those formed from stellar evolution.To summarize, LISA would be sensitive to many different GW signals coming from a PBH population in this mass range.

        <p>Self-interactions in DM were proposed as a way to solve tensions on small scales between N-body simulations and DM observations (Spergel and Steinhardt 2000), but for hard interactions these are constrained to be of order r=m\1 cm 2 g À1 $ 10 À24 cm 2 GeV À1 to maintain consistency with structure formation and observations of the Bullet Cluster (Randall et al. 2008). At the upper end of this range, they have a non-negligible effect on structures at typical DM halo densities and velocity dispersions (see Tulin and Yu 2018 for a review).

However, it seems unlikely that such a formation mechanism could be identified from LISA observations. SIDM could also undergo dissipative collapse to form compact dark disks (Fan et al. 2013), which could potentially be detectable via their consequent density enhancements in the same way as the superradiant clouds or DM spikes described above.It has been proposed that a small amount of SIDM, composing less than 10% of the DM, with cross section r=m ) 1 cm 2 =g, could have seeded the initial growth of SMBHs (Pollack et al. 2015), which are a key LISA target.

        <p>In the case of light bosonic DM, self-interactions may play an important role in superradiant instabilities and, moreover, are an essential part of some models such as 123 axions, where the massive potential is an approximation to a more general periodic function. Studies of superradiance have mostly treated self-interactions in the bosonic field as negligible, but in Yoshino and Kodama (2012, 2014, 2015) attractive selfinteractions were shown to destabilise the superradiant build up, resulting in a so called "bosenova". Such collapses have been conjectured to result in repeating instabilities, where the fall of the cloud back into the BH prior to saturation results in it being "spun up" again, and thus the superradiant growth resumes. This could weaken constraints that have been derived in the purely massive case, or lead to potentially observable GW signals from the bosenova explosions. The frequency of the bosenova signal would be f $ 1=Dt where Dt is the duration of the bosenova. This is in the LISA band for SMBHs, but would be below detection sensitivity unless it occurs in our own or a nearby galaxy (Yoshino and Kodama 2012). More work is required to simulate a complete build up and dissipation of the bosonic cloud, to further quantify the GW signals produced and to confirm that the superradiant build up is able to recover. Due to the long timescales involved, such simulations are very challenging, but feasible with current NR tools.In the case of light bosonic DM, self-interactions may play an important role in superradiant instabilities and, moreover, are an essential part of some models such as 123 axions, where the massive potential is an approximation to a more general periodic function.

        <p>If dark matter particles interact at all with standard model particles, the interaction must be weak, given the constraints that have been imposed by terrestrial direct detection experiments and indirect astrophysical observations (see e.g., Bertone et al. 2005a; Irastorza and Redondo 2018; Kahlhoefer 2017 for reviews).

        <p>In particular, many cosmological observations indicate that the Universe is currently undergoing accelerated expansion. To explain this observation assuming GR, the KCDM model requires that the energy density of the vacuum is comparable to the total energy density of the Universe. However, quantum vacuum fluctuations of all particles contribute to the vacuum energy by an amount which is expected to be many orders of magnitudes larger than its measured value. This mismatch is called the old cosmological constant problem (see e.g., Burgess 2015;Padilla 2015) and it is one of the most disconcerting puzzles in fundamental physics (see e.g., Alberte et al. 2016;Bousso 2008;Charmousis et al. 2012;Kaloper and Padilla 2014).In particular, many cosmological observations indicate that the Universe is currently undergoing accelerated expansion.

However, quantum vacuum fluctuations of all particles contribute to the vacuum energy by an amount which is expected to be many orders of magnitudes larger than its measured value.

        <p>This situation constitutes a theoretical motivation to consider alternatives to KCDM in which one assumes that for some unknown reason the value of K is simply zero-dubbed the new cosmological constant problem-and attempts to explain the accelerated expansion by different mechanisms. This has spurred the exploration of variations of the KCDM model in which the energy budget of the Universe is dominated by some dynamical dark energy, distinct from a constant K, or where the observed acceleration is explained by a modification of gravity (see Amendola et al. 2018b;Clifton et al. 2012 for a review). This field of investigation has been rich of interesting theoretical developments and is currently energized by the prospect that a number of forthcoming galaxy surveys will test and tightly constrain these models in the near future (see e.g., Frusciante and Perenon 2020). A second theoretical motivation for considering modified gravity extensions of KCDM is the so-called coincidence problem (Zlatev et al. 1999), the observation that the current vacuum energy density is comparable to the matter density, even though the former remains constant in time while the latter dilutes with the expansion.This situation constitutes a theoretical motivation to consider alternatives to KCDM in which one assumes that for some unknown reason the value of K is simply zero-dubbed the new cosmological constant problem-and attempts to explain the accelerated expansion by different mechanisms.

        <p>Quite apart from these theoretical considerations, several tensions have emerged in the KCDM model from recent observations. The most notable one is the discrepancy between the values of the Hubble constant measured through CMB (Planck Collaboration et al. 2020a) and large-scale structure (D'Amico et al. 2021;Philcox et al. 2020) observations on the one hand, and those measured by late-time probes (Huang et al. 2020;Jee et al. 2019;Pesce et al. 2020;Riess et al. 2019;Verde et al. 2019) on the other hand. Other milder tensions include the difference between the amplitude of matter fluctuations measured by Planck versus that inferred from weak lensing observations (Heymans and other 2021;Tröster et al. 2020), as well as the lensing excess in the CMB temperature Planck data (Planck Collaboration et al. 2014, 2016, 2020a). While it is possible that these tensions could be accounted for by some yet unknown systematics, several proposals have attempted to explain these discrepancies by new physics.Quite apart from these theoretical considerations, several tensions have emerged in the KCDM model from recent observations.

        <p>Dark energy and modified gravity are extensions of the KCDM scenario. Although a strict distinction between the two does not exist (Joyce et al. 2016), the former usually refers to adding to the field equations the stress-energy tensor of a fluid responsible for the acceleration, leaving the Einstein tensor unchanged, while the latter refers to either changing the gravitational part of the field equations or adding a non-minimal coupling to matter. Since at low-energy GR is the unique Lorentzinvariant theory of a massless helicity-2 field (Weinberg 1964), in most cases (see e. g., Lin and Mukohyama 2017 for an exception) one must add additional degrees of freedom to those present in GR.Dark energy and modified gravity are extensions of the KCDM scenario.

        <p>In the simplest case, dark energy and modified gravity rely on the presence of a scalar field that spontaneously breaks time parametrizations, inducing a preferred slicing. Since in cosmology we are interested in studying fluctuations around FLRW solutions, a particularly convenient way to parametrize the action in this case is to use the so-called Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy (Bloomfield et al. 2013;Creminelli et al. 2009;Gleyzes et al. 2013;Gubitosi et al. 2013), which consists in writing the action in terms of all possible operators in this foliation (Cheung et al. 2008;Creminelli et al. 2006). This allows one to describe a large class of models, including f(R) theory (see Sotiriou and Faraoni 2010 for a review), Horndeski theories (Deffayet et al. 2009;Horndeski 1974) and beyond (Ben Achour et al. 2016;Gleyzes et al. 2015;Langlois and Noui 2016;Zumalacárregui and García-Bellido 2014), and Lorentz violating theories (Horava 2009a), in terms of a fewer number of parameters, corresponding to time-dependent functions. More generally, requirements such as locality, causality, unitarity and stability can be automatically enforced on the action so that the predicted signatures are consistent with well-established principles of physics. The generality of this approach has been successfully applied to the implementation of Einstein-Boltzmann solvers such as EFTCAMB (Hu et al. 2014;Raveri et al. 2014) and hi_class (Zumalacárregui et al. 2017) and the derivation of observational constraints and forecasts in a model-independent fashion (see Frusciante and Perenon 2020 for a recent review).In the simplest case, dark energy and modified gravity rely on the presence of a scalar field that spontaneously breaks time parametrizations, inducing a preferred slicing.

        <p>In these extensions of KCDM, we can identify two main classes of modifications to the propagation of GWs with observational implications. The first is a scaleindependent additional friction term in the propagation equation, discussed in Sect. 5.2.2, which can be traced to the fact that the effective Planck mass that canonically normalizes the graviton can be time-dependent in models of modified gravity. In this case, the effect amounts simply to a rescaling of the graviton amplitude between the time of emission and the one of observation. The second class are scale-dependent modifications such as an anomalous speed of propagation, effects in the dispersion relation, GW decay, etc. These are thoroughly discussed in Secs. 2.2.2 and 6.3.2 and will not be treated here.In these extensions of KCDM, we can identify two main classes of modifications to the propagation of GWs with observational implications.

        <p>Another possibility, leading to scale-independent modifications that have been much investigated recently, is that the long-distance behavior of gravity is modified by quantum effects. The presence of infrared (IR) divergences in space-times of cosmological interest, such as de Sitter (Antoniadis and Mottola 1991;Taylor and Veneziano 1990;Tsamis and Woodard 1995), suggests that, even without adding new degrees of freedom or modifying the fundamental action of the theory, the longdistance dynamics of gravity could be different from that derived from the classical Einstein-Hilbert action. When quantum effects enter into play the relevant quantity, rather than the fundamental action, is the quantum effective action. While the former, according to basic principles of quantum field theory, is local, the latter unavoidably develops non-local terms whenever the spectrum of the theory contains massless particles, such as the graviton.Another possibility, leading to scale-independent modifications that have been much investigated recently, is that the long-distance behavior of gravity is modified by quantum effects.

        <p>An extensive series of investigations (see Belgacem et al. 2018b, 2020 for reviews) have eventually led to identify a unique candidate model (the so-called 'RT' model originally proposed in Maggiore 2014). Physically, this model corresponds to assuming that IR effects generate a non-local mass term for the conformal mode of the metric. At the conceptual level, this is appealing because of various arguments that identify the conformal mode as the main candidate for producing strong IR 123 quantum effects (Antoniadis andMottola 1991, 1992). Tentative evidence for the generation of this specific non-local term in the quantum effective action has also emerged from lattice gravity simulations (Knorr and Saueressig 2018). At the phenomenological level, the model passes Solar System tests (Kehagias and Maggiore 2014) and limits on the time variation of Newton's constant (Belgacem et al. 2019b), it generates a dark energy dynamically (Maggiore 2014), and its cosmological perturbations, in the scalar sector, are well-behaved and quite close to those of KCDM (Dirian et al. 2014). The model has been compared to CMB, BAO, SNe and structure formation data, and fits them at the same level as KCDM (Belgacem et al. 2018b;Dirian et al. 2016). A main surprise then came from the study of tensor perturbations (Belgacem et al. 2018b(Belgacem et al. , 2019a)): The model displays the phenomenon of modified GW propagation that will be discussed below, whose amplitude can be significant. At the redshifts relevant for LISA, the deviations with respect to GR can even be of order 80% (depending on a free parameter of the model, related to the initial conditions). A complete and up-to-date review of the conceptual and phenomenological aspects of the model is given in Belgacem et al.

        <p>Apart from its specific features, this model also provides an explicit example of a modification of GR that is very close to KCDM, at the percent level, for the background cosmological evolution and for the scalar perturbations (therefore complying with existing limits), while at the same time producing very large deviations from GR in the sector of tensor perturbations. In the context of scalartensor theories described by the effective field theory of dark energy, a similar case is discussed in Lombriser and Taylor (2016). This shows how the study of GWs on cosmological scales is a genuinely new window, accessible to LISA, that can produce significant surprises.Apart from its specific features, this model also provides an explicit example of a modification of GR that is very close to KCDM, at the percent level, for the background cosmological evolution and for the scalar perturbations (therefore complying with existing limits), while at the same time producing very large deviations from GR in the sector of tensor perturbations.

        <p>Other interesting models to test with LISA are the so-called early dark energy (Wetterich 2004) and interacting dark energy (Amendola 2000;Wetterich 1995) scenarios. The former consists of a redshift-dependent dark energy component which gives a non-negligible cosmological contribution at early times, in contrast to the more standard dark energy used to explain the late-time cosmic acceleration. The presence of early dark energy in the cosmological energy budget affects the CMB anisotropies and polarization and the inferred constraints can change by varying the epoch at which early dark energy starts to contribute (Pettorino et al. 2013). In the context of LISA, early dark energy can be tested by measuring the distance-redshift relation at high redshift (see Sect. 5.2.2). As such, LISA can be complementary to other cosmological probes, such as the CMB, in helping to resolve the H 0 -tension for which such early dark energy models are candidate solutions (Caprini and Tamanini 2016).Other interesting models to test with LISA are the so-called early dark energy (Wetterich 2004) and interacting dark energy (Amendola 2000;Wetterich 1995) scenarios.

        <p>Interacting dark energy is characterized by a direct coupling between dark energy and dark matter, while ordinary matter remains uncoupled from dark energy and gravity is described by the ordinary Einstein-Hilbert action (i.e., in the so-called Einstein frame). It can be motivated, for instance, by the fact that it can alleviate the coincidence problem mentioned in the introduction (Amendola 2000;Wetterich 1995). In this scenario, the propagation of GWs is modified through a change in the Hubble friction arising from an altered cosmic expansion history (Caprini and Tamanini 2016;Dalang and Lombriser 2019). As for early dark energy, interacting dark energy can be tested by LISA by accurately probing the background expansion history and the luminosity distance-redshift relation.Interacting dark energy is characterized by a direct coupling between dark energy and dark matter, while ordinary matter remains uncoupled from dark energy and gravity is described by the ordinary Einstein-Hilbert action (i.e., in the so-called Einstein frame).

        <p>Modifications of gravity that aim to explain the cosmic acceleration often entail extra light fields which, besides changing the cosmic expansion, manifest themselves at short distances, mediating a fifth force. To pass Solar System and binary-pulsar tests, screening mechanisms are therefore necessary to hide, or strongly suppress, local deviations from GR (see e.g., Joyce et al. 2015). Different types of screening mechanisms have been proposed over the years, all relying on non-linear physics becoming important close to matter sources. Here we discuss only modified gravity models based on a scalar field. In chameleon and symmetron screening (Hinterbichler and Khoury 2010; Khoury and Weltman 2004), non-trivial self-interactions and non-minimal couplings to matter dynamically suppress deviations from GR in high-density environments (see Burrage and Sakstein 2018 for a review), however these theories were shown to have a negligible effect on cosmological scales (Wang et al. 2012). Self-interactions involving one or two derivatives of the field are at the origin of, respectively, k-mouflage (Babichev et al. 2009) and Vainshtein Babichev and Deffayet (2013); Vainshtein (1972) screening. These kinetic types of screening allow to reconcile theories such as Horndeski and DHOST, or massive (bi)gravity, with local tests of gravity. However, it is worth noticing that, until recently, kinetic screening had been thoroughly tested in static/quasi-static configurations, while it was less studied in dynamical settings, e.g. at GW generation (Chu and Trodden 2013;Dar et al. 2019;de Rham et al. 2013b, a). Only very recently, numerical relativity simulations have been performed, which point at a partial breakdown of the screening in black-hole collapse (Bezares et al. 2021;ter Haar et al. 2021) and in the late inspiral and merger of binary neutron stars (Bezares et al. 2022). In more detail, stellar collapse seems (quite surprisingly) to produce a very low frequency signal potentially detectable by LISA, while waveforms from binary neutron stars seem to deviate from their GR counterparts at the quadrupole (but not dipole) multipole order.Modifications of gravity that aim to explain the cosmic acceleration often entail extra light fields which, besides changing the cosmic expansion, manifest themselves at short distances, mediating a fifth force.

        <p>In general, when screening is efficient, one can define three gravitational constants. The one experienced by GWs, G gw ;7 the one felt by matter appearing in the Poisson equation, G dyn ; the one felt by light intervening in null geodesics, G light . These three constants are generally different and independent from each other (Dalang and Lombriser 2019;Lombriser and Taylor 2016;Tsujikawa 2019;Wolf and Lagos 2020), even when submitted to the constraints coming from Solar System tests, such as lunar-laser ranging (Williams et al. 2004), which tests G dyn , and the Cassini bound (Bertotti et al. 2003), which tests a combination of G dyn and G light . However, GW constraints can provide independent relations among them. For instance, in Horndeski theory the combination of Solar System tests and the fact that c T ¼ 1 imposes that G gw varies very little with the redshift, implying that observational signatures in distance tests could be challenging (Dalang and Lombriser 2019;Dalang et al. 2020;Lagos and Zhu 2020; Wolf and Lagos 2020) (see Eq. ( 12) below).In general, when screening is efficient, one can define three gravitational constants.

        <p>This conclusion, however, is evaded in theories that extend Horndeski gravity, such as GLPV and DHOST theories, where additional parameters can lift the degeneracy. In these theories, even when imposing c T ¼ 1, the three constants remain independent (Crisostomi and Koyama 2018b;Crisostomi et al. 2019;Dima and Vernizzi 2018;Langlois et al. 2018;Lombriser and Taylor 2016) and there can be effects in the luminosity distance. The recovered degeneracy can, however, be broken again if other constraints are imposed, such as those from the instability of GWs (Creminelli et al. 2020). Another example where these constants remain independent is massive gravity (de Rham et al. 2011) or bigravity (Hassan and Rosen 2012), see Babichev and Crisostomi (2013); Koyama et al. (2011).

        <p>Standard sirens with LISA will provide a formidable probe of the cosmicexpansion history, from low and intermediate redshifts of z.0:1 and 0:1.z.1 with stellar-mass BBHs and EMRIs, to deep redshifts of z.10 for MBBHs. This will naturally place stringent constraints on a great amount of dark energy models (see e. g., Belgacem et al. 2019c;Tamanini et al. 2016). While the low-redshift data will be of particular interest for cosmic acceleration (Lombriser and Taylor 2016), the highredshift data will provide invaluable constraints on early dark energy (Caprini and Tamanini 2016) in a regime that is not accessible to other observational methods such as large-scale structure surveys.Standard sirens with LISA will provide a formidable probe of the cosmicexpansion history, from low and intermediate redshifts of z.0:1 and 0:1.z.1 with stellar-mass BBHs and EMRIs, to deep redshifts of z.10 for MBBHs.

        <p>When an EM counterpart is not available, one can still obtain the redshift information in a statistical way. One method relies on the use of cross-correlation of each GW event with a galaxy catalogue, which provides a set of potential hosts inside the GW localization volume times its redshift uncertainty, computed from the GW distance measurements by taking into account the full prior range on all cosmological parameters (Abbott et al. 2021a;Chen et al. 2018;Schutz 1986;Del Pozzo 2012;Fishbach et al. 2019;Gray et al. 2020;MacLeod and Hogan 2008;Palmese et al. 2020;Soares-Santos et al. 2019;Vasylyev and Filippenko 2020). Combination of multiple events can significantly increase the constraining power of this method, as results from spurious galaxies will eventually average out. On the other hand, one has to properly take into account accurate modelling of the redshift uncertainties of galaxy catalogues, completeness issues-which can be relevant for sources at high redshift-and GW selection effects. The ideal candidates in this case are events with good localization and distance measurement, so that the potential hosts are in limited number (or even unique; Borhanian et al. 2020), at redshifts such that the available catalogues have a sufficient completeness (Del Pozzo et al. 2018).When an EM counterpart is not available, one can still obtain the redshift information in a statistical way.

        <p>As an alternative to the use of a galaxy catalogue, the redshift information can be obtained from the fact that the GW waveform gives the masses of the binaries redshifted by cosmic expansion. Information about the mass distribution of GW sources can then break this mass-redshift degeneracy and allow a test of the luminosity distance-redshift relation. For stellar-mass BHs, this can be done by exploiting the presence of a mass scale in the population (Farr et al. 2019;Ezquiaga and Holz 2021;You et al. 2021).

        <p>The present value of the Hubble parameter H 0 is one of the fundamental parameters of the KCDM model. Over the last few years, a disagreement has persisted between local measurements obtained from the late-time distance ladder (such as the type Ia supernovae calibrated by cepheids, Riess et al. 2018) and the value inferred from early-time observables such as the CMB (Planck Collaboration et al. 2020b) and the large-scale structure (D'Amico et al. 2021;Philcox et al. 2020) (see e.g., Shah et al. 2021 for a recent review on the Hubble constant tension). In the next decade, GWs will play a crucial role in constraining H 0 . The luminosity distance of a BBH and a BNS can be inferred and calibrated using an empirically constructed distance ladder at various distance scales. If combined with the known redshift of the host galaxy, the present rate of H 0 can then be estimated (Schutz 1986), as it is done using type Ia supernovae via the local distance ladder (Riess et al. 2016) The first standard siren-based H 0 measurement came from the neutron-star merger event, GW170817, with the optical counterpart identification of the host galaxy, NGC 4993. While currently the observations of this merger set a loose constraint of H 0 ¼ 70 þ12 À8 at 1r (Abbott et al. 2017a), future detections of additional GW standard sirens, obtained with ground-based second-generation detectors at full sensitivity, have the power to constrain the Hubble parameter to an accuracy of $ 1% with an error that depends on the number of detected events (Chen et al. 2018;Nissanke et al. 2013) and redshift distribution (Dalal et al. 2006). Notably, for nearby sources, the Fig. 3 The 1r and 2r contours of the two-dimensional likelihood in the ðN 0 ; w 0 Þ plane, with the combined contribution from CMB?BAO?SNe (red) and the combined contours from CMB?BAO?SNe?LISA standard sirens (blue).

(2019c) 123 dominant uncertainty comes from the error on the peculiar velocities when correcting the measurement of the observed redshift (Boruah et al. 2021;Nicolaou et al. 2020). A recent work by the LISA Cosmology WG (Belgacem et al. 2019c) forecast H 0 within the KCDM scenario using MBH and found the relative error to be 3.8% in the optimistic case for the accuracy of redshift measurement and delensing and 7.7% in the more realistic case (see also Tamanini et al. 2016).The present value of the Hubble parameter H 0 is one of the fundamental parameters of the KCDM model.

While currently the observations of this merger set a loose constraint of H 0 ¼ 70 þ12 À8 at 1r (Abbott et al. 2017a), future detections of additional GW standard sirens, obtained with ground-based second-generation detectors at full sensitivity, have the power to constrain the Hubble parameter to an accuracy of $ 1% with an error that depends on the number of detected events (Chen et al. 2018;Nissanke et al. 2013) and redshift distribution (Dalal et al. 2006). Notably, for nearby sources, the Fig. 3 The 1r and 2r contours of the two-dimensional likelihood in the ðN 0 ; w 0 Þ plane, with the combined contribution from CMB?BAO?SNe (red) and the combined contours from CMB?BAO?SNe?LISA standard sirens (blue). Left: heavy seads and no-delay ("hnd") scenario; right: "pop III" seeds. From Belgacem et al. (2019c) 123 dominant uncertainty comes from the error on the peculiar velocities when correcting the measurement of the observed redshift (Boruah et al. 2021;Nicolaou et al. 2020). A recent work by the LISA Cosmology WG (Belgacem et al. 2019c) forecast H 0 within the KCDM scenario using MBH and found the relative error to be 3.8% in the optimistic case for the accuracy of redshift measurement and delensing and 7.7% in the more realistic case (see also Tamanini et al. 2016).</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the rate of dark GW events without detection of EM counterpart, such as EMRIs, SOBHBs, or IMBHBs, should be much higher than those with EM counterpart (Lyutikov 2016). To these dark sirens are also added all events whose EM counterpart will be difficult to identify, such as possible well-localised SMBHs at relatively low-redshift (Petiteau et al. 2011). The strategy adopted by GW detectors then consists in estimating the Hubble parameter for each potential host galaxy of the GW, resulting in an average value of H 0 (Chen et al. 2018;Fishbach et al. 2019;Schutz 1986), as done for the GW170814 event (Soares- Santos et al. 2019). In this context, the accurate sky location provided by LISA for the identification of the host galaxy of the GW event is definitely a major advantage (Kyutoku and Seto 2017) and the use of redshift catalogs from large-scale spectroscopic galaxy surveys such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) (Aghamousa et al. 2016), 4MOST (de Jong et al. 2012) or Euclid (Amendola et al. 2018b) will therefore be required to improve the Hubble constant measurement. Notably, LISA should be able to observe up to $ 100 stellar-mass BBHs within 100 Mpc, providing a few % measurement of H 0 (Del Pozzo et al. 2018;Kyutoku and Seto 2016). This number however strongly depends on the performance of LISA at the high end of its frequency band, which is not guaranteed to provide the required sensitivity (Moore et al. 2019). A more promising population of dark sirens may be provided by EMRIs, which depending on the actual rate at which they will be detected, will yield constraints on H 0 at the few to one % level (Laghi et al. 2021).Furthermore, the rate of dark GW events without detection of EM counterpart, such as EMRIs, SOBHBs, or IMBHBs, should be much higher than those with EM counterpart (Lyutikov 2016).

        <p>The current forecasts mentioned here above do not indicate that LISA will be able to contribute to solving the Hubble tension, which by the 2030s is expected to be largely solved by other observations. However they show that LISA will provide strong complementary constraints on H 0 , which will be used to corroborate results obtained with other measurements and different techniques. This kind of crossvalidation will be extremely important to reinforce our confidence on the actual value of the Hubble constant, especially if hints of deviations from KCDM will have been observed.The current forecasts mentioned here above do not indicate that LISA will be able to contribute to solving the Hubble tension, which by the 2030s is expected to be largely solved by other observations.

        <p>For the resolved-event case, the GWÂLSS correlation can be used for a variety of tests. By measuring the effective bias of the hosts of compact-object mergers, one can get information about the presence and abundance of PBHs. This happens because binary PBHs would preferentially merge in halos with low velocity dispersion, and hence halos with very little or absent star formation, which have a galaxy bias b\1. On the other hand, mergers of compact objects that are the endpoint of stellar evolution naturally happen for the vast majority within star forming-rich halos, which have larger galaxy bias values, b [ 1, where in the linear bias scheme, b quantifies the mismatch between the distribution of matter and that of galaxies, d g ¼ bd m . Therefore, by measuring the amplitude of the angular cross correlation of galaxy maps with catalogues of compact-object mergers, which directly depends on the bias of the mergers' hosts, one can statistically probe the abundance of PBH mergers. This information can also be used to discriminate between different astrophysical models (see e.g., Scelfo et al. 2020) When EM counterparts are available (or the redshift determination of BBHs is available through other methods), the GWÂLSS correlation can be used to test the distance-redshift relation (Oguri 2016) and models of dark energy and modified gravity (Camera and Nishizawa 2013;Mukherjee et al. 2020a;Raccanelli 2017;Raccanelli et al. 2018).For the resolved-event case, the GWÂLSS correlation can be used for a variety of tests.

        <p>In the case of the SGWB, the cross correlation with the LSS will be fundamental to understand the observed signal.

        <p>Similarly to EM radiation, GWs experience the gravitational potential of massive objects while traveling across the Universe. This opens the possibility of both probing the distribution of structures in the cosmos and the underlying gravitational interactions. LISA will offer a unique perspective since it will detect high-redshift GWs in a lower frequency band compared to ground-based detectors, increasing the lensing probabilities and the detectability of diffraction effects.Similarly to EM radiation, GWs experience the gravitational potential of massive objects while traveling across the Universe.

        <p>The probability that a GW is lensed depends on the redshift of the source and the distribution of lenses. For high-redshift GWs, intervening matter between the source and the observer can magnify the GW signal and introduce a systematic error in the determination of the luminosity distance. Correcting for this weak-lensing effect will be relevant when inferring cosmological and population parameters from GW standard sirens (Cusin and Tamanini 2021;Fleury et al. 2017;Hirata et al. 2010;Hughes and Holz 2003). A fraction of these GW events will pass close enough to the lens so that lensing will produce multiple images of the same event. LISA could detect a few strongly-lensed massive black-hole binaries during its mission (Sereno et al. 2010). The detection of multiple lensing events could provide new means for cosmography with LISA (Sereno et al. 2011).The probability that a GW is lensed depends on the redshift of the source and the distribution of lenses.

        <p>In the strong-lensing regime the time delay between the images increases linearly with the mass of the lens, reaching delays of months for a 10 12 M galaxy lens. Each of the lensed images will have a different magnification and they will acquire a fixed phase shift depending on how many times the image has crossed a lens caustic (Schneider et al. 1992). The precise measurement by LISA of the phase of long duration signals could be key in distinguishing different types of lensed images (Ezquiaga et al. 2021a).In the strong-lensing regime the time delay between the images increases linearly with the mass of the lens, reaching delays of months for a 10 12 M galaxy lens.

        <p>When time delays between lensed images become shorter than the signal's duration, interference effects among the images become relevant. This wave-optics regime is achieved when the wavelength of the GW is comparable to the Schwarzschild radius of the lens. Since LISA will observe lower frequencies, diffraction effects will be more relevant than for ground-based detectors (Takahashi and Nakamura 2003). In the diffraction limit the GW waveform can be distorted and one could use these features to identify the event as lensed (Dai et al. 2018). In addition, these distortions may make the GW phase to appear to arrive earlier than an unlensed EM signal (Morita and Soda 2019;Takahashi 2017), although this is only an apparent superluminality (Ezquiaga et al. 2020b;Suyama 2020). This effect has to be taken into account (Ezquiaga et al. 2020b) when for example inferring constraints on the speed of gravity from the possible pre-merger modulated EM brightness of a super-massive BBH (Haiman 2017). If these lensing features distorting the GW waveform are not properly identified, they could be misinterpreted as modified gravity, see e.g., Cusin and Lagos (2020); Ezquiaga et al.

        <p>For the test to be effective, it is critical to characterize the statistical properties of the residual. The data from GW detectors is often contaminated by non-stationary and non-Gaussian background. Thus, one cannot simply ask if the residual is consistent with a Gaussian distribution but one must ask if it is consistent with the detector noise at times when no GW signals are known to be present. One can deploy statistical tools such as Anderson-Darling or Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to compare the residual with the data at other times. Alternatively, one can use a transient detection algorithm, e.g. Bayeswave (Cornish and Littenberg 2015), to estimate the coherent SNR in the residual data at a certain statistical significance and ask what is the probability that one gets an SNR as large as for data sets that contain only noise.For the test to be effective, it is critical to characterize the statistical properties of the residual.

        <p>By construction, the residual test is the most generic model-independent method that one can construct. This is because, the test does not require any non-GR waveforms, does not use additional parameters in the waveform to look for deviations (unlike, e.g., in parameterized tests of GR described in Sect. 6.2 below) and is sensitive to departures from GR outside the region where GR waveform has most of its support, (e.g. echoes). Its drawback, however, is that subtle departures from GR cannot be easily identified since the test is not phase coherent and the purely statistical nature will make it difficult to identify the origin of the failure of the theory.By construction, the residual test is the most generic model-independent method that one can construct.

        <p>The orbital dynamics of a BBH essentially consists of three phases: (i) a long adiabatic inspiral phase during which the companion objects slowly spiral in towards each other as they lose energy to GWs, (ii) a rapid plunge-merger phase during which the system cannot be described by orbital dynamics as the horizons of the two BHs merge to form a single horizon, and (iii) a final ringdown phase during which the merger remnant quickly settles down to its final stationary state. An IMR consistency test compares the parameters determined using the inspiral phase of the signal only to those obtained using the late-time merger-ringdown phase (Ghosh et al. 2018(Ghosh et al. , 2016b)). If GR correctly describes both the inspiral and the plunge-merger regimes then the parameters determined from these two phases would be consistent with each other, within statistical uncertainties associated with the measurement; any discrepancy would then be a hint of a failure of the theory.The orbital dynamics of a BBH essentially consists of three phases: (i) a long adiabatic inspiral phase during which the companion objects slowly spiral in towards each other as they lose energy to GWs, (ii) a rapid plunge-merger phase during which the system cannot be described by orbital dynamics as the horizons of the two BHs merge to form a single horizon, and (iii) a final ringdown phase during which the merger remnant quickly settles down to its final stationary state.

        <p>The IMR test currently implemented by the LIGO/Virgo Collaboration (Abbott et al. 2019b(Abbott et al. , 2016b) ) translates the intrinsic parameters (the masses and spins) measured in the inspiral phase to the mass M f and the dimensionless spin magnitude v f of the merger remnant using a fitting formula derived from NR simulations. One then plots contours of the (two-dimensional) posterior probability density in the M fv f plane at different credible intervals. An IMR test therefore checks if the 90% credible contours corresponding to the two different ways of measuring the parameters overlap with each other. Non-overlapping contours could indicate that one of the two phases is not consistent with the GR model. Large BH spins and small mass ratios are potentially more effective in such tests as they break the symmetries that could hide failure of GR in equal-mass systems with non-spinning BH companions. The IMR consistency test will strengthen its power when inspiral observations with LISA is combined with merger-ringdown observations with ground-based detectors through multiband GW observations (Carson and Yagi 2020a, b;Tso et al. 2019).The IMR test currently implemented by the LIGO/Virgo Collaboration (Abbott et al. 2019b(Abbott et al. , 2016b) ) translates the intrinsic parameters (the masses and spins) measured in the inspiral phase to the mass M f and the dimensionless spin magnitude v f of the merger remnant using a fitting formula derived from NR simulations.

        <p>One can go beyond the consistency check of GR and apply the IMR test to probe specific non-GR theories and spacetimes. Unlike the parameterized tests to be discussed in Sect. 6.2, there is no simple known mapping to convert the information of the theory-agnostic IMR consistency test to bounds on specific theories or spacetimes, and hence the application needs to be done on a case-by-case basis. This has been demonstrated for a string-inspired quadratic gravity theory (Carson and Yagi 2020d) and generic BH spacetimes beyond Kerr (Carson and Yagi 2020c). The IMR tests with multiband GW observations will be able to probe such a theory and spacetimes more accurately than the existing GW and EM observations by a few orders of magnitude.One can go beyond the consistency check of GR and apply the IMR test to probe specific non-GR theories and spacetimes.

        <p>GWs at leading-order in a post-Minkowskian expansion is quadrupolar in GR. However, non-quadrupole (higher order) modes make appreciable contribution to the GWs from BBHs with large mass ratios and misaligned spins-which was indeed the case for GW190412 (Abbott et al. 2020b) and GW190814 (Abbott et al. 2020d). The multipolar structure of the GWs is fully determined by the intrinsic parameters of a binary, e.g. masses and spin angular momenta of the companion BHs in a quasicircular orbit. One can formulate multiple ways of testing the consistency of the observed GW signal with the expected multipolar structure of GWs from BBHs in GR. This is called a "no-hair" test of BBHs (Dhanpal et al. 2019;Islam et al. 2020) as it is similar to testing the "no-hair" theorems for isolated BHs through mutual consistency of the quasi-normal mode spectrum.GWs at leading-order in a post-Minkowskian expansion is quadrupolar in GR.

        <p>The main idea of this test is to look for consistency of the source parameters determined independently from the quadrupole and higher order modes. We typically use GR waveforms when performing consistency tests, so we do not consider lowerorder multipole modes, such as scalar dipole modes discussed in Sect. 2.2.3. In spirit, this idea is similar to checking the consistency of cosmological parameters estimated from the low-and high multipoles of the CMB radiation. There are multiple ways in which the test could be implemented. For example, one could use different intrinsic parameters to describe the phase evolution of the quadrupole and higher-order modes and, as in the IMR consistency test described earlier, check to see if the parameters determined from these modes are consistent with one another. Alternatively, one could introduce additional parameters to describe the amplitude of the higher modes while keeping the amplitude of the quadrupole mode as in GR. Such tests could reveal any modification from GR of the multipolar structure of the binary that is imprinted in the GWs observed at detectors.The main idea of this test is to look for consistency of the source parameters determined independently from the quadrupole and higher order modes.

        <p>Multiband observations of stellar-mass BH binaries can play an important role in constraining modified gravity via parametrized tests. This is because "multibanding" allows us to combine the information from the early inspiral dynamics using LISA with late inspiral, merger and ringdown observations using third-generation groundbased detectors. For example, it has been shown that the bounds on dipole GW emission from multibanding can be several orders of magnitude better than bounds coming from either of the bands (Barausse et al. 2016;Perkins et al. 2021;Toubiana et al. 2020). Single-parameter tests at positive PN orders are also expected to improve tremendously, as shown in Carson andYagi (2020a, 2020b); Gnocchi et al. (2019). The impact of multibanding on multiparameter tests is equally profound: Gupta et al. (2020) shows that multibanding observations may be the only way of carrying out accurate multiparameter tests of GR, where simultaneous measurement of most of the known PN coefficients could be achieved with percentage-level precision.Multiband observations of stellar-mass BH binaries can play an important role in constraining modified gravity via parametrized tests.

Indeed, the more such mappings we possess, the more inferences about fundamental physics we will be able to make from parameterized inspiral tests. Another challenge is to determine how to handle parameterically modifications of GR that do not admit a simple PN expansion in the inspiral. Indeed, certain theories of gravity, such as those that predict the sudden activation of dipole radiation at a specific length scale, cannot be exactly modeled as described.

Modified ringdown waveforms should be built upon the existence of BH solutions different from those predicted by GR (at least in theories where no-hair theorems do not apply), and in addition they must take into account that the perturbations will have different dynamics even for theories which admit the same solutions as GR (Barausse and Sotiriou 2008;Molina et al. 2010;Tattersall et al. 2018).

        <p>Rather than attacking the problem "from the ground up", various groups have considered a data-analysis-first approach, where one parametrizes deviations in the QNM frequencies and damping times (Carullo et al. 2018;Gossan et al. 2012;Maselli et al. 2020b;Meidam et al. 2014). In this framework, beyond-GR QNMs are described in terms of generic shifts from the corresponding Kerr QNM frequencies. Of course, once we set constraints on these shifts, we still need to map the frequency shifts to the new degrees of freedom of the underlying theory of gravity that produced them.Rather than attacking the problem "from the ground up", various groups have considered a data-analysis-first approach, where one parametrizes deviations in the QNM frequencies and damping times (Carullo et al. 2018;Gossan et al. 2012;Maselli et al. 2020b;Meidam et al. 2014).

For example, it is possible to map the ppE constraints from the inspiral regime to constraints on parametric deviations from the GR BH metric (Cardenas-Avendano et al. 2020;Carson and Yagi 2020c). The modified ringdown frequencies can also be used to place constraints on deviations away from the GR BH metric (Konoplya and Zhidenko 2020;Völkel and Barausse 2020).

While in GR only the tensorial polarization modes are present, this is not the case for most of the viable alternative theories of gravity (Will 2014).

        <p>In Horndeski theories, which form the most general class of non-degenerate scalar-tensor models leading to second-order equations of motion (Horndeski 1974), three degrees of freedom may propagate under the form of GWs. The first two are the usual plus and cross tensor polarisations (or equivalently the left-and right-handed helicities). Since the observation of GW170817/GRB 170817 (Abbott et al. 2017c, e), these tensor modes are constrained to propagate at the speed of light (see Sect. 6.3.2), which dramatically reduced the parameter space of viable Horndeski models (Baker et al. 2017;Creminelli and Vernizzi 2017;Ezquiaga and Zumalacárregui 2017;Langlois et al. 2018;Lombriser and Taylor 2016;Sakstein and Jain 2017). Stringent constraints may also be obtained from birefrigence effects in lensed GWs (Ezquiaga and Zumalacárregui 2020). However, even in such reduced Horndeski theories, the third degree of freedom, namely scalar waves, may propagate at subluminal speeds. While the tensor (plus and cross) modes produce shearing tidal forces that are transverse to the direction of propagation, scalar waves generally produce triaxial tidal forces.

        <p>Finally, we comment on probing extra dimensions through polarization tests. Within GR, the structure of the geodesic deviation equation in a general spacetime was first analyzed by Szekeres (1965) who decomposed the Riemann tensor into its canonical components, namely the transverse and traceless component, the longitudinal component, and the Newtonian-type tidal component. This analysis can be extended to a metric theory of gravity in any dimension D (Podolsky and Svarc 2012). In such a case, the gravitational wave in (macroscopic) higher dimension D [ 4 is naturally identified as the transverse-traceless component with DðD À 3Þ=2 independent polarization states. Higher-dimensional gravity also brings new effects. In particular, the presence of extra spatial dimensions into which the GWs could possibly propagate could be (in principle) observable as a violation of the traceless property of the gravitational wave measured by the detector located in our 123 D ¼ 4 spacetime. Such an anomalous behavior could possibly serve as a sign of the existence of higher dimensions. Although this effect has already been described in Podolsky and Svarc (2012) and analyzed in the model of exact plane GWs (and their generalizations within the Kundt family of geometries) (Podolský and Švarc 2013), the specific representation of the violation of the transverse-traceless property in the triangular LISA configuration remains an open problem.Finally, we comment on probing extra dimensions through polarization tests.

        <p>The GW speed c T is constrained by a variety of measurements. The detection of ultra high energy cosmic rays implies a strong constraint on gravitational Cherenkov radiation from a subluminal propagation of the waves as otherwise the radiation would decay away at a rate proportional to the square of their energy Oð10 11 GeVÞ before reaching us (Caves 1980;Kimura and Yamamoto 2012;Moore and Nelson 2001). For galactic Oð10 kpcÞ or cosmological Oð1 GpcÞ origin, the relative deviation in c T is constrained to be smaller than Oð10 À15 Þ or Oð10 À19 Þ, respectively. This bound, however, only applies for subluminal propagation, redshifts of z.0:1, and modifications in the high-energy regime. Another constraint on c T at the subpercent level can be inferred from the energy loss in binary pulsar systems (Brax et al. 2016;Beltran Jimenez et al. 2016). A stringent and prominent direct constraint on deviations of c T =c ¼ 1 of .Oð10 À15 Þ was obtained from the arrival times of the GW from the LIGO/Virgo event GW170817 (Abbott et al. 2017c, e) and its EM counterparts. Photons have been assumed to be massless given the stringent experimental upper bounds on their mass, though we note that some standard-model extensions imply Lorentz-violations that naturally give rise to massive photons (Bonetti et al. 2018;Colladay andKostelecký 1997, 1998;Spallicci et al. 2021). As anticipated, the measurement left a strong impact across a wide range of cosmic acceleration models (Baker et al. 2017;Battye et al. 2018;Creminelli and Vernizzi 2017;Ezquiaga and Zumalacárregui 2017;Lombriser and Lima 2017;Lombriser and Taylor 2016;McManus et al. 2016;de Rham and Melville 2018;Sakstein and Jain 2017). Importantly, however, the constraint only applies to low redshifts of z.0:01 and the LIGO/Virgo frequency range (Battye et al. 2018;de Rham and Melville 2018). In particular, it was argued in de Rham and Melville (2018) that UV completion terms for modified gravity theories naturally recover a luminal speed of gravity in the high-energy limit tested by GW170817 while allowing deviations at lower energies relevant to modifications that could drive cosmic acceleration. Weak bounds on c T can be inferred without counterpart emissions from BH mergers (Cornish et al. 2017), from the comparison of the GW arrival times between the terrestrial detectors (Blas et al. 2016), or the CMB B-mode power spectrum (Raveri et al. 2015) for early-time modifications. Constraints on c T have also been discussed as forecasts for potential arrival time comparisons with nearby supernovae emissions (Brax et al. 2016;Lombriser and Taylor 2016;Nishizawa and Nakamura 2014;Saltas et al. 2014) (which are however very rare) and LISA eclipsing binary systems (Bettoni et al. 2017).The GW speed c T is constrained by a variety of measurements.

With the detection of GWs from massive BBHs up to z $ 8 and their EM counterparts (Tamanini et al. 2016), c T will be tested across much larger distances, tightening the current constraint. Furthermore, LISA tests the frequency range below the expected UV transition of modified gravity models (de Rham and Melville 2018). Besides providing a new test of GR at different energy scales, a measurement of the speed of GWs with LISA is thus of particular relevance to cosmic acceleration models.LISA will provide a twofold improvement over the current GW170817 bound.

        <p>When a BBH is embedded in a magnetized gaseous disk, binary-disk interactions can induce change in the evolution of the GW phase. Typically the evolution of a binary disk-system is broadly composed of two phases: i) the pre-decoupling phase where the disk is coupled to the binary, and tracks the inspiral of the binary, because the GW timescale is very long compared to the effective disk viscous timescale which controls the inflow velocity of the disk; ii) the post-decoupling phase where the GW timescale becomes shorter than the disk effective viscous timescale and the binary begins to run away from the disk which can no longer track the inspiral of the binary. a.

For example, the binary residual eccentricity when it enters the LISA band is determined at binary-disk decoupling (Roedig et al. 2011). For disk thickness, e.g., H=R $ 0:2, for a comparable mass the decoupling radius becomes a d $ 40GM =c 2 at f GW $ 0:01Hz, i.e., well within the LISA band.

        <p>Tidal interaction of the SCO with the accretion disk may induce mutual angular momentum exchange that modifies both the disk and the orbit of the SCO (Ward 1997). The nature of this interaction depends basically on the ratio of their masses qCO; disk M SCO =M disk . If q CO;disk [ 1, tidal torques exerted by the SCO are strong enough to carve a cavity in the disk. Radial inflow of the gas disk then pushes the SCO inward causing the binary to harden on a time-scale comparable to the viscous timescale t visc (Type-II migration) (Gould and Rix 2000;Ward 1997). Furthermore, if the mass of the SCO exceeds the mass of the nearby gas disc, the migration slows down as the matter cannot remove angular momentum away from the binary at a rate on which the gas flows (Ivanov et al. 1999;Syer and Clarke 1995). Analytic work has predicted that the "pile-up" of gas disc around the orbit of the SCO mitigates the slow down, and the hardening timescale is t hard % q a 2;disk t visc with a relatively shallow 123 scaling of a % 0:5 in a steady-state limit (Ivanov et al. 1999;Syer and Clarke 1995). However, numerical simulations have found no evidence for this pile-up, and instead suggest a simple scaling with a ( 1 (Duffell et al. 2014;Dürmann and Kley 2017;Kanagawa et al. 2018). On the other hand, if the q CO;disk .1, the SCO is not massive enough to carve the cavity, it will migrate inwards by exciting density waves in the disc (Goldreich and Tremaine 1980;Tanaka et al. 2002) (Type-I migration). However, this mechanism is very sensitive to the temperature and opacity of the disk (Jang-Condell and Sasselov 2005; Menou and Goodman 2004). If the radiative cooling in the dense inner regions surrounding the SCO is inefficient, torques exerted by the disc will induce outward migration, instead of the usual inward migration found in locally isothermal disks, up to regions when the disc opacity is low. As the accretion proceeds, these regions move inward, and hence the SCO's migration will continue on a timescale much longer than the viscous timescale (Paardekooper and Mellema 2006). A slower migration mechanism has been recently identified (Kocsis et al. 2012). In this case, the gas piles-up significantly outside the orbit of the SCO, but the viscosity increases to the point that in steady-state gas can reach the SCO's Hill sphere, and is able to flow across its orbit (Type-1.5).Tidal interaction of the SCO with the accretion disk may induce mutual angular momentum exchange that modifies both the disk and the orbit of the SCO (Ward 1997).

        <p>c. Ringdown: A remarkable feature of the ringdown of GR BHs is the isospectrality of the polar and axial modes (Kocsis et al. 2011;Pani et al. 2013a;Yunes et al. 2011b;Wagle et al. 2021). Any deviation between the axial and polar modes could indicate new physics, but matter distribution around the BH also breaks the isospectrality (Barausse et al. 2014), making it non-trivial to identify GR modifications this way. While a smoking-gun type test is not possible due to this degeneracy, the impact of typical matter distributions around a BH on the ringdown frequencies is very weak. Thus, the lower bounds introduced by the degeneracy is low enough for ringdown-based strong-fields tests of GR to be meaningful (Barausse et al. 2014).c.

The latter two effects can be relevant also in the case of massive fields propagating in vacuum, and provide an obstacle to tests of modified gravity with massive degrees of freedom. In addition, matter effects can change the tidal-deformability of a vacuum BBH (Cardoso and Duque 2020), which could potentially limit our ability to test for dark compact objects that are not BHs.d.

The small parameter for the perturbation is the mass ratio q. According to Hughes (2016) reliable templates will require that one keeps track of at least Oðq 2 Þ terms.

        <p>Modelling the gravitational waveform of massive binaries covering their inspiral, merger and ringdown requires a combination of perturbative techniques and NR. In particular, the inspiral is modelled by PN theory, the late inspiral and merger where nonlinear effects of gravity become relevant require full NR, and the ringing down of the final BH is described within black-hole perturbation theory. These different pieces are combined into full IMR waveforms using effective-one-body (EoB) or phenomenological models.Modelling the gravitational waveform of massive binaries covering their inspiral, merger and ringdown requires a combination of perturbative techniques and NR.

        <p>PN methods are analytic techniques based on a series expansion in weak fields and small velocities that describe the dynamics of a binary during the early inspiral phase. The accuracy of the description is controlled by the PN order, which identifies the relative order to which an expansion has been taken in small velocities and weak fields. While waveforms of non-spinning, quasi-circular binaries are currently known up to 4PN order (Blanchet 2014), those of eccentric, spinning or precessing binaries are currently only available up to 3PN and 3.5PN order, e.g., Moore andYunes (2019, 2020); Tanay et al. (2021). Efforts to go beyond the current state of the art are under way, see, e.g., Bini et al. (2019Bini et al. ( , 2020a)); Foffa et al. (2019). Although for ground-based GW observatories going to high PN order will be beneficial, a recent analysis of requirements for LISA non-eccentric stellar mass BBHs finds that 3PN order is sufficient for all sources, while for $ 90% of those sources, waveforms at PN order 2 are sufficiently accurate for an unbiased recovery of the source parameters (Mangiagli et al. 2019). However, at this time it is unclear what PN accuracy is required for SMBH binaries. This will be crucial to determine as the high SNR ratio at which LISA is going to detect these binaries implies that the statistical errors are going to be smaller than the systematic errors in the theoretical waveforms. These systematic errors could hinder our ability to perform precision tests of fundamental physics with LISA.PN methods are analytic techniques based on a series expansion in weak fields and small velocities that describe the dynamics of a binary during the early inspiral phase. The accuracy of the description is controlled by the PN order, which identifies the relative order to which an expansion has been taken in small velocities and weak fields. While waveforms of non-spinning, quasi-circular binaries are currently known up to 4PN order (Blanchet 2014), those of eccentric, spinning or precessing binaries are currently only available up to 3PN and 3.5PN order, e.g., Moore andYunes (2019, 2020); Tanay et al. (2021). Efforts to go beyond the current state of the art are under way, see, e.g., Bini et al. (2019Bini et al. ( , 2020a)); Foffa et al. (2019). Although for ground-based GW observatories going to high PN order will be beneficial, a recent analysis of requirements for LISA non-eccentric stellar mass BBHs finds that 3PN order is sufficient for all sources, while for $ 90% of those sources, waveforms at PN order 2 are sufficiently accurate for an unbiased recovery of the source parameters (Mangiagli et al. 2019). However, at this time it is unclear what PN accuracy is required for SMBH binaries. This will be crucial to determine as the high SNR ratio at which LISA is going to detect these binaries implies that the statistical errors are going to be smaller than the systematic errors in the theoretical waveforms.

        <p>NR techniques are numerical methods for solving the equations of relativistic gravitation that are particularly suited in regimes where perturbation theory and PN methods fail (see e.g., Alcubierre 2008;Baumgarte and Shapiro 2010a;Bona et al. 2009;Gourgoulhon 2012;Shibata 2015 and references therein). In the case of BBH, NR is the only reliable method for capturing the late inspiral and merger of the binary from first principles. NR methods are used both in the case of GR and in modified gravity, on which we expand further below.NR techniques are numerical methods for solving the equations of relativistic gravitation that are particularly suited in regimes where perturbation theory and PN methods fail (see e.g., Alcubierre 2008;Baumgarte and Shapiro 2010a;Bona et al. 2009;Gourgoulhon 2012;Shibata 2015 and references therein).

        <p>Despite the tremendous strides made by NR since the breakthrough simulations of Baker et al. (2006); Campanelli et al. (2006); Pretorius (2005), NR still faces several challenges: current methods become prohibitively expensive for high mass ratios (qJ10) and near extremal BH spins. As a result, calibration of phenomenological waveforms such as Phenom or EOB (see next section) based on NR methods have systematic errors in the more extreme parts of the parameter space. Such systematic errors can pose challenges when performing precision tests of fundamental physics with LISA. Furthmore, it is known that in some cases numerically generated waveforms exhibit non-convergence at very high grid resolution (Zlochower et al. 2012), which makes it challenging to assess the accuracy of the waveforms. Resolving these non-convergence problems may require new gauge conditions (see e.g., Etienne et al. 2014) or next generation codes. Finally, comparisons in the context of the NRAR Collaboration (Hinder et al. 2014) showed that even when adopting the same methods at the analytic level, different NR codes (i.e. different implementations) do not entirely agree at the finite resolutions typically adopted to generate high-quality NR waveforms. Efforts like the NRAR Collaboration and code comparisons are important to assess the accuracy requirements for LISA. Initial work toward assessing these requirements (Ferguson et al. 2021) (see also Pürrer and Haster 2020) suggests that NR will require a substantial increase in accuracy compared to today's most accurate waveforms; for example it is found that reaching with NR templates SNRs above 1000, finite-difference NR codes would have to efficiently scale to resolutions of at least Dx\M=700 (M being the binary gravitational mass). Reaching resolutions for template indistinguishability is particularly important because residuals resulting from using lower resolution templates can be comparable to those resulting from ignoring higher modes entirely.Despite the tremendous strides made by NR since the breakthrough simulations of Baker et al.

        <p>There is ongoing rapid progress on improving the accuracy and physical realism of the waveform models within GR, as systematic differences are already starting to become noticeable for LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA detections such as Abbott et al. (2020b). For instance, the baseline Phenom model has recently been significantly upgraded for the dominant mode of aligned spin configurations (Pratten et al. 2020). Current models include several physical effects for circular orbits: a set of higher harmonic modes for aligned spins (Cotesta et al. 2018;García-Quirós et al. 2020;London et al. 2018;Nagar et al. 2020b), spin precession (Hannam et al. 2014;Khan et al. 2019;Ramos-Buades et al. 2020b;Schmidt et al. 2015), and spin precession with higher harmonics (Pratten et al. 2021;Khan et al. 2020;Ossokine et al. 2020). Models for nonprecessing binaries with mildly eccentric orbits have also recently been developed (Cao and Han 2017;Chiaramello and Nagar 2020;Liu et al. 2020) and explored (Hinder et al. 2018;Hinderer and Babak 2017;Ramos-Buades et al. 2020a).There is ongoing rapid progress on improving the accuracy and physical realism of the waveform models within GR, as systematic differences are already starting to become noticeable for LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA detections such as Abbott et al.

        <p>The Phenom and EOB models have been widely tested against NR simulations mainly in the regime of comparable masses, i.e. mass ratios below four, and moderately high spins below eighty percent of the maximum, aside from a few more extreme cases. Ongoing efforts to improve the structure of the models aim to include more information from a mix of perturbative approaches involving PN calculations combined with results from scattering calculations within the post-Minkowski approximation and gravitational self-force results (Antonelli et al. 2019(Antonelli et al. , 2020;;Bini et al. 2019Bini et al. , 2020b;;Khalil et al. 2020). Significant further work is required to turn these theoretical explorations into full, calibrated models, and deploy them for data analysis. While all of these developments mark important advances, waveforms for LISA will require models to account for yet more physics content and have higher accuracy than current waveform models. MBH binary mergers and intermediate mass ratio systems will generically involve eccentricity, arbitrary spins, substantially different masses, and SNR of up to several thousands. The resulting waveforms will have a very rich structure characterized by Fourier harmonics with several different frequencies.

        <p>For objects beyond BHs, Phenom and EOB models for the inspiral signals are also available. In this regime, a number of generic spin and tidal effects lead to characteristic GW signatures that depend on the objects' internal structure. Current models include the matter effects from spin-induced quadrupole moments and tidal deformability (Akcay et al. 2019;Bernuzzi et al. 2012aBernuzzi et al. , 2015b;;Bini and Damour 2014;Bini et al. 2012;Damour and Nagar 2010;Damour et al. 2012;Dietrich et al. 2017Dietrich et al. , 2019a, b;, b;Flanagan and Hinderer 2008;Kawaguchi et al. 2018;Nagar and Rettegno 2019;Nagar et al. 2019Nagar et al. , 2018;;Vines et al. 2011), and the tidal excitation of fundamental quasi-normal modes (Hinderer et al. 2016;Schmidt and Hinderer 2019;Steinhoff et al. 2016). For the time-domain EOB models, the matter effects are based solely on theoretical results without any additional calibrations to NR. The frequency-domain models can either employ PN results for matter effects on top of the BH baseline, or, as has become standard for current data analysis, a calibrated tidal model based on NR simulations for binary NSs. In all of these models, matter signatures are described in a parametric form, where the characteristic coefficients such as tidal and rotational Love numbers, and quasi-normal mode frequencies encode the fundamental information on the matter. As these matter waveforms describe only the inspiral, they are tapered to zero in practical applications at the predicted merger frequency of double NS systems as determined from fits to NR simulations (Bernuzzi et al. 2015a), or when the fundamental mode resonance is reached. Future work remains on going beyond these restrictions and on enlarging the physics content of the models with matter phenomena. Another effect that has not yet been included are the objects' absorption coefficients. All of this remaining work presents no fundamental obstacles but will require time and effort to develop the full models. Environmental effects such as from dynamical friction or energy-level transitions in clouds of ultralight fields are not yet included in the Phenom and EOB models. This is in part due to the fact that at present, studies of these phenomena are mainly exploratory. Developing a deeper understanding and more accurate descriptions of the backreaction and evolution of the system during an inspiral will be useful before including these phenomena in the full waveform models.For objects beyond BHs, Phenom and EOB models for the inspiral signals are also available.

        <p>As discussed in other parts of this white paper, there are many ways to test GR, but let us here focus on three broad classes: parameterized deviations of the waveforms from GR during all epochs, IMR consistency tests, and spectroscopy of the final remnant. For the Phenom models, where the signals are described by closedform algebraic expressions, it is straightforward to add extra beyond-GR parameters (Abbott et al. 2019a). For the EOB model, a similar approach is used with a slightly different form of parameterized deformations. These are added to reduced-order models of frequency-domain EOB waveforms (Sennett et al. 2020). Current data analysis for these theory-agnostic tests constrain only one deviation parameter at a time, as it is unfeasible to obtain useful information on a very large number of extra parameters in the waveforms. Tests of the consistency of the inspiral and the ringdown with the EOB and Phenom models (Abbott et al. 2019b;Ghosh et al. 123 2016b) rely on measuring the remnant properties (Hughes and Menou 2005) and comparing with the final mass and spin predicted from the progenitor parameters by fits to NR data (Bohé et al. 2017;Haegel and Husa 2020;Jiménez-Forteza et al. 2017). For spectroscopy using the ringdown of the remnant from a BBH merger, parameterized deformations of the quasi-normal modes, full waveform models can improve the constraints (Brito et al. 2018). Recent work has also started to develop foundations for theory-specific models as examples of non-GR waveforms. For instance, the EOB dynamics for nonspinning binaries have been calculated in scalartensor theories of gravity (Julié 2018;Julié and Deruelle 2017), Einstein-Maxwelldilaton theories (Khalil et al. 2018) and Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity (Julié and Berti 2019). Significant further work and inputs from NR will be required to develop complete waveforms, and to incorporate the expected physical effects such as spins, mass ratio, and eccentricity.As discussed in other parts of this white paper, there are many ways to test GR, but let us here focus on three broad classes: parameterized deviations of the waveforms from GR during all epochs, IMR consistency tests, and spectroscopy of the final remnant.

        <p>Let us now discuss the current systematic errors of NR BBH merger waveforms beyond GR, and how to address these errors in future simulations. In particular, we will focus on recent work in beyond-GR effective field theories of gravity, including dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) gravity, Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB), Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity (EsGB), Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell (EdM), and a flavor of a tensor-vector-scalar gravity as these are the only beyond-GR theories (aside from massive scalar-tensor gravity, which is identical to GR under ordinary initial and boundary conditions; Berti et al. 2015) for which we have non-linear BBH evolutions (Bozzola and Paschalidis 2021;East and Ripley 2021;Hirschmann et al. 2018;Okounkova 2020;Okounkova et al. 2019bOkounkova et al. , 2020;;Witek et al. 2019).Let us now discuss the current systematic errors of NR BBH merger waveforms beyond GR, and how to address these errors in future simulations.

        <p>For NR BBH simulations in GR, the greatest source of systematic error is finite numerical resolution (cf. Baumgarte and Shapiro 2010b). To quantify numerical resolution errors, simulations are performed for a series of increasing numerical resolutions, checking for convergence of the resulting gravitational waveforms. The error for a given waveform is reported as the mismatch between the waveform and the waveform from the next-lowest resolution simulation (see, e.g., the methods in Boyle et al. 2019 for technical details). For gravity theories which admit a well-posed initial value problem no approximation to the theory is necessary, and hence numerical accuracy is still the biggest source of systematic errors. For example, this is the case in the recent evolutions in EdM (Hirschmann et al. 2018), which admits a well-posed initial value problem, and in EsGB (East and Ripley 2021), where a wellposed modified Harmonic formulation of the theory is adopted.For NR BBH simulations in GR, the greatest source of systematic error is finite numerical resolution (cf.

        <p>BBH simulations beyond-GR, such as in dCS gravity (Okounkova et al. 2020) and Einstein dilaton Gauss-Bonnet gravity (Okounkova 2020) have numerical resolution errors comparable to those of GR (see the convergence analyses in Okounkova et al. 2019aOkounkova et al. , 2020;;Witek et al. 2019), and thus the codes to generate these waveforms must improve in the same way as GR codes in order to be ready for LISA. However, in addition to numerical resolution errors (comparable to those of GR), present beyond-GR NR simulations have additional sources of systematic errors. In order to ensure a well-posed initial value problem (which may not exist in EdGB; Papallo 2017; Papallo and Reall 2017;Ripley and Pretorius 2019b, a, and dCS;Delsate et al. 2015), BBH mergers in quadratic gravity are performed in an order-reduction scheme, where the spacetime metric is expanded about a GR BBH merger spacetime, and one computes the leading-order beyond-GR correction to the metric and gravitational waveform perturbatively. One then obtains the 'full' gravitational waveform by combining the background GR metric with the leading-order correction, for a suitable choice of EdGB or dCS coupling constant. The orderreduction scheme operates under the assumption that corrections to GR are small, and that higher-order corrections (such as the second-order correction to the spacetime metric) are negligible. This assumption governs an instantaneous regime of validity, where there is a maximum allowed value of the coupling constant that is allowed in order for the corrections to the spacetime metric to be smaller than the background metric (see Okounkova et al. 2019b for technical details). Thus, the NR simulations performed in this scheme are not valid for all possible physical values of coupling constant.BBH simulations beyond-GR, such as in dCS gravity (Okounkova et al. 2020) and Einstein dilaton Gauss-Bonnet gravity (Okounkova 2020) have numerical resolution errors comparable to those of GR (see the convergence analyses in Okounkova et al. 2019aOkounkova et al. , 2020;;Witek et al. 2019), and thus the codes to generate these waveforms must improve in the same way as GR codes in order to be ready for LISA.

        <p>Additionally, the order-reduction scheme introduces systematic errors through secular dephasing. Since the location of the BHs in the perturbative scheme is governed by GR (with no back-reaction from the beyond-GR fields), the phase of the BBH inspiral in the order-reduction scheme is different from that of the full theory, hence leading to secular dephasing. This is a common feature of perturbative approximations to dynamical systems (Bender and Orszag 1978), and in particular, PN approximations (Will and Maitra 2017) and self-force BH perturbation theory (Pound et al. 2005) encounter these challenges when applying perturbative approaches to long-duration inspirals. Hence, the present beyond-GR waveforms focus primarily on the merger (the phase that is crucial to numerically simulate for tests of GR; Yunes et al. 2016) and ringdown phases, ensuring that the beyond-GR simulation starts late enough so that the secular systematic errors are negligible (Okounkova 2020;Okounkova et al. 2020). Finally, the extraction of GWs themselves is another potential source of systematic errors. For example, it is unclear whether the Newman-Penrose scalars that are commonly adopted in GR, have the same physical interpretation in modified gravity.Additionally, the order-reduction scheme introduces systematic errors through secular dephasing.

        <p>Another modified theory where some work has been done is Moffat's tensorvector-scalar theory (Moffat 2015). The theory admits a well-posed initial value problem, but for sufficiently small scales, it becomes mathematically equivalent to Einstein-Maxwell theory in vacuum, where BHs carry a "gravitational" (not electric) charge, that is determined by the theory's coupling constant. First simulations in this context have been performed by Bozzola and Paschalidis (2021). However, a systematic error in this case is whether the approximation of the theory as Einstein-Maxwell in vacuum holds true. Given that the theory admits a well-posed initial value problem, it is straightforward to move beyond this approximation.Another modified theory where some work has been done is Moffat's tensorvector-scalar theory (Moffat 2015).

        <p>Moving forward one would like to obtain NR beyond-GR mergers that are free of these systematic effects by being valid for all values of coupling constants and avoiding secular dephasing. In order to mitigate dephasing growth, one can 'stitch' 123 together results for simulations with different starting points of beyond-GR effects (hence different points of zero dephasing), as discussed for the case of EMRIs in Pound and Poisson (2008); Warburton et al. (2012). Similarly, one can apply the multiscale and dynamical renormalization group methods of Galley and Rothstein (2017); Hinderer and Flanagan (2008); Kunihiro (1995); Pound (2015b) to get rid of secular dephasing effects.

        <p>Incomplete inspiral waveforms in theories beyond GR may give rise to systematic errors in tests of GR with GWs. The inspiral waveform is computed via the PN method. In most non-GR theories, only the leading PN correction has been computed, which can be mapped to the PPE framework (see Sect. 6.2.1). However, there are certain theories in which corrections to the waveform have been computed also to higher PN orders (Sennett et al. 2016;Shiralilou et al. 2021Shiralilou et al. , 2022;;Yunes et al. 2012;Zhang et al. 2020). One such example is the Brans-Dicke theory, which is one of the simplest forms of scalar-tensor theories. The effect of higher PN corrections in this theory to constrain the theoretical coupling constant (Brans-Dicke parameter) has been studied in Yunes et al. (2016). The authors showed that the bound on the Brans-Dicke parameter with GW150914 only changes by $ 10% when one includes higher PN corrections or not. This shows that the higher-order corrections are not important when constraining Brans-Dicke theory, though there may be other non-GR theories where sub-leading PN corrections become important, and thus deriving such corrections is an important direction for future research (see Sect. 6.4).Incomplete inspiral waveforms in theories beyond GR may give rise to systematic errors in tests of GR with GWs.

        <p>Let us now discuss the burning questions related to model-independent tests of GR. As discussed in Sect. 6, perhaps the most important action item here is the development of model-independent modifications to waveform models in all three phases of coalescence. The merger phase, in particular, is not well-understood in enough modified theories to allow for a model-independent parameterization. Another important action item is related to the extension of LIGO/Virgo tests (Abbott et al. 2020a) to the LISA realm, such as the residual test and polarization tests. These tests will be different with LISA because LISA will be sensitive to a large number of sources that will be on during the entire observation, and because of the motion of LISA around the Sun.Let us now discuss the burning questions related to model-independent tests of GR.

        <p>Perhaps one of the most important points to consider is to what extent tests of GR will be affected by waveform systematics or other systematics that could be induced by astrophysical environments. Waveform systematics will be particularly problematic for SMBH signals, because of their expected high SNRs. But this could be a problem even for intermediate mass-ratio systems, for which we may not have sufficiently accurate generic waveforms yet. Waveform systematics may also be a problem for EMRIs, although one expects second-order waveform calculations to be complete before LISA flies. However, astrophysical systematics may still be a particular problem for EMRIs, creating a floor to our ability to test GR. Given all of this, it is hopefully clear that a great amount of work is still needed to extract the most fundamental physics from LISA data and to ensure such inferences are robust. A close collaboration between the LISA fundamental physics WG, and other WGs, such as the waveform modelling and the cosmology, is called for and will be paramount to successfully overcome all these difficulties. We remain nonetheless optimistic that through the infrastructure of the LISA Consortium these collaborations can be organized and structured, so that we can get the most science out of the data, when LISA flies.
