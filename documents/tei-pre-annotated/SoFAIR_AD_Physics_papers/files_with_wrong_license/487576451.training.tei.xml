        <p>We review the recent developments and the current status in the field of quantum-gas cavity QED. Since the first experimental demonstration of atomic self-ordering in a system composed of a Bose-Einstein condensate coupled to a quantized electromagnetic mode of a high-Q optical cavity, the field has rapidly evolved over the past decade. The composite quantum-gas-cavity systems offer the opportunity to implement, simulate, and experimentally test fundamental solid-state Hamiltonians, as well as to realize non-equilibrium many-body phenomena beyond conventional condensed-matter scenarios. This hinges on the unique possibility to design and control in open quantum environments photon-induced tunable-range interaction potentials for the atoms using tailored pump lasers and dynamic cavity fields. Notable examples range from Hubbard-like models with long-range interactions exhibiting a lattice-supersolid phase, over emergent magnetic orderings and quasicrystalline symmetries, to the appearance of dynamic gauge potentials and nonequilibrium topological phases. Experiments have managed to load spin-polarized as well as spinful quantum gases into various cavity geometries and engineer versatile tunablerange atomic interactions. This led to the experimental observation of spontaneous discrete and continuous symmetry breaking with the appearance of soft-modes as well as supersolidity, density and spin self-ordering, dynamic spin-orbit coupling, and non-equilibrium dynamical self-ordered phases among others. In addition, quantum-gas-cavity setups offer new platforms for quantum-enhanced measurements. In this review, starting from an introduction to basic models, we pedagogically summarize a broad range of theoretical developments and put them in perspective with the current and near future state-of-art experiments.We review the recent developments and the current status in the field of quantum-gas cavity QED.

        <p>1. Introduction1. Introduction</p>
        <p>Already since the historical conception that matter is built up of indivisible elementary particles, a-tomos, in ancient Greek philosophy, a deeper understanding of the detailed structure, the formation, and the physical properties of solid matter has been at the heart of physics and, in particular, material research. Much later with the advent of the periodic table of elements it became finally clear that matter in all of its uncountable forms and wide ranging properties is composed of only about a hundred atomic elements, which are held together by electromagnetic forces and governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. While the corresponding Schrödinger equation can, at least in principle, readily be written down even in quite general circumstances, its full solution can be found solely in very few, exceptionally simple cases.Already since the historical conception that matter is built up of indivisible elementary particles, a-tomos, in ancient Greek philosophy, a deeper understanding of the detailed structure, the formation, and the physical properties of solid matter has been at the heart of physics and, in particular, material research.

        <p>Tremendous progress in experimental techniques has made it possible to nowadays analyze the detailed composition, the structure, and essential properties of a wide class of solids down to the atomic level. Simplified but still very powerful theoretical models and methods as well as a plethora of numerical techniques have been developed in parallel to understand and explain the mechanical, optical, electrical, and thermal properties of materials. Many fundamental properties like crystal and electronic band structures, conductivity, or optical properties nowadays can be numerically predicted and simulated to be at least qualitatively understood. In this context a finite set of generic Hamiltonians, such as lattice spin models in various dimensions [1] or generalized Hubbard models [2], have proven to be a viable basis for successful theoretical modeling of many observed phenomena. Despite these enormous efforts, several important phenomena, such as high-T c superconductivity, quantum magnetism, or quantum phase transitions, still remain elusive due to the complexity of corresponding materials and the hopelessly large Hilbert space needed to study realistic-size quantum many-body problems in full detail.Tremendous progress in experimental techniques has made it possible to nowadays analyze the detailed composition, the structure, and essential properties of a wide class of solids down to the atomic level.

        <p>As already pointed out by Feynman decades ago [3], a possible alternative route to investigate the physics of more complex and realistic Hamiltonians is to implement them experimentally by help of other quantum systems. These systems should be chosen such that they can be much better controlled, observed in real time in a sufficiently precise way, and well understood [4]. While this suggestion of the quantum simulation had been considered as a sort of a Gedankenexperiment for decades, breathtaking recent advances of laser technology and the laser manipulation of atomic gases have made it feasible to implement a wide class of analog quantum simulations in atomicmolecular-optical (AMO) laboratories [5]. Generic model Hamiltonians developed to describe key properties of solids can now be tested in extremely well-controlled, tunable environments magnified by two to three orders of magnitude compared to original solid materials. Ultracold quantum gases in tailored optical potentials have so become a proven workhorse to explore complex multiparticle quantum dynamics in synthetic solid-state analogs [6,7].As already pointed out by Feynman decades ago [3], a possible alternative route to investigate the physics of more complex and realistic Hamiltonians is to implement them experimentally by help of other quantum systems.

        <p>A prominent and fundamentally important class of solids exhibits a regular periodic crystalline structure with a corresponding periodic potential for high energy electrons. The resulting single-particle Bloch energy bands decisively determine electric, magnetic, optical, and thermal properties of such crystalline solids. A finite set of laser beams can be utilized to create readily analogous, defect-free, spatially periodic light intensity distributions mimicking a large class of crystalline potentials at more than a hundred-fold increased scale without any undesired perturbation. Atoms cooled down to almost absolute zero kinetic temperature can then be used to play the role of electrons in crystals and simulate their orbital quantum motion and interactions in these optical lattice structures at a directly observable scale [5].A prominent and fundamentally important class of solids exhibits a regular periodic crystalline structure with a corresponding periodic potential for high energy electrons.

        <p>By proper choice of laser-light frequencies and atomic species, virtually back-actionfree optical potentials spanning over macroscopic distances can be implemented and tuned in space and in real time. Employing more atomic internal states allows also to incorporate spin degrees of freedom and simulate quantum magnetism. Furthermore, geometric phases can be imprinted on charge-neutral atoms via tailored atom-field coupling, in order to mimic minimal coupling and gauge potentials [8,9]. These vast possibilities have led to a huge number of experimental implementations [6,7], a development which in turn triggered widespread interest in physics communities beyond the AMO. This includes, in particular, the solid-state community seeing a unique opportunity to adapt and implement their paradigmatic model Hamiltonians, and test their predictions in a controlled way using quantum-gas setups, which nowadays can analyze quantum phases with single-site resolution [10][11][12][13].By proper choice of laser-light frequencies and atomic species, virtually back-actionfree optical potentials spanning over macroscopic distances can be implemented and tuned in space and in real time.

        <p>Already in the early stage of the field using then available tools for ultracold atoms, a seminal quantum-gas experiment exhibited a reversible quantum phase transition between a superfluid and a Mott-insulator phase exactly as predicted by the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian [14]. A huge number of further successful demonstrations of intriguing condensed-matter phenomena such as superfluidity, quantum magnetism, Abelian and non-Abelian gauge potentials, just to name a few, has followed since [15].Already in the early stage of the field using then available tools for ultracold atoms, a seminal quantum-gas experiment exhibited a reversible quantum phase transition between a superfluid and a Mott-insulator phase exactly as predicted by the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian [14].

        <p>Beyond these early, yet very impressive, successful demonstrations, however, several fundamental open challenges for quantum simulation of solid-state materials with quantum gases have remained. Generally, the underlying lattice structure is externally prescribed and is independent of particle number and their state. This hinders studies of self-ordering and crystal formation. Likewise, it is challenging to represent the effect of phonons (i.e., lattice vibrations). More generally, implementation of long-or infiniterange atom-atom interactions proves to be rather demanding. This includes notably pairing interactions in momentum space as in various condensed-matter models for superconductivity. Furthermore, fundamental questions concerning crystal growth and melting, or lattice-defect formation are not so straightforward to implement. The externally prescribed order generally inhibits structural phase transitions or the appearance of new long-range order through dynamical symmetry breaking. As a practical limitation on the other hand, the observation of any kind of time evolution is generally very slow as measurements are typically destructive in quantum-gas experiments which impedes repeated observations within a single measurement sample.Beyond these early, yet very impressive, successful demonstrations, however, several fundamental open challenges for quantum simulation of solid-state materials with quantum gases have remained.

        <p>The challenge to implement these effects in quantum-gas setups mostly stems from the fact that optical potentials are typically required to operate in regimes where electromagnetic fields generating the optical potentials are far detuned from any optical atomic transition, so that most photons propagate almost freely through the atomic gas. Consequently, the back-action of the trapped particles on lattice fields, which is at the heart of phonon-induced interaction potentials, is extremely small and negligible in many cases, and sizeable effects only appear in very large setups or closer to resonance when dissipation starts to be an issue [16]. To mimic phonon-like long-range coupling in free-space configurations, a diverse set of alternative approaches has been exploited. Among others these encompass the creation of hetero-nuclear molecules, the use of atomic species with strong magnetic dipole moments or the admixture of Rydberg states giving rise to induced electric dipole moments [17,18] . In all these cases the original lattice remains static, stable, and perfect. As we will see below by help of multimode cavity fields and atomic self-ordering this limitation can be largely overcome. Basic scheme of cavity QED with a quantum gas to realize a self-ordering phase transition. A quantum gas (blue sphere) is loaded inside a standing-wave cavity and driven by a transverse, coherent pumplaser field. The schematic drawing on the left side illustrates the fundamental photon scattering processes inducing long-range interactions between the atoms, where the grid indicates the standing-wave mode structures of the cavity and the pump fields: A photon (red wiggly lines) from the pump beam is scattered off a first atom into the cavity mode and then back into the pump off a second atom. Both atoms acquire a momentum kick (blue arrows) due to the photon recoil. These atoms effectively interact with each other via the exchange of the cavity photon.The challenge to implement these effects in quantum-gas setups mostly stems from the fact that optical potentials are typically required to operate in regimes where electromagnetic fields generating the optical potentials are far detuned from any optical atomic transition, so that most photons propagate almost freely through the atomic gas.

        <p>In this review we concentrate on an alternative approach to implement versatile, tailored interatomic interactions and explore novel many-body phenomena using the framework of quantum gases by the help of optical cavities (also referred to as resonators) composed of high-quality mirrors to enhance atom-photon interaction; see Figure 1. Any conservative optical force on atoms microscopically originates from the coherent photon redistribution among various electromagnetic fields acting on the atoms. In principle, any photon scattered by one atom subsequently interacts with the other atoms of the ensemble and can be re-scattered, resulting in non-local photoninduced interactions among the atoms. Hence, non-local interatomic interactions are already naturally built into optical potentials.In this review we concentrate on an alternative approach to implement versatile, tailored interatomic interactions and explore novel many-body phenomena using the framework of quantum gases by the help of optical cavities (also referred to as resonators) composed of high-quality mirrors to enhance atom-photon interaction; see Figure 1.

        <p>Sequential photon scattering processes and strong atom-photon coupling in principle always lead to atomic back-action on the field, non-local interatomic interactions, and nonlinear effects [16,19]. However, these sequential photon scattering processes are extremely unlikely and usually negligible for typical free-space configurations operated in far-detuned regimes to reduce dissipation and heating. Luckily the minute back-action of the atoms on the trapping electromagnetic fields can be dramatically enhanced by the help of optical resonators. This hinges on the fact that confining the scattered fields within a high-Q cavity allows each photon to multiply pass through the same atomic ensemble. Hence resonators significantly enhance the tiny probability of a scattered photon to be re-scattered by the same or any other atom in the ensemble resulting in photon-induced interatomic interactions [20][21][22]-reminiscent of phonon-induced interactions in natural crystals [23].Sequential photon scattering processes and strong atom-photon coupling in principle always lead to atomic back-action on the field, non-local interatomic interactions, and nonlinear effects [16,19].

        <p>Mode functions of a cavity form a basis in its volume. While a single cavity mode covering the whole quantum gas mediates infinite-range interactions among the atoms, by employing a large number of degenerate cavity modes as in confocal or concentric cavities the range of interatomic interactions can be vastly tuned [24][25][26][27]. Also by help of a manifold of pump frequencies (as in frequency combs) and modes, range and shape of interatomic interactions can be controlled [28,29]. Therefore, tailored sequential photon scattering in optical resonators enables to create a large class of sizable tunable-range interatomic interactions.Mode functions of a cavity form a basis in its volume.

        <p>Let us note here that for spatially coherent light fields, as they are generally employed to create optical potentials, all possible scattering amplitudes for a photon by different atoms interfere. Depending on relative phases, they may collectively add up or cancel destructively all together. The collective enhancement is in close analogy with the well-known Bragg enhancement of coherent wave scattering by periodic structures, which here is further amplified in the presence of an optical resonator.Let us note here that for spatially coherent light fields, as they are generally employed to create optical potentials, all possible scattering amplitudes for a photon by different atoms interfere.

        <p>Some intriguing aspects of the collective motional coupling of a quantum gas to a cavity mode have been pointed out already two decades ago [30]. It then took several years until the first generation of pioneering experiments with cold atomic gases as well as Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in driven optical cavities appeared [31][32][33][34][35]. As it was shown in several theoretical approaches and first experiments, the collectively enhanced atom-field interaction allowed to implement strong coupling of the centerof-mass mode of the atomic ensemble to a single cavity mode. This corresponds to the implementation of a zero-temperature optomechanical Hamiltonian in the so-called strong coupling limit, where single cavity photons create sizable forces and highly nonlinear dynamics [32,[35][36][37][38].Some intriguing aspects of the collective motional coupling of a quantum gas to a cavity mode have been pointed out already two decades ago [30].

        <p>The potential of cavity-enhanced forces and interatomic interactions was, however, fully highlighted experimentally a bit later in a seminal demonstration of superradiant self-ordering of a transversely-driven homogeneous BEC to an ordered crystalline phase at zero temperature [39][40][41]. In detail, quantum fluctuations in the homogeneous atomic density stimulate collective scattering of photons from a transversely applied, standing-wave laser into the cavity mode. In turn, photons scattered into the cavity act back non-linearly on the atoms and amplify the BEC density fluctuations [20,30,40,42]. Above a critical pump power, the system undergoes a reversible zero-temperature quantum-phase transition into a perfectly ordered, crystalline state. Here, in theory quantum fluctuations of the radiation field play a decisive role [43] and atom-field entanglement appears to be vital in this zero temperature transition [44].The potential of cavity-enhanced forces and interatomic interactions was, however, fully highlighted experimentally a bit later in a seminal demonstration of superradiant self-ordering of a transversely-driven homogeneous BEC to an ordered crystalline phase at zero temperature [39][40][41].

        <p>Mathematically, the underlying dynamics near the self-ordering transition can be well described by the Dicke Hamiltonian. Hepp and Lieb predicted more than half a century ago that the Dicke Hamiltonian exhibits a zero-temperature phase transition involving a Z 2 parity-symmetry breaking to a so-called superradiant state in the limit of very strong coupling [45][46][47]. Truncating the self-ordering Hamiltonian close to threshold to low atomic momenta yields exactly the Dicke Hamiltonian with tunable parameters, allowing thus to emulate the corresponding phase transition [41]. As the original Hepp and Lieb prediction based on a very simplified toy model created a long-standing and controversial debate on its validity, this first and very clear experimental demonstration of the existence of a superradiant phase transition at exactly the predicted parameter values created huge attention even far beyond the cold-atom community. From a different viewpoint, the experiment can be seen as one of the successful implementations of a quantum simulation of a multi-particle Hamiltonian.Mathematically, the underlying dynamics near the self-ordering transition can be well described by the Dicke Hamiltonian.

        <p>Further calculations and a closer look on the detailed underlying dynamics including local atomic interactions revealed even more remarkable properties of the realized selfordered state. In particular, the self-ordered state has been shown to simultaneously possess spatial order associated with the spontaneously broken discrete Z 2 symmetry as well as phase coherence (i.e., off-diagonal long-range order) of the atomic state. As the combination of these two properties is usually attributed to lattice supersolids, the self-ordered state constitutes a prominent candidate for such an intriguing state of matter.Further calculations and a closer look on the detailed underlying dynamics including local atomic interactions revealed even more remarkable properties of the realized selfordered state.

        <p>After initial theoretical works and these experimental realizations, a plethora of proposals for generalizations and novel directions to pursue was put forward. A very prominent example was the introduction of cavity-mediated long-range interatomic interactions in Hubbard models for bosons [50] as well as for fermions [51]. The phase diagram of the Bose-Hubbard model with cavity-induced global atom-atom interactions was predicted using various approximate theoretical approaches [52][53][54][55][56] and subsequently successfully measured experimentally [49,57], as shown in Figure 2. Here, strong evidence of an intermediate lattice-supersolid phase between the homogeneous superfluid and the density-ordered superradiant phase was found in agreement with theoretical models. Subsequent employing of two crossed linear cavities enabled the observation of a supersolid state breaking a continuous symmetry [58]. Nontrivial topological insulator states have also been theoretically predicted to appear in fermionic quantum-gas cavity QED [59,60]. With the first experimental demonstrations of interacting ultracold fermions coupled to cavities, experimental confirmation could be envisaged soon [61,62].After initial theoretical works and these experimental realizations, a plethora of proposals for generalizations and novel directions to pursue was put forward.

        <p>Cavity-induced interatomic interactions can be tuned from attractive to repulsive simply by changing the laser frequencies with respect to cavity resonances [63,64]. Already in simple 1D configurations repulsive potentials allow to implement intriguing scenarios such as a nonequilibrium Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with periodically modulated tunneling amplitude, where symmetry-protected edge states and other topologically nontrivial effects are expected to appear [59]. Particularly, in 2D configurations interesting phenomena have been predicted due to the repulsive cavity-induced interactions, including controllable dynamical instabilities in conjunction with limit cycles-also referred to as time crystals in this context-as well as strong indications of chaotic dynamics [63,[65][66][67].Cavity-induced interatomic interactions can be tuned from attractive to repulsive simply by changing the laser frequencies with respect to cavity resonances [63,64].

        <p>As atomic species generally possess isotopes with variable nuclear spin, they come with a large variation of hyperfine level structures. These hyperfine internal states can be exploited to simulate spin degrees of freedom. Again, the direct spin-spin interaction between atoms is quite weak at optical wavelength distances. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that using specifically designed cavity-enhanced optical Raman transitions between hyperfine states of a multi-component quantum gas allows to implement much stronger interatomic spin interactions and simulate a wide class of long-range quantum spin Hamiltonians, including Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, across the self-ordering phase transition [68,69]; see Figure 3. The first fundamental steps towards this goal had already been implemented in experiments [70,71], opening a new route towards quantum magnetism in atomic quantum gases. The use of cavity-enhanced Raman transitions between hyperfine states also enabled the first realization of a dynamical synthetic spin-orbit coupling [72], paving the way for the implementation of dynamical artificial gauge potentials. Interestingly, cavity-induced interactions can also be tuned to couple various species of atoms or even molecules in a single or even distinct traps [73]. A recent proposal even suggested to study phenomenon of many-body localization [74] as well as special aspects of ergodicity in quantum-gas-cavity-QED systems despite the presence of virtually infinite-range interactions [75].As atomic species generally possess isotopes with variable nuclear spin, they come with a large variation of hyperfine level structures.

Nevertheless, it has been suggested that using specifically designed cavity-enhanced optical Raman transitions between hyperfine states of a multi-component quantum gas allows to implement much stronger interatomic spin interactions and simulate a wide class of long-range quantum spin Hamiltonians, including Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, across the self-ordering phase transition [68,69]; see Figure 3. The first fundamental steps towards this goal had already been implemented in experiments [70,71], opening a new route towards quantum magnetism in atomic quantum gases. The use of cavity-enhanced Raman transitions between hyperfine states also enabled the first realization of a dynamical synthetic spin-orbit coupling [72], paving the way for the implementation of dynamical artificial gauge potentials. Interestingly, cavity-induced interactions can also be tuned to couple various species of atoms or even molecules in a single or even distinct traps [73].

        <p>The inevitable presence of dissipation via the leaking cavity field has two important consequences. First, it renders the system to be a driven-dissipative one. This not only leads to quantitative modifications of the physics such as shifted critical points or modified scaling of the critical fluctuations [42,[76][77][78][79], but also allows to explore dissipative phase transitions to states that would otherwise not be present. This includes, for example, dissipation-stabilized phases and gauge potentials, and non-stationary states [80][81][82][83].The inevitable presence of dissipation via the leaking cavity field has two important consequences.

        <p>Second, as a generic, advantageous consequence of the openness of optical resonators, real-time information on dynamics of cavity-QED systems can be obtained simply by non-destructive observation and analysis of cavity output fields [77,84,85], thus complementing or replacing destructive absorption-imaging measurements of atomic density distributions. Besides a precise and non-destructive, real-time access to atomic quantum currents as recently studied [86,87], this in principle paves the way towards atom-based novel and improved implementations of quantum-enhanced sensing [88][89][90][91][92]. Moreover, in some cases one can even expect the appearance of genuine consequences of quantum measurement back-action on the system, which can be controlled on a new level of precision [93,94]. Here again genuine quantum phe-nomena such as spontaneous antiferromagnetic ordering can be induced via controlled measurement projections [95].Second, as a generic, advantageous consequence of the openness of optical resonators, real-time information on dynamics of cavity-QED systems can be obtained simply by non-destructive observation and analysis of cavity output fields [77,84,85], thus complementing or replacing destructive absorption-imaging measurements of atomic density distributions.

        <p>The experimental merger of quantum gases with cavity QED opened a wide field of possibilities ranging from cavity optomechanics at zero temperature to the real-time exploration of quantum phase transitions [96]. The central physical mechanism is the quantum back-action between the dynamic cavity fields and the atomic degrees of freedom. Combining the excellent control of quantum-gas experiments over external and internal atomic degrees of freedom with the strong coupling to quantized light fields in high-finesse optical resonators provides completely new opportunities specifically for the quantum simulation of many-body systems [4,97,98] as well as for quantumenhanced optimization [28,99], for cavity optomechanics in the bad [33,35,38,100,101] and in the good [102][103][104][105] cavity limits, and for quantum sensing [90].The experimental merger of quantum gases with cavity QED opened a wide field of possibilities ranging from cavity optomechanics at zero temperature to the real-time exploration of quantum phase transitions [96].

        <p>The field has rapidly expanded in the last decade. In order for the material to fit into a single manuscript with a reasonable length, we restrict this review to scenarios where the back-action between the quantum gas and the cavity field leads to the emergence of correlated many-body phases, some of which go beyond the scope of quantum simulation in that they offer novel paradigms in many-body physics. In particular, the systems of interest in the present review are chiefly transversely driven quantum gases inside single-and many-mode cavities. Therefore, we do not include and discuss explicitly thermal gases inside cavities [31,32,106,107], cavity optomechanical systems with quantum gases [35], and Dicke-type cavity models with atomic mediums without quantized motion [108][109][110][111][112][113]. Such scenarios have been extensively considered in the previous review articles [96,114,115] and we refer interested readers to these excellent reviews. Despite these restrictions in choosing the systems of interest, the scope of the current review is quite vast and encompasses plethora of intriguing physical phenomena.The field has rapidly expanded in the last decade.

        <p>In this chapter, we introduce the framework for studying the many-body physics of cavity QED with quantum gases. We start our description with the most fundamental system: Ultracold atoms transversely driven by a laser field and dispersively interacting with a single quantized electromagnetic radiation field of a standing-wave linear cavity. Most of the basic concepts and methods can be captured in this simple model. Moreover, this system constitutes the first experimental setup where collective phenomena were observed. In the subsequent chapters, we shall generalize this simple model to different scenarios and regimes, including additional atomic and photonic degrees of freedom-most notably spinor gases as well as multiple cavity modes. For the convenience, we summarize the most important and commonly-used symbols throughout the paper in Appendix A1. We note that some of the symbols we use in this review can be different from those used in some literature.In this chapter, we introduce the framework for studying the many-body physics of cavity QED with quantum gases.

        <p>Consider ultracold two-level atoms with internal states {|g , |e } and the transition frequency ω a inside a single-mode standing-wave linear cavity with the resonance frequency ω c . The wave length λ c and the wave number k c of the cavity mode are related to the resonance frequency via ω c = ck c = 2πc/λ c , with c being the speed of light. The atoms are driven by a standing-wave classical coherent laser field in the transverse direction with the position-dependent Rabi frequency Ω(r) = Ω 0 cos(k c y) and are strongly coupled to the quantized mode of the cavity with the strength G(r) = G 0 cos(k c x); see Figure 4. Ω 0 and G 0 are the maximum Rabi frequency of the pump field and the maximum single atom-photon cavity-QED coupling strength, respectively. Here we do not take into account the transverse profile of the cavity mode, which is a Gaussian in the simplest case; the transverse profile of cavity modes will be discussed in more detail in Section 2.8.1 and will be included in multimode cavities in Section 5. Note that the Rabi rate Ω(r) can have a different spatial form (e.g., via using a running-wave pump laser) and the pump laser can also impinge the atomic cloud with an angle different than 90°with respect to the cavity axis; these scenarios will be considered in the following chapters.Consider ultracold two-level atoms with internal states {|g , |e } and the transition frequency ω a inside a single-mode standing-wave linear cavity with the resonance frequency ω c .

In the case that the photon-like polariton initially lies at a higher frequency than the atomic counterpart, the atom-like polariton starts then to soften-i.e., its real part approaches zero. As can be seen from Figure 6, this happens essentially in the same way for both bosonic and fermionic atoms, apart from the fact that in the latter case the polariton resonant peak becomes visible only when it exits the particle-hole continuum. When the real part of the low-lying polariton frequency reaches zero at η 0 = η 0s , the polariton splits into two branches differing only by their imaginary part. The branch with the smallest imaginary part is shown in Figure 9, for both bosonic and fermionic atoms.

        <p>From Figure 9 one can see that the critical behavior across the superradiant phase transition is the same for both bosons and fermions, and is characterized by the linear vanishing of the polariton damping as a function of the effective coupling strength η 0 , as seen by linearizing Equation (50). In this simplest scenario for superradiance featuring a single cavity mode, the critical behaviour coincides with the one of a dissipative version of the Dicke model [41,115,122], discussed in Section 2.3. The static universality class is of the mean-field, classical Ising type. It is always at finite temperature due to cavity losses (the same holds in the absence of photon losses but at finite temperature of the atomic cloud). The dynamical universality class is a mean-field version of Model A in the Hohenberg-Halperin classification, since there is no conserved quantity [156]. The mean-field nature of the transition is generic to cases where the atoms are coupled to a finite (in the thermodynamic limit) number of cavity modes, resulting in a zerodimensional effective theory for the order parameter [79]. In equivalent terms, the cavity-mediated atom-atom interactions in these cases are of infinite-range nature, so that the interacting models are fully connected.From Figure 9 one can see that the critical behavior across the superradiant phase transition is the same for both bosons and fermions, and is characterized by the linear vanishing of the polariton damping as a function of the effective coupling strength η 0 , as seen by linearizing Equation (50).

        <p>Cavity losses render the superradiant phase transition effectively thermal. As discussed in Section 2.6, our considered driven-dissipative systems are in general not in a global thermal-equilibrium state. However, the degree of freedom corresponding to the Dicke-type order parameter follows a critical dynamics in presence of an effective classical, thermal bath [156]. The corresponding temperature is thus always finite in the open system and depends on the character of the soft polaritonic mode which becomes undamped at the transition. In the regime where the cavity dynamics is much faster than the atomic one, κ ω r (experiments ETH1, ETH2, Stan, and Tüb1 in Table 1), the soft polariton corresponds to an almost atomic excitation. This picture is supported by the measurement of the structure factor in the vicinity of the transition (see Figure 16), where the occupation of the soft polariton is consistent with the temperature of the atomic gas (∼kHz) before coupling to the cavity, rather than with the loss rate (∼MHz). It is important to note, however, that this scenario neglects the effect of cavity-induced relaxation (the so-called cavity heating or cooling) of the atomic cloud, whereby the on-shell scattering processes involving cavity photons redistribute the atoms.

        <p>We described here the superradiant instability in terms of a polariton mode becoming unstable. The atomic component of this polariton involves a single momentum corresponding to the cavity wave number k c . This finite-momentum instability is analogous to a roton mode softening. In the standard situation of a closed equilibrium system, the softening is associated with an excitation energy approaching zero (the so-called energetic instability). In the present driven-dissipative case, however, the order-parameter degree of freedom is in contact with a classical thermal bath, as discussed above. What matters is thus not the excitation energy but its damping, which approaches zero and crosses it at the unstable point, becoming positive. As a consequence, across the transition the mode grows exponentially in time, leading to a so-called dynamical instability. The critical regime of the self-organization phase transition has been experimentally explored; see Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.We described here the superradiant instability in terms of a polariton mode becoming unstable.

The dispersively driven two-photon transitions between two momentum states lead to the "paramagnetic-like" term proportional to â † + â in Equation (6) [and correspondingly in Equation ( 19)], thereby moving the superradiant transition from the ultrastrong coupling regime (as in the original Dicke model) to the strong coupling regime. That is, in the original Dicke model the strength of the atom-field coupling (i.e., paramagnetic term) has to be comparable to the bare cavity and atomic-transition frequencies, which lie in the optical domain of several hundred THz. In contrast, in the dispersively driven atom-cavity systems the strength of the atom-field coupling needs to be comparable to the cavity detuning/loss rate and the recoil frequency, i.e., to be in the several kHz to MHz regime. The validity of Dicke-type models and the fundamental possibility of the superradiant transition in the ultrastrong coupling regime is still a matter of active debate both in atomic and solid-state physics [157,158].The non-equilibrium-or more precisely the driven-nature of this open atom-cavity system plays an essential role in the possibility of the experimental realization of the Dicke superradiant phase transition.

The relevant momentum states can thus be clearly resolved such that the low-energy description and the corresponding mapping to the Dicke model is applicable, as discussed in Section 2.3. Therefore, the threshold for the superradiant self-ordering phase transition is set by the competition between the atomic quantum-kinetic energy, i.e., the energetic cost of spatially modulating the wave function, and potential energies. That is, the self-ordering is favored when the (negative) potential energy gain outweighs the kinetic energy penalty due to the density crystallization. This is different from the self-organization of thermal classical atoms [31], where the phase transition from the normal to the self-organized phase is determined by a competition of thermal fluctuations and potential energy.The first observation of the superradiant self-organization phase transition of a quantum gas made use of an almost pure BEC, such that k B T ω r [39].

        <p>In typical experiments considered in this section, an atomic BEC is confined by an external trap to the center of a single cavity mode, and illuminated transversally by a far red-detuned standing-wave pump field [39]; see also Figure 4. The atomic detuning ∆ a between the pump field and the atomic resonance frequency is on the order of THz, such that the atoms are not electronically excited but only act as a dispersive medium scattering photons from the pump field into the cavity mode and vice versa. At the same time, the cavity detuning ∆ c between the pump field and the cavity resonance is comparatively small, on the order of ∼10 MHz (where the cavity decay rate κ is ∼1MHz), such that photons are preferentially scattered via the atoms from the pump field into the cavity mode (and vice versa). Such two-photon scattering processes impart each a recoil kick onto the atoms along the pump and the cavity direction. The bare kinetic energy of this microscopic scattering process is thus 2 ω r . The transverse pump field induces a coupling between the atomic external degree of freedom and the cavity field, which leads to a softening of one of the polariton branches. This softening reduces the energetic cost of the photon scattering processes, and eventually leads to the superradiant instability described in Section 3.1.1. The basic experimental sequence and main observations of this prototypical experiment are summarized in Figure 10. The power P of the transverse pump field inducing the coupling (P ∝ η 2 0 ) is gradually increased. Above a critical pump power, the intra cavity light intensity raises sharply, indicating the superradiant phase transition point. At the same time, a superposition of four relevant momentum states k = (±k c , ±k c ) becomes macroscopically populated, as can be observed in absorption images after time of flight expansion of the BEC. In the normal phase, the atomic density is modulated by the transverse pump lattice but homogeneous along the cavity direction, leading to destructive interference of the light scattered off the atoms into the cavity mode. In contrast, in the superradiant phase, the spatial arrangement of the atomic system in the emergent optical lattice corresponds to the formation of a Bragg grating at which the pump field is efficiently scattered into the cavity mode and back.In typical experiments considered in this section, an atomic BEC is confined by an external trap to the center of a single cavity mode, and illuminated transversally by a far red-detuned standing-wave pump field [39]; see also Figure 4.

In addition to monitoring the steady state of the system, this also enables access to fluctuations of the system as we discuss in Section 3.2.2.

        <p>Whether the even or odd sites of the underlying checkerboard lattice are predominantly occupied in the superradiant phase is determined by a spontaneous symmetry breaking process. After the phase transition, the phase of the intra-cavity field is locked with respect to the pump field's phase. Using a heterodyne detection scheme, this relative phase can be measured. It was experimentally confirmed that the phase locks either to 0 or π relative to the pump phase; see Figure 10(f) [159]. This observation of two discrete values for the relative cavity-pump phase demonstrates the Z 2 parity symmetry breaking expected from the basic Hamiltonian (6), and corresponds to the self-organization of the atomic density with maxima at either the even or the odd sites of the emerging checkerboard lattice; see also Section 3.1.1.

        <p>The symmetry at the phase transition is broken by a symmetry-breaking field rather than by a spontaneous process-as probably in all realistic experiments. The breaking is most likely caused by the finite size of the initially homogeneous atomic cloud having a slightly different overlap with either the even or the odd sites of the emergent optical lattice. This overlap integral depends λ c -periodically on the relative position between the center of the atomic trap and the checkerboard lattice structure. The nonzero overlap difference then inhibits the complete destructive interference in the normal phase and a small coherent field scattered into the cavity acts as a symmetry breaking light field, such that the order parameter is renormalized by an additive constant. Measuring the distribution of the phase of the intra-cavity light field across the phase transition repeatedly allows to analyze the symmetry-breaking field. It is important to note that an equal distribution of the measurement outcomes does not prove the absence of symmetry-breaking fields, since it can as well be caused by technical fluctuations of a present symmetry-breaking field. In Ref. [159], a maximal symmetrybreaking field corresponding to ∼40 atoms distributed in excess on either the even or odd sites was estimated. When the phase-transition boundary was slowly crossed The intra-cavity photon number is shown as a function of the pump-cavity detuning ∆c and the pump power. A sharp phase boundary separating the normal and the Dickesuperradiant states is visible, which shifts for increasing absolute values of the detuning to increasing pump powers. The dashed curve is the mean-field prediction for the pump threshold, Equation (46), reproducing the experimental phase boundary. The insets (b) and (c) show time traces of the intra-cavity photon number when entering the self-organized phase. For detunings close to the cavity resonance, an oscillatory behavior is observed since the dynamic dispersive shift of the cavity pushes the detuning δc to zero which interrupts the positive feedback driving the self-organization.

This is different from observations of superradiance in free space [161] or in longitudinally pumped ring cavities [37], where the superradiant Rayleigh scattering is a transient phenomenon leading to a pulse of light rather than entering a stable quantum phase of matter.

The meanfield prediction for the phase boundary, Equation (46), is in good agreement with the experimental data. The horizontal phase boundary at small detunings is dispersively shifted by -U (r)n(r)dr with respect to the bare cavity resonance. This shift is a dynamic quantity, depending on the overlap between the cavity mode and the atomic density distribution, giving rise in addition to nonlinear effects in the system. For detunings close to the cavity resonance, the system can enter into an unstable regime, where the optomechanical interaction pushes the dispersively shifted cavity resonance δ c to zero and the positive feedback that drives self-organization is interrupted.

However, new features appear in the phase diagram for positive pump-cavity detunings, ∆ c &gt; 0, as predicted by Refs. [162,163]. Namely, in this region of the phase diagram short superradiant pulses were emitted into the cavity, during which the atoms were irreversibly scattered into higher momentum states.</p>

        <p>While the criticality of the superradiant phase transition in bosonic atoms is captured by the effective low-energy Dicke-type model of Equation (19), some important qualitative effects, even in the simplest geometry considered so far where the driven atoms couple dispersively to a single cavity mode, cannot be reproduced by the low-energy Dicke Hamiltonian (19). For instance, the superradiant threshold as a function of temperature, obtained from the full model of Equation ( 6) for non-interacting bosons and shown in Figure 13, behaves differently from the one of the Dicke model. The smallest pump-strength threshold appears at an optimal, finite temperature of the atomic cloud, while the Dicke Hamiltonian (19) has the lowest pump-strength threshold at zero temperature. This behavior results from the fact that the polarization function χ dyn , Equation (36), of the atomic medium at finite photon momentum initially increases if atomic momentum states in the direction perpendicular to the photon momentum become thermally occupied, simply because more states then participate in the scattering. This, however, holds only until the temperature broadening of the atomic distribution becomes an appreciable fraction of the cavity-photon momentum, which makes the numerator of the polarization function χ dyn smaller as longitudinal momenta of the order of the photon momentum become occupied.While the criticality of the superradiant phase transition in bosonic atoms is captured by the effective low-energy Dicke-type model of Equation (19), some important qualitative effects, even in the simplest geometry considered so far where the driven atoms couple dispersively to a single cavity mode, cannot be reproduced by the low-energy Dicke Hamiltonian (19).

        <p>The self-ordering of bosonic atoms can exhibit other interesting features, which are not shown in Figure 13. For instance, it has been predicted that deep enough in the superradiant phase the BEC can enter a fragmented phase [166], where multiple atomic modes are macroscopically occupied but with no coherence among one another. The effect of such beyond-mean-field correlations is even stronger if an external (i.e., not cavity-induced), strong optical lattice is imposed in the system; see Section 7.The self-ordering of bosonic atoms can exhibit other interesting features, which are not shown in Figure 13.

        <p>One important additional feature for the fermionic atoms during the self-ordering process is the possibility of nesting between the photon momentum and the Fermi surface of the atoms, allowing for photon-induced Umklapp scattering processes transferring a fermion from one side of the Fermi surface to the other side [170]. Nesting enhances the tendency towards the formation of a density modulation and thus superradiance. This is visible as a peak around unit filling (or equivalently k c = 2k F ) in the phase diagram shown in Figure 14(a). The effect of nesting is more dramatic in one dimension [140], where the pump-strength threshold for the self-ordering phase transition vanishes when the photon momentum is twice the Fermi momentum. This phenomenon is known in the condensed-matter context as the Peierls transition in electron-phonon models [171]. By forming a density wave, a gap is opened in the Fermi surface so that the atoms in the superradiant cavity lattice form an insulator. Sufficiently away from the unit filling, the atoms are in a metallic state [140,172,173]. Nesting effects require a sharp Fermi surface and are thus washed out with increasing temperature of the atoms, as illustrated in Figure 14(b). This is especially true in one dimension, where the Peierls instability immediately disappears and the superradiant threshold is moved to a finite atom-photon coupling strength.

        <p>In the experimental situation of a finite-size atomic BEC with short-range collisional interactions and a transverse pump-lattice potential, the energy of the excitations have to be rescaled [20]. Contact interactions and the optical potentials affect the bare energy of the excitation mode already without cavity-mediated global interactions. The excited single-particle mode is replaced by a Bogoliubov mode, and the coupling between the ground-state wave function and that mode is rescaled by its spatial overlap integral weighted with the mode structure of the long-range interaction potential. In the normal phase, the excited Bogoliubov mode with momentum (respectively quasimomentum along the transverse pump lattice) (±k c , ±k c ) lies in the lowest-energy band of the transverse pump lattice potential, and its energy is shifted with respect to the bare kinetic energy by the mean-field shift. In the superradiant phase, the emergent checkerboard lattice halves the Brillouin zone (which is defined initially only along the pump direction, but now along both the pump and cavity directions), and the most strongly coupled excited Bogoliubov mode at (±k c , ±k c ) lies in a higher-energy band at zero quasi-momentum of the optical checkerboard potential [20]. A nonzero energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state is expected to remain even at the critical point due to the finite size of the system.In the experimental situation of a finite-size atomic BEC with short-range collisional interactions and a transverse pump-lattice potential, the energy of the excitations have to be rescaled [20].

        <p>Experimental access to the polaritonic excitation spectrum can be gained by performing a variant of Bragg spectroscopy [175,176]. The system is prepared at a transverse pump power, corresponding to a certain coupling strength, and probed by a weak light pulse of amplitude √ n pr injected directly into the cavity mode [20]. The frequency of the probe light pulse has an adjustable difference δ pr relative to the transverse pump frequency, such that the interference between the two gives rise to a time-dependent amplitude-modulated checkerboard lattice potential √ n pr η(r) cos(δ pr t + ϕ) acting on the atoms, where ϕ is the relative phase between the two fields. If this perturbation is resonant with a collective excitation of the system, stimulated scattering of probe photons into the pump and vice versa will take place, leading to the occupation of the excited polariton. Subsequent to the probe pulse, all potentials are switched off, projecting the created atomic excitations onto the free-space momentum states (±k c , ±k c ), which can be detected in absorption imaging after time-of-flight expansion of the BEC. Instead of measuring the atomic population, the light field leaking from the cavity during the probe pulse can also be analyzed. If the atomic excited momentum state is populated by the perturbing potential, pump photons will be scattered into the cavity mode, leading to an enhanced cavity output field that oscillates at δ pr . The amplitude of these oscillations is maximal on resonance with a collective excitation of the system.

        <p>The atom-photon coupling η(r) induces checkerboard density correlations in the atomic gas with a λ c spatial periodicity in the x-y plane. These correlated fluctuations, which correspond to the atomic component of the lowest polariton mode, are already present in the normal phase below the self-ordering critical point and are the precursors of the mean density modulation emerging in the superradiant phase. In a microscopic picture, these fluctuations correspond to the creation and annihilation of correlated atoms in an excited Bogoliubov mode. They are induced by photons being scattered by the atoms from the pump into the cavity mode and vice versa. These photon scatterings impart momentum kicks onto the atoms, and accordingly lead to a frequency shift of the involved photons, observable in the power spectral density S aa (ω) of the light field leaking from the cavity. When an atom is scattered from the BEC into the excited momentum state via a photon scattering process, the involved photon will be red shifted as it deposits energy in the system. For the opposite process of annihilating a mechanical excitation of the atomic gas, the photon is accordingly blue shifted.

        <p>The density correlations are directly connected to the dynamic structure factor S(k, ω) of the atomic system, which is the spatial and temporal Fourier transform of the density-density correlations. The experimental setting allows direct access to this observable. While the cavity-enhanced Bragg spectroscopy described above is based on the stimulated scattering of photons from one coherent field to another, the measurement of fluctuations requires the analysis of spontaneously and inelastically scattered photons. With respect to free space, the probability to detect spontaneously scattered photons leaking from the cavity mode is increased by several orders of magnitude due to the enhanced vacuum field in the resonator. The density of states for scattering photons has to be high but flat in the energy range of interest, which requires the cavity to operate in the bad cavity limit with respect to the energy of the mechanical excitation, κ ω r . A heterodyne detection scheme can be used to obtain a frequency-resolved measurement of the light field leaking from the cavity [77]. Figure 16 displays a measurement of the power spectral density S aa (ω) of the cavity field together with the extracted dynamic structure factor S(k, ω) as a function of the relative transverse pump power P/P cr and the frequency ω relative to the frequency ω p of the transverse pump. The geometric setup of pump and cavity fields determines the momentum k = (±k c , ±k c ) at which the dynamic structure factor is measured. Power in the frequency bin at ω = 0 corresponds to the elastic (Rayleigh) scattering of pump photons at an existing density modulation, while power at nonzero frequencies corresponds to inelastic (Raman) scattering of pump photons creating or annihilating density fluctuations.

        <p>The width of the sidebands is a measure of the damping of the polaritonic mode. Since this mode has a dominant atomic character, the damping is mainly attributed to the decay of atomic momentum excitations, and the contribution of cavity decay to the damping is negligible (see the discussion at the beginning of Section 3.1.3). The behavior of the damping as a function of the atom-photon coupling strength has been investigated theoretically in detail and originates from Beliaev damping of the checkerboard density modulation and from finite temperature effects [21,142,177]. However, in the overdamped critical regime, where the polariton mode frequency is zero, the contribution to damping from Beliaev decay (or other collision-induced decays) also vanishes. This leaves the cavity loss as the only source of damping which cannot anymore be neglected in principle. As noted above, this regime was not accessible in the ETH Zurich experiments, but could be within reach in the Hamburg setup.The width of the sidebands is a measure of the damping of the polaritonic mode.

        <p>Atomic self-organization can also take place in ring cavities, which support a pair of degenerate, counterpropagating running-wave modes. First experiments investigated the phenomenon of collective atomic recoil lasing (CARL), which is an instability analogous to a free electron laser and has a similar origin as the Dicke phase transition. The atomic gas is trapped at the position of the cavity modes where one of them is pumped through one of the cavity mirrors; see Figure 17(a). Photons injected into the forward-propagating cavity mode can be scattered back via the atoms into the unpumped, counterpropagating cavity mode, while the atoms recoil. Exponential gain of this unpumped, counterpropagating field then triggers the so-called CARL instability. Specifically, the backscattering process leads to the buildup of an interference pattern of the two counterpropagating light fields which acts as a dynamic potential on the atoms. Correspondingly, the atoms form a matter-wave pattern further enhancing the photon scattering in a runaway process. This density wave is accelerated in space, synchronized with the co-moving optical potential generated from the interference of the two cavity fields. As a consequence, the frequency of the light scattered at the atoms is increasingly red-shifted with respect to the probe light due to the Doppler effect. In the bad cavity limit, this leads to the occupation of increasingly higher momentum states. For narrow band resonators in the good cavity limit, processes occupying increasingly higher momentum states are, however, suppressed, effectively stabilizing the system.

        <p>The CARL instability sets in for positive, dispersively-shifted pump-cavity detuning, δ c &gt; 0, and is a runaway process. In an intuitive classical picture [181], the atoms are located close to the maxima of the periodic dipole potential building up from the pumped and back-scattered fields, leading to the acceleration of the atomic system. A pulse of light is emitted while the atoms are transferred from the zero momentum state to higher momentum states in the direction of the pump mode. In contrast, for negative pump-cavity detuning δ c &lt; 0, the phase of the field inside the resonator acquires a phase shift of π with respect to the situation for δ c &gt; 0. The atoms thus are located close to the minima of the emerging dipole potential and can enhance scattering via constructive interference by building up a stationary density grating with a λ c /2 periodicity for narrow-band resonators. Momentum states in the direction of the pump and in the opposite direction are thus symmetrically occupied, hence the name "momentum correlated regime" for δ c &lt; 0 [154].

        <p>The position of the nodes of the emergent optical lattice and correspondingly the atomic density wave in the momentum correlated regime would be arbitrary and set by initial (quantum) fluctuations in an idealized ring cavity, breaking spontaneously the continuous symmetry of both the light-field phase and the origin of the spatial pattern. In a realistic ring cavity, some light is, however, always scattered into the unpumped counterpropagating mode at surface inhomogeneities of the mirrors. Depending on the chosen longitudinal mode of the resonator, this back scattering can be maximized or minimized [182]. Exploiting the situation with maximized back scattering, this backscattered field was used to pin the atomic-density pattern in space and thus to act as a symmetry breaking field of the transition to the momentum correlated regime [183]. Breaking of the continuous symmetry spontaneously can, nevertheless, be approximately realized by pumping the cavity with two non-interfering counterpropagating light fields as discussed in Section 4.3, or by transversely pumping the atomic cloud inside the ring cavity as described in Section 4.2. Also the situation of a transversally pumped atomic cloud coupled to an initially empty ring resonator has been explored experimentally. Scattering from the transverse pump beam under an angle into the ring cavity leads to population of higher momentum modes.

        <p>In a more general case of a balanced spin mixture of atoms prepared in the Zeeman states m F = +1 and m F = -1, the light fields scattered by the individual spin components interfere, leading to competition between the different self-organized states. Depending on the ratio of real and imaginary components of the field scattered into the cavity, it can become energetically more favorable for the system to arrange in a spin modulated texture than in a checkerboard density modulation. Such a phase transition was observed in Ref.

        <p>Figure 19(a) shows the basic experimental scheme. The polarization of the pump electric field E p is oriented along the z axis, and an externally applied bias magnetic field defining the atomic quantization axis allows to rotate the orientation of the atomic pseudospin F by an angle ϕ with respect to the cavity axis. Therefore, the induced dipole moment d = ds +i dv = -α s Ê/2+iα v F× Ê/4F can have components along two orthogonally polarized cavity modes designated by the annihilation operators â (for the mode with a parallel polarization with respect to the pump polarization) and â⊥ (for the mode with an orthogonal polarization with respect to the pump polarization). In particular, ds is aligned along the polarization of the â mode, while dv is parallel to the polarization of the â⊥ mode. The degeneracy of the two mutually orthogonal cavity modes is lifted in the experiment due to birefringence (see Section 2.8.1), and hence they have different resonance frequencies. Depending on the detunings ∆ and ∆ ⊥ between the pump frequency and the respective cavity-mode frequency, the pump field might thus be red-detuned to one cavity mode while it is blue-detuned with respect to the other cavity mode.Figure 19(a) shows the basic experimental scheme.

        <p>At first sight self-organization in repulsive fields might seem counterintuitive, since the atoms will localize in the intensity minima of the pump field, suppressing the scattering of photons into the cavity and thus inhibiting self-organization. However, this purely classical picture of point-like particles does not take into account the finite extent of the BEC wavefunction around the potential minima and that the localization of particles comes at the cost of kinetic energy. As a result, the atomic gas still has a finite overlap with the blue detuned pump field. Since the induced atomic dipoles are driven above their resonance, the light field scattered by the atoms into the cavity oscillates out of phase with respect to the pump field. At the position of the atoms, these two fields thus interfere destructively, again creating potential minima for the atoms; see also Figure 5. This process allows the atoms to lower their potential energy via increased scattering of photons into the resonator, and hence self-organization in a repulsive potential takes place.At first sight self-organization in repulsive fields might seem counterintuitive, since the atoms will localize in the intensity minima of the pump field, suppressing the scattering of photons into the cavity and thus inhibiting self-organization.

        <p>Coupling to the P band of the pump lattice. Although the basic process for self-ordering of low-field seeking atoms is very similar to self-organization of atoms in red-detuned, attractive light fields, significant differences exist. In a blue-detuned pump lattice, the atoms in the ground state localize at the nodes of the pump lattice potential. The maxima of the atomic density are thus shifted by λ c /4 with respect to the maxima of the pump field. Taking the atomic density maxima as origin of the coordinate system, the term η(r) in Equation (7) describing the coupling between the pump and the cavity thus changes parity and becomes ∝ sin(k c y) instead of ∝ cos(k c y). Accordingly, while for atomic red detuning the BEC is coupled from the zero-momentum state of the S band to finite quasi-momenta within the S band, for blue detuned lattices the BEC is coupled to quasi-momenta in the P band, localized at the maxima of the pump potential. The coupling leads to a mode softening at the wave vector of the scattering process [see Figure 20(b)], eventually enabling selforganization for a sufficiently strong pump field. However, for a further increased pump-lattice depth, the energy gap between the S and P bands increases, and the self-organization is finally terminated at some point. As a result, the extent of the self-organized phase as a function of the pump-lattice depth is limited, as can be seen from the experimentally recorded phase diagram in Figure 20(c) [64]. This is in stark contrast to the self-organization in the red-detuned regime, cf. Figure 11.Coupling to the P band of the pump lattice.

        <p>The self-organized atomic density favours the emergence of stripes [see Figure 20(a)] rather than a checkerboard pattern for two reasons. First, in the experiment the pump field is tilted with respect to the cavity mode by 60 • , such that two atomic momentum modes with different energies are addressed by the two-photon scattering. The lower energetic one is predominantly occupied. Second, the structure of the coupling disfavors for ∆ a &gt; 0 a simultaneous population of both modes, different from the situation for ∆ a &lt; 0.The self-organized atomic density favours the emergence of stripes [see Figure 20(a)] rather than a checkerboard pattern for two reasons.

        <p>From the resultant atom-field interaction Hamiltonian, Equation ( 56), it becomes obvious that the two different spatial structures involving cos(k p • r) and sin(k p • r) couple to the real and the imaginary quadratures of the cavity field, respectively. This allows to distinguish them experimentally by measuring the phase φ of the cavity field, as shown in Figures 21(b) and(c). Two superradiant phases, termed SR 1 and SR 2 , are observed which differ in amplitude and phase of the cavity field. In addition, absorption images of the atomic cloud after ballistic expansion reveal that also the spatial structure of the two self-ordered states is different.

        <p>More precisely, during the formation of a supersolid two continuous symmetries must be spontaneously broken, namely, a continuous spatial translational symmetry and an internal U (1) superfluid gauge invariance. This paradoxical state of matter was predicted almost 50 years ago to exist in solid helium-4 [193][194][195]. Despite intensive experimental efforts, there has been so far no conclusive evidence for the observation of supersolidity in helium. Dilute bosonic quantum gases had been proposed as possible candidates for the realization of a supersolid state of matter, if appropriate long-range interactions which favor the superfluid gas to form a crystal could be engineered [196,197]. These interactions might stem from induced or permanent electric dipole moments of the atoms, or can exist for atoms with strong magnetic dipole moments. Cavity-mediated global interactions turn out to be a suitable, alternative route to realize a supersolid, if the discrete Z 2 symmetry of composite atom-cavity systems can be replaced by a continuous U (1) symmetry [26]. This was achieved via symmetry enhancement using two crossed standing-wave linear cavities [58], as we detail below in Section 4.1. Supersolids have since then also been experimentally demonstrated in quantum gases making use of spin-orbit coupling [198], of magnetic dipolar interactions [199][200][201], and of ring cavities [202]. Supersolids in systems with finite-range interactions exhibit a continuous dispersion relation and thus have finite rigidity. In contrast, systems with exclusively global-range interactions show (in the thermodynamic limit) a mode softening at isolated points in momentum space and thus form defect-free and perfectly rigid crystals. The resulting supersolid in the latter systems thus can be seen as the minimal possible version of a supersolid.More precisely, during the formation of a supersolid two continuous symmetries must be spontaneously broken, namely, a continuous spatial translational symmetry and an internal U (1) superfluid gauge invariance.

        <p>A continuous symmetry can be engineered through symmetry enhancement with competing order parameters, as has been discussed in the context of high-temperature superconductors, high-energy physics, and cosmology [203]. The concept is based on fine-tuning Hamiltonian parameters in order to combine the symmetry groups of multiple order parameters into a single group with a higher symmetry. Several schemes enhancing symmetries based on generalized Dicke models exploiting the atomic internal degrees of freedom have been discussed [204][205][206]. The idea can also be applied to the external degree of freedom of a driven quantum gas coupled dispersively to two standing-wave linear cavities. This allows to realize a supersolid in the self-organized superradiant phase, if the two systems each breaking the discrete Z 2 parity symmetry individually are combined to break a continuous U (1) symmetry in real space and cavity field space.A continuous symmetry can be engineered through symmetry enhancement with competing order parameters, as has been discussed in the context of high-temperature superconductors, high-energy physics, and cosmology [203].

        <p>In the experimental realization of a supersolid at the ETH Zurich group, a single BEC was coupled dispersively to two linear optical cavities crossed at a 60°angle, and subject to a standing-wave transverse pump beam [58]; see Figure 22 organization of the atoms can take place in either of the cavities, each breaking a discrete parity symmetry. However, if the two cavity modes are tuned to be degenerate, photons from the pump field can be scattered into either of the two cavity modes without an energetic bias (neglecting scattering between the cavities for the moment), and simultaneous self-organization populating both modes in the two cavities can take place. The optical potential acting on the atoms is formed from the interference of all three involved fields [207]. As a consequence, the x position of the emergent lattice the atoms arrange into depends on the ratio of the field amplitudes α 1 and α 2 in the two cavities. Conversely, the position of the atomic ordering along the x axis determines the cavity-field amplitudes α 1 and α 2 . Since the cavities are degenerate, the energy of the system is independent of the ratio α 1 /α 2 , which can take any value. Thus the self-ordered atomic crystal can be continuously translated along x while the mode occupations are accordingly redistributed without energetic cost. The light-field amplitudes α 1,2 are the individual scalar order parameters characterizing the BEC crystallization according to either cavity-mode field; see Section 3.1.3. They can be combined into a vector order parameter α = α 1 + iα 2 = |α| exp(iφ) that exhibits a continuous rotational U (1) symmetry; see Figure 22(c).

At a certain transverse pump lattice depth, photons leaking from both cavities were simultaneously recorded as a function of the detunings ∆ cj of the two cavities to construct a phase diagram of the system. Three extended phases were observed: a normal phase without self-organization and with no coherent field in either cavity for large enough detunings ∆ cj , and two self-organized phases where either the cavity 1 or the cavity 2 was populated. In addition, self-organization where both cavities were simultaneous populated was only observed for fine-tuned parameters where the effective cavity detunings were identical, δ c1 = δ c2 .

        <p>In order to prove that the system across the double-superradiance crystallization breaks spontaneously the fine-tuned continuous U (1) symmetry [see Equation ( 60)] of the system, the experiment was repeated multiple times. Each repetition showed a different ratio of the field amplitudes in the two cavities, while all parameters were kept constant; see Figure 23(c). From this observation one can conclude that the superfluid crystallizes at a different location in each realization, thereby breaking a continuous spatial symmetry. The observed combination of a broken continuous spatial symmetry with the superfluid phase coherence of the atomic gas is a sufficient requirement for realizing a spontaneously formed crystal with dissipation-free flow, i.e. the minimal version of a supersolid. Above the critical point, two excitation branches appear: the lower polariton remains (almost) gapless while the higher polariton hardens. Investigating real-time dynamics after a short excitation pulse at higher (b) and lower (c) polaritons reveals that these excitation branches can be identified as a gapped amplitude (Higgs) and a gapless phase (Goldstone) mode, respectively.

        <p>The excitation spectrum was probed in the two-crossed cavity system described above using cavity-enhanced Bragg spectroscopy (see Section 3.2.1) measuring the response of the system to a weak probe field injected into either cavity. Figure 24(a) shows the resulting excitation spectrum as a function of transverse pump-lattice depth. The second order phase transition from the normal phase to the supersolid is accompanied by the softening of the lowest polariton that vanishes at the critical point. In the supersolid phase, two excitation branches emerge. One polariton mode hardens again, similar to the rising excitation branch of the lattice supersolid, cf. Figure 15. The second polariton, however, remains at low energies. The observed non-zero excitation gap of the lower excitation branch in the supersolid phase is likely caused by imperfect fine-tuning of the degeneracy of the two cavities, and/or by residual cavity-cavity scattering as discussed below. In principle, photon dissipation from the cavities might also have a contribution to this non-zero excitation gap, as it mixes the amplitude and phase modes.The excitation spectrum was probed in the two-crossed cavity system described above using cavity-enhanced Bragg spectroscopy (see Section 3.2.1) measuring the response of the system to a weak probe field injected into either cavity.

        <p>This separation of excitation frequencies inside the ordered phase suggests an interpretation as Goldstone and Higgs modes. The nature of these modes can, however, also be directly tested by observing real-time dynamics of the order parameter after exciting the system with a strong pulse.

        <p>The system with two crossed cavities was theoretically analyzed in Ref. [209], showing that the U (1) symmetry is an approximate symmetry that holds in the limit of vanishing cavity fields. The atom-mediated scattering of photons between the two cavities favors a state with equal cavity populations for degenerate cavities and reduces the U (1) symmetry to a Z 2 ⊗ Z 2 symmetry. An analysis of the system in terms of a Ginzburg-Landau picture was carried out [209] including finite temperature effects and finite cavity-decay rates. The estimated non-zero effective mass of the Goldstone mode due to higher order scattering processes slightly breaks the U (1) symmetry (which is exactly restored only at the critical point [210]), giving rise to shallow minima in the Landau free-energy landscape. However, the high probability to escape these shallow minima due to the added noise from cavity losses restores the continuous symmetry. The rate of photon scattering processes between the two cavities can be tuned relative to the rate of photon scattering processes from the pump to either cavity by changing the atom-pump detuning ∆ a ; see Section 4.1.1. The inter-cavity photon scattering processes involve coupling of the zero-momentum BEC to additional higher momentum states. If one cavity is populated with photons, this cavity field can then act as an additional pump field for the second cavity and influence the critical point for self-organization [211]. Such inter-cavity photon scattering processes break the degeneracy and either favor a superposition of both cavity modes or a symmetry breaking between them.The system with two crossed cavities was theoretically analyzed in Ref.

However, the high probability to escape these shallow minima due to the added noise from cavity losses restores the continuous symmetry. The rate of photon scattering processes between the two cavities can be tuned relative to the rate of photon scattering processes from the pump to either cavity by changing the atom-pump detuning ∆ a ; see Section 4.1.1. The inter-cavity photon scattering processes involve coupling of the zero-momentum BEC to additional higher momentum states. If one cavity is populated with photons, this cavity field can then act as an additional pump field for the second cavity and influence the critical point for self-organization [211]. Such inter-cavity photon scattering processes break the degeneracy and either favor a superposition of both cavity modes or a symmetry breaking between them.</p>
        <p>Figure 25 shows experimental phase diagrams as a function of the two cavity detunings ∆ cj for different atomic detunings ∆ a . For small absolute atomic detunings, inter-cavity photon scattering processes are strongly enhanced, and self-organization in one cavity favors self-organization in the other cavity. Thus, for a wide range of parameters, the system organizes simultaneously in both cavity modes, giving rise to a broken Z 2 ⊗ Z 2 symmetry; see Figure 25(a). The opposite limit of large absolute atomic detunings has already been discussed in detail in Section 4.1.2. In this case, the simultaneous superradiance in both cavities is suppressed due to the absence of photon scattering between the two cavities and only possible for degenerate cavity modes [i.e., along the diagonal in Figure 25(d)], resulting in a broken U (1) symmetry.Figure 25 shows experimental phase diagrams as a function of the two cavity detunings ∆ cj for different atomic detunings ∆ a .

        <p>In the limit of very strong inter-cavity photon scattering, it was theoretically discussed that an exotic vestigially ordered phase, located between the normal and the superradiant phases, can be entered [212]. In this vestigially ordered phase, the atomic cloud acquires a density modulation, but neither cavity mode is macroscopically populated. In order to reach this phase, its kinetic energy cost has to be lower than the kinetic energy cost of the density wave from the standard self-ordered phase. This can be achieved for small angles between the two cavities (or in multi-mode cavities), since the atomic kinetic energy cost is given by the momentum difference between the two cavity-mode wave vectors.In the limit of very strong inter-cavity photon scattering, it was theoretically discussed that an exotic vestigially ordered phase, located between the normal and the superradiant phases, can be entered [212].

By arranging three cavities in a plane symmetrically such that they make a 60°angle with one another and placing a transversely-driven BEC in their common intersection [see Figure 26 [213]. In particular, a continuous SO(3) rotational symmetry is realized in the low-energy physics for symmetric coupling of the BEC to all cavities [the red dashed line denoted by S 3 in Figure 26(b)]. Here the continuous SO(3) symmetry corresponds to the redistribution of photons among the three cavities at a given fixed total intensity. The continuous SO(3) rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken at the onset of the triple superradiance, where all the cavity modes are populated. Correspondingly, two gapless Goldstone modes appear in the collective excitations of the system. This can be understood based on the fact that SO(3) is a higher dimensional symmetry, related to three different continuous translations of the atomic positions along the directions perpendicular to each one of the cavity wave vectors.

        <p>The imaginary parts of the polaritons exhibit a peculiar behavior. Above the critical pump strength η 0c , all the collective excitations except the gapless Goldstone mode acquire imaginary parts. The imaginary part of the lowest polariton mode as a function of √ N η 0 /ω r is shown in the inset of Figure 27(b). We note that although this mode is damped for small pump strengths, the imaginary part vanishes at the critical pump strength η 0c (note that the corresponding real part vanishes at the slightly lower pump strength η 0s , where the damping reaches its maximum value; see also Figure 9). This means that the center of mass of the entire modulated BEC can move freely along the cavity axis dragging the superradiant optical lattice with itself without experiencing any friction. The fact that supersolidity survives even in the presence of dissipation is due to the fact that the corresponding Lindblad operators also respect the U (1) symmetry of the system. Such a dissipationless supersolid particle flow in a ring cavity-an open quantum system-can be used as a very sensitive tool for a precise, non-destructive measurement of various forces including the gravitational force [90]; see Section 11.3 for more details.The imaginary parts of the polaritons exhibit a peculiar behavior.

        <p>In a related ring-cavity-BEC geometry, signatures of supersolidity have been experimentally observed in a BEC of 87 Rb atoms [202]. This scheme exploited two pairs of running-wave transverse modes (TEM 00 and TEM 20 ), where the modes in each pair are degenerate (i.e., propagating in opposite directions) and do not interfere with the modes in the other pair because of a large frequency offset between the pairs. Two counterpropagating modes, one mode from each pair, were longitudinally pumped by coherent laser fields through a cavity mirror; see Figure 28(a). For symmetric and strong enough pumping, the uniform BEC was self-ordered into a stationary crystalline state, breaking the continuous spatial symmetry of the system. The crystalline state maintains the long-range phase coherence of the BEC; hence, it is a supersolid state. Superfluidity of the atomic crystal was inferred from the observation of distinct momentum peaks after ballistic expansion.

        <p>In the absence of a multifrequency or a Floquet drive [217][218][219], coupling to a large number of cavity modes is achieved by tuning the cavity to a degenerate point, where several tens or hundreds of modes are almost resonant with the driving laser (see Figure 7). In this situation, the collective polaritonic excitation, whose coherent occupation corresponds to superradiance, is a superposition of a large number of cavity modes. The superposition of many cavity modes generically leads to destructive interference which makes the scattered light spot more local. As an important consequence, cavitymediated atom-atom interactions become finite range, offering a promising route to observe interaction-induced fluctuations and beyond-mean-field physics. As the largest constructive interference is obtained by a localized atomic cloud, the cavity-mediated interaction is attractive and strongest at short distances. Unless counteracted by sufficiently strong Van-der-Waals interatomic repulsion, this leads to the formation of superradiant, self-bound crystalline droplets instead of extended crystals.In the absence of a multifrequency or a Floquet drive [217][218][219], coupling to a large number of cavity modes is achieved by tuning the cavity to a degenerate point, where several tens or hundreds of modes are almost resonant with the driving laser (see Figure 7).

        <p>As discussed in Section 2.8.1, in the near-planar case all the modes of a given family [see Figure 7(c)] share the same longitudinal index l as well as the same longitudinal standing-wave modulation cos(k c x).

        <p>On the other side of the stability diagram in the concentric case (see Figure 7), modes belonging to the same family instead share the same total number of nodes l + m + n. These degenerate modes thus can have a different number of longitudinal nodes, captured by the index l. Sufficiently away from the cavity center x λ c , all the modes in a given family still show a longitudinal periodic modulation with wave number k c . Indeed, due to the small beam waist w 0 ∼ λ c , the Gouy phase ϕ Gouy mn (x) [see Equation (39)] quickly saturates to a spatially independent constant away from the center. Differently from the near-planar case, however, in the near-concentric case the Gouy phase is crucial in determining the mode frequency as well as in inducing a phase offset ϕ offset mn which differs for modes with different total transverse index m + n. Requiring that the electric field satisfies the boundary conditions at the mirrors x = ± res /2 fixes the phase offset ϕ offset mn . Equation (39) then implies that modes with different m + n are offset with respect to each other by a phase ϕ offset mn = (m + n) arctan(λ c res /2πw 2 0 ). Let us consider the oscillating part (i.e., without the Gouy phase shift) of the longitudinal modulation in combination with the offset just discussed. In the concentric limit, arctan(λ c res /2πw 2 0 ) = π/2, so that different transverse modes come with a periodic longitudinal modulation cos(k c x) for m + n = 0, sin(k c x) for m + n = 1,cos(k c x) for m + n = 2, . . . . In the confocal case instead, arctan(λ c res /2πw 2 0 ) = π/4, so that different transverse modes of a family come with a modulation cos(k c x) for m + n = 0, sin(k c x) for m + n = 2,cos(k c x) for m + n = 4, . . . , and similarly for an odd family m + n = 1, 3, 5, . . . . Approaching both the plane-parallel and the concentric limit in principle allows to reach full mode degeneracy. The concentric degeneracy is preferable over the planeparallel one since the latter is characterized by a diverging mode volume, hence a vanishing light-matter coupling [see Equation (44)]. We will return to the concentric case in Section 5.4. However, the extent to which degeneracy can be achieved in both limits is affected by resonator stability. Experiments realizing multimode cavity QED with ultracold atoms have for this reason so far utilized the confocal degeneracy [27,153,220,221]. As shown in Figure 7, the latter lies indeed in the middle of the stability diagram and can successfully be reached, as we will discuss in the next two sections.On the other side of the stability diagram in the concentric case (see Figure 7), modes belonging to the same family instead share the same total number of nodes l + m + n. These degenerate modes thus can have a different number of longitudinal nodes, captured by the index l. Sufficiently away from the cavity center x λ c , all the modes in a given family still show a longitudinal periodic modulation with wave number k c . Indeed, due to the small beam waist w 0 ∼ λ c , the Gouy phase ϕ Gouy mn (x) [see Equation (39)] quickly saturates to a spatially independent constant away from the center. Differently from the near-planar case, however, in the near-concentric case the Gouy phase is crucial in determining the mode frequency as well as in inducing a phase offset ϕ offset mn which differs for modes with different total transverse index m + n. Requiring that the electric field satisfies the boundary conditions at the mirrors x = ± res /2 fixes the phase offset ϕ offset mn . Equation (39) then implies that modes with different m + n are offset with respect to each other by a phase ϕ offset mn = (m + n) arctan(λ c res /2πw 2 0 ). Let us consider the oscillating part (i.e., without the Gouy phase shift) of the longitudinal modulation in combination with the offset just discussed. In the concentric limit, arctan(λ c res /2πw 2 0 ) = π/2, so that different transverse modes come with a periodic longitudinal modulation cos(k c x) for m + n = 0, sin(k c x) for m + n = 1,cos(k c x) for m + n = 2, . . . . In the confocal case instead, arctan(λ c res /2πw 2 0 ) = π/4, so that different transverse modes of a family come with a modulation cos(k c x) for m + n = 0, sin(k c x) for m + n = 2,cos(k c x) for m + n = 4, . . . , and similarly for an odd family m + n = 1, 3, 5, . . . . Approaching both the plane-parallel and the concentric limit in principle allows to reach full mode degeneracy. The concentric degeneracy is preferable over the planeparallel one since the latter is characterized by a diverging mode volume, hence a vanishing light-matter coupling [see Equation (44)].

        <p>Before proceeding, however, let us stress one difference between confocal and concentric degeneracies which is especially relevant for the purpose of studying many-body physics. In the concentric case, a degenerate family includes modes with all possible numbers of nodes, so that the full destructive interference resulting from their superposition allows for light fields which can be local over the characteristic distance between atoms. On the other hand, in the confocal case, a degenerate family excludes every second mode, so that the destructive interference is only partial and revivals of cavity fields at large distances appear (see Section 5.3).Before proceeding, however, let us stress one difference between confocal and concentric degeneracies which is especially relevant for the purpose of studying many-body physics.

        <p>When the atomic cloud is coupled to a single mode of the cavity, the superradiant phase transition breaks spontaneously the discrete Z 2 symmetry of the system, by fixing the phase of the cavity field relative to the pump laser (see Section 3). This is the case since the longitudinal modulation has a single possible phase offset, and so does the corresponding density modulation ∝ cos(k c x) of the atomic cloud in the superradiant phase. As we have seen in Section 5.1, the situation changes at the confocal degeneracy, where an additional longitudinal modulation ∝ sin(k c x) is also possible. This can effectively lead to a continuous U (1) symmetry [150], as we will discuss in the next section. For now, we just note that in the near-confocal case of Figure 29 the distance from confocality is large enough to allow for only a single possible longitudinal modulation and thus realizes only the standard Z 2 symmetry breaking.When the atomic cloud is coupled to a single mode of the cavity, the superradiant phase transition breaks spontaneously the discrete Z 2 symmetry of the system, by fixing the phase of the cavity field relative to the pump laser (see Section 3).

        <p>We first note that for a laser which is red-detuned from the lowest mode of the family, the interaction potential has an attractive minimum at zero interatomic distance. This is a generic feature of cavity-mediated interactions in the multimode case, result- ing from the fact that the largest constructive interference in the scattering of laser photons into the cavity happens always when the atoms are at the same spot. This attractive minimum has important consequences for the many-body physics, which will be discussed in Section 5.4.We first note that for a laser which is red-detuned from the lowest mode of the family, the interaction potential has an attractive minimum at zero interatomic distance.

        <p>The width of the attractive minimum as a function of the interatomic distance along the transverse direction is roughly given by ξ = w 0 / √ 2M * , i.e., it is set by the amount of confocality M * . In the ideal confocal case M * → ∞, this width goes to zero. However, this does not happen in reality mainly due to the finite number of modes supported by the cavity, which limits the destructive interference between the modes. In the following, we argue that the length ξ plays the role of the interaction range. This is, however, not strictly true since in the confocal case only either even or odd transverse modes contribute to a given degenerate family. One consequence of this is that the interaction potential in general does not fall to zero at large interatomic distances, as shown in Figure 30(a), which can also be explained as resulting from the presence of a mirror image for each atom. However, moving the center of mass of the atoms transversally away from the cavity axis, the image-induced background interaction decays to zero over a length set again by ξ, as shown by the green and red curves in Figure 30(a). A further consequence of having only half of the modes involved is the presence of residual oscillations around zero, also shown in Figure 30(a). In the limit of infinitely many modes the ratio between the amplitude of the oscillations and the global minimum approaches zero. The oscillations have a period set by the beam waist w 0 and essentially no decay (the much faster wiggles visible in the figure are instead a spurious effect of using a hard cutoff in the cavity-mode sum instead of the more physical smooth cutoff). In the equivalent atom-image picture, these residual oscillations correspond to the interference fringes generated by the atom and its image. As discussed in Ref. [150], this long-range oscillating part can, however, be eliminated by bringing the neighboring even family into play using a second driving laser tuned one free spectral range away.The width of the attractive minimum as a function of the interatomic distance along the transverse direction is roughly given by ξ = w 0 / √ 2M * , i.e., it is set by the amount of confocality M * .

Here the potential oscillates with a period set by the wavelength λ c . In the confocal case the dependence of the Gouy phase ϕ Gouy mn (x) on the longitudinal coordinate is slow since w 0 λ c , so that every transverse mode has essentially the same longitudinal spatial dependence over several periodic oscillations. As discussed in Section 5.1, different transverse modes can still have a different phase offset of the longitudinal oscillations. The consequence of this on the interaction potential is observable in its dependence on the center-ofmass position along the longitudinal direction, shown in Figure 30(c).

        <p>Let us now turn to the actual experimental characterization of the interaction potential. As mentioned, this relies on inferring its strength from the value of the superradiant threshold. For a BEC of small transverse size w BEC compared to the beam waist w 0 , we see from Equation (69) that close to the confocal point the local part of the interaction potential is much more important than the nonlocal part in determining the threshold, which would depend on the self-interaction Deff (R ⊥0 , R ⊥0 ; X 0 ) around the center of the small atomic cloud R 0 = (X 0 , R ⊥0 ) = (X 0 , Y 0 , Z 0 ). The contribution of the nonlocal part to the self-interaction is indeed of order one, while the contribution from the local part is of order M * 1 near confocality. For the determination of the superradiant threshold, the two coupled equations for the order-parameter components Θ c,s can be thus considered approximately decoupled. This allows to obtain a simple relation between the critical value Ω 0c of the laser strength and the strength of the local part of the effective self-interaction potential [27]:Let us now turn to the actual experimental characterization of the interaction potential.

        <p>The relation of Equation (77) has been used in the experiment [27] to reconstruct the spatial dependence of the local effective interaction (76). More precisely, due to the divergence of the Bessel function at zero argument, Equation (77), which assumes the transverse envelope of the BEC to be infinitely localized ψ etr ∝ δ(r ⊥ -R ⊥0 ), can- not be directly used. The transverse spatial average in Equation ( 69) needs instead to be performed over a finite BEC size. The experimental results are presented in Figure 31 for different cavity lengths. As clear from Equation (76), even though the experimental data of Figure 31(b) only measure the self-interaction as a function of the center-of-mass position Y 0 , they already show the relevant scales characterizing the local interaction potential: the width ξ of the (attractive) peak and a background value decaying on a scale much slower than w 0 . Those features of the effective potential are also found in the microscopic interatomic interaction potential shown in Figure 30. Measurements involving two separate BECs have also been performed, which allowed to access the finite-distance behavior of the local part of the effective interaction potential.

        <p>While the nonlocal part does not appreciably modify the superradiant threshold, it is crucial in determining the associated density modulation of the BEC. This is already evident from Equation (73), where the nonlocal interaction favors one of the two components Θ c,s of the order parameter depending on the transverse position. This means that, depending on the BEC location the superradiant longitudinal density modulation would be either cosinusoidal or sinusoidal. In fact, as discussed in Ref. [150], away from the cavity midplane the nonlocal part of the effective interaction is not a real quantity anymore, which results in a coupling between the two order parameters via an additional term in Equation (73) proportional to σ x Im Deff nonloc . This implies that in general the superradiant density modulation along the longitudinal direction is not either cosinusoidal or sinusoidal, but rather a superposition of the two with a phase dependent on the position of the BEC. The behavior of this relative phase has also been characterized experimentally by means of the cavity output field [221]. The prin- ciple of such measurement can be understood in the adiabatic cavity limit, which we used to derive Equation (69). In this limit, the cavity field components α mn are locked to the order-parameter components Θ c,s , i.e., the cavity fields are fully determined by the instantaneous value of the atomic order parameters. The total cavity field in real space is then given by a sum over the Hermite-Gaussian modes, weighted by the coefficients α mn . The measured cavity output corresponds to the forward-travelling component of the total cavity field passing through one of the mirrors.

        <p>We conclude this section by discussing the symmetries of the effective model of Equation (69). In the generic case just discussed, where the nonlocal part of the interaction potential shifts and also couples the two components Θ c,s of the order parameter, one is left with the usual single-mode scenario where the superradiant transition corresponds to the spontaneous breaking of a discrete Z 2 symmetry [see Equation (15)]. In the present notation, this symmetry corresponds to the choice of the global shift γ = 0, π in Equation ( 68), while Θ s,c are not independent so that a superposition of fixed relative phase is chosen, as shown in Figure 32. However, under certain conditions the two components of the order parameter can become independent and equivalent, so that a continuous U (1) symmetry emerges in the system [150]. Assuming perfect confocality and choosing the cavity midplane X 0 = 0, the effective interaction is given by Equation (73). Taking the transverse BEC size w BEC much smaller than λ c , one can approximately consider only the self-interaction r ⊥ = r ⊥ in Equation ( 69) for the order-parameter components. By choosing the position of the BEC such that Deff nonloc (R ⊥0 , R ⊥0 ) = 0, the equations for Θ c,s are not only decoupled but also equivalent, so that their relative weight can be chosen arbitrarily, thus a U (1) symmetry emerges. Such special positions exist also out of the cavity midplane, and the U (1) symmetry can exist approximately also for small deviations from confocality or finite BEC size [150].We conclude this section by discussing the symmetries of the effective model of Equation (69).

        <p>Having discussed the characteristics of the cavity-mediated interaction potential around the confocal degeneracy, let us now explore the consequences for the many-body physics. In particular, we focus on the types of crystalline phases and phase transitions that can appear in this case. As already observed in Section 5.3.1, the main feature of the cavity-mediated interaction in or around the confocal point is the presence of an attractive minimum at zero interatomic distance [see Figure 30(a) and (b)]. This feature is quite generic to laser-driven atoms coupled to multiple cavity modes, as the strongest constructive light scattering occurs typically when all the atoms are located at the same position. For a laser which is red detuned from a degenerate mode family, the resulting potential is attractive. As indicated by Equation ( 77), red detuning is necessary to observe superradiance and the accompanying crystallization of the atoms. Moreover, for a blue-detuned laser with respect to the cavity modes, heating of the atomic cloud might become an issue.Having discussed the characteristics of the cavity-mediated interaction potential around the confocal degeneracy, let us now explore the consequences for the many-body physics.

        <p>The consequence of an attractive interaction minimum at zero interatomic distance for an atomic bosonic cloud is the instability of the latter towards collapse. This collapse is counteracted by the finite temperature or the quantum kinetic energy, as well as by the short-range atomic repulsion, therefore leading to the formation of a stable, self-bound droplet state. Considering that the cavity-mediated interaction generically features also an oscillatory part, depending on the period of such oscillations compared to the droplet size, the latter may exhibit a density modulation associated with superradiance. The density crystallization breaks spontaneously a (typically discrete) translation symmetry of the system, accompanied with a phase-locking of the superradiant cavity field with respect to the pump laser. Noting Equation (67), we stress that the oscillatory part of the interaction might stem from the cavity modes, i.e., from D, and/or from the spatial profile of the driving laser Ω(r).The consequence of an attractive interaction minimum at zero interatomic distance for an atomic bosonic cloud is the instability of the latter towards collapse.

        <p>The qualitative phase diagram of Figure 33 is generic to systems where the attractive minimum of the cavity-mediated interaction at zero distance has a finite width ξ, as is the case close to a confocal degeneracy (see Figure 30). The attractive minimum of size ξ has been indeed observed from the superradiant light emission using a BEC inside a confocal cavity as discussed in the previous section. Due to the tight tweezer trap, the BEC had a characteristic size w BEC ∼ 10 µm ∼ minξ ∼ w 0 /2 (see Figure 31). Therefore, even though the droplet size can be appreciably smaller than ξ (depending on the interatomic repulsion), the cavity-output spatial resolution available in Refs. [27,221] would not have allowed to identify the droplet. However, the use of a shallower trap creating a BEC whose transverse extension is above ξ should allow to distinguish the superradiant droplet from the extended crystalline phase.The qualitative phase diagram of Figure 33 is generic to systems where the attractive minimum of the cavity-mediated interaction at zero distance has a finite width ξ, as is the case close to a confocal degeneracy (see Figure 30).

        <p>In the phase diagram of Figure 33, the nature of the transition between the homogeneous and the crystalline phase has not been specified. The reason is that this depends on the actual range of the interaction and not strictly on the width ξ of the attractive minimum at zero distance. A clear example is the confocal interaction potential of Figure 30, where the actual range of the interaction is infinite (compared to available atom-cloud sizes) while ξ can be small. As already discussed, this is a consequence of the imperfect destructive interference due to the missing odd or even modes in a confocal family. In this situation, the crystallization transition is of second-order and of the mean-field type, i.e., the same as in the single-mode case (see Section 3.1.1). However, as already mentioned above, by keeping the cloud away from the cavity axis and eliminating the long-range oscillating background via an additional laser, a confocal cavity can be used to engineer a genuine short-range interaction with a scale given by ξ, in which case beyond-mean-field effects would become accessible.In the phase diagram of Figure 33, the nature of the transition between the homogeneous and the crystalline phase has not been specified.

        <p>A further option is to approach the concentric limit. As discussed in Sections 2.8.1 and 5.1, a degenerate family in the concentric case possesses both even and odd transverse modes, which allows for completely destructive interference at long distances and thus a finite cavity-mediated interaction range. As already mentioned before, the perfect concentric limit can never be achieved as it corresponds to an unstable point, so that only a near-concentric regime is accessible. As shown in Figure 7(c), this regime has the peculiarity that higher-order transverse modes lie lower in frequency, which means that for a red-detuned pump laser the highest-order transverse modes are the closest ones to resonance and thus mostly coupled with the atoms. Therefore, the resultant cavity-mediated interaction potential strongly depends on the mode cutoff, i.e., on the details of the cavity mirrors beyond the simple curvature and reflectivity. A sharp mode cutoff is certainly not a good approximation. While proper mode-dependent loss rates κ ν in Equation ( 64) can work well in concentric cavities, where among others diffraction losses due to finite mirror sizes need to be accurately modeled [225]. Therefore, qualitative features of the photon-mediated interaction in near-concentric cavities will depend on the actual cavity employed. While a large portion of the phase diagram should in general feature a droplet phase due to the attractive minimum at zero distance expected also in near-concentric cavities, the properties of the transition between the homogeneous and the extended crystalline phase have to be discussed case by case.A further option is to approach the concentric limit.

        <p>Here we limit ourselves to briefly discuss a particular example investigated theoretically in Ref. [26]. Though considering an idealized case, it well illustrates the promise of multimode cavities for realizing interesting many-body physics of crystallization. The proposed setup is illustrated in Figure 34. The basic idea is that (thermal or quantum) fluctuations, which become important for a short-enough interaction range, can modify the order of the transition as illustrated by the free energy sketched in Figure 34(c). In Refs. [26,134], starting from the microscopic description of the atomcavity system, an effective free energy for the superradiant order parameter is derived. We will not present the calculation here and limit ourselves to describe the qualitative picture instead. Assuming one can approximately realize a radial symmetry on the atomic plane for a perfectly concentric cavity, the superradiant order parameter corresponds to a density modulation with a wave vector whose modulus is set by the laser wavelength but its direction is arbitrary chosen in the plane. This plane-wavelike picture relies on an approximate momentum conservation valid in the limit of very large clouds with respect to the wavelength, and also on excluding (via a sharp cutoff) modes which have a more radial than longitudinal nodes. Within this description, getting closer to the superradiant threshold the order parameter fluctuations grow. Since they can have an arbitrary direction in the plane, they form a quasi-continuum which impacts the critical behavior very strongly, so that the order of the transition is changed from the second-order mean-field type to a fluctuation-induced weak first or- der. This mechansim is known as the Brazovskii mechanism [226,227]. Besides relying on a quasi-continuum of order-parameter components with radial symmetry, it also requires the free energy not to contain cubic terms, so that at the mean-field level the crystallization transition can remain of second order (which is actually not the typical case in most materials [227]). In the specific geometry of Figure 34(a) and within the approximations employed in Ref. [26], one can show that the cubic terms are indeed absent from the effective free energy for the superradiant order parameter [26,134]. We note that the instability towards the self-bound droplets discussed above, which corresponds to a strongly first-order transition, is automatically excluded if the cubic terms are absent.Here we limit ourselves to briefly discuss a particular example investigated theoretically in Ref.

        <p>So far, we have mainly focused on many-body cavity QED systems where the internal dynamics of atoms are not relevant (i.e., they evolve much faster than the external degrees of freedom) and are omitted.

        <p>Spin-dependent self-organization of a spinor BEC was already discussed in Section 3.3.2, where the population of each spin component was conserved. Here we instead focus on more general processes, where the cavity-assisted photon scattering drives spin-changing Raman processes and therefore the population of individual spin components is not conserved across the superradiant phase transition. This leads to the concept of combined, stationary density and spin self-ordering introduced in Ref. [68], where they studied the Dicke superradiance phase transition for a generalized atomic system with both internal and external quantized degrees of freedom.

        <p>The recent experimental realization of a tunable Fermi gas inside an optical cavity [61] has opened up interesting avenues of research with interacting spinful Fermi gases. In the experiments performed at the EPF Lausanne the scattering length governing the interactions between fermions in different spin states can be tuned using a standard Feshbach resonance. This allows to control the pairing between the atoms within the cavity, interpolating between the BEC limit (small positive scattering length), where tightly-bound pairs are well described as a condensate of localized bosons, and the BCS limit (small negative scattering length), where weakly-bound pairs are formed. Between these two limits the so-called unitary point is crossed, at which the scattering length diverges. The behavior of the cavity-induced self-organization transition across the BEC-BCS crossover has been studied theoretically in Ref. [242]. The main finding, shown in Figure 37, is that self-organization is maximally enhanced in the unitary regime for low densities, in the BCS regime for moderate densities close to Fermi surface nesting, or in the BEC regime for high densities.The recent experimental realization of a tunable Fermi gas inside an optical cavity [61] has opened up interesting avenues of research with interacting spinful Fermi gases.

While first experiments were based on thermal atoms [110,244], we here discuss a more recent realization using a BEC [71]. Operating in the quantum degenerate regime implies that experiments take place at effectively zero temperature, that all atoms couple identically to light fields as they share the same spatial wave function, and that the self-organization of the matter wave can be clearly observed in the appearance of sharp momentum peaks.

        <p>7.1.1.2. Incommensurate: Bose-glass phase. We now consider the case where the ratio λ c /λ latt is not a rational number [56,75,131,264]. Therefore, the external classical lattice is not commensurate with the pump and dynamical potentials, resulting in a non-periodic configuration. One may envisage the cavity-mediated interaction as a disorder in this case, since the amplitude of the interaction proportional to A j oscillates at the cavity wavelength λ c , which is incommensurate with respect to the external lattice. The phase diagrams of the system in 1D (along the cavity axis x) and 2D are shown in Figures 41(a) and (b), obtained from quantum Monte Carlo and meanfield simulations, respectively [131]. In addition to the superfluid and Mott-insulator states, the system exhibits another phase with interesting properties. It comprises a compressible state ∂ n/∂µ = 0 with vanishing superfluid density. The atomic density in this phase exhibits a checkerboard density-wave pattern with an envelope at the beating wavenumber |k lattk c |, such that the Bragg density order parameter Θ = j A j nj /N Λ acquires a nonzero value. The envelope arises due to the fact that the system tries to maximize Θ by convoluting the (checkerboard) density as A j oscillates at the cavity wavelength λ c and becomes out of phase with respect to the external lattice with the incommensurate wavelength λ latt .

        <p>The effect of the cavity-mediated interactions is particularly evident in the 1D case, where the pump term is a constant shift in the chemical potential [cf. Equation ( 89)]: At small hopping amplitudes the sizes of the Mott lobes reduce and they give way for the Bose-glass states (compare it with the dashed curves for the phase diagram without cavity-mediated interactions U l = 0). By increasing the hopping amplitude, the Bose glass melts and gives way to the superfluid state. Note that in 1D the Bose-glass state corresponds exactly to the superradiant phase, where the cavity field is populated macroscopically.

If the strength of disorder in the external Aubry-André lattice exceeds a critical value, it leads to the Anderson localization of the atoms. As a consequence, the atoms scatter pump photons into the cavity mode completely in phase and constructively, driving the Dicke-superradiant instability even in vanishingly small pump strengths.

Therefore, one has to find selfconsistently the Wannier functions of the lowest Bloch band of the total lattice potential, V ext (r) + V (r) + U (r)â † â + η(r)(â † + â). That is, the steady-state cavity field âss , Equation ( 87), depends on the matrix elements (86) calculated using the Wannier functions, which in turn depend on the cavity field through the total lattice potential. Correspondingly, the hopping amplitude J and the strength of the short-range contact interaction U s must be also determined self-consistently. This is a genuine many-body cavity-QED nonlinear effect, where the coupled matter-field dynamics depend crucially on the atomic density.

        <p>As mentioned already, in deriving the lattice Hamiltonian ( 85) only the on-site matrix elements of the spatial part of the pump and dynamic cavity potentials, Equation (86), have been kept. Although much smaller compared to the on-site matrix elements, retaining the off-site matrix elements of the potentials alters the lattice Hamiltonian (85) crucially.

As a consequence, phase boundaries between different phases are modified [52,107]. In particular, in the vicinity of phase boundaries different photon-number states are associated with different atomic states, so that the ground state of the system in the proximity of phase boundaries contains atomic states of different nature correlated with different photon numbers due to photon-number fluctuations.

        <p>Figure 42 displays the basic experimental setup together with the relevant atomic processes. A BEC trapped at the center of an optical cavity by external fields is loaded into a deep optical lattice along the z axis, effectively freezing out tunneling in this direction. This slices the cloud into 2D pancakes in the x-y plane. These 2D layers are further exposed to a classical optical lattice in the x-y plane, formed by one free space lattice along the y direction and one intra-cavity optical standing wave along the x direction. By a choice of perpendicular polarizations and a large enough relative detuning, these two fields do not interfere such that the resulting potential is a square lattice. This corresponds to the external optical lattice V ext (r) introduced in Equation ( 84) with adjustable lattice depth V (0) latt , allowing to tune the strength of the short-range interactions as well as the hopping amplitude. At the same time, the standing-wave potential along the y axis acts additionally as a transverse pump lattice with lattice depth V 0 = V (0) latt [cf. Equation ( 85)] for another cavity mode with the similar polarization, inducing the cavity-mediated global interactions. The resonance frequency of the cavity is chosen with an adjustable detuning ∆ c with respect to the frequency of this pump field. As a result, the strength of the cavity-mediated global-range interactions ∝ A 2 U l can be tuned by changing ∆ c or by varying V (0) latt . Most importantly, this arrangement allows to change the ratio of short-range and global-range interactions which can thus be brought into competition. The physics of this system is captured in a wide range of parameters by a Hamiltonian of the form of Equation (91). It is, however, important to note that due to the twofold role of the transverse pump as the external lattice and the pump field simultaneously, the transverse pump is not a perturbative term anymore. This requires to calculate the Wannier functions, J, U s , and other coefficients consistently using V (0) latt = V 0 .

        <p>In order to detect different quantum phases reached by tuning the parameters, two observables are necessary. First, the presence or absence of an intra-cavity light field is a measure whether the atomic system has an imbalanced occupation of the even and odd lattice sites or not [see Equations ( 87) and ( 88)], allowing to distinguish the superfluid and Mott-insulating phases from the lattice-supersolid and the charge-densitywave phases. Second, absorption images of the atomic cloud after ballistic expansion are used to probe the coherence of the gas. Observation of narrow momentum peaks and a high condensate fraction indicate the presence of coherence typical for the superfluid and lattice-supersolid phases. In contrast, broadened peaks and a vanishing condensate fraction indicate the loss of coherence and can be associated with the loss of superfluidity and the formation of an insulating phase (i.e., the Mott-insulator and charge-density-wave phases). Combining both observables-related to β e/o and Θ in the mean-field description of Section 7.1.1.1-thus allows to distinguish all the possible phases of the system. This scheme was experimentally implemented in Ref. [49], and Figure 43 displays the measurement of both observables as a function of the lattice depth V (0) latt and the relative cavity-pump detuning ∆ c . The BEC fraction vanishes for increasing lattice depth V (0) latt and a threshold for the transition from the superfluid to insulating phases can be defined, as indicated by the white data points; see Figure 43(a) and(b). Figure 43(c) and(d) show respectively the simultaneously measured intra-cavity photon number and the imbalance Θ = Θ between even and odd sites as defined in Equation ( 88), but assuming completely localized atoms on even or odd sites. This imbalance is directly calculated from the mean intra-cavity photon number using Equation (87). Also for this observable, a threshold can be defined that indicates the transition from a normal phase with balanced occupation of even and odd sites to a superradiant state with an imbalanced occupation.In order to detect different quantum phases reached by tuning the parameters, two observables are necessary. First, the presence or absence of an intra-cavity light field is a measure whether the atomic system has an imbalanced occupation of the even and odd lattice sites or not [see Equations ( 87) and ( 88)], allowing to distinguish the superfluid and Mott-insulating phases from the lattice-supersolid and the charge-densitywave phases.

        <p>Combining the measurement results a phase diagram can be constructed, as shown in Figure 44. All four expected phases [i.e., superfluid (SF), lattice supersolid (LSS), Mott insulator (MI), and charge-density wave (CDW)] can be identified. The transition line between the superfluid and the lattice supersolid shifts to smaller values of V (0) latt when approaching cavity resonance, as expected from self-organization without the additional lattices (see Section 3). The transition line between the lattice supersolid and the charge-density wave follows also this trend, indicating that the insulating phase is entered for smaller lattice depths if a density modulated state is favored. This has been attributed to a reduced nearest-neighbor tunneling due to an increasing energy offset between even and odd lattice sites in the superradiant phases. The transition between the charge-density wave and the Mott insulator phase is especially interesting, since the system has to transition between two different incompressible density patterns while tunneling is strongly suppressed. An experimental exploration of this first-order phase transition is discussed below in Section 7.1.3.2.Combining the measurement results a phase diagram can be constructed, as shown in Figure 44.

        <p>The experimental setup also included a shallow harmonic potential trapping the atomic cloud, leading to an inhomogeneous density profile. As a consequence, it is energetically more costly for the atoms to be away from the trap center and the insulating phases will form a wedding cake structure, also allowing for the coexistence of phases. Furthermore, since the global character of the cavity-mediated interactions leads to a break-down of the local-density approximation, a direct comparison of the experimental results with theoretically calculated phase diagrams is challenging.

        <p>As already mentioned, even without an external optical lattice important aspects of the competition between short-range and cavity-induced global-range interactions can be explored in the deep superradiant phase [53,255]. Indeed, such a setup was the first experimental scheme to explore the competition between short-range and global-range interactions [269]. Figure 45(a) shows the experimental scheme of the Hamburg group where the atomic cloud was sliced into 2D pancakes, however, no additional lattice was applied along the cavity axis. This scheme relies on the fact that the emergent superradiant checkerboard lattice can become sufficiently deep such that the self-organized superfluid (SSF) phase undergoes eventually a transition into a selforganized Mott-insulator (SMI) phase. Since there is no underlying 3D optical lattice, this system can not enter a Mott insulating phase without imbalanced occupations between even and odd sites.As already mentioned, even without an external optical lattice important aspects of the competition between short-range and cavity-induced global-range interactions can be explored in the deep superradiant phase [53,255].

        <p>Figure 46(a) shows the experimental sequence for this study. After the system is prepared in the superfluid phase at a detuning ∆ c corresponding to vanishing globalrange interactions, the depth V (0) latt of the square lattice is ramped up such that the system undergoes a phase transition to the Mott-insulator state. This constitutes the starting point for the experiments exploring the first-order phase transition between the Mott-insulating and charge-density-wave states. In the next step, the absolute value of the detuning is first reduced (ramp I) and then increased again (ramp II) over time, which brings the global-range interactions ∝ U l into competition with the short-range interactions ∝ U s and back, driving the system from the Mott insulator to the charge-density-wave state and back. The light field leaking out of the cavity is a measure for the spatial ordering of the atoms, captured by the imbalance Θ. While Θ ≈ 0 in the Mott-insulator state, the charge-density-wave phase is characterized by a large imbalance Θ. A typical single trajectory measuring the evolution of the imbalance during the two ramps is shown in Figure 46(b). The trajectory encloses a hysteresis loop and encompasses a characteristic jump, indicated by the blue symbol.Figure 46(a) shows the experimental sequence for this study.

        <p>A simple toy model can be used to explain the occurrence of a first order phase transition in this system. Neglecting tunneling for simplicity in ĤceBH (91) in deep insulating phases, the system can be characterized by the competition of short-range and global-range interactions captured by the Hamiltonian Ĥinsul = (U s /2) ∈e,o n (n -1)+(A 2 U l /N Λ ) ( e neo no ) 2 . Figure 46(c) shows the average ground-state energy per particle as a function of the imbalance Θ and the ratio of the interactions U l /U s . In the limit of small global-range interactions, a global energy minimum at zero imbalance stabilizes the system in the Mott-insulator phase. With increasing global-range interactions, Z 2 -symmetric local minima at finite imbalance emerge. By further increasing global-range interactions, the Mott-insulator state becomes a local minimum in the energy landscape, separated from the charge-density-wave states by an energy barrier resulting from competing short-and global-range interactions.A simple toy model can be used to explain the occurrence of a first order phase transition in this system.

        <p>Not captured by this simple model is the observed jump in the imbalance [blue symbol in Figure 46(b)], where the atomic system is strongly re-organized via tunneling between neighboring sites in a dynamic process. Time-resolved studies of this regime indicate that the process is a collective tunneling of several thousand atoms within the expected tunneling time of a single double well. The microscopic description of the observed dynamics relies on the harmonic trapping potential experienced by the atoms. The atomic system accordingly forms a wedding-cake structure with a Mottinsuolator core and a superfluid surface. Particles in the surface possess a high mobility and can locally organize into a density-modulated state. Local self-organization leads to a global energy offset between even and odd sites. Depending on the position in the trap, this offset can bring the tunneling between neighboring sites into resonance, which leads to an avalanche dynamics and very fast collective tunneling.Not captured by this simple model is the observed jump in the imbalance [blue symbol in Figure 46(b)], where the atomic system is strongly re-organized via tunneling between neighboring sites in a dynamic process.

        <p>As discussed in Section 6, when the internal states of atoms become relevant [271], the exchange of cavity photons by the atoms can result in global-range spin-spin and spin-density interactions among the atoms in addition to the density-density interactions [69]. When the atoms are trapped in an external lattice, the cavity-induced longrange spin interactions can then compete directly with contact-interaction-induced short-range spin interactions in the deep insulating phases, opening the possibility for realizing intriguing lattice spin models including topological spin orders and frustrated spin states. Cavity-induced lattice spin models can be obtained by imposing an external optical lattice potential in the spinor models discussed in Section 6.

        <p>Gauge potentials and quantum gauge theories play central roles in our understanding of Nature. The simplest example is electromagnetism with its Abelian vector and scaler potentials describing the coupling between charged matter and electromagnetic fields. Quantum electrodynamics (QED), a relativistic gauge theory describing the coupling of a relativistic charged matter field to the Abelian electromagnetic gauge potentials, is among the most successful and most accurate theories of physics. In the Standard Model of elementary particles, gauge fields are the mediators of fundamental interactions among the elementary particles. Gauge potentials are also of great significance in condensed-matter physics [282]. In fact, they are the essential ingredients of topological states of matter [283,284]. In addition to their fundamental significance, topological insulators are also of great importance from a technological point of view: they possess conducting edge or surface states which are topologically protected and robust against external perturbations. These topological edge states can have exotic properties. In the case of quantum Hall insulators, such edge states carry precisely one quantum of conductance. They can also host anyonic excitations, quasiparticles that do not obey Bose or Fermi statistics.Gauge potentials and quantum gauge theories play central roles in our understanding of Nature.

        <p>Since ultracold atoms are charge neutral, they do not couple to gauge potentials the same way charged particles (such as electrons) do. However, a variety of gauge potentials and minimal couplings can be engineered via the light-matter interaction for neutral atoms, to mimic phenomena encountered not only in condensed-matter physics but also in high-energy physics [8,9,[285][286][287][288]. The induction of such synthetic gauge potentials generally relies on geometric phases acquired through adiabatic motion of quantum particles with internal structures. That is, the light-matter interaction couples parametrically the atomic internal dynamics to its external degree of freedom (i.e., position), resulting in the appearance of a geometric vector potential under special conditions. The laser-induced gauge potentials are normally static, in the sense that the back-action of the quantum matter on these gauge fields is negligible. They are solely background gauge potentials, unaffected by the matter dynamics (though they can still have an externally imposed time dependence) and described by extra fixed terms in the Hamiltonian of the system. For instance, the synthetic electric and magnetic fields induced by the light-matter interaction for quantum gases need not to obey the Maxwell's equations. However, gauge potentials encountered in quantum gauge theories such as QED, quantum chromodynamics, etc., and strongly correlated many-body condensed-matter systems are normally dynamic. That is, the dynamics of these gauge potentials are governed by their own Hamiltonians and affected by the back-action of the matter. Motivated by these dynamical gauge potentials, some proposals have been put forward to simulate dynamical gauge potentials for quantum gases [289].

        <p>An alternative, natural route to implement dynamic gauge potentials for neutral atoms is the framework of cavity QED. This hinges on the non-linear, dynamical nature of cavity fields which can induce gauge potentials. Unlike lasers interacting with atoms in free space, cavity fields are dynamical and affected by the atomic back-action. Therefore, cavity-induced gauge potentials inherit the dynamical nature of the cavity fields and respond naturally to the atomic back-action. Furthermore, as radiation fields decay out of a cavity, quantum-gas-cavity systems with induced gauge potentials are naturally out of equilibrium. This leads to nonequilibrium topological phases in the framework of cavity QED, a scenario beyond common condensed-matter and free-space quantum-gas systems. Guided by this nonlinear coupled dynamics of matter and radiation in cavity QED, proposals have been put forward to induce dynamical gauge fields [69,[292][293][294][295][296][297][298][299][300][301][302][303] and topological phases [59,304,305] for quantum gases in cavities, with the experimental realization of a dynamical spin-orbit coupling [72]. Another peculiarity of cavity-induced gauge potentials and topological states, in addition to their nonequilibrium dynamical nature, is the appearance of them on the onset of the superradiance phase transition. Since the threshold of the superradiant quantum phase transition depends crucially on atomic properties, the onset of a cavity-induced gauge potential and topological phase is also sensitive to atomic structures and is self-consistent.An alternative, natural route to implement dynamic gauge potentials for neutral atoms is the framework of cavity QED.

[297], consider spin-polarized fermionic atoms trapped in a strong external classical 2D lattice in the x-y plane with the superlattice structure along the x direction. The optical lattice is located inside an initially empty linear cavity and created using standing-wave lasers with wavelength λ (y) latt along the y direction, and with wavelengths λ (x) latt and 2λ (x) latt along the x direction (which is the cavity axis). The phase difference of the two lasers along the x direction is chosen such that to create potential offsets ± ∆ latt between adjacent sites of the lattice, resulting in an imbalanced superlattice structure along the cavity (i.e., x) axis. Therefore, the external lattice is separated into a set of decoupled ladders as depicted schematically in Figure 49(a). The atoms can tunnel along the legs of the ladders (i.e., the y direction) due to their kinetic energy, while the tunneling along the rungs (i.e., the x direction) is strongly suppressed due to the potential offset ∆ latt . The atoms are dispersively pumped in the transverse direction by two running-wave pump lasers with space-dependent Rabi couplings Ω 1,2 (y) = Ω 01,02 e ±ikcy and frequencies ω p1,p2 such that ω p2ω p1 = 2∆ latt . The atoms are strongly coupled to a standing-wave mode of the cavity with the bare frequency ω c such that two-photon Raman transitions involving the pump lasers and the cavity mode are close to resonant, ω p2ω c ≈ ω cω p1 ≈ ∆ latt ; see Figure 49(b). The double Λ scheme ensures that the system is not optically pumped into one leg due to the cavity photon losses. The cavity mode is initially in the vacuum state; however, it can be populated due to the constructive, collective Raman scattering from the pump lasers by the atoms. This in turn restores the hopping along the rungs (i.e., the cavity axis along x), imprinting a phase into the wavefunction of the atoms due to the cavity field restores the hopping along the rungs, where the atoms collect the total phase ϕ while traversing a plaquette counterclockwise: -mϕ+(m+1)ϕ = ϕ. This phase simulates an electromagnetic vector potential through the Peierls substitution, where the vector potential corresponds to a synthetic transverse magnetic field perpendicular to the x-y plane. The phase and correspondingly the synthetic magnetic field can be tuned by changing the ratio between the wavelengths λ (y) latt /λ c of the external lattice along the y axis and the cavity.8.1.

The cavity field and the chiral current build up only above a pump-strength threshold η 0c (ϕ), indication of the appearance of the cavity-induced synthetic magnetic field beyond the nonlinear pump-strength threshold η 0c (ϕ). This is in sharp contrast to the free-space implementation of this scheme (in square lattices) [306,307]. For a given filling n, however, the pump-strength threshold η 0c is strongly suppressed at the critical flux ϕ c = 2πn (and 2πϕ c ) and the hopping is restored even for an infinitesimal pump strength. This behavior is intimately related to the band structure and the Fermi points. For critical fluxes ϕ c , the cavity field amplitude increases slowly above the zero pump strength. On the other hand, for ϕ &lt; ϕ c ≤ π and ϕ &gt; 2πϕ c (ϕ c &lt; ϕ &lt; 2πϕ c ) the cavity-field amplitude acquires a nonzero value only beyond a nonzero pump-strength threshold η 0c , exhibiting a first (second) order phase transition into the self-ordered superradiant phase. Depending on the filling n, the atomic ground state corresponds to a band insulator or a liquid, carrying a chiral edge current [indicated respectively by CI and CL in Figures 49(c) and(d)]. In some parameter regimes, there exists a second solution. This second solution vanishes at hight pump strengths, signaling the unstable nature of it. Furthermore, the exact diagonalization of the corresponding master equation for a small-size system reproduces solely the first stable solution (above the pump-strength threshold η 0c ). The field amplitude and the chiral current exhibit similar behavior as functions of the filling n and U l A 2 L/J ∝ η 2 0 for representative fluxes. In particular, the cavity field and the chiral current appear again only above a pump-strength threshold η 0c (n), where the threshold approaches zero at the critical filling n = ϕ c /2π. This cavity-based scheme to implement a synthetic magnetic field in a ladder can be straightforwardly generalized into a square/rectangle optical lattice [303,305], corresponding to the quantum Hall effect for electrons. This allows one to study the Harper-Hofstadter model with fractal energy bands-known as the Hofstadter's butterflyarising from a dynamical synthetic magnetic field. Indeed, the cavity-induced synthetic magnetic field in a finite-size system leads to topological edge states [305]. In an infinite system, the dynamic nature of the magnetic field induces a nontrivial deformation of the Hofstadter butterfly in the superradiant phase due to the delicate interplay between the collective superradiant scattering inducing the synthetic magnetic field and the emerging underlying fractal band structure [303]. This is in sharp contrast to the free-space implementation of this scheme as first proposed in Ref. [308], where the energy bands show the conventional Hofstadter-butterfly structure.Figures 49(c) and (d) show, respectively, the real part of the cavity-field amplitude α and the chiral current j c as a function of the flux ϕ and -U l A 2 L/J ∝ η 2 0 for three representative filling n = 1/2, 3/8, 1/4 [298].

        <p>In the above discussed schemes [297,298,303,305], although the cavity-induced synthetic magnetic field emerges dynamically owing to the backaction of the atoms, the spatial profile of the synthetic magnetic field itself is fixed by the cavity wave number k c . The latter can also be made dynamical as proposed in Refs. [299,300], providing a local dynamical coupling between the matter and the gauge potential as in the Ginzburg-Landau theory. A variant of the scheme discussed in detail above was considered in Ref. [299], where an external 1D lattice with an energy offset ∆ latt between adjacent sites is located perpendicular (i.e., along the y direction) to the axis of a single-mode linear cavity. The suppressed hopping is restored by a cavity-assisted "directional" hopping containing a Peierls phase, which is proportional to the phase of the cavity field and is dynamic and must be determined self-consistently. In an infinite lattice under certain initial conditions, a dynamical vector gauge potential appears in the system, inducing a net, steady-state directed atomic current. In contrast, for a finite system the atomic current shows a transient pulse behavior due to a superradiant pulse (similar to those observed by illuminating degenerate quantum gases in free space) and a nonequilibrium gauge potential. A generalization of this scheme to a two-leg ladder coupled to two cavity modes revealed even more interesting features, including the emergence of an electromotive force due to dynamical instabilities according to simulated Faraday's induction law for the neutral atoms inside the cavity [83]. In a different approach, coupling a BEC to many nearly degenerate transverse modes of a near-confocal cavity in a particular configuration induces a synthetic magnetic field B x , which its spatial profile, proportional to the spatial derivative of the transverse intensity profile of the cavity light field, can evolve freely in response to the atomic state [300]. In particular, the cavity-induced synthetic magnetic field is expelled from the bulk of the condensate due to the diamagnetic response of the system, reminiscent Raman technique using (non-copropagating) plane-wave lasers has so far been the only method to experimentally engineer an equal contribution of the Rashba and Dresselhaus dynamical SO couplings for quantum gases inside cavities [72]-it was also the first method to implement static SO coupling for quantum gases in free space [309,310]. In Raman-based schemes for inducing SO coupling, it is required to employ at least one running-wave light field, in order to impart spin-dependent momentum recoil to the atoms.In the above discussed schemes [297,298,303,305], although the cavity-induced synthetic magnetic field emerges dynamically owing to the backaction of the atoms, the spatial profile of the synthetic magnetic field itself is fixed by the cavity wave number k c .

In Raman-based schemes for inducing SO coupling, it is required to employ at least one running-wave light field, in order to impart spin-dependent momentum recoil to the atoms.</p>

        <p>The atoms are Raman-dressed by one running-wave laser and one counterpropagating plane-wave mode of the ring cavity pumped longitudinally through a cavity mirror. The single-particle energy dispersion of the system has two branches, similar to the free-space SO-coupled atoms. However, the energy dispersion develops a loop structure in some parameter regimes due to the nonlinearity of the system. The nonlinearity also leads to dynamical instabilities, which are more pronounced in the limit of low cavity-photon number. An interacting Λ-type BEC has also been considered inside a ring cavity, where the atoms are Raman-dressed instead by two distinct counterpropagating plane-wave modes of the cavity pumped longitudinally through a cavity mirror [295]. The cavity fields induce a synthetic SO coupling as well as long-range interactions between the atoms, where the latter stems from the dynamical nature of the photonic fields and their backaction on the atomic fields (see Section 2.2). The strength of the cavity-mediated interactions can be tuned readily by changing the pump amplitudes and frequencies as well as the decay rate of the cavity modes. The interplay between the single-particle energy dispersion on one hand, and the two-body contact and cavity-induced global interactions on the other hand determines the many-body ground state of the system. In a wide range of parameters, the stripe phase is favored over the plane-wave phase owing to the cavity-induced interactions. Notably, the stripe phase is energetically stabilized even for condensates with attractive intraspecies and interspecies contact interactions for sufficiently large cavity-induced interactions. Furthermore, for a symmetric double-well energy dispersion it is also possible by tuning the cavity-mediated interactions to obtain a stripe phase with an arbitrary superposition of atoms in the left and right wells, in sharp contrast to a stripe phase in a free-space symmetric double-well energy dispersion consisting of an equal number of atoms in the left and right wells. Both Refs. [294,295] have ignored the unpumped degenerate counterpropagating mode(s) corresponding to the pumped mode(s) of the ring cavities. This is a good first approximation for strongly pumped cavities in short time scales, as the probably of scattering a photon into a strongly pumped mode is much higher than the probability of scattering a photon into the degenerate empty mode due to the Bose-enhancement factor. By building on Ref. [295], the effect of the unpumped degenerate counterpropagating modes in this model has been included and studied in Ref. [230]; though the two-body interactions were omitted. These unpumped modes are populated solely by the coherent backscattering of photons from the pumped modes via the atoms and play an important role in the dynamics of the system in long times. The system exhibits three fundamentally different steady-state phases, as the pump strengths and pump frequencies are varied, characterized by distinct spatial density distributions and spin textures: a combined density and spin wave, a continuous spin-spiral texture with a homogeneous atomic density, and a spin spiral with a modulated density. The spin-spiral states are topologically nontrivial, as discussed in Section 6.2, and are intimately related to cavity-induced SO coupling appearing beyond a critical pump power. The topologically trivial density-wave-spinwave state spontaneously breaks two continuous symmetries, the U (1) freedom of the total phase of the two condensate wave functions and a U (1) screw-like symmetry corresponding to a continuous spatial translation accompanied by phase rotations of the unpumped cavity-field amplitudes and condensate wave functions, a characteristic of a supersolid state as discussed in Section 4. The transitions between different phases are either topological and first order, or non-topological and second order.

        <p>The first experiment demonstrating cavity-assisted dynamical spin-orbit coupling made use of the experimental scheme shown in Figure 52(a) and (b) [72]. It is a variant of the scheme presented in Section 6.4, however, employing running-wave fields for the pumps instead of the standing-wave fields. More precisely, it is a special case of the Hamiltonian of Equation ( 79) for two pure running-wave pump lasers corresponding to R = 0 in Section 6.2. A BEC is loaded into a single-mode cavity and transversally illuminated with two balanced counterpropagating running-wave laser fields. The frequencies of these laser fields are chosen such that they, in combination with vacuum fluctuations of the cavity mode, each induce a Raman transition between two atomic hyperfine states, labeled as |↓ and |↑ . For pump rates below threshold, the atomic spins and positions are disordered, and the Raman scattering rates are low. Above a critical pump strength, spin and density of the gas self-order and the cavity mode is populated with a coherent field due to superradiance. The frequency of the emerging cavity field is the center frequency between the two coherent pump-field frequencies. Above threshold, SO coupling emerges in this scheme. In contrast to a situation with standing-wave pump fields where no net momentum is transferred to a cloud (cf. Section 6.4), during the self-organization with the running-wave pumps momentum is imparted to the system while the atomic spins are flipped. This can also be understood from the momentum-space representation shown in Figure 52(c) and(d). While the cloud is spin polarized in |↓ below the critical pump strength and only occupies the zero momentum state, above threshold additional momentum states are occupied. Since the Raman scattering process is spin selective, the spin state |↑ is only populated if a net momentum along the positive y axis is transferred to the atoms. In contrast along the x axis, the accompanying momentum change averages to zero due to the standing-wave mode of the cavity. Going into an according co-moving reference frame, opposite spin states thus move in opposite directions, which thus realizes a SO coupling. Since this process depends self-consistently on the evolution of the atomic cloud and the cavity field in order to maximize the superradiant collective photon scattering, the SO coupling has a dynamical character.The first experiment demonstrating cavity-assisted dynamical spin-orbit coupling made use of the experimental scheme shown in Figure 52(a) and (b) [72].

        <p>where ∆ a± are the atomic detunings with respect to the two pump fields. Considering the dispersion relation of both spin states in presence of the SO coupling, one finds that the energy bands are displaced from one another due to the opposite momentum recoils and coupled via the Raman-Rabi term. This leads to a double-minima lowest energy-band structure and a band gap given by ΩSOC proportional to â † and â, shown schematically in Figure 52(e) and (f). The superradiant state displaying SO coupling corresponds in real space to an atomic spinor state that exhibits a helical pattern (i.e., spin spiral) along the pump axis according to |↓ ±e ikcy cos(k c x) |↑ . This state corresponds to the chiral spin-spiral phase in Figure 35(b) and Figure 36(a). The experimental observables of this state are the intra-cavity light field that rises to a finite value above threshold and the spin-selective occupation of momentum states according to the expectations described above; see Figure 53. The lifetime of the superradiant state is only on the order of a few milliseconds, most likely limited by a dephasing of the two pump beams. The landscape of the superradiant optical lattice depends crucially on the sign of U 0 ∝ ∆ -1 a = (ω pω a ) -1 as illustrated in Figure 5. The lattice potential V SR (x) is λ c periodic due to the interference term ∝ cos(k c x). For a conventional red-detuned pump laser (and cavity field) with respect to the relevant atomic transition U 0 ∝ ∆ -1 a &lt; 0, the superradiant lattice has a single global minimum in every unit cell of length λ c . More precisely, the unit cell contains two lattice sites with an energy offset between them. For the blue-detuned repulsive case U 0 ∝ ∆ -1 a &gt; 0, in stark contrast V SR (x) is homopolar and its unit cell possesses two lattice sites with no energy offset between them. In the deep lattice limit, this latter case maps to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, a non-interacting 1D tightbinding fermionic model with staggered (i.e., different intracell and intercell) hopping amplitudes [312]. The SSH model has two distinct dimerizations: i) the intracell hopping amplitude is larger than the intercell hopping amplitude, ii) the intracell hopping amplitude is smaller than the intercell hopping amplitude. In the former case, the system is a trivial insulator at half filling. Whereas in the latter case, the Bloch bands have a nontrivial topological structure, characterized by a non-zero bulk topological invariant-the winding number-and topologically protected edge states.where ∆ a± are the atomic detunings with respect to the two pump fields. Considering the dispersion relation of both spin states in presence of the SO coupling, one finds that the energy bands are displaced from one another due to the opposite momentum recoils and coupled via the Raman-Rabi term. This leads to a double-minima lowest energy-band structure and a band gap given by ΩSOC proportional to â † and â, shown schematically in Figure 52(e) and (f). The superradiant state displaying SO coupling corresponds in real space to an atomic spinor state that exhibits a helical pattern (i.e., spin spiral) along the pump axis according to |↓ ±e ikcy cos(k c x) |↑ . This state corresponds to the chiral spin-spiral phase in Figure 35(b) and Figure 36(a). The experimental observables of this state are the intra-cavity light field that rises to a finite value above threshold and the spin-selective occupation of momentum states according to the expectations described above; see Figure 53. The lifetime of the superradiant state is only on the order of a few milliseconds, most likely limited by a dephasing of the two pump beams. The landscape of the superradiant optical lattice depends crucially on the sign of U 0 ∝ ∆ -1 a = (ω pω a ) -1 as illustrated in Figure 5. The lattice potential V SR (x) is λ c periodic due to the interference term ∝ cos(k c x). For a conventional red-detuned pump laser (and cavity field) with respect to the relevant atomic transition U 0 ∝ ∆ -1 a &lt; 0, the superradiant lattice has a single global minimum in every unit cell of length λ c . More precisely, the unit cell contains two lattice sites with an energy offset between them.

        <p>At low pump strengths, the system is in the normal Fermi-gas state with no photon inside the cavity. By increasing the pump strength, the system becomes unstable toward the superradiant phase α = 0, where the Fermi gas crystallizes under the emergent superradiant potential V SR (x), Equation (104), in turn enhancing constructive photon scattering from the pump laser into the cavity mode. Across the superradiant phase transition, the relative phase of the cavity field with respect to the pump laser is locked at either 0 or π (under the assumption ∆ c κ), spontaneously breaking the Z 2 symmetry (i.e., the invariance under the transformation α → -α and x → x + λ c /2) of the system. That is, the system chooses spontaneously one of the two possible superradiant lattice configurations shifted by λ c /2 with respect to one another, corresponding to the two distinct dimerizations of the SSH model. The phase diagram of the system in the parameter space of the pump strength η 0 versus the Fermi momentum k F at a finite temperature is shown in Figure 54(a) [59]. The emergent lattice V SR (x) opens up gaps in the quadratic energy dispersion of the free Fermi gas across the superradiant phase transition. For atomic densities around half filling k F = k c /2, the superradiant state is an insulator, while for filling sufficiently away from half filling the system corresponds to a superradiant metal (SRM). The transition to the insulating state with a dimerized structure at half filling occurs through the same mechanism underlying the Peierls instability in 1D electron-phonon models [173]. Depending on the spontaneously chosen dimerization via the superradiant Z 2 symmetry breaking, the superradiant insulating state is either a trivial band insulator (SRBI) or a topological insulator (SRTI), characterized by the Zak phase. For this system the Zak phase is Z 2 quantized and serves as a topological invariant, with the value 0 (π) corresponding to the SRBI (SRTI). Remarkably, the value of the Zak phase coincides exactly with the relative phase of the cavity field with respect to the pump laser, providing a nondestructive way to read out the topological Zak phase via the leaked cavity field. Note that the superradiant phase terminates at large pump strengths, indicated by the gray area in the phase diagram of Figure 54(a); see also Figure 20 for a similar behavior in self-ordering of low-field-seeking bosonic atoms. We also note that the critical pump strength at half filling becomes infinitesimally small at zero temperature due to the Fermi nesting [140].At low pump strengths, the system is in the normal Fermi-gas state with no photon inside the cavity.

        <p>In the weakly interacting regime, the quasicrystal potential dominates over the twobody interactions. Consequently, the condensate localizes in one or few of deepest minima of the quasicrystal potential since the quasicrystal potential lacks a translation symmetry and can act as a disordered potential. In this superradiant localized (SRL) phase the atoms scatter more photons from the pump laser into the cavity modes [see Figure 56(b)] due to constructive interference: the more atoms are condensed in the same potential minimum, the more photons are scattered with the same phase. As the two-body contact interaction is increased, it is energetically more favorable for the atoms to occupy different global and local minima of the quasicrystal optical potential. For sufficiently strong two-body contact interactions, the system crosses over into an extended phase, where a quasicrystalline density order is stabilized in the system. The momentum distribution in this superradiant quasicrystalline (SRQC) phase exhibits a dense, fractal structure with an eightfold rotational symmetry, a characteristic of quasicrystalline order indicating that the two-dimensional momentum space is spanned by four incommensurate cavity wavevectors {k 1 , • • • , k 4 } [322]. We stress that the SRQC phase in this setup is a genuine many-body state as the two-body repulsive interaction between the atoms is necessary for its stabilization.In the weakly interacting regime, the quasicrystal potential dominates over the twobody interactions. Consequently, the condensate localizes in one or few of deepest minima of the quasicrystal potential since the quasicrystal potential lacks a translation symmetry and can act as a disordered potential. In this superradiant localized (SRL) phase the atoms scatter more photons from the pump laser into the cavity modes [see Figure 56(b)] due to constructive interference: the more atoms are condensed in the same potential minimum, the more photons are scattered with the same phase. As the two-body contact interaction is increased, it is energetically more favorable for the atoms to occupy different global and local minima of the quasicrystal optical potential. For sufficiently strong two-body contact interactions, the system crosses over into an extended phase, where a quasicrystalline density order is stabilized in the system.

        <p>In the preceding section, we discussed a scenario where a quasicrystalline superradiant optical potential with an eightfold rotational symmetry emerges for ultracold atoms coupled to four-crossed linear cavities, where the atoms in turn self-order in this emergent quasicrystalline potential. This proposal is an extension of the ETH Zurich group's two-crossed cavity setup (see Section 4.1). Other superradiant quasicrystalline optical potentials with different rotational symmetries can also be implemented by employing different cavity setups, although they might become progressively more challenging experimentally. However, they can provide a platform to study many fundamental open questions concerning the formation and nature of quasicrystals. For instance, it is still not completely clear whether quasicrystals are only entropy-stabilized hightemperature states or can also be thermodynamically stable at low temperatures. The conditions and nature of quasicrystal growth are also under debate with a lack of a generally accepted model. Further enriching the physics in cavity-based composite atom-light quasicrystals compared to solid-state quasicrystalline materials is the interplay between two-body contact and cavity-mediated long-range interactions, both tunable in principle.In the preceding section, we discussed a scenario where a quasicrystalline superradiant optical potential with an eightfold rotational symmetry emerges for ultracold atoms coupled to four-crossed linear cavities, where the atoms in turn self-order in this emergent quasicrystalline potential.

        <p>So far we mostly considered situations, where atomic and photonic degrees of freedom reach a steady state. In the present section we will instead discuss some interesting quantum-gas-cavity scenarios with non-steady states. In order to put the results presented in the following into the general context of quantum many-body dynamics, some remarks are in order. First and foremost, a hybrid atom-cavity setup is intrinsically an open quantum system due to the photon leakage out of the cavity. This means that the dynamics always leads to an attractor (which needs not to be unique), defined by the eigenvalue of the master equation ( 8) with vanishing real part, i.e., with only damping. This scenario has to be distinguished from the case of isolated systems, where the dynamics are classified in terms of ergodic versus non-ergodic behavior. In the context of quantum many-body systems, this characterization is still an active field of research, with the phenomenon of many-body localization being a prominent example [324].So far we mostly considered situations, where atomic and photonic degrees of freedom reach a steady state.

        <p>Besides being dissipative, the atom-cavity systems we consider are also driven, as external lasers in conjunction with cavity fields are used to generate the dispersive light-matter coupling discussed throughout this review. In this case, the long-time attractor does not necessarily need to be a steady state, even though the Liouville operator governing the dynamics has no explicit time dependence (in the frame rotating with the driving laser). This situation will be considered in Section 10.1, while the case of explicitly time-dependent Liouvillians will be discussed in Section 10.2. Some of the non-steady states discussed below can be classified, in a broader sense, as so-called time crystals. Such phases, which spontaneously break some time-translation symmetry and show robust periodic oscillations in time, have recently received considerable amount of attention, with examples from different physical platforms [325]. We will also encounter in the following non-steady phases which do not oscillate periodically in time but rather exhibit irregular behavior, similar to the ergodic dynamics of isolated systems. In the context of open quantum systems, the definition and characterization of ergodic or chaotic behavior is still an open issue, with very recent interesting developments [326][327][328][329][330][331][332][333].

        <p>A possible scenario through which stable non-steady attractors can emerge is via the competition between different steady attractors. This can be achieved in the simplest single-mode superradiant self-ordering scenario by driving the atoms with a laser bluedetuned with respect to the atomic resonance, ∆ a &gt; 0, as first pointed out in Ref. [63]. Blue-detuned laser fields lead to repulsive optical potentials but still allow for superradiant self-ordering in some limited parameter regimes, as discussed in Section 3.3.3. To better understand the phenomenon, instead of considering the two-dimensional configuration of that section, we re-examine here the simpler one-dimensional blue-detuned model introduced in Section 8.2.1, this time for bosonic atoms instead of fermionic atoms.A possible scenario through which stable non-steady attractors can emerge is via the competition between different steady attractors.

        <p>The phase diagram of this 1D system is shown in Figure 57(a). The competition which destabilizes the steady states can be immediately understood from Equation ( 104), expressing the optical potential felt by the atoms in the superradiant phase. For a laser which is blue detuned from the atomic transition, one has U 0 ∝ ∆ -1 a &gt; 0. This implies that the cos 2 (k c x) part of the potential pushes the atoms out of the self- ordered pattern induced by the cos(k c x) part, thereby favoring a homogenous density and thus the non-superradiant (normal) phase. At very small photon numbers, the cos(k c x) term dominates so that a steady-state superradiant phase is stabilized. However, for sufficiently strong pumps the cos 2 (k c x) term becomes equally important, so that the system cannot decide between the normal and the superradiant phases. This leads to self-sustained oscillations between these two states which are stabilized by the cavity loss. These limit-cycle oscillations are shown in the middle panel of Figure 57(b). By further increasing the pump strength the number of harmonics increases by the known mechanism of period doubling, eventually crossing over into irregular behavior exemplified in the lower panel of Figure 57(b). Within a (semi-)classical description of the system based on coupled nonlinear equations for the cavity coherent field and the BEC wavefunction (see Section 2.4.1) this irregular behavior can be associated with a chaotic attractor [334]. Indeed, the dissipative, i.e., non-Hamiltonian, nature of the equations of motion leads to the contraction of the phase-space volume to within a finite region. Still, within the attractor region the dynamics is chaotic, that is, it features at least one positive Lyapunov exponent.The phase diagram of this 1D system is shown in Figure 57(a).

        <p>What this classically known scenario implies for the full quantum state of the system is an open question. Differently from the closed-system case, the study of quantum dissipative chaos is still in its beginning and matter of active research [327,328,332,333,335]. It is thus also an open question whether this type of classical dynamics underlie some kind of ergodic or thermal-like behavior of our quantum many-body system. This is a matter of future research, for which the atom-cavity systems considered in this review article seem an ideal platform. From the point of view of the atoms, the chaotic attractor corresponds to a fast increase of the kinetic energy [63,189], which reaches a value much larger than that in the limit-cycle attractor. The chaotic attractor is thus characterized by a more effective redistribution, i.e., a behavior which is "more ergodic" than for the limit-cycle attractor. Still, the increase in the kinetic energy is counteracted by the cavity loss via the mechanism of cavity cooling, which eventually stops the heating [63].What this classically known scenario implies for the full quantum state of the system is an open question.

        <p>A further interesting aspect connected with the chaotic attractor is the phenomenon of phase slippage and related soliton nucleation in the BEC [63], as shown in Figure 57(c). This behavior is peculiar to superfluids excited out of equilibrium, whereby spatial gradients in the condensate phase are converted into localized excitations carrying a phase slip. In the present case the phase gradients are caused by the modulation of the cavity field and have a characteristic length scale fixed by λ c . On the other hand, the characteristic size of a soliton is set by the healing length, whose value (2M g 0 n) -1/2 depends on the interatomic repulsion and is set to 0.1λ c in Figure 57(c). The main contribution to the BEC kinetic energy can be attributed to soliton proliferation. The latter is counteracted by cavity cooling, in a situation which resembles turbulence. This interesting analogy should be further investigated in the future.A further interesting aspect connected with the chaotic attractor is the phenomenon of phase slippage and related soliton nucleation in the BEC [63], as shown in Figure 57(c).

The phase diagram for the one-dimensional case is shown in Figure 58(a). A non-mean-field, steady-state phase peculiar to this blue-detuned case is found. In this so-called self-organized secondorder superfluid phase, the phase coherence is limited to within each double well, i.e., the unit cell of the dimerized superradiant lattice. Within this beyond-mean-field description a limit-cycle phase is also identified, with the only difference with respect to the mean-field version discussed above being the quasi-periodic nature of the oscillations, which has been attributed to the combination of the external trap and the short-range atomic repulsion [189]. The chaotic attractor is also present within this beyond-mean-field description, indicating that this phenomenon is not an artifact of the (semi-)classical description. This opens the interesting perspective for further investigating of this type of chaotic phases in a fully quantum setting.Hartree method for indistinguishable particles (MCTDH-X) [189], as well as to include the effect of harmonic trapping of the atomic cloud.

        <p>Further insight into the limit-cycle phase and its relation to time crystals is provided by the analysis of the temporal coherence presented in Figure 59. These results [67] are obtained using the truncated Wigner approximation, which goes beyond the meanfield approximation by including the noise induced by cavity loss [see Equation (10)], as well as the quantum noise in the initial state. In Ref. [67], the latter has been included by occupying low-lying BEC and cavity modes with vacuum fluctuations. Observables are then computed by averaging over a set of stochastically-generated trajectories. Even in the presence of these forms of noise, the temporal coherence of the limit-cycle phase is clearly visible in Figure 59(a) as finite-amplitude harmonic oscillations in the quantity C(t) = α * (t)α(t 1 ) , where the averaging is performed over an ensemble of trajectories. The emergence of temporal coherence in the limit-cycle phase is a characteristic of time crystals. On the contrary, the chaotic phase does not show appreciable temporal coherence. The amplitude of the oscillations of temporal coherence is shown in Figure 59(b) as a function of the ramping of the pump strength from the self-organized steady-state phase, across the limit-cycle phase over to the chaotic phase.Further insight into the limit-cycle phase and its relation to time crystals is provided by the analysis of the temporal coherence presented in Figure 59.

Another possible explanation is the large value of the cavity loss rate in the experiment, reducing the size of the limit-cycle region in the phase diagram.

        <p>A non-zero cavity-field dissipation rate κ leads to a phase shift φ κ = tan -1 (-κ/δ c ) of the light field scattered from the pump field into the cavity mode. As a consequence, a pure density modulation, for instance, thus leads to an occupation of both the real and the imaginary quadratures of the cavity field. The light field in the imaginary quadrature then drives self-organization of the spin mode. This process exerts an effective force onto the system and triggers an instability constantly driving it between density and spin modulation already far below the threshold for self-organization. In the experiment, this was observed via a constantly evolving phase of the intra-cavity light field and the associated emergence of sidebands in the spectrum of the cavity field; see Figure 60.A non-zero cavity-field dissipation rate κ leads to a phase shift φ κ = tan -1 (-κ/δ c ) of the light field scattered from the pump field into the cavity mode.

This behavior is well known for systems described by non-Hermitian matrices such as Equation (108). After the instability has been induced, the two eigenmodes of the system synchronize and oscillate at a mean frequency. It was shown that the dissipative processes in the system generate a nonreciprocal coupling between the two collective spins that eventually induces this instability in a certain parameter regime, shown in Figure 61(a). Going beyond adiabatic elimination of the cavity field, it was though shown that the instability should occur in the long-time limit for basically all parameters due to additional anti-damping from the cavity field fluctuations. In the bad-cavity limit that applies to the experiment, the instability is, however, confined to a finite parameter region [336].An analysis of the eigenspectrum reveals that the emergence of this dynamical instability is connected to the presence of exceptional points with the according level attraction as shown in Figure 61(b).

        <p>An analysis studying the full quantum model of this system confirmed that the inclusion of cavity field fluctuations renders the system unstable indeed also in regions where the mean-field model predicts stability [337]. Using the framework of Lindblad master equation, the eigenspectrum of the system was studied. The interpretation was that the presence of equally spaced imaginary parts of the eigenvalues prevents a dephasing of the dynamics and thus leads to a long-time non-steady-state dynamics. This can be contrasted to steady-state situations, where the eigenfrequencies are dense and incommensurate and thus lead to dephasing as it would be the case for a closed system. An analysis of the correlation functions of the system revealed indications of beyond mean-field behavior such as entanglement induced by dissipation. The described behavior can be connected to dissipative time crystals breaking a continuous symmetry, where the description in a rotating frame is given by a time-independent master equation [337].An analysis studying the full quantum model of this system confirmed that the inclusion of cavity field fluctuations renders the system unstable indeed also in regions where the mean-field model predicts stability [337].

Non-steady-state phases with time-dependent driving Non-trivial dynamics without reaching a steady state can also be induced by applying a time-dependent transverse pump lattice, modulated either in amplitude or in phase; see Figure 62(a). Restricting the discussion to the self-organization of the atomic density in the low energy sector, the modulation results in a Dicke model with an explicitly time-dependent coupling rate, even in the frame rotating with the natural pump frequency.10.2.

        <p>First investigations of a parametrically driven Dicke model showed that additional minima in the energy landscape of the system appear already for infinitesimally small modulation if the modulation frequency is close to an eigenfrequency of the undriven system [47]. For strong enough modulation, the predicted phase diagram features metastable phases and according nonequilibrium first-order phase transitions. Including dissipation both via the cavity and via the atoms stabilizes the system against the instability seen on resonance for the closed system, such that a finite modulation strength is required to enter the non-steady-state phases [338]. This work also investigated possible trajectories of the Bloch vector in the non-steady-state phases. Examples of such trajectories are shown in Figure 62(b). For non-steady states in the so-called "dynamical normal phase", the phase of the cavity field rotates in more or less complicated trajectories and the field amplitude averages to zero. For the atomic degree of freedom this corresponds to a quasi-resonant switching between the two ordered density patterns allowed by the Z 2 symmetry. Likewise, the superradiant phase displays oscillations, however, around a mean non-zero photon number. The simulations also showed the existence of chaotic behavior: While the normal and the self-organized phases seem to be robust against parametric heating also in presence of the modulated drive, the above introduced dynamical normal phase shows ergodic-like behavior similar to the one characterizing the chaotic phases discussed in Section 10.1. Numerical simulations also taking into account atomic collisional interactions and a trapping potential confirm the existence of the parametrically driven phases [339].First investigations of a parametrically driven Dicke model showed that additional minima in the energy landscape of the system appear already for infinitesimally small modulation if the modulation frequency is close to an eigenfrequency of the undriven system [47].

        <p>The response of a BEC to a modulated field in the case of a cavity in the sidebandresolved limit has been numerically studied using an open system truncated Wigner approximation [66]. Also in this work, the pump field amplitude was assumed to be modulated periodically. In presence of this modulation, which effectively imprints two sidebands at the modulation frequency onto the pump field, the system was found to either relax to a steady state or enter dynamical states. Depending on the modulation frequency, density waves involving different higher atomic momentum modes with multiple recoils being transferred along the pump or the cavity direction can be excited.The response of a BEC to a modulated field in the case of a cavity in the sidebandresolved limit has been numerically studied using an open system truncated Wigner approximation [66].

        <p>Another theoretical proposal for a periodically driven atom-cavity system is based on a phase modulated rather than an amplitude modulated pump field [340]. Such a phase modulation results in a periodically shaken optical pump lattice which the atoms are exposed to. This configuration is expected to lead to self-organization in specific density waves, depending on the modulation frequency. Different to the case of an amplitude modulated pump field, here the atoms can also order in a state with density maxima at the nodes of the emergent superradiant optical lattice, dynamically switching between the symmetry broken states. The induced oscillations can have a very low frequency, set by the beating between the mode eigenfrequency and the modulation frequency. This beating leads to a subharmonic response also at incommensurate frequency ratios, and has been interpreted as incommensurate time crystal. Periodic phase modulation of the cavity-induced optical lattice can also modify the properties of the superradiant phase transition. For instance, periodic phase modulation of a cavity field has been predicted to yield a first-order superradiant phase transition with a hysteresis loop, provided the modulation frequency is chosen appropriately and the bosonic gas is sufficiently-weakly interacting [341]. The periodic phase modulation of a cavity field can also result in cavity-assisted long-range hoppings for fermionic atoms in an external lattice inside the cavity, leading to topological superradiant states [342].Another theoretical proposal for a periodically driven atom-cavity system is based on a phase modulated rather than an amplitude modulated pump field [340].

        <p>The first experimental realization of a modulated atom-cavity system employed the beating between two different pump-field frequencies [343]. One field is red detuned with respect to the cavity resonance and drives the self-organization phase transition in the system for sufficiently strong amplitudes. The amplitude of the second pump field is increased from zero only after self-organization has set in. The frequency of this second field is closer to, and blue detuned with respect to the cavity resonance, such that it counteracts atomic self-organization. Indeed, a suppression of the selforganized density-wave state was observed with increasing amplitude of the second pump field. This behavior was present for a wide range of modulation frequencies. It was argued [66,343] that this mechanism of suppressing the self-organized density wave and enhancing atomic coherence in this setup bears analogy with light-induced restoration of superconductivity in hight-T c cuprates. From dynamical point of view, this suppression of the self-organization can be understood from (reduced) rescaling of the atom-field coupling η 0 in the corresponding time-independent effective Magnus Hamiltonian [66]. Accordingly, the self-organization threshold is pushed to stronger atom-field couplings. Resonant features as reported in Ref. [338] were not observed employing this scheme, except for rapid excitations if the modulation frequency hit multiples of the vibrational frequency of the pump lattice. When an amplitude modulation was implemented experimentally by imprinting instead two sidebands onto the pump field as suggested in Ref. [66], a resonant feature was observed in addition to the suppression of superradiance described above [344]. The experimental scheme and observations are displayed in Figure 63. The pump intensity is modulated at a frequency ω d according to V (t) = V 0 [1 + f 0 cos(ω d t)], which imprints frequency sidebands at ω p± = ω p ± ω d . The higher frequency sideband is close to and blue detuned with respect to the dispersively-shifted cavity resonance. Operating in the sideband-resolved regime is important to select specific atomic excitations [345]: In a certain range of modulation frequencies ω d , a different set of momentum states is occupied than for usual self-organization induced by an unmodulated pump field. For the given parameters, this state corresponds to a transfer of three recoil momenta along the pump axis and one recoil momentum along the cavity axis. Such resonant occupation of specific momentum states, corresponding to a nonequilibrium density wave, has also been theoretically predicted (see above) if the modulation frequency is close to multiples of the atomic momentum-excitation energy [66,344]. Interestingly, the observed density wave is a subradiant non-steady state where the cavity occupation is suppressed while higher order momentum states are occupied. As shown in Figure 63(b), the cavity field decays rapidly once the amplitude modulation is switched on. At the end of the sequence absorption images are taken after ballistic expansion; examples are displayed in Figures 63(d)-(f). Away from the resonance, momentum peaks signaling standard self-organization are observed, while on resonance the occupation of higher momentum states is visible.The first experimental realization of a modulated atom-cavity system employed the beating between two different pump-field frequencies [343].

        <p>In the previous sections we demonstrated that ultracold quantum gases trapped together with light within high-Q optical cavities constitute an incredibly rich field of modern AMO physics with growing connections and application prospects towards solid-state physics. In many respects the specific quantum properties or quantum fluctuations of driving laser light fields and cavity modes can be neglected and a meanfield description in terms of coherent fields yields a valid and reliable description (see Section 2.4 for more details). However, from a wider perspective quantum-gas cavity QED, i.e., the combination of cavity quantum electrodynamics with ultracold quantum gas physics, goes well beyond the mean-field picture of the coherent cavity-field mode evolution. In its full blossom the field can address and study novel phenomena, where the quantum statistical nature of both light and ultracold matter play equally important roles. While the light fields create forces and dynamical potentials with quantum properties, the atoms constitute a dynamical refractive index with genuine quantum properties as well.

        <p>Beyond the mean-field approximation, a quantum description of the electromagnetic modes allows for dynamic field-matter entanglement beyond classical correlations. Hence, a quantized cavity mode can still induce forces and long-range interaction via photons even for zero average field-mode amplitude. Consequently, this opens a completely new venue for projective measurement-based preparation of special manybody states. In particular, a wide class of emerging atomic states can be probabilistically prepared via the choice of optical geometry.

        <p>As we generally deal with open systems with respect to the cavity-field dynamics, the output light continuously provides information about the intrinsic dynamics with minimal perturbation [347]; see Figure 64. Ultimately it can serve as a quantum non-demolition (QND) probe of the spatial distribution, phase diagram, or the phase-transition dynamics of the ultracold quantum gas. As an example, a Mottinsulator state in an optical lattice inside a cavity exhibits clearly distinct light scattering properties compared to a superfluid state. In this way the corresponding phase transition between the two states can be directly monitored from angle resolved scat- tering [84,347] or cavity transmission measurements [348] as shown in Figure 65. The QND detection of the Bose-glass phase [131,349] and few-body complexes of polar molecules [350] were suggested as well. In addition to being able to monitor nondestructively the orbital state (i.e., Mott insulator or superfluid) of one-component atoms in an optical lattice inside a cavity through cavity output fields, it is also feasible to probe non-destructively the spinorial state of multi-component atoms through cavity transmission spectrum. This provides a novel approach for non-destructive detection of various magnetic orders in quantum gases [351]. The QND property also allows for intriguing and promising applications for quantum enhanced sensing as in, e.g., a supersolid-based accelerometer in a ring cavity [90]; see Section 11.3 for more details.As we generally deal with open systems with respect to the cavity-field dynamics, the output light continuously provides information about the intrinsic dynamics with minimal perturbation [347]; see Figure 64.

        <p>From a fundamental physics point of view such systems allow detailed studies of quantum measurement theory for many-body quantum systems ranging from the quantum Zeno effect [352,353] to quantum measurement-induced ordering [95]. Implementing weak measurement schemes on the field modes even allows controlled steering of the atom-field quantum evolution [354], and generation and observation of multipartite entanglement via nonlocal cavity-enhanced measurements [93]. The generation of squeezed light has also been suggested [355]. As one might expect the genuine quantum nature of measurement back-action also allows to generate dynamics beyond the mean-field level. For fermions theoretical models show the appearance of measurement-induced antiferromagnetic order [95] as well as the appearance of manybody localization effects [74]. By trapping atoms inside an optical cavity, one creates optical potentials and forces, which are not externally prescribed but are quantum dynamical variables themselves. Ultimately, cavity QED with quantum gases requires a self-consistent solution for light and particles, which enriches the picture of quantum many-body states of atoms trapped in quantum potentials. A proper quantum treatment of interaction and back-action turns out to be particularly important to implement quantum simulations or to exploit quantum-enhanced optimization using cavity-mediated tailored and externally controlled interactions [28].

        <p>One can make use of the continuously measured output-field properties for a feedback on the coupled atom-field system. Applying weak measurements and feedback to a quantum system induces phase transitions driven by fundamental quantum fluctuations due to measurements. Non-Markovianity and nonlinearity of feedback enables simulating special spin-bath problems and Floquet time crystals with long-range and memory time interactions [94,356]. As an example we show in Figure 66 the simulation of quantum trajectories for a continuous measurement on an ultracold gas in a lattice with continuous monitoring of the cavity outputs [357]. The interplay between measurement projection and nonlinear dynamics creates an intriguing dynamical pattern for the atom number distribution on even or odd sites along the cavity axis. Classical feedback derived from the output of a cavity field has been experimentally demonstrated [358]. A BEC trapped inside a linear cavity was brought to selforganization by applying a transverse pump field. Using the field leaking out from the cavity as a signal, the intensity of the transverse pump laser was regulated by an electronic circuit such that the mean intra-cavity photon number was stabilized to a given value. While this photon number decreases without feedback due to atom losses, applying the feedback scheme allowed to stabilize the system over multiple seconds.One can make use of the continuously measured output-field properties for a feedback on the coupled atom-field system.

        <p>Starting from a short historical overview and an introduction of the basic underlying physical models and mechanisms, the central goal of this review has been to present the state of the art in the field of quantum-gas-cavity QED (QG-CQED). As some comprehensive and nice reviews on the classical gas aspects [114], simple cavity-lattice models [50], and the early quantum-gas developments [96] already exist, for the sake of compactness here we concentrated on more recent important developments and outstanding achievements in the field. Nevertheless, the overwhelming recent growth in theory and experiment has rendered the goal of being comprehensive, detailed enough, and complete rather futile. Even well exceeding the initially planned length of about 100 pages did not allow us to include everything, which would deserve to be mentioned here in sufficient detail. Even while writing this review article intriguing new developments continuously surfaced, we finally had to strongly restrict ourselves and leave some of the most recent developments for future reviews. Hence, we here have to apologize for some important omissions. Nevertheless, we hope that on the one hand this review gives a good and solid starting point to new researchers interested in entering the field, and on the other hand fosters new and closer collaborations among the existing diverse community. Let us wrap things up shortly here: starting from early theoretical ideas and abstract proposals somewhat in the style of Gedankenexperiments at the turn of the century [366][367][368], the field of QG-CQED has enormously grown and expanded in various directions. First aims were driven by theoretical visions of cavity-induced ground-state cooling towards implementing a continuous BEC and a continuous-wave atom lasers [369,370], or creating macroscopic superposition states of larger particle numbers [44]. Nevertheless, it soon became clear that using a simpler implementation starting from a zero-temperature degenerate quantum gas prepared by conventional means within an optical cavity, one already realizes a very versatile and well controllable test ground for many-body physics in an extreme quantum limit. Here cavityinduced thermalization limits the available measurement time, but this process is in many cases slow enough such that it does not hinder typical experimental sequences. As a particular example, it proved straightforward to emulate a wide class of optomechanical Hamiltonians at zero temperature [33,35,38], a goal far out of reach of other optomechanical systems at that time [371].Starting from a short historical overview and an introduction of the basic underlying physical models and mechanisms, the central goal of this review has been to present the state of the art in the field of quantum-gas-cavity QED (QG-CQED). As some comprehensive and nice reviews on the classical gas aspects [114], simple cavity-lattice models [50], and the early quantum-gas developments [96] already exist, for the sake of compactness here we concentrated on more recent important developments and outstanding achievements in the field. Nevertheless, the overwhelming recent growth in theory and experiment has rendered the goal of being comprehensive, detailed enough, and complete rather futile. Even well exceeding the initially planned length of about 100 pages did not allow us to include everything, which would deserve to be mentioned here in sufficient detail. Even while writing this review article intriguing new developments continuously surfaced, we finally had to strongly restrict ourselves and leave some of the most recent developments for future reviews. Hence, we here have to apologize for some important omissions. Nevertheless, we hope that on the one hand this review gives a good and solid starting point to new researchers interested in entering the field, and on the other hand fosters new and closer collaborations among the existing diverse community.

        <p>Almost a decade after theoretical suggestions, a series of cutting edge foundational experiments trapping a BEC within a cavity mode has been implemented in Zürich [372], Tübingen [37], Berkeley [33], and Paris [34]. These allowed transforming Gedankenexperiments into real setups in laboratories and thus sparked a great deal of interest well beyond the ultracold-atom community, in particular, in the solid-state and quantum-information communities. The subsequent multitude of theoretical models, predictions, and suggested applications initiated another wave of experimental efforts, encompassing BECs in recoil-resolved linear and ring cavities [102,155], in multi-mode cavities [153], in crossed linear cavities [58], and in folded ring cavities [373], as well as most recently also of degenerate Fermi gases coupled to a linear cavity [61].Almost a decade after theoretical suggestions, a series of cutting edge foundational experiments trapping a BEC within a cavity mode has been implemented in Zürich [372], Tübingen [37], Berkeley [33], and Paris [34].

        <p>A second decisive boost to the field came from the discovery that cavity-mediated global interactions can induce self-ordering of trapped atomic clouds [31,106]. Most interestingly, in the zero-temperature regime this corresponds to a reversible quantum phase transition. In a seminal experiment, this self-ordering phase transition was explored in real time [39]. Even more interestingly, a direct mapping of the corresponding Hamiltonian to the Dicke model allowed to confirm an almost 50-year-old prediction of the Dicke superradiant phase transition [39,41], a prediction that was controversially disputed in literature for decades with its actual direct realization being still disputed and sought for in solid-state platforms [157,158]. Nevertheless, this proof-of-principle demonstration highlighted the remarkable possibilities for QG-CQED as a versatile platform for quantum simulation of many-body Hamiltonians with all-to-all interactions. With these possibilities at hand a new wave of theoretical work was triggered.A second decisive boost to the field came from the discovery that cavity-mediated global interactions can induce self-ordering of trapped atomic clouds [31,106].

        <p>With the subsequent extension and refinement of experimental apparatus, experiments went well beyond the existing theoretical capabilities. Soon it became clear that existing 1D mean-field models, which allow quite general understanding of the emerging physical phenomena, could not adequately account for all observations. This became particularly obvious for the case of 3D intra-cavity lattices or setups with several cavity modes dynamically involved [49,269]. As a notable example, the clear experimental observation of signatures of a lattice-supersolid phase required new theoretical approaches such as dynamical mean-field theories [54], Keldysh-type approaches [79], or multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree methods [166]. As experiments become more complex but also more precise, these theoretical efforts strongly grow in various directions such as, e.g., a thrust to make use of powerful DMRG methods [133], which turns out to be rather delicate due to the competition of local and cavity-mediated global interactions.With the subsequent extension and refinement of experimental apparatus, experiments went well beyond the existing theoretical capabilities.

        <p>In a next phase theory and experiments pushed the field ahead further by exploiting Zeeman sub-levels of atomic ground-state manifolds which added an additional spin degree of freedom to the dynamics and paved the way for exploring emergent magnetic orders in real time [68][69][70][71]. Here the dynamical nature of the cavity fields allowed to extend models for synthetic gauge fields to the dynamical regime [72] previously inaccessible in free-space configuration. New realms of physics also became accessible by introducing repulsive optical potentials in the blue-detuned regime allowing to emulate a nonequilibrium form of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model [59] as well as entering the domain of nonlinear dynamical instabilities, deterministic chaos, and a new arising area of time-crystal formation [63,65]. Using complex resonator geometries even allowed to study quasicrystal formation beyond naturally existing crystal symmetries [322].In a next phase theory and experiments pushed the field ahead further by exploiting Zeeman sub-levels of atomic ground-state manifolds which added an additional spin degree of freedom to the dynamics and paved the way for exploring emergent magnetic orders in real time [68][69][70][71].

        <p>Beyond studying fundamental aspects of quantum physics, the application perspective of QG-CQED has been theoretically discussed already since the early stage of the field as the extreme sensitivity of the systems to external perturbations and the real-time observation capabilities hint for high measurement precision and accuracy. In this context several new proposals for acceleration, force, and magnetic-field sensors have recently been put forward [90,92] and are currently refined. In a parallel development the large versatility of cavity-induced interactions, i.e., in principle almost arbitrary forms of all-to-all couplings, allowed to envisage novel types of quantum simulators [97,109] or annealers [28,99]. In some special cases it could be shown that these implementations, which typically require a number of laser frequencies, only require a minimal q-bit overhead so that implementations beyond the capabilities of classical computers are within reach of current experimental technology [48]. Recently, in an another direction QG-CQED-based setups for active atomic clocks in the form of so-called superradiant lasers were theoretically proposed [374,375] and many efforts started for their experimental implementation and technical refinement [376,377]. Here the cavity-induced all-to-all coupling among clock atoms is centrally responsible for the synchronization of the atomic dipoles at very low photon numbers in the spirit of the successful micro-maser-based clock devices.Beyond studying fundamental aspects of quantum physics, the application perspective of QG-CQED has been theoretically discussed already since the early stage of the field as the extreme sensitivity of the systems to external perturbations and the real-time observation capabilities hint for high measurement precision and accuracy.

        <p>Let us also mention that cavity QED with quantum matter recently became possible also in solid-state platforms [278,279,281,[378][379][380][381][382][383][384][385][386], potentially attracting the interest of an even larger community. Those platforms partially differ from their ultracoldatomic counterparts both in terms of models and parameter regimes. Nevertheless, a large number of phenomenological features are still common, so that we believe that this review article should be useful also for readers interested in solid-state many-body cavity QED.Let us also mention that cavity QED with quantum matter recently became possible also in solid-state platforms [278,279,281,[378][379][380][381][382][383][384][385][386], potentially attracting the interest of an even larger community.

        <p>Although it is very difficult to make predictions about future directions, we finally point out some recent promising developments and comment on a possible road map. As a recent central advancement, first cavity-QED experiments with fermionic atoms have recently been presented [61]. This will bring the field even closer to emulate genuine solid-state Hamiltonians and condensed-matter phenomena, such as momentum-space pairing in high-T c superconductors [130,229,277]. With more and more quantum-gas species trapped within resonators, one can also envisage multispecies configurations soon [73], which will pave the way to molecule formation via dark-state-induced collective photoassociation [387] and subsequently superradiant quantum chemistry [388]. Important new possibilities will arise from more complex resonator geometries covering two and three dimensions, as already demonstrated in 2D [58], and by the help of higher-order transverse modes [153]. Similarly, the whole manifold of longitudinal modes available in any optical resonator opens the possibility to emulate inter-particle forces of virtually arbitrary form. Here the natural frequencyperiodic identical nature of cavity and frequency-comb spectra can certainly help to reduce the complexity of corresponding setups [29]. In addition, the combination of high-resolution optical access with QG-CQED experiments may make new schemes possible for the shaping of cavity-induced interactions, but also for the simultane-ous preparation of multiple atomic systems, or for the in-situ imaging of self-ordered atomic structures. Finally, the open system physics of non-steady states and in particular dynamic periodic solutions of many-body systems, often called "time crystals," has drawn strongly increased recent attention. Here the nonlinear nature of the coupled atom-field dynamics and real-time observation capabilities of the cavity fields together with the excellent control over the system make QG-CQED setups a prime candidate for corresponding experimental studies and tests [67,346].Although it is very difficult to make predictions about future directions, we finally point out some recent promising developments and comment on a possible road map.

        <p>As the name suggest, the spin-orbit (SO) coupling refers to the coupling between the spin and the (linear or angular) momentum of a particle and it is a relativistic effect. A charged particle moving with velocity v in an electric field E experiences a magnetic field B = E × v/c 2 in its own rest frame according to the Lorentz transformation up to the first order in (v/c) 2 (with c being the speed of the light). Consequently, the magnetic moment μ of the particle proportional to its charge q and its spin ŝ couples to this magnetic field ĤSO =μ • B ∝ qŝ • (E × p), resulting in the SO coupling. Depending on the spatial form of the electric field, different forms of SO coupling can arise. Such a coupling between the spin and the external degree of freedom is absent for an atom, as atoms are charge neutral. The SO coupling can be simulated for neutral atoms via different methods such as dressing the atoms by laser lights, where in the simplest case two atomic (ground) pseudospin states are needed to encode a spin-1/2 degree of freedom. As for the simulation of synthetic dynamical magnetic fields for the atoms using cavity fields described in Section 8.1.1, dynamical SO coupling can also be engineered for neutral atoms based on cavity fields.
