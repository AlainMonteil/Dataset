        <p>Ferromagnetic topological insulators exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effect that might be used for high precision metrology and edge channel spintronics. In conjunction with superconductors, they could host chiral Majorana zero modes which are among the contenders for the realization of topological qubits.

        <p>Here, we show that p-type MnSb 2 Te 4 , previously considered topologically trivial, is a ferromagnetic topological insulator in the case of a few percent of Mn excess. It shows (i) a ferromagnetic hysteresis with record high Curie temperature of 45-50 K, (ii) out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy and (iii) a two-dimensional Dirac cone with the Dirac point close to the Fermi level which features (iv) out-of-plane spin polarization as revealed by photoelectron spectroscopy and (v) a magnetically induced band gap that closes at the Curie temperature as demonstrated by scanning tunneling spectroscopy. Moreover, it displays (vi) a critical exponent of magnetization β ∼ 1, indicating the vicinity of a quantum critical point. Ab initio band structure calculations reveal that the slight excess of Mn that substitutionally replaces Sb atoms provides the ferromagnetic interlayer coupling. Remaining deviations from the ferromagnetic order, likely related to this substitution, open the inverted bulk band gap and render MnSb 2 Te 4 a robust topological insulator and new benchmark for magnetic topological insulators.Here, we show that p-type MnSb 2 Te 4 , previously considered topologically trivial, is a ferromagnetic topological insulator in the case of a few percent of Mn excess.

        <p>The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) offers quantized conductance and lossless transport without the need for an external magnetic field [1]. The idea to combine ferromagnetism with topological insulators for this purpose [2][3][4] has fuelled the materials science [5]. It led to the experimental discovery of the QAHE in Cr-and V-doped (Bi, Sb) 2 Te 3 [6][7][8][9][10] with precise quantized values of the Hall resistivity down to the sub-part-per-million level [11][12][13][14]. The stable 3+ configuration of V or Cr substitutes the isoelectronic Bi or Sb [3,15,16] enabling ferromagnetism by coupling the magnetic moments of the transition metal atoms. Hence, time-reversal symmetry is broken enabling, through perpendicular magnetization, a gap opening at the Dirac point of the topological surface state [2][3][4][5]. This gap hosts chiral edge states with precisely quantized conductivity. However, the experimental temperatures featuring the QAHE are between 30 mK [6,12] and a few K [17,18] only, significantly lower than the ferromagnetic transition temperatures T C in these systems [19].The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) offers quantized conductance and lossless transport without the need for an external magnetic field [1].

        <p>Most elegantly, this has been realized for Mn doped Bi 2 Te 3 and Bi 2 Se 3 . The tendency of Mn to substitute Bi is weak, such that Mn doping leads to the spontaneous formation of septuple layers with MnBi 2 Te 4 stoichiometry. These septuple layers are statistically distributed among quintuple layers of pure Bi 2 Te 3 or Bi 2 Se 3 at low Mn concentration [24,25] and increase in number with increasing Mn concentration [24]. Eventually, only septuple layers remain when the overall stoichiometry of MnBi 2 Te 4 or MnBi 2 Se 4 [25,26] is reached.Most elegantly, this has been realized for Mn doped Bi 2 Te 3 and Bi 2 Se 3 .

        <p>Density functional theory (DFT) calculations found that MnBi 2 Te 4 forms ferromagnetic layers with antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling [27,28] as confirmed by experiments at low temperatures [28][29][30][31]. As a result, MnBi 2 Te 4 is an antiferromagnetic topological insulator [28,[32][33][34][35] that can exhibit axion states [5]. The QAHE, however, has only been realized in a limited way: ultra thin flakes consisting of odd numbers of septuple layers exhibited an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that is nearly quantized. This is caused by the uncompensated ferromagnetic septuple layer without partner. Nevertheless, exact quantization still required a magnetic field [36]. A ferromagnetic AHE has also been observed for systems with either a larger amount of quintuple layers [37][38][39] or via alloying of Sb and Bi in Mn(Bi 2-x Sb x ) 2 Te 4 [30,31,40] or both [41,42].

        <p>The XRD and RBS data imply a Mn-Sb site exchange. One possibility is to exchange the Mn from the central layer with Sb from the adjacent cation layers. Here, DFT calculations demonstrate that already 2.5 % of Mn on the Sb sites, respectively, 5 % of Mn replacement by Sb in the central layer, is sufficient to swap the sign of the interlayer exchange constant (Supplement: Table III). This renders MnSb 2 Te 4 ferromagnetic at a site exchange that agrees well with both the XRD analysis and the density of subsurface defects observed by STM (Figure 1b). A similar site exchange was recently observed for single crystals of bulk MnSb 2 Te 4 [46,47,50] and MnSb 1.88 Bi 0.02 Te 4 [31]. This corroborates that the Mn-Sb site exchange is easily enabled. Thus, it is conjectured that MnSb 2 Te 4 single crystals remain antiferromagnetic [31] only for negligible Sb-Mn intermixing. However, the modelled Mn-Sb site exchange barely increases the transition temperature (T N = 18 K → T C = 25 K (Supplement: Table III). Instead, 5% excess Mn incorporated substitutionally in the Sb layers without removing it from the central layer leads to T C = 44 K (Supplement: Supplement: Figure 9) to tune the electron wave number perpendicular to the surface, k z , once through the whole bulk Brillouin zone (Supplement: Table II), reveals no dispersion evidencing the 2D character of the Dirac cone. This is contrary to the lower-lying 3D bulk bands that strongly disperse with photon energy (Figure 2f, arrows). Spin-resolved ARPES of the 2D Dirac cone showcases a helical in-plane spin texture when probed away from the Γ zone center, i.e., it exhibits the characteristic reversal of spin orientation with the sign of k (Figure 2g,i, Supplement: Figure 8). This spin chirality is a key signature of a topological surface state. In addition, a pronounced out-of-plane spin polarization (about 25 %) occurs at the Γ zone center in the vicinity of E F in the remanently magnetized sample and reverses sign when the sample is remanently magnetized in the opposite direction (Figure 2j). Such out-of-plane spin texture at Γ is evidence for a magnetic gap opening at the Dirac point [63].The XRD and RBS data imply a Mn-Sb site exchange. One possibility is to exchange the Mn from the central layer with Sb from the adjacent cation layers. Here, DFT calculations demonstrate that already 2.5 % of Mn on the Sb sites, respectively, 5 % of Mn replacement by Sb in the central layer, is sufficient to swap the sign of the interlayer exchange constant (Supplement: Table III). This renders MnSb 2 Te 4 ferromagnetic at a site exchange that agrees well with both the XRD analysis and the density of subsurface defects observed by STM (Figure 1b). A similar site exchange was recently observed for single crystals of bulk MnSb 2 Te 4 [46,47,50] and MnSb 1.88 Bi 0.02 Te 4 [31]. This corroborates that the Mn-Sb site exchange is easily enabled. Thus, it is conjectured that MnSb 2 Te 4 single crystals remain antiferromagnetic [31] only for negligible Sb-Mn intermixing. However, the modelled Mn-Sb site exchange barely increases the transition temperature (T N = 18 K → T C = 25 K (Supplement: Table III). Instead, 5% excess Mn incorporated substitutionally in the Sb layers without removing it from the central layer leads to T C = 44 K (Supplement: Supplement: Figure 9) to tune the electron wave number perpendicular to the surface, k z , once through the whole bulk Brillouin zone (Supplement: Table II), reveals no dispersion evidencing the 2D character of the Dirac cone. This is contrary to the lower-lying 3D bulk bands that strongly disperse with photon energy (Figure 2f, arrows). Spin-resolved ARPES of the 2D Dirac cone showcases a helical in-plane spin texture when probed away from the Γ zone center, i.e., it exhibits the characteristic reversal of spin orientation with the sign of k (Figure 2g,i, Supplement: Figure 8). This spin chirality is a key signature of a topological surface state. In addition, a pronounced out-of-plane spin polarization (about 25 %) occurs at the Γ zone center in the vicinity of E F in the remanently magnetized sample and reverses sign when the sample is remanently magnetized in the opposite direction (Figure 2j). Such out-of-plane spin texture at Γ is evidence for a magnetic gap opening at the Dirac point [63].</p>
        <p>Combined, the ARPES results demonstrate that MnSb 2 Te 4 is a ferromagnetic topological insulator with clear fingerprints of a magnetic gap at Γ. Favorably, the Dirac point of the topological surface state is rather close to E F . Extrapolation of the observed linear bands, deduced by Lorentzian peak fitting (Figure 2d,h) yields a position of the Dirac point E D of only 20 ± 7 meV above E F at 300 K (Supplementary Section VIII).Combined, the ARPES results demonstrate that MnSb 2 Te 4 is a ferromagnetic topological insulator with clear fingerprints of a magnetic gap at Γ.

Figure 3a shows a topography image (height signal in STM) of the MnSb 2 Te 4 epilayer together with six STS spectra recorded at 4.3 K at different locations of the surface. All spectra consistently reveal a gap at E F varying, however, significantly in size. Attributing the energy region of dI/dV ≈ 0 as gap (Supplementary Section IX), a detailed map of the gap size ∆ results that covers a larger surface region (Figure 3b) [64,65].

        <p>To prove that the energy gap is of magnetic origin [24], the temperature dependence ∆(T ) is probed by STS. This has not been accomplished yet for any magnetic topological insulator because at higher temperatures k B T ≥ ∆/5 the STS gap ∆ is increasingly smeared by the Fermi-Dirac distribution. This leads to a small, i.e., non-zero tunneling current at voltages within the band gap [68]. A direct deconvolution of the local density of states (LDOS) and the Fermi distribution function would require an assumption on the shape of the LDOS as function of energy. Such an assumption is not justified because a significant spatial variation of the dI/dV curves is observed at 4.3 K (Figure 3a-c), as found consistently in other magnetic topological insulators [64,69]. Therefore, a new method to derive ∆ at elevated T is established. For this purpose, the ratio between dI/dV at V =0 mV and dI/dV at larger V , outside the region of the band gaps observed at 4.3 K, is employed (Supplementary Section IX D). Figure 3d displays the ratio R = [dI/dV (0 mV)]/[dI/dV (-50 mV)] for a large number of dI/dV spectra recorded at temperatures varying from 4.3 K to 50 K (small dots). Selected dI/dV spectra at 10, 21 and 47 K are shown as insets (more dI/dV data in Supplement: Figure 12). One can see that up to 20 K, the STS ratio R is zero and thus dI/dV = 0 nS at zero bias, directly evidencing the persistence of the gap. At higher temperatures the R values gradually increase due to the temperature broadening effect along with a decreasing magnetic gap size as the temperature approaches T C . To separate these two effects, the temperature dependence of the STS ratio for fixed gap sizes ∆(4.3 K) = 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 meV is modelled by convolving the dI/dV curves recorded at 4.3 K (Figure 3ac) with the Fermi distribution, while capturing their gap sizes ∆ (Supplement: Figure 13).To prove that the energy gap is of magnetic origin [24], the temperature dependence ∆(T ) is probed by STS.

        <p>The corresponding model results are represented by solid grey lines in Figure 3d, where the red line marked with 0 meV indicates how the STS ratio R evolves with temperature when the gap is zero.

        <p>Comparing experimental data points with the calculated lines reveals that the gap size continuously decreases as the temperature approaches T C and closes rather precisely at T C = 45-50 K in line with the T C deduced from XMCD and SQUID. As described above, the gap size varies spatially across the surface (Figure 3a-c) due to local disorder. Accordingly, at higher temperatures the STS ratios also exhibit a considerable variation depending on where the STS spectra were recorded. For this reason, larger ensembles of data points have been recorded at four selected temperatures T = 10, 21, 31 and 36 K within an area of 400 nm 2 . From these, the average gap sizes are deduced to ∆(21 K) = 11 ± 5 meV, ∆(31 K) = 6 ± 1 meV, and ∆(36 K) = 4 ± 1 meV, as represented by the large grey and white dots in Figure 3d. Thus, the gap indeed gradually shrinks as the temperature approaches T C and closes above fulfilling the expectations for a ferromagnetic topological insulator [24]. Note that the different grey shades of the small data points mark different cooling runs starting from an initial elevated temperature. Hence, the tip slowly drifts during cooling across the sample surface while measuring at varying temperature and, thus, explores variations of ∆ by T and by spatial position simultaneously. Accordingly, the visible trend of ∆(T ) relies on the sufficient statistics of probed locations that is particularly adequate for the spatially averaged ∆ (large dots).Comparing experimental data points with the calculated lines reveals that the gap size continuously decreases as the temperature approaches T C and closes rather precisely at T C = 45-50 K in line with the T C deduced from XMCD and SQUID.

        <p>The conclusion that the gap closes at T C is corroborated by comparing the experimental gap evolution with the measured magnetization M (T ) (Figure 1d,f, Supplement: Figure 7) using the relation ∆(T ) ∝ M (T ), as found in previous experiments [24] and theory [70]. Using M (T ) from SQUID and XMCD magnetization data (Figure 1d,f, Supplement: Figure 7) and the low temperature gap ∆(4.3 K) = 17 meV (Figure 3b), one obtains ∆(T ) = ∆(4.3 K) • M (T )/M 0 and, thus, straightforwardly R(T ) for the magnetization data.The conclusion that the gap closes at T C is corroborated by comparing the experimental gap evolution with the measured magnetization M (T ) (Figure 1d,f, Supplement: Figure 7) using the relation ∆(T ) ∝ M (T ), as found in previous experiments [24] and theory [70].

        <p>The results are presented as yellow, blue and red dots in Figure 3d demonstrating nice agreement to the STS data. This further corroborates the magnetic origin of the gap. Since the center energy of the gap (Supplement: Figure 11f) is close to the estimated Dirac point position in ARPES (Figure 2e,h), the gap is attributed to the topological surface state, consistent with the out-of-plane spin polarization near the Dirac point observed by spin-resolved ARPES (Figure 2j). Such a magnetic gap of a topological surface state close to E F is highly favorable for probing the resulting topological conductivity and its expected quantization.The results are presented as yellow, blue and red dots in Figure 3d demonstrating nice agreement to the STS data.

        <p>To clarify the origin of the discovered ferromagnetic topological insulator, the electronic band structure of MnSb 2 Te 4 has been calculated by various DFT methods, considering different magnetic configurations including chemical and magnetic disorder (Supplementary Section XI). As a general result, the topological insulator is reproduced by introducing magnetic disorder. Calculating the bulk band structure, the perfect ferromagnetic system without disorder appears as a topological Weyl semimetal with a zero bulk band gap and a Weyl crossing point located along ΓZ about 5% of the Brillouin zone away from Γ (Figure 4f,g, Supplement: Figures 14e,15a). This is in agreement with recent calculations [47,53], but obviously disagrees with the STS and ARPES results. On the other hand, the defect-free antiferromagnetic system is found to be a topological insulator with a bulk band gap of 120 meV, Figure 4k. This is evidenced by the band inversion at Γ, indicated by the color code of the spectral function difference between cationic and anionic sites [red (blue): dominating anion (cation) character, Supplementary Section XI]. This color code is also used in Figure 4f-j. Slab calculations of the band structure (Figure 4d) indeed reveal the topological surface state with gap at the Dirac point due to time reversal symmetry breaking. Discrepancies to earlier calculations [51,52] are discussed in Supplementary Section XI C order, we additionally study deviations from defect-free, pure ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic order. For more realistic modelling, more complex magnetic orders are taken into account deviating from perfect ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic order as implied by the magnetometry results (Figure 1e, Supplement: Figure 7). The extreme case of completely disordered local magnetic moments, without net magnetization, showcases a bulk band gap of 135 meV with nontrivial topology as seen from the band inversion around the gap close to Γ (Figure 4j). Varying the degrees of magnetic disorder shows that already 20 % of magnetic disorder breaks up the Weyl point of the ferromagnetic MnSb 2 Te 4 and opens an inverted band gap (Figure 4g-i, Supplement: Figure 15). This nontrivial topology induced by magnetic disorder is robust against chemical disorder as Mn-Sb site exchange that proved to be essential for inducing the ferromagnetic order in the system (Supplement: Table III). Indeed, a Mn-Sb site exchange by 5 % does not affect the band topology (Supplement: Figure 14). This implies that, contrary to recent conclusions [54], defect engineering accomplishes simultaneously a nontrival topology and very high Curie temperature for the MnSb 2 Te 4 system.To clarify the origin of the discovered ferromagnetic topological insulator, the electronic band structure of MnSb 2 Te 4 has been calculated by various DFT methods, considering different magnetic configurations including chemical and magnetic disorder (Supplementary Section XI).

        <p>To further assess the robustness of the magnetic gap, slab calculations are employed with various magnetic disorder configurations. The simplest case of a purely ferromagnetic slab does not lead to a Dirac cone, since the bulk band gap vanishes (Figure 4b). The pure antiferromagnetic order, on the other hand, creates a pronounced Dirac cone with magnetic gap of 16 meV, Figure 4d,e, nicely matching the average gap size found by STS (Figure 3b).To further assess the robustness of the magnetic gap, slab calculations are employed with various magnetic disorder configurations.

        <p>The magnetic gap size turns out to be a rather local property caused by the exchange interaction in near-surface MnSb 2 Te 4 septuple layers. Naturally, the gapped Dirac cone forms also when the surface of an antiferromagnet is terminated by a few ferromagnetic layers (Supplement: Figure 16d). A relatively strong out-of-plane spin polarization at the gap edges (∼ 60%) is found in that case nicely matching the results of the spin-resolved ARPES data measured at 30 K (∼ 25%), if one takes into account the temperature dependence of the magnetization (Figure 1d,f). Moreover, for more random combinations of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic layers, the Dirac cone with magnetic gap persists, albeit the bulk band gap vanishes due to the more extended ferromagnetic portions in that structure (Supplement: Figure 16a). Finally, for a system where the magnetic moments of adjacent septuple layers are continuously tilted with respect to each other, a gapped Dirac cone was also observed, in the presence of disorder [71] as experimentally observed [72,73]. Note that such disorder is witnessed in our samples by the spatial gap size fluctuations (Figure 3). Moreover, the magnetic phases of MnSb 2 Te 4 are indeed energetically very close to each other according to DFT [27] as also indicated by the kink in the M (T ) curve (Supplement: Figure 7 performed at RWTH Aachen University, samples were transferred from the MBE system by an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) suitcase that allowed transportation without breaking UHV conditions.

        <p>Figure 9 shows that the Dirac cone surface state has no dispersion with the wave vector perpendicular to the surface plane, in contrast to the bulk valence band. Figure 9 is the input for Fig. 2b, main text, with linear interpolation between the 9 photon energies. Table II shows the momentum values in kinetic energy. The band gaps at T = 4.3 K were determined as follows. First, the noise level of the dI/dV curves was reduced by averaging 3 × 3 curves covering an area of (1.2 nm) 2 . Subsequently, an averaging of dI/dV (V ) across ±2 mV in bias direction was employed. Then, we estimated the remaining dI/dV noise level as the maximum of |dI/dV | that appears with similar strength positively and negatively. For that purpose, we employed about 50 randomly selected dI/dV (V ) curves. Afterwards, the threshold was chosen slightly above the determined noise level. This threshold is marked in Fig. 3a #1 as dashed line and in Fig. 3c as yellow line in the color code bar. The voltage width, where the dI/dV (V ) spectra stayed below this threshold, defines the measured gap ∆ as used in Fig. 3a-c, main text.Figure 9 shows that the Dirac cone surface state has no dispersion with the wave vector perpendicular to the surface plane, in contrast to the bulk valence band.

        <p>The following sections describe the experimental and theoretical methods as well as additional data supporting the conclusions from the main text. V mod = 1.4 mV while ramping V . The spectra were normalized to account for remaining vibrational noise during stabilization by equilibrating the integral between V Stab and V = 0 mV. We crosschecked that dI/dV curves barely depend on the chosen I stab and, hence, on the tip-surface distance (Fig. 10).The following sections describe the experimental and theoretical methods as well as additional data supporting the conclusions from the main text.

        <p>Transport measurements were performed in the van der Pauw geometry with applied magnetic fields ranging from -3 T to +3 T and oriented parallel to the rhombohedral axis of the epilayers. A mini cryogen-free system was employed for the magnetotransport investigations at temperatures between 2 K and 300 K. For temperatures below about 50 K an anomalous Hall effect appears in the transport data that becomes hysteretic for magnetic fields of less than about 1 T such as the sheet resistance of the samples (compare Fig. 1e, main text). The carrier concentrations were determined from the Hall resistance at sufficiently high magnetic fields, i.e., well above 1 T where the sample magnetization was largely saturated.

        <p>The electronic and magnetic structures were calculated by two different methods based on density functional theory (DFT). Most of the bulk-type calculations (Figs. 4f-k, main text, Fig. 14, Fig. 15a,b) used a Green function method within the multiple scattering theory [76,77]. To describe both localization and interaction of the Mn 3d orbitals appropriately, Coulomb U values of 3-5 eV were employed within a GGA+U approach [78]. During these calculations, we confirmed that different topological phases of MnSb 2 Te 4 arise, if one uses either GGA+U or LDA+U , indicating that LDA+U is not sufficient. To account for antiferromagnetic configurations of MnSb 2 Te 4 , a double unit cell consisting of two septuple layers was used such as for Fig. 4k, main text, and Fig. 14a andc. In these structures, the Mn atoms couple ferromagnetically within the Mn planes and antiferromagnetically between neighboring Mn layers in adajacent septuple layers. For the determination of T N and T C , exchange constants J ij were obtained by mapping the DFT calculations onto a classical Heisenberg model [79].The electronic and magnetic structures were calculated by two different methods based on density functional theory (DFT).
