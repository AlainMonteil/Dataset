        <p>Multiply periodic states appear in a wide variety of physical contexts, such as the Rayleigh-Be ´nard convection, Faraday waves, liquid crystals and skyrmion crystals recently observed in chiral magnets. Here we study the phase diagram of an anisotropic frustrated magnet which contains five different multiply periodic states including the skyrmion crystal. We clarify the mechanism for stabilization of these states and discuss how they can be observed in magnetic resonance and electric polarization measurements. We also find stable isolated skyrmions with topological charge 1 and 2. Their spin structure, interactions and dynamics are more complex than those in chiral magnets. In particular, magnetic resonance in the skyrmion crystal should be accompanied by oscillations of the electric polarization with a frequency depending on the amplitude of the a.c. magnetic field. These results show that skyrmion materials with rich physical properties can be found among frustrated magnets. We formulate rules to help the search.Multiply periodic states appear in a wide variety of physical contexts, such as the Rayleigh-Be ´nard convection, Faraday waves, liquid crystals and skyrmion crystals recently observed in chiral magnets.

        <p>Skyrmions are close relatives of magnetic bubbles (cylindrical domains) and the transformation of the helical spiral into SkX is analogous to the field-induced transition between the stripe domain state and the bubble array taking place in thin FM films. In the framework of Landau theory, the bubble array is described by three coexisting spin modulations with the wave vectors, q 1 , q 2 and q 3 , which add to zero. This 3q-state is stabilized by an anharmonic interaction between these modulations and the uniform magnetization induced by an applied magnetic field 19 . In bulk chiral magnets, SkX competes with the conical spiral (CS) state, and an additional order-from-disorder mechanismstabilization by thermal spin fluctuations-was invoked to explain why skyrmions are only observed at elevated temperatures 3,20 .Skyrmions are close relatives of magnetic bubbles (cylindrical domains) and the transformation of the helical spiral into SkX is analogous to the field-induced transition between the stripe domain state and the bubble array taking place in thin FM films.

        <p>Practical applications of skyrmions crucially depend on finding new classes of skyrmion materials and new microscopic mechanisms for their stabilization. Recently, Okubo et al. 21 studied numerically an isotropic Heisenberg spin model on a (centrosymmetric) triangular lattice with competing spin interactions. It shows a spiral ground state, which above a critical magnetic field transforms into the SkX. In addition, a state with two coexisting spirals was found in applied magnetic fields. These multi-q states are induced by thermal fluctuations and appear at non-zero temperatures.Practical applications of skyrmions crucially depend on finding new classes of skyrmion materials and new microscopic mechanisms for their stabilization.

        <p>Here we discuss a mechanism that lends stability to multiply periodic states even at zero temperature. We show that a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy strongly affects spin ordering in the frustrated triangular magnet: tuning magnetic field and anisotropy at zero temperature, we find eight different phases, five of which are multi-q states. A large part of the phase diagram is occupied by the SkX. We clarify the nature of the phases found in numerical simulations and present results of analytical studies of instability of spiral states towards additional periodic modulations. We calculate magnetic resonance spectra and magnetically induced electric polarization, which show strong sensitivity to spin ordering and can be used for experimental identification of complex magnetic states. We explore rich physics of isolated skyrmions in frustrated magnets. Their monopole and toroidal moment densities oscillate with the distance from the skyrmion centre, which gives rise to alternation of attraction and repulsion between skyrmions, clustering of skyrmions in high magnetic fields and stability of skyrmions with topological charge 2. Dynamics of skyrmions in frustrated magnets is different from that of chiral magnets because of the additional collective degree of freedom-skyrmion helicity. The coupling between the helicity and the skyrmion centre-of-mass motion leads to a dynamical magnetoelectric effect.Here we discuss a mechanism that lends stability to multiply periodic states even at zero temperature.

The sinusoidal modulations appear above a critical magnetic field, h 1 (K), and the transition between the VS state and this mixed (M) is of second order. (7) The FL (Fig. 2c). As magnetic field increases further, the spiral plane changes from vertical to horizontal. This flop transition is not instantaneous, but occurs in a narrow field interval, h 2 (K)ohoh 3 (K), in which the spiral plane as well as the direction of the sinusoidal modulations rotate. The orientation of the spiral plane changes abruptly at h 2 , and at h 3 (K) the system undergoes a first-order transition to the 2qstate.

        <p>The fan oscillations of spins in skyrmion give rise to sign changes of the skyrmion-skyrmion interaction U(r 12 ) (Fig. 4a). This interaction depends on the topological charges of skyrmions. For brevity, we call a skyrmion with positive vorticity and Q ¼ À 1 a skyrmion, while a skyrmion with v ¼ À 1 and Q ¼ þ 1 is called an antiskyrmion. Two skyrmions or two antiskyrmions attract each other at distances of the order of the skyrmion diameter, the maximal reduction of energy being B10% of the skyrmion energy. Because of the attraction, the skyrmion crystal phase extends to h4h * (K), as the energy per skyrmion in the crystal can be negative even when the energy of an isolated skyrmion is positive. Isolated skyrmions tend to form clusters with a short-range crystal order, resembling the clustering of vortices in 1.5-type superconductors 27 .

        <p>The field-induced spin dynamics in frustrated magnets is, however, more complex than in chiral magnets, because of the additional zero mode-helicity. This can be seen from the fact that the time dependence of an in-plane component of spin at a chosen site (Fig. 6c) is a superposition of periodic oscillations with two different periods. The shorter period corresponds to the rotation of the skyrmion centre, whereas the longer one results from a monotonous increase of the helicity angle, as evidenced by the series of snapshots shown in Fig. 6d (Supplementary Movie 1).
