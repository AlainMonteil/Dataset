        <p>The Second Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources is a catalogue of sources detected in single-frequency maps from the full duration of the Planck mission and supersedes previous versions of the Planck compact source catalogues. It consists of compact sources, both Galactic and extragalactic, detected over the entire sky. Compact sources detected in the lower frequency channels are assigned to the PCCS2, while at higher frequencies they are assigned to one of two sub-catalogues, the PCCS2 or PCCS2E, depending on their location on the sky. The first of these catalogues covers most of the sky and allows the user to produce subsamples at higher reliabilities than the target 80 % integral reliability of the catalogue. The PCCS2E contains sources detected in sky regions where the diffuse emission makes it difficult to quantify the reliability of the detections. Both the PCCS2 and PCCS2E include polarization measurements, in the form of polarized flux densities, or upper limits, and orientation angles for all seven polarization-sensitive Planck channels. The improved data-processing of the full-mission maps and their reduced noise levels allow us to increase the number of objects in the catalogue, improving its completeness for the target 80 % reliability as compared with the previous versions, the PCCS and ERCSC catalogues.The Second Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources is a catalogue of sources detected in single-frequency maps from the full duration of the Planck mission and supersedes previous versions of the Planck compact source catalogues.

        <p>This paper, one of a set associated with the 2015 release of data from the Planck mission, 1 describes the second release of the Table 1. Characteristics of the PCCS2 and PCCS2E catalogues: flux density at 90% completeness in total intensity; number of sources detected in each catalogue in total intensity; number for which polarized signal is measured above a 99.99% confidence level. See Tables 13 and14 for more details. Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources. It outlines the construction of the single-frequency catalogues from an analysis of each of the nine Planck frequency-channel, full-mission maps. The construction of these catalogues builds on much of the same infrastructure and methodology as the first incarnation of the Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources (PCCS), and the reader is referred to Planck Collaboration XXVIII (2014) for a full description of the procedures, which are only summarized here. Table 1 lists some basic properties of the nine frequency subcatalogues of the current release. One of the primary differences of this release from the PCCS is the division of the six highest frequency catalogues into two sub-catalogues, the PCCS2 and the PCCS2E. This division separates sources for which the reliability can be quantified (PCCS2) from those of unknown reliability (PCCS2E). This separation is primarily based on the Galactic coordinates of the source, as described in Sect. 2.3. The target integral reliability of the the entire catalogue, as in the PCCS, is 80 % or greater. The advantage of setting the reliability target relatively low is that it improves the odds of discovering interesting sources with unusual properties, which might otherwise have been rejected by restrictive selection criteria. On the other hand, a highly reliable catalogue is desirable for followup observations. That is the aim of the PCCS2. To this end, we have provided additional information in the catalogue which will allow a user to select a subset of highly reliable sources from the PCCS2. This takes the form of an additional figure per source which indicates the highest reliability catalogue to which that source belongs, allowing the user to perform a cut on the PCCS2 to reduce it to the desired percentage reliability subset. To assist users, we also flag those sources identified in other catalogues, mainly at radio wavelengths. The principal data-driven difference between the PCCS and the PCCS2 and PCCS2E catalogues is the additional data from the "extended" mission and the inclusion of polarization measurements in seven out of the nine frequency channels. The 545 and 857 GHz channels are not sensitive to polarized signals, so the polarization measurements span the range from 30 to 353 GHz. The polarization measurements provided are based on the positions of the entific consortia funded by ESA member states and led by Principal Investigators from France and Italy, telescope reflectors provided through a collaboration between ESA and a scientific consortium led and funded by Denmark, and additional contributions from NASA (USA). For the HFI channels, the 90 % completeness limits plotted for the PCCS were evaluated in the extragalactic zone as defined in Planck Collaboration XXVIII (2014). The regions of sky to which the 90 % completeness limits apply are therefore similar but not identical to those of the PCCS2. These comparisons are discussed further in Sect. 4.This paper, one of a set associated with the 2015 release of data from the Planck mission, 1 describes the second release of the Table 1. Characteristics of the PCCS2 and PCCS2E catalogues: flux density at 90% completeness in total intensity; number of sources detected in each catalogue in total intensity; number for which polarized signal is measured above a 99.99% confidence level.

        <p>After four years of operations, the data from the full Planck mission have been transformed into full-sky HEALPix2 maps (Górski et al. 2005) by the Data Processing Centres (DPCs) (Planck Collaboration VI 2015;Planck Collaboration VIII 2015). The Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) DPC produced the Table 2. Parameters of the beam used in the construction of the PCCS2 and PCCS2E. Two FWHM values are given: one from an elliptical Gaussian fit to the beam; and another which is the FWHM of a Gaussian with the same solid angle as the main beam, Ω beam . The FWHM found from the main beam solid angle is used to evaluate Ω beam 1 and Ω beam 2 , which are the beam solid angles within a radius equal to this FWHM and twice this FWHM, respectively. 30, 44, and 70 GHz maps after the completion of eight full surveys (spanning the period 2009 August 12 to 2013 August 3). In addition, special LFI maps covering the period 2013 April 1 to 2013 June 30 were produced in order to compare the Planck flux-density scales with those of the Very Large Array and the Australia Telescope Compact Array, by performing simultaneous observations of a sample of sources over that period. The High Frequency Instrument (HFI) DPC produced the 100, 143, 217, 353, 545, and 857 GHz maps after five full surveys (2009August 12 to 2012 January 11). The flux densities of all sources measured in the full-mission maps are an average of several observations. Single-survey maps are available from the Planck Legacy Archive, 3 but single-survey flux densities are not provided in this catalogue. It is important to note that even singlesurvey maps may include more than one observation of an individual source, and hence extracting flux densities from the single-survey maps does not guarantee a single-epoch observation for a given source. However, in the Planck Legacy Archive the time ordered data are available and users can produce maps from arbitrary time intervals. Table 2 gives the parameters of the Planck beams used in this paper; further details may be found in Planck Collaboration II (2015) and Planck Collaboration VII (2015).After four years of operations, the data from the full Planck mission have been transformed into full-sky HEALPix2 maps (Górski et al. 2005) by the Data Processing Centres (DPCs) (Planck Collaboration VI 2015;Planck Collaboration VIII 2015).

        <p>The compact sources in the catalogue were detected at each frequency independently using improved versions of the detection pipelines used to create the PCCS. These pipelines are based on the Mexican Hat Wavelet 2 algorithm (MHW2; González-Nuevo et al. 2006;López-Caniego et al. 2006). This is a cleaning and denoising algorithm used to convolve the maps, preserving the amplitude of the sources while greatly reducing the large scale structures visible at gigahertz frequencies (e.g., diffuse Galactic emission) and small scale fluctuations (e.g., instrumental noise) in the vicinity of the sources. The LFI and HFI 3 http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/planck/pla DPCs have different implementations of the MHW2 algorithm, but consistency checks between them have been performed. The differences between the implementations are described in Planck Collaboration XXVIII (2014), and are due to the different characteristics of the maps at LFI and HFI frequencies, requiring alternative methods to reduce the numbers of spurious detections. Both implementations project the full-sky maps onto square patches where the filtering and detection is performed. The size of the patches and the overlap between patches have been chosen in such a way that the full sky is effectively covered. Sources above a fixed signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) threshold are selected and their positions are translated from patch to spherical sky coordinates. Because the patches overlap, multiple detections of the same object can occur, these must be found and removed, keeping the detection with the highest S/N for inclusion in the catalogue.The compact sources in the catalogue were detected at each frequency independently using improved versions of the detection pipelines used to create the PCCS.

        <p>For reasons explained in Sect. 1, for this release we provide two sub-catalogues for some frequency channels, PCCS2 and PCCS2E. We also provide a new parameter for each source which gives the highest reliability catalogue to which the source belongs. However, it is not possible to evaluate this parameter for every source. It is this consideration which separates the sources into the PCCS2 and the PCCS2E; those sources without this field are placed in the PCCS2E. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the PCCS2 and PCCS2E sources across the sky for three of the Planck frequency channels (30,143,and 857 GHz).For reasons explained in Sect. 1, for this release we provide two sub-catalogues for some frequency channels, PCCS2 and PCCS2E.

        <p>LFI: One measure of the reliability of the sources detected in the three LFI channels is based on a comparison with existing catalogues of radio sources. First, each single-frequency catalogue is compared with the appropriate external radio catalogues. Next, all the remaining unidentified sources outside a |b| &gt; 20 • Galactic cut are examined on a source-by-source basis by performing a manual search in archival repositories such as the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED). Second, a multifrequency analysis is used to assess whether or not a source is present in more than one Planck channel between 30 and 100 GHz. All sources with plausible identifications in external catalogues are assigned to the PCCS2 with a high degree of reliability. Additionally, all sources which were detected in two or more Planck channels in the multifrequency analysis are also placed in the PCCS2, albeit with a lower degree of reliability. Given the small number of remaining sources, we do not create a PCCS2E for the LFI bands. Instead, we flag the least reliable sources. Further details can be found in Sect. 3.2.1, which describes our assessment of the reliability of the PCCS2 at the lower frequency channels.LFI: One measure of the reliability of the sources detected in the three LFI channels is based on a comparison with existing catalogues of radio sources.

        <p>HFI: There are no external full-sky catalogues at HFI frequencies; hence the reliability cannot be evaluated following the same procedure as for LFI. The reliability assessment must therefore proceed via the injection of known sources into simulated or real maps. For this reliability assessment to be meaningful the resultant catalogues obtained from these injected sources must be consistent with the real catalogues. However, in some cases there are discrepancies arising from deficiencies in the simulation of diffuse dust emission near the beam scale (e.g., Galactic cirrus) and in the number count models, and for this reason we have to exclude some regions from the analysis, as explained in Sect. 3.2.3. In particular, in order to achieve this consistency we need to exclude the Galactic plane region from the analysis due to uncertainties in defining an input source model for the Galactic sources. The region excluded increases with frequency and is not a simple Galactic latitude cut, but is based on the level of the dust emission. The Galactic masks used at each of the six HFI frequencies are described in Sect. 3.2. In addition to these Galactic plane regions, for the highest four frequency channels we also exclude the region of sky inside a filament mask from the reliability assessment. There is a different filament mask for each of these channels. These filament masks are defined by structures in the maps which are not completely removed by the MHW2 filter. The union of the filament mask and the Galactic plane region then defines the area of the sky in which sources are assigned to the PCCS2E. Thus whether a source is assigned to the PCCS2 or PCCS2E is determined solely by its location on the sky. The HFI reliability assessment and the filament masks will be described further in Sect. 3.2. Fig. 3. Distribution of the polarized sources in the lowest channels of the PCCS2. Red, green, and blue circles show sources from the 30, 44, and 70 GHz catalogues, respectively. As in Fig. 2, the size of the filled circles give a qualitative idea of the relative polarized flux densities of the sources.HFI: There are no external full-sky catalogues at HFI frequencies; hence the reliability cannot be evaluated following the same procedure as for LFI.

        <p>As in the PCCS, we provide four different measures of the flux density for each source. They are determined by the source detection algorithm, aperture photometry, point spread function (PSF) fitting, and Gaussian fitting. Only the first is obtained from the filtered maps; the other measures are estimated from the full-sky maps at the positions of the sources. The source detection algorithm photometry, the aperture photometry, and the PSF fitting use the Planck band-average effective beams, calculated with FEBeCoP (Fast Effective Beam Convolution in Pixel space) (Mitra et al. 2011;Planck Collaboration IV 2015;Planck Collaboration VII 2015). Note that only 
            <rs type="software">PSFFLUX</rs> takes into account the variation of the PSF with position on the sky. The PCCS2 has been produced from the Planck full-mission maps (8 sky surveys in the LFI and 5 sky surveys in the HFI), and therefore supersedes the previous catalogues (for the PCCS only 1.5 surveys were analysed). It also includes the latest calibration and beam information, and we have improved some of the algorithms used to measure the photometry of the sources. In order to assess the differences between the photometry in the PCCS and PCCS2 we have compared both sets of catalogues at all Planck bands.
        </p>
        <p>A major change is in the Gaussian fitting photometry. We have implemented a new version of the algorithm that produces more robust measures, particularly for extended objects where the difference between the flux densities in the PCCS and PCCS2 can be as large as 100%. In the previous version of the algorithm, for some sources the fitting code was not converging properly and this issue has been addressed by using a new fitting approach; see Appendix B for a description of the methid and its validation. In addition, the photometry from the detection pipeline has changed at some frequencies by several percent, because it now takes into account the latest information about the effective beam FWHM and corrects for the biases listed in Table 6, which range from 1% to 12%, depending on the frequency. The other two techniques, aperture photometry and PSF fitting, produce similar results in both catalogues. In the first case, the algorithm has not changed, while in the second, although the algorithm has been changed to improve the position accuracy, this does not affect our measurements because we use the coordinates from the detection pipeline as the reference for all photometric measures. In both cases the differences are always at the percent level. Moreover, flux densities extracted from the publicly released Planck maps at 30, 44, and 70 GHz require a small correction for beam efficiency, since a small amount of power lies outside the main beam (Planck Collaboration II 2015). These small multiplicative corrections are 1.00808, 1.00117, and 1.00646 at 30, 44, and 70 GHz, respectively. The flux densities provided for sources in the PCCS2 catalogues have been corrected accordingly. Uncertainties are provided for all four flux-density measures. In Table 13 we show the uncertainties associated with the flux densities of the faintest sources in the extragalactic zone of each catalogue, after excluding the faintest 10% of sources as obtained with the source detection algorithm. These uncertainties range from 90 to 130 mJy for the 30-70 GHz catalogues, and from 30 to 270 mJy for the 100-857 GHz catalogues. This gives an idea of the sensitivity of the catalogue and the associated uncertainties. However, the uncertainties depend not only on the flux density of the sources but also on their position in the sky, so we provide noise maps that can be used to estimate the expected uncertainty in the flux density of a source at any position in the sky.A major change is in the Gaussian fitting photometry.

However, the uncertainties depend not only on the flux density of the sources but also on their position in the sky, so we provide noise maps that can be used to estimate the expected uncertainty in the flux density of a source at any position in the sky.</p>
        <p>The detection pipelines assume that sources are point-like. The amplitude of a detected source is converted to flux density using the solid angle of the effective beam (from Table 2), and the conversion from map units into intensity units. The uncertainty in the flux density for each source is measured as the local noise in an annulus around the source in the MHW2 filtered map, where bright pixels belonging to other compact sources in the vicinity, if any, are excluded from the calculation. If a source is resolved by Planck its flux density will be underestimated. In this case it may be better to use the 
            <rs type="software">GAUFLUX</rs> estimation. The estimation of the flux density provided by the HFI detection pipeline has been im-proved since the PCCS release, by removing a bias that lowered the recovered flux densities in the higher frequency channels (see Planck Collaboration XXVIII 2014).

        <p>The flux density is estimated by integrating the data in a circular aperture centred at the position of the source. An annulus around the aperture is used to evaluate the level of the background. The annulus is also used to make a local estimate of the noise to calculate the uncertainty in the estimate of the flux density. The flux density is corrected for the fraction of the beam solid angle falling outside the aperture and for the fraction of the beam solid angle falling in the annulus. The aperture photometry was computed using an aperture with a radius equal to the average FWHM of the effective beam (the effective FWHM in Table 2), and an annulus with an inner radius of 1 FWHM and an outer radius of 2 FWHM. The effective beams, also given in Table 2, were used to compute the beam solid angle corrections. For details see the PCCS paper (Planck Collaboration XXVIII 2014).The flux density is estimated by integrating the data in a circular aperture centred at the position of the source.

        <p>PSF fit photometry (PSFFLUX). The flux density and its uncertainty are obtained by fitting a model of the PSF at the position of the source. The model has four free parameters: the amplitude of the source, a background offset, and two coordinates for the location of the source. The PSF is obtained from the effective beam by means of a bicubic spline interpolation for source positions that are different from the centre of a pixel. Note that the PSF fitting now includes sub-pixel positioning, which is a new feature introduced after the production of the PCCS. For details see Appendix A.PSF fit photometry (PSFFLUX).

        <p>Gaussian fit photometry (
            <rs type="software">GAUFLUX</rs>). The approach to Gaussian fitting has been completely revised since the PCCS. The algorithm now allows the position of the source to vary as the best fit is found. The same parameters are returned for each source: its flux density, the major and minor semi-axes, and an orientation angle. Additionally, as in the PCCS, the semiaxis values are used in the construction of the flag for extended sources. The new method uses a downhill simplex method in multi-dimensions, the Nelder-Mead method, to find the best-fit values in the full parameter space of position, flux density, and elliptical Gaussian parameters. The method has been shown to be robust and stable (Press et al. 1992). Optimization is based on the reduced log-likelihood with prior regularization for the size of the source defined by the effective beam at each frequency. The downhill simplex methods does not produce estimates on the flux density uncertainties. For this purpose a Markov Chain Monte Carlo has been used. For details see Appendix B.

        <p>In the Planck polarization maps, the polarized sources are embedded in a background which is the combination of instrumental noise and diffuse emission. The nature of the diffuse emission depends on the observation frequency; for example, polarized synchrotron emission in the lower frequency channels and infrared emission in the higher frequency channels. In both regimes the polarization fraction of the compact sources (the ratio between their polarized flux densities and total intensity) is typically lower than 1-2 %. This presents a challenge in terms of disentangling the true polarized flux density of a source from the background. In order to tackle this problem, a two-step process has been proposed (López-Caniego et al. 2009). First, a maximum-likelihood filter is applied, reducing the noise and enhancing the S/N of the sources embedded in the Q and U maps (Argüeso et al. 2009). Second, the significance of each detection is assessed based on the statistics of the local background in the vicinity of the source. Several significance levels were investigated and we concluded that, for the typical polarization backgrounds present in the Planck polarization maps, a signif- icance threshold of 99.99 % successfully distinguishes the polarized emission of a compact source from a peak in the background. This approach has been used in the present catalogues to attempt to measure the polarized flux densities and uncertainties of all sources found in the temperature maps. Polarization measurements are provided for all sources where the significance of the detected polarized signal reaches or exceeds the limit of 99.99 %; for the remaining sources we provide the 99 % upper limit.

        <p>At four HFI frequencies (100,143,217,and 353 GHz) we present an additional set of polarized flux-density and polarization angle estimates for sources detected only marginally in polarization. These are derived using the Bayesian PowellSnakes algorithm. The aim is to disentangle the sources which have some polarized emission from those that are consistent with no polarized signal. This allows us to probe fainter polarization signals, and thus to provide deeper and more complete polarization catalogues without any loss of reliability (as we show in Sect. 3.5).

The validation of the low-frequency sources can be performed in part by using the large number of existing catalogues. Detections identified with known sources have been flagged as such in the catalogues. In contrast, the validation of sources at higher frequencies must be done using simulations; specifically through a Monte Carlo quality assessment process in which artificial sources are injected into both real and simulated maps.

        <p>In the case of the three lowest frequencies, we compared the Planck compact source detections to external catalogues of radio sources. We began by constructing a band-merged catalogue based on positional coincidence and included all the sources detected at above the initial 4σ detection threshold at any of the LFI frequencies. The catalogue contained 2039 sources, many of which were detected at only one frequency. Using this catalogue we made a position-based search for identifications with three external catalogues of radio sources: CRATES (Healey et al. 2007), NEWPS (López-Caniego et al. 2007) and AT20G (Murphy et al. 2010), using a search radius of 1.5×σ b , where σ b = FWHM / 2 √ 2 ln 2 may be evaluated from the fitted FWHM in Table 2. These catalogues have a similar frequency coverage and source density to the PCCS2. As in the PCCS, the PCCS2 includes 94% of the sources in NEWPS when using a 1.5 × σ b search radius, and, therefore, in order to study the completeness of the catalogue, deeper samples like AT20G and CRATES are needed. However, the frequencies of these two surveys, 20 and 8.4 GHz, respectively, are lower than the lowest Planck frequency, and variability and spectral effects could push some of the sources below the PCCS2 detection thresholds. Thus, one can consider that the completeness that we estimate by comparing the PCCS2 against these three catalogues is a lower limit.In the case of the three lowest frequencies, we compared the Planck compact source detections to external catalogues of radio sources.

        <p>We show the Monte-Carlo completeness functions computed per channel in Fig. 7. We have calculated them using several cuts based on the highest reliability catalogue column that contains the highest reliability catalogue to which the sources belong (see Sect. 3.2.3). As the required catalogue reliability increases, the completeness decreases. We also show the completeness for the unvalidated area of the sky containing the PCCS2E. This area is significantly less complete than the main PCCS2 regions due to Galactic emission, with the completeness deteriorating markedly with frequency. The PCCS2 product includes noise maps at each channel, which are also shown in the middle panels of Fig. 8. These maps contain the MHW2 detection noise, defined as the standard deviation of the MHW2 filtered patches, σ s (θ, φ). A good approximation to the Monte-Carlo completeness can be calculated for any subsection of the sky using the noise maps and the reliability threshold maps. Assuming Gaussian noise in the filtered patches, the completeness is given by Eq. 6. We compare the error-function and Monte-Carlo completeness estimates for the 80 % reliability catalogues at each channel in Fig. 9. The effective σ s that we used, and included in the data release, has been normalized across the PCCS2 region to match the effective noise from the Monte Carlo tests. The Monte-Carlo completeness drop-off is slightly wider than the error-function completeness because it includes the effects of non-Gaussian noise from the background and varying asymmetric beams.

        <p>The underlying philosophy of the PCCS2 was to provide a catalogue of sources with a reliability of at least 80 % which could be cut if desired by a user to generate higher reliability subsets. This has required, as explained in Sect. 2.2, the division of the HFI data into two sub-catalogues, the PCCS2 and PCCS2E. The assignment to the PCCS2E is based on the position of the source on the sky. These locations are determined by the union of the Galactic region and the filament mask. Note that for 857 GHz this union represents more than half of the sky. The PCCS2E therefore contains substantially more sources than the PCCS2 in the higher frequency channels since it includes all the Galactic plane sources.The underlying philosophy of the PCCS2 was to provide a catalogue of sources with a reliability of at least 80 % which could be cut if desired by a user to generate higher reliability subsets.

        <p>There are regions on the sky even at high Galactic latitudes in which the detection of sources cannot be trusted to high levels of reliability. The reason is that the Mexican Hat Wavelet algorithm used for the detection of sources is essentially a form of edge detection. While this is ideal for point sources embedded in a Gaussian noise background, it is not optimal for a map with non-Gaussian structures where there are other edges to detect, such as dusty filaments. The impact of false detections due to these structures may in part be ameliorated by rejection criteria based on the number of connected pixels of the detection, as described in Planck Collaboration XXVIII ( 2014), but this is not a complete solution. We wish to place source detections occurring in these filamentary structures into the PCCS2E. In order to do this we need to create filament masks, which describe the regions of the sky which contain filamentary structures which pass into the wavelet filtered patches.There are regions on the sky even at high Galactic latitudes in which the detection of sources cannot be trusted to high levels of reliability.

Fractions of sky covered by the PCCS2 catalogue, the filament mask, and the Galactic region for the HFI channels. No masks are required for the LFI channels where the PCCS2 covers the entire sky. The filament mask is not required at the lower two HFI frequency channels. Some parts of the sky are covered by both the filament mask and the Galactic region. the point-like objects from the patch. The difficulty with this approach is setting an appropriate threshold above which to mask. Given these dusty structures are far from uniformly distributed across the sky, local evaluations of this threshold will not be as successful as a global one. Any practical filament mask should also be continuous; for both these reasons they cannot be created directly from the filtered patches.The obvious way to construct these masks would be to use the filtered patches themselves, after median filtering to remove Table 3.

        <p>A Mexican Hat Wavelet filtered map is very close to a difference-of-Gaussians (DOG) map if the ratio of the two FWHMs used is 2:1. The DOG map is created by smoothing the original map with two different Gaussians, creating two new maps which are then differenced. Here the smaller of the two FWHMs used is the fitted FWHM from Table 2. A full-sky DOG map may be trivially created, and while it is not identical to the filtered patches it traces the same structures in the original map which pass into the filtered patches. In order to remove point sources from the DOG map, it is median-filtered using a radius of twice the fitted FWHM from Table 2 for the radius of the filter. By thresholding this median-filtered DOG (MF-DOG) map, we can create the desired filament mask for each channel. In order to find an appropriate threshold, we select the cleanest (faintest) 25 % of the sky based on the smoothed sky brightness of the 857 GHz channel map, and create a histogram of the MF-DOG map from the pixels in this region. We then fit a Gaussian to this histogram, and the filament mask is given by all the pixels in the MF-DOG map whose value is greater than 3σ of this fitted Gaussian. Negative fluctuations are not masked as they cannot lead to spurious detections. In the case of point sources in a Gaussian background, this procedure would result in an MF-DOG map which would contain solely Gaussian noise and a mask created as above would be expected to mask 0.15 % of the sky. Table 3 shows the percentage area of the filament mask for the frequency channels at which it is used; we see that the percentage area masked is well in excess of the expectation from Gaussian statistics. Additionally, we see that the area of the filament mask increases with frequency as the maps contain more and more emission from dust. Indeed, we do not need to use a filament mask for the lower two HFI frequency channels as the dusty filamentary structures are no longer a problem at these frequencies.A Mexican Hat Wavelet filtered map is very close to a difference-of-Gaussians (DOG) map if the ratio of the two FWHMs used is 2:1.

        <p>Note that the risk of high S/N point sources located inside filamentary structures being placed inside the filament mask is limited by the fact that high S/N point sources in the DOG map are positive peaks surrounded by a negative troughs. This means that once the DOG map is median-filtered the resultant level in the MF-DOG map at the location of these point sources is likely to be below the level at which thresholding occurs.Note that the risk of high S/N point sources located inside filamentary structures being placed inside the filament mask is limited by the fact that high S/N point sources in the DOG map are positive peaks surrounded by a negative troughs.

        <p>We follow a similar procedure to the one used for the PCCS as described in Planck Collaboration XXVIII (2014). In that paper, the reliability was estimated by injecting sources into simulated sky maps at 100-217 GHz, producing what we termed simulation reliability. This involves simulating both the real and spurious detection components of the total counts using the PCCS2 above a given flux density threshold (above which we are complete) fitted to a single power-law model defined as N(S ) ∝ S -α .We follow a similar procedure to the one used for the PCCS as described in Planck Collaboration XXVIII (2014).

        <p>For each channel we provide three numbers in Table 4: α is the power-law index (estimated per frequency with error in the range 0.05-0.1); S min is the minimum flux density considered when fitting the model (i.e., lower flux densities are excluded to allow for incompleteness); and S taper is the flux density at which the power law was truncated for the completeness simulations to avoid dominating the injected population with unobservable faint sources. Note that there was no truncation for the reliability work (simulation or injection). At 353-857 GHz the reliability was estimated by injecting sources into the real-sky maps in a similar process to the completeness estimation, producing what we termed injection reliability. This requires simulations of the real source component only; the spurious source counts are inferred from the difference between the total source counts in the catalogues and the simulated real source counts from the source injection. Simulation reliability is preferable to injection reliability as it provides a more complete understanding of the detection properties of the catalogue, including information on how the reliability varies as a function position on the sky, as well as on S/N. Previously, the simulated maps at 353-857 GHz could not be used to produce a simulation reliability estimate. The simulated number counts and completeness were not consistent with the real data, with discrepancies arising from deficiencies in the simulation of diffuse dust emission near the beam scale. Improvements have been made in the simulations; using the FFP8 simulations (Planck Collaboration XII 2015), it is now possible to extend the use of simulation reliability to 353 GHz. These maps, however, include a leaked compact-source component from the Planck maps from which they were derived. As this can produce artificial, high S/N, spurious sources, we screen these from the reliability estimates by considering any detection at S/N &gt; 10 to be real. For 545 and 857 GHz, we continue to use the injection reliability estimate outside the Galactic region.

        <p>For the 100-353 GHz channels we can perform the reliability assessment using simulation reliability. This allows us to define a local S/N threshold, q(θ, φ, P), as a function of both sky position (θ, φ) and target reliability, P. This threshold gives a local reliability P within an 8 • radius of (θ, φ). This information allows us to populate the HIGHEST RELIABILITY CAT field for all sources in the PCCS2 catalogues in these channels with a resolution of 1 % reliability. Note that, for these four channels, the option to create a higher reliability subset will also apply to spatial subsets of the original catalogue. For example, one could create a catalogue of the north ecliptic pole region to a reliability of 97 % if desired.For the 100-353 GHz channels we can perform the reliability assessment using simulation reliability.

        <p>For the 545 and 857 GHz channels the limitations of the injection reliability mean that we are unable to define a local S/N threshold for a given reliability. Hence, we provide a global S/N threshold that will deliver the target reliability for the full catalogue. We use this approach to populate the HIGHEST RELIABILITY CAT field for these channels in steps of 5 % in reliability. As there is no local assessment, the option to create higher-reliability spatial subsets for these channels is not available as the desired reliability will only apply to the full area covered by the catalogue. We note that the PCCS2 survey S/N threshold at 857 GHz is substantially higher than the threshold applied to build the PCCS. We have improved the modelling of the real extragalactic sources for the injection reliability estimate for the PCCS2, which results in a shallower spectral index for the input source model and fewer injected sources at low S/N. This produces a more realistic, and lower, reliability estimate at a given S/N relative to the PCCS.

        <p>As an external check on the reliability of the PCCS2 we have exploited the catalogue of submillimetre sources extracted from the full Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS; Eales et al. 2010). The survey covers an area of about 550 deg 2 . A public catalogue is available only for the H-ATLAS Science Demonstration Phase field (covering 16 deg 2 ) so we have used, with permission, one which is yet unpublished and was released for internal use of the H-ATLAS consortium (Maddox et al. 2015;Valiante et al. 2015). Within the H-ATLAS fields, the PCCS2 catalogue contains 39, 44, and 121 sources at 353, 545, 857 GHz, respectively, while the PCCS2E contains two sources, both detected only at 857 GHz. We have identified, at each frequency, the PCCS2 with the H-ATLAS catalogue using a search radius equal to half the Planck FWHM. Increasing the search radius to one FWHM does not add any additional reliable counterparts. As expected, given the large surface density of H-ATLAS sources, at least one source is always present within the search radius. We have taken as reliable counterparts to Planck sources those with H-ATLAS flux densities within a factor of three of the Planck APERFLUX ones. Since the Herschel photometry does not extend to 353 GHz, to look for reliable counterparts at this frequency we have extrapolated the H-ATLAS flux densities, consistent with the spectral properties measured at higher frequencies. In the present, preliminary, version of the H-ATLAS catalogue, aperture corrections of flux densities for extended sources have been applied only for a fraction of the area. It is thus possible that some H-ATLAS flux densities of large galaxies have been strongly underestimated and are therefore missed as reliable counterparts to Planck sources by the flux-density criterion. To recover them we have looked for associations of Planck sources with large, nearby optical galaxies. In this way we have recovered five H-ATLAS counterparts at each of the Planck frequencies. We find 26, 38, and 112 reliable counterparts to PCCS2 sources at 353, 545, and 857 GHz, respectively, which translates into a reliability of 26/39 (67 %), 38/44 (86 %), and 112/121 (93 %).

        <p>Simulations For the HFI channels we characterize the accuracy of source photometry by comparing the native flux-density estimates (DETFLUX) of matched sources to the known flux densities of sources injected into the real maps. The photometric accuracy is a function of S/N, with faint detections affected by upward bias due to noise fluctuations. In the previous PCCS, at the higher HFI frequencies, the DETFLUX estimates were found to be biased low (Planck Collaboration XXVIII 2014). This has been corrected for the PCCS2. Tables 6 and7 show the DETFLUX bias per channel as well as the standard deviation of ∆ S /σ S , the difference between the input and recovered flux den- sities normalized by the uncertainty on the flux density, which would be unity for Gaussian noise.Simulations For the HFI channels we characterize the accuracy of source photometry by comparing the native flux-density estimates (DETFLUX) of matched sources to the known flux densities of sources injected into the real maps.

        <p>We next compare values derived from the four different methods of assessing flux densities. Figures 10,11,12,and 13 show the results for four Planck channels. These comparisons are made against APERFLUX. This flux estimation method is the simplest and makes the smallest number of assumptions about the data. However, DETFLUX has smaller uncertainties than APERFLUX, which may be seen in these figures by the upward curve toward lower APERFLUX values in the comparison with DETFLUX. This may be understood as there being a clear signal present in DETFLUX when the APERFLUX is compatible with noise. Figure 14 shows the comparison against DETFLUX for APERFLUX at 30, 70, and 143 GHz. In these plots, as expected, the curve disappears, and we see good agreement between the methods which becomes progressively noisier towards lower values of DETFLUX. For unresolved sources in regions where there is little non-Gaussianity present in the background, DETFLUX is the flux estimation method of choice, given its greater sensitivity. However, in regions of high non-Gaussian background emission, DETFLUX is less robust. This may been seen by the lack of consistency between DETFLUX and APERFLUX, in these figures, at least for the green and grey points representing sources which lie within 5 • of the Galactic plane. As the frequency increases so do the levels of non-Gaussian emission. In the comparison between DETFLUX and APERFLUX at 353 GHz, which only contains sources at the higher Galactic latitudes, there is a large degree of scatter. Indeed, at 353 GHz and above it is advisable to favour APERFLUX over DETFLUX. Interband Comparisons As an additional internal test, we compared PCCS2 flux densities at one band with those in neighbouring bands. We performed this comparison for the six lowest Planck channels. We began by selecting all PCCS2 sources at 70 GHz with the following restrictions: flux density, S (70) ≥ 0.9 Jy (virtually all such sources had S/N &gt;7); Galactic latitude, |b| ≥ 10 • ; and no evidence of extension. We then matched these with sources in the PCCS2 at 30, 44, 100, 143, and 217 GHz. Of the 203 sources, more than 99 % were detected at 30, 44, and 100 GHz as well as 70 GHz, and 97 % at 143 GHz. Since virtually all the sources had synchrotron spectra, with generally negative spectral indices, it is not surprising that only 90 % of the sources could be identified at 217 GHz. We note that some of the sources not found in the PCCS2 at 217 GHz did appear in the PCCS2E; these few sources, however, were not used in this internal test.We next compare values derived from the four different methods of assessing flux densities.

        <p>We used this merged catalogue to calculate spectral indices for each of the 203 sources. The spectral indices were then used to make the small colour-corrections to the flux density in each band for each source. For the colour-corrections at 30 GHz, we used the 30-44 spectral index and for 353 GHz, the 217-353 spectral index. For the other five bands, for band N, we used the spectral index found between bands N -1 and N + 1 (e.g., for 44 GHz, we used the 30-70 spectral index). The colourcorrections we used are tabulated in Planck Collaboration II (2015) and Planck Collaboration VII (2015).The amplitude of these corrections in a given Planck band ranges from ∼2.5 % at 70 GHz to less than ∼1 % at 30 GHz. For a given source, the precision of the colour-corrections was typically ∼ 0.2 %.We used this merged catalogue to calculate spectral indices for each of the 203 sources.

        <p>Next, we used the colour-corrected flux densities to recompute spectral indices for each source. These spectral indices were then used to predict a flux density for each source in frequency band N by assuming a constant spectral index between bands N -1 and N + 1. For instance, we interpolated between the 28.4 and 70.4 GHz flux densities to predict a 44.1 GHz flux density for each source, using the calculated spectral index for that source. These predictebyd values were then plotted against the actual (colour-corrected) measurements at 44.1 GHz. This oper- ation was repeated for 70, 100, 143, and 217 GHz. If the fluxdensity scales of Planck are consistent across bands and if the spectral index is constant as assumed, we expect to see lines of unit slope. In fact, the slopes were close to unity for all five bands tested, as shown in Table 9.Next, we used the colour-corrected flux densities to recompute spectral indices for each source.

        <p>We examined several different possibilities for the slight departures from unit slopes. First, we explored the possibility that Next, we investigated whether the statistically significant departures from unit slope in the plots of predicted versus measured flux could reasonably be explained by a breakdown in the assumption that the spectral index of the sources stayed constant from band N -1 to band N + 1. For instance, the measured slope at 70 GHz is 1.0125; that is, the measured 70 GHz flux densities are ∼2.55 % higher than we would find by interpolating between 44 and 100 GHz, assuming no change in the spectral index between 44 and 100 GHz. If instead we allow for spectral curvature, the small discrepancy can be reduced or eliminated. With the simplest assumption, a sharp change of spectral index, ∆α, at 70 GHz, we find that the small excess of measured over predicted flux can be explained by ∆α = -0.125 at 70 GHz. We performed similar calculations for this simple model for the other Planck bands; see Table 9. Spectral index changes of this magnitude are reasonable (electron ageing can account for a change in spectral index of ∼ -0.5); see Sect. 4 for plots of spectral index distributions for all sources in the PCCS2, not just those used in this analysis.We examined several different possibilities for the slight departures from unit slopes.

        <p>The calibration of Planck is precise, and we have demonstrated the internal consistency of the flux densities in Sect. 3.4.1. The calibration of Planck is also absolute in the sense that it depends only on the motion of the satellite and the 0.02 % accurate measurement of the CMB temperature Fixsen (2009). Consequently, comparing Planck flux densities to those measured by other instruments is actually a check on the accuracy of the latter. Indeed, Butler et al. (2015) have employed Planck measurements to refine the centimetre-wavelength flux-density scales used at the VLA and the ATCA. Here, we summarize the results of that study and of comparisons with other CMB and submillimetre instruments and missions.The calibration of Planck is precise, and we have demonstrated the internal consistency of the flux densities in Sect. 3.4.1.

        <p>The 30 and 44 GHz channels The comparison between Planck flux densities at 28.4 and 44.1 GHz and ground based observa- tions at 22.45, 28.45, and 43.34 GHz was based on observations carried out at the ATCA and the VLA in April and May 2013. Both instruments observed a set of strong, unresolved, unconfused radio sources also scanned by Planck in this time interval. These observations were part of a wider effort by Perley and Stevens (2015, in preparation) to compare the flux-density scales of the two interferometers, the VLA in the north and ATCA in the south. The Planck DETFLUX measurements were derived not from the PCCS2, which averages over the four years of LFI observations, but from a special map constructed using only data from 1 April to 30 June 2013. This was necessary in order to minimize the effects of source variability. Since the central frequencies of the Planck bands did not exactly match the frequen- 10 and Fig. 15. The Planck measurements are consistently slightly higher across all frequencies. These results are summarized in Butler et al. (2015), and described in greater detail in Partridge et al. (2015) where various tests of the validity of the results are presented. In particular, the effect of dropping sources found to have varied over the three-month period of the Planck observations is examined. The results in Table 10 are estimates derived from Butler et al. (2015). The discrepancies between the satellite and ground-based values lie close to or within the estimated error in the latter. For the flux-density scale of Perley &amp; Butler (2013), employed at the VLA, this uncertainty is estimated to be 5 %, and roughly the same level of precision may be assigned to the flux-density scale employed at ATCA. We also compared the ATCA and VLA measurements to PCCS2 30 and 44 GHz flux densities (averaged over 4 years) and found consistent results, for the same sources. As expected, source variability substantially increased the scatter. Excluding three manifestly variable sources, we find VLA/Planck = 0.96 ± 0.02 at 28.45 GHz and (VLA&amp;ATCA)/Planck = 0.93 ± 0.03 at 43.34 GHz. These are consistent with the more precise comparison described above. The 3% and 6% differences may be compared to the quoted 5% uncertainty in the flux density scales as given by Perley &amp; Butler (2013). The Metsähovi Observatory is continuously monitoring bright radio sources in the northern sky at 37 GHz (Teräsranta et al. 2004). From their sample, sources brighter than 1 Jy were selected and their flux densities averaged over the period of Planck observations used for the PCCS2 (Planck Intermediate results, in preparation); note that this period corresponds to the full duration of the Planck mission. Hence, the uncertainties in Fig. 16 reflect the variability of the sources during the Planck mission. The Planck measurements were colour-corrected and extrapolated to the Metsähovi frequency before the comparison. The Planck and Metsähovi flux densities agree at the 0.3 % and 0.1 % level, with an uncertainty of ±4 %, at 30-44 GHz and 30-70 GHz, respectively.The 30 and 44 GHz channels The comparison between Planck flux densities at 28.4 and 44.1 GHz and ground based observa- tions at 22.45, 28.45, and 43.34 GHz was based on observations carried out at the ATCA and the VLA in April and May 2013.

        <p>The 143 and 217 GHz channels Flux densities at 143 and 217 GHz from the earlier PCCS were compared to measurements made at the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) by Louis et al. (2014). We repeated those comparisons using the The multiple observations of each source have been averaged to a single flux density; the averaging was performed over the period of the full Planck mission, not just the epochs at which each source was observed by Planck. The uncertainties, therefore, reflect the variability of the sources instead of the flux-density accuracy of the measurements, which is of the order of a few mJy. new PCCS2 values, and extended the comparison to South Pole Telescope (SPT) flux densities from Mocanu et al. (2013). We employed the DETFLUX values from the PCCS2. As in Louis et al. (2014), the Planck flux densities were colour-corrected and extrapolated to the central frequencies of both ACT (147.6 and 217.6 GHz) and SPT (152.9 and 218.1 GHz), using the spectral index appropriate for each source. It is important to bear in mind that the ground-based measurements were in almost all cases far from simultaneous with those of Planck. Thus the variability of sources, virtually all AGN, caused significant scatter. In the case of the ACT equatorial sources, we had measurements from both the 2009 and the 2010 seasons. That allowed us to find and drop two manifestly variable sources. We also dropped two sources with thermal spectra. For SPT, Mocanu et al. (2013) present just a single flux density for each source, so in most cases we had no means of discovering and dropping sources that were variable. Four sources, however, were detected by all three experiments, ACT and SPT in 2008 and Planck integrated over the mission. Three of these were evidently variable (and are discussed further below). For the comparison between corrected Planck flux densities and those of ACT at 147.6 GHz, we were left with 58 sources in common. ACT flux densities were on average 0.97±0.03 times Planck's. At 217.6 GHz, fewer ACT sources (50) were detected by Planck, and we find ACT = 0.89±0.03 times Planck.The 143 and 217 GHz channels Flux densities at 143 and 217 GHz from the earlier PCCS were compared to measurements made at the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) by Louis et al.

        <p>We now consider the effect on these results of sources known to be variable. First, comparison of ACT measurements made in 2009 and 2010 showed that two sources varied strongly. Dropping them changed the 147.6 GHz slope to 0.95. On the other hand, if we drop the three variable sources detected by all three experiments, the slope goes to 0.98. If we drop all five sources for which we have direct evidence of variability, the slope at 147.6 GHz settles to 0.97±0.02. Since the exclusion of variable sources moves the slope both up and down in amplitude, we adopt 0.97±0.03 for the relation between ACT and Planck flux densities; ACT flux densities are ∼ 3 % lower than Planck's. At 217.6 GHz, if we drop the few sources for which we have direct evidence of variability, the slope changes to 0.96±0.03.We now consider the effect on these results of sources known to be variable.

        <p>Planck found fewer SPT sources (25 at 152.9 GHz and 30 at 218.1 GHz), and the scatter due to source variability was larger. If we include all sources, we again find the ground-based flux densities are lower than Planck's: 0.95±0.05 at 152.9 GHz and 0.88±0.05 at 218.1 GHz. If we now exclude the 3 sources that were seen to vary between 2008 and the later Planck mission, the SPT results become 0.99±0.05 at 152.9 GHz and 0.97±0.05 at 218.1 GHz. We adopt these values, all lying between 0.96 and 0.99, as evidence of good agreement between the ground-based and Planck flux density scales at 143 and 217 GHz. The small differences between the Planck flux density scales at these frequencies and those measured from the ground can be compared to the following uncertainties quoted for the ground based experiments: SPT, 1.6% and 2.4% calibration uncertainty in the maps at 150 and 220 GHz, respectively (Mocanu et al. 2013) and ACT, 6% uncertainty in the flux density scale at 148 GHz (Louis et al. 2014).Planck found fewer SPT sources (25 at 152.9 GHz and 30 at 218.1 GHz), and the scatter due to source variability was larger.

The small differences between the Planck flux density scales at these frequencies and those measured from the ground can be compared to the following uncertainties quoted for the ground based experiments: SPT, 1.6% and 2.4% calibration uncertainty in the maps at 150 and 220 GHz, respectively (Mocanu et al. 2013) and ACT, 6% uncertainty in the flux density scale at 148 GHz (Louis et al. 2014).</p>
        <p>The 857 GHz channel At this frequency, there are no other all-sky surveys available at matching frequencies against which the PCCS2 fluxes can be compared. However, the 350 µm channel of the SPIRE instrument (Griffin et al. 2010) on Herschel (Pilbratt et al. 2010) is a close match to the 857 GHz passband of Planck. Pointed observations of compact extragalactic targets obtained with SPIRE can thus be used to validate the flux density measurements made in the PCCS2. The most useful set of observations from SPIRE for our purposes are those from the Herschel Reference Survey (HRS) (Boselli et al. 2010), a survey of the far-infared and submillimetre properties of local bright galaxies. The published SPIRE photometry for this sample (Ciesla et al. 2012) uses either PSF fitting for sources unresolved by Herschel or apertures matched to the observed sizes of the sources in the Herschel maps. In both these cases the apertures used will be much smaller than the Planck beam. Since several of the HRS galaxies have nearby bright companions, and since other sources might be included in the large Planck beam, new flux density values were extracted for the HRS sources using apertures matched to the size of the Planck beams (Eales et al., private communication). This allows a direct comparison of the SPIRE 350 µm fluxes to the Planck 857 GHz fluxes for the same 141 objects. It should be noted that only 3 of these objects have not been flagged as EXTENDED by Planck. We should, therefore, not be surprised if the flux extraction methods which assume a single point-like source will be biased low. In Fig. 17 and Table 11 we show the results of this comparison for the four different flux extraction methods used in the PCCS2: DETFLUX, APERFLUX, PSFFLUX, and GAUFLUX. The best performing Planck flux-density extraction method is, perhaps not surprisingly, the method that most closely resembles the flux-density extraction method applied to the Herschel maps, namely APERFLUX, which shows good agreement between Herschel and Planck fluxes over the full range of source brightness. The worst performing method, in contrast, is DETFLUX, which shows an increased scatter, and an overall bias to lower Planck values for the brighter sources. This bias should be expected if the sources are not truly point-like. For a population of slightly extended sources we expect a noticeable bias low for the brighter sources, which disappears into the noise for fainter objects. This pattern of bias for the brighter sources which disappears once these sources are excluded is also seen for PSFFLUX. The increased scatter seen for the brighter sources with DETFLUX is likely due to errors in the recovered position. This is due to the relationship between the scale of the wavelet used and the pixel size in the maps. For this channel (857 GHz) the small beam size and the increased level of foregrounds in the map mean that the optimum scale for the wavelet is very narrow with respect to the map pixels. This makes the flux-density estimate extremely sensitive to errors in the recovered position of the source. This effect is most pronounced at this channel and for the brighter sources. A similar bias seen in GAUFLUX is a little more difficult to explain, but again may result from the assumption that sources are single and point-like. A double source, for instance, may pose difficulties in the flux-density estimation resulting in a bias low. We conclude that there is a good match between the PCCS2 flux densities at 857 GHz and Herschel flux densities in the matching 350 µm SPIRE band. We also conclude that for most purposes concerned with the flux-density measurement of compact sources like the galaxies discussed here, that APERFLUX is probably the most appropriate flux-density measure to use for the higher frequency channels.The 857 GHz channel At this frequency, there are no other all-sky surveys available at matching frequencies against which the PCCS2 fluxes can be compared.

        <p>To validate the polarization measurements in the PCCS2 and PCCS2E catalogues, we rely on simulations based on the injection of sources with known properties into the Planck polarization maps between 30 and 70 GHz and the FFP8 simulated maps (Planck Collaboration XII 2015) between 100 and 353 GHz. It should be noted that the injection of sources into the real maps has the advantage that many thousands of sources may be used to test the analysis, however this procedure does not simulate the leakage due to the bandpass mismatch. The FFP8 maps however do contain this effect although there are only hundreds rather than thousands of polarised sources. Both approaches, however, allow us to test the fidelity of the polarized flux densities and polarization angles produced by our analysis pipelines. They also allow us to compute the measures for the completeness and reliability of recovered polarization measurements. As the extraction of these measurements is non-blind, based on the positions provided by the analysis of the temperature maps, these terms for the polarization pipelines only have any meaning given that the source is real. We define the Polarization Photometric Completeness (PPC) as the percentage of polarized sources correctly identified as polarized above a given true polarized flux density, and Polarization Photometric Reliability (PPR) as the percentage of polarized sources whose polarized flux density is contained in Fig. 18.

        <p>A comparison between the LFI and HFI implementations of the common procedure for extracting the polarization measurements for the significantly polarized sources was performed. Figure 19 shows a comparison of the recovered polarized flux densities, for each implementation, and the true polarized flux density.

        <p>In order to assess the performance of the maximum likelihood estimator used to provide the polarization measurements in the three lowest Planck channels (IFCAPOL), we used Monte Carlo simulations. Point sources were simulated and convolved with the appropriate Gaussian effective beam from Table 2 for each channel, and were injected into HEALPix N side = 4096 maps. These maps were then degraded to N side = 1024 to match the pixelization of the LFI maps. These source maps were added to the Planck Release 2 Q and U maps. The sources were injected away from known bright radio sources. In all, 37 000 Fractional difference is defined as recovered minus true divided by the true value. These are the significantly polarized sources, as found by the common method, and the uncertainties associated with the best-fit estimates are ±3 σ error bars. Eddington bias is seen at lower polarized flux densities. sources in 50 flux-density bins were injected into the Q and U maps. The pipelines were run given the positions of these simulated sources, producing polarized flux density and polarization angle measurements. The results of the Monte Carlo simulations on the recovery of the polarized flux densitiesare shown in Fig. 20. We can see that the polarized flux-densities are recovered in an unbiased way for strongly polarized sources, and the faintest ones suffer from Eddington bias. Figure 21 shows the equivalent plot for the polarization angle and here we can see that the angle is recovered successfully for all channels, with increasing uncertainties towards fainter polarized flux densities. Based on these simulations, we computed the polarization photometric completeness and reliability, shown in Fig. 18. In the simulations we injected sources at all Galactic latitudes, and we did not apply any Galactic cut. We find that our catalogues are complete at the 90 % level at 200 mJy (polarized flux density) at 30 GHz, and at 400 mJy at 44 and 70 GHz. At the 600-700 mJy level the three catalogues are complete.

        <p>The recovery of the polarized flux densities from the FFP8 simulations, using the method common to both LFI and HFI, is shown in Fig. 22 for the PCCS2 and the PCCS2E. The PCCS2 polarized flux density estimates are reliable across the full range of flux densities and considerably more reliable than the PCCS2E. Given that the PCCS2E catalogue covers the Galactic plane region this is hardly unexpected. The polarized flux densities are unbiased over the range of values where the survey is complete, but for the fainter sources a positive bias is present, as expected from Eddington bias. Figure 23 shows the recovery of the polarization angle, which is unbiased over the full polarized flux-density range, although the errors in its recovery increase as the polarized flux density of the source decreases. This behaviour is exactly what is expected if our assumptions made in Sect. C.2 hold; that σ Q ≈ σ U , and that they are uncorrelated. Consider sources with a given polarization angle in the range of polarized flux densities which suffer from Eddington bias: the required upward noise fluctuations could come from Q or U or both. Once the polarization angle is evaluated, if our assumptions hold, then the average value found for the angle will be unbiased but its dispersion will be much larger than for the brighter sources. In Fig. 23 we also see that the measurements in the PCCS2E are again less reliable than the PCCS2.The recovery of the polarized flux densities from the FFP8 simulations, using the method common to both LFI and HFI, is shown in Fig. 22 for the PCCS2 and the PCCS2E.

        <p>The limited number of polarimetric millimetre surveys, the small number of bright Planck sources with a high significance in polarization, and the fact that the majority of polarized sources are variable, makes it difficult to validate the Planck polarized flux densities with external datasets.The limited number of polarimetric millimetre surveys, the small number of bright Planck sources with a high significance in polarization, and the fact that the majority of polarized sources are variable, makes it difficult to validate the Planck polarized flux densities with external datasets.</p>
        <p>One of the objects from the catalogue that we have studied in detail is Tau A, also known as M1 or the Crab Nebula. This object is resolved in the higher Planck channels and may not be the best source for validation at these frequencies, but it is the brightest compact source in polarization in Planck and has been thoroughly studied in other experiments. In Table 12 we compare the total intensity and polarized flux densities, polarization fraction, and polarization position angle for Tau A with measurements from WMAP (Weiland et al. 2011) and the IRAM 30 m telescope at 89 GHz (Aumont et al. 2010). In general, it is assumed that the polarization position angle of Tau A is constant across the frequency range of interest, up to at least 353 GHz. In Table 12 one can see that the Planck polarization position angles (as measured by the maximum likelihood filtering method and by aperture photometry) are significantly different from those of WMAP and IRAM at some frequencies. We have investigated these discrepancies and found that there are multiple factors in LFI and HFI affecting our measurements of the position angles of Tau A that deserve further attention.One of the objects from the catalogue that we have studied in detail is Tau A, also known as M1 or the Crab Nebula.

        <p>First, at the position of the Tau A in the U Stokes maps one can see a small spurious signal that is affecting the angle measurements. For this object, most of the polarized signal is in the Q Stokes map, and U has a very small contribution to the total polarized flux density (quadrature sum of Q and U). However, as shown in Table 12, when we calculate the polarization position angle with either method, the contribution from the spurious signal has the effect of changing the position angles by up to 5 • from the -88. • 2 measured at IRAM (Aumont et al. 2010). This spurious signal has been introduced by the complex cross-terms in the polarized beams, which are normally expected to be very small and below the map noise level. In an attempt to remove this effect, we have produced maps where we have deconvolved the beam and fitted for spurious signals. Results for LFI frequencies, from the 
            <rs type="software">ArtDeco</rs> map-making pipeline in the LFI DPC, are shown in column 7 of Table 12. These new measures of position angle agree with the expected value from IRAM and WMAP. However, we caution that these new maps are under development and the measurements should be used with caution. There is an ongoing effort, not yet completed, to generate a similar set of maps for the HFI frequencies to understand whether similar spurious signals affect the HFI polarization angle measurements.
        </p>
        <p>The tests that we have carried out with the new LFI maps indicate that the polarized flux densities and angles of the other sources in the catalogue are mostly unaffected, but some sources with high polarized flux density may be marginally affected.The tests that we have carried out with the new LFI maps indicate that the polarized flux densities and angles of the other sources in the catalogue are mostly unaffected, but some sources with high polarized flux density may be marginally affected.</p>
        <p>Second, the angular size of Tau A measured with IRAM at 89 GHz (Aumont et al. 2010) shows that it will be slightly resolved by Planck in the HFI channels. This could have an impact on the flux densities and polarization position angles measured with both the filtering method and with aperture photometry. In particular, the filtering method assumes that the sources are unresolved, so the flux densities derived with this method should be regarded as lower limits if the source is extended. In the case of aperture photometry, the integration radius that we use in HFI is too small for a source as large asTau A. We have increased the aperture radii to 2 FWHM 2 + θ 2 Tau A , where θ Tau A = 4 , and recomputed the angles for the four HFI channels with polarization capabilities. This improves the agreement between the HFI position-angle measurements and those from WMAP and IRAM, except at 353 GHz. The results are shown in column 7 of Table 12.Second, the angular size of Tau A measured with IRAM at 89 GHz (Aumont et al. 2010) shows that it will be slightly resolved by Planck in the HFI channels.

        <p>Third, as shown in Planck Collaboration VI (2015) and Planck Collaboration VIII (2015), different methods have been used in LFI and HFI for correcting the frequency maps for a global leakage signal from total intensity into polarization due to the bandpass mismatch. In practice, this means that the LFI frequency maps have not been corrected whereas the HFI have. The global bandpass corrections applied to the maps are not the same as the local corrections that we apply for point sources, which depend on the spectrum of each source (see Appendix C). However, even though our techniques to extract the flux densities of the sources in the Q and U maps will remove most, if not all, of the global correction if the sources are point-like, this may not be true for extended sources. To test this, we have extracted the polarization position angles from the HFI maps where the global bandpass correction had not been applied. The results are shown in Table 12 and in Fig. 24, where we compare the polarization position angles from WMAP and IRAM with the new measurements from Planck. The recovered angles between 100 and 217 GHz are very similar to the case where the global bandpass mismatch had been applied, except for 353 GHz where the new angle is in much better agreement with the other Planck, WMAP, and IRAM measurements.Third, as shown in Planck Collaboration VI (2015) and Planck Collaboration VIII (2015), different methods have been used in LFI and HFI for correcting the frequency maps for a global leakage signal from total intensity into polarization due to the bandpass mismatch.

        <p>These analyses show the complexity of the Planck maps in polarization, particularly for bright extended objects like Tau A where we had to fit and remove the spurious signal in the LFI, increase the integration aperture radii in the HFI, and remove the global bandpass correction at 353 GHz in order to achieve a ±2 • consistency in polarization position angle between Planck and WMAP or IRAM. Tau A is the only very bright polarized source in our maps, and the limited amount of polarization information available at Planck frequencies for other sources limits our ability to conclude that the polarization angles of the rest of the sources in the catalogue are not affected by these issues. Therefore, as in the case of Tau A, the polarization position angles should be used with caution. In future releases of the Planck products we will revisit this issue.These analyses show the complexity of the Planck maps in polarization, particularly for bright extended objects like Tau A where we had to fit and remove the spurious signal in the LFI, increase the integration aperture radii in the HFI, and remove the global bandpass correction at 353 GHz in order to achieve a ±2 • consistency in polarization position angle between Planck and WMAP or IRAM.

        <p>In addition, we have cross-matched the Plateau de Bure interferometer (PdBI) polarimetric survey of 86 active galactic nuclei at 100 GHz (Trippe et al. 2010) with the Planck 70 and 100 GHz PCCS2 catalogues, finding two sources common (PKS 0851+202 and 3C 273). For these sources we see good agreement: the Planck polarized flux densities are 509±106 mJy and 515±102 mJy at 70 GHz, and 566±38 mJy and 503±36 mJy at 100 GHz, as compared with 561 ± 156 mJy and 418 ± 118 mJy measured by PdBI, for PKS 0851+202 and 3C273, respectively.

Note: In the Planck channels, the statistical error bars in the polarization position angle of Tau A do not reflect the true uncertainties of these measurements. In addition to the statistical error, a 0. • 5 systematic error has to be added to the LFI measurements (Planck Collaboration III 2015) and 0. • 62 to the HFI measurements (Planck Collaboration VIII 2015) as indicated by the second ± symbol. Similarly, the WMAP errors in the polarized position angle are statistical and a systematic error of 1. • 5 has been added (Weiland et al. 2011). Additionally, we have compared the polarized flux densities found for 3C 273, the only bright source in polarization in the sample of sources observed simultaneously with the VLA and Planck in the spring of 2013. The Planck 30 GHz polarized flux density (colour-corrected for comparison with the VLA) was 854 ± 82 mJy, while the VLA observed 843 ± 50 mJy. At 44 GHz the Planck polarized flux density was 567 ± 131 mJy, as compared with 623 ± 70 mJy seen by the VLA.In addition, we have cross-matched the Plateau de Bure interferometer (PdBI) polarimetric survey of 86 active galactic nuclei at 100 GHz (Trippe et al. 2010) with the Planck 70 and 100 GHz PCCS2 catalogues, finding two sources common (PKS 0851+202 and 3C 273).

        <p>The several internal and external validation tests described in Sect. 3 allow us to assess reliability and completeness as a function of flux density in each Planck band. These tests also allow us to assess the accuracy of positions and flux densities tabulated in the PCCS2 and PCCS2E catalogues. With the possible exception of a 6% or 1-1.5 σ difference between Planck flux densities measured in the noisy 44 GHz map and those measured from the ground, no clearly significant discrepancies in any of these quantities was found. We thus argue that both positions and flux densities in the PCCS2 are valid within the tabulated statistical errors in total intensity. Note, however, that we have no direct test of flux densities scales at 353 and 545 GHz. Regarding the measurements in polarization, the number of external surveys available at these frequencies in polarization is very limited. In particular, we have compared the flux densities in polarization of Tau A, the Crab nebula, with recent measurements of WMAP and other high resolution instruments on the ground and we have not found significant discrepancies in the polarized flux densities. However, we find a small discrepancy in the measurement of the polarization angle of Tau A in some of the Planck channels. For this object, one of the brightest compact sources in polarization, there is small amount of signal in the U maps at the position of the source, where little or no signal is expected for this object. This signal, much smaller than the signal in the Q map, does not have an effect in the measurement of the total polarized flux density since the Q and U flux densities are added in quadrature as shown in Eq. 1, but it can explain the discrepancy in the polarization angle with respect to external measurements. Since our statistical errors do not account for this small systematic effect, when we propagate the errors in the measurements of the polarized flux density into the errors in the measurement of the polarization angle, the errors that we obtain can be underestimated.The several internal and external validation tests described in Sect. 3 allow us to assess reliability and completeness as a function of flux density in each Planck band.

        <p>In Fig. 1, we displayed a comparison of the sensitivity of the PCCS2 with the PCCS, the ERCSC and several other CMB projects. For the PCCS2 we define the sensitivity to be the flux density at the 90 % completeness limit for each Planck channel. The improvements between the PCCS2 and the PCCS are most apparent for the LFI channels. This is to be expected given the larger increase of data for LFI than for HFI in the full mission. Additionally, for the higher frequency channels the foregrounds are a significant noise source for the detection of compact sources; the reduction of the instrumental noise resulting from longer integration may therefore not increase the depth of the catalogue as much as might be expected. Finally, the estimated sensitivity of the catalogue is worse at 857 GHz (Sect. 3.2.3), owing to the improved understanding of the reliability.In Fig. 1, we displayed a comparison of the sensitivity of the PCCS2 with the PCCS, the ERCSC and several other CMB projects.

The numbers of sources in the extragalactic zone in general increase between the PCCS and the union of the PCCS2 and PCCS2E. For the highest three frequency channels, the union of the PCCS2 and PCCS2E catalogues contains many more sources than the PCCS due to the lower S/N threshold applied in the PCCS2E than in the Galactic region of the PCCS. In the extragalactic zone, we compare the average uncertainty on the flux density and the 90 % completeness. We can see that the PCCS2 has lower uncertainties and is consequently more complete than the PCCS, except at 857 GHz where the completeness has dropped (see Sect. 3.2.3).Table 13 compares the characteristics of the PCCS2, the PCCS2E, and the PCCS.

        <p>the "above or below criterion" will include as a subset those sources meeting the more stringent "above and below" criterion. A source is considered to be matched if the positions are closer than the larger FWHM of the two channels. A catalogue was extracted from the IRIS 100 µm map (Miville-Deschênes &amp; Lagache 2005) using the MHW2 pipeline, and used as the neighbouring channel above 857 GHz. The IRIS mask, which removes around 2.1 % of the sky, was applied to the 857 GHz catalogue before doing this comparison, and this reduces the number of sources in the union to 47 156, a decrease of about 2.1 %. The number of matches given for the 857 GHz channel only includes sources outside the IRIS mask. For the 30 GHz channel, the matches were evaluated using only the channel above, 44 GHz.

        <p>Figure 25 shows histograms of the spectral indices obtained via the non-blind flux density extraction from the neighbouring channels. As expected, the high-frequency channels (545 and 857 GHz) are dominated by dusty galaxies and the lowfrequency ones are dominated by synchrotron sources, with the change in the dominant source population occurring between 217 and 353 GHz. It can also be seen that there is a shift in the peak of the histogram between the top two panels, between 30-44 GHz and 44-70 GHz and above. The reason for this is a steepening of the spectral indices of radio sources that has been seen previously (Massardi et al. 2009;Planck Collaboration XIII 2011;Planck Collaboration XXVIII 2014).Figure 25 shows histograms of the spectral indices obtained via the non-blind flux density extraction from the neighbouring channels.

        <p>Figure 26 shows colour-colour plots for sources from the PCCS2 and the PCCS2E. The positions in the catalogue at the common frequency in the colour-colour plot are used to perform a non-blind extraction of the flux densities from the maps at the neighbouring frequencies. These are used together with the common frequency-channel flux densities to construct the colourcolour plot. The common frequency in the top panel is 217 GHz, and here we can see the two populations which are also seen in the spectral-index histogram (Fig. 25), for the PCCS2. Also apparent is the domination of the PCCS2E at this frequency by thermal sources, since the PCCS2E includes sources in the Galactic plane. The bottom panel uses the IRIS map and the Planck 545 GHz maps for the non-blind extraction of flux densities at the locations of the 857 GHz catalogues. The PCCS2 colour-colour distribution is consistent with a population of cold sources with a narrow range of temperatures (∼ 10-40 K) in the range of spectral indices in Fig. 25. The larger dispersion of values in the PCCS2E by comparison is indicative of the greater noise levels in the region of sky corresponding to the PCCS2E as well as a broader distribution of temperatures for the sources.Figure 26 shows colour-colour plots for sources from the PCCS2 and the PCCS2E.

        <p>The PCCS2 supersedes previous Planck compact source catalogues (ERCSC and PCCS) because it has been produced using the full mission data and the latest processing and calibration pipelines. Since the three sets of catalogues have been produced from the analysis of maps that average different amounts of data, some idea of the variability of the sources could be obtained from the comparison of the three, although for this purpose it would be better to analyse the single survey maps, the time ordered data or the user specified time interval maps that can be obtained from the Planck Legacy Archive.The PCCS2 supersedes previous Planck compact source catalogues (ERCSC and PCCS) because it has been produced using the full mission data and the latest processing and calibration pipelines.

        <p>As noted earlier, the aim of the PCCS2 is to provide as complete a list as possible of Planck sources with a reasonable, and user-adjustable degree of reliability. The criteria used to include or exclude candidate sources differ from channel to channel and in different parts of the sky; they also are based on different S/N levels between channels and as a function of position on the sky. These differences were consequences of our desire to make the catalogue as complete as possible, yet maintain &gt; 80 % reliability. These differences have to be taken into account when using the PCCS2 for statistical studies.As noted earlier, the aim of the PCCS2 is to provide as complete a list as possible of Planck sources with a reasonable, and user-adjustable degree of reliability.

        <p>We now turn to several specific cautions and comments for users of the PCCS2 and PCCS2E.We now turn to several specific cautions and comments for users of the PCCS2 and PCCS2E.</p>
        <p>Bandpass corrections to polarization: For many sources in the three lowest Planck frequency channels, the bandpass correction of the Q and U flux densities is not negligible. Even though we have attempted to correct for this effect on a source by source basis and have propagated this uncertainty into the error bars on the polarized flux densities and polarization angles, there is still room for improvement. This can be seen in the residual leakage present at the position of Tau A in the Stokes U maps. It is anticipated that there will be future updates to the LFI catalogues once the bandpass corrections and errors have been improved.Bandpass corrections to polarization: For many sources in the three lowest Planck frequency channels, the bandpass correction of the Q and U flux densities is not negligible.

        <p>Variability: At radio frequencies, up to and including 217 GHz, many of the extragalactic sources are variable. The measurements of their flux densities provided in the catalogues are, however, averages over the full Planck mission. It should be noted therefore that follow-up observations of these sources may show significant differences from those provided.Variability: At radio frequencies, up to and including 217 GHz, many of the extragalactic sources are variable.

        <p>Contamination from CO: At infrared/submillimetre frequencies (100 GHz and above), the Planck bandpasses straddle energetically significant CO lines. The effect is the most significant at 100 GHz, where the line might contribute more than 50 % of the measured flux density for some Galactic sources.Contamination from CO: At infrared/submillimetre frequencies (100 GHz and above), the Planck bandpasses straddle energetically significant CO lines. The effect is the most significant at 100 GHz, where the line might contribute more than 50 % of the measured flux density for some Galactic sources.</p>
        <p>Photometry: Each source has multiple estimates of flux density: DETFLUX, APERFLUX, GAUFLUX and 
            <rs type="software">PSFFLUX</rs>, as defined above. The evaluation of 
            <rs type="software">APERFLUX</rs> makes the smallest number of assumptions about the data and hence is the most robust, especially in regions of high non-Gaussian background emission, but it may have larger uncertainties than the other methods. Hence, a general recommendation for which estimate to use for unresolved sources would be DETFLUX for 30 to 217 GHz and APERFLUX for 353 to 857 GHz. Note that for a specific source the nature of the local background will influence the best choice for the flux estimator. For bright resolved sources, 
            <rs type="software">GAUFLUX</rs> is recommended, with the caveat that it may not be robust for sources close to the Galactic plane due to the strong backgrounds. In the PCCS2 and PCCS2E we provide polarized flux densities for two methods, one obtained from the measured flux densities in the filtered maps of Q and U and the other obtained from the measured flux densities on the unfiltered maps of Q and U using aperture photometry. Both methods agree for the brightest sources, but due to large noise level in the unfiltered maps as compared with the filtered ones, for weaker sources the polarized flux densities obtained with the filtering method are more robust. In addition, we have found that at the position of very bright sources in polarization one can see a spurious signal introduced by the complex beams in polarization. This spurious signal is small compared with the flux density of the sources, but in cases like Tau A where most of the signal is in the Q map, this signal can have an impact in the flux density measured in the U map, which is particularly important when calculating the polarization position angle. For this reason position angles should be used with caution.

        <p>The absolute calibration uncertainties of Planck are well below 1 % for 30-353 GHz (Planck Collaboration V 2015; Planck Collaboration VIII 2015), while for 545 and 857 GHz the absolute calibration uncertainty is &lt; 7 % which is primarily due to a 5 % systematic uncertainty arising from the planet models (Planck Collaboration VIII 2015). This systematic uncertainty is not included in the internal validation (not simulated) or in the comparison with Herschel data (which use the same planet models; Griffin et al. 2010). In addition, there is a 0.5 and 0.3 degree systematic uncertainty in the polarization position angles in the LFI and HFI, respectively.The absolute calibration uncertainties of Planck are well below 1 % for 30-353 GHz (Planck Collaboration V 2015; Planck Collaboration VIII 2015), while for 545 and 857 GHz the absolute calibration uncertainty is &lt; 7 % which is primarily due to a 5 % systematic uncertainty arising from the planet models (Planck Collaboration VIII 2015).

        <p>Colour-correction: The flux-density estimates have not been colour-corrected because this implies fixing the spectral index that describes each source, and the user may want to apply a colour-correction based on an spectral index determined with a higher-resolution experiment. In the Planck Legacy Archive Planck Collaboration: Second Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources there is a tool to apply the colour-correction to the source flux density with a user supplied spectral index. Colour-corrections are described in Planck Collaboration II (2015) and Planck Collaboration VII (2015). Note that the term bandpass correction in this paper refers to the correction required due to the mismatch in the bandpass between orthogonally polarized detectors and not to the colour-correction of the flux density in Stokes I.Colour-correction: The flux-density estimates have not been colour-corrected because this implies fixing the spectral index that describes each source, and the user may want to apply a colour-correction based on an spectral index determined with a higher-resolution experiment.

        <p>Cirrus/ISM: The upper bands of HFI could be contaminated by apparent sources associated with Galactic interstellar medium features (ISM) or cirrus. The values of the parameters CIRRUS N and SKY BRIGHTNESS can be used as indicators of contamination. CIRRUS N can be used to flag sources that might be clustered together and thereby associated with ISM structure. In order to provide some indications of the range of values of these parameters which could indicate contamination, we compared the properties of the IRAS-identified and non-IRAS-identified sources for both the PCCS2 and the PCCS2E, outside the Galactic plane. At Galactic latitudes |b| &gt; 20 • , we can use the RIFSCz (Wang et al. 2014) to provide a guide to the likely nature of sources.Cirrus/ISM: The upper bands of HFI could be contaminated by apparent sources associated with Galactic interstellar medium features (ISM) or cirrus.

        <p>We compare the PCCS2 857 GHz catalogue and the PCCS2E 857 GHz catalogue with the IRAS sources in the RIFSCz using a 3 arcmin matching radius. Of the 4891 sources in the PCCS2 857 GHz catalogue, 3094 have plausible IRAS counterparts while 1797 do not. Examination of histograms of the CIRRUS N and SKY BRIGHTNESS parameters in the PCCS2 show that these two classes of objects behave rather differently. The IRAS-identified sources have a peak sky brightness at about 1 MJy sr -1 . The non-IRAS-identified sources have a bimodal distribution with a slight peak at 1 MJy sr -1 and a second peak at about 2.6 MJy sr -1 . Both distributions have a long tail, but the non-IRAS-Identified tail is much longer. On this basis, sources with SKY BRIGHTNESS &gt; 4 MJy sr -1 should be treated with caution. In contrast non-IRAS-identified sources with SKY BRIGHTNESS &lt; 1.4 MJy.sr -1 are likely reliable. Examination of their sky distribution, for example, shows that many such sources lie in the IRAS coverage gaps. The CIRRUS N flag tells a similar story. Both IRAS-identified and IRAS non-identified sources have a peak CIRRUS N value of 2, but the non-identified sources have a far longer tail. Very few IRAS-identified sources have a value &gt; 8 but many unidentified sources do.

Of the 9235 PCCS2E 857 GHz sources that are not identified with an IRAS source and that lie in the region |b| &gt; 20 , we can predict the number of unidentified sources in each zone and compare this to the values we have.

        <p>The Second Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources has been produced using the Planck full mission data. The catalogue lists sources detected in total intensity in each of its nine frequency bands between 30 and 857 GHz and polarization measurements at the positions of these sources for seven of the frequencies, between 30 and 353 GHz. Its format has changed with respect to the ERCSC and the PCCS. We have divided the catalogue into two, the PCCS2 and PCCS2E based on our ability to provide a measure of the reliability of each source detected at 100 GHz and above, where the available external catalogues of compact sources are not enough to fully assess the reliability of the detections. Sources located inside the defined Galactic plane masks and/or sitting along dusty filamentary structures as defined in the cirrus masks are in the PCCS2E. This is because the uncertainties in the number counts of the Galactic sources and the difficulty of simulating the diffuse dust emission near the beam scale in the higher frequency channels do not allow us to achieve the necessary consistency between the catalogues of input and detected sources in our reliability assessments.The Second Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources has been produced using the Planck full mission data.

        <p>Given the increase in the volume of data between the nominal mission and the full mission, and the improvements in the data processing and calibration of the frequency channel maps, the PCCS2 supersedes previous Planck catalogues. The new catalogue is more complete than the PCCS, in particular for the LFI channels, due to the large increase in the data available, eight sky surveys as compared with the two and a half sky surveys of PCCS. In addition, improvements have been made in some of the techniques used to perform the photometry analysis, and in the reliability assessment of the catalogues. The completeness of the 857 GHz channel, however, has not improved. This is due to improvements in the reliability assessment, which resulted in a higher S/N threshold being applied in the formation of this catalogue. It should be noted, however, that the quality of the PCCS2 catalogue at this channel is better than that of the earlier PCCS due to its greater reliability.Given the increase in the volume of data between the nominal mission and the full mission, and the improvements in the data processing and calibration of the frequency channel maps, the PCCS2 supersedes previous Planck catalogues.

        <p>The division of the HFI catalogues into the PCCS2 and PCCS2E has allowed the addition of a parameter in the PCCS2 catalogue that will allow a user to define subsets of the catalogue with higher reliabilities than the target integral reliability of 80 %. Associated maps are provided that will allow the user to evaluate the completeness of their chosen reliability subset, or indeed of the catalogue as a whole. This added functionality gives the users of the PCCS2 the option of extracting high-reliability sub-catalogues, and, in addition, provides a much more complete full catalogue, allowing studies of more sources and to fainter flux densities. There are ongoing efforts in the Planck Collaboration to produce multi-frequency catalogues that will complement the PCCS2; when completed, these will be available in the Planck Legacy Archive.The division of the HFI catalogues into the PCCS2 and PCCS2E has allowed the addition of a parameter in the PCCS2 catalogue that will allow a user to define subsets of the catalogue with higher reliabilities than the target integral reliability of 80 %.

        <p>To get the proper sampling by MCMC chain it is necessary to define the optimal step size in the parameter space. This determination is complex since there are more than 100 000 sources in the catalogue to process; it would be impossible to adjust every MCMC chain as it would take an excessive amount of time to try several values of the sampling step using an iterative approach. Hence we decided to use analytical approximation for the errors of most of the Gaussian profile parameters, following Hagen &amp; Dereniak (2008). We used an analytical approximation for the separable 2D Gaussian profile model; the errors are derived for five parameters: position coordinates, flux density, and two non-equal width values. The calculated errors were used to find the value of the step size in the parameter space to start the MCMC sampler, which delivered the error on the tilt angle. This combined technique allowed us to avoid most of the problems related to undersampled or oversampled MCMC chains.To get the proper sampling by MCMC chain it is necessary to define the optimal step size in the parameter space.

        <p>The results of the Gaussian fit were compared with the MHW2 positions and flux densities for a test set of sources with known parameters. The Planck Release 2 100 GHz map with injected sources and cold cores was used to check the 2D Gaussian fitting algorithm. The cold cores were modelled as 2D Gaussian profiles with uniformly distributed random orientation angle. The major FWHM was in the range from 4. 5 to 19 , and the ellipticity parameter, e = FWHM major /FWHM minor , varied from 1 (circular source) to 7 (highly elliptical source). All sources were uniformly distributed across the sky. It is clear that Gaussian fitting is preferable for extended objects like cold cores, giving more accurate flux densities as well as recovering the actual source shape and orientation. We compare the polarized flux densities of sources from the two sets of maps. A suitable quantity for assessing the size of the leakage is the difference between the polarized flux density from the maps with the leakage, S bpm , and that from the maps without the leakage, S nobpm , normalized by the uncertainty due to the noise, σ, The size of the effect depends on the differences between the individual bolometer bandpasses and the average frequency channel bandpass; they are smallest for the 217 GHz channel. For all channels the effect of the leakage is smaller than 1 σ for most sources. The mean value of ∆ gives the average bias on the polarized flux density measurements. It is smaller than 0.06 σ for all four channels. Therefore we conclude that the effect is small and can safely be ignored.The results of the Gaussian fit were compared with the MHW2 positions and flux densities for a test set of sources with known parameters.

        <p>where N -1 is the inverse power-spectrum of the background of the patch-map, and ψ(η) is the beam transfer function as function of the bidimensional spatial frequency vector, η. The maximum-likelihood estimator employed for the extraction of the Q and U signals was PowellSnakes (PwS; Carvalho et al. 2012Carvalho et al. , 2009)). The PwS likelihood assumes the background is a realization of a homogeneous Gaussian random field, with a known power-spectrum, which is a good assumption for small, flat patches cut from the Q and U maps. The PwS package has been extensively tested and used inside the Planck Collaboration and is known to deliver robust and accurate estimates (Planck Collaboration VII 2011;Planck Collaboration VIII 2011;Planck 
            <rs type="creator">Collaboration</rs> XXIX 2014). The flux densities in the Q and U maps can be either positive or negative. In order to reduce systematic effects, which could be induced by the ancillary steps of the likelihood evaluation such as the estimation of the background power-spectrum of the patch-map, we perform the same estimation procedure on both the patch-map and its negative, and the average of the two flux-density estimates is taken. This procedure helps in stabilizing the polarization signal, especially when tackling regions with complex backgrounds. Equivalent estimates of Q and Û, and their uncertainties, can be obtained using an aperture-photometry estimator. The aperture-photometry estimator is robust to deviations from the likelihood data modele.g., extended sources, background deviations from Gaussianity, or variations in the beam shape -at the cost of slightly larger error bars. For both estimators the criterion for the acceptance of a putative detection was such that P had to be 99.99 % significant with regard to the null-hypothesis, which is well described by a Rayleigh distribution when the assumption is made that σ Q ≈ σ U , and that these errors are uncorrelated. In the case of acceptance, the polarization angle estimate, Θ, is evaluated using Eq. 2. The Q and Û uncertainties are propagated onto the P and Θ estimates. This is done by assuming the uncertainties are normally distributed and the error-bars are small compared with the measured quantities. This approximation holds very well given the high significance threshold we have chosen.

        <p>Data from a number of bolometers are combined to make the HFI polarized frequency maps. Mismatch between the bandpasses of the bolometers causes leakage from intensity to polarization for any source of emission which has a non-CMB spectrum. Small uncertainties in the measured transmission for each bolometer may lead to large uncertainties in the estimates of the bandpass mismatch leakage (Planck Collaboration VIII 2015), so it is difficult to make an accurate prediction of the leakage for compact sources. Instead we use the FFP8 simulations (Planck Collaboration XII 2015) to assess the effect of the leakage. Two sets of FFP8 maps have been generated.

PwSPOL permits a proper statistical characterization of fainter polarization signals and is therefore able to provide a deeper and more complete catalogue without any loss of reliability, as is shown in Sect. 3.5. An additional benefit of PwSPOL is that it provides a qualitative assessment about an even fainter population of polarized sources which could be valuable as targets for follow-up observations. It does this by splitting the non-detections into two separate groups: clear non-detections, where the polarized flux density posterior peaks at no-signal, and marginal detections, where the posterior does not peak at no-signal, but this possibility is still inside the 95 % HPD region of the posterior distribution. In Fig . C.3 we compare the histograms of the polarized flux-density measurements in the PCCS2 found with each approach. The distribution of polarized flux densities in the 353 GHz channel does not follow the same pattern as the other HFI channels. This is due to the much shallower completeness (see Sect. 3.5) of this channel as compared with the others. Although reliable, the polarized flux-density measurements of this marginal set are expected to be biased high as result of Eddington bias and therefore not suitable for any statistical analysis.We shall refer to this set of measurements as the PowellSnakes marginal polarization (PwSPOL) dataset.
