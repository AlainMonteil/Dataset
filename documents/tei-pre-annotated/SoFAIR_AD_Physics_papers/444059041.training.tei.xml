        <p>Transplanting the concept of topological phase transitions in fermionic systems to photonics has recently attracted enormous interest. [1][2][3] In contrast to conventional photonic defect states that are sensitive to perturbations, edge states from two topologically distinct regions in photonic topological insulators (PTIs) are robust against local perturbations and immune to back scattering, which could lead to intriguing and unexpected photonic devices and functionalities for robust electromagnetic wave transport and processing. [4][5][6][7] Implementations of PTIs vary considerably and several schemes have been developed. For example, photonic analogue of a quantum Hall topological insulator was first achieved in the microwave regime using gyromagnetic materials with a strong magnetic field applied to break the time-reversal symmetry. 8 Later, a number of proposals have been put forward to realize photonic topological transport free of external fields by temporal modulation of photonic crystals to mimic timereversal-symmetry breaking. [9][10][11][12] A subwavelength-scale PTI approach via pseudo-time-reversal symmetry in all-dielectric photonic crystals was recently proposed 13 and experimentally verified from visible wavelengths to microwave regime.

        <p>In addition to above passive PTIs researches, a considerable effort has been made towards the study of non-Hermitian PTIs by engaging edge states with optical nonlinearity to enable topological lasing. In contrast to the conventional laser technologies, which are generally sensitive to cavity deformations caused by fabrication imperfections and fluctuations, topological insulator laser cavities are potentially immune to certain cavity defects with higher lasing efficiency attributed to the unique characteristics of nontrivial edge states. Topological insulator laser was first experimentally reported in magneto-optical photonic crystals pumped by a static magnetic field to break time-reversal symmetry. 29 Although this approach allows nonreciprocal lasing from topological cavities of arbitrary geometries, it produces narrow topological bandgap due to weak magneto-optic effect in optical regime. Non-magnetic topologically protected edge-mode lasing was later proposed and implemented by nontrivial semiconductor ring-resonator arrays, and high efficiency single mode lasing that is robust to cavity defects/disorders was reported. 30,31 The one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) hamiltonian model is another popular approach to generate edge states and various types of SSH lasing devices have been recently demonstrated based on micro-ring resonators, 32,33 electrically injected Fabry-Perot chain, 34 semiconductor pillar arrays, 35 and photonic crystal nanocavities. 36,37 Very recently, a topological single mode laser based on bulk topological effect was reported. 38 A topological laser arising from the valley Hall edge state was theoretically suggested. 39 The electrically pumped topological laser with valley edge modes was first experimentally achieved in THz regime using quasi-hexagonal photonic crystals. 40 In this paper, we propose a new kind of all-dielectric photonic topological laser in telecommunication region based on Kagome valley-hall photonic-crystals (KVPs) that consist of hexagonal lattice with primitive cells containing three nanoholes in compound semiconductor membrane. Our analytical and numerical investigations demonstrate that the proposed KVPs concept can lift degeneracy at K point with geometrical perturbation and open broad photonic bandgaps. Valley-dependent edge states and topologically robust transport with subwavelength scale confinement are observed at the interface between two perturbed KVPs with different valley Chern numbers. We further construct topological laser cavities with triangular geometry and explore pumping and lasing dynamics of the topological cavities by means of a four-level two-electron model. Our demonstration of lasing from the proposed KVPs scheme could provide opportunities for engineering topological edge states for various passive and active photonic integrated devices and systems.

        <p>topologically protected light propagation with out-of-plane confinement. It is worth noting that the edge states can be categorized into two regions: region I (vp×vg ≤ 0) and region II (vp×vg &gt; 0), where vp and vg are phase velocity and group velocity, respectively. The wavelengths of two regions overlap from 1.468 m to 1.525 m (denoted as 0) within photonic bandgap. We observe from Figure 1e that when edge mode wavelength is longer than 0, only single unidirectional edge mode within Region I can be excited at each wavelength in the light propagation direction of +x or -x. When the edge mode wavelength is shorter than (or equal to) 0, however, dual unidirectional edge modes (one in Region I and the another in Region II) can be excited at each wavelength in the light propagation direction of +x or -x. Above interesting features have not been demonstrated by the valley hall photonic crystals based on Kagome lattice reported in Ref. [28]. Figure 1f demonstrates that the edge modes below light line in Region I have smaller decay slop than others because of lower vertical light loss.topologically protected light propagation with out-of-plane confinement.

        <p>We investigate unidirectional propagation feature of the edge states in KVP waveguide as schematically shown in Figure 2a. Figure 2b shows that the same sources at different structure positions can excite unidirectional edge states propagating in the opposite direction due to chiral light matter interaction, 42 which is also observed in other reported photonic quantum spin Hall 13,15,16 and photonic quantum valley Hall systems. 26,27 When left-handed circularly polarized source excites photons at locations "1" ("2"), negative (positive) chirality is predominant and leftward (rightward) unidirectional light propagation occurs. At location "3", the local electric fields of the edge mode are elliptically polarized and hence the light propagates in both left and right direction. 43,44 In any case, the light is well confined at the boundary between the two perturbed KVPs in both xy and xz planes due to the presence of topological edge states below light line. We also evaluate field distribution and spectra in both Region I and Region II are excited in this case (as predicted in Figure 1e), and the intensity of the excited modes in the two regions varies significantly with wavelength under the same dipole source excitation.We investigate unidirectional propagation feature of the edge states in KVP waveguide as schematically shown in Figure 2a.

        <p>Spectral oscillation occurs at wavelengths shorter than 0=1.525 m.

        <p>shown in Figure 3b. The ring-resonator modes arise from excitation of low propagation loss edge modes within Region I (Figures 1e and1f), which is evidenced by the E-field distributions showing that light propagates smoothly along the whole cavity (Figures 3d and3e). In contrast to the ring-resonator modes, the FP-resonator modes experience high reflection from the cavity corners (Figures 3f and3g). The FP-resonator modes originate from excitation of lossy edge modes in Region II (Figures 1e and1d), which explains why the wavelengths of FP-resonator modes are shorter than o as indicated in Figure 3b.shown in Figure 3b.

        <p>To further analyze the cavity modes, we perform free-spectral-range (FSR) calculations of the ring-resonator modes based on FSR  /(ngLcavity), 45 where ng is group index and Lcavity is the effective length of light propagating in the cavity. Numerical FSR results were obtained from FDTD results using FSR=|i-i +1 | (i=1, 2, …8), where i is the wavelength of i-th ring resonator modes. Figure 3c illustrates that the value of the FSR of the ring-resonator modes is not constant due to waveguide dispersion (i.e., ng varies with wavelength). There is deviation between the analytically and the numerically obtained FSR, which arises from the fact that we corners and thus yield different Lcavity. Furthermore, we study the dependence of the resonant modes' frequencies on the cavity length (Figure 3h). The frequency spacing of the ringresonator modes decrease with L. We note that the FP-resonator modes always appear at wavelengths shorter than 0=1.525 m, which prove that the physical origin of FP-resonator modes is excitation of the edge modes in Region II (Figures 1e and1d). Figure 3i shows that for the same cavity length, the ring-resonator modes at the frequencies in the sides of the edge states range tend to have smaller Q factors than those for the frequencies in the middle of the edge states range, which is because they are close to bulk modes and have larger lateral losses.To further analyze the cavity modes, we perform free-spectral-range (FSR) calculations of the ring-resonator modes based on FSR  /(ngLcavity), 45 where ng is group index and Lcavity is the effective length of light propagating in the cavity.

        <p>We observe that the maximum Q factor reaches 2.1×10 4 at wavelength of 1518.7 nm when the cavity edge length L=8.5 m. The proposed cavity has higher Q factor than that of the recently reported topological ring resonator cavity based on photonic quantum spin hall effect. 18 Figure 3j demonstrates that the maximum Q factor depends on cavity length and decreases rapidly with the cavity length when L&lt;8.5 m, which is due to light in the cavity edges starting to couple from each other when the cavity edges become closer. We also note that the maximum Q factor drops when cavity length increases (L&gt;8.5 m) due to larger propagation loss of edge modes for longer cavity. We observe from Figure 3j that the propagation loss increases from ~9.16 dB/cm to ~11.6 dB/cm when L changes from 8.5 m to 14.5 m. The Q factor drops slowly because of the propagation loss of the modes below the light line (Figures 1e and1f), which differs to the spin Hall-type photonic crystal cavities that have larger vertical loss and lower Q factor due to edge states above the light line. 18,46 We study how the number of the periods of the surrounding photonic crystals m (Figure S8 in in the Supporting Information) affect the Q factor. We observe that the Q factor does not change much as long as m is large enough to confine the field of the edge modes near cavity edges. When m reduces, the field of the edge mods starts to decay to the ambient membrane through the surrounding photonic crystals and thereby the Q factor becomes smaller. We stress that estimating the light propagation loss by the cavity Q factor is valid only when the size of surrounding PhCs is large enough to confine the field of the edge modes near the cavity edges. When the size of the surrounding PhCs is small, light leakage to the surrounding occurs and introduces additional optical loss apart from the propagation loss, and hence estimation of the propagation loss by Q factor will be inaccurate.We observe that the maximum Q factor reaches 2.1×10 4 at wavelength of 1518.7 nm when the cavity edge length L=8.5 m.

        <p>We further study lasing performance of the topological cavity by introducing gain to the InGaAsP material and optically pumping the KVP cavity, as illustrated in Figure 4a. We utilize a four-level two-electron model to investigate lasing dynamics of the cavity, as described in Figure 4b. As an example, we simulate KVP cavities with edge length of L=6.5 m. The electron populations of the levels rely on pumping intensity and spontaneous emission decay. We demonstrate that the population inversion of Level 2 relative to Level 1 can be achieved at pump laser intensity of |E|=3×10 5 V/m (Figure 4c). Consequently, lasing at edge state wavelength of ~1523 nm is achieved, as shown from the laser spectrum and the field distribution in Figures 4d and4e. The field profile looks slightly different to that in Figure 3d, because they are corresponding to different modes at different wavelengths. Figure 4f displays that the laser intensity experiences a dramatically jump when the power of the pump laser increases to a certain value and then becomes saturated when the pump laser further increasesa typical laser threshold behavior with a clear transition from spontaneous emission to stimulated emission.We further study lasing performance of the topological cavity by introducing gain to the InGaAsP material and optically pumping the KVP cavity, as illustrated in Figure 4a.

        <p>Next, we investigate robustness of the proposed KVP lasers. We design a topological cavity with complex closed boundary between the perturbed KVPs (Figure 5a). Despite of a complex cavity geometry, distinct topological invariants of the two perturbed KVPs ensures the existence of topological laser modes, and the generated laser is well confined and propagates smoothly along the boundary (Figure 5b). We note from Figure 4d and Figure 5c that multiple lasing modes are excited, which is due to the fact that we use a relatively large value of dephasing rate a in our design so that the gain of the material covers broad edge states' wavelength range. As a result, when the pump laser power is strong, additional ring-resonator modes start to lase. The cavity has different cavity length to that in Figure 4 and hence generates resonate edge modes with different wavelengths. The lasing at the resonant mode wavelength of 1516 nm is dominant, which we think is due to this mode having higher gain and lower loss than the other resonant modes from the same cavity.Next, we investigate robustness of the proposed KVP lasers.

        <p>Discovery of new types of non-trivial photonic topological platforms facilitates the development of novel topological lasers. We have demonstrated a PTI strategy based on alldielectric hole-type Kagome lattice, which differs fundamentally to the recently reported approaches based on quantum spin Hall effect, [29][30][31]38 One advantage of the developed KVPs in the semiconductor membrane platform is that it allows broadband non-trivial generation in telecommunication region below the light line and thus enables robust photonic routing in waveguides even with sharp bends. We analytically and numerically investigate the bandstructure of the Kagome photonic crystals and show that the valley-dependent edge states can be categorized into two regions, i.e., Region I (vp×vg≤ 0) and Region II (vp×vg &gt;0), where vp and vg are phase velocity and group velocity, respectively. Edge modes in Region I have low propagation and bend loss while the edge modes in Region II have high propagation and bend loss, which results in the coexistence of the ring-resonator modes and the Fabry-Pérot resonator modes in the proposed triangular-type KVP cavities. It is worth to note that the edge modes in both regions are topological because they originate from the nontrivial topological charges at the K/K' points in the extended parameter space in contrast to typical quantum Hall effect topological insulators. 47 We explore topologically protected laser cavities based on the four-level two-electron model and evaluate the robustness and dynamics of the lasing cavities by studying population inversion, lasing spectra, mode field profiles, and light-in light-out (L-L) responses. To date tight-binding model is widely used to design and analyse gain and lasing behaviour of topological insulator lasers. 30,31 Our work suggests that the FDTD-based four-level twoelectron model offers a powerful alternative platform to study laser performance of topological insulator cavities with arbitrary geometry. Our study helps understanding the interplay between non-Hermiticity and topology, and more importantly provides a new scheme to explore compact all-dielectric topological lasers that can be easily integrated to other passive or active photonic devices by the well-established semiconductor photonic integrated circuit technologies.Discovery of new types of non-trivial photonic topological platforms facilitates the development of novel topological lasers. We have demonstrated a PTI strategy based on alldielectric hole-type Kagome lattice, which differs fundamentally to the recently reported approaches based on quantum spin Hall effect, [29][30][31]38 One advantage of the developed KVPs in the semiconductor membrane platform is that it allows broadband non-trivial generation in telecommunication region below the light line and thus enables robust photonic routing in waveguides even with sharp bends. We analytically and numerically investigate the bandstructure of the Kagome photonic crystals and show that the valley-dependent edge states can be categorized into two regions, i.e., Region I (vp×vg≤ 0) and Region II (vp×vg &gt;0), where vp and vg are phase velocity and group velocity, respectively. Edge modes in Region I have low propagation and bend loss while the edge modes in Region II have high propagation and bend loss, which results in the coexistence of the ring-resonator modes and the Fabry-Pérot resonator modes in the proposed triangular-type KVP cavities. It is worth to note that the edge modes in both regions are topological because they originate from the nontrivial topological charges at the K/K' points in the extended parameter space in contrast to typical quantum Hall effect topological insulators. 47 We explore topologically protected laser cavities based on the four-level two-electron model and evaluate the robustness and dynamics of the lasing cavities by studying population inversion, lasing spectra, mode field profiles, and light-in light-out (L-L) responses.

The TE-like electromagnetic bandstructure of KVPs based on semiconductor slab were obtained from 3-D MIT Photonic Bands (MPB) software. 48 The simulations of light propagation and field distribution of the edge states in the KVP waveguides were carried out by exciting edge modes with a circular polarized light source placed in specified locations in FDTD modelling (Figure 2). Transmission spectra of the bended waveguide were implemented by normalizing the waveguide to the straight waveguide with the same geometrical parameters (Figure S6 in the Supporting Information).Numerical simulations.

        <p>To get accurate Q factor for the triangular KVP cavities, we placed 11 electrical dipoles randomly near one of the cavity edges (see the star symbol in Figure 3a) to excite all the resonant mode. These dipoles have random phases and excite lights at wavelengths of 1.4 m-1.6 m. We put 12 monitors randomly near the cavity edge to record the electrical filed. We extract the slope of the envelope of the decaying light signal in the cavities to derive Q factor by averaging the signal from all the monitors. The FDTD simulation time was 100 ps.

        <p>Four-level two-electron model. We implemented the dynamics of the electron transition and the population intensity modelling of the topological cavities by four-level two-electron model 51 based on 3-D FDTD method (
            <rs type="software">Lumerical software</rs>). The four-level atomic system is considered as two coupled dipole oscillators Pa (formed by Level 1 and Level 2) and Pb (formed by Level 0 and Level 3) with angular frequency of a and b, and dephasing rate a and b (Figure 4b), respectively. Ni is electron population density probability in Level i and τij (i, j=0,1,2,3) is the decay time constant between levels i and j. The parameters for the gain material InGaAsP in the model (Figures 4 and5) are a=1.26×10 15 Hz and b=1.77×10 15 Hz, a=1.68×10 14 Hz, b=1×10 12 Hz, τ30=τ21=3×10 -10 s, τ32=τ10=1×10 -13 s. 51,52 We use a continuous wave laser with a Gaussian shape intensity profile (Figure 4(a)) at wavelength of 1064 nm to pump the KVP cavities to excite topological laser modes in telecommunication region. The pump laser is placed 1 m away from the cavity surface and has a waist radius of 12 m to pump both the inside and outside of the cavities. In the FDTD-based four-level two-electron simulations, we place a frequency-domain monitor at one of the cavity edges and record the electric field components (i.e., Ex, Ey, and Ez) of the monitor to derive the electric field amplitude (i.e., |E| 2 =|Ex| 2 +|Ey| 2 +|Ez| 2 ) as the output intensity of the generated edge mode lasers.

Figure S1 shows that electromagnetic mode around a hole couples to the other two holes in the same primitive cell (i.e., intracell coupling) and couples to the holes in the nearest neighboring primitive cells as well (i.e., intercell coupling). For the negatively perturbed KVPs, the intracell coupling is stronger than the intercell coupling (Figure S1a), which is the opposite to the case of the positively perturbed KVPs (Figure S1b). Therefore, we can consider our KVPs as 2-D tight binding system with each cell having three sites and consider both the intracell and the intercell coupling, as schematically shown in Figure S2(a). Under the tight binding approximation, Hamiltonian of the KVPs can be given by the following where the intracell hopping Hamiltonian 𝐻 and intercell hopping Hamiltonian 𝐻

Figure S5 illustrates that light propagates smoothly around the sharp corners and is well confined at the out-of-plane because of the edge modes being below light line.
