        <p>The majoron, a pseudo-Goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of global lepton number, is a generic feature of many models intended to explain the origin of the small neutrino masses. In this work, we investigate potential imprints in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) arising from massive majorons, should they thermalize with neutrinos after Big Bang Nucleosynthesis via inverse neutrino decays. We show that Planck2018 measurements of the CMB are currently sensitive to neutrino-majoron couplings as small as λ ∼ 10 -13 , which if interpreted in the context of the type-I seesaw mechanism correspond to a lepton number symmetry breaking scale v L ∼ O(100) GeV. Additionally, we identify parameter space for which the majoronneutrino interactions, collectively with an extra contribution to the effective number of relativistic species N eff , can ameliorate the outstanding H 0 tension.The majoron, a pseudo-Goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of global lepton number, is a generic feature of many models intended to explain the origin of the small neutrino masses.

        <p>Despite unambiguous evidence that at least two of the known neutrinos have a non-zero mass, the Standard Model (SM) is still lacking of an explanation of their origin. Perhaps more concerning, however, is the question of why neutrino masses are so much smaller than those of charged leptons. While many models have been proposed over the years to explain both the origin and smallness of the neutrino masses (see e.g. [1][2][3][4][5][6]), perhaps the most compelling class of models are those which invoke the so-called seesaw mechanism [7][8][9][10][11]. In such scenarios, the SM is augmented by heavy righthanded neutrinos carrying a Majorana mass term m N , which Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (https://doi.org/10.1140/epjc/s10052-020-7854-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. a e-mail: miguel.escudero@kcl.ac.uk (corresponding author) b e-mail: sam.witte@ific.uv.es naturally give rise to light neutrino masses m ν of the order ∼ y 2N v 2 H /m N , where v H 246 GeV is the vacuum expectation value of the SM Higgs, and y N is the Dirac Yukawa coupling of the right-handed neutrinos.

Assuming that lepton number is a global symmetry, as in the SM, the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) triggered by the scalar leads to the prediction of a pseudo-Goldstone boson, the so-called majoron [12] (see also [13][14][15]).Despite unambiguous evidence that at least two of the known neutrinos have a non-zero mass, the Standard Model (SM) is still lacking of an explanation of their origin.

        <p>The majoron is notoriously difficult to probe since it interacts very weakly with all SM particles, particularly with charged fermions λ φe ∼ 10 -20 [12]. However, measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) have reached a level of precision where small modifications to the neutrino sector may be discernible [16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34]. The effect of including majoron-neutrino interactions in the early Universe are twofold [17]: (i) they lead to a non-standard expansion history after Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and prior to recombination (generically amounting to N eff ∼ O(0.1)), and (ii) they act to suppress the neutrino anisotropic stress energy tensor, and hence reduce neutrino free-streaming [16]. The idea of identifying features in the CMB arising from the majoron, and thus providing an indirect probe of the neutrino mass mechanism, was proposed at the start of the century [17]. However, until now, no rigorous cosmological implementation of this idea has been performed, 1 nor has there been an analysis using real data.The majoron is notoriously difficult to probe since it interacts very weakly with all SM particles, particularly with charged fermions λ φe ∼ 10 -20 [12].

        <p>Using Planck2018 data [35,36], we analyze a wellmotivated region of parameter space in which majorons thermalize with neutrinos after BBN via inverse neutrino decay. We show that neutrino-majoron couplings as small as 10 -13 can be robustly excluded with existing CMB data; future experiments, such as the Simons Observatory [37] and CMB-S4 [38], which are aiming to probe the effective number of relativistic species N eff at the sub-percent level, could have sensitivity to couplings as small as 10 -14 . If interpreted in the context of the type-I seesaw model, these couplings point toward a lepton number symmetry breaking scale of O(100) GeV and O(1) TeV, respectively. Thus, quite remarkably, the CMB is providing an indirect probe of the neutrino mass mechanism at collider energy scales (albeit unaccessible to colliders due to their small couplings), but using feeble interactions with neutrinos in the early Universe.Using Planck2018 data [35,36], we analyze a wellmotivated region of parameter space in which majorons thermalize with neutrinos after BBN via inverse neutrino decay.

        <p>While the CDM model has been incredibly successful at describing both high-and low-redshift cosmological observations, a concerning tension has recently emerged between the value of the Hubble constant H 0 inferred using early Universe observations (with data either from the CMB [35], or by combining measurements from BBN with baryonic acoustic oscillations, i.e. BAOs [39][40][41]), and various local late Universe measurements performed using observations of type-Ia supernovae (see e.g. [42][43][44][45][46][47]) and strong lensing [48][49][50][51] (see e.g. [52] for an overview of the various measurements). The most prolific of these discrepancies is between the value inferred by Planck, H 0 = 67.4 ± 0.5 km/s/Mpc [35], and that observed by SH 0 ES collaboration, which relies on cepheids to calibrate the distance to type-Ia SN, who find a value of H 0 = 74.0 ± 1.4 km/s/Mpc [43]. Depending both on the choice of distance calibration and how one chooses to combine datasets, the outstanding tension is determined to be at the level of ∼ 4 -6 σ [52,53]. While it is of course possible that this tension is a consequence of unaccounted for systematics in either or both measurements, throughout this work we will take this discrepancy at face value and assume alternatively that this is an indication of new physics beyond the CDM paradigm.While the CDM model has been incredibly successful at describing both high-and low-redshift cosmological observations, a concerning tension has recently emerged between the value of the Hubble constant H 0 inferred using early Universe observations (with data either from the CMB [35], or by combining measurements from BBN with baryonic acoustic oscillations, i.e. BAOs [39][40][41]), and various local late Universe measurements performed using observations of type-Ia supernovae (see e.g. [42][43][44][45][46][47]) and strong lensing [48][49][50][51] (see e.g. [52] for an overview of the various measurements).

        <p>Various groups have attempted to resolve this issue by including additional contributions to N eff [54][55][56][57][58], strong neutrino self-interactions [30,31], hidden neutrino interactions [59][60][61], exotic dark energy models [62][63][64][65][66][67][68][69][70][71][72][73][74][75], dark sector interactions [76][77][78][79], and modified theories of gravity [80][81][82]. Most of these solutions are either incapable of resolving the tension fully [83][84][85], are experimentally constrained [86], are highly fine-tuned, or lack theoretical motivation. Perhaps the most simple, and thus theoretically appealing, solution which can ameliorate the H 0 tension to the level of ∼ 3σ is simply to postulate the existence of non-interacting dark radiation producing a shift in the radiation energy density relative to the value predicted in the Standard Model of N eff ∼ 0.25. A more appealing, albeit far more problematic, solution was introduced in [30], where it was shown that strongly interacting 2-to-2 neutrino scatterings together with a contribution to N eff ∼ 1 was able to fully resolve the tension; unfortunately, this solution requires neutrino couplings that are not phenomenologically viable [86], a value of N eff excluded by BBN [87], and is only successful at reducing the tension if CMB polarization data is neglected. Given that the majoron naturally contributes to N eff at the level of ∼ 0.11 via late-time thermalization and decay, and damps neutrino free-streaming in a manner similar to that of the strongly interacting neutrino solution, it is natural to ask whether 2-to-1 neutrino-majoron interactions are capable of further reducing the H 0 tension, beyond what is simply accomplished with CDM + N eff . Indeed we show that including majoron-neutrino interactions broadens the posterior such that the H 0 tension can be further reduced, albeit only to the level of 2.5 σ , a level that is comparable with other viable solutions, such as early dark energy (see e.g. [70]).Various groups have attempted to resolve this issue by including additional contributions to N eff [54][55][56][57][58], strong neutrino self-interactions [30,31], hidden neutrino interactions [59][60][61], exotic dark energy models [62][63][64][65][66][67][68][69][70][71][72][73][74][75], dark sector interactions [76][77][78][79], and modified theories of gravity [80][81][82].

        <p>Looking forward, it may be interesting to consider the possibility that one of the active neutrinos is exactly massless, as this would decouple the lightest neutrino form the majoron, changing the cosmological evolution of the system. One could also conceive of the possibility of a multi-majoron system resulting from the SSB of a more complex flavor symmetry group in the neutrino sector [17]. In such a scenario, one could produce a more complicated thermalization history which produces step-like features in the evolution of the energy density, and damps the perturbations in a nontrivial manner. While these models are beyond the scope of the current work, they provide a clear extension of the ideas and prospects studied here.Looking forward, it may be interesting to consider the possibility that one of the active neutrinos is exactly massless, as this would decouple the lightest neutrino form the majoron, changing the cosmological evolution of the system.

        <p>respectively. In addition to these two parameters, we also allow for the possibility of extra relativistic and noninteracting degrees of freedom. We allow N eff to vary linearly between -2 ≤ N eff ≤ 4, and treat this additional radiation as free streaming. This additional contribution to N eff should not be considered ad hoc, but rather a natural expectation of majoron models. For example, should the reheating temperature be above the mass of right handed neutrinos, a thermal population of majorons produced in the early Universe may come to dominate the energy density of the Universe, producing nearly arbitrarily large contributions to N eff . Such an effect becomes increasingly important for feeble interactions, such that an effective lower bound can be placed on the the neutrino-majoron interaction -needless to say, however, this bound is inherently dependent on pre-BBN cosmology. We include in Fig. 1 a line, labeled N * eff , that identifies parameter space for which the contribution to N eff from a primordial population of majorons would be excluded by Planck and measurements of large scale structure. We include a more comprehensive discussion of this effect in the Supplementary Material.respectively.

        <p>After implementing the above modifications to both the energy density and neutrino-majoron perturbations in CLASS [107,108], we perform an MCMC with Montepython [109,110] using the Planck-2018 TTTEEE+lowlTT+ lowE+lensing likelihood [36], including data on BAOs from the 6DF galaxy survey [111], the MGS galaxy sample of SDSS [112], and from the CMASS and LOWZ galaxy samples of BOSS DR12 [113], both including and excluding a Gaussian contribution to the likelihood on H 0 from SH 0 ES [43], taken to have a mean value and standard deviation of 74.0 and 1.4 km/s/Mpc. All MCMCs have been run until the largest Gelman-Rubin coefficient was R -1 &lt; 0.03 or better. In Table 1 we outline all relevant cosmological parameters for the analyses of Planck 2018 + BAO + SH 0 ES data.After implementing the above modifications to both the energy density and neutrino-majoron perturbations in CLASS [107,108], we perform an MCMC with Montepython [109,110] using the Planck-2018 TTTEEE+lowlTT+ lowE+lensing likelihood [36], including data on BAOs from the 6DF galaxy survey [111], the MGS galaxy sample of SDSS [112], and from the CMASS and LOWZ galaxy samples of BOSS DR12 [113], both including and excluding a Gaussian contribution to the likelihood on H 0 from SH 0 ES [43], taken to have a mean value and standard deviation of 74.0 and 1.4 km/s/Mpc.

        <p>In Fig. 1 we show the 95% exclusion contours derived in this work, and the 1σ contour for parameter space preferred from the fit including the SH 0 ES likelihood. We derive the 95% CL exclusion contours using only Planck data in order to remain conservative, and note that including e.g. BAO data leads to a minor strengthening of this contour. Interestingly, the results obtained here illustrate that Planck has already begun to significantly probe well-motivated regions of parameter space in which the majoron mass arises from dim-5 Planck scale suppressed operators. If interpreted in terms of the type-I seesaw model, current CMB observations are now probing lepton symmetry breaking scales O(100) GeV, with future CMB experiments potentially reaching the level of ∼ 10 TeV. Before continuing, we would like to emphasize that the constraints derived in this work are both stringent and robust over wide regions of parameter space. For example, a majoron of m φ = 1 eV and λ = 10 -11 is excluded by more than 5σ . In Fig. 2 we show the posterior distributions for CDM, CDM with a floating value of N eff , and the majoron + N eff , each including and excluding the SH 0 ES likelihood. The SH 0 ES posterior is shown for comparison. Including the majoron broadens the posterior and induces a minimal shift of the central value to large H 0 , an effect which is more visible when the SH 0 ES likelihood is included. While the difference induced by including the majoron is not enormous, the H 0 tension can be reduced from 4.4 σ to 2.5 σ when neutrinomajoron interactions, and an additional contribution to dark radiation, are included.In Fig. 1 we show the 95% exclusion contours derived in this work, and the 1σ contour for parameter space preferred from the fit including the SH 0 ES likelihood.

        <p>By performing a MCMC including the SH 0 ES likelihood, we find that a scenario with N eff = 0.52 ± 0.19, 0.1 eV &lt; m φ &lt; 1 eV, and coupling strengths λ ∼ (10 -14 -10 -13 ) (eV/m φ ) -as highlighted in red in Fig. 1 -would render a posterior for H 0 of 71.9 ± 1.2 km/s/Mpc and an overall improvement of χ 2 -12.2 with respect to CDM. We remind the reader here that, because of the residual 2.5σ tension, it may not be entirely meaningful to combine the partially discrepant datasets, and thus care should be given in the interpretation of this region. Notice that the improvement in the χ 2 does not exclusively arise from the shift in H 0 ; this can be seen from the fact that the contribution of the CMB likelihood in the Majoron+ N eff is less than that of CDM. Interestingly, this region of parameter space corresponds to lepton number symmetry breaking scales in the type-I seesaw near the electroweak scale. Furthermore, it is worth emphasizing that unlike the strongly interacting neutrino solution proposed in [30] (defined by a 2-to-2 neutrino contact interaction), the solution proposed here is robust to the inclusion of polarization data, is phenomenologically viable, and is theoretically motivated.By performing a MCMC including the SH 0 ES likelihood, we find that a scenario with N eff = 0.52 ± 0.19, 0.1 eV &lt; m φ &lt; 1 eV, and coupling strengths λ ∼ (10 -14 -10 -13 ) (eV/m φ ) -as highlighted in red in Fig. 1 -would render a posterior for H 0 of 71.9 ± 1.2 km/s/Mpc and an overall improvement of χ 2 -12.2 with respect to CDM.

        <p>An important comment on the consistency of this type of solution is necessary. If the contribution to N eff is of primordial origin, then successful BBN excludes values of N eff 0.4 at T ∼ MeV [87,114,115]. In addition, including a floating value of N eff in the CMB analysis can induce a shift in the preferred value of b h 2 , which is also constrained by BBN. In the Supplementary Material, we address the extent to which the parameter space in the N effb h 2 plane preferred by the CMB fit is compatible with expectations of BBN.An important comment on the consistency of this type of solution is necessary.

        <p>Evidence for the existence of the majoron, arising from the spontaneous breaking of global lepton number, would provide a strong clue to the origin of the neutrino masses. In this work we have looked at the extent to which CMB measurements have probed the existence of such a particle through its impact on the expansion history of the Universe and its interactions with neutrinos. We show that there exists a broad range of well-motivated parameter space that is now excluded using Planck2018 measurements of the CMB power spectrum. Furthermore, we identify a region in which the majoron interactions help ameliorate the outstanding H 0 tension to a level that is beyond what is simply accomplished by including N eff . If confirmed, the H 0 tension could be providing the first insight into the origin of the small neutrino masses.Evidence for the existence of the majoron, arising from the spontaneous breaking of global lepton number, would provide a strong clue to the origin of the neutrino masses.
