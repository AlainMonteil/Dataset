        <p>We study chiral models in one spatial dimension, both static and periodically driven. We demonstrate that their topological properties may be read out through the long time limit of a bulk observable, the mean chiral displacement. The derivation of this result is done in terms of spectral projectors, allowing for a detailed understanding of the physics. We show that the proposed detection converges rapidly and it can be implemented in a wide class of chiral systems. Furthermore, it can measure arbitrary winding numbers and topological boundaries, it applies to all non-interacting systems, independently of their quantum statistics, and it requires no additional elements, such as external fields, nor filled bands.We study chiral models in one spatial dimension, both static and periodically driven.

        <p>Topological phases of matter constitute a new paradigm by escaping the standard Ginzburg-Landau theory of phase transitions. These exotic phases appear without any symmetry breaking and are not characterized by a local order parameter, but rather by a global topological order. In the last decade, topological insulators have attracted much interest [1]. These systems are insulators in their bulk but exhibit current carrying edge states protected by the topology. A classification of topological insulators in terms of their discrete symmetries and their spatial dimensionality has been obtained in the celebrated periodic table of topological insulators and superconductors [2]. The topological invariant characterizing these models can be derived from the bulk Hamiltonian and allows one to recover the so called bulk-edge correspondence, namely that the number of topologically protected edge states is proportional to the topological invariant. A famous example of this correspondence can be found in the Quantum-Hall effect where the quantization of the Hall conductance is rooted in the current-carrying protected edge states [3][4][5]. The ensemble of (natural and artificial) topological insulators is steadily growing, and these have been by now synthetically engineered in a multitude of physical systems such as atomic [6][7][8][9][10][11], superconducting [12], photonic [13-17] and acoustic platforms [18][19][20].Topological phases of matter constitute a new paradigm by escaping the standard Ginzburg-Landau theory of phase transitions.

        <p>This work focuses on one-dimensional (1D) topological insulators possessing chiral symmetry. As a consequence of the chiral symmetry, the different sites of the unit cell can always be regarded as part of two sublattices. The topological invariant of the bulk, the winding number , allows one to predict the number of zero energy edge states. 1D chiral topological insulators have been realized in numerous platforms as ultracold atoms [6, 11], photonic crystals [15], photonic quantum walks [21][22][23][24][25]. Let us notice that the 1D chiral Hamiltonian can be static or the effective Hamiltonian of a Floquet system. In the latter case, the topology can be richer than its static counterpart [26][27][28][29]. In both cases, two different approaches to characterize the topology of such systems have been proposed and implemented experimentally. The first one is to look at intrinsic properties of the system. The second one is to measure the response to an external change. The observation of edge states [11,21,30,31] and the measurement of the winding number through the mean chiral displacement [24] belong to the first category. The measurement of the winding number by interferometric architectures [6,25], by introducing losses [15,32,33], and by scattering measurements [22] belong to the second category.This work focuses on one-dimensional (1D) topological insulators possessing chiral symmetry.

        <p>Here we generalize the notion of mean chiral displacement introduced in [24], and we present an intrinsic measurement of the topology for 1D chiral Hamiltonians with an arbitrary (even) number of sites per unit cell. This measure is based on the real-time evolution of an initially localized, single-particle state. Since this probes the free dynamics (i.e. without interactions), the method applies equally well to fermionic and bosonic systems, without requiring a specific band filling. Moreover, the measurement is carried out inside the bulk, so that the method also applies to systems with periodic boundary conditions (i.e. in a ring geometry). The method directly probes the Hamiltonian of interest, without resorting to additional external forces (which is generally required in two-dimensional). Finally, this detection scheme even applies to a class of dissipative bosonic systems, as long as the losses act uniformly on all sites of the lattice. Practically, our proposal only requires the single-site-resolved measurement of the density, and therefore it is implementable in a wide class of natural and artificial systems.Here we generalize the notion of mean chiral displacement introduced in [24], and we present an intrinsic measurement of the topology for 1D chiral Hamiltonians with an arbitrary (even) number of sites per unit cell.

        <p>The effect of spatial disorder and noise on the mean chiral displacement for systems with 2 = were already discussed at length in our previous publication, [24]. In particular, there we confirmed that this observable is a robust topological marker by showing that, in presence of chiral-preserving static spatial disorder of amplitude small compared to the gap, the ensemble average of the mean chiral displacement smoothly converges to the value obtained for a clean system. In the literature it has been discussed how a different observable may be used to detect the winding of chiral non-Hermitian models [15,32,33]. Let us note that there are important differences between the latter proposals and ours. First, the scheme proposed in [15,32,33] requires the initial state to be polarized along a well-defined direction, while our method works independently of the polarization of the initial condition. Second, that method requires sublattice-dependent losses that may not be easily introduced in an experiment with ultracold atoms, or in an optomechanical system and do not work without losses. Finally, our method works even in presence of uniform losses while the method for non-Hermitian systems does not.The effect of spatial disorder and noise on the mean chiral displacement for systems with 2 = were already discussed at length in our previous publication, [24].

        <p>Summarizing, in this work we have generalized the notion of mean chiral displacement to chiral systems with any internal dimension , showing that when 2 &gt; the winding number is encoded in the long-time limit of the trace of the mean chiral displacement over a localized basis of the internal space. We analyzed three chiral models having internal dimension 4 = , i.e. (i) the simplest extension of the SSH model (the SSH 4 ), (ii) its driven analog, and (iii) the SSH model with staggered long range hoppings. We applied our detection method to these systems showing that it works correctly for both static and periodically-driven Hamiltonians, and that it is able to capture values of the winding which exceed 1, such as the LR-SSH. Furthermore, the detection is rapid, as the amplitude of the oscillations displayed by the mean chiral displacement is generally smaller than the length of a unit cell, and therefore only very few tunneling times are needed to identify the winding of the model. Moreover, the detection method we propose does not require filled bands, but is based on the dynamics of wavepackets, or even single particles, and therefore it is specially adapted to systems where band-filling may be problematic, like bosonic ensembles of atoms, or photonic systems. Finally, the method only requires to follow the free evolution of the system, without the need of extra resources, such as external l , λ, and 2 ; l in this configuration a=c, but b and d may be tuned independently.Summarizing, in this work we have generalized the notion of mean chiral displacement to chiral systems with any internal dimension , showing that when 2 &gt; the winding number is encoded in the long-time limit of the trace of the mean chiral displacement over a localized basis of the internal space.
