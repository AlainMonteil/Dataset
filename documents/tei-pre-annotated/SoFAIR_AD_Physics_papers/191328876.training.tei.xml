        <p>Recently it has been established that torsional Newton-Cartan (TNC) geometry is the appropriate geometrical framework to which non-relativistic field theories couple. We show that when these geometries are made dynamical they give rise to Hořava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity. Projectable HL gravity corresponds to dynamical Newton-Cartan (NC) geometry without torsion and non-projectable HL gravity corresponds to dynamical NC geometry with twistless torsion (hypersurface orthogonal foliation). We build a precise dictionary relating all fields (including the scalar khronon), their transformations and other properties in both HL gravity and dynamical TNC geometry. We use TNC invariance to construct the effective action for dynamical twistless torsional Newton-Cartan geometries in 2+1 dimensions for dynamical exponent 1 &lt; z ≤ 2 and demonstrate that this exactly agrees with the most general forms of the HL actions constructed in the literature. Further, we identify the origin of the U(1) symmetry observed by Hořava and Melby-Thompson as coming from the Bargmann extension of the local Galilean algebra that acts on the tangent space to TNC geometries. We argue that TNC geometry, which is manifestly diffeomorphism covariant, is a natural geometrical framework underlying HL gravity and discuss some of its implications.Recently it has been established that torsional Newton-Cartan (TNC) geometry is the appropriate geometrical framework to which non-relativistic field theories couple.

        <p>In the search for consistent theories of quantum gravity, Hořava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity [1,2] has appeared as a tantalizing possibility of a non-Lorentz invariant and renormalizable UV completion of gravity. While observational constraints and the matching to general relativity in the IR put severe limitations on the phenomenological viability of this proposal, HL gravity is of intrinsic theoretical interest as an example of gravity with anisotropic scaling between time and space. In particular, in the context of holography it holds the prospect of providing an alternative way [3,4] of constructing gravity duals for strongly coupled systems with non-relativistic scaling, including those of interest to condensed matter physics. More generally, one might expect that HL gravity has a natural embedding in the larger framework of string theory [5].In the search for consistent theories of quantum gravity, Hořava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity [1,2] has appeared as a tantalizing possibility of a non-Lorentz invariant and renormalizable UV completion of gravity.

        <p>where the first possibility has no torsion and the latter option has general torsion with the twistless case being an important in-between situation. More specifically, in the first case the time-like vielbein of the geometry is closed and defines an absolute time.

        <p>As is clear from holographic studies of the boundary energy-momentum tensor as for example in [17-19, 23, 31] the addition of torsion to the NC geometry is crucial in order to be able to calculate the energy density and energy flux of the theory. This is because they are the response to varying τ µ (see also [30]). Hence in order to be able to compute these quantities τ µ better be unconstrained, i.e. one should allow for arbitrary torsion. If we work with TTNC geometry one can only compute the energy density and the divergence of the energy current [20] because in that case τ µ = ψ∂ µ τ where one has to vary ψ and τ with ψ sourcing the energy density and τ sourcing the divergence (after partial integration) of the energy current. In any case the point is that, contrary to the relativistic setting, adding torsion is a very natural thing to do in NC geometry. Moreover, as will be shown later, the torsion is not something one can freely pick and is actually fixed by the formalism.As is clear from holographic studies of the boundary energy-momentum tensor as for example in [17-19, 23, 31] the addition of torsion to the NC geometry is crucial in order to be able to calculate the energy density and energy flux of the theory.

        <p>As we will review in this paper, the various versions of TNC geometry defined above arise by gauging non-relativistic symmetry algebras (Galilean, Bargmann, Schrödinger). In particular, in this procedure the internal symmetries are made into local symmetries, and translations are turned into diffeomorphisms. This is in the same way that Riemannian geometry comes from gauging the Poincaré algebra, thereby imposing local Lorentz symmetry and turning translations into space-time diffeomorphisms. Thus HL gravity theories (and more generally TNC gravity) can be seen as the most general gravity theories for which the Einstein equivalence principle (that locally space-time is described by flat Minkowski space-time) is applied to local non-relativistic (Galilean) symmetries, rather than to the local Lorentz symmetry that one has in special relativity.As we will review in this paper, the various versions of TNC geometry defined above arise by gauging non-relativistic symmetry algebras (Galilean, Bargmann, Schrödinger).

        <p>We point out that in general relativity (GR) the global symmetries (Killing vectors) of Minkowski space-time (the Poincaré algebra) form the same algebra from which upon gauging (and replacing local space-time translations by diffeomorphisms as explained in appendix A) we obtain the geometrical framework of GR. On the other hand the Killing vectors of flat NC space-time only involve space and time translations and spatial rotations [23] while the local tangent space group that we gauge in order to obtain the TNC geometrical framework is the Galilean algebra (where again we also replace local time and space translations by diffeomorphisms), which also contains Galilean boosts and is thus not the same algebra as the algebra of Killing vectors of flat NC space-time. We bring this up to highlight the fact that the local tangent space symmetries and the Killing vectors of flat space-time are in general two very different concepts that are often mistakenly assumed to be the same. Basically this happens because the M µ vector allows for the construction of a new set of vielbeins (defined in section 4) that are invariant under G transformations and that only see diffeomorphisms and local rotations which agrees with the Killing vectors of flat NC space-time. Nevertheless the fact that M µ is one of the background fields to which we can couple a field theory can, under special circumstances, lead to additional symmetries such as G and N (and even special conformal symmetries) [23].We point out that in general relativity (GR) the global symmetries (Killing vectors) of Minkowski space-time (the Poincaré algebra) form the same algebra from which upon gauging (and replacing local space-time translations by diffeomorphisms as explained in appendix A) we obtain the geometrical framework of GR.

        <p>Our results on dynamical TNC geometry and its relation to HL gravity provide a new perspective on these theories of gravity. For one thing, the vacuum of HL gravity (without a cosmological constant) has so far been taken to be Minkowski space-time, but since the underlying geometry appears to be TNC geometry, it seems more natural to take this as flat NC space-time [23,24]. Thus it would seem worthwhile to reexamine HL gravity and the various issues6 that have been raised following its introduction.

        <p>Outline of the paper. The first part of the paper (sections 2 to 7) is devoted to setting up the geometrical framework for torsional Newton-Cartan geometry, presented in such a way that the subsequent connection to HL gravity is most clearly displayed. We thus take a pedagogical approach that introduces the relevant ingredients in a step-by-step way. To this end we begin in section 2 with the geometry that is obtained by gauging the Galilean algebra, extending the original work of [22] to include torsion. We exhibit the transformation properties of the relevant geometrical fields under space-time diffeomorphisms and the internal transformations, consisting of Galilean boosts (G) and spatial rotations (J). We also discuss the vielbein postulates and curvatures entering the field strength of the gauge field. We point out that the only G, J invariants are the time-like vielbein τ µ and the inverse spatial metric h µν . In section 3 we then present the most general affine connection that satisfies the property that the latter quantities are covariantly conserved.Outline of the paper.

        <p>In section 4, we go one step further and add the central element (N ) to the Galilean algebra, and consider the gauging of the resulting Bargmann algebra (as also considered in [22] for the case with no torsion). We show that the extra gauge field m µ that enters in this description, does not alter the transformation properties of the objects considered in section 2, but allows for the introduction of further useful G, J, invariants, namely an inverse time-like vielbein vµ , a spatial metric hµν (or ĥµν ) and a "Newtonian potential" Φ. We then return to the construction of the affine connection in section 5 and employ the geometric quantities of section 2 and 4 to construct the most general connection that can be built out of the invariants. We discuss two special choices of affine connections with particular properties, one of them being especially convenient for the comparison with HL gravity. We point out that, in the case of non-vanishing torsion, there is no choice of affine connection that is also N -invariant, but that one can formally remedy this by introducing a Stückelberg scalar χ (defining M µ = m µ -∂ µ χ) to the setup that cancels this non-invariance. This has the advantage that one can deal simultaneously with theories that have a local U(1) symmetry and those that do not have this, and further it will prove useful when comparing to HL gravity (especially [34][35][36][37]). We also show how the TNC invariants can be used to build a non-degenerate symmetric rank 2 tensor with Lorentzian signature, which will later be used to make contact with the ADM decomposition that enters HL gravity.In section 4, we go one step further and add the central element (N ) to the Galilean algebra, and consider the gauging of the resulting Bargmann algebra (as also considered in [22] for the case with no torsion).

        <p>In section 6 we discuss the specific form of the torsion tensor that emerges from gauging the Bargmann algebra and introduce the three relevant cases for torsion (NC, TTNC and TNC) that were already mentioned above. We also introduce a vector a µ that describes the TTNC torsion, which will turn out to be very useful in order to make contact with the literature on non-projectable HL gravity.

        <p>In section 8 we relate the TNC invariants introduced in the previous sections to those appearing in the corresponding ADM parameterization employed in HL gravity. This identification and the match of the properties and number of components and local symmetries in the case of NC and TTNC already strongly suggest that dynamical (TT)NC is expected to be the same as (non)-projectable HL gravity. We then proceed in section 9 by showing that the generic action that describes dynamical TTNC geometries agrees on the nose with the most general HL actions appearing in the literature. For simplicity we treat the case of 2 spatial dimensions with 1 &lt; z ≤ 2 and organize the terms in the action according to their dilatation weight. In particular, we construct all G, J invariant terms that are relevant or marginal, using as building blocks the TNC invariants (including the torsion tensor and curvature tensor) and covariant derivatives. The resulting action is written in (9.18), (9.19) and gives the HL kinetic terms [1,2] while the potential is exactly the same as the 3D version of the potential given in [32,36,37,39].In section 8 we relate the TNC invariants introduced in the previous sections to those appearing in the corresponding ADM parameterization employed in HL gravity.

        <p>We then proceed in section 10 to consider the extension of the action to include invariance under the central extension N , leading to HL actions with local Bargmann invariance. This can be achieved by including couplings to Φ, which did not appear yet in section 9. Importantly, in the projectable case with the HL coupling constant λ = 1 we reproduce the U(1) invariant action of [34]. When we consider the non-projectable version or λ = 1 we need additional terms to make the theory U(1) invariant which is precisely achieved by adding the Stückelberg field χ that we introduced in section 5 (see also [23]). We can then write a Bargmann invariant action that precisely reproduces the actions considered in the literature, where in particular the χ-dependent pieces agree with those in [36,37]. This comes about in part via coupling to the natural TNC Newton potential, Φχ , which is the Bargmann invariant generalization of Φ, and the simple covariant form of the action (10.14) is one of our central results.We then proceed in section 10 to consider the extension of the action to include invariance under the central extension N , leading to HL actions with local Bargmann invariance.

        <p>We emphasize that adding the χ field to the action means that we have trivialized the U(1) symmetry by Stückelberging it or in other words we have removed the U(1) transformations all together. We further expand on this fact in section 11, commenting on statements in the literature regarding the relevance of the U(1) invariance (which is not there unless we have zero torsion and λ = 1) in relation to the elimination of a scalar degree of freedom. In particular, we will present a different mechanism that accomplishes this and which involves a constraint equation obtained by varying the TNC potential Φχ .We emphasize that adding the χ field to the action means that we have trivialized the U(1) symmetry by Stückelberging it or in other words we have removed the U(1) transformations all together.

        <p>In the presence of torsion the fact that L σµν is given by (5.5) tells us that we have no manifest N invariance of the connection. Further, for no value of α can we find such an invariance. This can be formally solved by adding a new field to the formalism, a Stückelberg scalar χ, that cancels the non-invariance. This will be discussed in the next section. One can also take the point of view as in [30] that we should just accept the fact that Γρ µν is not N invariant as a mere fact and organize couplings to these geometries and fields living on it in such a way that the action is N invariant. This is certainly a viable point of view and agrees with our approach in all these cases where the dependence on χ can be removed from the theory by field redefinition or simply because it drops out when one tries to make its appearance explicit.In the presence of torsion the fact that L σµν is given by (5.5) tells us that we have no manifest N invariance of the connection.

        <p>If one includes χ there is the benefit that one can also deal with theories that do not have a local U(1) symmetry (because there is an explicit dependence on χ so that the U(1) invariance disappears in the Stückelberg coupling between m µ and χ). This is what allows us to use fixed TNC background geometries for both Lifshitz field theories (explicit dependence on χ) as well as Schrödinger field theories (no dependence on χ) as discussed in [23,24]. The χ field also allows us, as we will see in section 10, to construct two types of HL actions: those that have a local U(1) symmetry without any dependence on χ and those that have no local U(1) because m µ always appears as M µ = m µ -∂ µ χ. 10 This statement can be made more precise in the following way. The Hořava-Lifshitz actions of section 9 such as (9.18) take exactly the same form when written in terms of Γρ µν as when expressed in terms of Γρ µν . To show this one needs to use the fact that in section 9 it is assumed that τµ is hypersurface orthogonal which is something that we do not yet impose at this stage. This is because the difference between covariant derivatives using either one or the other connection involves terms proportional to τµ and since the scalars in the action are formed by using inverse spatial metrics h µν those terms drop out.

        <p>Since Φχ is a field like any other we should, in order to be fully general, allow for arbitrary couplings to Φχ that do not lead to terms of dimension higher than z + 2. Put another way the most general HL action can be obtained by writing down the most general action depending on τ µ , ĥµν and Φχ containing terms up to order (dilatation weight) z + 2. The first thing to notice is that we typically cannot write down a kinetic term for Φχ because the dilatation weight of vµ ∂ µ Φχ 2 is 6z -4 which is larger than z + 2 whenever z &gt; 6/5.

        <p>Since it is well understood how to couple matter to TNC geometries the question of how to couple matter to HL gravity can be readily addressed in this framework. For example it would be interesting to find Bianchi identities for the TTNC curvature tensor (as studied in section 7) in such a way that they are compatible with the on-shell diffeomorphism Ward identity for the energy-momentum tensor as defined in [19,23,24]. We emphasize once more that matter systems coupled to TNC geometries can have but do not necessarily need to have a particle number symmetry [19,23]. It would be important to study what the fate of particle number symmetry is once we make the geometry dynamical. In the matter sector particle number symmetry comes about as a gauge transformation acting on M µ in such a manner that the Stückelberg scalar χ can be removed from the matter action [19,23] making this formulation consistent with [30]. We have seen in section 10 that generically the χ field cannot be removed from the actions describing the dynamics of the TNC geometry. Hence, it seems that the dynamics of the geometry breaks particle number symmetry except when we use the model (10.10) for projectable HL gravity with λ = 1 in which case the central extension of the Bargmann algebra is a true local U(1) symmetry and the χ field does not appear in the HL action.Since it is well understood how to couple matter to TNC geometries the question of how to couple matter to HL gravity can be readily addressed in this framework.

        <p>In previous work[19,21,23,24] we denoted by vµ , hµν and Φ the invariants with mµ replaced by Mµ.Here we temporarily work with the forms (4.5)-(4.7) for reasons that will become clear as we go on. We return to our notation from previous works in section 12. We also point out that compared to[19,21,23,24] we denote by mµ here what was referred to as mµ in these papers and vice versa we denote by mµ here what was denoted by mµ in these respective works.In previous work[19,21,23,24] we denoted by vµ , hµν and Φ the invariants with mµ replaced by Mµ.Here we temporarily work with the forms (4.5)-(4.7) for reasons that will become clear as we go on.

        <p>∇ ρ g µν = 0 . (A. 19) As is well known this fixes completely the symmetric part of the connection making it equal to the Levi-Cività connection plus torsion terms which are left unfixed. The common choice in GR to work with torsion-free connections then implies that from the gauging perspective one imposes the curvature constraint R µν a (P ) = 0. This in turn makes ω µ ab a fully dependent connection expressible in terms of the vielbeins and their derivatives. Without fixing the torsion e a µ and ω µ ab remain independent.∇ ρ g µν = 0 .
