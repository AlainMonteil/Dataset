        <p>We study the effect of dimension 7 and 8 operators on inclusive semileptonic B decays and the extraction of |V cb |. Using moments of semileptonic B decay spectra and information based on the Lowest-Lying State saturation Approximation (LLSA) we perform a global fit of the non-perturbative parameters of the heavy quark expansion including for the first time the O(1/m 4,5 b ) contributions. Higher power corrections appear to have a very small effect on the extraction of |V cb |, independently of the weight we attribute to the LLSA.</p>
        <p>The results of the B Factories and LHC place stringent constraints on new physics in the flavor sector. Only small deviations from the SM are allowed, and their detection represents an experimental and theoretical challenge. In the next few years a wealth of new experimental results will come from Belle-II and from the high-luminosity phase of LHC. In this context, the precise determination of the parameters of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix remains a high priority, as it is instrumental to constraining new physics models and to setting bounds on the scale of new effective interactions. However, the determination of the CKM element V cb , which plays a special role in tests of the CKM unitarity and in FCNC transitions, is plagued by a long-standing ∼3σ tension between the analyses based on inclusive and exclusive decays. This is unlikely to signal new physics [1] and calls for a thorough investigation of all possible sources of theoretical uncertainty.</p>
        <p>The determination of |V cb | from inclusive semileptonic B decays is based on an Operator Product Expansion (OPE) [2][3][4][5] which allows us to parameterize all of the non-perturbative physics in terms of the expectation values of local operators in the B-meson to be extracted from experimental data. Since the contribution of higher dimensional operators is suppressed by powers of the heavy quark mass, only the operators of low dimension are expected to be relevant. Current fits of inclusive semileptonic B decays [6] use experimental data on the moments of kinematic distributions to constrain the power corrections up to 1/m 3 b terms, corresponding to dimension ≤ 6 operators, and neglect higher power corrections altogether.</p>
        <p>While present data appear to be well described by these fits, investigations of higher power corrections are mandatory to test the convergence of the heavy quark mass expansion. Moreover, the OPE does not lead to an expansion of inclusive observables in inverse powers of m b but also contains terms of O(1/m n b 1/m k c ), with odd n ≥ 3 and even k ≥ 2, sometimes dubbed intrinsic charm (IC) contributions [7][8][9], which alter the actual power counting since numerically</p>
        <p>Higher power corrections have been studied in [10,11], where nine new operators of dimension 7 and eighteen new operators of dimension 8 have been identified and their Wilson coefficients computed at the tree-level. A rough estimate of the matrix elements of these 27 new operators is given by the Lowest-Lying State Approximation (LLSA) [11,12], which assumes that the lowest lying heavy meson states saturate a sum-rule for the insertion of a heavy meson state sum. The LLSA relates higher-order matrix elements to lower dimensional ones and to the excitation energy and is expected to be valid within 50-100% [12]. In this Letter, after briefly reviewing the structure of the 1/m inclusive observables considered below (width, moments of kinematic distributions) can be calculated by an appropriate (weighted) phase-space integral of the differential decay width</p>
        <p>where all the soft hadronic information is contained in the hadronic tensor W μν = -1 π Im T μν . The hadronic tensor is the imaginary part of the forward matrix element of a time-ordered product of weak currents. The charm quark in this forward matrix element propagates in a background field. We expand the background field propagator S BGF , with momentum</p>
        <p>The coefficients A (i,m) μ 1 μ 2 ...μ m containing the non-perturbative parameters are known analytically at O(1/m 2 b ) [4,5] (corresponding to m = 2), at O(1/m 3 b ) [13], and at order 1/m 4,5 b [11]. At the lowest non-trivial order, corresponding to dimension 5 operators, the non-perturbative parameters are given by</p>
        <p>where μν = g μνv μ v ν , and v μ is the heavy quark velocity.</p>
        <p>At each higher order in 1/m b we have one more derivative in A In the following we will include the O (1/m 4,5 b ) corrections in the fit to the semileptonic moments on which the inclusive determination of |V cb | is based. We will use the LLSA ansatz, proposed in [11] and made more systematic in [12], to constrain the 27 new parameters.</p>
        <p>The goal of LLSA is to estimate expectation values of local op-</p>
        <p>where is a Dirac matrix. Splitting the chain of covariant derivatives into two shorter ones labeled by A k 1 and C n k and inserting a full set of intermediate states between them one finds in the heavy quark limit [11,12] LLSA expressions for the higher-order non-perturbative parameters.</p>
        <p>states, with parity opposite to that of the ground state. Including these states in the sum leads to extra powers of the P -wave excitation energy, = M P -M B . While there exist separate contributions coming from the spin 1 2 , 3 2 light degrees of freedom, we assume</p>
        <p>In the following we use the notation of [11], according to which the nine matrix elements that occur at O (1/m 4 ) are denoted by m i , and the eighteen at O (1/m 5 ) by r i . The operators involved coincide with those identified in [12], even though different notations are adopted. It is useful to redefine the 1/m 4 b parameters to account for combinatorial factors. In practice, we expand the (anti-)commutators and count the number of terms after expunging those which are of higher order in 1/m b due to the equations of motion. We then expect the parameters to have a natural scale of O ( n Q C D ), with n the dimension of the corresponding operator, as is also the case for the parameters in Eq. ( 3). The rescaled parameters are</p>
        <p>No such redefinition is necessary for the 1/m 5 b parameters, as they were already defined in this way. The LLSA expressions for the m i , r i are reported in Table 1.</p>
        <p>The OPE allows us to express sufficiently inclusive observ-</p>
        <p>where E is the lepton energy, m 2 X the invariant hadronic mass squared and E cut an experimental lower cut on the lepton energy applied by the experiments. The cut dependence of the moments provides additional information on the OPE parameters we are fitting. For moments with n &gt; 1, it is convenient to employ central moments, computed relative to E ≡ 1 and m 2 X ≡ h 1 ,</p>
        <p>We also have information on the lepton energy cut dependence of the inclusive width, which can be studied introducing R * = E &gt;E cut / tot . The information on the non-perturbative parameters obtained from a fit to these observables enables us to then extract</p>
        <p>|V cb | from the total semileptonic width [6,[21][22][23][24].</p>
        <p>All analyses have so far considered only the minimal set of four matrix elements which appear at O(1/m 2,3 b ). The O(1/m 4,5 b ) contributions have never been included, although a rough estimate of their importance has been given in [11]. From the results of that paper we have computed all the O(1/m 4,5 b ) corrections to the first three hadronic and leptonic moments and to R * ; we will now employ these expressions in the global fit to determine |V cb |.</p>
        <p>The result for the width is given in the Appendix. Notice that normalized moments are ratios of two heavy quark expansions; re-expanding these ratios in inverse powers of m b one finds that</p>
        <p>We upgrade the fit strategy introduced in [24] in the kinetic scheme, and use as a baseline the default parameters and settings most recently employed in [6]. In particular, we use the same experimental data; the full list of available measurements [25][26][27][28][29][30][31] and the leptonic energy cuts employed in the fit is given in Table 1 of Ref. [24]. We also employ the MS scheme for the charm mass and use the constraints m c (3 GeV) = 0.986 (13) GeV [32],</p>
        <p>The inclusion of higher power corrections allows us to slightly decrease the theoretical errors, which are estimated using the method of Ref. [24], i.e. varying the HQE parameters by fixed amounts in the calculation of an observable. Here we use the same settings as in [6], except for the variation in ρ 3 D,L S , which we decrease from 30% to 22%, to take into account the inclusion of O(1/m 4 , 5) power corrections. For what concerns the correlations among theoretical errors we choose scenario D of Ref. [24], where different central moments are uncorrelated and the correlation between measurements of the same moment with E cut differing by 100 MeV is given by a factor which becomes smaller for increasing E cut .</p>
        <p>The results of the default fit performed in [6] G . Ref. [12] estimates a ∼50%</p>
        <p>uncertainty, which obviously does not hold when the LLSA leads to zero matrix elements. Ref. [33] in Sec. 6.5 found indications for large non-factorisable corrections, which could reach 100% in some expectation values not affected by cancellations. Dimensionally, we know that the non-perturbative parameters of the OPE are</p>
        <p>There are in fact two scales involved in their determination: M Bm b and the mass splitting 0.4 GeV between the B meson and the lowest P -wave excitation. Accordingly, we prescribe the error to be the maximum of either 60% of the parameter's value or n LL /2 (n = 4, 5), where we use a scale LL = 0.55 GeV which roughly corresponds to the average of the two relevant scales. The fit is performed starting with LLSA central values based on Eq. ( 8) and = 0.4 GeV. The LLSA central values are then updated to the results of the new fit, iterating the procedure until the results stabilize.</p>
        <p>We report the results of the default fit in Table 2. In Fig. 1 we compare the μ 2 π ,G , ρ 3 D,L S results of the 2014 fit in (8) with those of the new default fit. We also compare the LLSA predictions for m i , r i based on (8) with the results of the default fit. The LLSA uncertainty is computed as explained in the previous paragraph. We can see that most of the new parameters do not change much from their LLSA value, reflecting the low sensitivity of the fit to higher power parameters. However, there are exceptions, especially among the m i : the largest shift occurs for m 2 and corresponds to 1.2σ LL S A . Indeed, the hadronic moments at higher cuts are specif- ically sensitive to some of the m i , see Eqs. (11) in the Appendix.</p>
        <p>Using the fit results we compute the total semileptonic width, also reported in the Appendix, and comparing it to the BR in Table 2 divided by τ B , we get |V cb |. The value of |V cb | is remarkably close to that obtained in [6] and the quality of the fit is very good, χ 2 /dof = 0.46, but somewhat higher than in [6].</p>
        <p>To verify the stability of the fit with respect to the choices we made for the LLSA uncertainty, we varied this uncertainty by a multiplicative factor ξ . The results are shown in Fig. 2: |V cb | changes very little. Of course, increasing the uncertainty on the higher-order matrix elements too much is equivalent to ignoring the LLSA completely, which would be unwise. We can therefore</p>
        <p>We will include this uncertainty in the final error on |V cb |. We also vary over the range 0.4 ± 0.1 GeV to gauge the related uncertainty. The dependence of the parameters on the choice of excitation energy can be seen in Fig. 3, and the resulting relative uncertainties are</p>
        <p>which are mostly negligible. We also repeated the default fit in two slightly different ways: i) adding the PDG constraint on m b [34] after a scheme conversion, m kin b = 4.550(42) GeV, which leads to |V cb | = 42.10(73) 10 -3 ; ii) changing, in addition to that, the m c constraint into m c (2 GeV) = 1.091 (14) GeV, obtained evolving the result of [32] to 2 GeV. This leads to a somewhat better convergence of the perturbative series for the semileptonic width [17]; in this case |V cb | = 42.00(64) 10 -3 and χ 2 /dof = 0.44. The results of all these fits are remarkably consistent with each other.</p>
        <p>The central hadronic moments are sensitive probes of power corrections. For instance, O(1/m 4,5 b ) affect h 3 in a significant way and one could expect even higher moments to be able to constrain the higher power contributions in a useful way. As DELPHI has measured h 4,5 without a cut on the lepton energy [31], we have computed h 4 to explore the possibility of including them in the fit, despite the high correlation with lower hadronic moments. The result, in GeV</p>
        <p>We have studied the effect of higher power corrections on the fits to inclusive semileptonic B decays which determine |V cb |. Because of the large number of new parameters at O(1/m 4,5 b ), we used the LLSA to provide loose constraints on the higher power matrix elements and performed a new global fit to the semileptonic moments. The total semileptonic width can be written as</p>
        <p>where |H n are hadronic states with the appropriate quantum numbers. The LLSA assumes that the sum of intermediate states is saturated by the lowest-lying state that can contribute, i.e. either the ground-state multiplet B, B * or the first excited states with = 1. Indeed, the matrix elements involving time derivatives like B| bi D j i D k 0 i D l b|B are saturated by P -wave intermediate</p>
        <p>The higher power corrections have a minor effect on |V cb | and on the expectation values of the lower dimensional operators, and we observe a good convergence of the heavy mass expansion. There is a -0.25% reduction in |V cb | 10 3 |V cb | = 42.11(53)(50)(07)(10) = 42.11(74),</p>
        <p>where the four errors are, respectively, the parametric error from the fit, the theoretical error on the semileptonic width, and those due to the τ</p>
