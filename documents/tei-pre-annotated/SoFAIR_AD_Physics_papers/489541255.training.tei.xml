        <p>The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) is a precision particle physics detector on the International Space Station (ISS) conducting a unique, long-duration mission of fundamental physics research in space. The physics objectives include the precise studies of the origin of dark matter, antimatter, and cosmic rays as well as the exploration of new phenomena. Following a 16-year period of construction and testing, and a precursor flight on the Space Shuttle, AMS was installed on the ISS on May 19, 2011. In this report we present results based on 120 billion charged cosmic ray events up to multi-TeV energies. This includes the fluxes of positrons, electrons, antiprotons, protons, and nuclei. These results provide unexpected information, which cannot be explained by the current theoretical models. The accuracy and characteristics of the data, simultaneously from many different types of cosmic rays, provide unique input to the understanding of origins, acceleration, and propagation of cosmic rays.The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) is a precision particle physics detector on the International Space Station (ISS) conducting a unique, long-duration mission of fundamental physics research in space.

AMS-01 results were published in Physics Reports, ''The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) on the International Space Station: Part I -results from the test flight on the space shuttle'' [1]. With the experience accumulated from AMS-01, a new state of the art detector, known as AMS-02 or AMS on the ISS, was built and launched on the Space Shuttle Endeavour and installed on the ISS on May 19, 2011 (see Fig. 1). The ISS is orbiting the Earth at an altitude of ∼ 410 km with an orbit inclination of 52 degrees.The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) is a precision particle physics detector on the International Space Station (ISS) conducting a unique, long-duration mission of fundamental physics research in space.

            <rs type="software">geant4 package</rs> [37] and it is constantly being improved with the AMS data obtained on the ISS. This Monte Carlo program simulates electromagnetic, hadronic, and nuclear interactions of particles and nuclei in the material of AMS, namely: Fig. 1. AMS is a unique precision magnetic spectrometer on the ISS. AMS will operate on the ISS for the Station's lifetime. It is mounted on the ISS with a 12 degree angle to the zenith to prevent that the rotating ISS solar arrays are in the AMS field of view. Fig. 2. The AMS detector showing the main elements and their functions. AMS is a TeV precision, multipurpose particle physics magnetic spectrometer. It identifies particles and nuclei by their charge (Z ), energy (E) and momentum (P) or rigidity (R = P/Z ), which are measured independently by the Tracker, TOF, RICH and ECAL. The ACC counters, located in the magnet bore, are used to reject particles entering AMS from the side. The AMS coordinate system, concentric with the magnet, is also shown. The x axis is parallel to the main component of the magnetic field and the z axis is pointing vertically. The Radius and Phi Angle are cylindrical coordinates in the x-y plane, such that Phi=0 corresponds to the x-axis.

        <p>The permanent magnet [38], shown in Fig. 3a, was flown on the AMS engineering flight in 1998 and was described in detail in the AMS-01 Physics Report [1]. It is made of 64 high-grade Nd-Fe-B sectors assembled in a cylindrical shell 800 mm long with an inner diameter of 1115 mm. This configuration produces a field of 1.4 kG at the center of the magnet and negligible dipole moment and field leakage outside the magnet (see Fig. 3b). This is important in order to eliminate the effect of torque on the ISS and to ensure safety of astronauts. The detailed 3-dimensional field of the magnet was mapped in 2010 and is shown in Fig. 3c. The field was measured in 120,000 locations to an accuracy of better than 1%. Comparison with the measurements performed with the same magnet in 1997, before the engineering flight AMS-01, shows that the field did not change within 1%, limited by the accuracy of the 1997 measurement, as shown in Fig. 3d.The permanent magnet [38], shown in Fig. 3a, was flown on the AMS engineering flight in 1998 and was described in detail in the AMS-01 Physics Report [1].

        <p>The tracker, together with the magnet, accurately determines the trajectory and charge Z of cosmic rays by multiple measurements of the coordinates (x and y) and energy loss. It is composed of 192 ladders, each containing double-sided silicon sensors, readout electronics, and mechanical support [38,39]. The AMS tracker has nine layers, L1-L9, and 196,608 readout channels. As shown in Fig. 4a, three planes of aluminum honeycomb with carbon fiber skins are equipped with ladders on both sides. The layers on these planes are numbered L3-L8. Another three planes are equipped with one layer of ladders each, numbered L1, L2, and L9. As also indicated in Fig. 4a, L1 is located on top of the TRD, L2 is above the magnet, and L9 is between the RICH and the ECAL. L9 covers the ECAL acceptance. L2-L8 constitute the inner tracker. The total lever arm of the tracker from L1 to L9 is 3.0 m. From the trajectory and the magnetic field map, the tracker measurement directly yields the rigidity or momentum per unit charge, R = P/Z . Positions of the planes of the inner tracker are held stable by a special carbon fiber structure [1]. It is monitored using 20 IR laser beams, which penetrate through all planes of the inner Tracker and provide micron level accuracy position measurements. The positions of L1 and L9 are aligned using cosmic ray protons every 2 min. As seen in Figs. 4b and4c, they are stable to 2-3 µm.The tracker, together with the magnet, accurately determines the trajectory and charge Z of cosmic rays by multiple measurements of the coordinates (x and y) and energy loss.

        <p>The tracker independently measures the x and y coordinates. The y strips have a much finer implantation pitch of 27.5 µm (with 110 µm readout pitch) compared to the x strips (implantation pitch of 104 µm and readout pitch of 208 µm) to provide better accuracy of the coordinate measurement in the bending direction, which is important for the determination of the rigidity (or momentum) [40]. This provides spatial resolution of 5 -10 µm in the bending plane and 13 -20 µm in the non-bending plane.The tracker independently measures the x and y coordinates.

        <p>Once a track has been found, its rigidity is determined using a track-fitting algorithm based on the Kalman filtering technique. It accurately accounts for energy losses and multiple scattering by charged particles [42]. For low rigidities (&lt; 20 GV) the ∆R/R is 0.1. This is particularly important for the measurements of nuclear isotopes. The maximum detectable rigidity (MDR) with this algorithm is 2.0 TV for protons, 3.2 TV for helium, 3.7 TV for carbon, 3.4 TV for oxygen, and 3.7 TV for iron.Once a track has been found, its rigidity is determined using a track-fitting algorithm based on the Kalman filtering technique.

        <p>Test beam data are important in understanding the tracker performance. Fig. 9a shows the comparison between data and the Monte Carlo simulation of the inverse rigidity measured by the tracker for 400 GeV/c protons from the CERN test beam. As seen, the Monte Carlo simulation describes not only detector resolution effects (the central part of the distribution) but also the effects of interactions with the detector materials including multiple, large angle, elastic, and quasi-elastic scattering (the tails of the distribution). Fig. 9 shows that the agreement between the data and the Monte Carlo simulation extends over five orders of magnitude. To study the tracker performance beyond the test beam momentum (400 GeV/c proton beam), we used the data from the ISS to compare the rigidity measured using the upper layers of the tracker, layers L1 to L8, with the rigidity measured with the lower layers, L2 to L9. Fig. 9b shows that the difference of these inverse rigidities is centered at zero and in good agreement with the Monte Carlo simulation for the rigidity range [1130-1800] GV.Test beam data are important in understanding the tracker performance.

        <p>Reconstruction of the showers from electrons and positrons in the calorimeter uses a 3-dimensional parametrization, which accounts for the detector specifics: the finite size of the calorimeter, the non-uniform efficiency of the signal collection, and saturation effects due to the electronics and due to large energy deposition in calorimeter cells. An electromagnetic shower is described by seven parameters, which fully determine the measured pattern of energy depositions in the calorimeter cells [53]: the shower energy (E 0 ); the 3-dimensional spatial point (x 0 , y 0 , z 0 ) corresponding to the location of the shower maximum; the two angles (K X , K Y ), which together with the spatial point, define the shower axis; and the location (T 0 ) of the shower maximum on the shower axis. This is a minimal parameter set, which allows accurate shower parametrization without introducing correlation between these parameters.Reconstruction of the showers from electrons and positrons in the calorimeter uses a 3-dimensional parametrization, which accounts for the detector specifics: the finite size of the calorimeter, the non-uniform efficiency of the signal collection, and saturation effects due to the electronics and due to large energy deposition in calorimeter cells.

        <p>The saturation in the electronics is insignificant over the energy range of interest, the remaining saturation is in the calorimeter fibers. It is related to conversion of ionization to light. As illustrated in Fig. 26, the effect is maximal near the shower peak, whereas for the rest of the shower, the cells are not affected. Using non-saturated cells allows an accurate accounting for the amount of saturation. For high energy showers (&gt; 500 GeV), some of the amplitudes are saturated, for example, those shaded in red. The saturation effect is taken into account [53] using the energy dependence of the maximum cell amplitude in the shower. This is illustrated in Fig. 27 using a sample of high-energy electrons. There is good agreement between the data and the Monte Carlo simulation when saturation effects are accounted.

        <p>ECAL is used to separate electrons and positrons from protons using the same shower parametrization as used for the energy reconstruction. This is achieved by using an ECAL estimator Λ ECAL . The estimator includes variables which measure the compatibility of energy depositions in the calorimeter cells with that of an electromagnetic shower. It also includes variables that measure the consistency of the shower parameter values (like z 0 and T 0 ) with those expected for an electromagnetic shower of energy E 0 . Altogether, there are 16 variables included in the definition of Λ ECAL [53]. The proton rejection power, which combines the Λ ECAL with the energy-momentum matching (E/p &gt; 0.7), is evaluated as a function of rigidity as shown in Fig. 29. As seen, the proton rejection can be further increased with a tighter Λ ECAL cut. With the tighter Λ ECAL cut the electron and positron selection efficiency is reduced correspondingly.ECAL is used to separate electrons and positrons from protons using the same shower parametrization as used for the energy reconstruction.

        <p>In the entire energy range the electron and positron spectra have distinctly different magnitudes and energy dependences. The different behavior of the cosmic-ray electrons and positrons measured by AMS is clear evidence that most high energy electrons originate from different sources than high energy positrons.

        <p>There are four charged elementary particles traveling through the cosmos: protons, electrons, positrons, and antiprotons. The experimental data on antiprotons are limited because of low production rate: for each antiproton there are approximately 10 4 protons. Since the observation of antiprotons in cosmic rays [104], many studies of cosmic ray antiprotons have been performed [105][106][107][108][109]. However, to measure the antiproton flux to ∼ 3% accuracy requires a separation power of ∼10 6 between the antiproton signal and background from protons. Precision measurements of the cosmic ray antiproton flux are as important as measurements of cosmic ray positrons since both species are antiparticles that have to be created in high-energy processes rather then just being accelerated from the interstellar medium by a passing shock wave.There are four charged elementary particles traveling through the cosmos: protons, electrons, positrons, and antiprotons.

As discussed in Sections 3 and 4, these particles are considered primary cosmic rays, but with distinctly different energy dependences. In the entire energy range, the electron energy spectrum is described by a sum of two power law functions (Eq.

As seen in Fig. 64, above ∼10 GeV, electrons exhibit much softer energy dependence compared to protons. This is commonly attributed to energy losses by electrons during the propagation in the interstellar medium (including interstellar gas, magnetic fields, and photons) [117]. Contrary to electrons, positrons have distinctly different energy dependence in the entire energy range as shown in Fig. 65.

As seen in Fig. 64, above ∼10 GeV, electrons exhibit much softer energy dependence compared to protons. This is commonly attributed to energy losses by electrons during the propagation in the interstellar medium (including interstellar gas, magnetic fields, and photons) [117]. Contrary to electrons, positrons have distinctly different energy dependence in the entire energy range as shown in Fig. 65. This is clear evidence that cosmic ray electrons and positrons originate from completely different sources (see also discussion in Sections 2 and 3).</p>
        <p>In Fig. 66, we compare our measured spectra of positrons and protons (see Sections 2 and 4). The two spectra are normalized at 60 GeV. As seen, the positron spectrum E 3 Φ e + decreases with increasing energy above 284 GeV. This is in contrast with the proton spectrum, which continuously increases in the entire energy range. Another surprising observation is that the positron spectrum is harder then the proton spectrum in the energy range from 60 to ∼260 GeV.In Fig. 66, we compare our measured spectra of positrons and protons (see Sections 2 and 4).

        <p>To measure the cosmic nuclear interaction cross sections, we follow the procedure described in detail in Ref. [119]. In particular, the survival probabilities of light nuclei are measured using the data acquired when the ISS attitude was such that AMS is pointing horizontally as shown in Fig. 70a. In these conditions, cosmic nuclei can pass in either direction through AMS, from L8 to L1 as shown in Fig. 70b and from L2 to L9 as shown in Fig. 70c. In either direction, particles were identified by their dE/dx in the seven inner tracker layers L2-L8 and their rigidities measured. The upper TOF and TRD are between L2-L8 and L1, see Fig. 70b. To measure the survival probability for nuclei to traverse this material, the charge distributions in L2-L8 and L1 are compared. Similarly, we measured the survival probability for nuclei to traverse the material from L8 to L9, the lower TOF and RICH, see Fig. 70c. The survival probabilities from L8 to L9 have also been measured during AMS nominal ISS orientation. The small (&lt; 3%) interaction probability between tracker L2 and L8 was calculated by comparing the charge measurements between the upper and the lower TOF.

        <p>Protons and helium are both primary cosmic rays. Traditionally, in models of diffusive-shock-acceleration, they are assumed to be produced in the same sources with the identical power law spectra, so their rigidity dependence should be the same [123]. In absence of the precision data on the proton and helium fluxes, various models of cosmic ray acceleration and diffusion mechanisms were proposed, that lead to different behavior of the proton and helium fluxes [124]. These mechanisms, based on cosmic ray acceleration, predict that the proton-to-helium ratio is decreasing steadily with rigidity, from sub-GV to multi-TV. Other, more complex models [125], predict that the proton-to-helium ratio is decreasing in the range from ∼10 GV to ∼1000 GV and flattens asymptotically above 1000 GV, where the energy losses are negligible.Protons and helium are both primary cosmic rays.

These results indicate there are two kinds of cosmic ray rigidity dependences. These observations have generated new developments in cosmic ray models [121,122]. The theoretical models have their limitations, as none of them predicted the observed spectral behavior of the cosmic rays. The results on heavier primary cosmic rays Ne, Mg, and Si show that primary cosmic rays have at least two distinct classes of rigidity dependence. These unexpected results together with ongoing measurements of heavier elements in cosmic rays will enable us to determine how many classes of rigidity dependence exist in both primary and secondary cosmic rays and provide important information for the development of the theoretical models.Rigidity GV.

        <p>Strangelets are a proposed new form of matter made out of u, d, and s quarks instead of known nuclei which are made of u and d quarks [163]. J. Sandweiss and his group pioneered the experimental search for strangelets using accelerators [164] and lunar soil [165].

The unique characteristic of strangelets is Z /A &lt; 0.1 [163,164]. To search for strangelets we used inner tracker L2 to L8 to measure the rigidity and the TOF to measure the velocity.

        <p>Cosmic rays entering the heliosphere are subject to diffusion, convection, adiabatic energy losses, and magnetic drift. The temporal evolution of these processes leads to cosmic ray intensity variation at Earth's orbit around the Sun. These variations correlate with solar activity, which has several cycles. The most significant is the 11-year solar cycle during which the number of sunspots changes from minimum to maximum and then back to a minimum. Another is the 22-year cycle of the Sun's magnetic field polarity, which reverses every 11 years during the maxima of the solar cycle. Cosmic ray spectra may also have temporary reductions due to the interactions of cosmic rays with strong disturbances in the magnetic field, especially during solar maxima, that can last from days to months. Time correlations at low rigidity among different particle spectra (p, He) due to solar modulation are expected by models of cosmic ray transport based on the Parker equation. This is because the time-dependent cosmic ray transport in the heliosphere is rigidity dependent and related to changes in solar activity. Numerous models of the propagation of charged particles in the heliosphere exist that predict different flux variations with time. The large acceptance and high precision of AMS allow us to perform accurate measurements of the fluxes as functions of time and energy. This provides unique information to probe the dynamics of solar modulation, to allow the improvement of constraints for dark matter searches, to investigate the processes of galactic cosmic ray propagation, and to reduce the uncertainties in radiation dose predictions for deep space human exploration.Cosmic rays entering the heliosphere are subject to diffusion, convection, adiabatic energy losses, and magnetic drift.

        <p>Time-dependent structures in the energy spectra are expected from the solar modulation of interstellar cosmic rays when they enter the heliosphere. Solar modulation involves convective, diffusive, particle drift, and adiabatic energy loss processes. Only particle drift induces a dependence of solar modulation on the particle charge sign. Since electrons and positrons differ only in charge sign, their simultaneous measurement offers a unique way to study charge-sign dependent solar modulation effects. For the first time, the charge-sign dependent modulation during solar maximum has been investigated in detail by leptons alone by AMS [177]. Based on 23.5 million events, we observed short-time structures, on the time scale of months, coincident in both the electron flux and the positron flux. The fluxes are shown in Fig. 109 The long-term time structure of the data in Fig. 109 shows that the changes in relative amplitude are different for electrons and positrons. To quantify this effect, we use the ratio R e = Φ e + /Φ e -, shown in Fig. 110 for one energy bin. In R e , the important short-term variations in the fluxes largely cancel, and a clear overall long-term trend appears. At low energies, R e is flat at first, then smoothly increases after the time of the solar magnetic field reversal, to reach a plateau at a higher amplitude.Time-dependent structures in the energy spectra are expected from the solar modulation of interstellar cosmic rays when they enter the heliosphere.

        <p>In conclusion, for the first time, the charge-sign dependent modulation during solar maximum has been investigated in detail by leptons alone. We observe prominent, distinct, and coincident structures in both the positron flux and the electron flux on a time scale of months. These structures are not visible in the e + /e -flux ratio. We also observe the existence of a long-term feature in the e + /e -flux ratio, namely, a smooth transition from one value to another, after the polarity reversal of the solar magnetic field. The duration of the transition is measured to be 830 ± 30 days, independent of energy. The transition magnitude is decreasing as a function of energy. The midpoint of the transition relative to the polarity reversal of the solar magnetic field changes by 260 ± 30 days from 1 to 6 GeV. These high-statistics, precision data on positrons and electrons provide accurate input to the understanding of solar modulation.In conclusion, for the first time, the charge-sign dependent modulation during solar maximum has been investigated in detail by leptons alone.

        <p>The carbon to oxygen flux ratio C/O as a function of rigidity including errors due to statistics (σ stat ); contributions to the systematic error from the trigger, acceptance, and background (σ acc ); the rigidity resolution function and unfolding (σ unf ); the absolute rigidity scale (σ scale ); and the total systematic error (σ syst ). The statistical errors are the sum in quadrature of the ratios of carbon and oxygen fluxes statistical errors to the corresponding flux values, multiplied by the flux ratio. The systematic errors from the background subtraction, the trigger, and the event reconstruction and selection are likewise added in quadrature. The correlations in the systematic errors from the uncertainty in nuclear interaction cross sections, the unfolding and the absolute rigidity scale between the carbon and oxygenfluxes have been taken into account in calculating the corresponding systematic errors of the flux ratio. The contribution of individual sources to the systematic error are added in quadrature to arrive at the total systematic uncertainty.The carbon to oxygen flux ratio C/O as a function of rigidity including errors due to statistics (σ stat ); contributions to the systematic error from the trigger, acceptance, and background (σ acc ); the rigidity resolution function and unfolding (σ unf ); the absolute rigidity scale (σ scale ); and the total systematic error (σ syst ).
