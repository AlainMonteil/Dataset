        <p>We present a practical three-step procedure of using the Standard Model effective field theory (SM EFT) to connect ultraviolet (UV) models of new physics with weak scale precision observables. With this procedure, one can interpret precision measurements as constraints on a given UV model. We give a detailed explanation for calculating the effective action up to one-loop order in a manifestly gauge covariant fashion. This covariant derivative expansion method dramatically simplifies the process of matching a UV model with the SM EFT, and also makes available a universal formalism that is easy to use for a variety of UV models. A few general aspects of RG running effects and choosing operator bases are discussed. Finally, we provide mapping results between the bosonic sector of the SM EFT and a complete set of precision electroweak and Higgs observables to which present and near future experiments are sensitive. Many results and tools which should prove useful to those wishing to use the SM EFT are detailed in several appendices.We present a practical three-step procedure of using the Standard Model effective field theory (SM EFT) to connect ultraviolet (UV) models of new physics with weak scale precision observables.

        <p>The discovery of a Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs boson [1,2] is a milestone in particle physics. Direct study of this boson will shed light on the mysteries surrounding the origin of the Higgs boson and the electroweak (EW) scale. Additionally, it will potentially provide insight into some of the many long standing experimental observations that remain unexplained (see, e.g., [3]) by the SM. In attempting to answer questions raised by the EW sector and these presently unexplained observations, a variety of new physics models have been proposed, with little clue which -if any -Nature actually picks.The discovery of a Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs boson [1,2] is a milestone in particle physics.

        <p>It is exciting that ongoing and possible near future experiments can achieve an estimated per mille sensitivity on precision Higgs and EW observables [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13].

        <p>It is worth noting that the SM EFT parameterized by the c i of eq. (1.1) is totally different from the widely used seven-κ parametrization (e.g., [14]), which captures only a change in size of each of the SM-type Higgs couplings. In fact, the seven κ's parameterize JHEP01(2016)023 models that do not respect the electroweak gauge symmetry, and hence, violate unitarity. As a result, future precision programs can show spuriously high sensitivity to the κ. The SM EFT of eq. (1.1), on the other hand, parameterizes new physics in directions that respect the SM gauge invariance and are therefore free from unitarity violations. 1 In an EFT framework, the connection of UV models 2 with low-energy observables is accomplished through a three-step procedure schematically described in figure 1. 3 First, the UV model is matched onto the SM EFT at a high-energy scale Λ. This matching is performed order-by-order in a loop expansion. At each loop order, c i (Λ) is determined such that the S-matrix elements in the EFT and the UV model are the same at the RG scale µ = Λ. Next, the c i (Λ) are run down to the weak scale c i (m W ) according to the RG equations of the SM EFT. The leading order solution to these RG equations is determined by the anomalous dimension matrix γ ij . Finally, we use the effective Lagrangian at µ = m W to compute weak scale observables in terms of the c i (m W ) and SM parameters of L SM . We refer to this third step as mapping the Wilson coefficients onto observables.It is worth noting that the SM EFT parameterized by the c i of eq.

        <p>In the rest of this paper we consider each of these three steps -matching, running, and mapping -in detail for the SM EFT. In the SM EFT, the main challenge presented at each step is complexity: truncating the expansion in (1.1) at dimension-six operators leaves us with O(10 2 ) independent deformations of the Standard Model. 4 This large number of JHEP01(2016)023 degrees of freedom can obscure the incredible simplicity and utility that the SM EFT has to offer. One of the main purposes of the present work is to provide tools and results to help a user employ the SM EFT and take advantage of the many benefits it can offer.In the rest of this paper we consider each of these three steps -matching, running, and mapping -in detail for the SM EFT.

        <p>A typical scenario that we imagine is one where a person has some UV model containing massive BSM states and she wishes to understand how these states affect Higgs and EW observables. With a UV model in hand she can, of course, compute these effects using the UV model itself. This option sounds more direct and can, in principle, be more accurate since it does not require an expansion in powers of Λ -1 . However, performing a full computation with the UV model is typically quite involved, especially at loop-order and beyond, and needs to be done on a case-by-case basis for each UV model. Among the great advantages of using an EFT is that the computations related to running and mapping, being intrinsic to the EFT, only need to be done once; in other words, once the RG evolution and physical effects of the O i are known (to a given order), the results can be tabulated for general use.A typical scenario that we imagine is one where a person has some UV model containing massive BSM states and she wishes to understand how these states affect Higgs and EW observables.

        <p>Moreover, for many practical purposes, a full computation in the UV model does not offer considerable improvement in accuracy over the EFT approach when one considers future experimental resolution. The difference between an observable computed using the UV theory versus the (truncated) EFT will scale in powers of E obs /Λ, typically beginning at (E obs /Λ) 2 , where E obs ∼ m W is the energy scale at which the observable is measured. The present lack of evidence for BSM physics coupled to the SM requires in many cases Λ to be at least a factor of a few above the weak scale. With an estimated per mille precision of future Higgs and EW observables, this means that the leading order calculation in the EFT will rapidly converge with the calculation from the UV model, providing essentially the same result for Λ (several × E obs ). 5 For the purpose of determining the physics reach of future experiments on specific UV models -i.e. estimating the largest values of Λ in a given model that experiments can probe -the EFT calculation is sufficiently accurate in almost all cases.Moreover, for many practical purposes, a full computation in the UV model does not offer considerable improvement in accuracy over the EFT approach when one considers future experimental resolution.

        <p>As mentioned above, the steps of RG running the O i and mapping these operators to observables are done within the EFT; once these results are known they can be applied to any set of {c i (Λ)} obtained from matching a given UV model onto the SM EFT. Therefore, an individual wishing to study the impact of some UV model on weak scale observables "only" needs to obtain the c i (Λ) at the matching scale Λ. We put "only" in quotes because this step, while straightforward, can also be computationally complex owing to the large number of operators in the SM EFT.As mentioned above, the steps of RG running the O i and mapping these operators to observables are done within the EFT; once these results are known they can be applied to any set of {c i (Λ)} obtained from matching a given UV model onto the SM EFT.

        <p>A large amount of literature pertaining to the SM EFT already exists, some of which dates back a few decades, and is rapidly growing and evolving. Owing to the complexity of the SM EFT, many results are scattered throughout the literature at varying levels of completeness. This body of research can be difficult to wade through for a newcomer (or expert) wishing to use the SM EFT to study the impact of BSM physics on Higgs and EW observables. We believe an explication from a UV perspective, oriented to consider how one uses the SM EFT as a bridge to connect UV models with weak-scale precision observables, JHEP01(2016)023 is warranted. We have strived to give such a perspective by providing new results and tools with the full picture of matching, running, and mapping in mind. Moreover, our results are aimed to be complete and systematic -especially in regards to the mapping onto observables -as well as usable and self-contained. These goals have obviously contributed to the considerable length of this paper. In the rest of this introduction, we summarize more explicitly our results in order to provide an overview for what is contained where in this paper.A large amount of literature pertaining to the SM EFT already exists, some of which dates back a few decades, and is rapidly growing and evolving.

        <p>In section 2, we present a method to considerably ease the matching of a UV model onto the SM EFT. The SM EFT is obtained by taking a given UV model and integrating out the massive BSM states. The resultant effective action is given by (1.1), where the higher dimension operators are suppressed by powers of Λ = m, the mass of the heavy BSM states. Although every O i respects SM gauge invariance, traditional methods of evaluating the effective action, such as Feynman diagrams, require working with gauge non-invariant pieces at intermediate steps, so that the process of arranging an answer back into the gauge invariant O i can be quite tedious. Utilizing techniques introduced in [20,21] and termed the covariant derivative expansion (CDE), we present a method of computing the effective action through one-loop order in a manifestly gauge-invariant manner. By working solely with gauge-covariant quantities, an expansion of the effective action is obtained that immediately produces the gauge-invariant operators O i of the EFT and their associated Wilson coefficients.In section 2, we present a method to considerably ease the matching of a UV model onto the SM EFT.

        <p>where D 2 = D µ D µ with D µ a gauge covariant derivative and U (x) depends on the light, SM fields. The typical method for evaluating the functional trace relies on splitting the covariant derivative into its component parts, D µ = ∂ µ -iA µ with A µ a gauge field, and performing a derivative expansion in ∂ 2 -m 2 . This splitting clearly causes intermediate steps of the calculation to be gauge non-covariant. Many years ago, Gaillard found a transformation [20] that allows the functional trace to be evaluated while keeping gauge covariance manifest at every step of the calculation, which we derive and explain in detail in section 2. In essence, the argument of the logarithm in eq. (1.2) is transformed such that the covariant derivative only appears in a series of commutators with itself and U (x). The effective action is then evaluated in a series of "free propagators" of the form (q 2 -m 2 ) -1 with q µ a momentum parameter that is integrated over. The coefficients of this expansion are the commutators of D µ with itself and U (x) and correspond to the O i of the EFT. Thus, one immediately obtains the gauge-invariant O i of the effective action.where D 2 = D µ D µ with D µ a gauge covariant derivative and U (x) depends on the light, SM fields.

Moreover, we generalize the results of [20,21] and provide explicit formulas for scalars, fermions, and massless as well as massive vector bosons.

        <p>for obtaining the tree-level effective action using a covariant derivative expansion. While this tree-level evaluation is very straightforward, to the best of our knowledge, it has not appeared elsewhere in the literature. We believe the CDE to be quite useful in general, but especially so when used to match a UV model onto the SM EFT. It is perhaps not widely appreciated that an inverse mass expansion of the one-loop effective action is essentially universal; one of the benefits of the CDE is that this fact is transparent at all stages of the computation. Therefore, the results of the inverse mass expansion, eq. (2.54), can be applied to a large number of UV models, allowing one to calculate one-loop matched Wilson coefficients with ease. To demonstrate this, we compute the Wilson coefficients of a handful of non-trivial examples that could be relevant for Higgs physics, including an electroweak triplet scalar, an electroweak scalar doublet (the two Higgs doublet model), additional massive gauge bosons, and several others.for obtaining the tree-level effective action using a covariant derivative expansion.

        <p>In section 3 we consider the step of running Wilson coefficients from the matching scale Λ to the electroweak scale m W where measurements are made. Over the past few years, the RG evolution of the SM EFT has been investigated quite intensively [24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34]. It is a great accomplishment that the entire one-loop anomalous dimension matrix within a complete operator basis has been obtained [26][27][28][29], 6 as well as components of γ ij in other operator bases [30,31]. As the literature has been quite thorough on the subject, we have little to contribute in terms of new calculations; instead, our discussion on RG running primarily concerns determining when this step is important to use and how to use it. Since future precision observables have a sensitivity of O(0.1%)-O(1%), they will generically be able to probe new physics at one-loop order. RG evolution introduces a loop factor; therefore, as a rule of thumb, RG running of the c i (Λ) to c i (m W ) is usually only important if the c i (Λ) are tree-level generated. RG evolution includes a logarithm which may serve to counter its loop suppression; however, from v 2 /Λ 2 ∼ 0.1%, we see that Λ can be probed at most to a few TeV, so that the logarithm is not large, log(Λ/m W ) ∼ 3. We note that this estimate also means that in a perturbative expansion a truncation by loop-order counting is reasonable.In section 3 we consider the step of running Wilson coefficients from the matching scale Λ to the electroweak scale m W where measurements are made.

        <p>A common theme in the literature on the SM EFT is the choice of an operator basis. We will discuss this in detail in section 3, but we would like to comment here on relevance of choosing an operator basis to the steps of matching and running. One does not need to choose an operator basis at the stage of matching a UV model onto the effective theory. The effective action obtained by integrating out some massive modes will simply produce a set of higher-dimension operators. One can then decide to continue to work with this UV generated operator set as it is, or to switch to a different set due to some other considerations. An operator basis needs to be picked once one RG evolves the Wilson coefficients using the anomalous dimension matrix γ ij , as the anomalous dimension matrix is obviously basis dependent. When RG running is relevant, it is crucial that the operator basis be complete or overcomplete [26].A common theme in the literature on the SM EFT is the choice of an operator basis.

        <p>In section 4 we consider the mapping step, i.e. obtaining Higgs and EW precision observables as functions of the Wilson coefficients at the weak scale, c i (m W ). While there JHEP01(2016)023 have been a variety of studies concerning the mapping of operators onto weak-scale observables in the literature [18,28,30,31,[36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52][53], to the best of our knowledge, a complete and systematic list does not exist yet. In this paper, we study a complete set of the Higgs and EW precision observables that present and possible near future experiments can have a decent 1% or better sensitivity on. These include the seven Electroweak precision observables (EWPO) S, T, U, W, Y, X, V up to p 4 order in the vacuum polarization functions, the three independent triple gauge couplings (TGC), the deviation in Higgs decay widths {Γ h→f f , Γ h→gg , Γ h→γγ , Γ h→γZ , Γ h→W W * , Γ h→ZZ * }, and the deviation in Higgs production cross sections at both lepton and hadron colliders {σ ggF , σ W W h , σ W h , σ Zh }. We write these precision observables up to linear power and tree-level order in the Wilson coefficients c i (m W ) of a complete set of dimension-six CP-conserving bosonic operators 7shown in table 2. Quite a bit calculation steps are also listed in appendix C. These include a list of two-point and three-point Feynman rules (appendix C.1) from operators in table 2, interference corrections to Higgs decay widths (appendix C.2) and production cross sections (appendix C.3), and general analysis on residue modifications (appendix C.4) and Lagrangian parameter modifications (appendix C.5). With a primary interest in new physics that only couples with bosons in the SM, we have taken the Wilson coefficients of all the fermionic operators to be zero while calculating the mapping results. However, the general analysis we present for calculating the Higgs decay widths and production cross sections completely applies to fermionic operators.In section 4 we consider the mapping step, i.e. obtaining Higgs and EW precision observables as functions of the Wilson coefficients at the weak scale, c i (m W ).

These include a list of two-point and three-point Feynman rules (appendix C.1) from operators in table 2, interference corrections to Higgs decay widths (appendix C.2) and production cross sections (appendix C.3), and general analysis on residue modifications (appendix C.4) and Lagrangian parameter modifications (appendix C.5). With a primary interest in new physics that only couples with bosons in the SM, we have taken the Wilson coefficients of all the fermionic operators to be zero while calculating the mapping results. However, the general analysis we present for calculating the Higgs decay widths and production cross sections completely applies to fermionic operators.</p>
        <p>In this paper, we advocate the use of the Standard Model EFT from a UV perspective. Let's recapitulate this program. First, match a given UV theory onto the EFT: integrate out heavy physics from the UV model to obtain the Wilson coefficients of the higher dimension operators in the EFT. Second, run the Wilson coefficients down to weak scale using their RG equations. Third, use the EFT at the weak scale to calculate the contribution of new physics, in the form of non-zero Wilson coefficients, to physical observables. In this section, we present tools that considerably ease the step of matching the UV model onto the EFT. We take up the task of running and mapping in later sections.In this paper, we advocate the use of the Standard Model EFT from a UV perspective. Let's recapitulate this program.

        <p>The process of matching the UV theory onto the EFT is done order-by-order in perturbation theory. As present and future tests of the Standard Model Higgs and gauge sector are typically only sensitive to one-loop order effects, for most purposes it is sufficient to do this matching only up to one-loop order. In this case, the contribution of the UV physics to the low-energy effective action consists of a tree level piece and a one-loop piece.The process of matching the UV theory onto the EFT is done order-by-order in perturbation theory.

        <p>Besides providing an easier computational framework, the CDE illuminates a certain universality in computing Wilson coefficients from different UV theories. This occurs because individual terms in the expansion split into a trace over internal indices (gauge, flavor, etc.) involving covariant derivatives times low energy fields -these are the operators in the EFT -times a simple momentum integral whose value corresponds to the Wilson coefficient of the operator. The UV physics is contained in the specific form of the covariant derivatives and low energy fields, but the momentum integral is independent of these details and therefore can be considered universal.Besides providing an easier computational framework, the CDE illuminates a certain universality in computing Wilson coefficients from different UV theories.

        <p>So far our discussion has been centered around the idea of integrating out some heavy mode to get an effective action, to which we claim the CDE is a useful tool. More precisely, the CDE is a technique for evaluating functional determinants of a generalized Laplacian operator, det[D 2 + U (x)], where D is some covariant derivative. Therefore the technique is not limited to gauge theories; in fact, the CDE was originally introduced in [20] primarily as a means for computing the one-loop effective action of non-linear sigma models. In these applications, the use of the CDE keeps the geometric structure of the target manifold and its invariance to field redefinitions manifest [20]. Moreover, functional determinants are prolific in the computation of the (1PI or Wilsonian) effective action to one-loop order. Therefore, the use of the CDE extends far beyond integrating out some heavy field and can be used as a tool to, for example, renormalize a (effective) field theory or compute thermal effects.So far our discussion has been centered around the idea of integrating out some heavy mode to get an effective action, to which we claim the CDE is a useful tool.

        <p>The 1980s saw considerable effort in developing methods to compute the effective action with arbitrary background fields. While we cannot expect to do justice to this literature, let us provide a brief outline of some relevant works. The CDE developed in [20,21] built upon the derivative expansion technique of [55,56]. A few techniques for covariant calculation of the one-loop effective action were developed somewhat earlier in [57]. While these techniques do afford considerable simplification over traditional methods, they are less systematic and more cumbersome than the CDE presented here [20]. In using a heat kernel to evaluate the effective action, a covariant derivative expansion has also been developed, see, e.g., [58]. This method utilizes a position space representation and is significantly more involved than the approach presented here, where we work in Fourier space.The 1980s saw considerable effort in developing methods to compute the effective action with arbitrary background fields.

        <p>An outline for this section is as follows. In section 2.1 we consider the tree and one-loop contributions to the effective action in turn and show how to evaluate each using a covariant derivative expansion. The tree-level result is very simple, as well as useful, and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been appeared in the literature before. In section 2.2 we examine evaluation of the functional trace at the more abstract matrix level, thereby clarifying a few steps in the derivation of the CDE. These results are somewhat tangential towards our JHEP01(2016)023 main focus and can be safely omitted in a first reading. The explicit extension to fermions and gauge bosons is provided in section 2.3 together with summary formulas of the CDE for different spin particles. In section 2.4 we demonstrate how to explicitly evaluate terms in the CDE. Following this, universal formulas for terms in the expansion are presented. As a first example using these results, we derive the β function for non-abelian gauge theory and present the Wilson coefficients for the purely gluonic dimension six operators for massive spin 0, 1/2, and 1 particles transforming under some representation of the gauge group. The universal formulas can also immediately be used to obtain the one-loop effective action for a wide variety of theories, as we show in section 2.5 with a variety of explicit examples. The examples considered are non-trivial demonstrations of the power of the CDE; moreover, they are models that may be relevant to Higgs and other BSM physics: they are related to supersymmetry, extended Higgs sectors, Higgs portal operators, little Higgs theories, extra-dimensional theories, and kinetic mixing of gauge bosons.An outline for this section is as follows.

        <p>Power counting. Power counting is very transparent in the expansion in eq. (2.20). This makes it simple to identify the dimension of the operators in the resultant EFT and to truncate the expansion at the desired order. For example, the lowest dimension operator in G µν is the field strength [D µ , D ν ] = -iG µν ; each successive term in G increases the EFT operator dimension by one through an additional P α . The dimension increase from additional P 's is compensated by additional q derivatives which, by acting on ∆, increase the numbers of propagators.Power counting.

        <p>When there is a non-zero tree-level contribution, Φ c = 0, the dependence of the oneloop functional determinant on the classical configuration can introduce divergences into the Wilson coefficients of operators with dimension greater than four. These terms generically are associated with renormalization of parameters in the UV Lagrangian (see the discussion at the beginning of section 2.1, around figure 2). Therefore, the effects of the contributions can be absorbed into a redefinition (renormalization scheme dependence) of the UV Lagrangian parameters, and hence dropped from the matching analysis. Another natural scheme choice is to use MS. In MS scheme, from eq. (2.54), there is a finite contribution to higher dimension operators from the tr U piece. To show where this difference arises in doing calculations, in our examples of the triplet scalar and doublet scalar we will use the MS renormalization scheme, while for all the other examples we will absorb the divergences of HDOs into the UV Lagrangian parameters.

        <p>Although the running of Wilson coefficients is a conceptually important step, there turn out to be strong requirements on the class of UV models for it to be of practical relevance. Near future measurements have an estimated sensitivity at the per mille level: from v 2 /Λ 2 ∼ 0.1%, we see that Λ can be probed at most up to a few TeV. So the logarithm is not large, log(Λ/m W ) ∼ 3, and therefore loop order counting in perturbative expansions is reasonable.Although the running of Wilson coefficients is a conceptually important step, there turn out to be strong requirements on the class of UV models for it to be of practical relevance.

In particular, if c j (Λ) is generated at one-loop level, then its contribution to c i (m W ) from RG running is of two loop size and hence negligible. Additionally, even in the case that c j (Λ) is generated at tree level, its contribution to c i (m W ) is subdominant if c i (Λ) is also generated at tree level.

        <p>There are many dimension-six operators that respect the SM gauge invariance. However, some of these operators are redundant in the sense that they lead to the same physical effects.

An operator set is said to be complete if it can capture all possible physical effects stemming from the higher dimension operators.

        <p>Sometimes it is helpful to use a redundant operator set because it can make the physics more transparent. For example, the matching from a UV model may generate an overcomplete set of effective operators. An obvious drawback of working with an overcomplete set of operators is that the size of γ ij would be larger than necessary, and that the value of γ ij would not be unique [26]. However, this does not necessarily mean that γ ij is harder to calculate. For example, consider the extreme case of using all the dim-6 operators, before using equations of motion to remove any redundant combination. This is a super overcomplete set, and as a result the size of γ ij would be way larger than that in the standard basis. But with this choice of operator set, all the contributions to γ ij are direct contributions by definition. Some of these direct contributions would become indirect in a smaller operator set, and one has to accommodate them by using equations of motion or operator identities, which is a further step of calculation. Therefore, in some cases, it is the reduction from an overcomplete set to an exact complete set that requires more work. Note that the ambiguity in the explicit form of γ ij from using an overcomplete basis does not cause any problem when computing physical effects.

        <p>With a motivation of completeness, one starts with enumerating all the possible dim-6 operators that respect the Standard Model gauge symmetry. Some combinations of these operators are zero due to simple operator identities. 43 One can use these redundances to remove operators and shrink the operator set. In addition, many other combinations are zero upon using equation of motions, and hence would not contribute to physical observables which are on-shell quantities. These combinations can also be removed because they are redundant in respect of describing physics. 44 After all of these reductions, one arrives at an operator set that is non-redundant but still complete, in a sense that it has the full capability of describing the physical effects of any dim-6 operators. Clearly, the non-redundant, complete set of operators forms an "operator basis". There are, of course, multiple choices of operator bases, all related by usual basis transformations.With a motivation of completeness, one starts with enumerating all the possible dim-6 operators that respect the Standard Model gauge symmetry.

        <p>The second type of motivation in choosing an operator set is the relevance to phenomenology. With this kind of motivation, one usually starts with a quite small set of operators that are immediately relevant to the physics concerned. However, if RG running effects are important, a complete operator set is required for the analysis. As discussed in the previous subsection, one can then extend the initial operator set into a complete operator basis by adding enough non-redundant operators to it. Popular operator bases constructed along this line include the "EGGM basis" [31], the "HISZ basis" [76], and the "SILH basis" [30,44,77].

        <p>effective field theory. As with any EFT, there is a practical three-step procedure that one makes use of: matching the UV theory onto the EFT at the scale where heavy states are integrated out, RG evolving the EFT down to the scale where measurements are made, and mapping the EFT onto observables at the measurement scale. While each of these steps is straightforward in the abstract, in practice they can be complicated for the SM EFT primarily due to the large number of higher dimension operators in the SM EFT.effective field theory.

        <p>In section 2 we developed the covariant derivative expansion, which allows one to compute the tree and one-loop effective action at the matching scale in a manifestly gauge covariant fashion.

        <p>where G νµ and U , eq. (2.14), are expansions containing HDOs through commutators of the covariant derivative P µ with itself and the low-energy (SM) fields in U (x), together with derivatives of the auxiliary momentum q µ . The general form of U (x) for scalars, fermions, and vector bosons is summarized in section 2.3. The above effective action is then evaluated in an inverse mass expansion, leading to universal formulas for the one-loop effective action. In the case that m 2 commutes with U (x), we explicitly performed this covariant derivative expansion and the general results up through dimension-six operators is given in eq. (2.54). With these results, in section 2.5 we computed the Wilson coefficients of dimension-six operators for numerous physically interesting and non-trivial models of new physics. Besides the inherent physical interest of the UV models considered, these examples hopefully offer a pedagogical explanation of how the CDE can be used to easily obtain the effective action at the matching scale.where G νµ and U , eq.

        <p>In section 3 we considered the step of RG running Wilson coefficients at the matching scale down to the observation scale. At leading order, this involves making use of the anomalous dimension matrix γ ij . In the past few years, there has been great progress on computing γ ij . Instead of examining the technical details of this calculation, we explored the questions of when are these results needed and how to make use of them. Due to the per-mille sensitivity of present and future precision measurements, as a general rule of thumb RG running needs to be considered only when Wilson coefficients are generated at tree-level. If one does need to make use of RG evolution, the most practical ingredient one needs to understand to make use of existing computations of γ ij concerns RG closure and choice of an operator basis. We provided a brief explanation of the choice of operator sets as well as common operator bases in the literature and how one can go between these bases.In section 3 we considered the step of RG running Wilson coefficients at the matching scale down to the observation scale.

        <p>Finally, in section 4 we studied how higher dimension operators impact precision observables. In particular, we computed the impact of all purely bosonic dimension-six operators (table 5) on electroweak precision observables, Higgs' decay widths, and Higgs production cross sections. This calculation was done to leading (linear) order in the Wilson coefficients. While various parts of these results have been computed in the literature JHEP01(2016)023 previously, we believe our results offer the first complete and systematic results for the bosonic operators we considered.Finally, in section 4 we studied how higher dimension operators impact precision observables.

        <p>Besides being the appropriate, model-independent framework to study precision observables, effective field theory provides great simplification to studying how specific new models of physics impact precision observables. We have outlined in detail the algorithmic procedure for doing this with the SM EFT. Given a UV model, one can easily match it onto the SM EFT using the covariant derivative expansion. One then decides if RG running down to the weak scale is of practical relevance; if it is, existing computations of the anomalous dimension matrix can be employed to do this step. At the weak scale, one then simply takes the Wilson coefficients of the bosonic operators and plugs them into tables 7-12 to study the deviations the UV model induces on electroweak and Higgs observables. We hope that the tools and results developed in this work not only highlight the utility of the SM EFT, but also demonstrate how one can use the SM EFT with relative ease.Besides being the appropriate, model-independent framework to study precision observables, effective field theory provides great simplification to studying how specific new models of physics impact precision observables.

        <p>In evaluating the 1PI effective action, we split the gauge boson into a background piece plus fluctuations around this background, A µ = A B,µ + Q µ , and perform the path integral over the fluctuations Q µ while holding the background A B,µ fixed. In order to do the path integral, one must gauge fix the Q µ fields. At first glance, one might think that gauge fixing destroys the possibility of keeping gauge invariance manifest while evaluating the one-loop effective action. However, this turns out not to be the case. It is well known that there is a convenient gauge fixing condition that leaves the gauge symmetry of the background A B,µ field manifest, i.e. it only gauge fixes Q µ and not A B,µ . This technique is known as the background field method (for example, see [91] and references therein). 53 Because the gauge symmetry of the background A B,µ field is not fixed, we will still be able to employ the techniques of the covariant derivative expansion, allowing a manifestly gauge invariant computation of the one-loop effective action.In evaluating the 1PI effective action, we split the gauge boson into a background piece plus fluctuations around this background, A µ = A B,µ + Q µ , and perform the path integral over the fluctuations Q µ while holding the background A B,µ fixed.

        <p>The issues around gauge symmetry are actually quite distinct for the background field method versus the CDE. However, because similar words are used in both discussions, it is worth clarifying what aspects of gauge symmetry are handled in each case. The background field method makes it manifestly clear that the effective action of A B,µ possesses a gauge symmetry by only gauge fixing the fluctuating field Q µ . This is an all orders statement. However, when evaluating the effective action order-by-order, one still works with the non-covariant quantities A B,µ , Q µ , and ∂/∂x µ at intermediate steps. 54 The covariant derivative expansion, on the other hand, is a technique for evaluating the one-loop effective action that keeps gauge invariance manifest at all stages of the computation by working with gauge covariant quantities such as D µ . To understand this point more explicitly, one can compare the method of the CDE presented in this paper and in [21] with the evaluation of the functional determinant using the component fields as presented in detail in Peskin and Schroeder [92].
