        <p>Elastic scattering of protons is a process mediated by the strong and the electromagnetic interactions -the weak interaction is commonly neglected since its carriers are heavy compared to the small momentum transfers, |t|, typical of elastic scattering. In this context, the strong interaction is traditionally called 'nuclear' or 'hadronic' and the electromagnetic one 'Coulomb'. In quantum-theory description, each of these interactions is described by a scattering amplitude, nuclear A N (t) and Coulomb A C (t). Moreover, the combined scattering amplitude receives a third contribution reflecting Feynman diagrams with both strong and electromagnetic exchanges. This term, together with the complex character of the scattering amplitudes, describes the effects of Coulomb-nuclear interference (CNI) in the differential cross-section. Since the Coulomb amplitude is known, measuring the CNI gives access to the phase of the nuclear amplitude, which is necessary for a complete understanding of the interaction but not directly observable in the pure hadronic differential cross-section. The CNI effect is most pronounced in the t-region where the two amplitudes have similar magnitudes, i.e. -for typical LHC centre-of-mass energies of a few TeV -near |t| ∼ 5 × 10 -4 GeV 2 . Thus the experimental sensitivity to the nuclear phase, arg A N (t), is limited to a region at very small |t|, making difficult any conclusions on the functional form of the phase.Elastic scattering of protons is a process mediated by the strong and the electromagnetic interactions -the weak interaction is commonly neglected since its carriers are heavy compared to the small momentum transfers, |t|, typical of elastic scattering.

        <p>The present article discusses the first measurement of elastic scattering in the CNI region at the CERN LHC by the TOTEM experiment. The data have been collected at √ s = 8 TeV with a special beam optics (β * = 1000 m) and cover a |t|-interval from 6×10 -4 GeV 2 to 0.2 GeV 2 , extending well into the interference region. In order to strengthen the statistical power and thus enable a cleaner identification of the interference effects, the analysis also exploits another, complementary data set with higher statistics [14], taken at the same energy, but with different beam optics (β * = 90 m), and thus covering a different |t|-range: 0.027 &lt; |t| &lt; 0.2 GeV 2 . The isolated analysis of the latter data set has excluded a purely exponential behaviour of the observed elastic cross-section with more than 7 σ confidence. The new data in the CNI region allow to study the source of the nonexponentiality: nuclear component, CNI effects or both. In order to explore the full spectrum of possibilities, an interference formula without the limitations of SWY is needed. In the present study the more general and complex interference formulae of Cahn [15] and Kundrát-Lokajíček (KL) [16] are used, offering much more freedom for the choice of the theoretically unknown functional forms of the hadronic modulus and phase. Since the data cannot unambiguously determine all functional forms and their parameters, the results of this study, still representatively expressed in terms of ρ, become conditional to the choice of the model describing the hadronic amplitude. This choice has implications on the behaviour of the interaction in impact parameter space. In particular, the functional form of the hadronic phase at small |t| determines whether elastic collisions occur predominantly at small or large impact parameters (centrality vs. peripherality). It will be shown that both options are compatible with the data, thus the central picture still prevalent in theoretical models is not a necessity. Section 2 of this article outlines the experimental setup used for the measurement. The properties of the special beam optics are described in Section 3. Section 4 gives details of the data-taking conditions. The data analysis and reconstruction of the differential cross-section are described in Section 5. Section 6 presents the study of the Coulombnuclear interference together with the functional form of the hadronic amplitude. The values of ρ and σ tot are determined.

        <p>The TOTEM experiment, located at the LHC Interaction Point (IP) 5 together with the CMS experiment, is dedicated to the measurement of the total cross-section, elastic scattering and diffractive processes. The experimental apparatus, symmetric with respect to the IP, is composed of a forward proton spectrometer (Roman Pots, RPs) and the forward tracking telescopes T1 and T2. A complete description of the TOTEM detector instrumentation and its performance is given in [17] and [18]. The data analysed here come from the RPs only. An RP is a movable beam-pipe insertion capable of approaching the LHC beam to a distance of less than a millimetre, in order to detect protons with scattering angles of only a few microradians. The proton spectrometer is organised in two RP stations: one on the left side of the IP (LHC sector 45) and one on the right (LHC sector 56), see Figure 1 (left). Each RP station, located between 215 and 220 m from the IP, is composed of two units: "near" (215 m from the IP) and "far" (220 m). A unit consists of 3 RPs, one approaching the outgoing beam from the top, one from the bottom, and one horizontally. Each RP houses a stack of 5 "U" and 5 "V" silicon strip detectors, where "U" and "V" refer to two mutually perpendicular strip orientations. The sensors were designed with the specific objective of reducing the insensitive area at the edge facing the beam to only a few tens of micrometers. Due to the 5 m long lever arm between the near and the far RP units the local track angles can be reconstructed with a precision of about 10 µrad. A high trigger efficiency (&gt; 99%) is achieved by using all RPs independently. Since elastic scattering events consist of two collinear protons emitted in opposite directions, the detected events can have two topologies, called diagonals: 45 bottom -56 top and 45 top -56 bottom. This article uses a reference frame where x denotes the horizontal axis (pointing out of the LHC ring), y the vertical axis (pointing against gravity) and z the beam axis (in the clockwise direction).The TOTEM experiment, located at the LHC Interaction Point (IP) 5 together with the CMS experiment, is dedicated to the measurement of the total cross-section, elastic scattering and diffractive processes.

The effective length L x,y (z), magnification v x,y (z) and dispersion D x,y (z) quantify the sensitivity of the measured proton position to the scattering angle, vertex position and momentum loss, respectively. Note that for elastic collisions the dispersion terms D ξ can be ignored because the protons do not lose any momentum. The values of ξ only account for the initial state momentum offset and variations, see Section 4 in [14]. Due to the collinearity of the two elastically scattered protons and the symmetry of the optics, the impact of D ξ on the reconstructed scattering angles is negligible compared to other uncertainties.

        <p>The vertical RPs approached the beam centre to only 3 times the beam width, σ y , resulting in an acceptance for |t|values down to 6 × 10 -4 GeV 2 . The exceptionally close distance was possible due to the low beam intensity in this special beam operation: each beam contained only two colliding bunches and one non-colliding bunch for background monitoring, each with 10 11 protons. A novel collimation strategy was applied to keep the beam halo background under control. As a first step, the primary collimators (TCP) in the LHC betatron cleaning insertion (point 7) scraped the beam down to 2 σ y ; then the collimators were retracted to 2.5 σ y , thus creating a 0.5 σ y gap between the beam edge and the collimator jaws. With the halo strongly suppressed and no collimator producing showers by touching the beam, the RPs at 3 σ y were operated in a background-depleted environment for about one hour until the beam-to-collimator gap was refilled by diffusion, as diagnosed by the increasing RP trigger rate (Figure 2). When the background conditions had deteriorated to an unacceptable level, the beam cleaning procedure was repeated, again followed by a quiet data-taking period. The beam cleaning at 1.5 h from the beginning of the run employed only vertical collimators and led to a quickly increasing background rate, see Figure 2. Therefore, the following beam cleaning operations were also performed in the horizontal plane. Altogether there were 6 beam cleaning interventions until the luminosity had decreased from initially 1.8×10 27 cm -2 s -1 to 0.4×10 27 cm -2 s -1 at which point the data yield was considered as too low. During the 9 hour long fill, an integrated luminosity of 20 µb -1 was accumulated in 6 data sets corresponding to the calm periods between the cleaning operations.The vertical RPs approached the beam centre to only 3 times the beam width, σ y , resulting in an acceptance for |t|values down to 6 × 10 -4 GeV 2 .

        <p>Since the overall normalisation will be determined from another dataset (see Section 5.2.6), any inefficiency correction that does not alter the t-distribution shape does not need to be considered in this analysis (trigger, data acquisition and pile-up inefficiency discussed in [20,22]). The remaining inefficiencies are related to the inability of a RP to resolve the elastic proton track. One such case is when a single RP does not detect and/or reconstruct a proton track, with no correlation to other RPs. This type of inefficiency, I 3/4 , is evaluated by removing the RP from the tagging cuts (Table 2), repeating the event selection and calculating the fraction of recovered events. A typical example is given in Figure 10, showing that the efficiency decreases gently with the vertical scattering angle. This dependence originates from the fact that protons with larger |θ * y | hit the RPs further from their edge and therefore the potentially created secondary particles have more chance to induce additional signal. Since the RP detectors cannot resolve multiple tracks (non-unique association between "U" and "V" track candidates), a secondary particle track prevents from using the affected RP in the analysis.Since the overall normalisation will be determined from another dataset (see Section 5.2.6), any inefficiency correction that does not alter the t-distribution shape does not need to be considered in this analysis (trigger, data acquisition and pile-up inefficiency discussed in [20,22]).

First, in order to avoid integrating over off-mass-shell contributions to the nuclear amplitude (essentially unknown), a very slow variation of the nuclear amplitude phase was assumed: arg A N ≈ const.

        <p>The goal of this section is to test whether the data are compatible with a purely exponential nuclear modulus, i.e. N b = 1 in Eq. (17). In other words, the non-exponentiality is forced to originate from the Coulomb-induced effects. The fit results obtained with the KL and (where applicable) SWY formulae are summarised in Table 4 and graphically shown in Fig. 16. Table 4 shows that both fits with constant phase are essentially identical and have bad quality. The step-2 fit using both β * = 1000 m and 90 m data can be excluded with 7.6 σ significance. Consequently, since the combination of N b = 1 and constant phase is the only one compatible with the SWY approach, that formula is experimentally excluded even on the basis of only the low-|t| data set discussed here. This result is complementary to the observation of a diffractive minimum at √ s = 8 TeV (to be published in a forthcoming article) which also contradicts the assumptions of the SWY formula.The goal of this section is to test whether the data are compatible with a purely exponential nuclear modulus, i.e. N b = 1 in Eq.

        <p>The aim of this section is to discuss fits with enough flexibility in the nuclear modulus to describe the non-exponentiality in the data. Since a non-exponential hadronic modulus is used, the only applicable interference formula is KL. N b = 2 to 5 were considered. The optimal degree was chosen according to two criteria: reasonable χ 2 /ndf and stability of fit parameters (among which ρ is one of the most sensitive). For instance, with constant phase the fit (step 1) with N b = 2 yields χ 2 /ndf = 1.07 and ρ = 0.10 while the one with N b = 3 gives χ 2 /ndf = 1.03 and ρ = 0.12. Both fits have the normalised χ 2 reasonably close to 1, but the value of ρ changes significantly between N b = 2 and 3 which is unexpected should N b = 2 be sufficient. On the other hand N b = 4 gives χ 2 /ndf = 0.861 which is unreasonably low. Therefore N b = 3 was chosen.The aim of this section is to discuss fits with enough flexibility in the nuclear modulus to describe the non-exponentiality in the data.

        <p>As shown in Table 5, both fits have reasonable fit quality and remarkably consistent values of ρ (identical within the resolution) which are compared to previous determinations at lower energies in Fig. 18.

        <p>Fig. 17 shows that the level of Coulomb-induced effects is very different in the fits. It is much stronger in the case of the peripheral-phase, which can be expected as this phase features a faster variation in the low-|t| region.Fig. 17 shows that the level of Coulomb-induced effects is very different in the fits.

        <p>The total cross-section results from the two fits in Table 5 are well consistent with each other and also with previous measurements [14,22]. The slightly higher values with respect to previous analyses neglecting the Coulomb interaction are expected as long as ρ &gt; 0.

These two alternatives allowed to test whether the nuclear modulus can be purely exponential or more flexibility is required. For the phase two options were considered, leading to different impact-parameter distributions of elastic scattering events: a constant phase implying a central behaviour, and another description favouring peripheral collisions.

        <p>The new total cross-section determination is conceptually more accurate than in all previous LHC publications since the CNI effects are explicitly treated. Moreover, the value of ρ comes from the same analysis, not from an external source, which underlines consistency. The σ tot values are very well consistent among all non-excluded fits and compatible with the previous measurements. As expected, the new determination yields slightly greater values relative to previous results where the negative CNI was not taken into account. Also note that if the SWY formula with purely exponential hadronic modulus is used, the total cross-section is underestimated by about 1 mb. A similar underestimation may occur if the non-exponentiality is not taken into account [47].The new total cross-section determination is conceptually more accurate than in all previous LHC publications since the CNI effects are explicitly treated.

        <p>For even stronger results in the future the key point is a better distinction between the nuclear and CNI cross-section components, which can be achieved from both theoretical and experimental sides. New theory developments may narrow down the range of allowed parametrisations of the nuclear modulus and phase or better constrain the induced CNI effects. The experimental improvements include increasing statistics and reducing the lower |t| threshold. For the former, TOTEM has already upgraded the RP mechanics such that both vertical pots can be simultaneously placed very close to the beam. For the latter, TOTEM foresees an optics with extremely high β * ≈ 2500 m which would allow to reach the CNI region even at Run II energies. Moreover, recent experience with the β * = 90 m optics at √ s = 13 TeV shows that very low beam emittances can be achieved, thus possibly further reducing the RP distance from the beam.For even stronger results in the future the key point is a better distinction between the nuclear and CNI cross-section components, which can be achieved from both theoretical and experimental sides.
