        <p>The reconstruction of the signal from hadrons and jets emerging from the proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and entering the ATLAS calorimeters is based on a three-dimensional topological clustering of individual calorimeter cell signals. The cluster formation follows cell signal-significance patterns generated by electromagnetic and hadronic showers. In this, the clustering algorithm implicitly performs a topological noise suppression by removing cells with insignificant signals which are not in close proximity to cells with significant signals. The resulting topological cell clusters have shape and location information, which is exploited to apply a local energy calibration and corrections depending on the nature of the cluster. Topological cell clustering is established as a wellperforming calorimeter signal definition for jet and missing transverse momentum reconstruction in ATLAS.The reconstruction of the signal from hadrons and jets emerging from the proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and entering the ATLAS calorimeters is based on a three-dimensional topological clustering of individual calorimeter cell signals.

        <p>The detectable final state emerging from the proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) consists of particles and jets which are reconstructed with high precision for physics analyses. In the ATLAS experiment [1], clusters of topologically connected calorimeter cell signals (topo-clusters) are employed as a principal signal definition for use in the reconstruction of the (hadronic) part of the final state comprising isolated hadrons, jets and hadronically decaying τ -leptons. In addition, topo-clusters are also used to represent the energy flow from softer particles, which is needed for the reconstruction of fullevent observables such as the missing transverse momentum.The detectable final state emerging from the proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) consists of particles and jets which are reconstructed with high precision for physics analyses.

        <p>The algorithm building the topo-clusters explores the spatial distribution of the cell signals in all three dimensions to establish connections between neighbours in an attempt to reconstruct the energy and directions of the incoming particles. The signals from cells determined to be connected are summed, and are used together with the cell locations to calculate direction, location, and shapes of the resulting clusters. Calorimeter cells with insignificant signals found to not be connected to neighbouring cells with significant signals are considered noise and discarded from further jet, particle and missing transverse momentum reconstruction.The algorithm building the topo-clusters explores the spatial distribution of the cell signals in all three dimensions to establish connections between neighbours in an attempt to reconstruct the energy and directions of the incoming particles.

        <p>The topo-clusters, while well established in deep inelastic scattering experiments such as H1 [2] at HERA and in electron-positron collider experiments such as ALEPH [3] at LEP and BaBar [4] at PEP-II, are used here in an innovative implementation as fully calibrated three-dimensional objects representing the calorimeter signals in the complex final-state environment of hadron-hadron collisions. A similar application in this particular environment, previously developed by the D0 Collaboration, implements the topological clustering in the two dimensions spanned by pseudorapidity and the azimuthal angle, thus applying the noise-suppression strat-egy inherent in this algorithm for jet reconstruction [5]. Several features and aspects of the ATLAS topo-cluster algorithms and their validations have previously been presented in Refs. [6][7][8][9]. Some of the complexity of the final state in hadron-hadron collisions is introduced by particles from the underlying event generated by radiation and multiple parton interactions in the two colliding hadrons producing the hard-scatter final state. Other detector signal contributions from the collision environment, especially important for higher intensity operations at the LHC, arise from pile-up generated by diffuse particle emissions produced by the additional proton-proton collisions occurring in the same bunch crossing as the hardscatter interaction (in-time pile-up).

        <p>The ATLAS calorimeters have a highly granular lateral and longitudinal segmentation. Including the pre-samplers, there are seven sampling layers in the combined central calorimeters (PreSamplerB, three in EMB and three in Tile) and eight sampling layers in the end-cap region (PreSamplerE, three in EMEC and four in HEC). The three FCal modules provide three sampling layers in the forward region. Altogether, the calorimeter system has about 188 000 read-out channels. The EM calorimeters are between 24 radiation lengths (X 0 ) and 27 X 0 deep. The combined depth of the calorimeters for hadronic energy measurements is more than 10 hadronic interaction lengths (λ) nearly everywhere across the full detector acceptance (|η| ≤ 4.9). The amount of inactive material in front of the calorimeters depends on η. It varies from about 2 X 0 at η = 0 to about 4 X 0 at |η| ≈ 1.8, when measured from the nominal interaction point in ATLAS to the first active sampling layer (including PreSamplerB and PreSamplerE). It can increase to more than 6 X 0 in the transition region between central and end-cap calorimeters (|η| ≈ 1.45 and |η| ≈ 1.7). The amount of inactive material for hadrons is approximately 1 λ across the full covered η-range, with spikes going up to more than 2 λ in transition regions and in regions with complex cryostat structures and beam line services (|η| ≈ 4).The ATLAS calorimeters have a highly granular lateral and longitudinal segmentation.

Depending on the run period, it required one hit in either of the η hemispheres, or one hit in each η hemisphere. In 2012, the MB samples were triggered by a zero-bias trigger. This trigger unconditionally accepted events from bunch crossings occurring a fixed number of LHC cycles after a high-energy electron or photon was accepted by the L1 trigger. The L1 trigger rate for these hard objects scales linearly with luminosity, thus the collision environment generated by the luminosity-dependent additional proton-proton interactions discussed in Sect. 2.2.1 is well reflected in the MB samples.The ATLAS MB trigger [11] used signals from a dedicated system of scintillators (MBTS [12]; 2.1 &lt; |η| &lt; 3.8) at L1 in 2010 and 2011 data-taking.

        <p>For triggering on collision events with jets at L1, jets are first built from coarse-granularity calorimeter towers using a sliding-window algorithm (L1-jets). The events are accepted if they have L1-jets passing triggers based on (1) the transverse momentum ( p T ) of individual L1jets (single-jet triggers) or on (2) the detection of several such jets at increasing transverse momenta (multi-jet triggers). Those events accepted by L1 are then subjected to refined jet-trigger decisions based on jet p T and multijet topology in the HLT, now using jets that are reconstructed from calorimeter cell signals with algorithms similar to the ones applied in the offline precision reconstruction [13].For triggering on collision events with jets at L1, jets are first built from coarse-granularity calorimeter towers using a sliding-window algorithm (L1-jets).

        <p>In the initial phase of data-taking in 2010 the proton beam intensities at LHC were relatively low. The recorded events contain on average three additional proton-proton interactions, as shown in Fig. 2b. In addition, the initial bunch crossing interval of t BX = 750 ns was larger than the window of sensitivity of the LAr calorimeter, which is defined by the duration τ signal of the shaped signal, with τ signal ≈ 600 ns, as depicted in Fig. 3 for the typical charge collection time of t d = 450 ns in this detector. In later data-taking periods in 2010 the bunch crossing interval was reduced to t BX = 175 ns, which is within the sensitivity of the LAr calorimeter signal formation (t BX &lt; τ signal ). Nevertheless, the still-low instantaneous luminosity reduced the amount of energy scattered into the calorimeter in the other bunch crossings to a negligible contribution with little effect on the signal history.In the initial phase of data-taking in 2010 the proton beam intensities at LHC were relatively low.

These two changes in the run conditions introduced a sensitivity of the LAr calorimeter signal to the signal residuals from proton-proton interactions occurring in N PU BX ≈ 12 preceding bunch crossings at the LHC (outof-time pile-up), in addition to pile-up interactions in the current bunch crossing (in-time pile-up). The out-of-time pile-up effect on the cell signal depends on N PU BX ≈ τ signal /t BX and the energy deposited in each of the N PU BX bunch crossings. The bipolar shape of the LAr calorimeter signal shown in Fig. 3 reduces the overall effect of pile-up, because it features a net-zero integral over time. This leads to cancellation on average of in-time pile-up signal contributions by out-oftime pile-up signal residuals in any given calorimeter cell. By design of the shaping amplifier, and the choice of digitally sampling the shaped pulse amplitude in time with a frequency of 40 MHz in the read-out, the most efficient suppression is achieved for 25 ns bunch spacing in the LHC beams. It is fully effective in the limit where for each bunch crossing contributing to out-of-time pile-up about the same amount of energy is deposited in a given calorimeter cell. A small loss of efficiency is observed for 50 ns bunch spacing, due to the less frequent injection of energy by the fewer previous bunch crossings.Online Luminosity (b) Mean number of additional proton-proton interactions per bunch crossing tions per bunch crossing shown in Fig. 2(b).

        <p>Approximately the first ten bunch crossings in each LHC bunch train at 50 ns bunch spacing are characterised by different out-of-time pile-up contributions from the collision history. This history gets filled with signal remnants from an increasing number of past bunch crossings with protonproton interactions the larger the time difference between the bunch crossing and the beginning of the train becomes. The remaining bunch crossings in a train, about 26 of a total of 36 in 2011 and 62 of a total of 72 in 2012, have an out-of-time pile-up signal contribution which is stable within the bunchto-bunch fluctuations in the beam intensity. In 2012 data a dedicated cell-by-cell correction is applied in the offline cell signal reconstruction to compensate for the corresponding variations in the out-of-time pile-up. Further details of the ATLAS liquid-argon calorimeter read-out and signal processing can be found in Ref. [15]. Even with a constant proton bunch intensity and apart from the bunch train effects, the efficiency of pile-up suppression by signal shaping is reduced by the large fluctuations in the number of additional interactions from bunch crossing to bunch crossing, and by the different energy-flow patterns of the individual collisions in the time window of sensitivity τ signal in the LAr calorimeters. Consequently, the signal shows a principal sensitivity to pile-up, even after shaping and digital filtering in the read-out. This is evident from the residual event-by-event deviation of the cell-signal baseline, which depends on the specific pile-up condition at the time of the triggered event, from the (average zero) baseline expected from the signal shaping. These baseline fluctuations can lead to relevant signal offsets once the noise suppression is applied, which is an important part of the calorimeter signal extraction strategy using topo-clusters presented in Sect. 3.Approximately the first ten bunch crossings in each LHC bunch train at 50 ns bunch spacing are characterised by different out-of-time pile-up contributions from the collision history.

        <p>The Tile calorimeter shows very little sensitivity to pileup since most of the associated (soft particle) energy flow is absorbed in the LAr calorimeters in front of it. Moreover, outof-time pile-up is suppressed by a shorter signal collection time and a short pulse shaping time, reducing the sensitivity of the signal to only about three bunch crossings at 50 ns intervals [12].The Tile calorimeter shows very little sensitivity to pileup since most of the associated (soft particle) energy flow is absorbed in the LAr calorimeters in front of it.

        <p>In ATLAS operations prior to 2011 the cell noise was dominated by electronic noise. The short bunch crossing interval and higher instantaneous luminosity in 2011 and 2012 LHC running added additional and dominant noise contributions from the cell-signal baseline fluctuations introduced by pile-up, as discussed in Sect. 2.2.1. These fluctuations, even though not perfectly following a Gaussian distribution,2 can nevertheless be expressed as noise measured by the standard deviation of their distribution, taken from simulated MB events and scaled to the expected number of pile-up interactions. The cell noise thresholds steering the topo-cluster formation described in Sect. 3 thus needed to be increased from those used in 2010 to accommodate this pile-up-induced noise. This is done by adjusting the nominal energy-equivalent noise σ noise according to (1) Here, σ electronic noise is the electronic noise, and σ pile-up noise the noise from pile-up, corresponding to an average of eight additional proton-proton interactions per bunch crossing (μ = 8) in 2011, and μ = 30 in 2012. These configurations are choices based on the expected average μ for the run year. They needed to be made before the respective data-taking started, to allow for a fast turn-around reconstruction of the collected data. As μ changes with the decrease of the instantaneous luminosity L inst through-out the LHC proton fill, σ pile-up noise is only optimal for the small subset of data recorded when L inst generated the nominal (a priori chosen) μ pile-up interactions on average. LHC operations at lower μ lead to slightly reduced calorimeter sensitivity to relevant small signals, as σ pile-up noise is too large. For data-taking periods with higher than nominal μ the noise suppression is not optimal, leading to more noise contributions to the topo-cluster signals.In ATLAS operations prior to 2011 the cell noise was dominated by electronic noise.

The value of μ is measured by the experiment as an average over one luminosity block, which can last as long as two minutes, with its actual duration depending on the central data acquisition configuration at the time of the data-taking. The measurement of μ is mainly based on single η-hemisphere hit counting as well as counting coincidental hits in both η-hemispheres with the fast ATLAS luminosity detectors consisting of two small Cherenkov counter (LUCID; 5.6 &lt; |η| &lt; 6.0) and two sets of small diamond sensors forming two beam conditions monitors (BCM; |η| = 4.2).

The jets are fully calibrated and corrected after formation, including a correction for pile-up signal contributions.

        <p>The collection of the calorimeter signals of a given collision event into clusters of topologically connected cell signals is an attempt to extract the significant signal from a background of electronic noise and other sources of fluctuations such as pile-up. This strategy is most effective in a highly granular calorimeter system such as the one employed by ATLAS. Finely segmented lateral read-out together with longitudinal sampling layers allows the resolution of energy-flow structures generating these spatial signal patterns, thus retaining only signals important for particle and jet reconstruction while efficiently removing insignificant signals induced by noise. The signal extraction is guided by reconstructing three-dimensional "energy blobs" from particle showers in the active calorimeter volume. Individual topo-clusters are not solely expected to contain the entire response to a single particle all of the time.

        <p>Topo-clusters with negative seeds often have a total energy E EM clus &lt; 0 as well, especially when |ς EM cell | P. This is due to the dominance of the negative seed and the correlation between this seed signal and signals in the neighbouring cells, which likely also have E EM cell &lt; 0. If a negative seed signal is generated by out-of-time pile-up, it is induced by a particle injected into the calorimeter more than 100 ns before the event. Its residual signal trace is scaled by the negative undershoot of the shaping function shown in Fig. 3. This particle also injected significant energy in the neighbouring cells at the same time, due to its electromagnetic or hadronic shower, which leads to E EM cell &lt; 0 in these cells at the time of the event. For the same reasons, topo-clusters from out-of-time pile-up seeded by E EM cell &gt; 0 often yield E EM clus &gt; 0, because they are typically generated by particles injected in past bunch crossings closer in time (within 100 ns). The topo-clusters with E EM clus &lt; 0 can be used to provide an average global cancellation of contributions of clusters seeded by positive fluctuations in out-of-time pile-up in full event observables including E miss T [44]. Clustering cells with E EM cell &lt; 0 in any topo-cluster, including those containing and seeded by large positive signals, improves noise suppression due to the local cancellation of random positive (upward) noise fluctuations by negative (downward) fluctuations within this cluster. Allowing only positive signals to contribute introduces a bias in the cluster signal, while the random cancellation partially suppresses this bias.Topo-clusters with negative seeds often have a total energy E EM clus &lt; 0 as well, especially when |ς EM cell | P. This is due to the dominance of the negative seed and the correlation between this seed signal and signals in the neighbouring cells, which likely also have E EM cell &lt; 0. If a negative seed signal is generated by out-of-time pile-up, it is induced by a particle injected into the calorimeter more than 100 ns before the event. Its residual signal trace is scaled by the negative undershoot of the shaping function shown in Fig. 3. This particle also injected significant energy in the neighbouring cells at the same time, due to its electromagnetic or hadronic shower, which leads to E EM cell &lt; 0 in these cells at the time of the event. For the same reasons, topo-clusters from out-of-time pile-up seeded by E EM cell &gt; 0 often yield E EM clus &gt; 0, because they are typically generated by particles injected in past bunch crossings closer in time (within 100 ns). The topo-clusters with E EM clus &lt; 0 can be used to provide an average global cancellation of contributions of clusters seeded by positive fluctuations in out-of-time pile-up in full event observables including E miss T [44]. Clustering cells with E EM cell &lt; 0 in any topo-cluster, including those containing and seeded by large positive signals, improves noise suppression due to the local cancellation of random positive (upward) noise fluctuations by negative (downward) fluctuations within this cluster.

        <p>To avoid biases in jet-finding and to support detailed jet substructure analysis as well as a high-quality E miss T reconstruction, proto-clusters with two or more local maxima are split between the corresponding signal peaks in all three spatial dimensions. A local signal maximum is defined by E EM cell &gt; 500 MeV, in addition to the topological requirements for this cell to have at least four neighbours and that none of the neighbours has a larger signal. Also, the location of cells providing local maxima is restricted to cells in the EM sampling layers EMB2, EMB3, EME2 and EME3, and to FCAL0. This means that for a proto-cluster located completely inside the electromagnetic calorimeters, or extending from the electromagnetic to the hadronic calorimeters, splitting is guided by the spatial cell signal distributions in the highly granular electromagnetic calorimeters. The cluster splitting is refined in an additional step, where signal maxima can be provided by cells from the thin EM sampling layers EMB1 and EME1 with a highly granular η-strip read-out geometry, all sampling layers in the hadronic calorimeters (HEC0 to HEC3, Tile0 to Tile2), and the hadronic forward calorimeter modules FCAL1 and FCAL2. 5 The use of EMB1 and EME1 in the topo-cluster splitting improves the photon separation in π 0 → γ γ .To avoid biases in jet-finding and to support detailed jet substructure analysis as well as a high-quality E miss T reconstruction, proto-clusters with two or more local maxima are split between the corresponding signal peaks in all three spatial dimensions.

        <p>One of the original motivations behind any cell clustering is to reconstruct single-particle showers with the highest possible precision in terms of energy and shape. The immediate expectation is that the clustering algorithm should be very efficient in reconstructing one cluster for each particle entering the calorimeter. While this view is appropriate for dense and highly compact electromagnetic showers with relatively small shower-to-shower fluctuations in their longitudinal (along the direction of flight of the incoming particle) and lateral (perpendicular to the direction of flight) extensions, hadronic showers are subject to much larger intrinsic fluctuations leading to large shower-to-shower variations in their shapes and compactness. Hadrons generated in inelastic interactions in the course of the hadronic shower can even travel significant distances and generate sub-showers outside the direct neighbourhood of the calorimeter cell containing the initial hadronic interaction. This means that topo-clusters can contain only a fraction of the hadronic shower.One of the original motivations behind any cell clustering is to reconstruct single-particle showers with the highest possible precision in terms of energy and shape.

        <p>Neutral pions with E π 0 = 100 GeV injected into the detector at a fixed direction often generate only one topo-cluster from largely overlapping electromagnetic showers, as the angular distance between the two photons from π 0 → γ γ is small. This is demonstrated by the N clus distribution for topo-clusters generated by π 0 at |η| = 0.3 in ATLAS in Fig. 7a peaking at N clus = 1, with a probability only slightly larger than the one for N clus = 2. In the latter case the two topo-clusters from the π 0 are generated by (1) resolving the two photon-induced showers, (2) a possible residual imperfect signal collection and proto-cluster splitting in the topo-cluster algorithm, or by (3) accidental inclusion of additional topo-cluster(s) generated by electronic noise. While the particular reason for the second cluster depends on effects introduced by local features including the calorimeter readout granularity and cell noise levels at a given direction η, hypothesis (1) is found to be least likely as it is observed that the energy sharing between the two topo-clusters is typically very asymmetric.

        <p>As discussed in Sect. 4, most topo-clusters provide geometrical and signal moments sensitive to the nature of the shower producing the cluster signal. In particular, electromagnetic showers with their compact shower development, early starting point and relatively small intrinsic fluctuations can generate cluster characteristics very different from those generated by hadronic showers. The latter are in general subjected to larger shower-by-shower fluctuations in their development and can be located deeper into the calorimeter. In addition, the hadronic showers show larger variations of their starting point in the calorimeter. A classification of each topo-cluster according to its likely origin determines the most appropriate mix of EM and HAD calibration and correction functions to be applied.As discussed in Sect. 4, most topo-clusters provide geometrical and signal moments sensitive to the nature of the shower producing the cluster signal.

The isolation of this layer then dominates the overall f iso , as given by Eq. (28) in Sect. 4.2.5. This dominance of just one sampling layer with the minimal number of cells is typical for topo-clusters seeded by a cell barely above the seed threshold defined in Eq. ( 3) and too little energy in the neighbouring samplings to further expand the cluster. Neighbouring cells then limit f iso to the multiples E v e r y w h e r e e l s e of 1/16 visible in Figs. 16a andb. Even multiples of 1/16 occur more often than odd multiples since they can be produced more easily by topo-clusters with a different number of neighbours. The fact that clusters close to the noise threshold are mainly responsible for the peaks explains the mismatch between data and MC simulations observed in the peak heights, and points to non-perfect modelling of noise and very small signals. The overall structure of the f iso spectrum in data is well reproduced in terms of the peak locations by MC simulations.The peak structure in the f iso distributions shown in Figs. 16a andb is indicative of topo-clusters which have a large fraction of their energy in one sampling layer in the (regular) ATLAS calorimeter read-out segmentation with at least 16 cells around the perimeter of clustered cells in a sampling layer.

        <p>Particles traversing the inactive (dead) material in front of or between calorimeter modules can deposit energy in it, thus reducing the measurable energy. This energy loss is addressed on average by the dead material correction. It is derived with single-particle MC simulations, where the deposited energy in the dead material outside of the active calorimeter can be calculated. This material is divided into virtual cells with a pointing geometry in (η, φ). These cells are similar to the ATLAS calorimeter cells, but typically larger in size. Depending on the particle's direction of flight, eight distinct regions are mapped out, as summarised in Table 2.

        <p>The topo-cluster number density changes rapidly at |η clus | = 2.5. This is a consequence of the reduction of the calorimeter cell granularity by about a factor of four in terms of pseudorapidity and azimuth ( η × φ), which reduces the number of potential topo-cluster seeds. The granularity change also introduces more signal overlap between individual particles in any given cell and thus less spatial resolution for the reconstruction of the corresponding energy flow due to this merging of particle signals. In addition, the larger cells increase the noise thresholds, as shown in Figs. 4b andc, which changes the calorimeter sensitivity.

        <p>In some cases, pile-up can actually increase the cluster splitting, as additional local signal maxima can be inserted into a topo-cluster by pile-up. In addition, the increased cell noise can produce additional signal minima in groups of previ-ously connected cells in the topo-cluster. This last effect can be more important for topo-clusters in jets and is discussed in Sect. 6.3. The topo-cluster depth location λ clus discussed here serves as an example for the quality of modelling cluster moments in the presence of pile-up. Other moments are investigated in the context of jets. The modelling of λ clus in the calorimeter is compared to data in Fig. 28 for the inclusive Z → μμ sample in the same bins of η clus used for the study of p T,clus in Fig. 22. The fully simulated events with pile-up from the minimum-bias simulations show significant differences from the data, while the MC simulations overlaid with pile-up from data show good agreement with respect to all features of these distributions. The complex structure of the distributions reflects the longitudinal calorimeter segmentation in the various regions defined by η clus . For example, the forward direction 3.8 &lt; |η clus | &lt; 4.0 is covered by the FCAL, which has three coarse and deep longitudinal segments (approximately 2.5/3.5/3.5 λ nucl ).

Therefore, the performance of the simulation of their constituents is important, in particular for analyses employing jet substructure techniques or relying on the jet mass. In order to study the topo-cluster features in jets and the jet topo-cluster composition, exclusive jet samples are extracted from data and MC simulation using the Z → μμ and jet selection described in Sect. 6.2.1.

This observation, together with the insensitivity of the data/MC comparison of the multiplicity of harder topo-clusters to the choice of pile-up modelling in MC simulations shown in Fig. 32, suggests that the deficiencies in the simulation of the low-energy topo-cluster multiplicity arise from imperfections in the detector model, response or tuning of the parton shower and other sources of soft emissions, including multiple parton interactions in the underlying event, rather than from the modelling of pileup or electronic noise.

The distribution of the depth location of the leading topocluster, already discussed for all and selected topo-clusters in the inclusive Z → μμ sample in Sect. 6.2.5 and the Z → μμ sample with jets in Sect. 6.3.3, is shown in Fig. 36a-c for jets reconstructed in the central, end-cap, and the forward detector region, respectively. As expected from the previous observations, MC simulations agree reasonably well with data. It is also observed that the leading cluster in the central and end-cap detector regions is most often located either in the electromagnetic or in the hadronic calorimeters, and rarely between the modules. In the forward region, the hardest cluster is most often located in the first FCAL module.</p>

        <p>The forward detector region has a coarser longitudinal segmentation, with the first module FCAL0 closest to the to MC simulations with fully simulated pile-up for Z → μμ events recorded in 2012.

        <p>The overall effect of the LCW calibration described in Sect. 5 on the signal scale of the leading topo-cluster can be measured by the ratio of the basic EM scale signal E EM clus to the fully calibrated cluster signal E LCW clus . The distribution of this ratio is shown for the three detector regions in Fig. 38a. These distributions are inclusive with respect to the topo-cluster classification described in Sect. 5.2. The shapes observed in the central and end-cap detector regions reflect this classification of the leading topo-cluster. The rightmost peak is mostly produced by topo-clusters that are generated by elec-tromagnetic showers and predominantly calibrated as such. In this case the calibration corrections consist of relatively small out-of-cluster and dead material corrections only, as outlined in Sect. 5. As a consequence, E EM clus /E LCW clus is closer to unity. Topo-clusters classified as hadronic receive much larger corrections, and are more likely to populate the lower side of the E EM clus /E LCW clus spectrum. The E EM clus /E LCW clus distribution in the forward detector region shown in Fig. 38c does not display these shapes. This is due to a lack of classification power in the coarse geometry of the FCAL. Here most topo-clusters are classified as hadronic and receive relatively large corrections. The populated ranges of E EM clus /E LCW clus in Figs. 38a andb indicate that the magnitude of the total correction scaling the basic cluster signal E EM clus up to the locally calibrated signal E LCW clus reaches considerably higher values in the central region than in the end-cap detector regions. This reflects the fact that the incoming particle energies are higher at larger |η| for a given range in jet p T . Therefore, the calorimeter response to hadrons relative to the response to electrons and photons (e/π ) rises with increasing |η|, and reduces the amount of corrections needed. This effect is initially expected to be observed when comparing the end-cap with the forward region displayed in Fig. 38c as well, yet in the FCAL the out-of-cluster and dead material corrections are larger than the hadronic calibration addressing e/π &gt; 1 and thus dominate the overall LCW calibration.The overall effect of the LCW calibration described in Sect. 5 on the signal scale of the leading topo-cluster can be measured by the ratio of the basic EM scale signal E EM clus to the fully calibrated cluster signal E LCW clus .

The pile-up activity is measured in terms of μ for this evaluation. A small linear drop of f lead (μ) is observed for increasing μ in all three detector regions in Fig. 40a. This signal loss of the leading topo-cluster can arise from two effects. First, the increase of the out-of-time pileup contributions due to the rising μ reduces the signal due to the bipolar signal shaping function employed in the ATLAS LAr calorimeters (see discussion in Sect. 2.2.1). Second, the increasing in-time pile-up contributions at higher μ and the increased noise introduced by more out-of-time pile-up leads to additional splitting in the topo-cluster formation, which can take signal away from the leading cluster in the jets.The pile-up dependence of the average leading cluster signal fraction f lead , the average E EM clus /E LCW clus ratio, and the average depth location of the leading topo-cluster are displayed in Fig. 40.

The MC simulations reproduce the shape of the λ 2 distributions from data well in the central and forward regions, with some deficiencies observed in the end-cap region. The shapes in the central and end-cap region are due to leading topo-clusters contained in the electromagnetic calorimeters populating the left peak of the distribution (short clusters) and leading topo-clusters in the hadronic calorimeters populating the right peak with longer clusters. The shape of the length distribution in the forward region shown in Fig. 42c is characterised by a sharp drop on the right of the spectrum, which corresponds to the half-depth of cells (225 mm) in the FCAL modules.
