        <p>We utilise JWST NIRCam medium-band imaging to search for extreme redshift (𝑧 ≥ 9.5) galaxy candidates in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) and the additional pointing within the GOODS-South field provided by the second NIRCam module. Our search reveals 6 robust candidates, 3 of which have recently been spectroscopically confirmed. One of these 3 is the previously controversial 𝑧 12 galaxy candidate UDF-22980 which is now detected in five JWST NIRCam medium-band filters (F182M, F210M, F430M, F460M and F480M), efficiently excluding alternative low-redshift solutions and allowing us to now report a secure photometric redshift of 𝑧 phot = 11.6 ± 0.2. We also detect 2 galaxies at 𝑧 ≥ 12.5 including a newly-detected candidate in the imaging provided by the second NIRCam module (south-west of the HUDF) at 𝑧 phot = 12.6 ± 0.6.

        <p>. We find stellar masses of log(𝑀 ★ /M ) 7.5 -8.7 and star-formation rates of log(SFR/M -1 yr -1 ) 0.3 -5.0. Despite the relatively small cosmological volume covered by the HUDF itself and the second NIRCam module imaging, we find that the existence of these galaxies is fully consistent with the latest measurements of both the UV luminosity function and cosmic star-formation rate density at 𝑧 11, supporting a gradual steady decline in the cosmic star-formation rate density out to at least 𝑧 15..

        <p>Until recently, the observational frontier was defined by galaxies that could be selected and studied using a combination of deep nearinfrared imaging with HST and shallower mid-infrared imaging with Spitzer. This combination of facilities led to significant improvements in our understanding of galaxy evolution out to 𝑧 9 (e.g. Ellis et al. 2013;McLure et al. 2013;Oesch et al. 2014Oesch et al. , 2018;;Finkelstein et al. 2015;McLeod et al. 2015McLeod et al. , 2016;;Bouwens et al. 2021Bouwens et al. , 2022)). Due to its long-wavelength limit of 1.7 𝜇m, HST imaging can only identify galaxies out to 𝑧 12, and even then only with singleband detections in the F160W filter. Prior to the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the most distant spectroscopicallyconfirmed galaxy had a redshift of 𝑧 = 10.957 ± 0.001: GN-z11 (Oesch et al. 2016;Jiang et al. 2021), a source that was originally selected using HST F160W imaging combined with non-detections at shorter wavelengths.Until recently, the observational frontier was defined by galaxies that could be selected and studied using a combination of deep nearinfrared imaging with HST and shallower mid-infrared imaging with Spitzer.

The extended wavelength coverage of NIRCam imaging to 𝜆 5 𝜇m has facilitated the robust detection of galaxies at 𝑧 ≥ 10 for the first time (e.g. Finkelstein et al. 2022b,a;Adams et al. 2023;Castellano et al. 2022;Naidu et al. 2022) including galaxy candidates at 𝑧 16 (Donnan et al. 2023;Harikane et al. 2022).

        <p>Although GN-z11 was the highest redshift, spectroscopicallyconfirmed galaxy prior to JWST, another even higher-redshift galaxy candidate was identified in the HST UDF12 imaging of the HUDF (Ellis et al. 2013;McLure et al. 2013) with a best-fitting redshift of 𝑧 phot = 11.9 +0.3 -0.5 . This galaxy (UDF12-3954-6284) is the highestredshift candidate ever identified from HST imaging. In fact it was originally noted as a potential 𝑧 10 galaxy (UDFj-39546284) from the UDF09 imaging of the HUDF (Bouwens et al. 2011), based on a F160W detection and non-detections in F125W, F105W and the HUDF ACS optical imaging. However, following the UDF12 HST imaging campaign, the galaxy was also found to be undetected in the F140W filter which, given the substantial overlap between the F140W and F160W filters, favoured a significantly higher redshift of 𝑧 11.9 (Ellis et al. 2013). Robertson et al. (2022) and Curtis-Lake et al. ( 2022) have recently reported JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of 4 galaxies within the GOODS-S field from the JADES survey, including spectroscopic confirmation of UDFj-39546284 at 𝑧 spec = 11.58 ± 0.05. They also report a galaxy at 𝑧 spec = 13.20 +0.04 -0.07 which now overtakes Gn-z11 as the highest redshift spectroscopically-confirmed galaxy. In addition, they derive stellar masses, star-formation rates and mean stellar ages for these 4 objects, finding results consistent with expectations at these redshifts. Bouwens et al. (2022) used JWST NIRCam medium band imaging to measure the evolution of the UV luminosity function in the redshift range 𝑧 = 8-15 using high-redshift galaxy candidates selected from within the HUDF area alone. Consistent with other studies (e.g. Donnan et al. 2023;Harikane et al. 2022) their results do not support the previously suggested rapid decline in the cosmic star-formation rate density (𝜌 SFR ) beyond 𝑧 ∼ 8 (Oesch et al. 2018). However, their measurements of 𝜌 SFR at 𝑧 11 are in fact significantly higher than what was derived by Donnan et al. (2023). They also measure an absolute UV magnitude, 𝑀 UV , that is 1 magnitude brighter than reported by Robertson et al.

        <p>Motivated by the continued uncertainty over the nature of the UV luminosity function and cosmic star-formation rate density at 𝑧 10, we analyse a combination of the ultra-deep HST ACS+WFC3/IR data available in GOODS-S/UDF with the full area available from JWST NIRCam medium-band imaging at 𝜆 2 𝜇m and 𝜆 4.5 𝜇m to search for galaxy candidates at 𝑧 ≥ 9.5. Crucially, the new NIRCam imaging (ID 1963;PI Williams) is the first publicly available data in the HUDF red-ward of 𝜆 1.6 𝜇m with sufficient sensitivity to robustly detect candidates at 𝑧 ≥ 9.5. The aim of this study is to exploit the new JWST imaging data to derive secure photometric redshifts for 𝑧 ≥ 9.5 galaxy candidates and provide further constraints on the galaxy UV luminosity function and hence luminosity density at 𝑧 ≥ 9.5. We also employ Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting to derive the basic properties of the stellar populations in these early galaxies.Motivated by the continued uncertainty over the nature of the UV luminosity function and cosmic star-formation rate density at 𝑧 10, we analyse a combination of the ultra-deep HST ACS+WFC3/IR data available in GOODS-S/UDF with the full area available from JWST NIRCam medium-band imaging at 𝜆 2 𝜇m and 𝜆 4.5 𝜇m to search for galaxy candidates at 𝑧 ≥ 9.5.

        <p>The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we describe the imaging data and source catalogue creation. In Section 3 we explain the sample selection and the measurement of the physical properties of the galaxies. In Section 4 we present our derived luminosity function and the resulting inferred high-redshift dependence of the cosmic star-formation rate density. In Section 5 we discuss our results in the context of other recent observational studies and the predictions of various theoretical/numerial models of galaxy formation. Finally, in Section 6 we summarise our conclusions. Throughout we use magnitudes in the AB system (Oke 1974;Oke &amp; Gunn 1983), and assume a standard cosmological model with 𝐻 0 = 70 km s -1 Mpc -1 , Ω 𝑚 = 0.3 and Ω Λ = 0.7.The paper is structured as follows.

        <p>We utilise deep imaging from HST and JWST in the HUDF. From HST we use data covering the wavelength range 𝜆 0.4 -1.6 𝜇𝑚 from ACS F435W, F606W, F775W, F814W, F850LP and WFC3 F105W, F125W, F140W and F160W imaging. We utilise new JWST imaging from the HUDF medium-band survey (ID 1963; PI Williams) which contains deep NIRCam imaging through the F182M, F210M, F430M, F460M and F480M filters (Williams et al. 2023). The 5𝜎 global depths for F182M and F210M are 𝑚 AB 29 and for F430M, F460M and F480M they are 𝑚 AB 28.5. The data were reduced using the

        <p>We perform a search for galaxies using SExtractor (Bertin &amp; Arnouts 1996) in dual-image mode. We use the F182M band image as the detection image as it is the deepest imaging sampling flux longward of the Lyman break. For the photometry in the JWST NIRCam imaging, we use a similar technique to Donnan et al. (2023), with 0.24 arcsec-diameter apertures in the SW filters (F182M, F210M) and 0.3 arcsec-diameter apertures in the LW filters (F430M, F460M, F480M). We also use 0.3 arcsec-diameter apertures in the HST ACS and WFC3 filters. All of the photometry was then corrected to 76% of total (as this is approximately the flux enclosed by the apertures utilised for F182M) using a point-source correction based on the curve-of-growth of each filter's PSF. We adopt the 1𝜎 local depth as the error on the fluxes measured through each filter. This was determined by 1.483 × MAD where MAD is the median absolute deviation of the flux in the closest 200 empty apertures to the source.We perform a search for galaxies using SExtractor (Bertin &amp; Arnouts 1996) in dual-image mode.

        <p>We use the photometric redshift (photo-z) code EAZY (Brammer et al. 2008) for our primary redshift determination, fitting with the P (Fioc &amp; Rocca-Volmerange 1999) set of templates which include nebular emission lines. We determine the primary solution by allowing templates to vary over the redshift range 0 &lt; 𝑧 &lt; 25 and a secondary low-redshift solution by restricting the redshift range to 0 &lt; 𝑧 &lt; 6. We select our sample by requiring a best-fitting photometric redshift at 𝑧 ≥ 9.5 with a threshold value of Δ𝜒 2 ≥ 4 between the primary and secondary solution. Due to the position of the Lyman break, we require the flux to be &lt; 2𝜎 in all the ACS filters. We also require the flux to be &gt; 5𝜎 in either F160W or F182M with the next reddest filter at 3𝜎 to ensure a robust detection long-ward of the Lyman break. We visually inspect the final sample to remove artefacts and diffraction spikes. To verify the robustness of the photometric redshifts, we also fitted the photometry using two further SED fitting codes: LePhare (Arnouts et al. 1999;Ilbert et al. 2006) with templates from Bruzual &amp; Charlot (2003) and with dust attenuation spanning the range 𝐴 𝑉 = 0.0 -6.0, and also the code described in McLure et al.

        <p>UDF-21003, with a photo-z of 𝑧 = 9.8 +0.2 -0.1 , is a newly-detected source which is in fact the most robustly detected candidate in the sample. It was previously undetected likely due to the close positioning of a low-redshift nearby source. UDF-3216 is newly-detected candidate at 𝑧 = 12.6 ± 0.7 which is located in the second/parallel NIRCam module. Multi-waveband postage-stamp images of the 6 galaxies in the sample are shown in Fig. 1, while the photometric data for the sample along with the two alternative (high-redshift and low-redshift) SED fits for each galaxy are shown in Fig. 2. Robertson et al. (2022) reported photometric properties of 4 galaxies with spectroscopic confirmation in a companion paper (Curtis-Lake et al. 2022) using data from the JADES survey. We recover 3 of the 4 galaxies in their sample (the fourth source is positioned outside the medium band imaging) with our photometric redshifts broadly consistent with their spectroscopic redshifts. These are noted in the final column in Table 2. Bouwens et al. (2022) also recently searched for galaxies using the JWST UDF medium band survey and found 4 galaxies at 𝑧 ≥ 9.5. We recover 3 of these candidates in our sample as indicated in Table 2. The 4th source, XDFH-2334046578 in Bouwens et al. (2022), is not included in this sample as it failed the visual inspection stage due to an unusual positional offset of the source in F160W. Therefore we were not confident in the strength of the break between the F160W and F182M filters. For the 3 we recover, we find good agreement overall in the photometric redshifts. However, for UDF-22980 we measure a moderately lower redshift. We also find a significantly fainter absolute UV magnitude for this source of 𝑀 UV = -19.4 compared to the value of 𝑀 UV = -20.2 reported by Bouwens et al. (2022).

We then use the B spectral fitting code (Carnall et al. 2018) to further constrain the physical properties of the galaxies in our sample. We run B using the configuration described in Carnall et al. (2020Carnall et al. ( , 2023)), which includes the 2016 updated version of the Bruzual &amp; Charlot (2003) stellar population models with the MILES stellar spectral library, an emission line prescription calculated using the Cloudy photoionization code (Ferland et al. 2017), the Salim et al.

We find that these galaxies have relatively low stellar masses (log(𝑀 ★ /M ) 7.5 -8.7) and star-formation rates in the range log(SFR/M yr -1 ) 0.3 -5.0. The limited detections longward of the Balmer break prevent any conclusive constraints on the stellar ages of these galaxies. Nevertheless, the mean stellar ages derived from B are moderate (∼ 40 Myr), and for those with spectroscopic confirmation, are consistent with ages derived using the more extensive filter coverage in the JADES survey (Robertson et al. 2022).All the fluxes were corrected to total assuming a point source correction based on the curve-of-growth.

        <p>Using the filters long-ward of the Lyman break we determine the rest-frame UV continuum slope, 𝛽 (where flux 𝑓 𝜆 ∝ 𝜆 𝛽 ) with the technique described in Cullen et al. (2023). Due to the limited number of filters beyond the Lyman break, the UV slope remains relatively unconstrained for most of these objects. However, we measure a robust UV slope for UDF-21003, finding 𝛽 = -2.5 ± 0.2. This represents a very blue UV continuum indicating the presence of a young, low-metallicity stellar population. However, we note that Cullen et al.

        <p>The binned co-moving number density of sources per absolute magnitude, Φ(𝑀 UV ), is determined using the 1/𝑉 max method (Schmidt 1968). The volume, 𝑉 max , is defined as the difference in co-moving volume between the volume at 𝑧 = 9.5 and the maximum redshift that the galaxy could be detected at 8𝜎 in F182M with a limit at 𝑧 = 13.5 for this selection. We find that 2 of the sources are detectable to 𝑧 = 13.5 whereas the 2 fainter sources are only detectable to 𝑧 11.8 and 𝑧 12.6. Therefore the average redshift of the limited volumes is 𝑧 11.2. In order to account for incompleteness in the galaxy sample, we perform completeness simulations using the same method as described in Donnan et al. (2023), with point sources injected into the F182M imaging in 3 regions across the 2 modules. From 𝑚 AB = 24-31 in steps of 0.1, 800 sources are injected into each region and the rate of recovery measured. This process is repeated 10 times for each region which therefore results in a total of 1,680,000 sources injected into the imaging. This generates the completeness as a function of apparent magnitude in the detection image, F182M.The binned co-moving number density of sources per absolute magnitude, Φ(𝑀 UV ), is determined using the 1/𝑉 max method (Schmidt 1968).

        <p>As the UV LF is derived here using a relatively small cosmological volume (Donnan et al. (2023) use a ∼ 5× larger volume), our results are more vulnerable to cosmic variance. To account for this we use the cosmic variance calculator from Trenti &amp; Stiavelli (2008). We measure an uncertainty of 27% due to cosmic variance which is smaller than the uncertainties arrising from the small sample size. The cosmic variance uncertainty was factored into the final uncertainty on the number density. The resultant galaxy number density in this bin is shown in Fig. 3 where Φ(𝑀 UV = -19.2) = (1.03 +0.86 -0.57 ) × 10 -4 mag -1 Mpc -3 .As the UV LF is derived here using a relatively small cosmological volume (Donnan et al.

        <p>This new estimate at 𝑧 11.2 is fully consistent with the recentlyreported evolution of the UV LF from 𝑧 ∼ 10.5 to 𝑧 ∼ 13.25 (Donnan et al. 2023). We fit a double-power law (DPL) using the same technique described in Donnan et al. (2023) where we fix 𝛼, 𝛽 and 𝑀 * to -2.10, -3.53, -19.12 respectively. These are the best fitting values at 𝑧 ∼ 10.5 (Donnan et al. 2023) and therefore we allow only 𝜙 * as a free parameter. This results in a best-fitting DPL model with 𝜙 * = (2.36 ± 1.60) × 10 -4 /mag/Mpc 3 . We then perform a luminosity-weighted integral of the best-fitting DPL model to derive the comoving UV luminosity density (𝜌 UV ) and therefore cosmic star-formation rate density (𝜌 SFR ). This is shown as the red point in Fig. 4 which is in good agreement with the log-linear relation from Donnan et al. (2023, solid black line) and is therefore consistent with a steady, exponential decline in 𝜌 UV to 𝑧 ∼ 15. Our results are inconsistent with the result at 𝑧 ∼ 12.6 from Bouwens et al. (2022) as they predict a significantly higher 𝜌 UV as shown by the green point at 𝑧 ∼ 12.6 in Fig. 4. This is possibly impacted by their estimate of 𝑀 UV for UDF-22980 which is ∼ 0.8 mag brighter than derived here (see Section 3.2). They also restrict their search to the HUDF area alone and therefore probe a smaller cosmological volume than utilised in this search, which, as they mention, also makes their measurement of the UV LF somewhat more sensitive to cosmic variance. They report a cosmic variance uncertainty of ∼ 52% using the Trenti &amp; Stiavelli (2008) calculator which is notably larger than we calculate for our LF (∼ 27%). Bouwens et al. (2022) also use a significantly steeper value of the faint end slope of 𝛼 = -2.71.

        <p>The results of this study thus further support the analytical prediction from Hernquist &amp; Springel (2003) that a steady, exponential decline in 𝜌 SFR is expected with increasing redshift, as illustrated by the solid line in the left-hand panel of Fig. 4. In the right-hand panel of Fig. 4 we additionally provide a comparison of the new observational constraints on the UV luminosity density with the pre-dictions of various different theoretical/numerical models. Although the observational data points lie below the extreme-redshift extrapolation of the relation provided by Madau &amp; Dickinson (2014), they sit above the predictions from semi-empirical constant star-formation efficiency models as deduced by Mason et al. (2022) and Tacchella et al. (2018). We also compare to the cosmological hydrodynamical simulations

Overall, it can be seen that there is a wide range in the predictions of the different theoretical models; the new observational constraints sit above most of the theoretical curves but are reasonably in-line with the predictions from FLARES and the semi-analytical model presented by Behroozi &amp; Silk (2015).

        <p>After UDF-22980 was proposed to lie at 𝑧 = 11.9 (Ellis et al. 2013;McLure et al. 2013), there followed much discussion on the nature of this object, in part informed by a series of follow-up observations. Brammer et al. (2013) used HST GRISM spectroscopy and Capak et al. (2013) used Keck MOSFIRE to search for emission lines. No robust emission lines were detected but tentative (∼ 2𝜎) detections were reported at 𝜆 obs 1.6𝜇m. It was concluded that this could be consistent with an [OIII]𝜆4959,5007 detection at 𝑧 = 2.19 or [OII]𝜆3727,3729 at 𝑧 = 3.29. Now, however, with the JWST medium band imaging at 𝜆 obs &gt; 1.6 𝜇m we can robustly constrain the shape of the galaxy SED. We find that, fitting with EAZY and LePhare, the new enhanced photometry is inconsistent with any solution at at 𝑧 = 2.19 or 𝑧 = 3.29. When the fit is forced to these redshifts we find that the best-fitting (formally unacceptable) solution is an old passive galaxy which would not have the strong emission lines required for these low-z solutions. Another inconsistency with the low-z solution is that a strong [OIII] emitter at 𝑧 = 2.19 would likely have strong H𝛼 emission at 𝜆 obs = 2.1 𝜇m. This would result in a substantially smaller flux in F182M than in F210M which is not what is observed. This conclusion is also reinforced by the recent JWST spectroscopic observations from the JADES survey, albeit no emission lines were detected with NIRSpec (Robertson et al. 2022;Curtis-Lake et al. 2022).After UDF-22980 was proposed to lie at 𝑧 = 11.9 (Ellis et al. 2013;McLure et al. 2013), there followed much discussion on the nature of this object, in part informed by a series of follow-up observations.

        <p>The galaxy number density and hence cosmic star-formation rate density at 𝑧 11 derived from this sample are fully consistent with the current picture of the evolution of the UV LF with a gradual steady decline over the redshift range 𝑧 = 8-15. The resulting inferred gradual (exponential) decline in cosmic star-formation rate density out to at least 𝑧 15 is clearly inconsistent with at least some theoretical/numerical models of early galaxy evolution.The galaxy number density and hence cosmic star-formation rate density at 𝑧 11 derived from this sample are fully consistent with the current picture of the evolution of the UV LF with a gradual steady decline over the redshift range 𝑧 = 8-15.

        <p>This study further demonstrates the power of JWST to quickly reveal the true nature of 𝑧 ≥ 10 candidates that were first identified by HST as well as to detect new galaxy candidates, with the NIRCam medium-band imaging analysed here providing sensitive photometry at 𝜆 obs 1.6 𝜇m. Robust photometric redshifts are vital for drawing conclusions about the physical properties of 𝑧 ≥ 10 galaxies as well as providing a tighter frequency range for ALMA follow-up spectroscopy. Forthcoming JWST surveys will primarily target fields that are accessible to ALMA, and were heavily imaged by HST such as NGDEEP (GO 2079) and PRIMER (GO 1837) 1 and will therefore benefit from this combination. Therefore, it is likely these surveys will provide large statistically-significant samples of galaxies over a wide redshift range which will yield further constraints on the highredshift evolution of the UV luminosity function as well as providing numerous extreme-redshift galaxy candidates for follow-up JWST and ALMA spectroscopy.This study further demonstrates the power of JWST to quickly reveal the true nature of 𝑧 ≥ 10 candidates that were first identified by HST as well as to detect new galaxy candidates, with the NIRCam medium-band imaging analysed here providing sensitive photometry at 𝜆 obs 1.6 𝜇m.
