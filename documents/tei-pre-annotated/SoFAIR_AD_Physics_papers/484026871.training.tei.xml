        <p>The assembly of the first super massive black holes (SMBHs) at z 6 is still a subject of intense debate. If black holes (BHs) grow at their Eddington rate, they must start from 10 4 M seeds formed by the direct collapse of gas. Here, we explore the alternative scenario where ∼100 M BH remnants of the first stars grow at super-Eddington rate via radiatively inefficient slim accretion discs. We use an improved version of the cosmological, data-constrained semianalytic model GAMETE/QSODUST, where we follow the evolution of nuclear BHs and gas cooling, disc and bulge formation of their host galaxies. Adopting SDSS J1148+5251 (J1148) at z = 6.4 as a prototype of luminous z 6 quasars, we find that ∼80 per cent of its SMBH mass is grown by super-Eddington accretion, which can be sustained down to z ∼ 10 in dense, gas-rich environments. The average BH mass at z ∼ 20 is M BH 10 4 M , comparable to that of direct collapse BHs. At z = 6.4 the AGN-driven mass outflow rate is consistent with the observations and the BH-to-bulge mass ratio is compatible with the local scaling relation. However, the stellar mass in the central 2.5 kpc is closer to the value inferred from CO observations. Finally, ∼20 per cent of J1148 progenitors at z = 7.1 have BH luminosities and masses comparable to ULAS J1120+0641, suggesting that this quasar may be one of the progenitors of J1148.The assembly of the first super massive black holes (SMBHs) at z 6 is still a subject of intense debate.

        <p>In order to grow up to billion solar masses at z ∼ 6, seed BHs must accrete gas at the Eddington rate almost uninterruptedly for several hundreds of Myr, even if they start as 'heavy seeds' of [10 5 -10 6 ] M . Alternatively, short episodes of super-Eddington accretion have been suggested as a viable way to allow the efficient growth of SMBHs, especially if these start from 'light seeds' of ∼100 M (Haiman 2004;Yoo &amp; Miralda-Escudé 2004;Shapiro 2005;Volonteri &amp; Rees 2005, 2006;Pelupessy, Di Matteo &amp; Ciardi 2007;Tanaka &amp; Haiman 2009;Madau, Haardt &amp; Dotti 2014;Volonteri, Silk &amp; Dubus 2015). In a recent numerical study, Lupi et al. (2016) show that, if a large reservoir of dense cold gas is available, a M BH ∼ 10 5 M can grow in an ∼Myr time-scale starting from a seed mass of ∼20-100 M , under the assumption of a slim accretion disc solution (Abramowicz et al. 1988). The slim disc solution, that we better describe in Section 2.3, represents advective, optically thick flows that generalize the standard Shakura &amp; Sunyaev solution (Shakura &amp; Sunyaev 1973). In this model, the radiative efficiencies, which depend on the accretion rate, are low: the radiation is trapped and advected inward by the accretion flow (see however the recent simulations by Sa ¸dowski &amp; Narayan 2016).

        <p>In this paper, we investigate the role of super-Eddington accretion in the formation of the first SMBHs at redshift z ∼ 6, with the aim to understand what are the environments where it can occur and discuss the implications for the coevolution of the SMBHs and their host galaxies at high redshifts.

            <rs type="software">GAMETE/QSODUST</rs> that allows us to simulate a large number of hierarchical histories of a quasar host dark matter (DM) halo, following the star formation history, chemical evolution and nuclear BH growth in all its progenitor galaxies. The model has been first successfully used to investigate the properties of the z = 6.4 quasar SDSS J1148+5251 by Valiante et al. (2011Valiante et al. ( , 2012)), applied to a sample of quasars at 5 &lt; z &lt; 6.4 by Valiante et al. (2014) and more recently used to investigate the relative importance of light and heavy seeds in the early growth of high-z SMBHs under the assumption of Eddington-limited accretion (Valiante et al. 2016). Here, we present an improved version of the model, which has been modified to follow gas cooling, disc and bulge formation, and BH gas accretion in all the progenitor systems of a z = 6.4 quasar, using SDSS J1148+5251 (hereafter J1148) as a prototype for the general class of luminous high-redshift quasars.

        <p>Along the hierarchical history of the final DM halo, we define major (minor) halo-halo merger events as those with halo mass ratio μ = M halo,1 /M halo,2 (with M halo,1 ≤ M halo,2 ) larger (lower) than μ thr = 1/4 (Barausse 2012). In quiescent evolution (i.e. no encounters with other galaxies), the cold gas settles on a rotationally supported disc because of the conservation of angular momentum, and can start to form stars. The disc, composed of gas and stars, can be disrupted by a major merger and a spherical bulge is expected to form in this event. Minor mergers, instead, are not expected to destroy the disc but may help the growth of the bulge by disc instabilities (Naab &amp; Burkert 2003;Bournaud et al. 2005). In our model, major mergers are supposed to destroy both the gaseous and stellar disc components of the newly formed galaxy, adding the stars and gas to the central bulge. Minor mergers do not contribute to the transfer of matter between the disc and bulge, and thus lead to the formation of a new galaxy with disc and bulge masses that are the sum of the two progenitor ones.Along the hierarchical history of the final DM halo, we define major (minor) halo-halo merger events as those with halo mass ratio μ = M halo,1 /M halo,2 (with M halo,1 ≤ M halo,2 ) larger (lower) than μ thr = 1/4 (Barausse 2012).

        <p>In Fig. 1, we show the redshift evolution of the total SFR (summed over all the progenitor galaxies in each simulation) and the separate contribution of Pop III stars. We also show the upper limit on the SFR of ∼2000 M yr -1 (Table 1) inferred from the observed FIR luminosity using the relation L FIR / L = 10.84 × 10 9 SFR/( M yr -1 ) (Valiante et al. 2014). This relation4 is based on the assumption of starburst-dominated dust heating and it provides only an upper limit to the real SFR, due to the non-negligible contribution from the AGN. According to a recent detailed radiative transfer analysis, the AGN can provide up to 60 per cent of the total FIR luminosity (Schneider et al. 2015), decreasing the SFR by a factor of 1.4-2.5, in agreement with the average value of ∼800 M yr -1 predicted by the reference model. Due to efficient metal enrichment, Pop III star formation becomes negligible below z ∼ 20 and no more BH seeds are formed, consistent with other studies (Haiman &amp; Loeb 2001;Madau &amp; Rees 2001;Heger et al. 2003;Volonteri, Haardt &amp; Madau 2003;Madau et al. 2004;Valiante et al. 2016).

Thus, we find that a major fraction (∼90 per cent, on average) of BH seeds are formed in DM mini-haloes, where gas cooling could be easily suppressed due to H 2 photo-dissociation by Lyman-Werner photons. The inclusion of this additional feedback effect slows down metal enrichment and extends BH seeds formation to lower redshifts (z ≥ 15) and larger DM haloes (∼5 × 10 7 -10 9 M ). While the evolution of the total BH mass and BH accretion rate at z &lt; 15 is only mildly affected, the birth environment of late-forming seed BHs (gas rich Ly-α cooling haloes) may be more favourable to SE accretion. Here we do not consider the effect of H 2 photo-dissociation, which we defer to a future study, and we assume that the formation rate of Pop III stars is limited only by metal enrichment.In Fig. 1, we show the redshift evolution of the total SFR (summed over all the progenitor galaxies in each simulation) and the separate contribution of Pop III stars. We also show the upper limit on the SFR of ∼2000 M yr -1 (Table 1) inferred from the observed FIR luminosity using the relation L FIR / L = 10.84 × 10 9 SFR/( M yr -1 ) (Valiante et al. 2014). This relation4 is based on the assumption of starburst-dominated dust heating and it provides only an upper limit to the real SFR, due to the non-negligible contribution from the AGN. According to a recent detailed radiative transfer analysis, the AGN can provide up to 60 per cent of the total FIR luminosity (Schneider et al. 2015), decreasing the SFR by a factor of 1.4-2.5, in agreement with the average value of ∼800 M yr -1 predicted by the reference model. Due to efficient metal enrichment, Pop III star formation becomes negligible below z ∼ 20 and no more BH seeds are formed, consistent with other studies (Haiman &amp; Loeb 2001;Madau &amp; Rees 2001;Heger et al. 2003;Volonteri, Haardt &amp; Madau 2003;Madau et al. 2004;Valiante et al. 2016).

        <p>In Fig. 3 we show the redshift evolution of the BH mass and black hole accretion rate (BHAR) predicted by our reference model. In the top panels, the values are obtained summing over all BH progenitors present at each redshift in each simulation and then averaged over the 29 realizations. The different lines allow us to separate the contribution to the BH mass and accretion rate achieved by means of sub-Eddington (≤16 L Edd /c 2 ) and super-Eddington (&gt;16 L Edd /c 2 ) accretion events. By construction, the final BH mass predicted by the reference model is ∼(3.6 ± 1.6) × 10 9 M , in agreement with the value inferred from observations of J1148 (see Table 1). We find that, on average, ∼75 per cent of the final SMBH mass grows by means of super-Eddington gas accretion. This provides the dominant contribution to the total BHAR at all but the smallest redshifts. Although the quantities shown in all panels have been averaged over 29 merger trees, the redshift evolution of the BHAR appears to be very intermittent, a consequence of rapid depletion/replenishment of the bulge gas reservoir out of which the BHs accrete.In Fig. 3 we show the redshift evolution of the BH mass and black hole accretion rate (BHAR) predicted by our reference model.

        <p>To gain a better idea of the typical values of BH mass and BHAR predicted by the reference model, in the bottom panels of Fig. 3 we also show the mean quantities, averaged over all BH progenitors present at each redshift in each simulation. It is clear that at 20 z 25 the mean BH mass rapidly grows from ∼100 M to ∼10 4 M by means of super-Eddington gas accretion rates of 10 -5 M yr -1 BHAR 10 -3 M yr -1 . Hence, due to early efficient super-Eddington accretion, the mean BH progenitors at z ∼ 20 have already achieved a mass comparable to the BH mass predicted by the direct collapse scenario. This is consistent with what was recently found by Lupi et al. (2016) by means of high-resolution numerical simulations, which show that stellar-mass BHs can increase their mass by 3 orders of magnitudes within a few million years while accreting gas at super-Eddington rates in the dense cores of high-z galaxies.To gain a better idea of the typical values of BH mass and BHAR predicted by the reference model, in the bottom panels of Fig. 3 we also show the mean quantities, averaged over all BH progenitors present at each redshift in each simulation.

        <p>Fig. 4 shows the average distribution of BHs accreting at superand sub-Eddington rates as a function of the BH mass and Eddington accretion ratio for different redshift intervals.

        <p>For most of the evolution, we find that BH progenitors accrete at highly super-Eddington rates, with Ṁaccr / ṀEdd 10.

        <p>We find that, even when the Eddington accretion ratio is Ṁaccr / ṀEdd ≤ 20, the final SMBH mass predicted by the reference model is in good agreement with the observations. The high-redshift evolution of both the total BH mass and the total BHAR, however, is markedly different from the results shown in Fig. 3. At z &gt; 10 the BHAR is several orders of magnitudes smaller and the BH mass is correspondingly affected, being ∼10 6 M at z ∼ 15 (∼1/100 of the total BH mass shown in Fig. 3 at the same z). Due to the smaller gas accretion rates at high redshifts, a larger gas fraction is retained around nuclear BHs at z &lt; 10. As a result, the BH mass has a steeper late growth rate, with short episodes of intense gas accretion reaching ∼10 2 M yr -1 at z ∼ 7.We find that, even when the Eddington accretion ratio is Ṁaccr / ṀEdd ≤ 20, the final SMBH mass predicted by the reference model is in good agreement with the observations.

        <p>On the contrary, when Eddington-limited gas accretion is assumed, the final BH mass can no longer be reproduced using the reference model. In this case, the gas accretion rates are too small to trigger fast BH growth at high redshifts. The total BH mass is dominated by the coalescence of BH seeds and its redshift evolution is strongly affected by lack of BH seeds at z &lt; 20 (see the behaviour of the Pop III SFR in Fig. 1) and by kicks received during BH-BH coalescences in major mergers. Fig. 6 shows the evolution of the average number of major mergers and of kicked BHs predicted by the model. While the average number of major mergers decreases with time, the number of kicked BHs increases at 20 z 25 and than decreases at lower z. This is due to the combination of the growing number of BH seeds formed at high z and of the shallow potential wells of their host mini-haloes, which allow the kick velocity of the newly formed BH to easily exceed the retention speed.On the contrary, when Eddington-limited gas accretion is assumed, the final BH mass can no longer be reproduced using the reference model.

        <p>Our model enables us to perform a statistical study of the physical properties of the environments where BH progenitors accrete at super-Eddington rates. The left panel of Fig. 4 shows that when both sub-and super-Eddington accreting BHs are present, their BH masses are comparable, with a tendency of sub-Eddington accreting BHs to have larger masses at lower z. Similarly, the occurrence of super-Eddington accretion is not correlated with the mass of the host DM halo, nor with its gas content or metallicity. At each given value of any of these quantities, in fact, both sub-and super-Eddington accreting BHs are found in the simulations.Our model enables us to perform a statistical study of the physical properties of the environments where BH progenitors accrete at super-Eddington rates.

        <p>The different accretion regimes are more cleanly separated when we plot the Eddington gas accretion ratio as a function of the ratio between the gaseous bulge and the BH masses (see the left panel of Fig. 7). Most of the BHs that accrete at sub-Eddington rates are characterized by M b /M BH &lt; 20, whereas the number of super-Eddington accreting BHs is negligible when M b /M BH &lt; 0.1. However, when 0.1 ≤ M b /M BH ≤ 20 (the region between the two vertical lines in the plot), the BHs can be characterized by vastly different accretion ratios: a good fraction of the hyper-Eddington accreting BHs are found in this region of the plot. The larger accretion rate in these systems is due to the much shorter dynamical time of the bulge. This is shown in the right panel of Fig. 7. A sequence of increasing bulge dynamical times is evident, with most of the BHs found in bulges with 0.01 Myr τ b &lt; 1 Myr in hyper-Eddington, 0.1 Myr τ b &lt; 20 Myr in mildly super-Eddington, and 5 Myr τ b &lt; 20 Myr in sub-Eddington accretion regimes. Indeed, hyper-Eddington accreting BHs are predominantly found in high-z systems, with less massive and more compact bulges. The figure also shows that super-Eddington accretion requires gas-rich bulges and that, when M b /M BH &lt; 0.1, only sub-Eddington accreting BHs in massive, gas-poor bulges are found.The different accretion regimes are more cleanly separated when we plot the Eddington gas accretion ratio as a function of the ratio between the gaseous bulge and the BH masses (see the left panel of Fig. 7).

        <p>Outflowing cold gas in J1148, traced by [C II] emission, was first detected by Maiolino et al. (2012) with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer, and then confirmed with high-resolution follow-up observations by Cicone et al. (2015). The outflow has a complex morphology and spatial extent, reaching a maximum projected radius of 30 kpc. The estimated mass outflow rate and velocity are shown in Fig. 8 as a function of the projected distance from the nucleus. In the same figure, we also show the predictions of the reference model. Following equation (30), the outflow velocity is computed as the circular velocity at the corresponding radius, v w, AGN (r) = v c (r), and we estimate the mass outflow rate accounting for the delay τ dyn = r/v w, AGN between the BH energy release and the observation. Due to the large variability of the BH luminosity, the 1σ dispersion among the different merger trees of the predicted average mass outflow rate (grey shaded region in the upper panel) is consistent with the data. However, the average values (black solid line) are larger than observed and show a different radial dependence, especially at r &gt; 20 kpc. The bottom panel shows that the observed outflow travels at a velocity consistent with the circular velocity of the host system. There are a few radii where the observed values are larger, probably reflecting a stronger coupling between the energy and momentum injected by the AGN and the surrounding gas. Yet, even if we take the observed values of outflow velocities at each radius to estimate τ dyn and Ṁw,AGN (see the blue dashed line in the upper panel with the cyan shaded region), the resulting mean mass outflow rate is still larger than observed. Our description of an energy-driven wind with constant coupling efficiency may not be adequate to capture the complex dynamics of this massive outflow. However, Cicone et al. (2015) stress that the data should be considered as a lower limit on the total mass outflow rate, because it accounts only for the atomic gas phase of the outflow, while a significant amount of the outflowing mass may be in the molecular phase.Outflowing cold gas in J1148, traced by [C II] emission, was first detected by Maiolino et al.

        <p>When the average BH mass has reached its value of (3.6 ± 1.6) × 10 9 M at z = 6.4, the host galaxy has already grown to a bulge (total) stellar mass of 2.7 (3.2) × 10 11 M . Hence, we predict a final average BH-to-bulge (total) stellar mass ratio of M BH /M star = 0.013 (0.011), well within the scatter of the relations inferred from various observational studies of massive local galaxies (Marconi &amp; Hunt 2003;Sani et al. 2011;Kormendy &amp; Ho 2013, and references therein). However, this ratio is ∼25 times smaller than what is inferred from observations of J1148 (red data point). Following the procedure commonly applied to high-z bright QSOs, the stellar mass is computed as M star = M dyn -M H 2 , with M dyn and M H 2 inferred from CO observations (see Table 1; Walter et al. 2004;Wang et al. 2010). Similar results obtained for a larger sample of z &gt; 6 QSOs have suggested the idea that the first SMBHs grow faster than their host galaxies (Wang et al. 2010(Wang et al. , 2013;;Venemans et al. 2015; see however Willott, Bergeron &amp; Omont 2015).When the average BH mass has reached its value of (3.6 ± 1.6) × 10 9 M at z = 6.4, the host galaxy has already grown to a bulge (total) stellar mass of 2.7 (3.2) × 10 11 M . Hence, we predict a final average BH-to-bulge (total) stellar mass ratio of M BH /M star = 0.013 (0.011), well within the scatter of the relations inferred from various observational studies of massive local galaxies (Marconi &amp; Hunt 2003;Sani et al. 2011;Kormendy &amp; Ho 2013, and references therein).

        <p>As suggested by Valiante et al. (2014), observations of high-z QSOs are sensitive to the innermost 2.5-3 kpc and may be missing a significant fraction of the galaxy (Valiante et al. 2014). This is also supported by recent observations of J1148, which show extended [C II] 158 µm emission and far-infrared (FIR) continuum, likely associated with cold gas and star formation on scales of ∼10-20 kpc (Cicone et al. 2015).As suggested by Valiante et al.

        <p>Indeed, the mean bulge effective radius at z = 6.4 predicted by the model is R eff = 7.3 ± 0.8 kpc, in good agreement with observations of local galaxies hosting the largest BHs (see Fig. 10). When we restrict to the innermost 2.5 kpc, we find a mean bulge stellar mass of (3.9 ± 0.2) × 10 10 M , much closer to the observation (see the arrow and black data point in Fig. 9). The same is true if we consider the mean gas mass within 2.5 kpc, which we predict to be M H 2 = (2.0 ± 0.9) × 10 10 M , that well reproduces the observed value (see Table 1).Indeed, the mean bulge effective radius at z = 6.4 predicted by the model is R eff = 7.3 ± 0.8 kpc, in good agreement with observations of local galaxies hosting the largest BHs (see Fig. 10).

        <p>Finally, the reference model predicts a mean dust mass at z = 6.4 of M dust = (3.6 ± 0.9) × 10 8 M , in good agreement with the value inferred from the FIR luminosity. This result has been obtained using the chemical evolution module, which includes dust processing in a two-phase ISM, that has been developed by Valiante et al. (2011, 2014) and de Bennassuti et al. (2014). Hence, consistent with previous findings (Valiante et al. 2011(Valiante et al. , 2014)), we find that the large dust mass that has enriched the ISM of the host galaxy is the result of a large stellar component, and that the apparent tension with the observed dynamical mass -the so-called stellar mass crisis -is at least partly due to the small spatial extent of the observations. We refer the interested readers to Valiante et al. (2014) for an extended discussion on this point.Finally, the reference model predicts a mean dust mass at z = 6.4 of M dust = (3.6 ± 0.9) × 10 8 M , in good agreement with the value inferred from the FIR luminosity.

        <p>The data-constrained model 
            <rs type="software">GAMETE/QSODUST</rs> allows us to explore a large number of formation histories of a given quasar, in the present case J1148 at z = 6.4, reproducing the observations of the quasar and its host galaxy. With the adjustable free parameters that we have selected, described in Table 2, the model reproduces the physical quantities listed in Table 1. Hence, the properties that we predict for the host galaxy of J1148 (SFR, dust mass, gas and stellar masses) are consistent with previous results obtained by Valiante et al. (2014Valiante et al. ( , 2016) ) for the same quasar.

        <p>With respect to Valiante et al. (2011Valiante et al. ( , 2014Valiante et al. ( , 2016)), the current version of

        <p>In particular, Valiante et al. (2016) find that the formation of a few (between 3 and 30 in the reference model) heavy BH seeds with masses M BH = 10 5 M enables the Eddington-limited growth of a SMBH by z = 6.4. This conclusion heavily depends on the occurrence -among the progenitors -of Lyman α cooling haloes where gas cooling is suppressed by the low-metallicity and strong Lyman-Werner background (Valiante et al. 2016). This 'head start' requires favourable conditions, which are easily erased by the joint interplay of chemical, radiative and mechanical feedback effects.In particular, Valiante et al.

        <p>Here we have explored the alternative scenario where the BHs can grow through a radiatively inefficient slim disc at super-Eddington rates.

        <p>As a consequence of the lower gas accretion rates, the average BH mass predicted by Valiante et al.

In this case, the average BH progenitor mass at z ∼ 15 is comparable in the two models. However, while in Valiante et al.

        <p>The progenitors of SMBHs at z &gt; 6 experience the strong form of coevolution defined by Kormendy &amp; Ho (2013), where galaxies affect BH growth by controlling BH feeding and merging, and BHs control galaxy properties via AGN feedback. In fact, while the small radiative efficiencies of super-Eddington accreting BHs are indispensable to limit the effects of AGN feedback (Lupi et al. 2016), at z &gt; 10 the BHs shine at a few Eddington luminosities with a noticeable effect on the cold gas content of their host galaxies. At lower z, an increasing fraction of BH progenitors accrete at sub-Eddington rates, but with larger radiative efficiencies. As a result of the larger BH mass and BH accretion rates, AGN-driven winds at z &lt; 10 power strong galaxy-scale outflows and suppress star formation, leading to the down-turn of the total SFR shown in Fig. 1.The progenitors of SMBHs at z &gt; 6 experience the strong form of coevolution defined by Kormendy &amp; Ho (2013), where galaxies affect BH growth by controlling BH feeding and merging, and BHs control galaxy properties via AGN feedback.

        <p>In Fig. 11, we show the average bolometric luminosity as a function of the average BH mass of SMBH progenitors for the reference model (black solid line) and for the model with Ṁaccr ≤ 20 ṀEdd (yellow solid line). The model predictions are compared with observations of SDSS J1148 (z = 6.4) and of the most distant quasar currently known, ULAS J1120 at z = 7.1 (Mortlock et al. 2011). The error bars on the bolometric luminosities account for the observational uncertainties on the flux at 1450 Å and on the bolometric corrections (Richards et al. 2006). Some reference values of the luminosity in units of the Eddington luminosity are shown by the diagonal dashed lines. The difference among the two models reflects the different BH accretion history: in the model with Ṁaccr ≤ 20 ṀEdd the first BH progenitors accrete at a lower rate, saving cold gas for the latest evolutionary phases. As a result, for BH progenitors with M BH 10 8 M , the mean luminosity predicted by the reference model is always super-Eddington (with L bol &gt; 10 L Edd when M BH 10 6 M ), whereas in the model with Ṁaccr ≤ 20 ṀEdd the mean luminosity is always 0.1 L Edd &lt; L bol &lt; L Edd . However, in the latest evolutionary phases, when M BH &gt; 10 8 M , this trend is reversed. Given the observational uncertainties and the large variability among different merger trees, the luminosity of J1148 is consistent with the model predictions. Interestingly, the data point of ULAS J1120 is also lying within the 1σ dispersion. Indeed, we find that ∼20 per cent of BH progenitors at z = 7.1 have luminosities and masses compatible with the observed values of ULAS J1120, indicating that this quasar may be one of the progenitors of SDSS J1148 at z = 6.4.In Fig. 11, we show the average bolometric luminosity as a function of the average BH mass of SMBH progenitors for the reference model (black solid line) and for the model with Ṁaccr ≤ 20 ṀEdd (yellow solid line).
