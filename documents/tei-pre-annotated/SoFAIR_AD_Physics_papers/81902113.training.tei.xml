        <p>Phases can be classified using cobordism theory. We test this proposal in the case of Fermionic SPT phases with Z 2 symmetry, where Z 2 is either time-reversal or an internal symmetry. We find that cobordism classification correctly describes all known Fermionic SPT phases in space dimension D ≤ 3 and also predicts that all such phases can be realized by free fermions.

        <p>Classification of Symmetry Protected Topological Phases has been a subject of intensive activity over the last few years. In the case of free fermions, a complete classification has been achieved in [1,2] using such ideas as Anderson localization and K-theory. In the case of bosonic systems, all SPT phases are intrinsically interacting, so one has to use entirely different methods.

        <p>Recently it has been proposed that cobordism theory can provide a complete classification of both bosonic and fermionic interacting SPT phases in all dimensions. This improves on the previous proposal that group cohomology classifies interacting bosonic SPT phases [6], while "group supercohomology" [7] classifies interacting fermionic SPT phases. For bosonic systems with time-reversal and U(1) symmetries the cobordism proposal has been tested in [9] and [10] respectively. Cobordism theory has been found to describe all known bosonic SPT phases with such symmetries in D ≤ 3. In this paper we test the proposal further by studying fermionic SPT phases with Z 2 symmetry.Recently it has been proposed that cobordism theory can provide a complete classification of both bosonic and fermionic interacting SPT phases in all dimensions.

        <p>The Z 2 symmetry in question can be either unitary or anti-unitary. In the former case we will assume that the symmetry is internal (does not act on space-time). In the latter JHEP12(2015)052 case it must reverse the direction of time, so we will call it time-reversal symmetry. In either case, the generator can square either to 1 or to (-1) F (fermion parity). Fermionic SPT phases with time-reversal symmetry are also known as topological superconductors, so in particular we describe a classification scheme for interacting topological superconductors.The Z 2 symmetry in question can be either unitary or anti-unitary.

        <p>Compared to the bosonic case, fermionic SPT phases present several related difficulties. First of all, one needs to decide what one means by a fermionic system. In a continuum Lorentz-invariant field theory, anti-commuting fields are also spinors with respect to the Lorentz group, but condensed matter systems are usually defined on a lattice and lack Lorentz invariance on the microscopic level. Thus the connection between spin and statistics need not hold. A related issue is that all fermionic systems have Z 2 symmetry called fermionic parity, usually denoted (-1) F . But all observables, including the Hamiltonian and the action, are bosonic, i.e. invariant under (-1) F . In a sense, every fermionic system has a Z 2 gauge symmetry, which means that the partition function must depend on a choice of a background Z 2 gauge field. It is tempting to identify this gauge field with the spin structure. However, it is not clear how a spin structure should be defined for a lattice system, except in the case of toroidal geometry. 1Instead of dealing with all these difficult questions, in this paper we take a more "phenomenological" approach: we make a few assumptions about the long-distance behavior of SPT phases which parallel those for bosonic SPT phases, and then test these assumptions by comparing the results in space-time dimensions d ≤ 4 with those available in the condensed matter literature. For various reasons, we limit our selves to the cases of no symmetry, time-reversal symmetry, and unitary Z 2 symmetry. Having found agreement with the known results, we make a conjecture about the classification of fermionic SPT phases with any symmetry group G.Compared to the bosonic case, fermionic SPT phases present several related difficulties.

        <p>Naively, it seems that T 2 = 1 should correspond to Pin + and T 2 = (-1) F should correspond to Pin -. Indeed, for Pin + the reflection of a coordinate axis acts on a fermion by an element r satisfying r2 = 1, while for Pin -it acts by r satisfying r2 = -1. However, one should take into account that the groups Pin ± are suitable for space-time of Euclidean signature. A reflection of a coordinate axis in Euclidean space is related to time-reversal by a Wick rotation. Let r be a reflection of the coordinate axis which is to be Wickrotated. The corresponding element of Pin ± acts on the fermions by a Dirac matrix γ d which satisfies γ 2 d = ±1. Wick rotation amounts to γ d → iγ d , hence Pin + corresponds to T 2 = (-1) F , while Pin -corresponds to T 2 = 1. This identification will be confirmed by the comparison with the results from the condensed matter literature.Naively, it seems that T 2 = 1 should correspond to Pin + and T 2 = (-1) F should correspond to Pin -.

        <p>The map (5.1) is an isomorphism [14]. From the physical viewpoint this means that away from the time-reversal domain walls the SPT is trivial and the boundary can be gapped, but on the domain walls there is a d = 2 fermionic SPT, the Majorana chain, so at locations where the domain walls meet the boundary there are Majorana zero modes. This is a special case of a construction of SPT phases discussed in the bosonic case in [15]. One starts with a system with symmetry G in a trivial phase, breaks the G symmetry, decorates the resulting domain walls with an SPT in 1 dimension lower, and finally proliferates the domain walls to restore the symmetry G. One can also do this with defects of higher codimension. A mathematical counterpart of this general construction is the Smith homomorphism discussed below.The map (5.1) is an isomorphism [14].

        <p>Eight copies of this fermionic SPT phase are equivalent to a bosonic SPT phase with time-reversal symmetry and the effective action w 4 1 (the bosonic SPT phase predicted by group cohomology, see [9]). To show this, we need to show 8η = w 4 1 for every Pin + 4-manifold. The space RP 4 generates the Pin + bordism group in 4 dimensions, so every JHEP12(2015)052 such manifold X is Pin + bordant to a disjoint union of k RP 4 s. Since η is a Pin + bordism invariant, it follows 8η(X) = 8kη(RP 4 ). Now w 4 1 is also a bordism invariant, so w 4 1 (X) = kw 4 1 (RP 4 ). Thus, we just need to show 8η(RP 4 ) = w 4 1 (RP 4 ). We know the left hand side is -1 since the bordism group is Z/16 and η generates the dual group, and it is simple to show w 4 1 (RP 4 ) = -1 as well. The equivalence of these two phases was also argued in [4]. Note that the eta-invariant cannot be written as an integral over a Lagrangian density L naturally associated to a lattice configuration on the underlying manifold M . In particular, if we have a covering map, we can pullback configurations to the cover.

        <p>From the physical viewpoint, the generator of Z 8 is the Majorana chain, which can be regarded as a time-reversal invariant system with T 2 = 1. Time-reversal protects the dangling Majorana zero modes from being gapped out in pairs. Instead, interactions can only gap out octets, yielding a Z 8 classification of phases labeled by the number of dangling modes [3]. Moreover, four copies of the Majorana chain with T 2 = 1 have states on the boundary on which T acts projectively, T 2 = -1 [3]; hence, four copies of the basic fermionic SPT phases with time-reversal T 2 = 1 are equivalent to the basic bosonic SPT phase in d = 2 with time-reversal symmetry.

        <p>One way to deal with this situation is to regard the fermions in d dimensions as dimensional reduction of fermions in d + n dimensions. Under such a reduction, the rotation group SO(n + d) decomposes into SO(d) × SO(n) (for the moment we assume that the d-dimensional theory does not have orientation-reversing symmetries, and accordingly the d-dimensional space-time is orientable). We imagine that the symmetry group G is embedded into SO(d), and denote by ξ the G-representation in which the n-vector of SO(n) transforms. We can think of ξ as a particular G-bundle over BG.

        <p>Let us start with a concrete example with a unitary Z 2 symmetry which squares to fermion parity. We consider in 1+1d a massless Dirac fermion ψ coupled to a massless real scalar φ by the Yukawa coupling φ ψψ. The Z 2 symmetry we consider is φ → -φ, ψ → γ 5 ψ, where γ 5 = iγ 0 γ 1 . We condense φ, making the domain wall infinitely heavy, and we consider the system on a line with boundary conditions φ → ∞ on the right and φ → -∞ on the left. Then there is a domain wall at some fixed position and a ψ zero mode bound to it. The point is to define the quantum mechanical theory of this zero mode, we need to pick a time direction. The ambient 2 dimensional space-time is oriented, so we can orient the domain wall if we can orient its normal direction. This orientation has to come from which side has the boundary condition φ → ∞ and which side has the boundary JHEP12(2015)052 condition φ → -∞. We choose some convention such as the φ → ∞ side is the positive side and thus orient the domain wall. However, if we now perform a global Z/2 symmetry transformation, it swaps the boundary conditions but not the ambient orientation, so it reverses the time direction on the domain wall.Let us start with a concrete example with a unitary Z 2 symmetry which squares to fermion parity.

To understand how the domain wall operators have different transformation properties, consider the operator ψγ x ψ, where γ x is the Clifford operator in the oriented normal to the domain wall. Because we need to use the oriented normal to define this operator in the 0+1d theory, we have γ x → -γ x under the Z 2 symmetry, so ψγ x ψ → -ψγ x ψ, contributing another copy of the sign representation.

In any decorated domain wall picture, the degrees of freedom bound to the wall are defined in a symmetry broken regime where the domain wall is infinitely tense. This choice of regime corresponds to the choice of σ. After the coupling is made in this regime, domain walls are again proliferated, restoring the G symmetry. For such a σ, in the phase where φ is condensed, the domain wall Y is Poincaré dual to the Z/2 gauge field σ(A) induced from the G gauge field A.

        <p>We have seen that cobordism correctly predicts the known classification of interacting fermionic SPT phases in D ≤ 3 with Z 2 symmetry, either unitary or anti-unitary. We find that for 0 ≤ D ≤ 3, all phases are realized by free fermions. However, in higher dimensions new phenomena occur. First of all, while the classification of free fermionic SPT phases with a fixed symmetry exhibits mod 8 periodicity in dimension [2], in the interacting case there is no periodicity. Second, the deviations from the free fermionic classification occur for high enough D, but the precise point depends on the symmetry group. For example, for SPT phases with time-reversal symmetry T , T 2 = (-1) F , deviations start at D = 3. For SPT phases with no symmetry beyond (-1) F deviations start at D = 6. (In D = 6 the free fermionic classification predicts Z, but in the interacting case it is Z × Z because there are two different gravitational Chern-Simons terms possible based on the Pontryagin numbers p 2 1 and p 2 , respectively.) Starting in D = 7 one has as well all the bordism invariants formed from the Stiefel-Whitney numbers (modulo w 1 and w 2 ). Unlike the gravitational Chern-Simons terms, these invariants are torsion. Third, while in low dimensions the effect of interactions is to truncate the free fermionic classification, in high enough dimension inherently interacting fermionic SPT phases appear. For example, in D = 7 free fermionic SPT phases with time-reversal symmetry T , T 2 = (-1) F , are classified by Z, while the cobordism approach predicts Z 2 × Z 32 . The latter group is not a quotient of the former, so truncation alone cannot explain the discrepancy. The most likely interpretation is that Z 32 is a truncation of Z, while the Z 2 factor corresponds to an inherently interacting fermionic SPT phase.

        <p>integer multiple of 16. This determines the quantization of the thermal Hall conductivity for d = 3 bosonic SPTs with time-reversal symmetry. Now suppose M is given a spin structure. We can exploit it to define exp(iS grav ) for arbitrary integral k. We merely require the spin structure to extend to X. It is always possible to find such an X, since Ω Spin 3 (pt) = 0. The difference between S X grav (ω) and S X ′ grav (ω) is again given by (A.1). Since now X ′ ∪ X is a closed spin 4-manifold, we can appeal to the Rohlin theorem which says that the signature of a closed spin 4-manifold is divisible by 16, and conclude that exp(iS grav (ω)) is well-defined if k is integral. This determines the quantization of the thermal Hall conductivity for d = 3 fermionic SPTs with time-reversal symmetry. Note that in the fermionic case the quantum of conductivity is 16 times smaller than in the bosonic case.integer multiple of 16.
