        <p>The effective Lagrangian expansion provides a framework to study effects of new physics at the electroweak scale. To make full use of LHC data in constraining higher-dimensional operators we need to include both the Higgs and the electroweak gauge sector in our study. We first present an analysis of the relevant di-boson production LHC results to update constraints on triple gauge boson couplings. Our bounds are several times stronger than those obtained from LEP data. Next, we show how in combination with Higgs measurements the triple gauge vertices lead to a significant improvement in the entire set of operators, including operators describing Higgs couplings.The effective Lagrangian expansion provides a framework to study effects of new physics at the electroweak scale.

        <p>The direct exploration of the electroweak symmetry breaking sector started with the discovery of a light narrow Higgs boson [1][2][3] in 2012 [4,5] -a triumph of particle physics. Already the LHC Run I allowed ATLAS and CMS to perform a large number of tests of the nature of the observed resonance, but no significant deviations from the Standard Model properties were observed for example in the Higgs production and decay rates [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23]. On the other hand, it is important to remind ourselves that the current constraints are still at a precision level for which no significant deviations would be expected in weakly interacting models of new physics [24].The direct exploration of the electroweak symmetry breaking sector started with the discovery of a light narrow Higgs boson [1][2][3] in 2012 [4,5] -a triumph of particle physics.

        <p>If we accept the Standard Model assumption that the Higgs particle is closely related to the massive gauge bosons, the Higgs results from Run I should be combined with corresponding precision measurements in the electroweak sector. During Run I the LHC collaborations have also collected meaningful event samples probing electroweak gauge boson pair production. They contain information on the structure of the triple gauge boson vertices (TGV)s and allow for complementary tests of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism.If we accept the Standard Model assumption that the Higgs particle is closely related to the massive gauge bosons, the Higgs results from Run I should be combined with corresponding precision measurements in the electroweak sector.

        <p>The eventual observation of departures of Higgs or gauge boson couplings from their SM predictions can give hints of physics beyond the Standard Model, affecting the electroweak sector and characterized by a new energy scale Λ. One way of parametrizing low-energy effects of SM extensions is by means of an effective Lagrangian [25][26][27], which only depends on the low-energy particle content and symmetries. This bottom-up approach has the advantage of minimizing the amount of theoretical hypothesis when studying deviations from the SM predictions. Here, we assume that the observed Higgs-like state belongs JHEP07(2016)152 to a light electroweak doublet and that the SU(2) L ⊗U(1) Y symmetry is linearly realized in the effective theory [28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40]. Without lepton number violation, the lowest order operators which can be built are of dimension six. The coefficients of these dimension-six operators parametrize our ignorance of the new physics effects and have to be determined using all available data.The eventual observation of departures of Higgs or gauge boson couplings from their SM predictions can give hints of physics beyond the Standard Model, affecting the electroweak sector and characterized by a new energy scale Λ.

        <p>One result of this effective theory approach is that modified Higgs couplings to weak bosons are related to triple gauge boson vertices in a model independent fashion. This allows us to use Higgs data not only to constrain TGVs [41], but also to use TGV data to test the strengths and structures of Higgs couplings. Usually, such combined analyses rely on LEP results for the TGVs [42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49], the only exception being refs. [22,23]. The reason is that LEP provided the strongest constraints on TGVs until now. However, during the LHC Run I both ATLAS and CMS have collected a substantial amount of data on diboson searches. It contains information on TGVs, whose relevance has not been addressed quantitatively. We fill this void with the first global analysis of the complete di-boson and Higgs data from the LHC Run I.One result of this effective theory approach is that modified Higgs couplings to weak bosons are related to triple gauge boson vertices in a model independent fashion.

We follow the definition of the relevant operator basis for LHC Higgs and TGV physics described in detail in refs. [42,43]. We start by restricting the initial set to P and C-even operators. We then use the equations of motion to rotate to a basis where there are no blind directions linked to electroweak precision data. In practice, we can neglect all operators contributing to electroweak precision observables at tree level; they are strongly constrained by the several low energy measurements, rendering them irrelevant for current Higgs and TGV studies at JHEP07(2016)152 the LHC. We then neglect all operators that cannot be studied at the LHC yet, because they only contribute to interactions we are not sensitive to. This includes the HHH vertex or the Higgs interactions with light-generation fermions.

        <p>Directly from the relevant experimental figure we read off the background expectation (defined as all SM processes except for the di-boson production channels), the expected contribution from W V production in the Standard Model and the measured event number bin by bin. The background rates we use directly from the experimental analysis, without any need to modify them. Next, we simulate SM W V production in the fiducial region using

We compare these results to the experimental predictions, defining a bin-by-bin correction factor. It accounts for phase-space dependent corrections either from detector effects or from higher order corrections [67][68][69][70][71][72].

We first construct Markov chains in the three-dimensional model space of f W , f B and f W W W . Then we build the likelihood function for the given data set and determine the part of parameter space allowed at a given CL. In the construction of the likelihood we always include Poisson-shaped statistical uncertainties for event numbers, a Gaussian-shaped experimental systematic uncertainty and a flat theory uncertainty for the signal. As experimental systematics we include the biggest sources of uncertainties for a given experiment, this includes the luminosity estimate, detector and lepton reconstruction/isolation uncertainties, and some additional uncertainty for the background normalization and/or shape, all discussed in the appendix. For the theoretical uncertainty we allow for a variation of 5% for W W , 4% for W Z and 4% for W V -semileptonic channels.

In addition to each individual ATLAS and CMS channel we give the combined constraints from all eight channels. For the combination, we find a global minimum at a Gauss-equivalent χ 2 ≈ -2 log L = 48.3 for a total of 65 data points, while χ 2 ≈ -2 log L = 49.7 for the Standard Model. The regions allowed by the different searches are mutually compatible and show no significant preference for a deviation from the Standard Model. Moreover, the structure of the parameter space is simple enough that none of the two-dimensional planes significantly change if instead of a profile likelihood we show a slice where the third Wilson coefficient is zero.In figure 1 we show the results of our pure TGV analysis in terms of the Wilson coefficients defined in eq.

        <p>In the final step of our effective field theory analysis, we have to combine the LHC Run I results on TGVs and Higgs couplings. The main reason is that O W and O B contribute to anomalous Higgs interactions and the triple gauge boson interactions at the same time [41][42][43]78]. Consequently, a study of the underlying Wilson coefficients should include both sets of experimental analyses. Furthermore, the combination of the two can be used to test the nature of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism [44].In the final step of our effective field theory analysis, we have to combine the LHC Run I results on TGVs and Higgs couplings.

        <p>For the sake of comparison we start with a brief summary of the global analysis of the LHC Run I Higgs data presented in refs. [6,7], where constraints on the dimension-six Wilson coefficients in eq. ( 2.3) are derived from Higgs measurements alone. That data consists of 159 observables for event rates, plus 14 additional measurements related to kinematics. This kinematic information is crucial to disentangle the strongly correlated effects of non-SM Lorentz structures generated by O W W , O BB , O W , and O B . This way, the kinematic distributions significantly improve the global Higgs fit.For the sake of comparison we start with a brief summary of the global analysis of the LHC Run I Higgs data presented in refs.

        <p>As an illustration, we show three of the relevant two-dimensional profile likelihoods from the pure Higgs analysis including kinematic distributions in the first row of figure 3. In the upper-left panel we see a strong correlation between O W W and O BB , even after including the kinematic distributions. This is due to both operators contributing to the decay rate Hγγ. Without kinematic information the wide pattern in the upper left part simply extends to the lower right part [6,7].

This can be easily achieved in the SFitter framework described in section 3 and refs. [6,7].

        <p>In table 2 and figure 4 we show the limits on individual Wilson coefficients for each of the dimension-six operators included in the analysis, eq. (2.3). In the upper panels of figure 4 and in the table we clearly see secondary solutions due to sign flips in the individual Yukawa and Hgg couplings. In the lower panels of figure 4 we show only the solutions for parameter space with SM signs of the Yukawa couplings, and focusing on the f GG containing the SM point, extending our set of simplifications discussed in section 2. In both cases we see that the limits including di-boson channels are significantly improved. This improvement is driven by the highest sensitivity we have derived on f B and f W , which feeds through to the remaining operators because of the existing correlations. Including the di-boson data removes all secondary solutions from non-trivial parameter correlations or strong non-Gaussian effects. The additional Wilson coefficient f W W W is among the best-measured dimension-six modification in the gauge-Higgs sector studied here.In table 2 and figure 4 we show the limits on individual Wilson coefficients for each of the dimension-six operators included in the analysis, eq.

        <p>One caveat applies to these results the same way it applies to the Higgs analyses alone [6,7,[79][80][81][82][83][84][85]. 1 If we consider the dimension-six Lagrangian of eq.

Com-1 For a comprehensive discussion on the validity of truncated effective Lagrangians see the upcoming WG2 report of the Higgs Cross section Working Group as well as [84,85]. puting the effects of dimension-eight operators appears to be one way of estimating the theoretical uncertainties which enter the translation of our dimension-six results into actual models. However, detailed studies in the Higgs sector [79][80][81][82][83][84][85] indicate that individual dimension-eight contributions are not necessarily a good measure for these uncertainties. Therefore, the effective theory interpretation of the results on the truncated dimension-six Lagrangian shown in figure 4 should be done with care. We finally remark that the global analysis of Higgs and TGV searches presented here relies on the common contribution of f W and f B to both sets of interactions. As described at the end of section 2, this is a consequence of the assumption that the electroweak symmetry breaking is linearly realized with the Higgs boson being part of a doublet of SU(2) L . In the non-linear scenario, deviations on the TGVs could be in general decorrelated from deviations on the Higgs interactions. If such deviations are observed, the measurement of these correlation patterns could be ultimately linked to the nature of the Higgs boson as discussed in detail in [44,54].One caveat applies to these results the same way it applies to the Higgs analyses alone [6,7,[79][80][81][82][83][84][85]. 1 If we consider the dimension-six Lagrangian of eq.

        <p>For triple gauge-boson data we give the first combination of all the di-boson production channels at LHC Run I, relevant to constrain the three dimension-six operators contributing. The current bounds derived in section 3 are a factor 3-6 more precise than the corresponding LEP bounds. Since LHC Run I is sensitive to the TGVs in a diverse set of channels, the allowed parameter ranges for the couplings are only weakly correlated; see eq. (3.4). In the future, we expect sizeable progress in particular for channels with semi-leptonic decays of weak-boson pairs.For triple gauge-boson data we give the first combination of all the di-boson production channels at LHC Run I, relevant to constrain the three dimension-six operators contributing.

While in the Higgs analysis alone we are left with strong correlations between the different Wilson coefficients -leading to large non-Gaussian structures in the correlated likelihood -secondary solutions in the combined analysis are exclusively due to the signs of the Yukawa couplings. Furthermore, the use of the Higgs data leads to an improvement on the determination of TGVs, specially f B .

        <p>where ∆φ is the azimuthal angle between the missing transverse momentum vector and the nearest lepton. We use the SM W W events rates in the signal region to tune our event generation, both in terms of the total rate and in the most relevant kinematic distribution. For the latter, we identify the kinematic distribution which is most sensitive to anomalous TGVs and which we will later include in our SFitter analysis. Of the variables and ranges shown in the ATLAS note, the leading p T, has the largest potential because it tracks the momentum flow through the anomalous vertex best [84][85][86]. This means that our event generation has to reproduce figure 11 in ref. [57]. To ensure this, we introduce a bin-by-bin correction factor to account for differences in the selection procedure because of detector effects as well as higher order corrections to the cross section prediction [67][68][69][70][71][72].where ∆φ is the azimuthal angle between the missing transverse momentum vector and the nearest lepton.
