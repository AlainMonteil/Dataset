        <p>Finding and characterising the first galaxies that illuminated the early Universe at cosmic dawn is pivotal to understand the physical conditions and the processes that led to the formation of the first stars. In the first few months of operations, imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has been used to identify tens of candidates of galaxies at redshift (z) greater than 10 less than 450 million years after the Big Bang. However, none of such candidates has yet been confirmed spectroscopically, leaving open the possibility that they are actually low-redshift interlopers. Here we present spectroscopic confirmation and analysis of four galaxies unambiguously detected at redshift 10.3≤z≤13.2, previously selected from NIRCam imaging. The spectra reveal that these primeval galaxies are metal poor, have masses between of order ~10 7 -10 8 solar masses, and young ages. The damping wings that shape the continuum close to the Lyman edge provide the first constraints on neutral Hydrogen fraction of the intergalactic medium to be obtained from normal star-forming galaxies. These findings demonstrate the rapid emergence of the first generations of galaxies at cosmic dawn.Finding and characterising the first galaxies that illuminated the early Universe at cosmic dawn is pivotal to understand the physical conditions and the processes that led to the formation of the first stars.

        <p>The opening act of galaxy formation in the first billion years after the Big Bang sets in motion the physics of galaxy formation and evolution that shapes galaxy properties across cosmic time. Galaxies forming at these times may be the seeds of the much more massive and mature galaxies in the local Universe. Theoretical models and cosmological simulations differ greatly in their predictions of the physical properties and abundance of the first galaxies. The theoretical pictures depend strongly on assumptions about the physical processes at play in the early universe, such as: gas cooling and fragmentation in primordial clouds; the feedback effects from first stars and supernova explosions that subsequently enrich the surrounding medium; and early merging, assembly and accretion histories of galaxies [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] . The abundance and mass distribution of the first galaxies are also tightly connected to early structure formation. Therefore, the detection and characterisation of these early galaxies is key to test different models and theories.The opening act of galaxy formation in the first billion years after the Big Bang sets in motion the physics of galaxy formation and evolution that shapes galaxy properties across cosmic time.

        <p>High-redshift galaxies often have distinctive spectra in the ultraviolet, in which the blue spectrum produced by hot massive stars is abruptly cut off below the Lyman-limit at 912Å (rest-frame) by the absorption of the light by neutral Hydrogen in stellar atmospheres, interstellar gas and the intergalactic medium (IGM). At the highest redshifts (z ≳ 6), the intergalactic neutral Hydrogen leads to almost complete absorption at wavelengths below Lyα at 1216Å. Observationally, this translates to a 'dropout', i.e., a lack of detection in bands blue-ward of (1 + z) × 1216 Å but flux red-ward of the same wavelength [8][9][10] . However, galaxies with peculiar properties may mimic high-redshift galaxies [e.g., a combination of dust reddening and nebular lines or contribution by an active galactic nucleus as in ref 11]. Therefore, spectroscopic observations are the only method to determine accurate redshifts, either via the detection of the (redshifted) nebular lines 12 , or via the unambiguous detection of the sharp continuum cutoff at (1 + z) × 1216 Å. The highest redshift spectroscopically confirmed galaxy prior to these observations is that of GN-z11 at z=10.957 13,14 .High-redshift galaxies often have distinctive spectra in the ultraviolet, in which the blue spectrum produced by hot massive stars is abruptly cut off below the Lyman-limit at 912Å (rest-frame) by the absorption of the light by neutral Hydrogen in stellar atmospheres, interstellar gas and the intergalactic medium (IGM).

        <p>Identification and spectroscopic characterisation of galaxies in the early Universe is one of the primary goals for which JWST was designed. The first few months of JWST imaging have already yielded a large number of candidate galaxies at z &gt; 10 [15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22] . However, the redshift estimates of these candidates have so far been based on their broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and it cannot be ruled out that such candidates are actually lower redshift galaxies 11 , especially in regions where accompanying Hubble space telescope imaging is relatively shallow. With the large number of z&gt;10 candidates identified in the first months of JWST science observations from NIRCam photometry, some initial findings suggest very little evolution of the UV luminosity function above z&gt;10 18,23 (though this is not seen in ref 15). This would require early galaxies to display different physics, for example a stellar initial mass function more top-heavy than in lower-redshift galaxies 18 . Yet ref. 24 illustrates how large a difference in UV luminosity density evolution is measured when considering only the robust candidates. This demonstrates the firm need for spectroscopic observations to follow up photometric candidates. Additionally, spectra provide us with constraints on the stellar and gas properties of the objects beyond what photometry can provide.Identification and spectroscopic characterisation of galaxies in the early Universe is one of the primary goals for which JWST was designed.

        <p>We report here the deepest spectroscopic observations to date with NIRSpec 25 on JWST, which provide confirmation of four candidates at z&gt;10 and extensive characterisation of their physical properties. These candidates were photometrically identified as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), a joint guaranteed time project of the NIRCam and NIRSpec instrument teams. The identification and photometric study of these candidates, based on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and NIRCam data 26 , is described in a companion paper 27 . We specifically focus here on a pointing in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (in the GOODS-South area), in which we have taken multi-object spectroscopy of 253 galaxies observed simultaneously with NIRSpec's configurable array of microshutters. We report here on observations taken with the prism spectral configuration (spectral range 0.6-5.3μm, resolving power R ∼ 100) with exposure times ranging from 9.3 to 28 hours (see Methods for details on the observing strategy).We report here the deepest spectroscopic observations to date with NIRSpec 25 on JWST, which provide confirmation of four candidates at z&gt;10 and extensive characterisation of their physical properties.

        <p>The focus of this paper is on four of these spectroscopic targets. Two of these are z &gt; 12 galaxy candidates selected from NIRCam imaging 27 , based on a clear lack of F150W flux. Two others are z &gt; 10 candidates based on their HST IR photometry. We defer to a future publication to describe the other targets in this deep pointing.

        <p>We tested whether the observed breaks might be produced by the Balmer (or 4000Å) break in the stellar continuum associated with evolved stellar populations in galaxies at z ∼ 3, and we show that this possibility is excluded with high confidence (see Methods section and model Balmer Break strength in Extended Data Figure 1). Other, more extreme low redshift solutions are still able to explain the photometry of our objects. In particular, fitting with active-galactic-nuclei narrow-line emission (not often included when performing photometric redshifts) provides intermediate redshift solutions at z~3-3.5, as shown in the Methods section. In these solutions the strong photometric break is produced by strong line emission in certain filters. We can firmly rule out these low-redshift solutions with our spectra, which demonstrates that the photometric fluxes arise from continuum emission, rather than strong emission lines with weak underlying continuum. Although this low redshift solution may appear extreme, we emphasise that JWST is pushing into a new regime of exploration, where yet unexplored families of low-redshift contaminants may be uncovered.

        <p>One of the galaxies, JADES-GS-z11-0, has been debated in the literature. It was first identified in ref. 29 as a potential z ∼ 10 galaxy. In the UDF12 survey 30,31 , deep Hubble imaging revealed the object drops out in JH140 band imaging. This left two possibilities, either the source was at very high redshift [z ∼ 11.9 30 ], or was low redshift, with a high-equivalent-width emission line producing the flux in the Hubble H160 image. In fact, ref. 32 found indication of a possible emission line in spectroscopic follow-up supporting the latter explanation. We do not confirm this line emission in our NIRSpec spectroscopy, and the NIRCam imaging present in ref. 27 shows that the continuum emission extends to longer wavelengths, which is consistent with the spectrum shown here [see also ref. 23]. Therefore, this galaxy is indeed at high redshift, and not a low-redshift contaminant.One of the galaxies, JADES-GS-z11-0, has been debated in the literature.

        <p>The continua appear mostly featureless, with the possible exceptions of JADES-GS-z10-0, which shows a tentative emission line at ∼ 1.44 μm which may indicate Lyα emission, and JADES-GS-z12-0, which shows another tentative feature at ∼ 5.23 μm, which could be interpreted as [Ne III]λ3869 emission at z = 12.52. However, both features are only marginally detected, and we are still assessing whether these very faint and localized features are astrophysical. They will be assessed and explored more in detail in forthcoming papers and not discussed further here. Remarkably, the lack of strong line detections turns out to be what makes these spectra particularly interesting as it provides vital information over and above the spectroscopic redshift determination, and what could be derived from photometry alone 27 .The continua appear mostly featureless, with the possible exceptions of JADES-GS-z10-0, which shows a tentative emission line at ∼ 1.44 μm which may indicate Lyα emission, and JADES-GS-z12-0, which shows another tentative feature at ∼ 5.23 μm, which could be interpreted as [Ne III]λ3869 emission at z = 12.52.

        <p>We can gain further insight into the physical properties of these galaxies through spectral fitting with the BEAGLE [BayEsian Analysis of GaLaxy sEds 37 ] tool with setup described in Extended Data Table 2, adopting a constant star formation history (SFH) to probe the young stellar populations within them (see Methods section 3 for more details). These fits are illustrated in Extended Data Figures 2345. We find low metallicities, with two galaxies, JADES-GS-z10-0 and JADES-GS-z11-0, showing strong constraints of just a few percent of solar. At higher metallicities we would expect a significant detection of [OII]λλ3726,3729.

        <p>It is of interest to investigate whether the lack of detectable line emission requires a large escape fraction of ionising photons and find no strong dependence of the physical properties, nor strong constraints on the escape fraction. We do note, however, that JADES-GS-z11-0 has a solution with low ages and high escape fraction with marginally higher metallicity, though the upper 1σ limit is still ∼ 5% solar metallicity (see Extended Data Table 3). In fact, at these extremely low metallicities, the rest-frame UV emission lines might be significantly weaker than those sometimes found in lower redshift samples with somewhat higher metallicities around ∼ 10% solar. Another important factor is the age of the stellar populations, as strong UV emission lines have primarily been observed in galaxies with UV light dominated by very young stellar populations [≲ 10 million years 33 ].It is of interest to investigate whether the lack of detectable line emission requires a large escape fraction of ionising photons and find no strong dependence of the physical properties, nor strong constraints on the escape fraction.

        <p>If ionising radiation does escape from galaxies, it will reionize neutral Hydrogen in the surrounding gas. We find that the breaks in the spectra presented in Fig. 1 are significantly less abrupt than those seen in galaxies at lower redshifts in our spectroscopic data set, and are consistent with a softening of the break by the Lyα damping wing caused by a largely neutral IGM, suggesting that these galaxies are yet to ionize large bubbles in their near vicinity. The redshift is sensitive to the existence and form of this damping wing, and we report the best-fit redshift for a fully neutral inter-galactic medium (xHI = 1, where xHI is the fraction of neutral Hydrogen) in Table 1. For the object with the highest S/N in the Lyα break region (JADES-GS-z11-0), we investigate the constraints we can place on the neutral Hydrogen fraction by first fixing the best-fit model for the stellar population. We then run BEAGLE varying only redshift and xHI. The resulting fit to the spectral break, and the derived constraints are shown in Figure 3. The 2D posterior probability distribution function reported in the right-hand panel indicates that the constraints on xHI are fairly weak, suggesting xHI&gt;0.5 from the 1σ credible interval, though this is sensitive to exact redshift of the source (e.g. Extended Data Figure 6).

        <p>To date the only constraints on the evolution of xHI from damping wings is in luminous quasars at 6 &lt; z &lt; 7.5. Damping wings are rarely observed at z &lt; 7, but become more common in the small sample of known z &gt; 7 quasars, consistent with xHI ∼ 0.5 at z = 7.3 44 . Whilst star-forming galaxies are less luminous than quasars, they have several advantages in being plentiful at redshifts 7 to 9 and providing an independent test of neutrality at higher redshifts. Finally, galaxies do not exhibit broad Lyα and N vλ1240 emission, which may simplify the damping wing modelling 45 .

        <p>Flux-calibrated 2D spectra and 1D spectral extractions have been produced using pipelines developed by the ESA NIRSpec Science Operations Team (SOT) and the NIRSpec GTO Team. We briefly outline here the main steps, while a more detailed description will be presented in a forthcoming NIRSpec/GTO collaboration paper. Most of the processing steps in the pipelines adopt the same algorithms as included in the official STScI pipeline used to generate the MAST archive products [see Fig. 11 and section 4.3 of ref 46]. Initially, we processed the MOS raw data (i.e, level 1a data from the MAST archive) with the ramp-toslope pipeline which estimates the count rate per pixel by using all unsaturated groups in the ramp. Ramp jumps due to cosmic rays are detected and rejected on the basis of the slope of the individual ramps. The ramp-to-slope pipeline also includes the following steps: saturation detection and flagging, master bias subtraction, reference pixel subtraction, linearity correction, dark subtraction, snowball artifact detection and correction, and count rate estimation [for more details see refs. 47-49]. All the count-rate images were then processed using a data reduction pipeline including ESA NIRSpec SOT codes and NIRSpec GTO algorithms. The pipeline has 11 main steps: 1) identification of non-target galaxies intercepting the open shutters; 2) pixel-level background subtraction by combining the three nod exposures (excluding nods contaminated by non-target sources); 3) extraction of sub-images containing the spectral trace of each target and wavelength and spatial coordinate assignments to each pixel in the 2D maps; 4) pixel-to-pixel flat-field correction; 5) spectrograph optics and dispersers correction; 6) absolute flux calibration; 7) slitlosses correction; 8) rectification of the spectral trace; 9) extraction of 1D spectra; 10) combination of 1D spectra generated from each integration, nod, and pointing; 11) combination of 2D maps. The data processing workflow thus returns both a combined 1D and 2D spectrum for each target. We stress however that the combined 1D spectra are not extracted from the combined 2D maps, but are the result of a weighted average of 1D spectra from all integrations. This process allowed us to mask the bad pixels indicated on the quality flags and to reject outlier pixels. Finally, we adopted an irregular wavelength grid for the 1D and 2D spectra to avoid oversampling of the line spread function at short wavelengths (λ ∼ 1 μm).Flux-calibrated 2D spectra and 1D spectral extractions have been produced using pipelines developed by the ESA NIRSpec Science Operations Team (SOT) and the NIRSpec GTO Team.

For each target we extracted the 1D spectra from two different apertures. One aperture was as large as the shutter size to recover all emission of the galaxy, while the second extraction was performed in an aperture of 3-pixels height (with NIRSpec spatial pixel scale of 0.1"/pixel) to maximise the signal-to-noise ratio of the final spectra.Given the compact size of our z &gt; 10 targets, we computed and applied slit-loss corrections, modelling galaxies as point-like sources, but taking into account the relative intra-shutter position of each source (each microshutter has an illuminated area of 0.2"×0.46").

        <p>While the observed spectral breaks in the four objects presented here are fully consistent with expectations for high-redshift galaxies, it is important to test the possibility that the observed breaks may be Balmer breaks at lower redshift. We test this using empirical spectral indices. We adapt the classical Balmer-break index definition 50 and define the break amplitude as the ratio of fλ in the rest-frame range 3751 A] -4198 A] to that in the range 3145 A] -3563 A] . This definition expands the spectral windows to include more spectral pixels (15-19 depending on redshift) and increase the signal-to-noise on the index. These measurements are taken from spectra extracted from 3 pixels, maximising the S/N. The effect of wavelength-dependent extraction losses should be minimal for this measurement. When the lower spectral range yields a negative flux, we adopt the 2σ upper flux limit instead. Additionally, to account for the noisy measurement of the (physically) positive-definite flux in the longer wavelength band, we subtract 1σ from the measured flux. This is a conservative upper limit which we quote as a 2σ upper limit in Table 1.While the observed spectral breaks in the four objects presented here are fully consistent with expectations for high-redshift galaxies, it is important to test the possibility that the observed breaks may be Balmer breaks at lower redshift.

The maximum value reached within 10 Gyr is less than 2.0. We report 2σ lower limits on the value of this index for each of our four targets in Table 1. The smallest measured break strength is measured for GS-z10-0, with a 2σ lower limit of 2.04, which is higher than the maximum reached by the single stellar populations. Again, this suggests that the Balmer break solution is unlikely, although by a smaller margin than for the other three targets.In Extended Data Figure 1 we show the evolution of the modified Balmer break index with age for single stellar population models at four different metallicities from 0.01Z⊙ to 1Z⊙.

        <p>We note that incorrect background subtraction due to contamination of background shutters by neighbouring galaxies or the source itself can lead to a biased measurement of the break strength.

        <p>Apart from the possible detections of Lyα in JADES-GS-z10-0 and [Ne III]λ3869 in JADES-GS-z12-0 (which we will assess in future work), visual inspection of the 1D and 2D spectra did not show the presence of any emission lines above the level of the noise in any of the four targets. We derive upper limits to emission-line fluxes and equivalent widths using the error spectrum output from the data reduction pipeline for the optimised S/N spectra extracted over 3 pixels. Our reduced spectra have an irregular wavelength grid, and we estimate that the line spread function of these PRISM spectra results in unresolved emission lines with FWHM of approximately 2-3 spectral pixels. Thus, to calculate emissionline limits, for the 3 spectral pixels centred on the expected centroid of the emission line at the calculated redshift, we sum the pixel errors in quadrature and multiply the result by the wavelength interval between pixels. This results in 1σ upper limits on line fluxes, which we convert into equivalent-width limits by fitting a simple polynomial to the continuum of each object to get the level on the continuum and associated uncertainty.

        <p>We note that MUV measured from the spectrum alone is somewhat fainter and the β somewhat redder for JADES-GS-z12-0 than that measured from NIRCam data in the companion paper 27 . We attribute this to residual slit losses missed by our standard correction, since this object is quite close to the edge of the shutter. This highlights the importance of the complementarity between NIRSpec spectroscopy and NIRCam photometry. The difference is starker for JADES-GS-z13-0, which is very close to the edge of the shutter, and for which we report instead MUV and β derived from SED modelling including the NIRCam photometry (see Section 3). The comparison with the measurements in ref. 27 shows good agreement for JADES-GS-z10-0 and JADES-GS-z11-0, which validates the spectroscopic flux calibration in the case where the adoption of point-source path losses is a good approximation.We note that MUV measured from the spectrum alone is somewhat fainter and the β somewhat redder for JADES-GS-z12-0 than that measured from NIRCam data in the companion paper 27 .

        <p>We perform full spectral fitting to the R100 spectra using the BEAGLE code 37 . In general, firm constraints on metallicities (both nebular and stellar) and gas parameters require the spectroscopic detection of emission and absorption lines, while constraints on total stellar masses and star-formation rates generally require NIRCam photometry, since NIRSpec MSA spectra are so prone to slit losses. As these objects are so small [r 1/2 ≃ 50 -165 pc, with on-sky sizes of θ 1/2 ≃ 0.015-0.04" 27] we use pre-calculated point-source slit-loss corrections. Therefore, in this paper we present an entirely independent analysis to that in ref. 27, both in datasets used (except for the fits to JADES-GS-z13-0 where we employ the NIRCam photometry, see later in this section for details), in SED codes and parameterizations.

        <p>This requires modelling of the wavelength-dependent line-spread function (LSF). We fit Gaussian profiles to emission lines in R100 spectra taken within this deep pointing and compare their widths as a function of wavelength to the dispersion curves provided by STScI (https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-nearinfrared-spectrograph/nirspec-instrumentation/ nirspec-dispersers-and-filters). We find that the supplied dispersion curves multiplied by a factor of 0.7 provide a reasonable representation of the measured wavelength-dependent LSF. We use spectra extracted over the full micro-shutter aperture to minimise the effects of wavelength dependent losses, since the size of the shutter is more than twice the width of the PSF at 5μm. JADES-GS-z13-0, however, is just at the edge of the shutter and the 2D spectrum shows that it is clearly truncated. Therefore, to provide information of the aperture losses for this target, we use a 3-pixel extraction box to maximise S/N and simultaneously fit to the NIRCam aperture photometry 27 . We multiply the shape of the spectrum by a second-order polynomial, sampling over the polynomial coefficients in the fit. This essentially allows the NIRCam photometry to set the normalisation of the spectrum while also correcting wavelength-dependent slit-losses in the spectral calibration. The fits and associated parameter constraints are shown in Extended Data Figures 23. We note that SED fitting is performed in the companion paper 27 , yet there they fit only to NIRCam photometry, fixing the redshift to the spectroscopic redshift.

        <p>Since the constraints on the stellar metallicity are driven by the lack of strong emission lines, we tested whether recent cessation of star formation would significantly change the constraints. We therefore tested a constant star formation history where the SFR of the recent 10 Myr was allowed to vary independently (and decrease). We find that the star-formation rate, Ψ, is fairly unconstrained with low posterior median values, meaning recent cessation is consistent with the data. However, we still infer very low metallicities in JADES-GS-z10-0 and JADES-GS-z11-0 (the two with highest S/N spectra). For the two lower S/N spectra (JADES-GS-z12-0 and JADES-GS-z13-0), Z, τˆv and Ψ are very poorly constrained when this extra free parameter is included.

        <p>In fitting the damping wing to JADES-GS-z11-0, we found a bimodality in the redshift solution, with a higher redshift solution being consistent with a fully ionised IGM. We find that the final solution is quite sensitive to the adopted intrinsic underlying spectrum. We find solutions at higher redshifts provide poorer fits to the break region itself (shown in Extended Data Fig 6 for completeness). The difference between fits was based on the definition of 'best fit' to the full spectrum used to fix physical parameters (either the minimum chi-2 solution, Fig. 3, or the maximum a-posteriori probability solution shown here), while if we do not model Lyman-alpha emission in the fitting, we find a bimodal solution with redshift.In fitting the damping wing to JADES-GS-z11-0, we found a bimodality in the redshift solution, with a higher redshift solution being consistent with a fully ionised IGM.
