        <p>Mergers of binary black holes on eccentric orbits are among the targets for second-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. These sources may commonly form in galactic nuclei due to gravitational-wave emission during close flyby events of single objects. We determine the distributions of initial orbital parameters for a population of these gravitational-wave sources. Our results show that the initial dimensionless pericenter distance systematically decreases with the binary component masses and the mass of the central supermassive black hole, and its distribution depends sensitively on the highest possible black hole mass in the nuclear star cluster. For a multi-mass black hole population with masses between 5 M ⊙ and 80 M ⊙ , we find that between ∼ 43 -69% (68 -94%) of 30 M ⊙ -30 M ⊙ (10 M ⊙ -10 M ⊙ ) sources have an eccentricity greater than 0.1 when the gravitational-wave signal reaches 10 Hz, but less than ∼ 10% of the sources with binary component masses less than 30 M ⊙ remain eccentric at this level near the last stable orbit (LSO). The eccentricity at LSO is typically between 0.005 -0.05 for the lower-mass BHs, and 0.1 -0.2 for the highest-mass BHs. Thus, due to the limited low-frequency sensitivity, the six currently known quasi-circular LIGO/Virgo sources could still be compatible with this originally highly eccentric source population. However, at the design sensitivity of these instruments, the measurement of the eccentricity and mass distribution of merger events may be a useful diagnostic to identify the fraction of GW sources formed in this channel.Mergers of binary black holes on eccentric orbits are among the targets for second-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detectors.

        <p>The Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory 1 (aLIGO; Aasi et al. 2015) and Advanced Virgo 2 (AdV; Acernese et al. 2015 have made the first six detections of gravitational waves (GWs) from approximately circular inspiraling binaries (Abbott et al. 2016c(Abbott et al. ,d, 2017a,b,c,d) ,b,c,d) during their first two observing runs, and opened a new window through which the universe can be observed. Two additional GW detectors are planned to join the network of aLIGO and AdV: (i) the Japanese KAGRA 3 is under construction, with baseline operations beginning in 2018 (Somiya 2012); while (ii) the proposed LIGO-India 4 is expected to become operational in 2022 (Iyer et al. 2011;Abbott et al. 2016e). These instruments are expected to continue to make detections of GWs and to answer fundamental questions about their astrophysical sources.The Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory 1 (aLIGO; Aasi et al. 2015) and Advanced Virgo 2 (AdV; Acernese et al. 2015 have made the first six detections of gravitational waves (GWs) from approximately circular inspiraling binaries (Abbott et al. 2016c(Abbott et al. ,d, 2017a,b,c,d) ,b,c,d) during their first two observing runs, and opened a new window through which the universe can be observed.

        <p>One of the most anticipated type of events to be detected with ground-based GW detectors is the circular inspiral and coalescence of compact binaries consisting of neutron stars (NSs) and/or black holes (BHs). The current detections constrain the merger rate density of BH-BH mergers in the universe to 12 -213 Gpc -3 yr -1 (Abbott et al. 2017a). At a typical detection range of 2 Gpc, for aLIGO's design sensitivity, this corresponds to a detection rate between 400 -7.000 yr -1 . There are various theoretical studies to explain these rates; see Abadie et al. (2010) for a partial list of historical compact binary coalescence rate predictions, and Dominik et al. 2013;Kinugawa et al. 2014;Abbott et al. 2016a,b,f,g,h; Belczyn-1 http://www.ligo.caltech.edu/ 2 http://www.ego-gw.it/ 3 http://gwcenter.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/ 4 http://www.gw-indigo.org/ ski et al. 2016; Rodriguez et al. 2016a;Sasaki et al. 2016; Bartos et al. 2017;McKernan et al. 2018;Stone et al. 2017;Hoang et al. 2018 and references therein for recent rate estimates. Because GW emission tends to circularize the orbit as it shrinks the binary separation (Peters 1964), many of the GW sources are expected to have small orbital eccentricity by the time they enter the frequency bands of groundbased GW detectors. For instance, although the eccentricity of the Hulse-Taylor pulsar is currently 0.6171 (Hulse &amp; Taylor 1975), it will have an eccentricity of ∼ 10 -4 when it enters the aLIGO band (see Section 5.2).

        <p>There are multiple reasons to expect a non-negligible eccentricity for some binary sources emitting GWs in the aLIGO band. One mechanism leading to eccentric mergers is the Kozai-Lidov oscillation in hierarchical triple systems (Wen 2003), in which the binary is perturbed by a distant third object. Indeed, high-mass stars, the progenitors of BHs, are commonly found in triples in the galactic field (i.e. more than 25% of massive stars are in triples; see Sana et al. 2014). Further, BH binaries can capture triple companions via dynamical encounters in dense stellar systems such as globular clusters (GCs; Wen 2003;Thompson 2011;Aarseth 2012;Antonini et al. 2014Antonini et al. , 2016;;Breivik et al. 2016;Rodriguez et al. 2016a,b) and in isolated triples in the field (Silsbee &amp; Tremaine 2017). BH binaries in orbit around a supermassive BH (SMBH) in galactic nuclei (GNs) also represent hierarchical triples (Antonini &amp; Perets 2012;VanLandingham et al. 2016;Petrovich &amp; Antonini 2017;Hoang et al. 2018;Randall &amp; Xianyu 2018a,b). In these systems, eccentricity may be increased to a value close to unity during Kozai-Lidov oscillations while the semi-major axis is fixed, and GW emission may then quickly reduce the binary separation and lead to a merger before the orbits can fully circularize. A related channel to form eccentric mergers is through dynamical multibody interactions in dense stellar systems, which can drive the low-eccentricity inner binary to high eccentricity (Gültekin et al. 2006;O'Leary et al. 2006;Kushnir et al. 2013;Antonini &amp; Rasio 2016;Rodriguez et al. 2018). If primordial BHs comprise dark matter halos, they may form BH binaries in single-single interactions through GW emission and retain some of their initial eccentricity as they enter the frequency bands of ground-based GW detectors (Cholis et al. 2016). Finally, binary BHs forming in clusters through binary-single interactions may also produce LIGO/VIRGO sources with non-negligible eccentricities (Samsing et al. 2014;Samsing &amp; Ramirez-Ruiz 2017;Samsing 2018;Samsing et al. 2018b).There are multiple reasons to expect a non-negligible eccentricity for some binary sources emitting GWs in the aLIGO band.

        <p>The expected merger rate densities in the Kozai-Lidov channel are uncertain (as are all other rate estimates), but expectations are 1 -1.5 Gpc -3 yr -1 for BH binaries forming in nuclear star clusters through multibody interactions (Antonini &amp; Rasio 2016) and 0.14 -6.1 Gpc -3 yr -1 in isolated triple systems (Silsbee &amp; Tremaine 2017). A merger rate density of order 1 -5 Gpc -3 yr -1 is expected for BH binaries forming via the Kozai-Lidov mechanism in GCs (Antonini et al. 2014(Antonini et al. , 2016;;Rodriguez et al. 2016a,b) and GNs (Antonini &amp; Perets 2012;Hoang et al. 2018), and non-spherical nuclear star clusters may produce BH-BH binary merger rates of up to 15 Gpc -3 yr -1 (Petrovich &amp; Antonini 2017). Smaller-sized GNs with intermediate-mass BHs (VanLandingham et al. 2016) and binary BHs forming in clusters through binarysingle interaction (Samsing et al. 2014;Samsing &amp; Ramirez-Ruiz 2017;Samsing 2018;Samsing et al. 2018a) may produce higher rates. An attractive feature of these merger channels is that they offer a solution to the so-called "final AU problem," i.e. on how the BHs or their progenitors shrink to a separation below which GW emission can drive the binary to merge within a Hubble time (Stone et al. 2017).The expected merger rate densities in the Kozai-Lidov channel are uncertain (as are all other rate estimates), but expectations are 1 -1.5 Gpc -3 yr -1 for BH binaries forming in nuclear star clusters through multibody interactions (Antonini &amp; Rasio 2016) and 0.14 -6.1 Gpc -3 yr -1 in isolated triple systems (Silsbee &amp; Tremaine 2017).

        <p>Here, we focus on another channel, which also naturally solves the final AU problem and leads to eccentric mergers. These are close fly-bys between single objects in dense stellar systems, which form binaries due to GW emission. If the velocity dispersion is high in the host environment, as in GNs, then the binary pericenter distance must be small for a binary to form in this way. This implies that the source will form in the LIGO frequency band and/or remain eccentric in the LIGO band until the merger. Despite the required small impact parameter, the merger rate in this channel may be high due to the extremely high number density of BHs in the masssegregated cusps of GNs.5 O' Leary et al. (2009) showed that the expected aLIGO detection rate at design sensitivity for eccentric mergers forming through GW capture in GNs is higher than ∼ 100 yr -1 if the BH mass function extends to masses above 25 M ⊙ (see also Kocsis &amp; Levin 2012). Since that publication, such heavy BHs have been observed in several LIGO/VIRGO detections (Abbott et al. 2016b(Abbott et al. , 2017a,c),c). This also means that the aLIGO detection rate of highly eccentric binaries may be dominated by sources in GNs that form through GW capture.Here, we focus on another channel, which also naturally solves the final AU problem and leads to eccentric mergers.

        <p>In this paper, we determine the region of initial orbital parameters including eccentricity, pericenter distance, and masses where eccentric binary black holes (EBBHs) may form, the probability density function (PDF) of EBBH mergers as a function of these parameters, and calculate the ex-pected PDF of initial orbital parameters. However, the initial eccentricity may be difficult to detect for eccentric binaries that form outside of the aLIGO frequency band. In Gondán et al. (2018), we have shown that the GW detector network will be capable of measuring the final eccentricity of the source to much higher accuracy at the LSO. Thus, we also determine the distribution of eccentricity at the LSO. Additionally, we determine the distribution of eccentricity at the time the GW signal enters the aLIGO band.In this paper, we determine the region of initial orbital parameters including eccentricity, pericenter distance, and masses where eccentric binary black holes (EBBHs) may form, the probability density function (PDF) of EBBH mergers as a function of these parameters, and calculate the ex-pected PDF of initial orbital parameters.

        <p>We also calculate the merger rate distribution as a function of total mass and mass ratio in a single GN in this channel. Recently, O' Leary et al. (2016) showed that, in GCs, independent of the BH mass function, the likelihood of merger is proportional to M 4 , where M is the total mass of the binary and comparable component masses are most common. Furthermore, Kocsis et al. (2018) found that a different universal relation holds for the likelihood of primordial BH binaries formed in the early universe. Such universal results may be valuable to statistically disentangle different source populations and to determine the BH mass function therein.We also calculate the merger rate distribution as a function of total mass and mass ratio in a single GN in this channel.

        <p>GW signals of EBBHs are very different from those of standard quasi-circular inspirals. At early times, these GW signals in the time domain consist of repeated bursts where the separation between successive bursts shrinks, and their amplitudes change as a function of time, and the waveform transforms into an eccentric quasi-periodic chirp signal before the merger. Eccentricity leads to multiple orbital frequency harmonics in the waveform, pericenter precession causes each harmonic to split into a frequency triplet, and eccentricity also changes the evolution of GW phase. This makes them rich in features and very unique among other signals. Furthermore, these GW signals are more luminous in the aLIGO band than circular sources, which makes them detectable at longer distances (O' Leary et al. 2009).GW signals of EBBHs are very different from those of standard quasi-circular inspirals.

As we will show in this paper, a significant fraction of EBBHs forming through GW capture in GN hosts have e &gt; 0.1 when their GW signals reach the aLIGO band.

        <p>So far, three search methods have been developed to date to find the signals of stellar-mass eccentric BH binaries in data streams of GW detectors (Tai et al. 2014;Coughlin et al. 2015;Tiwari et al. 2016). All three methods achieve substantially better sensitivity for eccentric BH binary signals than existing localized burst searches or chirp-like template-based search methods. However, the complex nature of EBBH waveforms makes it necessary to develop more efficient search algorithms to detect these GW signals for moderately small signalto-noise ratios. Such algorithms would greatly benefit from the detailed prior knowledge of source parameter distributions in the parameter space, particularly the likely range of param-eter values, which must be covered with the search pipeline.So far, three search methods have been developed to date to find the signals of stellar-mass eccentric BH binaries in data streams of GW detectors (Tai et al. 2014;Coughlin et al. 2015;Tiwari et al. 2016).

        <p>Once a source is detected, different algorithms are used to recover its physical parameters. For compact binary coalescence sources on circular inspiral orbits, several algorithms have been developed for this purpose, e.g. BAYESTAR (Singer &amp; Price 2016), LALINFERENCE (Veitch et al. 2015), GSTLAL (Cannon et al. 2012;Privitera et al. 2014), CO-HERENT

            <rs type="software">BAYESWAVE</rs> (Cornish &amp; Littenberg 2015), and LALINFERENCEBURST (Veitch et al. 2015). The development of algorithms recovering the parameters of compact binaries on eccentric orbits are currently underway. These algorithms will play an important role in the astrophysical interpretation of eccentric sources.

In Section 3, we summarize the phases of GW capture-induced binary evolution. In Section 4, we describe Monte Carlo (MC) calculations of the parameter distribution of merger rates. In Section 4.3, we present an analytical derivation of the rates, which captures the leadingorder behavior. In Section 5, we present our results in two parts. First, we present the distributions of orbital parameters of EBBHs at different stages of their time evolution, then we determine the merger rate distributions and the corresponding aLIGO detection rate distributions. We also identify characteristics of GN host environments to which the results are sensitive. Finally, we summarize the results of the paper and draw conclusions in Section 6.

In the single-mass BH population model, we assume that all BHs have m BH = 10 M ⊙ following Morris (1993), Miralda-Escudé &amp; Gould (2000), and Alexander &amp; Hopman (2009) for a 10 Gyr old coeval population, implying that the number density exponent in equation ( 9) is α BH,s = 2 and to determine C BH,s we account for BHs segregated into the nucleus. For the Milky Way, as many as ∼ 20, 000 BHs with 10 M ⊙ each are expected to have segregated into the nucleus (Morris 1993;Miralda-Escudé &amp; Gould 2000;Freitag et al. 2006;Hopman &amp; Alexander 2006). The number of BHs segregated into the GN is proportional to the mass of the SMBH through the infall rate of BHs (see Equation ( 9) in Miralda-Escudé &amp; Gould (2000)), therefore it can be approximated as1.

        <p>The characteristic scale of e LSO may be understood using the characteristic value for ρ p0 given by Equation ( 57) and the relation between ρ p0 and e LSO given by Equation (32). For mergers at a fixed radius r, the distribution of ρ p0 is flat for ρ p0 ρ p0,uni , implying that P(e LSO ) ∝ e LSO for values e LSO e LSO,peak . The characteristic values of e LSO may be determined for GW capture events with different masses by combining Equations ( 32) and (57). For the most massive EBBHs, we find that roughly 50% of them are within r ∼ 4 × 10 -3 pc in a Milky Way-size nucleus, which corresponds to 2000 M SgrA * , where e LSO,peak is ∼ 0.19.

Thus, the peak of the e LSO distribution is high for heavy members of a given population because they are in the close vicinity of the SMBH, while the low-mass members have a much lower e LSO because they are typically much farther out.

        <p>Note that the distribution of e LSO has been previously calculated in O'Leary et al. ( 2009) for a single-mass population. We find two main differences with respect to those results. First, the PDF peaks at a slightly higher value (∼ 0.2 for a single-mass distribution, instead of ∼ 0.1 as in O' Leary et al. 2009), and it drops off quickly beyond the peak instead of taking values at higher eccentricities. The somewhat higher e LSO arises due to the fact that the minimum radius at which the formation of EBBHs is still considered is about 4.5 times lower than that in O' Leary et al. (2009); this implies higher w, and lower ρ p0 and consequently larger e LSO . Note that we assumed a slightly greater massive SMBH mass than O'Leary et al.

In our case, the PDF of e LSO drops off quickly beyond the peak of the distribution at e LSO ∼ 0.23 because we have ignored those encounters for which BHs coalesce before EBBHs form (i.e. ρ p0 8 in all cases; see Sections 4.3 and 5.2 for details), while those binaries are included in the plotted e LSO distributions in O' Leary et al.

Assuming a Milky Way-size nucleus and a fiducial multi-mass BH population with dN/dm BH ∝ m -2.35 BH , m BH,max = 30 M ⊙ , and p 0 = 0.5, ln Λ is equal to 10.71 and 10.17 for the lightest and heaviest binaries, ergo α ranges between -5.39 α 1.36 from the heaviest to lightest components of the EBBH population. The value of α is different for other source populations: α ∼ 4 for BH mergers in GCs (O'Leary et al. 2016), α = 1 for primordial BH binaries formed in the early universe (Kocsis et al. 2018), and α = 10/7 = 1.43 for primordial BHs formed in dark matter halos through GW capture 18 (Bird et al. 2016).</p>

        <p>Figures 9 and 10 show the two-dimensional PDF of merging EBBH event rates as a function of q and M tot for powerlaw BH PMFs and for the Belczynski et al. (2004) PMF, respectively. The left panels show the distribution in a single Milky Way-size nucleus, and the right panels show the distribution for all galaxies in the universe that are detectable BH with β = 1, 2.35, 3, p 0 = 0.5, and the BH mass range corresponds to the Belczynski et al.

The top, middle, and bottom panels correspond to different BH PMF exponents β = 1, 2.35, and 3, respectively, where the range of BH masses is assumed to be between 5 M ⊙ m BH 30 M ⊙ . Because the two-dimensional PDF of merger rate in a single GN does not depend significantly on the assumed SMBH mass (Appendix B.7), the left panels display the distribution of the merger rate density for single GNs in the universe. Low-mass binaries dominate the merger rate density if β 3/2 (see Equation 69) and high-mass binaries close to M tot ∼ 2m BH,max dominate the merger rate density for a top-heavy mass function with β = 1. However, because aLIGO is more sensitive to higher-mass mergers with mass ratios closer to 1 19 , the detection rate distributions shown in the right panels are skewed to higher total masses and equal mass ratios. This observational bias causes the detection rates to be highest at M tot m BH,max up to 2m BH,max for β = 1 and 2.35. For β = 3, the distribution is peaked near M tot ∼ m BH,max with unequal mass ratios. In all cases, equal mass mergers at the low end of the mass distribution M tot ∼ 2m BH,min are highly disfavored for β 3. Note that the mass ratio dependence of the detection rate for fixed M tot is known analytically because d aLIGO ∝ η 1/2 = q 1/2 (1 + q) -1 ; see Equation (C8) or O' Leary et al. (2009).

        <p>In this paper, we determined the expected distribution of intrinsic parameters of merging BH binaries that form in GN from initially unbound BHs due to GW emission during close 19 That is, the maximum luminosity distance of detection increases with Mtot and q over the considered ranges of Mtot and ρ p0 , see Figure 11 encounters. The main intrinsic parameters describing these binaries are their component masses, the initial impact parameter, and initial relative velocity before the encounter. Due to the large velocity dispersion in GN compared to objects in GCs, the galactic disk, or the halo, the objects in GNs must approach one another at much smaller distances to form a binary. The implication is that the initial pericenter distance of the binary is relatively small when the initial eccentricity is beyond e 0 &gt; 0.9. We extended the study of O'Leary et al. (2009) by calculating the eccentricity distribution for mergers among different component masses in a multi-mass distribution, and examined the eccentricity distribution at three particular places during the evolution: at formation, at the instant when the peak GW frequency reaches 10 Hz, and at the LSO. We have also examined how different parameters describing a multi-mass BH distribution affect the distribution of merger rates as a function of masses, eccentricity, and initial pericenter distance. Many of our numerical results and the identified trends are validated by analytical expressions .In this paper, we determined the expected distribution of intrinsic parameters of merging BH binaries that form in GN from initially unbound BHs due to GW emission during close 19 That is, the maximum luminosity distance of detection increases with Mtot and q over the considered ranges of Mtot and ρ p0 , see Figure 11 encounters.

The PDF of initial orbital parameters (Figure 4) shows that EBBHS form with high eccentricities (0.9 e 0 0.9999), and the distribution of initial pericenter distance drops off quickly beyond 20 -80 M tot . The reason is that BHs form EBBHs with high relative velocities in nuclear star clusters around SMBHs (Figure 14).

        <p>(ii) We determined the radial distribution from the central SMBH for GW capture sources with different component masses. We found that, on a logarithmic radial scale, the merger rate distribution is approximately independent of radius for the most massive components, P(ln r) ∝ r -3/14 (Equation 55), between the radius of influence and the inner boundary set by GW-driven infall into the SMBH (i.e. ∼ 3 pc and of order 10 -4 pc, respectively, in Milky-Way type galaxies). This implies that roughly 50% of the high-mass events are formed in the innermost 4 × 10 -3 pc, and approximately 97% within 1.2 pc. The rate of GW capture sources among the least massive objects within the nuclear star cluster is skewed to higher radii on a logarithmic scale, P(ln r) ∝ r 11/14 , for m BH ≪ m BH,max (Equation 55). These events are preferentially closer to the radius of influence; only 2% and roughly 50% of them are within 4 × 10 -3 pc and 1.2 pc, respectively.(ii) We determined the radial distribution from the central SMBH for GW capture sources with different component masses.

        <p>(iv) We determined how the distributions of orbital parameters depend on the mass of the central SMBH, on the binary masses, and on the parameters of the BH population (i.e. the highest possible BH mass, the exponent of the BH mass function, and the mass segregation parameter). We found that the initial pericenter distance systematically decreases with M SMBH and the component masses, while the eccentricity at any stage of the time evolution systematically increases with M SMBH and the component masses. As a consequence, more massive EBBHs around more massive SMBHs reach a 10 Hz frequency limit with higher eccentricity, and they have higher eccentricity at the LSO (see Tables 1,2, and 4). The highest possible BH mass of the BH population affects the binary parameters of GW capture sources.(iv) We determined how the distributions of orbital parameters depend on the mass of the central SMBH, on the binary masses, and on the parameters of the BH population (i.e. the highest possible BH mass, the exponent of the BH mass function, and the mass segregation parameter).

        <p>(v) We found that almost all EBBHs form below the frequency range where aLIGO type detectors are the most sensitive, and so GW capture sources typically enter the aLIGO type detectors' sensitive frequency band for stellar mass BHs (Table 5).(v) We found that almost all EBBHs form below the frequency range where aLIGO type detectors are the most sensitive, and so GW capture sources typically enter the aLIGO type detectors' sensitive frequency band for stellar mass BHs (Table 5).</p>
        <p>(vi) We found that most of the sources become circularized with eccentricities e LSO ∼ 1 -10% when they approach the LSO. The fraction of sources with e LSO &gt; 0.1 is 3 -30% if the maximum possible BH mass in the population is 30 M ⊙ : this fraction of eccentric mergers among BHs with masses less than 30 M ⊙ is less than 10% if the highest mass in the population reaches 80 M ⊙ (Table 2). Because the current GW detectors are only sensitive to the final part of the signal, the currently known six detections cannot constrain the fraction of sources formed in this initially highly eccentric merger channel. Only 1 in 30 detections with e LSO &gt; 0.1 may be expected if the heaviest stellar BH mass in GNs is 80 M ⊙ . The heaviest BHs in such a population are expected to have higher eccentricities; 29 -36% of them have e LSO &gt; 0.1, but their detection may require algorithms sensitive to non-circular orbit waveform features.(vi) We found that most of the sources become circularized with eccentricities e LSO ∼ 1 -10% when they approach the LSO.

        <p>(vii) The prospects for detecting eccentric mergers are expected to improve significantly with the ongoing detector upgrades. We found that the fraction of sources with an eccentricity larger than 0.1 when the peak GW frequency reaches 10 Hz is 84 -90% (43 -69%) for 30 M ⊙ -30 M ⊙ binaries in a BH population with maximum mass of 30M ⊙ (80M ⊙ ). For lower-mass binaries, these numbers are higher, e.g. around 68 -94% of 10 M ⊙ -10 M ⊙ binaries (Tables 1,2, and 4). Thus, when Advanced LIGO and VIRGO reach their design sensitivity at 10 Hz, more than half of GW capture sources in GN are initially eccentric in the detector band. The measurement of the eccentricity and mass distribution will make way to identify the fraction of sources formed in this channel.(vii) The prospects for detecting eccentric mergers are expected to improve significantly with the ongoing detector upgrades.

        <p>(viii) A negligible fraction of EBBHs have eccentricities at LSO lower than 10 -3 (Figure 8). In a companion paper, Gondán et al. (2018), we have shown that the expected relative measurement accuracy of e LSO for the aLIGO-AdV-KAGRA GW detector network is 5% when EBBHs form with relatively small ρ p0 values at a distance of 100 Mpc20 . Other binary formation and evolution channels typically produce binaries with eccentricities at or below 10 -3 when their GW signals enter the aLIGO band (Kowalska et al. 2011;Cholis et al. 2016;Rodriguez et al. 2016a,b;Samsing &amp; Ramirez-Ruiz 2017;Silsbee &amp; Tremaine 2017;Randall &amp; Xianyu 2018a).

        <p>(ix) We conclude that Advanced LIGO/VIRGO detections may confirm or rule out this binary formation channel. However, algorithms using circular binary templates will be ineffective, for the majority of sources, in searching for GW signals of EBBHs forming through GW capture in GNs. This especially affects the heaviest BHs because they are the most eccentric among this source population. The current GW detection limits of the heaviest black holes (Abbott et al. 2017e;Fishbach &amp; Holz 2017) may be impacted by the inefficiency of the applied search algorithms to eccentric sources.(ix) We conclude that Advanced LIGO/VIRGO detections may confirm or rule out this binary formation channel.

        <p>(x) We determined the PDFs of merger rates in single nuclear star clusters in terms of component masses (i.e. total binary mass and mass ratio) and similarly for the detection rates for sources with the Advanced LIGO horizon (Figure 9). The distributions are sensitive to the BH mass function exponent. The highest possible BH mass in GNs affects the total mass and mass ratio distribution just by a rescaling of the mass unit (Equation 69), but the mass distribution of merger rates are otherwise insensitive to the maximum BH mass in GNs. In particular, mass functions steeper/shallower than dN/dm BH ∝ m -1.5 BH lead the merger rate density to be dominated by the lowest/highest mass components in the cluster. However, the detection rate distribution is skewed toward higher masses due to Advanced LIGO/VIRGO's higher sensitivity to heavier BHs for mass function exponents shallower than dN/dm BH ∝ m -3 BH . (xi) We calculated the value of the universal dimensionless parameter α = -M 2 tot ∂ 2 ln R/∂m A ∂m B , which characterizes the physical origin of a source population independently of the underlying BH mass function (Kocsis et al. 2018). We found that, for GW capture sources in a mass-segregated cusp, it follows a monotonically decreasing function of total binary mass (Equation 68) ranging between 1.43 α -20.35 + (Λ -3/28 -Λ 3/28 ) -2 ln 2 Λ, where ln Λ is the Coulomb logarithm (Equation 65). For ln Λ ∼ 10.5, this parameter is approximately α ∼ -5.39 and 1.36 for the heaviest and lightest components, respectively. This is very different from the α of other GW source populations because α ∼ 4 for BH mergers in GCs (O'Leary et al. 2016), α = 1 for primordial BH binaries formed in the early universe (Kocsis et al. 2018), and α = 1.43 for BH binaries that form due to GW capture in otherwise dynamically collisionless systems, such as black holes in dark matter halos (Bird et al. 2016).(x) We determined the PDFs of merger rates in single nuclear star clusters in terms of component masses (i.e. total binary mass and mass ratio) and similarly for the detection rates for sources with the Advanced LIGO horizon (Figure 9).

The highest possible BH mass in GNs affects the total mass and mass ratio distribution just by a rescaling of the mass unit (Equation 69), but the mass distribution of merger rates are otherwise insensitive to the maximum BH mass in GNs. In particular, mass functions steeper/shallower than dN/dm BH ∝ m -1.5 BH lead the merger rate density to be dominated by the lowest/highest mass components in the cluster.

This is very different from the α of other GW source populations because α ∼ 4 for BH mergers in GCs (O'Leary et al. 2016), α = 1 for primordial BH binaries formed in the early universe (Kocsis et al. 2018), and α = 1.43 for BH binaries that form due to GW capture in otherwise dynamically collisionless systems, such as black holes in dark matter halos (Bird et al. 2016).</p>

        <p>We worked under the assumption of a relaxed cusp and assumed spherical symmetry. In the Milky Way's center, the distribution of massive young stars does not represent such a relaxed profile, but forms a clockwise disk structure with a number density distribution n(r) ∼ r -2.9 , which is steeper than the model assumed in (Bartko et al. 2009;Yelda et al. 2014). The stellar distribution around SMBHs with masses M SMBH &gt; 10 7 M ⊙ does not have time to relax within a Hubble time. If BHs in these regions form steeper radial profiles, EBBHs form closer to the center of the GN in higher-velocity dispersion regions. This implies that the eccentricity distribution of mergers is skewed toward higher eccentricities. However, these massive GN are expected to be subdominant, in terms of EBBH rates, because the rates per single GN approximately do not depend on the SMBH mass and low-mass SMBHs are more common (see Sijacki et al. (2015) and references therein). However, the mass-segregated cusp may have a different radial dependence, even in equilibrium, than that assumed in this paper. Keshet et al. (2009) found a steeper number density dependence for the heavy objects if they are subdominant in mass. Fragione &amp; Sari (2018) also found a steeper profile due to disrupted binaries.

(2009). However, by setting p 0 = 0.6, we find that ∂ 2 Γ/∂m A ∂m B ∝ M 10/28 SMBH . As a consequence of Equations (B50)-(B52), ∂ 2 Γ/∂m A ∂m B is somewhat sensitive to M SMBH , but only for the most massive EBBHs in the multi-mass BH population, which implies that ∂ 2 Γ/∂m A ∂m B and any other distribution derived from it will be weakly sensitive to M SMBH (i.e. ∂ 2 Γ/∂M tot ∂q , ∂ 2 Γ/∂M tot ∂µ , ∂ 2 Γ/∂M∂η , and the marginalized distributions, see below).</p>
