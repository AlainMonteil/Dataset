        <p>Three methods were used to assess the impact of the Virgo instrument on this detection. (a) Using the best fit waveform obtained from analysis of the LIGO detectors' data alone, we find that the probability, in 5000 s of data around the event, of a peak in SNR from Virgo data due to noise and as large as the one observed, within a time window determined by the maximum possible time of flight, is 0.3%. (b) A search for unmodeled GW transients demonstrates that adding Advanced Virgo improves the false-alarm rate by an order of magnitude over the two-detector network. (c) We compare the matched-filter marginal likelihood for a model with a coherent BBH signal in all three detectors to that for a model assuming pure Gaussian noise in Virgo and a BBH signal only in the LIGO detectors: the three detector BBH signal model is preferred with a Bayes factor of more than 1600.Three methods were used to assess the impact of the Virgo instrument on this detection.

        <p>Until Advanced Virgo became operational, typical GW position estimates were highly uncertain compared to the fields of view of most telescopes. The baseline formed by the two LIGO detectors allowed us to localize most mergers to roughly annular regions spanning hundreds to about a thousand square degrees at the 90% credible level [7][8][9]. Virgo adds additional independent baselines, which in cases such as GW170814 can reduce the positional uncertainty by an order of magnitude or more [8].Until Advanced Virgo became operational, typical GW position estimates were highly uncertain compared to the fields of view of most telescopes.

        <p>Tests of general relativity (GR) in the strong field regime have been performed with the signals from the BBH mergers detected by the LIGO interferometers [2][3][4][5]10]. In GR, GWs are characterized by two tensor (spin-2) polarizations only, whereas generic metric theories may allow up to six polarizations [11,12]. As the two LIGO instruments have similar orientations, little information about polarizations can be obtained using the LIGO detectors alone. With the addition of Advanced Virgo we can probe, for the first time, gravitational-wave polarizations geometrically by projecting the wave's amplitude onto the three detectors. As an illustration, we perform a test comparing the tensor-only mode with scalar-only and vector-only modes. We find that purely tensor polarization is strongly favored over purely scalar or vector polarizations. With this, and additional tests, we find that GW170814 is consistent with GR.Tests of general relativity (GR) in the strong field regime have been performed with the signals from the BBH mergers detected by the LIGO interferometers [2][3][4][5]10].

Together with GEO600 located near Hanover, Germany [16], several science runs of the initial-era gravitationalwave network were conducted through 2011. LIGO stopped observing in 2010 for the Advanced LIGO upgrade [1]. The Advanced LIGO detectors have been operational since 2015 [17]. They underwent a series of upgrades between the first and second observation runs [4], and began observing again in November 2016.LIGO operates two 4 km long detectors in the U.S., one in Livingston, LA and one in Hanford, WA [14], while Virgo consists of a single 3 km long detector near Pisa, Italy [15].

        <p>Virgo stopped observing in 2011 for the Advanced Virgo upgrade, during which many parts of the detector were replaced or improved [6]. Among the main changes are an increase of the finesse of the arm cavities, the use of heavier test mass mirrors that have lower absorption and better surface quality [18]. To reduce the impact of the coating thermal noise [19], the size of the beam in the central part of the detector was doubled, which required modifications of the vacuum system and the input-output optics [20,21]. The recycling cavities are kept marginally stable as in the initial Virgo configuration. The optical benches supporting the main readout photodiodes have been suspended and put under vacuum to reduce the impact of scattered light and acoustic noise. Cryogenic traps have been installed to improve the vacuum level. The vibration isolation and suspension system, already compliant with the Advanced Virgo requirement [22,23], has been further improved to allow for a more robust control of the last-stage pendulum and the accommodation of baffles to mitigate the effect of scattered light. The test mass The time series were produced by time shifting the best-match template from the online analysis and computing the integrated SNR at each point in time. The single-detector SNRs in Hanford, Livingston, and Virgo are 7.3, 13.7, and 4.4, respectively. Second row: Timefrequency representation of the strain data around the time of GW170814. Bottom row: Time-domain detector data (in color), and 90% confidence intervals for waveforms reconstructed from a morphology-independent wavelet analysis [13] (light gray) and BBH models described in Sec. V (dark gray), whitened by each instrument's noise amplitude spectral density between 20 Hz and 1024 Hz. For this figure the data were also low passed with a 380 Hz cutoff to eliminate out-of-band noise. The whitening emphasizes different frequency bands for each detector, which is why the reconstructed waveform amplitude evolution looks different in each column. The left ordinate axes are normalized such that the physical strain of the wave form is accurate at 130 Hz. The right ordinate axes are in units of whitened strain, divided by the square root of the effective bandwidth (360 Hz), resulting in units of noise standard deviations.Virgo stopped observing in 2011 for the Advanced Virgo upgrade, during which many parts of the detector were replaced or improved [6].

        <p>For Virgo, the noises that are currently limiting the sensitivity at low frequencies are thermal noise of the test mass suspension wires, control noise, the 50 Hz mains line and harmonics, and scattered light driven by seismic noise. At high frequencies, the largest contribution comes from shot noise of the main interferometer beam, with smaller contributions coming from scattered light, and shot noise of a secondary beam used to control the laser frequency. The noise sources that limit LIGO's sensitivity are described in [24] and [25]. For both LIGO and Virgo, commissioning will continue to reach their ultimate designed sensitivities [26].For Virgo, the noises that are currently limiting the sensitivity at low frequencies are thermal noise of the test mass suspension wires, control noise, the 50 Hz mains line and harmonics, and scattered light driven by seismic noise.

        <p>Several noise sources that are linearly coupled to the GW data channel can be subtracted in postprocessing, using auxiliary sensors (e.g., photodiodes monitoring beam motion) and coupling transfer functions calculated via optimal Wiener filters. This technique was used in the initial detector era [27][28][29]. For LIGO, we remove calibration lines, power mains and harmonics, the effect of some length and angular controls, and the effect of laser beam motion. This noise removal can improve the sensitivity of the LIGO detectors by approximately 20% [30]. For Virgo, we remove the effect of some length controls, and the laser frequency stabilization control. The search pipelines described in Sec. III use the calibrated strain data which were produced in low latency and which have not undergone postprocessing noise subtraction. They also use data quality flags which were produced offline. The source properties, however, described in Sec. V, are inferred using the postprocessing noise-subtracted data.

        <p>Detection validation procedures at LIGO [2,31], and checks performed at Virgo found no evidence that instrumental or environmental disturbances could account for GW170814. Tests quantifying the detectors' susceptibility to external environmental disturbances, such as electromagnetic fields [32], indicated that any disturbance strong enough to account for the signal would be clearly detected by the array of environmental sensors. None of the environmental sensors recorded any disturbances consistent with a signal that evolved in time and frequency like GW170814. A noise transient with a central frequency around 50 Hz occurs in the Virgo detector 50 ms after GW170814. This falls outside the window expected due to the light travel time between the detectors, and has, therefore, no effect on the interpretation of the GW signal.Detection validation procedures at LIGO [2,31], and checks performed at Virgo found no evidence that instrumental or environmental disturbances could account for GW170814.

        <p>LIGO is calibrated by inducing test-mass motion using photon pressure from modulated auxiliary lasers [33,34], and Virgo is calibrated using electromagnetic actuators [35,36]. Frequency-dependent calibration uncertainties are determined for both LIGO detectors for GW170814 using the method in [37], and used for estimation of the properties of this event; the maximum 1-σ uncertainty for the strain data in the frequency range 20-1024 Hz is 7% in amplitude and 4°in phase. The maximum 1-σ uncertainties for Virgo are 8% in amplitude and 3°in phase over the same frequency range. The estimation of properties of GW170814 use these maximum values for the Virgo uncertainty over the whole frequency range. Uncertainties in the time stamping of the data are 10 μs for LIGO and 20 μs for Virgo, which does not limit the sky localization.LIGO is calibrated by inducing test-mass motion using photon pressure from modulated auxiliary lasers [33,34], and Virgo is calibrated using electromagnetic actuators [35,36].

For the rapid localization from Hanford and Livingston, the 90% credible area on the sky is 1160 deg 2 and shrinks to 100 deg 2 when including Virgo data.

        <p>In addition to a waveform model, the coherent Bayesian analysis also incorporates the detectors' noise power spectral densities at the time of the event [13,118] and marginalizes over the calibration uncertainties described in Sec. II, as in [4,5,119]. We note that the likelihood used in our analyses assumes that the noise in the detectors is Gaussian in the 4 s window around the event. While some non-Gaussian and nonstationary features exist in the data, initial investigations suggest that the non-Gaussian features in the data do not significantly impact the reported parameters, but we defer a detailed study of these effects to future work. The coherent Bayesian analysis recovers the maximum matched-filter SNR across the LIGO-Virgo network of 18.3 [66,120], with individual detector matched-filter SNRs of 9.7, 14.8, and 4.8 in LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston, and Virgo, respectively.In addition to a waveform model, the coherent Bayesian analysis also incorporates the detectors' noise power spectral densities at the time of the event [13,118] and marginalizes over the calibration uncertainties described in Sec.

As with GW150914 and GW170104, χ eff is consistent with having a arbitrarily small value [4,5]. The spin components orthogonal to L are interesting, as they lead to a precession of the binary orbit [142,143] and are here quantified by the effective precession spin parameter χ p [112,143]. As for previous events [4,5,116,130], the χ p posterior distribution is dominated by assumptions about the prior, as shown in Fig. 4. Given these assumptions, as well as statistical and systematic uncertainties, we cannot draw further robust conclusions about the transverse components of the spin.

        <p>To determine the consistency of the signal with GR, we allowed the post-Newtonian (PN) and additional coefficients describing the waveform to deviate from their nominal values [148][149][150], as was done for previous detections [2][3][4][5]10]. In addition to previously tested coefficients, these analyses were expanded to also explicitly consider phase contributions at effective -1PN order, i.e., with a frequency dependence of f -7=3 . Additionally, as in [2][3][4], we check that the inspiral and merger-ringdown regimes are mutually consistent, and check for possible deviations from GR in the propagation of GWs due to a massive graviton and/or Lorentz invariance violation. Preliminary results of all these tests show no evidence for disagreement with the predictions of GR; detailed investigations are still ongoing, and full results will be presented at a later date.To determine the consistency of the signal with GR, we allowed the post-Newtonian (PN) and additional coefficients describing the waveform to deviate from their nominal values [148][149][150], as was done for previous detections [2][3][4][5]10].

        <p>One of the key predictions of GR is that metric perturbations possess two tensor degrees of freedom [151,152]. These two are only a subset of the six independent modes allowed by generic metric theories of gravity, which may in principle predict any combination of tensor (spin-2), vector (spin-1), or scalar (spin-0) polarizations [11,12]. While it may be that any generic theory of gravity will be composed of a potential mixture of polarization modes, an investigation of this type is beyond the scope of this Letter. However, a simplified first investigation that serves to illustrate the potential power of this new phenomenological test of gravity is to consider models where the polarization states are pure tensor, pure vector, or pure scalar only.One of the key predictions of GR is that metric perturbations possess two tensor degrees of freedom [151,152].

        <p>So far, some evidence that GWs are described by the tensor (spin-2) metric perturbations of GR has been obtained from measurements of the rate of orbital decay of binary pulsars, in the context of specific beyond-GR theories (see, e.g., [153,154] or [155,156] for reviews), and from the rapidly changing GW phase of BBH mergers observed by LIGO, in the framework of parametrized models [2,4,10]. The addition of Advanced Virgo provides us with another, more compelling, way of probing the nature of polarizations by studying GW geometry directly through the projection of the metric perturbation onto our detector network [157][158][159].

V is repeated after replacing the standard tensor antenna response functions with those appropriate for scalar or vector polarizations [160]. In our analysis, we are interested in the geometric projection of the GW onto the detector network; therefore, the details of the phase model itself are less relevant as long it is a faithful representation of the fit to the data in Fig 1 . Hence, we assume a GR phase model. We find Bayes' factors of more than 200 and 1000 in favor of the purely tensor polarization against purely vector and purely scalar, respectively. We also find that, as expected, the reconstructed sky location and distance change significantly depending on the polarization content of the source, with nonoverlapping 90% credible regions for tensor, vector, and scalar. The inferred masses and spins are always the same, because that information is encoded in the signal phasing. These are only the simplest possible phenomenological models, but a more intensive study involving mixed-polarization states, using both matchedfilter and generic GW transient models, is currently under way. Similar tests were inconclusive for previous events [10] because the two LIGO detectors are very nearly coaligned, and record the same combination of polarizations.So far, some evidence that GWs are described by the tensor (spin-2) metric perturbations of GR has been obtained from measurements of the rate of orbital decay of binary pulsars, in the context of specific beyond-GR theories (see, e.g., [153,154] or [155,156] for reviews), and from the rapidly changing GW phase of BBH mergers observed by LIGO, in the framework of parametrized models [2,4,10].
