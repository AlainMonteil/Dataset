        <p>Table of contents 4 • Zootaxa 4284 (1)</p>
        <p>Whilst often referred to as one of the 'minor' or 'lesser known' phyla, the Tardigrada comprises a group of animals with an almost ubiquitous worldwide distribution. These micro-metazoans have a range of 100-2000 μm with an average of 500 μm as mature adults. Tardigrades are bilaterally symmetrical with five distinct 'pseudosegments': the head and four body segments, each bearing a pair of lobopod limbs most often terminated with claws. They are found in a variety of habitats from tropical rain forests to arid polar deserts, and from mountain tops to the abyssal ocean depths.</p>
        <p>Tardigrades were first described in the 18 th Century, with 19 th and early 20 th Century work focusing on taxonomy and ecology, while late 20 th early and 21 st Century studies build on the earlier studies and explore the tardigrades anabiotic adaptations (e.g. Wełnicz et al. 2011). The early work was largely based on morphology with few physiological studies and latterly more discussion on evolutionary and systematic status. Recently, revisions of the Parachela have focused on higher subdivisions (Marley et al. 2011), and families (Pilato &amp; Binda 2010), while there have been a number of revisions to 'species complexes', with an increasing emphasis on molecular data (e.g. Bertolani &amp; Rebecchi 1993;Claxton 1998;Guidetti et al. 2000;Guidetti &amp; Bertolani 2001a;Jørgensen &amp; Kristensen 2004;Guidetti et al. 2005;Jørgensen et al. 2011;Michalczyk et al. 2012a;2012b;Gąsiorek et al. 2016). The monographs by Ramazzotti (1962a;1972;1974) with the final edition III (Ramazzotti and Maucci 1983) and its English translation (Beasley 1995) are still the main starting point for most taxonomic studies on tardigrades. However, it should be noted that the data in the monographs are dated and users would be advised to check original and modern literature for species diagnosis, current taxon names and distribution. A checklist of the known tardigrade taxa (Guidetti &amp; Bertolani 2005;Degma &amp; Guidetti 2007) is regularly updated (Degma et al. 2009(Degma et al. -2016)), and there is also a new online tardigrade taxonomy data repository, 'the Tardigrada Register' (Michalczyk &amp; Kaczmarek 2013).</p>
        <p>The first global biogeographic synthesis of non-marine tardigrades (McInnes 1994) provided limited species bio-distribution ranges within the confines of geopolitical boarders, but remains the starting point for all subsequent studies on any aspect of taxonomy and biogeography. These baseline data have increased by over 70%, while distribution data can now be pinpointed to less than a degree of latitude and longitude. This literature and data explosion of the last two decades has prompted us to embark on an updated and enriched biogeography of the Tardigrada. The sheer quantity of data necessitates that this will be published as a series of nine papers, covering: Central America, South America, North America, Antarctica, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and Oceanic Islands. Each paper will be defined in detail with this, the fifth section, being the non-marine tardigrades of Africa (Figs 1-2).</p>
        <p>Definition of Africa. We are obliged to adopt geopolitical boundaries used to define the major geopolitical regions. We define Africa as the tectonic (continental) African and Arabian Plate, which share a Gondwanan origin (McClusky, et al. 2003;Stern &amp; Johnson 2010). The dividing line becomes the geopolitical boundaries of Syria-Turkey and Iraq-Iran (ca. 35°55'N, 35°54'E to 37°08'N, 44°44'E to 30°00'N, 48°30'E).</p>
        <p>A part of the Gondwanan supercontinent, Africa (comprising the Nubia and Somali plates) became separated from South America, Antarctica and Australasia during the Jurassic to Early Cretaceous about 145-130 Mya, moving northwards with the Arabian plate (Arabian Peninsula), to collide, along the northern edge, with the Eurasian Plate (Scotese 2002). Africa, the second largest continent, straddles the equator and is divided into five geographic sub-regions, which comprise 48 countries (and six island states (including Madagascar) that will be discussed in a later volume). Two biogeographic realms divide Africa. The Palaearctic ecozones to the north includes: temperate coniferous forests, flooded grasslands and savannas, montane grasslands and shrublands, mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub, and deserts and xeric shrublands. Separated by the Saharan and Arabian deserts the Afrotropic ecozones to the south includes: tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests, tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests, tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands, temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands, flooded grasslands and savannas, montane grasslands and shrublands, Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub, deserts and xeric shrublands, and mangrove (UNEP 2008).</p>
        <p>Literature database. The literature database incorporates McInnes (1994), the earlier literature not available in that publication, and subsequently published papers up to 01.03.2017. As this series provides geographical coordinates and habitat information, we feel we are justified in incorporating all published records.</p>
        <p>List format for the Africa species records. The higher taxonomic details to valid genera, species, subspecies (and synonyms) are listed in italics with authority in accordance with the current revision of the Eutardigrada (Bertolani et al. 2014) and the tardigrade checklist (Degma et al. 2009(Degma et al. -2016)). Taxonomy is followed by a code indicating currently known habitat preference (e.g. terrestrial or freshwater). Sensu lato is used where there is doubt about the identifications with explanations provided under 'Remarks'.</p>
        <p>Immediately below the valid species name is a list of synonyms, misidentifications, literature errors (e.g. partial names, typographic anomalies, wrong dates, etc.), and original names prior to taxonomic amendment (e.g. generic reassignment). The type locality for the individual species is provided, followed by a list of Africa locality sites, listed by country in alphabetical order; geographic co-ordinates as (N-S) northings and (E-W) eastings; reference year; altitude; locality and habitat substrate details.</p>
        <p>The geographic co-ordinates and altitude are provided using different font formats depending on the data origin:</p>
        <p>• Original data, where provided, are in Roman and bold font.</p>
        <p>• Where the original data were provided in decimal degrees and/or in imperial unit format, conversions to degree-minute and/or metric format are preceded by a slash (/) and are in Roman font. • If the original data are inconsistent (e.g. co-ordinates or altitude not corresponding with the locality description or mismatched altitude for given co-ordinates), we offer nearest potential site using 
            <rs type="software">Google Earth™</rs> (ver. 
            <rs type="version">6.2.2.6613</rs>), provided in square brackets and Roman font. • When original co-ordinates were not supplied, we have provided estimated data in italics. In order to estimate co-ordinates and/or altitude, we used 
            <rs type="software">Google Earth™</rs> (ver. 
            <rs type="version">6.2.2.6613</rs>) and the following rules:
        </p>
        <p>-where a general locality, administrative unit, or specified location was provided (e.g. building, city, valley, province, country, mountain or mountain range), the collection site was approximated to the centre of the smallest viable unit (assisted by an additional data, e.g. altitude); -sample sites described as x distance in y direction from a named locality (e.g. city), were approximated using Google™ Earth tools; -the midpoint between localities A and B for sample sites reported as, "alongside a road between locality A and B", was used unless altitude data could provide a more reasonable estimate; -for samples collected from or near a river, the mid-point of the river was chosen with consideration to additional data (e.g. altitude, country, region or district).</p>
        <p>Below each species list there is a summary of records per country and the total number of records in Africa. Finally, at the bottom there are brief remarks on the current species distribution and taxonomy.</p>
        <p>Throughout the paper we use the term 'currently endemic' where species distribution records are restricted to a particular country or a given geographic region. However, it is important to note that the general paucity of tardigrade records make it impossible to verify whether a taxon is truly locally endemic.</p>

        <p>Phylum: Tardigrada Spallanzani, 1776 Class: Heterotardigrada Marcus, 1927 Order: ECHINISCOIDEA Richters, 1926 Family: Echiniscoididae Kristensen &amp; Hallas, 1980 Genus: Echiniscoides Plate, 1888 1. Echiniscoides sigismundi (M. Schultze, 1865) sensu lato Terra typica: North Sea (Belgium, Europe) Democratic Republic of Congo: • 00°47′S, 29°18′E; 1,000 m asl: South Kivu Province, Albert National Park [Virunga National Park], Rwindi, soil sample. Teunissen (1938) Record numbers. Democratic Republic of Congo: 1; total: 1. Remarks. This is an unusual report of a coastal marine genus that was described from an inland soil environment.</p>
        <p>The description of 12 females, one male and 19 juveniles plus eggs suggests this is a valid identification.</p>
        <p>Whether the original samples were the result of contaminated sampling gear or this species truly occurs within the African Rift, requires further exploration.</p>
        <p>Family: Echiniscidae Thulin, 1928 Genus: Bryodelphax Thulin, 1928 2. Bryodelphax maculatus Gąsiorek, Stec, Morek, Marnissi &amp; Michalczyk, 2017 [T] Bryodelphax maculatus sp. nov. (Gąsiorek et al. 2017) Terra typica: Tunisia (Africa) Tunisia: • 36°43'20''N, 08°40'58''E; 668 m asl: Jendouba Governorate, Beni M'tir, forest, moss on soil. Record numbers. Tunisia: 2; total: 2. Remarks. This recently described species is currently endemic to Tunisia.</p>
        <p>Bryodelphax parvulus Thulin 1928(da Cunha &amp; do Nascimento 1964) Echiniscus (B.) parvulus (Thulin 1928) (Binda 1971) Bryodelphax parvulus (Ramløv &amp; Kristensen 1985) Terra typica: Norway (Europe) Angola: 31°06′N, 07°55′W; 2,300-2,500 m asl: Tadla-Azilal Region, path to the Jebel Toubkal, scattered tussock vegetation, moss on basalt and mica slate. Ramløv &amp; Kristensen (1985) Record numbers. Angola: 1, Morocco: 3, Libya: 1; total: 5. Remarks. The considerable morphological variation of B. parvulus (e.g. the presence or absence of the spine and papilla on legs, etc.) suggests that this taxon may be a complex of closely related species, each with limited geographic ranges, rather than a single cosmopolitan species (see also Pilato et al. 2010). The actual geographic range and the presence of B. parvulus sensu lato in Africa must be carefully verified.</p>

        <p>Genus: Cornechiniscus Maucci &amp; Ramazzotti, 1981 5. Cornechiniscus cornutus (Richters, 1907a) [T]</p>
        <p>Cornechiniscus cornutus Richters, 1906(Pilato &amp; Pennisi 1976) Cornechiniscus cornutus (Richters, 1906) (Binda &amp; Pilato 1987) Terra typica: Germany (Europe) Algeria: Record numbers. Algeria: 1, Libya: 1; total: 2. Remarks. A mainly northern hemisphere (Palaearctic) species with a Nearctic record (McInnes 1994, Kaczmarek et al. 2016).</p>
        <p>6. Cornechiniscus lobatus (Ramazzotti, 1943) [T]</p>
        <p>Cornechiniscus lobatus (Ramløv &amp; Kristensen 1985) Terra typica: Italy (Europe) Jordan: • 31°50′N, 36°49′E; 500 m asl: Zarqa Governorate, Zarqa [Azarq Wetland Reserve], moss. Kaczmarek &amp; Michalczyk (2004a) Morocco: • 30°27′N, 07°32′W; 1,850 m asl: Souss-Massa-Drâa Region, Tizi-n-Taghatine, sparse vegetation, mosses and lichens on isolated basalt cliffs. Ramløv &amp; Kristensen (1985) Record numbers. Jordan: 1, Morocco: 1; total: 2. Remarks. A northern hemisphere species (McInnes 1994a), also known from Nearctic Mexico and Neotropic Peru (Kaczmarek et al. 2014(Kaczmarek et al. , 2015)).</p>
        <p>Genus: Echiniscus C.A.S. Record numbers. Angola: 1, Botswana: 1, Tanzania: 1; total: 3. Remarks. A species with a disjunct distribution, reported from Africa and South and Central America (McInnes 1994, Kaczmarek et al. 2014, 2015), which potentially hides either more than one cryptic species, a rare species with very specific habitat requirements, or a species with Pan-tropical distribution. Record numbers. Botswana: 1, Cameroon: 1, Republic of South Africa: 1; total: 3. Remarks. This bona fide species belongs to the Neotropical and Antarctic bigranulatus group but is easily mistaken for other siblings (see: Michalczyk &amp; Kaczmarek 2006a, 2007). All records prior to 2006 require confirmation, while the three uncertain records from Africa require re-examination and confirmation. Record numbers. Israel and Palestinian National Authority: 1, Libya: 1, Morocco: 6, Tunisia: 1; total: 9. Remarks. This species is believed to be almost cosmopolitan, however, the locus typicus is in the Arctic and most of the records are from the Northern Hemisphere (Europe and North America) (McInnes 1994). Echiniscus blumi should perhaps be considered Holarctic, with records from other parts of the world requiring confirmation (Kaczmarek et al. 2015).</p>
        <p>E. canadensis (Ramløv &amp; Kristensen 1985) Terra typica: Canada (North America) Algeria: Record numbers. Namibia: 1; total: 1. Remarks. The record for three eggs in exuvia and a two clawed juvenile, suggests a tentative identification.</p>
        <p>Originally described from the Kerguelen Islands in the southern Indian Ocean, this species requires a redescription from the type locality before the various records attributed to this species can be clarified. Record numbers. Angola: 1; total: 1. Remarks. The species has a disjunct Africa (type locale) and Asia distribution (Beasley &amp; Cleveland 1996;Kaczmarek &amp; Beasley 2002;Li et al. 2008), suggesting that the Asian records need re-assessment. Record numbers. Somalia: 1; total: 1. Remarks. This species has only two reports from the type locale and China (Yang 2002a), but the disjunct distribution suggests an error. Further analysis is required to verify this species and whether it is endemic to Somalia. (Murray 1913; as an unnamed species), Marcus (1928) Record numbers. Uganda/Kenya: 1; total: 1. Remarks. This species has not been reported since the original reference (Murray 1913), and although currently endemic to Africa, it will be difficult to locate and verify the type locality. Record numbers. Republic of South Africa: 1; total: 1. Remarks. This rare species is based on the single original reference from Africa (Murray 1907a) and two early reports from South America (Kaczmarek et al. 2015). As no type material is known it may prove difficult to find neotype material.</p>
        <p>Pseudechiniscus suillus (Ehrenberg, 1853) 42. Pseudechiniscus jiroveci Bartoš, 1963 [T] Pseudechiniscus jiroveci Bartos, 1963(Binda 1984) Pseudechiniscus jiroveci Bartoš 1963(Pilato et al. 1991, Binda &amp; Pilato 1995a) Terra typica: China (Asia) Republic of South Africa: Record numbers. Republic of South Africa: 1, Tanzania: 2; total: 3. Remarks. Originally described from five juvenile (two clawed) individuals (Bartoš, 1963), this rare species has a restricted distribution including the type locale (China), Mongolia (Kaczmarek &amp; Michalczyk 2006) and Africa.</p>
        <p>Terra typica: Italy (Europe) Uganda:</p>
        <p>• 01°22′N, 32°17′E: Undefined locality. Binda (1974) Record numbers. Uganda: 1; total: 1. Remarks. A passing comment by Binda (1974) Murray (1907bMurray ( , 1913) ) Record numbers. Angola: 1, Cameroon: 1, Ethiopia: 1, Israel: 1, Kenya: 1, Morocco: 3, Republic of South Africa: 3, Tanzania: 1, Tunisia: 1, Uganda: 1; total: 14. Remarks. There is confusion with some early records of Echiniscus arctomys (e.g. Murray 1907a, b;Richters 1908), which were identified as in error by Richters (1911), corrected to Echiniscus suillus and in Marcus (1928) to Pseudechiniscus suillus. Middleton (2003) Record numbers. Angola: 2, Botswana: 2, Democratic Republic of Congo: 2, Ethiopia: 1, Israel and Palestinian National Authority: 3, Jordan; 1, Kenya: 1, Lesotho: 3, Morocco: 4, Namibia: 1, Republic of South Africa: 9, Somalia: 1, Tunisia: 4, Uganda: 1, Zimbabwe: 2; total: 37. Remarks. For over 150 years Milnesium was considered to be a monotypic, highly cosmopolitan genus. However, current research recognises over twenty congeners and suggests that Milnesium tardigradum sensu stricto is confined to the Palaearctic (see: Michalczyk et al. 2012a,b). All African reports of M. tardigradum pre-date the re-description of M. tardigradum sensu stricto (Michalczyk et al. 2012a,b) and therefore these records should be questioned and re-examination using modern taxonomy. Currently, there is no evidence to confirm or deny the presence of M. tardigradum s. s. in Africa, and the above list probably represents a number of different Milnesium species (Michalczyk et al. 2012a,b). Record numbers. Tanzania: 2, Republic of Zambia: 1; total: 3. Remarks. This species is currently endemic to Africa and associated (Seychelles) islands (Binda &amp; Pilato 1995b).</p>
        <p>Order: Parachela Record numbers. Israel and Palestinian National Authority: 4, Morocco: 1, Uganda: 1; total: 6.</p>
        <p>Remarks. The alpinum group is a complex of very similar, difficult to discriminate, species (Pilato &amp; Binda 1998).</p>
        <p>The nominal species is considered rare and probably Palaearctic (Pilato &amp; Binda 1998). All African reports are questionable and require further examination. Record numbers. Democratic Republic of Congo: 1, Tanzania: 1, Tunisia: 1; total: 3. Remarks. The pingue group is a complex of similar species (Pilato &amp; Binda 1998, 1999, see Fontoura &amp; Pilato (2007) for diagnostic key). Diphascon pingue sensu lato was believed to be cosmopolitan (McInnes 1994a), but the recent revision suggests the nominal species is probably Holarctic (Pilato &amp; Binda 1998, 1999). Some of the African reports could be for Diphascon pingue sensu stricto; however, other species from pingue group, e.g. D. zaniewi from the Republic of South Africa, have been described from the region. Record numbers. Kenya: 1. Republic of South Africa: 2, Uganda: 1; total: 4. Remarks. Described as 'arcticus' by Murray (1907a;1913) in both references there is a confusion between the species described as 'arcticus' and 'antarcticus'. Murray (1907a) Record numbers. Cameroon: 2, Republic of South Africa: 1, Tanzania: 1, Tunisia: 1; total: 5. Remarks. Adropion scoticum sensu lato is a cosmopolitan complex of very similar species, which can only be determined by careful integrated (morphology and molecular) taxonomy. A re-description of the A. scoticum sensu stricto type material is required.</p>
        <p>63. Adropion scoticum ommatophorum (Thulin, 1911) Record numbers. Algeria: 1; total: 1. Remarks. This rare species, with a largely Palaearctic distribution (McInnes 1994), can be confused with A. trinacariae (see Dastych 1988;Ramazzotti &amp; Maucci 1983). Both species need re-descriptions based on type material or new material from the type locality.</p>
        <p>65. Astatumen trinacriae (Arcidiacono, 1962) [T]</p>
        <p>Itaquascon trinacriae Arcidiacono, 1962(Binda 1984, Binda &amp; Pilato 1987, Van Rompu et al. 1995 Record numbers. Tanzania: 1; total: 1. Remarks. This highly disjunct distribution, based on a single African specimen (Binda &amp; Pilato 1995a), suggests further taxonomic analysis is required.</p>
        <p>Genus: Mesocrista Pilato, 1987</p>
        <p>68. Mesocrista spitzbergensis (Richters, 1903) [T]</p>
        <p>Diphascon emmautinum nov. spec. (Rahm 1936) Terra typica: Svalbard (Spitsbergen) Jordan: • 32°02′N, 35°50′E; 950 m asl: Amman Governorate, way to Amman, extreme arid or semi-arid climate. Rahm (1936) Record numbers. Jordan: 1; total: 1 Remarks. Due to the limited original description (Rahm 1936), Ramazzotti (1972) considered this a variant of spitzbergensis. However, recent analysis of M. spitzbergensis and related species (Gąsiorek et al. 2016) Record numbers. Tanzania: 1; total: 1.</p>
        <p>Remarks. The description in Van Rompu et al. (1991a), was based on a single specimen displaying a deformed pharyngeal bulb with the macroplacoids and microplacoid situated towards the anterior of the bulb. Such a description had been thought to indicate the species 'antarcticus' but was subsequently recognised as either pre-simplex form or a mounting anomaly (Dastych 1991). The presence of a microplacoid indicates this was not Acutuncus antarcticus but was probably a Hypsibius spp. Therefore, the actual presence of Acutuncus antarcticus in Africa needs to be confirmed.</p>
        <p>Family 2016), though most require the presence of eggs (see Biserov 1998 for a diagnostic key to the genus). The presence of R. oberhaeuseri in Africa remains unconfirmed. Some North African specimens may belong to the recently described R. libycus (see above) or another Ramazzottius species. Murray (1913), briefly reported specimens from Uganda and Kenya, which he described as, "strongly papillose over the whole body, and brightly coloured, varying from the typical madder brown to vivid purple". We suggest these specimens do not belong to the nominal R. oberhaeuseri but may represent R. szeptycki.</p>
        <p>78. Ramazzottius szeptycki (Dastych, 1980) [T]</p>
        <p>Ramazzottius szeptyckii (Dastych, 1980) Record numbers. Algeria: 2; total: 2. Remarks. This species has a limited distribution including Algeria and Hungary (Vargha 1995;1996;1998, Vargha &amp; Iharos 2001). Record numbers. Ivory Coast: 1, Morocco: 1; total: 2. Remarks. Dastych (2016) has re-described I. tetradactyloides (Richters, 1907b) as the junior synonym of I. asper (Murray, 1906b). Dastych (2016) noted that the Marcus (1936) Record numbers. Morocco: 1; total: 1. Remarks. The limited species diagnostics and similarity with I. sattleri requires a modern taxonomic revision (Ramazzotti &amp; Maucci 1983). Also reported from two localities in Europe and one (uncertain) in South America (McInnes 1994, Kaczmarek et al. 2015). Record numbers. Cameroon: 1; total: 1. Remarks. Rare species only reported from localities in Australia, Cameroon, Japan and New Zealand (Pilato et al. 1991, McInnes 1994, Ito 1995). Horning et al. (1978) suggested that some identifications of this species were doubtful but Pilato &amp; Binda (1997) Record numbers. Ivory Coast: 1; Kenya: 5; total: 6. Remarks. The Holarctic distribution of this species suggests the single locality in Brazil (Kaczmarek et al. 2014) and the African records could belong to another species. The original species description (Thulin 1928) requires a modern re-description of type material.</p>
        <p>Macrobiotus indicus (Murray 1913) Terra typica: India (Asia) Kenya:</p>
        <p>• 00°01′S, 37°54′E: Undefined locality, British East Africa [Kenya], moss. Murray (1913) Record numbers. Kenya: 1; total: 1. Remarks. Originally described from Himalayas (Murray 1907) as a tuberculatus type. This report from Africa is for a single specimen in simplex stage, with a note that the claws were slightly different (Murray 1913).

Reported from a limited number of pan-global sites (McInnes 1994), indicative of a possible species complex. Interestingly, Murray (1913) (referring to the cuticle) specified for the specimens from Kenya, "The knobs are very prominent, yet smaller than in the type. In the type they are so large that they occupy the whole surface of the segments and meet at their bases. These are only about half the diameter, and are separated at their bases." Pardi (1941) also indicated smaller separated nodules. Further study of type material is required to clarify the identity of species attributed to this taxon.</p>

Democratic Republic of Congo: 1, Kenya: 3, Morocco: 3; total 7. Remarks. This species is largely Palaearctic with limited reports from other regions (McInnes 1994), indicative of a probable species complex. The original description for I. prosostomus requires a re-evaluation of the type material to clarify the confused descriptions. For example, Haspeslagh (1982) corroborates Cuenot (1932) noting a "characteristic oblique cuticular bar" at the base of claws I-III, which was absent in the original description (Thulin 1911(Thulin , 1928)).

This member of the tuberculatus-group has a history of major taxonomic confusion with I. bakonyiensis (now the junior synonym), but was re-described from a Richters' 1905 slide in the Senckenberg Museum (Germany) by Dastych (1990). Nevertheless, the literature-based, supposed, cosmopolitan distribution (McInnes 1994), requires major taxonomic re-evaluation of all specimens attributed to I. sattleri.</p>

Like many early descriptions, the original information about I. tuberculatus was limited and has created the tuberculatus-group of species, with a long history of major taxonomic confusion. This nominal species is largely Holarctic (McInnes 1994), but all reports, including the African records, require further analyses.</p>

Algeria: 1; total: 1. Remarks. This report for Isohypsibius megalonyx compares details with Hypsibius (Isohypsibius) augusti (Murray 1907), but, with the historical confusion between these species, the records from North Africa should be considered questionable.</p>

Kenya: 9, Morocco: 2; total: 11. Remarks. Reports for Isohypsibius augusti are included here as there has been major taxonomic confusion between the original description as Macrobiotus augusti (Murray 1907), which was transferred to Isohypsibius by Thulin (1928) and a re-description from non-type material by Marcus (1936), leaving all augusti records split between Pseudobiotus and Thulinius (see: Bertolani et al. 1999, Marley et al. 2008). While Murray's (1907e) augusti is now Thulinius, the Kenyan references are associated with megalonyx (Marcus 1935) (now Pseudobiotus), or have either no description or no figures (Haspeslagh 1982, De Smet &amp; Bafort 1990). The Moroccan report only indicated a Pseudobiotus sp. (Ramløv &amp; Kristensen 1985). Re-examination of all the African samples is required to confirm which taxa are present. Record numbers.

        <p>• 06°22′S, 34°53′E: Undefined locality. Grigarick et al. (1973) Record numbers. Tanzania: 1; total: 1. Remarks. This reference is based solely on eggs, with no additional information. Macrobiotus hibiscus is possibly a junior synonym of Macrobiotus hufelandi as the morphology of this species falls within the Macrobiotus hufelandi group diagnosis (e.g. Kathman 1990). This group requires careful taxonomic analysis, including egg morphology, for correct identification (see Bertolani &amp; Rebecchi 1993 for a diagnostic key and other papers for more recent species descriptions: e.g. Pilato et al. 2003b, Kaczmarek &amp; Michalczyk 2004c, Fontoura et al. 2008b, Bartels et al. 2009, Kaczmarek &amp; Michalczyk 2009b, Guidetti et al. 2013). A few additional species from the hufelandi group have been described from Africa and neighbouring islands, e.g. M. iharosi or M. madegassus Maucci, 1993. Further work on the Brazilian type material or type locale will clarify the status and biogeography of this species. The limited material from this report suggests the presence of M. hibiscus in Africa is very doubtful. Record numbers. Algeria: 5, Angola: 2, Botswana: 1, Cameroon: 7, Democratic Republic of Congo: 1, Equatorial Guinea: 5, Ethiopia: 2, Israel and Palestinian National Authority: 13, Kenya: 3, Lesotho: 2, Libya: 1, Morocco: 6, Republic of South Africa: 3, Rwanda: 1, Tanzania: 1, Tunisia: 5, Uganda: 1; total: 59. Remarks. Taxa identified as Macrobiotus hufelandi sensu lato have a cosmopolitan distribution (McInnes 1994).</p>
        <p>However, this nominal species and all other hufelandi group taxa require careful taxonomic analysis, including egg morphology, in order to properly differentiate the individual species (see Bertolani &amp; Rebecchi 1993 for the review and for e.g. Pilato et al. 2003b, Kaczmarek &amp; Michalczyk 2004c, Fontoura et al. 2008b, Bartels et al. 2009, Kaczmarek &amp; Michalczyk 2009b, Guidetti et al. 2013 for new species within the group). These, particularly older, African reports citing the presence of M. hufelandi, need re-assessment using modern integrated taxonomy. Marcus (1933) Record numbers. Angola: 3, Namibia: 1; total: 4. Remarks. This largely Holarctic species (McInnes 1994) was re-described by Binda &amp; Pilato (1992). With the recognised species Minibiotus ethelae in South Africa we believe the presence of furcatus in Africa needs confirmation.</p>

        <p>Macrobiotus granatai sp. n.

Pardi (1941) Record numbers. Ethiopia: 1; total: 1. Remarks. This species has not been reported since the original description from the type locale in Ethiopia. Kaczmarek 2006b, Degma et al. 2008, Kaczmarek et al. 2014b). Both Richters (1908) and Binda (1984) predate the taxonomic changes and failed to find eggs, essential for correct species identification.

Remarks. Paramacrobiotus richtersi was, until recently, believed to be cosmopolitan (McInnes 1994). New data has shown that this is the nominal species for a species complex -the 'richtersi group' -requiring careful examination of both adults and eggs. Most African reports pre-date the taxonomic re-assessment and several lack eggs, so proper identification cannot be confirmed (e.g. Van Rompu et al. (1995), whose drawings could be interpreted as an adult of the M. harmsworthi group). Paramacrobiotus richtersi was originally described from Europe (Murray, 1911), suggesting 'some confusion' and that all African records should be treated with caution until the original material is re-examined or the species is otherwise verified from the region.</p>

        <p>Overview. The African data comprises 170 species from ca. 260 localities (Tables 12), of which only 29 (ca. 17%) are endemic to Africa (see Table 1). Species, listed by country, are provided in Table 2 as a quick checklist for the benefit of readers interested in the fauna of specific countries rather than species distribution for the whole of Africa. Status of knowledge. The above data, Table 1 and Figure 2, clearly show the very limited literature for this region, with few local areas of intense study (South Africa) and vast swathes of Africa with limited or no information (Figure 2). Much of the literature is dated (pre 1950s) and very little has been produced since some major revisions in tardigrade taxonomy. Many of the earlier surveys report examples of species that are now considered species-complexes, or have made erroneous conclusions using European and/or North American biased literature. Indeed, even Murray (1907e) commented that, "till quite recently few supposed that there were numerous species of Tardigrada", and the view that tardigrade species are ubiquitous and cosmopolitan has persisted. Re-examination of these early samples, if available, is recommended to verify all reported species and diagnose potential cryptic taxa. The original biogeographic synthesis (McInnes 1994a) stimulated numerous studies of both well explored and new regions and it is hoped this more detailed biogeography will highlight and elicit more work on the unexplored regions, and African biodiversity hotspots (Burgess et al. 2004;CEPF 2016). TABLE 1. Zoogeographic, taxonomic and ecological information summarised by country listed alphabetically. Endemic taxa = endemic to each country.</p>
        <p>Introduced species and "Endemism". As observed for the New World (Kaczmarek et al. 2014, Kaczmarek et al. 2015, Kaczmarek et al. 2016), a number of tardigrades reported show extremely disjunct distributions. While it is possible these may be explained in terms of anthropogenic or animal vectors, prevailing trade winds and ocean currents, the African literature is so poor that simple misidentification is equally plausible. To verify introduced species requires good regional baseline data, where 'new' taxa could be attributed to transport enhanced dispersal. Unfortunately, our knowledge of African tardigrade fauna falls well short of being able to support this type of analysis. (Figure 2). Although tardigrades have no economic importance, and are of little interest to most African states, there is significant potential to expand the regional tardigrade data with a significant portion (perhaps even the majority) of the fauna currently undiscovered.</p>
