        <p>We initiate a systematic enumeration and classification of entropy inequalities satisfied by the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for conformal field theory states with smooth holographic dual geometries. For 2, 3, and 4 regions, we prove that the strong subadditivity and the monogamy of mutual information give the complete set of inequalities. This is in contrast to the situation for generic quantum systems, where a complete set of entropy inequalities is not known for 4 or more regions. We also find an infinite new family of inequalities applicable to 5 or more regions. The set of all holographic entropy inequalities bounds the phase space of Ryu-Takayanagi entropies, defining the holographic entropy cone. We characterize this entropy cone by reducing geometries to minimal graph models that encode the possible cutting and gluing relations of minimal surfaces. We find that, for a fixed number of regions, there are only finitely many independent entropy inequalities. To establish new holographic entropy inequalities, we introduce a combinatorial proof technique that may also be of independent interest in Riemannian geometry and graph theory.We initiate a systematic enumeration and classification of entropy inequalities satisfied by the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for conformal field theory states with smooth holographic dual geometries.

        <p>Understanding the microscopic mechanism of holography is one of the outstanding problems in quantum gravity.

        <p>There have been many profound implications of this formula. Notably, when the formula is applied to the case of the two-sided black hole geometry, one finds that the Einstein-Rosen bridge encodes entanglement of thermofield double degrees of freedom in the boundary CFT [6,7]. Moreover, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula has been used to derive the linearized Einstein equations in AdS [2,8], as well as to obtain integrated energy conditions [9,10]. These examples all demonstrate important connections between bulk geometry and entanglement data on the boundary.There have been many profound implications of this formula.

        <p>Not all CFT states have holographic duals with a smooth geometry. Since the bulk geometry reflects boundary entanglement, we envisage that criteria for smooth bulk geometry can be partially expressed in terms of entanglement properties of the boundary CFT. The situation is similar to the hydrodynamic description of many body systems, where the evolution of a system is approximately described in terms of emergent macroscopic degrees of freedom; the validity of the approximation can be stated in terms of properties of macroscopic observables such as density and velocity. In this sense, holography is akin to a hydrodynamic description of the boundary entanglement with entropies as its macroscopic phase space.Not all CFT states have holographic duals with a smooth geometry.

        <p>We wish to identify the criteria that bound this entropic phase space for holographic states. It has been a long-standing open question to determine whether there are any further universal entropy inequalities apart from the classical ones [11][12][13]. For probability distributions, this question has been answered to the affirmative in the breakthrough works [14,15]: for n ≥ 4 random variables, there is an infinite number of independent entropy inequalities satisfied by the Shannon entropy. In network coding theory, they give rise to tighter capacity bounds [16]. The quantum case has so far remained elusive, though there has been partial progress [17][18][19][20]. Understanding the phase space of entanglement entropies for specific subclasses of quantum systems is also of general interest for information theorists. Holographic states are an interesting set of quantum states, and are in many ways similar to the set of all stabilizer states. In both cases, special restrictions on entanglement entropy allow for the usage of more powerful methods in attempting to characterize the inequalities that govern them. For example, it is known that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for holographic entanglement entropy satisfies the following monogamy inequality for the mutual information, which is defined by I(A : B) = S(A) + S(B) -S(AB):We wish to identify the criteria that bound this entropic phase space for holographic states.

        <p>In this paper, we initiate a systematic enumeration and classification of entropy inequalities satisfied by the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. We will begin our study by defining the JHEP09(2015)130 notion of the holographic entropy cone. For a given number of boundary regions, the holographic entropy cone parametrizes the phase space of allowed Ryu-Takayanagi entropies in arbitrary holographic CFTs. Akin to the classical case, we show that the phase space is closed under suitably-defined addition and scaling, giving it the structure of a convex cone. Our entropy inequalities form the facets of this cone, but it can equally be described by its extreme rays, the one-dimensional intersections of these inequalities. These rays are extremal in the entropic phase space, and they have a privileged role in our considerations.In this paper, we initiate a systematic enumeration and classification of entropy inequalities satisfied by the Ryu-Takayanagi formula.

        <p>The framework of entropy cones allows us to study holographic entropies in a systematic fashion by using convex geometry. We prove that, for 2, 3 and 4 regions, the monogamy of mutual information (1.2) and strong subadditivity, S(AB) + S(BC) ≥ S(B) + S(ABC), give the complete set of inequalities. This is in contrast to the situation for generic quantum systems, where a complete set of entropy inequalities is not known for 4 or more regions. The pattern changes at 5 regions, where we find a new set of inequalities. As we increase the number of regions, a new infinite family of independent entropy inequalities emerges, of which the strong subadditivity and the monogamy of mutual information are two special cases. This family of inequalities can be understood as a bound of the form proposed for differential entropy [23], but of much more general application.The framework of entropy cones allows us to study holographic entropies in a systematic fashion by using convex geometry.

        <p>The systematic study of holographic entropy has required the development of new tools, which are of considerable interest in their own right. While a continuous geometry describes infinitely many minimal surfaces, any entropy inequality is only concerned with a finite number of boundary regions. We show that the relevant information in the geometry can thus be reduced to a finite, weighted graph. This graph model is a minimal model for the geometry that faithfully reproduces all Ryu-Takayanagi entropies by a simple graph-theoretic prescription. It also contains information on all possible ways the minimal surfaces can be cut and reassembled to generate new surfaces that bound the entanglement entropies of other bulk regions. Graph models allow us to study holographic entropies using combinatorial methods. One insight that follows is that, for a fixed number regions, there are only finitely many independent inequalities required by the Ryu-Takayanagi entropy formula; in other words, that the holographic entropy cones are polyhedral.The systematic study of holographic entropy has required the development of new tools, which are of considerable interest in their own right.

        <p>We would also like to understand what characterizes the states that only marginally satisfy these constraints. These states lie at the extremal boundary between the states that are realizable holographically and those that are not. If entanglement is somehow constitutive of spacetime, then we expect extremal states to be geometries that are in some sense nearly torn apart. It has similarly been suggested that EPR pairs create an ER bridge [24] and that, with sufficient amounts of properly organized entanglement, these wormholes coalesce into smooth geometry. Therefore, it may be reasonable to expect that the extremal geometries are themselves wormhole geometries.We would also like to understand what characterizes the states that only marginally satisfy these constraints.

        <p>From the perspective of entropy, the extremal geometries correspond to extreme rays of the holographic entropy cone. The entropies for an arbitrary smooth geometry can in turn be obtained by specific convex combinations of the extreme rays. This can be understood as making visible the individual threads of the entropy fabric. We show that the entropies JHEP09(2015)130 of any extreme ray can indeed be explained by certain extremal multiboundary wormhole geometries as considered in [25,26]. In fact, we prove more generally that any graph model naturally gives rise to a multiboundary wormhole geometry that has the same entropies. This shows that graph models provide a completely equivalent, combinatorial description of holographic entropy.From the perspective of entropy, the extremal geometries correspond to extreme rays of the holographic entropy cone.

        <p>At last, graph models are also the starting point for systematically generalizing the inclusion/exclusion proofs in [21,27], which had been used to establish the strong subadditivity and monogamy of the mutual information. To prove new inequalities, we furthermore introduce the concept of proofs by contraction. A proof of a holographic entropy inequality of the form l.h.s. ≥ r.h.s. is given by a cutting of the Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces of the l.h.s. and gluing of a subset of the resulting pieces into bounding surfaces for the Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces of the r.h.s. . We show that suitable maps on hypercubes describe this process in a purely combinatorial fashion; the ability to glue segments to obtain the r.h.s. is formalized as a contraction property. Using this criterion, we prove a new set of inequalities, revealing a hitherto unknown rich spectrum of entropic constraints in holographic theories.At last, graph models are also the starting point for systematically generalizing the inclusion/exclusion proofs in [21,27], which had been used to establish the strong subadditivity and monogamy of the mutual information.

        <p>Let A 1 , . . . , A n be n disjoint regions in the boundary field theory. For any non-empty subset I ⊆ [n],2 we may compute the entropy S(I) := S(A I ) of the corresponding composite boundary region A I = i∈I A i by using the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription (1.1). When A i itself has a boundary, its entanglement entropy is UV divergent and we need to to choose a cut-off; geometrically, this corresponds to cutting off the bulk time slice as to obtain a compact manifold with boundary. By listing the entropies of all these subsystems one after another, we obtain a holographic entropy vector (S(A I )) ∅ =I⊆[n] ∈ R 2 n -1 . For example, the entropy vector of a bipartite state is given by the triple (S(A), S(B), S(AB)), where A and B denote the boundary regions (cf. figure 1). Mathematically, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula makes sense for an arbitrary bulk manifold X, regardless of the existence a dual CFT state on its boundary, and it will be convenient to allow for this generalization. Thus we define the holographic entropy of a boundary region A ⊆ ∂X of an arbitrary bulk manifold X by (1.1).

        <p>Recall that any quantum state can be purified to a pure state on a larger system. Similarly, we may always add the region A n+1 = ∂X \ n i=1 A i , so that n+1 i=1 A i = ∂X. 3 We will call A n+1 the purifying region and oftentimes also denote it by O. We note that, with the purifying region added, the entropy of any boundary region then agrees with the entropy of its complement. This is because any Ryu-Takayanagi surface A for a boundary region A is simultaneously a Ryu-Takayanagi surface for A c = ∂X\A: if a is a bulk region such that ∂a = A∪A then ∂(X \a) = A c ∪A . In particular, S(I) = S(I c ) for all I ⊆ [n+1]. Our construction therefore reproduces the entropies of any purification of a CFT state corresponding to the bulk geometry X and boundary regions A 1 , . . . , A n (independent of whether this purification is geometric or not). In this way, we obtain an embedding C n → C n+1 of holographic entropy cones.

        <p>It is clear that the holographic entropy cone is left invariant by relabeling the boundary regions A 1 , . . . , A n of the bulk manifold X. Using the above operations, we can extend this to an action of the permutation group S n+1 by relabeling the n + 1 boundary regions obtained by adjoining the purifying region A n+1 . 4 This extended permutation symmetry is highly useful in revealing the combinatorial structure of the holographic entropy cones. For example, it is well-known that strong subadditivity, S(AB) + S(BC) ≥ S(B) + S(ABC), and weak monotonicity, S(AB) + S(BC) ≥ S(A) + S(C), can be identified via this symmetry even though they correspond to different faces of the entropy cone.

        <p>By duality, we may also apply entropy inequalities for n to n+1 regions and conversely. For example, the entropy inequality I(A : B) ≥ 0 for two regions can be applied to two regions of a three-party system, but also in the form I(A : BC) ≥ 0. And the strong subadditivity S(AB) + S(BC) ≥ S(B) + S(ABC) reduces to both subadditivity S(A) + S(C) ≥ S(AC) and the Araki-Lieb inequality S(AB) ≥ S(A) -S(B), depending on whether we set the B system to be trivial or apply strong subadditivity to the purification.By duality, we may also apply entropy inequalities for n to n+1 regions and conversely.

        <p>Our strategy for computing the holographic entropy cone then is the following: given a number of regions n, we first compute the extreme rays of the convex cone C n cut out by all inequalities obtained in the above way. Since all these inequalities are satisfied by holographic entropies, the cone C n contains the holographic entropy cone C n . For each extreme ray of C n , we then try to find a bulk geometry and boundary regions such that the associated entropy vector lies on this ray. If we succeed in doing so then convexity implies that, in fact, C n = C n . We have successfully implemented this strategy for n ≤ 4 boundary regions. That is, in each case, we find that the holographic entropy cone is cut out by strong subadditivity (2.1) and monogamy of the mutual information (2.2) (up to symmetry). In fact, the only instances of (2.1) that are required are the subadditivity inequality for single regions, S(A) + S(C) ≥ S(AC), and its permutations.

        <p>On the other hand, spacetimes with multiple boundaries are the natural setting for extreme ray geometries. In fact, there are extreme rays that cannot be realized as holographic JHEP09(2015)130 entropy vectors of geometries with a single connected boundary. Let us consider here a specific example, namely that of the extreme ray (2.4), where S A = S B = S C = S AB /2 = S AC /2 = S BC /2 = S ABC . While it is possible to get the finite pieces of the entanglement entropies to match in this fashion, matching the divergent pieces as well becomes much trickier. The requirement that the 1-body entropies are the same enforces that A, B and C all require the same number of boundaries, and the requirement that the 2-body entropies are twice the 1-body entropies requires that no two intervals that are part of A, B, or C are adjacent to each other. However, this immediately forces the number of boundaries of ABC to be three times that of A, meaning that there is no possible way to match the 3-body entropy with the 1-body entropy, unless we take the limit where the cutoff is of the same scale as the interval size, allowing for unphysical competition between the finite and divergent pieces.On the other hand, spacetimes with multiple boundaries are the natural setting for extreme ray geometries.

        <p>In this section we shall establish a converse to Lemma 3: for any graph model we will describe how to construct a bulk geometry and boundary regions such that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula reproduces the discrete entropies. From this we will be able to conclude that the graph model gives a completely equivalent combinatorial description of holographic entropy (see Theorem 5 below). The bulk geometry that we will construct will be a two-dimensional manifold, i.e. a surface, and we will require the bulk geometry to have constant negative curvature since this is a sufficient condition for the geometry to be holographically dual to a CFT state for which the Ryu-Takayanagi formula is applicable (see section 5 below). However, the construction can be easily generalized to higher dimension and we will comment on this in subsection 3.3 below. The construction goes as follows.

        <p>We will now show that for sufficiently negative scalar curvature, any minimizing cycle A is only composed of gluing geodesics. To see this, let γ be a simple closed geodesic that is not a gluing geodesic. Since neither a hyperbolic pair of pants nor a half-collar contain any simple closed geodesics apart from their boundaries, γ will necessarily intersect one of the gluing geodesics transversally. The lengths of the latter are by construction no larger than max := 4G N max e w(e). Thus the hyperbolic collar theorem (e.g., [34,Corollary 4.1.2]) asserts that the length γ of γ satisfiesWe will now show that for sufficiently negative scalar curvature, any minimizing cycle A is only composed of gluing geodesics.

The above discussion shows that we may restrict the minimization in the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for S(I) to cycles A that are composed of gluing geodesics. It is not hard to see that such a cycle A is homologous to A I if and only if the corresponding set of edges in the graph model is induced by a cut W ∪ W c = V . Since by construction the length of a gluing cycle is equal to 4G N times the weight of the corresponding edge, we JHEP09(2015)130 conclude that the Ryu-Takayanagi entropy S(I) indeed agrees with the discrete entropy S * (I).By choosing K sufficiently negative we can thus ensure that γ is larger than 4G N e w(e), the total length of all gluing geodesics.

Thus the resulting bulk inequality (4.6) holds for arbitrary cuts W 1 , . . . , W L and not only for minimal cuts that achieve the left-hand side discrete entropies. We record this general fact:</p>

        <p>Apart from (4.12), we have found several other holographic entropy inequalities to be valid, including the following: All the above inequalities, including (4.12), correspond to different facets of the entropy cone and are therefore independent. A feature of these inequalities (and the cyclic family of inequalities) is that they satisfy the following Bell condition: they are saturated for Bell pairs shared between any two regions A i and A j (including the purifying region). In particular, this implies that the inequalities are balanced, i.e., each region appears the same number of times on both sides of the inequality. Another interesting observation is that, in contrast to the situation for four and fewer regions, there are numerous extreme rays of C 5 which cannot be explained by star graphs (see figure 7 for one such an example). Thus the bulk geometry becomes increasingly important; the interior cycles can no longer be ignored for the purposes of minimization in the Ryu-Takayanagi formula (1.1).

        <p>The spacetime metric on the initial value surface cannot be chosen arbitrarily; the metric should satisfy the constraint equations. Moreover, if we want the Lorentzian-signature geometry to have a smooth analytic continuation to a Euclidean-signature geometry then the extrinsic curvature on the initial value surface should vanish [36]. This condition ensures that the entanglement entropy for a region on the boundary of the initial value surface is given by the Ryu-Takayanagi formula as opposed to the more general Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi formula [5]. The vanishing of the extrinsic curvature also simplifies the constraint equations. In particular, if we ignore matter fields and use the vacuum Einstein equations with cosmological constant, the constraint equations reduce to the condition that the scalar curvature of the induced metric on the initial value surface is constant. Therefore, any d-dimensional Riemannian manifold X with constant scalar curvature gives a consistent initial value condition for the vacuum Einstein equations in d+1 dimensions. The resulting solution is time-reversal symmetric in the neighborhood of the initial value surface and thus can be analytically continued to a Euclidean-signature metric, so that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula can be used to evaluate entanglement entropies. This is why in subsection 3.2 we constructed geometries with constant scalar curvature to realize the extreme rays of our holographic entropy cone.

Recent work by Susskind and Maldacena [24] has suggested that there is an equivalence between Einstein-Rosen wormholes (ER) and entangled Einstein-Rosen-Podolsky pairs (EPR). While this seems to be a sufficient language to discuss two-sided black holes, there is some evidence that a more general framework is needed to discuss multi-partite entanglement. Previous work by Balasubramanian et al. [22] has argued that there exist n-boundary black holes dual to CFT states with 'intrinsically n-partite' entanglement. That is, the states cannot be prepared by taking a tensor product of states that are strictly less than n-partite, suggesting that geometric wormholes are not best understood in terms of bipartite EPR pairs alone. Entropy cones provide a systematic framework for characterizing the entropies of multipartite entangled states. We may stratify the holographic entropy cones according to the minimal entanglement required to explain a given entropy vector. Thus the k-th stratum contains those holographic entropy vectors that can only be explained by k-partite (or higher) entanglement. By embedding quantum entropy cones for fewer regions as described in subsection 2.1, we may then obtain entropy inequalities for each k, whose violation demonstrates that the entanglement is at least (k + 1)-partite.

        <p>In graph theory, the cut function, which assigns to a cut the total weight of all edges that go across the cut, has long been known to be submodular, i.e., to satisfy strong subadditivity. As discussed in subsection 4.1, this is in a precise technical sense the discrete version of strong subadditivity of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. Submodular functions can be regarded as discrete analogues of convex functions and they play a natural role in combinatorial optimization. Our bulk inequalities (4.8) show that the cut function satisfies many further linear inequalities than were previously known. In contrast, not even monogamy appears to be known in this context, and it should be interesting to study the consequences.In graph theory, the cut function, which assigns to a cut the total weight of all edges that go across the cut, has long been known to be submodular, i.e., to satisfy strong subadditivity.

        <p>In the following we sketch the method for two-dimensional surfaces (however, we believe that the method can be extended to higher dimensions and made mathematically rigorous). To start, consider a Riemannian manifold with boundary (see figure 13,(a)). Any triangulation of the bulk manifold gives rise to a weighted graph, which we call a discretization of the geometry, where the weight of an edge in the triangulation is defined to be the geodesic distance of its endpoints in the geometry. Let us choose a very fine-grained triangulation of the bulk manifold. This triangulation should be such that any tangent vector of the manifold can be well-approximated by an edge of the graph. Then we can approximate the geodesic distance between any two points on the geometry by the weight of a shortest path connecting the corresponding two points on the graph. For example, the length of the minimal geodesic for region A in figure 13,(a) is well-approximated by the length of the path highlighted in the graph in figure 13,(b). 5 The final step is to construct the dual graph of the discretization. This is the graph obtained by adding vertices for all triangles of the original graph and edges between any two neighboring triangles. The weight of an edge in the dual graph is defined as the weight of the edge separating the triangles in the original graph, divided by 4G N (see figure 14 and figure 13,(c)). Indeed, while in the discretization the edge weights carry units of length, the edge weights in the dual graph represent entropy. We remark that the obtained graph is automatically trivalent at its bulk vertices. Now observe that any path on the original discretization of the geometry cuts a number of edges of the dual graph along its way. The total weight of these edges is by definition proportional to the length of the path. As an example, in figure 13,(c) we have highlighted the edges of the dual graph that are cut by the path in figure 13, (b). The total length of the former, divided by 4G N , equals the weight of the latter, which in turn approximates the entropy of region A. Thus it is easy to see that in general the weight of a minimal cut separating an arbitrary boundary region A from its complement is equal to the length of a shortest path on the original graph that is homologous to A, and therefore approximately equal to the entropy of A. We conclude that the dual graph constructed in this way approximates the holographic entropies of the given bulk geometry for any choice of boundary region.In the following we sketch the method for two-dimensional surfaces (however, we believe that the method can be extended to higher dimensions and made mathematically rigorous).

        <p>Proof. We first argue that f k is a contraction. As in the proof of Lemma 12, it suffices to show that f k (x)f k (x ) 1 ≤ 1 for x = x + 1. But since the permutation π k and the bitwise inversion are isometries, this is already proved in all cases except when x = 0 and x contains a single one. In the latter case, π -1 k (x ) likewise contains only a single one. In other words, there is a single block of 2k zeros, so that g k (π -1 k (x )) is the bitstring of all ones. It follows that f k (x ) = (0, 1), which has Hamming distance one from f k (x) = (0, 0). Therefore f k is indeed a contraction.Proof. We first argue that f k is a contraction.
