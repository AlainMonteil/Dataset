        <p>Recently it was conjectured that a certain infinite-dimensional "diagonal" subgroup of BMS supertranslations acting on past and future null infinity (I -and I + ) is an exact symmetry of the quantum gravity S-matrix, and an associated Ward identity was derived. In this paper we show that this supertranslation Ward identity is precisely equivalent to Weinberg's soft graviton theorem. Along the way we construct the canonical generators of supertranslations at I ± , including the relevant soft graviton contributions. Boundary conditions at the past and future of I ± and a correspondingly modified Dirac bracket are required. The soft gravitons enter as boundary modes and are manifestly the Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken supertranslation invariance.Recently it was conjectured that a certain infinite-dimensional "diagonal" subgroup of BMS supertranslations acting on past and future null infinity (I -and I + ) is an exact symmetry of the quantum gravity S-matrix, and an associated Ward identity was derived.

        <p>Weinberg's soft graviton theorem [1,2] is a universal formula relating any S-matrix element in any quantum theory including gravity to a second S-matrix element which differs only by the addition of a graviton whose four-momentum is taken to zero. Remarkably, the formula is blind to the spin or any other quantum numbers of the asymptotic particles involved in the S-matrix element.Weinberg's soft graviton theorem [1,2] is a universal formula relating any S-matrix element in any quantum theory including gravity to a second S-matrix element which differs only by the addition of a graviton whose four-momentum is taken to zero.

        <p>It is often the case that universal formulae are explained by symmetries.

        <p>The Ward identities following from the diagonal BMS supertranslations were expressed in [3] in terms of data at null infinity, namely the Bondi news representing gravitational radiation together with certain infrared modes. These are described in terms of their retarded times and positions on the asymptotic conformal sphere. The soft graviton theorem on the other hand is described [1,2] in terms of the scattering of momentum-space plane waves. The demonstration of this paper consists largely in transforming between these two different descriptions.The Ward identities following from the diagonal BMS supertranslations were expressed in [3] in terms of data at null infinity, namely the Bondi news representing gravitational radiation together with certain infrared modes.

        <p>In the course of our demonstration it is necessary to carefully define the physical phase spaces Γ ± of gravitational modes at past and future null infinity (I -and I + ). Γ ± must include, in addition to the Bondi news, all soft graviton degrees of freedom which do not decouple from the S-matrix. The latter we argue are constrained by boundary conditions at the boundaries of I ± . The soft modes can be viewed as living on these boundaries, and the boundary conditions reduce their number by a crucial factor of 2. The reduced space of modes may then be identified (from their transformation law) as nothing but the Goldstone modes of spontaneously broken supertranslation invariance. The relevant physical phase spaces Γ ± become simply the usual radiative modes plus the Goldstone modes. 1 The boundary constraint entails a modification of the naive Dirac bracket. After this modification canonical expressions for T ± are given which generate supertranslations on all of Γ ± . While there has been much discussion of T ± over the decades, the construction of generators which act properly on the infrared as well as radiative modes is new.In the course of our demonstration it is necessary to carefully define the physical phase spaces Γ ± of gravitational modes at past and future null infinity (I -and I + ).

        <p>This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we present the full I ± phase spaces Γ ± (including the boundary condition), present the Dirac brackets and supertranslation generators T ± and identify the soft gravitons as Goldstone modes. Section 3 reviews the proposed relation [3] between I + and I -near where they meet at spatial infinity, together with the diagonal supertranslations which preserve this relation and provide a symmetry of the S-matrix. Section 4 reviews the soft graviton theorem [1,2]. Section 5 describes the transformation between the asymptotic description of section 3 and the momentum space description of section 4. In section 6 we show that Weinberg's soft graviton theorem is the Ward identity following from diagonal supertranslation invariance.This paper is organized as follows.
