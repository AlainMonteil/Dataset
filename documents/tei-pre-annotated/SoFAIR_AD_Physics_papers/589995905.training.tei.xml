        <p>According to the Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmology, present-day galaxies with stellar masses M &gt; 10 11 M should contain a sizable fraction of dark matter within their stellar body. Models indicate that in massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) with M ≈ 1.5 × 10 11 M , dark matter should account for ∼15% of the dynamical mass within one effective radius (1 R e ) and for ∼60% within 5 R e . Most massive ETGs have been shaped through a two-phase process: the rapid growth of a compact core was followed by the accretion of an extended envelope through mergers. The exceedingly rare galaxies that have avoided the second phase, the so-called relic galaxies, are thought to be the frozen remains of the massive ETG population at z 2. The best relic galaxy candidate discovered to date is NGC 1277, in the Perseus cluster. We used deep integral field George and Cynthia Mitchel Spectrograph (GCMS) data to revisit NGC 1277 out to an unprecedented radius of 6 kpc (corresponding to 5 R e ). By using Jeans anisotropic modelling, we find a negligible dark matter fraction within 5 R e ( f DM (5 R e ) &lt; 0.05; two-sigma confidence level), which is in tension with the ΛCDM expectation. Since the lack of an extended envelope would reduce dynamical friction and prevent the accretion of an envelope, we propose that NGC 1277 lost its dark matter very early or that it was dark matter deficient ab initio. We discuss our discovery in the framework of recent proposals, suggesting that some relic galaxies may result from dark matter stripping as they fell in and interacted within galaxy clusters. Alternatively, NGC 1277 might have been born in a high-velocity collision of gas-rich proto-galactic fragments, where dark matter left behind a disc of dissipative baryons. We speculate that the relative velocities of ≈2000 km s -1 required for the latter process to happen were possible in the progenitors of the present-day rich galaxy clusters.According to the Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmology, present-day galaxies with stellar masses M &gt; 10 11 M should contain a sizable fraction of dark matter within their stellar body.

However, recent computational studies assuming a Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmology indicate that nature borrows from both scenarios and that the actual massive ETG formation process can be broadly divided into two phases (Naab et al. 2009;Oser et al. 2010;Johansson et al. 2012;Lackner et al. 2012;Zolotov et al. 2015;Rodriguez-Gomez et al. 2016). At first, the massive ETG progenitors suffer a dissipative collapse that results in a compact rotating object (known as a blue nugget) whose star formation is rapidly quenched (Huang et al. 2013;Dekel &amp; Burkert 2014;Zolotov et al. 2015;Martín-Navarro et al. 2019;Lapiner et al. 2023), perhaps due to active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback (e.g. Choi et al. 2018). During the second phase, the passive evolution of the stellar population turns the blue nugget into a red one, and most of the growth of the stellar mass of the object comes from the accretion of an extended pressure-supported envelope through dry accretion.The reduced spectra and the information necessary to reconstruct the kinematic maps presented in this paper are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr (130.79.128.5) or via https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/ 675/A143 fell out of fashion with the advent of hierarchical formation models within a cold dark matter cosmology (White &amp; Rees 1978;Klypin &amp; Shandarin 1983).

        <p>This simplified two-phase formation narrative is supported by observations indicating that passively evolving galaxies at high redshift were much more compact than local massive ETGs (Daddi et al. 2005;Zirm et al. 2007;Cimatti et al. 2008;Toft et al. 2017;Kubo et al. 2018), and they have grown by a factor of roughly four in effective radius since redshift z ∼ 2 (Trujillo et al. 2006(Trujillo et al. , 2007;;Buitrago et al. 2008;van der Wel et al. 2011;Szomoru et al. 2012). Further credence to this framework is given by the fact that stellar envelopes have been shown to grow with cosmic time (Damjanov et al. 2011;Ryan et al. 2012;van der Wel et al. 2014;Bai et al. 2014;Buitrago et al. 2017). Also, the recently identified compact, starforming, and presumably rotating ultra-red flattened objects (Nelson et al. 2023) could be dust-shrouded blue nuggets, which would give additional evidence for the two-phase formation scenario.This simplified two-phase formation narrative is supported by observations indicating that passively evolving galaxies at high redshift were much more compact than local massive ETGs (Daddi et al. 2005;Zirm et al. 2007;Cimatti et al. 2008;Toft et al. 2017;Kubo et al. 2018), and they have grown by a factor of roughly four in effective radius since redshift z ∼ 2 (Trujillo et al. 2006(Trujillo et al. , 2007;;Buitrago et al. 2008;van der Wel et al. 2011;Szomoru et al. 2012).

        <p>Both models and observations indicate that red nuggets are the evolved remnants of the infant massive galaxies, offering a sneak peek at the epoch at which the first giant galaxies assembled, at z 2. Since red nuggets are expected to survive within at least a fraction of massive galaxies (Pulsoni et al. 2021), they can be examined and resolved in nearby galaxies. However, this often comes at the expense of suffering contamination from the envelope. Local red nuggets embedded within elliptical or even disc galaxies have been studied through structural decompositions (Huang et al. 2013;Graham et al. 2015;de la Rosa et al. 2016;Costantin et al. 2021) and resolved stellar populations (Yıldırım et al. 2017;Martín-Navarro et al. 2018;Ferré-Mateu et al. 2019;Barbosa et al. 2021). Also, some red nuggets could be identified with the kinematically decoupled components (KDCs) often observed in the central regions of slow rotator ETGs (see review by Cappellari 2016). Cleaner nuggets can be studied at intermediate and high z (e.g. Damjanov et al. 2009Damjanov et al. , 2013Damjanov et al. , 2014;;van Dokkum et al. 2009;Auger et al. 2011;Stockton et al. 2014;Hsu et al. 2014;Saulder et al. 2015;Oldham et al. 2017;Charbonnier et al. 2017;Buitrago et al. 2018;Scognamiglio et al. 2020;Spiniello et al. 2021a,b;Lisiecki et al. 2023;D'Ago et al. 2023), but the price to pay is to suffer cosmological dimming and poor angular resolution.Both models and observations indicate that red nuggets are the evolved remnants of the infant massive galaxies, offering a sneak peek at the epoch at which the first giant galaxies assembled, at z 2.

        <p>Local red nuggets that have somehow avoided accreting an envelope are therefore key to accessing good-quality uncontaminated data from the progenitors of massive ETGs. They constitute snapshots of galaxies that have evolved passively, and whose growth stopped at a freezing redshift z f &gt; 1. Such galaxies are exceedingly rare (see the number density estimates in Quilis &amp; Trujillo 2013) and have been named 'relic galaxies' since the study by Trujillo et al. (2009). Ironically, no relic galaxy was found in the study defining them. Later searches were more successful, and nowadays a few tens of candidates and spectroscopically confirmed relics are known (Trujillo et al. 2014;Ferré-Mateu et al. 2015, 2017;Spiniello et al. 2021a,b).Local red nuggets that have somehow avoided accreting an envelope are therefore key to accessing good-quality uncontaminated data from the progenitors of massive ETGs.

        <p>The detailed study of NGC 1277 has provided unique insight into the extreme conditions under which nuggets grow. Martín-Navarro et al. (2015) found that the initial mass function (IMF) of NGC 1277 is bottom-heavy throughout the galaxy, which implies a large stellar mass-to-light ratio Υ , as confirmed by Yıldırım et al. (2015). Similar although slightly less extreme properties have also been confirmed for two more relic galaxies (Ferré-Mateu et al. 2017). Also, dynamical modelling has unveiled that virtually no dark matter is necessary to explain the stellar kinematics in the innermost 13 of NGC 1277 (Yıldırım et al. 2015).The detailed study of NGC 1277 has provided unique insight into the extreme conditions under which nuggets grow.

        <p>NGC 1277 is a fast rotator, a property that is common among compact ETGs (Yıldırım et al. 2017). It is found in a cluster environment, which is in agreement with the expectations for relic galaxies from some cosmological simulations (Stringer et al. 2015;Peralta de Arriba et al. 2016) and observational findings (Poggianti et al. 2013;Buitrago et al. 2018;Baldry et al. 2021). The reason for this environmental preference has been posited to be that the high relative velocities between cluster galaxies are efficient at preventing prolonged interactions. However, other evolutionary pathways are also possible (see Buitrago et al. 2018;Tortora et al. 2020, for more details).NGC 1277 is a fast rotator, a property that is common among compact ETGs (Yıldırım et al. 2017).

        <p>NGC 1277 was originally reported to have an unexpectedly massive black hole with M BH = 17 × 10 9 M from Schwarzschild dynamical modelling based on rather low spatial resolution long-slit data (van den Bosch et al. 2012, assumed distance of d = 73 Mpc). However, a reanalysis of the same data by Emsellem (2013, d = 73 Mpc) using an N-body particle realisation based on the Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM; Cappellari 2008) formalism suggested that the black hole was likely overestimated and proposed M BH ≈ 5 × 10 9 M . This lower value of M BH was later confirmed with higher spatial resolution integral field data from both Schwarzschild (Walsh et al. 2016, d = 71 Mpc) and JAM models (Krajnović et al. 2018). Even the lower black hole mass estimates place NGC 1277 more than one order of magnitude above the scaling relations linking the mass of the black hole with the luminosity of the spheroid (the M BH -L relation; Gültekin et al. 2009;Sani et al. 2011), but would be consistent with the M BH -σ relation (Ferrarese &amp; Merritt 2000;Gebhardt et al. 2000) for a stellar velocity dispersion of 400 km s -1 at the centre of the galaxy (van den Bosch et al. 2012). A possible explanation for the M BH -L anomaly in NGC 1277 is that the black hole assembly occurs chiefly during the early collapse phase, with little to no mass increase during the envelope growth period (Trujillo et al. 2014;Ferré-Mateu et al. 2015, 2017). Since the scaling relations are established using mostly ETGs that have undergone an envelope growth, NGC 1277 would naturally have a lower mass than regular massive ETGs hosting black holes with a similar mass. Another possibility is that the central black hole in NGC 1277 was captured. Indeed, NGC 1275, which is the central dominant elliptical in the Perseus cluster, has an undermassive black hole. It has been postulated that a former black hole sitting at the centre of NGC 1275 might have been lost due to recoil during a black hole fusion and ended up being captured by NGC 1277 (Shields &amp; Bonning 2013). Alternatively, the mass of the central black hole in NGC 1277 might have been overestimated and be as low as M BH = 1.2 × 10 9 M (Graham et al. 2016) due to the degeneracy between the black hole mass and Υ in the central parts of the galaxy (see also Emsellem 2013).NGC 1277 was originally reported to have an unexpectedly massive black hole with M BH = 17 × 10 9 M from Schwarzschild dynamical modelling based on rather low spatial resolution long-slit data (van den Bosch et al. 2012, assumed distance of d = 73 Mpc).

        <p>We revisit NGC 1277 with new deep spectroscopic data obtained with the George and Cynthia Mitchell Spectrograph (GCMS), an integral field spectrograph at the 2.7 m Harlan J.

This is critical to explore the outskirts of the galaxy, where dark matter is expected to contribute the most to the mass budget, and test the claims that a dark matter halo is not required to describe the stellar kinematics. An additional advantage of our dataset is that the field of view simultaneously covers NGC 1278, a regular massive ETG in the Perseus cluster with a mass similar to that of NGC 1277. Thus, we can study a compact relic galaxy alongside more extended object that has an envelope that has probably been accreted (as indicated by the age, metallicity, and abundance gradients obtained from an analysis of the stellar populations; companion paper Ferré-Mateu et al., in prep.) with exactly the same instrumental setup, enabling a straightforward comparison of their properties. In order to mitigate the coarse GCMS ∼4 angular resolution and better constrain the kinematics in the vicinity of the central black hole, we are complementing our data with kinematics of the inner 1 . 6 × 1 . 6 of NGC 1277 obtained by Walsh et al.

The observations were made with the VP1 grism and covered the 4400 Å-6800 Å spectral range with a spectral resolution of 5.3 Å.

        <p>Ten three-point dither datasets were taken, each with an exposure time of 900 s per dither for a total of 9000 s (2.5 h) per position. Throughout the acquisition, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the seeing varied between 1 . 7 and 3 . 5. Only one of the datasets had a seeing above 2 . 8. We checked that ignoring the latter dataset did not improve the quality of the recovered kinematics.Ten three-point dither datasets were taken, each with an exposure time of 900 s per dither for a total of 9000 s (2.5 h) per position.

        <p>The basic data reduction (bias subtraction, flat frame correction, and wavelength calibration) was performed using P3D 2 (Sandin et al. 2010). The sky emission of the ten datasets was estimated by computing the median spectrum of a few handpicked sky fibres. After the sky subtraction, the datasets were flux-calibrated using IRAF (Tody 1986) and combined to produce a final science-ready data product with a single spectrum for each of the 738 fibre locations (from now on and for the sake of brevity, we simply call them fibres) in the field of view. We cropped the reddest portion of the spectrum, above the rest frame 6650 Å, to avoid some calibration problems on that portion of the spectrum. Nine fibres in the south-eastern corner of the field of view have problematic spectra and were excluded from further analysis. Figure 1 shows maps of the median spectral intensity and the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per spectral pixel of 1.1 Å. The S/N was obtained by estimating the noise with the DER_SNR algorithm by Stoehr et al. (2008) and comparing it to the median intensity.The basic data reduction (bias subtraction, flat frame correction, and wavelength calibration) was performed using P3D 2 (Sandin et al. 2010).

        <p>The kinematics of the field were obtained with pPXF3 (Cappellari &amp; Emsellem 2004;Cappellari 2022). This code fits the spectra with a linear combination of spectral energy distribution templates convolved with a line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD). The templates were drawn from the E-MILES single stellar population models4 (Vazdekis et al. 2015), which uses the MILES (Sánchez-Blázquez et al. 2006;Falcón-Barroso et al. 2011) and CaT (Cenarro et al. 2007) stellar templates. We used the models with a Kroupa initial mass function (Kroupa 2001) and BaSTI isochrones (Pietrinferni et al. 2004(Pietrinferni et al. , 2006(Pietrinferni et al. , 2009(Pietrinferni et al. , 2013;;Cordier et al. 2007), but the choice of a specific library plays little effect in the precise determination of the kinematics. To speed up the processing, we excluded the templates that, a priori, would not describe a massive ETG, that is those with low metallicity ([Z/H] &lt; -0.35) and young ages (&lt;1 Gyr). We have tested that producing the fits with the complete MILES model library would not introduce significant changes in the derived kinematics. We only fitted the first two momenta of the LOSVD, that is the mean recession velocity and the velocity dispersion [v, σ]. The characterisation of higher-order momenta requires high-S/N data, which would go against our goal of covering as much of NGC 1277 as possible. In some lines of sight, two objects appear in projection, so their spectra should be fitted with two sets of templates with distinct kinematics. This is why each spectrum was at first fitted with single sets of templates with initial values [v = 5066 km s -1 , σ = 250 km s -1 ] (corresponding to the redshift z = 0.016898 of NGC 1277; Falco et al. 1999), [v = 6066 km s -1 , σ = 250 km s -1 ] (roughly the velocity of NGC 1278), [v = 4066 km s -1 , σ = 50 km s -1 ] (the velocity of a small galaxy overlapping with part of the western side of NGC 1277; see Fig. 1), and [v = -34 km s -1 , σ = 50 km s -1 ] (this is a velocity compatible with that of Galactic objects and it was chosen so to describe foreground stars), and with pairs of sets of templates combining the above initial values. The best fit was chosen based on the chi-squared values after penalising by a factor 1.1 fits with two sets of templates.

        <p>Because of the large angular size of the fibres compared to the size of NGC 1277, we had to devise a method to pinpoint the centre of the galaxy in the CGMS data.

        <p>The simultaneous registration of the two galaxies led to small systematics in the ratio (F GCMS,i -F HST,i )/F GCMS,i , indicating small inaccuracies in the coordinates of either the GCMS fibres or the HST pixels. As a consequence, we redid the registration by processing the two galaxies separately (using the F625W image for NGC 1277). Because a few fibres have a very different photometry from that of the matched HST apertures, we introduced a two sigma clipping to remove the outliers in (F GCMS,i -F HST,i )/F GCMS,i . The separate registration of the two galaxies resulted in centres that are ≈0 . 5 and ≈1 . 0 away from those obtained from a joint registration for NGC 1277 and NGC 1278, respectively. In Figs. 4 and5, we show the relative differences of the GCMS fluxes and those derived from the matched apertures in the HST images. The residuals are generally at a level of ∼10% except at the very centre. We checked whether the latter discrepancies could be reduced by fine-tuning the seeing used for blurring the HST images, but failed to find a value leading to a significant improvement. This might either indicate that the Gaussian shape assumed for the point spread function (PSF) is too simplistic or a non-linearity in the behaviour of the GCMS.The simultaneous registration of the two galaxies led to small systematics in the ratio (F GCMS,i -F HST,i )/F GCMS,i , indicating small inaccuracies in the coordinates of either the GCMS fibres or the HST pixels.

Point sources, overlapping galaxies were manually masked. The HST images reveal that both galaxies have a tiny circumnuclear dust ring smaller than 1 in radius which is visually similar to some of those described in Lauer et al. (2005) and Comerón et al. (2010). The ring in NGC 1277 has already been reported by van den Bosch et al. (2012) and Emsellem (2013). The near side of those rings was masked too. The major axis position angles were extracted by averaging the orientation of the tilted rings over radial ranges where it is roughly flat (3 ≤ R ≤ 10 for NGC 1277 and 4 ≤ R ≤ 20 for NGC 1278). We find the position angles PA = 92 • .9 and PA = 87 • .8 for NGC 1277 and NGC 1278, respectively (Fig. 6).

Figure 7 displays the rotation and the velocity dispersion curves for NGC 1277 in black (left panels). The profiles for NGC 1278 are also shown for reference. As a sanity check to assess the quality of our kinematic determination we also plot the previous long-slit measurements of NGC 1277 from Ferré-Mateu et al. (2017) in crimson (right panels). We find a smaller amplitude of the velocity curve than them. This is most likely because, while they explore a relatively narrow slit along the major axis of the galaxy (1 . 0 in width Martín- Navarro et al. 2015), our resolution element is 4 . 16 in radius, so it gathers light from regions with a significant tangential motion of the stars. Our σ profile agrees with that in Ferré-Mateu et al. ( 2017) except for the central peak which we are missing, most likely due to beam smearing. In principle, a small increase in the sigma of the disc is to be expected in our data because within each fibre we are sampling separated regions with different velocities.

To model this galaxy, we instead used the ACS F850LP image with a correction A F850LP = 0.205 mag and corrected for cosmological dimming.

        <p>We did not account for the PSF mismatch because both bands have a Gaussian kernel with a very similar FWHM (0 . 086 and 0 . 090 for F475W and F850LP, respectively as estimated with IRAF's imexamine). We applied the mass-to-light ratio map to the F475W image to obtain the mass surface density map. We considered an absolute solar magnitude of M g = 5.11 mag (Willmer 2018). Because of the strong evidence for a bottom-heavy IMF in red nuggets (Martín-Navarro et al. 2015;Ferré-Mateu et al. 2017), which is consistent with the tendency for the densest galaxies to have the heaviest IMF (Fig. 12 in Cappellari et al. 2013b), the mass density map was corrected from a Chabrier to a Salpeter (1955) IMF with the following recipe from Cimatti et al. (2008) log (M ) (Salpeter) = log (M ) (Chabrier) + 0.23.We did not account for the PSF mismatch because both bands have a Gaussian kernel with a very similar FWHM (0 . 086 and 0 . 090 for F475W and F850LP, respectively as estimated with IRAF's imexamine).

We fixed the major axis of the MGE components to correspond to those of the kinematic axes measured in Sect. 3.1.

More recently, JAM was compared in detail against the Schwarzschild (1979) method using samples of both observed galaxies, with circular velocities from interferometric observations of the CO gas, and numerical simulations respectively. These studies consistently found that the JAM method produces even more accurate (smaller scatter versus the true values) density profiles (Fig. 8 in Leung et al. 2018) and enclosed masses (Fig. 4 in Jin et al. 2019) than the more general Schwarzschild models. This may be due to the JAM assumption acting as an empirically motivated prior and reducing the degeneracies of the dynamical inversion.

For most of the parameters, we refined the bounds of the fitting range after running the fit several times and examining the posterior probability distributions. In other cases, the boundaries come from physical limitations. For example, M BH and f DM (6 kpc) cannot be smaller than zero. Also, the intrinsic axial ratio of the flattest MGE component cannot be larger than the projected one, setting an upper boundary q min = q min . Finally, to avoid unphysically thin components, we assume a minimum possible axial ratio for the flattest component at q min = 0.05. In order to calculate the mass of spherical dark matter halo MGEs within a specific radius we used the following expression from Cappellari (2008, Eq. ( 49))A143, page 11 of 30 Comerón, S., et al.: A&amp;A 675, A143 (2023) We adopted constant priors on all parameters during the adamet Bayesian modelling. For most of the parameters, we refined the bounds of the fitting range after running the fit several times and examining the posterior probability distributions. In other cases, the boundaries come from physical limitations. For example, M BH and f DM (6 kpc) cannot be smaller than zero.

For the NIFS data the situation is more complicated, because the data points correspond to the centre of Voronoi bins with variable size. We set the pixel size to the native value for NIFS, 0 . 05, because the data for the central region of NGC 1277 (the most sensitive to the black hole dynamics) has enough signal to remain unbinned.

        <p>A. Successively fit the NIFS and the GCMS data: We first fitted the NIFS data (A1; Fig. 12). Since the field of view of the instrument only covers the inner 0.5 kpc of NGC 1277, we assumed the dynamical effect of dark matter to be negligible and fixed f DM (6 kpc) = 0. Indeed, the dark matter fraction within 0.5 kpc expected for a dark matter halo typical of a galaxy with the mass of NGC 1277 (see Sect. 5.2) is ∼0.5%. Then, we fitted the GCMS data with the black hole mass M BH fixed to the value obtained in A1 (A2; Fig. 13). The rationale for this is that the black hole sphere of influence (Peebles 1972) is small compared to the field of view covered by the GCMS data (∼130 pc or ∼0 . 4 for a M BH = 5 × 10 9 M and for a central velocity dispersion σ = 400 km s -1 ) and we should not expect the latter to help constraining the black hole mass. When fitting for black hole masses with JAM, it is always recommended to restrict the field of view to the smallest region required to break the M/Lblack hole degeneracy (e.g. Thater et al. 2022) not to risk biasing the black hole mass due to gradients in the velocity ellipsoid and the mismatch parameter, or due the choice of a parametrisation for the dark matter halo. In other words, a good global fit might be reached at the expense of a poor fit of the central region, resulting in a bad determination of the black hole mass. This approach is very different from the one usually employed with Schwarzschild models, which need large radii kinematics to constrain the orbital distribution and reduce degeneracies in the black hole mass.A.

        <p>We denote fits made assuming a cylindrically aligned velocity ellipsoid with a 'c' prefix, and those with a spherically oriented one with an 's'. As discussed in Cappellari (2020), no single alignment holds for a full galaxy. A cylindrically oriented ellipsoid is only found in the case of a plane-parallel potential, whereas a spherically oriented one is found for a strictly spherical one. Nevertheless, a cylindrically oriented ellipsoid is a rather good approximation for a disc, especially close to the mid-plane (Cappellari et al. 2007;Cappellari 2008). Since the Schwarzschild (1979) dynamical modelling by Yıldırım et al.

        <p>It is noteworthy that the high angular resolution NIFS data do not seem to be required to obtain a reasonable order of magnitude estimate of the black hole mass.

This means that, contrary to the case of NGC 1277, we lack high angular resolution data able to provide tight constraints on the black hole mass. For these fits we followed two approaches: A.

(2019) relating the black hole mass to the total stellar mass of elliptical galaxies (the plot for fit A is not shown). By introducing the total stellar mass M = 2.9 × 10 11 M (Sect. 3.2) we obtained M BH = 1.5 × 10 9 M . However, because the residual mean square of the relation is 0.48 dex, M BH is expected to be in the rather large range between M BH ≈ 5 × 10 8 M and M BH ≈ 5 × 10 9 M . Alternatively, we could have used the M BH -σ relation. Assuming the expression in Eq.

Our fiducial fit sB (Fig. 16) yields a significant fraction of dark matter within 6 kpc, f DM (6 kpc) = 0.14 ± 0.04. This fraction does not change if we keep the black hole mass fixed (fit sA).

        <p>Contrarily to NGC 1277, where f DM (6 kpc) was consistently found to be negligible irrespective of the kind of fit, the fraction of dark matter within 6 kpc in NGC 1278 is found to vary depending on whether a cylindrically or a spherically aligned velocity ellipsoid is assumed. The former orientation yields dark matter fractions f DM (6 kpc) = 0.02-0.04 and the latter have f DM (6 kpc) = 0.10-0.15. Fits with low f DM (6 kpc) compensate the lack of dark matter by increasing the baryonic mass through an increase in α from α ≈ 1.1-1.2 (slightly larger than that expected for a Salpeter IMF) to up to α ≈ 1.3 (indicating a bottom-heavy IMF comparable to that obtained for NGC 1277). For our fiducial fit, a zero dark matter fraction is disfavoured at a more than four-sigma level, but a strong covariance is seen between α and f DM (6 kpc) (Fig. 16). Hence, an independent determination of α would be desirable in order to confirm the presence of a significant dark matter fraction. Such evidence was obtained from line index indicators, showing a much bottomlighter IMF in NGC 1278 than in NGC 1277 (Ferré-Mateu et al., in prep.).Contrarily to NGC 1277, where f DM (6 kpc) was consistently found to be negligible irrespective of the kind of fit, the fraction of dark matter within 6 kpc in NGC 1278 is found to vary depending on whether a cylindrically or a spherically aligned velocity ellipsoid is assumed.

        <p>Figure 17 shows the radial V rms profile. The agreement between the observation and the fit in the central region (R 15 ) is remarkable. At larger radii, the error bars in V rms for the individual fibres becomes as large as a few tens of km s -1 , which causes a large scatter. Yet, the fit passes roughly through the middle of the data cloud. The reason why such data points with large error bars are not abundantly found for NGC 1277 is the abruptness of the surface brightness profile, which causes the radial range of fibres with barely acceptable kinematic fits to be very narrow.Figure 17 shows the radial V rms profile.

        <p>In Fig. 18 we plot the stellar mass-to-light ratio at F625W as a function of the radius for NGC 1277 and NGC 1278. Here we define Υ r as the ratio of the circularised surface density and the surface brightness MGE models corrected (multiplied) by the mismatch parameter. The right axis indicates the corresponding absolute value of the outer exponent of a bimodal IMF, Γ b , obtained from the E-MILES photometric predictions for a stellar population with age 13.0 Gyr, metallicity [Z/H] = 0.26 (this is roughly valid for NGC 1277 only, because NGC 1278 is slightly younger and less metallic; Ferré-Mateu et al., in prep.). If the mismatch parameter, α, were constant with radius as assumed in the JAM fits, the wiggles in Υ would imply a genuine variation of the mass-to-light ratio. However, the observed changes in Γ b , are a combination of real variations driven by small radial changes in α, and apparent variations due to small radial trends of the stellar population age and abundances. Nevertheless, it is reassuring to see that the estimated Γ b index for NGC 1277 falls within the range of values obtained in Martín- Navarro et al. (2015) and Ferré-Mateu et al. (2017). In NGC 1278, Υ is systematically lower than in NGC 1277 at all radii.

        <p>The discrepancy between the fitted and the expected dark matter fraction for NGC 1277 arises from a combination of several factors. The extreme compactness of NGC 1277 might make it baryon-dominated over most of the disc, so it may become hard to characterise the dynamical effects of the underlying dark matter distribution. Also, the reported formal error bars ignore the systematics that might be introduced by the hypotheses used in the Jeans modelling (such as the use of a single mismatch parameter across the whole galaxy). However, those systematics are probably small because if the fitted parameters are robust against changes in the assumed velocity ellipsoid (as it occurs for f DM (6 kpc)), they can be assumed to be reliable (Cappellari 2020). The result is also robust against changes in the positioning of the galaxy centre and the estimated distance.The discrepancy between the fitted and the expected dark matter fraction for NGC 1277 arises from a combination of several factors.

        <p>If two galaxies have the same dark matter halo and the same stellar mass, the most compact one has the smallest f DM (R e ). We colour-coded the symbols in Fig. 21 according to their R e to check whether galaxies with a small f DM (R e ) are exclusively compact (R e ≈ 1 kpc). We find that galaxies with a small f DM (R e ) A143, page 21 of 30 can be relatively extended (with effective radii of a few kpc), and that some compact galaxies have a non-negligible central dark matter fraction. Therefore, the reason why Cappellari et al. (2013a) and Santucci et al. (2022) find galaxies with f DM (R e ) ≈ 0 cannot be solely the compactness of the objects. Instead, these small f DM (R e ) values are likely because the fraction of dark matter within 1 R e is so small, that it becomes hard to constrain it. Indeed, ATLAS 3D was designed to observe galaxies out to 1 R e (Cappellari et al. 2011) and most of the Santucci et al. (2022) galaxies are covered out to less than 2 R e (see their Fig. 1). Figure 4 in Cappellari et al. (2015) illustrates this point by showing that, whereas the stellar and the total mass profiles of massive ETGs do not differ much in the inner 1 R e , the stellar density profile falls much faster than the total one in the outskirts. Hence, our large radial coverage (5 R e for NGC 1277 and 2.5 R e for NGC 1278) ensures a precision in the characterisation of the dark matter component that cannot be achieved if we are limited to the inner 1-2 R e .If two galaxies have the same dark matter halo and the same stellar mass, the most compact one has the smallest f DM (R e ).

        <p>As NGC 1277 is very compact compared to a typical galaxy of its mass (1.2 kpc versus 5.5 kpc from the M -R e relation derived from Trujillo et al. 2020), the lack of dark matter within 5 R e could be interpreted as a consequence of the high density of the stellar component.

        <p>The tension between the measured dark matter fraction and the predictions would pose a challenge for ΛCDM if NGC 1277 were found to be incompatible with being a statistical outlier. According to Quilis &amp; Trujillo (2013), relic galaxies (defined as those that have grown less than 10% in mass through mergers) are expected to be today one in one thousand among massive galaxies with M &gt; 8 × 10 10 M . Assuming a normal distribution, relic galaxies would be 3.3-σ outliers of the distribution. If we use this number to gauge the level of tension between the measured dark matter fraction in NGC 1277 and that predicted from the simulations, we find that the answer depends on whether the dark matter fraction is measured within a given physical scale or within a given number of effective radii. Whereas in the former case NGC 1277 might be compatible with being a statistical outlier (the upper two-sigma limit of the dark matter fraction in NGC 1277 is close to the lower two-sigma limit of the expectation), in the latter one there is a strong (more than 5σ) tension. Given that we lack a clear-cut answer about the relevant radius within which the dark matter fraction should be measured, we are refraining from speculating whether the tension observed for NGC 1277 challenges the current cosmological paradigm.The tension between the measured dark matter fraction and the predictions would pose a challenge for ΛCDM if NGC 1277 were found to be incompatible with being a statistical outlier.

        <p>We have found evidence that, in addition to being the best massive relic candidate in the local Universe, NGC 1277 is dark matter deficient (it has a fraction of dark matter within 5 R e of less than 5% at a two sigma confidence level, whereas the expected value is ∼60%; Sect. 5.3 and Fig. 22). The principle of parsimony suggests that the two oddities have a common cause (or that one is the consequence of the other). However, another relic, Mrk 1216 (Ferré-Mateu et al. 2017), has been found to contain a significant fraction of dark matter within R e (Yıldırım et al. 2015;Buote &amp; Barth 2019). The situation poses a conundrum: either (1) relic galaxies can form with largely different dark matter contents, or (2) NGC 1277 and Mrk 1216 are different kinds of objects born and/or evolved under different circumstances. The latter possibility is supported by the work by Ferré-Mateu et al. (2017), who found Mrk 1216 to be the galaxy with the smallest 'degree of relic' (that is, the one that is the most similar to a regular ETG) among their three-galaxy sample (which includes NGC 1277). They also found that the burst of star formation that generated the bulk of the baryonic mass in Mrk 1216 was more extended in time than for the other galaxies in the sample, as well as traces of recent accretion.

        <p>If it is possible for a few rare galaxies not to have dark matter, it becomes easy to explain why they do not undergo the envelope accretion phase. In the absence of a halo, nearby galaxies undergo parabolic flybys instead of spiralling-in due to dynamical friction (Chandrasekhar 1943). This hypothesis would hold even if we had underestimated f DM (5 R e ), because the stripping of the outskirts of the halo (see discussion below) would still be a plausible mechanism to explain the lack of accretion. On the other hand, regular massive ETGs like NGC 1278 are effective at cannibalising small dark matter rich-galaxies, which impacts both R e and f DM (e.g. Hilz et al. 2012;Tortora &amp; Napolitano 2022). If we assume that the lack of an envelope in NGC 1277 is due to a dark matter deficiency, it must have either lost its dark matter early (before significant accretion occurred) or was dark matter deficient ab initio. Hence, the big question about NGC 1277 shifts from 'how did it avoid to accrete an envelope?' to 'why is it dark matter deficient?'.If it is possible for a few rare galaxies not to have dark matter, it becomes easy to explain why they do not undergo the envelope accretion phase.

        <p>If dynamical friction were suppressed in NGC 1277, it would be extremely unlikely that its central black hole were accreted as suggested by Shields &amp; Bonning (2013). The relatively large mass of the central black hole in NGC 1277 should be then attributed to the fact that the black hole-related scaling relations are established based on galaxies that have accreted an envelope. Indeed, present-day regular massive ETGs are significantly more massive than they were in their blue nugget phase.If dynamical friction were suppressed in NGC 1277, it would be extremely unlikely that its central black hole were accreted as suggested by Shields &amp; Bonning (2013).

They used the TNG50 cosmological simulation to identify five relic analogues, of which the one residing in subhalo 6 is the purest and the most similar to NGC 1277. The simulated galaxy is born in isolation within a massive ∼10 12 M dark matter halo that is significantly stripped as it enters a cluster. As the galaxy loses most (∼90%) of its dark matter, it also leaves behind most of its gas, which prevents further star formation from happening. During this process, the stellar body of the galaxy remains mostly intact, as it loses only about 20% of its mass. The resulting galaxy has 1.4 times more mass in dark matter than in stars (Flores-Freitas et al. 2022), and virtually all the dark matter outside a radius of 30 kpc has been stripped away (Flore-Freitas, priv. comm.). This phenomenon is similar to the stripping of dark matter of satellites as they interact with their main galaxy (Engler et al. 2021). Moreno et al. (2022) also explored simulated dwarf satellite galaxies that lose most of their dark matter as they have a close interaction with their parent galaxy. They proposed that in such events the stellar component is harder to remove than the dark matter one because stellar orbits are more circular than those of dark matter particles. Hence, repeated interactions would be efficient at stripping dark matter particles when they are close to their apocentre.A possible way to generate a dark matter-poor galaxy that resembles a massive relic was proposed by Flores-Freitas et al.

        <p>The main caveat of the Flores-Freitas et al. ( 2022) scenario is given by the authors themselves. Indeed, as subhalo 6 falls within the cluster, the apparent stripping might in part be caused by some of the material being assigned to the parent halo. Thus, the mass loss could be an artefact introduced by the algorithm assigning particles to the different dark matter haloes. Another problem is that, whereas the outer parts of the halo are efficiently stripped, the dark matter mass within the inner 6 kpc diminishes by a factor of less than two (Flores-Freitas; priv. comm.), so the mechanism does not seem sufficient to remove most of the dark matter from the central parts of the galaxy. On the other hand, the stripping of the outer parts of the halo would probably be sufficient to greatly reduce dynamical friction and perhaps prevent the accretion of an envelope. A possible way around all these caveats is that subhalo 6 contains the best relic analogue within the TNG50 volume, but this volume of 1.4 × 10 5 Mpc 3 is relatively small compared to the observed local number density of relics (three in 5 × 10 6 Mpc 3 ; Ferré-Mateu et al. 2017) and might be insufficient to cover the most rare and extreme objects.The main caveat of the Flores-Freitas et al.

        <p>A scenario similar to that put forward by Flores-Freitas et al. ( 2022) was given by Yu et al. (2018). These authors studied the Illustris simulation (Vogelsberger et al. 2014) searching for dark matter-deficient galaxies. They found a galaxy akin to NGC 1277 that is, compact (R e ≈ 2 kpc), massive (M = 9.42 × 10 10 M ), and with a total dark matter mass fraction below 0.1. According to Yu et al. (2018), a strong interaction with the environment at redshift z &lt; 1 would have stripped about half of the stars from the galaxy and most of the dark matter (their Fig. 2). The result would be a dense compact galaxy with little dark matter. Only one such galaxy is found within the (106.5 Mpc) 3 ≈ 1.2 × 10 6 Mpc 3 Illustris box, which is tantalisingly close to the observational density constraints by Ferré-Mateu et al. (2017) and of the same order of magnitude as the number density of relics estimated by Quilis &amp; Trujillo (2013). It is also compatible with the estimated density of massive ultra-compact galaxies for the z &lt; 0.3 Universe of (1.0 ± 0.4) × 10 -6 Mpc -3 from Buitrago et al. (2008) and the lower limit for the relic density of one relic within 10 7 Mpc 3 from Spiniello et al. (2021b).A scenario similar to that put forward by Flores-Freitas et al.

        <p>A143, page 23 of 30 Comerón, S., et al.: A&amp;A 675, A143 (2023) A possible caveat of the work by Yu et al. (2018) is that the Illustris simulation yields lower dark matter fractions for ETGs than those measured through gravitational lensing (Mukherjee et al. 2022). Another caveat is that, since the mass loss in their scenario occurred quite late (z &lt; 1), the interaction should have stripped both the envelope and the population of blue globular clusters (discovered to be absent in Beasley et al. 2018). This possibility is discussed in Beasley et al. (2018) and found to be unlikely because, whereas tidal stripping could explain the lack of an envelope, it could not explain the extreme density of the centre of the galaxy. As a consequence, they conclude that NGC 1277 was already dense and compact at birth. Another sign that NGC 1277 never had a significant envelope can be found by comparing this galaxy with the regular ETG NGC 1278. Indeed, we find that NGC 1278 has signs of a relatively young (&lt;10 Gyr) accreted stellar population all the way to its centre (Ferré-Mateu et al., in prep.) which should be observed in NGC 1277 too if it ever had an envelope that was later lost. Furthermore, NGC 1277 lacks shells and streams down to µ r = 26.8 mag arcsec -2 (implying that no more than 2% of the stellar mass of the galaxy is missing from the deepest HST imaging; Trujillo et al. 2014). This indicates a paucity of interactions affecting the stellar component in the last few Gyr (Mancillas et al. 2019). Within the framework of the twophase formation scenario the simplest way to reconcile the stripping hypothesis with the observations is by assuming that the dark matter loss occurred very early (as seen in the work by Flores-Freitas et al. 2022), before NGC 1277 had time to accrete a significant envelope.A143, page 23 of 30 Comerón, S., et al.: A&amp;A 675, A143 (2023) A possible caveat of the work by Yu et al.

        <p>In a bottom-up hierarchical paradigm, galaxies grow by mergers. In the early Universe, galaxies were richer in gas than nowadays and mergers and cold streams caused a wet compaction that led to the formation of the compact high-redshift galaxies known as blue nuggets (e.g. Lapiner et al. 2023). It is possible that for a few major mergers the geometry of the encounter (impact parameter and relative velocity) were such that the collisionless dark matter would escape the system. The escape velocity from a 10 11 M body at a distance of 1 kpc is ≈1000 km s -1 , so under this hypothesis the relative velocity of the two bodies should be of the order of 2000 km s -1 in order to remove the dark matter from the system. Whereas these relative velocities can hardly be found in the field, they are consistent with the high-velocity tail within rich clusters. For example the Perseus cluster where NGC 1277 resides, is a rich cluster (Völk &amp; Atoyan 2000) with a velocity dispersion of σ = 1288 +90 -77 km s -1 (Girardi et al. 1993). Hence, we speculate that infrequent high-velocity collisions during the protocluster phase are possible. Indeed, assuming a Hubble-Lemaître parameter at z = 2, H(z = 2) ≈ 200 km s -1 , we obtain from the relations in Ferragamo et al. (2022) that to reach a velocity dispersion of 1000 km s -1 (so a few outliers have velocities of 2000 km s -1 ), a cluster mass of 3 × 10 14 M is sufficient. This mass is less than half the current mass of the Perseus cluster, M = 8.5 × 10 14 M (Mathews et al. 2006).In a bottom-up hierarchical paradigm, galaxies grow by mergers.

        <p>In this high-velocity collision scenario, the situation would be somewhat similar to that of the Bullet Cluster (Clowe et al. 2004;Markevitch et al. 2004), where dissipative matter (gas) is left behind. However, the analogy cannot be pushed too far because the gas in the blue nugget progenitor fragments would be orders of magnitude denser and cooler than that in the intracluster medium.In this high-velocity collision scenario, the situation would be somewhat similar to that of the Bullet Cluster (Clowe et al. 2004;Markevitch et al. 2004), where dissipative matter (gas) is left behind.

        <p>In the high-velocity encounter framework, the difference between the progenitor of NGC 1277 and that of a blue nugget on its way to become a regular ETG would be that the latter keeps most of its dark matter. This might be because the mergers that generated the progenitors of regular ETGs were mostly minor (as suggested by Zolotov et al. 2015) or because the relative velocity of the merging fragments was not large enough to prevent the dark matter from falling back.In the high-velocity encounter framework, the difference between the progenitor of NGC 1277 and that of a blue nugget on its way to become a regular ETG would be that the latter keeps most of its dark matter.

        <p>The high-velocity merger hypothesis has of course several caveats. The first one is that NGC 1277 looks like the passively evolved product of the average blue nugget which is presumed to have a regular fraction of dark matter. As a consequence, if our suggestion is valid, young massive ETGs should look similar irrespective of their dark matter content. This is not completely unreasonable because the dark matter fraction in the central regions of blue nuggets and massive ETGs is often small (Lapiner et al. 2023, and Fig. 21, respectively). However, it remains to be seen whether the lack of a dense extended dark matter halo would not result in the loss of many of the baryons at the onset of intense star formation. Another problem of this scenario is related to the time-scales involved in the process. On one hand, intense star formation would likely be triggered by the collision. On the other hand, the star formation timescale should be longer than the dynamical time-scale (τ dyn ∼ 1/ Gρ ∼ 40 Myr, where ρ is the average density of NGC 1277) for the gas to have time to settle in a disc in order to produce a mostly rotation-supported stellar body. Also, the density of the gas should have been high enough to ensure a fast cooling to prevent the escape of a large fraction of the gas shock-heated by the collision.The high-velocity merger hypothesis has of course several caveats.

        <p>A third possibility to explain the apparent lack of dark matter in NGC 1277 is a strong departure from a NFW dark matter profile. Our data do not reach the depth required to probe the matter distribution beyond 6 kpc. This leaves the door open for a halo with a core much flatter than that predicted by a NFW profile. It is known that density fluctuations introduced by AGN and stellar feedback at the centre of galaxies can erase cusps (e.g. Martizzi et al. 2013). The extremely massive central black hole could have powered the feedback, but such processes are also efficient at expelling baryons, so they should have occurred after most of the gas was transformed into stars. Therefore it is unclear how an extremely concentrated stellar component could sit within a halo that is more cored than average unless a large amount of fresh gas were accreted after the AGN had modified the density profile. Furthermore, a cored halo would not prevent dynamical friction from happening, so it would fail to naturally explain the absence of an envelope. In this case, the lack of mergers would be the consequence of a fortuitous lack of nearby galaxies to interact with.A third possibility to explain the apparent lack of dark matter in NGC 1277 is a strong departure from a NFW dark matter profile.

        <p>Finally, a mass-follows-light scenario could be considered. In this case the dark matter distribution would be similar to that of the baryons. The presence of dark matter would be observed as an increase in the mass-to-light ratio, which would manifest as a large mismatch parameter α and mimicking a bottom-heavy IMF. At first glance the high value of α for NGC 1277 makes this explanation plausible. However, the dynamically estimated mass-to-light ratio broadly agrees with that that can be extracted from the line-strength index-based study by Martín-Navarro et al. (2015). The fact that a bottomheavy IMF is found using two completely independent methods leaves little room for a significant mass-follows-light dark matter component.Finally, a mass-follows-light scenario could be considered.

        <p>One might be tempted to use the fact that NGC 1277 lacks detectable dark matter to speculate about the (in)existence of Milgromian dynamics (also known as MOND ;Milgrom 1983) or other alternatives to the ΛCDM paradigm.

        <p>NGC 1277 is similar to a gigantic rotating globular cluster, where the stars are the main contributor to the mass. Our favoured hypothesis to explain the formation of such a peculiar object is that NGC 1277 was born with little dark matter or that it lost most of it very early at or soon after its blue nugget phase. A plausible mechanism for that is that most of the dark matter of the galaxy was lost through interactions as it entered and moved through the Perseus cluster. Alternatively, NGC 1277 could have formed in a high-velocity collision of gas-rich fragments, where baryons coalesced and formed stars as dark matter left the system because of a velocity exceeding the escape one.NGC 1277 is similar to a gigantic rotating globular cluster, where the stars are the main contributor to the mass.

        <p>Our fits (Figs. 12 and 13) show that NGC 1277 has a large mismatch parameter α ≈ 1.34, which is a consequence of a bottom-heavy IMF. Our most surprising result is that there is little to no dark matter within the explored radius and that the maximum permissible dark matter fraction within 6 kpc (corresponding to 5 R e ) is f DM (6 kpc) = 0.05 (95.4% confidence interval; Fig. 19), which is in tension with the f DM (6 kpc) = 0.09 expectation based on the ΛCDM cosmology as obtained from stellar-to-halo mass relations by Girelli et al. (2020) and the dark matter halo radial profile parametrisation in Child et al. (2018). This low dark matter fraction is on an even stronger tension with the prediction of f DM (5 R e ) ∼ 0.6 (Fig. 22) obtained from combining the above two works with a M -R e relation for massive ETGs extracted from the data in Trujillo et al. (2020).Our fits (Figs. 12 and 13) show that NGC 1277 has a large mismatch parameter α ≈ 1.34, which is a consequence of a bottom-heavy IMF.

        <p>The large mismatch parameter of NGC 1277 indicates a high value of the stellar mass-to-light ratio, Υ r = 7.0 M /L r .

        <p>The lack of a dynamically significant dark matter component in NGC 1277 confirms the findings by Yıldırım et al. (2015). The fact that one of the galaxies with the densest stellar component lies within an underdense dark matter halo is extremely puzzling. On the other hand it explains why it has not accreted an envelope, since the lack of an extended dark matter component would shut down dynamical friction and hence the spiralling down of nearby dwarf galaxies. Hence, we propose that NGC 1277 either lost its dark matter early, before it accreted a significant envelope, or was dark matter deficient ab initio.The lack of a dynamically significant dark matter component in NGC 1277 confirms the findings by Yıldırım et al.

        <p>A possible way to create a dark matter-poor object such as NGC 1277 has been proposed by Flores-Freitas et al. (2022) who, based on the TNG50 simulation, posited that relic galaxy analogues may have lost a large fraction of their dark matter through interactions with the environment as they entered a cluster. A similar scenario has been proposed by Yu et al. (2018) based on a search for dark matter deficient galaxies in the Illustris simulation. It is suggestive that the density of compact, massive and dark matter deficient galaxies in the Illustris simulation is very close to that found in the local Universe by Ferré-Mateu et al. (2017, one in ≈1.2 × 10 6 Mpc 3 versus three in ≈5 × 10 6 Mpc 3 ) and compatible with other density estimates by Buitrago et al. (2018) and Spiniello et al. (2021b). Simulations have also shown a similar mechanism at work for dwarf galaxies through interactions with their parent galaxies (Engler et al. 2021;Moreno et al. 2022). Alternatively, an NGC 1277-like object could have been born in a high-velocity collision of gas-rich objects where dark matter would have escaped the system leaving behind a rotating stellar body (blue nugget). The high relative velocities required for this process to work could only be found in a cluster-like environment and, based on Ferragamo et al. (2022), we speculate that they might have been possible in the progenitors of the rich galaxy clusters at z ∼ 2.A possible way to create a dark matter-poor object such as NGC 1277 has been proposed by Flores-Freitas et al.

        <p>A143, page 25 of 30 Comerón, S., et al.: A&amp;A 675, A143 (2023) We have found that NGC 1277 lacks any detectable dark matter within 6 kpc (corresponding to five effective radii, 5 R e ) of its centre. Massive dark matter-deficient galaxies are unexpected within the framework of the consensus cosmological model ΛCDM. We propose that the galaxy was dark matter deficient ab initio or soon after birth and that the relic nature of NGC 1277 stems from the lack of an extended halo. In order to confirm this hypothesis more deep integral field studies of pure relic galaxies are required. It would also be interesting to check whether even deeper observations of NGC 1277 can find traces of a tenuous dark matter halo by finding a flattening of the rotation curve at a radius R 10 kpc. log I 0 (log (L pc -2 )) σ (arcsec) q 4.3 Notes. I 0 stands for the central surface brightness of the projected Gaussian components, σ denotes their dispersion, and q their projected axial ratio. We have found that the mass of the black hole sitting at the centre of NGC 1277 is M BH = (4.88 ± 0.11) × 10 9 M . This very precise determination was made using the NIFS data from Walsh et al. (2016, our cA1 fit for NGC 1277). Surprisingly, if we use the GCMS data only we obtain a black hole mass of the right order of magnitude (M BH = (2.6 ± 1.0) × 10 9 M ; cC fit). Black hole masses of a few times 10 9 M are consistently found for both a cylindrically and a spherically aligned velocity ellipsoid, irrespective of whether we use the data from NIFS, from GCMS, or both datasets.A143, page 25 of 30 Comerón, S., et al.: A&amp;A 675, A143 (2023) We have found that NGC 1277 lacks any detectable dark matter within 6 kpc (corresponding to five effective radii, 5 R e ) of its centre.

        <p>One might wonder whether these roughly concordant black hole mass values between fits resorting to datasets with a very different angular resolution is merely a coincidence. The fact that by using adaptive optics or the JWST we can now obtain integral field data of the progenitor of a massive ETG at z 1 with a physical resolution comparable to that given by the GCMS for NGC 1277 makes it worth to study this issue a bit further.One might wonder whether these roughly concordant black hole mass values between fits resorting to datasets with a very different angular resolution is merely a coincidence.

        <p>x (arcsec) y (arcsec) look at z = 1.2 seen through the JWST, we degraded the HST F475W, F625W, and F850LP images by reducing their side by a factor 16 (that is, by coadding the flux from a box of 16 pixels by 16 pixels to generate a single pixel). The factor 16 comes from the difference in angular size (8550 pc/345 pc ≈ 25) and the 0 . 05 versus 0 . 031 difference in pixel size between the HST ACS and the JWST Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam Rieke et al. 2005). Then, we convolved the images with a JWST PSF simulated by WebbPSF (Perrin et al. 2014). Given the wavelength shift for a z = 1.2 object, we convolved the F625W image with a F140M PSF. The mass map is built from the F475W and the F850LP filters (Sect. 3.2) that, given the redshift, would roughly correspond to the F115M and F182M filters, respectively. However, the PSF mismatch between these two filters is rather large and introduces artefacts in the colour map used to compute the mass map. This is why, we convolved the two filters with the F182M PSF, so we simulated a PSF matching. Effectively, the resampling and convolution corresponds to a degradation of the width of the core of the PSF of a factor of ∼ 15. We produced a mask based on the degraded images, hence missing small stars and the circumnuclear dust ring that are obvious in the original HST images.

        <p>A143, page 28 of 30 We produced Jeans models of NGC 1277 as in Sect. 4, but this time using the MGEs obtained from degraded data. Since we want to determine the black hole mass, we did a fit akin cC in Table 3, that is with a free M BH , a cylindrical velocity ellipsoid, and no variation in β z with radius. We call this model cCd ('d' stands for degraded). The fit is shown in Once again, we find a negligible dark matter fraction within 6 kpc. Perhaps the most surprising result is the detection of an extremely massive black hole, with M BH = (1.01 ± 0.10) × 10 10 M . This mass is about two times larger than A143, page 29 of 30 Comerón, S., et al.: A&amp;A 675, A143 (2023) that found in Sect. 4.1. The mismatch parameter that we find here, α ≈ 1.5, is also significantly larger than in Sect. 4.1 (α ≈ 1.3). Why is the black hole mass so large when using low angular resolution data? Accounting for the mismatch parameter, the stellar mass within the central kpc of NGC 1277 is M (1 kpc) = 5.5 × 10 10 M for the original MGE parametrisation. But this goes down to only M (1 kpc) = 4.6 × 10 10 M when using the degraded data. The central V rms peak is the consequence of both a black hole and a peaked stellar distribution. If the peak in the stellar distribution is smoothened or erased, the algorithm assigns a larger mass to the black hole to compensate for the loss of the stellar cusp. Hence, our simple test tentatively indicates that black hole mass estimates obtained from insufficiently sharp data might be biased towards high values. It is notewor-thy that in spite of the likely bias, we recover a black hole mass that is only a factor of roughly two off the one obtained using high-angular-resolution data.A143, page 28 of 30 We produced Jeans models of NGC 1277 as in Sect. 4, but this time using the MGEs obtained from degraded data.

        <p>Our test underlines the importance of properly characterising the central stellar distribution to be able to give an orderof-magnitude estimate of the mass of the central black hole. Using images with the JWST resolution concomitantly with a deconvolution method such as the Lucy-Richardson algorithm (Richardson 1972;Lucy 1974) it should be possible to recover information about the central stellar peak. Hence, such techniques should allow obtaining reasonable black hole mass estimates for galaxies with a central velocity dispersion cusp. Before being applied, this possibility hinted at by our relatively simple experiments should be confirmed with thorough tests made using mock simulated data.Our test underlines the importance of properly characterising the central stellar distribution to be able to give an orderof-magnitude estimate of the mass of the central black hole.
