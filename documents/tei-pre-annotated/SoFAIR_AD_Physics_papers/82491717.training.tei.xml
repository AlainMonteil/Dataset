        <p>We argue that a remnant is formed for all black objects in gravity's rainbow. This will be based on the observation that a remnant depends critically on the structure of the rainbow functions, and this dependence is a model independent phenomena. We thus propose general relations for the modified temperature and entropy of all black objects in gravity's rainbow. We explicitly check this to be the case for Kerr, Kerr-Newman-dS, charged-AdS, and higher dimensional Kerr-AdS black holes. We also try to argue that a remnant should form for black saturn in gravity's rainbow. This work extends our previous results on remnants of Schwarzschild black holes [1] and black rings [2].We argue that a remnant is formed for all black objects in gravity's rainbow.

        <p>Lorentz symmetry is one of the most important symmetries in nature, and this symmetry fixes the form of the standard energy-momentum dispersion relation, E 2p 2 = m 2 . However, most approaches to quantum gravity suggest that the Lorentz symmetry might only be an effective symmetry in nature, and so, in the ultraviolet limit the Lorentz symmetry might break modifying the standard energy-momentum dispersion relation. For example, it is known that even though gravity is not renormalizable, it can be made renormalizable by adding higher order curvature terms. These higher order curvature terms produce negative norm ghost states in the theory. It is possible to add terms with higher order spatial derivatives to the theory, without adding any terms with higher order temporal, which reduces to the general relativity in the infrared limit. This theory is called Horava-Lifshitz gravity, and in it the standard energy-momentum dispersion relation gets modified in the ultraviolet limit [3,4].Lorentz symmetry is one of the most important symmetries in nature, and this symmetry fixes the form of the standard energy-momentum dispersion relation, E 2p 2 = m 2 .

        <p>Furthermore, one of the most famous approaches to quantum gravity is the string theory. Even in string theory, it is expected that the standard energy-momentum dispersion relation will get modified. This is because it is not possible to probe spacetime below the string length scale, and the existence of this minimum length scale will induce a maximum energy scale in the theory [5,6]. This maximum energy scale will in turn deform the standard energy-momentum dispersion relation [7,8]. In fact, the modification of the standard energy-momentum dispersion relation seems to be an almost universal feature of all models of quantum gravity, such as spacetime discreteness [9], spontaneous symmetry breaking of Lorentz invariance in string field theory [10], spacetime foam models [11] and spin-network in loop quantum gravity (LQG) [12], and non-commutative geometry [13].Furthermore, one of the most famous approaches to quantum gravity is the string theory.

        <p>The standard energy-momentum dispersion relation gets modified because of the existence of a maximum energy scale E P in nature. Hence, just as the velocity of light is the maximum attainable velocity in special relativity, the Planck energy is the maximum attainable energy in these theories with modified dispersion relations (MDR). In fact, it is possible to construct a generalization of special relativity with two universal invariants, i.e. the velocity of light and Planck energy [14]. This generalization of special relativity is called doubly special relativity (DSR) [15]. In fact, it has been possible to generalize DSR to curved spacetime, and arrive at a doubly general relativity, or gravity's rainbow [16]. The name gravity's rainbow is motivated by the fact that in this approach the geometry of spacetime depends on the energy of the particle used to probe it, and so, this geometry is represented by a one parameter family of energy dependent metrics forming a rainbow of metrics.The standard energy-momentum dispersion relation gets modified because of the existence of a maximum energy scale E P in nature.

        <p>Since gravity rainbow is based on generalizing DSR to curved spacetime, it is important to define the modified dispersion relations in DSR.

For example, if an observer uses a particle to measure the geometry of spacetime, then E is the energy of that particle. It has been observed that modification of the metric by certain phenomenologically motivated rainbow functions, changes the thermodynamical behavior of Schwarzschild black holes [1] and black rings [2], close to the Planck scale. This modification changes both their temperature and entropy as they evaporate down to Planck scale. In fact, in gravity's rainbow the temperature of these black objects starts to decrease after reaching a maximum value. At a critical size this temperature becomes zero and so does the entropy. Thus, a black remnant is left over. Motivated by the earlier works on a Schwarzschild black holes and black rings, we will argue that all black objects will leave a remnant in gravity's rainbow.

        <p>In this paper, we argued that a remnant is formed for all black objects due to gravity's rainbow. We observe that a remnant is a general feature that depends more on the form of rainbow functions than on the specific black object studied. We also proposed general relations for the modified temperature and entropy of all black objects in gravity's rainbow. We explicitly checked this to be the case for Kerr, Kerr-Newman-dS, charged-AdS, and higher dimensional Kerr-AdS black holes. We also tried to argue that a remnant should form for black saturns. This work extends our previous results on remnants of Schwarzschild black holes [1] and black rings [2].In this paper, we argued that a remnant is formed for all black objects due to gravity's rainbow.

        <p>It may be noted that the existence of this remnant ensures that naked singularities cannot be observed. The evaporation of black object posed serious problems for cosmic censorship [54], as it was conceivable in ordinary general relativity, that a black object could evaporate completely leaving behind a naked singularity. However, such a situation does not occur for black objects in gravity's rainbow. This is because of the singularity is always surrounded by the event horizon of the remnant.It may be noted that the existence of this remnant ensures that naked singularities cannot be observed.

        <p>It may be noted that a similar result has been obtained using generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). In the GUP approach, a modification of the Heisenberg algebra (to make it compatible with the existence of a minimum length scale) causes a deformation of the coordinates representation of the momentum operators. This in turn deforms the standard energy-momentum dispersion relation. Thus, it seems that the modification of temperature and entropy of a black object can occur whenever the standard energy-momentum relation is modified. Besides, similar results are obtained too in the context of non-commutative geometry in [55,56] in which the authors showed that a remnant will be formed for the black hole in noncommutative geometry where the black hole will have modified emission spectra through deformed grey body factors with a maximum temperature before remnant formation. For useful review on black hole remnant from noncommutative geometry, one can consult Refs. [57,58]. It would be interesting to try to get a better understanding of this link. It would also be interesting to study the change in the thermodynamical properties of these higher dimensional black objects, like black rings and black saturn using GUP.It may be noted that a similar result has been obtained using generalized uncertainty principle (GUP).
