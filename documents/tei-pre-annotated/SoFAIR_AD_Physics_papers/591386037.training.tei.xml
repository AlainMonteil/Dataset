        <p>Section 1: Band structure and mode profile for silicon disk metasurface Figure S1 shows the calculated band structure for the silicon disk metasurface with the same unit cell (inverse-designed counterpart to the dimer-hole metasurface shown in Fig. 1 of the main text). As can be seen, the mode of the same nature is located at a spectral position of 882 nm. To shift the mode to 1510 nm (as the mode for the membrane metasurface), it requires a much larger size for both the unit cell and the silicon disks. Furthermore, the electric field of light is mainly located near the silicon/air interface and outside the silicon disk. This clearly shows that by utlising the membrane metasurfaces, under the same unit size, we can achieve strong field enhancement at a higher spectral position compared to disk metasurfaces (from 882 nm to 1510 nm).Section 1: Band structure and mode profile for silicon disk metasurface Figure S1 shows the calculated band structure for the silicon disk metasurface with the same unit cell (inverse-designed counterpart to the dimer-hole metasurface shown in Fig. 1 of the main text).

        <p>Section 2: Multipolar structure and field distribution for the Fano resonance near 1000 nm Table S1 summarises the input powers, spectral wavelength of resonance, unit cell sizes, Q-factors, and conversion efficiencies for silicon metasurfaces. For making a fair comparison, we utilise two approaches to calculate the conversion efficiencies of those works: 1) ; 2) , where . In the second approach, the efficiency is no longer dependent on the level of input power or the size of beam spot, which is more corresponding to the nonlinear performance of silicon metasurfaces compared to the first way. In addition, the first approach directly exhibits the process of energy conversion from linear range to nonlinear range. Due to the reasons revealed above, we keep both methods for comparison.Section 2: Multipolar structure and field distribution for the Fano resonance near 1000 nm Table S1 summarises the input powers, spectral wavelength of resonance, unit cell sizes, Q-factors, and conversion efficiencies for silicon metasurfaces.

        <p>By designing the Q-factor to match the resonance width with the laser pulse, membrane metasurfaces enable a strong coupling of incident light into the resonance and nonlinear light-matter interactions. Among those working in the NIR spectral region, membrane metasurfaces have obtained a comparable conversion efficiency with a unit-cell size, less than half of other metasurfaces.By designing the Q-factor to match the resonance width with the laser pulse, membrane metasurfaces enable a strong coupling of incident light into the resonance and nonlinear light-matter interactions.
