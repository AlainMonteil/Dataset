        <p>We introduce a series of 20 cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of L * (M 200 = 10 11.7 -10 12.3 M ) and group-sized (M 200 = 10 12.7 -10 13.3 M ) haloes run with the model used for the EAGLE project, which additionally includes a non-equilibrium ionization and cooling module that follows 136 ions. The simulations reproduce the observed correlation, revealed by COS-Halos at z ∼ 0.2, between O VI column density at impact parameters b &lt; 150 kpc and the specific star formation rate (sSFR ≡ SFR/M * ) of the central galaxy at z ∼ 0.2. We find that the column density of circumgalactic O VI is maximal in the haloes associated with L * galaxies, because their virial temperatures are close to the temperature at which the ionization fraction of O VI peaks (T ∼ 10 5.5 K). The higher virial temperature of group haloes (&gt;10 6 K) promotes oxygen to higher ionization states, suppressing the O VI column density. The observed N O VI -sSFR correlation therefore does not imply a causal link, but reflects the changing characteristic ionization state of oxygen as halo mass is increased. In spite of the mass dependence of the oxygen ionization state, the most abundant circumgalactic oxygen ion in both L * and group haloes is O VII; O VI accounts for only 0.1 per cent of the oxygen in group haloes and 0.9-1.3 per cent with L * haloes. Nonetheless, the metals traced by O VI absorbers represent a fossil record of the feedback history of galaxies over a Hubble time; their characteristic epoch of ejection corresponds to z &gt; 1 and much of the ejected metal mass resides beyond the virial radius of galaxies. For both L * and group galaxies, more of the oxygen produced and released by stars in the circumgalactic medium (within twice the virial radius) than in the stars and interstellar medium of the galaxy.We introduce a series of 20 cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of L * (M 200 = 10 11.7 -10 12.3 M ) and group-sized (M 200 = 10 12.7 -10 13.3 M ) haloes run with the model used for the EAGLE project, which additionally includes a non-equilibrium ionization and cooling module that follows 136 ions.

        <p>The installation of the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) greatly increased the throughput of UV spectroscopy on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) platform (e.g. Savage et al. 2010), enabling the use of fainter quasar targets illuminating foreground galactic haloes. Several HST programs have exploited this new capability to investigate the gaseous environments of a sample of low-z haloes, including COS-Halos (Tumlinson et al. 2013), COS-Dwarfs (Bordoloi et al. 2014), and COS-GASS (Borthakur et al. 2015).

        <p>One of the first COS-Halos results demonstrated statistically that the properties of O VI absorption, out to impact parameter b = 150 kpc, correlate with the properties of the host galaxies (Tumlinson et al. 2011, hereafter T11). The strongest correlation was found between the O VI column density (N O VI ) and the specific star formation rate (sSFR ≡ SFR/M * ) of the galaxy, such that the bimodality in sSFR between the COS-Halos star-forming sample and the passive sample is clearly reflected in their O VI columns. Of the 12 COS-Halos passive galaxies, defined as having sSFR less than 10 -11 yr -1 , at least half have N O VI &lt; 10 14.0 cm -2 , while 90 per cent of the 30 COS-Halos star-forming galaxies have N O VI &gt; 10 14.2 cm -2 and the median N O VI is 10 14.5 cm -2 at b &lt; 150 kpc.One of the first COS-Halos results demonstrated statistically that the properties of O VI absorption, out to impact parameter b = 150 kpc, correlate with the properties of the host galaxies (Tumlinson et al. 2011, hereafter T11).

        <p>T11 identified O VI haloes as a major reservoir of the metals synthesized by star-forming galaxies, estimating a typical O VI mass of ≈2 × 10 6 M when summing the median O VI column of 10 14.5 cm -2 over a 150 kpc radius aperture. The total mass of oxygen traced by COS-Halos is at least 1.2 × 10 7 M when assuming a maximum O VI ionization fraction, x O VI = 0.2. Peeples et al. (2014) explored the O VI haloes in the context of the total metal budget estimated to be synthesized by galaxies, concluding that there exists nearly as much metal mass traced by circumgalactic O VI as in the ISM of galaxies with M * &lt; 10 10 M for x O VI = 0.2.T11 identified O VI haloes as a major reservoir of the metals synthesized by star-forming galaxies, estimating a typical O VI mass of ≈2 × 10 6 M when summing the median O VI column of 10 14.5 cm -2 over a 150 kpc radius aperture.

        <p>The discovery of such a large reservoir of O VI-traced metals extending far beyond the stellar disc of the galaxy leads to several questions about the dynamical link between galaxies and their associated CGM. Is there a direct relation between the O VI in haloes and star formation as suggested by the O VI-sSFR correlation? Such a link would imply that typical L * galaxies are spewing enriched gas in galactic winds out to 150 kpc and beyond in the low-z Universe. A number of large-volume simulations (e.g. Ford et al. 2013Ford et al. , 2016;;Suresh et al. 2015a,b) and zooms with cosmological initial conditions (e.g. Stinson et al. 2012;Hummels et al. 2013;Shen et al. 2014;Gutcke et al. 2016) have found an intimate link between galaxies and their metal-enriched CGM. Simulations that specifically compared with the COS-Halos survey find lower O VI column densities than observed around star-forming galaxies (Suresh et al. 2015b;Ford et al. 2016). The Ford et al. (2016) simulations do not include active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback and do not reproduce the O VI bimodality, while Suresh et al. (2015b) argue that AGN feedback clears out the CGM around passive galaxies thus reducing O VI column densities around passive galaxies.The discovery of such a large reservoir of O VI-traced metals extending far beyond the stellar disc of the galaxy leads to several questions about the dynamical link between galaxies and their associated CGM.

        <p>Another possibility is that CGM O VI is not directly attributable to recent star formation or AGN activity, and that instead the O VI bimodality arises from a more fundamental relationship. To assess this possibility, we need to ask what is the physical nature of O VI? If O VI is predominantly photoionized gas at ∼10 4 K (e.g. Oppenheimer &amp; Davé 2009), then such absorbers could be a signature of cold flows (e.g. Kereš et al. 2005;Dekel et al. 2009;van de Voort et al. 2012) feeding star formation, which may subside around passive galaxies. Enhanced photoionization from young stars could also ionize O VI around star-forming galaxies (Oppenheimer &amp; Schaye 2013b;Vasiliev, Ryabova &amp; Shchekinov 2015;Suresh et al. 2015b). Oppenheimer et al. (2012) demonstrated that increasing the ionization background strength at the O VI ionization potential can result in photoionized O VI tracing higher densities, even in circumgalactic halo gas. Alternatively, if O VI is primarily collisionally ionized at its 10 5.5 K peak (e.g. Heckman et al. 2002;Cen &amp; Chisari 2011;Smith et al. 2011;Tepper-Garcia et al. 2011;Faerman, Sternberg &amp; McKee 2016), then it signals a hot halo component apparently associated with star-forming galaxies. Is this warm-hot component related to recent outflows or does it trace the temperature of a virialized, quasi-static halo? If the latter, do passive galaxies lack O VI haloes, because their virial temperatures are much hotter than 10 5.5 K?Another possibility is that CGM O VI is not directly attributable to recent star formation or AGN activity, and that instead the O VI bimodality arises from a more fundamental relationship.

        <p>Knowledge of the physical cause of the ionization is required to constrain x O VI , from which the total mass of oxygen and metals in the CGM is inferred. Because the O VI-traced CGM mass scales inversely with x O VI , far more CGM oxygen would be present if x O VI is much lower than the maximal value implied by ionization analyses. Hence, it is uncertain how much underlying CGM oxygen the COS-Halos O VI observation indicate.Knowledge of the physical cause of the ionization is required to constrain x O VI , from which the total mass of oxygen and metals in the CGM is inferred.

        <p>To understand the origin and nature of O VI in a set of haloes hosting galaxies corresponding to those probed by COS-Halos, we need cosmological simulations that can simultaneously model the stellar build-up of galaxies, the feedback processes that eject gas from galaxies, and the detailed atomic processes that govern the abundances of the ions observed in the CGM. Here, we run a series of zoom simulations targeting a range of galactic haloes similar to those probed by the COS-Halos survey using the same model as the EAGLE simulations (Crain et al. 2015;Schaye et al. 2015, hereafter S15). The parameters of the subgrid physics routines employed by the EAGLE simulations were calibrated to reproduce the observed z ∼ 0.1 galactic stellar mass function, the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass-M * relation, and the sizes of galaxy discs using a combination of star formation (SF)-driven thermal winds and SMBH thermal winds. Observations of the CGM were not used to calibrate the EAGLE simulations, therefore, the outcomes here are genuine predictions of the model.To understand the origin and nature of O VI in a set of haloes hosting galaxies corresponding to those probed by COS-Halos, we need cosmological simulations that can simultaneously model the stellar build-up of galaxies, the feedback processes that eject gas from galaxies, and the detailed atomic processes that govern the abundances of the ions observed in the CGM.

        <p>Here we integrate the non-equilibrium (NEQ) ionization and dynamical cooling module introduced by Oppenheimer &amp; Schaye (2013a, hereafter OS13) into the EAGLE simulation code to trace the evolution of 136 ions of 11 elements on the fly, which we activate at late times for evolved haloes. The module includes photoionization from a slowly evolving meta-galactic background, in this case the Haardt &amp; Madau (2001) quasar+galaxy background. We also note that this work is the first we know of to integrate ion-by-ion cooling rates including for the metals (Gnat &amp; Ferland 2012; OS13) into a cosmological simulation. NEQ ionization of oxygen was explored in simulations by Cen &amp; Fang (2006) and Yoshikawa &amp; Sasaki (2006), but they did not perform dynamical cooling. We discuss the NEQ effects in Appendix A, but note that these do not significantly affect the O VI columns when using a uniform meta-galactic background, nor do they alter the integrated properties of galaxies (M * , SFR, colour).Here we integrate the non-equilibrium (NEQ) ionization and dynamical cooling module introduced by Oppenheimer &amp; Schaye (2013a, hereafter OS13) into the EAGLE simulation code to trace the evolution of 136 ions of 11 elements on the fly, which we activate at late times for evolved haloes.

        <p>Our investigation focuses on the O VI column density observations from COS-Halos. We stress that the EAGLE feedback model has not been calibrated to reproduce the properties of the CGM. Nevertheless, EAGLE shows agreement with cosmic H I statistics tracing the IGM over a Hubble time (Rahmati et al. 2015). Furthermore, because EAGLE reproduces key stellar and cold ISM properties of galaxies (e.g. Furlong et al. 2015a,b;Lagos et al. 2015Lagos et al. , 2016;;S15;Trayford et al. 2015;Segers et al. 2016;Bahé et al. 2016), while explicitly following the hydrodynamics, it is an ideal testbed for this study and will indicate whether additional physical processes are necessary to reproduce CGM measurements. This enables us to consider the total metal budget inside and beyond galaxies as done by Bouché et al. (2007), Zahid et al. (2012), andPeeples et al. (2014). We also compare our results to the related work of Rahmati et al. (2016), who explored IGM metal-line statistics, including O VI, in the EAGLE cosmological boxes. Throughout we use the EAGLE-RECAL prescription for all zooms as discussed in S2; however, it should be noted that the main EAGLE cosmological boxes use two different prescriptions (REF and RECAL) at two different resolutions, which we discuss in Appendix B and show that there is not a significant difference for our main results.Our investigation focuses on the O VI column density observations from COS-Halos.

            <rs type="software">GADGET- 3</rs> last described by Springel (2005), which is described in detail by S15. The main modifications to the entropy-conserving SPH implementation of the 
            <rs type="software">GADGET-3</rs> code (Springel &amp; Hernquist 2003a) comprise (i) the pressure-entropy SPH formulation described by Hopkins ( 2013), (ii) the artificial viscosity switch of Cullen &amp; Dehnen (2010), (iii) the artificial conduction switch of Price (2008), (iv) the time step limiter from Durier &amp; Dalla Vecchia (2012) to improve energy conservation during sudden changes of internal energy, and (v) a C2 Wendland (1995) 58-neighbour kernel to suppress particlepairing instabilities (Dehnen &amp; Aly 2012). Collectively, these updates are referred to as 'Anarchy' (Dalla Vecchia, in preparation; see also appendix A of S15) and the impact of their inclusion on the galaxy population was explored by Schaller et al.

Equilibrium radiative cooling and photoheating rates are computed for 11 elements exposed to the Haardt &amp; Madau (2001) extragalactic ionization background plus the cosmic background radiation as described by Wiersma, Schaye &amp; Smith (2009a).

(2009b) includes element-by-element and mass metal loss from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, stellar winds from massive stars, and supernovae (SNe, core collapse and Type Ia), which is distributed across the SPH kernel of each stellar particle. A Chabrier (2003) initial mass function (IMF) is adopted.</p>
        <p>Following Dalla Vecchia &amp; Schaye (2012), feedback associated with star formation and the SMBH growth is implemented by stochastically heating gas particles neighbouring newly formed star particles and accreting SMBH. The energy budgets available associated with stellar feedback and black hole growth govern the probability of heating each SPH particle. Briefly, stellar feedback heats particles by T = 10 7.5 K in a single episode 30 Myr after a star particle forms. The fraction of the available energy injected into the ISM depends on the local gas metallicity (Z) to account for more efficient cooling at higher Z, and the local gas density to compensate for artificial radiative losses that occur at high density (see Crain et al. 2015; S15, for further motivation). SMBH growth and AGN feedback are implemented using a single thermal mode following Booth &amp; Schaye (2009) with the addition of the suppression of high angular momentum gas accretion following Rosas-Guevara et al. (2015). We use the high-resolution EAGLE-RECAL prescription, which applies a heating temperature of T AGN = 10 9.0 K.Following Dalla Vecchia &amp; Schaye (2012), feedback associated with star formation and the SMBH growth is implemented by stochastically heating gas particles neighbouring newly formed star particles and accreting SMBH.

        <p>The NEQ module, introduced by OS13, explicitly follows the reaction network of 136 ionization states of all 11 elements that contribute significantly to the cooling (H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Si, Mg, S, Ca, and Fe) plus the electron density of the plasma. These are the same elements as are present in the equilibrium cooling module of Wiersma et al. (2009a), enabling a self-consistent switching between using equilibrium lookup tables and the NEQ method. Our reaction network, described fully by OS13, includes radiative and dielectric recombination, collisional ionization, photoionization, Auger ionization, and charge transfer. Cooling is performed ion-by-ion (Gnat &amp; Ferland 2012;OS13) summing over all 136 ions. OS13 verified that this method reproduces published results obtained with other codes. We use particle-based (instead of kernelsmoothed) ion and metal abundances for NEQ ionization and cooling as explained in Section 2.3.3.The NEQ module, introduced by OS13, explicitly follows the reaction network of 136 ionization states of all 11 elements that contribute significantly to the cooling (H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Si, Mg, S, Ca, and Fe) plus the electron density of the plasma.

            <rs type="version">1</rs> solver to integrate the ionization and cooling over a hydrodynamic time step using the backward difference formula and Newton iteration. Although an extended version of the network is also capable of modelling ISM chemistry including molecular formation, cooling, and dissociation (see Richings, Schaye &amp; Oppenheimer 2014), we focus on the CGM and do not use the NEQ network for gas densities above the metallicity-dependent SF threshold. For ISM gas, defined as having non-zero SFR, we use equilibrium lookup tables tabulated as functions of density assuming T = 10 4 K, although we note that this matters little as the ion abundances will rapidly evolve when the SPH particle is heated by feedback, and the NEQ network followed. Upon enrichment, SPH particles receive the new metals in their ground-state ions. The vast majority of enrichment occurs in the ISM gas, where the network is not used. However, enrichment of gas followed using the NEQ network occurs when stars outside of galaxies enrich via delayed feedback (e.g. Type Ia SNe and AGB winds). Our exploration here focuses on CGM gas traced by oxygen absorption, most of which is far from galaxies; hence the details of the ion abundances in ISM gas and from recent enrichment is essentially inconsequential. We set the 
            <rs type="software">CVODE</rs> absolute tolerance to 10 -9 and the relative tolerances to 10 -3 . We do not use a selfshielding prescription for dense gas in either equilibrium or NEQ.

A contiguous surface enclosing the particles is identified out to 3× the virial radius, and the volume it encloses is resampled with a high-resolution particle load realized by tiling a cubic periodic glass distribution (White 1994). This high-resolution particle load is divided into SPH and high-resolution dark matter (DM1) particles, using b = 0.04825 and mb = 0.259, respectively. The remaining volume within the simulation domain is resampled with an undivided load of collisionless particles whose resolution decreases as a function of distance from the surface ensuring the faithful reproduction of large-scale gravitational forces throughout the high-resolution region. A glass-like particle distribution guarantees that the initial particle load is essentially free of unwanted power above shot noise frequency. The high-frequency components of the Gaussian random field perturbations can then faithfully be imposed on the zoom region.

The L * galaxy haloes are referred to as Gal001-Gal010 and the group haloes are referred to as Grp000-Grp009 in Table 1. We run at three resolutions, which we will refer using the nomenclature M[log(m SPH / M )], where m SPH is the initial mass of SPH particles. M5.3 Zooms. We simulate all haloes at our fiducial resolution, corresponding to an SPH particle mass resolution of 2.3 × 10 5 M , and a DM particle mass of 1.2 × 10 6 M . The Plummer-equivalent softening length is 350 proper pc below z = 2.8, and 1.33 comoving kpc above z = 2.8, which corresponds to 1/25th of the mean interparticle separation. This is the same resolution as achieved by the L025N0752 simulation. We can cross-reference the zoom L * M5.3 galaxies with the same galaxies in the L025N0752 galaxies, which we do in Appendix B to ensure that the zooms do not differ substantially from their parent cosmological volume. We also cross-reference the group zooms, although note that these zooms have 8× (2×) higher mass (spatial) resolution than the L100N1504 simulation.

All of these are run in equilibrium, and a selection in NEQ. We only use these zooms to test resolution convergence in Appendix B and they are listed there in Table B1.

        <p>Each zoom is focused on one halo, but surrounding simulated regions often contain additional haloes that are either partially or fully sampled by SPH and high-resolution DM1 particles. We find a set of 'bonus' haloes that we verified to be completely resolved with SPH and DM1 particles out to three times the virial radius (R 200 ), and add these to our sample. Bonus haloes at our main redshift (z = 0.205) include three sub-L * galaxies (M 200 10 11.5 M ) found at a distance greater than 3R 200 of the targeted L * haloes, two low-mass L * haloes (M 200 = 10 11.6 M ) and two L * haloes (M 200 = 10 12.0-12.5 M ) found beyond 3R 200 of targeted group haloes, and three bonus haloes (M 200 = 10 12.0-12.6 ) in the Gal010 zoom, which itself is by far the most massive 'Galaxy' zoom, and tracks the formation of a 10 12.7 M z = 0 halo.Each zoom is focused on one halo, but surrounding simulated regions often contain additional haloes that are either partially or fully sampled by SPH and high-resolution DM1 particles.

        <p>We evolve all zooms using the equilibrium cooling rates from Wiersma et al. (2009a) to z = 0 using the standard 
            <rs type="software">EAGLE</rs> code with the only difference being that we do not use kernel-smoothed metallicities to compute cooling rates. As explained by Wiersma et al. (2009b), smoothed metallicities are consistent with the SPH formalism; however, their use when adopting NEQ cooling requires that both particle and smoothed ion abundances are tracked, which for 136 species is a prohibitive memory requirement. Furthermore, smoothing complicates the interpretation of NEQ ionization effects when ion species are averaged over the SPH kernel. Therefore, to enable a consistent comparison of methods, we use particle metallicities in both equilibrium and NEQ runs.

        <p>As a consistency test, we run a set of five M5.3 zoom runs with smoothed metallicities, finding that they have 0.11 dex higher stellar masses than their non-smoothed M5.3 zoom counterparts. It appears that smoothed metallicities increase the SF efficiencies by distributing metals over more particles, increasing the overall cooling rate of the galaxy, and leading to more star formation. Wiersma et al. (2009b) also showed that in the OWLS simulations, smoothed metallicities increased the SF efficiency. We show in Appendix B that O VI column densities are unaffected by metal smoothing.As a consistency test, we run a set of five M5.3 zoom runs with smoothed metallicities, finding that they have 0.11 dex higher stellar masses than their non-smoothed M5.3 zoom counterparts.

        <p>When examining NEQ simulations, we activate the NEQ module at relatively low redshift in order to minimize the computational cost of following 136 ionic species. The magnitude of NEQ effects can be significant in shocks and rapidly cooling gas, and this behaviour is only captured with use of the NEQ module. This module is important to use, in order to recover the correct ion species in all circumstances. It should be noted that we will show that the NEQ effects are generally not important for gas dynamics in a separate study, as predicted by OS13 and also demonstrated by Richings &amp; Schaye (2016). Furthermore, NEQ effects on CGM ion diagnostics (i.e. observables) persist for short times compared to the Hubble timescale, enabling us to begin modelling them only at late times. We discuss the NEQ effects in Appendix A, which are typically small, &lt;0.1 dex for oxygen ions.When examining NEQ simulations, we activate the NEQ module at relatively low redshift in order to minimize the computational cost of following 136 ionic species.

        <p>The L * haloes all switch to NEQ cooling at z NEQ = 0.503 and the group haloes at z NEQ = 0.282. The later NEQ activation for group haloes was adopted to save computational cost. The NEQ runs begin from a snapshot output of the equilibrium run, where we iterate CVODE for a long timescale (δt = 10 6 /[n H /cm -3 ] yr) for all species to guarantee ionization equilibrium. The 
            <rs type="software">EAGLE</rs> code then runs as normal with the Wiersma et al. (2009a) cooling replaced by the NEQ module iterating the ionization states and cooling rates via CVODE across the hydrodynamics time step.

        <p>We plot stellar mass and SFR properties of central galaxies in our haloes in Fig. 1 using M5.3 zooms. We run the SUBFIND algorithm (Springel et al. 2001;Dolag et al. 2009) on our zoom outputs, and quantify halo mass, M 200 , as the mass within a sphere with mean enclosed density 200× the critical overdensity centred on the galaxy's potential minimum. Galaxy stellar masses (M * ) and SFRs are calculated by summing the appropriate quantities within a 30 physical kpc sphere around the centre of the central subhalo, which almost always hosts the most massive galaxy. The top left-hand panel of Fig. 1 plots the M * /(M 200 × f bar ) abundance matching relation, where f bar ≡ b / m , for central galaxies from the six redshifts we examine. While our M5.3 haloes follow the shape of the relationship recovered by Behroozi, Wechsler &amp; Conroy (2013) and Moster, Naab &amp; White (2013) at z = 0.2, they are ∼0.2-0.4 dex lower for M 200 10 12 M . As discussed earlier, our use of particle metallicities reduces stellar masses by 0.1 dex compared with the smoothed metallicity simulations used to calibrate the feedback efficiencies. Moreover, S15 also find stellar masses 0.2-0.3 dex lower than the abundance matching constraints (Behroozi et al. 2013;Moster et al. 2013) at M 200 = 10 12.0 M at z = 0.1 (RECAL-L025N0752 shown as a thick yellow line with shading for 1σ dispersion).We plot stellar mass and SFR properties of central galaxies in our haloes in Fig. 1 using M5.3 zooms.

We use the criterion that there should not be any galaxies with M * &gt; 2 × 10 10 M within an impact parameter b = 300 kpc, first to ensure that our galaxy is the most massive system inside this impact parameter, and secondly because we usually do not simulate surrounding galaxies beyond 3R 200 .

These maps are generated using the SKIRT radiative transfer code (Baes et al. 2011;Camps &amp; Baes 2015) as described in detail by Trayford et al. (in preparation).</p>
        <p>This section begins by exploring CGM properties across two decades in halo mass, from sub-L * haloes (M 200 10 11.7 M ) through L * haloes (M 200 ∼ 10 12 M ) to group-sized, super-L * haloes (M 200 10 12.3 M ). We further explore the physical trends that establish the ionization structure of the oxygen-enriched CGM. Lastly, we focus on the nature and origin of the O VI that is observed by the COS-Halos survey. Throughout we use M5.3 zooms.This section begins by exploring CGM properties across two decades in halo mass, from sub-L * haloes (M 200 10 11.7 M ) through L * haloes (M 200 ∼ 10 12 M ) to group-sized, super-L * haloes (M 200 10 12.3 M ).

        <p>To better understand the halo trends of the CGM distributions with mass, we show in Fig. 5 physical gas properties as a function of fractional virial radius at z = 0.205. The top left-hand panel shows n H including all gas (CGM+ISM) as a function of r/R 200 . We use thick lines to indicate the mean profiles for sub-L * (M 200 &lt; 10 11.7 M , blue), L * (10 11.7 ≤ M 200 &lt; 10 12.3 M , aquamarine), and groupsized (M 200 ≥ 10 12.3 , orange) haloes. Sub-L * galaxies achieve the highest inner densities and the lowest outer densities, while for groups the inner radial profiles ( 1/3R 200 ) are nearly flat. ISM gas, defined as gas having SFR &gt; 0, is not included in these plots, so there is more dense CGM gas around the lower mass galaxies that have higher sSFR. However, the density of extended 'coronal' gas (1/3R 200 r R 200 ) is higher for group haloes, owing to inefficient cooling at &gt;10 6 K enabling them to retain higher pressure gas. All haloes are centred on the minimum of the gravitational potential, although one 10 12.9 M halo is undergoing a major merger, causing the density to dive inside 1/3R 200 and neither galaxy coincides precisely with the potential minimum. The gas metallicities in the top right-hand panel are highest for L * haloes in the centre, lower for sub-L * throughout the entire halo, and lower for group haloes in the inner regions. The curves for individual haloes are noisier in this plot compared to the density plot, because satellite galaxies influence radial metallicities more than radial densities; groups have the greatest number of satellites and thus more peaks overall. The bottom left-hand panel showing the radial O VI fraction (x O VI ) shows as strong of a trend of any of the panels in Fig. 5. The peak in x O VI moves to larger fractional radius and declines with increasing halo mass. The sub-L * galaxies achieve x O VI as high as 10 per cent at ∼R 200 , because the lower pressures allow oxygen at photoionized O VI temperatures, and therefore greater O VI fractions (Oppenheimer &amp; Davé 2009) essentially nosedives, owing to hotter temperatures. Collisionally ionized O VI does exist at ∼10 5.5 K in group haloes, but the higher pressures mean higher densities, leading to faster cooling times through this temperature regime.To better understand the halo trends of the CGM distributions with mass, we show in Fig. 5 physical gas properties as a function of fractional virial radius at z = 0.205.

        <p>Thus far we have focused on the trends of oxygen and O VI with halo mass, and we now shift our focus to the distribution and origin of oxygen-enriched gas in the CGM. We plot the oxygen content as a function of radius for our standard L * haloes in the top lefthand panel of Fig. 6. Green shading on the bottom shows the O VI fraction of the oxygen budget peaking between one and two R 200 , which are represented by vertical dotted lines. It is notable that there are five oxygen ions with greater contributions than O VI, and that O VI is one of the most spatially extended ions. This is the general result for L * haloes, O VI resides primarily beyond R 200 or at ∼200-500 kpc.

        <p>In the bottom left-hand panel of Fig. 6, we show the 'age' of the CGM, by plotting the last time a CGM particle was in the ISM of a galaxy, which is defined as the last time the gas particle was star forming (either in the central galaxy or a satellite). The vast majority of metals in the CGM were previously in the ISM and launched by superwind feedback into the CGM as found in other SPH simulations (Crain et al. 2013;Ford et al. 2014). The grey shading shows the oxygen-weighted age distribution as a function of radii, showing an age-radius anticorrelation, where larger radii and lower overdensities are enriched by higher redshift progenitors when halo potentials are lower and comoving distances are physically smaller (Davé &amp; Oppenheimer 2007;Wiersma et al. 2010;Oppenheimer et al. 2012;Crain et al. 2013;Ford et al. 2014). O VI has a mean enrichment redshift of z ∼ 1.2 at 300 kpc. Our simulations suggest that the average age of O VI is ∼6 Gyr, and it is thus not associated with the on-going SF traced by observational indicators, which probe galactic star formation on a much more recent timescale, i.e. 100 Myr.In the bottom left-hand panel of Fig. 6, we show the 'age' of the CGM, by plotting the last time a CGM particle was in the ISM of a galaxy, which is defined as the last time the gas particle was star forming (either in the central galaxy or a satellite).

The O VI is hardly visible on this linear plot, peaking at nearly 2R 200 . This group halo is dominated by ions that are only observable in the X-ray, with O IX dominating within R 200 . By plotting the oxygen distributions on a physical rather than fractional virial scale, we emphasize the stark contrast between the linear distributions of oxygen between L * and group haloes within 1 Mpc. The progenitors of this central passive galaxy have injected most of their metals at z ∼ 2 where they now reside at larger radii relative to the L * haloes, both in terms of physical distance and fractional virial distance.In the right-hand panels of Fig. 6, we plot the relative oxygen content and age distribution around our largest group.

Instead, we select the M5.3 simulated galaxy with the most similar M * and sSFR that are closest to the observed values from as many as six output redshifts (z = 0.250, 0.205, 0.149, 0.099, 0.053, 0.0) for which we have run our NEQ zooms for a sufficient time (t &gt; 300 Myr). Our galaxies evolve little over this redshift, except for the cases where there are mergers. We find that the O VI does not evolve significantly over this redshift range either, which we discuss later. The main rationale for this choice is to obtain more passive galaxies that satisfy the isolation criteria, because neighbours are either beyond 300 kpc at earlier snapshots, or, more often, merge into a single galaxy to satisfy the isolation criteria at later snapshots.

(2012) to calculate the total error on the sSFR, which are added in quadrature to the error on M * resulting in δsSFR = 0.30-0.37 dex. SMOHALOS applies a Gaussian dispersion seeded by a random number to the values of the simulated galaxies for the given impact parameter. We choose the simulated galaxy closest on the M * -sSFR plane to the observed galaxy given the errors. We run 100 such realizations of SMOHALOS to construct 100 simulated COS-Halos galaxy samples using different random number seeds. Fig. 7, top left, shows a typical SMOHALOS mock sample, plotted as circles, on the M * -sSFR plane, with the COS-Halos galaxies plotted as squares for galaxies with O VI detections and diamonds for galaxies with O VI upper limits. Error bars indicate uncertainties on observations. The galaxies are colour coded by their O VI columns in both cases. It is immediately apparent that while our galaxies generally reproduce the star-forming and passive distributions seen by COS-Halos, we do not always obtain the same range of properties.

        <p>We plot the SMOHALOS O VI columns against halo mass in the bottom right-hand panel of Fig. 7 to show that O VI correlates strongly with M 200 , even more so than with the central galaxy sSFR (top right-hand panel). This plot nearly mirrors the trend of the 150 kpc aperture columns in Fig. 4, in part because there is not much dependence of N O VI on impact parameter. However, there is greater scatter when choosing pencil beams corresponding to individual sight lines rather than taking an averaged aperture column. The colour coding of symbols in both plots indicates that the scatter in group sSFR primarily contributes to the reduced correlation in the N O VI -sSFR relation relative to that in the N O VI -M 200 relation. We suggest that the trend of N O VI with sSFR found by COS-Halos is driven by halo mass rather than star formation activity.We plot the SMOHALOS O VI columns against halo mass in the bottom right-hand panel of Fig. 7 to show that O VI correlates strongly with M 200 , even more so than with the central galaxy sSFR (top right-hand panel).

        <p>Subdividing galaxies into star forming and passive samples using an sSFR cut of 10 -11 yr -1 , SMOHALOS recovers a median log[N O VI /cm -2 ] = 14.13 for the 'blue' sample (27 galaxies) and 13.20 for the passive 'red' sample (12 galaxies). The corresponding COS-Halos numbers are 14.57 and &lt;14.14, respectively, the latter being an upper limit, owing to most passive COS-Halos columns being non-detections. The typical column density of our blue sample is thus a factor of 2.8 × too low, and even if we take the SMOHALOS sample with the strongest median O VI column of the 100 realizations, log[N O VI /cm -2 ] = 14.27, the column density is 2.0 × too low.Subdividing galaxies into star forming and passive samples using an sSFR cut of 10 -11 yr -1 , SMOHALOS recovers a median log[N O VI /cm -2 ] = 14.13 for the 'blue' sample (27 galaxies) and 13.20 for the passive 'red' sample (12 galaxies).

        <p>The interpretation of the comparison to the passive sample of 12 galaxies is more ambiguous owing to the COS-Halos nondetections. The median O VI column density may be consistent between COS-Halos and the SMOHALOS catalogues; however, we never produce O VI columns around passive galaxies in the range of 10 14.2-14.4 cm -2 , as high as the three strongest COS-Halos passive detections. We suspect that our SMOHALOS sample may be cleaner of neighbours than COS-Halos sample, because observations can miss surrounding galaxies owing to surface brightness limits.

        <p>We now consider the total amount of oxygen formed in galaxies, and the phases this metal occupies at z = 0.2. Following Peeples et al.

        <p>We measure that EAGLE oxygen yields are on average 2.7 per cent of M * at z = 0.2. Even though EAGLE employs metallicity-dependent yields, this makes negligible difference for the summed oxygen yield. This value is nearly the same as found by P14 who adopted an oxygen yield of 1.5 per cent for the zero-age main-sequence and calculated an average multiple of 1.8 to account for the fact that ≈55 per cent of the stellar mass survives to z = 0, based on Leitner (2012) star formation histories (i.e. 1.5 per cent × 1.8 = 2.7 per cent). It is not surprising that these two calculations agree, because we are using similar yields tabulated by Wiersma et al. (2009b) as P14, and because we are self-consistently following the star formation histories accounting for stellar evolution. 2 One difference with respect to P14 is that we plot the total oxygen generated by all galaxies residing in the galactic halo, instead of just the central galaxy. This makes a marginal difference for L * and sub-L * galaxies, but the difference is quite noticeable for group-sized haloes since the stellar mass becomes less dominated by the group central; less than half the stellar mass resides in the central for haloes of M 200 10 13.0 M .

        <p>The stellar oxygen content (red bars) follows the P14 trend with L * and group haloes having similar oxygen fractions in stars (their fig. 12), but our sub-L * galaxies (M * ∼ 10 9 M ) have marginally higher stellar oxygen content, which is consistent with the EAGLE- RECAL simulation (S15) exhibiting slightly higher stellar metallicities content than inferred observationally by Gallazzi et al.

The ISM oxygen content increases at lower mass, owing to higher gas fractions; the stellar mass-ISM metallicity relationship (i.e. the MZR) in the EAGLE-RECAL prescription reproduces the observed decline with mass (Tremonti et al. 2004;Zahid et al. 2014).

We plot this CGM oxygen within 2R 200 in Fig. 10 categorized by ion. The eight ions plotted (O I through O VIII) plus O IX (not plotted due to its unobservable nature) sum to unity. Ions lower than O VI dominate the CGM associated with sub-L * and many L * galaxies, while ions above O VI always dominate the CGM of group haloes, often at the 80-95 per cent level indicating the need for a wide-area space-borne telescope sensitive to soft X-rays to account for the diffuse oxygen around groups.The first result that more oxygen exists outside galaxies was also inferred by P14.

        <p>Even for L * haloes, for which O VI is the strongest, O VI contributes only a small fraction of the oxygen content of the CGM, which reflects this ion's maximal ≈5 per cent radial ion fraction (Section 3.1). We plot the CGM within 2R 200 , because O VI barely shows up on a plot with the limit of &lt;R 200 . The most common ion is O VII, which makes up 23-50 per cent of the circumgalactic oxygen at &lt;2R 200 between M 200 = 10 11.8 and 10 13.0 M . It is almost as if nature conspires to hide diffuse oxygen (and most oxygen generated by stars) from our telescopes, since O VI is the most 'easily' observable CGM ion. Nonetheless, O VI represents a powerful probe that we argue arises so strongly around L * galaxies owing to its temperature tracing the virial temperature of L * haloes.Even for L * haloes, for which O VI is the strongest, O VI contributes only a small fraction of the oxygen content of the CGM, which reflects this ion's maximal ≈5 per cent radial ion fraction (Section 3.1).

        <p>In the bottom panel of Fig. 10 we plot the oxygen fractions assuming collisional ionization equilibrium at the virial temperature T vir according to equation (1). Our simulated haloes are of course not isothermal out to 2R 200 , and show a far greater diversity of oxygen ionization states, which in part owes to the neglect of photoionization in this simplistic assumption, but most importantly owes to the complex temperature and density structure of the CGM. Nonetheless, our simulated O VI fractions decline at a similar halo mass, ∼10 12.3 M , as this simple model predicts, which clearly supports our conclusion that O VI traces the virial temperatures of L * haloes, and not those of group-sized haloes. Going to sub-L * haloes, 10 11.7 M , the simulated haloes do not show a decline in O VI as predicted by the isothermal model, because photoionization begins to dominate at these masses.In the bottom panel of Fig. 10 we plot the oxygen fractions assuming collisional ionization equilibrium at the virial temperature T vir according to equation (1).

        <p>Hence, our second main result from Fig. 9 is that up to half of the oxygen generated by an L * galaxy resides outside of R 200 in the low-z Universe. The implications for galaxy formation models are profound. Not only is the closed-box model of galaxy growth inaccurate due to continuous accretion on to galaxies, the idea that galaxies return products of star formation to extended CGM reservoirs from which they can later re-accrete (e.g. Bower et al. 2006;Oppenheimer et al. 2010;Guo et al. 2011;Henriques et al. 2015) may also be incorrect. The median oxygen content inside R 200 for group-sized haloes (M 200 = 10 12.7-13.3 M ) is 69 per cent, which is somewhat higher than that of L * haloes (M 200 = 10 11.7-12.3 M ) at 62 per cent. The increase of metals retained in higher mass haloes should be expected as larger haloes have deeper potential wells and physically larger virial radii. However, the reverse trend may apply because group-sized haloes have more star formation at early times when the Universe is physically smaller and halo potentials are shallower, which allow winds to travel to greater comoving distances. Additionally, group-sized haloes contain multiple large galaxies with large satellites more likely to lose their metals from a group halo, because they currently reside further from the halo centre and additionally may have fallen in at late times. Therefore, the moderate increase in metals retained inside R 200 from 10 12 to 10 13 M haloes may represent several competing trends. Finally, the space between the top of the faded green bars and the black horizontal line in Fig. 9 is oxygen ejected beyond 2R vir , which usually resides in the low-density IGM.Hence, our second main result from Fig. 9 is that up to half of the oxygen generated by an L * galaxy resides outside of R 200 in the low-z Universe.

We plot pressure as a function of halo mass at 0.3 and 1.0 × R 200 in Fig. 11. To calculate a pressure at a given radius and temperature, we take the median CGM gas density with a 0.1 dex spread in radius and temperature, and compute P/k = n H T/(X H μ), where k is the Boltzmann constant, X H is the mass fraction of hydrogen, and μ is the mean molecular weight.

In the L * range, there are copious amounts of gas at T &lt; 10 5 K (purple and blue circles) and T ≥ 10 6 K (yellow, orange, and red circles). Very little mass exists at 10 5.0 and 10 5.5 K (cyan and green circles), because gas cools rapidly through this temperature regime. When the cooling times become longer at T 10 4.5 K, gas is at a significantly lower pressure, which indicates this gas is not cooling isobarically. By the time the gas reaches 10 4 K where cooling times are long, it becomes closer to achieving pressure equilibrium with gas with 100× more thermal energy. Thus, the interiors of L * haloes inhibit long-lived collisionally ionized, T ∼ 10 5.5 K, O VI owing to rapid cooling through the coronal regime, as well as cool, T &lt; 10 5 K, O VI owing to high pressures forcing cold gas to densities that are too high to be photoionized by the Haardt &amp; Madau (2001) background. In contrast, at R 200 where the densities are lower and the cooling times are longer, the dominant phase is 10 5.5 K (green circles), where O VI is a more effective tracer of the gas.The first point to note is that the CGM is multiphase, especially inside 0.3R 200 .

        <p>Our findings suggest that the O VI-sSFR correlation discovered by COS-Halos is an indirect correlation, and that the fundamental trend is O VI tracing virialized enriched gas at temperatures close to 10 5.5 K, where the O VI fraction peaks. Passive central galaxies with mass M * ∼ 10 10.5 M reside in higher mass haloes than active galaxies with a similar mass. The higher virial temperatures of the haloes hosting the passive galaxies lead to significantly lower O VI fractions. While the CGM metal content increases with halo mass, O VI is not an effective tracer of haloes with mass 10 12 M . The CGM oxygen budget cannot be directly linked to recent star formation, which we demonstrated by showing that the typical age of O VI is greater than 5 Gyr and represents the cumulative ejection of metals by galactic superwinds over a Hubble time.Our findings suggest that the O VI-sSFR correlation discovered by COS-Halos is an indirect correlation, and that the fundamental trend is O VI tracing virialized enriched gas at temperatures close to 10 5.5 K, where the O VI fraction peaks.

        <p>If the O VI were to trace metals originating from the star formation determined through observational indicators, then the time to travel to 150 kpc would imply a very high outflow speed. A &gt;1500 km s -1 wind is necessary to travel this distance in &lt;100 Myr, which is the timescale for the observed SF indicators to be linked to recent SF. Such high-velocity winds are rarely if at all present in our simulated L * haloes at low-z, which is also supported by recent observations of outflows around star-forming galaxies in the evolved Universe. A number of campaigns have observed blueshifted, lowion absorption wings extending to at most a few hundred km s -1 from the galaxy, almost always at velocities unable to escape the gravitational potential of the halo (e.g. Bouché et al. 2012;Martin et al. 2012;Rubin et al. 2014;Chisholm et al. 2015;Nielsen et al. 2015).If the O VI were to trace metals originating from the star formation determined through observational indicators, then the time to travel to 150 kpc would imply a very high outflow speed.

        <p>We predict the amount of metals residing in low-redshift CGM reservoirs to be larger than the amount of metals in galaxies including stars and the ISM. Despite the high O VI column densities around L * galaxies, the summed O VI ionization fractions are only 0.9-1.3 per cent in CGM gas within R 200 and increase to 2.2-3.4 per cent when including CGM oxygen within 2R 200 . This is still higher than the global IGM O VI correction of ∼1 per cent reported by Rahmati et al. (2016) for the EAGLE 100 Mpc box at low-z. Assuming x O VI = 20 per cent thus severely underestimates the CGM oxygen content. This is not surprising since collisionally ionized O VI has a very small temperature range around 10 5.5 K where it approaches its maximal x O VI of ≈20 per cent.We predict the amount of metals residing in low-redshift CGM reservoirs to be larger than the amount of metals in galaxies including stars and the ISM.

        <p>We emphasize the dramatic decline O VI takes as one transitions from L * to group haloes, and note the strength of the N O VI -M 200 correlation. The average O VI absorption within 150 kpc for every L * halo in the range of 10 11.7 &lt; M 200 &lt; 10 12.2 M is higher than for every group halo in the range 10 12.6 &lt; M 200 &lt; 10 13.3 M , where each subsample contains more than 10 haloes. The O VI column densities within 150 kpc decline by a factor of 5 when considering isolated galaxies, and by a factor of 3.5 when considering all galaxies, when transitioning from L * to group haloes. In contrast, the oxygen columns within 150 kpc increase by nearly a factor of 3 for the isolated sample and by more than a factor of 4.5 for all galaxies moving to higher mass. Hence, the average O VI ionization fraction for the CGM inside R 200 is almost a factor of 20 lower for groupsized haloes, such that x O VI ∼ 0.1 per cent.We emphasize the dramatic decline O VI takes as one transitions from L * to group haloes, and note the strength of the N O VI -M 200 correlation.

        <p>The inability of our simulated ions to reproduce the higher O VI column densities observed by COS-Halos around blue L * galaxies is worth discussing in greater depth. As noted in Section 4, we find about 2 × too little O VI within 150 kpc using the M5.3 zooms, with the greatest deviation being within 75 kpc (≈3 ×).

        <p>We note that our stellar masses are too low by a factor of ∼2 in these zooms compared with abundance matching constraints. In Appendix B, we explore the higher resolution M4.4 zooms, finding that O VI is slightly stronger (0.06 dex) around L * galaxies, but the stellar masses decline by 0.18 dex making a 3× discrepancy with abundance matching. Recalibrating the EAGLE model is necessary at higher resolution, and it may be that through the generation of more stars, more oxygen is produced and ejected into the CGM, which creates even higher O VI column densities than in the M4.4 zooms. Indeed, Rahmati et al. (2016) found that across different EAGLE models, the integrated metal ion column density distributions scaled nearly linearly with the integrated stellar mass. It may also be possible that there exists enough freedom in superwind feedback implementations to change O VI columns by a factor of 2, while still successfully reproducing the large array of galaxy observables at many redshifts as the EAGLE prescription does.We note that our stellar masses are too low by a factor of ∼2 in these zooms compared with abundance matching constraints.

        <p>Another possibility is that the low stellar masses in our M5.3 zooms could lead to a mismatched selection of overmassive haloes, where we have shown O VI to be weaker. To test this hypothesis, we run SMOHALOS where we artificially increase the M5.3 stellar masses by 0.3 dex in accordance with abundance matching constraints, and find essentially no difference in the median O VI column densities.

        <p>A third possibility is that the original COS-Halos galaxy-selected sample exhibits Malmquist bias, which we cannot replicate using SMOHALOS applied to a limited set of zoom haloes. The COS-Halos galaxies were selected photometrically, which can lead to a biased sample of higher star-forming and/or more massive galaxies from a Schechter function. While SMOHALOS attempts to match galaxies based on M * and sSFR, we do not have a large enough sample to reproduce the high SFRs observed in COS-Halos (Werk et al. 2012). For example, 3 per cent of SMOHALOS galaxies have SFR &gt;3.0 M yr -1 compared to 18 per cent of COS-Halos, and we have no galaxies with SFR &gt; 5.0 M yr -1 compared to 8 per cent of the COS-Halos. Whereas COS-Halos selects star-forming galaxies from a large cosmic volume, our L * zooms are selected from a 25-Mpc box. Hence, we may not produce the O VI absorption columns observed in COS-Halos, because we are not simulating the same galaxies.A third possibility is that the original COS-Halos galaxy-selected sample exhibits Malmquist bias, which we cannot replicate using SMOHALOS applied to a limited set of zoom haloes.

        <p>Finally, we assume a slowly evolving extragalactic background (Haardt &amp; Madau 2001) without any local sources of ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation from nearby star formation can increase O VI columns as demonstrated by Vasiliev et al. (2015) who found that x O VI can reach 0.4-0.9 and reproduce COS-Halos O VI observations, albeit under specifically chosen conditions conducive to the photoionization of O VI. This model could invalidate our conclusion that O VI traces the virial temperature of L * haloes and not that of group haloes, because photo-ionization requires &lt;10 5 K gas, although it could be argued that both cold gas and ionizing photons from star formation decline in group haloes. Suresh et al. (2015b) show that O VI can be significantly enhanced by local sources of ionizing radiation, but only within 50 kpc using a 100 per cent escape fraction for soft X-rays from a SFR = 10 M yr -1 galaxy, which are unrealistic assumptions for COS-Halos.Finally, we assume a slowly evolving extragalactic background (Haardt &amp; Madau 2001) without any local sources of ionizing radiation.

        <p>However, we suggest the possibility that photoionization of O VI could be part of the solution, owing to fluctuating AGN 'flash' ionizing their CGM. Oppenheimer &amp; Schaye (2013b) introduced the concept of AGN proximity zone fossils, where 'cool' 10 4 K gas is ionized by a halo's central AGN that subsequently turns off leaving the surrounding CGM overionized for a time similar to the recombination timescale of diffuse gas, which can equal or exceed the typical time between AGN episodes. They showed that Seyfertlevel AGN that are on for 10 per cent of the time can enhance O VI levels by &gt;1 dex after the AGN turns off. The effect may be particularly relevant for cool metals at n H = 10 -3 -10 -4 cm -3 where CGM metals exist in our simulations, and the relevant recombination timescales for O VI range from 2 to 20 Myr. Thus a short Seyfert 'burst' lasting ∼0.1-1 Myr within the past ∼10-20 Myr can enhance O VI at the expense of lower oxygen ions, which normally trace this gas in equilibrium with the Haardt &amp; Madau (2001) field. The COS-Halos galaxies do not show AGN activity (Werk et al. 2012) and are thus in the off-phase. The O VI nearer to the AGN should be more enhanced by the proximity zone fossil effect, which would agree with COS-Halos data showing O VI increasing at small impact parameter more steeply than our SMOHALOS realizations. This hypothesis requires a significant fraction of COS-Halos blue galaxies to be recent AGN.However, we suggest the possibility that photoionization of O VI could be part of the solution, owing to fluctuating AGN 'flash' ionizing their CGM.

        <p>To test the impact of AGN thermal feedback (i.e. not the proximity fossil effect discussed above) on CGM O VI, we run a single group halo (Grp004), which has M 200 = 10 12.89 M at z = 0.205, turning off SMBH growth and AGN feedback.

        <p>In contrast to Suresh et al.

Passive COS-Halos galaxies reside in higher mass haloes than their active counterparts, which have virial temperatures that are too high for O VI. Our NoAGN halo has almost 3 × as many stars in the central galaxy and CGM metals within R 200 as the standard run, but, almost coincidentally, a similar amount of O VI owing to the lower x O VI as a result of having less 10 5-6 K gas in the inner halo. Another big difference is that the NoAGN run has a SFR =6.8 M yr -1 , which creates a type of isolated galaxy rarely observed in the z 0.2 Universe.In contrast to Suresh et al.

        <p>(iv) The global O VI fractions of our L * haloes range x O VI = 0.9-1.3 per cent, which means that far more oxygen exists in other ionization states, both lower and higher than O VI. Most O VI observed around L * galaxies observed at impact parameters b &lt; 150 kpc is at physical separations of r = 200-500 kpc (≈1-2R 200 ) from the galaxy.

        <p>(v) Group haloes hosting passive galaxies often have global x O VI ∼ 0.01 per cent inside R 200 , and the majority of circumgalactic oxygen is completely ionized (O IX).

This column density is 3.5 × lower than for L * haloes (10 14.2 cm -2 ). Applying isolation criteria similar to COS-Halos galaxies, the mean O VI column density around group centrals falls to N O VI = 10 13.5 cm -2 , which is 5 × lower than for isolated L * haloes.

        <p>(vii) The majority of the oxygen produced and released by stars is ejected by superwind feedback beyond the optical extent of the galaxy, such that more oxygen exists in the CGM within 2R 200 than in the galactic component (stars+ISM). The progenitors of L * galaxies can eject more than half of their oxygen beyond R 200 by z = 0.2, although the fraction of oxygen remaining within R 200 (stars+ISM+CGM) averages 62 and 69 per cent for L * and group haloes, respectively. Enrichment at large radii primarily occurs at high z, especially for group haloes, when gravitational potentials were shallower and fixed comoving distances were physically smaller (Figs 6 and9).(vii) The majority of the oxygen produced and released by stars is ejected by superwind feedback beyond the optical extent of the galaxy, such that more oxygen exists in the CGM within 2R 200 than in the galactic component (stars+ISM).

        <p>(viii) O VII is the most abundant oxygen ion in the CGM for haloes between M 200 = 10 11.8 and 10 13.0 M , with between 23 and 50 per cent of the circumgalactic oxygen inside 2R 200 ionized to O VII.

        <p>(ix) We explore the role of AGN by running a 10 12.9 M group halo without AGN feedback, finding that it produces similar O VI column densities at b &lt; 150 kpc (10 13.3 cm -2 ) as our standard group haloes with AGN feedback. Hence, the bimodality of circumgalactic O VI column densities with sSFR does not owe to the removal of mass and metals from the haloes of galaxies with more active black holes, but is clearly an ionization effect of reduced x O VI in hot haloes (Fig. 12).(ix) We explore the role of AGN by running a 10 12.9 M group halo without AGN feedback, finding that it produces similar O VI column densities at b &lt; 150 kpc (10 13.3 cm -2 ) as our standard group haloes with AGN feedback.

        <p>In our simulations, the higher O VI column densities around starforming galaxies compared with passive galaxies are due to their virial temperatures being more favourable for a high O VI fraction rather than to higher total oxygen column densities. A key test of this explanation would be to observe our prediction of the greater total oxygen content in the CGM of higher mass haloes, where O VI is no longer an effective tracer of CGM oxygen. Observing the soft X-ray ions O VII and O VIII out to the virial radius is beyond the scope of current facilities, although we will make predictions for upcoming facilities in future work. Unfortunately, absorption lines capable of tracing &gt;10 6 K metals are at extreme UV energies, which shifts them out of the COS wavelength coverage at low redshift.In our simulations, the higher O VI column densities around starforming galaxies compared with passive galaxies are due to their virial temperatures being more favourable for a high O VI fraction rather than to higher total oxygen column densities.

        <p>NEQ effects are generally small when considering circumgalactic O VI within 150 kpc exposed to a slowly evolving ionization background such as that specified by Haardt &amp; Madau (2001). Fig. A1 shows the O VI column density in the equilibrium runs (cyan) and the NEQ runs (grey) at z = 0.205. The bottom panel shows that the differences are small -equilibrium zooms have +0.01 and +0.02 dex greater columns than NEQ zooms for L * and group haloes, respectively. Column densities of high oxygen ions (O VI and above) typically differ by less than 30 per cent (0.1 dex) along individual lines of sight. The scatter is larger for group haloes with smaller O VI columns, where an episodic fluctuation can make a larger difference. Galaxy properties (M * and sSFR) are indistinguishable between the two sets of simulations.NEQ effects are generally small when considering circumgalactic O VI within 150 kpc exposed to a slowly evolving ionization background such as that specified by Haardt &amp; Madau (2001).

        <p>Our results appear to agree with Cen &amp; Fang (2006) and Yoshikawa &amp; Sasaki (2006), who find that NEQ effects matter for O VI mainly in the low-density, diffuse IGM where collisional ionization timescales become long compared to the timescales on which gas is shocked. One caveat is that we may underestimate the NEQ effects, because SPH smooths out shocks (Hutchings &amp; Figure A1.

Thick lines of the same colour in the top panel are binned averages.

        <p>We first compare matched haloes at the same resolution in the M5.3 L * zooms (grey) and in RECAL-L025N0752 (yellow, the difference with the grey circles indicated in the bottom panel). This comparison tests the effect of SPH-smoothing of elemental abundances, which is done in RECAL-L025N0752 but not in the zooms as discussed in Section 2.3.3. The other differences between these two runs are NEQ versus equilibrium, which was covered in Appendix A and is insignificant for M * and N O VI 150 , as well as the zoom method. We find 0.15 dex higher stellar masses for L * galaxies in RECAL-L025N0752, which closely matches the 0.11 dex higher stellar masses we find in five M5.3 smoothed-metallicity zooms. The O VI columns are essentially unchanged, being 0.03 dex lower in RECAL-L025N0752. Hence, metal smoothing slightly increases stellar masses but barely alters O VI CGM columns. This test also shows that our zooms do not statistically deviate from their parent simulations, so that our zoom results also hold for the EAGLE volumes.

        <p>For L * haloes, the M4.4 zooms have 0.06 dex higher O VI columns despite having 0.18 dex lower stellar masses as mentioned in Section 6.1. This means that a greater proportion of the oxygen formed in higher resolution simulations (since oxygen production ∝ M * ) appears as O VI within 150 kpc of the galaxy. The decline of O VI above M 200 &gt; 10 12.3 M however is robust with the three Gal010 haloes (M 200 = 10 12.42 , 10 12.58 , and 10 12.69 M ) showing a considerable decline in O VI columns relative to L * masses. These three haloes have O VI columns averaging 10 13.79 cm -2 , which is 3 × lower than the M4.4 L * columns -10 14.31 cm -2 , and the same decline as seen in the M5.3 zooms. Hence, the conclusion that O VI traces the virial temperature of L * haloes and therefore declines at higher masses is corroborated by these 8 × better mass resolution simulations. Nevertheless, the M4.4 zooms underpredict abundance matching constraints by a factor of ∼3, which implies that the stellar feedback indeed needs to be recalibrated at M4.4 resolution to inject less energy in order to create galaxies of the same stellar mass in the L * mass range.

        <p>The M6.2 zooms are the only galaxies run at this resolution using the RECAL prescription, because L100N1504 uses the REF parameter values. In the L * range, galaxy stellar masses are on average 0.09 dex higher than M5.3 while the O VI columns are 0.06 dex lower. This continues the trend seen with the M4.4 zooms of a greater proportion of oxygen produced by stars showing up as O VI within 150 kpc at higher resolution. The decline in O VI above M 200 = 10 12.3 M persists at M6.2 resolution. This trend is robust at all three resolutions, indicating a decline by a factor of 3 in O VI columns from L * to group haloes. The resolution convergence is better for N O VI 150 values than for M * across a factor of 64 in mass resolution; however, it should be noted that oxygen production is nearly linear with stellar mass, so that the over-riding trend is a greater fraction of oxygen produced at higher resolution becomes CGM O VI within 150 kpc.The M6.2 zooms are the only galaxies run at this resolution using the RECAL prescription, because L100N1504 uses the REF parameter values.

However, to compare to the main EAGLE simulations that use the 'REF' model at M6.2 resolution, we cross-reference the L * (10 11.7 -10 12.3 M ) haloes at M5.3 resolution to REF-L025N0376 (green in Figs B1 andB2) and the group (10 12.7 -10 13.3 M ) haloes to REF-L100N1504 (dark green) to perform a test of 'weak convergence' where the subgrid models are changed.

However, it must be noted that this sample includes all the haloes in 0.6 dex M 200 bins, which biases each bin to be dominated by haloes at the lower mass end of the bin (where there are more haloes) as opposed to the zooms chosen to more evenly sample the masses within these bins. Indeed, making the M 200 bins smaller (0.3 dex wide) in REF-L050N0752, leads to a slightly greater decline from 13.89 to 13.61.To generalize these statistics to all haloes in the EAGLE REF volumes, we find the average log[ N O VI 150 /cm -3 ] in L * (group) haloes using REF-L025N0376 (REF-L100N504) of (13.83) 13.61, where each sample contains at least 50 haloes.

While group halo O VI columns appear to not change much in the weak convergence limit, the O VI columns in L * haloes are significantly higher in the RECAL simulations, which affects both COS-Halos type observations and global IGM observations (Rahmati et al. 2016).The L * O VI columns are considerably smaller at REF resolution, which is again apparent when we look at all L * haloes in RECAL-L025N0752 finding N O VI 150 = 10 14.09 cm -2 , which is 0.26 dex higher than for REF-L025N0376.

        <p>NoAGN simulations. Finally, we consider the NoAGN-L050N0752 run (M6.2 resolution), and find log[ N O VI 150 /cm -2 ] =13.96 (13.58) for L * (group) haloes, which compares to 13.83 (13.66) in REF-L050N0752. Thus, the conclusion that AGN are not responsible for the reduction of O VI columns with mass as discussed in Section 6.2, holds also for this larger sample of group haloes, and the difference in O VI column density is actually stronger in the absence of AGN. Globally, there exists more O VI in the NoAGN models (Rahmati et al. 2016), which likely owes to L * haloes hosting more O VI while group haloes harbour less O VI within 150 kpc despite forming twice as many stars.NoAGN simulations.
