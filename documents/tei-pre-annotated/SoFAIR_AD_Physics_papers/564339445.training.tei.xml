        <p>The distribution of dark matter halo masses can be accurately predicted in the lambda cold dark matter ( CDM) cosmology. The presence of a single massive halo or galaxy at a particular redshift, assuming some baryon and stellar fraction for the latter, can therefore be used to test the underlying cosmological model. A number of recent measurements of very large galaxy stellar masses at high redshift ( z &gt; 8) moti v ate an investigation into whether any of these objects are in tension with CDM. We use extreme value statistics to generate confidence regions in the mass-redshift plane for the most extreme mass haloes and galaxies. Tests against numerical models show no tension, neither in their dark matter halo masses nor their galaxy stellar masses.

        <p>In the lambda cold dark matter ( CDM) paradigm, structure forms hierarchically in a bottom-up fashion, whereby density perturbations in the matter distribution at the time of inflation collapse first, then merge to form larger and larger structures. Within this framework, baryons fall in to virialized dark matter haloes and form galaxies (Somerville &amp; Dav é 2015 ). At late times ( z &lt; 2), the largest o v erdensities collapse to form galaxy clusters, &gt; 10 14 M ⊙ haloes hosting a hot, X-ray emitting intracluster medium and hundreds, sometimes thousands of galaxies. At earlier times ( z &gt; 2) clusters have yet to form; galaxies and their host haloes are the largest virialized objects in the universe.In the lambda cold dark matter ( CDM) paradigm, structure forms hierarchically in a bottom-up fashion, whereby density perturbations in the matter distribution at the time of inflation collapse first, then merge to form larger and larger structures.

        <p>In order to extend this approach to higher redshifts we require measurements of much lower halo masses than those hosting galaxy clusters. Unfortunately, such measurements are difficult, particularly at high redshift. Halo masses can be inferred from galaxy clustering, which has the benefit of not needing to assume the underlying baryonic physics, but cannot be used to measure the masses of individual objects. Abundance matching fixes the knee of the halo mass function to the knee of an observed luminosity function, but this explicitly uses features of the dark matter model to infer the halo masses. Another method is to measure the direct emission from the baryonic components of a galaxy, and assume some scaling with the total mass, or use spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling to MNRAS 518, 2511-2520 (2023) estimate the baryonic masses. These masses can then be combined with the cosmological baryon fraction, f b , and subsequent fractions of the rele v ant components, e.g. the stellar mass fraction f ⋆ , to deri ve the latent halo mass. Steinhardt et al. ( 2016 ) first explored this approach, assuming a mass-to-light ratio measured at z = 4 and a fixed stellar-halo mass relation, finding some tension with observations at 4 &lt; z &lt; 8. Behroozi &amp; Silk ( 2018 ) also implement this latter method, using the cosmic baryon fraction as an absolute upper limit on the ratio of galaxy stellar mass to halo mass ( f b ∼ 0.16; Planck Collaboration XIII 2016 ), whilst also allowing for redshift evolution in the stellar-halo mass relation.In order to extend this approach to higher redshifts we require measurements of much lower halo masses than those hosting galaxy clusters.

        <p>This relationship can be inverted to place an upper limit on the halo mass for an observed stellar mass, and then compared with predicted halo mass functions. They found that, at the time, no observed galaxies exceeded these conserv ati ve upper limits.

        <p>The EVS approach has a number of advantages o v er previous approaches. EVS mitigates the problem of the selection function in galaxy surv e ys; the most massiv e object acts as a lower limit on the most massive object one could have seen in a given survey. For estimates using full samples, uncertainty in the selection function can propagate into population measurements, e.g . the mean mass of your sample. As mentioned abo v e, EVS also pro vides two-sided constraints (upper and lower limits) on the most massive object, and naturally considers the uncertainty in the mass of that object for a giv en surv e y volume/area. By combining with realistic functional forms for the stellar and baryon fraction, EVS naturally incorporates uncertainty in these parameters.The EVS approach has a number of advantages o v er previous approaches.

        <p>Together, these equations can be used to estimate the EVS PDF for a constant redshift co-moving volume V , where the total number of haloes N = n tot V . 2 The IID assumption will be broken where haloes are significantly clustred. Where the volume probed is sufficiently large the distribution is essentially homogeneous. A number of studies have shown that this volume limit is achieved above ∼(100 Mpc) 3 (Gelb &amp; Bertschinger 1994 ;Power &amp; Knebe 2006 ;Reed et al. 2007 ;Davis et al. 2011 ). Another consideration when comparing to periodic simulations is the impact of finite-volume effects on the abundance of galaxies. In a given periodic volume there is a maximum fundamental mode that can be represented, and large-scale power on scales greater than the size of the simulation volume will not be captured. Additionally, only discrete modes can be represented in periodic volumes. These approximations can impact the halo mass function, particularly at the high-mass end where the effect of these large modes is more pronounced (Reed et al. 2007 ;DeRose et al. 2019 ). Ho we ver, the volume at which these effects become pronounced has been shown to be &lt; (100 Mpc) 3 ; Luki ć et al.

        <p>To calculate the EVS PDF, we must first assume a form for the halo mass function. We use the Behroozi et al. ( 2013 ) halo mass functions, which are calibrated using N -body simulations to the redshift range 2 ≤ z ≤ 8 based on the Tinker et al. ( 2008 ) mass functions (themselves derived from 0 &lt; z ≤ 2.5 data). The redshift evolution of the halo mass function parameters from Behroozi et al. ( 2013 ) has smoothed off at z &gt; 8, so we assume it is safe to extrapolate to these redshifts; we also note that we have tested using other forms for the mass function, and found little impact on our conclusions. Fig. 1 shows the halo mass function for a range of redshifts, along with the PDF for the highest mass halo on a constant redshift hypersurface, with volume (100 Mpc)3 , predicted by EVS.

To test our results, we compare to predictions for the most massive halo from two hydrodynamic cosmological simulations. The fiducial EAGLE simulation (Crain et al. 2015 ;Schaye et al. 2015 ) is a (100 Mpc) 3 cosmological v olume ev olving both dark matter and baryons selfconsistently.

Since FLARES is not a continuous periodic box, one must calculate the 'ef fecti ve volume' of the combined zoom regions, which is dependent on the mass/luminosity of the selected galaxies. We use a fixed ef fecti ve volume of (550 Mpc) 3 , which roughly corresponds to that for the most massive halo/galaxy at all redshifts.

To do this, we calculate the PDF for narrow redshift intervals ( z = 0.2, where the number of bins is chosen so that N bins &gt; &gt; N galaxies ). 3 Each bin can be thought of as a Bernoulli trial, therefore there is a non-zero probability of exceeding a given contour threshold; we have tested and found that, for our chosen binning, this probability is negligible.

        <p>To convert our PDF for the halo distribution to a PDF for the galaxy stellar mass, we must account for both the baryon fraction, f b , and the stellar fraction, f ⋆ . The baryon fraction is set by our assumed cosmology ( f b = 0.16; Planck Collaboration XIII 2016 ). We assume a fixed value, though we note that this v alue can v ary in dif ferent cosmic environments (e.g . lower than the universal value in local galaxy clusters (Gonzalez et al. 2013 ). This is an effect that could be accounted for by using a functional distribution for f b , though we note that at high redshifts deviations from the universal value are not expected to be as large, due to the shorter time for feedback effects to have imprinted on baryon distributions.To convert our PDF for the halo distribution to a PDF for the galaxy stellar mass, we must account for both the baryon fraction, f b , and the stellar fraction, f ⋆ .

        <p>To compare our theoretical mass functions with observations, we need to correct for Eddington Bias (Eddington 1913 ). For haloes, the steepness of the mass function means there are significantly more low-mass haloes than high mass, so there is greater upscatter of low-mass halo measurements than down scatter of higher mass halo measurements, boosting the apparent number of higher mass haloes. The same effect applies to galaxy stellar masses. We correct using the following:To compare our theoretical mass functions with observations, we need to correct for Eddington Bias (Eddington 1913 ).

        <p>In the short time since the first data from JWST was released there have been a number of studies estimating the redshifts and stellar masses of high-redshift galaxies (e.g .

Many of these have proposed candidates that lie at the extremes of the redshift-stellar mass plane. Here, we test using the EVS framework whether any of these candidates are in tension with CDM. Labbe et al. ( 2022 ) presented seven &gt; 10 10 M ⊙ candidates at 7 &lt; z &lt; 11 in a 40 arcmin 2 area, taken from the 
            <rs type="software">CEERS</rs> program, using 
            <rs type="software">EAZY</rs> and 
            <rs type="software">PROSPECTOR</rs> for the photometric redshift and stellar mass estimates, respectively. The top left panel of Fig. 6 shows these candidates on the stellar mass-redshift plane, with the EVS PDF for an identical surv e y area. 5 out of the 7 candidates lie abo v e the 3 σ upper limits assuming a stellar fraction of unity. Since they do not provide error estimates on the stellar masses we cannot e v aluate the effect of Eddington bias, but if we assume 0.3 dex errors this relieves the tension with 3 of these candidates, leaving only 2 outside of the 3 σ contours assuming a lognormal stellar fraction.

Already a number of objects detected in recent years (pre-JWST ) are in tension with the predicted distributions (Tacchella et al. 2022b ), assuming e ven conserv ati ve limits on the conversion of baryons into stars, and a number of the first candidates from early JWST data are also in significant tension (Donnan et al. 2022 ;Labbe et al. 2022 ;Naidu et al. 2022b ;Rodighiero et al. 2022 ). We stress, ho we ver, that it is entirely plausible that these objects are not in tension with CDM, and that instead there are unaccounted for uncertainties in their redshift or stellar mass estimates.The use of extreme value statistics is a powerful means of understanding the likelihood of the most massive objects in the Univ erse, complementing e xisting approaches (Steinhardt et al. 2016 ;Behroozi &amp; Silk 2018 ;Boylan-Kolchin 2022 ).

        <p>Redshift estimates of high-redshift sources are often multimodal, leaving the possibility that many high redshift candidates are, in fact, low-redshift interlopers (see Zavala et al. 2022 ) and the understanding of the necessary JWST instrument calibration is evolving (Adams et al. 2022 ). With re gards to stellar mass, estimates are sensitiv e to a number of modelling assumptions during the SED fitting process, such as the assumed initial mass function (IMF) and stellar population synthesis (SPS) model. A clear example of this is the z ∼ 17 object analysed by Donnan et al. ( 2022 ), Harikane et al. ( 2022a ), andNaidu et al. ( 2022b ); the estimates from these different studies, using a variety of different modelling assumptions, co v er almost 1 dex in stellar mass.Redshift estimates of high-redshift sources are often multimodal, leaving the possibility that many high redshift candidates are, in fact, low-redshift interlopers (see Zavala et al. 2022 ) and the understanding of the necessary JWST instrument calibration is evolving (Adams et al. 2022 ).

        <p>At the highest redshifts, it is possible that Population III star formation may contribute up to 3-4 times the number of UV photons (Harikane et al. 2022a ), boosting nebular emission in the rest-frame optical, which can bias stellar mass and SFR estimates. These first stars are also expected to have a significantly top heavy IMF, which can complicate their interpretation using standard SPS models. The assumed prior on the star formation history can also have a large effect on derived stellar mass estimates (Whitler et al. 2022 ;Tacchella et al. 2022a ;Tacchella et al. 2022b ). Models suggest high redshift galaxies have rising star formation histories (Finlator, Oppenheimer &amp; Dav é 2011 ;Wilkins et al. 2022 ); using incompatible functional forms can lead to significant biases (Carnall et al. 2019 ). Steinhardt et al. ( 2022 ) recently highlighted the impact of using templates calibrated or derived from lower redshift conditions, leading to offsets in stellar mass estimates of high-redshift sources of up to 1-1.6 dex. Mason, Trenti &amp; Treu ( 2022 ) estimate the maximal UV luminosity assuming all gas in a halo is converted into stars over a time-scale that maximizes the UV emission ( ∼10 Myr), and found that the upper limit derived is higher than that measured in recent HST &amp; JWST results (Bouwens et al. 2021 ;Donnan et al. 2022 ). AGN contamination can also bias both stellar mass and redshift estimates (see Inayoshi et al. 2022 ), and may be a particularly pertinent contaminant in the analysis presented here; it is in the most massive haloes that the most massive central black holes are expected to reside. Ho we ver, the EVS formalism presented here does allow us to place wide priors on these processes, producing self-consistent PDFs that take into account many of these uncertainties. As our understanding of the physics of galaxy formation at high redshift impro v es, these priors can be narro wed, allo wing for more precise limits on the maximum halo and stellar mass at a given redshift to be made.At the highest redshifts, it is possible that Population III star formation may contribute up to 3-4 times the number of UV photons (Harikane et al. 2022a ), boosting nebular emission in the rest-frame optical, which can bias stellar mass and SFR estimates.

        <p>We do not take account of the effect on our predictions of surv e ys taken from multiple areas of the sky. Behroozi &amp; Silk ( 2018 ) argue that such a surv e y approach increases the chance that a single surv e y will contain an outlier. Ho we ver, we note that the effect of observational errors leading to Eddington and Malmquist bias has a much larger effect on the predicted probabilities. Including this cosmic v ariance ef fect within the EVS frame work is left for future work.We do not take account of the effect on our predictions of surv e ys taken from multiple areas of the sky.

        <p>With upcoming wide field surv e ys a number of galaxies will be detected that may potentially be in tension with predictions from CDM, or require extreme conversion rates of baryons into stars. We hope the predictions presented here, and the publicly accessible code (github.com/christopherlo v ell/evstats), will present a means of producing confidence intervals for any given survey, and allow observers to quickly e v aluate the probability that a given source is in tension with a given cosmology.With upcoming wide field surv e ys a number of galaxies will be detected that may potentially be in tension with predictions from CDM, or require extreme conversion rates of baryons into stars.
