        <p>We critically reassess the theoretical uncertainties in the Standard Model calculation of the B → K * + -observables, focusing on the low q 2 region. We point out that even optimized observables are affected by sizable uncertainties, since hadronic contributions generated by current-current operators with charm are difficult to estimate, especially for q 2 ∼ 4m 2 c 6.8 GeV 2 . We perform a detailed numerical analysis and present both predictions and results from the fit obtained using most recent data. We find that non-factorizable power corrections of the expected order of magnitude are sufficient to give a good description of current experimental data within the Standard Model. We discuss in detail the q 2 dependence of the corrections and their possible interpretation as shifts of the Standard Model Wilson coefficients.We critically reassess the theoretical uncertainties in the Standard Model calculation of the B → K * + -observables, focusing on the low q 2 region.

        <p>Flavour-Changing Neutral Current (FCNC) processes are very sensitive probes of New Physics (NP). Within the Standard Model (SM) they can only arise at the loop level, and they are further suppressed by the GIM cancellation mechanism, so that even very heavy new particles can give rise to sizable contributions, especially if they carry new sources of flavour violation. In particular, the semileptonic decays B → K * + -have been advocated to be among the cleanest FCNC processes [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. Indeed, the dilepton invariant mass spectrum is accessible over the full kinematic range allowing to cut the theoretically challenging resonance-dominated regions. The description of the remaining part of the spectrum is simplified using the heavy quark expansion at low dilepton invariant mass q 2 [11,12], while an Operator Product Expansion (OPE) can be used at large q 2 [13][14][15][16]. In particular, heavy quark symmetry allows to reduce the number of independent form factors [17][18][19], while non-factorizable corrections are power suppressed. 1 Experimentally, the full angular analysis can be performed allowing for the extraction of twelve angular coefficients (plus twelve more for the CP-conjugate decay) in several q 2 bins. 2 From these coefficients, exploiting the symmetries of the infinite mass limit, one can define "optimized" observables in which the soft form factors cancel out, drastically reducing the theoretical uncertainties [22][23][24]. For these observables, very precise predictions can be found in the literature [25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39]. Some deviation from these predictions has been observed in recent LHCb data [40][41][42][43].

(2.4) clearly factorizes into the product of hadronic form factors and leptonic tensors at all orders in strong interactions. On the other hand, the matrix elements of H had eff in eq. (2.2) factorize only in the infinite m b limit below the charm threshold [11,12,20]. Moreover, in this regime, heavy quark symmetry reduces the number of independent form factors from seven to two soft form factors [17][18][19]. Therefore, in this limit, the amplitudes have simpler expressions so that optimized observables dominated by short distance physics can be defined [22][23][24]. The main issue however is how important departures from the infinite mass limit are, in particular when q 2 is close to 4m 2 c . Concerning factorized amplitudes, these can be described using the full set of form factors, which have been estimated using QCD sum rules at low q 2 [9, [51][52][53][54]. In particular we use the very recent results of ref. [54] with the full correlation matrix. While the form factor calculation is a difficult one, we think that QCD sum rules provide a reasonable estimate of low q 2 values and uncertainties, compatible with the lattice estimate at high q 2 [55]. Using full QCD form factors reintroduces some hadronic uncertainties into optimized observables which have been estimated in refs. [25-30, 34, 35, 48, 49]. In this respect, it has been suggested in ref. [35] that including some power-suppressed terms in the definition of the soft functions could reduce the uncertainty on some optimized observables. Since observables cannot depend on arbitrary scheme definitions, their deviation from the infinite mass limit cannot be reduced in this way.where λ i ≡ V ib V * is with i = u, c, t.

        <p>The main point of our paper concerns the non-factorizable contribution present in the matrix element of the Hamiltonian in equation (2.2) involving a cc loop. In the infinite mass limit, this term can be computed using QCD factorization including O(α s ) corrections [12,56]. Beyond the leading power, the contribution of Q c 1,2 to the B → K * +amplitude at q 2 ∼ 1 GeV 2 , as well as the contribution to the B → K * γ amplitude, has been estimated using light-cone sum rules in the single soft-gluon approximation [47]. This approximation worsens as q 2 increases and breaks down at q 2 ∼ 4m 2 c , as each additional soft gluon exchange is suppressed by a factor 1/(q 2 -4m 2 c ). In ref. [47] the authors proposed JHEP06(2016)116 also a phenomenological model interpolating their result at q 2 ∼ 1 GeV 2 with a description of the resonant region based on dispersion relations. While this model is reasonable, clearly there are large uncertainties in the transition region from q 2 ∼ 4 GeV 2 to m 2 J/ψ . Therefore, we consider the result of ref. [47] at q 2 1 GeV 2 as an estimate of the charm loop effect, but allow for larger effects as q 2 grows and reaches values of O(4m 2 c ). While Q c 1,2 are expected to dominate the K * γ * |H had eff | B matrix element, the effect of all operators in the hadronic Hamiltonian can be reabsorbed in the following parameterization, generalizing the one in ref.

We notice here the crucial point regarding NP searches in these processes: one cannot use data to disentangle long-distance contributions such as h (0,1) λ from possible NP ones, except, of course, for NP-induced CP-violating effects and/or NP contributions to operators other than C 7,9 . Thus, in the absence of a more accurate theoretical estimate of h λ (q 2 ) over the full kinematic range it is hardly possible to establish the presence of NP in C 7,9 , unless its contribution is much larger than hadronic uncertainties. In this work we show that hadronic contributions are sufficient to reproduce the present data once all the uncertainties are properly taken into account. We conclude that, given the present hadronic uncertainties, the NP sensitivity of these decays is washed out. In order to recover it, a substantial reduction of these uncertainties is needed.

        <p>The reader may wonder how the results presented so far depend on our assumptions on the size and shape of nonfactorizable power corrections. To elucidate this interesting point, we performed a number of tests and cross-checks. Let us summarize our findings here and relegate detailed numerical results to appendix E. If we do not use the numerical information from ref. [47], we obtain (as expected) an even better fit of experimental data (see tables 7 and 10, and figure 5) with a completely reasonable posterior for the power corrections, reported in table 5 and in figure 4. It is evident that the SM calculation supplemented with purely data-driven nonfactorizable power corrections of the expected order of magnitude is fully compatible with the data.

[47] at q 2 ≤ 1 GeV 2 yields IC ∼ 78; doing the same but dropping the h (2) λ terms gives IC ∼ 81, while using the model of ref. [47] over the full q 2 range yields IC ∼ 111. This confirms that the phenomenological model proposed in ref. [47] does not give a satisfactory description of experimental data, while the Standard Model supplemented with the hadronic corrections in eq. (2.6) provides a much better fit, even when the results of ref. [47] at q 2 ≤ 1 GeV 2 are used. In this case, a nonvanishing q 4 term is preferred.</p>

We define φ as the angle between the normals to the planes defined by K -π + and + -in the B meson rest frame. The angle θ is the angle between the direction of flight of the B and the -in the dilepton rest frame, and θ K is the angle between the direction of motion of the B and the K in the dimeson rest frame (note that θ and θ K are defined in the interval [0, π) ). Squaring the amplitude and summing over lepton spins allow us to write the fully differential decay rate as:where K = K0 or K -and π = π + or π 0 it is important to define the kinematic variables used since different conventions can be found in the literature.

        <p>From the full angular distribution one can define angular observables in multiple ways. Two different prescriptions have been advocated in the past [10,27]. While both sets of definitions are equivalent in their physics content, the two different sets have been used for experimental analyses [40-43, 59, 60]. These two definitions can be easily related to each other. Since we shall present our results cast into both sets it is best to define both here.
