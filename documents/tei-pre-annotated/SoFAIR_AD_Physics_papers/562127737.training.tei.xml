        <p>We include a fully coupled treatment of metal and dust enrichment into the DELPHI semi-analytic model of galaxy formation to explain the dust content of 13 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) detected by the Atacama Large millimetre Array (ALMA) REBELS Large Program at z 7. We find that the galaxy dust mass, M d , is regulated by the combination of Type II supernova dust production, astration, shock destruction, and ejection in outflo ws; grain gro wth (with a standard time-scale τ 0 = 30 Myr) plays a negligible role. The model predicts a dust-to-stellar mass ratio of ∼ 0 . 07 -0 . 1 per cent and a UV-to-total star formation rate relation such that log( ψ UV ) = -0.05 [log( ψ)] 2 + 0.86 log( ψ) -0.05 (implying that 55-80 per cent of the star formation is obscured) for REBELS galaxies with stellar mass M * = 10 9 -10 10 M . This relation reconciles the intrinsic UV luminosity of LBGs with their observed luminosity function at z = 7. Ho we ver, 2 out of the 13 systems show dust-to-stellar mass ratios ( ∼ 0 . 94 -1 . 1 per cent ) that are up to 18 times larger than expected from the fiducial relation. Due to the physical coupling between dust and metal enrichment, even decreasing τ 0 to very lo w v alues (0.3 Myr) only increases the dust-to-stellar mass ratio by a factor of ∼2. Given that grain growth is not a viable explanation for such high observed ratios of the dust-to-stellar mass, we propose alternative solutions.We include a fully coupled treatment of metal and dust enrichment into the DELPHI semi-analytic model of galaxy formation to explain the dust content of 13 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) detected by the Atacama Large millimetre Array (ALMA) REBELS Large Program at z 7.

        <p>MNRAS 512, 989-1002 (2022) A key issue in determining the dust masses of early galaxies is that the observed FIR continuum emission is characterized by key two quantities -the dust temperature ( T d ) and the dust mass ( M d ). Unless multiband dust measurements are available (see e.g. Faisst et al. 2020 ;Bakx et al. 2021 ), these two quantities are degenerate, requiring an assumption on the dust temperature in order to infer the associated dust mass. This has led to two classes of explanations for the exceedingly high dust-to-stellar mass ratios seen for z 7 galaxies: the first focuses on invoking extremely fast grain growth in the ISM (e.g. Mancini et al. 2015 ;Michałowski 2015 ). The second is that the (luminosity-weighted) dust temperatures are, in fact, significantly higher -up to ≈90 K (Behrens et al. 2018 ;Sommovigo et al. 2020 ) -than the usually assumed values of ∼35-40 K (see also Shen et al. 2021 ;Vijayan et al. 2021 ). Given that the FIR luminosity scales as L FIR ∝ M d T 6 d , this reduces the inferred dust mass by 2.1-2.5 orders of magnitude, thus removing the need to invoke extreme grain growth rates that appear to be problematic at high redshifts (Ferrara 2016 ).MNRAS 512, 989-1002 (2022) A key issue in determining the dust masses of early galaxies is that the observed FIR continuum emission is characterized by key two quantities -the dust temperature ( T d ) and the dust mass ( M d ).

        <p>In this work, our goal is to (i) study the key processes determining the dust content of high-redshift ( z 7) LBGs; and (ii) explore the impact of dif ferent ISM grain-gro wth time-scales on the dust masses and UV-observability of such galaxies. To this end, we augment our DELPHI 1 semi-analytic model with a detailed treatment of chemical and dust enrichment in the ISM of LBGs. Although similar in spirit to the semi-analytic models noted abo v e (e.g. Popping et al. 2017 ;Vijayan et al. 2019 ;Triani et al. 2020 ), the key strengths of this work lie in the fact that (i) it uses a minimal number (two) of mass-and redshift-independent free parameters to model the key physics of early galaxies; and (ii) contrary to the other models that have been calibrated against low-redshift ( z ∼ 0-3) data, our model has been calibrated against all available data sets for z 5 galaxies including the evolving UV LF and SMF. Once calibrated against these, our model also reproduces the observed redshift evolution of the SFR density and stellar mass density, to note a few; and (iii) this is the only semi-analytic model that includes the latest state-of-the-art yields from Type Ia SN (SN Ia), Type II SN (SN II), and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars from Kobayashi, Karakas &amp; Lugaro ( 2020 ) so far. This yield set can reproduce the observations not only for oxygen but also for most of all stable elements (up to uranium) self-consistently.In this work, our goal is to (i) study the key processes determining the dust content of high-redshift ( z 7) LBGs; and (ii) explore the impact of dif ferent ISM grain-gro wth time-scales on the dust masses and UV-observability of such galaxies.

        <p>We start by briefly describing the DELPHI model and interested readers are referred to Dayal et al. ( 2014 ) for complete details. DELPHI uses a binary merger tree approach to jointly track the build-up of dark matter haloes and their baryonic components (both gas and stellar mass). We start by building merger trees for 600 galaxies at z = 4.5, uniformly distributed in the halo mass range of log ( M h / M ) = 8 -14, up to z = 40 in equal time-steps of t = 30 Myr. This value is chosen so that all SN II from a given single stellar population explode within the same time-step (SN II progenitors have lifetimes of ࣠ 28 Myr; Padovani &amp; Matteucci 1993 ). Each z = 4.5 halo is assigned a co-moving number density by matching the d n /d M h value of the z = 4.5 Sheth-Tormen halo mass function (HMF; Sheth &amp; Tormen 1999 ) and this number density is propagated throughout the merger tree of that halo. Thus, the resulting HMFs comply with the Sheth-Tormen one at all z.We start by briefly describing the DELPHI model and interested readers are referred to Dayal et al. ( 2014 ) for complete details.

Associated REBELS papers use a conversion between the UV luminosity and the SFR such that L 1500 = ψκ -1 . While the REBELS collaboration uses a value of κ = 7.1 × 10 -29 ( M yr -1 erg -1 s Hz ) based on a Chabrier IMF (0 . 1 -300M ), the paper inferring the UV SFR values (Ferrara et al. 2022 ) uses a value of κ = 4.45 × 10 -29 based on a Salpeter IMF (1 -100M ). Averaged over REBELS mass galaxies ( M * ∼ 10 9 -10 10 M ), we find a value of κ = 8.9 × 10 -29 based on our Salpeter IMF (0 . 1 -100 M ).

        <p>We start by clarifying the relative role of the different processes discussed in equation ( 4) in shaping the dust content of early galaxies. To do this, we show the redshift evolution of the rate associated with each dust process, av eraged o v er 'REBELS mass' galaxies with M * ∼ 10 9 -10 10 M at z 7, in Fig. 1 . In the fiducial scenario ( τ 0 = 30 Myr, left-hand panel), such galaxies have a dust mass of M d ∼ 10 6 . 6 M by z ∼ 7 with dust production dominating the dust mass assembly at all redshifts. Given their dependence on D, the sum of the astration and destruction rates increase with M d (and hence, redshift) from being ≈ 26 per cent of the production rate at z ∼ 12 to ≈ 40 per cent by z ∼ 7. While the ejection rate also increases with time (given it is also ∝ D), its slope becomes shallower with decreasing redshift. This is because as haloes grow in mass, the rate of gas and dust ejection decreases. Indeed, the ejection rate decreases from being about ≈ 67 per cent of the production rate at z ∼ 12 to ≈ 44 per cent by z ∼ 7. Finally, the ISM grain growth rate increases with metallicity, from about 1 . 4 per cent of the production rate at z ∼ 12 to 8 per cent by z ∼ 7. As seen, the total rate of dust growth shows a sharp decline at z 12 where the production rate is essentially balanced by the rates of dust astration, destruction, and ejection. By z ∼ 7, astration, destruction and ejection add up to about 84 per cent of the production rate, with grain growth playing a sub-dominant role. In this fiducial case, the redshift-evolution of the total dust mass for M * ∼ 10 9 -10 10 M galaxies follows a roughly linear relation such that log M d = -0 . 33 z + 8 . 9 .We start by clarifying the relative role of the different processes discussed in equation ( 4) in shaping the dust content of early galaxies.

Indeed, the upper limit is provided by the 'maximal dust mass' model wherein the dust masses are higher by about 0.8 dex for M * ∼ 10 9 -10 10 M galaxies as compared to the fiducial modelthis model provides an upper limit to the dust-to-stellar mass ratio of about 0 . 63 per cent . It must be cautioned that although they cannot be excluded, 7 growth time-scales of the order of 0.3 Myr seem unlikely, if not unphysical. We end by noting that irrespective of the slope and normalization, all the theoretical models studied here predict the dust mass to scale roughly linearly with the stellar mass.</p>
        <p>We now discuss two interesting trends in terms of the data shown in Fig. 2 .

        <p>from REBELS (Bouwens et al. 2022 ) 8 We then calculate the minimum dust mass that would be detectable by the REBELS program given its non-detection dust continuum flux limit of about 66.49 μJy. We find this minimum dust mass to have a value of about 10 7 . 7 (10 6 . 6 )M assuming a dust temperature of 30 K (80 K). This naturally biases our observations to only detecting galaxies with higher dust masses, especially for M * 10 9 . 5 (10 8 . 8 )M systems as per the fiducial ( maximal dust model, even assuming dust temperatures as high as 80 K. The flatness of this relation can therefore be attributed to an observational bias introduced by the continuum detection limit of the REBELS program. Secondly, and more crucially, within error bars the bulk of the REBELS observations are consistent with our fiducial model as seen from this figure. Ho we ver, two of the lowest mass galaxies (REBELS-19 and 39), with 8 . 7 &lt; log ( M * / M ) &lt; 9, are clear outliers. These show dust masses and dust-to-stellar mass ratios ( ∼ 0 . 94 -1 . 1 per cent ) that are up to 18 × higher for a given stellar mass as compared to the fiducial model (see also Table 2 ); REBELS-14 is the third of the lowest-mass galaxies (reference stellar mass of 10 8 . 73 M ) that is only consistent with the fiducial model if its stellar mass lies at the observationally inferred upper limit of M * ∼ 10 9 . 7 M . Matching REBELS-19 and 39 within error bars requires scenarios that lie between the 'no dust ejection' and 'maximal dust mass' models; the lowest-mass galaxy (REBELS-39) has a dust mass that lies between the 'production only' and 'maximal dust mass' models, even if its stellar mass is assumed to be at the upper limit predicted by observations; the abo v e results remain qualitatively unchanged even if the higher stellar masses inferred by Topping et al. (in preparation) are used. Indeed, even ignoring any dust loss in astration, destruction, and ejection, explaining the dust masses of these systems would require each SN II to produce ∼ 1 . 25 -1 . 5M of dust (after SN shock processing; assuming a Salpeter 0 . 1 -100 M IMF) that is higher than any observational estimate so far; using the stellar masses from Topping et al. (in preparation) would require each SN II to produce lower dust masses of ∼ 0 . 57 -0 . 74M , bringing them into agreement with observed SN dust yields (ranging within 0 . 03 -1 . 1M ). Finally, we note that within error bars, the 'maximal dust mass' model also encompasses the dust masses inferred for A1689 -zD1 (Watson et al. 2015 ;Bakx et al. 2021 ), B14 -65666 (Hashimoto et al. 2019 ), and SPT0311-58 (Reuter et al. 2020 ).from REBELS (Bouwens et al. 2022 ) 8 We then calculate the minimum dust mass that would be detectable by the REBELS program given its non-detection dust continuum flux limit of about 66.49 μJy. We find this minimum dust mass to have a value of about 10 7 . 7 (10 6 . 6 )M assuming a dust temperature of 30 K (80 K).

        <p>We can also compute an upper limit to the dust mass from both production and grain growth for a galaxy of M * ∼ 10 9 M : assuming each SN II to produce 1M of dust would yield ∼ 10 6 . 9 M of dust using our chosen IMF. Further assuming all the gas-phase metals ( M Z ∼ 10 6 . 4 M ) to have condensed into dust (i.e. resulting in a M Z = 0) would yield a total dust mass of M d ∼ 10 7 M . This yields a dust-to-stellar mass ratio of 1 per cent , assuming all the metals to have condensed into dust that is still below the inferred values MNRAS 512, 989-1002 (2022) for some of the observed sources (namely REBELS-19 and 39) and very close to the values inferred for A1689 -zD1 and B14 -65666.

Indeed, employing non-parametric SFHs, Topping et al. (in preparation) find the stellar masses of the lowest-mass galaxies ( M * 10 9 . 2 M ) to be higher by a factor of 3-10.

        <p>We then show the dust-to-gas-ratio ( D) as a function of the stellar mass in (the left-hand panel of) Fig. 3 . As expected, this value is the highest for the production only model with D ∼ 15 per cent for lo w-mass ( M * ∼ 10 7 . 2 M ) galaxies, gi ven their lo w gas contents. For M * 10 9 M galaxies that are massive enough to retain most of their gas mass, the stellar (and dust) mass ef fecti vely scale with the gas mass resulting in D saturating at ∼ 0 . 27 per cent . Including astration and destruction leads to a decrease in the dust-to-gas ratio by about 0.3 dex at M * 10 8 . 5 M resulting in D ∼ 0 . 14 per cent . Preferentially decreasing the dust and gas mass contents of low-mass ( M * 10 7 . 5 M ) galaxies, including ejection completely changes the mass dependence of D by decreasing it by about 2.5 orders of magnitude at this low-mass end. At the high-mass ( M * 10 9 M ) end, ejection only decreases the amplitude of the dust-to-gas ratio by about 0.15 dex resulting in D ∼ 0 . 1 per cent . Including grain growth on a time-scale of τ 0 = 30Myr ( fiducial model) has no appreciable impact on this relation. Similarly, including grain growth on a τ 0 = 0.3-Myr time-scale leads to only a small increase in D by about 0.3 dex compared to the fiducial model -in this case, the value of D increases with stellar mass, reaching D ∼ 0 . 2 per cent for M * ∼ 10 9 -10 10 M galaxies. Ho we ver, we reiterate that e ven in this case, the 'production only' model provides the upper limit to the dust-to-gas ratio. As shown in the same panel, in the fiducial model the metallicity for these galaxies increases from about 12 to 26 per cent of the solar value as the stellar mass increases from 10 7.5 to 10 11 . 5 M . As expected, a larger amount of metals saturate into dust assuming τ 0 = 0.3Myr. This naturally results in a decrease in the metallicity values for all masses: in this case, the metallicity increases from 9 to 18 per cent for M * ∼ 10 7 . 5 -10 11 . 5 M galaxies.

        <p>This linear relation between the dust-to-gas ratio and the gas-phase metallicity is in accordance with a number of previous observational and theoretical results (e.g. Draine &amp; Li 2007 ;Leroy et al. 2011 ;R émy-Ruyer et al. 2013 ;Hou et al. 2019 ;Li et al. 2019 ) We then study the dust-to-metal ratio as a function of stellar mass (right-hand panel of Fig. 3 ). At z ∼ 7, the dust-to-metal ratio has a constant value ( ∼ 37 per cent ) in the production only scenario. Including astration and destruction naturally decreases this value, to M d /M Z ∼ 26 per cent . Further including the process of ejection results an increase (of about 0.1 dex) in the dustto-metal ratio for M * 10 8 M haloes whilst leaving the value largely unchanged at larger masses. This increase occurs because assuming perfect mixing (of metals and dust with gas) results in a larger amount of metals being ejected as compared to dust. Whilst including dust growth on a τ 0 = 30-Myr time-scale hardly affects this ratio for low-mass galaxies ( M * 10 7 . 6 M ), given their low metallicities, the dust-to-metal ratio increases with stellar mass for more massive haloes; e.g. for M * ∼ 10 10 M galaxies, the value of M d /M Z ∼ 34 per cent . Finally, including grain growth on a τ 0 = 0.3-Myr time-scale leads to a steeper increase in the M d / M Z value -for REBELS-type galaxies ( M * ∼ 10 9 -10 10 M ), M d / M Z ∼ 1 is a factor of 2.7 higher in this model compared to the fiducial model.This linear relation between the dust-to-gas ratio and the gas-phase metallicity is in accordance with a number of previous observational and theoretical results (e.g. Draine &amp; Li 2007 ;Leroy et al. 2011 ;R émy-Ruyer et al. 2013 ;Hou et al. 2019 ;Li et al. 2019 ) We then study the dust-to-metal ratio as a function of stellar mass (right-hand panel of Fig. 3 ).

These galaxies are more dust attenuated as compared to our fiducial model predictions, which is in accord with the (up to 18 times) higher dust masses shown by some of the REBELS galaxies (specially REBELS-19) when compared to the fiducial model as detailed in Section 3 .</p>
        <p>Compared to the fiducial model, the slightly higher dust masses (by a factor of ∼2) in the model with τ 0 = 0.3 Myr result in a corresponding decrease in the UV SFR (that range within 8 -30 M yr -1 ). The results for this model therefore lie between the fiducial and the 'production only' models. Finally, the 'maximal dust mass' model provides a lower limit to the ψ UV for a given value of the total SFR. For REBELS galaxies, this model predicts ψ UV values ∼ 5 -13 M yr -1 that are a factor of 2-4 lower than those predicted by the fiducial model. We reiterate that with its extremely high extinction of UV light, the 'maximal dust mass' model is incompatible with the observed z ∼ 7 UV LF.Compared to the fiducial model, the slightly higher dust masses (by a factor of ∼2) in the model with τ 0 = 0.3 Myr result in a corresponding decrease in the UV SFR (that range within 8 -30 M yr -1 ).

        <p>We now discuss the trend of f c as a function of the total SFR and the stellar mass, as shown in Fig. 6 . We remind the reader that we have defined f c = ψ UV / ψ. Starting with the 'production only' model, f c decreases by about an order of magnitude (from ∼0.75 to 0.075) as the total SFR increases from ψ ∼ 0.3 to 630 M yr -1 reflecting the increasing impact of dust attenuation in increasingly massive systems. Further, ψ UV &gt; 0.5 only for galaxies with ψ 2 . 4 M yr -1 i.e. galaxies with higher total SFRs will be increasingly suppressed in terms of their UV luminosity. The value of f c naturally increases when the processes of dust astration, destruction, and ejection are added. Including these effects, the UV SFR dominates in galaxies with SFRs as high as ψ ∼ 35 M yr -1 . These results change only slightly for the fiducial model where f c ∼ 0.5 for a slightly smaller value of ψ ∼ 25 M yr -1 . The model with grain growth on a 0.3-Myr time-scale yields the steepest decrease of f c with ψ as a result of the increase in dust mass in such massive systems. Finally, the 'maximal dust mass' model yields the lower limit to the unobscured SFR: In this model, ψ UV ∼ 0.5, i.e. the UV SFR is obscured, for a total SFR value as low as 0 . 6 M yr -1 We also see that the trend of f c shallows with increasing halo mass for all models -this is driven by the fact that the virial radius increases faster than the dust mass. For REBELS galaxies, f c only decreases by a factor of 2.25 from ∼ 45 to ∼ 20 per cent as ψ increases by about an order of magnitude from ∼40 to ∼ 300M yr -1 , as seen in Fig. 6 . The fiducial model therefore predicts that 55 per cent (80 per cent ) of the SFR in the UV is obscured for galaxies with ψ ∼ 40 (300)M yr -1 , which has enormous implications for the SFRD at such high-z. This is in accordance with the results of Ferrara et al. ( 2022 ) who have independently derived attenuation values ranging between 28 and 91 per cent for the same galaxies based on their UV spectral slopes.We now discuss the trend of f c as a function of the total SFR and the stellar mass, as shown in Fig. 6 .

        <p>This tension can be resolved by four different possibilities: (i) such low-mass, highly dusty galaxies are outliers that are not representative of the 'average' LBG population making up the UV LF; (ii) not all of the dust mass observed contributes to UV attenuation either because dust and star forming regions are spatially se gre gated or a large fraction of dust is diffused into the ISM with only a small fraction contributing to attenuating UV light; (iii) the dust masses for these low-mass systems are o v erestimated due to an MNRAS 512, 989-1002 (2022) underestimation in the dust temperature; and (iv) the stellar masses have been underestimated, especially for the lowest mass systems observed by REBELS. Explanation (ii) is particularly rele v ant for REBELS-39 that shows a UV-to-total SFR relation in agreement with the fiducial model whilst having a dust mass that lies abo v e this relation. REBELS-25 is an outlier that shows a larger attenuation of its UV SFR despite its dust mass being in perfect agreement with the fiducial relation. This might hint at dust being pr efer entially clumped around sites of young star formation.This tension can be resolved by four different possibilities: (i) such low-mass, highly dusty galaxies are outliers that are not representative of the 'average' LBG population making up the UV LF; (ii) not all of the dust mass observed contributes to UV attenuation either because dust and star forming regions are spatially se gre gated or a large fraction of dust is diffused into the ISM with only a small fraction contributing to attenuating UV light; (iii) the dust masses for these low-mass systems are o v erestimated due to an MNRAS 512, 989-1002 (2022) underestimation in the dust temperature; and (iv) the stellar masses have been underestimated, especially for the lowest mass systems observed by REBELS.

        <p>Finally, we end with a few caveats of the model. First, we have assumed gas, metals and dust to be perfectly mixed in the ISM. Along the same lines, secondly, we have assumed a dust radius that is equal to the gas radius, and a homogeneous slab-like dust distribution within this. In principle, one might expect dust to be more concentrated in newly star-forming regions and more dispersed into the ISM for older populations. Thirdly, we have ignored AGB contribution to the dust values inferred. However, as noted, this is expected to affect the inferred dust masses only slightly, i.e. at the ∼ 10 per cent lev el. F ourthly, we hav e ne glected local o v erdensities of cold gas that might increase the ISM grain growth rate. Finally, we assume smoothly-accreted gas to be devoid of both metals and dust. This might be an underestimation in the case of 'galactic fountains', i.e. when a part of the metal/dust-enriched gas ejected in at an earlier time is re-accreted on to the galaxy at a later stage. This is an effect that is already being included into our semi-numerical grid-based ASTRAEUS (Hutter et al. 2021 ) framework. Over the next years, a growing amount of ALMA data will be crucial in shedding light on a number of these outstanding issues. This includes properly sampled dust SEDs to address the dust temperature and the impact of the cosmic microwave background, matched-resolution ALMA/ JWST ( James Webb Space Telescope ) imaging to directly address the patchy obscuration issue, adding more 'direct' ISM tracers than [C II ] and higher spatial resolution observations to understand the UV and dust distributions (planned as part of the

        <p>In addition to being a key output of our model, the dust-to-stellar mass relation is one of the key observables for the REBELS program. We now compare our results to those from a number of semi-analytic models including the Santa Cruz model (Popping et al. 2017 ), L-GALAXIES (Vijayan et al. 2019 ), and DUSTY SAGE (Triani et al. 2020 ) that are able to simulate a statistically significant number of galaxies co v ering the REBELS stellar mass range ( M * ∼ 10 9 -10 10 M ). While all these models include (varying) prescriptions of the key physical process of gas cooling, star formation, SN feedback, chemical enrichment, and dust (formation, astration, destruction, ejection, accretion), we caution they have been base-lined against low-redshift ( z ∼ 0) data as compared to our model that has been base-lined against all available observables at z 5.In addition to being a key output of our model, the dust-to-stellar mass relation is one of the key observables for the REBELS program.

        <p>The Santa Cruz model (Popping et al. 2017 ) predicts the largest dust mass values for a given stellar mass. Finding a dust-to-stellar mass ratio that increases from ∼ 1 to 4 per cent as M * increases from 10 9 to 10 10 M , this model severely exceeds the average dustto-stellar mass ratio of about 0 . 28 per cent found both by our model and by the 
            <rs type="software">REBELS</rs> program for M * ∼ 10 9 . 5 -10 M galaxies. Indeed, this model sits at the upper limit for all the observed dust masses so far at z ∼ 7. As discussed in Section 4.1 , if such high dust masses were to be representative of the entire LBG population, the UV LF would be severely underpredicted due to dust attenuation unless this was compensated by intrinsically higher SFRs. Physically, these high dust masses are possibly driven by the high production rate density in this model as well as the fact that they allow smooth accretion of metal-and dust-rich gas. Interestingly, although the amplitude is higher, the slope from this model is in good agreement with ours.

        <p>P. Dayal et al. MNRAS 512, 989-1002(2022) Figure A1. The dust mass as a function of stellar mass at z ∼ 7. Solid blue points show data from REBELS (Bouwens et al. 2022 ) where the stellar and dust masses have been re-scaled to a Salpeter IMF with 0 . 1 -100 M . The other points show observational data for A1689 -zD1 (empty star) from Watson et al. ( 2015 ) and Bakx et al. ( 2021 ), for B14 -65666 (empty circle) from Hashimoto et al. ( 2019 ) and for SPT0311-58 (empty triangle) from Reuter et al. ( 2020 ). The solid black, dot-dashed grey and solid grey lines (along with 1 σ error bars) show results from this work for the fiducial model, a grain growth time-scale of 0.3 Myr and the 'maximal dust mass' model, respectively. These are compared to the results from three other semi-analytic models: The solid yellow line shows the fiducial model from Popping et al. ( 2017 ), the violet dashed and dot-dashed lines show the fiducial model and upper limits from Vijayan et al. ( 2019 ), and the red line shows the fiducial results from Triani et al. ( 2020 ).P.

        <p>Finally, the results of the DUSTY SAGE model (that also uses the Dwek grain growth model but an ISM grain growth time-scale of 0.4 Myr) lie very close to our model that includes all the key dust process and where ISM grain growth takes place on a 0.3-Myr timescale. This is quite heartening, given their very different prescriptions for star formation, SN feedback, and the fact that they too allow for accretion of metal-and gas-rich IGM gas (the 'galactic fountain' model). While this model provides the best fit as compared to the other two for observed M * 10 9 . 5 M galaxies, as in our model, it underpredicts the dust masses for lower mass systems.Finally, the results of the DUSTY SAGE model (that also uses the Dwek grain growth model but an ISM grain growth time-scale of 0.4 Myr) lie very close to our model that includes all the key dust process and where ISM grain growth takes place on a 0.3-Myr timescale.
