        <p>Soft matter exhibits a multitude of intrinsic physico-chemical attributes. Their mechanical properties are crucial characteristics to define their performance. In this context, the rigidity of these systems under exerted load forces is covered by the field of biomechanics. Moreover, cellular transduction processes which are involved in health and disease conditions are significantly affected by exogenous biomechanical actions. In this framework, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and optical tweezers (OT) can play an important role to determine the biomechanical parameters of the investigated systems at the single-molecule level. This review aims to fully comprehend the interplay between mechanical forces and soft matter systems. In particular, we outline the capabilities of AFM and OT compared to other classical bulk techniques to determine nanomechanical parameters such as Young's modulus. We also provide some recent examples of nanomechanical measurements performed using AFM and OT in hydrogels, biopolymers and cellular systems, among others. We expect the present manuscript will aid potential readers and stakeholders to fully understand the potential applications of AFM and OT to soft matter systems.Soft matter exhibits a multitude of intrinsic physico-chemical attributes.

        <p>The impact of exogenous mechanical actions on soft matter systems can have multiple implications, such as the favoring of self-assembly on materials that drive the growth of 2D-crystals [33]; the reduction of wettability on biopolymers, composites and blends by the shrinkage of the inner pore dimensions and morphology [34]; the stiffness increase of plant polymers [35]; or the improvement of the thermal stability [36], among others. This last observation is not unexpected since it has been reported that there is a temperature effect on the decrease of mechanical and tribological properties in polymers [37]. The attention to soft matter materials has grown interest due to their above-described potential performance and their applications. Soft matter materials are actually used and applied to different fields, such as robotics [38], flexible displays [39], tissue engineering [40], design of biosensing devices [41], drug delivery [42], packaging [43] or the optimization of antimicrobial surfaces [44], among many others. The main advantage of soft matter materials is the tunable response under external stimuli such as temperature [45], pH [46], light [47], ionic strength [48] or dynamical flows by microfluidic devices [49], among others. Moreover, working with soft matter systems is appealing since most of them increase the biocompatibility of the evolved material, which is fundamental for biomedical purposes [50]. In this context, many bulk techniques have been devoted to determining the mechanical properties of soft matter, such as multifrequency magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) [51], ultrasonic testing [52], tensile testing [53] and indentation at the microscale level [54]. The main drawbacks of the aforementioned methods are the lack of information of transient phenomena or singularities existing in the tested soft matter samples.

        <p>From its discovery in 1986 [55], AFM has addressed a multitude of physico-chemical properties of soft matter samples. AFM consists of a flexible cantilever ended by ultra-sharp tips that bends when senses external forces [56]. AFM hoards many operational modes to elicit the physico-chemical properties of the sample of interest. AFM imaging assesses the morphological changes that take place upon biomolecular ligand binding and catalysis [57][58][59]. AFM force spectroscopy (AFM-FS) deciphers the adhesion properties [60,61] and the dissociation energy landscapes can be obtained using stochastic dynamic simulations [62]. When low applied forces are acting, the unspecific tip-sample interactions become negligible, and AFM-FS converts to molecular recognition imaging (MRI) [63]. AFM-nanoscale infrared spectroscopy (AFM-nanoIR) covers the chemistry of the bonds involved in the scanned area [64]. Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) analyzes the magnetic response of soft matter samples [65], which could have implications in robots for manipulation and drug delivery [66] or hyperthermia treatments [67]. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (AFM-SECM) is used for electrical characterization [68], which is a crucial step to fabricate more efficient nano-transducers and lab-on-chip biosensor devices [69]. Finally, AFM nanoindentation measure the elastic deformation of the external sample surface when external load forces are exerted. AFM shows many advantages in comparison to other techniques such as the following: (I) The possibility of investigating samples in liquid environments, mimicking the inner cellular conditions allowing in vivo measurements. In this doing, we can use AFM to measure the mechanical properties of the soft matter as function of the pH or ionic strength of the liquid media [70]. (II) AFM measurements can be performed under suitable conditions to preserve the integrity of the investigated sample conversely to cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), where ultra-low temperatures are required [71]. AFM does not require staining the sample with contrast agents, in contrast to other techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or TEM, thus avoiding any artifacts and interferences with the investigated properties [72].From its discovery in 1986 [55], AFM has addressed a multitude of physico-chemical properties of soft matter samples.

        <p>OT are scientific instruments that use a highly focused laser beam to trap objects. Coated plastic beads with soft matter materials can be subjected to the underlying attractive or repulsive forces at the piconewton range [73]. OT can quantitatively evaluate the assembly of protein droplets and their characteristics that lead to the pathological solidification [74], biomolecular folding and unfolding events that undergo conformational changes to reach their biological functions [75], decode the molecular mechanisms related to DNA and RNA organization, translation, repair and replication processes [76], hydrodynamic forces involved in endocytosis processes of eukaryotic cells [77], cell migration probed in engineered environments [78] and mechanical response of soft matter systems [79]. Recently, the integration of OT, label-free microscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and advanced microfluidic systems has allowed the visualization of dynamic interactions in real time [80]. The continuous necessity to launch accurate measurements makes necessary the design of high-throughput modeling toolboxes of rotational torques in OT [81]. Other OT capability overhauls are based on strengthening optical traps with structured illumination, which makes them more sensitive to displacements and increases the resolution of microbead motions on inertial timescales [82].OT are scientific instruments that use a highly focused laser beam to trap objects.

The viscous energy dissipation can be estimated by sophisticated numerical algorithms [92]. Finally, Figure 1 summarizes the four classes of soft matter behaviors under external load forces being divided into elastic (Figure 1a), viscoelastic (Figure 1b), viscoplastic (Figure 1c) and viscous (Figure 1d), respectively. The responses to strain (ε) and ε-load time (t) reported in Figure 1 are characteristic for each behavior mentioned above and can be used to predict the category of unknown materials by their response to strains. In particular, elastic and viscous materials display a linear slope in stress-strain representations that refer to Young's modulus and viscosity parameters, respectively. On the other hand, viscoelastic and viscoplastic materials show stress-strain profiles in the form of hysteresis. Viscoelastic events occur when, after the stress is kept out, the strain drops to zero in a time-dependent fashion. Plasticity from viscoplastic phenomena takes place when the strain never comes back to zero after the external load is removed. Thus, the main difference observed between viscoelastic and viscoplastic behaviors is that in the first case the deformation underwent by the material is transitory, whereas in the second one the yield stress is permanent. Both stresses and strains are estimated by finite element method (FEM) software tools which consist of a converged solution for the nodal displacements of post-processing quantities.

        <p>Tensile testing is a destructive process that delivers information about the tensile and yield strengths and ductility of soft matter materials by measuring the force requested to stretch the material of interest until it reaches its rupture point. There are several approaches to establish the aforementioned material mechanical properties. The Hollomon equation correlates the true-strain-true-stress curves [108]. The Hollomon's equation shows some constraints [109], such as the impossibility to characterize the tested sample in the full strain-stress range due to the observance of distinct hardening stages. For this reason, alternative models have been hypothesized such as the Swift [110] and Voce [111] equations. The Swift equation is more appropriate to describe the stress-strain profiles in small strain regions, whereas the Voce expression is the most suitable to predict the stress-strain curves in large strain regions.

This phenomenon triggers stronger hydrodynamic interactions between the cantilever and the liquid molecules, rendering lower Q-factors of ~4-10 times lower compared with measurements conducted in air conditions. The model used can also depend on the cantilever spring constant value range. The model used for soft AFM cantilevers with spring constants k &lt; 1 nN/s is the thermal tuning [145]. On the other hand, stiff AFM cantilever spring constants k &gt; 1 N/m are calibrated by the Sader's method [146]. Nevertheless, the determination of accurate deflection sensitivity values is not as straightforward as it seems, rendering an estimated error of around 30%. This fact, based on the calculation of deflection sensitivity, is related to the cantilever spring constant, which in turn is established by the free-resonance cantilever thermal spectrum. To overcome this situation, a recent approach named standardized nanomechanical atomic force microscopy procedure (SNAP) [143] was developed. This approach consists of calculating a correction factor (ζ) for the deflection signal when the cantilever spring constant is more precisely calculated by using a vibrometer. SNAP was successfully employed to assess the elastic modulus of polyacrylamide gels, minimizing the aforementioned standard error from 30% down to 1%.

        <p>where k is the spring constant of the AFM cantilever, Z 2 is the mean square motion of the AFM cantilever, k B is the Boltzmann constant and T is the kelvin temperature. Thus, spring constant values are calculated through the mean square AFM cantilever displacement that can be pinpointed by integrating the power spectral density (PSD, Figure 3d). There exist many applicable theoretic models available in fitting the PSD response. Commonly, simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) and Lorentz fitting models are used for PSDs with low and large Q-factors, respectively. The Q factor of an AFM cantilever indicates its capacity to dissipate energy and thus the existing damping. AFM cantilevers with higher Q-factors allow to increase the force sensitivity. The recommendation is to employ SHO and Lorentz fitting models in liquid and air environments, respectively, because the damping of the AFM cantilever by the liquid molecules causes lower Q-factors on the PSD. This observation is based on the fact that the AFM cantilever motion drags the neighboring liquid molecules, thus leading to a strong increase in the cantilever effective mass by one magnitude order factor. This phenomenon triggers stronger hydrodynamic interactions between the cantilever and the liquid molecules, rendering lower Q-factors of ~4-10 times lower compared with measurements conducted in air conditions.

Thus, spring constant values are calculated through the mean square AFM cantilever displacement that can be pinpointed by integrating the power spectral density (PSD, Figure 3d). There exist many applicable theoretic models available in fitting the PSD response. Commonly, simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) and Lorentz fitting models are used for PSDs with low and large Q-factors, respectively. The Q factor of an AFM cantilever indicates its capacity to dissipate energy and thus the existing damping. AFM cantilevers with higher Q-factors allow to increase the force sensitivity. The recommendation is to employ SHO and Lorentz fitting models in liquid and air environments, respectively, because the damping of the AFM cantilever by the liquid molecules causes lower Q-factors on the PSD. This observation is based on the fact that the AFM cantilever motion drags the neighboring liquid molecules, thus leading to a strong increase in the cantilever effective mass by one magnitude order factor. This phenomenon triggers stronger hydrodynamic interactions between the cantilever and the liquid molecules, rendering lower Q-factors of ~4-10 times lower compared with measurements conducted in air conditions. The model used can also depend on the cantilever spring constant value range. The model used for soft AFM cantilevers with spring constants k &lt; 1 nN/s is the thermal tuning [145]. On the other hand, stiff AFM cantilever spring constants k &gt; 1 N/m are calibrated by the Sader's method [146].</p>

AFM is capable of recording force-distance curves (Figure 4) at local sample areas discriminating between different mechanical properties. During a single force-distance curve cycle, the AFM tip approaches the external sample surface until the contact between both bodies occurs (Figure 4a). At this point, the rigid AFM tip apex causes a deformation of the indented surface. Then, a different direction of movement takes place, and the tip moves away the sample. Adhesion forces between the tip and the sample emerged during the contact being broken at sudden retract point (Figure 4b). The tip will move up to the original position defined at the start of the cycle. The energy dissipation and sample stiffness can be estimated once the forcedistance curve is recorded. The area between the approach and retract curves determines the energy dissipation (Figure 4c), whereas the stiffness relies on the slope of the forcedistance curve (Figure 4d). The stiffness of the soft matter can be quantitatively converted to Young's modulus through the mechanic models described in Section 4, which are selected depending on the geometry of the AFM tip and the nature of the forces that dominate during the contact. For all the aforementioned reasons, the accurate characterization of the used AFM tip is crucial to precisely determine the Young's modulus of soft matter systems.Before starting experiments to address the nanomechanical properties of soft matter systems, it is requested to follow all the above-described steps to accurately calibrate the AFM tips and thus prevent the acquisition of misleading raw data.

        <p>The first idea that light could exert a force on matter dates back to the 17th century, when Johannes Kepler argued that the dust tail of comet is due to the radiation pressure exerted by the sun's rays on sublimated components of a comet. The radiation pressure is the mechanical pressure exerted upon any surface due to the momentum exchange between photons and matter. The momentum carried and exchanged by photons is so extremely small that radiation pressure and its application became very interesting only after the invention of the laser. In fact, it was the 1987 when Arthur Ashkin (Nobel Prize in Physics in 2018) developed optical tweezers (OT) thanks to his pioneering experiments on the interaction of laser light with microparticles [147][148][149]. Since their invention, OT have become a key tool for the contactless manipulation and characterization of a wide variety of objects, such as atoms [150], nanoscopic [151] and microscopic particles [151], as well as viruses, biomolecules, bacteria and cells [149,[152][153][154][155]. Optical tweezers consist of a tightly focused laser beam able to exert optical forces on micro and nano-objects as a consequence of the conservation of the linear momentum in the light-matter interaction [156]. Under proper experimental conditions (i.e., laser power, size of the particle and refractive indexes of both the medium and the particle), optical forces are able to confine a particle near the focal spot of a focused laser beam [156]. Figure 5a depicts the main components existing in OT setups. during a time interval Δ𝑡 gives rise to an optical force 𝐹 = Δ𝑃 ⃗ /Δ𝑡 according to the Newton's second law (Figure 5b).

Optical forces can be separated into two different components: gradient forces 𝐹 grad , proportional to the light intensity gradient in the focal region and scattering forces 𝐹 scat proportional to the light intensity (Figure 5b). Gradient forces pull the particle towards , acting on a spherical particle and a restoring optical force F x (black arrows). Whenever F ext,x displaces a trapped particle from x eq to a generic position x, an optical restoring force F x , having the same magnitudo of F ext,x but opposite direction, takes place acting like a Hookean spring.

        <p>A full understanding of optical forces requires the full electromagnetic theory describing the light-matter interaction based on the Maxwell's equations [157]. However, some simplifications and approximations, depending on the particle size, have been made to provide an easier understanding and physical insight of optical forces [151]. In particular, for particles larger than the wavelength of the trapping beam, we can use the Geometrical Optics (GO) approximation, where the incoming optical field, generated by the focused laser beam, can be considered as a collection of light rays carrying a portion of the total optical power and linear momentum (Figure 5b). When a ray impinges on a particle, it will be partly transmitted and partly reflected, according to the Snell's law [158]. If for simplicity we consider that the portion of ray reflected is very small and negligible, an incident ray ( → R inc ) impinging on a particle will be completely transmitted through the 5b). In the GO approximation, the optical force → F acting on a particle is the sum of all the momenta exchanged by all the rays impinging on the particle.A full understanding of optical forces requires the full electromagnetic theory describing the light-matter interaction based on the Maxwell's equations [157].

Gradient forces pull the particle towards the focal spot, while scattering forces, due to the radiation pressure, push the particle along the direction of the laser beam propagation [151].

        <p>This section sets forth relevant soft matter systems where their Young's modulus were assessed using AFM nanotechnology tools. Table 3 summarizes recent examples in this regard. It is remarkable the strong impact of the environmental conditions on Young's modulus as rooted in the next several examples. The first case is based on the almost 2-fold decrease of Young's modulus values found in Staphylococcus epidermis when the ionic strength increases (from deionized water to 100 mM CaCl 2 ) [162]. The same outcome was observed for Escherechia coli cells when the molarity of KNO 3 salt solution increases from 1 mM to 100 mM, leading a decrease of elastic modulus nearby of three times, from 950 kPa to 300 kPa, caused by the exo-osmotic water loss [163]. The fixation procedures employed can also impact on the gathered Young's module values. One illustrative example is the case of human cancer colon cells where Young's modulus varies from 0.4 kPa to 309.5 kPa (almost 10 times greater) when the tested cancer cell sections are obtained by frozen non-fixed protocols and embedded by paraffin, respectively [164]. Additionally, users need to pay attention to all the settings involved during data acquisition. Table 3 depicts those parameters such as the load force exerted to the AFM tip or the indentation depth [165] that affect the gathered Young's modulus values. The case of the load force is especially interesting since the geometry of the AFM tip is the main factor that can alter these exerted forces by several orders of magnitude. As mentioned above, sharp tips display load forces in the range of nN, whereas for AFM levers ended with microbeads, the load forces increase up to the µN scale. On the other hand, higher indentation depths render greater Young's modulus values. Based on the high sensitivity exhibited by AFM setups, it is mandatory to well define the experimental conditions before launching the data acquisition and to keep them systematically constant during the different tested soft matter samples of interest. Taking this point into consideration, AFM can unravel the Young's modulus of soft matter systems evaluating the changes on sample nature such as the prognosis of the status of the human skin [166] or the bone cells [167] in patients, environmental conditions in biopolymers and composites, such as the changes of R.H [168] and temperature [43], respectively, or the footprint of pH on hydrogels [167]. For all the above-described aspects, we can conclude that it is extremely important the good practices are followed by users in determining the elastic properties of soft samples. The knowledge provided in this section will be useful not only for beginners but also for advanced users to meet all required control settings during the nanomechanical AFM measurements and also to identify the potential shortcomings which can appear during data acquisition. In Figure 6, the range of elastic modulus values found by AFM for soft matter systems is reported. The observation of an enormous range of elastic properties is evidenced. Hydrogels and living cells exhibit the larger distribution of Young's modulus values (from ~2 kPa to ~900 MPa). This fact is based on the different polymerization degree and cellular maturation of different cell lines, respectively. The elastic modulus of tissues (from ~900 Pa to ~1200 MPa) strongly differs from biopolymers (from ~1 GPa to dozens of GPa), dendrimers (from ~0.1 GPa to ~1 GPa), blends (from ~1 GPa to ~10 GPa), foams (from ~1 GPa to ~10 GPa) and liquid crystals (from ~1 GPa to ~10 GPa). The larger elastic modulus suggests higher intramolecular cohesion between the neighboring atoms which conform the soft matter systems. These greater cohesive forces render more resistance of the tested materials under external load forces, and thus their mechanical performances are improved.This section sets forth relevant soft matter systems where their Young's modulus were assessed using AFM nanotechnology tools.

        <p>Calibrated OT can be also used to study the elasticity of soft matter system, ranging from synthetic polymers to cells and biological molecules, such as red blood cells and DNA. The elasticity of the DNA plays a crucial role in all its processes e.g., folding, recombination, replication and transcription, etc. Moreover, free molecules of DNA represent an excellent experimental model used to study and validate theoretical models of polymers [181]. A single DNA molecule, for small extension beyond its rest limit, can be approximated like an ideal entropic spring (a polymer chain subjected to thermal fluctuation), with a specific length, l 0 , indicating its maximum physically possible extension, a persistence length, l p , quantifying its bending stiffness and a stiffness, k 0 , when stretched slightly beyond l 0 [182]. These parameters, characterizing the flexibility and elasticity of a DNA molecule, can be obtained by stretching a single molecule with OT and fitting the force-extension curve with a theoretical model. Experimentally, one end of DNA can be attached to a fixed microscopic bead or anchored to a cover glass, while the other end is attached to an optically trapped bead, as shown in Figure 7c [179,180]. Pulling the trapped bead connected with one end of DNA with OT, we can stretch the polymer, measuring the corresponding stretching force.Calibrated OT can be also used to study the elasticity of soft matter system, ranging from synthetic polymers to cells and biological molecules, such as red blood cells and DNA.

        <p>For small stretching, when the end-to-end extension is shorter than l 0 , the force is small because only the bends of the polymer are removed. Here, the DNA behaves like an entropic spring well described by the worm-like chain (WLC) model, and its elasticity is represented mainly by l p [183][184][185]. When the end-to-end extension approaches l 0 , there are no more bends to be removed, the DNA shows an elastic stiffness k 0 and the force increases with the stretching of the polymers according to the WLC model, where k 0 and l p are proportional to each other. Unfortunately, the inextensible WLC model fails when these parameters are measured in presence of cations (i.e., as function of sodium ion Na + concentration). In particular, the force-extension curves measured do not follow the model predictions, and k 0 and l p are no longer proportional to each other. This discrepancy arises because the inextensible WLC model does not take into account electrostatic repulsion between the partially screened phosphates on the negatively charged backbone on DNA [186]. According to the experimental force-extension curves obtained by stretching a DNA molecule with OT, it was observed that a DNA molecule can be stretched easily (k 0 decreases) as the salt concentration is lowered, but its bending stiffness, l p , increases. This leads to new models for bending and stretching properties of DNA and for its structure during overstretching at not too low salt conditions [182,187]. Thanks to these new models, it was possible to calculate the DNA elasticity parameters for different buffer solutions (Table 4), increasing Na + ions concentrations (Table 5) and increasing the ionic strength of increasing NaCl concentrations (Table 6). The values reported in the tables were obtained by fitting the experimental force-extension curves with different theoretical models [181,182,186].

These greater cohesive forces render more resistance of the tested materials under external load forces, and thus their mechanical performances are improved.</p>
        <p>Calibrated OT can be also used to study the elasticity of soft matter system, ranging from synthetic polymers to cells and biological molecules, such as red blood cells and slightly beyond 𝑙 0 [182]. These parameters, characterizing the flexibility and elasticity of a DNA molecule, can be obtained by stretching a single molecule with OT and fitting the force-extension curve with a theoretical model. Experimentally, one end of DNA can be attached to a fixed microscopic bead or anchored to a cover glass, while the other end is attached to an optically trapped bead, as shown in Figure 7c [179,180]. Pulling the trapped bead connected with one end of DNA with OT, we can stretch the polymer, measuring the corresponding stretching force. are attached to two colloidal spherical particles; one is fixed by a micropipette tips (cyan truncated triangle) and the other one is confined within an optical potential (red curve).

Where 𝑥 1 and 𝑥 2 are the positions of the two ends of the DNA molecule, 𝑥 1 is fixed, while 𝑥 2 changes according to the position of the trapped particle. (b) When (𝑥 2 -𝑥 1 ) → 𝑙 0 , the DNA molecule shows an elastic stiffness, 𝑘 0 , and the stretching force increases with the stretching. In this case, the trapped bead is displaced by ∆𝑥 eq = (𝑥 -𝑥 eq ) from its equilibrium position. The position 𝑥 1 is experimentally set and fixed at the beginning of an experiment; 𝑥 2 can be easily calculated from the particle position 𝑥 knowing the size of the bead; 𝑥 eq and the stretching force can be obtained by OT calibration.

        <p>For small stretching, when the end-to-end extension is shorter than 𝑙 0 , the force is small because only the bends of the polymer are removed. Here, the DNA behaves like an entropic spring well described by the worm-like chain (WLC) model, and its elasticity is represented mainly by 𝑙 p [183][184][185]. When the end-to-end extension approaches 𝑙 0 , there are attached to two colloidal spherical particles; one is fixed by a micropipette tips (cyan truncated triangle) and the other one is confined within an optical potential (red curve).

The Young's modulus of λ-bacteriophage DNA was calculated for the high salt case reported in Table 6, with k D = 1400 pN, yielding a Young's modulus value of E = 450 MPa [186]. The elasticity characteristic of each living cell plays a dominant role in its biological functions. Often, variation of the characteristic elasticity of the cells can lead to human diseases, whose progresses and identification, in some cases, can be performed with OT [188,189]. Furthermore, studying the mechanical response of the cells using OT can be used to develop quantitative models for their mechanisms of deformation within the human body. A human red blood cell (RBC) has a biconcave shape and an averaged diameter of 8 µm, its lifetime is about 120 days, during which time it circulates through the human body almost half a million of times. The oxygenation of the body also depends on the elasticity of RBCs, which deform during the microcirculation of the blood to be able to go through capillaries as small as approximately 3 µm. The elasticity of RBCs and their adhesiveness with other cells can be altered by the malaria intra-cellular parasite, losing its ability to undergo large deformations [188,190]. Every year, 2-3 million of people die from malaria. Furthermore, the deformability of RBCs can also be altered by different types of diabetes such as diabetic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [189]. The elasticity and deformation of an RBC can be measured by OT, either with its extremities attached to two beads, similarly to the method shown for DNA in Figure 7a,b, or directly trapped without any beads, as in Figure 7c [188,189,191]. Direct trapping and stretching of the RBC is easier since there is no need of a microfluidic chamber and to attach the RBC to beads, and this tapping is still able to exert force in the order of pN [189,191]. The two extremities of an RBC can be directly trapped and stretched by a dual beam OT, keeping the position of a trap fixed and moving the other one after verifying that the optical power delivered is not altering the properties of the trapped RBC [189]. The deformability of an RBC can be quantified by the deformability index (DI), defined as: DI = final streched length of RBCinitial streched length of RBC initial streched length of RBC (24) The investigation of RBC deformability in T2DM with and without diabetic retinopathy (DR) indicated that size and reduced deformability of RBCs play a crucial role in microvascular complications (Table 7) [189]. The mechanical properties of the RBC were also studied with an optical stretcher, which is an OT-based setup, able to trap and stretch objects using optical forces. In particular, the value of the product of Young's modulus, E, and the membrane thickness, h, was found as Eh = 3.9 ± 1.4 • 10 -5 Nm -1 [192].For small stretching, when the end-to-end extension is shorter than 𝑙 0 , the force is small because only the bends of the polymer are removed.

        <p>Optical tweezers can also transfer angular momentum from a polarized laser beam to birefringent or chiral trapped particles inducing toques on them and causing them to rotate [156,[193][194][195][196]. Recently, an OT-based setup was used to measure the shear viscosity of the macropinosome of a living macrophage cell in vivo by transferring spin angular momentum to a vaterite birefringent micro-particle internalized by the cell, Figure 7d [194]. This transfer generates an optical torque defined by τ opt = ∆σP/ω, where P is the trapping power, ∆σ indicates the change in the degree of circular polarization and ω is the angular frequency of the trapping laser beam. The generated torque will induce continuous rotation of the vaterite particle. The torque exerted by the fluid on a rotating sphere is τ drag = 8πηa 3 Ω, where η is the shear viscosity of the fluid surrounding the sphere, a is the radius of the sphere and Ω is the angular rotation frequency of the sphere. The two drags can be equated, and the shear viscosity can be calculated as [197,198]:Optical tweezers can also transfer angular momentum from a polarized laser beam to birefringent or chiral trapped particles inducing toques on them and causing them to rotate [156,[193][194][195][196].

        <p>Equation ( 21) allows the calculation of the shear viscosity of a fluid by a direct measurement of P, ∆σ, a and Ω. In particular, the shear viscosity for a macropinosome lumen inside a living cell was calculated as η = 1.01 ± 0.16 mPa s. This value is similar to the measured shear viscosity η = 1.05 ± 0.02 mPa s of the L-15 culture medium used during the experiments. This similarity can be explained because a macropinosome mostly consist of internalized surround medium, in this case L-15 culture medium [197].Equation ( 21) allows the calculation of the shear viscosity of a fluid by a direct measurement of P, ∆σ, a and Ω.

        <p>On the other hand, OT can be also combined with other correlated techniques to unravel many properties of soft matter. The kinetics can be assessed by multicolor epiillumination fluorescence microscopy [213]. This multimodal microscopy can be successfully used in the study of single cell nanomechanics while imaging their response through fluorescent labeled protein force-transductors [214]. Fluorescence excitation lasers can be also coupled with OT, next to the fiber laser of the optical trap to render confocal fluorescence, and thus measuring the bind of single fluorophores [215]. Furthermore, OT can also be coupled with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy that allows the measurement of lateral movements of trapped organelle bodies located inside the living cells in real time [216]. The coupling of Raman spectroscopy with OT gives rise to the new technique of Raman tweezers (RT), which allows us to obtain the fingerprints of the single trapped objects without any shielding effects due to other particles or the substrate. This technique has been successfully employed to study the effect of thalassemia on hemoglobin deformability [217]. Moreover, RT was also used to trap and chemically analyze individual tire and road wear particles in liquid environments [218], detect microplastic polymers in seawater [219] and aid in the identification and subsequent classification of marine bacteria based on their cell phenotypes [220]. Recently, RT was also used to investigate single grains of cosmic dust [196]. Finally, force-induced mechanical balance data of soft matter obtained by OT can be compared by complementary techniques such as micropipette aspiration system with stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy [221]. Coupling AFM and OT with other setups displays many advantages in comparison with other techniques such as förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensors to screen mechanical parameters [222].
