        <p>Hard disk (HD) patterns are snapshots from isochoric Monte Carlo simulations of hard disks with radius R in a box of area A and with periodic boundary conditions. Important parameters are the number of particles N and the packing density φ = N πR 2 /A. A disordered starting configuration is rapidly compressed to the target density and then equilibrated. A short equilibration time over 10 4 Monte Carlo sweeps proved already sufficient to reach equilibrium.Hard disk (HD) patterns are snapshots from isochoric Monte Carlo simulations of hard disks with radius R in a box of area A and with periodic boundary conditions.

        <p>If we cannot achieve a target χ with a given N , then N is adjusted to the closest value that is compatible with that χ. We generally use N = 200 and vary 0.1 ≤ φ ≤ 0.75 and 0.1 ≤ χ ≤ 0.75. Example snapshots at various parameter values are shown in Fig. 1. However, in contrast to the rest of the paper we used N = 1000 in the snapshots to highlight the development of order with increasing positional correlation. The HD system crystallizes into a hexagonal lattice in the density range 0.70 &lt; φ &lt; 0.72. The SHU system orders over the broad density range 0.50 &lt; χ &lt; 0.70, gradually changing from hexagonal (six-fold) local order to four-fold local order with increasing density. Interestingly, the ordered phase of the SHU system appears to be the square lattice, albeit typically with defects. It is not clear whether the SHU system undergoes a first order phase transition.If we cannot achieve a target χ with a given N , then N is adjusted to the closest value that is compatible with that χ.

        <p>The gradual appearance of order can be analyzed in real space via the radial distribution function g(r) and in reciprocal space via the structure factor S(k). We show these functions in Fig. 2 for the patterns in Fig. 1. Notice that for better comparability at various parameter values we use a different unit of length than in Fig. 1.The gradual appearance of order can be analyzed in real space via the radial distribution function g(r) and in reciprocal space via the structure factor S(k).

        <p>Positional order gradually develops with φ and χ as visible by the increasing height of the peaks in g(r) and S(k). At φ, χ ≥ 0.70, additional peaks appear indicating the development of quasi-long-range order. While the second peaks of the fluid splits up in the HD system, indicating the formation of a hexagonal lattice, a new peak develops for the SHU patterns. This peak is at a posi- tion of about √ 2 compared to the first peak, indicating the formation of a square crystal. While there is a discontinuity in g(r) at r = R with increasing height for HD patterns, there is only a weak discontinuity in S(k) at k = K for SHU patterns. Apparently scattering is 'pushed back' in the SHU system to higher k-values in order to allow for an even larger k gap than necessary by the stealthiness condition.Positional order gradually develops with φ and χ as visible by the increasing height of the peaks in g(r) and S(k).

        <p>The silicon rod radius for the transverse-magnetic (TM) case, r/a = 0.189, was considered optimal in [3] [Fig. 3(left)]. When the protocol used to generate the trivalent network is applied to a hexagonal lattice, the honeycomb lattice is retrieved. We optimize the geometric parameter of the honeycomb lattice to maximize the photonic band gap (PBG) width in transverse-electric (TE) polarization. The wall thickness corresponding to the widest PBG is w/a = 0.288 [Fig. 3The silicon rod radius for the transverse-magnetic (TM) case, r/a = 0.189, was considered optimal in [3] [Fig. 3(left)].

        <p>In Fig. 4a we present a colormap of the relative width of the overlapping gaps in TE and TM polarizations as a function of the geometrical parameters of the decorated network. The circle in this figure represents the chosen parameters in this work for the decorated network. The shaded area represents decorated networks where the cylinder is fully embedded into the walls. In Fig. 4b we show the complete PBG relative width as a function of the wall thickness. As can be seen here, it is possible to open a complete but narrow PBG using a non-decorated honeycomb lattice. Nevertheless its maximum width is only 1.2% and the gap will have a negligible width after introducing even small amounts of disorder.In Fig. 4a we present a colormap of the relative width of the overlapping gaps in TE and TM polarizations as a function of the geometrical parameters of the decorated network.

        <p>We apply the supercell method [4], which considers a square piece of the disordered structure as the primitive cell of a periodic lattice. To avoid spurious states related to the surface termination that can populate the otherwise clean PBG, it is necessary to generate seed point patterns using periodic boundary conditions matching the geometry of the supercell. The minimum number of bands that need to be calculated depends on the number of scattering units N in the supercell and on the polarization. In all the considered cases, our seed point patterns contain N 200 points. The MPB calculations are done setting the resolution to a/32 and the tolerance in frequency to 10 -4 , which is sufficient to resolve the spectral properties or our systems. In Fig. 5 we compare the structure factor of the single MPB samples (derived from the point patterns shown in Fig. 1a and1c in the main text). We first compute analytically the full structure factor by multiplying S(k) of the point pattern (HD and SHU) with the form factor F (k) of a circle with r/a = 0.189. We then divide the result by the square of the surface of the cylinder, s = πr 2 (open circles in Fig 5). Next we compute the two dimensional Fourier transform of the discretized structure as generated by the 
            <rs type="software">MPB</rs> software. Computing the angular average we obtain (again after scaling by s -2 ) the corresponding S(k), shown as crosses in Fig. 5. Despite some visible difference in the log-plot due to discretization we find that the agreement between the analytic (circles) and fully numerical (crosses) structure factors is good. In particular the MPB discretized structure retains the SHU character and shows a drop by more the four orders of magnitude in S(k) for ka/2π &lt; 0.5. From the band diagrams [Fig. 6 and Fig. 7] we obtain the precise position of the band edges and also the effec- tive refractive index n eff of the medium at low frequency.
        </p>
        <p>To determine n eff we apply two approaches: (i) fitting the lowest band (solid lines in the figures) to the dispersion relation of a homogeneous medium, and (ii) the Maxwell-Garnett mixing rule. In general, the two methods give values for n eff that differ by less than 2% for all examined cases.To determine n eff we apply two approaches: (i) fitting the lowest band (solid lines in the figures) to the dispersion relation of a homogeneous medium, and (ii) the Maxwell-Garnett mixing rule.

        <p>In the case of TM polarization [Fig. 6] according to the Maxwell-Garnett rule the effective permittivity for rods of filling fraction φ 0 in vacuum is eff = n 2 eff = ( rods -1) φ 0 +1. With the present parameters we obtain n eff 1.48.In the case of TM polarization [Fig. 6] according to the Maxwell-Garnett rule the effective permittivity for rods of filling fraction φ 0 in vacuum is eff = n 2 eff = ( rods -1) φ 0 +1.

        <p>If we compare the band structure for TM polarization [Fig. 6] with the band structure for the decorated honeycomb [Fig. 7], we see a close correspondence in the position of the PBG for both polarizations. While the first TE PBG opens between the first and second bands for the decorated honeycomb (corresponding to the N and N + 1 bands in the supercell), the first TM PBG opens between the second and the third bands in the decorated honeycomb, (corresponding to the 2N and 2N + 1 bands in the superlattice). This is a rather general behavior found for all values of χ &gt; ∼ 0.2 and φ &gt; ∼ 0.2. The trend is not followed for smaller parameter values.If we compare the band structure for TM polarization [Fig. 6] with the band structure for the decorated honeycomb [Fig. 7], we see a close correspondence in the position of the PBG for both polarizations.

        <p>A full calculation of the photonic density of states (DOS) requires a massive sampling in reciprocal space. Such a sampling for a complex supercell geometry and band counts reaching several hundreds can be prohibitively slow, even when using relatively large computational facilities, which makes it difficult to systematically scan the χ and φ parameters. In order to alleviate the required computational efforts, we note that the band structure close to the band edges in the supercell method is nearly flat. This fact suggests that it is sufficient to use a comparably sparse sampling grid in reciprocal space when calculating the DOS. Hence, we sample along the Γ -X -M -Γ path (of the square lattice in the supercell method) with only 31 points.A full calculation of the photonic density of states (DOS) requires a massive sampling in reciprocal space.

        <p>We compute a frequency histogram and normalize it by the histogram that would be obtained in a homogeneous medium with refractive index given by n eff . The discrete spectrum in a homogeneous medium with effective refractive index n eff at each k point is given by ω (k, G) = c |k + G| /n eff for all reciprocal lattice vectors G of the super lattice. The histogram used to normalize is built by considering all the eigenfrequencies of the homogeneous medium spectrum at each of the sampling points in the reciprocal space used in the band structure calculation of the disordered systems. This procedure gives the normalized DOS (nDOS) that is presented in the main text. The nDOS is a convenient way of integrating the information contained in the full band structure and provides a useful way of comparing different systems.We compute a frequency histogram and normalize it by the histogram that would be obtained in a homogeneous medium with refractive index given by n eff .

        <p>We study the dependence of the nDOS for HD and SHU systems on the correlation parameters φ and χ in TM and TE polarization separately [Fig. 8] and both polarization simultaneously [Fig. 9]. Already for low values of φ and χ, the nDOS is strongly depleted in the region where the PBG eventually emerges at higher correlation. Overall, the trend of the nDOS as the systems become more correlated is similar for both types of disorder and all polarizations. For high values of φ or χ, the nDOS resembles that of a perfect lattice: nearly flat at low frequency, followed by a peak near the PBG edge. The higher the degree of correlation in the structure, the larger the PBG width and the higher the nDOS peak near the PBG edge.We study the dependence of the nDOS for HD and SHU systems on the correlation parameters φ and χ in TM and TE polarization separately [Fig. 8] and both polarization simultaneously [Fig. 9].

        <p>For the decorated networks we divide the obtained frequency histograms by the sum of the histograms obtained for TE and TM polarizations in a homogeneous medium with an effective refractive index that depends on polarization. In all cases shown in Fig. 9 the effective refractive indices n eff in TE and TM polarization, obtained from fitting the lowest band to a homogeneous medium, vary by less than 0.5%. In particular, we have n than in structures optimized solely for TM or TE polarizations. Only for a strong correlation, the PBG width is larger than the bin size of the histogram. Nevertheless, the nDOS is dramatically lowered already for weak correlations forming a pseudo-gap at the position where the full PBG eventually appears.For the decorated networks we divide the obtained frequency histograms by the sum of the histograms obtained for TE and TM polarizations in a homogeneous medium with an effective refractive index that depends on polarization.

        <p>We introduce defects in the trivalent networks by randomly removing links with a certain probability p. We have studied the effect of link removal for the trivalent networks presented in the main text (SHU with χ = 0.50 and HD with φ = 0.60). To calculate the PBG we follow exactly the same supercell method as explained above, this time with different amounts of randomly removed links. PBG data for different values of χ (SHU) and φ (HD) and different link removal probability p are shown in the main text.We introduce defects in the trivalent networks by randomly removing links with a certain probability p.

        <p>As an illustration of the results we obtained, in Fig. 10 we plot a few of the considered cases. In Fig. 10a, the band structure obtained by the supercell method is presented together with a cartoon of the trivalent network we used. This structure is obtained after applying the triangulation protocol as explained in the main text to a SHU (χ = 0.50) seed pattern containing 97 points, that leads to a structure with N = 194 nodes. The PBG relative width (only TE polarization) is ∆ν/ν 0 = 28.6%. The averaged value over 10 samples for a p = 5% probability of link removel is ∆ν/ν 0 = 10.4%. In Fig. 10b,c we plot the band structure and corresponding network for the cases of widest and narrowest PBG found in the sampling, ∆ν/ν 0 = 14.9% and ∆ν/ν 0 = 5.1% respectively. A closer look on Fig. 10c suggest that the gape closes more rapidly whenever the defect affected regions form chains spanning the across whole structure, in agreement withe earlier studies on 2D crystal lattices [5].As an illustration of the results we obtained, in Fig. 10 we plot a few of the considered cases.
