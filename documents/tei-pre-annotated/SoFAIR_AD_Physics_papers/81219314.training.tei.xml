        <p>We introduce a class of four dimensional field theories constructed by quotienting ordinary N = 4 U(N ) SYM by particular combinations of R-symmetry and SL(2, Z) automorphisms. These theories appear naturally on the worldvolume of D3 branes probing terminal singularities in F-theory, where they can be thought of as non-perturbative generalizations of the O3 plane. We focus on cases preserving only 12 supercharges, where the quotient gives rise to theories with coupling fixed at a value of order one. These constructions possess an unconventional large N limit described by a non-trivial F-theory fibration with base AdS 5 × (S 5 /Z k ). Upon reduction on a circle the N = 3 theories flow to well-known N = 6 ABJM theories.We introduce a class of four dimensional field theories constructed by quotienting ordinary N = 4 U(N ) SYM by particular combinations of R-symmetry and SL(2, Z) automorphisms.

        <p>One of the fascinating properties of string theory lies in its ability to geometrize various deep and subtle field theory phenomena, often giving insight not available in any other known way.One of the fascinating properties of string theory lies in its ability to geometrize various deep and subtle field theory phenomena, often giving insight not available in any other known way.</p>
        <p>A particularly fruitful geometric context in which to study four dimensional field theories is F-theory [1]. It can be understood as a geometric rewriting of IIB string theory with an axio-dilaton varying over a base, but crucially also as a particular limit of M-theory on the Calabi-Yau fourfold defined by the axio-dilaton fibration. Questions about the field theory translate into questions about the geometry of the fourfold, and can often be dealt with using algebraic geometry methods.A particularly fruitful geometric context in which to study four dimensional field theories is F-theory [1].

        <p>A crucial point is that most of the interesting phenomena (for a field theorist using M-theory as a computing tool) arise when the geometry develops singularities. Much of the recent work dealing with F-theory model building (starting with [2][3][4][5]), for instance, is concerned with the construction of appropriately singular geometries in order to model features of the standard model, and of its supersymmetric and grand unified extensions.A crucial point is that most of the interesting phenomena (for a field theorist using M-theory as a computing tool) arise when the geometry develops singularities.

        <p>While the physics of interest happens on the singular locus, we do not have much control directly over M-theory on singular spaces, so in practice one constructs a family of smooth Calabi-Yau spaces parameterized by some parameter t, such that when t → 0 the Calabi-Yau develops the singularity of interest, but the representatives for t = 0 are all smooth. By following which cycles in the geometry vanish as we approach t = 0 we can read off which BPS states become massless at the singular point [6], and thus reconstruct much of the low energy physics.While the physics of interest happens on the singular locus, we do not have much control directly over M-theory on singular spaces, so in practice one constructs a family of smooth Calabi-Yau spaces parameterized by some parameter t, such that when t → 0 the Calabi-Yau develops the singularity of interest, but the representatives for t = 0 are all smooth.

        <p>In this note we deal with singularities in the M-theory description of certain four dimensional theories that cannot be approached in this way: one cannot construct a family of smooth Calabi-Yau spaces abutting the singular Calabi-Yau. Nevertheless, as we will discuss below, examples of singularities in the M-theory fourfold that cannot be smoothed out in a supersymmetric way are both rather common -the ordinary O3 plane gives rise to such a structure, and the local geometry of the M-theory backgrounds that appear in our construction is precisely the one in the ABJM construction [7,8] -and quite interesting from a field theoretic point of view. We focus on the simplest hitherto unknown examples, which happen to preserve twelve (but not sixteen) supercharges in four dimensions, which we refer to as N = 3 theories in the customary fashion. It is well known that four dimensional supergravity Lagrangians preserving just twelve supercharges exist, but to our knowledge this is the first time that N = 3 examples outside that class have been constructed.In this note we deal with singularities in the M-theory description of certain four dimensional theories that cannot be approached in this way: one cannot construct a family of smooth Calabi-Yau spaces abutting the singular Calabi-Yau.

        <p>The theories under analysis here have a number of amusing properties. The most characteristic one -and the one that allows them to evade well known results [9] stating that perturbative N = 3 theories necessarily have N = 4 supersymmetry -is that their associated SCFTs do not have a marginal deformation associated with taking the gauge coupling to a perturbative regime. This fact will in fact appear rather naturally from the construction: when formulated in field theory terms the N = 3 theories in this paper arise as quotients of ordinary N = 4 U(N ) SYM theory by a symmetry involving a non-trivial action of the SL(2, Z) duality group, together with an action of the SU(4) R-symmetry group. (Quotients obtained by gauging a subgroup of the SU(4) R-symmetry group can be seen to describe the theory of D3 branes at Calabi-Yau orbifold singularities in perturbative IIB string theory [10], our work can be thought of as a generalization of this viewpoint to F-theory, where extending the orbifold action to the fiber is natural to consider.) For generic values of the Yang-Mills coupling the SL(2, Z) duality group is not a symmetry of the theory, and it only becomes so for specific self-dual values of the coupling. Deformations away from this point should then be projected out from the quotient, and indeed we show in section 3.3 that this is the case.The theories under analysis here have a number of amusing properties.

        <p>This construction is most naturally motivated from the M-theory viewpoint, where our construction comes from orbifold actions on R 3 × C 3 × T 2 that only make sense for specific values of the complex structure of the torus fiber. This was in fact our original motivation for approaching this problem: as reviewed in section 2 the ordinary O3 plane in IIB string theory can be understood as an orbifold of IIB theory in flat space by an orbifold generator involving the action of the -1 ∈ SL(2, Z) element of the duality group. It is fairly natural to ask if this can be generalized in the F-theory context to orbifolds involving duality elements acting non-trivially on the IIB axio-dilaton, and if so what is the physics of probe D3 branes on top of the resulting singularity. The purpose of this note is to answer the existence question in the affirmative, and initiate the study of the resulting field theories.This construction is most naturally motivated from the M-theory viewpoint, where our construction comes from orbifold actions on R 3 × C 3 × T 2 that only make sense for specific values of the complex structure of the torus fiber.

        <p>In order to motivate our construction, we now revisit a familiar system, the theory of D3 branes on top of an O3 plane. This system is most commonly studied from the point of view of the worldsheet CFT, a construction which we briefly review now (for a more exhaustive review see for instance [12]). In this context the theory on the D3 branes on top of O3 planes is defined as the quotient of the theory of open strings moving in flat space with D3 boundary conditions, by the orientifold action I(-1) F L Ω.

        <p>leaving the four real dimensions along the O3 plane invariant. Before quotienting by the orientifold action the low energy description of the system is given by four dimensional N = 4 U(N ) theory (forgetting about the ten dimensional dynamics in the bulk, which decouples at low energies), arising from open strings with ends on the D3 stack. The orientifold preserves all the supersymmetry of the original D3 stack, but projects down the gauge group to a subgroup. For concreteness we locate the D3 stack on top of the O3 plane, i.e. at z 1 = z 2 = z 3 = 0. The nature of the preserved subgroup depends on the choice of the representation of the orientifold action on the Chan-Paton factors. There are two inequivalent choices for this representation: we either end up with the algebra so(N ) (we will discuss the global form of the gauge group momentarily), or usp(N ). In this latter case we need to restrict to N ∈ 2Z for consistency. We now want to discuss this construction from two alternative viewpoints, in order to motivate the generalization presented in the next section. Consider first the description of the system in F-theory, obtained by taking the zero size limit of the fiber for an Mtheory compactification down to three dimensions on a torus fibered Calabi-Yau fourfold.

        <p>A simple derivation of this fact can be obtained by looking to the action of (-1) F L Ω on the IIB spacetime fields. For instance, in the CFT language it is easy to see that both the NSNS two-form B 2 and the RR two-form C 2 get an intrinsic minus sign under (-1) F L Ω, while in the F/M-theory language they come from the reduction of C 3 along two independent one-cycles of the torus fiber. We immediately conclude that (-1) F L Ω acts as inversion of the torus. The F-theory lift of a stack of N D3 branes in flat space (the U(N ) theory) is given by a stack of N M2 branes on C 3 × T 2 . The fibration is trivial in this case, with the JHEP03(2016)083 complex structure of the torus arbitrary. This arbitrariness maps to the existence of the marginal deformation of N = 4 U(N ) changing the value of the complexified coupling.

(For instance, if we take e 1 = 1, e 2 = τ , the fixed points are at {0, 1 2 , 1 2 τ, 1 2 (τ + 1)}.) Close to any of these fixed points we have a C 4 /Z 2 geometry, with the Z 2 inverting all coordinates of the C 4 . Notice that the C 4 /Z 2 singularity is terminal [13,14]: it admits no supersymmetric resolution or deformation into a smooth fourfold.

        <p>We will come back to the F/M description momentarily, but let us first consider the field theory description of the orientifold operation. Such a description in terms of the low energy EFT must exist, since the N = 4 theories before and after orientifolding are consistent truncations of the full string theory. It will be illuminating to consider the simplest case: the theory on one mobile D3 brane on top of an O3 -plane. As is well known, this is given by the N = 4 theory with so(2) algebra. At this level the theory is identical to the U(1) theory arising from a D3 on flat space, without considering the orientifold. There is a difference when one considers the global structure of the gauge group, though. This is perhaps best seen by comparing the moduli spaces. For the U(1) theory we expect the moduli space to be simply C 3 , while for the so(2) theory we would rather expect C 3 /Z 2 (with the Z 2 acting with a minus sign on all C 3 coordinates). The moduli space arises from the vevs of the scalars on the N = 4 vector multiplet, which take values in the adjoint. A way to achieve our goal, while keeping supersymmetry, is then to take a quotient by a Z 2 acting as t → -t on the algebra generators. For the cases of orientifolds giving rise to SO(2N + 1) and USp(2N ) groups the expected Z 2 quotient of moduli space is always present as part of the Weyl group, but the Weyl group is trivial for so (2). Rather, the sign action is precisely the Z 2 outer automorphism of the SO(2) group enhancing it to O(2), so we learn that the expected form of the gauge group isWe will come back to the F/M description momentarily, but let us first consider the field theory description of the orientifold operation.

        <p>There is a way of understanding this Z 2 automorphism that connects nicely to the F/M description, and which immediately suggests the generalization that is the main topic of this note. The N = 4 theory with gauge group U(1) has a global symmetry which includes the R-symmetry group SU(4) R , that has a natural interpretation as the rotation group in 1 This conclusion for the global form of the gauge group can be reached in many additional ways. For example, upon compactification of the theory on a circle, and T-dualization, the global form must be O(2) so that we can construct the component containing two O2 planes. Or simply by looking to the perturbative symmetry group: as opposed to the type I case, in this case there are no finite action non-BPS instantons spoiling the conclusion.There is a way of understanding this Z 2 automorphism that connects nicely to the F/M description, and which immediately suggests the generalization that is the main topic of this note.

        <p>Interacting theories. Consider the O(2N ) theory, with N &gt; 1. In order to construct this theory field theoretically, starting with a theory without orientifold, we need to generalize (2.6) slightly. The first way of doing this is familiar from the worldsheet description of the orientifold. Start with the theory in the double cover of the geometry and in the absence of orientifold, having twice the amount of mobile branes, giving rise to a gauge group U(2N ).

        <p>in such a way that only antisymmetric gauge matrices survive, giving rise to the so(2N ) gauge algebra. Nevertheless, for the non-perturbative generalizations that we have in mind a different description is perhaps more adequate. We work directly on the quotient geometry, where we have N mobile branes. Away from the singularity in the geometry, the low energy gauge group is U(N ). As the stack of branes hits the singularity some light modes become JHEP03(2016)083 massless, and enhance the algebra to so(2N ). In the M-theory description these light modes arise from BIon excitations on the probe M2 brane stack. More precisely, the massless modes transform in the ⊕ representation of the U(N ) group. Let us separate slightly the M2 branes in the stack for ease of visualization, and consider the topology of the quotient geometry, removing the origin of the base C 3 for simplicity. The projection of the orbifold to the base has topology R × (S 5 /Z 2 ), which for the purposes of homology is the same as S 5 /Z 2 = RP 5 . There is a non-trivial cycle in this RP 5 arising in its S 5 double cover from the path between one point and its image. The action on the T 2 fiber homology as we go around this closed path is changing the sign of the generators: a (p, q) cycle goes to (-p, -q). So, between any two distinct M2 branes on the stack, generating a Cartan subgroup U(1) 2 , there are two non-trivial paths which differ by the non-trivial torsional element in the base. Due to the non-trivial monodromy in the fiber, if one gives a state with (1, 1) charges under the U(1) 2 Cartan, the other gives a state with (1, -1) charges. We recognize these states as the generators of the adjoint and antisymmetric representations of U(N ), and together they enhance U(1) N to O(2N ).in such a way that only antisymmetric gauge matrices survive, giving rise to the so(2N ) gauge algebra. Nevertheless, for the non-perturbative generalizations that we have in mind a different description is perhaps more adequate. We work directly on the quotient geometry, where we have N mobile branes. Away from the singularity in the geometry, the low energy gauge group is U(N ). As the stack of branes hits the singularity some light modes become JHEP03(2016)083 massless, and enhance the algebra to so(2N ). In the M-theory description these light modes arise from BIon excitations on the probe M2 brane stack. More precisely, the massless modes transform in the ⊕ representation of the U(N ) group. Let us separate slightly the M2 branes in the stack for ease of visualization, and consider the topology of the quotient geometry, removing the origin of the base C 3 for simplicity. The projection of the orbifold to the base has topology R × (S 5 /Z 2 ), which for the purposes of homology is the same as S 5 /Z 2 = RP 5 . There is a non-trivial cycle in this RP 5 arising in its S 5 double cover from the path between one point and its image. The action on the T 2 fiber homology as we go around this closed path is changing the sign of the generators: a (p, q) cycle goes to (-p, -q). So, between any two distinct M2 branes on the stack, generating a Cartan subgroup U(1) 2 , there are two non-trivial paths which differ by the non-trivial torsional element in the base. Due to the non-trivial monodromy in the fiber, if one gives a state with (1, 1) charges under the U(1) 2 Cartan, the other gives a state with (1, -1) charges. We recognize these states as the generators of the adjoint and antisymmetric representations of U(N ), and together they enhance U(1) N to O(2N ).</p>
        <p>We could have also considered states going from one brane on the stack to itself, wrapping the non-trivial cycle in RP 5 . Whether they exist or not depends on the NSNS charge of the O3 plane: they are absent for O3 -and they are present for O3 + . Had we included them, the antisymmetric would have been replaced by a symmetric representation, giving rise to an enhancement to USp(2N ) when the stack hits the singularity. How do we explain this distinction in the resulting projection without resorting to CFT language? One suggestive observation is that the O3 -and O3 + can be transformed into each other by dropping a NS5 wrapped on the nontrivial (twisted) two-cycle of RP 5 [16,17]. The NS5 brane and the fundamental string are electric-magnetic duals, so this suggests that the origin of the distinction, from the target space point of view, may come from an unsatisfied Dirac quantization condition on the F1/M2 worldvolume if we drop an even number of NS5/M5 branes on the O3 -plane. It would be very interesting to develop this viewpoint further as a possible tool in order to study the spectrum of BPS states in the more exotic configurations we construct later in the paper.We could have also considered states going from one brane on the stack to itself, wrapping the non-trivial cycle in RP 5 .

        <p>The field theories discussed in the previous section have N = 3 supersymmetry in four dimensions. This is surprising since there is a well known argument [9] which states that, in the absence of gravity, perturbative four dimensional theories with twelve supercharges are actually N = 4. We review such argument in the following stressing the fact that it only applies to theories with a perturbative limit. Since the cases we are studying are intrinsically non-perturbative, the argument does not apply. Furthermore, we will explicitly show that the operator spectrum of these theories does not fall into representations of SU(4) R , so there is no possibility for the supersymmetry to enhance to N = 4 (which could have happened in principle, even if the standard argument for enhancement does not apply). Consider an N = 3 supersymmetric QFT in 4d Minkowski space. This means that the N = 3 supersymmetry algebra has a well-defined action on the space of operators that define the theory, so these can be arranged in irreducible representations of the supersymmetry algebra. As usual, we want CPT to be a symmetry of the theory so it should also act on the space of operators. Then, under CPT an irreducible representation of supersymmetry may be mapped to itself or it can happen that two of them are mapped to each other. Now let us assume that the theory has a Lagrangian description. This means that there are certain preferred operators (elementary fields) which are the ones that appear in the Lagrangian and in the measure of the path integral. The Lagrangian may depend on some parameters and we assume there is a point in such parameter space where the theory becomes free (the Lagrangian is quadratic in the elementary fields). At that point, the operator algebra can be recovered from the elementary fields and the Hilbert space obtained from canonical quantization.

        <p>• The elementary fields include only massless vector multiplets. As it happens, there are two kinds of N = 3 vector multiplets that get mapped into each other under CPT and the two of them together make a vector multiplet of N = 4. All the possible actions involving these fields turn out to be invariant under N = 4 [9]. Notice that since the whole space of operators is built from the elementary fields (which are in an N = 4 representation) we have that the action of the N = 4 algebra extends to all of them. Now one can argue that since the number of supersymmetries is discrete, it cannot change as we move continuously towards the strong coupling regime. This is the argument that in gauge theories, N = 3 supersymmetry is actually N = 4.• The elementary fields include only massless vector multiplets.

        <p>As a final comment, notice that the fact that the marginal operator associated with changes in the Yang-Mills coupling is projected out can also be understood from this viewpoint. The relevant marginal operator is of the form F ∧ F + iF ∧ F + . . . , given by a component with conformal dimension 4 in the n = 2 multiplet. It is a singlet of SU(4) R , but transforms nontrivially under SL(2, Z) for k &gt; 2 (for instance, for k = 4 we have (F, F ) → ( F, -F ), so the multiplet gets an overall minus sign), so it gets projected out in the quotient N = 3 theory.As a final comment, notice that the fact that the marginal operator associated with changes in the Yang-Mills coupling is projected out can also be understood from this viewpoint.

        <p>A first observation is that if we compactify the system on a circle, it admits a dual description as a stack of M2 branes moving on a background with singularities of the type C 4 /Z k .

        <p>As an example, one can hope to gain information about the four dimensional theories by studying the superconformal index of appropriate ABJM theories. The k = 1, 2 cases have in fact been approached in a related way [27], and it would be rather interesting to generalize this analysis in order to learn more about the class of theories introduced in this note. Also, we have been strongly guided by the IIB string construction, but this comes at the risk of missing possible consistent theories. It would be desirable to sharpen the purely field theoretical description of our construction, in order to have a purely field theoretical understanding of which orbifolds are allowed and which extra massless particles one must include for each choice of field theory orbifold. For instance: we started with U(N ) theories, coming from the D3 branes, but this is certainly not the only known example of N = 4 theories. Perhaps other N = 3 theories, beyond the ones discussed here, can be constructed starting from N = 4 theories with other gauge groups.

Nonetheless the close connection between these generalized orientifolds and ABJM-like theories -a field in which much progress has been achieved in the last years -gives a promising window into this interesting class of constructions.In this paper we have argued for the existence of interesting nontrivial theories arising from D3 branes probing what are essentially non-perturbative F-theory generalizations JHEP03(2016)083 niques (with possibly the remarkable exception of [35]).

        <p>where the integration over the one-form B is included so that once we integrate over it we effectively restrict ourselves to closed field strengths. For the case in which spacetime in R 4 , this is indeed equivalent to (A.2). If, on the other hand, we integrate over F , we end up with the dual description of the theory in which B is the gauge potential and the gauge coupling is -1/τ . The crucial point is that in order to make the extra term B ∧ dF invariant under Z 2 , we must declare that B is odd under it. Thus, we see that that the Z 2 that acts on the electric variables must act at the same time on the magnetic ones. In other words, the dual theory is again given by an O(2) theory rather than SO (2). This can also be seen from the realization of the Z 2 as the product of R-symmetry and SL(2, Z), as explained in section 2.where the integration over the one-form B is included so that once we integrate over it we effectively restrict ourselves to closed field strengths.

        <p>There is a slightly different way to see this which applies to O(2N ) for any N . One can regard the O(2N ) theory as arising from a Z 2 quotient of SO(2N ), where the Z 2 acts on both the electric and magnetic descriptions in the same way. Thus, since the original SO(2N ) theory is self-dual, we expect the same is true for O(2N ).There is a slightly different way to see this which applies to O(2N ) for any N .
