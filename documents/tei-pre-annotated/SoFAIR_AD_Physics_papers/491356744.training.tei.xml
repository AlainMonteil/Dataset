        <p>Although the dark matter is usually assumed to be made up of some form of elementary particle, primordial black holes (PBHs) could also provide some of it. However, various constraints restrict the possible mass windows to 10 16 -10 17 g, 10 20 -10 24 g, and 10-10 3 M ࣻ . The last possibility is contentious but of special interest in view of the recent detection of black hole mergers by LIGO/Virgo. PBHs might have important consequences and resolve various cosmological conundra even if they account for only a small fraction of the dark matter density. In particular, those larger than 10 3 M ࣻ could generate cosmological structures through the seed or Poisson effect, thereby alleviating some problems associated with the standard cold dark matter scenario, and sufficiently large PBHs might provide seeds for the supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei.

        <p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) have been a source of interest for nearly 50 years (1) even though there is still no evidence for them. One reason for this interest is that only PBHs could be small enough for Hawking radiation to be important (2). This discovery has not yet been confirmed experimentally, and there remain major conceptual puzzles associated with the process. Nevertheless, it is generally recognized as one of the key developments in twentieth-century physics because it beautifully unifies general relativity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics. The fact that Hawking reached this discovery only through contemplating the properties of PBHs illustrates that it can be useful to study something even if it does not exist. But, of course, the situation is much more interesting if PBHs do exist.Primordial black holes (PBHs) have been a source of interest for nearly 50 years (1) even though there is still no evidence for them.

        <p>PBHs smaller than about 10 15 g would have evaporated by now with many interesting cosmological consequences (3). Studies of such consequences have placed useful constraints on models of the early Universe, and, more positively, evaporating PBHs have been invoked to explain certain features, such as the extragalactic (4) and Galactic (5) γ -ray backgrounds, antimatter in cosmic rays (6), the annihilation line radiation from the Galactic center (7), the reionization of the pregalactic medium (8), and some short-period γ -ray bursts (9). However, there are other possible explanations for most of these features, so there is no definitive evidence for evaporating PBHs. Only the original papers for each topic are cited here; a more comprehensive list of references can be found in Reference 3.PBHs smaller than about 10 15 g would have evaporated by now with many interesting cosmological consequences (3).

        <p>Attention has therefore shifted to PBHs larger than 10 15 g, which are unaffected by Hawking radiation. Such PBHs might have various astrophysical consequences, such as the seeding of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galactic nuclei (10), the generation of large-scale structure through Poisson fluctuations (11), and important effects on the thermal and ionization history of the Universe (12). Again, only the original papers are cited here. But perhaps the most exciting possibility-and the main focus of this review-is that PBHs could provide the dark matter that accounts for 25% of the critical density (13), an idea that goes back to the earliest days of PBH research (14). Because PBHs formed in the radiation-dominated era, they are not subject to the well-known big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraint that baryons can have at most 5% of the critical density (15). They should therefore be classified as nonbaryonic and behave like any other form of cold dark matter (CDM) (16). It is sometimes assumed that they must form before BBN, implying an upper limit of 10 5 M ࣻ , but the fraction of the Universe in PBHs at that time would be tiny, so the effect on BBN might only be small.Attention has therefore shifted to PBHs larger than 10 15 g, which are unaffected by Hawking radiation.

        <p>As with other CDM candidates, there is still no compelling evidence that PBHs provide the dark matter. However, there have been claims of evidence from dynamical and lensing effects. In particular, there was a flurry of excitement in 1997, when the MACHO microlensing results (17) suggested that the dark matter might comprise compact objects of mass 0.5M ࣻ . Alternative microlensing candidates could be excluded, and PBHs of this mass might naturally form at the quark-hadron phase transition at 10 -5 s (18). Subsequently, however, it was shown that such objects could account for only 20% of the dark matter, and indeed, the entire mass range of 10 -7 to 10M ࣻ was later excluded from providing all of it (19). In recent decades, attention has focused on other mass ranges in which PBHs could have a significant density, and numerous constraints allow only three possibilities: the asteroid mass range (10 16 -10 17 g), the sublunar mass range (10 20 -10 26 g), and the intermediate mass range (10-10 3 M ࣻ ).As with other CDM candidates, there is still no compelling evidence that PBHs provide the dark matter.

        <p>We discuss the constraints on f (M), the fraction of the halo in PBHs of mass M, in Section 3; this discussion is a much-reduced version of the recent review by Carr et al. (20). The results are summarized in Figure 1; all the limits assume that the PBHs have a monochromatic mass function and cluster in the Galactic halo in the same way as other forms of CDM. Although, for the sake of completeness, we include evaporating PBHs, we do not focus on them in this review except insomuch as they may leave stable Planck-mass relics because these could also be dark matter candidates. However, it is worth stressing that if Hawking evaporation were avoided for some reason, PBHs could provide the dark matter all the way down to the Planck mass with few (if any) nongravitational constraints.We discuss the constraints on f (M), the fraction of the halo in PBHs of mass M, in Section 3; this discussion is a much-reduced version of the recent review by Carr et al.

        <p>At first sight, Figure 1 implies that PBHs are excluded from having an appreciable density in almost every mass range. However, our intention is not to put nails in the coffin of the PBH scenario because every constraint is a potential signature. In particular, there are still some mass windows in which PBHs could provide the dark matter. PBHs could be generated by inflation in all of these windows, but theorists are split as to which one they favor. For example, Inomata et al. (21) argue that double inflation can produce a peak at around 10 20 g, while Clesse &amp; García-Bellido (22) argue that hybrid inflation can produce a peak at around 10M ࣻ . A peak at the latter mass could also be produced by a reduction in the pressure at the quark-hadron phase transition (23) even if the primordial fluctuations have no feature on that scale.

        <p>It should be stressed that nonevaporating PBHs are dark even if they do not provide all the dark matter, so this review does not focus exclusively on the proposal that PBHs solve the dark matter problem. Many objects are dark, and it is not implausible that the dark matter might comprise some mixture of PBHs and weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Indeed, such a mixture would have interesting consequences for both. Also, even if PBHs provide only a small fraction of the dark matter, they may still be of great cosmological interest. For example, they could play a role in generating the SMBHs in galactic nuclei, which have obvious astrophysical significance even though they provide only 0.1% of the dark matter.It should be stressed that nonevaporating PBHs are dark even if they do not provide all the dark matter, so this review does not focus exclusively on the proposal that PBHs solve the dark matter problem.

        <p>The constraints shown in Figure 1 assume that the PBH mass function is monochromatic (i.e., width M ∼ M). However, there are many scenarios in which one would expect the mass function to be extended. For example, inflation often produces a log-normal mass function (24), and critical collapse generates an extended low-mass tail (25). In the context of the dark matter problem, this situation is a two-edged sword. On the one hand, it means that the total PBH density may suffice to explain the dark matter even if the density in any particular mass band is small and within the observational bounds. On the other hand, even if PBHs can provide all the dark matter at some mass scale, the extended mass function may still violate the constraints at some other scale (26). While there is now a well-understood procedure for analyzing constraints in the extended case (27), identifying the optimal PBH mass window remains problematic (28).The constraints shown in Figure 1 assume that the PBH mass function is monochromatic (i.e., width M ∼ M).

        <p>The proposal that the dark matter could comprise PBHs in the intermediate mass range has attracted much attention recently as a result of the LIGO/Virgo detections of merging binary black holes with mass in the range of 10 to 50M ࣻ (29). Because the black holes are larger than initially expected, they have been suggested to represent a new population, although the mainstream view remains that they are the remnants of ordinary stars (30). One possibility is that they were of Population III origin (i.e., forming between decoupling and galaxy formation). Indeed, the suggestion that LIGO might detect gravitational waves (GWs) from coalescing intermediate-mass Population III black holes was first made more than 30 years ago (31), and, rather remarkably, Kinugawa et al. (32) predicted a Population III coalescence peak at 30M ࣻ shortly before the first LIGO detection of black holes of that mass. Another possibility, which is more relevant to the present considerations, is that the LIGO/Virgo black holes are primordial, as first discussed in Reference 33. However, this scenario does not require the PBHs to provide all the dark matter. While this possibility has been suggested (34), the predicted merger rate depends on when the binaries form and uncertain astrophysical factors, so the dark matter fraction could still be small (35). Indeed, the LIGO/Virgo results have already been used to constrain the PBH dark matter fraction (36), although the limit is sensitive to the predicted merger rate, which is very model dependent (37). Note that the PBH density should peak at a lower mass than the coalescence signal for an extended PBH mass function because the GW amplitude scales as the black hole mass.The proposal that the dark matter could comprise PBHs in the intermediate mass range has attracted much attention recently as a result of the LIGO/Virgo detections of merging binary black holes with mass in the range of 10 to 50M ࣻ (29).

        <p>In Section 2 of this review, we elaborate on several aspects of PBH formation, including a general discussion of their mass and density, a review of PBH formation scenarios, and a consideration of the effects of non-Gaussianity and nonsphericity. In Section 3, we review current constraints on the density of PBHs with a monochromatic mass function, these constraints being associated with a variety of lensing, dynamical, accretion, and GW effects. At first sight, these effects seem to exclude the possibility of PBHs providing the dark matter in any mass range, but this conclusion may be avoided for an extended mass function, and most limits are subject to caveats anyway. More positively, in Section 4 we provide an overview of various observational conundra that can be explained by PBHs-especially those associated with intermediate-mass black holes and SMBHs. In Section 5, we discuss how the thermal history of the Universe naturally provides peaks in the PBH mass function at the mass scales associated with these conundra, with the bumpy mass function obviating some of the limits discussed in Section 3. We also present a recently developed mechanism that helps to resolve a long-standing fine-tuning problem associated with PBH formation. In Section 6, we discuss scenarios that involve a mixture of PBHs and particle dark matter.

In some circumstances, PBHs may form over an extended period, resulting in a wide range of masses. Even if they formed at a single epoch, their mass spectrum could still extend considerably below the horizon mass because of so-called critical phenomena (39)(40)(41)(42)(43), although most of the PBH density would still be in the most massive ones.Hence, PBHs could span an enormous mass range: Those formed at the Planck time (10 -43 s) would have the Planck mass (10 -5 g), whereas those formed at 1 s would be as large as 10 5 M ࣻcomparable to the mass of the holes thought to reside in galactic nuclei.

        <p>We now review the large number of scenarios that have been proposed for PBH formation and the associated PBH mass functions. We have seen that PBHs generally have a mass of the order of the horizon mass at formation, so one might expect a monochromatic mass function (i.e., width M ∼ M). However, in some scenarios PBHs form over a prolonged period and therefore have an extended mass function (e.g., with its form of the mass function depending on the power spectrum of the primordial fluctuations). As discussed below, even PBHs formed at a single epoch may have an extended mass function.We now review the large number of scenarios that have been proposed for PBH formation and the associated PBH mass functions. We have seen that PBHs generally have a mass of the order of the horizon mass at formation, so one might expect a monochromatic mass function (i.e., width M ∼ M).

There are two known recent mechanisms for generating such spikes. The first has been proposed by Cai et al. (93), who discuss a new type of resonance effect that leads to prolific PBH formation. This effect arises because the sound-speed can oscillate in some inflationary scenarios, leading to parametric amplification of the curvature perturbation and hence a significant peak in the power spectrum of the density perturbations on some critical scale. The resonances are in narrow bands around certain harmonic frequencies with one of the peaks dominating. It turns out that one can easily get a peak of order unity. Although most PBHs form at the first peak, a small number will also form at subsequent peaks. The second mechanism for generating multispiked PBH mass spectra, as recently proposed by Carr &amp; Kühnel (94), has been demonstrated for most of the well-studied models of PBH formation. This mechanism relies on the choice of non-Bunch-Davies vacua, leading to oscillatory features in the inflationary power spectrum, which in turn generate oscillations in the PBH mass function with exponentially enhanced spikes.If PBHs are to explain phenomena on different mass scales, it is pertinent to consider the possibility that the PBH mass spectrum might have several spikes.

        <p>The effects of collisions of planetary-mass PBHs on astronomical objects have been a subject of long-standing interest, although we do not show these constraints in Figure 1 because they are controversial. Roncadelli et al. (118) have suggested that halo PBHs could be captured and swallowed by stars in the Galactic disc. The stars would eventually be accreted by the holes, producing radiation and a population of subsolar black holes that could only be of primordial origin, which would lead to a constraint of f &lt; (M/3 × 10 26 g) corresponding to a lower limit on the mass. Capela et al. have constrained PBH dark matter by considering the capture of PBHs by white dwarfs (119) or neutron stars (120), while Pani &amp; Loeb (121) argue that this approach excludes PBHs from providing the dark matter throughout the sublunar window. However, these limits have been disputed (122) because the dark matter density in globular clusters is now known to be much lower than assumed in these analyses (123). Graham et al. (124) argue that the transit of a PBH through a white dwarf causes localized heating through dynamical friction and initiates runaway thermonuclear fusion, causing the white dwarf to explode as a supernova. They claim that the shape of the observed white dwarf distribution excludes PBHs in the mass range of 10 19 -10 20 g from providing the dark matter and that those in the range of 10 20 -10 22 g are constrained by the observed supernova rate. However, these limits are inconsistent with hydrodynamical simulations by Montero-Camacho et al. (125), who conclude that this mass range is still allowed. Various dynamical constraints come into play at higher mass scales (126). Many of them involve the destruction of astronomical objects by the passage of nearby PBHs. If the PBHs have density ρ and velocity dispersion V, while the objects have mass M c , radius R c , velocity dispersion V c , and survival time t L , then the constraint has the following form:The effects of collisions of planetary-mass PBHs on astronomical objects have been a subject of long-standing interest, although we do not show these constraints in Figure 1 because they are controversial.

        <p>PBHs could have a large luminosity at early times because of the accretion of background gas, and this effect imposes strong constraints on their number density. However, the analysis of the problem is complicated because the black hole luminosity will generally boost the matter temperature of the background Universe well above the standard Friedmann value even if the PBH density is small, thereby reducing the accretion. Thus, there are two distinct but related PBH constraints: one associated with the effects on the Universe's thermal history and the other with the generation of background radiation. This problem was first studied in Reference 12, and we briefly review that analysis here. Even though this study was incomplete and later superseded by more detailed numerical investigations, we discuss it because it is the only analysis that applies for very large PBHs.

        <p>A special comment is required about window D (i.e., the mass range 10 14 &lt; M/M ࣻ &lt; 10 18 ) because this range has been almost completely neglected in previous literature. Obviously, such stupendously large black holes (which we term SLABs) could not provide the dark matter in galactic halos because they are too large to fit inside them (i.e., they violate the galactic incredulity limit). However, they might provide an intergalactic dark matter component, and the lack of constraints in this mass range may reflect the fact that nobody has considered this possibility. While this proposal might seem exotic, we know there are black holes with masses up to nearly 10 11 M ࣻ in galactic nuclei (175), so it is conceivable that SLABs could represent the high-mass tail of such a population. Although PBHs are unlikely to be this large at formation, we have shown in Section 3.4 that they might increase their mass enormously before galaxy formation through accretion, so they could certainly seed SLABs. This possibility has motivated the study of such objects in Reference 176, including an update of the accretion limit mentioned in Section 3.4 and a limit associated with WIMP annihilation, discussed below in Section 6.1. These limits are not shown in Figure 1, which is just a summary of previous literature.A special comment is required about window D (i.e., the mass range 10 14 &lt; M/M ࣻ &lt; 10 18 ) because this range has been almost completely neglected in previous literature.

        <p>The constraints shown in Figure 1 assume that the PBH mass function is quasimonochromatic (i.e., width M ∼ M). This assumption is unrealistic, and in most scenarios one would expect the mass function to be extended, possibly stretching over several decades of mass. A detailed assessment of this problem requires a knowledge of the expected PBH mass fraction, f exp (M), and the maximum fraction allowed by the monochromatic constraint, f max (M). However, one cannot just plot f exp (M) for a given model in Figure 1 and infer that the model is allowed because it does not intersect f max (M). This problem is quite challenging, and several different approaches have been suggested.The constraints shown in Figure 1 assume that the PBH mass function is quasimonochromatic (i.e., width M ∼ M).

        <p>Most of the PBH literature has focused on constraints on their contribution to the dark matter, as reviewed in Section 3.

In particular, Reference 54 summarizes seven current observational conundra that may be explained by PBHs. The first three are associated with lensing effects: (a) microlensing events toward the Galactic bulge generated by planetary-mass objects (111), which are much more frequent than expected for free-floating planets; (b) microlensing of quasars (178), including ones that are so misaligned with the lensing galaxy that the probability of lensing by a star is very low; and (c) the unexpectedly high number of microlensing events toward the Galactic bulge by dark objects in the mass gap between 2 and 5M ࣻ (179), in which stellar evolution models fail to form black holes (180). The next three are associated with accretion and dynamical effects: (d ) unexplained correlations in the source-subtracted Xray and cosmic infrared background fluctuations (181); (e) the nonobservation of UFDGs below the critical radius associated with dynamical disruption by PBHs (182); and ( f ) the unexplained correlation between the masses of galaxies and their central SMBHs.

        <p>It has long been appreciated that a key signature of PBHs would be the GWs generated by either their formation (161) (although these would be hard to detect because of redshift effects) or their coalescences if the PBHs formed binaries. Indeed, the detection of coalescing binary black holes was first discussed in Reference 31 in the context of Population III black holes and later in References 33 and 199 in the context of PBHs. However, the precise formation epoch of the black holes is not crucial because the coalescence occurs much later. In either case, the black holes would be expected to cluster inside galactic halos, and so the detection of the GWs would provide a probe of the halo distribution (200).It has long been appreciated that a key signature of PBHs would be the GWs generated by either their formation (161) (although these would be hard to detect because of redshift effects) or their coalescences if the PBHs formed binaries.

(34) claimed that the expected merger was compatible with the range of 9 to 240 Gpc -3 year -1 obtained by the LIGO analysis, and this claim has been supported by other studies (201,202). However, Sasaki et al. (35) have argued that the lower limit on the merger rate would be in tension with the CMB distortion constraints if the PBHs provided all the dark matter, although one might avoid these constraints if the LIGO/Virgo black holes derived from the accretion and merger of smaller PBHs (201). It should be noted that most of the observed coalesced black holes have effective spins compatible with zero. Although the statistical significance of this result is low (203), it goes against a stellar binary origin (204) but is a prediction of the PBH scenario (205).The suggestion that the dark matter could comprise PBHs has attracted much attention in recent years as a result of the LIGO/Virgo detections (157).

        <p>If the PBHs have an extended mass function, their density should peak at a lower mass than the coalescence signal.

Subsequent work (163,164) has studied the formation and disruption of PBH binaries in more detail, using both analytical and numerical calculations for a general mass function. If PBHs make up just 10% of the dark matter, the analytic estimates are reliable and indicate that the constraint from the observed LIGO/Virgo rate is strongest in the mass range 2-160M ࣻ , albeit weakened because of the suppression of mergers.

        <p>One of the mass ranges in which PBHs could provide the dark matter is around 10 -12 M ࣻ . If these PBHs are generated by enhanced scalar perturbations produced during inflation, their formation is inevitably accompanied by the generation of non-Gaussian GWs at frequencies that peak in the mHz range (the maximum sensitivity of LISA). Bartolo et al. (207) have studied whether LISA will be able to detect not only the GW power spectrum but also the non-Gaussian threepoint GW correlator (i.e., the bispectrum). However, they conclude that the inclusion of propagation effects suppresses the bispectrum.

        <p>Silk (183) has argued that intermediate-mass PBHs, which are mostly passive today but were active in their gas-rich past, could be ubiquitous in early dwarf galaxies. This scenario would be allowed by current AGN observations (209), and early feedback from intermediate-mass PBHs could provide a unified explanation for many dwarf galaxy anomalies. Besides providing a phase of early galaxy formation and seeds for SMBHs at high z (discussed above), they could (a) suppress the number of luminous dwarfs, (b) generate cores in dwarfs by dynamical heating, (c) resolve the too-big-to-fail problem, (d ) create bulgeless disks, (e) form UFDGs and ultradiffuse galaxies, ( f ) reduce the baryon fraction in Milky Way-type galaxies, (g) explain ultraluminous X-ray sources in the outskirts of galaxies, and (h) trigger star formation in dwarfs via AGN. As we discuss in Section 5.1, intermediate-mass PBH production could be naturally triggered by the thermal history of the Universe (54). This would lead to other observational signatures: The intermediatemass PBHs would generate extreme-mass-ratio inspiral merger events detectable by LISA; they would tidally disrupt white dwarfs much more rapidly than main-sequence stars, leading to luminous flares and short-timescale nuclear transients (210); and they would induce microlensing of extended radio sources (211).Silk (183) has argued that intermediate-mass PBHs, which are mostly passive today but were active in their gas-rich past, could be ubiquitous in early dwarf galaxies.

        <p>In this section, we describe a particular scenario in which PBHs naturally form with an extended mass function and provide a unified explanation of some of the conundra discussed above. The scenario is discussed in detail in Reference 54 and is based on the idea that the thermal history of the Universe leads to dips in the sound-speed and therefore enhanced PBH formation at scales corresponding to the electroweak phase transition (10 -6 M ࣻ ), the QCD phase transition (1M ࣻ ), the pion plateau (10M ࣻ ), and e + e -annihilation (10 6 M ࣻ ). This scenario requires most of the dark matter to be in PBHs formed at the QCD peak and is marginally consistent with the constraints discussed in Section 3, even though the discussion in that section suggests that the QCD window cannot provide all the dark matter for a monochromatic PBH mass function.In this section, we describe a particular scenario in which PBHs naturally form with an extended mass function and provide a unified explanation of some of the conundra discussed above.

        <p>Reheating at the end of inflation fills the Universe with radiation. In the Standard Model, the Universe remains dominated by relativistic particles with an energy density that decreases as the fourth power of the temperature. As time increases, the number of relativistic degrees of freedom remains constant until around 200 GeV, at which point the temperature of the Universe falls to the mass thresholds of the Standard Model particles. The first particle to become nonrelativistic is the top quark at 172 GeV, followed by the Higgs boson at 125 GeV, the Z boson at 92 GeV, and the W boson at 81 GeV. At the QCD transition at around 200 MeV, protons, neutrons, and pions condense out of the free light quarks and gluons. A little later, the pions become nonrelativistic and then the muons do, with e + e -annihilation and neutrino decoupling occurring at around 1 MeV. Whenever the number of relativistic degrees of freedom suddenly drops, it changes the effective equation-of-state parameter w. As shown in Figure 3, there are four periods in the thermal history of the Universe when w decreases. After each of these, w resumes its relativistic value of 1/3, but because the threshold δ c is sensitive to the equation-of-state parameter w(T ), the sudden drop modifies the probability of gravitational collapse of any large curvature fluctuations.

        <p>The origin of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) and the nature of dark matter are two of the most challenging problems in cosmology. The usual assumption is that high-energy physics generates the baryon asymmetry everywhere simultaneously via out-of-equilibrium particle decays or a first-order phase transition at very early times. García-Bellido et al. (214) propose a scenario in which the gravitational collapse of large inhomogeneities at the QCD epoch (invoked above) can resolve both of these problems. The collapse to a PBH is induced by fluctuations of a light spectator scalar field and accompanied by the violent expulsion of surrounding material, which might be regarded as a sort of primordial supernova. This process provides the ingredients for efficient baryogenesis around the collapsing regions (the baryons subsequently propagate to the rest of the Universe) and naturally explains why the observed BAU is of the order of the PBH collapse fraction (as required by Equation 7) and why the baryons and dark matter have comparable densities.The origin of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) and the nature of dark matter are two of the most challenging problems in cosmology.

        <p>We now discuss this proposal in more detail. The gravitational collapse of the mass within the QCD Hubble horizon can be extremely violent (40). Particles are driven out as a relativistically expanding shock wave and acquire energies a thousand times their rest mass from the gravitational potential energy released by the collapse. Such high-density hot spots provide the out-ofequilibrium conditions required to generate a baryon asymmetry (216) through the well-known electroweak sphaleron transitions responsible for Higgs windings around the electroweak vacuum (217). In this process, the charge parity (CP) symmetry violation of the Standard Model suffices to generate a local baryon-to-photon ratio of order one. The hot spots are separated by many horizon scales, but the outgoing baryons propagate away from the hot spots at the speed of light and become homogeneously distributed well before BBN. The large initial local baryon asymmetry is thus diluted to the tiny observed global BAU.We now discuss this proposal in more detail.

        <p>The energy acquired per proton in the expanding shell is E 0 = K/(n p V), where V = (1 -γ 3 ) V H is the difference between the Hubble and PBH volumes, so E 0 scales as (γ + γ 2 + γ 3 ) -1 . For a PBH formed at T ≈ QCD ≈ 140 MeV, the effective temperature is T eff = 2 E 0 /3 ≈ 5 TeV, which is well above the sphaleron barrier and induces a CP violation parameter δ CP (T) ∼ 10 -5 (T /20 GeV) -12 (218). The production of baryons can be very efficient, giving n B n γ or η 1 locally. The scenario is depicted qualitatively in Figure 6. This proposal naturally links the PBH abundance to the baryon abundance and the BAU to the PBH collapse fraction (η ∼ β). The spectator field mechanism for producing the required curvature fluctuations also avoids the need for a fine-tuned peak in the power spectrum, which has long been considered a major drawback of PBH scenarios. One still needs fine-tuning of the mean field value to produce the observed values of η and β (i.e., ∼10 -9 ). However, the stochasticity of the field during inflation ensures that Hubble volumes exist with all possible field values, and thus one can explain the fine-tuning by invoking a single anthropic selection argument. The argument, which is discussed in Reference 47, depends on the fact that only a small fraction of patches will have the PBH and baryon abundance required for galaxies to form. In most patches, the field is too far from the slow-roll region to produce either PBHs or baryons; as a result, radiation universes without any dark matter or matter-antimatter asymmetry are formed. In other (much rarer) patches, PBHs are produced too copiously, leading to rapid accretion of most of the baryons, as might have happened in UFDGs.

        <p>Presumably, most particle physicists would prefer that the dark matter be made up of elementary particles rather than PBHs, although there is still no direct evidence for this. However, even if the preferred scenario transpires to be the case, PBHs could still play an important cosmological role, so we must distinguish between a scenario in which PBHs provide some dark matter and one in which they provide all of it. This issue also applies for the particle candidates. Nobody would now argue that neutrinos provide the dark matter, but they still play a hugely important role in astrophysics. Therefore, one should not necessarily regard PBHs and particles as rival candidates. Both could exist, and we end this review by discussing two scenarios in this spirit. The first assumes that particles dominate the dark matter but that PBHs still provide an interesting interaction with them. The second involves the notion that evaporating black holes leave stable Planck-mass (or even sub-Planck-mass) relics, although such relics are in some sense more like particles than black holes.Presumably, most particle physicists would prefer that the dark matter be made up of elementary particles rather than PBHs, although there is still no direct evidence for this.

        <p>If most of the dark matter is in the form of elementary particles, these will be accreted around any small admixture of PBHs. In the case of WIMPs, this accretion can even happen during the radiation-dominated era; as Eroshenko (219) has shown, a low-velocity subset will accumulate around PBHs as density spikes shortly after the WIMPs kinetically decouple from the background plasma. Their annihilation will give rise to bright γ -ray sources, and comparison of the expected signal with Fermi-LAT data then severely constrains PBH for M &gt; 10 -8 M ࣻ . These constraints are several orders of magnitude more stringent than other constraints if one assumes a WIMP mass of m χ ∼ O(100) GeV and the standard value of σ v F = 3 × 10 -26 cm s -1 for the velocity-averaged annihilation cross-section. Boucenna et al. (220) have investigated this scenario for a larger range of values for σ v and m χ and reached similar conclusions.If most of the dark matter is in the form of elementary particles, these will be accreted around any small admixture of PBHs.

        <p>Apart from the early formation of spikes around PBHs that are light enough to arise very early, WIMP accretion around heavier PBHs can also occur by secondary infall (221). This process leads to a different halo profile, which yields a constraint of f PBH O(10 -9 ) for the same values of σ v and m χ . While Adamek et al. (222) have derived this limit for solar-mass PBHs, the argument can be extended to much bigger masses, even up to the values associated with SLABs (176). The constraint at intermediate M comes from the integrated effect of a population of such objects and is flat: where Fermi 100 MeV = 6 × 10 -9 cm -2 s -1 is the Fermi point-source sensitivity above the threshold energy E th = 100 MeV, t 0 is the age of the Universe, and ρ eq = 2.1 × 10 -19 g cm -3 is the density at t eq .

The optical depth τ E is the result of processes such as photon-matter pair production, photon-photon scattering, and photon-photon pair production (223). The limit shown by Equation 55 is derived in Reference 176 using the numerical packages from Reference 224 to obtain the optical depth and spectrum of by-products from WIMP annihilations.Apart from the early formation of spikes around PBHs that are light enough to arise very early, WIMP accretion around heavier PBHs can also occur by secondary infall (221). This process leads to a different halo profile, which yields a constraint of f PBH O(10 -9 ) for the same values of σ v and m χ . While Adamek et al. (222) have derived this limit for solar-mass PBHs, the argument can be extended to much bigger masses, even up to the values associated with SLABs (176). The constraint at intermediate M comes from the integrated effect of a population of such objects and is flat: where Fermi 100 MeV = 6 × 10 -9 cm -2 s -1 is the Fermi point-source sensitivity above the threshold energy E th = 100 MeV, t 0 is the age of the Universe, and ρ eq = 2.1 × 10 -19 g cm -3 is the density at t eq .

        <p>Figure 7 shows constraints on f PBH for WIMP masses of 10 GeV, 100 GeV, and 1 TeV. The falling part at low M is associated with halos formed after dark matter kinetic decoupling (when the kinetic energy of the WIMPs is important); the flat part is associated with halos formed by secondary infall at later times (when the kinetic energy can be neglected).

        <p>If PBH evaporations leave stable Planck-mass relics, these might also contribute to the dark matter.

        <p>One would then require the density to be less than CDM ≈ 0.26, which strengthens the original limit by a factor of four. The lower mass limit arises because PBHs generated before reheating are diluted exponentially. The upper mass limit arises because PBHs larger than this dominate the total density before they evaporate, in which case the final cosmological baryon-to-photon ratio is determined by the baryon asymmetry associated with their emission. The limit from Equation 58still applies even if there is no inflationary period, but in that case it extends all the way down to the Planck mass.One would then require the density to be less than CDM ≈ 0.26, which strengthens the original limit by a factor of four.

        <p>It is usually assumed that such relics would be undetectable apart from their gravitational effects. However, Lehmann et al. (230) have recently pointed out that these relics may carry electric charge, which would make them visible to terrestrial detectors. Lehmann et al. evaluate constraints and detection prospects and show that this scenario, if not already ruled out by monopole searches, can be explored within the next decade with planned experiments.It is usually assumed that such relics would be undetectable apart from their gravitational effects.

        <p>In some scenarios, PBHs could leave stable relics whose masses are very different from the Planck mass. For example, if one maintains the Schwarzschild expression but adopts the Generalized Uncertainty Principle, in which x ∼ 1/ p + α p, then evaporation stops at a mass of √ α M Pl (231). However, if one adopts the Black Hole Uncertainty Principle correspondence (232), in which one has a unified expression for the Schwarzschild and Compton scales, R CS = 2 GM + β M 2 Pl /M, then the mass can fall into the sub-Planckian regime in which T ∝ M. In this case, evaporation stops when the black hole becomes cooler than the CMB at M ∼ 10 -36 g (233). One motivation for this correspondence is Dvali &amp; Gomez's framework (234) for black holes as graviton Bose-Einstein condensates. Kühnel &amp; Sandstad (235) have studied PBH formation in this context and argue that evaporation may stop because the gravitons are quantum-depleted much faster than the baryons or leptons, which are caught in the black hole condensate. So, at some point, the balance of the strong and gravitational forces leads to stable relics. Recently, Dvali et al. (236) have shown that the decay of a black hole is substantially suppressed because of its high capacity for memory storage, which also leads to extremely long-lived or even stable relics.In some scenarios, PBHs could leave stable relics whose masses are very different from the Planck mass.

        <p>While the study of PBHs has been a niche interest for most of the last 50 years, they have become the focus of increasing attention recently. This is strikingly reflected in the publication rate on the topic, which has now risen to several hundred publications per year. While the evidence for PBHs is far from conclusive, there is a growing appreciation of their many potential roles in cosmology and astrophysics, which is why we have stressed the possible evidence for PBHs in this review rather than just the constraints.While the study of PBHs has been a niche interest for most of the last 50 years, they have become the focus of increasing attention recently.

        <p>PBHs have been invoked for three main purposes: (a) to explain the dark matter, (b) to generate the observed LIGO/Virgo coalescences, and (c) to provide seeds for the SMBHs in galactic nuclei. The discussion in Section 5 suggests that they could explain several other observational conundra and also alleviate some of the well-known problems of the CDM scenario. Thus, PBHs could play an important cosmological role even if most of the dark matter transpires to be elementary particles.PBHs have been invoked for three main purposes: (a) to explain the dark matter, (b) to generate the observed LIGO/Virgo coalescences, and (c) to provide seeds for the SMBHs in galactic nuclei.

        <p>Regarding the first of these main purposes, there are only a few mass ranges in which PBHs could provide the dark matter. We have focused on the intermediate mass range of 10M ࣻ &lt; M &lt; 10 2 M ࣻ because this may be relevant to the second main purpose, but the sublunar range 10 20 -10 24 g and the asteroid range 10 16 -10 17 g have also been suggested. If the PBHs have a monochromatic mass function, the discussion in Section 3 suggests that only the lowest mass range is viable. However, the discussion in Section 5 indicates that this conclusion may not apply if the PBHs have an extended mass function.Regarding the first of these main purposes, there are only a few mass ranges in which PBHs could provide the dark matter.

        <p>Regarding the second main purpose, while the possibility that the LIGO/Virgo sources could be PBHs is acknowledged by the GW community, this is not the mainstream view. It is therefore important to stress that the next LIGO/Virgo runs should be able to test and possibly eliminate the PBH proposal. Indeed, the two recent events GW190425 and GW190814 (237) fall precisely within regions 4 and 5 of Figure 5, while a third event, GW190521 (238), falls within region 2. In any case, this scenario would not require the PBHs to provide all the dark matter. If the PBHs have an extended mass function, the mass at which the density peaks would be less than the mass that dominates the GW signal.Regarding the second main purpose, while the possibility that the LIGO/Virgo sources could be PBHs is acknowledged by the GW community, this is not the mainstream view.

        <p>Regarding the third main purpose, there is no reason in principle why the maximum mass of a PBH should not be in the supermassive range, in which case it is almost inevitable that PBHs could seed SMBHs and perhaps even galaxies themselves. The main issue is whether there are enough PBHs to do so, but this would only require them to have a very low cosmological density. While the mainstream assumption is that galaxies form first, with the SMBHs forming in their nuclei through dynamical processes, this scenario is not fully understood. A crucial question concerns the growth of such large black holes, and this question applies whether or not they are primordial.Regarding the third main purpose, there is no reason in principle why the maximum mass of a PBH should not be in the supermassive range, in which case it is almost inevitable that PBHs could seed SMBHs and perhaps even galaxies themselves.

        <p>Section 5 has described a scenario in which PBHs form with a bumpy mass function as a result of naturally occurring dips in the sound-speed at various cosmological epochs, this naturally explaining many cosmological conundra. This scenario also suggests that the cosmological baryon asymmetry may be generated by PBH formation at the QCD epoch, thus naturally explaining the fine-tuning in the collapse fraction. This is not the mainstream view for the origin of the baryon asymmetry, and the proposal requires further investigation, but this is a first attempt to address the much-neglected PBH fine-tuning problem. The possibility that evaporating PBHs might leave stable relics opens up some of the mass range below 10 15 g as a new world of compact dark matter candidates waiting to be explored.Section 5 has described a scenario in which PBHs form with a bumpy mass function as a result of naturally occurring dips in the sound-speed at various cosmological epochs, this naturally explaining many cosmological conundra.
