        <p>We investigate the sensitivity of future lepton colliders to displaced vertices from the decays of long-lived heavy (almost sterile) neutrinos with electroweak scale masses and detectable time of flight. As future lepton colliders we consider the FCC-ee, the CEPC, and the ILC, searching at the Z-pole and at the center-of-mass energies of 240, 350 and 500 GeV. For a realistic discussion of the detector response to the displaced vertex signal and the Standard Model background we consider the ILC's Silicon Detector (SiD) as benchmark for the future lepton collider detectors. We find that displaced vertices constitute a powerful search channel for sterile neutrinos, sensitive to squared active-sterile mixing angles as small as 10 -11 .We investigate the sensitivity of future lepton colliders to displaced vertices from the decays of long-lived heavy (almost sterile) neutrinos with electroweak scale masses and detectable time of flight.

        <p>An efficient and elegant extension of the Standard Model (SM), that aims at generating the light neutrinos' masses, is given by adding sterile ("right-handed") neutrinos to its field content (see e.g. ref. [3] and references therein). The sterile neutrinos can have a socalled Majorana mass as well as Yukawa couplings to the three active neutrinos and to the Higgs doublet. When the electroweak symmetry is broken, the sterile and active neutrinos mix, which yields light and heavy mass eigenstates that are each subject to a number of experimental constraints.An efficient and elegant extension of the Standard Model (SM), that aims at generating the light neutrinos' masses, is given by adding sterile ("right-handed") neutrinos to its field content (see e.g. ref.

        <p>The naïve one-family type I seesaw relation, given by m ν ≈ y 2 v 2 EW /M , imposes either tiny neutrino Yukawa couplings y (for Majorana masses M on the electroweak scale), or Majorana masses around the Grand Unification scale (for Yukawa couplings of order one), such that an observation of this kind of heavy neutrino at colliders is not very promising. This relation does not hold for seesaw scenarios with two or more sterile neutrinos with a protective symmetry, e.g. a "lepton-number-like" symmetry. In those scenarios, no constraints on the neutrino Yukawa couplings and the Majorana masses arise from the light neutrinos' mass scale (see e.g. refs. [4][5][6][7][8][9]). In this case the Yukawa couplings (or, alternatively, the active-sterile mixing angles) are theoretically unsuppressed, which in principle JHEP12(2016)007 allows for effects to be searched for at particle colliders. A very interesting effect arises from heavy neutrinos with masses below the W boson mass and with very small mixings. Such heavy neutrinos have suppressed couplings to the W and Z as well as to the Higgs boson h, which leads to a long enough lifetime for a potentially visible displacement from the interaction point. Via virtual W, Z and h they decay into the kinematically available SM particles. This effect of a secondary vertex from the decays of the heavy neutrino, that is displaced from the primary vertex, yields an exotic signature and constitutes a powerful search channel for heavy neutrinos at particle colliders.

At the Z-pole, the production of heavy neutrinos via the s-channel Z boson is dominant, which is sensitive to all neutrino Yukawa couplings |y να | ( α = e, µ, τ ). However, for larger center-of-mass energies, the dominant contribution to the production cross section of the heavy neutrinos comes from the tchannel exchange of a W boson, which is only sensitive to |y νe |.

        <p>To assess the expected signal efficiencies we simulated 10 6 events of semileptonic decays for M = 10 and 40 GeV, respectively. The fast reconstruction with DSiD2 yields a signal efficiency of ∼ 80% to find at least one jet for M = 10 GeV.

        <p>We define the inner region as the volume that is enclosed by the vertex detector. The vertex displacement x can generally be inferred from the tracks of the decay products in the vertex detector and the tracker. The precision of x is limited by the resolution of the tracker and the spatial extension of the Interaction point (IP). At the ILC the IP has a vertical extension of ∼ 10 nm and we assume a vertical extension of ∼ 250 nm for the circular FCC-ee and CEPC for all the modi operandi. The impact parameter resolution of the SiD in the transverse plane is ∼ 2 µm. We note that due to our assumption of a spherical detector geometry, this parameter is also valid in the longitudinal direction. We therefore consider the resolution for displaced vertices x res , i.e. the minimum vertex displacement that is separable at 3σ from the IP, to be given by 6 µm for the ILC and 7 µm for the FCC-ee/CEPC. We remark that this resolution is strictly valid for vertical displacements only. We note that for an accurate assessment of the resolution the entire geometry of the detector and of the IP have to be taken into account, which, however, is beyond the scope of this paper.We define the inner region as the volume that is enclosed by the vertex detector.

        <p>The vertex detector is designed to detect the displaced vertices of heavy flavours for their efficient identification. The highly efficient charged particle tracking allows to recognise and measure prompt tracks in conjunction with the ECAL. The vertex displacement can be inferred from the impact parameter of the reconstructed tracks. We note at this point, that the resolution of the impact parameter degrades at the SiD when the heavy neutrino decays take place deep inside the tracker. In this case not all the silicon layers would respond to the tracks from the secondary vertex, which would reduce the resulting impact parameter resolution. Because we expect all the future lepton colliders to have at least one detector with continuous tracking, which has a larger number of layers and thus might experience less degradation of the resolution, we ignore this effect in the following.The vertex detector is designed to detect the displaced vertices of heavy flavours for their efficient identification.

The horizontal lines in the figure denote the number of heavy neutrino decays that are to be expected, which scale with |θ| 2 and are proportional to the cross sections (here taken to be flat) shown in figure 2. The vertical dashed line denotes the W boson mass and indicates the limit of this search channel. In general, the heavy neutrino mass has to be smaller than the center-of-mass energy of the incident electronpositron beams. However, for M ∼ m W new decay channels for the heavy neutrinos into on-shell W and Z bosons open up, which renders their lifetimes generally too short to allow for a measurable vertex displacement.</p>
        <p>For the combined response of the SiD components, see the discussion above in sections 4.2.1 to 4.2.4, we find: the search for long-lived heavy neutrinos via displaced vertices is sensitive to displacements as small as x res , but only for displacements larger than 10 µm the search is essentially free of irreducible background. As discussed the detector components are (almost) background-free with the exception of the ECAL. Furthermore, it is unclear if heavy neutrino decays that occur close to the outer radius of the muon identification system are registered. Since the mapping of the physical extensions of the ECAL and the muon identification system into the heavy neutrino parameter space shows a considerable overlap 4 with the tracker and the HCAL, we therefore consider vertex displacements between 10 µm and 249 cm (i.e. within the outer radius of the HCAL) as conservative bounds for signal events to be free of background and in principle detectable by the SiD. Notice that for M ≤ m W the heavy neutrino has a relativistic velocity β 0.1, such that it decays in the calorimetric system within ∼ 30 ns after the interaction, which may be important when a trigger is used at circular colliders.For the combined response of the SiD components, see the discussion above in sections 4.2.1 to 4.2.4, we find: the search for long-lived heavy neutrinos via displaced vertices is sensitive to displacements as small as x res , but only for displacements larger than 10 µm the search is essentially free of irreducible background.

        <p>We remark that it is very important to include the muon identification system as an independent search for displaced vertices from heavy neutrino decays at future lepton colliders, which may provide independent and complementary information.We remark that it is very important to include the muon identification system as an independent search for displaced vertices from heavy neutrino decays at future lepton colliders, which may provide independent and complementary information.</p>

        <p>According to the discussion in section 4.2, we take the heavy neutrino decays with a vertex displacement between 10 µm and 249 cm to be free of background and detectable by the SiD. The absence of SM background implies that the detection of a single event corresponds to the detection of a heavy neutrino signal via displaced vertices with a significance of 1σ, cf. eq. (4.2). In the following, we demand at least four signal events in order to establish a signal at 2σ. The SiD is used as benchmark detector for all the lepton collider experiments, for which we found heavy neutrino signals with vertex displacements between 10 µm and 249 cm to be essentially free of irreducible background, cf. section 4.2.

        <p>We show the resulting sensitivities of the FCC-ee, the CEPC and the ILC, respectively, to the searches for heavy neutrinos via displaced vertices in figure 8. Parameter sets of masses and active-sterile mixings inside the colored areas lead to at least four events inside the SiD. The overall shape of the colored areas can be understood from the schematic illustration in figure 7. We checked that including the muon identification system does not significantly affect the resulting sensitivities for any of the here considered future lepton colliders and their modi operandi. For comparison we show estimates for the future sensitivity of the conventional searches at 95% confidence level by the black, dashed line [23]. This estimate was obtained by a rescaling of the 95% C.L. exclusion limit from DELPHI with the Z pole luminosities of the respective future lepton collider.We show the resulting sensitivities of the FCC-ee, the CEPC and the ILC, respectively, to the searches for heavy neutrinos via displaced vertices in figure 8.

        <p>The left-hand plot in figure 8 shows that the Z pole run of the FCC-ee yields the highest sensitivity due to the large envisaged integrated luminosity. This run is sensitive to smaller active-sterile neutrino mixing compared to the estimates for the conventional searches. The physics runs at higher center-of-mass energies show weaker sensitivities when compared to the Z pole run, but they still improve the projected sensitivity of the LHC, which reaches |θ| 2 ∼ 10 -7 for heavy neutrino masses ∼ 20 GeV, cf. refs.

        <p>At the CEPC, the considered modi operandi result in the sensitivities for the Higgs run at 250 GeV and the Z pole run to be comparable, with the former being sensitive to larger heavy neutrino masses. It is interesting to note that, despite the heavy neutrino production cross sections being more than one order of magnitude smaller compared to the Z pole run (see figure 2), also the Higgs run constitutes a feasible search channel for sterile neutrinos via displaced vertex searches due to the considered integrated luminosities. We remark that the here shown sensitivities for √ s = m Z are strictly valid only for θ µ , θ τ = 0 and |θ| 2 = |θ e | 2 .At the CEPC, the considered modi operandi result in the sensitivities for the Higgs run at 250 GeV and the Z pole run to be comparable, with the former being sensitive to larger heavy neutrino masses.

        <p>The sensitivities for the ILC show that the high-energy run at 500 GeV has a much higher sensitivity compared to the Z pole searches, which is, in analogy to the CEPC, due to the considered integrated luminosities. Comparing the Higgs run of the CEPC with the 500 GeV run at the ILC, which both consider the same integrated luminosity, we find that the ILC outperforms the CEPC, due to the larger heavy-neutrino-production cross section with beam polarisation. On the other hand, a significant enhancement of the sensitivities of the CEPC and the ILC at the Z pole run could be achieved when the run times are prolonged.The sensitivities for the ILC show that the high-energy run at 500 GeV has a much higher sensitivity compared to the Z pole searches, which is, in analogy to the CEPC, due to the considered integrated luminosities.

        <p>We deepened and extended previous work on displaced vertex searches for sterile neutrinos at future lepton colliders in various ways: we considered an explicit low scale seesaw benchmark model, the SPSS, and calculated the heavy-neutrino-production cross section with WHIZARD, including initial state radiation and initial state polarisation (where applicable). 5 As future lepton colliders, we considered the FCC-ee, CEPC, and the ILC and included the different center-of-mass energies planned for the respective physics programs, i.e. the Z pole run, the Higgs run at 240 or 250 GeV, the top threshold scan at 350 GeV and, for the ILC, also 500 GeV. For a realistic assessment of the sensitivity, we used the ILC's SiD as benchmark detector and put emphasis on its response to the displaced heavy neutrino signal and the conceivable SM backgrounds. We find that the SiD is sensitive to the signal in an essentially background-free environment (after suitable cuts), for vertex displacements ranging from 10 µm to the outer radius of the HCAL. We expect that removing the backgrounds (cf. section 4.2) with suitable cuts will somewhat reduce the signal efficiency. For instance the DELPHI experiment at LEP quotes a signal efficiency of ∼ 25%, which would roughly speaking shift up the maximal sensitivity by a factor of two. However, the efficiency may be higher at a future detector, closer to the here assumed 100% signal efficiency. We note that for assessing a more realistic number for the signal efficiency, and also for a better understanding of the response and complementarity of the ECAL, HCAL and muon identification system to the heavy neutrino decays within the respective component, a full simulation of the detector acceptance would be desirable.We deepened and extended previous work on displaced vertex searches for sterile neutrinos at future lepton colliders in various ways: we considered an explicit low scale seesaw benchmark model, the SPSS, and calculated the heavy-neutrino-production cross section with WHIZARD, including initial state radiation and initial state polarisation (where applicable). 5 As future lepton colliders, we considered the FCC-ee, CEPC, and the ILC and included the different center-of-mass energies planned for the respective physics programs, i.e. the Z pole run, the Higgs run at 240 or 250 GeV, the top threshold scan at 350 GeV and, for the ILC, also 500 GeV.

        <p>The resulting sensitivities of sterile neutrino searches via displaced vertices at future lepton colliders are summarized in figure 8, for a confidence level of 2σ. We find that the FCC-ee at the Z pole run with 110 ab -1 yields the best sensitivity, down to squared activesterile mixings as small as |θ| 2 ∼ 10 -11 . Comparing this estimated sensitivity to the one for a conventional search for sterile neutrinos at the Z pole, the displaced vertex search is sensitive to significantly smaller active-sterile mixing angles. It turns out that the centerof-mass energies higher than the Z boson mass can already improve the present exclusion limits of the LHC and its projected sensitivities of |θ| 2 ∼ 10 -7 for 300 fb -1 . For the CEPC, JHEP12(2016)007 the Z pole run and the higher energy run (at 250 GeV) result in comparable sensitivities, while for the ILC the high-energy run (at 500 GeV in the G-20 physics program) results in its best sensitivity.The resulting sensitivities of sterile neutrino searches via displaced vertices at future lepton colliders are summarized in figure 8, for a confidence level of 2σ.

        <p>In summary, our analysis demonstrates that all the modi operandi of all the future lepton colliders can improve the present bounds and the projected LHC reach. Highest sensitivities to sterile neutrinos can be reached in the mass range between ∼ 10 and 80 GeV. This is complementary to the experiments like SHiP [68], which has peak sensitivities at lower masses, around 1 GeV. We thus conclude that the search for displaced vertices at future lepton colliders constitutes a powerful search channel for heavy neutrinos with masses below the W boson mass.In summary, our analysis demonstrates that all the modi operandi of all the future lepton colliders can improve the present bounds and the projected LHC reach.
