        <p>We use data from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey in the redshift range 0.01&lt;z&lt;0.1 (8399 galaxies in g to K s bands) to derive the stellar mass -halflight radius relations for various divisions of 'early' and 'late'-type samples. We find the choice of division between early and late (i.e., colour, shape, morphology) is not particularly critical, however, the adopted mass limits and sample selections (i.e., the careful rejection of outliers and use of robust fitting methods) are important. In particular we note that for samples extending to low stellar mass limits (&lt; 10 10 M ) the Sérsic index bimodality, evident for high mass systems, becomes less distinct and no-longer acts as a reliable separator of early-and late-type systems. The final set of stellar mass -half-light radius relations are reported for a variety of galaxy population subsets in 10 bands (ugrizZY JHK s ) and are intended to provide a comprehensive low-z benchmark for the many ongoing high-z studies. Exploring the variation of the stellar mass -half-light radius relations with wavelength we confirm earlier findings that galaxies appear more compact at longer wavelengths albeit at a smaller level than previously noted: at 10 10 M both spiral systems and ellipticals show a decrease in size of 13% from g to K s (which is near linear in log wavelength). Finally we note that the sizes used in this work are derived from 2D Sérsic light profile fitting (using GALFIT3), i.e., elliptical semi-major half light radii, improving on earlier low-z benchmarks based on circular apertures.We use data from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey in the redshift range 0.01&lt;z&lt;0.1 (8399 galaxies in g to K s bands) to derive the stellar mass -halflight radius relations for various divisions of 'early' and 'late'-type samples.

        <p>Galaxies have long been known to exhibit a correlation between their mass (or luminosity) and their size (or surface brightness). For example, early studies of spiral galaxies in nearby groups and clusters identified a strong luminosity-surface brightness relation, such that more luminous systems also have higher surface brightness (see reviews by Ferguson &amp;Binggeli 1994 andGraham 2013). Fundamentally, this reflects the mean scaling of angular momentum with halo mass, which, in self-similar halos, is such that the disk surface density increases monotonically as M 1/3 halo (Fall &amp; Efstathiou 1980;Dalcanton et al. 1997;Mo et al. 1998;Obreschkow &amp; Glazebrook 2014). The close connection between size (or surface brightness) and angular momentum makes systematic size measurements in galaxy surveys an exquisite test of evolutionary models (Fall 1983;Romanowsky &amp; Fall 2012).Galaxies have long been known to exhibit a correlation between their mass (or luminosity) and their size (or surface brightness).

        <p>Over the past few decades, a number of notable observations have refined the empirical luminosity-surface brightness relation for distinct galaxy types (de Jong &amp; Lacey 2000; Graham &amp; Guzman 2003), environments (Cross et al. 2001;Andreon &amp; Cuillandre 2002;Driver et al. 2005;Cappellari 2013) and at specific redshifts (Driver 1999;La Barbera et al. 2003;Barden et al. 2005;Trujillo et al. 2004Trujillo et al. , 2006Trujillo et al. , 2007;;Trujillo et al. 2012).Over the past few decades, a number of notable observations have refined the empirical luminosity-surface brightness relation for distinct galaxy types (de Jong &amp; Lacey 2000; Graham &amp; Guzman 2003), environments (Cross et al. 2001;Andreon &amp; Cuillandre 2002;Driver et al. 2005;Cappellari 2013) and at specific redshifts (Driver 1999;La Barbera et al. 2003;Barden et al. 2005;Trujillo et al. 2004Trujillo et al. , 2006Trujillo et al. , 2007;;Trujillo et al. 2012).</p>
        <p>More recently, a growing number of authors choose to focus on the stellar mass -half-light radius relation (hereafter M * -Re relation, see e.g. Trujillo et al. 2004;Shen et al. 2003) instead of a luminosity-surface brightness relation. Albeit akin to one another, the former is arguably more meaningful as the luminosity-size relation depends on the observational wavelength band used and conversions are required to compare different data sets. However, detractors of the M * -Re relation may argue that this incorporates errors in the estimation of the stellar mass and that the inherent selection boundaries (mainly due to surface brightness selection effects, Disney 1976;Disney et al. 1995;Driver 1999) are less obvious in the M * -Re plane than in the luminosity-surface brightness plane (and often neglected altogether). For example, due to our inability to detect lower surface brightness sources at increasing redshifts only the more compact and most massive systems remain detectable, see e.g. Cameron &amp; Driver (2007) who show the impact of the selection boundaries using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Ultra Deep Field (UDF) data. Without due consideration of potential biases this becomes an important issue as differences between the high-and low-redshift M * -Re relations are readily attributed to physical evolution in galaxies.More recently, a growing number of authors choose to focus on the stellar mass -half-light radius relation (hereafter M * -Re relation, see e.g. Trujillo et al. 2004;Shen et al. 2003) instead of a luminosity-surface brightness relation.

        <p>A further, and more recent, concern is that the measured size of a galaxy also depends on the wavelength at which the observation has been made. This has been known for some time (e.g., Evans 1994;Cunow 2001; La Barbera et al. 2002), but quantified more robustly for red and/ or blue systems in La Barbera et al. (2010), Kelvin et al. (2012), Häussler et al. (2013) and Vulcani et al. (2014), who find a strong size-wavelength relation, such that galaxies are often measured to be as little as half the size in the K-band when compared with the r -band. This is as crucial as the prob-lems with the completeness discussed above. If one wishes to measure and compare the M * -Re relation from different datasets or from different epochs, care must be taken to define the relation at the same rest-wavelength or to apply a size bandpass correction (see Kelvin et al. 2012, figure 22). The cause of the size-wavelength trend (discussed in Kelvin et al. 2012;Vulcani et al. 2014) is not entirely clear, but is argued to arise from a combination of:A further, and more recent, concern is that the measured size of a galaxy also depends on the wavelength at which the observation has been made.

        <p>Over the past decade observations of the M * -Re relation, particularly of early-type massive systems, have been made across a broad range of epochs using the high resolution imaging of the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) or the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) onboard the HST. These measurements, initially only made for the most massive (&gt; 10 11 M ) systems, have been compared to the local SDSS relation measured by Shen et al. (2003) for both red and blue, concentrated and diffuse systems. The results to-date provide an intriguing yet consistent picture of significant size growth from z &gt; 1.5 to z=0.0 with minimal mass increase (e.g. Ferguson et al. 2004;Daddi et al. 2005;Longhetti et al. 2007;van Dokkum et al. 2008;Trujillo et al. 2006). These initial results have been corroborated by extensive studies which continue to identify a clear disconnect between the M * -Re relation of nearby galaxies and those at intermediate-to high-redshift (Trujillo et al. 2007;Buitrago et al. 2008;van der Wel et al. 2008;Damjanov et al. 2009;McIntosh et al. 2005;Williams et al. 2010;Bruce et al. 2012). The current data, mostly confined to massive early-type systems, seem to suggest that galaxies have grown by a factor of five in size since z∼2 with minimal change in mass. By contrast, the M * -Re evolution of disk systems is traced at lower redshift (z 1) and appears less dramatic, evolving by roughly a factor of 2 (see for example Barden et al. 2005;Sargent et al. 2007;Buitrago et al. 2008;van Dokkum et al. 2013). A number of physical and non-physical explanations have been put forward to explain the observed M * -Re evolution of the early-types. These include, for example, major and minor mergers or gas accretion and disc growth as physical effects, see e.g. Driver et al. (2013) and also Graham (2013) who suggest that the compact galaxies at high-z are the naked bulges of lower-z systems. Some evidence for this scenario is suggested by the compact massive bulges evident in nearby early-type galaxies seen by Dullo &amp; Graham (2013).

        <p>Finally it is important to note that the often used redshift zero M * -Re relation of Shen et al. (2003) measures sizes in the z -band and uses a Sérsic index cut to divide the galaxy sample into early-and late-types. We have already discussed the wavelength dependent size of galaxies, but another caveat is the definition of early-/latetype. Commonly colour, concentration (i.e. Sérsic index) or morphology are used interchangeably, but even though there is a correlation these definitions are not synonymous (Robotham et al. 2013), for example low-luminosity elliptical galaxies can have Sérsic indices of n&lt;2.5 (e.g. Graham &amp; Guzman 2003 and references therein). Hence, when comparing the local M * -Re relation to other data sets due consideration should be given to the necessary correction of the wavelength dependent sizes of galaxies and the method used to separate the sample into early-and late-type.Finally it is important to note that the often used redshift zero M * -Re relation of Shen et al.

Due to the similarity between the morphology-dependent mass-size relation and the fundamental mass-spin-morphology relation (Cappellari et al. 2011;Romanowsky &amp; Fall 2012;Obreschkow &amp; Glazebrook 2014), this work lays the foundations for approximate studies of angular momentum scalings in a large local sample with well-characterized completeness. We will expand this idea in sequel work. In addition, for comparison between different redshifts, we derive the M * -Re relation in a consistent manner for 10 imaging bands (ugrizZYJHKs).In this paper we provide a comprehensive recalibration of the local M * -Re relation, divided into early-and late-type galaxies, according to various criteria which include: Sérsic index, colour, a joint Sérsic index-colour cut and galaxy visual morphology.

        <p>To illustrate the difference introduced by analysing the M * -Re relation in different wave bands we have plotted the S03 M * -Re relation without any correction of the expected sizes (i.e. z -band sizes; black solid line, Fig. 3a) and with sizes corrected to reflect r -band sizes (black dot-dashed line, Fig. 3a). To correct the S03 M * -Re relation we use the wavelength dependent size relation for discs and spheroids found by Kelvin et al. (2012) to establish a ratio of the sizes between the r-and z -band of 1.075 for the late-types and 1.123 for the early-types sizes. We then multiply the sizes obtained for the S03 late-type relation by these ratios. The resulting shift moves the early-type S03 M * -Re relation further onto our galaxy distribution, however, it is steeper than our observed relation. For late types we still see an offset between the S03 M * -Re relation and our data.To illustrate the difference introduced by analysing the M * -Re relation in different wave bands we have plotted the S03 M * -Re relation without any correction of the expected sizes (i.e. z -band sizes; black solid line, Fig. 3a) and with sizes corrected to reflect r -band sizes (black dot-dashed line, Fig. 3a).

        <p>Fig. A4 (top panel) shows the direct comparison between the S03 and our M * -Re relation in the z -band. Even though the same waveband is compared here we still see an offset between the two relations. For the early-types this equates to S03 sizes being on average 1.1kpc smaller than our sizes at most galaxy masses but larger at M * 2 × 10 11 M . However, in this regime our M * -Re relation is not well constrained. For late-type galaxies we have a median size offset between S03 and our sizes of ∼0.9kpc. The main contributing factors to this discrepancy are likely to be our deeper data and the use of elliptical semi-major axis Re as opposed to circularised Re used in S03. The former causes the observed differences in the slope while the latter shifts our M * -Re relation to larger sizes. Using elliptical semi-major axis radii instead of circularised sizes also explains the larger size offset for late-type galaxies, which on average have a higher (observed) ellipticity than the early-type galaxies. Also note that for a fair comparison, the fits should only be considered in the mass range in which the S03 relation was established, these are log 10 (M * /M ) 8.8 for late-types and log 10 (M * /M ) 10.1 for early-types.Fig. A4 (top panel) shows the direct comparison between the S03 and our M * -Re relation in the z -band.

        <p>For the early-types, S03 found a single power law (Eq. 2) to be a good fit. In Fig. 3, if we consider the same mass range then the S03 M * -Re relation seemingly fits well onto our data. However, if we consider the entire mass range available we find that the two component power law (Eq. 3) is a better fit due to some flattening in the M * -Re distribution There is no clear bimodality visible in the distribution, i.e. there is no trough between the two populations.

A similar flattening was also observed for spheroids by e.g. Shankar et al. (2013) and Berg et al. (2014) and could be related to dissipation processes during (gas-rich) mergers. In fact, it has been known for some time that the elliptical M * -Re relation becomes flat for small galaxies, especially when considering dwarf ellipticals (see section 3.4.1 for more information). However, small elliptical galaxies (M &lt; 10 10 M ) have been found to also have smaller Sérsic indices (n&lt;2.5) (see e.g. Graham et al. 2006) and thus the flattening seen here is likely caused by cross-scattering of not-elliptical galaxies with higher Sérsic indices.

        <p>For the late-types, when considering the same massrange, our data shows a similar distribution (see Fig. 3) to S03, who found a two component power law to be a good fit to the data. However, we find that our data, at fixed mass, has larger sizes than the S03 relation, even after the correction for the wavelength dependent sizes (due to the use of circularized sizes in the S03 fit). In addition, the fit to Eq. 3 has a high 'transitioning mass' M0, of the order of a few 10 11 M , which lies beyond most galaxy in our sample (at least 99.5% of galaxies have masses below M0 in any band). Hence, over the mass range observed, the two component fit (Eq. 3) is driven to a single exponential fit with slope α in our MCMC fitting. In addition, fitting parameter α is, within the errors, not dissimilar to fitting parameter b from Eq. 2. This makes the fit to the two-component power law superfluous over the mass range observed here.For the late-types, when considering the same massrange, our data shows a similar distribution (see Fig. 3) to S03, who found a two component power law to be a good fit to the data.

        <p>As pointed out previously, the flattening observed in the early-type M * -Re relation in our Sérsic index divided sample might be due to the inclusion of galaxies that in reality belong to the morphologically classified late-type population. One possible cause of this is that a separation of the population at n=2.5 is a poor description of the actual distribution of the Sérsic indices in our sample. We expect a bimodality in the Sérsic index distribution with late-type galaxies tending to n=1 and early-type galaxies to n=4. To check this we plot the Sérsic index distribution in the top panel of Fig. 4. However, we see no clear separating Sérsic index between early-and late-type populations.As pointed out previously, the flattening observed in the early-type M * -Re relation in our Sérsic index divided sample might be due to the inclusion of galaxies that in reality belong to the morphologically classified late-type population.

        <p>Bimodalities are most evident when the two populations are seen in equal numbers. However, over the whole mass range probed in our sample we have more late-type than early-type galaxies especially at lower masses. In addition, elliptical galaxies tend to have lower Sérsic indices at lower masses ( M 10 10 M ). Hence, including these low-mass galaxies will skew the distribution of Sérsic indices towards smaller numbers making the bimodality less obvious. This can also be seen in the top panel of Fig. 2, which shows that galaxies with high Sérsic indices (n&gt;2.5) tend to have masses above 10 10 M and most galaxies with masses &lt; 10 9 M have Sérsic indices n&lt;2.5. The few galaxies that have low masses (∼ 10 10 M ) and high Sérsic indices (n&gt;2.5) are the 'cross-scatter' we see in the above M * -Re relation.Bimodalities are most evident when the two populations are seen in equal numbers.

This can also be seen in the top panel of Fig. 2, which shows that galaxies with high Sérsic indices (n&gt;2.5) tend to have masses above 10 10 M and most galaxies with masses &lt; 10 9 M have Sérsic indices n&lt;2.5. The few galaxies that have low masses (∼ 10 10 M ) and high Sérsic indices (n&gt;2.5) are the 'cross-scatter' we see in the above M * -Re relation.</p>
        <p>Fig. 5 shows the same data as Fig. 2, however, the data points are colour coded by the visual classification. The top panel shows that there is a lot of cross-scatter of morphological late-types (i.e. not-elliptical galaxies) into the highn region as well as morphological early-types (i.e. elliptical galaxies) into the low-n region.Fig. 5 shows the same data as Fig. 2, however, the data points are colour coded by the visual classification.

        <p>Since the dispersion around the mean for late-types is already large, including these cross-scattered galaxies in the late-type sample has little effect. However, including the cross-scattered galaxies in the early-type sample increases the dispersion and changes the M * -Re relation, especially at lower masses. Considering this we find that an alternative (but rigid) Sérsic index cut would not improve the M * -Re relation fits and we will concentrate on other pos-sible population separators which are discussed in the following sections.Since the dispersion around the mean for late-types is already large, including these cross-scattered galaxies in the late-type sample has little effect.

        <p>Comparing the M * -Re relations derived using a colour division to those derived by a Sérsic division we find a reduced number of galaxies at low masses (M * 10 9.4 M , as these galaxies have been moved into the late-type sample. However, these additions to the late-type sample lead to a slight steepening in the M * -Re relation for the single exponential fit and the transition mass 'M0' in the double power law fit is reduced to the order of several 10 10 M which is at the upper limit of our data. Overall the fit to Eq. 2 is a good approximation of the M * -Re relation for latetypes, especially in the lower mass range (when compared to the curved relation). The early-type M * -Re relations of both colour cuts continue to show some flattening for galaxies with M * 2 × 10 10 M and the double power-law fits remain largely unchanged compared to the Sérsic index early-types. However, for most bands we observe a steepening of the single power law fit to the data. This is largely due to the move of low-mass (M 10 9.4 M ) galaxies into the late-type sample. Overall the single power law is a good approximation of the data. However, due to the low-mass flattening of the M * -Re distribution the single power law fit is not steep enough to fit very massive galaxies (with M &gt; 10 11 M ) well and hence the double power law fit should be considered instead.Comparing the M * -Re relations derived using a colour division to those derived by a Sérsic division we find a reduced number of galaxies at low masses (M * 10 9.4 M , as these galaxies have been moved into the late-type sample.

        <p>A rigid cut by either colour or Sérsic index will never be a good representation for early-and late-type galaxy populations, especially since the early-/late-type classification itself is not rigid. Figures 2 and4 show that neither the Sérsic index nor the colour are definitive separators for the early-and late-type populations. The Sérsic index in particular does not show a clear bimodality and the colour distributions show a slightly sharper peak for the blue galaxies which plateaus and then transitions into the red galaxies. This is not surprising if we take into account that often early-types are associated with elliptical galaxies and late types with non-elliptical galaxies (Robotham et al. 2013), this will lead to a significant overlap of the populations if only colour or Sérsic index are considered as a true representation of the galaxy morphology. This point is discussed in detail by (Taylor et al. 2014) and can be seen in the r -band Sérsic index vs (u-r)rest colour plot (bottom panel of Fig. 2). The plot shows two populations, one in the blue colour and low Sérsic index region and the other in the red colour and high Sérsic index region. In the plot the data points are coloured according to their mass also showing that most early-types (i.e. high-n and red) are more massive than late-type (i.e. low-n and blue) galaxies. The contours show the data density and the blue dashed lines show the previously chosen separators for Sérsic index and colour.A rigid cut by either colour or Sérsic index will never be a good representation for early-and late-type galaxy populations, especially since the early-/late-type classification itself is not rigid.

        <p>The plot shows that choosing the (u-r )stars colour as a separator reduces the cross-contamination compared to the Sérsic index cut. But it is also clear that neither colour nor Sérsic index are ideal separators and a combined Sérsic index and colour cut should improve the separation of the early-and late-types. The solid black line in the bottom panel of Fig. 2 shows a separation of the two populations that depends on both the (u-r )stars colour and the Sérsic index. It is a 'best population division' line, with a slope that is orthogonal to the connecting line between the two population centres (marked by the crosses) and an intercept that is chosen in such a way that the bijective assignment to the (visually classified) morphological elliptical/ notelliptical classification (see section 3.4) is maximised, i.e. the probability of correctly assigning a galaxy as either earlyor late-type is maximised. The resulting division line splits the sample into 6748 late-type galaxies and 1651 early-type galaxies.

        <p>The resulting M * -Re relation is plotted in Fig. 3d. There are even less low-mass galaxies included in the earlytype population compared to previous cuts. This leads to a steepening of the fit to Eq. 2, whereas the fitting parameters to Eq. 3 continue to remain mostly unchanged. The fitting parameters to the single power law for the late-types also remain largely unchanged.

        <p>Comparing the fitting parameters for all the above discussed cases shows that they are quite robust to changes in the chosen population separator, that is if we consider Eq. 2 for late-types and Eq. 3 for early-types only. The more dominant changes come from the chosen sample, e.g. the mass range probed or circular vs semi-major axis radii. This becomes apparent when comparing our sample with the S03 relation. For example if we compare the single power law fit for the early-type galaxies in this section with the fit found by S03 we find that the slope is comparable due to the exclusion of many low-mass galaxies in this particular sample selection.Comparing the fitting parameters for all the above discussed cases shows that they are quite robust to changes in the chosen population separator, that is if we consider Eq. 2 for late-types and Eq. 3 for early-types only.

LBS are galaxies that look spheroidal (i.e. elliptical-like) but are blue in colour and typically small (median size ∼1.3kpc) and do not fit in well with either our elliptical or not-elliptical sample (see Kelvin et al. 2014 for initial identification of this sample in GAMA and Moffettt et. al in prep. for more details on the nature of these galaxies).We use the elliptical/not-elliptical visual classifications as defined by Driver et al.

The galaxies classified as ellipticals are shown in red, notelliptical in blue and the LBS are black. A significant cross scatter of the elliptical and not-elliptical galaxies can be seen in all plots. This means that around 30 to 40% of the galaxies classified as early-types using a rigid population separator are actually 'not-elliptical' galaxies according to their visual classification.Fig. 5 shows the population distribution in four different panels (as Fig. 1), from top to bottom these are: stellar mass vs Sérsic index, (u-r )stars colour vs stellar mass, (g-i)stars colour vs stellar mass and (u-r )stars colour vs Sérsic index.

        <p>However, even though the size of the cross-scatter is similar in all three cases the Sérsic index cut has the worst sample contamination due to the number of LBS galaxies and other low-mass but high-n not-elliptical galaxies classified as early-type.

As seen in the previous sections the fitting parameters remain relatively robust to the slight changes in the overall population sample. In addition, the double power law fit to the late-types has a very high value for M0 (a few 10 11 M ) which means the fit tends to a single power-law over the mass range observed. We do again observe the turn off and flattening of the early-type relation, hence we recommend using the double-power law fit to the early-type galaxies.

        <p>We investigate the wavelength dependence of galaxy sizes using the results of the M * -Re relation fits to our visually classified early-/ late-type sample. The top panel of Fig. 7 plots the M * -Re relation fits to Eq. 2 in the grizZYJHKs bands for our late-types on the left and early-types on the right (we show the fits to Eq. 3 as the dashed and lighter coloured lines, to illustrate the effect of the turn-off of the early-type M * -Re relation at lower masses). It is clear that the early-type relation is steeper, and typically has smaller sizes, than the late-type relation with both M * -Re relations approaching similar sizes at M * = 10 11 M . For both the late-type and early-type M * -Re relation we see a smooth progression of the expected size with wavelength from gband to Ks-band. However, it is also apparent that the M * -Re relations are not parallel and the offset is a function of stellar mass. The bottom left panel of Fig. 7 plots the size change with wavelength for the late-types for two different masses, M * = 10 9 M and 10 10 M . We did not investigate the size-wavelength trend at M * = 10 11 M since we can not constrain the M * -Re relation well due to small number statistics.We investigate the wavelength dependence of galaxy sizes using the results of the M * -Re relation fits to our visually classified early-/ late-type sample. The top panel of Fig. 7 plots the M * -Re relation fits to Eq. 2 in the grizZYJHKs bands for our late-types on the left and early-types on the right (we show the fits to Eq. 3 as the dashed and lighter coloured lines, to illustrate the effect of the turn-off of the early-type M * -Re relation at lower masses). It is clear that the early-type relation is steeper, and typically has smaller sizes, than the late-type relation with both M * -Re relations approaching similar sizes at M * = 10 11 M . For both the late-type and early-type M * -Re relation we see a smooth progression of the expected size with wavelength from gband to Ks-band. However, it is also apparent that the M * -Re relations are not parallel and the offset is a function of stellar mass.

        <p>Overall we observe a reduction in size (g to Ks band) for the late-types of 16%, and 13% at M * = 10 9 M and 10 10 M respectively.

        <p>We believe that this reduction in observed size variation, both for early-and late-types, is due to the switch from the shallower UKIDSS YJHK imaging data to the deeper VIKING YJHKs imaging data. The spheroid population typically has high Sérsic index values (i.e. n∼4) which means they have very extended lower surface brightness wings which can lead to an overestimation of the local sky level. However, with the improvement of the imaging data switching from UKIDSS to VIKING these galaxy wings become detectable above the noise level and we recover larger radii during the light profile fitting. Galaxy discs are less affected by this since their low Sérsic index (n∼1) means they do not have low surface brightness wings which We use the M * -Re relation fits to Eq. 2 in our size-wavelength considerations, but the M * -Re relation fits to Eq. 3 are shown for comparison for early-types galaxies in the top right plot (dashed, lighter coloured lines). The bottom panel shows the corresponding size-wavelength variation with sizes calculated for different masses. We also show the best fit linear relation of the size-wavelength variation for each mass (fit parameters can be found in Table 4). In addition, we show the relations found by Kelvin et al.

        <p>We attribute the observed size variation in the late-type galaxies to dust attenuation which would preferentially obscure the central regions of galaxies and thus cause an artificial shift to higher effective half-light radii in the shorter optical bands. As such, this effect should be more prominent in disc galaxies which are dustier than spheroid galaxies. In fact the observed size change is in agreement with expected values, see e.g. Pastrav et al. (2013) who predict an effect of ∼15% on the sizes of discs due to dust attenuation. However, the observed size drop of ∼13% in our spheroid sample, which typically have no dust associated with them, suggests that other effects also influence the observed size variation of galaxies, such as stellar population or metallicity gradients and the two component nature of galaxies (see Vulcani et al. 2014, who have also noted this), i.e. generic inside-out formation histories with discs continually growing through gas infall and spheroids accreting in minor merger events.We attribute the observed size variation in the late-type galaxies to dust attenuation which would preferentially obscure the central regions of galaxies and thus cause an artificial shift to higher effective half-light radii in the shorter optical bands.

        <p>It is also interesting to note that we see a slight decrease of the size-wavelength dependence of galaxies with increasing mass across the early-and late-types. We are not certain if this trend is real (we only sample a small number of masses) nor do we fully understand the cause of this trend, if it is indeed significant. However, it would generally be consistent with downsizing (i.e. massive systems form faster, Thomas et al. 2005). In this context the massive galaxies are likely to be the oldest in our sample and hence would have had more time to re-distribute their stellar populations (in part aided by major mergers, see e.g. Conselice 2014) so that we see less stellar population (or colour) gradients and hence their Re and Sérsic index should change less with wavelength. In contrast for the less massive, and probably younger, galaxies we potentially see the traces of their accretion history (including minor mergers), where we have an older more centrally concentrated stellar populations and a younger more wide spread stellar population. This would be in accordance with the inside-out growth scenario for galaxies (e.g. Hopkins et al. 2009).It is also interesting to note that we see a slight decrease of the size-wavelength dependence of galaxies with increasing mass across the early-and late-types.

        <p>The resulting early-and late-type populations are fit with two functions, a single power law and a two-component power law. For the late-type samples, the two-component power law shows some variation with the 'transition mass' M0 changing significantly for different chosen separators. This is not surprising since we leave M0 as a free parameter in contrast to the S03 fits where M0 was set at the point at which the dispersion of their data changes and moves from 'high' to 'low' mass galaxies. As such M0 is only an artificial 'transition mass' in our fits and no real physical meaning can be assigned. In addition, we find that most parameters of Eq. 3 change significantly with the different cuts whereas parameter b in Eq. 2 stays remarkably constant and only the intercept changes with the chosen separator (indicating the biases introduced by the different separators). Considering this we find that the single power law fit is sufficient to describe the data and recommend using it as the canonical reference in comparison with other data sets.The resulting early-and late-type populations are fit with two functions, a single power law and a two-component power law.

        <p>For the early-types however we find that the twocomponent power law has more robust results than the single-component power law due to the flattening of the M * -Re distribution. We recommend that a move to a curved relation for the elliptical (early-types) galaxies is necessary (such as seen in Graham et al. 2006). However, if mostly high-mass elliptical galaxies are studied a singlecomponent power law may be sufficient, but we caution that the slope for the single-component power law in Table 3 describes the overall sample and hence is too shallow to describe a sample of only high-mass galaxies adequately. For those cases when a linear comparison is needed we provide additional M * -Re relations for early-type galaxies with masses of M * &gt; M lim = 2 × 10 10 M (fit to Eq. 2) in Appendix B.For the early-types however we find that the twocomponent power law has more robust results than the single-component power law due to the flattening of the M * -Re distribution.

        <p>On the basis that we want the most reliable selection for a sample of morphological late type galaxies we find that the (g-i)stars colour cut performs the best at higher masses (Table 5b, c) and the Sérsic index performs best at low masses (Table 5a). The most reliable early-type selection is given by the rolling cut for higher masses (Table 5b, c) and the (g -i)stars colour at low at masses (Table 5 a). The rolling cut failed at the low masses due to low number statistics. Since, by definition, the rolling cut maximizes the bijective probability of the galaxies being correctly identified as earlyor late-type (in terms of morphology) it is biased towards the higher mass galaxies where most ellipticals can be correctly identified. Hence out of the 35 low-mass galaxies identified as early-type using the rolling cut none of them are found to be elliptical galaxies. We find that a Sérsic-index selection is the least reliable selection that we have considered for discriminating between morphological early-and late-type galaxies. The inspection of the low mass (M * &lt; M lim = 10 9.4 M ) cross-scatter seen in the early-type sample using the Sérsic index cut shows that these galaxies are predominantly blue in colour (i.e. (u -r)stars &lt; 1.5), have a median size Re ∼ 1.2kpc and have comparably low Sérsic indices (that is 53% have a Sérsic index n&lt;3 as opposed to only 23% for the entire early-type sample) hence most of this population was likely missed in the S03 analysis.On the basis that we want the most reliable selection for a sample of morphological late type galaxies we find that the (g-i)stars colour cut performs the best at higher masses (Table 5b, c) and the Sérsic index performs best at low masses (Table 5a).

        <p>Consequently the low mass galaxies which are moved into our early-type sample by the Sérsic index cut cause a flattening in the M * -Re distribution. This flattening is not unlike the that seen for the elliptical galaxies but should not be confused with it since in the low mass cross-scatter is predominantly made up of morphological late-type galaxies. The flattening of the M * -Re relation fit could become even more significant when using other (less robust) fitting routines or further expanding the low mass end of the data set. We advise caution when considering the Sérsic index to split a data set into early-and late types especially if the early-type galaxies are of particular interest and low mass galaxies are included. Even using our simple morphological classification of elliptical and not-elliptical to distinguish the early and late-type galaxies, we can see a correlation with colour and Sérsic index, but they are by no means synonymous with the morphological classification. Using generic/rigid separators to divide the galaxy population into early-and late types should be used with caution and most importantly wherever possible the same separation schemes should be compared. If morphological information is unavailable both a division by dust corrected colour or a combined Sérsic and colour division are good alternatives to separate the early-and late-type galaxies. We find that our (g -i)stars colour performs slightly better than our (u -r)stars colour. However, this is likely an effect of the poorer imaging quality in the u-band which translates to a slightly less reliable (u -r)stars colour. Overall, the Sérsic index is the least desirable separator, especially if the sample extends 5. The table shows the fraction of late-and early-type galaxies which are classified as not-elliptical or elliptical for the four rigid population cuts. In addition we calculate the (bijective) probability of any galaxy in the sample having been correctly associated with the morphological early-and late-type classifications. From top to bottom we show this for galaxies a) below the mass limit; b) galaxies above the mass limit and c) the entire sample. In each case we also show the percentage of the entire sample that were visually classified as either elliptical (early-type) or not-elliptical (late-type). The sample sizes do not add up to 100% and the missing fraction is represented by the LBS.Consequently the low mass galaxies which are moved into our early-type sample by the Sérsic index cut cause a flattening in the M * -Re distribution.

        <p>In addition to the various population separators we have analysed the M * -Re relation in 10 imaging bands, ugrizZYJHKs. Fitting in each band is done for all five population separators using the fitting routines as described for the r -band data in Sec. 3. This is important for various reasons such as the change in population make-up when using non-morphological early-/late-type cuts. The most noticeable effect is the observed change in galaxy size with wavelength (La Barbera et al. 2010;Kelvin et al. 2012;Häussler et al. 2013;Vulcani et al. 2014;van der Wel et al. 2014), which could be caused by dust attenuation and/or the inside out growth of galaxies which causes different stellar populations to be observed at different wavelengths and hence is an effect of both a change in colour as well as Sérsic index. This effect will also be important when comparing to high redshift data due to the shift in restframe wavelength. It is therefore imperative to take the change in size, as well as the population make-up due to colour and Sérsic index changes, into account when studying the growth of galaxies.In addition to the various population separators we have analysed the M * -Re relation in 10 imaging bands, ugrizZYJHKs.

        <p>Finally, we have studied the size-wavelength dependence using the M * -Re relation fits to the grizZYJHKs for early-and late-types as classified by their visual morphologies. We confirm the presence of a size-wavelength dependence for both early-and late-type galaxies. However, we find that the previously reported size drop of 38% for early-types (Kelvin et al. 2012) has likely been an overestimation which can be attributed to the limiting near-IR imaging data quality. In our analysis we have used VIKING ZYJHKs instead of UKIDSS YJHK band imaging data and find that late-type galaxies experience an average size drop of ∼14% and early-type galaxies a size drop of ∼12%, much less than previously reported. It is also interesting to note that the observed change in galaxy size with wavelength might depend on the mass-range probed.

        <p>In future work we will expand our analysis to look in more detail at disks, spheroids and galaxy components. The study of the M * -Re relation by galaxy type and component will lay the foundations for more thorough comparisons with intermediate to high redshift data. For example, it has been put forward that compact high redshift galaxies are actually the cores of modern day galaxies (see e.g. Driver et al. 2013;Dullo &amp; Graham 2013). To confirm this, it is necessary to establish a robust M * -Re relations of local galaxy components for comparison. Additionally, we can further test evolutionary models by studying the connection between angular momentum and galaxy size, more specifically we will study the mass-spin-morphology relation using the disc M * -Re relation of galaxies. The data was analysed in the same way as outlined for the r -band data. We exclude outliers and bad fits in each band individually in addition we also remove galaxies with unrealistic fitting parameters which leads to varying sample sizes. However, after implementing the staggered volume limited sample in each band the final sample sizes, with the exception of the u-band, are comparable with each other. The number of 'good-fit' galaxies and the staggered volume limited sample size for each band can be found in table 1 and Tables 2 and3 show the resulting fitting parameters to Eqs. 2 and 3 for the late and early-types respectively.

The following 9 plots are equivalent to the r -band plot presented in the main part of the paper and show the M * -Re relations for ugizZYJHKs late types (left hand panels, blue) and earlytypes (right hand panels, red) divided from top to bottom panel by: (i) the Sérsic index, (ii) the restframe (u-r ) colour, (iii) the restframe (g-i) colour, (iv) a combined (u-r )stars colour-Sérsic index cut and (v) the visual galaxy morphology.</p>
        <p>In high redshift studies it becomes more difficult to divide the sampled galaxies into the conventional early-and late-types. To allow a more direct comparison to high redshift data we have fit the local M * -Re relation using Eq. 2 to the entire sample without any early-/ late-type division. The results for all 10 imaging bands can be found in Table B1.In high redshift studies it becomes more difficult to divide the sampled galaxies into the conventional early-and late-types.

        <p>In addition, in many cases (especially at higher redshifts) only high-mass data is available to establish a M * -Re relation. In the case of the early-type galaxies this exclusion of low-mass data can lead to a significant change in the slope of the M * -Re relation (since a single-power law is sufficient to describe the data). To allow for easier comparison to these high-mass (and/ or high-z) data we have analysed the M * -Re relation of our high-mass early-types. For this we fit the M * -Re relation to elliptical galaxies with masses M * &gt; 2 × 10 10 M . This is the average transition mass M0 according to our morphology cut (g-Ks band, see Table 3) and also agrees with the limit imposed by van der Wel et al. 2014 to avoid the flattening of the early-type relation.In addition, in many cases (especially at higher redshifts) only high-mass data is available to establish a M * -Re relation.

        <p>We also set up a high-mass sample for the 'not-elliptical' galaxies. For this we set the lower mass limit to the mass limit of our colour unbiased volume limited sample, M * &gt; 2.5 × 10 9 M . Not unsurprisingly the results of the M * -Re relation fit remain mostly unchanged. This is in good agreement with our previous observation that the late-type M * -Re relation is fairly robust to changes in the population set up. The resulting fitting parameters can be found in Table B2. 2 and3.We also set up a high-mass sample for the 'not-elliptical' galaxies.

        <p>An individual V/Vmax based on each galaxy's zmax can cause a few data points to skew the M * -Re relation. We found this to be especially problematic in the case of the Sérsic cut early-type galaxies.An individual V/Vmax based on each galaxy's zmax can cause a few data points to skew the M * -Re relation.

        <p>We caution again that using the Sérsic index to establish earlyand late-type galaxy populations is misleading when assuming morphological agreement since there are elliptical galaxies with low n and disc galaxies with high n.We caution again that using the Sérsic index to establish earlyand late-type galaxy populations is misleading when assuming morphological agreement since there are elliptical galaxies with low n and disc galaxies with high n.</p>
