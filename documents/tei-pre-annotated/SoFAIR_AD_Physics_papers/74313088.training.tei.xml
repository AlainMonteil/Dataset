        <p>The search for novel tools for controlling magnetism at the nanoscale is crucial for the development of new paradigms in optics, electronics and spintronics. So far, the fabrication of magnetic nanostructures has been mainly achieved through irreversible structural or chemical modifications. Here, we propose a new concept for creating reconfigurable magnetic nanopatterns, by crafting at the nanoscale the magnetic anisotropy landscape of a ferromagnetic layer exchangecoupled to an antiferromagnetic one. By performing a localized field cooling with the hot tip of a scanning probe microscope, magnetic structures, with arbitrarily oriented magnetization and tunable unidirectional anisotropy, are reversibly patterned without modifying the film chemistry and topography. This opens unforeseen possibilities for the development of novel metamaterials with finely tuned magnetic properties, such as reconfigurable magnetoplasmonic and magnonic crystals. In this context, we experimentally demonstrate the spatially controlled spin-waves excitation and propagation in magnetic structures patterned with the proposed method. Metamaterials are composite materials in which new functionalities emerge from engineered combinations of carefully chosen and nanoscale designed material building blocks 1-4 . Among these, magnetic metamaterials allow unprecedented versatility in the design of novel device architectures, exploiting the controlled propagation of the electromagnetic radiation 1 , surface plasmons 5,6 and spin-waves [7][8][9] . In this context, the development of a new class of reprogrammable magnetic metamaterials, whose functionality can be actively redesigned on demand, would open new, far reaching directions for nanomagnetism and spintronics.The search for novel tools for controlling magnetism at the nanoscale is crucial for the development of new paradigms in optics, electronics and spintronics.

        <p>In this paper, we propose a novel, versatile approach based on SPL, namely "thermally assisted magnetic scanning probe lithography" (tam-SPL), to achieve a desired and reconfigurable nanoscale engineering of the magnetic properties of a continuous film. The working principle of tam-SPL is the local heating and cooling of an exchange-biased ferromagnetic (FM) layer by means of the hot tip of a scanning probe microscope (SPM) brought in contact with the sample, in presence of a magnetic field. This local field cooling sets a unidirectional magnetic anisotropy in the FM, due to the exchange-coupling with the adjacent antiferromagnet (AF) 15 . Phenomenologically, this causes a local pinning of the FM magnetization, which is observed as a shift in its hysteresis loop.In this paper, we propose a novel, versatile approach based on SPL, namely "thermally assisted magnetic scanning probe lithography" (tam-SPL), to achieve a desired and reconfigurable nanoscale engineering of the magnetic properties of a continuous film.

        <p>In particular, we demonstrate the patterning of micro-and nano-structures with arbitrary shape, anisotropy and spin orientation. The pattern is stable at room temperature and cannot be permanently erased with magnetic fields, thus combining endurance and reconfigurability. These features can be exploited in the emerging field of magnonics to fabricate structures for the active manipulations of spin-waves. As a proof-of-concept experiment, we show that a local control of the spin-waves excitation and propagation can be obtained in reconfigurable magnetic tracks patterned via tam-SPL.In particular, we demonstrate the patterning of micro-and nano-structures with arbitrary shape, anisotropy and spin orientation.

        <p>The working principle of tam-SPL is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. The exchange bias system is first initialized by heating the whole sample above the blocking temperature TB, and subsequently cooling it in a uniform magnetic field Hi. This initialization sets a uniform unidirectional (UD) anisotropy axis in the FM film (see Fig. 1a), shifting its hysteresis loop by the exchange bias field (He) (see Fig. 1d and Methods for details). The hot tip of a SPM [16][17][18][19][20] is then used to locally heat the surface of the stack above TB (160Â°C) in a uniform static magnetic field Hw = 700 Oe, which in this particular case is chosen to be opposite to the initialization field Hi. When the hot tip is displaced in its motion along the writing direction, the previously heated region of the AF film undergoes a "local field cooling" accompanied by a local rearrangement of the spins, due to the coupling with the underlying FM oriented in the direction of the external field Hw (Fig. 1b). Therefore, at the AF-FM interface in the patterned area, a different local exchange bias is established, which shifts the local hysteresis loop to the right by a new exchange bias field Hep (Fig. 1e). Here, upon removal of the writing field Hw, the local remanent magnetization within the FM layer is determined by the new UD magnetic anisotropy. As a result, the spins of the FM in the patterned area (red arrows in Fig. 1c) are antiparallel to those of the surrounding film (yellow arrows) that switched back to the initial state.The working principle of tam-SPL is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1.

        <p>The patterning capabilities of this technique are demonstrated in Fig. 2. 20 Âµm-wide square pads were first defined by optical lithography in order to facilitate navigation on the sample. Then, we used tam-SPL to define in the pad square-, triangular-and diamond-shaped structures with different lateral sizes, from 1.5 Âµm to 2.5 Âµm (Fig. 2a), using a 3 Âµm/s writing speed. The SPM heater temperature (TH) was set to 560Â°C, 675Â°C and 765Â°C for squares, triangles and diamonds, respectively. These TH values ensure that the actual temperature at the tip-sample interface is well above TB (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Hw was set antiparallel to Hi, in order to write structures with antiparallel remanent magnetization. For more details on the patterning conditions, see Methods and Supplementary Information, where a general model for the heat flow analysis developed for thermochemical (tc-)SPL 18 has been adapted to the present case. Figure 2a shows a magnetic force microscopy (MFM) image of a pad, taken at zero external field (remanent state) after tam-SPL, while Fig. 2b shows the topography of the same area. The opposite MFM magnetic contrast seen at the left and right edges of the patterns with respect to that at the pad edges demonstrates that regions with opposite UD anisotropy and remanent magnetization were written by tam-SPL. We remark that tam-SPL does not alter the morphology of the films (see Fig. 2b) and that the patterning is, therefore, "purely magnetic".

        <p>Even though diamonds were written at much higher temperature than squares, the resulting magnetic contrast is the same for all patterned structures, thus indicating that once the blocking temperature of the system is exceeded, reproducible patterns can be obtained without the need of a precise control of TH. As the degradation of exchange bias due to Mn interdiffusion starts to develop for temperatures above 350Â°C 21 , there is a wide range of film temperatures, from 160Â°C to 350Â°C, where patterning can be performed without causing sizeable irreversibility (see Fig. 4 and related discussion). The fact that a very demanding control over the tip temperature is not required is crucial for future applications.Even though diamonds were written at much higher temperature than squares, the resulting magnetic contrast is the same for all patterned structures, thus indicating that once the blocking temperature of the system is exceeded, reproducible patterns can be obtained without the need of a precise control of TH.

        <p>The determination of the minimum feature size achievable by performing tam-SPL in our multilayer system was assessed by writing single lines with Hw antiparallel to Hi and a spacing of 2 Âµm (see Fig. 2d). The high resolution MFM image (Fig. 2e) of the dashed area in Fig. 2d shows that the average width of a single line, measured over a 2 Âµm section, is 300 nm, with a minimum of 250 nm. This demonstrates that, in this condition, the minimum spacing between lines during writing allowing to keep their individuality is on the order of 300 nm. The patterned lines present two DWs of the same topology as those observed in the horizontal sides of the squares (see Fig. 2f and2i), with magnetization antiparallel with respect to the non-patterned area. The minimum feature size and the corrugation of the lines are determined both by the domain wall width, which depends on the micromagnetic properties of the system, and by the spatial profile of the exchange bias written by tam-SPL. Micromagnetic simulations indicate that the width of ideal 180 degrees DWs, with the magnetization lying parallel to the wall far away from it, is in the order of 350 nm, in good agreement with the experimental width of the lines of Fig. 2e (see Supplementary Fig. 8 and ref. 22). The spatial profile of the exchange bias is given by the finite width of the thermal profile produced by the hot tip in the AF layer as well as by the spatial distribution of the blocking temperatures of the system, which reflects the distribution of grain sizes in the AF layer (see Supplementary Information). An improved spatial resolution and a reduced line corrugation can thus be achieved by optimizing the patterning conditions, the micromagnetic properties of the system 22 (e.g. the exchange bias strength, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, exchange stiffness), the grain size distribution and the thermal properties of the materials 23 .The determination of the minimum feature size achievable by performing tam-SPL in our multilayer system was assessed by writing single lines with Hw antiparallel to Hi and a spacing of 2 Âµm (see Fig. 2d).

        <p>Concerning the spatial confinement of the thermal profile, it has already been demonstrated that, performing thermochemical (tc)-SPL on thermally insulating films 18 , 15 nm features size can be achieved, which is at least comparable with state-of-the-art near-field transducers for magnetic recording technology 24 . Regarding the writing speed, note that the crucial parameter is the time required to locally heat the sample above TB; further improvement, i.e., down to 1 Âµs per pointfeature, could be obtained with a different thermal cantilever design 25 .Concerning the spatial confinement of the thermal profile, it has already been demonstrated that, performing thermochemical (tc)-SPL on thermally insulating films 18 , 15 nm features size can be achieved, which is at least comparable with state-of-the-art near-field transducers for magnetic recording technology 24 .

        <p>Figure 3 shows that it is possible to finely tune the patterned magnetic anisotropy landscape by controlling the tip temperatures. In Fig. 3a, we show the MFM image taken in the remanent state from square areas patterned with TH = 100Â°C, 240Â°C and 435Â°C, from the right to the left in the Figure, while applying Hw = 700 Oe antiparallel to Hi. When TH = 100Â°C, the local temperature of the sample is well below the blocking temperature, therefore no magnetic contrast is seen (blue square). Correspondingly, the shift of the local hysteresis loop measured with Âµ-MOKE along the UD anisotropy direction (Fig. 3b), approximately -50 Oe, is comparable to the one of the loop (yellow loop in Fig. 3d) measured in the adjacent non-patterned area (yellow square in Fig. 3a).Figure 3 shows that it is possible to finely tune the patterned magnetic anisotropy landscape by controlling the tip temperatures.

        <p>The patterned area written with TH = 240Â°C (green square) shows a magnetic contrast and the corresponding local hysteresis loop (Fig. 3c) is centred at zero magnetic fields. By increasing TH to 435Â°C (red square in Fig. 3a) the local hysteresis loop is eventually shifted to the right by +50 Oe (Fig. 3d), showing the full inversion of the exchange bias field. The zero shift of the loop at 240Â°C results from an incomplete exchange bias inversion due to the expected distribution of TB in the film arising from the presence of grains with different size 15,29 (see Supplementary Fig. 1). This demonstrates the possibility to pattern complex magnetic anisotropy landscapes in a continuous multilayer by tuning the heater temperature during writing. Moreover, by setting Hw at different angles with respect to Hi, areas with UD anisotropy axis arbitrarily oriented with respect to the film UD anisotropy set during initialization can be patterned (see Supplementary Fig. 3).The patterned area written with TH = 240Â°C (green square) shows a magnetic contrast and the corresponding local hysteresis loop (Fig. 3c) is centred at zero magnetic fields.

        <p>The analysis of the magnetic behaviour of the patterned area under applied magnetic field, including the stability of the patterns, was carried out by Âµ-MOKE. In Fig. 3e we report some frames from a video (see Supplementary Movie 1) showing the field induced evolution of the magnetization in the patterned area of Fig. 2c (right column). The appearance and disappearance of the pattern is in agreement with the expected hysteresis loops of the patterned (non-patterned) regions, sketched in red (yellow). Furthermore, crucial for technological applications, we have verified that the same remanent state (red shapes in Fig. 3e) is always recovered even after 2000 magnetization switching cycles performed with fields up to 1000 Oe (data not shown) and that the patterns are stable 6 months after writing. Indeed, the resilience of tam-SPL patterns arises from the stability of exchange bias, a key property exploited also in magnetic memory applications [30][31][32][33] . This feature can be used to implement a permanent functionality, similarly to the case of magnetic devices patterned by conventional techniques, such as lithography and ion irradiation.The analysis of the magnetic behaviour of the patterned area under applied magnetic field, including the stability of the patterns, was carried out by Âµ-MOKE.

        <p>Coplanar wave guides (CPW), with ground to ground distance of 12 Âµm and oriented perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction of the tam-SPL tracks, were fabricated by electronbeam lithography and lift-off. Âµ-BLS measurements were performed in order to map the spinwaves (SWs) intensity distribution. 5e), shows that the spin-wave intensity is about 36 times higher in type A track (red circles), with respect to type B (blue squares). Such behaviour can be explained considering that, for this CPW geometry, SWs are efficiently excited mainly by the coupling between the in-plane component of the microwave field (Hrf in Fig. 5a) and the corresponding component of the dynamical magnetization, associated to the SWs, while the out-of-plane component of the microwave field plays a minor role. Within the pattern, the efficiency of the coupling is high in type A and low in type B tracks, depending on whether the in-plane component of the microwave field and the corresponding component of the dynamic magnetization are parallel or perpendicular 42,43 . Fig. 5d shows the colour coded SWs intensity on a logarithmic scale acquired at remanence as a function of the distance y from the CPW, in the center of two adjacent tracks. We found that spinwaves rapidly attenuate in type B track (bottom panel), while in type A track (top panel) they efficiently propagate over a distance comparable to that observed in Py and CoFe waveguides prepared by conventional lithographic techniques 44,45 . This result is confirmed by the BLS spectra acquired at y = 2.25 Âµm in track A and B, shown in Fig. 5f. This finding can be explained taking into account that for perpendicular alignment of the SWs wavevector and the local magnetization, the SWs group velocity is much larger than for parallel alignment 46 .Coplanar wave guides (CPW), with ground to ground distance of 12 Âµm and oriented perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction of the tam-SPL tracks, were fabricated by electronbeam lithography and lift-off. Âµ-BLS measurements were performed in order to map the spinwaves (SWs) intensity distribution. 5e), shows that the spin-wave intensity is about 36 times higher in type A track (red circles), with respect to type B (blue squares). Such behaviour can be explained considering that, for this CPW geometry, SWs are efficiently excited mainly by the coupling between the in-plane component of the microwave field (Hrf in Fig. 5a) and the corresponding component of the dynamical magnetization, associated to the SWs, while the out-of-plane component of the microwave field plays a minor role. Within the pattern, the efficiency of the coupling is high in type A and low in type B tracks, depending on whether the in-plane component of the microwave field and the corresponding component of the dynamic magnetization are parallel or perpendicular 42,43 . Fig. 5d shows the colour coded SWs intensity on a logarithmic scale acquired at remanence as a function of the distance y from the CPW, in the center of two adjacent tracks.

        <p>In the Supplementary Fig. 7 we discuss the design of phase shifters and magnonic crystals exploiting the modulation of the refractive index seen by the SWs in patterned regions with different relative orientation of the static magnetization and of the SWs wavevector. A single stripe can be used to implement a phase shifter to be inserted in Mach-Zehnder-type interferometers, which have been proposed as basic building blocks for computing 47 . In addition, periodic arrangement of stripes as those shown in Fig. 2d can be used to realize a magnonic crystal showing the emergence of the characteristic band-gaps. The band-width and the position of the band-gaps can be tuned by controlling the stripe width, their separation, and the width of the regions of spin rotation between the stripes. Since all these parameters can be set reversibly during patterning, our technique allows the fabrication of fully reconfigurable magnonic crystals and devices. Moreover, the active tuning of the magnonic properties after patterning can be achieved by controlling the domains extension and magnetization orientation via external magnetic fields (see Fig. 3).In the Supplementary Fig. 7 we discuss the design of phase shifters and magnonic crystals exploiting the modulation of the refractive index seen by the SWs in patterned regions with different relative orientation of the static magnetization and of the SWs wavevector.

        <p>Co40Fe40B20(5 nm)/Ir22Mn78(7 nm)/Ru(2 nm) stacks were deposited on Si/SiO2(1000 nm) substrates by DC magnetron sputtering using an AJA Orion8 system with a base pressure below 1Ã10 -8 Torr. During the deposition, a 300 Oe magnetic field (HG) was applied in the sample plane for setting the magnetocrystalline uniaxial (UA) anisotropy direction in the CoFeB layer and the exchange bias direction in the as-grown sample. Both the critical temperature at which the exchange bias disappears (blocking temperature TB) and the exchange bias strength decrease with the antiferromagnetic layer (IrMn) thickness. We used a 7 nm IrMn layer, as this thickness ensures both a strong exchange bias and a TB above room temperature (160Â°C, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1), allowing to perform local field cooling by scanning the heatable SPM tip. Concerning the FM, the 5 nm CoFeB thickness ensures both a sizeable exchange bias, which decreases for higher FM thickness 15 , and a straightforward characterization of the magnetic domains by magnetic force microscopy (MFM) and magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy (Âµ-MOKE).

        <p>In order to conduct investigations of the magnetization distribution at the sub-micrometer length scale we used a characterization tool based on magneto-optic Kerr effect imaging/magnetometry based on an optical wide-field polarization microscope optimized for Kerr microscopy (Evico Gmbh). Arbitrary magnetic fields can be applied during observation so that domain nucleation and magnetization processes can be observed. Indeed, the domain contrast in the image is directly sensitive to the projection of the magnetization along the sensitivity direction, which is set either parallel or perpendicular to the externally applied field. To this purpose, the microscope was equipped with a rotatable bipolar electromagnet that allows the application of a magnetic field of intensity up to 5000 Oe along an arbitrary direction in the sample plane. Two different operational modes of the microscope were used: in the first, through a high sensitivity and resolution CCD camera, magnetic contrast imaging of the sample surface was performed with a spatial resolution ~ 500 nm. In the second, the CCD camera was used as a conventional photodetector to measure the local magnetization reversal (hysteresis loops) by selecting an arbitrary region of interest (ROI) and thus a limited number of pixel. At maximum optical magnification (objective 100x followed by a 4x tube lens), each CCD pixel corresponds to an area of 15 x 15 nm 2 of the sample surface.In order to conduct investigations of the magnetization distribution at the sub-micrometer length scale we used a characterization tool based on magneto-optic Kerr effect imaging/magnetometry based on an optical wide-field polarization microscope optimized for Kerr microscopy (Evico Gmbh).
