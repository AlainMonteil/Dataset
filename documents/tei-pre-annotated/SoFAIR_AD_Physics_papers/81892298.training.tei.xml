        <p>We study the possibility that self-interacting bosonic dark matter forms starlike objects. We study both the case of attractive and repulsive self-interactions, and we focus particularly in the parameter phase space where self-interactions can solve well standing problems of the collisionless dark matter paradigm. We find the mass radius relations for these dark matter bosonic stars, their density profile as well as the maximum mass they can support.We study the possibility that self-interacting bosonic dark matter forms starlike objects.

        <p>Bosonic degrees of freedom arise generically and naturally in theories of fundamental physics, both in the Standard Model and beyond. The Higgs boson is of paramount importance, being the only fundamental scalar in the Standard Model [1][2][3][4], but many other scalar degrees of freedom have been proposed to extend particle physics to high energy scales. These include (among many others) the axion of QCD [5][6][7][8][9] or the scalar which drives the expansion of the universe in quintessence models [10].Bosonic degrees of freedom arise generically and naturally in theories of fundamental physics, both in the Standard Model and beyond.

        <p>These bosonic particles often make good Dark Matter (DM) candidates as well. One reason for this is that unlike the Higgs, many of these new scalars would be stable or longlived enough that they could coalesce into DM halos which constitute the seeds of galaxy formation. Unlike the usual collisionless cold DM picture, however, we are interested in the scenario where large collections of these bosons form bound states of macroscopic size due to their self-gravitation (and self-interaction generically). For this picture to be consistent, the scalars are taken to be sufficiently cold so that they may coalesce into a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) state, and can thus be described by a single condensate wavefunction. These wavefunctions can indeed encompass an astrophysically large volume of space and have thus been termed "boson stars" [11].These bosonic particles often make good Dark Matter (DM) candidates as well.

        <p>It was shown many years ago that objects of this type are allowed by the equations of motion, first by Kaup [12] and subsequently by Ruffini and Bonazzola [13] in non-interacting systems. They found a maximum mass for boson stars of the form M max ≈ 0.633M 2 P /m, where M P = 1.22 × 10 19 GeV is the Planck mass and m is the mass of the individual bosons. (This is very different from the analogous limit for fermionic stars, termed the Chandrasekhar limit, which scales as M 3 P /m 2 ). Later, it was shown by Colpi et al. [11] that self interactions in these systems can cause significant phenomenological changes. In particular, they examined systems with repulsive self-interactions, and show that the upper JHEP02(2016)028 limit on the mass is M max ≈ 0.02 √ λM 3 P /m 2 , where λ is a dimensionless φ 4 coupling. 1 This extra factor of M P /m as compared to the noninteracting case makes it more plausible that boson stars can have masses even larger than a solar mass. A different method of constraining the boson star parameter space, which fits the coupling strength using data from galaxy and galaxy cluster sizes, has been considered in [14,15].It was shown many years ago that objects of this type are allowed by the equations of motion, first by Kaup [12] and subsequently by Ruffini and Bonazzola [13] in non-interacting systems.

        <p>The situation for attractive self-interactions is slightly more complex. The simplest case involves a self-interaction of the form λφ 4 , where λ &lt; 0 for attractive interactions. If this were the highest-order term in the potential, then it would not be bounded below, and so one typically stabilizes it by the addition of a positive φ 6 term. We will assume that the contribution of such higher-order terms is negligible phenomenologically (we address the validity of that assumption in section 3.3). Furthermore, in this scenario the typical sizes of gravitationally bound BEC states is significantly smaller than the repulsive or noninteracting cases. This is because the only force supporting the condensate against collapse comes from the uncertainty principle. Gravity and attractive self-interactions tend to shrink the condensate. We will see in section 3 that the maximum mass for an attractive condensate scales as M max ∼ M P / |λ|. This result was originally derived using an approximate analytical method [16], and was later confirmed by a precise numerical calculation [17].The situation for attractive self-interactions is slightly more complex.

        <p>DM self-interactions have already been proposed and studied in different contexts [18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37]. One of the main reasons why DM self-interactions can play an important role is due to the increasing tension between numerical simulations of collisionless cold DM and astrophysical observations, the resolution of which (for the moment) is unknown. The first discrepancy, known as the "cusp-core problem", is related to the fact that dwarf galaxies are observed to have flat density profiles in their central regions [38,39], while N-body simulations predict cuspy profiles for collisionless DM [40]. Second, the number of satellite galaxies in the Milkly Way is far fewer than the number predicted in simulations [41][42][43][44][45][46]. Last is the so-called "too big to fail" problem: simulations predict dwarf galaxies in a mass range that we have not observed, but which are too large to have not yet produced stars [47].DM self-interactions have already been proposed and studied in different contexts [18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37].

        <p>The solution of these problems is currently unknown, but a particularly well-motivated idea involves self-interacting DM (SIDM). Simulations including such interactions suggest that they have the effect of smoothing out cuspy density profiles, and could solve the other problems of collisionless DM as well [25,48,49]. These simulations prefer a self-interaction cross section of 0.1 cm 2 /g σ/m 10 cm 2 /g. There are, however, upper bounds on σ/m from a number of sources, including the preservation of ellipticity of spiral galaxies [50,51]. The allowed parameter space from these constraints nonetheless intersects the range of cross sections which can resolve the small-scale issues of collisionless DM, in the range 0.1 cm 2 /g σ/m 1 cm 2 /g. Self-gravitation and additionally extra self-interactions among DM particles can lead in some cases to the collapse of part of the DM population into formation of dark stars. The idea of DM forming star-like compact objects is not new. Dark stars that consist of annihilating DM might have existed in the early universe [52][53][54]. Dark stars have been JHEP02(2016)028 also studied in the context of hybrid compact stars made of baryonic and DM [55][56][57][58] as well as in the context of mirror DM [59][60][61][62]. Additionally some of the authors of the current paper studied the possibility of dark star formation from asymmetric fermionic DM that exhibits Yukawa type self-interactions that can alleviate the problems of the collisionless cold DM paradigm [63]. Unlike the dark stars of annihilating DM, asymmetric dark stars can be stable and observable today. [63] displays the parameter space where it is possible to observe such dark stars, providing mass radius relations, corresponding Chandrasekhar mass limits and density profiles.

        <p>In this paper we examine the dark stars composed of asymmetric self-interacting bosonic DM. The study is fundamentally different from that of [63] because unlike the case of fermionic DM where the stability of the star is achieved by equilibrium between the Fermi pressure and gravitation, bosonic DM does not have a Fermi surface. They form a BEC in the ground state and it is the uncertainty principle that keeps the star from collapsing. We are going to demonstrate how DM self-interactions affect the mass radius relation, the density profile and the maximum mass of these DM bosonic stars in the context of the self-interactions that reconcile cold DM with the observational findings.In this paper we examine the dark stars composed of asymmetric self-interacting bosonic DM.

        <p>To quantify how scarce boson stars have to be within this approximation, we assume that boson stars have a characteristic radius R, mass M and number density n BS . The mass, number density and self-interaction cross section of free DM is taken to be m, n and σ.

        <p>As we pointed out in the introduction, in the case of attractive interactions the potential is unbounded from below since λ &lt; 0.

We assumed that self-interactions are mediated by a λφ 4 interaction and we investigated what type of stars can be formed in the case of both attractive and repulsive self-interactions, giving particular emphasis to the parameter phase space of masses and couplings where the DM bosons alleviate the problems of collisionless DM. We have considered DM particles that populate the BEC ground state. We estimated the maximum mass where these dark stars are stable, the mass-radius relation and the density profile for generic values of DM mass and self-interacting coupling λ.In this paper we studied the possibility that self-interacting bosonic DM forms stars.

        <p>We leave several things for future work. The first and most important is the mechanism of formation for these bosonic dark stars. Sufficiently strong self-interactions can lead to the gravothermal collapse of part or the whole amount of DM to dark stars [81]. In this case, DM self-interactions can facilitate the formation of bosonic stars because DM particles get confined to deeper self-gravitating wells simply by expelling high energetic DM particles out of the core. As the core loses energy, the virial theorem dictates that the core shrinks and heats up the same time. This leads to further energy loss and thus to the gravothermal collapse. Such a scenario could also explain why the black hole at the center of the Galaxy is so heavy, since DM bosonic stars could provide the initial seed required for the further growth of the supermassive black hole [82]. It is interesting to note that boson stars can coexist in equilibrium with black holes, as shown in [83,84]. One should also notice that if the whole density of DM collapses to dark stars, one does not have to be within the narrow band of parameter space depicted in figures 3 and 6. Another possibility is the creation of high DM density regions due to adiabatic contraction, caused by baryons [85,86]. Moreover, bosonic DM particles can get trapped inside regular stars via DM-nucleon collisions. The DM population is inherited by subsequent white dwarfs that, in case of supernovae 1a explosions, can leave the bosonic matter intact, either alone or with some baryonic matter [87].We leave several things for future work.

        <p>Asymmetric bosonic dark stars where no substantial number of annihilations take place will not be very visible in the sky, although present. Gravitational lensing could be one way to deduce the presence of such stars in the universe. Additionally, if the DM boson interacts with the Standard Model particles via some portal (e.g. kinetic mixing between a photon and a dark photon), thermal Bremmstrahlung could potentially produce an observable amount of luminosity. This is particularly interesting since such a photon spectrum would probe directly the density profile of the boson star. Bosonic stars could also disguise themselves as "odd" neutron stars. For example, it is hard to explain sub-millisecond pulsars with typical neutron stars. XTE J1739-285 could possibly be such a case, since it allegedly rotates with a frequency of 1122Hz [88]. Compact enough bosonic stars would have no problem to explain such high rotational frequencies. Another possibility is the observation of compact stars with masses higher than the maximum mass a neutron star can support. Such might be the case of the so-called "black widow" PSR B1957+20, with a mass of 2.4 solar masses [89]. Therefore, abnormal neutron stars can well be the smoking gun for the existence of asymmetric dark stars either with fermionic constituents like [63], or with the bosonic ones studied here.Asymmetric bosonic dark stars where no substantial number of annihilations take place will not be very visible in the sky, although present.
