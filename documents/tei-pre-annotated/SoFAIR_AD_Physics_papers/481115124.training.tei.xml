        <p>Twisted photons can be used as alphabets to encode information beyond one bit per single photon. This ability offers great potential for quantum information tasks, as well as for the investigation of fundamental questions. In this review article, we give a brief overview of the theoretical differences between qubits and higher dimensional systems, qudits, in different quantum information scenarios. We then describe recent experimental developments in this field over the past three years. Finally, we summarize some important experimental and theoretical questions that might be beneficial to understand better in the near future.Twisted photons can be used as alphabets to encode information beyond one bit per single photon.

        <p>Quantum information science and quantum information technology have seen a virtual explosion worldwide. The explosion is all based on the observation that fundamental quantum phenomena on the individual particle or system-levels lead to completely novel ways of encoding, processing and transmitting information. Quantum mechanics, a child of the first third of the 20th century, has found numerous realizations and technical applications, many more than were thought possible at the beginning. Decades later, it became possible to do experiments with individual quantum particles and quantum systems. This was due to technological progress, and particularly for light, the development of the laser. Only about 40 years ago, quantum phenomena were studied for their own curiosities. The motivation was that the predictions of quantum mechanics for individual systems were rather counterintuitive. People wanted to see these in a concrete way in the laboratory. Fundamental phenomena include quantum superposition for individual particles, as corroborated for example by neutron interferometers and by the double slit experiment for individual massive particles and for individual photons, the objective randomness of the individual quantum event, quantum entanglement 1 and entanglement as signified by the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox 2 and Bell's theorem 3 and the nocloning theorem 4 . To date, these fundamental experiments in the new field of quantum information science and quantum information technology were signified by such notions as quantum communication, quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation, quantum computation and many more. These encompass a broad understanding that all this will lead to a future of new information technology.Quantum information science and quantum information technology have seen a virtual explosion worldwide.

We suggest that this limitation is again mainly a technological one, because it is very difficult to create, manipulate and measure more complex quantum systems.Hitherto, nearly all experiments and also nearly all realizations in the fields just mentioned have been performed with qubits, which are two-level quantum systems.

We mainly focus on Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) states of photons and possible applications in quantum information protocols. Such states form discrete higher-dimensional quantum systems, also called qudits.

        <p>Photons are excellent for quantum communication as they can be transmitted over long distances with very low loss and without any known decoherence mechanism in free space 23 . A special property of photons is their orbital angular momentum 24 . Quantum mechanically, the orbital angular momentum occurs in discrete steps of c_, where c is an in principle unbounded integer. Therefore, high-dimensional quantum information can be stored in the orbital angular momentum of single photons. The fundamental property of photons carrying OAM is the presence of the helical phase factor e icf where ϕ is the azimuthal coordinate that is in the plane transverse to the propagation direction.Photons are excellent for quantum communication as they can be transmitted over long distances with very low loss and without any known decoherence mechanism in free space 23 .

        <p>A variety of spatial modes that carry OAM exist, sharing a helical phase factor but differing in their radial structure. The most prominent example, the Laguerre-Gauss mode LG c p , accurately describes a photon carrying an OAM of c_. Here, p is the radial quantum number. Figure 1 shows experimental images of single photons with different OAM values. The defining feature of LG modes is their spatial phase pattern. Specifically, the pattern is a helical phase that wraps around the axis of propagation c times within a wavelength, which results in a phase singularity at the beam center. Thus, the intensity profile of an LG mode shows the typical donut shaped structure. For single photons, the intensity profile gives the probability of detecting a photon at a certain point. If we place a triggered single-photon camera and detect many heralded photons 25 , then the intensity profile of the respective LG mode emerges, which is shown in the filmstrips in Figure 1. A few examples of higher order OAM modes, which can be used to encode high-dimensional qudit states, together with some exemplary superposition structures are shown in Figure 2.A variety of spatial modes that carry OAM exist, sharing a helical phase factor but differing in their radial structure.

        <p>The first and rather obvious benefit of qudits is the enlarged information content that a single quantum carrier can transmit. Any additional orthogonal state used in the encoding scheme increases the information encoded in a single quantum system. A simple example would be the use of ququarts, that is, four dimensional systems, which can be used to encode 2 bits of information: 0 j i ¼ 00; 1 j i ¼ 01; 2 j i ¼ 10 and 3 j i ¼ 11. The often used measure of information capacity, which is given in log 2 (d) bits/photon, can be seen as a measure of how many classical bits have to be used to be able to encode the same amount of information. In principle there is no upper limit of d (Except of a potential limit which arises due to the finite size of the universe), which means that a single quantum system, like a photon, has the potential to encode an arbitrarily large amount of information.The first and rather obvious benefit of qudits is the enlarged information content that a single quantum carrier can transmit.

It is important to note, that it does not matter if an actual eavesdropper had access or the errors were caused by strong noises. This feature of quantum cryptography holds for both entanglement based systems 28 as well as prepare-and-measure QKD schemes 29,30 . For qubit systems, this bound has been proven to be as low as approximately 11 or 12.6% if two or three mutually unbiased bases are taken into account, respectively [31][32][33] .

        <p>It was proven that after a clever randomized measurement at the receiver and a large enough Hilbert space, the monitoring of the signal disturbance can be neglected 36 , in contrast to other prepare-andmeasure protocols such as the seminal BB84 (Ref. 29).

        <p>John Bell showed in 1964 that the predictions of specific quantum mechanical measurements on qubits cannot be explained in a local realistic manner 3 . Local realism is the worldview in which physical properties of objects exist prior to and independent of the measurement, and physical influences are bounded by the speed of light. A violation of Bell's inequality (which have been demonstrated recently in a loophole-free way [37][38][39][40] ) shows that such a worldview can no longer be maintained in the face of experimental evidences.John Bell showed in 1964 that the predictions of specific quantum mechanical measurements on qubits cannot be explained in a local realistic manner 3 .

        <p>First generalizations to multilevel systems in the early 1980s by Mermin and Garg 41,42 showed that the conflict between local realism and quantum mechanics diminishes for larger dimensions. Interestingly, those results were interpreted as a necessary emergence of local realism in the classical limit, or a quantum-to-classical transition for large quantum numbers. A decade later, in 1992, Peres was able to show for the first time a violation of local realism that is constant for arbitrary large dimensions 43 . It took nearly another decade until Kaszlikowski et al 44 showed the first high-dimensional violation of local realism that is larger than those in two dimensions (a larger violation of Bell type inequalities means that the violation is more robust against noise). In Ref. 44 it is shown that the maximum tolerable noise, which still allows a violation of local-realism, increases with the dimension because the Bell inequality is stronger violated. Their numerical approach showed that for 3 ≤ d ≤ 9, Bell-type inequalities can be found where the violation of local realism increases as the dimension of the system increases. Soon afterwards, inequalities for violating local realism for arbitrarily high-dimensional systems were found by Collins and colleagues (often referred to as CGLMP inequality nowadays) 45 . While analytical results are still missing, numerical estimates suggest that the violations increase monotonically with the number of dimensions 44,46 .First generalizations to multilevel systems in the early 1980s by Mermin and Garg 41,42 showed that the conflict between local realism and quantum mechanics diminishes for larger dimensions.

        <p>The violation of local realism is not only interesting for fundamental reasons but has direct applications in quantum communication protocols. These advantages go beyond the more stringent cloning fidelities discussed in the Section of "Enhanced robustness against eavesdropping and quantum cloning". In entanglement-based QKD protocols, the presence of an eavesdropper is excluded by violating a local realistic inequality. As higher-dimensional systems allow for larger violations, those systems can supersede two-dimensional implementations of QKD. Analogous as before, one can imagine situations where qubits cannot be used to generate a secure key, whereas a high-dimensional system still enables to securely distribute an encryption key. We explain this now in two concrete examples.The violation of local realism is not only interesting for fundamental reasons but has direct applications in quantum communication protocols.

        <p>If the eavesdropper knows when the Bell measurement is performed, she would not look at those photons (to not disturb them), and only would look at the photons for the generation of the secret key. Therefore, the choice when the Bell measurement is performed has to be random. If the randomness is weak, the eavesdropper could still try to hide her appearance 48 . Above a certain threshold, weak randomness therefore prevents a secure quantum key distribution. Interestingly, because the violation of high-dimensional Bell inequalities can be much stronger than two-dimensional violations, the threshold of acceptable loss of randomness is significantly larger for high-dimensional systems. This leads to the situation where two-dimensional quantum key distribution (for instance, performed with polarization of photons) is hopeless while high-dimensional systems would still permit a secure channel 47 .If the eavesdropper knows when the Bell measurement is performed, she would not look at those photons (to not disturb them), and only would look at the photons for the generation of the secret key.

        <p>Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) requires the detection of a large fraction of the distributed entangled states. The smallest known fraction for closing the so-called detection loophole is 66.7%, based on the non-maximally entangled states as shown by Eberhard 49 . Reaching this bound is quite challenging for photons, and has only been exceeded in 2013 Refs 50,51. However, it was shown by Vertesi, Pirono and Brunner that for d = 4, the detection efficiency required for overcoming the detection loophole can drop by almost 5% to 61.8% (Refs 52,53).

In another approach Bocharov and colleagues investigate the Shor algorithm with qutrits, and find the promising result that qubits encoded in the slightly larger Hilbert space of a qutrit allow for a more efficient circuit structure than using natural qutrit gates 55 .

This process was employed in the first quantum entanglement experiment with OAM 56 and has been the workhorse for nearly all quantum experiments using OAM entanglement as one gets high-dimensional entanglement nearly for free. A stringent limitation, however, is that there are only very few methods to tune the parameters a c . These parameters decrease significantly for higher-order modes, as has been investigated in detail by Miatto et al 57 . Experimentally, it has been shown that by choosing the focusing parameters in an optimal way, one can increase the higher-order modes 58 , although not to a flat distribution. As an effect, the resulting entangled state is not maximally entangled. Although this state might be required for certain protocols (such as a highdimensional version of Hardy's ladder proof, which was recently investigated theoretically and experimentally to demonstrate entanglement 59,60 ) it often limits the usefulness of the entangled state in quantum experiments.where a c are coefficients that depend on the focusing parameters, phase matching conditions and crystal dimensions. This process was employed in the first quantum entanglement experiment with OAM 56 and has been the workhorse for nearly all quantum experiments using OAM entanglement as one gets high-dimensional entanglement nearly for free. A stringent limitation, however, is that there are only very few methods to tune the parameters a c . These parameters decrease significantly for higher-order modes, as has been investigated in detail by Miatto et al 57 . Experimentally, it has been shown that by choosing the focusing parameters in an optimal way, one can increase the higher-order modes 58 , although not to a flat distribution.

        <p>Another alternative approach that allows for the generation of arbitrarily, high-dimensional two-photon states has been recently proposed 64 . The idea is that the creation of a pair of photons occurs in a coherent superposition of several crystals. Between the crystals, the mode number, phase and amplitude can be adjusted arbitrarily. The generation of an arbitrary four-dimensional state is shown in Figure 3 as an example. In general, d crystals are pumped coherently such that one pair of photons is created in each crystal. As it is not known in which of the d crystals it is created, the state is in a coherent superposition of being created in either of them. The manipulation of the mode number and phase between the crystals allows for the creation of arbitrary two-photon entangled states for example, a d-dimensional Bell state. As only the Gaussian mode of the downconverted photons are used, the count rates of this method can be significantly larger than those for other schemes. The same method can also be used to create very general high-dimensional multipartite entangled states 64 with interesting connections to Graph Theory 65 . Interestingly, the method was discovered using a computer algorithm which automatically designs new quantum experiments 66 . 64 . Four crystals are pumped coherently and the paths of the down-converted photons are set to be identical. If the experimental conditions are such that there is, in principle, no information about the photon pairs origin (that is, in which of the four crystals it was created), then the pair is in a coherent superposition of being created in either of them. One can then manipulate the mode number and phase of the individual terms in the state. In this example, a hologram between each crystal shifts the mode by one and a phase of π/2 is added such that the resulting state is a four-dimensional Bell state c j i ¼ 1 2 0; 0 j iþ i 1; 1 j iÀ 2; 2Another alternative approach that allows for the generation of arbitrarily, high-dimensional two-photon states has been recently proposed 64 .

        <p>A second, more recent technique might be another promising candidate to realize general transformations on OAM states. It has been demonstrated that using controlled random scattering, that is, properly shaping the wavefront before a strong scattering process, sorting of arbitrary spatial mode structures (including radial p modes) can be achieved in a coherent way 69 . As such a task can be considered a complex transformation between OAM and paths, coherent transformations between different spatial modes are expected to be similarly feasible and are currently investigated. Improvements on the overall losses of the process as well as the possible limitation of mode transformations will be an important step in order to successfully apply this technique in quantum experiments.A second, more recent technique might be another promising candidate to realize general transformations on OAM states.

        <p>A promising application of high-dimensional OAM states is their use in quantum cryptography schemes. While many proof-of-principle experiments have been conducted successfully in laboratories around the world [80][81][82][83] , current research focuses on bringing the technology closer to real world applications by enlarging the distances over which secure keys can be distributed. Specially developed vortex fibers 84 might enable fiber networks that rely on OAM encoding, however, the implementation in quantum experiments has not been demonstrated yet. Moreover, expanding such networks to global distances might be facilitated via free space links. Here, qudits help to increase data rates as well as lower the requirements for correction of induced errors, both being strongly required in outdoor environments due to inherent losses and background noise. After recent successful tests of classical communication schemes using spatially structured light over distances of up to 143 km (Refs 85-89), first free-space quantum experiments using spatial structures have been performed. In the first of these experiments, photons entangled in their OAM degree of freedom have been sent over an intra-city free-space link over 3 km in Vienna 90 . While it was possible to demonstrate the survival of the OAM entanglement for photons up to c ¼ j2j, the quantum states were also only two-dimensional.A promising application of high-dimensional OAM states is their use in quantum cryptography schemes.

        <p>Recently, the first high-dimensional quantum states have been used to perform a free-space intra-city QKD experiment over 300 m in Ottawa (see Figure 4) 91 . Four-dimensional quantum states, that is, ququarts, were imprinted on heralded single photons using a combination of OAM and polarization. The photons were then transmitted from Alice to Bob following the standard highdimensional BB84-protocol 29 . Although moderate turbulence was observed, a coupling to single mode fibers, which is required to measure the received state, was achieved with up to 20% efficiency. More importantly, an uncorrected error rate of approximately 14% was found, corresponding to 0.39 bits per sifted photon, which is well below the threshold of 18% for ququarts. The additional transmission of the heralding photon from Alice to Bob and its usage to gauge time periods of weak turbulences has further improved the extracted key rate to 0.65 bits per sifted photon. On one hand, the results show that free-space QKD with spatially structured photons is feasible and highdimensional states can be superior to qubit encoding. On the other hand, they also indicate that the extension to larger distances as well as higher data rates will require the implementation of adaptive optics to compensate for the detrimental effects of atmospheric turbulences 92 . Hence, the next steps will be to develop appropriate compensation schemes, to test quantum states of higher dimensions, for example with pure OAM encoding, and distribute high-dimensionally entangled photons for large quantum networks. While all of these experiments have been performed at night, in 2002, it was shown how quantum key distribution can be performed during the day 93 . Very recently, a daytime quantum experiment has been performed over very loss-prone channels, indicating that even daytime satellite QKD might be possible 94 .

        <p>A recent experiment by Wang et al 112 has overcome this limitation for the first time, by showing the simultaneous teleportation of two degrees of freedom of a single photon. The basic idea behind the teleportation of multiple degrees of freedom is to successively teleport one degree after the other. In experiments so far, the incoming quantum state was destroyed during the teleportation, thus no second teleportation was possible. The clever way to get around this is to use a quantum-non-demolition measurement (QND). In this QND measurement, the quantum state is not destroyed and thus the remaining quantum information, which is stored in the other degrees of freedom, is still intact and can be teleported in the next steps. Interestingly, this QND itself is another teleportation protocol. Thus, the authors used teleportation itself as QND to enable the teleportation of a second degree-of-freedom of the particle. The measured fidelities F ¼ Trðr c j i c h jÞ between the experimentally teleported state ρ and the theoretically expected state c j i range from 0.68 ± 0.04 to 0.62 ± 0.04. The classical limit for optimal quantum state estimation of a pure state 115 is given by F cl opt d ¼ 4 ð Þ¼ 2 1þd ¼ 0:4, where d is the dimension of the system.

        <p>Although, for two-dimensional GHZ states a clear recipe to increase the number of particles exists, this does not hold for increasing the dimensionality. The authors utilized the computer algorithm MEL-VIN 66 to find an experimental setup to create a three-dimensional GHZ state c j i ¼ 0; 0; 0 j iþ 1; 1; 1 j iþ 2; 2; 2 j i ð Þ =O3. Despite the simple correlations present in this state, the actual experimental setup, depicted in Figure 7, is neither intuitive nor simple.Although, for two-dimensional GHZ states a clear recipe to increase the number of particles exists, this does not hold for increasing the dimensionality.

        <p>The main idea is to use two sources of three-dimensional entangled photon pairs and combine them in such a way that one trigger photon heralds the 3-dimensional GHZ state in the other three photons. If the two-photon pairs are emitted at the same time, the overall four photon state shows correlations between each of the 3 × 3 = 9 terms of the quantum state. These correlations are depicted in Figure 7b as red, green and blue lines. At first, there are nine connecting lines, while in the final three dimensional GHZ only three connections exist. Thus, six of the nine probability amplitudes need to be coherently suppressed in the experimental setup. This can be achieved with a three input and three output multiport. The detailed transformations of the multiport are given in Figure 7a. The basic idea behind the multiport is to utilize an even/odd OAM mode sorter 72 , a Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, Experiments like the ones described above will allow for the investigation of the strongest form of contradictions to local realism -namely, deterministic violations of local realism as introduced by GHZ 116 . Generalizing GHZ violations to higher dimensions have been surprisingly difficult and has only been achieved very recently [122][123][124][125] . Those constructions departure significantly from their two-dimensional counterparts, and it seems as if they would help to reveal the real nature of deterministic violations of local realism.The main idea is to use two sources of three-dimensional entangled photon pairs and combine them in such a way that one trigger photon heralds the 3-dimensional GHZ state in the other three photons.

        <p>Long-distance distributing high-dimensional OAM states The undisturbed distribution of high-dimensional quantum states is one of the most important tasks for applications to extend beyond laboratory proof-of-principle demonstrations. Here, two different approaches are presented, fiber and free-space transmission, each of which face their own individual challenges.Long-distance distributing high-dimensional OAM states The undisturbed distribution of high-dimensional quantum states is one of the most important tasks for applications to extend beyond laboratory proof-of-principle demonstrations.

        <p>A first step toward the fiber-based long-distance distribution of OAM states, has been achieved in developing a vortex fiber that transmits OAM states of light 84 . Although this fiber has been around for years, its implementation in a quantum optical setup is still yet to be demonstrated. Moreover, high-dimensional transmission is not possible, but two other approaches are conceivable: One approach would be carefully designing OAM multimode fibers, in which the modes are degenerate but do not couple to each other 126 . Another possibility is the fabrication of standard multimode fibers, in which intermodal coupling has to be pre or post-compensated or reduced by an appropriate choice of the modal set 127,128 (recently, up to 50 km (Ref. 129)). As each will have its own benefits and drawbacks it will interesting to be pursuit tested in laboratories as well as real-world scenarios.A first step toward the fiber-based long-distance distribution of OAM states, has been achieved in developing a vortex fiber that transmits OAM states of light 84 .

        <p>As described earlier, the second method of distributing OAM encoded qudits, namely free-space distribution, is already a step ahead. However, it is not a coincidence that the only qudit experiment was performed over a short distance (ququarts over a distance of 300 m (Ref. 91). While atmospheric turbulences might not completely destroy the transmitted state, even after 143 km (Ref. 89), it introduces considerable crosstalk between different modes, mainly due to beam wander and distortions. Therefore, adaptive optics for the correction of wave front distortions is indispensable and first steps are currently being developed 92 . A successful demonstration would allow for the expanding of the dimensionality of the state along with enlarging the distances over which they are distributed, maybe even between earthbased ground stations and satellites 23,114,130 .As described earlier, the second method of distributing OAM encoded qudits, namely free-space distribution, is already a step ahead.

        <p>So far, we have only discussed the OAM of photons. However, Laguerre-Gauss modes also have a second quantum number-the radial quantum number 131,132 , which can be used in quantum experiments 133,134 . It would be interesting to develop techniques to manipulate, detect and investigate the properties of the radial modes to enable their use in quantum communication experiments. The investigation of OAM modes in comparison with other modes would be interesting. It has been indicated that LG modes have lower crosstalk than HG modes in systems with finite apertures, thus suggesting a potential real-world advantage 135 . Do other mode families have different advantages? The self-healing properties of Bessel modes have been shown impressive results in the laboratory 136 . Can this apparent advantage also be exploited in real outdoor experiments? Do other, more complex beams have advantages in real-world quantum communication experiments-for example, Ince-Gauss modes 137 , which Multi-port trafos: A-C) of the multiport a different OAM mode À1 j i; 0 j i; 1 j iexits in a superposition of two different paths. The multiport consists of a reflections (R), spiral-phase-plate (SPP) that add a constant value of c ¼ 2, a mode sorter that sorts OAM modes according to their parity (even/odd), a 50/50 beam splitter (BS) and a coherent mode projection (CMP). (b) Graphical representation of the three dimensional GHZ state generation. If the two non-linear crystals emit a photon pair coherently at the same time, then there exist 3 × 3 = 9 probability amplitudes in total. These nine probability amplitudes are depicted by the red, blue and green connection lines. In the 1st step, the mode sorter eliminates all probability amplitudes between even and odd terms conditioned on the simultaneous detection of a photon in each detector. In the 2nd step, a Hong-Ou-Mandel two photon interference at the BS eliminates the green connection line between 1; À1 j i AB and À1; 1 j i CD . Finally, the last remaining unwanted connection line is eliminated by rerouting the incoming photons such that no simultaneous detection event in all detectors can occur. Photon A always exits the multiport in the D j i state and is therefore not entangled with the other three anymore. This leaves photons (B-D) in a three dimensional GHZ state.So far, we have only discussed the OAM of photons.

        <p>Another open challenge is to experimentally demonstrate highdimensional quantum teleportation and high-dimensional entanglement swapping in OAM. The experiment in the Section of "Quantum teleportation of multiple-degrees of freedom of a single photon" shows the simultaneous teleportation of two degrees of freedom of a single photon, but every degree of freedom is still two-dimensional. This problem is related to the question how to experimentally perform a higher dimensional Bell state measurement. A solution to this problem would not only allow to perform teleportation of high-dimensional quantum states encoded only in the OAM degree of freedom, but also enable other quantum protocols such as entanglement swapping, which is (together with reliable quantum memories) the key ingredient for quantum nodes in quantum networks 139 .Another open challenge is to experimentally demonstrate highdimensional quantum teleportation and high-dimensional entanglement swapping in OAM.

        <p>Stronger violations of quantum mechanical vs. local realistic theories Finally, we would like to point to an open theoretical question with significant conceptual and experimental implications. Is it possible to find Bell-or Mermin-like inequalities that are more robust against noise or detection inefficiencies in higher dimensions? The known advantages for the two-photon cases have been discussed in the Section of "Larger violation of local-realistic theories and its advantages in quantum communication" , but many questions remain open. Moreover, for high-dimensional multi-photon states, even less is known. The only known violations of local realism are weaker than those for two-dimensional systems [122][123][124][125] . In systems where both the number of photons as well as the number of dimensions is larger than two, asymmetric types of entanglement can exist 120,140,141 . There, the connection to violation of local realism and its applications in novel quantum protocols has not been investigated until now.Stronger violations of quantum mechanical vs. local realistic theories Finally, we would like to point to an open theoretical question with significant conceptual and experimental implications.

        <p>Within only a few years we have seen a tremendous progress in the capabilities of the generation, control and application of highdimensional quantum states with twisted photons. Among them, we have seen the first outdoor experiments distributing entanglement and high-dimensional quantum keys and we have witnessed the first generation of multi-photon entangled states and applications in quantum teleportation. These advances arose from technological progress but also from a close interaction between theory and experiment. For example, the demonstration of the novel advantages of high-dimensional systems in quantum cryptography or quantum computation are essential motivations for experiments; new theoretical classifications of multipartite high-dimensional entangled states hint to novel quantum protocols, and computer-designed experiments helping realize complex quantum states and protocols in the laboratories. We believe that the synergy between theorists and experimentalists will remain a key factor in the next few years.Within only a few years we have seen a tremendous progress in the capabilities of the generation, control and application of highdimensional quantum states with twisted photons.
