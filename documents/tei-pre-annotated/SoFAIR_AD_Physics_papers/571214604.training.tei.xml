        <p>Photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs) provide a standout platform for strong light-matter coupling with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) but have so far mostly been implemented as traditional all-dielectric metasurfaces with adjacent TMDC layers, incurring limitations related to strain, mode overlap and material integration. Here, we demonstrate intrinsic strong coupling in BIC-driven metasurfaces composed of nanostructured bulk tungsten disulfide (WS 2 ) and exhibiting resonances with sharp, tailored linewidths and selective enhancement of light-matter interactions. Tuning of the BIC resonances across the exciton resonance in bulk WS 2 is achieved by varying the metasurface unit cells, enabling strong coupling with an anticrossing pattern and a Rabi splitting of 116 meV. Crucially, the coupling strength itself can be controlled and is shown to be independent of material-intrinsic losses. Our self-hybridized metasurface platform can readily incorporate other TMDCs or excitonic materials to deliver fundamental insights and practical device concepts for polaritonic applications.Photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs) provide a standout platform for strong light-matter coupling with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) but have so far mostly been implemented as traditional all-dielectric metasurfaces with adjacent TMDC layers, incurring limitations related to strain, mode overlap and material integration.

        <p>Understanding and maximizing the interaction between light and matter in nanoscale materials is a central goal of nanophotonics. Resonant nanosystems have been investigated for the confinement and control of electromagnetic energy in sub-wavelength volumes, leading to breakthroughs in light harvesting 1 , optical waveguiding 2 and emission control 3 . Coupling light to electronic excitations in solid-state materials is of particular interest because of the creation of hybridized photonic and electronic states, called polaritons, showing exciting properties such as Bose-Einstein condensation 4 and superfluidity 5 with potential for applications in low-threshold semiconductor lasers 6 , photocatalytic enhancement 7 and quantum computing 8 . The driving force for research on excitonic coupling has been reaching the strong light-matter coupling regime, where coherent exchange of energy between photons and excitons takes place. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are a promising class of van der Waals materials for strong light-matter coupling, as they host strongly bounded excitons that are stable up to room temperature, owing to large binding energies &gt;200 meV (ref. 9), coupled valley and spin degrees of freedom and broad tunability through strain, dielectric environment and the DC Stark effect [10][11][12] .

        <p>Our design adopts a rod-type BIC unit cell geometry (Fig. 1a) with precise control over the asymmetry via the length difference ΔL 0 , spectral tunability via a multiplicative scaling factor S, high signal modulation and a spectrally clean mode structure. The WS 2 metasurfaces were numerically optimized to simultaneously obtain spectral overlap of the BIC resonances with the exciton, strong near-field enhancements and compatibility with nanofabrication tolerances. To capture the optical response of the WS 2 BIC metasurface with and without the influence of the exciton, we modelled the refractive index of WS 2 as a Tauc-Lorentz dielectric (Fig. 1b and Methods). We demonstrated the existence of a BIC on the low-energy side of the exciton with full-wave simulations and showed the capability to spectrally tune the BIC via the geometric scaling factor S (Fig. 1c), and to control the resonance linewidth with a varying asymmetry parameter ΔL 0 (Fig. 1d). At resonance, the electric near field εE, where ε is the permittivity of WS 2 or air, is concentrated inside the structure (Fig. 1e), leading to an enhancement of the light-matter interaction. To analyse the loss channels associated with the BIC modes, we employed a temporal coupled mode theory model to fit the simulated transmittance spectra. This approach allowed us to decompose the quality factors of the BICs into their radiative and intrinsic parts, where the radiative contribution shows the expected characteristic inverse square law with asymmetry. The intrinsic part incorporates all non-radiative loss channels such as material absorption, surface roughness or edge losses 35 and is described by our effective material parameters (Methods). Due to small losses in the material, the total Q factor is limited by the intrinsic quality factor, which leads to a deviation of the inverse square dependence. Additionally, the BIC-driven light-matter interaction is governed by critical coupling 36 , where the highest field enhancement is achieved when the radiative and intrinsic Q factors match (Fig. 1e,f).Our design adopts a rod-type BIC unit cell geometry (Fig. 1a) with precise control over the asymmetry via the length difference ΔL 0 , spectral tunability via a multiplicative scaling factor S, high signal modulation and a spectrally clean mode structure.

        <p>The fabrication process began with mechanical exfoliation of bulk WS 2 flakes onto fused silica substrates (Fig. 2a), with flake thicknesses ranging from 30 to 50 nm. The exfoliated WS 2 flakes were then patterned via EBL and RIE (Methods). Scanning electron microscope micrographs for different asymmetry parameters revealed the accurate reproduction of the metasurface design with high uniformity and surface quality (Fig. 2b). The transmittance spectra of the fabricated structures were measured in an optical spectroscopy setup. We illustrated the emergence of the BIC mode from the symmetric case by gradually increasing the asymmetry parameter ΔL 0 . The corresponding transmittance spectra (Fig. 2c) clearly show a spectral blueshift and linewidth broadening with increasing asymmetry and the extracted Q factors range from 20 to 370, with highest values found for the lowest asymmetries (Fig. 2d).The fabrication process began with mechanical exfoliation of bulk WS 2 flakes onto fused silica substrates (Fig. 2a), with flake thicknesses ranging from 30 to 50 nm.

Overall, we see excellent agreement between experimental and simulated results, although the radiative Q factor slightly deviates from the characteristic inverse square dependence of the BIC due to small uncertainties in the fits of the experimental spectra for low asymmetries caused by small signal modulations.As already seen in the simulations, the total Q factor is limited by the material-intrinsic absorption as well as scattering losses due to surface roughness and statistical variations 27 .

        <p>To demonstrate metasurface-based strong light-matter coupling, we tuned the BIC resonances over the WS 2 exciton wavelength at 629 nm (1.971 eV). The spectral tuning was achieved by fabricating 11 metasurface patches with an asymmetry parameter of ΔL 0 = 80 nm with scaling factors between S = 0.9 and S = 1.2 from a single WS 2 flake with a height of h = 45 nm. Transmittance spectra of the metasurface patches show clear anticrossing behaviour, which is a necessary feature of the strong coupling regime (Fig. 3a).

        <p>Recently, photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs) have been shown to provide excellent control over light-matter interactions, owing to their strongly enhanced near fields, high quality factors and broad resonance tunability via variation of their geometrical parameters.

        <p>Currently, many implementations of excitonic strong coupling with BICs rely on placing TMDC layers adjacent to BIC metasurfaces composed of traditional all-dielectric materials such as Si, TiO 2 , Si 3 N 4 or Ta 2 O 5 (refs. 17,28-31). However, this approach increases system complexity due to the direct contact between different material systems and inhomogeneities introduced during the TMDC transfer process, where topographic irregularities and strain in the TMDC layers can lead to spectral shifts of the exciton 32 or the suppression of non-linear effects 33 . Additionally, light-matter interaction occurs only via the evanescent fields around the BIC resonators, which decreases the coupling strength, especially when incorporating commonly used buffer layers for TMDCs, such as hexagonal boron nitride. Obtaining a TMDC BIC platform, which combines photonic cavity and excitonic material in the same nanostructured system, is therefore highly desirable; however, an experimental demonstration is still lacking.Currently, many implementations of excitonic strong coupling with BICs rely on placing TMDC layers adjacent to BIC metasurfaces composed of traditional all-dielectric materials such as Si, TiO 2 , Si 3 N 4 or Ta 2 O 5 (refs. 17,28-31).

        <p>By varying the lateral size of the metasurface unit cells, the BIC resonances are tuned across the WS 2 exciton, which reveals an anticrossing pattern with a Rabi splitting of 116 meV at ambient conditions, which is three times larger than the linewidths of the underlying excitonic and photonic resonances, propelling the system well into the strong coupling regime. Using the versatile resonance control afforded by the BIC concept, our experiments reveal a clear increase of the Rabi splitting with lower asymmetries, which we attribute to a complex interplay between radiative quality factor and mode volume.By varying the lateral size of the metasurface unit cells, the BIC resonances are tuned across the WS 2 exciton, which reveals an anticrossing pattern with a Rabi splitting of 116 meV at ambient conditions, which is three times larger than the linewidths of the underlying excitonic and photonic resonances, propelling the system well into the strong coupling regime.

        <p>On the other hand, we observe increased values of the Rabi splitting for lower asymmetries (Fig. 4c). This unique and previously unavailable tuning behaviour provides a new mechanism for tailoring the Rabi splitting using simple structural modification, and can thus enable the design of metasurface geometries with optimal ratio of resonance modulation to Rabi splitting in the strong coupling regime (Supplementary Fig. 6). For the lowest asymmetry of ΔL 0 = 20 nm, the BIC resonances are strongly damped by the intrinsic losses of WS 2 , and we can no longer resolve a clear peak splitting (grey shaded area in Fig. 4c). Furthermore, we plotted the Rabi splitting against the radiative Q factors of the BIC resonances without exciton from simulations and observed that both the Rabi splitting and the coupling constant g undergo a steep increase at low Q factors and saturate at higher Q factors (Fig. 4d). The observed trend is consistent with predictions from the literature, where the saturation of the Rabi splitting is attributed to the saturation of the electric field enhancement 39,40 . However, in comparison with idealized lossless dielectric BIC-driven metasurfaces, where the field enhancement scales with the square root of the Q factor (Supplementary Fig. 9i) and thus shows a saturating behaviour, the field enhancement of realistically modelled WS 2 BIC metasurfaces is governed by critical coupling, which is influenced by background losses in the material. At the spectral position of the exciton, maximum field enhancement is achieved for ΔL 0 = 110 nm (Fig. 4c) and shows an upward trend, which contrasts strongly with the downward trend of the Rabi splitting, implying that the Rabi splitting is independent of the electric near-field enhancement. This is also supported by additional simulations with lossless and lossy materials, showing identical Rabi splitting (Supplementary Fig. 9c,f).On the other hand, we observe increased values of the Rabi splitting for lower asymmetries (Fig. 4c).

        <p>In contrast, when changing radiative losses through a variation of the asymmetry parameter ΔL 0 , both the coupling strength and Rabi splitting follow the saturation trend described above, independent of intrinsic losses of the system, and the Rabi splitting reaches the value 2 g when the linewidths of BIC and exciton match (Supplementary Fig. 9j). This shows that the general coupling rules are still valid, but that these effects are negligible compared with the overall trend. Importantly, the coupling strength itself is modified by varying the radiative Q factor, showing that our TMDC BIC platform is able to directly control the coupling conditions in the system.In contrast, when changing radiative losses through a variation of the asymmetry parameter ΔL 0 , both the coupling strength and Rabi splitting follow the saturation trend described above, independent of intrinsic losses of the system, and the Rabi splitting reaches the value 2 g when the linewidths of BIC and exciton match (Supplementary Fig. 9j).

        <p>Therefore, we deduced that the coupling strength (Supplementary Fig. 9c,f) is indeed independent of the electric near-field enhancement (Supplementary Fig. 9d,g). Moreover, considering the constant excitonic density, our analysis identified an additional mechanism for changing the coupling strength by controlling the radiative loss channel. While intrinsic losses change the Rabi splitting because of a linewidth broadening of the BIC, eventually turning to the weak coupling regime, energy is dissipated from the resonator system through the radiative loss channel to the far field, which reduces the interaction time of the photons with the excitons for large asymmetry parameters, thus lowering the coupling strength.Therefore, we deduced that the coupling strength (Supplementary Fig. 9c,f) is indeed independent of the electric near-field enhancement (Supplementary Fig. 9d,g).

        <p>Even though the coupling strength itself is independent of any field-enhancing effect such as critical coupling, the population of the polariton branches is heavily influenced by it. When the radiative BIC quality factor is matched to both its intrinsic quality factor and the width of the exciton, the maximum absorbance for our system of 0.5 can be reached, which is known as strong critical coupling or polaritonic critical coupling 31 (Supplementary Fig. 10a-c). We numerically proved that this regime can be reached for our Tauc-Lorentz material with only small changes to the structure parameters of the BIC unit cell (Supplementary Fig. 10d).Even though the coupling strength itself is independent of any field-enhancing effect such as critical coupling, the population of the polariton branches is heavily influenced by it.

        <p>We have realized a self-hybridized WS 2 metasurface platform based on symmetry-protected BICs. We achieved resonances with total Q factors of up to 370 on the low-energy side of the exciton at wavelengths from 700 to 800 nm, demonstrating that exfoliated bulk TMDCs are an excellent material for all-dielectric nanophotonics owing to their high refractive index, low losses and mono-crystallinity. Moreover, we leveraged the precise control of the resonance position of the BIC mode via geometric variations to tune the BIC spectrally to the material-intrinsic excitonic resonance at 629 nm, leading to strong light-matter interaction and hybridization of photonic and excitonic where the WS 2 BIC mode is continuously tuned over the spectral location of the WS 2 exciton by varying the scaling factor using dielectric functions from the Tauc-Lorentz model with and without the exciton. By aligning the spectral location of BIC and exciton, both modes hybridize into polaritonic branches with higher and lower energies compared with their uncoupled ground states.We have realized a self-hybridized WS 2 metasurface platform based on symmetry-protected BICs.

        <p>modes. We experimentally resolved a clear anticrossing pattern of the exciton-polariton branches with a Rabi splitting of 116 meV at temperatures ranging from 5 K to room temperature. By varying the radiative Q factor of the BIC via the asymmetry factor of the BIC unit cell between ΔL 0 = 40 nm and ΔL 0 = 100 nm, we were able to tune the Rabi splitting in a linear fashion, where the highest Rabi splitting value was reached for the largest Q factors. We have further shown that the Rabi splitting is independent of the electric near-field enhancement, rendering the coupling conditions of our TMDC BIC platform independent of the material-intrinsic losses. Furthermore, because of the precise control over the radiative coupling conditions of the BIC to the far field, we can tune the coupling strength directly, which is facilitated through a complex interplay between mode volume and temporal field confinement via the radiative loss channel.modes.

        <p>Simulations were conducted with 
            <rs type="software">CST Studio Suite</rs>
            <rs type="version">2021</rs> using periodic Floquet boundary conditions and a plane-wave excitation polarized along the long axis of the rods with normal incidence angle. The WS 2 material data used throughout the paper were adapted from tabulated permittivity data for monolayer WS 2 from ref. 44 by fitting a Tauc-Lorentz model with four oscillators to represent the in-plane permittivity. We accounted for the spectral shift of the exciton and a reduction of oscillator strength for the bulk material by changing the corresponding values of the material and confirmed the correctness of simulation by comparing with results from optical characterization. This method allows a combination of a multitude of non-radiative loss channels, such as material absorption, surface scattering and the effect of nanostructuring on the exciton into an empirical permittivity model, yielding excellent experimental agreement while reducing computational complexity. The exact formulas and parameters can be found in Supporting Note 1. The out-of-plane permittivity was set to ε = 7 + 0i.

        <p>WS 2 flakes were transferred from bulk crystals (HQ Graphene) onto fused silica substrates via mechanical exfoliation. By controlling exfoliation parameters, such as the heat treatment temperature, exfoliation time and applied pressure, we optimized the yield of the flakes with thicknesses ranging from 30 to 50 nm to achieve an adequate area to host a multitude of BIC metasurfaces. The metasurface patches have a footprint of 35 × 35 μm 2 , which ensures a sufficient number of more than 50 × 50 unit cells for each scaling factor-a necessity to excite the collective BIC resonance with stable Q factor 45 . The substrates were treated with oxygen plasma to enhance the adhesion and the deposition took place at elevated temperatures of above 100 °C to remove moisture and to stretch out the tape used for exfoliation, which subsequently flattened the TMDC flakes to avoid shattering into small shards. Small mechanical pressure was applied during deposition. For alignment purposes, a marker system was fabricated onto the substrates via optical lithography (SÜSS Maskaligner MA6) before exfoliation. The height of the flakes was measured with a profilometer (Bruker Dektak XT) using a stylus with a radius of 2 μm, providing sub-nanometre resolution. A layer of PMMA 950k resist followed by Espacer 300Z was spin-coated onto the sample, after which the metasurface design was written into the resist via EBL (Raith ELine Plus). A gold hardmask was deposited with e-beam evaporation followed by a lift-off in Microposit Remover 1165. Finally, the design was etched into the flakes using RIE (Oxford PlasmaPro 100) with a SF 6 -based chemistry at a pressure of 20 mTorr and a radio frequency (RF) power of 50 W. The hardmask was removed in a solution of potassium monoiodide and iodine (Sigma-Aldrich).WS 2 flakes were transferred from bulk crystals (HQ Graphene) onto fused silica substrates via mechanical exfoliation.

        <p>The samples were characterized in a confocal optical transmission microscope with from-the-bottom illumination with collimated and linear polarized white light. The light was collected using a ×50 objective with a numerical aperture of 0.8, dispersed in a spectrometer with a grating groove density of 150 mm -1 and detected with a SI-CCD sensor. The low-temperature transmittance measurements were performed in a variable-temperature helium flow cryostat with a confocal microscope in transmission configuration. Thermal light from a tungsten halogen light source was used for excitation and was focused from-the-bottom into the sample. The light transmitted through the sample was collected using a ×20 objective with a numerical aperture of 0.4. A pinhole was used as a spatial filter in the detection path yielding a detection spot size of around 7 μm. The large footprints of the metasurfaces were leveraged to collect light only in the centre of the arrays, which mitigates edge effects and allows for optimal signal modulations. The collected light was analysed in a 500 mm spectrometer using a 150 grooves per mm grating and detected using a CCD sensor.The samples were characterized in a confocal optical transmission microscope with from-the-bottom illumination with collimated and linear polarized white light.
