        <p>The generation and use of GNSS analysis products that allow-particularly for the needs of single-receiver applicationsprecise point positioning with ambiguity resolution (PPP-AR) are becoming more and more popular. A general uncertainty concerns the question on how the necessary phase bias information should be provided to the PPP-AR user. Until now, each AR-enabling clock/bias representation method had its own practice to provide the necessary bias information. We have generalized the observable-specific signal bias (OSB) representation, as introduced in Villiger (J Geod 93:1487-1500, 2019) originally exclusively for pseudorange measurements, to carrier phase measurements. The existing common clock (CC) approach has been extended in a way that OSBs allowing for flexible signal and frequency handling between multiple GNSS become possible. Advantages of the proposed OSB-based PPP-AR approach are: GNSS biases can be provided in a consistent way for phase and code measurements and it is capable of multi-GNSS and suitable for standardization. This new, extended PPP-AR approach has been implemented by the Center for Orbit Determination in Europe (CODE). CODE clock products that adhere to the integer-cycle property have been submitted to the International GNSS Service (IGS) since mid of 2018 for three analysis lines: Rapid, Final, and MGEX (Multi-GNSS Extension). Ambiguity fixing is performed not only for GPS but also for Galileo. The integer-cycle property of between-satellite clock differences is of fundamental importance when comparing satellite clock estimates among various analysis lines, or at day boundaries. Both kinds of comparisons could be exploited at a very high level of consistency. Any retrieved comparison essentially indicated a standard deviation for between-satellite clocks from CODE of the order of 5 ps (1.5 mm in range). Finally, the integer-cycle property that may be recovered between the CODE Final clock and the accompanying bias product of consecutive daily sessions (using clock estimates additionally provided for the second midnight epoch) allows us to deduce GPS satellite clock and phase bias information that is consistent and continuous with respect to carrier phase observation data over two, three, or, in principle, yet more days. Phase-based clock densification from initially estimated integer-cycle-conform clock corrections at intervals of 300 s to 30 s (5 s in case of our Final clock product) is a matter of particular interest. Based on direct product comparisons and GRACE K-band ranging (KBR) data analysis, the quality of accordingly densified clock corrections could be confirmed to be on a level similar to that of "anchor" (300 s) clock corrections.The generation and use of GNSS analysis products that allow-particularly for the needs of single-receiver applicationsprecise point positioning with ambiguity resolution (PPP-AR) are becoming more and more popular.

        <p>Precise point positioning (PPP) is a well-established tool to enable single-receiver users to compute their receiver positions with an accuracy conforming to geodetic network standards (Zumberge et al. 1997;Kouba and Héroux 2001). More and more analysis centers of the International GNSS Service (IGS, Johnston et al. 2017) started to provide precise satellite orbit and "integer," or ambiguity-fixed clock products, usually along with information on phase biases, potentially enabling integer ambiguity resolution (IAR or briefly AR) for PPP users. The methods that have been developed over the last decade for the representation of clock and appropriate bias information, however, are manifold. We would like to refer here primarily to the contribution by Teunissen and Khodabandeh (2015), where a comprehensive overview and comparison of documented IAR-enabling representation methods are given.Precise point positioning (PPP) is a well-established tool to enable single-receiver users to compute their receiver positions with an accuracy conforming to geodetic network standards (Zumberge et al. 1997;Kouba and Héroux 2001).

        <p>Integer-ambiguity, or simply "integer" PPP (IPPP) is a synonym commonly used for IAR-enabled PPP. Within the IGS, PPP-AR (PPP with AR) is used as generic term addressing this particular refinement of PPP and its underlying analysis results. An essential feature of PPP-AR is that it is a relative technique where the single receiver is processed relative to the global network solution providing the satellite clock corrections. In the context of PPP-AR this means that the single-receiver users' integer phase ambiguities correspond in fact to double-differenced ambiguities (Teunissen and Khodabandeh 2015). PPP-AR, therefore, has to be considered an undifferenced analysis strategy that competes directly against traditional ambiguity-fixed doubledifference analysis. This is one reason why PPP-AR becomes a key tool for single-receiver users that are processing GNSS observation data originating from remote receivers.Integer-ambiguity, or simply "integer" PPP (IPPP) is a synonym commonly used for IAR-enabled PPP.

Until now, each AR-enabling clock/bias representation method had its own practice to provide the necessary bias information.

That is our motivation to proposing to use the OSB bias representation, as introduced in Villiger et al.

This finally enabled us to further extend the existing common clock (CC) approach in a way that OSBs allowing for flexible signal and frequency handling between multiple GNSS becomes possible. Further key benefits of the proposed PPP-AR bias description are: It is capable of multi-GNSS, easy to use, suitable for standardization, and it is incidentally relying on a GNSS bias data format officially approved by the IGS. A particular PPP-AR bias conditioning should finally become distinct when carrier phase as well as pseudorange bias data is considered simultaneously in the bias data interface as offered, e. g., by Bias-SINEX (Schaer 2018). Besides, the bias sign convention is a crucial question of detail we would like to address.A general uncertainty concerns the question on how the necessary phase bias information should be provided to the PPP-AR user.

        <p>The new, extended PPP-AR approach could be implemented by the Center for Orbit Determination in Europe (CODE, Dach et al. 2009), a joint venture of the Astronomical Institute of the University of Bern (AIUB, Bern, Switzer-land), the Swiss Federal Office of Topography (swisstopo, Wabern, Switzerland), the Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy (BKG, Frankfurt am Main, Germany), and the Institut für Astronomische und Physikalische Geodäsie of the Technische Universität München (IAPG/TUM, Munich, Germany).

The fact that single-receiver ambiguity resolution is being performed not only for GPS but also for Galileo can be seen as another milestone in terms of IGS analysis. In addition, the IAR-specific procedures in the various clock analysis lines of CODE are largely isolated and kept independent. This allows us to directly observe the exclusive impact of successful betweensatellite ambiguity fixing on CODE clock products in the operational comparisons and combinations of IGS legacy clock products.The new, extended PPP-AR approach could be implemented by the Center for Orbit Determination in Europe (CODE, Dach et al. 2009), a joint venture of the Astronomical Institute of the University of Bern (AIUB, Bern, Switzer-land), the Swiss Federal Office of Topography (swisstopo, Wabern, Switzerland), the Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy (BKG, Frankfurt am Main, Germany), and the Institut für Astronomische und Physikalische Geodäsie of the Technische Universität München (IAPG/TUM, Munich, Germany).

        <p>For the GPS constellation, integer-cycle clock results that are coming from three different analysis lines are at our disposal. We took this opportunity to recover their integer property and thus to examine their consistency among each other. An important step for the IGS toward the PPP-AR domain was made by Banville et al. (2020), where a preliminary combination of PPP-AR products from six IGS analysis centers over a 1-week period could be successfully achieved. This effort may be seen as a rigorous generalization of those comparisons we accomplished among the available analysis lines from our side. It should be noted that CODE contributed with its IGS Final analysis products to the mentioned IGS PPP-AR experiment. This paper shall help to make another step toward standardization in the PPP-AR domain by consistently relying on standards for OSB-based PPP-AR (as they should also apply to Bias-SINEX). Such a standardization has to be considered beneficial especially for all PPP-AR users, which thereby should get a common interface for standardized, easily applicable GNSS bias data that, moreover, may be expected to be consistent to existing IGS clock analysis products. The same should be valid for an IGS-combined integer clock/bias product that might eventually be strived for (Banville et al. 2020).For the GPS constellation, integer-cycle clock results that are coming from three different analysis lines are at our disposal.

        <p>The availability of consistent and continuous orbit and clock analysis products that are covering session lengths of 30 h or longer is a request that has been expressed for a long time from the analysis community of LEO-originated GNSS data (e. g., Bock et al. 2007).

        <p>The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the relevant observation equations and the transformational links between OSB and widelane/narrowlane fractional phase biases. Section 3 describes the algorithm we are proposing and highlights the necessary steps for generation of ambiguity-fixed clocks and consistent phase bias information. Section 4 gives an overview of CODE's improved IGS/MGEX clock analysis products that adhere to the integer-cycle property. Section 5 gives the basic equations for accessing the integer-cycle property of satellite clock estimates; it includes various validations and numerous comparisons, where this particular property could be accessed successfully; besides of that, Sect. 5 demonstrates that we are able to straightforwardly generate continuous integer clock information over three consecutive daily sessions and it finally addresses the question whether densification of clock corrections (by analyzing time differences of carrier phase observation data) is harmful for an ambiguity-fixed clock product. Section 6 summarizes the results in terms of method and implementation at CODE. A short supplementary guideline on how to use Bias-SINEX for the proposed OSB-based PPP-AR application is included as an appendix.The paper is organized as follows.

        <p>A primary precondition for all further considerations is that receiver clock (t k ) and satellite clock (t i ) corrections are assumed to be common for carrier phase and pseudorange code signals. Let us generally use B to describe a particular GNSS measurement bias. The bias is related to units of time. Typically, it needs to be estimated. In the following, bias parameters are all treated at a pseudo-absolute, undifferenced level, which, incidentally, is in complete agreement with the situation regarding clock offsets. Original dual-frequency GNSS measurements of carrier phase (L) and pseudorange code (P) signals expressed in units of length from station k to satellite i can be written as (Teunissen and Kleusberg 1998)A primary precondition for all further considerations is that receiver clock (t k ) and satellite clock (t i ) corrections are assumed to be common for carrier phase and pseudorange code signals.

These biases are assumed to get eliminated after between-satellite differencing. This basic assumption is generally satisfied. There are cases, however, where it is no longer appropriate to comply with this general constraint. Such cases basically may happen as soon as signal observable types get involved that are different among a particular pair of observed satellites (and thus have to be considered potentially "unequal" in terms of their bias characteristics). This means that the bias elimination assumption may become wrong when phase or code signal observable types get mixed among each other:Receiver biases, B L 1 k , B L 2 k , B P 1 k , B P 2 k , were specified in Eq.

        <p>In order to assess how relevant iterations are for the IARrelevant processing loop (cf. Fig. 2), consisting of -clock estimation and -phase bias determination and IAR (internally substituted by the autonomous PPP-AR procedure), we conducted a corresponding test analysis where we performed this loop up to 10 times. We could recognize that alterations in any descriptive parameter became marginal very rapidly after few iterations. For PPP-AR, the most prominent break could generally be observed between iteration 1 (still based on ambiguity-float clocks) and iteration 2 (for the first time ever based on ambiguity-fixed clocks). Specifically, the post-fit rms of unit weight became significantly smaller for the narrowlane AR PPP solutions. The standard deviation of narrowlane ambiguity fractionals also became considerably reduced as of iteration 2, whereas the total number of resolved narrowlane ambiguities got increased by only a few percent after iterating. This increase in percentage of resolved ambiguities is actually in line with the reduced rms of unit weight afterward. In the end, by crosschecking the solution vectors of resolved ambiguity integers across iterations (in particular between iterations 1 and 2), no differences could be revealed for in common resolved ambiguities. This first experiment therefore showed that our ambiguity-float clocks of iteration "0" (while consistently applied in conjunction with the underlying ambiguity-fixed orbits adopted from a double-difference analysis and with adequately determined phase biases) already allow for a reliable narrowlane AR. In the interest of speeding up, performing the ambiguity resolution loop for an operational processing just once is quite sufficient.In order to assess how relevant iterations are for the IARrelevant processing loop (cf.

        <p>For this reason, we asked ourselves whether satellite clocks at intervals of 30 sec are indispensable for the PPP-AR procedure (dashed red line in Fig. 2) or whether we could proceed with a narrowlane AR done on the basis of decimated (300-sec) clocks (solid red line in Fig. 2). It is obvious that by conducting clock densification just once (instead of twice) clock analysis could be accelerated to a notable extent. Please note that widelane AR (being independent from orbit and clock information) is done only once, generally using 30-sec observation data. Primarily due to the fact that formal errors of narrowlane ambiguity parameters (and consequently corresponding confidence intervals for statistical testing associated with AR) become larger due to reduced data sampling (here by a factor of √ 10 compared to the "regular" case), the success rate of resolved narrowlane ambiguities becomes accordingly slightly smaller for the "decimated," but ultimately "faster" case. Once more, the correctness of the solution vector of resolved ambiguity inte-gers turned out to remain unaffected by this short cut. This means that satellite clocks with limited sampling are sufficient for single-receiver narrowlane AR. This allows us to follow the solid red line in Fig. 2 for any clock analysis line.For this reason, we asked ourselves whether satellite clocks at intervals of 30 sec are indispensable for the PPP-AR procedure (dashed red line in Fig. 2) or whether we could proceed with a narrowlane AR done on the basis of decimated (300-sec) clocks (solid red line in Fig. 2).

        <p>This experiment was dedicated to investigate numerical differences between a clock product following our clock/bias representation (CC-OSB) and a clock product following the integer recovery clock (IRC) strategy as realized by Laurichesse et al. ( 2009), Loyer et al. (2012). We could manage such an experiment easily by just disregarding the (fractional) narrowlane bias term, c B i j L N , in Eq. ( 9) for computation of ambiguity-fixed clock parameters (t i ). In our case, this is achieved by redefining B i L N := 0. Note that narrowlane AR was completed in the usual manner beforehand. It is obvious that resulting IRC-like satellite clock parameters thus de facto correspond to integer clocks, t i N , we introduced in the context of Eq. ( 13). It is worth mentioning that, in our case, (fractional) narrowlane bias values (b i L N as well as B i L N ) may be expected in our case to be minimized according to Eq. ( 17). Numerical differences for satellite-to-satellite clock differences, t i j N , between CC-OSB results (reduced according to Eq.

        <p>For GPS, the reproducibility is evaluated at a level of about 0.005 cyc for small time lags. It is finally increasing with increasing time lag (to around 0.03 cyc for a lag of 30 days). For Galileo, the reproducibility level is a little bit higher compared to that of GPS (at about 0.01 cyc), but almost independent of the time lag. This generally confirms that Galileo widelane phase biases are highly stable in time. However, this must also be put into perspective right away because phase bias discontinuity events seem to occur much more frequently for Galileo. Whereas, for GPS, the reproducibility as represented by the red curve (1 day lag) usually gets minimal, the light blue curve (associated with a lag of 10 days) tends to be lowest in case of Galileo. This is an interesting detail since the Galileo satellites repeat their ground track patterns every 10 days. Because the corresponding period is 1 day for GPS, this might be a contribution to the better performance of daily estimated biases for GPS.For GPS, the reproducibility is evaluated at a level of about 0.005 cyc for small time lags.

Whereas, for GPS, the reproducibility as represented by the red curve (1 day lag) usually gets minimal, the light blue curve (associated with a lag of 10 days) tends to be lowest in case of Galileo. This is an interesting detail since the Galileo satellites repeat their ground track patterns every 10 days. Because the corresponding period is 1 day for GPS, this might be a contribution to the better performance of daily estimated biases for GPS.</p>

        <p>We have noticed in Sect. 3.2 that the actual GNSS satellite clock estimation (Fig. 2) is done at CODE-as for many other analysis centers-for principal epochs every 5 minutes (from 00:00 up to 23:55). Assuming that the geometrical, in particular orbital, information is given, an efficient algorithm developed at CODE comes into play where epochdifferenced phase observations of an arbitrarily selectable, global tracking (sub)network are analyzed for clock densification. Simultaneous consideration of corresponding phase epoch-differences allows on the one hand a reliable phase data screening and finally a phase-specific determination of clock epoch-differences, which are then fed to an interpolation between given "anchor clocks." In this way, the mentioned algorithm allows to generate high-rate clock corrections within reasonably short time and with sufficient accuracy (Bock et al. 2009).

        <p>Having a closer look at Fig. 12, it should become obvious that clock densification turns out to be generally an interpolation for all intervals from 1 up to n -1, with the exception of the last interval n, which turns out to be an extrapolation.

        <p>6 Summary and conclusions6 Summary and conclusions</p>
        <p>We have introduced a new, innovative approach for describing satellite bias parameters for PPP with ambiguity resolution (PPP-AR). The existing common clock approach, in particular "CC-1" as introduced in Teunissen and Khodabandeh ( 2015), has been extended in a way that OSBs (observable-specific signal biases) allowing for flexible signal and frequency handling between multiple GNSS becomes possible. Strictly speaking, the OSB approach, which was initially applied exclusively to pseudorange measurements (Villiger et al. 2019), has been appropriately generalized to also include carrier phase measurements with resolved ambiguities. Our experiences and especially those of first test users show that the usage of a consistently prepared OSB product should be straightforward for OSB-based PPP-AR. This is particularly useful as both phase and pseudorange bias values can be delivered in a consistent manner-and ultimately to multiple PPP-AR-enabled GNSS concurrently. Another key benefit is that it is suitable for standardization. The exchange of OSB values is incidentally also supported by a GNSS bias data format (Bias-SINEX) officially approved by the IGS. With this contribution, we are providing a thorough description of the CC-OSB clock/bias methodology and guidance on how the related OSB-based PPP-AR application works. Against this background, we also have addressed the sign issue with regard to associated (satellite) OSB values. Essential is that the same sign convention should hold for bias values related to pseudorange measurements and for bias values related to phase measurements (actually independently of whether they are specific to satellites or specific to receivers). The set of undifferenced observation equations we initially specified in Eq. ( 1) for an arbitrarily chosen set of dual-frequency GNSS observations (L 1 , L 2 , P 1 , P 2 ) represents the basis for the entire mathematical formalism. For a PPP-AR user, Eq. ( 1) is, in essence, the only relevant formula, as it unambiguously tells how the required bias information (as suggested directly for the nominal observations, i. e., L 1 , L 2 , P 1 , P 2 ) has to be applied. The basic assumption that all phase observations on a frequency are aligned (independent of their phase modulation) is common to that made for double-difference AR. It should be noted that this specific assumption is dictated by the PPP-AR product provider to the PPP-AR user (via accordingly conditioned phase bias information).We have introduced a new, innovative approach for describing satellite bias parameters for PPP with ambiguity resolution (PPP-AR).

        <p>The new, extended PPP-AR approach could be implemented and thoroughly tested at CODE. CODE clock products that adhere to the integer-cycle property have been submitted to data centers of the IGS since 3 June 2018 (since 17 June 2018 in case of MGEX). All of our IGS clock analysis lines have been upgraded accordingly: (Early-and Final-) Rapid, Final, and MGEX. They cover up to five GNSS (GPS/GLONASS/alileo/BeiDou/QZSS). Single-receiver ambiguity fixing (considering satellite differencing) could be incorporated successfully not only for GPS but also for Galileo. This applies in particular to our contribution to MGEX and, after a corresponding enhancement with Galileo to a triple GNSS, also to our IGS Rapid solutions (since 22 September 2019). Galileo PPP-AR in an operational mode, as originally announced in Schaer et al. (2018), is an achievement that can be seen as another milestone in terms of IGS analysis. An interesting detail regarding Galileo AR is that we could recognize an effect of the ground track repetition period of Galileo satellites (of 10 days) in our widelane phase bias results generated daily for Galileo.The new, extended PPP-AR approach could be implemented and thoroughly tested at CODE.

        <p>The new CODE clock products reveal a notably improved quality and, in the end, allow for PPP-AR (with up to two AR-enabled GNSS). Each clock product (Clock-RINEX) should to be used in conjunction with the accompanying phase and pseudorange bias product (Bias-SINEX) in order to achieve best possible performance. They are conditioned in such a way that maximum consistency can be ensured for ambiguity-float, ambiguity-fixed, and pseudorange-supported PPP applications. Certainly worth mentioning is the fact that we were able to show that a temporal resolution of 24 h is sufficient for phase bias parameters when relying on the CC-OSB approach. This is not entirely surprising, however, because in the IRC approach the total fraction of narrowlane phase biases ends up in the epochestimated satellite clock corrections, and in our approach, there is probably still a small portion which is still capable of absorbing small fluctuations in L 1 and L 2 phase biases. CODE clock products are generally provided with a high data rate (30 seconds or higher). The CODE Final clock product covers even a higher data rate (5 seconds) and also provides data for the second midnight (24:00) epoch. Corresponding 24:00-epoch data, however, is not yet included in the CODE Final clock product files submitted to the IGS data centers. The IGS should open up the possibility to include the second midnight epoch (00:00 and 24:00) in orbit and clock product submissions. We believe that allowing this additional epoch would actually be very beneficial (specifically considering the needs of PPP-AR), and the rules for use should be simple and clear (cf. Sect. 5.5).The new CODE clock products reveal a notably improved quality and, in the end, allow for PPP-AR (with up to two AR-enabled GNSS).

        <p>The integer-cycle property of between-satellite clock differences is of fundamental importance when comparing satellite clock estimates among various analysis lines, or at day boundaries. We have repeatedly shown that the integer property of CC-OSB clock and bias products can be easily recovered. The basic equation describing the relation between "common" (or CC-compatible) satellite clock corrections and "integer" (or IRC-compatible) satellite clock corrections is simple and even works with undifferenced clock and OSB bias values (cf. Eq. ( 14)). Both kinds of comparisons could be exploited at a very high level of consistency, specifically at 7-8 ps standard deviation for GPS. For Galileo, satellite clock estimates predicted for the second midnight epochs revealed between-satellite clock misclosures at a level of 12 ps, which also attests the high stability of Galileo passive hydrogen clock masers. Any retrieved comparison essentially indicated a standard deviation for between-satellite clocks from CODE of the order of 5 ps (1.5 mm in range). Our quality assessment is by the way in line with an STD estimate (4.6 ps) as reported in Banville et al. (2020) for a specific example day, where (partly experimental) integer-property clock and bias products from a total of six IGS analysis centers were compared and finally combined-ultimately keeping the integer nature of the resulting GPS clock and associated bias products. It should be noted that we contributed with our operational IGS Final product line to this promising IGS PPP-AR case study.The integer-cycle property of between-satellite clock differences is of fundamental importance when comparing satellite clock estimates among various analysis lines, or at day boundaries. We have repeatedly shown that the integer property of CC-OSB clock and bias products can be easily recovered. The basic equation describing the relation between "common" (or CC-compatible) satellite clock corrections and "integer" (or IRC-compatible) satellite clock corrections is simple and even works with undifferenced clock and OSB bias values (cf. Eq. ( 14)). Both kinds of comparisons could be exploited at a very high level of consistency, specifically at 7-8 ps standard deviation for GPS.

        <p>The integer-cycle property that can be recovered between the CODE Final clock and the accompanying bias product of consecutive daily sessions (using clock estimates additionally provided for the second midnight epoch) allows us to deduce GPS satellite clock and phase bias information that is consistent and continuous with respect to carrier phase observation data over two, three, or, in principle, yet more days. Linking of the clock/bias products over consecutive days is simplified by the long-arc orbit modeling strategy as pursued at CODE. Consideration of corrections of the radial orbit for the purpose of a reliable narrowlane AR (of residual cycles) is in fact no longer necessary when linking consecutive daily clock solutions from CODE.The integer-cycle property that can be recovered between the CODE Final clock and the accompanying bias product of consecutive daily sessions (using clock estimates additionally provided for the second midnight epoch) allows us to deduce GPS satellite clock and phase bias information that is consistent and continuous with respect to carrier phase observation data over two, three, or, in principle, yet more days.

        <p>We have presented three different validations, which all confirm that densification of clocks (based on time differences of high-rate phase data) is not harmful and thus may be approved for an ambiguity-fixed clock product. Another conclusion we could draw is that the use of any high-rate (preferably ambiguity-fixed) clock product for densification of another poorly sampled integer-property clock product must be seen as a feasible solution. This applies to densification of GPS clocks within 5-minute intervals, but especially for an additional densification within 30-second intervals. Also, we have learned that such a further densification is not needed for Galileo clocks. An interesting detail is that the short-term prediction method we used to generate 24:00epoch Galileo clocks has finally revealed results that can be viewed as almost perfect in terms of the error budget.We have presented three different validations, which all confirm that densification of clocks (based on time differences of high-rate phase data) is not harmful and thus may be approved for an ambiguity-fixed clock product.

        <p>A direct comparison with GRACE K-band ranging (KBR) measurements was aimed for to assess the quality of the high-rate clocks of the CODE Final product. To achieve this, a reprocessing was accomplished on the basis of an adapted processing procedure that is fully conform to that of the operational CODE Final clock analysis. This dedicated reprocessing effort, made for a complete month (April) of 2007, has also shown that our advanced clock estimation procedure is well capable to cope with older data. The gain in GRACE KBR residuals' data scattering after ambiguity fixing, from about 18.2 mm down to 3.8 mm STD, is comparably pronounced for the LEO-based kinematic PPP analysis scenario as it was investigated here.A direct comparison with GRACE K-band ranging (KBR) measurements was aimed for to assess the quality of the high-rate clocks of the CODE Final product.

        <p>The core modules for the PPP-AR enhancement at CODE were designed and implemented to cope with multiple GNSS. First tests have been carried out already in 2018 involving other GNSS, specifically BeiDou and QZSS, to verify the technical implementation. These first tests were very promising and, among other things, revealed an interesting detail regarding QZSS. At that time, QZSS consisted of only one satellite. Due to this circumstance, we were reminded that the described methods essentially also work in the case of a single-satellite constellation. This means that the indices "i j" that we used to designate a pair of satellites or, more generalized, a satellite-to-satellite difference, actually denote different satellite paths or different ambiguity arcs. On the other hand, this means that such a "single difference" may as well refer to one particular satellite only. It was reassuring for us to see that this was ensured in our test scenario with QZSS. Regarding multi-GNSS, it is important to emphasize that we consider generally one set of epoch-specific receiver clock parameters (strictly following the "CC" idea), but in combination with receiver biases (which are treated constant over 24 h) to intercept systematic differences among two or more GNSS involved (see, e. g., Villiger et al. 2019).The core modules for the PPP-AR enhancement at CODE were designed and implemented to cope with multiple GNSS.

This specific rule actually allows a PPP-AR product provider to exclude selected satellites from AR and, finally, to report that (by refusal to provide individual OSB phase bias records) to PPP-AR users so that those could also omit affected satellites for their AR actions. However, this should only be permitted in clearly justifiable exceptional cases."No phase bias, no (PPP-)AR."

        <p>Is the Bias-SINEX data format (Schaer 2018) suitable to serve the PPP-AR application? The answer is clearly yes. Phase as well as code biases required for PPP-AR may be appropriately described for any clock analysis product conforming to a common clock (CC) assumption. Let us establish Eq. ( 1) as a basis for the PPP-AR terminology to be used in consideration of Bias-SINEX. In view of Eq. ( 1), the use of the observable-specific signal bias (OSB) representation is compelling for both phase and code bias information. To have all associated bias values generally provided in units of time (typically in nanoseconds) shall be a strong recommendation on top of that. Figure 15 shows a Bias-SINEX V1.00 file excerpt with data content supporting OSB-based PPP-AR. It gives an impression on how the required OSB code and phase bias data records (shown here for three arbitrarily selected satellites of the GPS constellation) may look like. We would like to emphasize that the rules listed below actually only refer to the OSB bias description we are proposing for the PPP-AR application. These rules are therefore actually independent of a specific data exchange format.Is the Bias-SINEX data format (Schaer 2018) suitable to serve the PPP-AR application? The answer is clearly yes.
