        <p>The Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey is one of the largest contemporary spectroscopic surveys of low-redshift galaxies. Covering an area of ∼286 deg 2 (split among five survey regions) down to a limiting magnitude of r &lt; 19.8 mag, we have collected spectra and reliable redshifts for 238 000 objects using the AAOmega spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. In addition, we have assembled imaging data from a number of independent surveys in order to generate photometry spanning the wavelength range 1 nm -1 m. Here we report on the recently completed spectroscopic survey and present a series of diagnostics to assess its final state and the quality of the redshift data. We also describe a number of survey aspects and procedures, or updates thereof, including changes to the input catalogue, redshifting and re-redshifting, and the derivation of ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared photometry. Finally, we present the second public release of GAMA data. In this release we provide input catalogue and targeting information, spectra, redshifts, ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared photometry, single-component Sérsic fits, stellar masses, Hα-derived star formation rates, environment information, and group properties for all galaxies with r &lt; 19.0 mag in two of our survey regions, and for all galaxies with r &lt; 19.4 mag in a third region (72 225 objects in total). The database serving these data is available at http://www.gama-survey.org/.</p>
        <p>Large galaxy surveys, in particular those with a spectroscopic component, have undoubtedly played a major role in driving our understanding of both cosmology and galaxy evolution over the last decade or so. For example, in cosmology the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS; Colless et al. 2001Colless et al. , 2003) ) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000;Alam et al. 2015) demonstrated convincingly that the description of large-scale structure formation provided by the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm is remarkably accurate (e.g. Peacock et al. 2001;Percival et al. 2001;Tegmark et al. 2004;Cole et al. 2005;Eisenstein et al. 2005;Percival et al. 2007). As a result of this success, large spectroscopic galaxy surveys are now a well-established tool in cosmology, as evidenced by the large number of completed, ongoing and planned projects that are seeking to further explore the cosmological information encoded in the large-scale distribution of galaxies, such as e.g. the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey (Drinkwater et al. 2010), the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS; Dawson et al. 2013) or the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX; Hill et al. 2008), to name but a few.</p>
        <p>Large galaxy surveys have also been a driving force in the field of galaxy evolution, although for a different reason. While large-scale structure formation appears well understood, our theoretical understanding of the growth of structure on galaxy scales is less mature. The enormous range of mass and time scales involved in capturing the gas physics, and the complex interplay between dark matter, stars, gas, dust and active galactic nuclei (AGN) preclude the development of a fundamental, comprehensive understanding of galaxy formation and evolution based on first principles. Instead, we must resort to approximate models that capture this complexity only to some level. Although much progress has been achieved in the physical modelling of galaxy evolution using both semi-analytic techniques (e.g. Bower et al. 2006;Guo et al. 2011) and, most recently, full hydrodynamical simulations (Vogelsberger et al. 2014;Schaye et al. 2015), advances in this field are to a E-mail: jliske@eso.org significant extent driven by observationally exploring the physical properties of galaxies, their inter-dependencies and their evolution with time (e.g. Blanton &amp; Moustakas 2009). Large surveys allow us to systematically study galaxies at different cosmological epochs as a function of key parameters, such as dynamical, stellar and gas mass, environment, present and past star formation, stellar and gasphase metallicity, size and other structural parameters, morphology, dynamical state, nuclear activity, dust content, etc. Past results have shown that much of this information is indeed required in order to identify and disentangle the various processes responsible for the evolution of galaxies (e.g. Mo et al. 2010).</p>
        <p>The Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA)foot_0 survey aims to test the CDM model of structure formation and to study galaxy evolution by exploiting the latest generation of ground-based and space-borne, wide-field survey facilities. GAMA is bringing together data from eight ground-based facilities and four space missions in order to comprehensively survey the low-redshift galaxy population. At the heart of this project lies the GAMA spectroscopic survey of ∼300 000 galaxies to r &lt; 19.8 mag over ∼286 deg 2 (split between five survey regions), mainly conducted with the 2dF/AAOmega facility (Saunders et al. 2004;Smith et al. 2004;Sharp et al. 2006) on the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). In addition, we have coordinated with, and/or negotiated data sharing agreements with a number of independent imaging survey teams, conducted our own observing campaigns, and processed data from publicly available sources (see Table 4 below) in order to construct a unique multi-wavelength dataset covering all major galaxy constituents (i.e. young and old stellar populations, ionized and neutral interstellar medium, AGN and dust).</p>
        <p>The main scientific goals that specifically motivated the GAMA spectroscopic survey include:</p>
        <p>(i) The measurement of the dark matter halo mass function (HMF) down to 10 12 M : since the HMF depends solely on the cosmological parameters, the nature of gravity, and the dark matter particle mass, with negligible dependence on baryonic physics, it represents a fundamental, robust and precise prediction of the CDM model (e.g. Springel et al. 2005). A measurement of the HMF thus amounts to a clear-cut, reliable test of the CDM structure formation model in the non-linear regime.</p>
        <p>(ii) Probing star formation efficiency and feedback: the properties of the galaxy population within a dark matter halo depend not only on the halo's mass but also on baryonic processes. Most galaxy formation models incorporate feedback in order to account for the known variation of star formation efficiency as a function of halo mass (e.g. Bower et al. 2006;De Lucia et al. 2006). By invoking different kinds of feedback for low-mass and high-mass haloes (typically supernova and AGN feedback, respectively) these models predict a peak in the stellar-to-halo mass ratio at approximately the mass of the Local Group. GAMA will characterise this peak and thereby improve our understanding of feedback mechanisms.</p>
        <p>(iii) A comprehensive measurement of the recent galaxy merger rate: the hierarchical assembly of massive structures is a key feature of the CDM structure formation paradigm (e.g. White &amp; Rees 1978;White &amp; Frenk 1991). The build-up of dark matter haloes through repeated mergers of smaller units is one of the principal modes of growth in this model (e.g. Fakhouri &amp; Ma 2010), and dark matter halo merger rates are accurately predicted by simulations (e.g. Fakhouri et al. 2010). Although galaxy merger rate predictions are less accurate (e.g. Hopkins et al. 2010), limiting the testability of the CDM structure formation model by merger rate observations, GAMA merger rate measurements will also be used to constrain the extent to which mergers are driving various aspects of galaxy evolution: the build-up of stellar mass in galaxies, in particular in today's giant elliptical galaxies (e.g. De Lucia et al. 2006), morphological transformations (e.g. Toomre 1977;Cox et al. 2006;Hopkins et al. 2009), triggering (e.g. Hopkins et al. 2013;Patton et al. 2013) and truncating (e.g. Hopkins et al. 2008) star formation, fuelling central supermassive black holes (e.g. Di Matteo et al. 2005;Ellison et al. 2011), and structural and size evolution (e.g. Naab et al. 2009).</p>
        <p>GAMA stands in the tradition of the SDSS, the 2dFGRS and their predecessors. Whereas the 2dFGRS essentially 'only' provided redshifts and fluxes in two (photographic) bands, the SDSS added high-quality spectroscopic data and 5-band optical CCD imaging and photometry, drastically increasing the available information for each galaxy, and resulting in a wealth of physical insights into the low-redshift galaxy population. GAMA builds on this by adding: (i) 2 mag in the depth of the spectroscopic survey, thus probing solidly into the dwarf regime and allowing a much more robust determination of a galaxy's environment; (ii) much higher spectroscopic completeness for pairs, groups and clusters of galaxies, important for halo mass and merger rate determinations; (iii) a factor of ∼2 higher resolution in the optical and near-infrared (NIR) imaging (from VST and VISTA), thus giving reliable access to the internal structure of galaxies; (iv) photometric measurements over the wavelength range 1 nm -1 m. As mentioned above, the latter two points are achieved in cooperation with a number of other independent imaging surveys (see Table 4).</p>
        <p>The motivation and science case of GAMA was explained in more detail by Driver et al. (2009). The input catalogue and target selection, including survey masks, star-galaxy separation, and target prioritisation was presented by Baldry et al. (2010), while the tiling algorithm was described by Robotham et al. (2010). The data reduction and spectroscopic analysis was presented by Hopkins et al. (2013), and Driver et al. (2011) provided a description of survey procedures and of the first three years of GAMA data. Aperture-matched optical and NIR photometry of GAMA galaxies based on processed SDSS and UKIDSS LAS imaging data was introduced by Hill et al. (2011), while Kelvin et al. (2012) performed two-dimensional single-component Sérsic model fits to the surface brightness distributions of GAMA galaxies using the same data (see also Häußler et al. 2013). Taylor et al. (2011) used these photometric measurements, in particular the aperture-matched optical photometry, to derive stellar masses. Cluver et al. (2014) obtained mid-infrared photometry for GAMA galaxies from reprocessed WISE data. Finally, the environment of GAMA galaxies was characterised by Brough et al. (2013) using galaxy number surface density, while Robotham et al. (2011) presented the GAMA Galaxy Group Catalogue (G 3 C; see also Alpaslan et al. 2012).</p>
        <p>The above have been used, inter alia, to derive the broad-band (Loveday et al. 2012(Loveday et al. , 2015) ) and Hα (Gunawardhana et al. 2013) luminosity and stellar mass (Baldry et al. 2012;Gunawardhana et al. 2015) functions, to consider the luminosity and stellar mass functions split by Hubble type (Kelvin et al. 2014a,b) and in different environments (McNaught-Roberts et al. 2014;Eardley et al. 2015), to determine the effect of mergers on the stellar mass function (Robotham et al. 2014), to study variations and dependencies of the galaxy initial mass function (Gunawardhana et al. 2011) and of the star formation rate (SFR; Wijesinghe et al. 2012), and to investigate satellite galaxies (Prescott et al. 2011;Schneider et al. 2013), the effect of the local environment on L * galaxies (Robotham et al. 2013), the relations between stellar mass, metallicity and (specific) SFR (Foster et al. 2012;Lara-López et al. 2013;Bauer et al. 2013), and the cosmic spectral energy distribution (Driver et al. 2012).</p>
        <p>In addition, GAMA provides the basis for numerous followup projects (in particular of group galaxies), and even serves as a stepping stone for other large, independent survey projects such as the SAMI Galaxy Survey (Bryant et al. 2014;Allen et al. 2014).</p>
        <p>Although it is generally considered good practice to pursue only a single purpose with any given paper, the intention of the present paper is in fact fourfold. Accordingly, it consists of four main sections, each of which may be read somewhat independently of the other three. First, in Section 2 we supplement the earlier technical papers on the GAMA spectroscopic survey cited above by reporting on updates to various survey procedures and methods, and by describing some procedures not yet covered at all by previous GAMA publications. This includes descriptions of the updated input catalogue and of the procedures we use to measure redshifts.</p>
        <p>Second, in Section 3 we report on the recent completion of the GAMA spectroscopic survey and present its end product. We describe the progression of the survey, evaluate and discuss its observing efficiency, and present various diagnostics that characterise the final dataset, with a particular view towards its redshift completeness and the quality of the redshifts.</p>
        <p>In Section 4 we then move on from the spectroscopic to the photometric side of GAMA. In this section we provide an updated description of our procedure for deriving aperture-matched optical and NIR photometry from processed SDSS and UKIDSS LAS imaging data of the GAMA survey regions, and we describe for the first time our method of measuring ultraviolet (UV) fluxes from GALEX imaging data. This section, too, thus represents a supplement to the previous technical GAMA papers on the subject cited above.</p>
        <p>Finally, following the first public data release described by Driver et al. (2011), we present the second public release of GAMA data (DR2) in Section 5, which comprises a large fraction of the spectroscopic data from the first three years of observations as well as a wealth of ancillary data. We end with a summary in Section 6.</p>
        <p>Table 1. Overview of the GAMA survey regions. The southern G02 and G23 regions were not part of GAMA I. The last column provides the magnitude limits of the second data release described in Section 5.</p>
        <p>RA range (J2000) Dec. range (J2000 From 2013 onward the observations focused on the high-priority sub-region north of -6.0 deg. b The original RA range of the G23 region was 338.1-351.9 deg but this was revised in 2014.</p>
        <p>c Originally the magnitude limit of the G23 region was the same as for the other regions but it was changed from an r-band limit of 19.8 mag to an i-band limit of 19.2 mag in 2014.</p>
        <p>In this section we report on various aspects, procedures and methods of the GAMA spectroscopic survey that have either changed significantly since they were first described, or that have not yet been described at all in previous GAMA publications. This comprises a description of the updated input catalogue and target selection (Section 2.1), our procedures for deriving redshifts (Sections 2.3-2.6), an update of our procedure to incorporate data from previous spectroscopic surveys into the GAMA survey (Section 2.7), and a description of additional observations of a small number of very bright targets using the Liverpool Telescope (Section 2.8).</p>
        <p>Following the first three years of survey operations (2008 February -2010 May, see Driver et al. 2011) the GAMA spectroscopic survey on the AAT was substantially expanded, resulting in a number of significant changes to the GAMA input catalogue (IC) and target selection. Here (and in other GAMA publications) the term 'GAMA I' refers to the data collected during these first three years, and to all data products that can be traced back to the original version of the IC (called InputCatAv05). In contrast, the term 'GAMA II' refers to the entire GAMA dataset, including all GAMA I and all subsequently collected data, and all data products that can be traced back to the revised version of the IC (InputCatAv06 for the equatorial survey regions, see below).</p>
        <p>The GAMA I survey extended over three equatorial survey regions of 48 deg 2 each (called G09, G12 and G15) and down to extinction-corrected Petrosian magnitude limits of r &lt; 19.4 mag in G09 and G15, and r &lt; 19.8 mag in G12, as well as z &lt; 18.2 mag and KAB &lt; 17.6 mag, selected from SDSS DR6 (Adelman-McCarthy et al. 2008) and UKIDSS LAS data. The NIR photometry was also used to improve on the standard SDSS star-galaxy separation. See Baldry et al. (2010) for the full details of the GAMA I IC and target selection.</p>
        <p>For GAMA II we implemented the following main changes to the IC and the target selection: (i) the three existing equatorial survey regions were enlarged from 12 × 4 to 12 × 5 deg 2 ; (ii) two new survey regions were added in the south (called G02 and G23); (iii) in the equatorial survey regions the target selection switched from using SDSS DR6 to DR7 (Abazajian et al. 2009) photometry, and we created new input catalogues for the G02 and G23 regions from SDSS DR8 (Aihara et al. 2011), CFHTLenS (Heymans et al. 2012), KiDS (de Jong et al. 2013) and VIKING (Edge et al. 2013) photometry, respectively; (iv) the r-band Petrosian magnitude limit was set to 19.8 mag for all survey regions; in G23 this was later revised to an i-band limit of 19.2 mag; (v) the z and K-band selections were abandoned. In addition, the NIR photometry required for the improved star-galaxy separation mentioned above was only partially available for the extensions of the equatorial regions, and not at all for G02. Despite these changes, all objects identified as targets in GAMA I (in the original survey regions) were retained as targets in GAMA II for consistency.</p>
        <p>Table 1 provides an overview of the main changes. More details about these changes and the input catalogues used for selecting targets in the new southern regions G02 and G23 will be presented by Robotham et al. (in preparation) and Moffett et al. (in preparation).</p>
        <p>In addition to the changes to the main survey, we have also changed the selection of 'filler' targets (cf. section 3.7 of Baldry et al. 2010). The purpose of the filler targets was to maximise the scientific output of the survey by providing useful targets even in cases where an AAOmega fibre could not be assigned to a main survey target, either due to physical fibre placement restrictions, or, towards the end of the survey, due to the scarcity of unobserved main survey targets. Various samples of filler targets have been defined over the course of the survey, including radio, optical, far-infrared and X-ray selected samples, as well as targets randomly selected for duplicate observations. The latter sample will be used extensively when assessing the quality of our redshift data in Section 3.4, the others will be detailed in future data releases.</p>
        <p>Our tiling, fibre placement, observing and data reduction procedures have not changed significantly compared to the descriptions provided by Robotham et al. (2010), Driver et al. (2011) and Hopkins et al. (2013). The only differences are that we began using dark frames in 2010 November, and that we are now using the latest version (v5.35) of the data reduction software 2DFDR (Croom et al. 2004;Sharp &amp; Birchall 2010) provided by the AAO. Note that, in order to ensure the consistency of the data reduction, we re-reduce the entire GAMA II dataset whenever a new version of 2DFDR is released.</p>
        <p>In this section we describe the procedure by which we measure the redshift, z, of a given spectrum using the code RUNZ. A summary of this process was already provided by Driver et al. (2011) but here we describe the procedure in full.</p>
        <p>As we will see below, RUNZ has a number of undesirable features which motivated the development of a new and improved redshifting code, AUTOZ (Baldry et al. 2014; see also Section 2.4). AUTOZ proved to be superior to RUNZ in every way (see Section 3.4), and so the AUTOZ redshifts were adopted as the default for GAMA II in 2013. However, DR2 and many of the GAMA publications to date are based on the RUNZ redshifts, and so we feel it is still important to fully document our RUNZ procedures.</p>
        <p>All GAMA spectra obtained at the AAT (excluding sky spectra) were 'redshifted' by one of the observers at the telescope either on the same night they were observed or the next day or night. As described by Driver et al. (2011) and Hopkins et al. (2013), the observations of a 2dF/AAOmega field and the subsequent data reduction process result in a file containing all of the fully reduced, sky-subtracted and telluric absorption-corrected spectra of that field (346 spectra on average). The process of redshifting an observation involves running the program 
            <rs type="software">RUNZ</rs> (developed by Will Sutherland, Will Saunders, Russell Cannon and Scott Croom; see also Saunders, Cannon &amp; Sutherland 2004) on this file, meaning that all spectra of a given field are redshifted by the same person.
        </p>
        <p>For each spectrum RUNZ attempts to identify a redshift in two different ways: (i) by cross-correlating it with a range of template spectra, including spectra of star-forming, E+A and quiescent galaxies (five templates), QSOs (five templates), and A, K and M stars (four templates); and (ii) by fitting Gaussians to emission lines (after having interpolated over strong sky lines) and searching for multi-line matches, adopting the best-guess single line redshift if no multi-line match is found. Having thus identified a number of possible redshifts, a best redshift is automatically chosen from among these based on the strengths of the cross-correlation peaks and the number and significance of any identified emission lines. Except for the most extreme emission line galaxies this procedure usually results in the best cross-correlation redshift being chosen as the overall best redshift.</p>
        <p>RUNZ then proceeds by presenting the operator with a plot of the spectrum being redshifted (along with various diagnostic plots), marking the positions of common nebular emission and stellar absorption lines at the best automatic redshift. This redshift is then checked visually by the operator. This check is unfortunately necessary because the cross-correlation redshift is frequently led astray by imperfections in the data reduction. If the redshift is deemed incorrect, the operator may interactively use a number of methods to try to find the correct one. These methods include checking the redshifts obtained from the cross-correlations with the various template spectra, checking all possible emission line redshifts, and roughly identifying a redshift visually, marking it crudely, and then fitting absorption and emission lines at the corresponding positions. A free-format comment can also be attached to the spectrum.</p>
        <p>Once satisfied, the operator concludes this process by assigning a (subjective) quality, Q, in the range 0-4 to the final redshift, where Q = 4 signifies a certainly correct redshift, 3 a probably correct redshift, and 2 a possibly correct redshift requiring independent confirmation. Q = 1 indicates that no redshift could be identified at all, while a value of 0 flags spectra that are seriously flawed, in the sense of a complete data reduction failure. A pure noise spectrum, without any continuum or emission lines, but not displaying any obvious data reduction issues, is assigned Q = 1, not 0. By assigning Q 3 the operator consents to having this redshift included in scientific analyses, and thus the distinction between Q = 2 and 3 is clearly the most important one. Note that for Q 1 the value of the recorded redshift is meaningless. Note further that for values 2, Q refers to the (subjective) quality of the redshift, not of the spectrum. In particular, it is sometimes possible to confidently identify a redshift even in a (partially) damaged spectrum (usually from multiple strong emission lines). In these cases, too, Q refers to the confidence in the redshift.</p>
        <p>Once Q has been assigned, RUNZ moves on to the next spectrum, and the above process is repeated until all spectra of the field being processed have been redshifted.</p>
        <p>Among the final sample of GAMA II spectra we find the fractions of spectra receiving Q = 4-0 to be 62, 20, 11, 8 and 0.1 per cent, respectively.</p>
        <p>From the above description it is clear that the process of redshifting with RUNZ is not fully automated, instead involving significant human interaction, in particular in the assignment of a redshift quality. In total, no fewer than 56 GAMA team members have contributed to the redshifting during observations. These redshifters have a wide range of experience and differ in their abilities to (i) verify the correctness of a given redshift; (ii) find a difficult-to-spot redshift; (iii) not be fooled by spectral features of non-galaxian origin. Most importantly, the quality assigned to a redshift is quite subjective and depends strongly on the experience of the redshifter. These are clearly undesirable features and a fully automated process for determining the redshifts and their reliability, as e.g. implemented by the SDSS, would be preferable. This motivated the development of the aforementioned code AUTOZ (see Section 2.4). Until this code became available in 2013, however, we had to resort to an elaborate double-checking process of our RUNZ redshifts in order to mitigate the effects described above.</p>
        <p>In an effort to confirm or reject redshifts initially classified as 'probable' or 'possible', to weed out mistakes and, most importantly, to homogenise the quality scale of our redshifts, a significant fraction of our sample has thus been 're-redshifted' independently. Re-redshifting has been carried out 'off-line' (i.e. not at the telescope during observing runs) by volunteering team members in three separate re-redshifting campaigns. Each of these campaigns approximately covered the data collected during the year prior to its launch (2009August, 2011April, 2012 February). Thus almost all of the data collected up to 2011 May (i.e. 3.5 years of observations) have been subjected to re-redshifting. We now describe this process in detail.</p>
        <p>Selection of spectra for re-redshifting First of all, we only consider spectra of main survey targets for re-redshifting. Since the spectra of filler targets (cf. Section 2.1) are generally more difficult to redshift than those of main survey targets, and since we are interested in optimising our procedures for the main survey only, spectra of filler targets (or of flux calibration stars) are not included in the re-redshifting.</p>
        <p>All spectra of main survey targets for which the redshifts were initially assigned a Q value of 1, 2 or 3 are selected for reredshifting. In addition, in each 2dF/AAOmega field we select a random sample of 5 per cent of spectra with initial Q = 4 redshifts. Since an entire field is initially redshifted by a single person, this selection ensures that not only a global fraction of 5 per cent of spectra with Q = 4 redshifts are re-redshifted, but 5 per cent of each initial redshifter's Q = 4 redshifts. Finally, for each redshifter involved in a given re-redshifting campaign (including both initial redshifters and redshifters from previous re-redshifting campaigns) and for each Q value 1 we select a random sample of 20 spectra for self-checks where possible.</p>
        <p>Assignment of spectra to re-redshifters On average, 28 volunteers participated in each of the re-redshifting campaigns (including team members that had not previously observed and had hence not done any initial redshifting). The spectra selected for reredshifting in a given campaign are assigned to the available volunteers in the following way.</p>
        <p>All spectra with Q = 1 or 2 redshifts are assigned to two reredshifters, so that these spectra are redshifted three times in total. Spectra with Q = 3 or 4 redshifts are assigned to one re-redshifter. For Q = 1 or 4 re-redshifters are selected randomly, but for Q = 2 or 3 we attempt to pick re-redshifters that are 'better' than the original redshifter, the idea being that there is little value of having an inexperienced person re-examine a spectrum that an experienced redshifter was doubtful about. A strict implementation of this idea, however, would have placed an unmanageable burden on experienced redshifters. Thus we chose a scheme where the probability of a given spectrum being assigned to a particular re-redshifter depends on the relative 'quality' of the initial redshifter and the reredshifter: this probability is equal for re-redshifters that are 'better' than the initial redshifter but decreases linearly for re-redshifters that are 'worse'. The metric used in comparing redshifters is the probability of correctly identifying redshifts (see below) as derived from earlier re-redshifting campaigns. 2Spectra selected for self-checks are obviously assigned to the initial redshifter for re-redshifting.</p>
        <p>On average, ∼1100 spectra were assigned in this way to each volunteer in each past re-redshifting campaign.</p>
        <p>Re-redshifters are asked to provide an independent estimate of the redshift and of its quality of each of the spectra assigned to them. To this end they are only given the information which spectra have been assigned to them, but not why these spectra were selected for re-redshifting or what the original redshift and Q were.</p>
        <p>The actual redshifting is done using the same code and procedures as for the initial redshifting described above, except of course that RUNZ is now run on individual spectra (retrieved directly from the GAMA team database) and not on an entire field.</p>
        <p>From the above it should be clear that the results provided by the re-redshifting are 'independent' of the initial redshifting results only in a very limited sense. The same data (modulo any changes to the data reduction that may have been applied in the meantime) and the same code are being used, hence the 'independence' of the results solely refers to that aspect of the redshift measurement process that requires human interaction.</p>
        <p>Upon completion of a re-redshifting exercise the new data are combined with all existing redshift data, i.e. with those from the original redshifting as well as with those from any previous re-redshifting exercises. We now ask how this combined dataset should be used in order to achieve our goals. In the most naïve approach we could simply assume that any redshift that is confirmed by the reredshifting must be correct. If two different redshifts are found for the same spectrum, however, then we would have no way of knowing which of these, if either, is correct and hence would be forced to discard both (although a third 'opinion'foot_4 might help in deciding). In this simplistic approach it is also not clear how to use the additional information encoded in the Q values attached to the redshifts, how to account for the different levels of ability and experience of the many redshifters, or how to create a homogenised quality scale. Clearly, this approach does not use all of the available information.</p>
        <p>Instead, we now develop a probabilistic approach which enables us to quantify the probability of a given redshift being correct. The underlying assumption of our approach is that the process of redshifting a given spectrum can be viewed as a multinomial process in which the redshifter attempts to identify the correct redshift from a set of possible redshifts. The idea is then to use the re-redshifting data to measure the probability of correctly identifying a redshift as a function of redshifter and Q. From these probabilities we can then calculate the probability that a given redshift is correct, taking into account all of the available opinions as well as the reliabilities of those who offered them. For example, if two redshifters, i and j, independently find the same redshift for a given spectrum, we can calculate the increased probability (compared to having either only i's or only j's opinion) of this redshift being correct from i, j, Qi and Qj. Similarly, if their redshifts disagree this lowers the probabilities of either i's or j's value being correct. This can be generalised to an arbitrary number of agreeing or differing opinions. Furthermore, this method allows us to unambiguously identify the 'best' (i.e. most probably correct) redshift (or else that no redshift can be determined) for every spectrum. This allows us to statistically treat all spectra in the same way, even those that have not been re-redshifted at all. Finally, for every best redshift our method provides us with a homogeneous measure of confidence which we can use to decide whether to accept this redshift for scientific analyses or not.</p>
        <p>We emphasise that in this context we use the word 'correct' in a very narrow sense. The re-redshifting data do not allow us to determine the probability of a redshift being correct in any absolute sense (although this can be achieved by referring to duplicate observations of the same object, see Section 3.4). We can only determine the probability that other people with similar training, given the same data and code, will identify the same redshift. A 'correct' redshift in this sense is simply the most popular one.</p>
        <p>While having to make this distinction is of course in general an undesirable feature, it does have one advantage: it allows us to ignore the (small) complication that would otherwise be introduced by targets that are in fact two unresolved objects at different redshifts. While the spectra of these targets may well display two real redshifts, we will nevertheless be able to assume in the following that there is only one 'correct' (i.e. most popular) redshift.</p>
        <p>We now describe our method of using the re-redshifting data to measure the probability of 'correctly' identifying a redshift (in the above sense) as a function of redshifter and Q, i.e. p(i, Q) where i = 1 . . . NRS is an index identifying redshifters, of which there are NRS. The general idea is to consider the 'agreement fractions' among pairs of redshifters, i.e. the fraction of spectra for which the opinions of two redshifters agree. We will model these fractions in terms of the sought-after parameters p(i, Q), and then fit this model to the observed values of the agreement fractions. Readers not interested in the details of this process may wish to skip ahead to the results, as shown in Figs. 2 and3 and discussed in the accompanying text.</p>
        <p>We begin by considering all spectra with at least two Q 2 opinions. 4 For all of these spectra we identify all pairs of opinions of the same spectrum where both opinions have Q 2, and sort these into groups according to the originators (i and j) and Q values (Qi and Qj) of these opinions, such that each group is uniquely identified by the tuple (i, Qi, j, Qj). Following the last reredshifting campaign we have 5824 such groups, containing a total of 54 733 opinion pairs which involve 92 902 individual opinions of 43 765 unique spectra from NRS = 55 redshifters. The large number of these groups is of course a consequence of the way in which we assign spectra to re-redshifters (see above), which guarantees a high degree of 'intermixing' of redshifters. Indeed, of the 3NRS = 165 possible (i, Q) combinations (Q can take on 3 different values here), 155 are cross-checked by more than 10 other redshifters, and the median number of cross-checking redshifters for each combination is 32. However, in many cases the number of opinion pairs in each group is of course quite small. It ranges from 1 to 251, but the distribution is strongly skewed towards small values, with a mean and median of 9.4 and 4 pairs, respectively.</p>
        <p>In each group we then determine the fraction of opinion pairs where the redshifts agree with one another. Whether two redshifts agree or not is determined using all available Q 2 opinions of that spectrum and a one-dimensional friends-of-friends method with a generously large linking length of ∆z = 0.0035, chosen after inspection of the full ∆z distribution of all Q 3 opinion pairs. The redshift agreement fractions fz are then modelled by:</p>
        <p>(1)</p>
        <p>The second term on the right-hand side accounts for the possibility of both i and j being 'wrong' and yet identifying the same ('wrong') redshift, where the parameter pa denotes the probability of such 'accidental' agreement. The value of pa is not negligibly small because in practice there is only a finite number of plausible redshifts to choose from. For reasons described below we somewhat arbitrarily set pa = 0.2 but note that the exact value of this parameter has little effect on the final results. So far we have only considered Q 2 opinions because of the qualitative difference between the meanings of Q values 2 and greater (in which case at least some redshift has been identified) and values of 1 and 0 (in which case no redshift could be identified and 4 In the following we will disregard all opinions with Q 2 and z &gt; 0.9. Almost all of these opinions are of spectra showing broad emission lines. These spectra are obviously very different from those of our main survey targets for which we wish to optimise our procedures, and hence the highredshift opinions are excluded.</p>
        <p>the reported value of the redshift is entirely meaningless). Adopting a procedure similar to the one described above we can ask what the binomial probability of a given redshifter is to 'correctly' identify a spectrum as not yielding any redshift at all (where we again use the word 'correct' in the sense described above).</p>
        <p>To derive these probabilities, p(i, Q = 1), from the reredshifting data, consider all opinion pairs of redshifters i and j (where both opinions of a given pair of course refer to the same spectrum). Let us denote the number of such pairs by nij. Now further consider that sub-set of i, j pairs where j assigned Qj = Q, and let us denote the number of these pairs by nij(Qj = Q). If j assigned Q values completely randomly, we would expect the fraction of these pairs in which i assigned Qi = 1 to be independent of Q and equal to the total fraction of pairs in which i assigned Qi = 1:</p>
        <p>(2) However, j does not assign Q values randomly of course, and we expect the left-hand side of the above equation to be smaller for larger Q. So how do we modify the right-hand side to reflect this dependence on Q? Clearly, if i assigns Qi = 1 and j assigns Qj = Q 2 either i or j or both of them must be 'wrong' (in the sense discussed above). If j assigns Qj = Q = 1 then either both are 'right' or both are 'wrong'. The modulation factor to be applied to the right-hand side of equation ( 2) above must therefore be proportional to</p>
        <p>when Q 2, and</p>
        <p>when Q = 1. Rearranging equation (2) to define</p>
        <p>we thus find</p>
        <p>where cij is a proportionality constant. f1(i, j, Q) is simply the fraction of i's Qi = 1 opinions among j's Qj = Q opinions, relative to i's total fraction of Qi = 1 opinions. In Fig. 1 we sketch the behaviour of f1 as a function of Q.</p>
        <p>While the constant cij could in principle be determined from the 'integral constraint':</p>
        <p>its presence in the model is clearly an inconvenience. Note, however, that for Q = 1 the left-hand side of equation ( 6) above is symmetric in i and j, and that P (i, j, 1) is also symmetric. This means that cij must also be symmetric in i and j. cij thus cancels out in all 'auto'-ratios of the form f a 1 (i, j, Q1, Q2) ≡ f1(i, j, Q1) f1(i, j, Q2) = P (i, j, Q1) P (i, j, Q2)</p>
        <p>as well as in all 'cross'-ratios of the form</p>
        <p>(see Fig. 1 for a visualisation of these ratios). In other words, the above ratios only depend on p(i, Q) and p(j, Q), including the sought-after parameters p(i, 1) and p(j, 1). We can therefore use the observed f a 1 and f c 1 ratios to constrain the p(i, 1) values. Note that each redshifter pair yields (at most) six independent data points: although we can compute up to four f1(i, j, Q) and four f1(j, i, Q) values, two of these are identical by construction [f1(i, j, 1) = f1(j, i, 1)], and given any six values the seventh can be determined from the integral constraint of equation ( 7) above. Therefore, of the 27 possible f a,c 1 ratios (cf. Fig. 1) only six are independent. Any appropriately chosen group of six should yield the same results. For simplicity we choose to use the three f a 1 (i, j, Q, 1) and the three f a 1 (j, i, Q, 1) ratios (where Q 2). Dubbing these the 'normalised class 5 disagreement fractions', f cl (see Fig. 1), we find:</p>
        <p>As described above, these are modelled by:</p>
        <p>To summarise, we use the (re-)redshifting data to derive the sought-after probabilities p(i, Q) to 'correctly' identify a redshift (Q 2) or to 'correctly' identify a spectrum as not yielding a redshift (Q &lt; 2) by fitting the model of equations ( 1) and ( 12) to all of the observed fz and f cl simultaneously.</p>
        <p>Before we can perform the fit, however, we need to estimate errors for the various fractions above. We use Bayes' theorem with a uniform prior to estimate 68 percentile confidence intervals from the posterior distributions which, in general, are asymmetric around the measured values. These errors are robust even when the fractions are based on small number statistics and/or are close to 0 or 1, as is frequently the case. The asymmetry of the errors is taken into account during the fit.</p>
        <p>The p(i, Q) values that result from the fit are shown in Fig. 2 as a function of redshifter and Q. Note that we arbitrarily chose to order the redshifters along the abscissa according to their p(i, 3) values, which causes the apparently regular behaviour of these values as a function of redshifter. The redshift data used for this fit comprise all currently available data, i.e. from the original redshifting and from all three re-redshifting exercises carried out so far. Fig. 2 clearly reveals the different abilities and/or different meanings the various redshifters have attached to the Q values (note that it is generally not possible to distinguish the two), underlining the importance of the re-redshifting process. Gratifyingly, almost all p(i, 4) values lie at 0.95. For several redshifters their p(i, 3) values are the same as their p(i, 4) values to within the errors, meaning that these redshifters essentially did not distinguish between Q = 3 and 4. Others clearly made a distinction while still maintaining high p(i, 3) values. However, there are also some redshifters 5 The term 'class' refers to the distinction between Q &lt; 2 and Q 2.</p>
        <p>. Sketch illustrating various ratios discussed in the text. The blue squares and red circles show f 1 (i, j, Q) and f 1 (j, i, Q), respectively, as a function of Q. f 1 (i, j, Q) is the fraction of i's Q i = 1 opinions among j's Q j = Q opinions, relative to i's total fraction of Q i = 1 opinions among all i, j opinion pairs. By construction, we have f 1 (i, j, 1) = f 1 (j, i, 1).</p>
        <p>The f 1 values are observables that could, in principle, be used to constrain the parameters we are after, i.e. all p(i, 1). However, our model for f 1 [equations ( 3)-( 6)] contains an inconvenient proportionality factor. It turns out, though, that this factor only depends on the pair of redshifters i, j (or j, i), and is thus the same for all points shown in the figure. By taking ratios of these quantities (indicated by arrows) we thus eliminate the inconvenient constant. We label ratios of same-coloured points as 'auto'-ratios, those of differently coloured points as 'cross'-ratios. In total there are 27 such ratios, of which only six are independent. We choose to use those six ratios that have f 1 (i, j, 1) = f 1 (j, i, 1) as the denominator, and label these f cl .</p>
        <p>whose p(i, 3) values are clearly inconsistent with the definition of Q = 3 as a 'probably' correct redshift to be accepted for scientific analyses. On the other hand, almost all redshifters did make a very clear distinction between Q = 3 and 2, reflecting the important distinction between the definitions of these values (i.e. whether the redshift is to be accepted for scientific analyses or not). Note that for several redshifters we find p(i, 2) &lt; 0.5. This does not necessarily indicate worse-than-random performance because for Q 2, p represents a multinomial probability. The assumption that all redshifters perform better than random even for Q = 2 led us to adopt pa = 0.2 above. In contrast, for Q = 1, p represents a binomial probability, and gratifyingly we find that all p(i, 1) values lie well above 0.5.</p>
        <p>There is also a clear anti-correlation between p(i, 2) and p(i, 1). This can be understood by considering the extremes of the redshifters' behaviours when confronted with a spectrum where the 'correct' redshift is difficult to identify. A particularly ambitious or conscientious redshifter will always attempt to find a redshift, and will too often assign Q = 2, while reserving Q = 1 only for the very worst spectra. More balanced redshifters will hence almost always agree with the latter assignments, resulting in a high p(i, 1) value relative to others, but less frequently with the former, resulting in a relatively low p(i, 2) value. Vice versa, a redshifter at the other extreme will too frequently assign Q = 1 while reserving Q = 2 for comparatively 'easy' cases. Again, more balanced redshifters will thus often agree with the latter assignments but not with the former, resulting in relatively high p(i, 2) and low p(i, 1) values.</p>
        <p>We point out that the model of equations ( 1) and ( 12) with its These values are the result of fitting the model of equations ( 1) and ( 12) to the observed redshift agreement and normalised class disagreement fractions. Redshifters are identified by their initials along the abscissa, and are arbitrarily ordered by their p(i, 3) values. Green triangles, blue points, orange squares and red diamonds are for Q = 4, 3, 2 and 1, respectively, as indicated. The dark and light shaded regions mark the p(z) ranges to which we assign nQ = 4 and 3, respectively (see Section 2.3.4).</p>
        <p>4NRS = 220 free parameters (where 4 is the number of values that Q can take on) does not in fact provide a formally acceptable fit to the 5824 fz and 4381 f cl observed data points: we find a minimum χ 2 per degree of freedom of 1.23 [P (&gt; χ 2 ) ≈ 0]. We attribute this to shortcomings of the model itself (see below) as well as to the inability of our use of asymmetric errorbars in the fit to fully capture the extreme asymmetry and non-Gaussianity of the error distribution of fz near values of 1 and 0. Despite this poor formal fit quality, the inspection of the residuals between the data and the best-fit model inspires confidence that the fit is nevertheless meaningful, and we find an rms of the residuals of 1.09. In Fig. 3 we show the rms of the residuals as a function of redshifter and Q. While the Q 3 values all scatter around a value of 1.1, the Q = 4 values are clearly lower on average. This offset is explained by the high p(i, 4) values since the underlying assumption of a probabilistic process breaks down for p ≈ 1.</p>
        <p>Fig. 3 is also a useful diagnostic to detect individual redshifters whose data cannot be fit by our model, which could be caused, e.g., by inconsistent Q assignments as a function of time. Only one redshifter stands out (afm), with three of the four rms values being outliers. These are explained, however, by small number statistics, as this redshifter's results have been checked by only one other person (sjp). Similarly, sjp's Q = 4 value is also unusually high, but again, this value is based on a comparison with only two other redshifters (one of whom is afm). We thus conclude that overall our model provides an acceptable fit to the observed redshift agreement and normalised class disagreement fractions.</p>
        <p>A shortcoming of our approach is that we have to measure a given redshifter's p as a function of the discrete parameter Q. Not only is this parameter discrete, it will also be 'fuzzy' at least to some extent, in the sense that no redshifter can be expected to be entirely consistent in assigning Q values in borderline cases. Ideally, we would like to measure p as a function of some continuous, completely reproducible measure of a spectrum's propensity to having its redshift correctly identified, even if the scale of this mea- 1) and ( 12), and the observed redshift agreement and class disagreement fractions as a function of redshifter and Q. Redshifters are identified by their initials along the x-axis and are ordered in the same way as in Fig. 2. Green triangles, blue points, orange squares and red diamonds are for Q = 4, 3, 2 and 1, respectively. sure varied from redshifter to redshifter. 6 The difficulty of defining such a measure, however, is the very reason why redshifters have to assign a redshift quality in the first place. We thus have to use Q as a proxy and accept that we are unable to capture any variation of p(i, Q) within Q.</p>
        <p>Similarly, we do not capture any possible variations of p(i, Q) as a function of time, which could be caused, e.g., by a redshifter gaining more experience with the redshifting process over time. We have attempted to eliminate this particular cause by subjecting all redshifters new to the process to an extensive training programme before they begin redshifting in earnest.</p>
        <p>Finally, we note that the redshifting results of nine initial redshifters have not yet been subjected to re-redshifting. For these redshifters we therefore have no information regarding their p(i, Q) values. Since we will need p values for all redshifters in the following, we choose to assign values of 0.9, 0.6, 0.9 and 0.95 for Q = 1 to 4, respectively. The first two are the averages of the corresponding values in Fig. 2, while the latter two are conservatively chosen as the lowest p values that will result in redshifts marked as Q = 3 or 4 by these redshifters being assigned nQ = 3 or 4, respectively (see Section 2.3.4 below).</p>
        <p>With p(i, Q) values for all redshifters in hand, we can now proceed to evaluate, for each spectrum, the relative merit of all offered opinions for this spectrum by computing the probability that they are 'correct' (in the sense described in the previous section). For those spectra with multiple opinions this will allow us to identify the 'best' redshift for each spectrum (i.e. the one most likely to be 'correct'), and to provide a homogenised measure of confidence for all redshifts.</p>
        <p>Consider the general case of a spectrum for which Nop = NQ2 + NQ1 opinions have been offered, where NQ2 and NQ1 are the number of Q 2 and of Q &lt; 2 opinions, respectively. We begin by collating these opinions into a set of Np distinct 'possibilities', where each possibility xi is supported by the set of opinions Si of size Ni. These possibilities consist of all of the different redshifts, zi, among the offered Q 2 opinions, as well as the possibility that the spectrum does not yield a redshift. This last possibility is of course only included if at least one Q = 1 opinion was offered (i.e. if NQ1 &gt; 0). Thus we have Np = Nz + δN Q1 , where we define δN Q1 = 0 (1) if NQ1 = 0 (NQ1 &gt; 0), and where Nz is the number of different redshifts found for this spectrum (0 Nz NQ2). To obtain these different redshifts we sort the offered Q 2 opinions into sets Si by identifying groups of similar redshifts (where a 'group' often consists of only a single member, i.e. Ni = 1) using the same one-dimensional friends-offriends method as in Section 2.3.3 above, with the same generous linking length of ∆z = 0.0035. The zi are then simply taken as the average redshifts of these groups.</p>
        <p>For each possibility xi we now compute its probability of being 'correct' as:</p>
        <p>where</p>
        <p>and where q(c) is the (unnormalised) probability of the complement of all offered possibilities being 'correct' (i.e. of the possibility that all offered possibilities are 'incorrect'). The first product in the above equation runs over all Ni opinions supporting xi, and the second product over all other (disagreeing) opinions. rj and Qj refer to the originator and Q value of opinion j. Note that if xi is 'correct' then all agreements on (other) redshifts must be 'accidental' [see equation ( 1 . The green histogram shows the distribution of the probability of the 'best' possibility to be 'correct' for all GAMA II spectra of main survey targets. The yellow line shows the same but only for those spectra that have been re-redshifted (i.e. those with Nop &gt; 1). The red histogram shows the 'correctness' probability distribution for all other (i.e. 'non-best') possibilities (which, by construction, always refer to spectra with Nop &gt; 1). Note that this histogram cuts off at p(x) = 0.5, as it must. The black line shows the distribution of the probability of the complement to be correct, i.e. that none of the offered possibilities are correct, for all spectra. The many more or less isolated peaks in the green histogram relative to the yellow line are caused by spectra with Nop = 1, and the peaks correspond to the p(i, Q) values in Fig. 2, except for those at 0.6, 0.9 and 0.95. These three peaks are largely artificial, as they are caused by setting the p(i, Q) of the nine untested initial redshifters to these values (see end of Section 2.3.3). Note that all peaks are mirrored in the black p(c) distribution. The dark and light grey shaded regions mark the p(x) ranges to which we assign nQ = 4 and 3, respectively (only if x corresponds to a redshift).</p>
        <p>the highest probability of being 'correct'.foot_6 If this 'best' possibility corresponds to a redshift, z b , then this is adopted as the final redshift of the spectrum. If, on the other hand, x b corresponds to the possibility that the spectrum does not yield a redshift then of course the redshift of the spectrum is undefined.</p>
        <p>In Fig. 4 we show the distributions of the numbers of opinions and possibilities, Nop and Np, for all GAMA II spectra (taken from SpecCatv27). As mentioned in Section 2.3.2, the re-redshifting campaigns have so far only covered the data collected up to 2011 May. This resulted in 56 989 spectra (19 per cent of the total) having Nop &gt; 1. For 24 898 of these spectra (44 per cent, 8 per cent of the total) there was at least some disagreement among the multiple opinions, leading to Np &gt; 1.</p>
        <p>In Fig. 5 we show as the green filled histogram the distribution of p(x b ) for all GAMA II spectra, while the yellow histogram shows the same for all spectra with Nop &gt; 1. Gratifyingly, these distributions are strongly peaked at p 0.93, meaning that in general the 'best' possibility is well-distinguished from any other offered possibilities (shown in red), as well as from the complement (shown in black). Nevertheless, the p(x b ) distribution of course extends down to quite low values. Users of the z b should therefore define an appropriate threshold value pmin and only include those z b in their scientific analyses for which p(z b ) &gt; pmin (or, more sophisticatedly, devise a p(z b )-based weighting scheme). To this end, and to replace the familiar single-redshifter Q parameter, we have defined a normalised quality parameter nQ thus:</p>
        <p>and nQ = 1 is assigned to those spectra where x b corresponds to the possibility that the spectrum does not yield a redshift. The p(z b ) ranges above are somewhat arbitrary, but they were chosen at an early stage of the survey on the basis of an earlier version of Fig. 2 to roughly reflect the meanings of the single-redshifter Q values. In particular, the intention was to make nQ = 3 and 2 the divide between accepting a redshift for scientific analyses and not accepting it, thus reflecting the distinction between Q = 3 and 2. In other words, we have set pmin = 0.9. This is the value we have used in all of our own studies using these redshifts to date. However, we stress that in principle the choice of pmin may depend on the scientific application at hand, and users may wish to define pmin differently or indeed use a more sophisticated scheme than a simple threshold.</p>
        <p>We have thus finally achieved what we set out to do: we have unambiguously identified, in a probabilistic manner, the 'best' redshift z b (or else that no redshift can be determined) for every spectrum, and we have computed a homogeneous quality measure for these redshifts [p(z b ) and nQ], free of the idiosyncrasies of individual redshifters,foot_7 thus allowing us to statistically treat all spectra the same, regardless of the number of opinions available for them.</p>
        <p>We now briefly compare the distributions of the initial redshifts and qualities (zini and Q) to those of the final redshifts and qualities (z b and nQ) in order to illustrate the overall effect of the re-redshifting.</p>
        <p>As explained above, one of the purposes of re-redshifting is to 3 for all GAMA II spectra of main survey targets. The green line shows the same but only for those spectra that have been re-redshifted (i.e. those with Nop &gt; 1). For these same spectra the blue line shows the distribution of the initial redshifts with Q 2. Finally, the red histogram shows the distribution of the redshifts that are not the 'best'. For clarity, the green and blue histograms have been multiplied by a factor of 3, while the red histogram has been multiplied by 2.</p>
        <p>confirm or reject redshifts initially classified as 'probable' or 'possible', i.e. as Q = 3 or Q = 2. Thus we expect the Q and nQ distributions of the initial and final redshifts to differ. In Fig. 6 we plot these distributions as the dark and light green histograms, respectively, for all spectra with Nop &gt; 1, i.e. for all spectra that have been re-redshifted. The two distributions are indeed very different, with the relative heights of the Q,nQ = 3,4 bars roughly interchanged.foot_8 The difference between these distributions is the net result of the initially uncertain redshifts either being strongly confirmed or clearly rejected: 75 per cent of Q = 3 redshifts were strongly confirmed, and thus received nQ = 4, while 21 per cent were not confirmed, and thus received nQ = 2 (17 per cent) or nQ = 1 (4 per cent). Only 4 per cent were confirmed but remained somewhat uncertain, and thus received nQ = 3. Similarly, of the Q = 2 redshifts, 37 per cent were strongly confirmed (nQ = 4), while 59 per cent were not confirmed (equally split among nQ = 2 and 1), and again only 4 per cent received nQ = 3. We also note in passing that 80 per cent of spectra with Q = 1 remained at nQ = 1 (with a further 9 per cent receiving nQ = 2), and that 96 per cent of redshifts with Q = 4 were clearly confirmed.</p>
        <p>Since only part of the data have been re-redshifted, the effect of the re-redshifting on the full dataset is not quite as dramatic, as evidenced by the brown and beige histograms in Fig. 6. The change in the relative heights of the Q,nQ = 3,4 bars is nevertheless quite clear.</p>
        <p>In Fig. 7 we show as the blue histogram the distribution of the initial redshifts with Q 2 for spectra with Nop &gt; 1. In other words, this is the distribution of the redshifts that went into the re-redshifting process. We first of all note in passing that these redshifts are not a random sub-set of the overall redshift sample, which is shown as the grey filled histogram.foot_9 Clearly, the blue distribution is skewed towards higher values, meaning that the initial redshifters tend to be more uncertain when assigning higher redshifts.</p>
        <p>The main point of Fig. 7, however, is to compare the redshift distributions before and after re-redshifting. To this end we show as the green histogram the distribution of the redshifts that came out of the re-redshifting process, i.e. the distribution of the final redshifts with nQ 3 for spectra with Nop &gt; 1. We find that the blue and green distributions are reasonably similar, both on small and large scales, and so we conclude that the re-redshifting does not alter the redshift distribution dramatically.</p>
        <p>Finally, we show as the red histogram the distribution of the redshifts that were not identified as the 'best' redshift. In other words, these are redshifts for spectra for which at least one other, more likely 'correct' redshift has been found. This distribution is clearly quite different from the others, significantly broader and not reproducing the same peaks on small scales. Furthermore, the two most pronounced peaks in this distribution, namely those at z ≈ 0.16 and 0.175, are clearly due to the frequent misidentification of the residuals of certain strong sky features: at z = 0.159, Hα is shifted to the blue trough of the telluric O2 A-band at 7606 Å, while at z = 0.175 both Hα and the [Si II] λ6731 line happen to coincide exactly with two prominent atmospheric OH lines. Based on our past experience with RUNZ and similar AAT data in the context of the 2dFGRS and MGC surveys, these two peaks were in fact expected. We thus find that the distribution of the 'non-best' redshifts inspires confidence in our selection of the 'best' redshifts. It should be kept in mind, however, that the redshifting mistakes represented by the red histogram are still present among the data that have not yet been re-redshifted (cf. also Section 3.4).</p>
        <p>As we already mentioned at the beginning of Section 2.3, in 2013 we completed the development of a new and fully automated redshifting code called 
            <rs type="software">AUTOZ</rs>. This new code was fully described and illustrated by Baldry et al. (2014). In brief, it determines redshifts using cross-correlation of our survey spectra with galaxy and stellar templates. Note that no QSO templates are included at present, meaning that the redshift of a spectrum with broad emission lines cannot be confidently identified using 
            <rs type="software">AUTOZ</rs>. The stellar templates were taken from SDSS DR5foot_10 (IDs 0-22), and we created eight galaxy templates from the BOSS galaxy eigenspectra (Bolton et al. 2012). Both the template and survey spectra were robustly high-pass filtered prior to cross-correlation. In addition, each highpass filtered spectrum is clipped so that the deviations lie within plus or minus thirty times the mean absolute deviation. This reduces the impact on the cross-correlation function from strong lines or unknown bad data, which could give rise to false peaks. The aim was to make the code robust to spectrophotometric uncertainties and artefacts.
        </p>
        <p>The best-estimated redshift for each survey spectrum is taken from the highest cross-correlation peak, normalised by a root mean square value, across all the templates. The allowed redshift range for the galaxy templates is up to 0.9. For each redshift we estimate a figure of merit (FOM) primarily by comparing the height of the highest correlation peak with those of the next three best redshifts (outside 600 km s -1 from each other). We then derive the redshift confidence, i.e. the probability that the redshift is correct, p(z), from the redshift's FOM. The relation between these parameters is calibrated using duplicate observations of the same targets. Finally, analogous to our procedure used for RUNZ (see Section 2.3.4), we define a quality parameter nQ based on the value of p(z). However, this time we are slightly more conservative by assigning nQ = 4 only to redshifts with p(z) 0.98 [cf. equation ( 15)].</p>
        <p>In Section 3.4 we will compare the performance of AUTOZ with that of RUNZ, both in terms of the precision of the redshifts, and in terms of the fraction of redshifts that are catastrophically wrong. As we shall see, AUTOZ turns out to be superior to RUNZ in all respects, and therefore we adopted the AUTOZ redshifts as the default for GAMA II in 2013 (although for quality control purposes we have continued to measure redshifts with RUNZ as well). The AUTOZ redshifts have already been used in some of the most recent GAMA publications.</p>
        <p>As we will describe in more detail in Section 3.1 below, a main survey target that was unsuccessfully observed, in the sense that its spectrum did not yield a robust (i.e. nQ</p>
        <p>3) redshift, remained on the target list until a subsequent observation proved successful. Many targets were thus observed more than once. For some, however, all of the spectra obtained are of insufficient quality for AUTOZ to be able to reliably measure a redshift from these individually. With the survey now completed, and thus with no further re-observations forthcoming, the question arises whether we can nevertheless obtain reliable redshifts for at least some of these objects by combining their spectra together and using the combined, higher S/N spectra for the redshift measurements.</p>
        <p>For all objects with multiple spectra that do not already have a high-quality (nQ = 4) AUTOZ redshift from one of these we thus combine their high-pass filtered and clipped spectra and attempt to measure a redshift from the combined spectrum as described in the previous section. If the redshift measured from the combined spectrum has a higher FOM than those measured from the individual spectra then the redshift from the combined spectrum is used for this object. A total of 5348 objects thus receive a 'new' redshift with an improved redshift confidence, increasing the number of main survey objects with a reliable (nQ 3) redshift by 1654. Note that the 'new' redshift may or may not be different from the redshifts measured from the individual spectra, but it always has an improved confidence.</p>
        <p>Since AUTOZ does not use any QSO templates and does not consider redshifts &gt; 0.9 (see Section 2.4), it often fails to reliably identify a redshift for AGN spectra. Since these spectra display prominent emission lines, however, their redshifts are usually reliably determined by RUNZ. For spectra of main survey objects without any good (nQ 3) redshift from either AUTOZ or from a previous survey (see Section 2.7) we thus continue to use their RUNZ redshift if nQ RUNZ = 4 and if z RUNZ &gt; 0.9 or the spectrum is flagged as an AGN by a RUNZ redshifter. Thus we 'recover' the redshifts of 283 main survey objects.</p>
        <p>Previous spectroscopic surveys already obtained spectra and redshifts for a significant number of GAMA II main survey objects. These objects were targeted by GAMA with lower priority (depending on the quality of the pre-existing redshift) than previously unobserved objects. The GAMA II survey dataset by itself is thus not complete and it needs to be merged with the data from these previous surveys in order to obtain a complete sample.</p>
        <p>We have thus downloaded all publicly available spectra and redshifts in the GAMA II survey regions as detailed in Table 2. Note that we did not restrict ourselves to data for main survey targets. We also included all available data within 0.5 deg of the nominal GAMA II survey regions. These additional data may be useful in the future for mitigating edge effects when determining the environments of GAMA main survey objects. We also included all duplicate observations for completeness. Our current sample of 'external' spectra represents a significant update and extension of the earlier samples described by Baldry et al. (2010) and Driver et al. (2011).</p>
        <p>The external spectra were associated with GAMA objects by positional matching. To be able to resolve duplications, and thus to merge the samples from the different surveys with each other and with the GAMA II sample, it was necessary to define a common (preferably homogeneous) redshift quality parameter. We have thus translated the various quality parameters of the different surveys to our nQ system (see Section 2.3.4). This was straightforward for almost all of the surveys since they used simple quality parameters very similar to ours. The only exception was the SDSS for which we used the following nQ definition:</p>
        <p>where each of the terms takes on the value of 1 if the condition inside the parentheses is true and 0 otherwise. ∆χ 2 ν is the difference between the reduced χ 2 of the best and the second best redshifts as determined by the SDSS, and ZWARNING is the SDSS redshift warning flag. Note that for SDSS redshifts nQ may take on a value of 5 which we do not use for any other survey including GAMA. This is owed to the exceptional reliability of these redshifts.</p>
        <p>Although main survey objects with a good (i.e. nQ 3) preexisting redshift from a previous survey were targeted only with a lower priority than previously unobserved objects (depending on the value of nQ) there is nevertheless significant overlap between the sample of external spectra and the GAMA sample for these objects: of the 40 901 main survey objects that have at least one nQ 3 redshift from one of the other surveys, 16 266 (40 per cent) also have at least one nQ 3 redshift from GAMA II. This helps in improving the overall homogeneity of the combined sample, both in terms of the redshifts as well as in terms of the spectra, especially when considering that, unlike GAMA and SDSS spectra, the spectra from all of the other surveys are not flux calibrated.</p>
        <p>Recall that the GAMA spectroscopic survey was carried out with the AAOmega multi-fibre spectrograph on the AAT. For such instruments observations of very bright targets may lead to cross-talk between adjacent spectra on the detector. To avoid this the GAMA target selection for AAT observations included a bright magnitude limit (GAMA I: r fib &gt; 17.0 mag, Baldry et al. 2010; GAMA II: r fib &gt; 16.6 mag, where r fib is the SDSS r-band fibre magnitude). Most objects brighter than this limit had already been observed by one of the previous spectroscopic surveys as discussed in the previous section. Here we briefly describe observations using the robotic Liverpool Telescope (LT) of 20 targets that were too bright for the AAT, and which had no pre-existing data.</p>
        <p>All 20 targets were observed between 2009 November and 2010 June with FRODOSpec, an integral field spectrograph consisting of a 12 × 12 lenslet array coupled to a dual-beam spectrograph using fibres (Morales-Rueda et al. 2004). Two consecutive exposures (usually of 500 s each) were taken of each target using the R ≈ 2200 gratings. Unfortunately, the blue spectrograph arm had significantly reduced throughput at the time and so only the red-arm data (580-940 nm) was usable. We reduced the data us-Table 3. Global statistics of the GAMA II spectroscopic survey after the completion of all observations. Note that these numbers include the data from the full G02 region, not just from its smaller, high-priority sub-region. ing the pipeline by Barnsley, Smith &amp; Steele (2012) to the point where it provides a non-sky subtracted datacube (later stages of the pipeline were designed with point sources in mind). Summedflux images were then used to determine object and sky apertures. Cosmic rays were rejected before combining the object and sky spectra across these apertures and finally producing the integrated, sky-subtracted object spectrum.</p>
        <p>To determine the redshifts, the spectra were cross-correlated with the stellar and galaxy templates (IDs 0-15 and 23-27, respectively) used by the SDSS. Only a generic telluric correction was applied to each spectrum so one or two of the strongest telluric regions were masked to avoid spurious cross-correlations. The redshift range allowed was -0.002 to 0.002 for the stellar templates and 0.002 to 0.2 for the galaxy templates. For each spectrum, the best-matching template was selected by comparing the peak of the cross-correlation function in the allowed range, divided by its rms in the range -0.1 to 0.2. This parameter was also used in assessing the quality of the final, selected redshift. Only one of the 20 redshifts was assigned Q = 2, all others received Q = 3. Half of the sample were identified as stars.</p>
        <p>The 6.5-year observing campaign for the GAMA II spectroscopic survey using the 2dF/AAOmega facility on the AAT came to an end in 2014. While the equatorial survey regions (G09, G12 and G15) were completed as planned, achieving an exceptionally high redshift completeness of 98.5 per cent, the southern regions (G02 and G23) could unfortunately not be completed within their original scope. For G02 it became clear in 2013 that the allocated observing time would not suffice to complete this region in full, and so from then on observations focused on what we have termed the 'high-priority sub-region' of G02 north of declination -6 deg (cf. Table 1). By this time, however, significant observing effort had already been spent on the rest of G02, and so we have continued to consider all of G02 to be part of the GAMA II survey. In the highpriority sub-region the final redshift completeness is 95.0 per cent, while in the full region it is 54.5 per cent. Note that the full G02 sample, despite its low completeness, is nevertheless very valuable for the identification of AGN and members of galaxy clusters detected by the XXL survey of the same region (Pierre et al. 2011).</p>
        <p>Similarly, in early 2014 it became clear that G23, too, could not be completed as planned. In contrast to G02 though, this region was not yet in an advanced state of completion. Hence we descoped G23 both in terms of its size as well as in terms of its magnitude limit (cf. Table 1), but did so in a way that minimised the 'loss' of already observed objects while still allowing us to complete the region within the allocated time. In the end, we were able to achieve a redshift completeness of 94.2 per cent in G23.</p>
        <p>In the following we will discuss the survey's progression and observing efficiency in some detail, and we will present a number of diagnostics that characterise the quality of final GAMA II spectroscopic dataset. 1). The colour scale indicates the number of fields, n, covering a given position. In each panel, the average value of n within the nominal survey region, n, is indicated at the top left, while the total number of fields in each region, N , is indicated at the top right. The numbers in parentheses in the G02 panel refer to the high-priority sub-region.</p>
        <p>The GAMA II spectroscopic survey has been carried out over a total of 209.5 nights, spread over 31 observing runs, in the period 2008 February to 2014 September. Of these, we estimate that only 63 per cent were useful, mostly due to exceptionally bad weather in the period 2010-2012. During this time we have successfully observed 930 2dF/AAOmega fields, resulting in 295 853 spectra of 245 424 unique main survey objects. For 237 900 (96.9 per cent) of these we have been able to measure a secure (i.e. nQ 3) redshift using AUTOZ (cf. Sections 2.4-2.6). Merging these data with publicly available spectra from previous surveys in the GAMA II regions (see Section 2.7) and the GAMA LT spectra (Section 2.8) increases these numbers to 354 059 spectra of 270 710 unique main survey objects, of which 263 719 have a secure redshift. Additional global statistics of the survey are provided in Table 3, and the evolution with time of some of these parameters is shown in Fig. 8.</p>
        <p>Although the 2dF/AAOmega facility nominally has 400 fibres, on average only 342.5 of these were available for science targets. The rest (14.4 per cent) were either needed to guide the telescope or to observe calibration spectra (sky and flux calibration stars), or they were broken.</p>
        <p>Initially, the density of main survey targets exceeded the density of available fibres by a factor of ∼9.8. Despite this high value, not all fibres available for science targets could be allocated to main survey targets. Fibre placement restrictions and a low density of main survey targets once a survey region neared completion (which forced us to allocate fibres to filler targets, cf. Section 2.1) reduced the average number of fibres available for main survey targets to 318.1.</p>
        <p>The first observation of a main survey target led to a secure (i.e. nQ 3) redshift only in 90.9 per cent of all cases. This was not high enough to meet our (secondary) survey requirement of 99 per cent redshift completeness at all magnitudes down to the survey limit (Robotham et al. 2010). Since the high initial target density necessitated multiple visits to every patch of sky in any case, unsuccessfully observed main survey targets thus remained on the target list until a robust redshift had been obtained, although with a progressively decreasing priority. As a result, 42 241 main survey targets were observed more than once. These duplicate observations raised the fraction of observed unique main survey targets with robust redshifts to 96.9 per cent.foot_11 On average, the survey has thus produced robust redshifts for 1136 unique main survey objects per allocated night (1817 per useful night).</p>
        <p>In view of this number, the question arises whether the survey has made optimal use of its allocated time. In other words, could the survey have progressed any faster? To answer this question let us decompose the progression rate into a product of three factors: (i) the number of observed 2dF/AAOmega fields per allocated night; (ii) the number of on-sky fibres per field; and (iii) the number of main survey targets with a robust redshift per on-sky fibre (for which we will use the term 'efficiency' hereafter). While each of these factors in turn depends on a number of parameters, for the first two factors we could control only one of these. First, we maximised the number of observed fields per night by reducing the exposure time per field to its smallest sensible value (which is set by the time required by the 2dF positioner to configure the following observing plate). Second, to maximise the number of onsky fibres per field, all we could do was to ensure that essentially no fibres were left unused at any time. The question of the survey's optimal progression thus boils down to its efficiency. ever, as can be seen from the lower panel of Fig. 8, unlike the other two factors the survey efficiency is a function of time. Apart from a small, constant inefficiency required by the survey's calibration needs (cf. the red line in the lower panel of Fig. 8), the survey's inefficiency is mainly driven by the duplicate observations (blue line). However, as described above, these duplicate observations were essential in order to achieve the survey's high redshift completeness requirement. The only way to reduce the duplication rate, and hence to increase the survey's efficiency, would have been to increase the exposure time per field. However, this dependence is sub-linear. In contrast, the number of observed fields per night depends linearly on the exposure time, so that the progression rate would in fact have decreased if the exposure time had been increased. The only true inefficiency thus lies in the number of fibres that had to be allocated to filler targets (orange line in Fig. 8). As the survey progressed and main survey targets were removed from the target list, it was impossible to entirely avoid observing filler targets. A further contributor to this inefficiency was the decision in 2014 to descope the G23 survey region as discussed above. This descope had the unavoidable side-effect of somewhat increasing the inefficiency of the survey because all objects outside of the new selection limits, including those that had already been observed, retroactively lost their main survey status and are thus now considered filler targets by definition. Nevertheless, mainly due to the large initial main survey target density, the inefficiency due to the observation of filler targets amounts to only 6.6 per cent for the completed survey.</p>
        <p>We thus conclude that the seemingly low final overall survey efficiency of 69.1 per cent was essentially unavoidable given our high redshift completeness goal.</p>
        <p>Finally, in Fig. 9 we show the distribution of the observed 2dF/AAOmega fields on the sky. This distribution is the result of the tiling algorithm described by Robotham et al. (2010), which, for any given state of the survey in a particular survey region, chooses the position of the next field to be observed as the one that most improves the spatial redshift completeness in that region. In the equatorial survey regions (G09, G12 and G15), which are the most complete, the average number of fields that cover a given position ranges from 10.3 to 10.9, with more than 99 per cent of these regions covered by 5 fields. These high covering numbers are to some extent driven by the inefficiencies discussed above, but they are nevertheless a key feature of the survey's design, one that provides us with an important advantage over single-pass surveys: it allows us to ensure high redshift completeness even for closely packed pairs and groups of galaxies (see Fig. 17 below). Without multiple visits the redshift completeness of close pairs and groups would be severely impaired by physical fibre placement restrictions.</p>
        <p>The gross redshift success of the survey is defined as the fraction of spectra of main survey targets for which we were able to measure a secure redshift (nQ 3, using AUTOZ, disregarding redshifts from combined spectra). In Table 3 we have already seen that the overall redshift success of the survey is 87.8 per cent. In this section we will briefly consider the redshift success in more detail.</p>
        <p>In Fig. 10 we show how the redshift success varies as a function of the average spectral signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). While the redshift success turns down sharply for S/N &lt; 3, we note that it does not quite drop to 0. The reason is of course that a redshift can still be measured reliably from emission lines even in the complete absence of a stellar continuum. The few data points at high S/N and relatively low redshift success are due to only a very small number of spectra, as evidenced by the grey histogram in Fig. 10. Most of these spectra are of stars and QSOs (for which AUTOZ has no templates at present), and many are severely affected by data reduction issues.</p>
        <p>From Fig. 10 it is clear that S/N is an excellent predictor of redshift success. Redshift success will therefore also strongly correlate with the observational parameters and target properties that determine the S/N, i.e. exposure time, sky brightness, airmass and atmospheric transparency, seeing, and the target's brightness and light distribution [cf. also Fig. 5 of Hopkins et al. (2013)]. In the following we will briefly ask whether redshift success also depends on any instrumental parameters.</p>
        <p>Fig. 11 shows the redshift success as a function of the fibre through which the spectra were observed, separately for each of the two 2dF plates. For several fibres the redshift success is clearly significantly lower than for the bulk of the fibres, in particular on plate 1. We believe that the most likely explanation for these low values is that these fibres have significantly lower transmission than the others (cf. Sharp et al. 2013). Fibre transmission variations will be further investigated in the context of efforts to improve the flux calibration scheme of the survey (Maier et al., in preparation).</p>
        <p>In Fig. 12 we show the redshift success as a function of the fibre position on the plate, separately for each of the two 2dF plates as indicated. In both cases we can clearly see structure in the spatial distribution of the redshift success. While there are some differences between the two plates, many features are shared. The most obvious feature is the radial dependence. This is shown more clearly in Fig. 13 where we plot redshift success as a function of the distance from the plate centre. This figure bears a remarkable resemblance to Fig. 18 of Croom et al. (2004), who already identified this same effect in the 2QZ survey. As discussed by these authors, the radial dependence of the redshift success could be caused by a number of effects, including systematic errors in the astrometry or field rotation and atmospheric refraction effects. In addition, Sharp et al. (2013) found that the transmission of a given fibre also depends on the fibre's distance from the plate centre, which they mainly attributed to radial variations of the apparent fibre diameter, of focal ratio degradation and of non-telecentricity. Whatever the cause of the radial dependence of the redshift success may be, the concern here is of course that the distribution seen in Fig. 12 may also be imprinted on the spatial distribution of the redshift completeness on the sky. As we will see in the next section, this is not the case, presumably due to the large amount of overlap among the observed 2dF fields and their irregular positioning on the sky (cf. Fig. 9).</p>
        <p>In this section we turn to the redshift completeness, defined as the fraction of main survey targets for which we were able to obtain at least one secure redshift (nQ 3, either using AUTOZ, now including redshifts from combined spectra, or from a previous survey). The redshift completeness thus includes the effects of targeting completeness, redshift success, and duplicate observations.</p>
        <p>The overall redshift completeness in the equatorial survey re- gions (G09, G12 and G15) is 98.48 per cent, in the high-priority sub-region of G02 it is 94.95 per cent, and in G23 the completeness is 94.19 per cent. In the equatorial regions almost all of the incompleteness is due to redshift measurement failures, since only 158 main survey targets in these regions (0.08 per cent) remain unobserved. In G02 and G23 the contribution of the targeting incompleteness is somewhat larger. Here we have failed to observe 251 and 863 main survey targets (1.2 and 1.9 per cent), respectively. Since the redshift incompleteness is mostly due to redshifting failures and not targeting incompleteness, we must expect the incompleteness to be biased towards faint and low surface brightness galaxies. As we can see from Fig. 14 this is indeed the case. In this figure we show the redshift completeness in the equatorial survey regions as a function of r-band magnitude and surface brightness. For G02 and G23 the plot looks quite similar, albeit at slightly lower overall completeness levels. The cut-offs of the data at r = 19.8 mag and µ eff = 26 mag arcsec -2 are the explicit selection limits imposed on main survey targets (Baldry et al. 2010).</p>
        <p>From Fig. 14 we can see that the completeness is reason- ably uniform across the bulk of the target galaxy population. Still, there is a small, but nonetheless significant trend: the completeness drops from ∼99 per cent at r = 19.2 mag to ∼96 per cent at the faint limit of 19.8 mag, where of course the magnitude distribution peaks (cf. top panel of Fig. 14). There is also a significant trend with surface brightness (cf. right panel of Fig. 14). The completeness is roughly constant at ∼99 per cent down to µ eff = 22.8 mag arcsec -2 , from where it drops to ∼92 per cent at 23.7 mag arcsec -2 . While the completeness is thus constant across the peak of the surface brightness distribution, the drop nevertheless affects a significant fraction of the target galaxy population. Below 23.7 mag arcsec -2 the completeness drops even further, down to ∼60 per cent at 26 mag arcsec -2 (not shown in the right panel). However, only a tiny fraction of the target population is affected by these low completeness levels.</p>
        <p>In Fig. 14 we can also see a pocket of lower completeness at faint magnitudes and high surface brightness. Having inspected the relevant spectra, we believe that this pocket is mostly caused by QSOs (cf. Section 2.6) and stars (our star-galaxy separation is not perfect). This hypothesis is further supported by the colour of the incompleteness pocket. Since QSOs are in general quite blue compared to galaxies, and since the stellar contamination of our main survey sample is highest at g -i &lt; 1 mag (cf. Fig. 6 of Baldry et al. 2010), we expect the high surface brightness incompleteness to mainly affect the blue end of our sample. From Fig. 15 we can see that it is indeed largely confined to g -i &lt; 0.7 mag.</p>
        <p>Note that these objects alone cannot explain the observed drop in the completeness from ∼99 per cent at g -i = 0.6 mag down to 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 ∼86 per cent at g -i = 0 mag. The low surface brightness incompleteness discussed above also contributes to this decline, consistent with the notion of low surface brightness galaxies being gasrich and star-forming, and therefore blue.</p>
        <p>Summarising the above, we find that, although redshift completeness variations are small across the bulk of the target galaxy population, significant trends with magnitude, surface brightness and colour nevertheless exist, and should be corrected for when using the redshift data.</p>
        <p>In Fig. 16 we show the spatial distribution of the redshift completeness on the sky for each of our survey regions. No large-scale trends or patterns are evident. The dependence of redshift success on the distance from the 2dF plate centre seen in Figs. 12 and 13 thus appears to have had little impact on the redshift completeness distribution on the sky.</p>
        <p>Given the importance of galaxy groups and close pairs to the GAMA survey's main scientific goals we are of course also interested in the survey's redshift completeness on small angular scales. In Fig. 17 we show the redshift completeness as a function of distance to the nearest neighbour among main survey targets. One might expect the completeness to be affected out to a nearest neighbour distance of ∼40 arcsec by the fact that two targets separated by less than this distance cannot in general both be allocated a fibre in the same configuration due to physical fibre placement constraints. However, thanks to our fibre placement strategy, which prioritizes targets with many close neighbours (Robotham et al. 2010), and thanks to the large number of visits to each patch of sky (cf. Fig. 9) we find that the redshift completeness is largely independent of the distance to the nearest neighbour. The only residual effect is a small, but apparently still significant reduction of the completeness by ∼0.5 percentage points in the nearest neighbour distance range 4-20 arcsec.</p>
        <p>The cause of this dip can be found in Fig. 18, where we show the redshift completeness as a function of the number of main survey targets within a distance of 40 arcsec, N40. For 3 N40 8 there is a clear trend of decreasing redshift completeness with in- creasing N40. Since N40 is anti-correlated with nearest neighbour distance, it is this trend that is responsible for the dip in Fig. 17. But what in turn is the cause of this trend? Our fibre placement strategy has evidently succeeded in maintaining the targeting completeness at near 100 per cent for all N40 (cf. orange line in Fig. 18). The reduced redshift completeness at high N40 must therefore be caused either by a reduced redshift success or by a smaller duplication rate for N40 3.</p>
        <p>In fact, we find that both are to blame. Although unsuccessfully observed targets remain on the target list, they do so with a lower priority than unobserved targets. This means that targets in dense regions are less likely to receive a second observation than isolated targets, thereby reducing the duplication rate for targets with high N40. The reason for the reduced redshift success is more subtle. Targets with N40 3 are on average brighter, redder and of higher surface brightness than targets with N40 &lt; 3. Given the completeness trends shown in Figs. 14 and 15 we would thus expect the redshift success to increase with N40. However, we find that for larger N40 values the completeness trends change, in the sense that faint, low surface brightness galaxies in dense environments are even less likely to yield a redshift that their isolated counterparts. In other words, even for fixed target properties the redshift success depends on the target's environment. Based on the visual inspection of targets with failed observations and N40</p>
        <p>3 we believe that this is due to the fact that many of these faint targets lie in the extended halo of a much brighter, nearby galaxy, so that the spectra of the faint targets are frequently 'polluted' with light from a bright neighbour. Since the background is only measured globally for an entire field, but not locally for each target, this 'pollution' will affect AUTOZ's ability to determine an unambiguous redshift.</p>
        <p>We point out that most of the discussion in this section was focused on the equatorial survey regions. The results are qualitatively similar for the g23 and high-priority G02 regions, but all of the effects are somewhat larger due to the lower overall redshift completeness of these regions. We conclude this section by remarking that for the equatorial regions at least, all of the completeness issues described above are relatively minor compared to previous large spectroscopic surveys of low-redshift galaxies.</p>
        <p>In this section we briefly consider the quality of our redshifts, both in terms of the redshift error and in terms of the incorrectness fraction, i.e. the fraction of nQ 3 redshifts that are wrong. While we only used the AUTOZ redshifts in the previous two sections, we will now consider both the RUNZ and the AUTOZ redshifts, and thus compare the performance of the two redshift codes. Driver et al. (2011) already estimated the GAMA error for RUNZ redshifts by considering duplicate observations of the same objects, using both intra-survey and inter-survey comparisons. In the former case we compared all available duplicate redshifts with nQ 3 from GAMA I only, in the latter we compared GAMA redshifts to those from previous surveys (see also Baldry et al. 2014). However, Driver et al. (2011) surmised that both of these samples likely yielded biased results.</p>
        <p>A large fraction of the objects in the intra-survey sample were re-observed because the initial observation only yielded a lowquality redshift (i.e. Q = 2). These objects nevertheless ended up with two nQ 3 redshifts because subsequent re-redshifting of the initial spectra (after the re-observation) confirmed the initial redshifts, which bumped them to nQ 3. Hence this sample was biased towards lower quality spectra. Its median S/N was indeed found to be 20 per cent lower than that of the full sample.</p>
        <p>Due to the spectroscopic limit of the other surveys used in the inter-survey comparison being brighter than that of GAMA, this sample was also biased, but this time towards higher quality spectra: the median S/N of the GAMA spectra in this sample was 70 per cent higher than that of the full sample.</p>
        <p>To avoid having to rely on these biased samples we subsequently selected a random sample of main survey targets for duplicate observations, irrespective of the quality of any existing redshifts. 13 As a result, 2020 randomly selected main survey targets have more than one nQ 3 RUNZ redshift, yielding 2132 redshift pairs (from 4096 unique spectra; some targets were observed more than twice). Here, we only consider redshifts in the range 0.002 &lt; z &lt; 0.9 in order to exclude both stars and QSOs. Using the AUTOZ redshifts we have 2540 pairs from 4807 unique spectra of 2358 unique objects.</p>
        <p>The distributions of the redshift differences of these pairs are 13 For their second observation these targets were treated as filler targets (cf. Section 2.1).</p>
        <p>Figure 19. The grey shaded histogram in the left panel shows the distribution of differences between the RUNZ redshifts measured from independent GAMA II spectra of the same main survey targets, where all redshifts have nQ 3 and lie in the range 0.002 &lt; z &lt; 0.9 (2132 pairs from 4096 unique spectra of 2020 unique objects). These objects were selected for duplicate observations at random, independently of whether the first observation yielded a redshift or not. The red line shows a Lorentzian with γ = 40 km s -1 for comparison. The thick, top-most horizontal errorbar shows the redshift error derived from the 68 percentile range of this distribution. The thinner, more extended errorbar shows the redshift error derived from the distribution of redshift differences using all available duplicate observation, not just those of the randomly selected objects. The other errorbars show the same, but for various sub-samples as indicated in the middle box. The labels 'nQ = 3' and 'nQ = 4' refer to pairs where both redshifts have the respective quality. The labels 'Absorption' and 'Emission' refer to pairs where both redshifts were determined from AUTOZ templates 40-42 or 43-47, respectively (Baldry et al. 2014). The numbers to the left are the values of the 1σ redshift errors in km s -1 for each sub-sample, those in parentheses refer to the errors derived from all duplicate observation. The right panel shows the same as the left, but now using AUTOZ redshifts (2540 pairs from 4807 unique spectra of 2358 unique objects). In this case the Lorentzian is characterised by γ = 27 km s -1 .</p>
        <p>shown in Fig. 19 in velocity units (left: RUNZ, right: AUTOZ). Neither of these distributions is well described by a Gaussian. Instead, they are approximately Lorentzian in velocity space (red lines), indicating a Gaussian distribution in redshift space. We find 68percentile ranges of 141 and 76 km s -1 for the RUNZ and AUTOZ distributions, respectively, indicating redshift errors of σz = 50 and 27 km s -1 .</p>
        <p>We first of all note that our value for the RUNZ error is significantly lower than the value of 65 km s -1 found by Driver et al. (2011). This is due to only using the duplicate observations of the random sample here, as opposed to using all available duplicate observations of main survey targets. Indeed, if we use all duplicates (12 821 pairs from 24 920 unique spectra of 12 340 unique objects) we again find the same RUNZ redshift error as Driver et al.</p>
        <p>(but with a sample larger by a factor of 15). Second, we note that the AUTOZ redshifts are about twice as precise than the RUNZ redshifts, demonstrating the superiority of the AUTOZ methods and templates. We also point out that our overall redshift error for AU-TOZ is in reasonable agreement with the median redshift error of 33 km s -1 identified by Baldry et al. (2014).</p>
        <p>Finally, the series of errorbars in Fig. 19 at which we have chosen to split our sample into faint/bright and high-z/low-z sub-samples are approximately the median values of the sample. Qualitatively, the redshift error behaves as expected for all sub-samples: a lower quality of the redshift, a fainter target, a higher redshift or a spectrum dominated by absorption features all have the effect of increasing the redshift error. We also note that, for each sub-sample investigated, the use of all available duplicate observations of main survey targets (instead of just those of the random sample) always leads to a larger redshift error, confirming the bias of the full sample, relative to the random sample. We now turn to the redshift incorrectness fraction. Each RUNZ and AUTOZ redshift is accompanied by an estimate of the probability, p(z), that this redshift is correct. For any collection of redshifts we can therefore compute which fraction of these should be expected to be incorrect. We will now compare this expected fraction with the actual fraction, which we again derive from duplicate observations of the same objects.</p>
        <p>In the following we will consider any two redshifts of the same object to disagree if they differ by more than |∆v|max = 750 km s -1 (RUNZ) or 350 km s -1 (AUTOZ). These values are not simply multiples of the overall redshift errors, but were instead chosen by carefully evaluating where the |∆v| distributions approach the 'background' of random pairs. However, in practice the exact values adopted for |∆v|max make almost no difference to the results. For any redshift pair found to disagree we then assume that one (and only one) of the two redshifts is wrong, 14 the redshift with the lower p(z) as being incorrect. The spectra of objects with more than two observations are treated analogously. The solid lines in Figs. 20 and 21 show the cumulative incompleteness fractions, i.e. the fractions of redshifts with p(z) &gt; p lim that are incorrect, for both the RUNZ and AUTOZ redshifts, respectively. In each case we show the incorrectness fractions using all available duplicate redshifts of main survey targets (light blue), and only those of the random sample (dark blue). The dashed lines show the corresponding expected fractions computed from the p(z) distributions of the various samples.</p>
        <p>Recalling the connection between p(z) and nQ [RUNZ: see equation ( 15); AUTOZ: see Section 2.4] we first of all note that Figs. 20 and 21 only contain redshifts with nQ 3, i.e. only those we consider of high enough quality to be accepted for scientific analyses.</p>
        <p>Let us now consider the RUNZ results. The step-like features in the blue curves in Fig. 20 are due to isolated peaks in the p(z) distributions of both the random and the full samples (shown as the histograms in the background). These peaks are of course due to those spectra in the sample with Nop = 1, i.e. spectra that have not been re-redshifted (cf. Section 2.3.4 and Fig. 5). For these redshifts we have p(z) = p(i, Q) [cf. equations ( 13) and ( 14)], meaning that the peaks simply reflect the probabilities of individual redshifters to 'correctly' identify a redshift.</p>
        <p>The observed incorrectness fractions of the random and full samples are clearly very different for all p lim (solid dark and light blue lines in Fig. 20, respectively). For the random sample we find an incorrectness fraction among all nQ 3 (i.e. p(z) 0.9) redshifts of 1.6 per cent, whereas for the full sample we find 4.9 per cent. This again confirms the biased nature of the full sample compared to the random sample.</p>
        <p>Comparing the observed incorrectness fractions with the expectations from the p(z) distributions (blue dashed lines), we find that they do not agree for either of the two samples, with the prediction being too low for the full sample and too high for the random sample. Note also the similarity of the predictions for the two samples, which implies a very similar shape of the p(z) distributions. This is somewhat puzzling at first. After all, we know that the full sample is 'worse' than the random one. Hence one would expect the p(z) distribution of the full sample to be skewed towards lower values, causing a steeper expected incompleteness fraction relative to the random sample. The reason the two p(z) distributions are nevertheless so similar is the fact that both the full and the random samples are dominated by spectra with Nop = 1, i.e. spectra that have not been re-redshifted (∼90 and ∼75 per cent, respectively). That means that the p(z) distributions of both samples essentially reflect their original Q distributions, although corrected for the biases of individual redshifters. Nevertheless, these distributions are too 'coarse' to capture the differences between the two samples. What we are seeing here is a fundamental limitation of the RUNZ dataset, which we already highlighted at the end of Section 2.3.3, namely that we are forced to measure a redshifter's probability of 'correctly' identifying a redshift, p(i, Q), as a function of the very coarse quality parameter Q, and that we cannot capture any variation of p(i, Q) within Q. This is a clear limitation of the predictive power and usefulness of our RUNZ p(z) values when Nop = 1, i.e. in the absence of any re-redshifting.</p>
        <p>For re-redshifted data with Nop &gt; 1, however, the situation is different. The green lines in Fig. 20 show the result of restricting both the full and the random sample to only those spectra with Nop &gt; 1. First, we note that the expected incorrectness fractions (green dashed lines) are now much lower than before for both samples, as they should be, since redshifts with independent confirmation should have a lower probability of being incorrect. Second, we note that the expected incorrectness fractions are now different for the two samples, in the sense one would expect, i.e. a lower fraction for the random sample. Furthermore, the observed incorrectness fraction for the random sample (solid dark green line) now largely agrees with the expectation, although the observations are plagued by low-number statistics. For the full sample, however, the observed incorrectness fraction is still much larger than the expectation. We attribute this to another fundamental limitation of the RUNZ data: as we have pointed out repeatedly throughout Section 2.3.2, p(z) does not represent the probability of a redshift being correct in any absolute sense. Instead, it is the probability that multiple redshifters, given the same data and code, will identify the same redshift. To see the difference, consider a low-S/N spectrum that shows only a single, marginally significant redshift. Since there are no other redshift candidates, it is likely that two or even three redshifters will agree that this is the best redshift. Even if each redshifter individually only assigns a low confidence (i.e. Q = 2), the agreement will nevertheless result in a reasonably high value of p(z), correctly indicating the likelihood that this is the 'best' redshift. However, that does not change the fact that the redshift is of only marginal significance and hence may well be wrong. In other words, p(z) does not incorporate any measure of the absolute significance of a redshift. 15 While the reasonable agreement between the observed and expected incorrectness fractions for the random sample indicates that this shortcoming does not affect the RUNZ redshifts on average, it does appear to affect the full sample which is biased towards spectra that are more difficult to redshift.</p>
        <p>We now turn to the AUTOZ results in Fig. 21. For the random sample the incorrectness fraction of all nQ 3 redshifts is just 0.2 per cent, a remarkably low value. This is vastly superior to the performance of RUNZ, even when restricting ourselves to the re-redshifted data. For the full sample, the incorrectness fraction is higher by a factor of ∼2, again confirming the biased nature of this sample. Note that for AUTOZ the comparison between the observed and expected incorrectness fractions does not represent an independent test of the reliability of the p(z) values (as was the case for RUNZ), because the duplicate redshifts were already used in establishing the relation between AUTOZ's figure of merit and p(z) (Baldry et al. 2014). The result that the observed incorrectness fractions are somewhat smaller than the expected ones for both samples simply confirms that this relation was calibrated quite conservatively.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, we find that AUTOZ significantly outperforms RUNZ (including re-redshifting) both in terms of the precision of the redshifts as well as in terms of producing a higher confidence in the redshifts. In addition, AUTOZ finds more nQ 3 redshifts than RUNZ (by 11 per cent). Thus, there is no trade-off: AUTOZ is unequivocally superior to RUNZ.</p>
        <p>Having discussed the GAMA spectroscopic survey in the previous two sections, we now turn towards the photometric side of GAMA. Our overall aim is to obtain photometric measurements of all GAMA main survey objects across the entire accessible wavelength range, from the X-ray to the radio regimes, in order to probe as wide a range of galaxy properties and processes as possible.</p>
        <p>To this end we collaborate with several independent imaging surveys, conducted our own observing campaigns, and draw on publicly available data from a number of sources. Table 4 provides an overview of the datasets that are currently being processed within GAMA. A comprehensive data release of GAMA photometry will be presented by Driver et al. (in preparation).</p>
        <p>In this section we focus on the optical, NIR and UV data. We provide an update of our aperture-matched optical and NIR photometry and describe for the first time our procedure of deriving UV photometry from GALEX data.</p>
        <p>Hill et al. ( 2011) first described our procedure to derive aperturematched multi-band photometry from SDSS and UKIDSS LAS imaging data, i.e. in the u, g, r, i, z, Y , J, H and K bands, for the GAMA I survey regions. We will shortly update these imaging data with deeper data from the ongoing VST KiDS and VISTA VIKING surveys. In the meantime, however, we have updated our photometric methods and procedures, which we describe in this section.</p>
        <p>In brief, the new v02 photometry improves on the original v01 photometry of Hill et al. (2011) in the following ways: (i) Visual inspection and validation of all UKIDSS LAS images used in the construction of the mosaics (see below) to overcome the previous inclusion of poor quality frames (including strongly defocused and trailed data). (ii) Consistent modelling of the point-spread function (PSF) across all data frames in all bands. Previously we had used the PSF information provided by the SDSS and UKIDSS LAS image headers. However, the two surveys employ different methods for measuring the PSF.</p>
        <p>We have downloaded all fully reduced images that overlap with the three GAMA I survey regions (cf. Table 1) from the SDSS DR7 and UKIDSS LAS DR6 and DR8 databases. For SDSS these were the fpC frames, while for UKIDSS LAS we used the stack and leavstack frames. Given the extent and diversity of these data it is clear that we need to homogenise them before we can obtain reliable multi-band photometry. Following Hill et al. (2011) we thus first construct homogenised master mosaic images, one for each region and band, and then use these mosaics to perform the photometry.</p>
        <p>We begin by visually inspecting all images to check their quality.</p>
        <p>A small number of frames in the NIR bands were discarded as a result of these checks, mostly because they were either out of focus or displayed a large amount of jitter. We discarded 33, 13, 49, and 48 frames in the Y , J, H and K bands, respectively. Even after removing these frames the coverage of the three GAMA I survey regions remains high: 95.2 per cent in Y and J, and 97.5 per cent in H and K. In Fig. 22 we show the coverage of our three survey regions in these bands in more detail. The coverage in the SDSS ugriz bands is essentially 100 per cent, excluding only small regions that were masked because of bright stars and artefacts. See Driver et al. (2011) for details of the GAMA mask. Next, we renormalise all frames to a common zero-point by multiplying each frame with an appropriate factor derived from the frame's original zero-point as given in its header. The common zero-point was chosen as 30 mag (Hill et al. 2011). Fig. 23 (top) shows the distributions of the seeing in all of our contributing frames for each band separately, as measured using PSFEX (Bertin 2011). Given the widths and offsets of these distributions it is clear that performing aperture-matched photometry on these images would yield poor-quality colour measurements. To ensure uniformity we therefore elect to degrade all of the imaging data to a uniform PSF FWHM of 2 arcsec, which is larger than the native PSF FWHM of essentially all of the NIR data and of ∼95 per cent of the SDSS data. To degrade a given image we convolve it with a Gaussian kernel of FWHM Γ 2 con = (2 arcsec) 2 -Γ 2 orig , where Γorig is the original PSF FWHM of the image. The middle panel of Fig. 23 shows the measured PSF FWHM distributions, again using PSFEX, after the convolution. The bottom panel shows a close-up version which highlights the residual widths of the final seeing distributions and their offsets from the target value of 2 arcsec. We believe these residual variations and offsets to be due to the non-Gaussian nature of the original PSFs. We elect not to refine the process further in anticipation of the higher quality data from the VST KiDS and VISTA VIKING surveys.</p>
        <p>At this point we have two sets of renormalised frames: those at native seeing and those convolved to a common PSF. While we require the PSF-homogenised data for our aperture-matched photometry, many other scientific applications, such as e.g. structural decomposition, require the data at their original resolution. Hence we now create two large format mosaics for each survey region and for each band, one using the convolved data, and one using the original data. To create these mosaics we use the code SWARP (Bertin et al. 2002). The mosaics are ∼15 × 5 deg 2 in size (i.e. substantially larger than the actual GAMA I survey regions) and have a pixel size of 0.339 arcsec (which is the pixel scale of VISTA). The mosaic creation process is essentially identical to that described by Hill et al. (2011).</p>
        <p>Aperture-matched photometry is performed on the convolved mosaics using the code IOTA, which is a wrapper around SEXTRAC-TOR (Bertin &amp; Arnouts 1996). IOTA takes as an input a list of positions at which to perform flux measurements. For the v02 photom- etry presented here, this list was generated by selecting all objects with SURVEY CLASS 3 from TilingCatv16, resulting in 152 742 galaxies. TilingCatv16 is the final GAMA I targeting catalogue and is entirely based on SDSS DR6 (see Baldry et al. 2010 and Section 5.1.2). For each object in this list and for each band, IOTA creates a 400 × 400 pixel image cutout from the PSFhomogenised mosaics around the object's position. It then runs SEXTRACTOR eight times in dual-image mode, each time using the r-band image as the detection image and one of the remaining images as the measurement image. In this way the Kron aperture used for flux measurements is defined in the r-band and is consistently applied to all other bands. IOTA then extracts the relevant information from the SEXTRACTOR output and associates them with the input object.</p>
        <p>We note that the above procedure of running SEXTRACTOR only over small image segments at pre-specified positions is significantly faster than running it over the entire mosaics.</p>
        <p>An important aspect of running SEXTRACTOR is the setting of its deblending parameters DEBLEND NTHRESH and DE-BLEND MINCONT. After some trial and error we now use the extreme values of 32 and 0.00005, respectively. These extreme values are required because the images have been low-pass filtered. In Fig. 24 we show an example of SEXTRACTOR's deblending choices for a reasonably complex region with the default settings of the deblending parameters (left) and with our settings (right). The improvement is evident.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, given the different codes and resolution of the data, one may ask to what extent the SDSS-defined objects of the input catalogue correspond to the SEXTRACTOR-defined objects derived here. Fig. 25 shows the offsets between the r-band input positions from the SDSS and the r-band positions found by SEX-TRACTOR. The red circles enclose 50, 90 and 99 per cent of the data. According to this diagnostic, at least, the correspondence is good.</p>
        <p>Fig. 26 provides a direct comparison between the v01 photometry of Hill et al. (2011) and the v02 photometry presented here. We note that both the mean offsets from zero and the standard deviations are all rather minor for the optical bands (as shown by the distributions of the magnitude differences in the right-hand panels), with the g, r, and i bands showing particularly small dispersions. However, in the NIR bands the differences between the v01 and the v02 photometry are significantly larger, both in terms of the mean offset and the dispersion. The primary reason for these differences is the change in the way we determine the width of the Gaussian kernel with which the images are convolved.</p>
        <p>The convolution of the mosaics with a Gaussian kernel obviously changes the error properties of the images dramatically. The resulting correlations among the errors on the pixel data is not taken into account by SEXTRACTOR, and hence the photometric errors calculated by SEXTRACTOR cannot be relied upon in any absolute sense. We will, however, assume that the SEXTRACTOR errors are meaningful in a relative sense. We thus rescale these errors in the following way:</p>
        <p>where σSEx and σ f are an object's SEXTRACTOR and final rescaled errors, respectively, and k1 and k2 are band-specific positive constants. In the ugriz bands, k1 and k2 are derived by minimising the differences between the mean values of σ f and of the SDSS DR6 Petrosian magnitude errors as a function of SDSS magnitude and aperture size. For the NIR data, k1 and k2 are derived by matching the UKIDSS LAS photometric errors as a function of magnitude only (as the UKIDSS LAS does not provide any aperture size information).</p>
        <p>Photometry in the rest-frame, non-ionizing UV wavelength regime is a sensitive probe of the star-formation activity of galaxies, and as such it plays an important role within GAMA's multi-wavelength campaign, enabling a wide range of studies of the connections between star formation activity and other galaxy properties. Moreover, in conjunction with measurements of the dust emission in the far-infrared and sub-mm regimes (provided by the Herschel-ATLAS data in the GAMA regions) and measurements of the size, inclination and morphology of galaxies, UV photometry provides the observational basis for a quantitative description of the transport of starlight in the dusty disks of spiral galaxies, allowing the relative contributions to the heating of dust by optical and UV photons to be separated. This, in turn, allows us to break the age/reddening degeneracy, to quantify the intrinsic emission of stars in galaxies throughout the UV-optical-NIR range, and to robustly determine the star formation histories of GAMA galaxies.</p>
        <p>In this section we describe our methods of deriving UV photometry for the GAMA survey regions from imaging data obtained with GALEX (Martin et al. 2005).</p>
        <p>Archival and newly obtained data from GALEX have been used to construct an imaging survey -the GALEX-GAMA survey -of 92 per cent of the area of the five GAMA II survey regions (cf. Table 1) to a detection limit for galaxies of at least mAB = 24.5 mag (0.59 µJy) in the GALEX near-ultraviolet (NUV) band (1750-2750 Å). In addition, 69 per cent of the GALEX NUV footprint are also covered in the GALEX far-ultraviolet (FUV) band (1350-1750 Å) to a limit of at least mAB = 24.3 mag (0.72 µJy). These limits correspond to the typical depth reached in the GAMA II regions 16 if an area of sky covered by the circular GALEX field of view, of diameter 1.2 deg, is continuously observed for the typical ∼1500 s duration spent by GALEX in eclipse in each orbit. This depth is commonly referred to as Medium Imaging Survey (MIS) depth, after the GALEX survey of selected regions of the sky observed in the same manner (Martin et al. 2005;Bianchi et al. 2014). As illustrated below, MIS-depth coverage has proved to be well matched to the spectroscopic depth of GAMA II, and is capable of detecting a galaxy with the present-day emergent NUV luminosity of the Milky Way out to a redshift of 0.53. Fig. 27 shows an exposure map of the MIS-depth coverage of the G15 region. This illustrates the closely packed, overlapping, hexagonal tiling pattern used to cover all of the GAMA II survey regions, which is only broken to avoid bright stars. This almost complete NUV coverage of the GAMA regions at MIS depth was achieved by combining archival data from previous MIS-depth programmes with those from two new programmes dedicated to GAMA. The latter were the GALEX guest observer programme GI5-0048, designed to complete the MIS-depth NUV coverage of GAMA's equatorial survey regions, and a program performed in the final year of GALEX operations (during its extended mission) to map the G23 region. Furthermore, the G02 region lies within the area of the multi-wavelength extension of the Cosmological Evolution Survey (COSMOS; Scoville et al. 2007). Hence it is completely covered to the 20 ks depth of the GALEX Deep Imaging Survey (DIS; Martin et al. 2005;Zamojski et al. 2007) in both the NUV and FUV bands. We point out that, due to the failure of the GALEX FUV detector in 2009, FUV coverage at MIS or greater 16 The quoted limits are the mean 2.5σ upper limits in integrated emission from the optically emitting regions of all undetected GAMA galaxies with total GALEX exposure times in the range 1400 to 1600 s. These limits therefore take into account the photon statistics integrated over the angular extent of the galaxies for the actual background levels encountered towards the GAMA regions at the epoch of the observations. Foreground extinction by dust in the Milky Way is not taken into account in these limits; over the GAMA II regions this dims galaxies by a median of 0.26 and 0.25 mag in the NUV and FUV, respectively. c 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1-40 depth is incomplete. FUV coverage is therefore primarily confined to G15 and G02, and partially extends to G09 and G12. Except in the vicinity of bright stars, all regions not covered to MIS depth are nevertheless covered in both bands by the GALEX All-Sky Imaging Survey (AIS; Martin et al. 2005;Bianchi et al. 2014) with a typical exposure time of 100 s.</p>
        <p>The starting point for our data analysis is the set of standard GALEX pipeline products described by Morrissey et al. (2007). Both the initial processing, done using the standard Caltech GALEX pipeline, as well as the subsequent analysis by the GAMA team, differ substantially according to the depth of the data, due to differing noise and blending characteristics. This results in three different sets of GALEX-GAMA products, one for each survey depth (AIS, MIS or DIS-depth). Since in DR2 we only release photometry derived from the MIS-depth data (see Section 5.1.7), we restrict our description below to the analysis of these data. A more complete description of this analysis, as well as of the analysis of the AIS and DIS-depth data, will be provided by Andrae et al. (in preparation).</p>
        <p>The resolution of the GALEX images is significantly lower than that of the SDSS data used to define the GAMA II sample: the FWHM of the PSF is 4.2 and 5.3 arcsec in the FUV and NUV bands, respectively (Morrissey et al. 2007). Given the faint flux levels and corresponding high source densities of the GAMA sample, we must therefore expect that a significant fraction of GALEX detections consist of the blended UV emission from multiple GAMA galaxies, and that the assignment of UV flux to GAMA objects is non-trivial.</p>
        <p>To address this issue we have employed three different methods to derive the NUV and FUV fluxes of each GAMA galaxy. We label these methods 'simple match photometry', 'advanced match photometry' and 'curve-of-growth (CoG) photometry', and we describe each of these in detail below. Briefly, the first method simply associates each GAMA object with its nearest neighbour GALEX source, as detected by the standard GALEX pipeline, within a maximum distance of 4 arcsec. The second method extends the first by identifying those cases where multiple GAMA and/or GALEX objects are associated with each other, and attempting to distribute the UV flux correctly among the GAMA objects involved. Finally, in our third method we go back to the GALEX imaging data and perform our own surface photometry at the known positions of GAMA objects. The UV fluxes found for a GAMA object by these three different methods are affected differently by blending, allowing the definition of objective criteria to decide which method should be used under which circumstances in order to minimise systematic errors in the photometry.</p>
        <p>The first two of the above methods use the catalogue of blind UV detections produced by the GALEX pipeline as an input. We therefore describe these data first.</p>
        <p>A catalogue of blind UV photometry for each GAMA II survey region was constructed by concatenating the catalogues of UV fluxes and UV structural parameters of discrete sources output by version 7.0.2 of the GALEX pipeline for each tile (generally corresponding to a single GALEX pointing in eclipse for MIS-depth coverage). As described by Morrissey et al. ( 2007), the source identification, background removal and shape fitting was done using a modified version of SEXTRAC-TOR (Bertin &amp; Arnouts 1996), adapted to handle the transition from Poisson-dominated backgrounds (as is generally the case for MISdepth FUV images) to Gaussian-dominated backgrounds (as is generally the case for MIS-depth NUV images).</p>
        <p>In the present analysis we made no attempt to combine the data on sources that lie in the overlap region of two or more tiles. In order to prevent multiple detections of the same source (on different tiles) entering our catalogue, we first had to associate each position in the GAMA II survey regions with a 'primary' tile. For regions of sky covered by more than one tile the primary was chosen firstly according to whether or not a tile has unmasked MIS-depth FUV coverage at the position under consideration, and secondly according to the effective exposure time in the NUV.</p>
        <p>A key characteristic of the blind catalogue is that the source detection and the definition of the aperture for photometry are performed exclusively in the NUV band. The FUV flux of each NUVdetected source was then measured using the NUV-defined aperture. This procedure was adopted because of: (i) the more complete sky coverage in the NUV compared to the FUV; (ii) the improved precision of FUV-NUV colours; (iii) the smoother background in the NUV, where it is dominated by zodiacal light, compared to the FUV, where it is more highly structured due to a larger fractional contribution from cirrus structure in the interstellar medium of the Milky Way. Since the measurement error depends on the local brightness of the background, the contents of the blind catalogue more closely approximate a flux-limited sample when selected according to detectability in the NUV rather than in the FUV. Because at MIS-depth NUV sensitivity is very similar to FUV sensitivity for typical galaxies, and because almost all stars are more easily detected in the NUV, relatively few sources are missed due to the choice not to consider sources that might be detected in the FUV but not in the NUV.</p>
        <p>We note that the GALEX blind catalogue does not include all NUV detections. Instead it is limited to those sources that are detected at a significance of at least 2.5σ in the NUV.</p>
        <p>In the simple match photometry method we positionally match the NUV-detected sources from the blind catalogue above to the optically detected GAMA objects in the GAMA II input catalogue. In this process the match to a GAMA object is considered to be the nearest GALEX source in the blind catalogue within a maximum distance of 4 arcsec. Matches can of course involve any type of object contained in the input catalogue, including galaxies that are spectroscopic targets, fainter galaxies, and stars (down to the input catalogue's limit of r = 20 mag).</p>
        <p>The main parameters of the matched GALEX source, such as its NUV position, ellipticity, size, and NUV and FUV fluxes, are included in the simple match catalogue. We point out that, as a consequence of the blind catalogue construction, the NUV flux of a GAMA object in the simple match catalogue is guaranteed to have a statistical significance of at least 2.5σ, whereas the significance of the corresponding FUV flux measurement may often fall below this level. Indeed, the flux may even be negative.</p>
        <p>GAMA objects without a nearest neighbour in the blind catalogue within 4 arcsec are considered to be unmatched, and were not included in the simple match catalogue. To be able to distinguish between GAMA objects that were not detected in the NUV and those that were not covered by GALEX (at MIS-depth) we also constructed a catalogue containing basic observational information for each GAMA object. This includes the effective exposure time and background level, the corresponding point source detection limit, as well as any map flags influencing the object's detectability, for Object number densities of various samples of GAMA galaxies in the colour-magnitude plane spanned by NUV-r colour and absolute r-band magnitude. The contours are drawn at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 per cent of the total source number density. In the left panel we only use GAMA objects that have an unambiguous (i.e. one-to-one) match with a single GALEX source. The outermost contour in this panel (marked in red) is reproduced in the other panels for comparison. In the middle panel we only use those objects that are not unambiguously matched to a single GALEX source, and we use the NUV flux from its nearest GALEX neighbour, i.e. as returned by the simple match procedure. In the right panel we use the same objects as in the middle panel, but we now use the redistributed NUV flux as returned by the advanced match procedure.</p>
        <p>both the NUV and FUV bands. We note that the detection threshold for the integrated flux of UV extended sources will be higher than the given threshold for a point source, and can in principle be calculated for any hypothesised size and shape of the UV source using the effective exposure time and background level quoted in this catalogue.</p>
        <p>A useful indicator of objects potentially affected by blending is provided in the simple match catalogue by two columns specifying the total number of sources in the GALEX blind catalogue within the maximum matching radius of 4 arcsec, and the total number of (other) GAMA objects to which the UV source has (also) been matched. If one or both of these numbers is &gt; 1, then it is possible that blending may affect the UV fluxes assigned to the GAMA object. In this circumstance either the advanced match or the CoG technique is to be preferred. Conversely, both numbers being unity indicates a one-to-one match (57 per cent of cases). In these cases we consider the GALEX pipeline flux measurements the most accurate (unless the galaxy is very extended, see below).</p>
        <p>The advanced match photometry method addresses the issue of blending by carefully identifying cases where multiple GAMA and GALEX objects are associated with each other, and then distributing the UV flux from the GALEX sources among the GAMA objects based on our knowledge of the NUV and r-band positions and sizes of all of the involved objects. This is a further development of the method introduced by Robotham &amp; Driver (2011).</p>
        <p>The GAMA and GALEX objects considered in the advanced match are the same as in the previous section. In a first step, optical shape information for each GAMA object, taken from the single-component Sérsic model fits of Kelvin et al. (2012), is used to define a target area within which any UV sources listed in the blind catalogue are deemed to be at least in part associated with the GAMA object, and therefore contributing UV flux to the GAMA object. A circular area with a radius of 4 arcsec (the maximum matching radius used for the simple matching) is adopted for unresolved or compact GAMA objects.</p>
        <p>In a second step, for each UV source within the target area we make a list of any other GAMA objects in the input catalogue which lie within the NUV elliptical footprint of the GALEX source. For one-to-one matches, all of the UV flux of the GALEX source is allocated to the GAMA object (in which case the advanced match pro-cedure returns the same NUV and FUV fluxes for a given GAMA object as the simple match procedure). If, however, there are more than one GALEX objects in the target area, or if more than one potential optical counterpart to one or more of the GALEX sources in the target area is found, then the NUV and FUV fluxes of each of the GALEX objects are split among all optical counterparts of that source, weighted inversely by angular distance (using a minimum distance of 0.3 arcsec to account for positional uncertainties). This weighting is motivated by the expectation that the position of a blended UV detection returned by the GALEX pipeline (i.e. by SEXTRACTOR) is simply the flux-weighted mean position of the individual UV emitters contributing to the blend. Finally, the UV flux contributions to the target GAMA object from all of the GALEX sources in the target area are summed, to obtain the total redistributed NUV and FUV fluxes of the object. The object is then included in the advanced match catalogue if its total NUV flux resulting from the redistribution has a statistical significance of more than 2.5σ.</p>
        <p>We note that a GAMA object may be included in the advanced match catalogue but not in the simple match catalogue, and vice versa. The former happens when a GAMA object is offset from its nearest GALEX neighbour by more than the maximum matching radius of 4 arcsec, but still receives flux from one or more UV sources as a result of the flux redistribution. This might for example happen when the centroid of the resolved UV emission of an extended galaxy is offset by more than the matching radius from the galaxy's r-band position. The latter (more common) case happens when the redistributed flux received by a GAMA object is less than 2.5σ. This commonly happens when the flux of a single UV source is shared among multiple GAMA objects. Indeed, in general, the main effect of the flux redistribution is to lower the UV fluxes assigned to GAMA objects.</p>
        <p>A demonstration that this flux redistribution actually improves the measurement of the UV flux of GAMA galaxies in a statistical sense is shown in Fig. 28, which shows the distribution of GAMA objects in the plane spanned by NUV-r colour and r-band absolute magnitude. In the left panel we only use objects with unambiguous (i.e. one-to-one) matches with GALEX objects. This sample provides a benchmark for the true colour-magnitude distribution. In the other two panels we use those objects that are not unambiguously matched to a single GALEX object, but instead are involved in a one-to-many, many-to-one or many-to-many match. In the middle panel we use the NUV flux returned by the simple match procedure, in the right panel we use that returned by the advanced match procedure. We can see that the multiple matches, if using the NUV flux returned by the simple match, are biased towards bluer NUV-r colours by about 0.2 mag, due to the effect of blending boosting the NUV fluxes. This bias is, however, not present when using the redistributed NUV flux returned by the advanced match technique, which recovers a very similar colour-magnitude distribution as that of the one-to-one matches. Also apparent in the middle and right panels is a slight shift of the distribution towards brighter absolute magnitudes compared to the one-to-one matched sample. This arises because luminous sources are more extended, and are therefore more likely to have multiple matches than fainter, unresolved sources.</p>
        <p>Curve-of-growth photometry Our final photometric method involves performing surface photometry on the GALEX images at the (optically defined) location of each GAMA galaxy, using a CoG technique with an automated edge detection algorithm. To this end we reprocessed all MIS-depth data using version 7
            <rs type="version">.0.2</rs> of the GALEX pipeline, resulting in various maps for each tile and for each band, of which we use count maps, background maps, effective exposure maps and flag maps for the CoG analysis. In addition, all images were visually inspected to flag reflection artefacts from bright stars on neighbouring tiles, which escape automatic flagging in the GALEX pipeline.
        </p>
        <p>Unlike the simple and advanced match photometry, CoG photometry is only performed for galaxies that are spectroscopic targets, as defined by the GAMA II tiling catalogue. For each target galaxy, a cutout is made from the pipeline map with the longest exposure time. The maps are masked over the areas covered by all known unrelated sources in both the r-band (as listed in the GAMA II input catalogue and using the shape and size information from the single-component Sérsic catalogue of Kelvin et al. 2012) and in the NUV (as listed in the blind catalogue). In addition, all pixels marked in the flag map as being affected by window and dichroic reflections are masked.</p>
        <p>Radial profiles in NUV and FUV brightness are then constructed by measuring the mean brightness of all unmasked pixels in elliptical annuli. The ellipticity of these annuli is determined by the convolution of the GALEX PSF with the footprint of the galaxy as returned by the single-Sérsic fits of Kelvin et al. (2012). An edge detection algorithm is then employed to identify the elliptical aperture which, on the one hand, encloses all flux from a source as completely as possible without imposing any preconception on the extent or shape of the radial profile of the source, while on the other hand minimising the aperture area and hence the noise. This algorithm, described fully by Andrae et al. (in preparation), compares measurements of the brightness interior and exterior of a hypothesised edge of the source, averaged over radial extents optimised for the noise and structural characteristics of the underlying background. Because the size of galaxies may be systematically different in the NUV and FUV (e.g., extended UV disks around galaxies often have very blue FUV-NUV colours; Gil de Paz et al. 2005) we determine the source's edge separately in both bands. Once the aperture is defined, the background is determined in the optimised region exterior to the aperture, and subtracted from the flux inside the aperture. The integrated flux of the source is then taken as the sum of the remaining flux inside the aperture. The uncertainty on this flux is computed taking into account the measured fluctuations on the background, thus incorporating the contribution of background structure to the uncertainty. The ratio of the NUV flux returned by the CoG method to that returned by the advanced match method for all GAMA galaxies detected by the CoG and advanced match techniques, as a function of the semi-major axis as measured by the 
            <rs type="software">GALEX</rs> pipeline. The vertical errorbars indicate the 1σ spread in flux ratios in each bin. Black symbols show the ratios for galaxies with one-to-one matches, red symbols for galaxies with one-to-two or two-to-one matches, and blue symbols for galaxies involved in multiple matches.
        </p>
        <p>In cases where no clear edge can be detected, due to the galaxy not being sufficiently bright, the semi-major axis of the elliptical aperture is defined as being three times the effective radius of the galaxy as measured in the single-Sérsic fits in r-band, after convolution with the GALEX PSF. Even though in such cases the returned integrated fluxes can be lower than the 2.5σ threshold adopted for inclusion of sources in the simple and advanced match catalogues, or even negative, such sources are retained in the CoG catalogue. This is due to the inherently different approach of measuring the UV flux at the known positions of GAMA galaxies, which will allow statistical analyses of populations of individually non-detected galaxies (e.g. stacking analyses).</p>
        <p>We have performed a number of tests of, and comparisons among, the three different photometry methods described above, including the insertion of artificial galaxies into the data and comparing the input and recovered fluxes. These will be discussed in detail by Andrae et al. (in preparation). In summary, we find the GALEX pipeline photometry to be reliable for objects that are not affected by blending and are not too large. The CoG method, on the other hand, has proved to be the most robust method to measure the UV fluxes of GAMA objects that are blended with other objects in the UV, and of very extended objects.</p>
        <p>For blended objects the CoG method of measuring the UV flux in an aperture whose position and shape is determined by the higher resolution optical data, while masking out other nearby objects, turned out to be more accurate than the advanced match method of indiscriminately sharing the UV flux among nearby GAMA objects.</p>
        <p>For very extended objects we also believe our CoG photometry to be the most robust. In Fig. 29 we show the ratio of CoG flux to that returned by the advanced match method, as a function of the GALEX pipeline NUV semi-major axis of the the nearest neighbour GALEX object. We can see that this ratio systematically drops below one for sizes larger than 20 arcsec, even for those objects that are not affected by blending (shown in black). In these all GAMA galaxies all GAMA galaxies z&lt; 0.13 spheroidal z&lt; 0.13 spiral z&lt; 0.13</p>
        <p>Figure 30. NUV detection rate as a function of r-band magnitude. The black crosses show the detection rate for all spectroscopic targets. The green squares show the detection rate for galaxies with z &lt; 0.13 where reliable morphological classification using the method of Grootes et al. (2014) is possible. The red crosses and blue diamonds show the detection rates for spheroidal and spiral galaxies at z &lt; 0.13, respectively.</p>
        <p>cases the UV flux returned by the advanced match method is simply the GALEX pipeline flux of the nearest neighbour GALEX object. Since we have tested the accuracy of our CoG photometry even for large galaxies using simulations, we believe the GALEX pipeline photometry to be flawed for these objects.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, for smaller objects unaffected by blending we consider the GALEX pipeline photometry to be superior to our CoG photometry. The reason is that the GALEX pipeline's procedure of fitting a simple parametric model to the source, and then integrating over this model to obtain the total flux, results in lower random noise than that accumulated by integrating over an aperture. This decrease in random noise, however, comes at the expense of an increased systematic error when the source morphology is too complex to be adequately represented by the simple models used by the GALEX pipeline, which is the case both for very well-resolved and for blended sources.</p>
        <p>We thus define the 'best' UV photometry to be that returned by the CoG method when the NUV semi-major axis is larger than 20 arcsec or when the GAMA object does not have an unambiguous counterpart in the GALEX blind catalogue, in which cases systematic errors dominate. In all other cases, where random errors dominate, we use the fluxes returned by the simple match technique as the 'best' photometry.</p>
        <p>In Fig. 30 we show as black crosses the NUV detection rate of all GAMA galaxies that are spectroscopic targets as a function of their r-band magnitude. This confirms that the MIS depth of the GALEX data is reasonably well matched to the depth of the GAMA II spectroscopic survey, providing a detection rate of 72 per cent at the survey's limit of r = 19.8 mag. Grootes et al. (2014) showed that at least at low redshift (z &lt; 0.13) it is possible to morphologically classify galaxies using a proxy that only involves the photometric quantities i-band magnitude, Sérsic index and r-band effective radius. Applying this classification to our sample, we also show in Fig. 30 the NUV detection rates separately for spiral and spheroidal galaxies (blue diamonds and red crosses, respectively). We can see that at z &lt; 0.13 the detection rate of spirals stays at a level of at least 90 per cent for all magnitudes. In contrast, the NUV detection rate of spheroids falls continuously from 100 per cent at r ≈ 17 mag to ∼40 per cent at r = 19.8 mag.</p>
        <p>Following the first public data release (DR1) described by Driver et al. (2011), we now present the second public release of GAMA data (DR2), which is available at http://www.gama-survey.org/dr2/, in this final part of the paper.</p>
        <p>In summary, DR2 provides AAT/AAOmega spectra, redshifts and a wealth of ancillary information for 72 225 objects from GAMA I. These data are served by the GAMA DR2 database, which consists of a 
            <rs type="software">MySQL</rs> database and a data file server. The 
            <rs type="software">MySQL</rs> database contains all of the catalogues that are part of DR2, as well as the accompanying meta-data. The file server hosts the actual data files, i.e. all spectra and catalogues. Public access to the DR2 database is provided by a web interface at the above URL.
        </p>
        <p>DR2 represents a significant extension of DR1. In DR1 we released spectra and redshifts only from the first year of observations, and only for targets with r &lt; 19.0 mag (except for a very narrow strip in G12). In contrast, DR2 includes data from all of GAMA I (i.e. from the first three years of observations), and extends the limiting magnitude in one of the survey regions to r = 19.4 mag. We also provide additional information such as SFRs, stellar masses and group data, which was not present in DR1.</p>
        <p>Overall, DR2 differs significantly from DR1, not only in terms of the data being released, but also in the way in which the data are served. In this section we thus describe the various aspects of DR2 in more detail.</p>
        <p>We begin this section by explaining the selection of the objects included in DR2. In DR2 we are releasing data for all GAMA I main survey objects with r &lt; 19.0 mag in survey regions G09 and G12, and for all objects with r &lt; 19.4 mag in region G15. Refer to Table 1 for the definition of the GAMA I survey regions. Note that for G15 we are essentially releasing all GAMA I data. The total number of objects included in DR2 is 72 225. Of these, 70 726 objects have secure redshifts. The overall redshift completeness of the DR2 sample is thus 97.9 per cent. Split by survey regions the completeness is 97.7, 98.8 and 97.5 per cent in G09, G12 and G15, respectively.</p>
        <p>As described in Section 2.1, the qualifier 'GAMA I' above refers to the fact that the objects for DR2 were selected from the input catalogue for the first phase of the GAMA survey (InputCatAv05). DR2 only contains data for main survey targets, data for filler targets (cf. Section 2.1) are not included. The r-band selection magnitude above is the Petrosian r-band magnitude from SDSS DR6 (Adelman-McCarthy et al. 2008), corrected for Galactic extinction.</p>
        <p>For the above objects DR2 provides all spectra obtained in GAMA I, publicly available spectra from previous surveys in the GAMA I regions, input catalogue and targeting information, red- shifts, 17 optical and NIR (u to K) aperture-matched photometry derived from SDSS and UKIDSS LAS imaging data, photometry and structural parameters from single-component Sérsic fits in the same bands, FUV and NUV photometry from GALEX, kcorrections, stellar masses, spectral line measurements and Hαderived SFRs, three different environment measures (only for G15), and last, but by no means least, the GAMA Galaxy Group Catalogue (G 3 C, again for G15 only).</p>
        <p>In the following we will describe each of these datasets in turn. Before we can continue, however, we must introduce another piece of GAMA vocabulary. The GAMA data flow has been broken up into individual tasks which are performed by what we refer to as Data Management Units (DMUs). Each DMU performs a specific data reduction or data analysis step on some input data, and as a result produces some output, which is stored in the GAMA database. A DMU's output (also referred to as the DMU's products) may consist of pixel data, one or more tables, or other advanced data products, and always includes the meta-data required to use these data in a scientific context. The modular structure of the data flow provides a convenient and natural structure for the database, and we will follow this structure in the description of the DR2 data that follows.</p>
        <p>Finally, we point out that more detailed, exhaustive descriptions are available from the DR2 web pages as part of the metadata accompanying the DMU products. Appropriate references to the GAMA literature or to previous sections of the present paper are also provided in each section below.</p>
        <p>DR2 provides all 59 345 spectra of DR2 objects that were obtained at the AAT as part of the GAMA I survey, including all duplicate observations. These data were obtained, reduced and calibrated using the procedures described by Robotham et al. (2010), Driver 17 DR2 only includes RUNZ redshifts. AUTOZ redshifts will be made available in the next data release. et al. ( 2011) and Hopkins et al. (2013). The spectra cover the wavelength range 3740-8850 Å at a resolution of R = λ/∆λ ≈ 1000 at the blue end increasing to R ≈ 1600 at the red end, and with a pixel size of 1.04 Å.</p>
        <p>The spectra are provided as FITS files. Each FITS file contains the fully reduced, sky-subtracted, wavelength-calibrated, telluric absorption-corrected and flux-calibrated spectrum, the reduced spectrum without flux calibration, the corresponding 1σ error arrays, and the mean sky spectrum of the field from which this spectrum was taken. We show a typical example spectrum in Fig. 31.</p>
        <p>DR2 also includes 19 spectra of fibre-bright DR2 objects obtained at the Liverpool Telescope (LT). The observing and data reduction procedures for these spectra are described in Section 2.8. Again, the fully reduced spectra are provided as FITS files. Note that these spectra are not flux-calibrated.</p>
        <p>Beyond these spectra obtained by the GAMA team, DR2 also provides publicly available spectra from previous surveys covering the GAMA I survey regions, as listed in Table 5. In total, we have obtained 30 828 spectra (including all duplicate observations for completeness) from the databases of the various surveys. The FITS files containing these spectra provided by DR2 are essentially those of the originating surveys, except that multiple extensions (sometimes used to store duplicate observations) were extracted to individual files. For each spectrum we have also added a number of GAMA standard keywords to the FITS header in order to provide some homogeneity across all spectra. Note that only the spectra from the SDSS are flux-calibrated.</p>
        <p>In total we thus provide 90 192 spectra of the 72 225 unique objects included in DR2.</p>
        <p>The InputCat DMU provides various input catalogues for the spectroscopic survey. Baldry et al. (2010) described the construction of these catalogues in detail, and so we only provide a brief summary here. InputCatA is the master input catalogue. It was constructed from various queries to the SDSS DR6 PhotoObj table and contains only information from that table. In addition, 
            <rs type="software">InputCatA</rs> introduces a unique numeric GAMA object identifier, 
            <rs type="software">CATAID</rs>, which is always used in GAMA tables when referring to objects.
        </p>
        <p>TilingCat is, as the name suggests, the catalogue from which we actually select objects for observation. As described in more detail by Baldry et al. (2010), it is derived from InputCatA by applying magnitude limits, star-galaxy separation criteria, surface-brightness limits, and our mask. It also contains information on the best available redshift (if any) for each object, and it is this catalogue that we use to keep track of the state of the survey. During survey operations it is updated as soon as new redshifts are available (whereas InputCatA remains static). The version of this catalogue released in DR2 is the final GAMA I version (i.e. after the completion of all GAMA I observations).</p>
        <p>Note that this table contains the entire tiling catalogue, not just the objects for which redshifts are released in DR2. Objects included in DR2 may be identified using the column DR2 FLAG. Those objects for which redshifts are not released in DR2 have their redshift column Z set to -9.99999. However, the redshift quality column NQ (see Section 2.3.4 for a definition) has not been modified, so this column informs users whether a good quality redshift for this object exists (but is not yet released).</p>
        <p>SpStandards is a table of standard stars, again selected from SDSS DR6. In each 2dF/AAOmega field that we have observed so far, we have assigned a small number of fibres (typically 3) to calibration stars picked from this table. These standard star spectra have been used to tie all of our AAOmega spectra to the SDSS spectrophotometric calibration, at least in an average sense, as described in detail by Hopkins et al. (2013).</p>
        <p>Finally, this DMU includes the table Galactic-Extinction, which provides the Galactic foreground extinction in all GALEX, MGC, SDSS and UKIDSS bands for every object in InputCatA and 
            <rs type="software">SpStandards</rs>, using the dust maps of Schlegel et al. (1998) and the relative extinction values listed in Table 6.
        </p>
        <p>There are two DMUs that provide spectra and redshift catalogues: while the ExternalSpec DMU is only concerned with spectra and redshifts from previous surveys, the SpecCat DMU provides all catalogues related to GAMA's own spectroscopic data, as well as the final catalogues that combine all available GAMA and external data. We already mentioned in Section 5.1.1 above that DR2 includes publicly available spectra from previous surveys (cf. Table 5). These spectra are tabulated in the catalogue ExternalSpecAll of the ExternalSpec DMU. This table identifies the spectra by their unique GAMA SPECID, provides their locations on the DR2 file server, and lists, among other properties, their redshifts. Note that these are the redshifts published by the originating surveys; we have not attempted to re-measure them. We have, however, translated the various redshift quality parameters provided by the originating surveys to our nQ system (see Section 2.3.4) for ease of use.</p>
        <p>For each spectrum this table also identifies the GAMA object the spectrum was matched to. The matching GAMA object is defined as the object closest to the position at which the spectrum was recorded (within a maximum of 2 arcsec) in the catalogue resulting from the union of TilingCat and SpStandards from the InputCat DMU (see previous section).</p>
        <p>Frequently, multiple spectra from the same survey are matched to the same object (because we have included all duplicate observations). For each spectrum in ExternalSpecAll we thus ask (and flag the spectrum accordingly) whether it is the one from its originating survey that provides the most reliable redshift of its matched object. 18 The set of spectra thus flagged is provided as the table ExternalSpec for convenience. This table has all intra-survey duplications removed, but still retains the inter-survey ones.</p>
        <p>Finally, the ExternalSpec DMU also provides the table ExternalzAll which contains a small number of redshifts for DR2 objects from NED and the UZC (Falco et al. 1999). The original spectra from which these redshifts were measured are not available to GAMA, and are hence not included in DR2.</p>
        <p>Moving on to the SpecCat DMU, the table AATFields lists all 392 2dF/AAOmega observations (fields) obtained at the AAT as part of the GAMA I survey. Each of these observations delivered on average 345 spectra of galaxy targets. AATFields provides information pertaining to an entire field, such as its date and time of observation, total exposure time, number of galaxy tar-gets and calibration stars observed, and rudimentary redshift success statistics.</p>
        <p>As described extensively in Section 2.3, all spectra collected for GAMA at the AAT were redshifted at the telescope using the code RUNZ, and many were redshifted again subsequently, in part multiple times. The table AATRunzResults contains the complete redshifting results (i.e. essentially the RUNZ output) for all GAMA AAT spectra that are part of DR2.</p>
        <p>AATSpecAllzAll is a table containing one line for each GAMA AAT spectrum in DR2, summarising all of the (re-)redshifting results for this spectrum, as well as listing the results of the analysis to determine the 'best' redshift based on the reliabilities of the redshifters (see Section 2.3.4).</p>
        <p>The table 
            <rs type="software">AATSpecAll</rs> again contains one line for each GAMA AAT spectrum included in DR2, giving its 'best' redshift as well as listing a number of other properties of the spectrum, including its location on the DR2 file server. It also identifies the object that was targeted. Note that duplicate observations of the same object are retained in this table. As in table ExternalSpecAll, we again flag the spectrum that provides the most reliable redshift for a given object.
        </p>
        <p>As described in Section 2.8, a small number of fibre-bright targets were not observed at the AAT but rather at the LT. These spectra are tabulated in LTSpecAll, along with their redshifts and their location on the DR2 file server.</p>
        <p>The table SpecAll then synthesises much of the information above. It combines tables AATSpecAll and LTSpecAll with tables ExternalSpecAll and ExternalzAll from the ExternalSpec DMU, thus providing a complete list of all spectra and redshifts that are available for the objects included in DR2, including GAMA spectra and those from previous spectroscopic surveys. Note that all duplicate observations of the same object are still retained in this table.</p>
        <p>Finally, the table SpecObj contains one line for each object named as a target in SpecAll, giving details of the spectrum that provides the most reliable redshift (from GAMA or otherwise, thus purging all intra and inter-survey duplications), including of course the redshift and its quality. Note that this table contains 72 213 objects, which is 12 fewer than the number of objects nominally included in DR2. For these 12 objects DR2 simply contains no spectroscopic or redshift data.</p>
        <p>We expect that table SpecObj is the table most users will be most interested in, along with the table TilingCat in the InputCat DMU (which also contains the best redshifts, see Section 5.1.2 above). We point out that all GAMA redshifts provided in DR2 are RUNZ redshifts. The AUTOZ redshifts will be included in the next data release.</p>
        <p>The LocalFlowCorrection DMU transforms our redshifts to various reference frames, and provides redshifts and distance moduli corrected for the local flow. Specifically, the heliocentric redshifts provided by the SpecAll table in the SpecCat DMU (with z &gt; -0.01 and nQ 2) are transformed to the reference frame of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) using the dipole of Lineweaver et al. (1996), and to that of the Local Group using the prescription of Courteau &amp; van den Bergh (1999). The local flow correction uses the flow model of Tonry et al. (2000). The details of these transformations are described in section 2.3 of Baldry et al. (2012).</p>
        <p>The ApMatchedPhotom DMU provides Kron and Petrosian aperture-matched photometry covering the ugrizY JHK bands for all DR2 objects. As described in detail in Section 4.1, this photometry was derived from processed SDSS and UKIDSS LAS imaging data using 
            <rs type="software">SEXTRACTOR</rs>. The original images were renormalised to a common zero-point of 30 mag, convolved with Gaussians to a common PSF, resampled to a common grid with a pixel size of 0.339 arcsec, and then combined into very large mosaics, one for each of the above bands and for each of the three GAMA I survey regions. 
            <rs type="software">SEXTRACTOR</rs> was then run eight times in dual-image mode on small regions of these mosaics corresponding to the positions of the objects in TilingCat. Each time the r-band image was used as the detection image while the image in one of the other bands was used as the measurement image, thus ensuring identical, r-defined apertures for the flux measurements in all bands.
        </p>
        <p>Table ApMatchedCat provides the above photometry (along with various other SEXTRACTOR outputs) for all DR2 objects. We also release the 27 mosaics from which the photometry was derived.</p>
        <p>We point out that we have recently discovered, from comparisons with VIKING and 2MASS data, an apparent zero-point offset in our photometry derived from the UKIDSS LAS data. The cause of this offset is at present not fully understood. This issue will be described in more detail in a future paper presenting the GAMA II panchromatic photometry (Driver et al., in preparation). In the meantime, users may wish to consider applying the following zero-point offsets to bring the photometry presented in table ApMatchedCat into agreement with VIKING: mcorr = mDR2 -(0.13, 0.12, 0.07, 0.11) for Y , J, H, K, respectively.</p>
        <p>The SersicPhotometry DMU provides the results of fitting a single-component Sérsic model (Sérsic 1968;Graham &amp; Driver 2005) to the two-dimensional surface brightness distribution of every GAMA DR2 object in each of the bands ugrizY JHK independently. This is achieved by using the code Structural Investigation of Galaxies via Model Analysis (SIGMA v0.9-0) on processed SDSS and UKIDSS LAS imaging data. SIGMA is a wrapper around SEXTRACTOR (Bertin &amp; Arnouts 1996), PSFEX (Bertin 2011) and GALFIT v3 (Peng et al. 2010). The code, the fitting procedure and the results are described in detail by Kelvin et al. (2012), and so we only provide a brief summary here.</p>
        <p>For a given input galaxy and band SIGMA proceeds as follows: (1) An image of appropriate size is cut out from the appropriate mosaic (see Section 4.1; here we use the mosaics that were constructed from the renormalised images at their original resolution); (2) SEX-TRACTOR is run over the image using parameters optimised for the detection of unresolved sources; (3) detected objects originating from the same original imaging data as the target galaxy are fed into PSFEX in order to determine the PSF at the location of the target galaxy; (4) SEXTRACTOR is re-run over the image, this time with parameters optimised for the detection of extended sources;</p>
        <p>(5) 
            <rs type="software">GALFIT</rs> is used to fit a single-component Sérsic model to the target galaxy; neighbouring objects are either included in the fit or masked, as appropriate, and the initial values of the various fitting parameters are based on the SEXTRACTOR output; (6) several sanity checks are conducted to assess whether a catastrophic error has occurred, and, if necessary, the object is re-fit with alternative con- straints (e.g. additional background smoothing, different masking vs. modelling choices); (8) all output information from the entire process is collated before moving on to the next band or object.
        </p>
        <p>The above process results in the table SersicCatAll which comprises no fewer than 531 columns. In addition to GALFIT output for each band, this includes all of the PSFEX and SEXTRACTOR output for completeness. For ease of use, we thus also provide the table SersicCat, which only contains the most useful subset of these columns.</p>
        <p>In addition to these two tables we also make available the image cutouts and PSF images used as inputs to the modelling process (the location of a galaxy's data on the file server is given in SersicCat), as well as the full original-resolution mosaics. Finally, for each galaxy and band we provide convenient summary plots showing the result of the fit. We show four examples of these plots in Fig. 32, for a bright (top) and faint (bottom) galaxy, in the r (left) and K bands (right).</p>
        <p>One frequent use of modelling the surface brightness distribution of a galaxy is to obtain an estimate of its total flux (as opposed to the flux measured in an aperture) by integrating the model to infinity. However, given the varied behaviour of the surface brightness profiles of especially late-type spiral galaxies at large radii, which frequently show both downturns and upturns (e.g. Pohlen &amp; Trujillo 2006), it is not clear that integration to infinity is justified. On the other hand, it is not a priori clear where to truncate the integration either. We refer the reader to section 4.3.3 of Kelvin et al. (2012) for a discussion of this issue, and simply point out here that 
            <rs type="software">SersicCat</rs> provides Sérsic magnitudes integrated both to infinity and to 10 effective radii, and that we recommend using the latter.
        </p>
        <p>The GalexPhotometry DMU provides GALEX FUV and NUV photometry for all DR2 objects that were detected by GALEX. The data, photometric procedures and matching were detailed in Section 4.2, and so here we only describe the structure of the GalexPhotometry DMU.</p>
        <p>The table 
            <rs type="software">GalexPhot</rs> provides GALEX NUV and FUV photometry in the GAMA I survey regions. The data in this table were derived using the GALEX SEXTRACTOR-based pipeline without any reference to any GAMA data (see Section 4.2.2.1). In other words, these are the 'blind' GALEX detections in the GAMA I survey regions. The table was restricted to primary sources with S/N 2.5 in the NUV band.
        </p>
        <p>The table 
            <rs type="software">GalexSimpleMatch</rs> contains the result of a simple nearest neighbour match (see Section 4.2.2.2) between 
            <rs type="software">GalexPhot</rs> and the table InputCatA from the InputCat DMU (see Section 5.1.2 above), listing only the objects included in DR2. GAMA DR2 objects without a GALEX nearest neighbour within a distance of 4 arcsec are considered unmatched and are not included in this table.
        </p>
        <p>The table 
            <rs type="software">GalexAdvancedMatch</rs> contains the result of an advanced match between 
            <rs type="software">GalexPhot</rs> and InputCatA, again only listing objects included in DR2. The advanced matching procedure attempts to reconstruct the true UV flux of a given GAMA object in cases where multiple GAMA and GALEX objects are associated with each other (see Section 4.2.2.3). GAMA DR2 objects without a GALEX match are not included in this catalogue.
        </p>
        <p>In addition to the GALEX-pipeline-generated photometry of 'blind' GALEX detections presented in table GalexPhot, the table GalexCoGPhot provides NUV and FUV photometric measurements of all GAMA DR2 objects at their a priori known opti-cal positions using a curve-of-growth method (see Section 4.2.2.4). We deem this photometry to be superior to that generated by the GALEX pipeline in some circumstances.</p>
        <p>The table GalexMain is, as the name suggests, the main catalogue of this DMU. It should cover the needs of most users. It duplicates the most important information from the other tables in this DMU, and provides estimates of the 'best' NUV and FUV fluxes for all GAMA DR2 objects that were detected by GALEX, i.e. an appropriate choice is made between the GALEX pipeline photometry and the curve-of-growth photometry (see Section 4.2.2.5).</p>
        <p>Finally, the table 
            <rs type="software">GalexObsInfo</rs> provides basic GALEX observational information, i.e. exposure times, background levels and GALEX pipeline detection limits, for all GAMA DR2 objects. Note that this table includes all DR2 objects that are currently not covered by GALEX data (the rows for these objects are 'empty'). Including these objects here enables users to discriminate between objects that were covered by GALEX but not detected, and those that were not covered by GALEX.
        </p>
        <p>The kCorrections DMU provides k-corrections in the GALEX, SDSS and UKIDSS bands for all DR2 objects with nQ 2. The k-corrections were calculated with KCORRECT v4 2 (Blanton &amp; Roweis 2007) using SDSS DR6 model magnitudes and the local flow-corrected redshifts provided by the 
            <rs type="software">LocalFlowCorrection</rs> DMU (see Section 5.1.4 above). Note that, strictly speaking, geocentric redshifts should be used to calculate k-corrections, but here we have used the flow-corrected redshifts for consistency with calculations of the maximum distance at which a given survey object would still be included in the survey.
        </p>
        <p>We provide k-corrections to both redshift 0 (table kcorr z00) and to redshift 0.1 (table kcorr z01). These tables also include the coefficients of a polynomial fit to the k-corrections in each band, as detailed by Loveday et al. (2012).</p>
        <p>The StellarMasses DMU provides stellar masses, restframe photometry, and other ancillary stellar population parameters from stellar population fits to ugriz spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for all galaxies with 0 &lt; z &lt; 0.65 and nQ 2 from the GAMA DR2 sample. The details of the derivation of the stellar masses were described by Taylor et al. (2011), and so we only provide a brief summary here.</p>
        <p>The data provided by the StellarMasses table have been derived through stellar population synthesis (SPS) modelling of broadband optical (ugriz) photometry. The modelling is done using the Bruzual &amp; Charlot (2003) stellar evolution models, assuming a Chabrier (2003) stellar initial mass function and the Calzetti et al. (2000) dust curve. The SPS models used in the fitting are defined by four parameters: e-folding time for the (exponentially declining) star formation history, time since formation (i.e. age), stellar metallicity, and dust attenuation (see section 3.1 of Taylor et al. 2011). The SPS grid spans the range 0 &lt; z &lt; 0.65; objects with z &gt; 0.65 have not been fit.</p>
        <p>For each galaxy StellarMasses contains the values of various stellar population parameters that have been inferred from the SPS fits in a Bayesian way. These include the luminosityweighted mean age, metallicity, and total mass of the stars, as well as restframe photometry and colours. For the restframe luminosi-ties we provide both intrinsic and observed values (i.e. before and after internal dust attenuation).</p>
        <p>Note that the NIR photometry available for GAMA galaxies have not been used at this stage, for the simple reason that the models do not provide a good description of the full optical-to-NIR SED shapes (section 4 of Taylor et al. 2011).</p>
        <p>Note further that the results contained in StellarMasses were derived from the aperture-matched (i.e. SExtractor AUTO) photometry provided by the ApMatchedPhotom DMU (see Section 5.1.5 above). An aperture correction is therefore required for integrated quantities such as stellar mass or luminosity in order to account for flux/mass that falls beyond the finite AUTO aperture used for the SEDs. For this purpose we provide the quantity FLUXSCALE, which is the ratio between the rband aperture flux and the total Sérsic flux integrated to 10 effective radii (taken from the SersicPhotometry DMU, see Section 5.1.6 above). This correction has not been applied to the values in StellarMasses. This step is instead left to the user.</p>
        <p>The SpecLineSFR DMU provides emission and absorption line measurements for all GAMA DR2 AAT spectra, as well as derived physical properties, including the SFR, for all DR2 AAT spectra and for all SDSS spectra of DR2 objects.</p>
        <p>This DMU provides four catalogues. The table SpecLines provides emission and absorption line measurements for all GAMA DR2 AAT spectra with a redshift measurement, i.e. all spectra with nQ 2 listed in AATSpecAll (see Section 5.1.3 above). As described in more detail by Hopkins et al. (2013), common emission lines were fit with single Gaussians, assuming a common redshift and a common line width for adjacent line groups, while simultaneously fitting the local continuum.</p>
        <p>Table EmLinesPhysGAMA translates these raw measurements to physical properties, as detailed by Gunawardhana et al. (2013). In particular, this table provides Balmer decrements, Hα luminosities, Hα-derived SFRs, and emission line classifications for all spectra in SpecLines with any measured Hα emission and z &gt; 0.001. Note that the Hα selection effectively limits this catalogue to z 0.36. The Hα luminosities (and hence the SFRs) are corrected for stellar absorption, dust obscuration and aperture effects (Gunawardhana et al. 2013).</p>
        <p>Similarly, table EmLinesPhysSDSS provides the same quantities for all SDSS spectra of DR2 objects (see Section 5.1.1 above) with any measured Hα emission and z &gt; 0.001. The values in this table were derived from the line measurements provided by the MPA/JHU SDSS line database,foot_15 which were originally performed by Tremonti et al. (2004) andBrinchmann et al. (2004).</p>
        <p>Finally, table EmLinesPhys is this DMU's main catalogue, which we expect to cover the needs of most users. It combines tables EmLinesPhysGAMA and EmLinesPhysSDSS to provide (where available) Balmer decrements, Hα luminosities, Hαderived SFRs, and emission line classifications for all DR2 galaxies with a redshift measurement (i.e. nQ 2 and z &gt; -0.01, the same selection as that of the LocalFlowCorrection DMU).</p>
        <p>An important limitation of the current version of this DMU is the fact that it only covers the GAMA AAT and SDSS spectra. The GAMA observing campaign on the AAT did not systematically include objects that had previously already been observed by other surveys (see Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.3 above). Although the spectra from these other surveys are available in the GAMA DR2 database, no spectral line measurements for these spectra are included in this DMU. For the SDSS spectra such measurements are provided to the public by the MPA/JHU database, and we make use of these measurements in EmLinesPhysSDSS. However, the spectra from the other (non-SDSS) surveys could not be used in this DMU because they are not flux-calibrated. Hence, the selection functions of these other surveys will be imprinted on this DMU. This needs to be corrected for when using table EmLinesPhys, using e.g. the method of Gunawardhana et al. (2013).</p>
        <p>The EnvironmentMeasures DMU provides several different metrics of the local environment of GAMA DR2 galaxies: a surface density, the number of galaxies within a cylinder, and the density of galaxies within an adaptive Gaussian ellipsoid. Note that this release only covers the G15 survey region, because only in this region are we releasing redshifts down to the GAMA I survey limit of r &lt; 19.4 mag.</p>
        <p>All three environment measurements are performed on a density-defining pseudo-volume-limited population of galaxies. This population is defined as all galaxies with Mr(z ref = 0, Qe = 0.78) &lt; -20.4 mag, where Qe defines the expected evolution of the absolute Petrosian magnitude Mr as a function of redshift, and is taken from Loveday et al. (2012). Given the depth of the GAMA I survey (r &lt; 19.4 mag), the above absolute magnitude limit implies a redshift (i.e. volume) limit of z = 0.18333. However, in order to account for the upper edge of the velocity range employed when searching for nearby galaxies (see below), the environment measurements are only provided for galaxies out to z = 0.18. The exact sample included in this DMU is: all GAMA DR2 galaxies in G15 with redshift quality nQ 3 (i.e. reliable redshifts) and within the redshift limits of 0.002 &lt; z 0.18, where z is the local flow-corrected redshift provided by the 
            <rs type="software">LocalFlowCorrection</rs> DMU (see Section 5.1.4 above). All three environment measures are corrected for redshift incompleteness where necessary.
        </p>
        <p>The first environment measure provided by the table EnvironmentMeasures is the surface density Σ5 = 5 π d 2 5 (18) at the position of a given galaxy. d5 is the distance (in Mpc) in the plane of the sky from the galaxy in question to its fifth nearest neighbour among that part of the density-defining population that lies within ±1000 km s -1 of the redshift of the galaxy (Brough et al. 2013).</p>
        <p>The second measure, N cyl , is the number of (other) galaxies from the density-defining population within a cylinder centred on the galaxy in question and of co-moving radius 1 Mpc and thickness ±1000 km s -1 .</p>
        <p>Finally, the third measure is the density of galaxies from the density-defining population in an adaptive Gaussian ellipsoid defined by</p>
        <p>where ra and rz are the distances from the centre in the plane of the sky and along the line-of-sight in co-moving Mpc, respectively, and σ = 2 Mpc. The adaptive scaling factor, cz = 1+0.2 n, where n is the number of galaxies from the density-defining population within 2 Mpc, is used to scale the value of σ along the redshift axis by up to a factor of 3 for the highest density environments to compensate for the 'finger-of-God' effect (Schawinski et al. 2007;Thomas et al. 2010).</p>
        <p>The GroupFinding DMU provides the GAMA Galaxy Group Catalogue (G 3 C), which was first introduced by Robotham et al. (2011). The GAMA spectroscopic survey was specifically designed to enable group science (Robotham et al. 2010), and the G 3 C is hence one of the key data products of the survey. In the present release the G 3 C is restricted to the G15 survey region, as this is the only region for which DR2 includes data down to the GAMA I survey limit (r &lt; 19.4 mag).</p>
        <p>The G 3 C is constructed using a friends-of-friends (FoF) algorithm. The parameters of this algorithm were determined using a set of GAMA-style mock galaxy catalogues [constructed from the Millennium dark matter simulation (Springel et al. 2005) and the GALFORM semi-analytical model of galaxy formation (Bower et al. 2006)] such that the medians of the most important properties of the groups recovered by the FoF algorithm from the mock catalogues are unbiased with respect to the 'true' groups in the mocks (which are defined as groups of galaxies inhabiting the same dark matter halo).</p>
        <p>The number of groups included in this release is 4242, of which 466 have five or more members. The multiplicity, velocity dispersion and size distributions of these groups are quite similar to those derived from the mock catalogues, except that we find fewer high-multiplicity groups in the real data than in the mocks. The details of the FoF algorithm, its application to the mock catalogues and the real data, and the resulting group catalogue are described extensively by Robotham et al. (2011). 20 Here we only describe the structure of the GroupFinding DMU's data products.</p>
        <p>Table G3CGal contains the sample of galaxies on which the FoF grouping algorithm was run. This sample was selected as all main survey galaxies in the G15 survey region (r &lt; 19.4 mag) with nQ 3 and 0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.5. The purpose of the redshift limits is to avoid luminosity function and distance uncertainties at very low redshift. For those galaxies that were identified as being a member of a group the table also contains a reference to the appropriate group.</p>
        <p>Table G3CFoFGroup lists a large number of properties of the groups that were identified by running the grouping algorithm on G3CGal. These include the group's multiplicity, position, redshift, size, velocity dispersion, estimates of its total r-band luminosity and halo mass, and identification of its Brightest Group Galaxy (BGG), among others. For each group we also provide a summary plot, an example of which is shown in Fig. 33.</p>
        <p>Table G3CLink provides all of the galaxy-galaxy links found when running the FoF algorithm. This table is useful for users who wish to know which galaxies are linked the most with other galaxies within a group, or to identify the most tenuously associated galaxies within a group.</p>
        <p>Table G3CGalsInPair is a list of all galaxies that are paired with another galaxy within a projected physical separation A galaxy redshifted with respect to the group median redshift has a red upwards pointing line, the length of which scales with the velocity difference, while for a blueshifted one the line is blue and points downwards. The rings represent the 50, 68 and 100 percentiles of the radial galaxy distributions relative to the iterative group centre. The velocity probability density function smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of width 50 km s -1 (the typical GAMA velocity error) is shown on the left, where the group median is shown with a green dashed line and the BGG with a black dashed line. The bottom panel presents the absolute r-band magnitude distribution of the group, with the effective GAMA survey limit shown with a red dashed line, the group median absolute magnitude with a green line and the BGG absolute magnitude with a black line.</p>
        <p>of 50 kpc and a velocity separation of 1000 km s -1 . Note that this is a list of paired galaxies, not of galaxy pairs. The number of pairs is hence half the number of galaxies in this table.</p>
        <p>In addition to the above we also make available the equivalent tables derived from the set of mock galaxy catalogues already mentioned above. An additional table provides the properties of the 'true' groups in the mocks. Nine mock catalogues were created in all. However, each of these covers not only the G15 region as is the case for the real data, but represents a complete analogue of the full GAMA I survey, i.e. of all three survey regions. Since the three regions have the same size and shape this means that the mock catalogues provide a total of 9 × 3 = 27 comparison volumes. The tables derived from the mock catalogues contain the results from all 27 volumes.</p>
        <p>Public access to all of the data described above, as well as to the meta-data accompanying these, is provided by means of a 
            <rs type="software">MySQL</rs> database, a file server, and a set of web pages which act as an interface. These are available at http://www.gama-survey. org/dr2/.
        </p>
        <p>All of the tabular data described in Sections 5.1.2-5.1.12 were ingested into a 
            <rs type="software">MySQL</rs> database. The contents of this database are most conveniently explored using the schema browser we provide for this precise purpose. The schema browser affords an overview of the tables available for query (structured by DMUs), and provides access to all of the meta-data provided by the DMUs, including DMU descriptions, individual table descriptions, and the information describing individual columns. These meta-data are required to be complete and detailed enough to enable the use of the actual data in a scientific context.
        </p>
        <p>Having used the schema browser to identify the tables and columns that contain the data of interest, a user may submit an appropriate free-form SQL query. We provide a set of example queries for those unfamiliar with 
            <rs type="software">MySQL</rs>. Alternatively, we offer an 
            <rs type="software">SQL Query Builder</rs> which allows users to construct SQL queries largely by point and click. This is a very powerful tool that is extremely helpful when constructing complex queries across multiple tables, and we encourage DR2 users to make use of it.
        </p>
        <p>Query results may be returned in a variety of formats, including FITS binary tables. The query results page also lists the first 100 rows of the query result, and provides links to upload individual or all objects to the Single Object Viewer (see next section) or the SDSS Image List tool, or to download data files from the file server, as appropriate.</p>
        <p>Finally, we point out that a Python interface to the DR2 MySQL database is available in the 
            <rs type="software">ASTROQUERY</rs> package.foot_18
        </p>
        <p>The Single Object Viewer (SOV) provides a convenient way to access all of the data that are available in the DR2 database for a given object.</p>
        <p>The SOV can be queried with one or more CATAIDs or SPECIDs (the unique object and spectrum identifiers used by GAMA). If multiple IDs are given the SOV provides an effective way of moving along the list. For a given object (or the object that is associated with a given spectrum) the SOV displays the most important data from the InputCat and SpecCat DMUs, alongside an SDSS DR7 five-band composite image of the object, the best or requested spectrum (see Fig. 31 for an example), and the summary plots from the SersicPhotometry and GroupFinding DMUs (see Figs. 32 and 33,respectively). The SOV is thus an effective tool for visually inspecting the images, spectra, Sérsic fits and group environments even of large samples of objects.</p>
        <p>In addition to this overview, the SOV provides convenient links to query any table in the DR2 database for the object or spectrum under consideration, thus making it easy to explore individual objects in complete detail.</p>
        <p>All of the data described in Section 5.1 (i.e. the GAMA spectra, spectra from previous surveys, catalogues and accompanying metadata, mosaic images, summary plots, etc.) are made available for download on the DR2 file server. The data are organised in a directory tree structure that is intended to be self-explanatory. The file server web page provides a convenient way of browsing and accessing this directory structure. It also provides information regarding the contents of directories, data formats and file naming conventions.</p>
        <p>Catalogues are organised into sub-directories by DMU. These DMU directories contain the actual catalogue data, as well as all accompanying meta-data.</p>
        <p>Files with filename extension .notes are plain text files containing detailed descriptions, either of the DMU as a whole (DMUName.notes) or of individual tables (TableName.notes). Together these files provide a comprehensive description of the DMU and all of its data products.</p>
        <p>For convenience, all catalogues are provided in two formats: as a space-delimited ASCII file, and as a binary FITS table. The former is always accompanied by another file (with the same root filename, but with filename extension.par), which contains the basic table meta-data, including the table's creation date, contact person, short description, and the column meta-data such as column name, units, and short column description. The FITS version is in the 'FITS-plus' format 22 used by the popular table manipulation tools 
            <rs type="software">TOPCAT</rs> (Taylor 2005) and 
            <rs type="software">STILTS</rs> (Taylor 2006). This format allows us to conveniently store the table data and basic meta-data (i.e. the contents of the .par file) together in the same file.
        </p>
        <p>Note that the contents of a given DMU's .notes and .par files are identical to the information on this DMU provided by the schema browser described above.</p>
        <p>Moving on from catalogues to spectra, these are organised on the file server in sub-directories according to their originating surveys (cf. Table 5). For each spectrum we also provide a plot in PNG format equivalent to that shown in Fig. 31.</p>
        <p>The imaging part of the file server contains the large-format mosaics used by the ApMatchedPhotom and SersicPhotometry DMUs, the complete input and output data used by the SersicPhotometry DMU, the summary plots produced by the GroupFinding DMU, as well as SDSS DR7 fiveband composite postage stamps for all objects in TilingCat and SpStandards.</p>
        <p>This rather technical paper essentially consists of four parts. First, we report in Section 2 on a number of aspects concerning the implementation of the GAMA II spectroscopic survey. Specifically, in Section 2.1 we provide an overview of the changes to the input catalogue and the target selection that were implemented following the completion of the first phase of the GAMA survey. In Section 2.3 we discuss in depth the full procedure by which we measure a spectrum's redshift using the semi-automatic code 
            <rs type="software">RUNZ</rs>. We detail our motivation for developing an extensive double-checking process (re-redshifting), describe its implementation as well as the analysis of the resulting data, and discuss its overall effect. Having briefly described our new, fully automated redshift code 
            <rs type="software">AUTOZ</rs> in Section 2.4, we end this part of the paper in Section 2.8 with a summary of our observations with the Liverpool Telescope of a small number of targets that were too bright to be observed during regular survey operations at the AAT.
        </p>
        <p>We point out that this first part of the paper supplements the series of earlier technical papers describing the implementation of the GAMA spectroscopic survey (Baldry et al. 2010; Robotham 22 http://www.starlink.ac.uk/topcat/ et al. 2010; Driver et al. 2011;Hopkins et al. 2013;Baldry et al. 2014;Davies et al. 2015).</p>
        <p>Second, following its recent completion, we present the end product of the GAMA II spectroscopic survey in Section 3. We show and discuss a series of diagnostics to assess the final state of the survey and the quality of the redshift data. Our final dataset includes reliable redshifts for over 263 000 objects. In its three equatorial survey regions GAMA has achieved an exceptionally high overall redshift completeness of 98.48 per cent, while the two southern regions G02 and G23 were completed to levels of 94.95 and 94.19 per cent, respectively. Despite these high values, weak but nevertheless significant completeness trends with brightness, surface brightness and colour remain. In contrast, the spatial distribution of the redshift completeness is extremely homogeneous, both on large and small angular scales. The high redshift completeness even in densely populated regions of the sky is a particular hallmark of the GAMA survey, one that sets it apart from its predecessors. It is this feature, in combination with its faint limit of r &lt; 19.8 mag, that makes the GAMA survey a unique resource for studies that rely on accurate measurements of the properties of galaxy pairs and groups. Section 3 concludes by comparing the redshift precision and reliability of RUNZ with those of the newer AU-TOZ code. We find that the latter outperforms the former on both accounts. The average 1σ error of AUTOZ redshifts is just 27 km s -1 , and only 0.2 per cent of AUTOZ redshifts classified as reliable turn out to be incorrect.</p>
        <p>The third part of the paper is concerned with two aspects of GAMA's photometric programme. Section 4.1 provides an update on our procedures to extract aperture-matched optical and NIR photometry from processed SDSS and UKIDSS LAS imaging data, while in Section 4.2 we describe our methods to obtain FUV and NUV photometry for GAMA galaxies from the data of the GALEX-GAMA survey. This part of the paper essentially continues the series of technical papers on GAMA photometry (Hill et al. 2011;Kelvin et al. 2012;Cluver et al. 2014).</p>
        <p>Finally, in Section 5 we describe the second public release of GAMA data. In DR2 we release GAMA I spectra, redshifts and a wealth of additional information for all main survey objects with r &lt; 19.0 mag in survey regions G09 and G12, and for all objects with r &lt; 19.4 mag in region G15 (72 225 objects in total). The additional information is comprised of input catalogue and targeting information, optical and NIR (u to K) aperture-matched photometry, photometry and structural parameters from single-component Sérsic fits in the same bands, FUV and NUV photometry from GALEX, k-corrections, stellar masses, spectral line measurements and Hα-derived SFRs, three different environment measures (only for G15), and the GAMA Galaxy Group Catalogue (G 3 C, again for G15 only). Together these data represent a valuable resource for studies of the low-redshift galaxy population.</p>
        <p>In future data releases we will extend the publicly available spectra and redshifts both to fainter limiting magnitudes and to the southern survey regions G02 and G23. We will also release additional data products not yet included in DR2, including the AUTOZ redshifts, mid and far-infrared photometry, photometry and bulgedisk decompositions derived from KiDS and VIKING data, morphologies, and additional environmental measures. In due course, all GAMA data and data products will be made publicly available.</p>
        <p>We conclude by encouraging interested readers to contact the GAMA team if they already would like to use GAMA data that are currently still proprietary. We actively support (and engage with) collaboration projects, as long as there are no conflicts with already c 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1-40 GAMA: end of survey report and DR2 39 existing projects. Details of the different collaboration possibilities are available at the GAMA website.</p>

The green lines show the same as the blue ones, but now restricting both samples to those spectra that have been re-redshifted, i.e. that have Nop &gt; 1.</p>

        <p>RAS, MNRAS 000, 1-40</p>
        <p>c 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1-40</p>
        <p>For the first re-redshifting campaign we used a much simpler scheme: we simply ensured that a spectrum initially redshifted by an experienced redshifter was not assigned to an inexperienced redshifter.</p>
        <p>In the following we will refer to the combination of z and Q found by a (re-)redshifter for a given spectrum as that redshifter's 'opinion' of that spectrum. The range of possible opinions explicitly includes Q = 1, i.e. that no redshift can be found in this spectrum (in which case the value of z is of course meaningless). Note that every spectrum has at least one opinion associated with it (from the initial redshifting). c 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1-40</p>
        <p>Note that this measure would be related to, but would not be synonymous with easily quantifiable measures of 'data quality'. For example, even a spectrum with low continuum signal-to-noise ratio may still yield a secure redshift if multiple strong emission lines are present. c 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1-40</p>
        <p>For spectra with Nop = 1 this step is obviously trivial, but the procedure nevertheless holds. c 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1-40</p>
        <p>The only caveat to this statement is the fact that the p(i, Q) values of nine of the initial redshifters have not yet been measured, as mentioned in the previous section.</p>
        <p>The relatively small number of Q = 4 initial redshifts in this sample is of course due to the way in which we selected spectra for re-redshifting (see Section 2.3.2.1). c 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1-40</p>
        <p>The striking gap in this distribution at 0.225 z 0.25 raises the question whether some property of our spectra or of the redshifting process systematically prevents us from successfully identifying redshifts in this range. This is not the case, since the gap is only evident in the equatorial survey regions (the data from which dominate this distribution), but not in G02 or G23.</p>
        <p>http://classic.sdss.org/dr5/algorithms/spectemplates/</p>
        <p>These numbers are based on the AUTOZ redshifts. The equivalent numbers using the RUNZ redshifts are somewhat lower: 82.8 per cent for the redshift success of the initial observation, 90.2 per cent for the final fraction of main survey targets with a robust redshift (both including re-redshifting). Note that AUTOZ only became available in 2013. Until then, the decision on whether to re-observe a given object was obviously based on the RUNZ results. c 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1-40</p>
        <p>Note that we disregard the second order possibilities of both redshifts being incorrect and of both being correct. The latter may occur in cases where the target consists of two unresolved objects at different redshifts, and where the spectra were obtained at slightly different positions on the sky, resulting in different objects dominating the flux in the two spectra.</p>
        <p>This would best be done by comparing a measure of the significance of a redshift to those of other possible redshifts in the same spectrum. Indeed, this is the figure of merit used by AUTOZ, see(Baldry et al. 2014). However, such information is not available in the RUNZ data. c 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1-40</p>
        <p>Note that this is not necessarily the same as the highest S/N spectrum. c 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1-40</p>
