        <p>The past decades have witnessed an explosion of interest in topological materials, and a lot of mathematical concepts have been introduced in condensed matter physics. Among them, the bulk-boundary correspondence is the central topic in topological physics, which has inspired researchers to focus on boundary physics. Recently, the concepts of topological phases have been extended to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, whose eigenvalues can be complex. Besides the topology, non-Hermiticity can also cause a boundary phenomenon called the non-Hermitian skin effect, which is an extreme sensitivity of the spectrum to the boundary condition. In this article, we review developments in non-Hermitian topological physics by focusing mainly on the boundary problem. As well as the competition between non-Hermitian and topological boundary phenomena, we discuss the topological nature inherent in non-Hermiticity itself.The past decades have witnessed an explosion of interest in topological materials, and a lot of mathematical concepts have been introduced in condensed matter physics.

        <p>Recently, the topological properties of lattice systems have attracted broad interest in condensed matter physics. One of the major concepts in topological physics is the bulk-boundary correspondence in topological phases (1,2), which states that the topological invariant constructed from the bulk states counts the number of robust gapless boundary states (3).

        <p>In this article, we review the topological physics in non-Hermitian lattice systems by focusing mainly on the boundary phenomena. The concept of topological phases was generalized to non-Hermitian systems in References 11-15. In particular, Reference 13 provided bulk topological numbers in various non-Hermitian systems and showed the validity of the bulk-boundary correspondence in the presence of a class of symmetries. However, it was pointed out later that a general non-Hermitian system without such symmetries may exhibit other boundary phenomena specific to non-Hermitian systems (16,17), called non-Hermitian skin effects (16). The new effects localize bulk modes on boundaries and obscure the bulk-boundary correspondence. We first review the competition between the bulk-boundary correspondence and the non-Hermitian skin effects, but our focus is not merely on the competition between the two different phenomena. Remarkably, the latter non-Hermitian boundary physics is also closely related to topological physics. In the main part of this review, we introduce the mathematics of non-Hermitian matrices and discuss recent developments in the field of non-Hermitian phenomena whose origin is non-Hermitian topology.In this article, we review the topological physics in non-Hermitian lattice systems by focusing mainly on the boundary phenomena.

For example, there is only one eigenvector for Equation 1 with t = g because of the nondiagonalizability.

In conventional band theory, the bulk spectrum, or the energy dispersion, is given as a function of crystal momentum k [or the exponential factor of a Bloch wave function e ik , i.e., E(e ik )]. However, the non-Bloch band theory provides the OBC bulk spectrum as an analytic continuation E(e ik ) → E(β), where β is a complex parameter on a closed curve in the complex plane, called the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). In the absence of the non-Hermitian skin effect, the GBZ reproduces the unit circle of the Brillouin zone (BZ), whereas in the case of the Hatano-Nelson model, it is given by a circle with radius r -1 . In general, the GBZ can be a complicated curve (Figure 1c) and is determined with the help of numerical calculations, as discussed in References 24 4 and 26.In the first half of this article, we focus on conventional skin effects with O(L) skin modes, 3 which are found in one-dimensional systems with discrete translation invariance (except for the ends).

        <p>The non-Hermitian skin effect obscures the bulk-boundary correspondence (16,17,23,(28)(29)(30). More precisely, even when the PBC spectrum is gapless, and thus one cannot define the bulk topological invariant in the PBC, the bulk OBC spectrum can be gapped due to the skin effect. As a result, the topological phase diagram under the OBC is generally different from that under the PBC. In Figure 1d, the OBC spectrum of a non-Hermitian extension of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model (31) with asymmetric hopping (28) is plotted as a function of a model parameter (16).

        <p>At first sight, this phenomenon suggests a breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence. However, even in such a case, one can recover the bulk-boundary correspondence once one introduces a proper topological invariant via the OBC bulk spectral information. For example, the topological invariant for the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model is given by a winding number defined in terms of the GBZ (16) in the OBC, instead of the conventional BZ in the PBC. To treat more generic cases including higher-dimensional systems and disordered ones, Reference 32 proposed to use real-space topological invariants in the OBC, which enables us to characterize the bulk-boundary correspondence in terms of the explicit right and left eigenstates of the OBC Hamiltonian. These studies indicate that the bulk-boundary correspondence should be defined for the bulk and boundary modes under the common boundary condition. In the absence of the non-Hermitian skin effect, however, the topological invariant under the OBC coincides with that under the PBC. In this sense, the success of predictions by the PBC information in Hermitian topological physics is due to not only the bulk-boundary correspondence but also the boundary insensitivity, which is a special property of the systems without skin modes. Such a conventional bulk-boundary correspondence also holds in non-Hermitian systems without skin effects. Actually, when a class of symmetries may prohibit the skin effects (33), the topological invariant under the PBC succeeds in the prediction of the boundary modes in the OBC (13). One can also obtain the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence for the bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian (34)(35)(36)(37)(38), whose energy spectrum is given by the eigenspectrum of a non-Hermitian matrix with pseudo-Hermiticity and particle-hole symmetry (33,39). 5 It should be noted here that one needs to generalize the topological invariants properly so as to be consistent with non-Hermiticity (13,15,38,41) even without the skin effects.At first sight, this phenomenon suggests a breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence.

        <p>As we mentioned, the OBC spectrum is given by a function of β on the GBZ determined by the non-Bloch band theory. Unfortunately, the shape of the GBZ is not a simple function of the model parameter in general, and the spectral behavior is unclear without the help of numerical calculations. Nevertheless, the presence or absence of the non-Hermitian skin effect is easily determined by the non-Hermitian topology, i.e., the winding number W ∈ Z of the PBC spectral curve in the complex plane.

        <p>We here describe a strategy for the proof. Because there is no simple formula for calculating the OBC spectrum, it is difficult to compare the OBC spectrum to the PBC one directly. Thus, the proof of this theorem is divided into two parts: (a) the comparison between the PBC and the semi-infinite boundary condition (SIBC), and (b) that between the SIBC and the OBC. Here, "semi-infinite" means that there is only one boundary in the one-dimensional lattice. In step (a), we use the index theorem of spectral theory (4,47) to relate the SIBC spectrum with the PBC one. According to the index theorem, the SIBC spectrum is given by a PBC curve together with all the points enclosed by the PBC curve with a nonzero winding number7 (Figure 2a).

Once we admit this inclusion, we obtain another inclusion by applying the imaginary gauge transformation (Equation 3), which is a kind of similarity transformation, to the Hamiltonian. The crucial point is that a similarity transformation changes the SIBC spectrum due to the infinite-dimensional nature of the matrix8 (Figure 2a), though it does not change the OBC spectrum defined by the infinite-volume limit of the spectrum of a finite-dimensional matrix. Thus, the original OBC spectrum is included in the transformed SIBC spectrum.

        <p>The above consideration also clarifies how the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence breaks in the presence of the non-Hermitian skin effect. To see this, let us consider a non-Hermitian lattice system with the bulk band spectrum forming spectral islands in the complex energy plane. When the spectral islands are separated from each other, we say that the system has line gaps (33; see Section 5), and each island may support a topological number (13,15,33,48).

        <p>In the presence of the non-Hermitian skin effect, the spectral islands in the OBC are different from those in the PBC. Therefore, the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence, which relates a topological number in the PBC to a boundary state, does not always hold. However, the breakdown has limitations. By the argument in the previous section, the bulk OBC spectrum is always inside the PBC one, and thus each bulk spectral island in the OBC is also inside a spectral island in the PBC. Thus, if the system has a line gap in the PBC, it also has a line gap in the OBC. Because spectral islands in the PBC can be smoothly deformed into those in the OBC without closing line gaps, this means that the topological numbers of the spectral islands coincide between the PBC and the OBC under the same situation. Therefore, once one has a well-defined topological number in the PBC, which is always true in the situation above, the corresponding topological number in the OBC takes the same value, and thus the conventional bulk boundary correspondence holds. Note that the PBC islands should merge before the gap closing (namely, a collision of spectral islands) in the OBC, and thus the topological number in the PBC becomes ill-defined near a topological phase transition in the OBC.

        <p>We here give several remarks about the symmetry-protected skin effects. First, the symmetryprotected nature appears as an instability of the skin effect against symmetry-breaking perturbations (δh ̸ = 0 in Figure 3). In the infinite-volume limit, this instability is understood by the failure of the standard non-Bloch band theory under some symmetry protection (64). In the presence of the symmetry that block-diagonalizes H(k) such as Equation 21, the corresponding OBC spectrum is determined not by the non-Bloch band theory for the total Hamiltonian but by that for each block. Under symmetry-breaking terms that connect the blocks, however, the OBC spectrum is determined by the non-Bloch band theory for the total Hamiltonian. Remarkably, the latter spectrum for an infinitesimally small perturbation can be different from the former spectrum. For example, the OBC spectrum of Equation 21 under an infinitesimally small transverse magnetic field becomes identical to that of the PBC (64). In the case of the transpose-type TRS without spin-rotational symmetry, a similar discussion can be applied by introducing a modified non-Bloch band theory with a Kramers doublet (27). In the language of a doubled Hermitian Hamiltonian, this phenomenon is understood by the fact that the exact zero modes acquire the finite gap under a symmetry-breaking term, which destroys the correspondence between the skin modes and the exact zero modes mentioned above. 14Second, the Z 2 nature is checked by a stack of two copies of the system with the skin effect whose topological number is unity. The skin effect in such a stack is fragile even against symmetrypreserving terms (ν = 0 in Figure 3). This behavior can be understood by the fact that a skin mode of one Kramers doublet localized at the left side can be mixed with a skin mode of the other doublet localized at the right side.We here give several remarks about the symmetry-protected skin effects.

In the language of a doubled Hermitian Hamiltonian, this phenomenon is understood by the fact that the exact zero modes acquire the finite gap under a symmetry-breaking term, which destroys the correspondence between the skin modes and the exact zero modes mentioned above. 14Second, the Z 2 nature is checked by a stack of two copies of the system with the skin effect whose topological number is unity. The skin effect in such a stack is fragile even against symmetrypreserving terms (ν = 0 in Figure 3). This behavior can be understood by the fact that a skin mode of one Kramers doublet localized at the left side can be mixed with a skin mode of the other doublet localized at the right side.</p>

        <p>In Hermitian physics, a standard classification of noninteracting topological insulators/ superconductors is given by the K-theoretical classification of a momentum-resolved Hamiltonian matrix H (k) (69)(70)(71)(72), where k is a momentum on a sphere or a torus.

        <p>Non-Hermitian skin effects are experimentally relevant in classical systems (109)(110)(111)(112). Although the implementation of asymmetric hopping is not easy in quantum systems, this does not forbid the quantum implementation because non-Hermitian skin effects only require the spectral topology. Namely, on-site dissipation can also induce non-Hermitian skin effects, as emphasized in Reference 113. In fact, the non-Hermitian skin effect in the discrete-time nonunitary quantum walk was experimentally realized by mode-selective loss (114). For an intuitive understanding, let us consider a one-dimensional two-band Hermitian Hamiltonian H (k) = d(k) • σ, where d ∈ R 3 , and σ values are the Pauli matrices that represent "spin" degrees of freedom. The dispersion is given by E ± (k) = ±|d(k)|, and the spin direction of each eigenstate is parallel/antiparallel to d(k). Under momentum-independent spin-dependent non-Hermiticity, each band effectively feels momentum-dependent dissipation (76). For d(k) that realizes the PBC curve with a nontrivial winding number, one can realize the conventional skin effect by the combination of the spinmomentum locked band structure and the on-site non-Hermiticity (Figure 5a). This construction is analogous to an implementation of a topological superconductor in which the p-wave pairing is effectively realized by the combination of the spin-momentum-locked band structure and the s-wave pairing (115)(116)(117)(118). One can also use the combination of topological boundary states and boundary-dependent dissipation as a source of non-Hermitian skin effects (76). For example, let us consider a thin film of a three-dimensional topological insulator. The low-energy effective model of this system is given by two two-dimensional Dirac cones with opposite chiralities at the top and the bottom surfaces.

        <p>Before closing, we relate the spectral topology of non-Hermitian tight-binding models to non-Hermitian dynamics. Let us consider the non-Hermitian Schrödinger equation with a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian H: where |ψ(t)⟩ is a wave function whose norm depends on time. In open quantum systems, this equation describes various situations, such as the Lindblad equation ( 134) written in a quadratic form of field operators (135,136) and the continuous Lindblad dynamics without quantum jumps (137). In classical systems, this equation has been investigated in various fields, including fluid mechanics (4) and network science (138). If H is a normal matrix ([H, H † ] = 0), the dynamics of the norm is always governed by the imaginary part of the spectrum. If not ([H, H † ] ̸ = 0), however, the relaxation dynamics is more nontrivial. Remarkably, the right eigenstates of a nonnormal matrix do not span the whole Hilbert space. If the initial state is in or close to the subspace spanned by the right eigenstates, the nonnormal dynamics is not different from the normal dynamics. For more general initial states, however, there is a transient time (0 &lt; t &lt; ∞) for the state to have a large overlap with that subspace, and the transient dynamics is governed by the pseudospectrum discussed in Section 3.4, instead of the spectrum. In the long-time limit (t → ∞), nonnormal dynamics is governed by the spectrum, as in the case of a normal matrix. Due to the pseudospectral nature, amplification in transient time is allowed even if the largest imaginary part of the spectrum is negative. Physically, the transient time depends on the speed of propagating information, or the Lieb-Robinson bounds (44). In a one-dimensional system with the non-Hermitian skin effect, the transient time is given by the time for the information to propagate from one end to the other end, which is proportional to the system size (44). The corresponding quasi-eigenvalue is in the ϵ-pseudospectrum with ϵ that is exponentially small with respect to the system size (44). In the correspondence between non-Hermitian and Hermitian topology, the pseudospectrum under the non-Hermitian skin effect is related to the quasi-zero modes of a topological insulator (52), as emphasized in Section 3.4. In this sense, the transient dynamics under the non-Hermitian skin effect is related to the quasi-zero modes of a Hermitian topological insulator. For general nonnormal matrices, the transient time can be roughly estimated by the nonnormal energy-time uncertainty relation defined for a pseudospectrum (139).Before closing, we relate the spectral topology of non-Hermitian tight-binding models to non-Hermitian dynamics. Let us consider the non-Hermitian Schrödinger equation with a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian H: where |ψ(t)⟩ is a wave function whose norm depends on time. In open quantum systems, this equation describes various situations, such as the Lindblad equation ( 134) written in a quadratic form of field operators (135,136) and the continuous Lindblad dynamics without quantum jumps (137). In classical systems, this equation has been investigated in various fields, including fluid mechanics (4) and network science (138). If H is a normal matrix ([H, H † ] = 0), the dynamics of the norm is always governed by the imaginary part of the spectrum. If not ([H, H † ] ̸ = 0), however, the relaxation dynamics is more nontrivial. Remarkably, the right eigenstates of a nonnormal matrix do not span the whole Hilbert space. If the initial state is in or close to the subspace spanned by the right eigenstates, the nonnormal dynamics is not different from the normal dynamics. For more general initial states, however, there is a transient time (0 &lt; t &lt; ∞) for the state to have a large overlap with that subspace, and the transient dynamics is governed by the pseudospectrum discussed in Section 3.4, instead of the spectrum. In the long-time limit (t → ∞), nonnormal dynamics is governed by the spectrum, as in the case of a normal matrix. Due to the pseudospectral nature, amplification in transient time is allowed even if the largest imaginary part of the spectrum is negative.

        <p>Which is physically more important, the spectrum or the pseudospectrum? The answer depends on the situation. If one is interested in the stability/instability under linear fluctuations, the stability/instability is judged by the negativity/positivity of the largest imaginary part of the spectrum. If nonlinearity is not negligible, however, the combination of transient amplification and nonlinearity can lead to instability even if the largest imaginary part of the spectrum is negative (4). In addition to classical systems (4,138), the mathematics of stability/instability is relevant in quantum systems described by the bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation (140)(141)(142)(143)(144). In addition to the stability analysis, the relaxation process to the nonequilibrium steady state in the Lindblad equation is related to nonnormality. Several studies pointed out that the relaxation time is not always described by the spectral gap (52,145,146). In our view, the origin of the mismatch is nothing but the pseudospectral nature of nonnormal matrices.Which is physically more important, the spectrum or the pseudospectrum?

        <p>Although the above discussion is limited to the Schrödinger dynamics, we note that non-Hermitian spectral phenomena can appear in more generic situations. For example, Reference 120 detected the skin corner modes with a small imaginary part in electric circuits in which the relevant eigenvalues are not given by the largest imaginary part but by the smallest absolute value. We hope that this review inspires readers to consider applications of non-Hermitian matrices to condensed matter physics.Although the above discussion is limited to the Schrödinger dynamics, we note that non-Hermitian spectral phenomena can appear in more generic situations.
