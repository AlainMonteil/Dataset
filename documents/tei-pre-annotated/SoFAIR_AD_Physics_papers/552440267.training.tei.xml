        <p>We introduce the The Three Hundred project, an endeavour to model 324 large galaxy clusters with full-physics hydrodynamical re-simulations. Here we present the dataset and study the differences to observations for fundamental galaxy cluster properties and scaling relations. We find that the modelled galaxy clusters are generally in reasonable agreement with observations with respect to baryonic fractions and gas scaling relations at redshift z = 0. However, there are still some (modeldependent) differences, such as central galaxies being too massive, and galaxy colours (gr) being bluer (about 0.2 dex lower at the peak position) than in observations. The agreement in gas scaling relations down to 10 13 h -1 M between the simulations indicates that particulars of the sub-grid modelling of the baryonic physics only has a weak influence on these relations. We also includewhere appropriate -a comparison to three semi-analytical galaxy formation models as applied to the same underlying dark matter only simulation. All simulations and derived data products are publicly available.We introduce the The Three Hundred project, an endeavour to model 324 large galaxy clusters with full-physics hydrodynamical re-simulations.

        <p>Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound objects in the Universe and as such they provide a host environment for testing both cosmology models and theories of galaxy evolution. Their formation depends both on the underlying cosmological framework and the details of the baryonic physics that is responsible for powerful feedback processes. Amongst others, these mechanisms regulate the observed properties of the Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM), the size of the central brightest cluster galaxy and the number and properties of the satellite galaxies orbiting within a common dark matter envelope. Clusters of galaxies can therefore be considered to be large cosmological laboratories that are useful for pinning down both cosmological parameters and empirical models of astrophysical processes acting across a range of coupled scales.Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound objects in the Universe and as such they provide a host environment for testing both cosmology models and theories of galaxy evolution.

        <p>Concerted effort, from both observational and theoretical perspectives, has been devoted to improve our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters. On the observational side, multi-wavelength telescopes are designed to observe different properties of galaxy clusters: radio and far infrared data provide information on the cold gas; optical data focusses attention on the stellar properties and provides input to gravitational lensing analyses which target the dark-matter (DM) component; millimetre and X-ray observations target the ICM. In parallel with these observational programmes, hydrodynamical simulations of the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters have been a very powerful tool to interpret and guide observations for more than 20 years (Evrard et al. 1996;Bryan &amp; Norman 1998). However, these extremely large objects with masses M ≥ 10 15 h -1 M are very rare and can only be found in large volumes V (100 h -1 Mpc) 3 . But modelling such volumes with all the relevant dark matter and baryonic physics, while obtaining sufficient mass and spatial resolution at the same time, is challenging. Therefore, the most commonly used approach is to perform so-called 'zoom' simulations, i.e. selecting an object of interest from a parent dark matter simulation and only adding baryonic physics (at a much higher resolution) in a region about that object. This strategy has led to valuable results, but in order to be of statistical significance one would need to run hundreds -if not thousandsof such zoom simulations, which is what workers in the field are striving for at the moment.Concerted effort, from both observational and theoretical perspectives, has been devoted to improve our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters.

        <p>Recent years have seen great advances in the direction of generating substantial samples of highly resolved galaxy cluster simulations that include all the relevant baryonic processes, e.g. the 500 'MUSIC' clusters (Sembolini et al. 2013), the sample of 29 clusters of Planelles et al. (2013), the 10 'Rhapsody-G' clusters (Wu et al. 2015), the 390 'MAC-SIS' clusters (Barnes et al. 2017a), the 30 'Cluster-EAGLE' (Barnes et al. 2017b) and 24 related 'Hydrangea' clusters (Bahé et al. 2017). The mass resolution of these zoom simulations varies from sample to sample covering the range of dark matter particle masses m DM = 9.7 × 10 6 h -1 M for 'Hydrangea' and 'Cluster-EAGLE' up to 4.4 × 10 9 h -1 M for the large 'MACSIS' sample. There are additionally cluster samples extracted from full box simulations, e.g. 'cosmo-OWLS' (Le Brun et al. 2014) and its follow-up 'BAHAMAS' (McCarthy et al. 2017) featuring hundreds of galaxy clusters, but the majority with masses lower than 10 14.5 h -1 M and at a mass resolution of m DM ∼ 4 × 10 9 h -1 M .Recent years have seen great advances in the direction of generating substantial samples of highly resolved galaxy cluster simulations that include all the relevant baryonic processes, e.g. the 500 'MUSIC' clusters (Sembolini et al. 2013), the sample of 29 clusters of Planelles et al.

        <p>In a series of precursor papers (i.e. the 'nIFTy cluster comparison project' introduced in Sembolini et al. 2016a,b) we investigated the differences in cluster properties arising from simulating one individual galaxy cluster with a variety of different numerical techniques including standard SPH, modern 1 SPH, and (moving) mesh codes. The results obtained there led us to the choice of using the modern SPH code 
            <rs type="software">GADGET-X</rs> which includes an improved SPH scheme and the implementation of black hole (BH) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback compared to our fiducial

        <p>The primary goal of this paper is to introduce The Three Hundred project and its associated data set2 that maximizes the ratio between number of objects and mass resolution: 324 regions of radius 15 h -1 Mpc -having a clus-ter with mass M 200 &gt; 6.42 × 10 14 h -1 M at its centrehave been modelled with a combined mass resolution of m DM + m gas = 1.5 × 10 9 h -1 M . This is, in fact, the same resolution as used for our previous 'MUSIC' clusters, but the difference here lies in an improved modelling of subgrid physics and an application of a modern numerical Smooth-Particle-Hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme. We detail the hydro-simulations, and the procedures for producing the cluster catalogue. We also present generic results, such as the dynamical state, baryon fraction, and optical/gas scaling relations. In addition, we add to the plots -where possiblethe results from three semi-analytical galaxy formation models Galacticus, SAG, and SAGE, noting that they have been applied to the same dark-matter-only simulation that formed the basis for the selection of the clusters presented here (see Knebe et al. 2018, for the public release of the corresponding catalogues). Although this is not the first time that a joint analysis of hydrodynamical simulations with SAMs has been performed (for example, Saro et al. 2010;Cui et al. 2011;Monaco et al. 2014;Guo et al. 2016), it is, to our knowledge, the first time such an approach has been applied to a large number of galaxy clusters. Detailed comparisons between the models and further investigation into different aspects of the cluster properties will be addressed in following companion papers.The primary goal of this paper is to introduce The Three Hundred project and its associated data set2 that maximizes the ratio between number of objects and mass resolution: 324 regions of radius 15 h -1 Mpc -having a clus-ter with mass M 200 &gt; 6.42 × 10 14 h -1 M at its centrehave been modelled with a combined mass resolution of m DM + m gas = 1.5 × 10 9 h -1 M .

        <p>The basis of our dataset has been formed by extracting 324 spherical regions centred on each of the most massive clusters identified at z = 0 by the Rockstar 3 halo finder (Behroozi et al. 2013) within the dark-matter-only MDPL2, 
            <rs type="software">MultiDark</rs> simulation (Klypin et al. 2016). 4 The MDPL2 simulation utilises the cosmological parameters shown in Table 1 which are those of the Planck mission (Planck Collaboration et al. 2016). The MDPL2 is a periodic cube of comoving length 1 h -1 Gpc containing 3840 3 dark matter particles, each of mass 1.5 × 10 9 h -1 M .

        <p>The 324 clusters at the centre of each re-simulation region were selected initially as those with the largest halo virial mass 5 at z = 0 with M vir 8 × 10 14 h -1 M .

        <p>Our mass resolution is a factor of three better than that used for the 390 'MACSIS' clusters (Barnes et al. 2017a). We further highlight that our re-simulation regions have the same mass resolution as the original dark matter only simulation upon which the SAMs are based. The dark matter particles outside this region are successively degraded in multiple layers (with a shell thickness of ∼ 4 h -1 Mpc) with lower mass resolution particles (increased by 8 times for each layer) that eventually provide the same tidal fields yet at a much lower computational costs than in the original simulation7 . The size of the re-simulated region is much larger than the virial radius of the cluster it surrounds. As such, each region also contains many additional groups and filamentary structure which may or may not be physically associated with the cluster they surround.Our mass resolution is a factor of three better than that used for the 390 'MACSIS' clusters (Barnes et al. 2017a).

        <p>The initial conditions -also publicly available -were run with the 'modern' SPH code Gadget-X and snapshots of the simulations stored for a set of pre-selected redshifts. A total of 128 different snapshots have been stored for each simulation from redshift z = 17 to 0. We also ran the same simulations with our fiducial Gadget-MUSIC code (Sembolini et al. 2013). Both codes are based on the gravity solver of the 
            <rs type="software">GADGET</rs>
            <rs type="version">3</rs> Tree-PM code (an updated version of the 
            <rs type="software">GADGET</rs>
            <rs type="version">2</rs> code; Springel 2005). While both use smooth-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to follow the evolution of the gas component, they apply different SPH techniques as well as rather distinct models for the sub-resolution physics. Gadget-X includes an improved SPH scheme (Beck et al. 2016) with artificial thermal diffusion, time-dependent artificial viscosity, high-order Wendland C4 interpolating kernel and wake-up scheme. These improvements advance the SPH capability of following gasdynamical instabilities and mixing processes by better de-scribing the discontinuities and reducing the clumpiness instability of gas. They also minimize the viscosity away from shock regions and especially in rotating shears. Gadget-MUSIC uses the classic entropy-conserving SPH formulation with a 40 neighbour M3 interpolation kernel. The differences in baryon treatment have been summarized in Table 2. For more details and the implications of the code differences we refer the reader to our comparison papers (Sembolini et al. 2016a,b).

        <p>All data was then analysed with a standardized pipeline that includes the AHF8 (Knollmann &amp; Knebe 2009) halo finder which self-consistently includes both gas and stars in the halo finding process. For each halo, we compute the radius R 200 , that is the radius r at which the density M (&lt; r)/(4πr 3 /3) drops below 200ρ crit9 . Here ρ crit is the critical density of the Universe at the respective redshift. Subhaloes are defined as haloes which lie within the R 200 region of a more massive halo, the so-called host halo. As subhaloes are embedded within the density of their respective host halo, their own density profile usually shows a characteristic upturn at a radius R t &lt; ∼ R 200 , where R 200 would be their actual radius if they were found in isolation. We use this "truncation radius" R t as the outer edge of the subhalo and hence subhalo properties (i.e. mass, density profile, velocity dispersion, rotation curve) are calculated using the gravitationally bound particles inside the truncation radius R t . For a host halo which contains the mass of their subhaloes, we calculate properties using the radius R 200 . Halo merger trees, that link objects between different redshifts, were constructed using 
            <rs type="software">MergerTree</rs> which forms part of the AHF package. We have calculated luminosities in different spectral bands from the stars within the haloes by applying the stellar population synthesis code 
            <rs type="software">STARDUST</rs> (see Devriendt et al. 1999, and references therein for more details). This code computes the spectral energy distribution from far-UV to radio, for an instantaneous starburst of a given mass, age and metallicity. The stellar contribution to the total flux is calculated assuming a Kennicutt initial mass function (Kennicutt 1998).

        <p>The full dataset consists of 324 re-simulated regions, which cover a much larger volume (out to 15 h -1 Mpc in radius) than the central halo's virial radius and hence our sample includes many other objects outside that sphere. These objects are composed of haloes, groups and filaments, which allow us to investigate the preprocessing of the galaxy cluster as well as its large-scale environment. As some of the objects close to the boundary could be contaminated by low resolution particles in the hydrodynamic simulations, we explicitly checked that all the objects included in the comprehensive catalogue do not contain any low resolution particles. In what follows we refer to this dataset, which consists of all the uncontaminated haloes from all the simulations as the 'comprehensive' sample (see Appendix A for details).The full dataset consists of 324 re-simulated regions, which cover a much larger volume (out to 15 h -1 Mpc in radius) than the central halo's virial radius and hence our sample includes many other objects outside that sphere.

        <p>Before quantifying the differences in various cluster properties, we first illustrate in Fig. 1 the distributions of simulated galaxies and dark matter within a cluster (r ≤ R 200 ) from one of our re-simulated regions, from both hydrodynamical simulations (upper row) and from SAMs (lower row). Each galaxy is represented by a sphere with size proportional to stellar mass that includes halo stars for the two hydrodynamical simulation, but only uses the stellar mass of the central galaxy for the SAMs. Their colours are based on their SDSS r, g, and u band luminosities.

        <p>It is apparent that the galaxies marked in the different panels are neither exactly in the same position nor do they have the same size for the hydrodynamical simulations. This is not surprising given that the dynamics within the virialised region is non-linear and so small differences in orbit become rapidly amplified. That said, the underlying dark matter density field is visually similar with a large infalling group to the south-east. Both R 200 and R 500 are recovered well by the resimulation. The galaxies also differ due to the varying treatment of baryonic processes, as seen in e.g. Sembolini et al. (2016a,b); Elahi et al. (2016); Cui et al. (2016b); Arthur et al. (2017). Note that the galaxy positions are identical for the two SAMs as they reflect the positions of the dark matter haloes in the underlying dark-matter-only simulation which are the same. The apparent larger sizes for the hydrodynamical galaxies can be related back to the inclusion of halo stars. In agreement with previous studies (for example Ragone-Figueroa et al. 2013;Cui et al. 2014aCui et al. , 2016b)), the galaxy stellar masses are significantly larger for Gadget-MUSIC, which does not include a model for AGN feedback.It is apparent that the galaxies marked in the different panels are neither exactly in the same position nor do they have the same size for the hydrodynamical simulations.

        <p>In order to compare individual clusters between the original MDPL2 simulation and the 324 re-simulated regions the haloes need to be matched. There is generally a direct 1-to-1 alignment between the largest object within the original simulation and the re-simulated region, as illustrated in Fig. 1. For the analysis presented here both the original MDPL2 region and the resimulated region have been (re)processed using AHF. This ensures exact consistency between the halo Table 3. Salient differences between the three SAMs. We only list here whether or not the model has been re-calibrated to the MDPL2 simulation, how it treats orphan galaxies (i.e. galaxies devoid of a dark matter halo), whether it features intra-cluster stars, and how luminosities are available. There are certainly many more differences in the exact implementation of the baryonic physics, but we refer the reader to the model presentation for those details.In order to compare individual clusters between the original MDPL2 simulation and the 324 re-simulated regions the haloes need to be matched.

        <p>re-calibration orphan galaxies intra-cluster stars luminosities finder definitions, i.e. it avoids effects introduced by using results from different halo finders (Knebe et al. 2011(Knebe et al. , 2013)). Further, AHF can extract haloes self-consistently from simulations including gas and stars as well as dark matter. We use the halo centre position as the primary criteria for matching the clusters and select the one with the nearest mass when there are multiple matches. As previously mentioned the exact halo positions will have moved slightly from those in the original dark-matter only simulation but these changes are generally small (at the level of a few percent of the virial radius in most cases, Cui et al. 2016b). Occasionally the differences are larger, typically due to the presence of an ongoing merger. It has been shown that halo finders struggle to uniquely track the main halo through a merger and rather treat the two participating objects as a host-subhalo system (Behroozi et al. 2015). Furthermore, the cluster centre can flip between different density peaks (subhaloes) due to baryonic processes (Cui et al. 2016a). That said, in our worst-case scenario, we have two matched haloes with ∼ 40 per cent mass difference caused by a massive merging subhalo. In general cases, these different kinds of mismatching only happen for the dynamically un-relaxed clusters, not for the relaxed ones. Accurate estimates of cluster masses are very important for constraining cosmological parameters and cosmological models (for example, Bocquet et al. 2016;Sartoris et al. 2016). Therefore, we present here a quantitative comparison of the halo masses as found in the hydrodynamical simulations with their respective counterparts from the darkmatter-only MDPL2 simulation (see Cui &amp; Zhang 2017, for a review of the baryon effect). Fig. 2 shows the mass ratio of clusters in Gadget-MUSIC (red circle and lines) and Gadget-X (blue star and lines) to their MDPL2 counterparts; M 200 is shown in the left-hand side panel and M 500 in the right-hand side panel.11 In order to reduce any issues due to mismatching, we select a sample of dynamically relaxed clusters (see below for details) from the complete sample and repeat the comparison. The mass ratio for M 200 from both hydrodynamical simulations is very close to unity (with the median difference lying basically within 1 per cent), with a scatter less than ∼ 5 per cent (∼ 2.5 per cent for the relaxed sub-sample). At the low mass end, Gadget-X (for both samples) tends to have about 1 per cent higher mass than its MDPL2 counterpart. However, the M 500 mass in both sets of hydrodynamical simulations tends to be several (up to 6) per cent higher than its dark-matter only counterpart below Table 4. The fraction of relaxed clusters. The first column shows the mass range. The second to fourth columns show the relaxation fractions from; all three methods combined, ∆ r plus f s , and only f s criterion, respectively. Each cell shows two values, of which the first one is the relaxation fraction for Gadget-MUSIC and the second value is for Gadget-X. Clusters with M 200 &lt; 6.42 × 10 14 h -1 M (mass bins above the dashed line) are taken from the comprehensive sample. ∼ 9 × 10 14 h -1 M . Above this halo mass the ratio drops to around 1 again. It is worth noting that for M 500 there is a larger scatter of ∼ 8 per cent for the complete sample and ∼ 4 per cent for the relaxed sub-sample. We ascribe this larger mass change for M 500 to baryonic processes which have a larger effect closer to the cluster's centre and for the less massive haloes. The two simulation codes show similar results for M &gt; ∼ 10 15 h -1 M at both overdensities, which means that the baryon physics has little influence on both M 500 and M 200 at this cluster mass range. For the M 200 mass changes, this is in agreement with previous similar comparisons (e.g. Cui et al. 2012Cui et al. , 2014bCui et al. , 2016b)). For M 500 , Cui et al. (2014b) reported a slight mass decrease when AGN feedback is included and a slight mass increase without AGN feedback. At this halo mass range, M 500 &gt; 10 14.5 h -1 M , the difference between Gadget-X and Cui et al. (2014b) could be caused by either a sample effect (Cui et al. 2014b studied very few clusters) or due to the details of the baryonic model implemented in the simulation. We will explore this in detail in a follow-up paper (Cui et al. in prep.) which will also focus on cluster mass estimates based upon different observational methods applied to our simulation data.re-calibration orphan galaxies intra-cluster stars luminosities finder definitions, i.e. it avoids effects introduced by using results from different halo finders (Knebe et al. 2011(Knebe et al. , 2013)). Further, AHF can extract haloes self-consistently from simulations including gas and stars as well as dark matter. We use the halo centre position as the primary criteria for matching the clusters and select the one with the nearest mass when there are multiple matches. As previously mentioned the exact halo positions will have moved slightly from those in the original dark-matter only simulation but these changes are generally small (at the level of a few percent of the virial radius in most cases, Cui et al. 2016b). Occasionally the differences are larger, typically due to the presence of an ongoing merger.

        <p>A quantitative analysis of the relaxation fraction within our comprehensive halo catalogue, for different mass bins and with different combinations of relaxation parameters is given in Table 4. The fraction of relaxed clusters shows a clear decreasing trend as halo mass increases. This is simply because the more massive the object is, the less likely it is to have reached dynamical relaxation by redshift z = 0. This can be traced back to the relation between formation time and halo mass (see Fig. 2 in Power et al. 2012, for instance). There is very little change in relaxation fraction for the complete sample when different criteria are applied. There is a noticeable difference in the relaxed cluster fraction for the smallest mass bin, with the fraction for Gadget-X being significantly lower (∼ 8 per cent) than that for Gadget-MUSIC when all three criteria are applied. This is due to the AGN feedback in Gadget-X efficiently ceasing star formation in small objects and creating gas turbulence. The relaxation fractions for the mass-complete sample from both Gadget-MUSIC and Gadget-X show an obvious decrease. On the contrary to the smallest mass bin, the relaxation fraction from Gadget-MUSIC seems lower than from Gadget-X. This overturn is simply because the mass fraction of substructures in Gadget-MUSIC is higher than Gadget-X, which dominates the relaxation fraction. In an upcoming paper we will provide a more detailed investigation of the evolution of the cluster dynamical state and the impact of input physics on various observational classification methods (Old et al. in prep.).A quantitative analysis of the relaxation fraction within our comprehensive halo catalogue, for different mass bins and with different combinations of relaxation parameters is given in Table 4.

        <p>Knowledge of the halo concentration, c, and mass, M, would specify the full evolution of a halo in the spherical collapse model (Bullock et al. 2001). The relation c-M between these two fundamental properties, alongside its standard deviation, are related to the variance in the assembly histories of dark matter haloes (e.g. Zhao et al. 2003a,b). Furthermore, the normalization and evolution of this relation also depend on the cosmological model (e.g. Dolag et al. 2004;Carlesi et al. 2012).

The c -M relation from the Gadget-MUSIC run is slightly higher than from the Gadget-X run and it is in better agreement with observational results which have lower concentrations. It is obvious that the concentrations with a 34 h -1 kpc inner cut-off are systematically higher than the ones with a 0.05 R 200 cut-off (see also Rasia et al. 2013, for similar results with different inner radii). Our fitted c -M relation from the Gadget-X clusters is much flatter than Schaller et al. (2015a), simply because their fit covers a much larger mass range, which is dominated by the lower mass objects. Furthermore, Gadget-X shows an increasing slope with β = -0.01 when a fixed inner radius of 34 h -1 kpc is taken. This can be understood because 34 h -1 kpc corresponds to a smaller fraction of R 200 for a massive cluster than for a less massive halo. Therefore it is not surprising to see a relatively high concentration for the most massive haloes when a fixed physical cut-off radius is applied.It is evident that the c -M relation from our hydrosimulated clusters is closer to the observational results from Merten et al.

        <p>In the right panel of Fig. 4, we investigate the baryon effects on the c -M relation by showing the relative change in concentration from dark-matter-only simulated clusters to their equivalent in the two hydro-runs. The change on c -M relation due to baryons varies from ∼ 25 per cent (for both radii) for Gadget-X to about 1.5 -2 times (0.05 R 200 -34 h -1 kpc) for Gadget-MUSIC. However, this ratio is much lower for the highest mass bin for Gadget-X with both inner radii (also for Gadget-MUSIC with the inner radius of 34 h -1 kpc). The influence of baryons on the concentration is a little higher than in Rasia et al.

        <p>The formation of a galaxy cluster depends not only on gravity acting on cosmic scales but also on sub-resolution phe-nomena such as star formation and various feedback mechanisms returning energy back to the intra-cluster gas. It is a process that involves interplay between dark and baryonic matter. One of the most important quantities to quantify the relation between dark matter and baryons is the baryonic mass fraction. It has therefore been intensively studied: on the theoretical side, mostly by means of hydrodynamical simulations (e.g. Sembolini et al. 2013;Planelles et al. 2013;Wu et al. 2015;Barnes et al. 2017b); on the observational side via multi-wavelength observations (e.g. Laganá et al. 2013;Eckert et al. 2016;Chiu et al. 2017).The formation of a galaxy cluster depends not only on gravity acting on cosmic scales but also on sub-resolution phe-nomena such as star formation and various feedback mechanisms returning energy back to the intra-cluster gas.

        <p>In Fig. 5, we show the gas and stellar mass fractions for the comprehensive sample from hydrodynamical simulations within R 500 . The gas fraction for Gadget-X is larger than for Gadget-MUSIC at the massive end, and drops more quickly towards lower mass haloes. The gas fraction from Gadget-X shows a better agreement with the data of Gonzalez et al. (2013) at the massive end; both simulations are in line with the results from Zhang et al. (2011) due to its large scatter. The offset between the two hydro-runs is much larger (a factor of 2 -3) for the stellar fraction. Again, Gadget-X shows a better agreement with the observational data points at the massive end. However, it has a flatter slope than the observational results, which is close to the Gadget-MUSIC result at M 500 10 13.5 h -1 M . This is possibly caused by the strong AGN feedback in Gadget-X. Essentially both hydrodynamic models have a stellar fraction versus mass slope that is inconsistent with the observational data.In Fig. 5, we show the gas and stellar mass fractions for the comprehensive sample from hydrodynamical simulations within R 500 .

        <p>Previous comparisons of the stellar and gas mass frac- tions from full-physics hydrodynamical simulations with observations have shown that models without AGN feedback consistently have too low a gas fraction and too high a stellar fraction due to the over-cooling problem (for example Planelles et al. 2013). This is also seen in Fig. 5 comparing the Gadget-MUSIC and the Gadget-X runs. Although Gadget-X tends to have a better agreement with the observational results, the AGN feedback implementation featured by this code is still not perfect: the most massive clusters at M 500 10 15 h -1 M still have a stellar fraction that is a little too high; while intermediate and low mass haloes (M 500 10 14 h -1 M ) have stellar fractions that are too low. Nevertheless, we note that the stellar mass fraction estimated from observations is not without issues: there is relative uncertainty about the contribution of the intra-cluster light (for example Zibetti et al. 2005;Gonzalez et al. 2007;Puchwein et al. 2010;Cui et al. 2014a), which is included in Gonzalez et al.

(2011); another problem is the influence of the different initial mass functions adopted in observations to derive stellar mass from luminosities (see e.g. Chiu et al. 2017, for detailed discussions).Previous comparisons of the stellar and gas mass frac- tions from full-physics hydrodynamical simulations with observations have shown that models without AGN feedback consistently have too low a gas fraction and too high a stellar fraction due to the over-cooling problem (for example Planelles et al. 2013). This is also seen in Fig. 5 comparing the Gadget-MUSIC and the Gadget-X runs. Although Gadget-X tends to have a better agreement with the observational results, the AGN feedback implementation featured by this code is still not perfect: the most massive clusters at M 500 10 15 h -1 M still have a stellar fraction that is a little too high; while intermediate and low mass haloes (M 500 10 14 h -1 M ) have stellar fractions that are too low. Nevertheless, we note that the stellar mass fraction estimated from observations is not without issues: there is relative uncertainty about the contribution of the intra-cluster light (for example Zibetti et al. 2005;Gonzalez et al. 2007;Puchwein et al. 2010;Cui et al. 2014a), which is included in Gonzalez et al.

        <p>Scaling relations between the total cluster mass and observational quantities are derived in several multi-wavelength studies. Commonly used observational probes include stellar luminosity, X-ray temperature or the Comptonization parameter (e.g. Reiprich &amp; Böhringer 2002;Lin et al. 2004;Andersson et al. 2011), which normally show a self-similar relation to cluster mass. They are very powerful tools to derive total cluster masses from different observations. Before this can happen, they need to be accurately calibrated and their dispersions properly estimated. It is worth noting that the scaling relations derived from observations could be biased by sample selection which should have no influence on our mass-complete sample. In this section, we investigate the scaling relations found in our hydrodynamical simulations, and compare them with those from SAMs and observations.Scaling relations between the total cluster mass and observational quantities are derived in several multi-wavelength studies.

        <p>How galaxy properties relate to their host dark matter halo is an open question in astronomy.

        <p>The Three Hundred Project 11 here that the haloes from the comprehensive sample with mass below the completeness limit constitute a biased sample, which are lying in a dense environment compared to observations. We only include central galaxies in the calculation as the haloes of satellites galaxies will have suffered tidal disruption. However, as the hydrodynamical simulations feature stars in the halo (which can be treated as ICL), we also include the mass of the ICL in the calculation for the SAMs SAG and SAGE. Therefore, the central galaxy here is BCG+ICL. In agreement with our previous findings in Figs. 1 and5, Gadget-MUSIC has the highest stellarto-halo-mass fraction. SAGE, SAG and Gadget-X are in the second family, which tend to agree with the observational result at the lower mass end, but deviate from them at the massive end. Galacticus, which does not have ICL included, is in better agreement with Rodríguez-Puebla et al. (2017); Yang et al. (2009). Moreover, we confirm that SAGE also presents a better agreement with the observations if the ICL is excluded. We further note here that the BCG mass from Ragone-Figueroa et al. ( 2018) (a similar cluster simulation based on Gadget-X) is in a good agreement with observational results after applying a cut in radius. In addition, Pillepich et al. (2018) also reported that the exact functional form and magnitude of the stellar mass to halo mass relation strongly depend on the definition of a central galaxy's stellar mass. Therefore, the differences shown in this plot could be simply caused by the definition of the central galaxy. We further include the fitting result from Kravtsov et al. (2018) mass plus ICL mass. It is interesting to see that their M BCG -M halo relation is much closer to the results from our models (except Gadget-MUSIC which is far from any observation results and Galacticus which does not include ICL), especially at M halo 10 14 h -1 M . However, the offsets between the solid purple line and our model results (including Galacticus when compared with the observational results that do not include ICL) are still large for the most massive haloes.

        <p>Though the satellite-galaxy stellar-mass function is not a scaling relation, we briefly switch focus from central galaxies to satellite galaxies and present the result in this subsection. We only use the mass-complete sample for this investigation and limit our satellite galaxies to objects within R 200 as per the observational sample. We show the stellar mass function -median averaged over all clusters -in Fig. 7. As indicated in the legend, different style thin lines represent different versions of the simulations and SAMs, while observational results from Yang et al. (2018) at two different cluster mass bins are highlighted as thick lines. Note that the complete cluster sample is used here without further binning in halo mass, because its mass limit is basically comparable with Yang's most massive mass bin. The lower mass bin from Yang's catalogue is presented here to aid the comparison. The horizontal extensions to the red and blue curves are artefacts of the median values. Compared to the observational results, Gadget-MUSIC has more massive satellite galaxies with masses M * &gt; 10 11.5 h -1 M . Gadget-X shows a slightly reduced number of satellite galaxies towards the low mass end. Galacticus features the opposite trend. These deviations from the actual observations can be understood as an overabundance of massive satellite galaxies in Gadget-MUSIC due to the lack of AGN feedback; too few low mass satellite galaxies in Gadget-X can be caused by either a resolution issue (note that galaxies of M * ≈ 10 10 h -1 M only contain a few hundreds of stellar particles due to the poor simulation resolution) or the striped/heated gas due to the Wendland kernel and feedback; too many low mass satellite galaxies in Galacticus is because of a surplus of orphan galaxies (see Table 2 in Knebe et al. 2018). SAG and SAGE seem not to suffer from this problem due to their different treatment of the orphan galaxy population. We refer to Pujol et al. (2017) for a detailed comparison of the orphan galaxies between different SAMs. However, we note that the scatter across models seen here is at the level found in previous comparisons of theoretically modelled galaxy stellar mass functions of galaxies (Knebe et al. 2015(Knebe et al. , 2018)).Though the satellite-galaxy stellar-mass function is not a scaling relation, we briefly switch focus from central galaxies to satellite galaxies and present the result in this subsection.

        <p>We continue to investigate the correlations between luminosity/magnitude, stellar mass, and colours by comparing our modelled galaxies to the observational results from Yang et al. (2018). We again only use the galaxies from our mass-complete sample here. For a fair comparison to our theoretical data, we apply the same mass cut (M 200 ≥ 6.42 × 10 14 h -1 M ) to the group catalogue of Yang et al.

        <p>In the top panel, we recover a very tight correlation between luminosity and stellar mass with little variation between observation and the models (excluding SAG). Gadget-MUSIC, Gadget-X, Galacticus and Yang's observational results are binned only in stellar mass and presented by symbols with error-bars indicating the 16 th -84 th percentile. While SAG, which tends to have a larger spread in luminosity, is shown with cyan contours. Moreover, we fit the M * -luminosity relation for the models (excluding SAG) and the observational result with a linear function f (x) = ax. We find that all the models give a consistent result with a slope of 0.895, which is shown by the solid black line shifted up by 0.5 dex in the top panel.

As the comprehensive sample forms a mass-incomplete set of haloes they may conceivably be a biased dataset. Such a bias could in principle arise due to their physical proximity to a larger halo but how to accurately quantify such a bias, if it exists, is unclear. Best-fit curves are shown as a magenta dotted line for Gadget-MUSIC and a green dashed line for Gadget-X; the parameters are summarized both in the legend and Table 6. Since the low mass data has less weight and there are few clusters in the high mass range, it is not surprising to see that the fitting lines are offset from the symbols which show the median values in each mass bin.We especially note here that we exclude the h in the normalization mass of the fitting equation (3).

        <p>The best fitting parameters are slightly different between the two hydrodynamical simulations: Gadget-MUSIC has a steeper slope close to the self-similar relation with B = 2/3 (Kaiser 1986, also predicted by the non-radiative simulations, see Bryan &amp; Norman 1998;Thomas et al. 2001 for example) compared to Gadget-X. This is mainly caused by the low temperature of the clusters with small halo mass. Compared to the results from Vikhlinin et al. (2006Vikhlinin et al. ( , 2009)), there is a good agreement at low halo mass with our simulations. However, there is a clear offset between our simulation result and their results for massive haloes. This could be caused by the hydrostatic method used in observations which can underestimate the total mass due to a non-thermal pressure component. This bias has been corrected in Lovisari et al. (2015), which, although it is still above our best fit lines, is closer to our data for the most massive haloes (closer to Gadget-MUSIC than to Gadget-X). In addition, their result is also slightly higher than our simulation results at low halo mass. This is because of the spectrum-weighted temperature adopted in Lovisari et al. (2015), which is about 14 per cent higher than the mass weighted temperature (Vikhlinin et al. 2006;Biffi et al. 2014). We follow Biffi et al. (2014) by correcting for this difference by scaling down the fitting function from Lovisari et al. (2015) by a factor of 1.14 (black dashed line in Fig. 9). This produces a very good match to the fitting result from Gadget-X. It is worth noting that the self-similar relation does not provide a good fit to our data (see also Truong et al. 2018). Lastly, Truong et al. (2018) reported lower temperatures than observed resulting in a normalization shift of about 10 per cent for the T -M relation for their AGN model. Similarly, Henden et al.

        <p>The best-fitting parameters from Planck Collaboration et al. ( 2014) are A = -4.19 and B = 1.79, which relies on mass estimates from a mass-proxy relation due to Kravtsov et al. (2006). The fitting result from Nagarajan et al. (2018) which used the weak lensing mass of the APEX-SZ clusters, is shown as a purple dash-dotted line with A = -4.16 and B = 1.51. We fit our simulation data to the same function and present the results in Fig. 10 for Gadget-MUSIC as a black dotted line and for Gadget-X as a green dashed line. The value of the best-fitting parameters are shown in both the figure legend and Table 7. Compared to the best-fit Planck relation, our simulation results have a slightly flatter slope. However, comparing to the result from Nagarajan et al. (2018) who used a more precise mass estimation method, both Gadget-X and Gadget-MUSIC are slightly above (similar offsets as comparing with the Planck result) the purple line at the high mass end. On the contrary, the Planck (APEX-SZ) fitting line is under (above) the simulation results at the low mass end (M 500 &lt; 10 13.5 h -1 M ). In addition, Gadget-X only shows a marginally higher amplitude than Gadget-MUSIC, especially at the high-mass end of the relation. Both are also in agreement with the self-similar relation with B = 5/3 (e.g. Bonamente et al. 2008). This means that the scaling between M 500 and Y 500 is almost independent of the gas physics and is the more robust relation, which is in agreement with Planelles et al. (2017);Truong et al. (2018), for example. It is worth noting that neither observations used mass M 500 &lt; 10 14 h -1 M to do the fitting. It is interesting to see that this scaling relation extends down to mass M 500 = 10 13 h -1 M for our models.The best-fitting parameters from Planck Collaboration et al.

        <p>In this paper we introduce The Three Hundred project, i.e. a data base of more than 300 synthetic galaxy clusters with mass M 200 &gt; 6 × 10 14 h -1 M . The clusters have been individually modelled in a cosmological volume of side length 1 h -1 Gpc with all the relevant baryonic physics (including AGN feedback) using the 'modern' SPH code 
            <rs type="software">Gadget-X</rs> (Beck et al. 2016). The large re-simulation regions of radius 15 h -1 Mpc -centred on the 324 most massive galaxy clusters as found in the parent dark matter only MDPL2 simulation -contain many additional objects, in total about 5500 objects with a mass M 200 &gt; 10 13 h -1 M . This suite of massive galaxy clusters therefore not only allows to study the formation and evolution of a mass-complete sample, but also carefully investigate their environments and the preprocessing of material entering the galaxy cluster.
        </p>
        <p>This introductory paper focuses on presenting the galaxy clusters by primarily studying their redshift z = 0 properties and comparing them to observational data. This serves as a validation of the public data. Additionally, we do have at our disposal the same suite of clusters, but simulated with a 'classical' SPH technique and without AGN feedback (i.e. the Gadget-MUSIC code, Sembolini et al. 2013). This forms a comparison benchmark, demonstrating the differences that choices surrounding physical prescriptions can make. We further presented -where appropriate -the results as obtained via three distinct SAMs (Galacticus, SAG, and SAGE) that were applied to the underlying dark matter only MDPL2 simulation. A comparison between full physics simulations and semi-analytic models of galaxy formation on this scale or with this number of objects adds to existing efforts of gauging the relevance of various physical processes and its numerical modelling. In subsequent papers we will apply a more elaborate analysis including redshift evolution and formation processes.This introductory paper focuses on presenting the galaxy clusters by primarily studying their redshift z = 0 properties and comparing them to observational data.

        <p>• The dynamically relaxed cluster sample has a c -M relation which appears to be flat for Gadget-X across the considered mass range. The concentrations for Gadget-MUSIC are generally larger (factor of approx. 1.3) and in better agreement with observations. In both models the concentrations of the hydrodynamically modelled clusters are larger than those of their dark matter only counterparts; for Gadget-MUSIC this applies to the full mass range whereas for Gadget-X concentrations appear unaffected by the inclusion of baryon physics beyond 10 15 h -1 M .• The dynamically relaxed cluster sample has a c -M relation which appears to be flat for Gadget-X across the considered mass range.

The fitting for the hydrodynamical simulations extends to 10 13 h -1 M , which shows the power of the scaling relation. The small difference between the two simulations indicates that baryonic processes only have a weak influence on these relations (see also Hahn et al. 2017).• For the gas scaling relations, both Gadget-X and Gadget-MUSIC are generally in agreement with the observational temperature-mass and Y 500 -mass relations.

        <p>We close with the concluding remark that our theoreti-cally modelled galaxies and galaxy clusters generally present similar results and matches to observations -at least on certain scales of interest. However, we do see deviations in multiple aspects between these models and the observations, especially for the massive central galaxy (BCG+ICL). To understand the disagreements and to connect them with the input sub-grid baryonic models, we need to a) extend the comparisons to even smaller scales than the ones presented here, b) consistently derive quantities by mimicking observations more quantitatively, and c) track the impact of these baryonic models over a wider range of redshifts. Eventually, as our cluster sample contains different physical implementations of various baryonic processes from both hydrodynamic and SAM modelling, this will allow us to investigate, understand, and pin down the differences between our results and connect them back with the underlying physics. Several such follow-up works are already under way and will be presented separately from this introductory paper (e.g., Vega-Martínez et al. in prep.; Li et al. in prep.). Further, in a companion paper (Mostoghiu et al. 2018), we investigate the density profile of these clusters together with its evolution. And in (Wang et al. 2018) the analysis is extended to the comprehensive sample of haloes in the re-simulation regions, investigating how the environment affects their properties and, in particular, the star formation rate. Furthermore, disentangling the BCG from ICL (Cañas et al., in prep.) will help us to understand the too massive central galaxy problem in detail.

        <p>In Fig. A1, we show the cumulative halo mass functions for the two mass definitions M 200 (left panel) and M 500 (right panel) as derived from MDPL2 (solid black lines), Gadget-MUSIC (red dashed lines) and Gadget-X (blue dot-dash lines). There are five families of lines inside each panel, which, from left to right, show the results at z = 4.0, 2.3, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0. The mass function of the full halo catalogue from the MDPL2 is used here as a reference line. The vertical dashed lines indicates the mass down to which our sample is complete, determined by the crossing point between the Gadget-X and MDPL2 lines. The mass limit will slightly decrease at some redshifts if Gadget-MUSIC were to be used instead of Gadget-X. This is caused by the baryon effects, as Gadget-MUSIC forms more stars. In order to make sure the complete sample is chosen to be conservative, we use Gadget-X which returns a higher mass limit. We especially note here that the complete sample is based on the MDPL2 halo mass function. This matching ignores any baryon effects on the halo mass function. However, this could only affect a small number of them near the mass limitation (see Fig. 2 for the mass difference). The precise values for these limits for our mass-complete sample are presented in table A1.In Fig. A1, we show the cumulative halo mass functions for the two mass definitions M 200 (left panel) and M 500 (right panel) as derived from MDPL2 (solid black lines), Gadget-MUSIC (red dashed lines) and Gadget-X (blue dot-dash lines).

In order to make sure the complete sample is chosen to be conservative, we use Gadget-X which returns a higher mass limit. We especially note here that the complete sample is based on the MDPL2 halo mass function. This matching ignores any baryon effects on the halo mass function. However, this could only affect a small number of them near the mass limitation (see Fig. 2 for the mass difference). The precise values for these limits for our mass-complete sample are presented in table A1.</p>
        <p>Below the mass-complete limits the completeness fraction, which will be used later to weight the fitting of the scaling relations, is calculated by the ratio of these lines. It is interesting to note that even at z = 1 the number of clusters in the complete sample has fallen dramatically. This is because there is significant shuffling in the rank order of the most massive objects in the sample. The set of the largest objects at z = 4 bears little relation to the largest objects at z = 0 and one set does not evolve uniquely into the other. Conversely, the largest objects identified at z = 0 are not all the largest objects at higher redshift and modelling them alone does not produce a large mass-complete sample at earlier times. We further note here that there is only a few mass-complete clusters at z ≥ 2.3. The mass limits are more useful for indicating the boundary of the un-complete sample than for selecting the complete sample for statistical studies.Below the mass-complete limits the completeness fraction, which will be used later to weight the fitting of the scaling relations, is calculated by the ratio of these lines.
