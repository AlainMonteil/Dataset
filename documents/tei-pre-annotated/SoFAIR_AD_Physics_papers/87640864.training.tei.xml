        <p>A new hyperbolic-type memristor emulator is presented and its frequency-dependent pinched hysteresis loops are analyzed by numerical simulations and confirmed by hardware experiments. Based on the emulator, a novel hyperbolic-type memristor based 3-neuron Hopfield neural network (HNN) is proposed, which is achieved through substituting one coupling-connection weight with a memristive synaptic weight. It is numerically shown that the memristive HNN has a dynamical transition from chaotic, to periodic, and further to stable point behaviors with the variations of the memristor inner parameter, implying the stabilization effect of the hyperbolic-type memristor on the chaotic HNN. Of particular interest, it should be highly stressed that for different memristor inner parameters, different coexisting behaviors of asymmetric attractors are emerged under different initial conditions, leading to the existence of multistable oscillation states in the memristive HNN. Furthermore, by using commercial discrete components, a nonlinear circuit is designed and PSPICE circuit simulations and hardware experiments are performed. The results simulated and captured from the realization circuit are consistent with numerical simulations, which well verify the facticity of coexisting asymmetric attractors' behaviors.A new hyperbolic-type memristor emulator is presented and its frequency-dependent pinched hysteresis loops are analyzed by numerical simulations and confirmed by hardware experiments.

        <p>With the appearance of memristor (Strukov et al., 2008), it gradually generates far-reaching influence in the field of circuit fundamental theory. Since memristor is a nonlinear two-terminal element (Chua, 2012), a large number of research achievements with respect to memristive chaotic circuits have been reached by introducing different memristors into some classical application circuits (Bao et al., 2014(Bao et al., , 2015(Bao et al., , 2016a,b;,b;Chen et al., 2015;Kengne et al., 2015;Li et al., 2015;Wu et al., 2016;Xu et al., 2016;Zhou et al., 2017). Similarly, memristor can be also applied to the artificial neural network because the characteristic of neuron synapse is similar to the feature of memristor (Chua et al., 2012;Kim et al., 2012;Prezioso et al., 2015;Wang Z. R. et al., 2016), which has been drawn broad researchers' more and more attention in recent years (Wang et al., 2011;Adhikari et al., 2012;Li et al., 2014;Duan et al., 2015;Pham et al., 2016;Wang L. D. et al., 2016;Yang et al., 2017). These researches in physiology and anatomy are more effective to help us understand the dynamical properties of a large network (Korn and Faure, 2003).

        <p>For the two nonzero equilibrium points P 1 = (δ 1 , δ 2 , δ 3 , δ 4 ) and P 2 = (η 1 , η 2 , η 3 , η 4 ), however, the corresponding eigenvalues should be solved by using

When k = 0.8 and a = 1, for different memristor inner parameter b, two nonzero equilibrium points P 1 and P 2 , their corresponding eigenvalues, and the generating attractor types are shown in Table 2. Therefore, it can be seen that the nonzero equilibrium points P 1 and P 2 are asymmetric, P 1 is a stable node-focus for b ≥ 0.44, and whereas P 2 always is an unstable saddle-focus, leading to the emergence of coexisting asymmetric attractors' behaviors. Moreover, the results in Table 2 demonstrate that when the value of the parameter b increases, the dynamical behaviors of the hyperbolic-type memristor based HNN have transitions from unstable chaotic to unstable periodic and then to stable point behaviors, i.e., the dynamical behaviors of the HNN can be stabilized by the hyperbolic-type memristor.

When Right-stable point attractor and left-period-3 limit cycle the memristor inner parameter b is adjusted in the region of [0, 0.6], the coexisting behaviors of asymmetric attractors in the hyperbolic-type memristor based HNN can be revealed by bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponent spectra, and phase portraits.

When the parameter b is gradually increased in the region of (0, 0.4), the dynamical behaviors of system Equation ( 8) are basically consistent for different initial conditions and their orbits all start from chaos, enter into a large periodic window with zero largest Lyapunov exponents via reverse period doubling bifurcation routes, then break into chaos via tangent bifurcation routes, further turn into chaos with narrow bands via crisis scenarios, and last degrade into period via reverse period doubling bifurcation routes. It is especially interesting that coexisting behaviors of asymmetric attractors can be also observed, which are mainly emerged in two regions of [0.2595, 0.2640] and [0.4, 0.6] due to the occurrences of the crisis scenarios under the initial conditions of (0, -0.1, 0, 0) and (1, 0, 0, 0). For some determined values of the parameter b, the phase portraits of coexisting asymmetric attractors in the x 1x 3 plane are depicted in Figure 6, where four different kinds of coexisting asymmetric attractors are exhibited. Based on the above theoretical analyses, it can be known that the generating chaotic attractors and limit cycles in Figure 6 are associated with two unstable saddle-foci and the convergent point attractor in Figure 6D is related to a stable node-focus. Consequently, the hyperbolic-type memristor based HNN is self-excited but not hidden (Danca and Kuznetsov, 2017).When k = 0.8, the bifurcation diagrams of the state variable x 1 and the corresponding first two Lyapunov exponents are shown in Figures 5A,B, respectively, from which unstable chaotic, unstable periodic, and stable point behaviors as well as period doubling bifurcation routes, tangent bifurcation routes, and crisis scenarios can be found.
