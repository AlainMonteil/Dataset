        <p>Modern and future surveys effectively provide a panchromatic view for large numbers of extragalactic objects. Consistently modeling these multiwavelength survey data is a critical but challenging task for extragalactic studies. The 
            <rs type="software">Code Investigating GALaxy Emission (CIGALE)</rs> is an efficient PYTHON code for spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Recently, a major extension of 
            <rs type="software">CIGALE</rs> (named 
            <rs type="software">X-CIGALE</rs>) has been developed to account for AGN/galaxy X-ray emission and improve AGN modeling at UV-to-IR wavelengths. Here, we apply X
            <rs type="software">-CIGALE</rs> to different samples, including Cosmological Evolution Survey (COSMOS) spectroscopic type 2 AGNs, Chandra Deep Field-South X-ray detected normal galaxies, Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars, and COSMOS radio objects. From these tests, we identify several weaknesses of 
            <rs type="software">X-CIGALE</rs> and improve the code accordingly. These improvements are mainly related to AGN intrinsic X-ray anisotropy, X-ray binary emission, AGN accretion-disk SED shape, and AGN radio emission. These updates improve the fit quality and allow for new interpretation of the results, based on which we discuss physical implications. For example, we find that AGN intrinsic X-ray anisotropy is moderate, and can be modeled as ( ) q q µ + L 1 cos X , where θ is the viewing angle measured from the AGN axis. We merge the new code into the major branch of 
            <rs type="software">CIGALE</rs>, and publicly release this new version as

        <p>Extragalactic surveys from X-ray to radio have become increasingly important for studying the evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes across cosmic history. Broad wavelength coverage provides insights into a diversity of properties of extragalactic sources. X-rays can reveal intrinsic active galactic nucleus (AGN) emission, even when it is obscured. UV/optical light traces young stars and unobscured AGN accretion disks. IR light reveals the dust-obscured AGN and/or star formation (SF) activities. Radio emission can be generated by high-energy electrons associated with, e.g., AGN jets, AGN-driven winds, and HII regions.Extragalactic surveys from X-ray to radio have become increasingly important for studying the evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes across cosmic history.

        <p>Modern surveys such as Legacy Survey of Space and Time (Ivezić et al. 2019) and eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS; Predehl et al. 2021) can sample millions to billions of diverse objects, from luminous quasars to low-luminosity AGNs, and from brightest cluster galaxies to dwarf galaxies. Interpreting these large volumes of multiwavelength data coherently and efficiently is a challenging task for extragalactic studies.Modern surveys such as Legacy Survey of Space and Time (Ivezić et al. 2019) and eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS; Predehl et al. 2021) can sample millions to billions of diverse objects, from luminous quasars to low-luminosity AGNs, and from brightest cluster galaxies to dwarf galaxies.

        <p>Many codes have been developed to fit AGN/galactic spectral energy distributions (SEDs; see Figure 1 of Thorne et al. 2021 for a summary of different codes). The 
            <rs type="software">Code Investigating GALaxy Emission (CIGALE)</rs> is an open-source SED-fitting code written in 
            <rs type="software">PYTHON</rs> (Burgarella et al. 2005;Boquien et al. 2019). It employs a parallel algorithm, able to build thousands of SED models per second and fit them to data. The SED models are built through a series of "modules" defined by the user. This architecture is designed to allow for easy updates or even the addition of branches in the code that carry scientific investigations. For example, the dust-attenuation module applies a specific attenuation recipe to the starlight and line emission, and the dust-emission module is responsible for the IR dust radiation. The dust-emission module always normalizes the SED so that the re-emitted total energy is equal to the obscured total energy in the dust-attenuation module. In this way, 
            <rs type="software">CIGALE</rs> obeys the law of energy conservation. 
            <rs type="software">CIGALE</rs> has an AGN module that is responsible for the UV-to-IR emission from AGNs (Ciesla et al. 2015;Boquien et al. 2019).

        <p>Recently, Yang et al. (2020) developed a major CIGALE extension, X-CIGALE, adding a brand new range of the electromagnetic spectrum (i.e., X-ray) to the existing UV-toradio range. Yang et al. (2020) also implemented several AGNrelated improvements including a clumpy torus model and a polar-dust model for X-CIGALE. The X-ray module allows for the modeling of X-ray fluxes, accounting for the emission from both AGNs and galaxies (i.e., hot gas and X-ray binaries). X- CIGALE has become increasingly popular especially among AGN researchers (e.g., Zou et al. 2020;Mountrichas et al. 2021b;Ni et al. 2021;Toba et al. 2021;Yang et al. 2021).Recently, Yang et al.

        <p>In this work, we aim at testing 
            <rs type="software">X-CIGALE</rs> on diverse extragalactic populations; therefore, we use several AGN/galaxy samples selected over different wavelength ranges, including COSMOS spectroscopic type 2 AGNs, Chandra Deep Field-South (CDF-S) X-ray detected normal galaxies, Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars, and COSMOS radio objects. From these tests, we identify weaknesses and improve the code accordingly. These improvements are mainly related to AGN X-ray anisotropy, binary X-ray emission, AGN accretion-disk SED shape, and AGN radio emission. We discuss the physical implications based on the fitting results of the new code. Finally, we merge the new code into the main branch of 
            <rs type="software">CIGALE</rs>, after minimizing the differences between the two branches in terms of, e.g., coding structures and variable naming. This procedure removes a heavy burden of software maintenance, because, previously, an upgrade (such as algorithm improvements and additional functionalities) in 
            <rs type="software">CIGALE</rs> had to be modified and tested before implementation into 
            <rs type="software">X-CIGALE</rs>, and vice versa. We publicly release the merged software as

        <p>The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we fit a sample of type 2 AGNs and implement AGN anisotropic X-ray emission. In Section 3, we fit a sample of X-ray detected normal galaxies (non-AGNs) and introduce a flexible recipe for binary X-ray emission. In Section 4, we fit a sample of type 1 quasars and implement code changes allowing for more flexible AGN disk SED shapes. In Section 5, we fit a sample of radio sources and introduce an AGN radio component to the radio module. In Section 6, we present some miscellaneous updates of the code. We summarize our results and discuss future prospects in Section 7.The structure of this paper is as follows.

        <p>It is generally believed that the observed X-rays are a result of a "disk-corona" structure. The disk emits UV/optical photons, and a fraction of them are up-scattered to X-ray wavelengths by the high-energy electrons in the corona (i.e., inverse Compton scattering). The angular dependence of the X-ray emission is related to the detailed physical properties of the corona, such as shape and optical depth (e.g., Sunyaev &amp; Titarchuk 1985;Xu 2015).It is generally believed that the observed X-rays are a result of a "disk-corona" structure.

(2015) suggested that AGN X-ray emission might be anisotropic (see their Section 5.4 for details).The observations of Liu et al.

        <p>Our fitting parameters are listed in Table 1. For the star formation history (SFH), we adopt a delayed τ SFH model and a Bruzual &amp; Charlot (2003) simple stellar population model. We adopt the Calzetti et al. (2000) galaxy attenuation law and the Dale et al. (2014) dust IR spectral templates. For AGN IR emission, we adopt the SKIRTOR clumpy torus model (Stalevski et al. 2012(Stalevski et al. , 2016)). We fix the torus half-opening angle to the default 40°, which is observationally preferred (e.g., Stalevski et al. 2016). Under this setting, there are four type-2 viewing angles (60°, 70°, 80°, and 90°) available in SKIRTOR, and we allow all of these values in our fits (see Table 1). The full SKIRTOR model set has another five parameters such as 9.7 μm optical depth and ratio of outer to inner radius. These parameters generally have minor effects on the broadband SED shapes (e.g., Yang et al. 2020), and thus we leave them at the default values to reduce the needed computing resources. In summary, we employ four templates (corresponding to different viewing angles) out of the total 19200 SKIRTOR models. In X-CIGALE, AGN X-ray and UV/ optical emissions are related with the α ox -L ν,2500Å relation of Just et al.

Under the scheme of AGN unification (e.g., Antonucci 1993;Urry &amp; Padovani 1995;Netzer 2015), our type 2 AGNs should also follow the α ox -L ν,2500Å intrinsic relation (Equation ( 1)). To test this point, we plot the Δα ox = α ox, fitted -α ox, expected (i.e., deviation from the α ox -L ν,2500Å relation) distribution from our X-CIGALE run in Figure 2. The Δα ox values tend to be systematically negative, with a median value of -0.093 (corresponding to a factor of 1.75 lower in terms of L ν,2keV /L ν,2500Å ) for X-CIGALE. This result suggests that, with the assumption of isotropic AGN X-ray emission in X-CIGALE, the observed X-ray fluxes of our type 2 AGNs tend to systematically lie below the expectations from the α ox -L ν,2500Å relation.

For this source, the anisotropic models have better fitting quality than the isotropic model (as indicated by the reduced χ 2 labeled in Figure 1).

        <p>To assess the overall fitting quality, we calculate the difference of the Akaike information criterion (ΔAIC; Akaike 1974) between the CIGALE V
            <rs type="version">2022.0</rs> (anisotropic) and the X-CIGALE (isotropic) fits. This quantity is defined as ΔAIC = 2Δk + Δχ 2 , where Δk is the difference in the number of free parameters. Δk is zero for our case here. A lower ΔAIC indicates a stronger probability of anisotropic models. For example, ΔAIC &lt; -4 means the anisotropic model is more than ≈7 (e -ΔAIC/2 ) times more probable than the isotropic model, indicating a strong support for the former (e.g., Burnham &amp; Anderson 2002).

        <p>The example source in Figure 1 has ΔAIC &lt; -4, indicating that the anisotropic models are preferred over the isotropic model. When inspecting the residuals in Figure 1, one could be puzzled that the main difference between the X-CIGALE versus CIGALE V2022.0 fits is in the IR rather than X-ray. We note that the root of this difference is not related to the IR AGN emission model, as all fits are based on the same IR AGN models (Table 1). Instead, the actual cause is X-ray angle dependence, which is the only different setting among the fits. We briefly explain this cause below.The example source in Figure 1 has ΔAIC &lt; -4, indicating that the anisotropic models are preferred over the isotropic model.

        <p>From the Δα ox and the AIC analyses above, an isotropic AGN X-ray model is disfavored compared to the anisotropic model with (a 1 , a 2 ) = (0.5, 0). Therefore, AGN X-ray emission is likely weaker toward larger viewing angles, qualitatively consistent with the observations of Liu et al. (2014) and Asmus et al. (2015; see Section 2.1). On the other hand, the amplitude of this viewing-angle dependence is moderate, since (a 1 , a 2 ) = (0.5, 0) results in better fitting quality than (a 1 , a 2 ) = (1, 0) and (0.33, 0.67), which have stronger angular dependence (see Figure 3). The conclusion that AGN X-rays have weaker angular dependence than UV/optical [(a 1 , a 2 ) = (0.33, 0.67)] is understandable. The X-ray photons result from the inverse Compton scattering of the UV/optical seed photons, and the strength of anisotropy is suppressed by this scattering process (e.g., Xu 2015;Yang et al. 2020).From the Δα ox and the AIC analyses above, an isotropic AGN X-ray model is disfavored compared to the anisotropic model with (a 1 , a 2 ) = (0.5, 0).

        <p>We caution that our conclusion of X-ray angle dependence is for the overall type 2 AGN population rather than individual sources, as our analyses above are based on the statistical analyses of the entire type 2 sample. It might be possible that individual AGNs have different angular dependence, because the structure of the AGN corona, which produces the X-ray photons (Section 2.1), could vary among individual sources (e.g., Ricci et al. 2018;Tortosa et al. 2018).We caution that our conclusion of X-ray angle dependence is for the overall type 2 AGN population rather than individual sources, as our analyses above are based on the statistical analyses of the entire type 2 sample.

        <p>We set Γ = 1.8 in our runs (Table 1), but the actual powerlaw photon index for an X-ray AGN may range from ≈1.6 to ≈2.2 (e.g., Yang et al. 2016;Liu et al. 2017). The photon-index parameter can affect the model-predicted X-ray fluxes. To assess this effect, we repeat our runs allowing Γ to vary between 1.6 and 2.0. The resulting Δα ox and ΔAIC distributions are similar to those in Figures 2 and4, and the (a 1 , a 2 ) = (0.5, 0) configuration is still the most favored model. In Table 1, we adopt large viewing angles (60°) assuming the classic unification model, i.e., type 2 AGNs are obscured by the torus. However, some recent observations suggest that type 2 AGNs might also have small viewing angles and be obscured by polar dust (e.g., Mountrichas et al. 2021a;Ramos Padilla et al. 2022). To consider this possibility, we test new 
            <rs type="software">CIGALE</rs> runs allowing all available viewing-angle values in SKIRTOR (0-90°with a step of 10°). The result still favors the (a 1 , a 2 ) = (0.5, 0) anisotropic model, consistent with our original result. Based on the tests above, we consider our main conclusion not to be critically dependent on the adopted parameters of the photon index and viewing angle in Table 1.

            <rs type="software">CIGALE</rs> V
            <rs type="version">2022.0</rs>, we set the default (a 1 , a 2 ) to (0.5, 0) based on our results above. For general purposes of AGN modeling, the user does not need to change these default values. For the specific purposes of studying AGN X-ray anisotropy, the user can test different (a 1 , a 2 ) values in different runs and select the best parameters, like in our approach above. This method allows further studies of X-ray angular dependence for different AGN samples (e.g., high-accretion rates versus low-accretion rates), and thereby can provide insight into the properties of AGN coronae.

        <p>Both AGNs and normal galaxies can emit X-ray photons. Normal-galaxy X-rays originate primarily from point sources of X-ray binaries and diffuse hot gas. AGNs tend to be more luminous than normal galaxies at X-ray wavelengths. As a consequence, most of the X-ray detected sources in extragalactic surveys are AGNs. However, normal galaxies become increasingly important as survey depth improves. The 7 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South (CDF-S) survey has ≈30% of the X-ray detections classified as normal galaxies, and such sources dominate the faintest detections (Luo et al. 2017). It is thereby expected that many more normal galaxies will be detected in deep surveys by future X-ray telescopes with large collecting areas such as Athena and Lynx. Therefore, it is critical to have realistic recipes for normal-galaxy X-ray modeling.Both AGNs and normal galaxies can emit X-ray photons.

While X-CIGALE adopted the instantaneous SFR when calculating L X HMXB , we adopt the average SFR over 100 Myr in CIGALE V2022.0.

This is because X-CIGALE is forced to use a stellar population model that corresponds to a relatively high X-ray emission, although this model does not well fit the observed UV fluxes. This example highlights the importance of introducing δ HMXB and δ LMXB , without which inappropriate stellar models might be selected.

        <p>Figure 7 displays the distributions of the fitted δ HMXB and δ LMXB , respectively. Both distributions have slightly positive median values, i.e., 0.04 dex (HMXB) and 0.12 dex (LMXB). These near-zero medians indicate that the L X HMXB and L X LMXB scaling relations (Fragos et al. 2013a) are good approximations for the overall galactic population detected in deep X-ray surveys at z  1. The slightly positive trend of the distributions suggests that the scaling relations might have systematic offsets. But the positive trend is expected due to a selection effect, because our X-ray data are flux-limited and thus tend to select higher L X HMXB and L X LMXB sources. A larger normal-galaxy X-ray sample, from, e.g., eROSITA (e.g., Vulic et al. 2021), is needed to investigate the nature of the positive trend of δ HMXB and δ LMXB . Both of the δ HMXB and δ LMXB distributions have substantial scatters (standard deviations ≈0.2 dex; Figure 7).

        <p>We set frac AGN 0.2 in our runs (Table 2) since the sources were classified as normal galaxies by Luo et al. (2017), but this quantitative choice is rather arbitrary. One might worry that our fitting results could heavily depend on the assumption of frac AGN 0.2, as AGNs can also contribute to the observed X-ray fluxes. To assess the effects of this assumption, we perform a new run including higher frac AGN values, i.e., frac AGN = 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6, while keeping the other parameters the same. The resulting δ HMXB and δ LMXB distributions are identical to those in Figure 7, indicating that these two parameters are not strongly degenerate with frac AGN . Figure 8 displays example 2D and 1D probability distributions of frac AGN and δ LMXB from the new fit with frac AGN = 0-0.6. The frac AGN is tightly constrained at a low level (0.01), and the situations are similar for all of our sources. The tight AGN constraints are understandable as the AGN emission is constrained not only by the X-ray data but also by the UV-to-IR data. In summary, we conclude that our Figure 6.

        <p>X-CIGALE adopts a single fixed SED shape of an AGN accretion disk from Schartmann et al. (2005), which is a broken power law. Although the Schartmann et al.

This is because the observed UV/optical slopes of type 1 quasars have non-negligible intrinsic dispersions (e.g., Elvis et al. 1994), possibly due to different black hole (BH) masses, accretion rates, and spins (e.g., Koratkar &amp; Blaes 1999).X-CIGALE adopts a single fixed SED shape of an AGN accretion disk from Schartmann et al.

        <p>We compare the model versus observed uz colors in Figure 9 (right). The model colors agree better with the observed colors than those from the X-CIGALE fits. The median offset of the model and observed uz is close to zero (0.05), while the X-CIGALE fits have a median of 0.15. Also, the scatter has been reduced from 0.24 (X-CIGALE fits) to 0.16 (CIGALE V2022.0 fits). Figure 10 (right) shows an example SED fit.

        <p>Figure 12 displays the distribution of the fitted δ AGN and E(B -V ) PD . The median of the δ AGN distribution is -0.36, with a significant scatter of 0.34. This negative median value could be intrinsic, as the default Schartmann et al. (2005) spectral shape is based on the observed quasar SEDs, without considering polar-dust extinction. Indeed, the polar-dust extinctions are non-negligible [median E(B -V ) PD = 0.03], although heavy extinctions of E(B -V ) PD &gt; 0.1 are rare (6%). However, we note that the degeneracy between δ AGN and E(B -V ) PD (e.g., Figure 11) might also contribute to the negative trend of δ AGN . We caution that both of the δ AGN and E(B -V ) PD distributions quantitatively depend on the adopted specific extinction law. We adopt the default SMC law here, and refer to Buat et al. (2021) for a detailed discussion on the effects of different laws. Given the degeneracy between δ AGN and E(B -V ) PD , one might think of adapting the original disk SED shapes (Schartmann and SKIRTOR;Section 4.3) to the bluest variation in our sample and attributing all observed SED variations to E(B -V ) PD . This idea has the benefit of simplicity, but we do not adopt it for three reasons. First, it is unlikely that all AGNs share the same intrinsic SED shape over wide ranges of BH masses and accretion rates (e.g., Whiting et al. 2001;Richards et al. 2003). Second, the current approach is more flexible than adapting the template, and the philosophy of CIGALE highlights flexibility rather than simplicity. Third, although E(B -V ) PD and δ AGN are degenerate over UV/optical wavelengths, they can be better differentiated given excellent IR coverage, because dustreddened AGNs have polar-dust IR re-emission (included in CIGALE), but intrinsically red AGNs do not. In CIGALE, polar dust is an obscuration structure with an optical depth much smaller than the torus (see Section 2.4 of Yang et al. 2020 for details). CIGALE assumes that the polar-dust IR emission follows a "graybody" model (e.g., Casey 2012) with temperature and emissivity as free parameters. Future IR missions, e.g., the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Origins, will be able to detect (tightly constrain) the polar-dust IR reemission and thereby differentiate the two cases of dustreddened versus intrinsically red SEDs.Figure 12 displays the distribution of the fitted δ AGN and E(B -V ) PD .

        <p>Finally, we stress the importance of our redshift and magnitude cuts (Section 4.2). These cuts guarantee the observed SEDs are dominated by AGNs, allowing us to model the data with pure-AGN templates. Actually, we have tested fits with AGN+galaxy mixed templates by freeing frac AGN , and found our parameters of interest (δ AGN and E(B -V ) PD ) could be significantly affected. This is because a blue observed SED can be either explained by a low-dust star-forming galactic component or an AGN component. Figure 13 displays such an AGN-galaxy degeneracy for an SDSS quasar, for which δ AGN and E(B -V ) PD are strongly affected when a galactic component is allowed. Therefore, our redshift/magnitude cuts and pure-AGN approach are crucial for our investigation of δ AGN and E(B -V ) PD . The user who is interested in these parameters should be cautious of the degeneracy effects when modeling SEDs that have non-negligible galactic components. On the other hand, some studies indicate that some other source properties such as frac AGN , AGN bolometric luminosity (L AGN ), and SFR are not strongly affected by the degeneracy issue, especially when good multiwavelength coverage is available (e.g., Mountrichas et al. 2021c;Yang et al. 2021;Thorne et al. 2022). This is understandable, considering that those properties can be constrained by multiwavelength data simultaneously, e.g., L AGN is related to X-ray, UV/optical, and IR wavelengths. However, in contrast, δ AGN and E(B -V ) PD are very sensitive to the detailed SED-shape modeling at UV/ optical wavelengths, and thus they are more strongly affected by the AGN-galaxy degeneracy than properties like L AGN .Finally, we stress the importance of our redshift and magnitude cuts (Section 4.2).

However, AGNs may have powerful jets that emit strong radio radiation (i.e., radio-loud AGNs), and the jets can play an important role in AGN-galaxy coevolution (e.g., Fabian 2012). The physical origin of AGN radio jets is still controversial. One popular theory is the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process (e.g., Blandford &amp; Znajek 1977;Blandford et al. 2019). The BZ mechanism considers that the jet is powered by the rotational energy of the BH through the magnetic field threading the horizon (e.g., Davis &amp; Tchekhovskoy 2020). Recent observations suggest that the magnetic flux/topology close to the BH instead of the BH spin could be the determining factor of the jet-launching process (e.g., Zhu et al. 2020). Other than the jets, other processes such as AGN winds, coronae, and shocks can also emit at radio wavelengths (e.g., Panessa et al. 2019).X-CIGALE does not have AGN emission at radio wavelengths.

        <p>Similar to the procedures of the previous sections (Sections 2, 3, and 4), we first compile a proper radio-selected sample and then perform SED modeling with X-CIGALE in this section. We adopt all of the &gt;5σ radio detections in the VLA-COSMOS 3 GHz Large Project (Smolčić et al. 2017a(Smolčić et al. , 2017b)). We also collect the VLA 1.4 GHz fluxes when available from Schinnerer et al. (2010). Delvecchio et al. (2017) matched the radio sources to the COSMOS2015 catalog (Laigle et al. 2016). We adopt these matching results and obtain the UV-to-IRAC4 broadband photometry (14 bands) from COSMOS2015. We discard the radio sources without COSMOS2015 counterparts, as the UV-to-IRAC4 data are necessary to model the stellar population. The sample contains 6497 sources in total. We also include Spitzer/MIPS (24 μm), Herschel/PACS (100 μm and 160 μm), and Herschel/SPIRE (250 μm, 350 μm, and 500 μm) photometry from the "super-deblended" catalog of Jin et al. (2018). We do not include X-ray fluxes here due to the reason presented in Section 5.4, i.e., we want to keep our SED fits and subsequent source classifications independent from the X-ray information. We adopt the redshift measurements from Delvecchio et al. (2017), which are spec-z (if available) or photo-z. The median redshift is 1.18, and the 10th-90th percentile range is z = 0.42-2.56.Similar to the procedures of the previous sections (Sections 2, 3, and 4), we first compile a proper radio-selected sample and then perform SED modeling with X-CIGALE in this section.

        <p>We first fit the photometric data above with 
            <rs type="software">X-CIGALE</rs>. The model parameters are listed in Table 4. We set q IR to a range of 2.4-2.7 (step 0.1), based on the observations of Delvecchio et al. (2021). Figures 14 (left) and 15 (left) display the resulting model fluxes versus the observed values for 3 GHz and 1.4 GHz, respectively. The model fluxes are systematically lower than the observed ones, e.g., 28% (11%) of sources have observed 3 GHz fluxes more than three (10) times higher than the model fluxes. In contrast, no sources have model fluxes greater than three times higher than the observed values. This result of "radio excess" strongly indicates that an AGN radio component is needed to explain the observed radio fluxes for many sources (Azadi et al. 2020). Figure 16 (left) shows an example SED fit with significant radio excess.

            <rs type="version">2022.0</rs>, we re-fit the photometric data of the COSMOS radio sources (Section 5.1). We set R AGN to a wide logarithmically spaced grid from 0.01 to 10000 (see Table 4) based on the observations of quasars (e.g., Zhu et al. 2020). We fix the radio slope in Equation (10) at the default value of α AGN = 0.7, as most (73%) of our sources only have one radio band (3 GHz) available.

        <p>Unlike the results from X-CIGALE, the model radio fluxes agree well with the observed fluxes (see Figures 14 and15). The offsets between the model and observed radio fluxes are mostly (99.91% for 3 GHz and 98.6% for 1.4 GHz) within 0.5 dex. Therefore, we conclude that our implementation of the AGN radio component is indeed useful in explaining the observed radio flux, although the good fit of radio data is not surprising given only one (or two) radio band(s) is available for each source in our sample. Interestingly, the model 1.4 GHz fluxes tend to be slightly lower than the observed ones (median offset = 0.08 dex), suggesting that the typical AGN radio SED in the COSMOS sample is steeper than our assumed α AGN = 0.7 (Table 4). However, this systematic offset might also be a selection effect, as the relatively shallow 1.4 GHz data may miss AGNs with flatter radio SEDs and therefore lower 1.4 GHz fluxes.Unlike the results from X-CIGALE, the model radio fluxes agree well with the observed fluxes (see Figures 14 and15).

        <p>Figure 16 compares example SED fits from X-CIGALE and CIGALE V2022.0. The observed radio fluxes are dominated by the AGN component from the CIGALE V2022.0 fit. The X-CIGALE fit is not able to explain the radio fluxes due to the lack of AGN radio emission. Compared to the CIGALE V2022.0 fit, the X-CIGALE fit has a stronger galactic IR component. This is because X-CIGALE only has galactic radio emission, which is related to galactic IR emission through the radio-IR correlation (Section 5.1). The high observed radio flux forcibly elevates not only galactic radio emission but also its IR emission as a consequence.

This definition guarantees that the AGN radio component is statistically significant (&gt;2σ) for the classified radio AGNs. We note that our definition of AGN/SF is based on the radio-band decomposition, because our focus here is radio emission. For example, if a source has AGN features at other wavelengths (e.g., X-ray; see below) but its AGN radio emission is insignificant, it will be classified as a radio SF galaxy here. There are a total of 3221 radio AGNs, 50% of the sample. This high fraction indicates that radio AGNs are common among the sources selected by deep radio surveys. The radio-AGN fraction depends on radio fluxes. The fractions are 47% and 85% for sources with 3 GHz fluxes below and above 0.2 mJy, respectively. This significant radioflux dependence is also found by Smolčić et al. (2017b), who used empirical criteria to classify AGNs and SF galaxies.

        <p>Figure 17 displays R AGN versus P AGN,1.4GHz and their distributions for our radio AGNs (P AGN,1.4GHz /δP AGN,1.4GHz &gt; 2). The red dashed line marks the conventional threshold (i.e., R AGN = 10; Kellermann et al. 1989) for radio-quiet (RQ) versus radio-loud (RL) AGN classifications. The numbers of RQ and RL AGNs are 823 (26%) and 2398 (74%), respectively. We remind the reader that this RQ/RL classification demonstrates an advantage of CIGALE V2022.0, which simultaneously models multiwavelength data in a consistent way (Section 5.3). Such a task is challenging for empirical approaches, because the AGN UV/optical emission is often heavily obscured and not directly observable (e.g., Figure 16). X-ray emission is a good tracer of the BH-accretion process (e.g., Brandt &amp; Alexander 2015;Brandt &amp; Yang 2021). It is intriguing to investigate the X-ray emission of our classified radio types. We adopt the Chandra COSMOS-Legacy survey (Civano et al. 2016;Marchesi et al. 2016).

The uncertainties are negligible compared to the differences across different radio types, thanks to our relatively large sample sizes.Figure 17 displays R AGN versus P AGN,1.4GHz and their distributions for our radio AGNs (P AGN,1.4GHz /δP AGN,1.4GHz &gt; 2).

        <p>The X-ray fraction of the radio AGNs is 1.9 times higher than that of the radio SF. This result indicates that there is a positive link between AGN radio and X-ray emission, broadly consistent with the findings in the literature (e.g., Merloni et al. 2003;Laor &amp; Behar 2008). Among the radio AGNs, the RQ population has a higher X-ray detected fraction than the RL population (Figure 18). This is expected, because RQs should have higher L ν,2500Å than RLs at a given P AGN,1.4GHz (see Equation (9)), and L ν,2500Å is strongly correlated with AGN L X due to the α ox -L ν,2500Å relation (e.g., Steffen et al. 2006;Just et al. 2007). However, the X-ray fraction of the RL AGNs is still significantly higher than that of the radio SF population (13% versus 9%). Assuming that the radio emission in RL AGNs is mainly from jets (Section 5), the elevated X-ray fraction of the RL population suggests a connection between jets and X-ray emission. This connection suggests that AGN jets could actively produce X-rays (e.g., Harris &amp; Krawczynski 2006), or that there is a positive link between jets and the X-ray emitting coronae (e.g., Zhu et al. 2020).The X-ray fraction of the radio AGNs is 1.9 times higher than that of the radio SF.

        <p>1. In X-CIGALE, the α ox parameter (X-ray module) is internally set to -1.9, -1.8, -1.7, ..., -1.1, and the user cannot control it. In CIGALE V2022.0, we change α ox to an explicit parameter that is set by the user, although the default values are still -1.9, -1.8, ..., -1.1.1.

        <p>This change allows the user to run 
            <rs type="software">X-CIGALE</rs> more effectively when using the X-ray module. For example, if the sample consists of luminous quasars that typically have more negative values of α ox (e.g., Just et al. 2007), then the user can set α ox as, e.g., -1.9, -1.8, -1.7, and -1.6. This setting will reduce the number of models by a factor of 2.25, significantly boosting the efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>This update of α ox also allows for the investigations of rare AGNs that have extreme α ox values. For example, the class of X-ray weak quasars can have α ox &lt; -1.9 (e.g., Pu et al. 2020), beyond the fixed α ox parameter grid in X-CIGALE. In

            <rs type="version">2022.0</rs>, the user can adopt α ox more negative than -1.9 to probe the X-ray weak population. 2. In X-CIGALE, the normalization of the AGN component is controlled by the parameter of AGN fraction, defined as
        </p>
        <p>, where L dust, AGN and L dust, galaxy are AGN and galactic dust luminosity (integrated over all wavelengths), respectively. In 
            <rs type="software">CIGALE</rs> V
            <rs type="version">2022.0</rs>, we allow the user to change the definition wavelength (range) of frac AGN by another parameter, "lambda_fracAGN." Setting it to "l l min max " (units: μm) means that frac AGN is defined as
        </p>
        <p>, where L AGN and L galaxy are AGN and galaxy total luminosity (not only dust) integrated over the wavelength range from l min to l max . If l l = min max , then the code will use the monochromatic luminosity at this wavelength. If lambda_fracAGN is set to "0/0" (the default values), then the code will still use the definition of frac AGN in X-CIGALE. This change allows the users to model AGN versus galactic relative strength in their interested wavelengths. 3. X-CIGALE allows three extinction laws for AGN polar dust (i.e., Calzetti et al. 2000, nearby star-forming galaxies; Gaskell et al. 2004, large dust grains;Prevot et al. 1984, Small Magellanic Cloud, SMC). These extinction laws extend to ≈100 nm, below which X- CIGALE adopts analytical extrapolations. These extrapolations lead to large, nonphysical extinctions below 100 nm. This has a direct impact on the models: the dust reprocessing has too much radiation that is re-emitted in the infrared while it dramatically steepens the slope of the accretion-disk emission. In order to address this issue, the extinction curves were recalculated in the entire wavelength range of interest by the module within the SKIRT radiative-transfer code (Baes et al. 2011;Baes &amp; Camps 2015;Camps &amp; Baes 2015) based on the realistic dust mixtures and optical properties taken from the literature. The SMC dust mixture consists of populations of silicate and graphite dust grains. The grain size distribution is taken from Weingartner &amp; Draine (2001): a power-law function with a curvature and an exponential cutoff. Instead of extrapolation, below 100 nm, the Calzetti extinction curve was replaced by the one corresponding to the standard Galactic interstellar dust (Mathis et al. 1977). The Gaskell dust mixture represents a modification of that of the Mathis et al. (1977) consisting of silicate and graphite populations with power-law grain size distribution: the abundance of graphite is lowered to 15%, the power-law exponent is taken to be -2.05, and the maximum grain size is lowered to 0.2 μm. We adopt these new extinction curves below 100 nm for CIGALE V2022.0. In Figure 19 we The observed radio fluxes are much higher than the model ones from X-CIGALE. CIGALE V2022.0 accounts for this radio excess with an AGN radio component. Also, compared to the CIGALE V2022.0 fit, the X-CIGALE fit has a much stronger galactic IR component, because the high observed radio fluxes force an elevated galactic IR emission via q IR (Equation ( 7)). The red data point represents the radio AGN sample (P AGN,1.4GHz / δP AGN,1.4GHz &gt; 2), including both RL and RQ AGNs. The error bars represent binomial uncertainties. The radio AGNs have a higher X-ray detection fraction than the SF galaxies, suggesting a link between AGN radio and X-ray emission., where L AGN and L galaxy are AGN and galaxy total luminosity (not only dust) integrated over the wavelength range from l min to l max . If l l = min max , then the code will use the monochromatic luminosity at this wavelength. If lambda_fracAGN is set to "0/0" (the default values), then the code will still use the definition of frac AGN in X-CIGALE. This change allows the users to model AGN versus galactic relative strength in their interested wavelengths. 3. X-CIGALE allows three extinction laws for AGN polar dust (i.e., Calzetti et al. 2000, nearby star-forming galaxies; Gaskell et al. 2004, large dust grains;Prevot et al. 1984, Small Magellanic Cloud, SMC). These extinction laws extend to ≈100 nm, below which X- CIGALE adopts analytical extrapolations. These extrapolations lead to large, nonphysical extinctions below 100 nm. This has a direct impact on the models: the dust reprocessing has too much radiation that is re-emitted in the infrared while it dramatically steepens the slope of the accretion-disk emission. In order to address this issue, the extinction curves were recalculated in the entire wavelength range of interest by the module within the SKIRT radiative-transfer code (Baes et al. 2011;Baes &amp; Camps 2015;Camps &amp; Baes 2015) based on the realistic dust mixtures and optical properties taken from the literature. The SMC dust mixture consists of populations of silicate and graphite dust grains. The grain size distribution is taken from Weingartner &amp; Draine (2001): a power-law function with a curvature and an exponential cutoff. Instead of extrapolation, below 100 nm, the Calzetti extinction curve was replaced by the one corresponding to the standard Galactic interstellar dust (Mathis et al. 1977). The Gaskell dust mixture represents a modification of that of the Mathis et al. (1977) consisting of silicate and graphite populations with power-law grain size distribution: the abundance of graphite is lowered to 15%, the power-law exponent is taken to be -2.05, and the maximum grain size is lowered to 0.2 μm. We adopt these new extinction curves below 100 nm for CIGALE V2022.0. In Figure 19 we The observed radio fluxes are much higher than the model ones from X-CIGALE. CIGALE V2022.0 accounts for this radio excess with an AGN radio component.

        <p>In this work, we test X-CIGALE on different AGN/galaxy samples and improve the code accordingly. We publicly release the new code as 
            <rs type="software">CIGALE</rs> V
            <rs type="version">2022.0</rs> on 
            <rs type="url">https://cigale.lam.fr</rs>. Our main results are summarized below.
        </p>
        <p>1. The X-CIGALE fits of COSMOS type~2 AGNs produce systematically negative Δα ox , indicating that the observed X-ray fluxes are below the expectations from the isotropic AGN X-ray model. In CIGALE V2022.0, we allow the user to model AGN L X (intrinsic X-ray luminosity) as a second-order polynomial of q cos . We test three different sets of polynomial coefficients, i.e., (a 1 , a 2 ) = (0.5, 0), (1, 0), and (0.33, 0.67), and compare the results with those of the isotropic model. We find that the fits from (a 1 , a 2 ) = (0.5, 0) have the best quality in terms of both Δα ox and ΔAIC. This result indicates that AGN X-ray emission is moderately anisotropic in general (see Section 2). 2. For the CDF-S normal galaxies, the model X-ray fluxes from X-CIGALE do not agree well with the observed fluxes for many sources, e.g., 21% of the sources have offsets &gt;0.5 dex. These offsets reflect the intrinsic scatters of the L X HMXB -SFR and L X LMXB -M å scaling relations for individual galaxies due to, e.g., globular clusters and statistical fluctuations. Therefore, in CIGALE V2022.0, we introduce two new free parameters, δ HMXB and δ LMXB , which are the logarithmic deviations from the default L X HMXB -SFR and L X LMXB -M å scaling relations. We set both parameters from -0.5 to 0.5 with a step of 0.1 and re-fit the sources with 
            <rs type="software">CIGALE</rs> V2022.
            <rs type="version">0</rs>. All of the resulting model fluxes agree with the observed fluxes within ∼0.5 dex. The resulting δ HMXB and δ LMXB distributions both show a slightly positive trend, suggesting a systematic offset of the L X HMXB and L X LMXB scaling relations or an X-ray selection bias (see Section 3). 3. A significant fraction (32%) of SDSS quasars have u-z colors bluer than the model limit (uz = 0.5) of X- CIGALE. We allow the user to adjust the UV/optical slope of the intrinsic-disk model with a δ AGN parameter in CIGALE V2022.0. This change successfully models the observed blue quasar SEDs. The fitted δ AGN has a negative median value (-0.27), suggesting that the typical intrinsic quasar SED might be bluer than the default Schartmann et al. (2005) model. However, the degeneracy between δ AGN and E(B -V ) PD might also contribute to this negative trend (see Section 4). 4. X-CIGALE only accounts for galactic radio emission. It's fits of COSMOS radio sources fail to account for the observed radio ∼3 GHz fluxes in many cases, e.g., 28% of the sources have model fluxes more than 0.5 dex below the observed ones. Therefore, in CIGALE V2022.0, we add an AGN radio power-law component, parameterized by AGN loudness (R AGN ) and power-law slope (α AGN ).
        </p>
        <p>With this AGN component, the model agrees with the observed ∼3 GHz (and 1.4 GHz when available) data point within ∼0.5 dex for most sources. From the fits of CIGALE V2022.0, we find that about half of the radio sources have a significant radio AGN component (as defined by P AGN,1.4GHz /δP AGN,1.4GHz &gt; 2), and we classify the rest as radio SF galaxies. This result suggests that AGN activity is common among sources selected by deep radio surveys. 5. We also implement several miscellaneous updates in 
            <rs type="software">CIGALE</rs> V2022.0. We allow the user to set the AGN α ox grid instead of fixing it. We introduce a new free parameter "lambda_fracAGN," which sets the wavelength range for frac AGN definition. We improve the AGN polar-dust extinction curves at λ  100 nm based on realistic dust mixtures and optical properties taken from the literature. These updates 
            <rs type="software">make</rs> CIGALE V2022.0 more flexible and physical (see Section 6).

        <p>For users without intrinsic X-ray fluxes, it is feasible to estimate the absorption corrections on their own (see, e.g., Section 3.1 ofMountrichas et al. 2021b). To perform this task, users can first use BEHR(Park et al. 2006) to estimate the hardness ratios (HRs) based on hard and soft-band counts, which are often available in X-ray catalogs. They can then input these HR values to PIMMS(Mukai 1993) for the estimations of column density N H and intrinsic fluxes. An alternative approach is to directly adopt the hard-band fluxes without absorption corrections, because hard X-ray photons are penetrating and only modestly affected by absorption in general.
