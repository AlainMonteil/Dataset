        <p>We present the JWST cycle 1 53.8 h medium program FRESCO, short for 'First Reionization Epoch Spectroscopically Complete Observations'. FRESCO co v ers 62 arcmin 2 in each of the two GOODS/CANDELS fields for a total area of 124 arcmin 2 exploiting JWST 's powerful new grism spectroscopic capabilities at near-infrared wavelengths. By obtaining ∼2 h deep NIRCam/grism observations with the F 444 W filter, FRESCO yields unprecedented spectra at R ∼ 1600 co v ering 3.8-5.0 μm for most galaxies in the NIRCam field of view. This setup enables emission line measurements o v er most of cosmic history, from strong PAH lines at z ∼ 0.2-0.5, to Pa α and Pa β at z ∼ 1-3, He I and [S III ] at z ∼ 2.5-4.5, H α and [N II ] at z ∼ 5-6.5, up to [O III ] and H β for z ∼ 7-9 galaxies. FRESCO's grism observations provide total line fluxes for accurately estimating galaxy stellar masses and calibrating slit-loss corrections of NIRSpec/MSA spectra in the same field. Additionally, FRESCO results in a mosaic of F 182 M , F 210 M , and F 444 W imaging in the same fields to a depth of ∼28.2 mag (5 σ in 0 . 32 diameter apertures). Here, we describe the o v erall surv e y design and the key science goals that can be addressed with FRESCO. We also highlight several, early science results, including: spectroscopic redshifts of Lyman break galaxies that were identified almost 20 yr ago, the disco v ery of broad-line active galactic nuclei at z &gt; 4, and resolved Pa α maps of galaxies at z ∼ 1.4. These results demonstrate the enormous power for serendipitous disco v ery of NIRCam/grism observations.We present the JWST cycle 1 53.8 h medium program FRESCO, short for 'First Reionization Epoch Spectroscopically Complete Observations'.

        <p>The most significant shortcoming before the advent of JWST , ho we ver, remained the lack of spectroscopically confirmed redshifts. In particular, studies exploring the earliest galaxies in the epoch of reionization (EoR) with spectroscopy were sparse before JWST due to disappearing Ly α lines in the neutral IGM (e.g. Stark et al. 2010 ;Treu et al. 2013 ;Pentericci et al. 2014 ), and due to low Ly α fractions in general. Consequently, at z &gt; 7, only a handful of luminous galaxies had spectroscopic confirmations, based on Ly α or weak rest-frame UV emission (e.g. Oesch et al. 2015 ;Stark et al. 2017 ), or from ALMA ISM lines (e.g. Inoue et al. 2016 ;Hashimoto et al. MNRAS 525, 2864-2874 (2023) 2018 ; Bakx et al. 2020 ;Bouwens et al. 2022 ;Schouws et al. 2022 ). This caused extra uncertainty given that the inferences on galaxy abundances at high redshift are statistical in nature. The agreement between candidate catalogues from different teams often remained limited, even when based on the same data: &lt; 60 per cent overall, dropping to ∼ 30 per cent at the faint end (e.g. compare catalogues from Bouwens et al. 2015 ;Finkelstein et al. 2015 ). Similarly, blind spectroscopic surv e ys, e.g. with VIMOS or MUSE, up to z ∼ 6 consistently showed that a non-negligible fraction (up to 60 per cent) of genuine high-redshift galaxies can be missed in traditional Lyman Break colour-colour selections due to scatter in their observed colours (e.g. Le F èvre et al. 2015 ;Inami et al. 2017 ).The most significant shortcoming before the advent of JWST , ho we ver, remained the lack of spectroscopically confirmed redshifts.

        <p>With the advent of multiplexed infrared spectroscopy of the JWST , all these issues that plagued the exploration of early galaxies can finally be o v ercome. Already after just a few months of observations with JWST , extremely early galaxy candidates are now identified out to z ∼ 12-16 (e.g. Finkelstein et al. 2022 ;Harikane et al. 2022 ;Naidu et al. 2022 ;Adams et al. 2023 ;Atek et al. 2023 ;Bouwens et al. 2023 ;Donnan et al. 2023 ) and spectroscopically confirmed to z ∼ 13 (e.g. Curtis-Lake et al. 2022 ;Arrabal Haro et al. 2023 ;Bunker et al. 2023 ).

        <p>FRESCO is designed to obtain a spectrum with R ∼ 1600 for every reionization-era galaxy in the field down to ∼0.2-0.5 L * UV , probing the strong rest-frame optical emission lines [O III ] + H β at z = 6.7-9.0 and H α + [N II ] at z = 4.9-6.6, in addition to other emission lines across the full cosmic history. This includes dust-insensitive Paschen lines at z ∼ 1-3, as well as PAH 3.3 μm lines at z &lt; 0.5. Therefore, the FRESCO observations enable accurate measurements of early star formation and stellar mass build up; provide detailed insights into early, low-metallicity star formation; reveal small-scale 3D clustering and measure the contribution of mergers to early galaxy assembly. These key science cases will be discussed in this paper, after first introducing the surv e y design.FRESCO is designed to obtain a spectrum with R ∼ 1600 for every reionization-era galaxy in the field down to ∼0.2-0.5 L * UV , probing the strong rest-frame optical emission lines [O III ] + H β at z = 6.7-9.0 and H α + [N II ] at z = 4.9-6.6, in addition to other emission lines across the full cosmic history.

        <p>The primary goals of FRESCO are to resolve two of the key limitations of our current understanding of the galaxy stellar mass build-up during the epoch of reionization at z &gt; 6: (1) uncertain redshifts and outlier fractions, and (2) unknown emission line contribution to restframe optical broad-band photometry. In the following, we outline the surv e y design to o v ercome these limitations.The primary goals of FRESCO are to resolve two of the key limitations of our current understanding of the galaxy stellar mass build-up during the epoch of reionization at z &gt; 6: (1) uncertain redshifts and outlier fractions, and (2) unknown emission line contribution to restframe optical broad-band photometry.

        <p>The core of FRESCO is NIRCam slitless grism observations, which result in a spectrum for every source in the field of view (see e.g. Sun et al. 2023 ). FRESCO follows in the footsteps of numerous successful grism surv e ys conducted with HST such as 3D-HST (Brammer et al. 2012 ;Momche v a et al. 2016 ), GLASS (Treu et al. 2015 ), FIGS (Pirzkal et al. 2018), CLEAR (Estrada-Carpenter et al. 2019), WISP (Atek et al. 2010 ), and GRAPES (Pirzkal et al. 2004 ), but with greater sensitivity, at longer wavelength, and with spectral resolution a factor 10 × higher. Unlike traditional slit-based spectroscopy that can only target pre-selected sources, slitless spectra ef fecti v ely pro vide a complete sample of emission line selected galaxies. With JWST , the NIRISS instrument provides slitless spectra up to ∼2 μm. The NIRCam camera (Rieke, Kelly &amp; Horner 2005 ;Rieke et al. 2023 ) includes a grism mode at longer wav elengths, pro viding spectra at relatively high resolution, R ∼ 1600, up to 5 μm. In cycle 1, this mode is only used by a few programs, including the GTO/EIGER surv e y (Kashino et al. 2023 ;Matthee et al. 2023b ), as well as the ERS/CEERS program (Finkelstein et al. 2022 ), who are all using the F 356 W filter. As we will sho w belo w, such grism observ ations at 3-5 μm are extremely powerful probes of galaxy build-up across cosmic history.The core of FRESCO is NIRCam slitless grism observations, which result in a spectrum for every source in the field of view (see e.g. Sun et al. 2023 ).

        <p>Grism observations can use the same set of medium and wide filters as NIRCam imaging in its long-wavelength (LW) channel. The choice of filter determines the wavelength range of the spectra. The key redshift range that FRESCO targets is z &gt; 6, i.e. the reionization epoch, where spectroscopic redshifts can be determined from strong rest-optical emission lines such as H α + [N II ] and [O III ] + H β. FRESCO therefore obtains 4-5 μm grism spectra with the F 444 W filter. This setup allows us to probe H α + [N II ] lines for galaxies at z = 4.9-6.6 and [O III ] + H β lines from z = 6.7-9.0. If bright enough, the [O II ] line could in principle even be detected in sources at z = 9.3-12.5. Hence, the F 444 W grism spectra result in near complete co v erage of the epoch of reionization out to some of the most distant galaxies known in the Universe.Grism observations can use the same set of medium and wide filters as NIRCam imaging in its long-wavelength (LW) channel.

        <p>NIRCam is equipped with two different grisms in the LW channel that provide the same spectral resolution, but have a dispersion direction that is rotated by 90 degree relative to each other (GrismR and GrismC). FRESCO is using only one of them: GrismR. The advantages of taking data with both grisms are a better handle on contamination along the dispersion direction and unambiguous identification of sources in the direct image from which the spectra originate. Unfortunately, using GrismC results in a disproportionate increase of o v erheads, giv en that out-of-field images need to be taken at 35 arcsec offsets, which results in separate visits. As an example, if both GrismC and GrismR were used, FRESCO's surv e y time would have increased by 15 h ( ∼30 per cent) without any gain in sensitivity. Even with only one grism observation, most shortcomings can be mitigated, as demonstrated by the extremely successful HST grism surv e y 3D-HST , from which the community has built e xtensiv e experience to deal with o v erlapping spectra (Brammer et al. 2012 ). Due to these e xcessiv e o v erhead costs, FRESCO is obtained with GrismR observations only, similarly to the GTO/EIGER surv e y (GTO-1243; PI Lilly).NIRCam is equipped with two different grisms in the LW channel that provide the same spectral resolution, but have a dispersion direction that is rotated by 90 degree relative to each other (GrismR and GrismC).

        <p>The wavelength coverage of the NIRCam/grism depends on the location of the source on the detector. At a wavelengths of 3.95 μm, the F 444 W grism and the direct image coincide. Ho we ver, at other wavelengths, the positions are shifted by 9.85 Å per pixel, varying only slightly across the field. This means that only a certain fraction of sources from the direct image will obtain complete spectral co v erage.The wavelength coverage of the NIRCam/grism depends on the location of the source on the detector.

        <p>FRESCO is designed to reach a 5 σ emission-line sensitivity for NIR-Cam/grism observations of ∼2 × 10 -18 erg s -1 cm -2 (for compact sources), which is the expected [O III ]5008 flux of sources at 1 mag below L at z = 7-9 (based on the LF derived from De Barros et al. 2019 ; see also Matthee et al. 2023b ). This is achieved with eight grism exposures of 880s taken with the MEDIUM2 readout mode with 9 groups for each pointing. This results in a total grism exposure time of 7043 s at each position (see also Table 2 ). Four large scale dithers are used, but no sub-pixel dithering. The grism exposures are taken in two sets of these four-point dithers, in each set using a different short-wavelength filter for imaging (see Section 2.2 ).

        <p>Simultaneous with the grism spectra, FRESCO obtains NIRCam medium band images in two short-wavelength filters ( F 182 M and F 210 M ) to extend the space-based legacy data in these fields to 1.8 and 2.1 μm down to 28.3 mag (at 5 σ ). These medium-band filters seamlessly extend the NIR wav elength co v erage of the HST data in the CANDELS/Deep area, complementing the GTO/JADES NIRCam imaging. These data impro v e the UV spectral slope measurement of z &gt; 7 galaxies and, at lower redshift, allow the community to push rest-frame optical imaging analyses beyond the peak of cosmic star formation, from z ∼ 2.5 to beyond z ∼ 4.Simultaneous with the grism spectra, FRESCO obtains NIRCam medium band images in two short-wavelength filters ( F 182 M and F 210 M ) to extend the space-based legacy data in these fields to 1.8 and 2.1 μm down to 28.3 mag (at 5 σ ).

Despite enormous efforts, the galaxies in the EoR have eluded almost all attempts at spectroscopic characterization before JWST , apart from a handful of especially bright (or lensed) galaxies. Only two dozen 'normal' galaxies had confirmed spectroscopic redshifts at z &gt; 7, out of more than 2000 candidates that were known from prime extragalactic HST legacy fields alone (Fig. 2 ; e.g. Bouwens et al. 2015 ;Finkelstein et al. 2015 ;Atek et al. 2018 ). The main reason for this difficulty was that the primary line for redshift confirmations, Ly α, is severely attenuated at z &gt; 6 due to absorption in the largely neutral intergalactic medium (e.g. Dijkstra 2014 ; Mason et al. 2018 ).

        <p>From HST + Spitzer observations, it has been known for several years that the emission line strengths of [O III ] or H α are rapidly increasing towards higher redshift (e.g. Schaerer &amp; de Barros 2010 ;Fumagalli et al. 2012 ;Labb é et al. 2013 ), resulting in observed-frame equi v alent widths that are &gt; 5000 Å on average (e.g. Smit et al. 2014 ;Roberts-Borsani et al. 2016 ;De Barros et al. 2019 ;Endsley et al. 2021 ). This evolution has dramatic consequences for stellar mass estimates that can remain uncertain by factors up to 5-10 × (Fig. 5 ) -a problem that still applies to NIRCam imaging. Bisigello et al. ( 2019 ) estimate median correction factors up to 0.87 dex, if strong emission lines are not accounted for. FRESCO provides emission line measurements for all sources in the field, enabling precise corrections of the broad-band fluxes for emission line contamination on a source-by-source basis. A prominent example is shown in Fig. 5 . The source in question still has one of the most distant Ly α detections at z Ly α = 7.5 (Finkelstein et al. 2013 ;Jung et al. 2020 ). Thanks to this, it was clear that the excess in the IRAC 4.5-μm band was due to strong rest-frame optical emission lines. Nevertheless, the strength of these lines was uncertain.

FRESCO thus has the capability to provide promising, extremely metal-poor candidates for future NIRSpec follow-up. At z ∼ 4.9-6.6, FRESCO continues to trace the build-up of metals through [N II ]/H α line ratios in order to constrain the mass-metallicity relations and models of early chemical enrichment.

        <p>Star formation rate (SFR) is a fundamental observable property of galaxies that is required to trace the growth and formation of galaxies throughout cosmic time. Gold standard SFR indicators are hydrogen recombination lines, as they emerge from H II regions around the most massive and recently born stars and, hence, trace the almostinstantaneous SFR in galaxies (Kennicutt &amp; Evans 2012 ). Aside from Ly α, which suffers from uncertainties associated with resonant scattering, Balmer optical lines, such as H α and H β are the bright H lines and good tracers of star formation acti vity. Ho we ver, these lines are highly affected by dust attenuation, and the uncertainties associated with their attenuation correction factors (e.g. uncertainties in the nebular reddening measurements and attenuation curve assumptions) hamper their potential as accurate SFR diagnostics (e.g. . FRESCO is designed to return a complete sample of star-forming galaxies based on emission lines across the majority of cosmic history. FRESCO 4-5 μm spectra (a) directly constrain the debated accelerated evolution of the star formation rate density at z &gt; 8 based on [O III ] + H β samples at z = 6.9-9.0; (b) follow galaxy build-up through the reionization epoch with H α + [N II ] measurements at z = 4.9-6.6; and (c) probe the peak of cosmic SF ( z ∼ 1-3) through dust-insensitive Pa α and Pa β maps.

Aside from Ly α, which suffers from uncertainties associated with resonant scattering, Balmer optical lines, such as H α and H β are the bright H lines and good tracers of star formation acti vity. Ho we ver, these lines are highly affected by dust attenuation, and the uncertainties associated with their attenuation correction factors (e.g. uncertainties in the nebular reddening measurements and attenuation curve assumptions) hamper their potential as accurate SFR diagnostics (e.g. . FRESCO is designed to return a complete sample of star-forming galaxies based on emission lines across the majority of cosmic history. FRESCO 4-5 μm spectra (a) directly constrain the debated accelerated evolution of the star formation rate density at z &gt; 8 based on [O III ] + H β samples at z = 6.9-9.0; (b) follow galaxy build-up through the reionization epoch with H α + [N II ] measurements at z = 4.9-6.6; and (c) probe the peak of cosmic SF ( z ∼ 1-3) through dust-insensitive Pa α and Pa β maps.

P a α, on the other hand, is an instantaneous and dust-insensitive SFR indicator, owing to its longer wavelength, making it an important SFR diagnostic, particularly in dusty starforming galaxies at the peak epoch of cosmic star formation history. FRESCO takes advantage of the unprecedented near-IR capabilities of JWST to observe Paschen lines (Pa α and Pa β) and trace optically thick star formation in large samples of galaxies at z ∼ 1-3, which is typically missed in optical surv e ys (see also Finkelstein et al. 2011 ;Cleri et al. 2022 ;Reddy et al. 2023 ). Another tracer of obscured star formation activity that is accessible to FRESCO is the 3.3 μm feature at z ࣠ 0.5, which is the emission from PAH dust grains (see e.g. Genzel &amp; Cesarsky 2000 ;Kim et al. 2012 ).2018 , among man y more).

        <p>A unique feature of grism observations is that they result in spatially resolved maps of emission lines and hence star formation. For instance, H α maps from HST grism observations of z ∼ 1-2 galaxies have been used to reveal star-forming clumps and centrally suppressed star formation in massive galaxies, consistent with insideout growth (e.g. Wuyts et al. 2013 ;Nelson et al. 2016 ). This appears to hold, even when accounting for dust gradients inferred from resolved broad-band colours or stacked Balmer decrements (e.g. Tacchella et al. 2018 ). Ho we ver, ALMA observ ations of the 870 μm dust-continuum emission show a different picture: the dust continuum in many massive galaxies is centrally concentrated (Tadaki et al. 2020 ). These observations support a different scenario, in which violent dissipative events fuel nuclear star formation. Given the uncertainties in H α dust corrections and complications in the interpretation of the dust-continuum emission (e.g. due to different heating mechanisms, dust temperature gradients, insensitivity to diffuse emission), an instantaneous and dust-insensitive tracer of star formation is critically needed. FRESCO provides exactly this, with spatially resolved measurements of the Paschen series lines at z ∼ 1-3. These measurements allow us to finally answer the question: do massive galaxies at cosmic noon form their last stars in their centres or in their outskirts before they quench?A unique feature of grism observations is that they result in spatially resolved maps of emission lines and hence star formation.

        <p>A first example of a resolved Pa α map in the FRESCO-S field is shown in Fig. 9 . The grizli -generated Pa α map indeed reveals a very compact star-forming core for this galaxy that is completely absent in the shorter wavelength imaging. This is embedded in more extended star formation throughout the galaxy.

        <p>At z &gt; 5, galaxies are rapidly assembling, resulting in highly complex interstellar media, as demonstrated by ALMA observations of EoR galaxies, where spatial offsets between the rest-UV continuum, and different ISM lines such as [C II ] or [O III ] 88 μm are common (e.g. Maiolino et al. 2015 ;Carniani et al. 2017 ). FRESCO provides detailed H α (H β) maps of a large sample of galaxies at z = 4.9-6.6 ( z = 6.7-9.0) to constrain how and where within galaxies stars are forming during the epoch of reionization (for first examples see the EIGER program Matthee et al. 2023b ). Comparisons between H α and rest-optical continuum sizes provide a first test of insideout growth during an epoch when galaxies are still assemblingrather than fully settled in -(cold) discs, or may reveal homologous growth with a similar pace of stellar build-up across all radii.At z &gt; 5, galaxies are rapidly assembling, resulting in highly complex interstellar media, as demonstrated by ALMA observations of EoR galaxies, where spatial offsets between the rest-UV continuum, and different ISM lines such as [C II ] or [O III ] 88 μm are common (e.g. Maiolino et al. 2015 ;Carniani et al. 2017 ).

        <p>Over the past few years it has become more and more clear that HST -based surv e ys hav e been missing a potentially important population of massive, star-forming galaxies at z &gt; 3 that are sufficiently obscured such that they remained undetected at rest-UV wavelengths (e.g. Caputi et al. 2015 ;Franco et al. 2018 ;Alcalde P amplie ga et al. 2019 ;Wang et al. 2019 ;Fudamoto et al. 2021 ;Xiao et al. 2023 ).

With JWST we can now finally probe the rest-frame optical wavelengths up to z ∼ 9, which brings this optically faint galaxy population into view (e.g. Barrufet et al. 2023 ;P érez-Gonz ález et al. 2023 ;Rodighiero et al. 2023 ). FRESCO's imaging and spectroscopy is especially powerful to characterize this enigmatic population of galaxies. The grism spectra enable -for the first time -to obtain spectroscopic redshifts for such galaxies thanks to emission line searches.

        <p>At z &lt; 2, the massive galaxy population is dominated by dead, quiescent galaxies, with no significant ongoing star formation (e.g. Muzzin et al. 2013 ;Davidzon et al. 2017 ). Ho we ver, it is still unknown when such quiescent galaxies first appeared in the Universe. Deep ground-based K -band surv e ys demonstrated that quiescent galaxies existed since z ∼ 4, ho we v er, their e xact number densities remain debated (Straatman et al. 2015 ;Davidzon et al. 2017 ;Forrest et al. 2020 ;Valentino et al. 2020 ), mainly because HST -based surv e ys are limited to rest-frame optical observations at z &lt; 2.5.

        <p>This paper provided an overview of the medium program FRESCO -a NIRCam grism spectroscopy and imaging surv e y of two fields in the GOODS-North and -South fields, respectively. The power of NIRCam/grism observations are clearly demonstrated with this surv e y: the grism provides R ∼ 1600 spectroscopy of all sources in the field of view in its LW channel, while imaging is obtained in a short-wavelength filter at the same time. Adopting this strategy with the F 444 W filter, FRESCO obtained deep spectra co v ering 3.8-5.0 μm, reaching average line sensitivities of 2 × 10 -18 erg s -1 cm -2 (5 σ ). At the same time, deep F 182 M and F 210 M images are obtained reaching ∼28.2 mag rms (5 σ in 0 . 32 diameter apertures), together with F 444 W direct images reaching similar depth. The FRESCO observations thus significantly enhance the rich ancillary data set in these ke y le gac y fields, enabling a vast amount of science by the community. The spectral co v erage allows one to probe emission line galaxies across almost the full cosmic history. We have highlighted a few science cases, that showcase the enormous power for serendipitous disco v ery of such NIRCam/grism observations. Future, widerarea grism programs would thus be able to obtain large, complete samples of rare classes of galaxies that will be very difficult to followup, e.g. with NIRSpec spectroscopy through targeted programs. We hope that the community will use the FRESCO data set for a large number of scientific disco v eries as well as inspiration for many further JWST programs, including NIRCam/grism observations.This paper provided an overview of the medium program FRESCO -a NIRCam grism spectroscopy and imaging surv e y of two fields in the GOODS-North and -South fields, respectively.
