        <p>Thanks to remarkable discoveries by a number of neutrino oscillation experiments it is now an established fact that neutrinos have mass and leptonic flavors are not symmetries of Nature [1,2]. Historically neutrino oscillations were first observed in the disappearance of solar ν e 's and atmospheric ν μ 's which could be interpreted as flavor oscillations with two very different wavelengths. Over the last 15 years, these effects were confirmed also with terrestrial experiments using man made beams from accelerators and nuclear reactors (see Ref. [3] for an overview).

        <p>These results imply that neutrinos are massive and there is physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). The fundamental question arises, what is the underlying theory for neutrino masses.

        <p>The SM is a gauge theory based on the gauge symmetry SU(3) C × SU(2) L × U(1) Y spontaneously broken to SU(3) C × U (1) EM by the vacuum expectation value of a Higgs doublet field φ. The SM contains three fermion generations which reside in chiral representations of the gauge group. Right-handed fields are included for charged fermions as they are needed to build the electromagnetic and strong currents. However, no right-handed neutrinos are included in the model since neutrinos are neutral and colorless and therefore the right-handed neutrinos are singlets of the SM group.The SM is a gauge theory based on the gauge symmetry SU(3) C × SU(2) L × U(1) Y spontaneously broken to SU(3) C × U (1) EM by the vacuum expectation value of a Higgs doublet field φ.

        <p>Furthermore, within the SM G global SM = U(1) B × U(1) e × U(1) μ × U (1) τ is an accidental global symmetry. Here U(1) B is the baryon number symmetry, and U(1) e,μ,τ are the three lepton flavor symmetries. Any neutrino mass term which could be built with the particle content of the SM would violate the U(1) L subgroup of G global SM and therefore cannot be induced by loop corrections. Also, it cannot be induced by non-perturbative corrections because the U(1) B-L subgroup of G global SM is non-anomalous. It follows then that the SM predicts that neutrinos are strictly massless. Consequently, there is neither mixing nor CP violation in the leptonic sector. Clearly this is in contradiction with the neutrino data summarized above. So the Standard Model has to be extended at least to include neutrino masses. This minimal extension is what we call the New Minimal Standard Model (NMSM).Furthermore, within the SM G global SM = U(1) B × U(1) e × U(1) μ × U (1) τ is an accidental global symmetry.

        <p>Either way, in the NMSM flavor is mixed in the CC interactions of the leptons, and a leptonic mixing matrix appears analogous to the CKM matrix for the quarks. However the discussion of leptonic mixing is complicated by two factors. First the number massive neutrinos (n) is unknown, since there are no constraints on the number of right-handed (SM-singlet) neutrinos. Second, since neutrinos carry neither color nor electromagnetic charge, they could be Majorana fermions. As a consequence the number of new parameters in the model depends on the number of massive neutrino states and on whether they are Dirac or Majorana particles.Either way, in the NMSM flavor is mixed in the CC interactions of the leptons, and a leptonic mixing matrix appears analogous to the CKM matrix for the quarks.

        <p>The wealth of data listed in the introduction can be consistently described by assuming mixing among the three known neutrinos (ν e , ν μ , ν τ ), which can be expressed as quantum superpositions of three massive states ν i (i = 1, 2, 3) with masses m i .

        <p>As it is customary we refer to the first option, Eq. ( 5), as Normal Ordering (NO), and to the second one, Eq. ( 6), as Inverted Ordering (IO); in this form they correspond to the two possible choices of the sign of m 2 31 . In this convention the angles θ ij can be taken without loss of generality to lie in the first quadrant, θ ij ∈ [0, π/2], and the CP phase δ CP ∈ [0, 2π ]. In the following we adopt the (arbitrary) convention of reporting results for m 2 31 for NO and m 2 32 for IO, i.e., we always use the one which has the larger absolute value. Sometimes we will generically denote such quantity as m 2 3 , with = 1 for NO and = 2 for IO. In summary, the 3ν oscillation analysis of the existing data involves six parameters: 2 mass differences (one of which can be positive or negative), 3 mixing angles, and the CP phase δ CP . For the sake of clarity we summarize in Table 1 which experiment contribute dominantly to the present determination of the different parameters. The consistent determination of these leptonic parameters requires a global analysis of the data described above. Such global fits are presently performed by a few phenomenological groups [25][26][27]; here we summarize the results from Ref. [27] corresponding nu-fit version 2.0 [28]. Detailed information about the used data can be found in Refs. [27,28]. Results presented here do not include first data from NOvA [29,30], T2K antineutrino data [31], nor atmospheric neutrino oscillation results from IceCube DeepCore [32].

        <p>We show in Fig. 1 the one-dimensional projections of the χ 2 of the global analysis as a function of each of the six parameters. The corresponding best fit values and the derived ranges for the six parameters at the 1σ (3σ ) level are given in Table 2. For each parameter the curves and ranges are obtained after marginalizing with respect to the other five parameters. The results in the table are shown for three scenarios. In the first and second columns we assume that the ordering of the neutrino mass states is known "a priori" to be Normal or Inverted, respectively, so the ranges of all parameters are defined with respect to the minimum in the given scenario. In the third column we make no assumptions on the ordering, so in this case the parameter ranges are defined with respect to the global minimum (which corresponds to Inverted Ordering) and are obtained marginalizing also over the ordering. For this third case we only give the 3σ intervals. Of course in this case the range of m 2 3 is composed of two disconnected intervals, one containing the absolute minimum (IO) and the other the secondary local minimum (NO).We show in Fig. 1 the one-dimensional projections of the χ 2 of the global analysis as a function of each of the six parameters.

        <p>As already mentioned, all the data described above can be consistently interpreted as oscillations of the three known active neutrinos. In addition to these data, however, several anomalies at short baselines (SBL) have been observed which cannot be explained as 3ν oscillations, but could be interpreted as oscillations involving an O(eV) mass sterile state. They will be discussed in detail in Sec. 4. For what concerns the analysis presented here the only SBL effect which has to be taken into account is the so called reactor anomaly. It turns out that the most recent reactor Table 2 Three-flavor oscillation parameters from our fit to global data after the NOW 2014 conference [27]. The results are presented for the "Free Fluxes + RSBL" in which reactor fluxes have been left free in the fit and short baseline reactor data (RSBL) with L 100 m are included. The numbers in the 1st (2nd) column are obtained assuming NO (IO), i.e., relative to the respective local minimum, whereas in the 3rd column we minimize also with respect to the ordering. Note that m 2 3 ≡ m flux calculations [33,34] fall short at describing the results from reactor experiments at baselines 100 m, such as Bugey4 [35], ROVNO4 [36], Bugey3 [37], Krasnoyarsk [38,39], ILL [40], Gösgen [41], SRP [42], and ROVNO88 [43]. Such reactor short-baseline experiments (RSBL) do not contribute to oscillation physics in the 3ν framework, but they play an important role in constraining the unoscillated reactor neutrino flux if they are used instead of the theoretically calculated reactor fluxes. Thus to account for the possible effect of the reactor anomaly in the determined ranges of neutrino parameters we show the results in Fig. 1 for two extreme choices. The first option (labeled "Free+RSBL") is to leave the normalization of reactor fluxes free and include the RSBL data. The second option (labeled "Huber") is not to include short-baseline reactor data but assume reactor fluxes and uncertainties as predicted in [34].As already mentioned, all the data described above can be consistently interpreted as oscillations of the three known active neutrinos.

There is no CP violation in 3 + 1 SBL oscillations and those relations apply for neutrinos as well as antineutrinos. Neglecting quadratic terms in the mixing matrix elements one has the following relation between the effective amplitudes relevant for appearance and disappearance probabilities: 4 sin 2 2θ μe ≈ sin 2 2θ ee sin 2 2θ μμ . (15) Dividing the relevant data into ν e disappearance, ν μ disappearance, and ν μ → ν e appearance searches, this relation implies that the system is over-constrained. Indeed, as will be discussed below, there is significant tension in the global data and Eq. ( 15) makes it difficult to obtain a good fit to all available data. We consider first the global data including SBL anomalies related to νe and ν e disappearance (reactor and Gallium anomalies) but ignoring for the time being the ν μ → ν e and νμ → νe appearance anomalies (LSND and MiniBooNE). In this case the relevant SBL phenomenology is determined by the two parameters m 2 41 and |U e4 |. The allowed regions for them is shown in Fig. 4.

        <p>We now address the question whether the hints for ν e disappearance can be reconciled with the appearance hints from LSND and MiniBooNE. As mentioned above, Eq. ( 15) links those appearance signals to disappearance in the ν e as well as ν μ channels. Despite the possible signal in ν e disappearance, so-far no positive signal has been observed in ν μ disappearance and several experiments set bounds on the relevant mixing parameter |U μ4 |, see Fig. 5 (left). Hence, the Fig. 4. Allowed regions at 95% CL (2 dof) for 3 + 1 oscillations.

The regions for disappearance data, however, are not closed in this projection in the parameter space and include sin 2 2θ μe = 4|U e4 U μ4 | 2 = 0, which can always be achieved by letting U μ4 → 0 due to the non-observation of any positive signal in SBL ν μ disappearance.

The new qualitative feature in those 5-neutrino schemes is CP violation at the E/L ∼ eV 2 scale [76,77], which introduces some freedom in fitting neutrino versus anti-neutrino data from LSND and MiniBooNE together. However, the main prediction from the 4-neutrino case remains valid also for 5-neutrinos: a non-zero ν μ → ν e appearance at SBL necessarily predicts SBL disappearance for ν e as well as ν μ . Indeed, the tension between appearance and disappearance data remains severe, and a PG analysis gives a consistency below 10 -4 for 3 + 2, whereas for 1 + 3 + 1 consistency at the 2 permil level can be achieved [58].A valid question to ask is whether the situation improves if more neutrino states at the eV scale are introduced.

        <p>It is important to notice that in writing the phenomenological Lagrangian in Eq. ( 18) one assumes that the new physics which induces the NSI operators does not introduce new charge lepton physics at tree level or that charge lepton effects are very suppressed compared to those of neutrinos. This constraints the new physics realizations of this scenario [89] and, generically, the size of the NSI couplings which can be generated.It is important to notice that in writing the phenomenological Lagrangian in Eq.

        <p>Thanks to the remarkable discoveries by neutrino oscillation experiments, such us those awarded by 2015 Nobel prize, it is now an established fact that neutrinos have mass and leptonic flavors are not symmetries of Nature. These results represent, to this date, the only laboratory evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model.Thanks to the remarkable discoveries by neutrino oscillation experiments, such us those awarded by 2015 Nobel prize, it is now an established fact that neutrinos have mass and leptonic flavors are not symmetries of Nature.

        <p>In this contribution we have summarized some results on the present characterization of the low energy parametrization of the neutrino properties as obtained from direct comparison with the data. The relevance of the work lies on the fact that the determination of the flavor structure of the leptons at low energies, is, at this point, our only source of information to understand the underlying new dynamics and it is fundamental to ultimately establish the New Standard Model.In this contribution we have summarized some results on the present characterization of the low energy parametrization of the neutrino properties as obtained from direct comparison with the data.
