        <p>We know now from radial velocity surveys and transit space missions that planets only a few times more massive than our Earth are frequent around solar-type stars. Fundamental questions about their formation history, physical properties, internal structure, and atmosphere composition are, however, still to be solved. We present here the detection of a system of four low-mass planets around the bright (V = 5.5) and close-by (6.5 pc) star HD 219134. This is the first result of the Rocky Planet Search programme with HARPS-N on the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo in La Palma. The inner planet orbits the star in 3.0935 ± 0.0003 days, on a quasicircular orbit with a semi-major axis of 0.0382 ± 0.0003 AU. Spitzer observations allowed us to detect the transit of the planet in front of the star making HD 219134 b the nearest known transiting planet to date. From the amplitude of the radial velocity variation (2.25 ± 0.22 ms -1 ) and observed depth of the transit (359 ± 38 ppm), the planet mass and radius are estimated to be 4.36 ± 0.44 M ⊕ and 1.606 ± 0.086 R ⊕ , leading to a mean density of 5.76 ± 1.09 g cm -3 , suggesting a rocky composition. One additional planet with minimum-mass of 2.78 ± 0.65 M ⊕ moves on a close-in, quasi-circular orbit with a period of 6.767 ± 0.004 days. The third planet in the system has a period of 46.66 ± 0.08 days and a minimum-mass of 8.94 ± 1.13 M ⊕ , at 0.233 ± 0.002 AU from the star. Its eccentricity is 0.46 ± 0.11. The period of this planet is close to the rotational period of the star estimated from variations of activity indicators (42.3 ± 0.1 days). The planetary origin of the signal is, however, the preferred solution as no indication of variation at the corresponding frequency is observed for activity-sensitive parameters. Finally, a fourth additional longer-period planet of mass of 71 M ⊕ orbits the star in 1842 days, on an eccentric orbit (e = 0.34 ± 0.17) at a distance of 2.56 AU.We know now from radial velocity surveys and transit space missions that planets only a few times more massive than our Earth are frequent around solar-type stars.

        <p>The statistical analysis and occurrence rate of the small-mass planets in the range of super-Earth to Neptune are discussed in several studies with the main motivation of better understanding the orbital and physical characteristics of this population of planets, in order to constrain their formation processes (Mordasini et al. 2012;Benz et al. 2014). The radial velocity planet search Article published by EDP Sciences A72, page 1 of 12 A&amp;A 584, A72 (2015) programme with the HARPS spectrograph on the ESO 3.6-m telescope (Mayor et al. 2003(Mayor et al. , 2011)), a similar survey with the Keck telescope (Howard et al. 2010), and the NASA Kepler transit space mission (Borucki et al. 2011) have contributed tremendously to our knowledge of the population of small-mass/size planets around solar-type stars.The statistical analysis and occurrence rate of the small-mass planets in the range of super-Earth to Neptune are discussed in several studies with the main motivation of better understanding the orbital and physical characteristics of this population of planets, in order to constrain their formation processes (Mordasini et al. 2012;Benz et al. 2014).

        <p>The most common planets detected by the Kepler mission peak around 2 R ⊕ (Howard et al. 2012;Fressin et al. 2013;Marcy et al. 2014). Even if such planets do not exist in our solar system, they are found around more than 30% of solar-type hosts. Furthermore, many of them are found in coplanar multiple systems (Fabrycky et al. 2014;Howard et al. 2012;Figueira et al. 2012), tightly packed close to the central star, a new challenge for planet formation models to explain (Ogihara et al. 2015). Over the last 12 years the extra-solar planet zoo has also been supplied with low-mass planets detected by the HARPS GTO planet search programme and successive subsequent ESO Large programmes. Notable examples include HD 40307 (Mayor et al. 2009), HD 10180 (Lovis et al. 2011b), HD 20794, and HD 85512 (Pepe et al. 2011), or Alpha Cen B (Dumusque et al. 2012). Analysis of the results by Mayor et al. (2011) provided a list of additional super-Earth and mini-Neptunes unveiled by the survey, as well as a first statistical analysis of the properties and occurrence rates of the super-Earths and Neptune-mass planets around solar-type stars. These preliminary findings were confirmed by the excellent statistics and precision of the Kepler detections (Fressin et al. 2013).The most common planets detected by the Kepler mission peak around 2 R ⊕ (Howard et al. 2012;Fressin et al. 2013;Marcy et al. 2014).

        <p>After a decade focusing mainly on the detection and the determination of the occurrence rate of low-mass planets, a significant observational effort is now dedicated to planet characterization. Transit results provide the planets radii and in combination with radial velocities, the mean densities of the planets can be derived. Spectral features of exoplanet atmospheres may also be revealed by space and ground-based high-resolution transmission spectroscopy in the visible and near-infrared. One of the main difficulties of such characterization is the availability of bright targets favourable for follow-up observations. In particular, the determination of exquisite planetary physical parameters will be key to lifting the intrinsic degeneracy in the determination of planet composition when several components (gas, silicates, metals) and chemical species are mixed in the planet interior. This was a strong driver for transit search follow-up of super-Earths detected with radial velocities around very bright stars from space with the MOST, Hubble, or Spitzer space telescopes (Gillon et al. 2012(Gillon et al. , 2010;;Demory et al. 2015a), and for the development of a new generation of space transit missions to be launched within the coming decade: CHEOPS/ESA (Fortier et al. 2014), TESS/NASA (Ricker et al. 2014), and PLATO/ESA (Rauer et al. 2014).After a decade focusing mainly on the detection and the determination of the occurrence rate of low-mass planets, a significant observational effort is now dedicated to planet characterization.

        <p>In order to start to fulfil the need for good estimates of planet physical parameters and considering the successful achievements with HARPS, a similar design has been implemented for the HARPS-N spectrograph. The instrument was built to become an efficient exoplanet hunter in the northern hemisphere, specifically aimed at the follow-up and characterization of the brightest transit candidates from the Kepler mission. HARPS-N is a high-precision echelle spectrograph located at the 3.6 m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on La Palma, Spain. It was built by an international consortium of Swiss, Italian, UK, and US partners, led by Geneva university. It began operations in August 2012. Eighty nights per year for five years were granted to the consortium for a science programme including the follow-up of Kepler candidates at high precision, and an additional survey, the Rocky Planet Search (RPS), to search for small planets around bright and quiet nearby stars in the northern hemisphere when the Kepler field is down.In order to start to fulfil the need for good estimates of planet physical parameters and considering the successful achievements with HARPS, a similar design has been implemented for the HARPS-N spectrograph.

        <p>While waiting for the new generation of ground-and spacebased transit searches targeting bright stars, planet density estimates from the follow-up of the Kepler candidates with HARPS-N have already been presented in several papers (Pepe et al. 2013;Dumusque et al. 2014;Bonomo et al. 2014;Dressing et al. 2015). They are populating the low-radius regime of the mass-radius relation for small exoplanets with candidates for which precise mass and radius could be determined.While waiting for the new generation of ground-and spacebased transit searches targeting bright stars, planet density estimates from the follow-up of the Kepler candidates with HARPS-N have already been presented in several papers (Pepe et al. 2013;Dumusque et al. 2014;Bonomo et al. 2014;Dressing et al. 2015).

        <p>In this paper we present the first results from the Rocky Planet Search: a planetary system around HD 219134, composed of three inner super-Earths and an outer sub-Saturn mass planet, with the four planets spread between 0.038 and 2 AU from the central star. Thanks to the high-precision photometric observations from the Spitzer space telescope, the inner planet is observed to transit in front of the star. After a short presentation of the Rocky Planet Search programme in Sect. 2, and the stellar properties of HD 219134 in Sect. 3, the spectroscopic and photometric observations of the new system are described in Sects. 4 and 5. Section 6 provides a discussion of the stability of the system and of the composition of the inner planet.

        <p>The guaranteed time observation (GTO) granted to the HARPS-N consortium is dedicated to two programmes: i) the confirmation of the planetary nature and the characterization of Kepler candidates and ii) a rocky planet search (RPS). The aim of the RPS programme is to perform a systematic search for lowmass planets around nearby quiet stars visible from the northern hemisphere through an intensive monitoring of the radial velocity of quiet stars at very high precision. HARPS-N is stabilized and well-controlled in pressure and temperature to minimize instrumental drifts, and so to secure sub-m/s radial velocities over long periods of time. More details on the technical aspects are presented in Cosentino et al. (2012Cosentino et al. ( , 2014)).The guaranteed time observation (GTO) granted to the HARPS-N consortium is dedicated to two programmes: i) the confirmation of the planetary nature and the characterization of Kepler candidates and ii) a rocky planet search (RPS).

        <p>The sample: the first step in establishing the RPS programme was to select a sample of stars best suited for long-term precise radial velocity measurements. Uncertainties in such observations are mainly linked to noise from three different origins: photon noise, instrumental noise, and stellar intrinsic signals. The first important criterion for this programme was thus to concentrate on bright stars in our closest neighbourhood. This is also in the interest of potential follow-up studies for the characterization of the planet properties. The sample was thus selected from the H catalogue within a distance limit set to 18 pc1 . The second step was to focus on quiet stars. Based on the CORAVEL data and investigation in the literature, we rejected known spectroscopic binaries as well as stars with V sin i ≥ 4.5 kms -1 and stars with log (R HK ) ≥ -4.69 from our sample. In addition, K dwarfs are favoured in our sample over G dwarfs because of their lower level of stellar "noise" (p-mode, granulation and activity jitter; Dumusque et al. 2011b). Their habitable zone is also closer in. Adding all the criteria together, we ended up with a sample of 51 quiet stars with a range of spectral types from G8 to M0. They are listed in Table 1. Observational strategy: to minimize the effect of stellar noise with short typical time scales (p-modes and granulations), we applied the observational strategy implemented for the HARPS very high-precision observations (Pepe et al. 2011). With this strategy, we observe each target with a 15-min. exposure time to damp the p-modes effect and make a second (and possibly a third) measurement of the target well-spread in time during the night to damp the effect of granulation (for more details see Dumusque et al. 2011b). For bright stars, in order to avoid saturation the 15 min on target are split into subobservations. Typical average signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the spectra obtained are between 200 and 400, measured at λ = 550 nm. With continuous monitoring during the past two years of operation of HARPS-N we have acquired hundreds of precise radial velocities of the stars in the RPS sample. The typical photon-noise precision per (sub)observation is about 0.3 ms -1 . In Fig. 1, we show the radial velocity rms for all the stars in the RPS programme. This rms naturally includes photon noise, instrumental effects (telescope, spectrograph, detector), stellar intrinsic "noise", and, of course, signatures of still undetected planets. With a mode around 1.48 ms -1 , the distribution is very similar to the one obtained for the sample of solar-type stars followed at high precision with HARPS in the southern hemisphere.The sample: the first step in establishing the RPS programme was to select a sample of stars best suited for long-term precise radial velocity measurements.

        <p>The very bright star HD 219134 has been extensively studied in the literature. Basic photometric properties of this star were taken from the H catalogue (van Leeuwen 2007). A precise estimate of the radius of the star, R = 0.778 ± 0.005 R , is available from interferometric measurements (Boyajian et al. 2012). Combined with a luminosity of 0.265 ± 0.002 L , the Stefan-Boltzmann law gives T eff = 4699 ± 16 K. We adopt this value for our photometric analysis of the transiting planet in the system in Sect. 5.The very bright star HD 219134 has been extensively studied in the literature.

        <p>We also derived the atmospheric stellar parameters directly from the HARPS-N spectra using two approaches: one based on equivalent width (EW) determination and one using the Stellar Parameter Classification tool (SPC). For the EW approach, we followed the procedure described in Sect. 3 of Dumusque et al. (2014). We used the 2014 version of the local thermodynamic equilibrium code MOOG (Sneden 1973) together with the Kurucz grid of atmosphere models (Castelli &amp; Kurucz 2004;Kurucz 1992), while oscillator strength values in the line list from Sousa et al. (2011) were updated in accordance with the solar iron abundance log (Fe I) = 7.50 from Asplund et al. (2009). In order to construct high-quality spectra, spectra within the same visit (subobservation) were co-added, obtaining at the time of the analysis 88 spectra with S/Ns between 400 and 700. Equivalent widths were then measured for each of them and their mean and rms were used to determine the atmospheric parameters. We only retained the lines within the range 5 mÅ &lt; EW &lt; 100 mÅ and with a dispersion lower than either 1 mÅ or 5% of the mean EW. Despite the quality of our spectra, the preliminary analysis resulted in a poor determination of the microtubulent velocity ξ t . Following the calibration from Ramírez et al. (2013) and Tsantaki et al. (2013), we decided to fix the microturbulent velocity to ξ t = 0.35. The resulting atmospheric parameters are given in Table 2, with the gravity from FeII lines already increased by ∆ log g = 0.39 ± 0.15 according to the calibration in Sect. 3.1 of Mortier et al. (2014). We note that the derived parameters are dominated by systematic errors (e.g. choice of the oscillator strength, continuum placement) rather than random errors on EW measurements. Finally, we used the SPC tool, an alternative approach to derive atmospheric parameters by cross-correlating an observed spectrum with a library of synthetic spectra (Buchhave et al. 2012(Buchhave et al. , 2014)). With SPC we obtain an effective temperature T eff = 4941 ± 50 K, a surface gravity of 4.63 ± 0.10, and V sin i = 0.4 ± 0.5 kms -1 . The metallicity derived by SPC is 0.11 ± 0.08, from a mix of metallic absorption lines in the wavelength range between 5050 and 5360 Å.

For HD 219134, we used the T eff taken from Boyajian et al. (2012), the apparent magnitude and parallax from the H catalogue (van Leeuwen 2007), and the metallicity derived from our spectral analysis as input parameters. For the last we used the average of the values obtained from the EW and SPC approaches.

        <p>Table 3 summarizes the stellar parameters obtained from the various catalogues and analyses mentioned above, with the final values selected for the star when several estimates are available. To mitigate the effects of stellar oscillations, the strategy was to stay on target for 10 to 15 min. Because of the brightness of the star, the observations were split into several individual subobservations to avoid saturation. We obtained a total of 481 data points spread over 99 epochs (nightly averaged values). The nightly averaged values are shown in Fig. 2. Observations were performed using the simultaneous thorium calibration technique. The mean uncertainty on the individual RVs due to photon noise and known calibration noise is 0.4 ms -1 . This corresponds to an average S/N of 268 per pixel at λ = 550 nm. The data reduction was carried out with the latest version of the HARPS-N pipeline (DRS 3.7) using the cross-correlation technique (Pepe et al. 2002;Baranne et al. 1996). In addition to precise radial velocities, the pipeline provides parameters directly estimated from the cross-correlation function (CCF) of the spectrum: CCF full width at half maximum (FWHM), CCF contrast (minimum vs. continuum), CCF bisector span inverse slope, and Ca II activity index S and log R HK (Fig. 2).Table 3 summarizes the stellar parameters obtained from the various catalogues and analyses mentioned above, with the final values selected for the star when several estimates are available.

        <p>The first step of the radial velocity data analysis consists in identifying significant periodic signals in the data. This was done using the generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram algorithm (GLS, Zechmeister &amp; Kürster 2009) applied to the nightly averaged radial velocity measurements to which a systematic error of 1 ms -1 was quadratically added. False alarm probabilities were estimated through a bootstrap approach by permuting the nightly averaged data. Once a significant peak was located at a given period, the corresponding Keplerian was adjusted and removed. The process was repeated several times until no significant peak remained. For multiple Keplerians, all parameters were re-adjusted at each step of the analysis. During the analysis, we identified one radial velocity outlier (5 σ at jdb = 56 829.7) and decided to remove it to allow for a robust frequency analysis.The first step of the radial velocity data analysis consists in identifying significant periodic signals in the data.

        <p>Following this procedure, a first low-frequency oscillation with a time scale of 1842 days was identified with a semiamplitude of 5.05 ms -1 and a 0.8% false alarm probability (FAP). After removing the corresponding Keplerians, two highly significant peaks were seen in the periodogram, at 3.09 and 46.66 days, with semi-amplitudes of 2.25 and 2.10 ms -1 and FAPs smaller than 0.01% and 1%, respectively (Fig. 3). One additional peak remains at 6.76 days with a significant FAP smaller than 1% and a semi-amplitude of 1.14 ms -1 . No more periodic signals remain in the data after subtraction of the corresponding four-Keplerian model. This purely frequentist approach, using the nightly average data, has the advantage of being simple and fast and is also conservative in terms of detection limits.Following this procedure, a first low-frequency oscillation with a time scale of 1842 days was identified with a semiamplitude of 5.05 ms -1 and a 0.8% false alarm probability (FAP).

        <p>Long-period magnetic cycle: the radial velocity and activity index log R HK measurements of the star HD 219134 are shown in Fig. 2. Although both exhibit long-term variations, the log R HK time series is very stable over the first 750 days of the survey and slightly increases over the last 300 days whereas the radial velocity constantly decrease over the 1050-day observation time span. No correlation is observed between RVs and log R HK as shown in Fig. 6. The long-term trend of the log R HK is most probably related to the magnetic cycle of the star (Lovis et al. 2011a;Dumusque et al. 2011a;Meunier &amp; Lagrange 2013) while the observed 1842-day period corresponds to a long-period companion. Moreover, at the observed level of activity, we expect a low impact of stellar activity on the observed radial velocities. Notes. The epoch is chosen as the mid-time of the observations. For the three inner planets λ 0 is chosen as fitted parameter, while the timing at velocity maximum T Vmax is chosen for the outer one (see Sect. 4.2.1).Long-period magnetic cycle: the radial velocity and activity index log R HK measurements of the star HD 219134 are shown in Fig. 2.

        <p>- Rotation period: although different, the period of the third planet (46.7 days) is not very far from the rotational period of the star estimated from coherent variations of the activity indicators. A periodic variation of around 42.3 days is indeed observed in the log R HK as well as in the CCF FWHM and in the bisector span of the radial velocities, whereas no signal appears around 46.7 days, as illustrated in Fig. 7 showing the GLS periodograms of these parameters zoomed around the periods of interest. We can therefore safely consider the 42.3 days as a valid estimation of the rotational period of the star (P rot ).

We first examined the yearly aliases (Dawson &amp; Fabrycky 2010) of the at 46.7-and 42.3-day signals (Fig. 7) and confirmed that one period is not an alias of the other. In a second step, we considered several subsets of the data to check the persistence of the planetary signal over time and to mitigate the possible effects of discontinuities in the data sampling. The same features are observed. This confirms that the planetary signal at 46.7 days is present in the radial velocities at any time, and that in the same data no signal appears at the estimated P rot (42.3 days).In order to avoid any misinterpretation of the stellar activity as a planetary signal, we pushed our investigations a bit further.

        <p>Thanks to its short period of 3.09 d, HD 219134 b has an interestingly high geometric transit probability of ∼9%.

        <p>We observed HD 219134 at 4.5 µm with the Spitzer/IRAC detector (Fazio et al. 2004) in subarray mode (32 × 32 pixels windowing of the detector), the extremely fast Fowler sampling (∼0.01 s) maximizing the duty cycle and S/N. No dithering pattern was applied to the telescope (continuous staring). Because HD 219434 is an extremely bright star for Spitzer, we used the shortest available integration time of 0.01s, allowing the counts to remain in the linear regime of the detector. The observations were performed on 14 April 2015 from 01h58 to 11h18 UT. We used the recently introduced PCRS peak-up mode (Grillmair et al. 2012;Ingalls et al. 2014) which was previously used by Ballard et al. (2014) to estimate the infrared transit depth of Kepler-93 b. This mode provides enhanced accuracy in the position of the target on the detector, leading to a significant decrease of the so-called pixel phase effect, which is the most important source of correlated noise in high-S/N staring mode observation with IRAC InSb arrays (e.g. Knutson et al. 2008).

        <p>After downloading to Earth and basic calibration with the Spitzer pipeline S19
            <rs type="version">.1.0</rs>, the images were made available to us by SSC through the Spitzer Heritage Archive (SHA) web interface3 under the form of basic calibrated data (BCD). Each subarray mode BCD is composed of a cube of 64 subarray images of 32 × 32 pixels (pixel scale = 1.2 arc second). We used the following strategy to reduce these BCDs. We first converted fluxes from the Spitzer units of specific intensity (MJy/sr) to photon counts, then aperture photometry was performed on each subarray image with the 
            <rs type="software">IRAF/DAOPHOT</rs>
            <rs type="version">4</rs> software (Stetson 1987). We tested different aperture radii, and selected 2.3 pixels as the radius minimizing at best the white and red noises in the residuals of a short data fitting analysis. The centre and width of the point spread functions (PSF) were measured by fitting a 2D Gaussian profile on each image. The x -y distribution of the measurements was then looked at, and measurements having a visually discrepant position relative to the bulk of the data were then discarded. For each block of 64 subarray images, we then discarded the discrepant values for the measurements of flux, background, and x-and y-positions using a 10σ median clipping for the four parameters; the resulting values were then averaged, the photometric errors being taken as the errors on the average flux measurements. Finally, a 50σ slipping median clipping was used on the resulting light curves to discard outliers (e.g. due to cosmic hits).

        <p>Our resulting light curve counted 9396 measurements. It is shown in Fig. 9, with the evolution of relevant external parameters (PSF x-and y-centre and PSF width, background). Because its time sampling ∼3.4 s was much shorter than the structures of the expected transit and then the typical timescale of the Spitzer systematics, we binned the light curve to time intervals of 30s for the sake of computational speed of the data analysis. Nevertheless, we verified with a shorter version of the data analysis procedure described below that our results are insensitive to the binning of the photometry.Our resulting light curve counted 9396 measurements.

        <p>Following Gillon et al. (2014), the instrumental models included three types of low-order polynomials. The first had as variables the x-and y-positions of the centre of the PSF to represent the pixel phase effect of the IRAC InSb arrays (e.g. Knutson et al. 2008). The second had as variables the PSF widths in the x-and/or the y-direction, its inclusion in the baseline model strongly increasing the quality of the fit for Warm Spitzer photometry (see also Lanotte et al. 2014). The third, optional, function was a polynomial of the logarithm of time + a slope to represent a sharp decrease of the detector response at the start of the AOR ("ramp" effect, Knutson et al. 2008). To improve the quality of the modelling of the pixel phase effect, especially the fitting of its highest frequency components, we supplemented the x-and y-polynomial with the Bi-Linearly-Interpolated Sub-pixel Sensitivity (BLISS) mapping method (Stevenson et al. 2012). The sampling of the positions in space was selected so that at least five measurements fall within the same subpixel. We refer the reader to Gillon et al. (2014) for more details.Following Gillon et al. (2014), the instrumental models included three types of low-order polynomials.

The second had as variables the PSF widths in the x-and/or the y-direction, its inclusion in the baseline model strongly increasing the quality of the fit for Warm Spitzer photometry (see also Lanotte et al. 2014). The third, optional, function was a polynomial of the logarithm of time + a slope to represent a sharp decrease of the detector response at the start of the AOR ("ramp" effect, Knutson et al. 2008). To improve the quality of the modelling of the pixel phase effect, especially the fitting of its highest frequency components, we supplemented the x-and y-polynomial with the Bi-Linearly-Interpolated Sub-pixel Sensitivity (BLISS) mapping method (Stevenson et al. 2012). The sampling of the positions in space was selected so that at least five measurements fall within the same subpixel. We refer the reader to Gillon et al. (2014) for more details.</p>
        <p>Assuming no transit of HD 219134 b, the light curve corrected for the instrumental model described above shows a transit-like structure of ∼300 ppm depth that lasts ∼50 min (see Fig. 10); this structure remains if higher order terms are used in the polynomial functions. Our first step was to check that this transit-like structure did not correspond to any odd behaviour of the external parameters, which was not the case (Fig. 9). Before identifying the structure with the searched transit, we nevertheless performed a large set of short MCMC analyses assuming different baseline models, and assuming or not that the structure was a transit of the planet. For each baseline model, we computed the BIC difference between the best-fit models with and without transit to estimate the Bayes factor in favour of the transit hypothesis, multiplying the likelihood term e -0.5∆BIC by 9/91, Fig. 10. Spitzer photometry divided by two different best-fit baseline models. The first (top) aims to remove position-and PSF effects, and consists of a 4th order polynomial of the PSF x-and y-centres and widths, supplemented with the BLISS mapping method (Stevenson et al. 2012) to remove high-frequency position effects. The second baseline model (bottom) adds to the first a slope and a quadratic function of the logarithm of time to model the sharp decrease in the counts at the beginning of the run (negative ramp). Both light curves are binned per 0.005d = 7.2 min intervals.Assuming no transit of HD 219134 b, the light curve corrected for the instrumental model described above shows a transit-like structure of ∼300 ppm depth that lasts ∼50 min (see Fig. 10); this structure remains if higher order terms are used in the polynomial functions.

In these tests, we multiplied the photometric errors by a correction factor (CF, see below) of 2.72, the highest value that we ever encountered in our past experiences of high-precision photometry with Warm Spitzer. It corresponds to an AOR targeting 55 Cnc (Demory et al., in prep.) for which the PCRS peak-up mode did not work properly. In this way we assumed that the HD 219134 light curve was strongly affected by some correlated noise poorly reproduced by our instrumental model.

        <p>The limb-darkening of the star was modelled by a quadratic law (Claret 2000). Values for the two quadratic limb-darkening coefficients u 1 and u 2 were drawn at all steps of the MCMC from normal distributions with expectations and standard deviations drawn from the tables of Claret &amp; Bloemen (2011) for the Spitzer 4.5 µm bandpass and for the stellar atmospheric parameters drawn at the same step. Five chains of 100 000 steps were performed for each analysis, their convergence being checked using the statistical test of Gelman &amp; Rubin (1992). They followed a preliminary chain of 100 000 steps performed to estimate the need to rescale the photometric errors, at the end of which the standard deviation of the residuals was compared to the mean photometric errors, and the resulting ratios β w were stored. The parameter β w represents the under-or overestimation of the white noise of each measurement. The red noise present in the light curve (i.e. the inability of our model to represent perfectly the data) was taken into account as described in Gillon et al. (2010), i.e. a scaling factor β r was determined from the standard deviations of the binned and unbind residuals for different binning intervals ranging from 5 to 120 min, the largest values being kept as β r . In the end, the error bars were multiplied by the correction factor CF = β r × β w . The derived values for β r and β w were 1.30 and 1.01, resulting in CF = 1.32.The limb-darkening of the star was modelled by a quadratic law (Claret 2000).

        <p>The compositional tracks employed in Dressing et al. (2015;reproduced and updated in Fig. 13) are based on interior structure models by Zeng &amp; Sasselov (2013) that represent small planets as fully differentiated iron cores surrounded by lower density magnesium silicate mantles. These models provide a useful framework for comparing relative planet compositions, but the absolute core mass fractions are underestimated slightly because the Zeng &amp; Sasselov (2013) models do not incorporate the presence of lighter elements in the core and do not include water in the mantle. Accordingly, the Earth-like compositional track presented in Dressing et al. (2015) corresponds to a model composition of 83% MgSiO 3 and 17% Fe, whereas the actual core mass fraction of the Earth is closer to 30%. Zeng et al. (2015) have recently updated their model framework to account for the presence of lighter elements in the core and the presence of water in the mantle. Employing the new models, we find that the population of highly irradiated dense planets (HD 219134b, CoRoT-7b, Kepler-10b, Kepler-36b, Kepler-78b, and Kepler-93b) are best described by a two-component iron-magnesium silicate model with a core mass fraction of approximately 22-23%.The compositional tracks employed in Dressing et al.

        <p>We have presented in this paper the first result from the Rocky Planet Search (RPS) programme conducted with HARPS-N, as a planetary system of three inner super-Earths and one outer sub-Saturn planet, hosted by the bright and nearby quiet K dwarf HD 219134. The planet separations between 0.039 and 0.23 AU called for a search of potential transits of the inner planet(s) with the Spitzer space telescope. The successful detection of the transit of HD 219134 b makes the star the closest (6.5 pc) and brightest (V = 5.5) star known to date with a transiting planet (super-Earth). This system is thus becoming one of the most favourable ones for follow-up observations, in order to better constrain the system architecture or to characterize the physical properties of the planets. First, it provides an excellent constraining point in the mass-radius diagram (Fig. 13) for the composition of the planet, found to be of terrestrial-equivalent composition with a core mass fraction of the order of 22%. The quality of the measurements of the radius, mass, and then mean density actually foreshadows what can be expected from the future transit missions in preparation that will target bright stars (CHEOPS, TESS, PLATO). We also know from Kepler results that multitransiting systems of small-size planets are numerous. It is now highly suitable to search for traces of transits of the other planets in the systems. Finally, even if a potential atmosphere around the planet is expected a priori to be tiny, the brightness of the system makes it worth trying to detect features of this atmosphere in the UV, visible, and near-infrared, from space and from the ground, especially in preparation for future measurements with larger facilities (JWST, TMT).We have presented in this paper the first result from the Rocky Planet Search (RPS) programme conducted with HARPS-N, as a planetary system of three inner super-Earths and one outer sub-Saturn planet, hosted by the bright and nearby quiet K dwarf HD 219134.
