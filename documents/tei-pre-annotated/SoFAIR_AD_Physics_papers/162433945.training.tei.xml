        <p>Germanium (Ge) has played a key role in silicon photonics as an enabling material for datacom applications. Indeed, the unique properties of Ge have been leveraged to develop high performance integrated photodectors, which are now mature devices. Ge is also very useful for the achievement of compact modulators and monolithically integrated laser sources on silicon. Interestingly, research efforts in these domains also put forward the current revolution of mid-IR photonics. Ge and Ge-based alloys also present strong advantages for mid-infrared photonic platform such as the extension of the transparency window for these materials, which can operate at wavelengths beyond 8 μm. Different platforms have been proposed to take benefit from the broad transparency of Ge up to 15 μm, and the main passive building blocks are now being developed. In this review, we will present the most relevant Ge-based platforms reported so far that have led to the demonstration of several passive and active building blocks for mid-IR photonics.

        <p>Today, silicon photonics is a mature technology for integrated photonics, which benefits from a reliable and highvolume fabrication to offer high performance, low cost and compact photonic circuits. Among the different materials available in silicon photonics, germanium (Ge), silicon-germanium (SiGe) and germanium-tin (GeSn) play a key role at different maturity level in establishing essential functionalities required for a photonic integrated platform. First applications of silicon photonics were dedicated to Datacom in the near-InfraRed (near-IR) wavelength range. While Ge photodetectors have been considered for a long time as a key component in the receiver part, the small energy difference between the direct and the indirect band gap energy of Ge also makes it an ideal candidate to develop compact electro-absorption modulators and to envision on-chip monolithically integrated lasers. Besides the demonstration of efficient devices, an in-depth understanding of the properties of Ge, SiGe and GeSn is required to properly and finely tune several parameters such as the concentration of Ge or Sn in the alloys, doping or lattice strain.Today, silicon photonics is a mature technology for integrated photonics, which benefits from a reliable and highvolume fabrication to offer high performance, low cost and compact photonic circuits.

        <p>More recently, it appeared that Ge also presents distinctive advantages for mid-infrared (mid-IR) photonics owing to its wide transparency window up to 15 μm and a strong non-linear refractive index. Main foreseen applications stand for the development of new mid-IR spectroscopic sensing systems that need to be portable and cost-effective, or free space optical communications for wavelengths beyond 8 μm. Previous works at telecom wavelength paved the way towards a new playground for photonic researchers as manifold engineering possibilities are now opened using Ge, SiGe and GeSn for both passive and active functions.More recently, it appeared that Ge also presents distinctive advantages for mid-infrared (mid-IR) photonics owing to its wide transparency window up to 15 μm and a strong non-linear refractive index.

        <p>In this context, we will review the development of Gebased photonic integrated circuits. For near-IR photonics applications, previous review papers have been devoted to monolithic integrated Ge-on-Si active photonics [1][2][3][4]. Thus, we will just recall hereafter the main motivations for the development of Ge-based devices and summarize major results. Interestingly, we will see how these works put forward the current revolution of mid-IR photonics [5]. Indeed Ge is a unique candidate for extending the operating wavelength of Group IV-based photonic integrated circuits beyond 8 μm. The different integrated platforms used up to now will be presented, emphasizing on the development of passive functions such as cavities or spectrometers and on preliminary sensing demonstrations. Current demonstrations have already been reported up to 8.5 μm, typically for the moment, in a rapidly growing research field with a strong potential to reach wavelengths up to 15 μm. In parallel, state-of-the-art Si-based mid-IR photonics circuits can be found in recent review papers [6][7][8]. Finally, the progress towards integrated active devices such as a monolithically integrated source, the modulator and the photodetector will be presented and future perspectives opened by these works will be drawn. The fine comprehension of a myriad of physical effects including the non-linear optical effect, the free-carrier plasma effect or intersubband transitions in quantum systems can thus lay the foundations for the implementation of efficient mid-IR chip-scale systems with an unprecedented number of applications such as absorption spectroscopy for chemical or biological sensing, environmental monitoring, datacom or free-space optical communications, to name a few.In this context, we will review the development of Gebased photonic integrated circuits.

        <p>The investigation of Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) as a platform for photonic integration dated back to 1990s with the first demonstrations of low-loss propagation in the near-IR range [9]. The large refractive index contrast between silicon (Si) and silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) provides a strong light confinement, leading to ultra-compact waveguides such as nanowires with transversal dimensions of a few hundreds of nanometers with tight bend radius. Up to now, the development of silicon photonics has been mainly driven by telecom and datacom applications, requiring fiber-to-chip light coupling, on-chip routing, wavelength filtering and polarization management. All of these passive functions have been successfully demonstrated and miniaturized based on the SOI platform. However, transceivers also require the on-chip integration of active photonic functionalities such as light emitter, modulator and photodetector (Figure 1). Si is an indirect bandgap material, having a bandgap energy of 1.1 eV. It thus exhibits poor emission and detection properties in the near-IR wavelength (1.3-1.55 μm). This frequency window is used for telecom applications due to the dispersion characteristics and low-propagation losses in optical fibers at these wavelengths. Thus, different strategies have been used to develop active devices on SOI platform, mainly based on monolithic or heterogeneous integration of other materials. Rapidly, Ge appeared to be a material of choice for monolithic integration, due to its compatibility with Si CMOS technology. Furthermore, its direct bandgap energy of 0.8 eV is compatible with near-IR light absorption. Ge photodetectors have thus been developed since the late 1990s [10][11][12][13]. To deal with the lattice mismatch between Si and Ge, a two-step growth process has been proposed and largely adopted, in which a thin layer is first epitaxially grown at low temperature to relax the strain between Si and Ge and confine dislocations at the two material interface. Then, in a second step, a thick Ge layer can be grown at high temperature, allowing for the achievement of an active material with a good crystalline quality. Post-grown temperature annealing can also be used. Based on this approach, Ge photodetectors rapidly achieved outstanding performances. High responsivity, high speed operation and low dark current have been demonstrated in different configurations [13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27]. Ge photodetectors are now considered to be a mature device, available in multi-project-wafer (MPW) platforms [https://mycmp.fr/IMG/pdf/overwier_cea_leti_ic_si310-phmp2m_june2017.pdf, http://www.aimphotonics.com/ pdk, https://www.imec-int.com/en/silicon-photonic-ICsprototyping, https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ime/SERVICES/R-D-Fab/silicon_photonics_multi-projects-wafer] and also in industrial foundries [ [28], https://www.globalfoundries.com/technology-solutions/silicon-photonics].The investigation of Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) as a platform for photonic integration dated back to 1990s with the first demonstrations of low-loss propagation in the near-IR range [9].

        <p>In parallel with the development of Ge photodetectors, an extensive number of works has been devoted to silicon-based optical modulators. Phase modulation by free-carrier concentration variation is used to achieve high-speed modulation in silicon, and many different configurations have been proposed to optimize the typically trade-offs between efficiency, loss and speed. Electrical structures such as PN, PIN, PIPIN diodes or MOS capacitors have been integrated in SOI waveguides to achieve carrier injection, depletion or accumulation. An overview of the early evolution of Si modulator can be found in Ref. [29]. State-of-the-art silicon on-off keying (OOK) modulators are currently reaching 50-Gb/s operation [30][31][32][33] while advanced multi-level modulation formats such as n-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-n), quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), or even 16-level quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM) allow to increase transmission data rate up to 224 Gb/s [34][35][36][37][38][39]. Interestingly, while most of the reported works have been carried out in the conventional communication band (C-band) centered around 1550 nm, silicon photonics systems are also highly attractive for short-reach applications such as intra-datacenter communications. Those are typically located in the original communication window (O-band), around the wavelength of 1310 nm, to benefit from negligible chromatic dispersion of standard optical fibers. Despite the lower free-carrier dispersion effect at this wavelength in comparison with the C-band, high-performance devices have been demonstrated, showing 50-Gbit/s OOK modulation [32] or low-voltage operation [40]. Developing higherorder modulation formats in the O-band is also receiving significant amount of research attention [41][42][43][44].In parallel with the development of Ge photodetectors, an extensive number of works has been devoted to silicon-based optical modulators.

        <p>Like Ge photodetectors, Si modulators are currently mature devices available for applications. However for some specific applications, for instance short-reach communications, the power consumption of the modulator is recognized as a key metric that has to be minimized to overpass current electrical-based interconnects. It has thus been evaluated that to effectively replace copper wire for chip-to-chip or on-chip communications, the power consumption of the optical modulator has to be below 100 fJ/bit [45]. Silicon modulator based on carrier concentration variations typically requires the use of an active region with a length of a few millimeters, altogether with voltages of a few volts. The energy consumption required to charge/discharge the corresponding capacitance is typically of a few pJ/bit. Resonant structures can take benefit from a nonlinear transfer function to reduce the active region surface, the price to pay being a reduced optical bandwidth. Electroabsorption can be used to overcome this problem and to provide compact (&lt;100 μm) and low power consumption (&lt;100 fJ/bit) optical modulator. Despite being an indirect bandgap material, the small difference between the direct and the indirect bandgap energy of Ge allows the achievement of strong electroabsorption at its direct bandgap energy. Ge or SiGe Franz-Keldysh modulator monolithically integrated on silicon have been reported since 2008 [46], and followed by different demonstrations [47][48][49]. Recent works have shown that these SiGe modulators are now reaching a strong maturity towards applications in telecommunications field [50][51][52][53]. Electroabsorption using Ge/SiGe Multiple Quantum Wells (MQW) has also been studied, with a first demonstration in 2005 [54]. As a main advantage in comparison with Franz-Keldysh effect, the absorption band-edge of the QW structure can be tuned to achieve modulation at 1.55 [55,56] or 1.3 μm [57,58] wavelengths, i.e. in the C-or O-band of communications. Strain compensated Ge/SiGe QW can be grown on Ge-rich SiGe virtual substrates, obtained by the growth of a thick (typically 10 μm) graded buffer from Si to Ge-rich SiGe layer, followed by a 2-μm-thick Ge-rich SiGe layer. Good quality of Ge/SiGe QW was obtained, with a reduced width of the excitonic absorption peak of about 6 meV [59]. A review of the early achievements towards photonic integrated circuits based on Ge/SiGe QW can be found in Ref. [3]. More recently, attention has been dedicated to the possibility to achieve phase modulation by QCSE [60]. A giant electro-optic effect has already been demonstrated in coupled quantum-well structures [61]. As a main challenge, the integration of Ge/SiGeQWs with SOI waveguides remains the main limiting factor to develop silicon photonics transceivers based on Ge/SiGe QW [62][63][64][65]. As an alternative path, it was proposed to use Ge-rich SiGe virtual substrates as a passive waveguide, allowing the demonstration of an on-chip transmission link using Ge/SiGe QW modulator and photodetector grown on Si substrate [66]. This new platform was further explored, and the possibility to achieve tight bends, MMIs and Mach-Zehnder interferometers was demonstrated [67].Like Ge photodetectors, Si modulators are currently mature devices available for applications.

        <p>The possibility to use the direct gap transition of Ge and SiGe alloys has also opened an exciting research field towards the monolithic integration of light sources on photonic integrated circuits [68][69][70][71][72][73]. The realization of a Ge-based laser source requires band engineering to tailor the Ge properties accordingly, targeting an efficient direct band gap emission. An alternative approach has been proposed, using GeSn alloys to achieve a direct band gap material. GeSn laser has thus been demonstrated both optically and electrically pumped [74][75][76]. It can be noted that increasing Sn concentration in the alloy also creates a reduction of the bandgap energy, shifting the operation wavelength towards 2-3 μm, opening a perspective, for instance, in the use of new communications wavelengths.The possibility to use the direct gap transition of Ge and SiGe alloys has also opened an exciting research field towards the monolithic integration of light sources on photonic integrated circuits [68][69][70][71][72][73].

        <p>While Si is transparent up to 8 μm wavelength, the strong absorption of SiO 2 is expected to limit the operating wavelength range of conventional SOI waveguides beyond 4 μm. However, different strategies have appeared recently such as a proper design of SOI waveguide to limit the overlap of the optical mode with the lower silicon dioxide cladding [78]. Other options rely on the combination of Si membrane engineered by sub-wavelength grating nano-structuration to achieve air-cladded Si waveguides [79], the use of Si nanopillars [80], or Si on Sapphire [81]. The state-of-the-art Si-based mid-IR devices such as waveguides, sources, modulators or photodetectors can be found in recent review papers [6][7][8].While Si is transparent up to 8 μm wavelength, the strong absorption of SiO 2 is expected to limit the operating wavelength range of conventional SOI waveguides beyond 4 μm.

        <p>In parallel with the development of Si-based mid-IR photonic circuits, Ge is a prime candidate to extend the operating wavelength of Group IV-based photonic integrated circuits beyond 8 μm, potentially up to 15 μm [6,77]. Furthermore, Ge benefits from a strong third-order nonlinearity which can also be advantageously exploited for the development of active devices [82].

        <p>Initial works used Germanium-on-Silicon (GOS) waveguides. Losses of 2.5 dB/cm have been obtained at 5.8 μm wavelength [83]. Mid-IR wavelength (de)multiplexers based on planar concave gratings (PCGs) [84] and Arrayed Waveguide Grating (AWG) Multiplexers [85] have been demonstrated, providing an operation in the 5-μm wavelength range. The GOS platform is widely used in photonics research presently and many impressive achievements have been performed even on active building blocks as will be shown later. The lowest propagation loss on that platform reported so far had a loss of only 0.6 dB/cm at 3.8 μm wavelength [86]. However, the silicon bottom cladding is expected to limit the device operation to wavelengths shorter than 8 μm. Recent work reported propagation from 7.5 to 8.5 μm wavelength. A minimum value of 2.5 dB/cm at λ ~7.5 μm was obtained; however, losses rapidly increased for longer wavelengths up to 20 dB/cm [87].

A minimum value of 2.5 dB/cm at λ ~7.5 μm was obtained; however, losses rapidly increased for longer wavelengths up to 20 dB/cm [87]. Optical and nonlinear properties of GOS waveguides have also been studied theoretically to define waveguide design guidelines for several applications [88].

        <p>The field of mid-IR group IV-based optical modulators is still at its infancy. As reported before, Ge-based materials can be used for electro-absorption using Franz-Keldysh in Ge, SiGe or Quantum Confined Stark effect Ge/ SiGe QW. These demonstrations have been performed at 1.3-1.5 μm wavelength, the wavelength being determined by the absorption band-edge of the material. Doping Ge with Sn results in a transition from indirect to direct bandgap, but also in a decrease of the bandgap energy. This is the reason why GeSn lasers operate at 2 μm wavelength. Thus the use of GeSn materials has been proposed to achieve light modulation by electro-absorption at this wavelength range. Franz-Keldysh GeSn modulator was designed, with 6 dB extinction ratio for a 2 V pp drive signal and a 35-GHz bandwidth [136]. It was also proposed to use Quantum Confined Stark Effect in GeSn/SiGeSn QW. Modeling indicates that more than 6 dB extinction ratio should be obtained with a 215-μm long device [137]. To achieve wavelengths beyond 2 μm, alternative effects have to be used. Silicon modulators in the near-IR use free-carrier plasma dispersion effect. The extension of this effect in the MIR has been theoretically evaluated first in Si [138] and then in Ge [139]. Interestingly, it was predicted that the plasma dispersion effect becomes more effective when the wavelength increases. Experimental demonstrations have then been reported using carrier injection in a silicon PIN diode.

Photo detection beyond 2 μm was obtained in surface illuminated photodiodes using GeSn/Ge multiple quantum wells [146,147], GeSn-on-Silicon [148] or Ge/Ge 1-x Sn x /Ge heterostructures grown on Silicon [149].</p>
        <p>These different approaches related to band-to-band transition are intrinsically limited to SWIR, while there is a need for practical monolithically integrated sensors at longer wavelength. As a good candidate, quantum well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs) rely on intersubband transitions within the QW, thus shorter photon energy is achievable. QWIPs based on SiGe alloys have been demonstrated in different configurations. In initial works, Si-rich structures were considered thanks to the easier procedure for obtaining Si-rich relaxed SiGe virtual substrates [150]. More recently, with the achievement of good quality Ge-rich SiGe virtual substrates [151], it has been possible to conceive Ge-rich SiGe QW showing intersubband absorption from 6 to 9 μm wavelength at room temperature that can be tuned by adjusting the quantum well thickness [152].These different approaches related to band-to-band transition are intrinsically limited to SWIR, while there is a need for practical monolithically integrated sensors at longer wavelength.

        <p>Silicon photonics is now a well-established technology. While the use of SOI wafers allows for strong field confinement and tight bends, the combination with Ge permits to obtain high performance active devices required for telecom and datacom applications, at near-IR wavelength. The evolution of Ge-based active devices within Si photonics paved the way towards new wavelength range capabilities, as it allows extending the operation of photonic integrated circuits deep inside the mid-IR range.Silicon photonics is now a well-established technology.

        <p>Today, wavelengths up to 8.5 μm have been achieved, with propagation loss of only a few dB/cm. A whole set of passive building blocks have also been developed, such as wavelength mulitplexers, fiber couplers or resonators. Main applications are related to absorption spectroscopy, as in this fingerprint wavelength range, most of the molecules have a unique absorption signature, which enables to retrieve and quantify their presence without any waveguide functionalization. First proof of concepts of molecular optical sensing has been demonstrated, based on the absorption of the evanescent tail of the optical mode, Active devices such as mid-IR wideband source, modulator and the photodetector are thus required to complete the Ge-based mid-IR platforms. Differents works have already been reported towards this objective, based on a myriad of different physical effects such NLO, plasma dispersion effect, intersubband transitions, Franz-Keldysh or Quantum Confined Stark Effect, to name of few.Today, wavelengths up to 8.5 μm have been achieved, with propagation loss of only a few dB/cm.

        <p>Ge-based mid-IR photonics is an exciting and rapidly expanding field. The performance of passive and active devices is continuously improving, and the maximum attainable wavelength range is rapidly expanding. Efforts have been devoted to build basic elements for further complex functionalities within the Ge platform. Interestingly, this evolution relies on the fine comprehension of physical mechanisms of Ge, GeSn and SiGe materials. Based on the current evolution, the use of Ge-based photonics in commercial devices can be expected in a short term.Ge-based mid-IR photonics is an exciting and rapidly expanding field.
