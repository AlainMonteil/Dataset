        <p>Transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) gluon distributions have different operator definitions, depending on the process under consideration. We study that aspect of TMD factorization in the small-x limit, for the various unpolarized TMD gluon distributions encountered in the literature. To do this, we consider di-jet production in hadronic collisions, since this process allows to be exhaustive with respect to the possible operator definitions, and is suitable to be investigated at small x. Indeed, for forward and nearly back-to-back jets, one can apply both the TMD factorization and Color Glass Condensate (CGC) approaches to compute the di-jet cross-section, and compare the results. Doing so, we show that both descriptions coincide, and we show how to express the various TMD gluon distributions in terms of CGC correlators of Wilson lines, while keeping N c finite. We then proceed to evaluate them by solving the JIMWLK equation numerically. We obtain that at large transverse momentum, the process dependence essentially disappears, while at small transverse momentum, non-linear saturation effects impact the various TMD gluon distributions in very different ways. We notice the presence of a geometric scaling regime for all the TMD gluon distributions studied: the "dipole" one, the Weizsäcker-Williams one, and the six others involved in forward di-jet production.Transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) gluon distributions have different operator definitions, depending on the process under consideration.

        <p>In hadronic collisions that feature a large transfer of momentum, the standard perturbative QCD framework of collinear factorization is appropriate to calculate scattering cross sections, which are measurable in particular at the Large Hadron Collider. However, some hadronic processes involve, in addition, smaller momentum scales, and for those one needs to resort to a more involved QCD framework, using the concept of transverse-momentumdependent (TMD) parton distributions, or in short, TMDs. This relates to a large number of observables such as the production of heavy bosons at small transverse momentum [1,2], transverse spin asymmetries measured in high-energy collisions with polarized beams [3,4], or in general hadronic scattering in the high-energy limit [5,6].In hadronic collisions that feature a large transfer of momentum, the standard perturbative QCD framework of collinear factorization is appropriate to calculate scattering cross sections, which are measurable in particular at the Large Hadron Collider.

        <p>One of the main theoretical obstacles has been the fact that, even in cases for which TMD factorization could be established, the precise operator definition of the parton distributions is dependent on the process under consideration [7,8], implying a loss of universality. In this paper, our goal is to study that aspect of TMDs, in the limit of small longitudinal momentum fraction x, where the parton transverse momentum k t generically plays a central role. Restricting ourselves to unpolarized gluon TMDs, we investigate what happens when the large gluon density reaches the saturation regime, and how the different JHEP10(2016)065 gluon TMDs are affected by non-linear effects when k t becomes of the order of the saturation scale Q s (x), or below. To do so, we shall use the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) framework, an effective theory of QCD which encompasses its small-x dynamics, both in the linear and non-linear regimes [9].One of the main theoretical obstacles has been the fact that, even in cases for which TMD factorization could be established, the precise operator definition of the parton distributions is dependent on the process under consideration [7,8], implying a loss of universality.

        <p>In order to perform our study of the various unpolarized gluon TMDs for protons and nuclei in the small-x regime, we choose to consider the process of forward di-jet production in proton-proton (p+p) and proton-nucleus (p+A) collisions, respectively. On the one hand, di-jets, when produced nearly back-to-back, provide the two necessary transverse momentum scales, and the strong ordering needed between them, for TMDs to be relevant: the hard scale is the typical single-jet transverse momentum P t while the softer scale is the total transverse momentum of the jet pair k t , and TMD factorization applies when k t P t [10]. On the other hand, the production at forward rapidities probes small values of x: for kinematical reasons, only high-momentum partons from the "projectile" hadron contribute, while on the "target" side, it is mainly small-x gluons that are involved [11]. The forward di-jet process is therefore an ideal playground to apply both the TMD and CGC frameworks and to compare them.In order to perform our study of the various unpolarized gluon TMDs for protons and nuclei in the small-x regime, we choose to consider the process of forward di-jet production in proton-proton (p+p) and proton-nucleus (p+A) collisions, respectively.

        <p>Note that the asymmetry of the problem, x 1 ∼ 1 and x 2 1, implies that gluons from the target have a much bigger average transverse momentum (of the order of Q s ) compared to that of the partons from the projectile (which is of the order of Λ QCD ). Therefore we shall always neglect the transverse momentum of the high-x 1 partons from the projectile compared to that of the low-x 2 gluons from the target. As a result, the parton content of the projectile hadron will be described by regular parton distributions and TMDs will be involved only on the target side, with the transverse momentum of those small-x 2 gluons being equal to the transverse momentum of jet pair k t . This simplification is actually needed in order to apply TMD factorization for the di-jet process, since for this final state, there is no such factorization with TMDs for both incoming hadrons [12,13].Note that the asymmetry of the problem, x 1 ∼ 1 and x 2 1, implies that gluons from the target have a much bigger average transverse momentum (of the order of Q s ) compared to that of the partons from the projectile (which is of the order of Λ QCD ).

        <p>In order to compare the TMD and CGC approaches in their overlapping domain of validity, we could have considered a simpler process where this issue does not arise, such as for instance semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering in electron-proton or electron-nucleus collisions [14,15]. However, with simpler processes, one encounters only small sub-sets of all the possible operator definitions for the gluon TMDs. The advantage of the di-jet process in p+p or p+A collisions is that it involves all the possible gluon TMDs encountered so far in the literature [16], and therefore it allows us to be comprehensive and study the specifics of the process dependence of gluon TMDs at small-x in an exhaustive way. All our findings, such as the geometric scaling of all the gluon TMDs, will naturally carry over to other processes for which only one or a few of them play a role, like di-jet or heavyquark production in deep-inelastic scattering and Drell-Yan or photon-jet in p+p and p+A collisions, for instance [17].In order to compare the TMD and CGC approaches in their overlapping domain of validity, we could have considered a simpler process where this issue does not arise, such as for instance semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering in electron-proton or electron-nucleus collisions [14,15].

        <p>The TMD description of the forward di-jet process, valid in the k t P t limit but with no (other than kinematical) constraints on the value of x 2 , calls for the use of eight different operator definitions for the gluon TMDs [18]. They all involve a correlator of two field strength operators, but they differ from each other in their gauge link content. Each of the gluon TMDs is also associated to a different hard factor, made of a sub-set of the JHEP10(2016)065 possible 2 → 2 diagrams.

        <p>The CGC description of the forward di-jet process, valid in the small-x limit but with no (other than kinematical) constraints on the values of the transverse momenta of the jets, involves correlators of up to eight Wilson lines, all of which sit at different transverse positions [11,19]. We show that in the k t P t limit, the CGC formula coincides with the small-x limit of the TMD formula. In particular, we show how the various gluon TMDs emerge from the framework, how their different operator definitions correspond to different Wilson lines structure of the CGC correlators.

        <p>It is important to note that in the k t P t limit, saturation effects do not disappear. Indeed, even though the hard scale P t is much bigger than the saturation scale, the transverse momentum of jet pair k t may be of the order of Q s , and formally all powers of Q 2 s /k 2 t may still be included in the definition of the gluon TMDs. They are all contained if the Wilson-line correlators are properly evaluated in the CGC. In particular, the non-linear QCD evolution of all the gluon TMDs can be obtained from the Jalilian-Marian-Iancu-McLerran-Weigert-Leonidov-Kovner (JIMWLK) [20][21][22][23][24][25][26] equation, in the leading ln(1/x) approximation. Using a numerical simulation of the JIMWLK equation on a discretized lattice, we are able to extract their k t dependence and evolution towards small values of x 2 , as well as some important properties: all the gluon TMDs feature geometric scaling (i.e. they are functions of k t /Q s (x 2 ) only, as opposed to k t and x 2 separately) in the saturation region k t ≤ Q s (x 2 ), and they either vanish or coincide for k t Q s (x 2 ). Finally, having understood how their process dependence manifests itself in the CGC allows us to restore universality: potential information extracted from a particular process, for one gluon TMD, can be consistently fed into the others.It is important to note that in the k t P t limit, saturation effects do not disappear.

The asymptotic window looks small on a logarithmic scale but each fit has 300 independent degrees of freedom for a lattice size L = 1024, after the cut (4.13). As a matter of fact, statistical errors in table 2 are much smaller than the ∼ 3% systematic errors in the power law. The residual systematic errors are partly due the approximations in the lattice discretization (4.3) of the MV model and partly to the discretization of gluon TMDs.

        <p>We have studied the process dependence of unpolarized gluon TMDs at small-x, in the CGC framework. As a testing ground, we considered forward di-jet production in p+p or p+A collisions, a process in which kinematics impose a dilute-dense asymmetry, x 1 ∼ 1 and x 2 1, that in turn allows to employ TMD distributions for the small-x 2 target only. We investigated what happens when the large gluon density of the target reaches the saturation regime, and how the various process-dependent gluon TMDs are affected by non-linear effects when the transverse momentum becomes of the order of the saturation scale Q s (x 2 ), or below.We have studied the process dependence of unpolarized gluon TMDs at small-x, in the CGC framework.

        <p>This allows their evaluation from the fixed-coupling JIMWLK equation, including the full small-x QCD evolution with non-linear corrections. We use the standard twodimensional lattice formulation in terms of a Langevin process in the space of Wilson lines. We obtain that at large transverse momentum, k t Q s (x 2 ), the process dependence essentially disappears, in the sense that all the gluon TMDs fall onto a universal curve, except for Re F (2) gg which vanishes faster, as shown in figure 7 (top plot). This feature of the MV model which we used as an initial condition is preserved by the evolution, with the difference that the power-law fall-off of the gluon TMDs with k t evolves from 1/k 2 t (a theoretical result which we checked here numerically) to a less steep power: 1/k 2γ t with 1/2 &lt; γ &lt; 1. By contrast, the process dependence of the gluon TMDs is most relevant at small transverse momentum k t ≤ Q s (x 2 ): as shown in figure 7 (bottom plot), the various distributions are very different from each other. However, it is important to point out that at small-x, in the CGC framework, these differences are fully under control, hereby restoring universality: potential information extracted from a particular process, for one gluon TMD, can be consistently fed into the others. Indeed, for phenomenology it will be important for instance to take into account running-coupling corrections, and the parameters related to JHEP10(2016)065 its unknown behavior in the non-perturbative region will need to be adjusted to fit data.

        <p>Most importantly, we have observed that all the TMD gluon distributions reach a geometric scaling regime after some evolution, i.e. they become functions of k t /Q s (y). A precise determination of the properties of this regime, such as the y dependence of the saturation scale and of the anomalous dimension γ, whose existence is manifest from figure 7, is outside the scope of the present study. But such a determination is quite possible, especially if one considers that reproducing the numerical data generated in this analysis requires a computing time four orders of magnitude less than typical ab-initio lattice QCD calculations. Moreover, numerical analyses should be as precise for JIMWLK evolutions supplemented with running-coupling corrections [38] or collinear resummations [50]. For genuine higher-order corrections [51,52], that will depend on whether or not the Langevin description still holds.Most importantly, we have observed that all the TMD gluon distributions reach a geometric scaling regime after some evolution, i.e. they become functions of k t /Q s (y).
