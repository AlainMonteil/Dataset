        <p>We present full-sky maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and polarized synchrotron and thermal dust emission, derived from the third set of Planck frequency maps. These products have significantly lower contamination from instrumental systematic effects than previous versions. The methodologies used to derive these maps follow closely those described in earlier papers, adopting four methods (Commander, NILC, SEVEM, and SMICA) to extract the CMB component, as well as three methods (Commander, GNILC, and SMICA) to extract astrophysical components. Our revised CMB temperature maps agree with corresponding products in the Planck 2015 delivery, whereas the polarization maps exhibit significantly lower large-scale power, reflecting the improved data processing described in companion papers; however, the noise properties of the resulting data products are complicated, and the best available end-to-end simulations exhibit relative biases with respect to the data at the few percent level. Using these maps, we are for the first time able to fit the spectral index of thermal dust independently over 3 • regions. We derive a conservative estimate of the mean spectral index of polarized thermal dust emission of β d = 1.55 ± 0.05, where the uncertainty marginalizes both over all known systematic uncertainties and different estimation techniques. For polarized synchrotron emission, we find a mean spectral index of β s = -3.1 ± 0.1, consistent with previously reported measurements. We note that the current data processing does not allow for construction of unbiased single-bolometer maps, and this limits our ability to extract CO emission and correlated components. The foreground results for intensity derived in this paper therefore do not supersede corresponding Planck 2015 products. For polarization the new results supersede the corresponding 2015 products in all respects.We present full-sky maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and polarized synchrotron and thermal dust emission, derived from the third set of Planck frequency maps.

        <p>This paper, one of a set associated with the 2018 release of data from the Planck1 mission (Planck Collaboration I 2016), describes the cosmological and astrophysical component maps derived from the full set of Planck observations (Planck Collaboration I 2020), and compares these to earlier versions of the corresponding products. Planck was launched on 14 May 2009, and observed the sky nearly without interruption for four years. The raw, time-ordered observations were released to the public in their entirety in February 2015 as part of the second Planck data release (PR2), together with associated frequency and component sky maps and higher-level science data products, including cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectra and cosmological parameters. These observations represent a cornerstone of modern cosmology, and they severely constrain the history of the early Universe.This paper, one of a set associated with the 2018 release of data from the Planck1 mission (Planck Collaboration I 2016), describes the cosmological and astrophysical component maps derived from the full set of Planck observations (Planck Collaboration I 2020), and compares these to earlier versions of the corresponding products.

        <p>The time-ordered data selection adopted for the current (third, PR3) release is similar to that used in the second release (Planck Collaboration II 2020;Planck Collaboration III 2020); the second and third Planck product deliveries therefore have nearly identical scientific constraining power, as measured in terms of raw integration time and instrumental noise levels. The difference between the two releases lies in their overall levels of instrumental systematic uncertainties and calibration. A substantial fraction of the second-release papers was dedicated to identifying, quantifying, and characterizing residual uncertainties due to a wide range of instrumental effects, including effective gain variations, analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) nonlinearities, residual temporal transfer functions, and foreground bandpass leakage. Indeed, these residuals were sufficiently large to prohibit extraction of a robust polarization signal on large angular scales from the Planck High Frequency Instrument (HFI) observations, significantly limiting the science scope of the Planck polarization observations as a whole. Fortunately, as discussed extensively in Planck Collaboration III (2020), these residuals are now not only better understood and modelled, but also greatly reduced in the final dataset, particularly through the use of improved end-to-end processing techniques.The time-ordered data selection adopted for the current (third, PR3) release is similar to that used in the second release (Planck Collaboration II 2020;Planck Collaboration III 2020); the second and third Planck product deliveries therefore have nearly identical scientific constraining power, as measured in terms of raw integration time and instrumental noise levels.

        <p>In this paper, we present updated full-sky CMB maps in both temperature and polarization, as well as new synchrotron and thermal dust emission maps in polarization, and compare these to previous versions (Planck Collaboration XII 2014;Planck Collaboration IX 2016;Planck Collaboration X 2016). In terms of temperature foreground products, we provide an update of the Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (GNILC; Remazeilles et al. 2011b) thermal dust model, to be used in conjunction with the updated 2018 GNILC polarization map, but no new Commander (Eriksen et al. 2008) foreground products. The reason for this is one of necessity: as described in Planck Collaboration III (2020), the latest HFI processing exploits the full information content of each frequency in order to suppress large-scale polarization systematics, and the processing has thus been tuned to optimize the polarization solution. The cost of this choice, however, is that individual single-bolometer maps are no longer available; see section 3.1.2 of Planck Collaboration III 2020 for details. Specifically, some of the singlebolometer maps only contain part of the sky signal and thus cannot be used for component separation. This, in turn, has an impact on the ability of the Commander algorithm to resolve individual foreground components in temperature. The single most important effect is on our ability to constrain CO line emission, which benefits particularly strongly from intra-frequency measurements. Because each unfiltered bolometer in principle has a different bandpass amplitude at the CO-line centre frequency of 115.27 GHz (and multiples thereof), each bolometer observes the true CO signal with different effective responses, and these differences provide a strong handle on the true intensity of the CO signal. Furthermore, both thermal dust and free-free emission correlate strongly with CO emission, and are therefore also negatively affected by the lack of single-bolometer maps. In turn, free-free emission is strongly correlated with both synchrotron and anomalous microwave emission. In summary, we believe that the Planck 2015 Commander-based temperature (i.e., Stokes I) foreground model represents a more accurate description of the true temperature sky than what can be extracted from the current (2018) data set. To avoid confusion, we therefore do not release the latest version publicly, although we compare the two Article number, page 2 of 76 Planck Collaboration: Diffuse component separation models in Sect. 5. For the CMB component, we find that the latest processing produces results that are fully consistent with the previous incarnation, while for polarization the new results represent a major improvement, both in terms of CMB and foregrounds.In this paper, we present updated full-sky CMB maps in both temperature and polarization, as well as new synchrotron and thermal dust emission maps in polarization, and compare these to previous versions (Planck Collaboration XII 2014;Planck Collaboration IX 2016;Planck Collaboration X 2016).

        <p>The methodologies adopted in this paper mirror those used in earlier Planck releases, with only minor algorithmic updates and improvements. In particular, for CMB extraction we adopt the same four component-separation implementations used in earlier releases, namely 
            <rs type="software">Commander</rs>, 
            <rs type="software">NILC</rs>, 
            <rs type="software">SEVEM</rs>, and 
            <rs type="software">SMICA</rs>, each of which was initially selected as a representative of a particular class of algorithms(blind versus non-blind methods and pixel-based versus harmonic-based methods). In combination, they represent most approaches proposed in the literature. In the current release, all four CMB methods adopt the same data selection, based only on full-frequency Planck maps, in order to facilitate a direct comparison of the results. As in previous releases, we strongly suggest considering all four CMB maps in any higher-level map-based CMB analysis, in order to assess robustness with respect to algorithmic choices. We also provide again cleaned CMB maps at individual frequencies constructed by SEVEM. More specifically, in this release, intensity and polarization CMB maps are produced at four different frequencies from 70 to 217 GHz. These maps are particularly useful to test, for example, the robustness of results versus the presence of foregrounds and/or systematics. In addition, one fundamentally new data product is delivered in this release, namely a CMB temperature map generated by SMICA from which Sunyaev-Zeldovich(SZ) sources have been projected out. This can be used, for instance, in lensing studies (Planck Collaboration VIII 2020).

        <p>For astrophysical component separation, which depends inherently on explicit parametric modelling, we adopt Commander as our primary computational engine, mirroring the processing adopted in the two previous Planck releases. However, since the last release the internal mechanics of this code have been significantly re-written. Commander now allows for analysis of data sets with different angular resolutions at each frequency, and thereby allows for production of frequency maps at the full angular resolution of the data (Seljebotn et al. 2017). In addition, we employ both 
            <rs type="software">GNILC</rs> and 
            <rs type="software">SMICA</rs> for foreground reconstruction in the new release.

        <p>In previous releases the above model was fitted to the combination of Planck and external data using the Commander implementation described by Eriksen et al. (2008). This implementation adopted map-space pixels as its basis set for astrophysical foregrounds, for coding efficiency reasons. Although computationally fast, this approach has a significant limitation in that it requires all data sets under consideration to have the same angular resolution. Specifically, this implies that the angular resolution of the final output maps are limited to that of the lowest resolution frequency channel under consideration, which typically is 1 • FWHM for the combination of Planck, WMAP, and Haslam 408 MHz, which formed the basis of the previous astrophysically oriented foreground analysis. Higher-resolution products could then only be derived by dropping lower-resolution channels, which in turn carried a significant cost in terms of model fidelity.In previous releases the above model was fitted to the combination of Planck and external data using the Commander implementation described by Eriksen et al.

        <p>First, since amplitudes are modelled in harmonic space, it is computationally trivial to convolve with a separate instrumental beam transfer function at separate frequencies, so that for the first time we can solve for full-resolution signal models with multi-resolution data sets. Commander2 is thus able to produce a foreground model at native Planck resolution, limited only by the effective signal-to-noise ratio of each component. The computational cost is greater; however, as shown by Seljebotn et al. (2017), this is manageable with modern computers, even for Planck-sized data sets.First, since amplitudes are modelled in harmonic space, it is computationally trivial to convolve with a separate instrumental beam transfer function at separate frequencies, so that for the first time we can solve for full-resolution signal models with multi-resolution data sets.

        <p>Second, the new approach offers the option of imposing a prior on the foreground signal amplitudes in the form of an angular power spectrum.

        <p>Overall, from an algorithmic point of view the Commander2 implementation used in the current data release is more powerful than in previous releases. At the same time, there is also one important aspect of the Planck 2018 data release that limits our ability to perform a component separation as detailed as that in the 2015 analysis. As mentioned in Sect. 1, the Planck 2018 data set includes only full-frequency maps, not singlebolometer maps. For the Commander temperature analysis, this implies that a simpler foreground model must be employed than in the corresponding 2015 analysis. In the previous analysis we considered seven different physical components, namely CMB, synchrotron, free-free, spinning and thermal dust emission, a general line emission component at 95 and 100 GHz, and CO with individual components at 100, 217, and 353 GHz. Singledetector maps played a central part in constraining this rich model, in particular with respect to CO line emission. With the new and more limited data set, we instead adopt a similar model as employed in the 2013 analysis, which includes only four diffuse signal components in temperature, namely CMB, a single general low-frequency power-law component, thermal dust, and a single CO component with spatially constant line ratios between 100, 217, and 353 GHz. For polarization the model remains the same as in 2015, and includes only CMB, synchrotron, and thermal dust emission. The latter two components are as usual modelled in terms of simple power-law and modified blackbody SEDs, respectively.Overall, from an algorithmic point of view the Commander2 implementation used in the current data release is more powerful than in previous releases.

        <p>The above general specification provides a basic summary of the framework used for parametric fitting. However, there are still some free choices that must be made, the two most important of which are: (1) the angular resolution of the foreground spectral indices; and (2) the spatial priors imposed on the foreground amplitudes. For the spectral indices, we are primarily driven by signal-to-noise considerations, as adopting too high resolution for such parameters leads to an undesirable increase in noise in all components. In the temperature case, we adopt a smoothing scale of 40 FWHM for low-frequency foregrounds, slightly larger than the 30-GHz instrumental beam. For the dust spectral index, we adopt 10 FWHM, which is slightly larger than the 100-GHz beam. The dust temperature is fitted at the full Planck resolution of 5 FWHM of the frequencies between 217 and 857 GHz. For polarization, we fit only a spatially-constant spectral index for synchrotron,2 while for thermal dust emission, we fit the dust spectral index at 3 • FWHM. The dust temperature for the polarization model is fixed at the values derived in the intensity analysis, as the Planck 545-and 857-GHz frequency channels are unpolarized, and the Planck observations therefore do not constrain the thermal dust temperature in polarization.The above general specification provides a basic summary of the framework used for parametric fitting.

        <p>Finally, for spatial priors, we adopt minimally informative power-spectrum priors, defined simply as flat spectra in units of C ( +1)/2π for all components, with an amplitude that is larger than that observed in the high signal-to-noise regime. In addition, this flat spectrum is smoothly apodized at high multipoles in order to suppress ringing around bright compact objects. For the low-frequency temperature foreground and the CO line-emission components, the apodization is performed with a Gaussian beam with a FWHM roughly matching the dominant frequency for the respective component, while for thermal dust only a mild apodization is applied in the form of an exponentially-falling cut-off between = 5000 and 6000. For polarization, we apodize with Gaussian smoothing kernels, as in the low-frequency foreground and CO case. 3 Full details regarding these choices are summarized in Appendix A.Finally, for spatial priors, we adopt minimally informative power-spectrum priors, defined simply as flat spectra in units of C ( +1)/2π for all components, with an amplitude that is larger than that observed in the high signal-to-noise regime.

The overall goal of NILC is to extract the CMB component from multi-frequency observations while minimizing the contamination from Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds and instrumental noise. This is done by computing the linear combination of input maps that minimizes the variance in a basis spanned by a particular class of spherical wavelets called needlets (Narcowich et al. 2006). Needlets allow localized filtering in both pixel space and harmonic space. Localization in pixel space allows the weights of the linear combination to adapt to local conditions of foreground contamination and noise, whereas localization in harmonic space allows the method to favour foreground rejection on large scales and noise rejection on small scales. Needlets permit the weights to vary smoothly on large scales and rapidly on small scales, which is not possible by cutting the sky into zones prior to processing (Delabrouille et al. 2009). The NILC pipeline is applicable to scalar fields on the sphere, hence we work separately on maps of temperature and the E and B modes of polarization. The decomposition of input polarization maps into E and B is done on the full sky. At the end, the CMB Q and U maps are reconstructed from the E and B maps.

            <rs type="software">SEVEM</rs> (Leach et al. 2008a;Fernández-Cobos et al. 2012a) is an implementation of an internal template-cleaning approach in real space. It has been used in the previous Planck releases to produce clean CMB maps in both intensity and polarization, and has been demonstrated to provide robust results. A detailed description of the 
            <rs type="software">SEVEM</rs> pipeline can be found in Appendix C.
        </p>
        <p>The starting point for SEVEM is a set of internal templates typically constructed as difference maps between two neighboring Planck channels convolved to the same resolution, ensuring that the CMB signal vanishes. These templates trace the foreground contaminants at the corresponding frequency ranges. Next, a linear combination of such templates is then subtracted from some set of CMB-dominated frequency maps, typically 70 to 217 GHz for Planck. The coefficients of the linear fit are derived by minimizing the variance of the clean map outside a given mask. A final, co-added CMB map is obtained by combining individuallycleaned frequency maps in harmonic space.The starting point for SEVEM is a set of internal templates typically constructed as difference maps between two neighboring Planck channels convolved to the same resolution, ensuring that the CMB signal vanishes.

        <p>SEVEM is also able to produce cleaned CMB maps at specific channels. Individually-cleaned frequency CMB maps are useful to test the robustness of results versus the presence of foregrounds and/or systematics, for instance for isotropy and statistics estimators (Planck Collaboration XIV 2016) or the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect stacking analysis (Planck Collaboration XXI 2016). They are also valuable to construct crossfrequency estimators, which allow one to minimize the impact of certain types of systematic effects (e.g., possible correlated noise in data splits). In addition, they can be used to search for frequency-dependent effects in the CMB itself, such as those arising from relativistic boosting (Planck Collaboration XXVII 2014) or the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (Sunyaev &amp; Zeldovich 1970), although for this type of analysis the contribution of the templates (which would contain a certain level of any effect that is not constant with frequency) to the cleaned maps should be taken into account.SEVEM is also able to produce cleaned CMB maps at specific channels.

        <p>Since the 2015 release, we have introduced two significant improvements to the SEVEM pipeline for polarization. First, in the previous release we produced cleaned maps at three frequencies, 70, 100, and 143 GHz, and the final map was produced by combining the cleaned 100 and 143-GHz maps. However, given the improvements in the new Planck polarization data, we are now also able to robustly clean the 217-GHz channel map, and this is now included in the final combination. As a result, the signal-tonoise ratio of the cleaned SEVEM CMB polarization map is significantly improved with respect to the previous version. Second, in the updated pipeline, we now produce polarization maps at full resolution (N side = 2048), whereas in the last release all polarization maps were constructed at N side =1024. However, recognizing the fact that the 217-GHz channel is likely to be somewhat more susceptible to large-scale systematic residuals and calibration uncertainties due its higher foreground levels than the two lower frequencies (Planck Collaboration III 2020), we introduce at the same time a relative down-weighting of the 217-GHz channel on the largest scales. In summary, these modifications yield significantly improved SEVEM polarization maps, both in terms of the combined CMB map and individually cleaned frequency maps. Regarding intensity, the SEVEM pipeline is essentially identical to that used in the previous release; however, we now also provide a cleaned 70-GHz map in intensity. In addition to the final CMB map, SEVEM therefore now provides the complete set of {T, Q, U} CMB maps for each of the four frequency channels between 70 and 217 GHz.Since the 2015 release, we have introduced two significant improvements to the SEVEM pipeline for polarization.

        <p>Since the last release, changes have been introduced for both intensity and polarization maps. Starting with the temperature Article number, page 5 of 76 case, the most important change in this release is the introduction of hybrid CMB rendering, merging two different CMB maps produced independently by the 
            <rs type="software">SMICA pipeline</rs>. The first CMB map, X high , is designed to describe the cleanest region of the sky and intermediate-to-small angular scales. It is obtained from all six HFI channels using a foreground dimension of N fg = 4. The second CMB map, X full , is designed to describe the full sky and all harmonic scales. It includes all nine Planck frequency channels using a maximal foreground dimension of N fg = 8. The final hybrid CMB map X is then computed by merging X high and X full according to
        </p>
        <p>where P is a linear operator that smoothly removes large harmonic scales, and masks out an area close to the Galactic plane. Hence, in the resulting hybridized map, the multipoles of highest degree and the areas of highest Galactic latitude are provided by X high , while the remaining information is provided by X full . In practice, the hybridization operator P is implemented by highpass filtering in the harmonic domain (with a transfer function that smoothly transitions from 0 to 1 according to an arc-cosine function over the multipole range 50 ≤ ≤ 150), followed by multiplication by an apodized Galactic mask that is similar to the mask used at 100 GHz in the Planck 2018 likelihood (Plik) (see Planck Collaboration V 2020, for details). Hybridization of two CMB renderings has several benefits compared to using a single set of harmonic weights over all areas of the sky. First, the data suggest it: the SMICA weights are quite different if they are based on spectral statistics computed over the full sky rather than over a region with much lower foreground contamination. This is the rationale behind NILC, which extends the idea to many more than the two sky regions considered regions considered by SMICA. Second, the reason for leaving out the LFI channels in producing X high except at large angular scales is that SMICA would put very small weights on those channels (this is not the case when the weights are based on statistics computed for X full , as seen on Fig. 1 which shows a significant contribution from the 70-GHz channel). We could still include those channels and let SMICA automatically downweight them, but by excluding the channels with the lowest resolution, we avoid large, 'low-resolution' holes in the common point source mask, and therefore in the final CMB map. Finally, hybridization matches well the high-TT likelihood function in 
            <rs type="software">Plik</rs>, uses a low-foreground-contaminated fraction of the sky, does not include LFI channels, and involves only high frequency foregrounds. The spectral weights, w , for temperature (both full-sky and high latitudes) and polarization are shown in Fig. 1.

        <p>SMICA adopts its own relative calibration between frequency channels. In 2015, this process was applied to frequency channels from 44 to 353 GHz; however, since then we have found that the uncertainty in the 44-GHz channel was larger than expected, and that the previously reported value was inaccurate (see Fig. D.5). In the new release, we adopt a more conservative approach, and limit re-calibration to 70, 100, and 217 GHz, taking the 143-GHz channel as a reference; see Appendix D.1 for further details.SMICA adopts its own relative calibration between frequency channels.

        <p>For foreground separation, we conduct a separate fit using a foreground model of dimension N fg = 2, implicitly targeting synchrotron and dust emissions. The degeneracy of the SMICA foreground model (Eq. 5) can then be fixed by requesting that synchrotron (thermal dust) emission should be negligible at 353 GHz (30 GHz); Appendix D describes the implementation details. This analysis yields, without any other prior information, the angular spectra and emissivities of both foreground components and the corresponding synchrotron and dust maps. The results are summarized in Sect. 5. Note that in 2015, a foreground model at N fg = 2 dimensions for capturing synchrotron and thermal dust emissions was already explored, but no maps were released (although a dust comparison appeared in Planck Collaboration X 2016) because additional "foreground dimensions" were clearly needed to accommodate the systematic errors. In 2018, we use the same dimensions as in 2015 (a SMICA fit with maximal dimension for CMB cleaning and a SMICA fit with N fg = 2 for dust and synchrotron maps); however, contrary to 2015, the N fg = 2 fit yields a clean CMB reconstruction, almost as clean as when using the maximal foreground dimension.

        <p>The above four methods were the standard CMB extraction algorithms in each of the three Planck data releases. In this release, we also consider the Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (GNILC; Remazeilles et al. 2011b) method as a foreground extraction algorithm. GNILC is not designed to extract CMB information from the data. 4 GNILC is a wavelet-based component-separation method that generalizes the NILC method by exploiting not only the spectral information (SED) but also the spatial information (angular power spectra) from nonastrophysical components (cosmic infrared background, CIB, CMB, and instrumental noise) to extract clean estimates of the correlated emission from Galactic foregrounds, with reduced contamination from CIB, CMB, and noise. This additional spatial discriminator adopted by GNILC enables in particular disentanglement of emission components that suffer from spectral degeneracies, such as modified blackbody emissions like the CIB and Galactic dust. GNILC has been successfully applied to Planck 2015 intensity data to disentangle Galactic thermal dust emission and CIB anisotropies over the entire sky (Planck Collaboration Int. XLVIII 2016). In this paper, CMB and instrumental noise were also filtered out from the Planck GNILC dust intensity map by using the same strategy as for CIB removal.The above four methods were the standard CMB extraction algorithms in each of the three Planck data releases.

        <p>In this work, we apply GNILC to the Planck 2018 polarization data in order to extract the Stokes parameters Q and U of Galactic thermal dust polarization, while removing the contamination from CMB polarization and instrumental noise over the entire sky. I, Q, and U dust maps have been produced in a selfconsistent way by processing the seven Planck polarized channels (30 to 353 GHz). The reason for discarding the 545-and 857-GHz channels is as follows. The main characteristic of the GNILC method is to estimate the local number of independent foreground degrees of freedom over the sky and over angular scales. The estimated dimension of the foreground subspace depends on the local signal-to-noise ratio in the 9 × 9 (intensity) or 7 × 7 (polarization) observation space of the frequency-byfrequency data covariance matrix. In some parts of sky where the data are found by GNILC to be fully compatible with CIB, CMB, and noise at small angular scales, the dimension of the Galactic foreground subspace can go down to zero. The result of this is that the GNILC dust products have a variable resolution over the sky, with the local FWHM fully determined and publicly released (Planck Collaboration Int. XLVIII 2016). However, because of decorrelation effects, the local dimension of the foreground subspace found by GNILC will be larger in a 9-dimensional space of observations than in a 7dimensional space of observations , so that the effective local resolution of the GNILC dust products will be different over the sky for intensity and polarization. For the purpose of polarization fraction studies in the 2018 release (Planck Collaboration XII 2020), we prefer to have the same local resolution over the sky both for intensity and polarization, hence our choice of processing with GNILC the same data set for I, Q, and U, namely the seven Planck polarized channels .In this work, we apply GNILC to the Planck 2018 polarization data in order to extract the Stokes parameters Q and U of Galactic thermal dust polarization, while removing the contamination from CMB polarization and instrumental noise over the entire sky.

        <p>A particularly important problem for both LFI and HFI with respect to polarization reconstruction is bandpass mismatch between multiple detectors within a single frequency channel. The issue may be summarized as follows. In order to solve for both temperature and linear polarization in each pixel on the sky, a total of three parameters per pixel, it is necessary to include information from at least three polarization-sensitive detectors in any given mapmaking operation. The polarization signal is estimated by taking pairwise differences between the signals observed by these detectors, while accounting for the relative orientation of their polarization detector angles at any given time. However, there are other effects in addition to true sky polarization signals that may induce effective signal differences between detectors. The largest of these is different effective bandpasses. Since each detector has a slightly different frequency response function, each detector observes a slightly different foreground signal. Unless explicitly accounted for during mapmaking, these differences create a spurious polarization signal in the maps.A particularly important problem for both LFI and HFI with respect to polarization reconstruction is bandpass mismatch between multiple detectors within a single frequency channel.

The polarization signal is estimated by taking pairwise differences between the signals observed by these detectors, while accounting for the relative orientation of their polarization detector angles at any given time. However, there are other effects in addition to true sky polarization signals that may induce effective signal differences between detectors. The largest of these is different effective bandpasses. Since each detector has a slightly different frequency response function, each detector observes a slightly different foreground signal. Unless explicitly accounted for during mapmaking, these differences create a spurious polarization signal in the maps.</p>
        <p>In the LFI mapmaking procedure, this effect is accounted for in two different ways, as described in Planck Collaboration II (2020). First, for gain estimation, an iterative scheme is established, in which a proper foreground model is derived jointly with the sky maps using Commander. Each iteration of this procedure consists of three individual steps. First, a gain model is established for each radiometer, accounting for the orbital and Solar dipoles as well as astrophysical foregrounds as estimated by Commander. Second, frequency maps are derived based on this gain model using 
            <rs type="software">MADAM</rs> (Keihänen et al. 2005;Planck 
            <rs type="creator">Collaboration</rs> VI 2016), a well-established destriper. Third, these frequency maps are used by Commander to derive a new foreground model. A total of four such iterations are used to derive the final LFI maps; however, even after these iterations there may be non-negligible large-scale residuals present in the 70-GHz sky map, as described by Planck Collaboration II (2020). To account for this, a gain correction template, based on differences between consecutive iterations, is subtracted from the final LFI 70-GHz map, with an amplitude derived from a low-resolution likelihood fit (Planck Collaboration V 2020). These procedures account for biases in the time-variable gain solutions; however, they do not remove direct temperature-to-polarization leakage from bandpass mismatch. That effect, which is stationary on the sky, is corrected through use of static templates, as described in detail in Planck Collaboration II (2016). The same procedure is applied to the LFI sky maps in the current release with an updated foreground model (Planck Collaboration II 2020).

        <p>For HFI a different but related approach is adopted. The 2015 Commander temperature model is used to explicitly adjust the effective bandpass response of all bolometers within a frequency channel, by subtracting a small fraction of each foreground signal (thermal dust, free-free, and CO emission, but not synchrotron or spinning dust emission) from the individual bolometer timestreams. These "foreground-equalized" timestreams are then combined into a single frequency map by standard destriping. Since only a spin-0 temperature signal is subtracted in this procedure, the resulting polarization maps are unbiased with respect to foreground leakage, to the extent that the foreground model is accurate. However, the resulting temperature maps will be very slightly biased, in the sense that the predicted bandpass response of a given map does not perfectly match the observed signal, and this causes complications for any method that explicitly employs such information. In the current paper, this applies to Commander and GNILC. The three remaining methods (NILC, SEVEM and SMICA) do not explicitly use such information.For HFI a different but related approach is adopted.

        <p>An additional complication arises from the updated 2018 HFI mapmaking procedure, due to the fact that the singlebolometer maps produced by the latest processing are not reliable for component-separation purposes (Planck Collaboration III 2020). Since the CO emission lines are very narrow, their measured amplitudes are very sensitive to small variations in bandpass shape between individual detectors. In 2015, this sensitivity was exploited to extract line-emission maps at each of the affected frequencies. However, since single-bolometer maps are not available in 2018, this is no longer possible. The new processing represents a conscious choice of optimizing the polarization extraction at non-negligible expense in terms of our ability to perform high-fidelity astrophysical foreground reconstruction with temperature maps. For individual foreground components in temperature, we therefore recommend continued usage of the Planck 2015 data products.An additional complication arises from the updated 2018 HFI mapmaking procedure, due to the fact that the singlebolometer maps produced by the latest processing are not reliable for component-separation purposes (Planck Collaboration III 2020).

        <p>To summarize the overall data selection, all diffuse component separation codes except GNILC employ all nine Planck frequency maps between 30 and 857 GHz in temperature, and all seven frequency maps between 30 and 353 GHz in polarization, for the 2018 analysis. GNILC uses only the seven lowest frequencies in temperature in order to match the polarization analysis. For the LFI polarization maps, we apply a set of template corrections that account for bandpass mismatch and gain corrections, as described in Planck Collaboration II (2020), while no additional corrections are applied to the HFI maps.

        <p>In addition to the raw frequency maps, each method requires various degrees of knowledge about the Planck instrument itself. The most important characterization is the beam response of the individual frequency channels. These have been updated to reflect the latest changes in the data processing pipelines, and are described in Planck Collaboration II (2020) and Planck Collaboration III (2020). We note that in the 2015 data release, CMB polarization maps for two of the methods (Commander and SEVEM) were given at 10 FWHM, compared to 5 FWHM for the temperature maps; however, in this release all CMB maps in both polarization and temperature are provided at the maximum angular resolution of 5 FWHM.In addition to the raw frequency maps, each method requires various degrees of knowledge about the Planck instrument itself.

        <p>Each CMB map must also be associated with a statistical characterization of the instrumental noise. For this purpose, we compute and analyse null maps derived from subsets of the full data set, as done in earlier releases. In the previous release, we focused on half-mission splits, yearly splits, and half-ring splits (Planck Collaboration IX 2016). In the current release, we drop the yearly split, since this behaves similarly to the half-mission split, and we replace the half-ring split with a so-called "oddeven" split, in which scanning rings from HFI are grouped according to odd or even pointing IDs. The odd-even split nullifies long-time-correlated signals, similarly to the half-ring split, but suffers less from inter-ring correlations. For LFI, we still adopt the same half-ring split as in 2015, but nevertheless refer to this split as "odd-even," recognizing the different signal-tonoise ratios of the LFI and HFI maps. We consider this to be our best instrumental noise tracer among the splits, whereas the halfmission split represents the best instrumental systematics tracer. Simulations including either pure CMB signal or the sum of instrumental noise and residual systematics are individually propagated through each analysis pipeline, and these simulations form the basis of all subsequent goodness-of-fit tests.Each CMB map must also be associated with a statistical characterization of the instrumental noise.

        <p>As described in Planck Collaboration III (2020), the HFI polarization frequency maps are associated with a significant uncertainty regarding polarization efficiencies, corresponding in effect to an uncertainty in the overall calibration of the Stokes Q and U maps. Ideally, such polarization efficiencies would be perfectly accounted for during mapmaking. However, as reported by Planck Collaboration V (2020), a cosmological analysis of power spectra of the individual frequency maps suggests that small but notable residual calibration uncertainties may remain in a few channels. The reported best-fit correction values are +0.7 ± 1.0 % (100 GHz), -1.7 ± 1.0 % (143 GHz), and +1.9 ± 1.0 % (217 GHz). For 353 GHz, the foreground contribution is too large to allow a robust CMB-based measurement. These corrections are only marginally statistically significant, therefore we do not apply them by default in this paper. Instead, we compute results with and without the corrections, and report the difference between the two solutions as a known systematic error. For the CMB, we find that the differences due to polarization efficiency uncertainties are small, while for polarized foregrounds, we find that the inclusion of polarization efficiencies changes the spectral index of thermal dust by ∆β d = -0.03. See Sect. 5 for details.As described in Planck Collaboration III (2020), the HFI polarization frequency maps are associated with a significant uncertainty regarding polarization efficiencies, corresponding in effect to an uncertainty in the overall calibration of the Stokes Q and U maps.

        <p>As described in Planck Collaboration III (2020), the HFI split maps contain a non-negligible number of unobserved pixels at the full N side = 2048 HEALPix resolution. These are pixels that were either never seen by any bolometer at a given frequency, or for which the polarization angle coverage is too poor to support a reliable decomposition into the three Stokes parameters. For most methods considered in this paper, 6 such unobserved pixels represent a notable algorithmic problem, and must be treated before analysis. For these methods, we simply replace all unobserved pixels in a given frequency map by the same pixels in a corresponding map downgraded to a HEALPix resolution of N side = 64, corresponding to a pixel size of 55 . Of course, this procedure introduces correlations between neighbouring unobserved pixels, and we therefore mask all high-resolution pixels after the analysis; separate masks for each data split are provided to account for this effect. The details of how the unobserved pixel mask has been generated are described in Sect. 4.2. Finally, to account for possible leakage from unobserved to observed pixels during inter-analysis smoothing operations, we apply the same procedure to the reference simulations described below. 6 Commander behaves differently from the other codes with respect to unobserved pixels. It applies per-pixel inverse noise weighting per frequency channel, and unobserved pixels in a given channel are simply given zero weight in the parametric fits.As described in Planck Collaboration III (2020), the HFI split maps contain a non-negligible number of unobserved pixels at the full N side = 2048 HEALPix resolution.

        <p>Starting with the LFI 30-GHz difference maps, two effects stand out. At high latitudes, we see broad stripes following the Planck scanning pattern. These are due to an improved time-varying gain calibration procedure in the 2018 analysis that takes into account astrophysical foregrounds as computed by Commander, in an iterative gain-estimation→mapmaking→component-separation procedure. This new iterative scheme is one of the main new fea-tures of the LFI 2018 processing pipeline (Planck Collaboration II 2020). A second effect is seen in the Galactic plane, where the 2018 amplitude is lower by about 0.2 % compared to 2015. This is due to re-estimation of the overall absolute calibration, due to a new estimate of the Solar CMB dipole (Planck Collaboration I 2020).Starting with the LFI 30-GHz difference maps, two effects stand out.

        <p>Similar considerations hold for the 44-GHz channel, although with a significantly lower striping level.

        <p>In the new HFI processing, thermal dust emission is explicitly included in the dipole estimation model, resulting in improved consistency in the dipole estimates among the various frequency channels. As a result of this process, the best-fit 2018 dipole estimate changed by 2.4 µK relative to 2015, and this is visually apparent in the 100-GHz raw difference map. In addition, we see significant striping in the fractional difference map, with an amplitude of more than 3 % of the foreground level at high latitudes. As is the case for LFI, these stripes are due to improved time-variable gain estimation, which in turn is responsible for the overall improvement in the large-scale polarization reconstruction. Of course, for this channel the absolute foreground levels are low at high Galactic latitudes, and a 3 % relative difference corresponds only to 1-2 µK in absolute value. For temperature this is small, while for polarization it is highly relevant, as we discuss below.In the new HFI processing, thermal dust emission is explicitly included in the dipole estimation model, resulting in improved consistency in the dipole estimates among the various frequency channels.

        <p>Qualitatively speaking, similar considerations hold for the 143 and 217-GHz channels as well. However, in these cases we see an additional effect, namely a significantly blue Galactic plane in the fractional difference map, indicating relative absolute differences of about 1 % in the high signal-to-noise regime. At first sight, this may appear puzzling, since the absolute CMB calibration between the 2018 and 2015 has changed by less than 0.1 % (Planck Collaboration V 2020). The explanation is the new HFI treatment of bandpass differences among individual bolometers. As described in Sect. 3, each frequency map is now generated as the sum over all bolometer timestreams within that frequency channel, each of which has been bandpass equalized prior to co-addition. This equalization is implemented by fitting 
            <rs type="software">Commander</rs> foreground templates of thermal dust, CO, and freefree emission jointly with other instrumental parameters, with the goal of minimizing inter-bolometer bandpass differences that otherwise generate spurious polarization contamination.
        </p>
        <p>For component-separation purposes, this implies that the overall bandpass profile of each HFI frequency channel has changed. Furthermore, this process also leads to a complicated bandpass definition overall, in which the bandpass in principle is component dependent. While thermal dust, free-free, and CO emission are associated with bandpasses given as straight averages of the individual bolometer bandpasses (due to their inclusion in the bandpass equalization procedure), synchrotron, spinning dust, and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich signals are associated with inverse noise-variance-weighted bandpasses as in earlier releases. In practice, though, we adopt the straight averaged bandpasses for all HFI channels in the current release, since the affected non-equalized components are sub-dominant at HFI frequencies, and implementing multi-bandpass integration would require significant algorithm re-structuring. However, this is also one of the reasons why we do not release new individual synchrotron and spinning dust products in temperature in the current release.For component-separation purposes, this implies that the overall bandpass profile of each HFI frequency channel has changed.

        <p>Turning to the 353-GHz frequency channel, two additional effects are seen. First, at high latitudes one can see a weak imprint of zodiacal light emission (Planck Collaboration XIV 2014) in the fractional difference map, taking the form of a blue band along the Ecliptic plane with an amplitude of 1 %. Second, we also see two deep blue bands on either side of the Galactic plane with amplitudes of 2 %; these are due to changes in the 353-GHz transfer function. From such difference maps alone, it is of course impossible to conclude whether the additional residuals are due to defects in the 2015 or 2018 maps. On the other hand, such structures tend to stand out quite prominently in maps of foreground spectral indices, which in essence measure small differentials between frequencies. Thus, through subsequent Commander-type astrophysical analyses, we find that these two 353-GHz effects are indeed present in the 2018 maps, and not in the corresponding 2015 maps. These residual effects, along with the lack of single-bolometer maps, are thus part of the cost of producing as clean polarization maps as possible, which is the primary goal of the current data release.Turning to the 353-GHz frequency channel, two additional effects are seen.

        <p>At 545 and 857 GHz, most of the effects are similar to those described above, with one additional effect for the 857-GHz channel, where residual sidelobe contamination dominates the high-latitude residuals, with amplitudes of 2-3 % of the full foreground signal. In this case, the 2018 processing represents an absolute improvement over the 2015 processing, in the sense that the full 2018 frequency map has lower sidelobe contamination than the corresponding 2015 frequency map. At the same time, it is worth noting that single-bolometer maps are available in the 2015 release, and the 857-2 bolometer map has significantly lower sidelobe contamination than any of the other three (Planck Collaboration X 2016). Thus, if a given scientific analysis does not require the signal-to-noise ratio of the full 857-GHz channel, the Planck 2015 857-2 bolometer channel may be an even better choice than the full 857-GHz 2018 frequency map.

        <p>As expected, the various features seen in the polarization difference maps trace those observed in the corresponding temperature differences. For 30 and 44 GHz, the main features at high latitudes are due to bandpass mismatch and time-variable gain corrections, achieved by iterating between gain estimation, mapmaking and component separation. For 70 GHz, only very small differences are seen, since the gain estimation procedure is unchanged from 2015; however, it is important to note that a separate residual gain template has been produced for this channel, and this is applied in the scientific processing (see Planck Collaboration II 2020).As expected, the various features seen in the polarization difference maps trace those observed in the corresponding temperature differences.

        <p>For the HFI channels, we see similar effects of improved effective gain estimation at high latitudes, as well as improved bandpass corrections at low latitudes, in particular for 100, 217, and 353 GHz, which are strongly affected by CO emission. Most strikingly, the low-latitude structures seen in the 100-GHz map are typical examples of temperature-to-polarization leakage, where the CO morphology is modulated by the scanning orientation of the Planck satellite. At 353 GHz, we additionally see the residual effect of transfer-function convolution near the Galactic plane in Stokes U. Thus, caution is warranted when studying polarized thermal dust emission near the Galactic plane with this frequency map.For the HFI channels, we see similar effects of improved effective gain estimation at high latitudes, as well as improved bandpass corrections at low latitudes, in particular for 100, 217, and 353 GHz, which are strongly affected by CO emission.

        <p>To summarize, we observe typically (at most) 2-3 % differences between the 2015 and 2018 frequency maps at high latitudes, as measured in units of foreground signal. In most cases, these differences are directly due to improvements in the updated The Galactic plane region in the SMICA maps results from a pre-processing step (masking and diffusive inpainting of a narrow Galactic region in all frequency channels), while no masks are applied to the other maps.

        <p>The instrumental noise characteristics of the Planck observations are complex, and a simple white-noise approximation is inadequate for high-precision analyses of these data. The only realistic approach to handling both instrumental noise and residual sys-tematics is through end-to-end simulations.

        <p>In the polarization maps, however, we can identify several notable artefacts already at this stage, which prospective future users of these maps need to be aware of. The visually most striking features are of course residual foreground contamination in the Galactic plane. In particular, the alternating sign along the plane is a classic signature of temperature-to-polarization leakage, and the Planck data set is particularly sensitive to residual CO emission in this respect. These features are extremely difficult to suppress to the level of the CMB fluctuations during processing, and must in practice be removed by standard Galactic masking.In the polarization maps, however, we can identify several notable artefacts already at this stage, which prospective future users of these maps need to be aware of.

        <p>The second most striking feature in the polarization maps is a blue stripe in the upper right quadrant of the Stokes U map. This stripe corresponds to a few bad scanning rings that ideally should have been removed by flagging during mapmaking. Unfortunately, this issue was not caught at a sufficiently early stage of the processing, and remains in the final maps. We therefore mask this stripe in the same way that we mask Galactic residuals. Third, and somewhat less obvious, we observe broad largescale structures in both Stokes Q and U that are aligned with the Planck scanning strategy. These structures are effectively due to gain-modelling uncertainties coupled to monopole and dipole leakage, and corresponding features are present in the associated simulations. In principle, therefore, these need not be removed prior to subsequent analyses, as long as the appropriate simulations are used to quantify all relevant uncertainties. In practice, however, we note that these modes are associated with significant additional systematic uncertainties, and we therefore caution against over-interpretation of the very largest scales in these maps. In particular, we warn against employing these maps for auto-correlation type analysis, unless the statistic of choice is explicitly shown to be robust against this type of systematic effect, based on end-to-end simulations.The second most striking feature in the polarization maps is a blue stripe in the upper right quadrant of the Stokes U map.

        <p>Starting with Commander, the most striking difference is a dark blue Galactic plane residual with a clear CO-like morphology. This reflects the fact that it is more difficult for the parametric Commander pipeline to estimate CO emission from co-added frequency maps (as in the 2018 processing) than with individual bolometer maps (as in the 2015 processing). For this reason, the Commander map adopts a larger Galactic mask in the new release than in the previous one, specifically targeting CO emission; see Appendix A for further details. The second most notable feature in the Commander difference map is a 2 µK blue signal at intermediate latitude with a thermal dust imprint, and this is due to the changes in bandpass modelling in the high-frequency channels.Starting with Commander, the most striking difference is a dark blue Galactic plane residual with a clear CO-like morphology.

        <p>For SMICA, three qualitatively different types of differences are seen. First, the weak large-scale background pattern is similar to that observed in NILC, and simply reflects the slight changes in input data discussed above. In addition, we see significant changes in the compact sources that can be explained by the change of masking strategy described in Sect. 2. Third and finally, the strong near-Galactic-plane differences that include free-free sources (e.g., the Gum Nebula and Rho Ophucius) are explained by the miscalibration of the 44-GHz channel in the 2015 released map (as recalled in Sect. 2). The impact of this issue is assessed in Appendix D.For SMICA, three qualitatively different types of differences are seen.

        <p>From the above discussion, it is clear that significant residuals are present in the CMB maps, in particular close to the Galactic plane. Therefore, appropriate masking is required for scientific exploration of the Planck 2018 maps in both temperature and polarization, as in earlier releases.

        <p>In previous releases, a common mask was generated simply as the product of the individual confidence masks derived for each pipeline. However, the pipeline masks were established using qualitatively different criteria in each case, and a direct comparison was therefore non-trivial. In the current analysis, we adopt a more direct route, starting with the inter-pipeline standard deviation maps shown in Fig. 8. The single most striking feature in these maps is the Galactic plane. At high latitudes, one can additionally see point sources and a few rings in the Planck scanning strategy that were observed fewer times than average, resulting in coherent stripes of excess variance.In previous releases, a common mask was generated simply as the product of the individual confidence masks derived for each pipeline.

        <p>The resulting mask ensures that only pixels for which the four pipelines agree in their CMB solutions to better than 3 µK in standard deviation on large scales (10 µK on small scales) are allowed in the final analysis. However, quantitative agreement among codes is only a necessary criterion; it is not sufficient. We therefore augment this mask by the absolute individual con-fidence masks of Commander and SEVEM (see Appendices A and C for details), by the point-source masks used for inpainting by SEVEM and SMICA, and by the processing mask employed by SMICA. The first two of these employ χ 2 and difference maps to define their acceptable regions, and thereby correspond to standard absolute goodness-of-fit statistics, while the latter two correspond to basic processing masks. The SEVEM inpainted pointsource mask is constructed from point sources detected in the 143-and 217-GHz channels, and is described in detail in Appendix C (see also Fig. C.5).

        <p>We adopt a similar procedure for polarization, but with a few notable additions. First, the inter-pipeline standard deviation map evaluated at 80 FWHM is thresholded at 1 µK. The resulting mask is smoothed to 5 • FWHM, and thresholded at a value of 0.9, effectively expanding the original mask by a few degrees in all directions. This mask is then multiplied with a corresponding mask derived by thresholding at 0.6 µK the original standard deviation map at 80 FWHM, to remove sharper features. We then exclude all pixels flagged by the Commander and SEVEM confidence masks. Next, we remove the region contaminated by cosmic rays discussed in Sect. 4.1, as defined in Ecliptic coordinates following Planck's scanning path. Third, as an additional guard against temperature-to-polarization leakage from CO emission, we exclude any pixels for which the CO emission at 100 GHz (see Sect. 5) is brighter than 20 µK, evaluated at a smoothing scale of 5 • FWHM. Isolated "islands" in the main Galactic plane are then removed with the same procedure as for temperature. Finally, we also add the point-source masks used for inpainting by SEVEM and SMICA. For polarization, the SEVEM inpainted point-source mask is constructed from point sources detected in the 100-, 143-, and 217-GHz channels and is shown in As discussed in Sect. 3.3, the half-mission and odd-even split maps contain a number of unobserved or poorly conditioned pixels. For split-map analysis, we therefore recommend additional unobserved pixel masks. These are produced by thresholding the 3 × 3 Stokes parameter condition number hit-count maps produced during mapmaking (Planck Collaboration II 2020; Planck Collaboration III 2020). The resulting unobserved pixel mask is further extended in a three-step iterative process in which the neighbours of each unobserved pixel have been masked.

        <p>As a final mask-related issue, we note that the Planck 2018 product delivery includes Wiener-filtered versions of each pipeline map, in which all high-foreground regions are replaced with a Gaussian constrained realization. For temperature, these regions are defined simply by thresholding the maximum difference between any of the four cleaned CMB maps at 100 µK, and additionally removing all pixels excluded by the SMICA processing mask. This mask is shown in Fig. 10, and excludes 2 % of the sky. For polarization inpainting we conservatively adopt the common confidence mask defined above. In either case, we note that the inpainted CMB maps are primarily intended for publication and presentation purposes, rather than scientific analysis. For full scientific analysis of the high-foreground-contaminated regions, we recommend corresponding processing of end-to-end simulations. These are, however, not provided due to large data volume and processing costs, although they may be generated by applying a Wiener filter code such as

        <p>As noted in Sect. 2, all Planck 2018 CMB maps have a common nominal target resolution of 5 FWHM, as output by each of the respective pipelines. However, this resolution is not exact, as it does not take into account the effect of spatially-varying asymmetric beams on the sky. The nominal 5 beam kernel must therefore be corrected by an effective transfer function for each pipeline prior to any harmonic space analysis of these maps, including cosmological power spectrum and parameter estimation.As noted in Sect. 2, all Planck 2018 CMB maps have a common nominal target resolution of 5 FWHM, as output by each of the respective pipelines.

        <p>We estimate the effective transfer functions from the CMB signal-only simulations discussed in Sect. 3.5 through the following expression,We estimate the effective transfer functions from the CMB signal-only simulations discussed in Sect. 3.5 through the following expression,</p>
        <p>where C out and C in denote the simulated output and input power spectra of each CMB signal realization. The former includes both instrumental beam and pixel window convolution, while the latter includes neither. The quantity b 5 denotes the beam transfer function of a 5 FWHM Gaussian beam, p 2048 is the N side = 2048 pixel window (Górski et al. 2005), and brackets indicate an average over 50 simulations. Equation 9 is evaluated independently for temperature and both E-and B-mode polarization. Finally, each transfer function is smoothed with a third-order Savitzky-Golay filter with a window size of ∆ = 51 to reduce residual uncertainty from the finite number of Monte Carlo simulations. The examples shown in this paper correspond to full-sky transfer functions; these functions should in principle be re-evaluated for each sky fraction used in a given analysis. 10The resulting transfer functions are shown in Fig. 11. Starting with the temperature case, we first note that the range spanned by the four curves is well within ±0.5 %, and, there-fore, these effects are quite minor for all the considered multipoles. Overall, qualitatively similar behaviour is observed for the four codes, with Commander showing a slightly larger deviation. In particular, for Commander, we see that the effective residual transfer function is very close to unity up to ≈ 700, after which it starts to fall off, eventually reaching an amplitude of about 0.3 % at ≈ 2000, before it begins to rise sharply. The small excess of 0.1% around = 500 is associated with the effective cut-off of the LFI-dominated low-frequency signal component employed by Commander. These general trends are due to small mismatches between the full asymmetric beams, as implemented through pixel-space FEBeCoP (Mitra et al. 2011) convolutions, and the azimuthally symmetric effective beam transfer functions, as implemented with QuickBeam (Hivon et al. 2017). For instance, a fall-off of 0.3 % at ≈ 2000 corresponds to a mismatch of about 0.05 FWHM in the two models. Further, we note that Commander is the only code that applies per-pixel inverse variance weighting of the raw frequency maps, and as such it has a different response to small angular scales than the other codes.where C out and C in denote the simulated output and input power spectra of each CMB signal realization. The former includes both instrumental beam and pixel window convolution, while the latter includes neither. The quantity b 5 denotes the beam transfer function of a 5 FWHM Gaussian beam, p 2048 is the N side = 2048 pixel window (Górski et al. 2005), and brackets indicate an average over 50 simulations. Equation 9 is evaluated independently for temperature and both E-and B-mode polarization. Finally, each transfer function is smoothed with a third-order Savitzky-Golay filter with a window size of ∆ = 51 to reduce residual uncertainty from the finite number of Monte Carlo simulations. The examples shown in this paper correspond to full-sky transfer functions; these functions should in principle be re-evaluated for each sky fraction used in a given analysis. 10The resulting transfer functions are shown in Fig. 11.

        <p>Turning our attention to the E-mode transfer functions, the most striking new feature is a pattern of systematic wiggles. These are seen both in transfer functions derived from each frequency alone (shown as dotted lines) and in the componentseparated maps. These wiggles are due to temperature-topolarization leakage through the asymmetric beam shapes, and the positions of the peaks coincide with the peaks in the CMB temperature power spectrum. Note that most of the total weight below ≈ 300 is determined by the 143-GHz channel, while above ≈ 300 it is dominated by the 217-GHz channel. The 100-GHz channel does not dominate at any angular scale, due to its lower angular resolution and higher noise as compared to the 143-GHz channel.Turning our attention to the E-mode transfer functions, the most striking new feature is a pattern of systematic wiggles.

        <p>Similar considerations apply to the B-mode transfer functions, although in this case the wiggles are largely dominated by an increasing trend caused by a wide range of both temperatureto-polarization and polarization-to-polarization leakage effects. Overall, however, the net sum of all these effects is smaller than 10 % of the underlying (lensing-induced) B-mode signal up to 1600. We also see that the component-separated map is strongly dominated by the 217-GHz channel for 500.Similar considerations apply to the B-mode transfer functions, although in this case the wiggles are largely dominated by an increasing trend caused by a wide range of both temperatureto-polarization and polarization-to-polarization leakage effects.

        <p>Our first noise measure is defined in terms of the so-called odd-even half-difference (OEHD) maps, in which the full timeordered data volume is divided according to odd and even ring numbers. This is a fine-grained time split, and as such, the OEHD map tends to cancel most systematic effects. This noise measure is thus our cleanest probe of pure instrumental (white and correlated) noise. OEHD maps are plotted in Appendix G.1 for each pipeline and for each of the three Stokes parameters. Overall, we see that these difference maps exhibit very few visually-apparent systematic effects at high latitudes, and the only significant residuals occur in the Galactic centre, where the overall signal amplitude is very larget.Our first noise measure is defined in terms of the so-called odd-even half-difference (OEHD) maps, in which the full timeordered data volume is divided according to odd and even ring numbers.

        <p>Our second noise measure is defined in terms of the halfmission half-difference (HMHD) maps, in which the time-ordered data are split according to long time periods, defined by years (Planck Collaboration II 2020;Planck Collaboration III 2020). This measure is thus a coarse-grained time split, and more sensitive to systematic effects that vary on long time scales, such as gain variations or sidelobe contamination. This is our preferred estimate for the combined impact of instrumental noise and systematic effects. HMHD maps are shown in Appendix G.2 for each pipeline and for each of the three Stokes parameters. In these maps, we clearly see the imprint of the Galactic plane, which is largely caused by calibration uncertainties, as well as more pronounced scan-aligned structures at high latitudes.Our second noise measure is defined in terms of the halfmission half-difference (HMHD) maps, in which the time-ordered data are split according to long time periods, defined by years (Planck Collaboration II 2020;Planck Collaboration III 2020).

        <p>The third noise measure comprises the full-blown end-to-end simulations, in which all known systematics have been modelled to the best of our ability (see Planck Collaboration II (2020) and Planck Collaboration III (2020) for full details). These simulations are generated as raw time-ordered data, and processed through each step of the analysis pipeline, including map making and component separation. Unfortunately, this process is computationally very expensive, and only a limited set of 300 realizations has been produced for the current release. However, for each realization a full set of results are produced, including full mission maps, half-mission and odd-even splits. Combined, these form the basis of most goodness-of-fit statistics presented in the following sections.The third noise measure comprises the full-blown end-to-end simulations, in which all known systematics have been modelled to the best of our ability (see Planck Collaboration II (2020) and Planck Collaboration III (2020) for full details).

        <p>For full-mission temperature data, we find that the CMBplus-noise simulations agree well with the data in terms of angular power up to 750. At higher multipoles, we see a slow increase in power up to ≈ 2000, corresponding to a positive contribution from point sources not included in the simulations. The level of point-source residuals is highest in Commander and lowest in SMICA. At high multipoles, 2000, the spectra turn over. As described in Planck Collaboration III (2020), the power in the HFI simulations for the 100-217 GHz channels underestimates the true noise in the real data by a few percent (with variations depending both on angular scale and frequency), and this translates into a negative bias at high multipoles in the cleaned CMB maps presented in this paper.For full-mission temperature data, we find that the CMBplus-noise simulations agree well with the data in terms of angular power up to 750.

In these cases, the simulations agree well with the data up to 200, after which a negative bias of a few percent is observed in the range 200 500. Then, in the range 500 1500 the agreement is good, before we see the same negative high-bias as in the temperature case.

        <p>In Fig. 13 we focus on the first two multipoles, and compare the observed power to the full simulated distributions in terms of cumulative distribution functions. Overall, we observe acceptable statistical agreement between the data and simulations at these largest scales, with only a few points showing extreme values of 0 or 1; however, even in these cases the observed values lie just at the edge of the simulated histogram. No large outliers are observed. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the effective noise varies greatly between the various analysis pipelines, and it is therefore essential to compare any given data set with its corresponding simulations.In Fig. 13 we focus on the first two multipoles, and compare the observed power to the full simulated distributions in terms of cumulative distribution functions.

        <p>To summarize, the end-to-end simulations presented and employed in this paper exhibit power biases of several percent with respect to the true observations on intermediate and small scales, while reasonable agreement is observed on large angular scales. These biases originate from corresponding discrepancies at the level of individual frequency bands, as reported in Planck Collaboration II 2020 and Planck Collaboration III 2020. When employing these simulations for scientific analysis, it is impor-tant to verify that the statistic of choice is not sensitive to such percentage-level differences. This will usually be the case for linear or cross-correlation type analyses, but not necessarily for quadratic or auto-correlation type analyses.To summarize, the end-to-end simulations presented and employed in this paper exhibit power biases of several percent with respect to the true observations on intermediate and small scales, while reasonable agreement is observed on large angular scales.

        <p>A complementary consistency measure is given by the total variance as measured in pixel space at different pixel resolutions (see, e.g., Monteserín et al. 2008;Cruz et al. 2011;Planck Collaboration XVI 2016). This method normalizes the map with respect to the total variance of the signal plus noise, where the noise variance is estimated through the simulations described above, and the variance of the signal is determined as the value that gives a normalized map variance equal to unity. For the HMHD and OEHD maps, the method simplifies, since the CMB signal is cancelled through the half-difference calculation.A complementary consistency measure is given by the total variance as measured in pixel space at different pixel resolutions (see, e.g., Monteserín et al. 2008;Cruz et al. 2011;Planck Collaboration XVI 2016).

        <p>Recognizing the fact that Planck polarization maps are generally noise dominated, we apply the methods described in Planck Collaboration VIII (2020) cross-estimates for the variance, which is the result of the subtraction between the variance of the Q 2 + U 2 signal-plus-noise map and the variance of the Q 2 N + U 2 N noise estimated from the MC simulations. For both temperature and polarization, we employ the respective union masks described above.

        <p>In Fig. 14 we plot the percentage of simulations with a lower variance than the real data, as a function of pixel resolution. The results from this analysis are in good agreement with those found in the power spectrum analysis. In temperature we find a generally good consistency between real data and half difference noise simulations, with few exceptions. We find that only a few simulations have a lower variance for the HMHD Commander map at very large scales and for the OEHD SEVEM map at intermediate resolutions. At the maximum resolution of N side = 2048, there is a lack of compatibility with MC simulations for both HMHD and OEHD maps, showing that at high resolution noise in temperature data is poorly described by the simulations. However, given the very high signal-to-noise ratio of the Planck temperature data at all resolutions, a small noise mismatch is irrelevant compared to the CMB cosmic variance.In Fig. 14 we plot the percentage of simulations with a lower variance than the real data, as a function of pixel resolution.

        <p>For the signal-plus-noise data, we observe satisfactory consistency in temperature at high pixel resolutions. At lower res-olutions we observe low probabilities, with p values of about 1.0 %, which are associated with the well known lack of power on large angular scales.

        <p>In polarization at high resolutions, results are not as robust, due to the noise mismatch. We observe an incompatibility for all the component-separated HMHD and OEHD maps between the MC distribution and real data at intermediate and high resolutions. This suggests that noise in the data (including systematic effects) is not fully characterized by the simulations. At lower resolutions ( N side = 256 for HMHD and 128 for OEHD), however, data are compatible with simulations, showing that the noise properties are better represented. In Fig. 15 we show the amplitude of the noise mismatch with respect to the amplitude of the expected CMB variance as a function of pixel resolution. These results give an estimation of the bias due to the noise mismatch in the extraction of the variance from signal plus noise data. The bias is very important at the highest resolution (N side = 2048), with values of about 40-50 % for all the methods. At intermediate resolutions it is of the order of few percent. At large scales the bias is not significant, since half-difference data are compatible with the MC dispersion.In polarization at high resolutions, results are not as robust, due to the noise mismatch.

At intermediate and large scales, auto-and cross-analyses are in good agreement with each other, showing the robustness of the analysis, although with some differences among the component-separation methods due to the presence of residual foregrounds, or systematic effects, or a different impact of the noise mismatch. At high resolution the differences between auto and cross results are mainly due to the noise mismatch, whose impact is more important for the auto analysis. On the other side, the cross-analyses may be biased by a poor description of the correlated noise that we cannot investigate with the above analyses.In spite of the presence of a noise mismatch, we find that cross-and auto-analyses of the signal-plus-noise maps are in agreement with MC simulations.

        <p>Figure 16 shows a comparison of power spectra evaluated from the four cleaned CMB temperature half-mission maps. In the top panel, the solid lines show spectra computed from the half-mission half-sum (HMHS) maps, and thereby contain both signal and noise, while dashed lines show spectra computed from the HMHD, and thereby should contain only instrumental noise and systematic uncertainties. The black solid line shows the bestfit Planck 2018 ΛCDM model derived from the combination of the low-T T , low-EE, high-T T + T E + EE, and lensing likelihoods (Planck Collaboration XIII 2016). The bottom panel shows the residuals after subtracting both the best-fit ΛCDM model (as a signal tracer) and the half-difference spectrum (as a noise tracer) from each of the half-sum spectra.Figure 16 shows a comparison of power spectra evaluated from the four cleaned CMB temperature half-mission maps.

        <p>At low multipoles we also see differences among the codes in terms of noise. The lowest noise is achieved by Commander, which also exhibits nearly white noise with a scaling of O( 2). The highest low-noise -almost an order of magnitude higher than Commander -is seen for NILC for 300. This is not unexpected given the nature of the NILC algorithm. On large angular scales, the NILC frequency weights primarily adjust themselves to suppress foregrounds, while on small scales, they converge to inverse-noise-variance weighting. In this respect, Commander is different from the other three codes in that it explicitly uses estimates of the noise standard deviation to perform inversevariance noise weighting per pixel. Finally, for SMICA we note that the noise decreases around ≈ 100, which corresponds to the multipole at which the three LFI frequencies are excluded at high latitudes (see Appendix D).At low multipoles we also see differences among the codes in terms of noise.

        <p>In Fig. 17 we present a similar comparison for the EE and BB HMHD polarization power spectra. As in Fig. 16, the solid lines includes contributions from both signal and noise. Here we see, at least at the level of visual inspection, that all four codes perform similarly in terms of polarization power spectrum reconstruction, both for HMHS and HMHD spectra. The only marginal outlier is NILC, which exhibits slightly higher BB HMHS and HMHD spectra at multipoles lower than 100. However, this excess disappears in the difference between the HMHS and HMHD spectrum (bottom panels of Fig. 17), suggesting that it is due to a somewhat higher noise level in the NILC map compared to the others, and not a signal bias.In Fig. 17 we present a similar comparison for the EE and BB HMHD polarization power spectra.

        <p>Starting with the BB spectrum, we note that there is an overall significant excess compared to zero.

Note that the value for the optical depth of reionization adopted for these simulations is τ = 0.060 (see Planck Collaboration II 2020; Planck Collaboration III 2020 for details), which is larger than the best-fit Planck 2018 value of τ = 0.054. of simulations, and therefore reflects the presence of understood residual correlations in the data; see Planck Collaboration III (2020) for further discussion. Consequently, we re-emphasize the importance of comparing these data with full end-to-end simulations when subjecting them to cosmological analysis, in order to adequately capture this type of residual noise correlation.

        <p>The EE spectrum does not not show a clear detection of the reionization peak.

        <p>Gravitational lensing of CMB photons by large-scale structures induces slight distortions in the statistics of the CMB. In particular, lensing deflections result in a characteristic acoustic peak smoothing signature in the angular power spectrum, and they induce a non-zero four-point CMB correlation function. We use the methodology described in Planck Collaboration VIII (2020) to reconstruct the lensing power spectrum. With the sensitivity and sky coverage of Planck, this approach constrains the lensing deflection power spectrum to a few percent, with most of the signal coming from temperature observations at high multipoles ∼ 1500. These measurements therefore result in a stringent consistency test between the various component-separation methods at small angular scales.Gravitational lensing of CMB photons by large-scale structures induces slight distortions in the statistics of the CMB.

        <p>In these plots, one may observe generally similar behaviour between Commander and SEVEM, and between NILC and SMICA. Explicitly, NILC and SMICA result in slightly lower residuals in the Galactic plane, whereas Commander and SEVEM appear slightly less sensitive to stripes at high Galactic latitues. As evaluated over the common polarization mask, the standard deviations of the four maps (in alphabetical order) are 0.74 µK, 0.86 µK, 0.74 µK, and 0.75 µK, respectively.In these plots, one may observe generally similar behaviour between Commander and SEVEM, and between NILC and SMICA.

        <p>Before considering astrophysical components, it is instructive to consider the internal consistency between the Planck 2018 polarization frequency maps. For this purpose, we employ the Commander model described in Sect. 2.1, fitting a minimal threecomponent signal model (CMB, synchrotron, and thermal dust emission) to the seven polarized Planck frequencies between 30 and 353 GHz. The synchrotron component is modelled by a single power-law with a free spectral index, β s , in the frequency domain, while the thermal dust component is modelled as a modified blackbody with free spectral index, β d , and temperature, T d . In the main analyses, the synchrotron spectral index is fixed spatially to β s = -3.1, matching the high-latitude temperature result found from the combination of Planck 2015, WMAP, and Haslam data (Planck Collaboration X 2016); as shown in Sect. 5.3, the Planck measurements by themselves have little sensitivity to the synchrotron spectral index. For thermal dust, we fix T d at the Commander result found from the Planck 2018 temperature data in Appendix F; with a highest frequency of 353 GHz, the Planck polarization observations are insensitive to this parameter.Before considering astrophysical components, it is instructive to consider the internal consistency between the Planck 2018 polarization frequency maps.

        <p>Additionally, we impose a spatial smoothness prior on both synchrotron and thermal dust emission to reduce noise-induced degeneracies between the various components. This takes the form of a Gaussian smoothing kernel with 40 FWHM for synchrotron emission and 10 FWHM for thermal dust emission. The widths of these priors are chosen to match the resolution at which the data have a significant signal-to-noise ratio; see Appendix A for further details.Additionally, we impose a spatial smoothness prior on both synchrotron and thermal dust emission to reduce noise-induced degeneracies between the various components.

        <p>Given this model, the top panels in Fig. 22 show residual maps of the form data minus model (d ν -s ν ) for each Planck frequency map, all smoothed to a common resolution of 40 . The colour scales cover ±20 µK for the LFI channels, and ±5 µK for the HFI channels. Ideally, each of these maps should be consistent with instrumental noise alone, and for the three LFI channels this appears to be a reasonable approximation. The only clearly visible artefacts in these maps correspond to regions of high foreground amplitudes, which most likely are due to a low level of residual temperature-to-polarization leakage, for instance from bandpass mismatch between individual detectors. In particular, the sharp morphology of the Galactic plane residuals corresponds to the shape of temperature foregrounds, not polarization foregrounds.Given this model, the top panels in Fig. 22 show residual maps of the form data minus model (d ν -s ν ) for each Planck frequency map, all smoothed to a common resolution of 40 .

        <p>As discussed by Plaszczynski et al. ( 2014), this estimator is intrinsically noise-biased; however, since we are only interested in it for comparison and consistency purposes, the noise bias is not critical for this paper. The resulting maps are shown in Figs. 23-27, as estimated by Commander, GNILC, and SMICA. For Commander, the synchrotron map is smoothed to 40 FWHM and the thermal dust emission map is smoothed to 5 FWHM. For SMICA, the corresponding smoothing scales are 40 and 12 FWHM. For GNILC the effective angular resolution varies over the sky, depending on the local signal-to-noise ratio. The Commander maps correspond to the amplitudes evaluated at monochromatic reference frequencies, while the GNILC and SMICA maps correspond to bandpassintegrated maps at 30 and 353 GHz, respectively. Two sets of GNILC products are delivered for the Planck 2018 release: (i) the GNILC Stokes I, Q, and U maps of thermal dust emission at uniform 80 resolution, with the associated GNILC noise covariance matrix maps (II, IQ, IU, QQ, QU, and UU); and (ii) the GNILC Stokes I, Q, and U maps of thermal dust emission at variable resolution (80 to 5 ) over the sky, with the associated GNILC noise-covariance-matrix maps, along with a beam FWHM map indicating the corresponding variable resolution of the dust over the sky regions.

        <p>Figure 28 shows a scatter plot between the Commander and GNILC thermal dust amplitudes, both evaluated for a common resolution of 80 FWHM. Overall, the agreement is very good, and the Pearson's correlation coefficient between the two maps is r = 0.999. Similar good agreement is observed between the SMICA and the Commander and GNILC maps, except for very high values of P, for which SMICA applies an inpainting mask during processing to avoid ringing. The main notable difference between the Commander and GNILC maps is an overall relative scaling of around 5 %, corresponding to the fact that no colour corrections are applied to the GNILC map, and it therefore corresponds to the dust signal as observed through the Planck 353-GHz bandpass. This distinction between the two maps is important to bear in mind when subjecting either one to statistical analysis.Figure 28 shows a scatter plot between the Commander and GNILC thermal dust amplitudes, both evaluated for a common resolution of 80 FWHM.

        <p>Based on these polarization amplitude maps, one can compute the corresponding polarization fraction, defined as p = P/I, where P is the polarization amplitude, and I is the corresponding total intensity. This quantity is useful for modelling and characterizing astrophysical emission processes, and is therefore of great interest to astrophysical theorists. However, it is also highly sensitive to systematic errors in the intensity component, and in particular to the zero level, which is difficult to constrain for the Planck measurements. A careful analysis of the thermal dust polarization fraction derived from the Planck 2018 measurements, including zero level uncertainties, is provided in Planck Collaboration XII (2020), and we refer the interested reader to that paper for full details.Based on these polarization amplitude maps, one can compute the corresponding polarization fraction, defined as p = P/I, where P is the polarization amplitude, and I is the corresponding total intensity.

        <p>Starting with Commander, we note that the main analysis discussed above is performed with informative (delta function or Gaussian) priors on both β s and β d . In order to quantify the intrinsic information content and statistical strength of the Planck data to constrain these parameters at a more basic level, it is useful also to perform prior-free runs. The results from such analyses are summarized in Fig. 29, for synchrotron emission in the top panel and thermal dust emission in the bottom panel. In either case, the Gaussian prior is removed only on the component in question, not both simultaneously. In all cases, however, a broad uniform prior is imposed in order to exclude completely unphysical values. The synchrotron analysis is performed at a smoothing scale of 5 • FWHM, while the thermal dust analysis is performed at a smoothing scale of 3 • FWHM. This scale was determined by considering a series of scales (1, 2, 3, 5, 10 deg), and identifying the largest scale that did not result in leakage artifacts.Starting with Commander, we note that the main analysis discussed above is performed with informative (delta function or Gaussian) priors on both β s and β d .

        <p>For synchrotron emission, we find a very broad distribution between β s = -4 and -1.5, with both ends being defined by the uniform prior. There is a weak preference for values between β s = -3.5 and -3.0, consistent with the value of β s = -3.1 found by combining Planck, WMAP, and Haslam temperature data in Planck Collaboration X (2016), but overall, it is clear that the Planck polarization data by themselves do not significantly constrain the spectral index of synchrotron emission at scales smaller than 5 • . For the main analysis, we therefore fix the spectral index for polarized synchrotron emission at the best-fit value derived from the 2015 temperature data, corresponding to β s = -3.1. This value is also consistent within the uncertainties with corresponding results derived by Kogut et al. (2007) For thermal dust emission, the situation is more informative, since the HFI data constrain thermal dust emission more strongly than the LFI data constrain synchrotron emission. Focusing for the moment on the blue curve in Fig. 29, corresponding to the nominal data set considered in this paper, we observe a clear peak centred around β d ≈ 1.60, and with a width of 0.10-0.15. The distribution exhibits heavy tails toward both steep and shallow spectral indices, which is typical for noise-dominated data; these pixels are mostly located at high Galactic latitudes, where the dust amplitude is low. Motivated by these results, we adopt a Gaussian prior for the Commander analysis of β d = 1.60 ± 0.10 for the main analysis, acknowledging that the standard deviation quoted above over-estimates the intrinsic scatter in the dust population because of instrumental noise. Note that the uncertainty in this prior refers to the standard deviation of the map, not the error in the mean of the central value. As mentioned in Sect. 3, the Planck 2018 HFI polarization measurements are associated with small but non-negligible un-certainties in terms of polarization efficiencies, . By default, polarization efficiency corrections are not included in the analyses presented in this paper, but instead we assess their impact by comparing results with and without these corrections. The green curve in the bottom panel Fig. 29 shows the distribution of β d with application of these corrections at frequencies between 100 and 217 GHz.

        <p>The nominal polarization-efficiency corrections described in Planck Collaboration III (2020) and Planck Collaboration V (2020) do not include any robust estimates for the 353-GHz channel, since the CMB signal that is used to estimate these corrections is faint at this frequency. However, it is reasonable to assume that it is associated with similar uncertainties as the other HFI channels. In Fig. 30, we show the β d posterior distributions resulting from changing 353 by 1 % in either direction from its nominal value. In this case, we find that a shift of 353 by 1 % translates into a change in β d of 0.013. Combined with the uncertainties arising from the 100-to 217-GHz frequencies, we therefore consider the total systematic uncertainty on β d due to polarization efficiency corrections to be 0.04.The nominal polarization-efficiency corrections described in Planck Collaboration III (2020) and Planck Collaboration V (2020) do not include any robust estimates for the 353-GHz channel, since the CMB signal that is used to estimate these corrections is faint at this frequency.

To understand the origin of these differences, it is instructive to take a closer look at the 217/353 colour ratio, which is the fastest, simplest and most transparent estimator available.The SMICA measurements of the polarized thermal dust spectral index are in excellent agreement with the corresponding results presented in Planck Collaboration XI (2020), based on both frequency cross-correlation power spectra at high Galactic latitudes and simple colour ratios between the 217-and 353-GHz channels at low Galactic latitudes.

        <p>The results from this estimator may be summarized as follows. We subtract one of the cleaned CMB maps from the Planck 217-and 353-GHz polarization HM split maps to form two statistically independent foreground-plus-noise maps. We smooth these maps to 3 • FWHM to increase the effective signal-to-noise ratio per pixel. We then compute the cross-polarization amplitude between the two halves of the split, and we finally form the CMB-corrected colour ratio between the 217 and 353 GHz maps. Given some estimate of the thermal dust temperature, this ratio may then be easily translated into estimates of the thermal dust spectral index. We adopt a constant temperature of 19.6 K in the following.The results from this estimator may be summarized as follows.

        <p>First, we consider the impact of different CMB estimates produced by each of the four analysis pipelines. With the above procedure, we find median estimates of β d = 1.57, 1.54, 1.55, and 1.54, when subtracting the Commander, NILC, SEVEM, and SMICA CMB polarization maps, respectively. Different noiseweighting and foreground-modelling assumptions thus account for ∆β d ≈ 0.03.First, we consider the impact of different CMB estimates produced by each of the four analysis pipelines.

        <p>Second, the effect of polarization efficiencies has already been addressed above in the context of Commander. We find similar sensitivities to the polarization efficiencies on the 217/353 colour ratio, as the median estimates for each of the four codes when applying these corrections are β d = 1.54, 1.52, 1.52, and 1.52, corresponding to an effective shift of ∆β d ≈ 0.02-0.03.Second, the effect of polarization efficiencies has already been addressed above in the context of Commander.

        <p>Third and finally, a small effect is due to different bandpass treatments. Specifically, in Planck Collaboration XI (2020), bandpass integration effects are taken into account by the socalled colour correction technique, in which a multiplicative correction based on some fiducial spectral parameters is applied to the nominal thermal dust SED at a given reference frequency. The same approach is adopted for the SMICA results. In contrast, Commander performs a full integral over the product of the bandpass and the SED for each set of spectral parameters. These two different approaches agree to 0.07 % at 143 GHz, 0.7 % at 217 GHz, and 1.3 % at 353 GHz. In sum, these small differences translate into a net shift of ∆β d = 0.015 in terms of the thermal dust spectral index.Third and finally, a small effect is due to different bandpass treatments.

        <p>Recognizing the significant systematic uncertainties on the thermal dust spectral index from both modelling aspects and polarization efficiencies, we adopt a total systematic uncertainty of 0.05, defined by the above shifts added in quadrature with a statistical uncertainty of 0.02 (Planck Collaboration XI 2020). As a single point estimate, we adopt the average value of the colourratio-derived estimates without polarization efficiency corrections, for a total final estimate of β d = 1.55 ± 0.05. This estimate is conservative, and corresponds to marginalizing over all analysis methods and known uncertainties.Recognizing the significant systematic uncertainties on the thermal dust spectral index from both modelling aspects and polarization efficiencies, we adopt a total systematic uncertainty of 0.05, defined by the above shifts added in quadrature with a statistical uncertainty of 0.02 (Planck Collaboration XI 2020).

        <p>Finally we consider the angular power spectra of polarized synchrotron and thermal dust emission as estimated by Commander and SMICA. We estimate the EE and BB angular cross-spectra outside the common CMB mask for the half-mission split with XPol (see Tristram et al. 2005 and Planck Collaboration XI 2020 for details). The results from these calculations are summarized in Fig. 33.

        <p>We also observe excellent agreement between the Commander and SMICA maps in terms of polarized synchrotron emission.

        <p>The thermal dust BB spectrum is in general lower than the EE spectrum. For intermediate values of , this has been interpreted as the result of statistical alignment of filamentary structure in the interstellar medium with the local direction of the Galactic magnetic field (Planck Collaboration XI 2020, and references therein). Empirically, this asymmetry of BB relative to EE extends to the lowest multipoles, as seen in Fig. 33 by the decrease of BB below the power law and, interestingly here, no such strong decrease for EE. The amount of asymmetry appears to depend on both multipole and sky fraction (Planck Collaboration XI 2020). For BB in particular, the departures from the power law at lower multipoles show a dependence on Galactic hemisphere (see the comparison on Northern and Southern cuts of the sky in Planck Collaboration XI 2020), which in turn suggests some relationship to the large-scale structure of the magnetic field. Further discussion is beyond the scope of this paper.The thermal dust BB spectrum is in general lower than the EE spectrum.

As expected, the overall picture is very similar to that presented from the Planck 2015 data in Planck Collaboration X (2016), with one small but notable exception: Because the best-fit value of the optical depth of reionization is lower in the Planck 2018 ΛCDM model than in the corresponding 2015 model, the relative foregrounds-to-CMB ratio is higher at low EE multipoles, further emphasizing the importance of accurate foreground modelling for large-scale polarization CMB analysis.Based on the best-fit power spectrum and SED parameters reported above, Fig. 34 summarizes the foreground-to-CMB ratio in terms of the quantity f ( , ν) = [C fg (ν)/C CMB ] 1/2 as a function of both frequency and angular scale.

        <p>The main scientific motivation underlying the work between the Planck 2015 and 2018 data releases has been reduced instrumental systematics, in particular for the polarization measurements. As demonstrated in this and companion papers, the work has been successful, as the updated Planck frequency maps exhibit significantly lower contamination on all angular scales. For polarization, we find that the lower systematics in frequency maps translates directly into lower systematics in CMB and foreground maps. Additionally, new end-to-end CMB-plusnoise simulations have been constructed that more accurately reproduce residual systematics observed in the real data. For full-mission data, these simulations are accurate to 3 % for 1500 in both temperature and polarization. On smaller scales, non-negligible biases are observed, and caution is warranted when subjecting the maps to detailed statistical analysis on scales smaller than 1500. It is important to note that the 2018 data release does not represent a globally optimal reduction of the Planck time-ordered data that is ideal for all purposes. In particular, the updated data set does not include single detector maps, and the new frequency maps have complicated bandpass properties (Planck Collaboration III 2020). As a result, accurate reconstruction of astrophysical temperature foreground properties is non-trivial. Thus, while the Planck 2018 release represents a significant step forward in our understanding of the polarized microwave sky compared to the 2015 release, the associated temperature results, for which the astrophysics are richer, do not represent a similar improvement. Indeed, for several intensity applications we anticipate that external users may find the 2015 products more useful than the corresponding 2018 products. One concrete example of this is the Planck astrophysical sky model as presented in Planck Collaboration X (2016), which includes intensity estimates of both CO line emission and thermal dust emission. The same considerations apply both to GNILC and Commander; while chronologically formally superseded by the current results, we believe that the 2015 temperature astrophysical foreground models represent more accurate approximations to the true sky than the ones presented in the 2018 data release.

        <p>Fortunately, these issues are largely unimportant for CMB reconstruction purposes. The analyses presented in this paper and in Planck Collaboration VI (2020) reach the same conclusion regarding the CMB temperature results, namely that the Planck 2018 CMB temperature data are for all practical purposes statistically consistent with the corresponding 2015 rendition. Of course, this is the direct result of the very high signal-tonoise ratio of the Planck measurements, in that small variations in the processing procedure make very little difference in the final maps compared to the intrinsic sample variance of the true CMB sky.Fortunately, these issues are largely unimportant for CMB reconstruction purposes.

        <p>For large-scale CMB polarization at 50, we find that the Planck 2018 data are compatible with end-to-end simulations. However, it is critical to note that the observations are not consistent with uncorrelated white noise at any angular scales. Any statistical analysis of the Planck 2018 polarization data must therefore always be accompanied by a corresponding analysis of the associated end-to-end simulations. In addition, analysis of half-data split sky maps is strongly encouraged in order to probe stability with respect to both noise and residual instrumental systematics.For large-scale CMB polarization at 50, we find that the Planck 2018 data are compatible with end-to-end simulations.

        <p>In addition to improving the large-scale CMB polarization map, the new data processing also results in improved astrophysical polarization results. One concrete example of this is the fact that the Planck 2018 data for the first time allow a pixelby-pixel estimation of the spectral index of thermal dust emission over the full sky. Corresponding analyses based on previous data sets invariably led to clearly nonphysical results obviously driven by instrumental systematics. With this new data set, we obtain a typical spectral index of polarized thermal dust emission of β d = 1.55 ± 0.05, where the uncertainty accounts both for systematic uncertainties and different analysis techniques. This estimate is largely consistent with comparable results derived from temperature measurements. Also, for polarized synchrotron emission, we are for the first time able to fit the spectral index pixel-by-pixel, and obtain physically meaningful values, even if the signal-to-noise ratio is low; the full-sky averaged synchrotron spectral index for polarized emission is β s = -3.1 ± 0.1.

        <p>As mentioned above, Commander1 adopted pixels as its basis set for all diffuse components, requiring identical angular resolution at all frequencies.

        <p>Here S is the (prior) covariance matrix of the signal amplitudes, P is the end-to-end projection operator from amplitude space to data space, N is the data noise covariance matrix, and ω i are Gaussian random vectors with zero mean and unit variance. If the maximum posterior solution is desired rather than a sample drawn from the posterior, one simply sets ω i to zero. The computational expense for solving this equation depends directly on the complexity of the projection operator, P. In most Commander1-type analyses, which employ a pixel basis for all components and impose no spatial priors, i.e., S = 0, all matrix multiplications are given by diagonal matrices.

            <rs type="version">2</rs>, P involves one spherical harmonic transform per frequency channel, and the computational scaling of the left-hand side increases from O(N pix ) to O(N 3/2 pix ). Accordingly, the associated CPU time required per sample increases from minutes to tens of hours. This additional cost, however, is very well justified by the new flexibility in terms of beam treatment, which now supports arbitrary resolution at each frequency.

As a result, the asymmetric properties of the 30-GHz beams are clearly visible. Another feature seen in these plots is the large number of overlapping sources in the 30-GHz map. If we included only this single frequency while fitting the spectral properties of the sources, there would be significant degeneracies between such overlapping sources.

        <p>For Commander, we establish the following prescription for defining a temperature confidence mask. First, the base temperature mask is defined by smoothing the Commander χ 2 map with a 30 FWHM Gaussian beam, suppressing instrumental noise fluctuations, and then thresholding the smoothed map at a value of 50, which corresponds to a roughly 4σ confidence level at high Galactic latitudes. This mask removes any pixel for which Article number, page 45 of 76 the Commander model obviously breaks down in terms of total χ 2 . However, based on frequency residual maps, one does observe residuals corresponding to specific components that are not easily picked up by the total χ 2 . To capture these, we augment the base mask with three specifically targeted masks. First, we remove any pixels brighter than 10 mK, to eliminate particularly bright radio sources. Second, we exclude by hand the Virgo and Coma clusters and the Crab Nebula. Third, noting that CO emission represents a particularly difficult problem with the current data set, we smooth the Commander 2018 CO emission map shown in Fig. F.1 with a 30 FWHM beam, and exclude any pixels for which the CO amplitude is larger than 50 µK RJ at 100 GHz.For Commander, we establish the following prescription for defining a temperature confidence mask.

        <p>The polarization confidence mask is constructed in a similar way, with a few specific modifications. First, a base mask is produced by smoothing and thresholding the χ 2 map shown in Fig. 22. Second, we remove all pixels for which the polarized thermal dust amplitude smoothed to 3 • FWHM is larger than 20 µK RJ at 353 GHz (see Fig. 23); this mask excludes pixels for which large values are observed in the frequency residual maps shown in Fig. 22, but which are not robustly picked up by the χ 2 values. Third, we remove all pixels corresponding to the cosmic ray contaminated ring discussed in Sect. As described in Planck Collaboration V (2020), the Commander algorithm is used to generate the low-temperature sky map that feeds the Planck 2018 CMB likelihood, as it was in previous Planck releases. The set-up adopted for that analysis is, however, somewhat different than the one adopted for the main anal- ysis presented in this paper, primarily due to the different angular scales in question. Specifically, since the likelihood map is only used for large angular scales, covering primarily only ≤ 30, the full analysis is carried out with Commander1, and all input frequency maps are smoothed to a common angular resolution of 40 FWHM, similar to the Planck 2015 processing. Finally, the Commander1 low-analysis internally estimates the CMB power spectrum as one of the parameters in the Bayesian parametric model, and the corresponding Gaussian constrained realization samples (Eriksen et al. 2008) provide the necessary inputs for the Blackwell-Rao likelihood estimator employed by the Planck temperature-only likelihood (Chu et al. 2005).

To limit this effect, we include only those multipoles for which the ratio between the corresponding beam transfer function and that of a corresponding 5 Gaussian is larger than 0.01 for each frequency map. This cut is made separately for each needlet scale, such that only those frequency maps containing valid harmonic content that spans the entire bandwidth of a given needlet scale contribute to that particular scale.</p>
        <p>In order to improve the measurement of CMB temperature anisotropy near the Galactic plane, we have used a very small Article number, page 47 of 76 preprocessing mask with a sky fraction of 99.8 %. The procedure to generate the preprocessing mask is as follows. First we implement the 
            <rs type="software">NILC pipeline</rs> on the full-mission data sets. Then we identify the pixels where the CMB is more than 500 µK CMB , and assign a value of 0 to all the pixels that are within 6 and a value of 1 to other pixels. We implement this preprocessing mask on the sky maps in the next run of the NILC pipeline. Prior to implementing the pipeline on the sky maps, the mask regions are filled using the inpainting procedure adopted by the Planck Sky Model.

        <p>Estimates of the covariance matrices of needlet coefficients for each scale are computed by smoothing all possible products of needlet coefficients with Gaussian beams. In this way, an estimate of needlet covariances at each point is obtained as a local, weighted average of needlet coefficient products. The FWHMs of the Gaussian windows used for the analysis are chosen to support the computation of statistics; 4225 samples or more samples are averaged. Choosing a smaller FWHM results in excessive error in the covariance estimates, and hence excessive bias. Choosing a larger FWHM results in less localization, and hence some loss of efficiency of the needlet approach.Estimates of the covariance matrices of needlet coefficients for each scale are computed by smoothing all possible products of needlet coefficients with Gaussian beams.

We chose FWHM= 2 × θ for the Gaussian beam that we use to smooth the covariance matrix. Hence in order to determine the covariance matrix at a particular point, we have given more weight to those pixels that are close to that point, and less weight to those pixels that are far away. However, this strategy is not optimal for the largest scales.A patch of angular radius θ and area 2π(1cos(θ)) contains N/(4π) × 2π{1cos(θ)} modes.

        <p>Calibration errors are a serious issue for precise measurement of the CMB, as they conspire with the ILC filter to cancel out the CMB. This effect is particularly strong in the high signal- with different splits, although this would be at the expense of decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio (e.g., to work with the cleaned 143-GHz even-ring and with the 217-GHz odd-ring maps, since the templates are constructed with the corresponding split). Following the same approach as in the previous release, after the frequency maps are cleaned, they are inpainted, in a first step, at the positions of the point sources identified in the corresponding raw maps. In a second step, the Mexican-Hat-Wavelet algorithm is again run on the cleaned frequency maps, and the newly detected sources (see lower part of Table C.1) are further inpainted. The combined area inpainted outside the SEVEM confidence mask for the 143-and 217-GHz channels (those used to construct the final CMB map) corresponds to around 0.4% of the sky, while it is fully covered by the common confidence mask. Note that the same inpainting strategy is applied to the simulations processed through the 
            <rs type="software">SEVEM</rs> pipeline, to make sure that any possible effect introduced by this procedure is statistically taken into account. Finally, the monopole and dipole are removed from the full-sky cleaned maps (note that this is different from the previous release, where monopole and dipole were removed outside the SEVEM confidence mask). The cleaned intensity maps for the 70-, 100-, 143-, and 217-GHz channels are shown in Fig. C.1.

However, given the lower resolution and higher noise level of these channels, the improvement in the signalto-noise ratio of the combined map is modest. Taking into account also that the addition of these channels could potentially introduce contamination from low-frequency foregrounds or CO emission, we decided to combine only the 143-and 217-GHz cleaned channels in the final map. lar, the maps are weighted at each multipole, taking into account the noise level and resolution of the maps, as well as a rough estimation of the expected foreground residuals. This estimation has been updated with respect to the previous release by using the FFP8 simulations. The total weights are shown in Fig. C.2.

        <p>A similar procedure is applied independently to the frequency maps of the Stokes Q and U parameters to obtain cleaned polarization CMB maps, which are aftewards combined in harmonic space to produce the final SEVEM maps. Given the narrower frequency coverage available for polarization, a different choice of templates needs to be defined in this case. In the previous release, only two cleaned channels (100 and 143 GHz) were combined to produce the final polarization map. However, due to the significant improvement of the Planck data in polarization for the current release, we are now able to clean the 217-GHz channel and to include this map in the final combination. This produces a significant improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio of the cleaned SEVEM CMB polarization maps with respect to the previous version. In addition, in the updated pipeline, the cleaned maps are produced at full resolution (N side = 2048 instead of N side = 1024 for the 100-, 143-, and 217-GHz channels, as well as the combined map). As for the previous release, a cleaned 70-GHz map is also provided at its native resolution. To reduce point source contamination, inpainting similar to that in the previous release is performed. The first step of the pipeline is to inpaint the positions of the sources detected in those channels that will be used to construct templates. These point sources are detected using a nonblind approach, among the intensity candidates, using the filtered fusion technique (Argüeso et al. 2009). The upper part of Table C.1 shows the number of sources detected in polarization in each of the frequency channels. The size of the holes to be inpainted takes into account both the amplitude of the source and the beam of the channel. As in the intensity case, when performing the subtraction of two maps to construct a template, the diffuse inpainting is performed for all of the sources detected in both channels. Note that the inpainting is always done at the native resolution of the channel and independently for Q and U maps.A similar procedure is applied independently to the frequency maps of the Stokes Q and U parameters to obtain cleaned polarization CMB maps, which are aftewards combined in harmonic space to produce the final SEVEM maps.

        <p>Once the maps have been inpainted, each template is constructed as the subtraction of two frequency channels processed to a common resolution. Given the smaller number of channels in polarization, the maps to be cleaned are also used to construct templates. In this sense, the cleaned maps at different frequencies are, in general, less independent than in the intensity case (the exception is the 70-GHz channel, which is not used as part of the templates for polarization). Six templates (one of them at two different resolutions) are generated to produce cleaned maps at 70, 100, 143, and 217 GHz. In particular, to trace the synchrotron emission, the (30 -44) GHz template is constructed, where the 30-GHz map is smoothed with the 44-GHz beam and vice versa. To trace the thermal dust, templates are produced at (217 -143), (217 -100), and (143 -100) with 1 • resolution (this smoothing is included in order to increase the signal-tonoise ratio of the template), and at (353 -217) and (353 -143) with 10 resolution. In addition, this last template is also constructed at the resolution of the 70-GHz beam, in order to clean that channel. The produced templates are then subtracted from the (non-inpainted) raw data at their native resolution. shows the list of templates used to clean each map, as well as the corresponding coefficients of the linear combination. These coefficients have been obtained by minimizing the variance of each cleaned map outside a mask excluding the brightest 3 % of the sky and all the point sources detected in polarization.

        <p>Once the frequency maps are cleaned, inpainting at the position of the point sources detected at each of those channels is carried out. Moreover, once these cleaned inpainted maps are ready, the non-blind point source detection algorithm is run again on them and additional point sources detected (see lower part of Table C.1). These newly identified sources are also inpainted. This second iteration of the algorithm was performed for intensity in the previous release but not for polarization; in this version it is done for both cases. The joint area inpainted outside the SEVEM mask in the three cleaned channels used to produce the combined maps corresponds to around a 0.04% of the sky, and is fully covered by the common confidence mask. As for intensity, exactly the same inpainting procedure is applied to the simulations processed through the 
            <rs type="software">SEVEM pipeline</rs>, to account for any possible effects introduced by this step. The cleaned Q and U maps for the 70-, 100-, 143-, and 217-GHz channels are shown in Fig. C.1. The maps have been smoothed with a Gaussian beam with 80 FWHM resolution to allow for better visualization.
        </p>
        <p>The last step is to combine the cleaned single-frequency maps in order to produce the final Q and U cleaned CMB maps. This is done by combining in harmonic space the cleaned 100, 143, and 217-GHz maps. The weights take into account the noise of each channel and its resolution. In addition, recognizing the fact that the 217-GHz channel is likely to be somewhat more susceptible to large-scale systematic residuals than the other two channels, we also introduce a relative down-weighting of the 217-GHz channel on the largest scales. This can be seen in The resolution of the combined map corresponds to a Gaussian beam of FWHM 5 and HEALPix resolution N side = 2048, with a maximum multipole max = 3000. We consider a lower max for polarization than for intensity due to the lower signal-to-noise ratio of the polarization data.The last step is to combine the cleaned single-frequency maps in order to produce the final Q and U cleaned CMB maps.

        <p>In temperature, the SEVEM confidence mask is generated following a similar procedure to that of the previous release. Specifically, we define the mask by thresholding maps constructed as the difference between two different CMB reconstructions. As in 2015, we construct these differences at N side = 256, with resolution given by a Gaussian beam with FWHM = 30 . In particular, three combinations are considered: the cleaned (217 -143) GHz and (143 -100) GHz maps and the difference between two cleaned, combined CMB maps, whose linear coefficients have been obtained by minimizing the variance outside two different masks. From each of these maps, one mask is constructed by removing the brightest pixels (and its direct neighbours) down to a certain threshold. The three masks are multiplied to produce the final confidence mask, which is then smoothed with a Gaussian beam of 1 • to avoid sharp edges and upgraded to full resolution. The thresholds that define the masks are chosen by looking at the amplitude of the extrema and the dispersion of the cleaned 100-, 143-, and 217-GHz channels and the combined map after applying the considered mask, trying to find a compromise between reducing the values of these quantities while keeping a reasonable sky fraction. In particular, thresholds removing between 8 and 10 % of the sky were found to be adequate for the differences considered. In addition, a small region near the Galactic plane with a relatively high contamination, but that was not cap- tured with these values of the thresholds, was manually masked by applying a circle of 0. In polarization, given the lower signal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed CMB maps, a different approach from that of intensity needs to be considered to identify the reliable regions of the sky. Several aspects of the approach to construct the polarization confidence mask have been modified with respect to the previous release, and the new method is described here in detail. In particular, we have defined the confidence mask as the product of two individual masks: one specific mask based on the achieved CMB reconstruction, and a second one customized to avoid the regions more contaminated by thermal dust.In temperature, the SEVEM confidence mask is generated following a similar procedure to that of the previous release.

        <p>For the specific mask, the first step is to downgrade the CMB reconstructed maps (Q and U) to a resolution equivalent to a Gaussian beam with FWHM = 90 and N side = 128. From these maps, we estimate locally the rms of P (i.e., Q 2 + U 2 ) at each position by caculating the rms of the pixels included in a circle with a given radius centred on the considered pixel. We then estimate the expected rms of P for a map containing only CMB and noise. For the noise, this is obtained by estimating this quantity locally for the odd-even half-difference map, processed through the 
            <rs type="software">SEVEM</rs> pipeline, at the resolution being considered, using the same procedure as for the cleaned maps. For the CMB, we simply obtained the rms of P, averaging over simulations. Since the CMB and noise are independent, their rms values are added quadratically. The ratio between the rms of the cleaned maps over that expected for a CMB-plus-noise map is then constructed. Pixels with larger ratios are expected to be more contaminated; the specific mask is defined by those pixels above a given threshold. This mask is then smoothed with a Gaussian beam of FWHM = 90 to avoid sharp boundaries, and upgraded to N side = 2048. We explored several values for the radius of the circle (to locally estimate the rms) and for the amplitude of the threshold, finding that a value of 15 pixels (at N side = 128) for the radius and a threshold of 1.5 produced good results.
        </p>
        <p>To construct the dust mask, we use the raw 353-GHz channel, smoothed at a resolution of 90 and N side = 128. The rms of P is obtained at each pixel as explained above, and a fixed fraction of pixels with the largest rms values is included in the mask. This mask is again smoothed with a Gaussian beam of 90 and upgraded to N side = 2048. To construct this mask, we have cho-Article number, page 53 of 76 A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. L04_diffuse_compsep_full sen a radius for estimating the rms of four pixels and excluded 15 % of the sky. Finally, the specific mask and the dust mask are multiplied together, passing 80.3 % of the sky. The SEVEM confidence mask in polarization is shown in the bottom panel of We conclude with some additional comments about the best way to deal with inpainted pixels. The most conservative approach is to explicitly exclude all of the inpainted areas from the analysis. This implies the inclusion of a large number of holes in the confidence mask, which can be damaging for certain analyses, especially those performed in harmonic space. The diffusive inpainting strategy considered above seems to effectively reduce the emission from detected point sources while, at the same time, not introducing evident artefacts in the cleaned maps (recall that we are filling small holes, corresponding to scales where the background is usually smooth). Therefore, we have only masked those inpainted pixels which are directly excluded by the general algorithm used to construct the confidence mask. For intensity, this leaves a joint inpainted area outside the SEVEM mask in the two cleaned channels (143 and 217 GHz) used to construct the final CMB map of around 0.4 % of the sky. For polarization, the corresponding joint area (from the cleaned 100-, 143-, and 217-GHz channels) also covers around 0.04 % of the sky. Moreover, for both intensity and polarization, the exact same procedure is applied to the simulations processed through the 
            <rs type="software">SEVEM</rs> pipeline, to ensure that any unexpected spurious effects are statistically taken into account. We believe that this is a good way to proceed in order to find a compromise between reducing point-source contamination in the cleaned maps and providing a well-behaved confidence mask for CMB analysis. This is the same approach used in the previous release. Nonetheless, for certain types of analysis, as for example the local study of compact objects, it may be necessary to discard, or at least to be aware of, the inpainted regions. For these cases, we also provide masks of the pixels inpainted in each of the cleaned frequencies, as well as the joint mask for those channels that are used to construct the final CMB maps. The joint masks of inpainted pixels are given in Fig. C.5 for intensity (top) and polarization (bottom). Note that additional inpainting is also performed during the template construction, but those positions are not included in these masks since those pixels are not directly inpainted on the cleaned maps. Finally, we point out that the masks for inpainted point sources given in Fig. C.5 have been included in the confidence common masks (Fig. 9), to reduce possible point source contamination in all the CMB maps. If it is desired to carry out an analysis of the SEVEM CMB maps without explicitly including point source holes in the mask, the SEVEM confidence masks should be considered.

        <p>Preprocessing The input maps are preprocessed for point sources as follows. In the maps from 30 GHz to 353 GHz, we try to fit and subtract the strongest point sources detected at the 5 σ level in the PCCS2 catalogue (Planck Collaboration XXVI 2016). Any point source with an unsatisfactory fit is left "as is" in the map. In a second step, in each of the input maps from 44 GHz to 353 GHz, we mask all the point sources detected at more than 50 σ (unless they have already been subtracted in the previous step). The masked areas at all frequencies are then combined to form a common point-source mask. In addition to that pointsource mask, we include a small mask, hereafter "the Galactic mask", blocking the Galactic plane, plus a small number of selected regions (such as the LMC). The resulting "preprocessing mask" is shown in Figure D.1. In order to minimize leakage in the subsequent computation of spherical harmonic coefficients, the masked areas under this common mask are filled in by a simple diffusive inpainting procedure.Preprocessing The input maps are preprocessed for point sources as follows. In the maps from 30 GHz to 353 GHz, we try to fit and subtract the strongest point sources detected at the 5 σ level in the PCCS2 catalogue (Planck Collaboration XXVI 2016). Any point source with an unsatisfactory fit is left "as is" in the map.

            <rs type="software">SMICA</rs> pipeline, but is carried out through a procedure common to all methods, as described in Sect. 4.2. SZ-free CMB map A CMB map free of SZ contamination is produced by a simple adaptation of Eq. (2) as follows. That expression yields weights w , which, at each multipole , mimimize the output power while enforcing unit gain towards the CMB signal. In other words, it is the minimizer of w † C w subject to w † a = 1. One can solve the same problem with the additional constraint that the weights should also cancel the SZ signal, that is, enforcing the additional constraint w † b = 0 where b denotes the SZ emission law. The minimizer of w † C w subject to w † a = 1 and w † b = 0 is easily found in closed form (see Remazeilles et al. 2011a) as Changes with respect to the 2015 release Figure 6 shows, for all pipelines, the differences in CMB temperature maps from 2015 to 2018. In the SMICA case, the difference could have three origins: changes in the input data, changes in the SMICA pipeline, and changes in recalibration procedure. We show here that the difference is mostly due to recalibration by producing a CMB map, referred to as the "2015b map", obtained from the 2015 data by running the 2015 pipeline with the sole exception that, -20 20 µK as for the 2018 release, the 30 GHz and 44 GHz channels are not recalibrated. Figure D.5 shows the differences from the 2015 map to this 2015b map (top panel) and from this 2015b map to the 2018 map, while the bottom panel of Fig. 6 shows the difference from the 2015 map to the 2018 map. These three pairwise comparisons make it clear that, in temperature, most of the differences between 2015 and 2018 should be attributed to changes in calibration, rather than to changes in the SMICA pipeline.

        <p>Finally, the GNILC method is blind, since it does not rely on any assumption about Galactic foregrounds. Most important, GNILC allows for outputting Galactic foreground maps at all frequencies, e.g., at 100-143 GHz, without relying on the extrapolation of high-frequency templates with arbitrary emission laws. This is particularly useful in the context of decorrelation effects and searches for primordial B modes (Tassis &amp; Pavlidou 2015;Planck Collaboration Int. L 2017), where we can no longer rely on simple emission laws to extrapolate dust foregrounds to CMB frequencies. Planck bandpasses measured on the ground (Planck Collaboration IX 2014). This is significantly more complicated with the single-CO line model employed in the current analysis, and with the 2018 co-added frequency maps. The scale of the current CO amplitude map is therefore instead directly set by regressing against the Dame et al. map, and the resulting scatter plot therefore by definition has a slope of unity.Finally, the GNILC method is blind, since it does not rely on any assumption about Galactic foregrounds.

        <p>More important than this choice of normalization, however, is the width and shape of the two scatter plots. Specifically, while the 2015 scatter plot exhibits a very tight overall correlation and no visually notable outliers, the 2018 scatter plot is broader overall and exhibits several outliers in the Commander map. The reasons for this weaker correlation have already been discussed in Sect. 3 and Planck Collaboration III (2020), and can be summarized as being due to the lack of single-bolometer HFI maps and inaccuracies in the CO template corrections used during mapmaking. As described in Appendix A, the Commander CO map is used as a tracer for CO emission in the Commander confidence mask. At high latitudes, the most notable effect is a brighter overall distribution of small-scale fluctuations, which correspond to small-scale cosmic infrared background (CIB) fluctuations. When interpreting these fluctuations, however, it is important to recall that the two-parameter β-T modified blackbody model exhibits a strong degeneracy between the spectral index and tem- perature in the low signal-to-noise regime. The fluctuations seen in the 2018 β map were thus also present in the 2015 rendition, but in that case were seen in the temperature map. The main reason for the apparent shift is the choice of thermal dust temperature prior, or, to be more precise, the angular resolution at which it is fitted. In 2015 the thermal dust temperature was fitted at 40 FWHM, while in the updated analysis it is fitted at 5 FWHM. As a result, the 2015 temperature map had higher effective signal-to-noise per resolution element, and therefore less dependence on the prior and more structure at high latitudes. In contrast, the 2018 temperature map has less signal-to-noise per resolution element, stronger prior dependency, and accordingly also shows less structure at high latitudes, as the temperature is driven to the prior mean, and fluctuations are instead captured in the spectral index map. In general, we caution against overinterpreting the individual parameters of the modified blackbody model in the low signal-to-noise regime, since small changes in the input can lead to relatively large variations in parameter values. In contrast, the resulting SED arising from the parameters is robust.More important than this choice of normalization, however, is the width and shape of the two scatter plots.

        <p>For completeness, we note that the best-fit CO line ratio between 100 and 217 GHz (353 GHz) is h 2018 = 0.58 (h 353 = 0.20), as estimated by Commander from the Planck 2018 data set. For comparison, the corresponding 2013 values for these two parameters were h 2018 = 0.595 and h 353 = 0.295. However, for the reasons discussed above, we do not attach physical significance to the lower value found in the new data set, but rather recommend continued usage of the previous values when using Planck results for astrophysical analysis and forecasts.For completeness, we note that the best-fit CO line ratio between 100 and 217 GHz (353 GHz) is h 2018 = 0.58 (h 353 = 0.20), as estimated by Commander from the Planck 2018 data set.

        <p>Before concluding our discussion, we emphasize that while we do not consider the Commander 2018 intensity foreground analysis to be as robust as the corresponding 2015 analysis, this has only a very small effect on the corresponding CMB reconstruction after accounting explicitly for CO emission in the Commander confidence mask (see Sec. A.4). As far as CMB reconstruction is concerned, the only important factor is whether the sum of the apparent foregrounds may be modelled within the parameter space of the Bayesian model; whether or not those best-fit values represents the physically true sky is irrelevant. This is of course also precisely why blind CMB reconstruction methods, such as NILC, SEVEM, and SMICA, perform very well. Nevertheless, the fact that the Commander 2018 intensity products appear reasonable, and that shortcomings are understood, is reassuring.Before concluding our discussion, we emphasize that while we do not consider the Commander 2018 intensity foreground analysis to be as robust as the corresponding 2015 analysis, this has only a very small effect on the corresponding CMB reconstruction after accounting explicitly for CO emission in the Commander confidence mask (see Sec.

        <p>Appendix F.2: Thermal dust intensity maps and their zero levels The behaviour at low intensities is particularly interesting because it is sensitive to how the zero level of each map has been set. By construction, the frequency maps delivered by the HFI DPC and used for component separation have a Galactic zero level consistent with an intensity of the dust foreground at high Galactic latitudes proportional to the column density of the ISM traced by the 21-cm emission of Hi at low column densities. In the case of GNILC, the processing does not adjust the monopoles contained in the input maps, the largest of which is the CIB monopole. Therefore, the zero levels of the resulting GNILC dust maps need to be adjusted prior to Galactic applications. This has been accomplished here, just as in Planck Collaboration Int. XLVIII (2016), by correlation with the Hi map at high latitude, following the methodology set out in Planck Collaboration VIII (2014) and Planck Collaboration XI (2014). At 353 GHz, 421 µK is subtracted. In the case of Commander, the zero level at each frequency is solved for explicitly within the component separation processing, with priors set equal to the value of the CIB monopole (see Appendix A.2). The Commander offset found at 353 GHz is 431 µK, separate from the thermal dust emission model. Given these zero level adjustments, the agreement at low intensities is satisfactory.Appendix F.2: Thermal dust intensity maps and their zero levels The behaviour at low intensities is particularly interesting because it is sensitive to how the zero level of each map has been set.

XLVIII (2016), by correlation with the Hi map at high latitude, following the methodology set out in Planck Collaboration VIII (2014) and Planck Collaboration XI (2014). At 353 GHz, 421 µK is subtracted. In the case of Commander, the zero level at each frequency is solved for explicitly within the component separation processing, with priors set equal to the value of the CIB monopole (see Appendix A.2). The Commander offset found at 353 GHz is 431 µK, separate from the thermal dust emission model. Given these zero level adjustments, the agreement at low intensities is satisfactory.</p>
        <p>Especially for applications at low intensity, it critical to appreciate that there are significant uncertainties in the zero levels of the Commander thermal dust intensity maps derived from the Planck 2015 and 2018 frequency maps, as discussed in Section 6.1.1 of Planck Collaboration X (2016), and of GNILC, as discussed in Section 2.2 of Planck Collaboration XII (2020), including the possibility of dust associated with ionized gas. These uncertainties need to be evaluated and then propagated in any subsequent analyses using these thermal dust maps, in particular when estimating modified blackbody parameters or the polarization fraction. Ideally, the uncertainties can be reduced through improved methods of zero level determination, such as exploitation of correlations with external data sets, including Hi and optical extinction (e.g., Planck Collaboration Int. XLVIII 2016), or via spatial spectral variations (Wehus et al. 2017).Especially for applications at low intensity, it critical to appreciate that there are significant uncertainties in the zero levels of the Commander thermal dust intensity maps derived from the Planck 2015 and 2018 frequency maps, as discussed in Section 6.1.1 of Planck Collaboration X (2016), and of GNILC, as discussed in Section 2.2 of Planck Collaboration XII (2020), including the possibility of dust associated with ionized gas.

        <p>For the particular case of SEVEM, the evaluation of the transfer function is in principle affected by the pixels inpainted in the cleaned frequency maps. Since those pixels are all excluded in the common confidence mask, we have evaluated this function from full-sky CMB simulations without applying this inpainting. Therefore, this effective transfer function should be a good approximation for the regions passed by the common mask. However, if a transfer function is needed for a region of the sky that contains inpainted pixels, it is recommended to reevaluate this function for that particular sky coverage, taking into account the inpainting. Although the effect is very small, it can be noticeable, especially for agressive masks that remove only a small fraction of the Galaxy, since in the Galactic regions a relatively large number of sources are inpainted.Article number, page 18 of 76 Planck Collaboration: Diffuse component separationFor the particular case of SEVEM, the evaluation of the transfer function is in principle affected by the pixels inpainted in the cleaned frequency maps.

        <p>Due to its very general approach to CMB analysis, it is more appropriate to refer to Commander as a framework rather than as a specific and well-defined algorithm. For instance, the implementation that is employed for the Planck 2017 analysis has been re-written from scratch compared to the 2015 version, and the current version is sometimes referred to as 
            <rs type="software">Commander</rs>
            <rs type="version">2</rs> (Seljebotn et al. 2017). The main difference between the old and the new implementations is their different choice of basis functions for the amplitude degrees of freedom, and their different treatment of instrumental beams. While Commander1 adopted real-space pixels as its fundamental basis set and required uniform angular resolution across frequencies, 
            <rs type="software">Commander</rs>2 adopts spherical harmonics as its fundamental basis set and supports different angular resolutions at different frequencies. As a result, the new implementation supports signal reconstruction at the full angular resolution of the Planck observations. Appendix A.1: Amplitude sampling algorithm For full algorithmic specifics regarding the new implementation, see Seljebotn et al. (2017); here we review only the main equations. First, we adopt a general signal model on the following form, s ν (θ) = s ν (a i , β i , g ν , m ν ) (A.1)

        <p>By virtue of being a Gibbs-sampling procedure, Commander requires one sampling step for each parameter under consideration, such as spectral or calibration parameters. However, these parameters are sampled with exactly the same methods in Commander2 as in Commander1, and the details will not be repeated here; see Eriksen et al. (2008) and Planck Collaboration X (2016).By virtue of being a Gibbs-sampling procedure, Commander requires one sampling step for each parameter under consideration, such as spectral or calibration parameters.

        <p>The goal of NILC is to estimate the CMB from multi-frequency observations while minimizing the contamination from Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds, and instrumental noise. The method makes a linear combination of the data from the input maps with minimum variance on a frame of spherical wavelets called needlets (Narcowich et al. 2006). Due to their unique properties, needlets enable localized filtering in both pixel space and harmonic space. Localization in pixel space allows the to-noise ratio regime, on large scales in particular. We investigate the impact of this calibration bias by redoing the analysis with slightly modified calibration coefficients, and computing the difference between the CMB spectra estimated in the two cases. We adopt the calibration coefficients determined by SMICA in Appendix D. Figure B.3 shows the impact of calibration on the angular power spectrum of the CMB temperature. Comparison of angular power spectra for two data splits shows that the impact is less than 0.5 %.The goal of NILC is to estimate the CMB from multi-frequency observations while minimizing the contamination from Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds, and instrumental noise.

        <p>Appendix C.1: Implementation for temperature For temperature, we have followed the same procedure as for the Planck 2015 release (see Planck Collaboration IX 2016 for further details). As before, we clean the 100-, 143-, and 217-GHz frequency channels with four templates, three of them constructed as the difference between two nearby Planck channels (30 -44, 44 -70, 545 -353), such that the first channel is convolved with the beam of the second one and vice versa, and a fourth template given by the 857-GHz channel, convolved with the 545-GHz beam. The cleaned frequency maps have the same resolution as the corresponding original raw data map. To reduce the contamination from point sources in the templates, we follow the same approach as in the previous release. First, point sources are detected in each frequency map using the Mexican-Hat-Wavelet algorithm (López-Caniego et al. 2006;Planck Collaboration XXVI 2016). The upper part of Table C.1 gives the number of point sources detected in intensity and polarization for all the Planck frequency channels over the full-sky, at Galactic latitudes |b| &gt; 20 • . We then inpaint the holes corresponding to the positions of those point sources in the frequency maps (at their original resolution) involved in the construction of the templates. Note that the size of the hole depends on the amplitude of the detected source and the resolution of the considered channel. The filling is done with a simple diffusive inpainting scheme, which replaces one pixel with the mean value of the neighbouring pixels in an iterative way. To avoid possible inconsistencies when performing the subtraction of two maps to construct a template, the diffusive inpainting is performed for all of the sources detected in both channels. For instance, when constructing the (30 -44) GHz template, all sources detected at 30 and 44 GHz are inpainted in the two frequency maps before subtraction 13 .Appendix C.1: Implementation for temperature For temperature, we have followed the same procedure as for the Planck 2015 release (see Planck Collaboration IX 2016 for further details).

        <p>In addition, for this release, we also provide a cleaned CMB map for the 70-GHz channel. This map is constructed at its original resolution and N side = 1024, and has been cleaned with two templates, one constructed as the 30-GHz channel (convolved with the 44-GHz beam) minus the 44-GHz one (convolved with the 30-GHz beam), and a second template obtained as the difference between the 353 and 143 channels, constructed at a resolution equal to that of the 70-GHz channel. This second template has been chosen to trace the emission of the thermal dust, but avoding, as far as possible, the CO contamination (which is mostly present in the 100-and 217-GHz maps). Point source emission in the templates has also been reduced with the inpainting mechanism already described.In addition, for this release, we also provide a cleaned CMB map for the 70-GHz channel.

        <p>The coefficients of the linear combination used for cleaning the frequency maps are given in Table C.2. They have been calculated by minimizing the variance of the corresponding cleaned map outside a mask that excludes the brightest 1 % of the sky and all the point sources detected in intensity. The cleaning procedure introduces a certain level of correlation between the 100-, 143-, and 217-GHz cleaned frequency maps, due to the use of the same templates, but one frequency map is not used to clean the others. The cleaned 70-GHz channel is, however, more correlated, since it is part of one of the templates used to clean the higher frequency channels. Moreover, the 143-GHz map is also used to clean the 70-GHz channel. Therefore, one should bear in mind these correlations when carrying out analyses with the cleaned single frequency maps. A possible way to reduce the correlations introduced by the cleaning process would be, when possible, to use pairs of cleaned frequency maps constructed Confidence mask. A SMICA polarization confidence mask has been produced and released, but appears not to be conservative enough. For that reason, we recommend using the common confidence mask to analyse SMICA polarized CMB maps.The coefficients of the linear combination used for cleaning the frequency maps are given in Table C.2.

        <p>The results presented in Sect. 5.3, regarding the polarized dust and synchrotron emission, are based on a dedicated, blind SMICA fit with a foreground emissivity matrix F composed only of N fg = 2 columns. The total foreground contribution to a spectral covariance matrix C being FP F † , a blind fit can only determine the factors F and P up to multiplication by an invertible 2×2 matrix T.

Therefore the likelihood is insensitive to the value of T. Since a blind fit is (by definition) conducted without constraining either F nor P , the matrix T cannot be determined from the data without imposing extra constraints. This degeneracy could be fixed by constraining P to be diagonal, but this would be equivalent to fitting a (wrong) model of uncorrelated synchrotron and dust emissions.

        <p>The formalism of GNILC has been described in detail in Remazeilles et al. (2011b) and Planck Collaboration Int. XLVIII (2016). The main characteristics can be summarized as follows: (i) a GNILC map at given frequency is a weighted linear combination (ILC) of the Planck frequency maps having minimimum variance; (ii) GNILC performs localized analysis in both harmonic space and pixel space via needlet (spherical wavelet) decomposition (Narcowich et al. 2006), and as such it adapts component separation to local conditions of contamination both over the sky and over angular scale; and (iii) GNILC uses not only spectral information, but also spatial information (angular power spectra) of the non-Galactic components (CIB, CMB, and noise) in order to disentangle the Galactic signal from the CIB, CMB, and noise contamination. Therefore, GNILC is a blind, modelindependent, data-driven component-separation method, in the sense that there is no prior assumption/parametrization of the Galactic foreground properties.The formalism of GNILC has been described in detail in Remazeilles et al.

        <p>There are, however, a few differences in the GNILC processing steps between intensity and polarization. For intensity, the processing is identical to that of Planck Collaboration Int. XLVIII (2016), i.e., the prior information is both spectral and spatial, and consists of the Planck best-fit CMB temperature power spectrum, C ΛCDM (Planck Collaboration XI 2016), the Planck CIB best-fit auto/cross power spectra across frequency pairs, C CIB (ν 1 , ν 2 ) (Planck Collaboration XXX 2014), and the Planck noise power spectra across frequencies, C noise (ν). For polarization, prior information is only spectral for the CMB, consisting of the CMB SED, 15 while the noise prior is still spectral and spatial, comprising the Planck noise power spectra at each frequency. In practice, Planck noise power spectra are derived from the half-difference of the first and second halves of each stable pointing period ("rings") of Planck, in which the sky emission cancels out and leaves an estimate of the full-survey noise.There are, however, a few differences in the GNILC processing steps between intensity and polarization.

        <p>In this appendix, we review the temperature foreground products derived by Commander and GNILC from the Planck 2018 frequency maps. As discussed in Sect. 3 and elsewhere, these results are not intended for scientific analysis, but are included here for reference and completeness purposes. Starting with the amplitude maps, the most notable difference with earlier results is caused by the explicit inclusion of a radio point source component in the latest model. Each object in this component is associated with an overall flux density and spectral index across all frequencies, while the spatial projection into each frequency component is performed through a full FEBeCoP calculation, accounting for the asymmetric beam profile in the respective frequency channel. Only frequencies up to and including 143 GHz are included when fitting the flux densities and spectral indices, to avoid biases from modelling errors at high frequencies. However, the resulting model is also extrapolated to higher frequencies when fitting other components. Infrared and sub-mm sources are not explicitly modelled in this approach, since they are well described for the Planck frequencies within the diffuse thermal dust component, which has 5 FWHM resolution.In this appendix, we review the temperature foreground products derived by Commander and GNILC from the Planck 2018 frequency maps.

        <p>Several interesting features may be seen in Table F.1. Starting with the PCCS2 sources (Planck Collaboration XXVI 2016), the correlation between the Commander and PCCS2 flux densities at 30 GHz is very high, with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.99. However, the best-fit relative amplitude between the two catalogues is a = 0.867. Part of this is due to the fact that the Commander flux densities are intrinsically colour corrected, and therefore correspond to a monochromatic reference frequency of 30 GHz, whereas the PCCS2 values correspond to flux densities directly observed in the 30-GHz map without colour correction. Considering that the effective frequency of the 30-GHz channel for a flat-spectrum source with a spectral energy distribution proportional to ν -2 is 28.4 GHz, the difference in amplitude is expected to be roughly (28.4/30) 2 ≈ 0.90. In addition, the Commander analysis takes into account the full asymmetry of the Planck beams, and also exploits all frequencies between 30 and 143 GHz in the fit, while the PCCS2 catalogue only considers a symmetric Gaussian beam model, and employs the LFI 30-GHz observations alone.Several interesting features may be seen in Table F.1.

        <p>The Commander fits exhibit a slightly lower correlation coefficient relative to the AT20G source catalogue at 20 GHz, with a numerical value of r = 0.74 and a detection rate of 91 %. However, the flux-density calibration is very good, with a relative normalization factor of a = 0.977. At 4.85 GHz, the correlation with the GB6 catalogue flux densities is again very slightly weaker at r = 0.69, and this time the detection rate is 59 %, with a relative normalization of a = 0.56. Finally, this general trend of weakening correlations becomes even stronger at lower frequencies, with the NVVS catalogue at 1.4 GHz only having a correlation coefficient of r = 0.10 and a relative normalization of a = 0.163. However, the detection rate remains fairly high, at 72 %. NVSS and Commander thus agree on the existence of the set of sources, but disagree significantly on their amplitudes.

        <p>In this Appendix, we present supporting plots relevant for the CMB discussion. These complement and elucidate the analyses and results presented in the main text, and are useful for reference purposes. Figures G.4 and G.5 show enlargements of the odd-even and half-mission half-difference maps for the same region. In these maps, notable qualitative differences between the four CMB maps are observed, perhaps the most striking of which is the effect of different point source treatments adopted by the four pipelines. For instance, in the half-mission splits one can clearly see bright source residuals in the temperature maps for Commander, NILC, and SMICA, but not for SEVEM. These are due to changes in the amplitude of point sources between both periods of observations, which show up when subtracting the half-mission splits. 
            <rs type="software">SEVEM</rs> does not present these residuals because it explicitly inpaints known sources positions in each split, and therefore it reduces significantly this contaminant emission in the half-mission data before constructing the half-difference maps. In the case of the SMICA polarization maps, one can also see outlines of the processing mask adopted for inpainting in that case.
        </p>
        <p>Another type of qualitative difference is seen between Commander on the one side, and the other three codes on the other side. Commander accounts explicitly for spatial variations in instrumental sensitivity at each frequency during Wiener filtering, which corresponds to evaluating an exact inverse-noisevariance weighting pixel-by-pixel in the different channels. This procedure produces somewhat more uniform effective residual maps than the other three codes.Another type of qualitative difference is seen between Commander on the one side, and the other three codes on the other side.

G.6-G.9 show a single Gaussian-constrained realization evaluated for each of the cleaned CMB maps, with the inpainting mask shown in Fig. 10 applied. The temperature maps are shown at 5 FWHM resolution, and the polarization maps are shown at 80 FWHM resolution. These maps are primarily intended for presentation purposes, rather than scientific analysis, since their noise properties are complicated. If similar constrained realizations are required for quantitative analysis, we recommend users to employ a Gibbs sampler, for instance as implemented in 
            <rs type="software">Commander</rs>, to produce an ensemble of such realizations, which then collectively may be used to propagate uncertainties.

        <p>Finally, for illustration, Fig. G.10 shows one of the first halfmission noise simulations at 80 FWHM resolution propagated through the four component separation methods. The simulation contains both instrumental noise and residual systematic effects. Some residual systematics can be seen in the Galactic plane, and are especially apparent in the SEVEM intensity map. These residuals come mainly from the 545 GHz simulated map, which seems to have larger systematics than the other channels. This explains why this structure is not visible in polarization, and also why the greatest effect is on SEVEM, which gives greater weight to this channel than the other methods. Since the maps have been smoothed to 80 , the residuals extend beyond their original locations. Nevertheless, the amplitude of these residuals is relatively small in absolute values, and moreover, they are mostly contained within the common confidence mask (marked in red), even without considering an extended version of the mask that should take into account the additional smoothing of the map. Therefore, we do not expect these residuals to affect significantly the analysis carried out with the simulations. The NILC intensity map has higher noise at this resolution than the other pipelines, consistent with what has been seen in previous figures. Figure G.11 shows the same plot for one even-ring, split-noise simulation, from which similar conclusions can be derived.Finally, for illustration, Fig. G.10 shows one of the first halfmission noise simulations at 80 FWHM resolution propagated through the four component separation methods.
