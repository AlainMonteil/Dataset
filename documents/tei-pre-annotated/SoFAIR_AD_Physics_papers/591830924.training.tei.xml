        <p>In this paper, we obtain the exact traveling solutions of the M-fractional generalized reaction Duffing model and density dependent M-fractional diffusion reaction equation by using three fertile,</p>
        <p>and (1/G ′ )-expansion methods. These methods contribute a variety of exact traveling wave solutions to the scientific literature. The obtained solutions are also verified for the aforesaid equations through symbolic soft computations. Furthermore, some results are explained through numerical simulations that show the novelty of our work. Moreover, we observe that all the solutions are new and an excellent contribution in the existing literature of solitary wave theory.</p>
        <p>Nonlinear fractional differential equations (NFDEs) occur more frequently in engineering applications and different research areas [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]. Then, many real-life problems can be modeled by ordinary or partial differential equations involving the derivatives of fractional order. In order to better understand and apply these physical phenomena in practical scientific research, it is important to find their exact solutions. Finding exact solutions of most of the NFDEs is not easy, so searching and constructing exact solutions of NFDEs is a continuing investigation.</p>
        <p>Recently, many powerful methods for obtaining exact solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations (NLPDEs) have been presented such as, Hirota's bilinear method [9], modified expansion function method [10], sine-cosine method [11], tanh-method [12], Adomin decomposition method [13,14], variational iteration method [15,16], homotopy perturbation method [17], homotopy analysis method [18], Laplace iterative method [19], nonlinear Schrodinger equation [20][21][22], Boussinesq fractional type model [23]. Periodic-type solutions have been investigated by implementing the Variational principal method of the KMN equation in the (2 + 1) -dimensional form [24], Riccati equation method [25], tanh-expansion method [26], extended direct algebraic method [27][28][29][30][31], Kudryashov method [32], Exp-function method [33], the modified extended exp-function method [34], Fexpansion method [35], the Backlund transformation method [36,37], reductive perturbation method [38], the extended tanh-method [39,40], Jacobi elliptic function expansion methods [41 -43], the residual power series method [44], extended sinh-Gordon equation expansion method [45] and different other methods [46][47][48][49][50].</p>
        <p>The primary prospect of this paper is to determine the exact solutions of the fractional generalized reaction Duffing model [51] ∂ 2α u(x, t) ∂t 2α + p ∂ 2α u(x, t) ∂x 2α + qu(x, t) + ru 2 (x, t) + su 3 (x, t) = 0, t &gt; 0, 0 &lt; α⩽1, (1) and nonlinear fractional diffusion-reaction equation ∂ α u(x, t) ∂t α + ku(x, t) ∂ α u(x, t) ∂x α = D ∂ 2α u(x, t) ∂x 2α + au(x, t) -bu 2 (x, t), t &gt; 0, 0 &lt; α⩽1, (2) with M-fractional derivative [52] based on three different methods, the (G ′ /G, 1/G) -expansion method [53,54], the modified ( G ′ /G 2 ) -expansion method [55] and the (1/G ′ ) -expansion method [56]. These methods are frequently used to find the different types of the exact solutions of the NLPDEs. The main concept of the two variables (G ′ /G, 1/G) -expansion method is that the exact traveling wave solutions of nonlinear evolution equations (NLEEs) can be written as a polynomial in two variables (G ′ /G) and (1/G), in which G = G(η) satisfies a second order linear ODE G ′ ′ (η) + λG(η) = μ, where λ and μ are constants. For these methods, the degree of the polynomials can be evaluated by a taking homogenous balance between the highest-order derivatives and nonlinear terms in the given nonlinear PDEs. Besides, the coefficients of the polynomial can be determined by solving a set of algebraic equations resulting from the process of using the methods. For examples, Hafiz [57] determined the close form solutions of the fractional generalized reaction Duffing model and the density dependent fractional diffusion reaction equation by (G ′ /G, 1/G)-expansion method. Traveling wave solutions of the Zakharov and nonlinear Kdv-mKdv equations have been found by Li et al [53] and Zayed et al [54]. The general solutions of the fifth order NLEEs and the Burger KPequation have been obtained in [58,59]. Exact traveling wave solution of nonlinear fractional evolution equations obtained by Sirisubtawee [60]. By using the modified</p>
        <p>expansion method, traveling wave solutions have been found for the nonlinear Schrodinger equation along the third-order dispersion [55]. Different types of traveling wave solutions of the Fokas-Lenells equations have been determined by this method [61]. Aljahdaly found the general exact traveling wave solutions to the NLEEs in [62]. Dragon and Donmez [63] obtained the traveling wave solutions of the Gardner equation and their applications to the different physical plasma. Exact solutions of nonlinear and supernonlinear traveling wave's solutions for Sharma-Tasso-Olver (STO) equations are obtained by Ali et al. [64].</p>

( 14) can be converted into a polynomial in term of (1/G ′ ) Equating each coefficient of the polynomial to zero yields a system of algebraic equations.
