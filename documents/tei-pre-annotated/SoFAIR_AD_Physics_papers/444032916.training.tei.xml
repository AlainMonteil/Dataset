        <p>Nearly a quarter of a century has passed since it was predicted that submillimetre observations could provide important insights into the nature of galaxies in the early Universe beyond the reach of optical and near-infrared surveys (Blain &amp; Longair 1993). If early star-forming galaxies contained dust then ultraviolet photons should be reprocessed through the far-infrared (Hildebrand 1983) and redshifted into the submillimetre. Early observations certainly showed that some high-redshift sources are emitting a large fraction of their bolometric emission in the rest-frame far-infrared, detectable in the submillimetre, with integrated luminosities comparable to or exceeding local ultraluminous (ULIRG, 10 12 L⊙) infrared galaxies (Rowan-Robinson et al. 1991;Clements et al. 1992). We now know that the far-infrared background (FIRB, Puget et al. 1996;Lagache et al. 1998;Fixsen et al. 1998) represents about half of the energy density associated with star formation integrated over the history of the Universe (Dole et al. 2006) and the peak of the volume averaged star formation rate density (SFRD) occurred at z ∼ 1-3, to which submillimetre sources are expected to contribute significantly (Devlin et al. 2009). Identifying and characterising the galaxies contributing to the FIRB was (and remains) a major goal, and motivates blank-field submillimetre surveys.Nearly a quarter of a century has passed since it was predicted that submillimetre observations could provide important insights into the nature of galaxies in the early Universe beyond the reach of optical and near-infrared surveys (Blain &amp; Longair 1993).

        <p>About two decades ago the first submillimetre maps of the high-redshift Universe were made (Smail et al. 1997;Barger et al. 1998;Hughes et al. 1998;Lilly et al. 1999), opening a new window onto early galaxies. With twenty years of follow-up work across the electromagnetic spectrum we now have a good grasp of the nature of 'Submillimetre Galaxies' (SMGs) and their cosmological significance1 . Nevertheless, the picture is far from complete. SMGs selected at 850µm lie at z ≈ 2-3 (e.g. Chapman et al. 2005, Pope et al. 2005;Wardlow et al. 2011;Simpson et al. 2014;Koprowski et al. 2014), are massive (Swinbank et al. 2004;Hainline et al. 2011;Michalowski et al. 2012), gas-rich (Greve et al. 2005;Tacconi et al. 2006Tacconi et al. , 2008;;Engel et al. 2010;Carilli et al. 2010;Bothwell et al. 2013) and are associated with large supermassive black holes (Alexander et al. 2005(Alexander et al. , 2008;;Wang et al. 2013). These properties make SMGs the obvious candidates for the progenitor population of massive elliptical galaxies today, seen at a time of rapid assembly a few billion years after the Big Bang (Lilly et al. 1999;Genzel et al. 2003;Swinbank et al. 2006), with star formation rates in the range 100-1000 M⊙ yr -1 derived from their integrated infrared luminosities (e.g. Magnelli et al. 2012;Swinbank et al. 2014).About two decades ago the first submillimetre maps of the high-redshift Universe were made (Smail et al. 1997;Barger et al. 1998;Hughes et al. 1998;Lilly et al. 1999), opening a new window onto early galaxies.

        <p>The formation mechanism of SMGs remains in debate: by analogy with local ULIRGs, which are almost exclusively merging systems, it is predicted that SMGs form during major mergers of gas-dominated discs (Baugh et al. 2005;Ivison et al. 2012), triggering starbursts and central black hole growth. There is certainly observational evidence to support this, perhaps most convincingly in morphology and gas kinematics (e.g. Tacconi et al. 2010;Swinbank et al. 2010;Alaghband-Zadeh et al. 2012;Chen et al. 2015). On the other hand, hydrodynamic simulations may be able to reproduce the properties of SMGs without the need for mergers, for example if there is a prolonged (∼1 Gyr) phase of gas accretion which drives high star formation rates, where cooling is accelerated through metal enrichment at early times (e.g. Narayanan et al. 2015, see also Davé et al. 2010). In recent semi-analytic models, starbursts triggered by bar instabilities in galaxy discs are the dominant mechanism producing SMGs in model universes (Lacey et al. 2015), and indeed there is some empirical evidence that SMGs have optical/near-infrared morpholigies consistent with discs (e.g. Targett et al. 2013).The formation mechanism of SMGs remains in debate: by analogy with local ULIRGs, which are almost exclusively merging systems, it is predicted that SMGs form during major mergers of gas-dominated discs (Baugh et al. 2005;Ivison et al. 2012), triggering starbursts and central black hole growth.

        <p>Observations in the 850µm atmospheric window offer a unique probe of the distant Universe, owing to the so-called 'negative k-correction' (Blain &amp; Longair 1993). For cosmological sources, the 850µm band probes the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the cold dust continuum emission of carbonaceous and silicate grains in thermal equilibrium in the stellar ultraviolet radiation field. As the thermal spectrum is redshifted, cosmological dimming is compensated for by increasing power as one 'climbs' the Rayleigh-Jeans tail as it is redshifted through the band. Thus, two sources of equal luminosity will be observed with roughly the same flux density at 850µm at z ≈ 0.5 and z ≈ 10. As a guide, a galaxy in the ultraluminous class (with LIR ≈ 10 12 L⊙) is observed with a flux density of 1-2 mJy at 850µm over most of cosmic history (Blain et al. 2002). For this reason, flux limited surveys at 850µm offer the opportunity to sample huge cosmic volumes, potentially probing well into the epoch of re-ionization.Observations in the 850µm atmospheric window offer a unique probe of the distant Universe, owing to the so-called 'negative k-correction' (Blain &amp; Longair 1993).

        <p>Despite the large redshift depth probed by deep 850µm surveys, the solid angle subtended by existing surveys, and their sensitivity, has been bounded by technology: until recently, submillimetre cameras have been limited in field-of-view and sensitivity that has made degree-scale mapping difficult. However, submillimetre imaging technology has blossomed over the past twenty years. At first only single channel broadband submillimeter photometers were available in (e.g. Duncan et al. 1990), making survey work impossible. Then the first cameras came online, mounted on 10-15 m single dish telescopes such as the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) and the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT): the Submillimeter High Angular Resolution Camera (SHARC, Wang et al. 1996) and the Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array (SCUBA, Holland et al. 1999) using small arrays of 10s of bolometers covering just a few arcminutes field of view. These arrays enabled the first extragalactic submillimetre surveys (Smail et al. 1997;Hughes et al. 1998), but covering a cosmologically representative solid angle at the necessary depth was still tremendously expensive in terms of observing time.Despite the large redshift depth probed by deep 850µm surveys, the solid angle subtended by existing surveys, and their sensitivity, has been bounded by technology: until recently, submillimetre cameras have been limited in field-of-view and sensitivity that has made degree-scale mapping difficult.

        <p>Further cameras based on bolometer arrays were developed through the late 1990s: Bolocam (Glenn et al. 1998), MAMBO (Kreysa et al. 1998), SHARC-II (Dowell et al. 2002), LABOCA (Siringo et al. 2009) and AzTEC (Wilson et al. 2008) and the scale of extragalactic submillimetre surveys grew in tandem (e.g. Eales et al. 2000;Scott et al. 2002Scott et al. , 2006;;Borys et al. 2003;Webb et al. 2003;Greve et al. 2004;Coppin et al. 2006;Weiss et al. 2009;Scott et al. 2010, 2012, Austermann et al. 2010). Unfortunately the semiconductor technology underlying the first and second generation of submillimetre cameras is not scalable, limiting bolometer arrays to around 100 pixels. A solution was found in superconducting transistion edge sensors (TES, see Irwin et al. 1995) coupled with Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) amplifiers, that allowed for the construction of submillimetre sensitive bolometer arrays an order of magnitude larger than previously achieved. Clearly this opened up the possibility of performing much larger, more efficient submillimetre surveys than had ever been possible before from the ground.Further cameras based on bolometer arrays were developed through the late 1990s: Bolocam (Glenn et al. 1998), MAMBO (Kreysa et al. 1998), SHARC-II (Dowell et al. 2002), LABOCA (Siringo et al. 2009) and AzTEC (Wilson et al. 2008) and the scale of extragalactic submillimetre surveys grew in tandem (e.g. Eales et al. 2000;Scott et al. 2002Scott et al. , 2006;;Borys et al. 2003;Webb et al. 2003;Greve et al. 2004;Coppin et al. 2006;Weiss et al. 2009;Scott et al. 2010, 2012, Austermann et al. 2010).

        <p>The second generation SCUBA camera, SCUBA-2, on the JCMT is the first of such large format instruments using TES technology (Holland et al. 2013). SCUBA-2 comprises two arrays (for the 450µm and 850µm bands) of 5120 bolometers each, covering an 8 arcminute field of view. With mapping speeds (to equivalent depth) over an order of magnitude faster than its predecessor, SCUBA-2 has enabled a huge leap in submillimetre survey science. TES focal plane arrays have also formed the basis of other recent submillimetre instrumentation, such as the South Pole Telescope (Carlstrom et al. 2011) and Atacama Cosmology Telescope (Swetz et al. 2011). Future large format submillimetre cameras are likely to make increasing use of Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDS, Day et al. 2003): the New Instrument of KIDS Arrays (NIKA2) on the 30 metre Institut de Radioastronomie Millimétrique (IRAM) telescope (Monfardini et al. 2010) uses this new detector technology.The second generation SCUBA camera, SCUBA-2, on the JCMT is the first of such large format instruments using TES technology (Holland et al. 2013).

        <p>Soon after commissioning of SCUBA-2, five JCMT 'Legacy Surveys' (JLS) commenced. The largest of these is the JCMT SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey (S2CLS). In this paper we present the wide 850µm survey component of the S2CLS, presenting maps and a source catalogue for public use. This paper is organised as follows: in §2 we define the survey and describe data reduction and cataloguing procedures; in section §3 we present the maps and catalogues and in §4 we use these data to measure the number counts of 850µm-selected sources with the best statistical precision to date, including an analysis of the impact of cosmic variance on scales of ∼1 degree. We summarize the paper in §5. Where relevant, we adopt a fiducial ΛCDM cosmology with Ωm = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7 and H0 = 70 km s -1 Mpc -1 .Soon after commissioning of SCUBA-2, five JCMT 'Legacy Surveys' (JLS) commenced.

        <p>The S2CLS survey has two tiers: wide and deep. The wide tier covers several well-explored extragalactic survey fields: Akari-Northern Ecliptic Pole, COSMOS, Extended Groth Strip, GOODS-North, Lockman Hole North, SSA22 and UKIDSS-UDS (Figure 1, Table 1), mapping at 850µm during conditions where the zenith optical depth at 225 GHz was 0.05 &lt; τ225 0.1 and field elevations exceeded 30 degrees. In the deep tier several deep 'keyhole' regions within the wide fields were mapped when τ225 0.05, conditions suitable for obtaining 450µm maps which require the lowest opacities (Geach et al. 2013). Note that SCUBA-2 simultaneously records 450µm and 850µm photons, and while the complementary 450µm data exist for the wide 850µm maps we present here, they have not been processed, since they are not expected to be of sufficient quality given the observing conditions. In this paper we present the maps (Figure 1) and catalogue from the wide tier only.The S2CLS survey has two tiers: wide and deep.

        <p>The S2CLS was conducted for just over three years, from December 2011 to February 2015; Figure 2 shows the time distribution of observations during the survey. The wide tier used the PONG mapping strategy for large fields, whereby the array is slewed around the target (map centre) in a path that 'bounces' off the rectangular edge of the defined map area in a manner reminiscent of the classic arcade game (Thomas et al. 2014). The PONG pattern ensures that the array makes multiple passes back and forth between the map extremes, filling the square mapping area. To ensure uniform coverage the field is rotated 10-15 times (depending on map size) during an observation, resulting in a circular field with uniform sensitivity over the nominal mapping area (but with science-usable area beyond this, see §2.4.1). Scanning speeds were 280 ′′ sec -1 for maps of size 900 ′′ up to 600 ′′ sec -1 for the largest single map of 3300 ′′ . Observations were limited to 30-40 minutes each to monitor variations in observing conditions, with regular pointing calibrations performed throughout the night. Typical pointing corrections are of order ∼1 ′′ between observations. In addition to the zenithal opacity constraints described above, elevation constraints were also imposed: to ensure sufficiently low airmass, targets were only observed when above 30 degrees, and a maximum elevation constraint of 70 degrees was also imposed (only relevant for the COSMOS field). This high elevation constraint was set because it was found that the telescope could not keep pace with the alt-az demands of the scanning pattern, resulting in detrimental artifacts in the maps. Since the Lockman Hole North field is observable during COSMOS transit, the strategy was simply to switch targets as COSMOS rose above 70 degrees.The S2CLS was conducted for just over three years, from December 2011 to February 2015; Figure 2 shows the time distribution of observations during the survey.

        <p>For all but the EGS and COSMOS field, the targets were mapped with single PONG scans with diameters ranging from 900-3300 ′′ (Table 1). The EGS was mapped using a chain of six 900 ′′ PONG maps (each slightly overlapping) to optimise coverage of the multiwavelength data along the multiwavelength strip. In COS-MOS the mapping strategy was a mosaic consisting of a central 900 ′′ PONG and four 2700 ′′ PONG maps offset by 1147 ′′ in RA and Dec. from the central map, forming a 2 × 2 grid of 'petals' around the central PONG, with some overlap. This was deemed preferable to obtaining a single very large PONG map encompassing the full field, allowing depth to be built-up in each tile sequentially. Only ∼50 per cent of the COSMOS area was completed to full depth, due to the end of JCMT operations by the original partners. The full 2 × 2-degree field is now being completed as part of a followon project 'S2-COSMOS' (PI: Ian Smail and J. Simpson et al. 2016 in preparation).

        <p>Each SCUBA-2 bolometer records a timestream, where the signal is a contribution of background (mainly sky and ambient emission), astronomical signal and noise. The basic principle of the data reduction is to extract astronomical signal from these timestreams and map them onto a two dimensional celestial projection. We have used the Dynamical Iterative Map-Maker (DIMM) within the Sub-Millimetre Common User Reduction Facility (SMURF; Chapin et al. 2013). We refer readers to Chapin et al.

        <p>iterative process that aims to fit the data with a model comprising a common-mode fluctuating atmospheric signal, positive astronomical signal and instrumental and fine-scale atmospheric noise. The common mode modelling is performed independently for each SCUBA-2 sub-array, deriving a template for the average signal seen by all the bolometers. The common mode is then removed, and an extinction correction is applied (Dempsey et al. 2013). Next, a filtering step is performed in the Fourier domain, which rejects power at frequencies corresponding to angular scales θ &gt; 150 ′′ and θ &lt; 4 ′′ . The next step is to estimate the astrononomical signal. This is done by gridding the time-streams onto the celestial projection; since each pixel will be sampled many times by independent bolometers (slewing over the sky in the PONG scanning pattern), then the positive signal in a given pixel can be taken to be an accurate estimate of the astronomical signal (assuming the previous steps have eliminated all other sources of emission or spikes, etc.). This model of the astronomical signal is then projected back to a time-stream and subtracted from the data. Finally, a noise model is estimated for each bolometer by measuring the residual, which is then used to weight the data during the mapping process in additional steps. The iterative process above runs until convergence is met. In this case, we execute a maximum of 20 iterations, or terminate the process when the map tolerance ∆χ 2 reaches 0.05.iterative process that aims to fit the data with a model comprising a common-mode fluctuating atmospheric signal, positive astronomical signal and instrumental and fine-scale atmospheric noise.

        <p>S2CLS obtained many individual scans of each field. The DIMM allows for all the scans to be simultaneously reduced in the manner described above. However, we adopt an approach where the DIMM is only given individual observations, producing a set of maps for each target field which can then be co-added into a final stack. For this we use the PICARD recipe mosaic jcmt images which uses the WCSMOSAIC task within the 
            <rs type="software">STARLINK KAPPA</rs> package, weighting each input image by the inverse variance per pixel. With a set of individual observations for each field we can also construct maps of sub-sets of the data and produce jackknife maps where a random 50% of the images are inverted, thus removing astronomical signal in the final stack, and generating sourcefree noise realisations of each field (Figure 4); useful for certain statistical tests.

Contours are at steps of 0.05 mJy starting at 0.8 mJy.

The map is then convolved with the smoothed beam. A flux conversion factor of 591 Jy beam -1 pW -1 is applied to give the maps units of flux density. This canonical calibration is the average value derived from observations of hundreds of standard submillimetre calibrators observed during the S2CLS campaign (Dempsey et al. 2013). The filtering steps employed in the data reduction, including the matchfiltering step, introduce a slight (10%) loss of response to point sources.

        <p>The JCMT pointing is regularly checked against standard calibrators during observations, with typical pointing drift corrections typically of order 1-2 ′′ ; similar to the pixel scale at which the maps are gridded. To improve the astrometric refinement of the final co-added maps we adopt a maximal signal-to-noise stacking technique: for each field we use a mid-infrared selected catalogue and stack the submillimetre maps at the positions of reference sources to measure a high-significance statistical detection. We repeat the process many times, updating the world coordinate system reference pixel coordinates at each step with small ∆α and ∆δ increments. The goal is to find the (∆α, ∆δ) that maximise the signalto-noise of the stack in the central pixel. We iterate over several levels of refinement until no further change in (∆α, ∆δ) is required. The average changes to the astrometric solution are of order 1-2 ′′ , comparable to the pixel scale and similar to the source positional uncertainty (see §2.5.2).

Flux boosting is the overestimation of source flux when measurements are made in the presence of noise and is related to both Eddington and Note that the completeness falls to zero at 1 mJy as this corresponds to the limit of the injected source model; in practice it is possible that sub-mJy sources could be boosted above the detection limit. The 50% and 80% limits of each field are listed in Table 2.</p>

The empirical distributions are truncated at 1 mJy because this is the faint limit of the injected source distribution; clearly we can not track individual sources fainter than this. An identical counts model is used as a prior in the Bayesian approach, but note that the posterior flux density distribution does extend below 1 mJy; this is because it is effectively the product of a Gaussian (the observed flux density and instrumental uncertainty) and the histogram of pixel values in a map of sources drawn from the model number counts, convolved with the beam. The two methods return similar results, although the empirical method systematically predicts a slightly smaller boosting factor B = Sobs/Strue than the Bayesian approach, with the two methods converging as Sobs increases.

        <p>There are two important differences in the deboosting methods that may explain this: (i) the Bayesian approach does not consider noise (aside from the confusion noise arising from convolving the fake map with the beam), and, related, (ii) the posterior flux distribution derived in Equation 4 is not necessarily measured 'at peak', i.e. does not consider that the recovered position of a source can shift due to the presence of noise; in the empirical method, we account for such shifts. This relates to the 'bias-to-peak' discussed by Austermann et al. (2010). We adopt the 'empirical' approach in this work to deboost observed fluxes: we draw samples from the distribution of Strue for a given (Sobs, σ) and calculate the mean and variance of these true fluxes, with the latter providing the uncertainty on the deboosted flux density (provided in the source catalogue). We summarise the empirically derived completeness and boosting for each field, visualised in the plane of flux density and local instrumental noise, in Figure 10. In Figure 11 we show the average flux boosting as a function of signal-to-noise ratio in each field, indicating that at fixed detection significance, the level of flux boosting is consistent across the survey, with observed flux densities approximately 20% higher on average than the intrinsic flux density at the 5σ level.

        <p>The surface density of sources per observed flux density interval dN/dS -of a cosmological population is a simple measure of source abundance and a powerful tool for model comparisons. To measure the counts, for each catalogued source we first deboost the observed flux density using the empirical approach described in §2.5.1, and then apply the corresponding completeness correction for the deboosted (i.e. 'true') flux density. When deboosting, we consider the full intrinsic flux distribution as estimated by our simulation, accounting for the fact that a range of intrinsic flux densities can map onto an observed flux density. Therefore, we evaluate dN/dS 1000 times; in each calculation every source is deboosted by randomly sampling the intrinsic flux distribution and completeness correcting each deboosted source accordingly. We take the mean of these 1000 realisations as the final number counts, with the standard deviation of dN/dS in each bin as an additional uncertainty (to the Poisson error). We make a correction for each source based on the probability it is a false positive, using the empirical determination described in §2.5.3.The surface density of sources per observed flux density interval dN/dS -of a cosmological population is a simple measure of source abundance and a powerful tool for model comparisons.

        <p>While the various corrections are intended to recover the 'true' underlying source distribution, it is important to confirm if any systematic biases remain, since the procedure for actually identifying sources is imperfect, as is the 'recovery' of injected model sources used to estimate flux boosting and completeness. To examine this we inject three different source count models into a jackknife noise map (of the UKIDSS-UDS field). One model is identical to the Schechter form used in §2.6.1 (Equation 3); in the other two models we simply adjust the faint end slope to γ = 0.4 and γ = 2.4, keeping the other parameters fixed. With knowledge of the exact model counts injected into the map, we can compare to the recovered counts before and after corrections have been applied. Figure 14 shows ([dN/dS]rec -[dN/dS]true)/[dN/dS]true for the three models before and after corrections. In the absence of correction, flux boosting tends to result in the systematic overestimation of the number counts in all but the faintest flux bin, where incompleteness dominates, and the overestimation increases with increasing γ, as expected. After the corrections have been applied, there remains a slight underestimation in the counts in the faintest bin (3-4 mJy) at the 10% level, but in general the corrected 'observed' counts are in excellent agreement with the input model. The origin for the slight discrepancy is not clear, but it is likely that it simply stems from subtle effects not modelled well by our recovery simulation, and in particular what consititutes a 'recovered' source. One can observe a systematic effect that the γ = 2.4 and γ = 0.4 models are overand under-estimated (respectively) at approximately the 10% level for the full observed flux range, but this is not a significant systematic uncertainty compared to shot noise expected from Poisson statistics. Given that the fiducial model we use in the completeness simulation is based on observed 850µm number counts, and the γ = 2.4 and γ = 0.4 models are rather extreme compared to empirical constraints, we consider this test as an adequate demonstration that our measured number counts are robust. Nevertheless, we apply a simple correction to the observed corrected counts by fitting a spline to the residual model counts in Figure 14 and apply this as a 'tweak' factor to the number counts on a bin-by-bin basis.While the various corrections are intended to recover the 'true' underlying source distribution, it is important to confirm if any systematic biases remain, since the procedure for actually identifying sources is imperfect, as is the 'recovery' of injected model sources used to estimate flux boosting and completeness.

As a guide, there are about ten sources with flux densities greater than 10 mJy per square degree.

We split the S2CLS survey (barring GOODS-N) into 16 independent fields of identical size to the GOODS-N field and count the number of sources in each field with deboosted flux densities greater than the 50% completeness limit in GOODS-N (S850 ≈ 4 mJy). The mean number of sources is 18, with a standard deviation over the 16 fields of 5 sources, roughly consistent with the shot noise expected from Poisson statistics. The number of sources at the same limit in GOODS-N is 32 ± 6. It is clear from this simple analysis that the error budget on the counts is dominated by Poisson noise, but we can estimate what the expected contribution from cosmic variance is. Following the method of Trenti &amp; Stiavelli (2008) which estimates the relative excess uncertainty in number counts due to cosmic variance in a flux limit survey, we find a contribution of 15-20% to the observed counts on scales of the GOODS-N field (note, we assume a Press-Schechter approach for the halo statistics). This assumes a mean redshift of z = 2.2 and ∆z = 1 and a wide range of halo filling factors, f = 0.1-1, corresponding to a mean bias of b = 2.7-4.3 for the SMG population. We can therefore quantify the significance of the tentative overdensity in GOODS-N as the difference in the number of sources in this field to the average over a region 16 times larger in an independent field (i.e. the rest of the S2CLS). We find ∆S(&gt; 4mJy) = 14 ± 7 taking into account Poisson noise and cosmic variance. Thus, the overdensity is signficant at only the 2σ level. GOODS-N is one of the most exhaustively studied extragalactic fields, and it is worth noting that overdensities of SMGs and star-forming galaxies have previously been reported here. For example, Daddi et al. (2009) report an overdensity of star-forming galaxies at z ≈ 4, including SMGs, and Walter et al. ( 2012) report a z ≈ 5 structure around the source HDF850.1, which happens to be one of the first SMGs to be identified (Hughes et al. 1998).2.1 +1.1 -0.7 ± 0.6 5.5 +1.5 -1.2 ± 0.6 13.5 0.8 +0.8 -0.4 ± 0.4 3.2 +1.2 -0.9 ± 0.5 14.5 0.5 +0.7 -0.3 ± 0.3 2.4 +1.1 -0.8 ± 0.3 15.5 0.3 +0.6 -0.2 ± 0.1 1.8 +1.0 -0.7 ± 0.2 caused by both shot noise and cosmic variance, with the latter defined as the excess variance in addition to Poisson noise (e.g. Somerville et al. 2004).

        <p>At first it proved difficult for semi-analytic models of ΛCDM galaxy formation to reproduce the 850µm number counts (Granato et al. 2000). The model of Baugh et al. (2005) provided a much better match to observed 850µm (and Lyman-break Galaxy) number counts than previously achieved, but required a modification to the initial mass function (IMF) such that bursts of star formation have a more top heavy IMF than 'quiescent' star formation.At first it proved difficult for semi-analytic models of ΛCDM galaxy formation to reproduce the 850µm number counts (Granato et al. 2000).

        <p>While the motivation for this can be linked to astrophysical differences in the conditions of star formation in dense gas-rich starbursts (e.g. 15, and are in reasonable agreement with the data. This model still includes a mildly top heavy IMF (slope x = 1) for starbursts, without which it cannot reproduce the redshift distribution of 850µm selected sources (Chapman et al. 2005;Simpson et al. 2014, see also Hayward et al. 2013). The model predicts a slightly elevated abundance of galaxies below the survey limit, however, an extrapolation of the Schechter fit to the S2CLS counts is in good agreement with the deeper observations of Chen et al. (2013). Nevertheless, the shape of the faint end slope is still to be properly determined empirically, which will most likely be through either a P(D) analysis of confused SCUBA-2 maps (e.g. Condon 1974;Pantanchon et al. 2009;Geach et al. in preparation), with the assistance of gravitational lensing (e.g. Knudsen et al. 2008;Chen et al. 2013) or through 3). Three input models are considered, differing only by the faint end slope γ: a series of fake catalogues are generated for each model by injecting sources into a jackknife map and then recovering them in a manner identical to the real data. In the left panel no deboosting, completeness or false positive correction has been applied to the recovered counts, showing the trend that steeper number counts are generally overpredicted (due to flux boosting) in all but the faint bin where incompleteness dominates. In the right panel the various corrections have been applied, illustrating that we can robustly recover the 'true' number counts, although there is still a slight (10%) underestimation of the counts in the faintest bin. The error bars in both panels reflect the Poisson uncertainties expected in a single field. The dashed line is a spline interpolation of the mean of the three models which we use as an additional tweak factor in measuring the number counts of the population. Interestingly, the two extreme count models we consider are, in general, systematically over and under predicted for the steeper and shallower faint end slope respectively; we discuss this in the main text. deep, unconfused ALMA surveys that can probe to the sub-mJy level, albeit over relatively small areas (e.g. Karim et al. 2013;Ono et al. 2014;Carniani et al. 2015;Oteo et al. 2016;Hatsukade et al. 2016;Dunlop et al. 2016). An important point to consider in comparing number counts to models is the issue of source blending and confusion in low resolution single-dish surveys. Therefore, we also show the results of Cowley et al. (2015), who take the same Lacey et al. (2015) GALFORM model, but predict the number counts after simulating observations with a single dish telescope with the same size beam as JCMT at 850µm. Figure 15 shows that, over the observed flux density range, the beam-convolved predicted counts are consistent with the 'raw' model counts.

        <p>The SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey 15 Figure 16. Field-to-field scatter in the integral number counts, relative to the mean density. The field-to-field scatter (on scales of 0.5-1 • ) across S2CLS is generally within 50% of the mean density, with the exception of GOODS-N, which has hints of an elevated density of SMGs compared to the mean, although this is marginal with the Poisson uncertainties. We discuss this in §3.1. Simpson et al. 2015), and it is important to stress that comparisons of source abundances (between both models and data) should adopt a consistent reference resolution. While the semi-analytic models aim to simultaneously reproduce all the main 'bulk' observational tracers of the galaxy population over cosmic time (i.e. the mass function, luminosity functions, number counts, clustering, etc.) in a single framework, an alternative approach to predicting the submillimetre number counts is through phenomenological modelling. Bethermin et al. (2012) present a model that considers the evolution of the space density of so called 'main sequence' (i.e. normal) star-forming galaxies and luminous starbursts, fitting parametric models (with assumptions about the underlying galaxy SEDs) to observed number counts across the infrared, submillimetre and radio bands. We show the Bethermin et al. model (including the strong lensing contribution) for the SCUBA-2 850µm band in Figure 15. Again, this is in reasonable agreement with the observations over the flux range probed by the observations. The new 850µm number counts presented here could be used to provide improved fits to phenomenological models such as this.The SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey 15 Figure 16.

        <p>We have presented the 850µm maps and catalogues of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey, the largest of the JCMT Legacy Surveys, completed in early 2015. With hundreds of hours of integration time in reasonable submillimetre observing conditions (zenith opacity τ225GHz = 0.05-0.1) S2CLS has mapped seven well-known extragalactic survey fields: UKIDSS-UDS, Akari-NEP, COSMOS, GOODS-N, Extended Groth Strip, Lockman Hole North and SSA22. The total scientifically useful survey area is approximately 5 deg 2 at a sensitivity of under 2 mJy beam -1 , with a median depth per field of approximately 1.2 mJy beam -1 , approaching the confusion limit (which we have determined is approximately σc ≈ 0.8 mJy beam -1 ). This is by far the largest and deepest survey of submillimetre galaxies yet undertaken in this waveband and provides a rich legacy data source. We have detected nearly 3,000 submillimetre sources at the 3.5σ level, an order of magnitude increase in the number of catalogued 850µm-selected sources to date.We have presented the 850µm maps and catalogues of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey, the largest of the JCMT Legacy Surveys, completed in early 2015.

        <p>In this work we have used the S2CLS catalogue to accurately measure the number counts of submillimetre sources, dramatically reducing Poisson errors and allowing us to investigate field-to-field variance. The wide nature of the survey makes it possible to detect large numbers of bright (&gt;10 mJy), but rare (∼10 per square degree), submillimetre sources, and we observe the distinctive upturn in the number counts caused by strong gravitational lensing of high redshift galaxies and a contribution from local sources of submillimetre emission. The S2CLS catalogue and maps offer a route to a tremendous range of follow-up work, both in pin-pointed multi-wavelength identification and follow-up of the catalogued sources (e.g. Simpson et al. 2015ab, Chen et al. 2016) and in statistical analyses of the catalogues and pixel data. Cross-correlation of the submillimetre maps and galaxy catalogues is already proving a treasure trove of discovery, linking UV/optical/near-infraredselected samples to submillimetre emission (Banerji et al. 2015;Coppin et al. 2015;Smith et al. 2016 in preparation;Bourne et al. in preparation). The S2CLS survey subtends an area equivalent to over 10 5 times the ALMA primary beam at 850µm, and the synergy between large area single dish surveys such as S2CLS, and the detailed interferometric follow-up possible with ALMA (and other sensitive (sub)mm interferometers) is clear. High-resolution interferometric follow-up in the submillimetre has already proven efficient and fruitful, with ALMA and SMA imaging of the brightest (&gt;9 mJy) sources revealing a complex morphological mix, allowing us to investigate the true nature of the SMGs identified in large beam single dish surveys (Simpson et al. 2015, Chapman et al. in preparation). We release the 3.5σ-cut catalogue of all S2CLS sources as part of this publication, along with the 850µm maps for exploitation by the community.
