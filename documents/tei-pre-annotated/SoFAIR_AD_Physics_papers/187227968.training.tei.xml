        <p>We present a detailed study of Higgs boson production in association with a single top quark at the LHC, at next-to-leading order accuracy in QCD. We consider total and differential cross sections, at the parton level as well as by matching short distance events to parton showers, for both t-channel and s-channel production. We provide predictions relevant for the LHC at 13 TeV together with a thorough evaluation of the residual uncertainties coming from scale variation, parton distributions, strong coupling constant and heavy quark masses. In addition, for t-channel production, we compare results as obtained in the 4-flavour and 5-flavour schemes, pinning down the most relevant differences between them. Finally, we study the sensitivity to a non-standard-model relative phase between the Higgs couplings to the top quark and to the weak bosons.We present a detailed study of Higgs boson production in association with a single top quark at the LHC, at next-to-leading order accuracy in QCD.

        <p>The first Run of the LHC has already collected compelling evidence that the scalar particle observed at 125 GeV is the one predicted by the Brout-Englert-Higgs symmetry breaking mechanism [1,2] of SU (2) L × U (1) Y as implemented in the Standard Model (SM) [3]. In such minimal case, the strengths of the Higgs boson couplings to the elementary particles, including the Higgs boson itself, are uniquely determined by their masses. While somewhat limited and subject to additional ad hoc assumptions, the first measurements of the Higgs couplings to fermions and vector bosons agree well with the SM predictions [4,5].The first Run of the LHC has already collected compelling evidence that the scalar particle observed at 125 GeV is the one predicted by the Brout-Englert-Higgs symmetry breaking mechanism [1,2] of SU (2) L × U (1) Y as implemented in the Standard Model (SM) [3].

        <p>Such general agreement with the SM expectations and the absence of any evidence (from the LHC itself) of the existence of new states at the TeV scale, motivate a thorough study of the Higgs boson interactions at the Run II. In addition to the coupling strength determinations conducted so far, a e-mail: kentarou.mawatari@vub.ac.be the Lorentz structure of the vertices as well as the possible existence of a relative phase among the couplings need to be fully assessed. In order to gather the necessary information, the widest possible campaign of measurements has to be undertaken, including different production and decay modes of the Higgs boson. In addition, given the limited discriminating power of single channels, a global combination of the relevant measurements will be necessary. To achieve this goal at the LHC one needs to adopt a complete and consistent theoretical framework, able to encompass interactions that go beyond the SM (and possibly to organise them in terms of an ordering principle), and that allows the systematic inclusion of higher-order corrections, both QCD and electroweak (EW).

        <p>This work fits in the above general strategy and focuses on Higgs production in association with a single top quark. As in single top production, at the leading order (LO) in QCD one can organise the production mechanisms into three groups, based on the virtuality of the W boson: t-channel production (Fig. 1), s-channel production (Fig. 2), and associated production with an on-shell W boson. While characterised by a rather small cross section with respect to the main single Higgs production channels (gluon-gluon fusion, vector boson fusion and associated production, and t t H), Higgs and single-top associated production features unique aspects that make this process particularly interesting for Higgs characterisation [8,9].

        <p>The aim of the first part of this work is to provide accurate SM predictions including QCD corrections at next-toleading order (NLO) for t-and s-channel Higgs production in association with a single top quark, as well as reliable estimates for the residual uncertainties in rates and distributions. Particular attention is devoted to the uncertainty related to the different flavour schemes that can be adopted to compute the dominant t-channel production mode. The corresponding SM predictions are the necessary theoretical input to possibly assess the existence of deviations due to new physics (be it resonant or not); to this aim, the study of the uncertainties in total rates as well as in differential distributions becomes of primary importance.The aim of the first part of this work is to provide accurate SM predictions including QCD corrections at next-toleading order (NLO) for t-and s-channel Higgs production in association with a single top quark, as well as reliable estimates for the residual uncertainties in rates and distributions.

In Sect. 3 we focus on the t-channel production mode, with a special attention to the issues connected to the 4-flavour (4F) and 5-flavour (5F) schemes. We describe the settings of the calculation, present results in the SM for total rates up to NLO in QCD and their uncertainties, and finally show relevant differential distributions at NLO matched to a parton shower. In Sect. 4 we shortly consider the s-channel production mechanism, which has a much smaller impact on Higgs phenomenology in the SM. We evaluate the total cross sections and its uncertainties in the SM and show some representative distributions in comparison with the corresponding t-channel ones. In Sect. 5 we study the impact of an anomalous, CP-violating top quark Yukawa interaction on t-channel production, both at the total and differential cross section level.

        <p>In this section we introduce the main features of Higgs production in association with a single top quark. As already mentioned in the introduction, at LO in QCD one can effectively organise the various production mechanisms into three groups, based on the virtuality of the W boson: t-channel production features a space-like W , s-channel production a time-like W , and W -associated production an on-shell W boson. One has to bear in mind that while this classification is certainly useful, it is not physical, being an approximation that holds only at LO and in the 5-flavour scheme. At higher orders in QCD, or using a different flavour scheme to define the processes, the separation becomes increasingly fuzzy, as it will be clarified at the end of this section.In this section we introduce the main features of Higgs production in association with a single top quark.

        <p>As in single top production in the SM, t H production is always mediated by a t W b vertex and therefore it entails the presence of a bottom quark either in the initial (t-channel and W -associated) or in the final state (s-channel). In the case of initial-state bottom quarks, two different approaches, the so-called 4F and 5F schemes, can be followed to perform perturbative calculations.As in single top production in the SM, t H production is always mediated by a t W b vertex and therefore it entails the presence of a bottom quark either in the initial (t-channel and W -associated) or in the final state (s-channel).

        <p>In the 4F scheme one assumes that the typical scale of the hard process Q is not significantly higher than bottom quark mass, which in turn is considerably heavier than QCD , Q m b QCD . Technically, one constructs an effective theory of QCD with only four light flavours, where heavier quarks (bottom and top), being massive, do not contribute to the initial-state proton wave-function (in terms of parton distribution functions (PDFs)), nor to the running of the strong coupling, and they appear only as final-state particles.In the 4F scheme one assumes that the typical scale of the hard process Q is not significantly higher than bottom quark mass, which in turn is considerably heavier than QCD , Q m b QCD .

        <p>In so doing, mass effects in the kinematics of heavy-quark production are correctly taken into account already at the lowest order in perturbation theory. In addition, the matching to parton-shower programs is straightforward, the heavyquark mass acting as an infrared cutoff for inclusive observables. However, limitations might arise when Q m b and one probes kinematic configurations which are dominated by almost collinear g → b b splittings: in this case the accuracy of predictions can be spoiled by large logarithms log(Q 2 /m 2 b ) appearing at all orders in perturbative QCD. Were this the case, such large logarithms would harm the behaviour of a fixed order expansion in α s .In so doing, mass effects in the kinematics of heavy-quark production are correctly taken into account already at the lowest order in perturbation theory.

        <p>This issue can be addressed in the 5F scheme (and improvements thereof), whose aim is to reorganise the perturbative expansion by resumming such logarithms via the DGLAP equations. One starts by assuming Q m b and defines a scheme where power corrections of order m b /Q appear at higher orders in the α s expansion. In practice, one sets the bottom mass to zero and includes bottom quarks in the initial state as proton constituents. 1 In so doing, towers of logarithms associated with the initial-state g → b b splitting are resummed to all orders in perturbation theory by evolving the perturbative bottom quark PDF via the DGLAP equations.This issue can be addressed in the 5F scheme (and improvements thereof), whose aim is to reorganise the perturbative expansion by resumming such logarithms via the DGLAP equations.

        <p>Computations in the 5F scheme are typically much simpler than the corresponding 4F ones, because of the lesser final-state multiplicity and the simpler phase space. This is for example the reason why single-top production is known at NNLO in the 5F scheme [12] while only at NLO in the 4F [13]. For a systematic investigation of the sources of differences between the 4F and 5F schemes in single b-quark and double b-quark induced processes we refer the reader to [14,15], respectively. In short, the 4F and 5F schemes differ in what kind of terms are pushed into the missing higherorder corrections. Therefore, as the accuracy of the predictions for a given observable increases, milder differences should be expected between the schemes. This provides a strong motivation to go at least to NLO accuracy in the computation of the t-channel cross section, in order to reduce the flavour-scheme dependence of the predictions and thus the overall theoretical uncertainty. The final accuracy, however, will depend on the specific observable considered, whose perturbative accuracy can be different in the two schemes.Computations in the 5F scheme are typically much simpler than the corresponding 4F ones, because of the lesser final-state multiplicity and the simpler phase space.

        <p>In the case of (Higgs and) single top production at hadron colliders, the 5F scheme has also the operational advantage that allows an easy separation of the various production mechanisms into the three groups mentioned above. In the 5F scheme the t-channel, s-channel and W -associated production are independent up to NLO and start to interfere only at NNLO, and the W -associated production interferes with t t H starting from NLO. In the 4F, on the other hand, the tchannel at NLO can interfere with the s-channel (at NNLO) and with W -associated production (if the W decays hadronically), and the W -associated production also interferes with t t H already at the tree level. While the former interferences are very small and can be safely neglected if the aim is to evaluate the dominant t-channel cross section, the interference of W -associated production with t t H turns out instead to be quite large. The on-shell W associated production therefore needs a dedicated study that we defer to a separate work.In the case of (Higgs and) single top production at hadron colliders, the 5F scheme has also the operational advantage that allows an easy separation of the various production mechanisms into the three groups mentioned above.

At LO the scale dependence in the 4F scheme is stronger than in the 5F, simply because the 4F calculation starts already at order α s . As expected, predictions at NLO are much more stable under the scale variation than at LO. We find that the 4F and 5F predictions are in better agreement if μ is chosen to be roughly a factor 4 (6) smaller than the typical hard scale of the process m H + m t (H T ) for the static (dynamic) scale choice. This is a known and general feature of b-initiated processes at hadron colliders [14]. At such reduced scales the 4F and 5F predictions are typically in good agreement, and this is indeed what we observe taking the reference scale choice μ 0 as in Eqs. ( 6) and (7).

        <p>In Fig. 3 we also plot two off-diagonal (μ R = μ F ) slices of the NLO cross section surface in the plane (μ R , μ F ), shifted by a factor √ 2 in the direction orthogonal to the diagonal. The effects of off-diagonal scale choices are more pronounced in the 4F scheme than in the 5F, even though in general they are quite modest, except at very low scales, i.e. comparable to m b . We conclude that, for our choice of μ 0 , the diagonal μ R = μ F is sufficiently representative of the scale dependence of the total cross section, when the scale is varied by the usual factor two.

        <p>Now we turn to the PDF, α s (m Z ) and m b uncertainties. In principle these three uncertainties can be correlated. However, the correlations are very small and can be often neglected in combinations. For example, using NNPDF, we have explicitly checked that the combined PDF + α s uncertainty computed with full correlations differs from the one without correlations by 0.1 % at most. In the 4F scheme m b is independent of PDF and α s , while we confirmed that the uncertainty correlation between PDF and m b in the 5F scheme is well below the percent level. Moreover, the correlation between α s and m b is tiny and can be neglected [31]. We note that neglecting correlations allows us to compare PDF uncertainty bands at a common α s value, once central predictions (computed with this common α s ) are dressed with their corresponding fractional PDF uncertainty (computed with each group's dedicated set). This is a known fact and it has been extensively used in recent PDF benchmarks [48].Now we turn to the PDF, α s (m Z ) and m b uncertainties. In principle these three uncertainties can be correlated.

The variations have a modest impact on the total cross section, about 1 % only when both masses are varied in the same direction.

We have compared predictions obtained with the MSTW2008 and CT10 PDF sets and found no difference worth to report. We have also employed the HERWIG6 parton shower to verify that some important conclusions on the difference of the radiation pattern between 4F and 5F schemes were not dependent on shower programs. We estimate the scale dependence by varying μ R and μ F independently by a factor two around the reference dynamic scale H T /6 defined in Eq.

        <p>We start by showing in Fig. 5 differential distributions for the Higgs boson and the top quark (before they decay). The first observation is that NLO distributions in the 4F and 5F schemes are in excellent agreement within their respective uncertainty associated to scale variation, i.e. within the 10 % level. Interestingly, though, differential K factors (information in the insets below) are more pronounced for the 5F than for the 4F scheme, the NLO results in the 5F scheme typically being out of the uncertainties as estimated from scale variation at LO. It should be noted that the LO process in the 5F scheme does not depend on the renormalisation scale, and therefore its smaller uncertainty (especially in the highp T region) can be an artefact of the scheme. Results in the 5F tend to have a scale uncertainty that increases with p T much more than in the 4F, but in most cases the differences are not striking. Slightly larger deviations between 4F and 5F appear only very close to the t H threshold, a region where we expect the 4F scheme to catch the underlying physics already at LO.We start by showing in Fig. 5 differential distributions for the Higgs boson and the top quark (before they decay).

        <p>In Fig. 6 we present distributions for the two hardest jets which are not tagged as b-jets. Jets and b-jets are defined in Eqs. (4) and (5). The contributions from the non-taggable forward b-jets (2.5 &lt; |η| &lt; 4.5) are also denoted by shaded histograms as a reference. The jet with the highest transverse momentum ( j 1 ) tends to be produced in the forward region, very much like in single-top and VBF production. Most of the time this jet can be clearly associated to the light-quark current in the hard scattering. The very good agreement between 4F and 5F is manifest. This is expected as this observable should not be too sensitive on the details of heavy-quark current, as colour connections between the two currents are either vanishing or suppressed at the order in QCD we are working. On the other hand, sizeable differences arise for the second-hardest jet ( j 2 ), which shows a much steeper p T spectrum and tends to be produced centrally. The difference between predictions in the 4F and 5F schemes is often much larger than the scale uncertainty band (which is more pronounced in the 5F scheme in the bulk of the events). We will In Fig. 7 we show the analogous distributions for the btagged jets. These are all the jets containing a b-hadron and falling inside the acceptance of the tracking system, Eq. ( 5). We consider the two hardest b-jets ( j b,1 and j b,2 ) in the event regardless of their origin and, separately, we study the b-jet coming from the top quark decay j b,t (tagged by using Monte Carlo information). The p T spectrum of j b,1 has a rather long tail compared to j b,2 and, at variance with light jets, all the b-jets tend to be produced in the central region. Scale dependence at NLO is rather small in the 4F scheme, never reaching 10 % and being typically around 5 %. Differences between 4F and 5F predictions are visible, specially in the uncertainty band of j b,2 in the 5F scheme; this is of course expected, given that this observable is described only at LO accuracy in this scheme. Quite remarkably, however, these differences at NLO are often significantly less pronounced than in the case of light jets (specially for the second jet), while naively one might expect the b-jet observables to be mostly affected by the flavour-scheme choice. On the other hand, at LO the inadequacy of the 5F scheme to describe b-jets is evident.In Fig. 6 we present distributions for the two hardest jets which are not tagged as b-jets.

        <p>Comparing the transverse momentum of j b,t (first row, right plot in Fig. 7) to the corresponding spectra of j b,1 and j b,2 , it can be inferred that b-jets from the top quark mostly contribute to the hardest b-jet ( j b,1 ) spectrum at low p T .

We conclude this section by studying the jet multiplicities, which are sensitive to the flavour scheme as well as to the choice of the shower scale. As argued in [14], the dynamics of g → b b splitting takes place at a scale which is typically lower than the hard scale of the process m t +m H or H T , affecting the choice for the factorisation scale that one should use to describe t-channel production. An analogous argument could be made also for the shower scale choice [15], which in the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO matching procedure is chosen to be of the order of the partonic centre-of-mass energy in the Born process. In Fig. 8, we study the dependence of jet rates on the flavour scheme as well as on the shower scale, where two different choices of the shower scale are compared: one is the default value, and another is the default value divided by a factor of four. We can see that reducing the parton-shower scale has only a minor impact on the distributions, while a more interesting pattern arises from the choice of the flavour scheme.Fig. 8 Jet rates at NLO + PS accuracy in 4F and 5F schemes with different choices of the shower scales which is described at NLO accuracy, and increases sharply in the highp T ( j b,1 ) region, where the physics is dominated by the transverse dynamics of the g → b b splitting, which is described only at LO.

        <p>For non-b-tagged jets (left panel in Fig. 8), on the other hand, a higher jet multiplicity is clearly observed in the 4F scheme, which implies that harder QCD radiation is favoured in this scheme. Interestingly, the difference is visible already at the 1-jet bin, which is described at NLO accuracy at the matrix-element level. These differences cannot arise from the small component of forward, non-taggable heavy jets; on the contrary, they can be understood by considering jets that come from genuinely light QCD radiation. In Fig. 9 we show explicitly the multiplicity of light jets only (tagged by using Monte Carlo information), both at fixed order in QCD and at NLO matched to parton shower. Our first observation is that results in the 4F and 5F are almost identical at fixed LO (where only the zero and one jet bins are filled). The difference is therefore an effect of higher-order corrections, as it is confirmed by observing the fixed-NLO histograms. We recall that the fixed-order matrix element has a different colour structure in different schemes; in particular, the 4F at LO features a gluon in the initial state (compared to the bquark in the 5F) and an extra b in the final state. The radiation of extra light QCD partons from the g → b b splitting is therefore favoured in the 4F (e.g. an extra gluon can either attach to the initial-state gluon or to one of the b's, while in the 5F it can attach only to the initial-state b). This is indeed what we observe at fixed NLO.For non-b-tagged jets (left panel in Fig. 8), on the other hand, a higher jet multiplicity is clearly observed in the 4F scheme, which implies that harder QCD radiation is favoured in this scheme.

        <p>If the origin of the difference in the jet rates can be traced back to the difference between the LO 4F and 5F colour structures, then one would also expect this difference to be mitigated once higher-order corrections are included. To this aim, we have performed a fixed-order computation of the 2-jet bin in the 5F at NLO accuracy, i.e. calculated t H j j at NLO, within our simulation framework, finding indeed that the rate is significantly enhanced (by ∼60 %), lying much closer to the 4F result. A further hint that the scheme difference is indeed mitigated at higher orders is given by the NLO + PS results, which show that the 2-jet bin in the 4F is reduced by ∼10 % after the shower, while the corresponding 5F one is enhanced by ∼30 % over the fixed-order result. Finally, we have checked that the same results we have found here for single top plus Higgs, occur also in the case of single top production alone. In conclusion, our results suggest that the inclusion of the g → b b splitting in the matrix-element description at the lowest order, i.e. the 4F scheme, allows a wider range of observables relevant for the analyses to be described more accurately.If the origin of the difference in the jet rates can be traced back to the difference between the LO 4F and 5F colour structures, then one would also expect this difference to be mitigated once higher-order corrections are included.

        <p>The first important observation is that while the GF and t t H cross sections are degenerate under y t → -y t (depending quadratically from the top quark Yukawa coupling), in t-channel production this degeneracy is clearly lifted by the interference between diagrams where the Higgs couples to the top quark and to the W boson. In [8,9] it was shown that the t-channel cross section is enhanced by more than one order of magnitude when the strength of the top Yukawa coupling is changed in sign with respect to the SM value. Here we can see how the same enhancement can take place also in the presence a continuous rotation in the scalar-pseudoscalar plane. While not affecting GF (by construction), such a rotation has an impact also on the t t X 0 rate, which is in general lower for a pseudoscalar or CP-mixed state [26]. t-channel production lifts another degeneracy present in GF and t t X 0 , namely α → π -α. Given the partial compensation between the t-channel and t t X 0 cross sections at different values of α, an analysis which could well separate between the two production mechanisms would be needed to put stringent constraints on a CP-violating Higgs coupling to the top quark.The first important observation is that while the GF and t t H cross sections are degenerate under y t → -y t (depending quadratically from the top quark Yukawa coupling), in t-channel production this degeneracy is clearly lifted by the interference between diagrams where the Higgs couples to the top quark and to the W boson.

This means that one should not be concerned by violations of perturbative unitarity at the LHC, as they do not appear for partonic centre-of-mass energies lower than ∼10 TeV [9]. In Fig. 13 we also show the transverse momentum distributions for the Higgs and the top quark. The distributions are well behaved in this case too, not displaying any strong trend in their highp T tails, i.e anything that could suggest a unitarity violating behaviour.We remind that the enhancement of the t-channel cross section takes place mostly at threshold, as one can clearly see in the left plot of Fig. 13.

On the other hand, the 4-flavour scheme is in general able to provide accurate predictions for a wider set of observables, including those of the spectator b-quark and extra jets. In addition to t-channel production in the SM, we have also briefly presented the results for the subdominant s-channel production, highlighting the differences in the most important distributions with respect to the corresponding ones of t-channel production. Finally, we have provided results (total cross sections as well as a few representative distributions) for the case where an explicit CP violation is present in the coupling between the top quark and the Higgs boson, making it clear that in this case Higgs associated production with a single top could provide complementary and very valuable information to that of t t H production.
