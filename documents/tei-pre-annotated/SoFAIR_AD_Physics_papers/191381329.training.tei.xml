        <p>An angular analysis of the B 0 → K * 0 (→ K + π -)µ + µ -decay is presented. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb -1 of pp collision data collected at the LHCb experiment. The complete angular information from the decay is used to determine CP -averaged observables and CP asymmetries, taking account of possible contamination from decays with the K + π -system in an S-wave configuration. The angular observables and their correlations are reported in bins of q 2 , the invariant mass squared of the dimuon system. The observables are determined both from an unbinned maximum likelihood fit and by using the principal moments of the angular distribution. In addition, by fitting for q 2 -dependent decay amplitudes in the region 1.1 &lt; q 2 &lt; 6.0 GeV 2 /c 4 , the zero-crossing points of several angular observables are computed. A global fit is performed to the complete set of CP -averaged observables obtained from the maximum likelihood fit. This fit indicates differences with predictions based on the Standard Model at the level of 3.4 standard deviations. These differences could be explained by contributions from physics beyond the Standard Model, or by an unexpectedly large hadronic effect that is not accounted for in the Standard Model predictions.An angular analysis of the B 0 → K * 0 (→ K + π -)µ + µ -decay is presented.

        <p>The decay B 0 → K * 0 µ + µ -proceeds via a b → s quark flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) transition. In the Standard Model (SM) the decay is therefore forbidden at tree level and occurs, at lowest order, via electroweak penguin and box processes. In extensions of the SM, new particles may enter in competing processes and can significantly change the branching fraction of the decay and the angular distribution of the final-state particles. Angular observables are of particular interest, since theoretical predictions of such observables tend to be less affected by the hadronic uncertainties associated with the B 0 → K * 0 transition. Throughout this paper K * 0 is used to refer to the K * (892) 0 resonance.The decay B 0 → K * 0 µ + µ -proceeds via a b → s quark flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) transition.

        <p>The LHCb collaboration previously determined a set of angular observables in the B 0 → K * 0 µ + µ -decay, 1 using data collected during 2011, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb -1 [1]. Different subsets of these angular observables have also been measured by the BaBar, Belle, CDF and CMS collaborations [2][3][4][5][6][7] and all of these measurements are in good agreement with SM predictions. The LHCb collaboration has also used the 2011 dataset to determine an alternative set of angular observables that have reduced theoretical uncertainties [8]. In contrast to the previous analyses, these observables cannot be extracted from single angle distributions. This second LHCb analysis found a local deviation with respect to the SM prediction in one observable, P 5 , with a significance corresponding to 3.7 standard deviations. Possible interpretations of this discrepancy and the consistency of all of the measurements of b → s transitions have been widely discussed in the literature [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21].The LHCb collaboration previously determined a set of angular observables in the B 0 → K * 0 µ + µ -decay, 1 using data collected during 2011, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb -1 [1].

        <p>The present paper describes an updated angular analysis of the B 0 → K * 0 µ + µ -decay, using the LHCb Run 1 data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb -1 . The data were recorded in pp collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV during 2011 and 2012, respectively. All previous analyses of the B 0 → K * 0 µ + µ -decay have extracted only part of the information available, by fitting simplified forms of the angular distribution. This paper presents a complete set of observables for the first time, based on the full angular distribution. The simultaneous determination of these observables allows correlations between the measured quantities to be computed, enabling the use of the results in global fits to theoretical models. This is critical to understand whether SM dynamics are sufficient to explain the above discrepancy, or if extensions to the SM are necessary.The present paper describes an updated angular analysis of the B 0 → K * 0 µ + µ -decay, using the LHCb Run 1 data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb -1 .

The online event selection is performed by a trigger, which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction [30]. Simulated signal events are used to determine the impact of the detector geometry, trigger, reconstruction and candidate selection on the angular distribution of the signal. In addition, simulated samples are used to estimate the contribution of possible background processes. In the simulation, pp collisions are generated using

        <p>In order to describe the signal angular distribution, the angular acceptance discussed in section 5 must be accounted for. The acceptance is treated in one of two ways, depending on the q 2 range being fitted. In the narrow q 2 bins, the acceptance is treated as being constant across each bin and is included in the fit by multiplying eq. (2.6) by the acceptance function evaluated at the bin centre. In the wider 1.1 &lt; q 2 &lt; 6.0 GeV 2 /c 4 and 15.0 &lt; q 2 &lt; 19.0 GeV 2 /c 4 bins, the shape of the acceptance can vary significantly across the bin. In this case, the candidates are weighted in the likelihood fit by the inverse of their efficiency. The event weights are scaled such that this pseudo-likelihood fit has confidence intervals with the correct coverage.In order to describe the signal angular distribution, the angular acceptance discussed in section 5 must be accounted for.

As detailed in section 4.1, the most important backgrounds are those from Λ 0 b → pK -µ + µ -and B 0 s → φµ + µ -decays, where a kaon or proton is misidentified as pion; and B 0 → K * 0 µ + µ -decays, where the kaon and pion are both misidentified.

These decays are selected by removing PID information from the BDT and inverting the background vetoes.Systematic uncertainties are assessed for the different sources of peaking background that are neglected in the analysis. As detailed in section 4.1, the most important backgrounds are those from Λ 0 b → pK -µ + µ -and B 0 s → φµ + µ -decays, where a kaon or proton is misidentified as pion; and B 0 → K * 0 µ + µ -decays, where the kaon and pion are both misidentified. Taking the angular distribution of the background from simulated events, pseudoexperiments are generated with these backgrounds included, and the angular observables determined as if the background were not present.

For the fit to the q 2 -dependent decay amplitudes, an additional uncertainty is assigned for the choice of the q 2 parameterisation of the S-wave components. As described in section 7.3, the S-wave amplitudes are taken to be constant in q 2 . Motivated by ref. [55], a systematic variation is considered by assuming that the S-wave amplitudes A L,R S have the same q 2 dependence as the longitudinal P-wave amplitudes A L,R 0 . The measured CP asymmetries can be biased due to detection and production asymmetries. The B 0 production asymmetry is measured to be less than 1% [56,57].

This uncertainty constitutes up to 30% of the statistical uncertainty on F L and 20% of the statistical uncertainty on A FB . For S 5 and A 5 , the largest source of systematic uncertainty comes from the choice of polynomial order for the angular acceptance. If polynomials two orders higher are used, a variation of ∼ 0.01 is observed. For the remaining CP -averaged and CPasymmetric observables, the uncertainties arising from the data-simulation comparison and the acceptance are small. However, there are three other non-negligible sources of systematic uncertainty. Throughout the full q 2 range, peaking backgrounds introduce a systematic uncertainty at the level of 0.01 or less. For the likelihood fit of the angular observables, in the first two q 2 bins (where the acceptance changes most rapidly), the uncertainty arising from using the bin centre, as opposed to a bin edge, is at the level of 0.01 or less.

Previous analyses [9][10][11][12][19][20][21] have shown that the existing measurements of decays involving a b → s quark transition, including the previous LHCb P 5 result from ref. [8], can be accounted for by modifying only the real part of the vector coupling strength of the decays, conventionally denoted Re(C 9 ). An analysis considering additional effective couplings would require a global fit to all of the measurements of b → s quark transitions and is beyond the scope of this paper. Note that modifying just the axial-vector coupling strength, C 10 , would lead to a branching fraction for the B 0 s → µ + µ -decay that is excluded by existing measurements [74].
