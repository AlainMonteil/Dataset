        <p>Chiral effective field theory (χEFT) provides a systematic approach to describe low-energy nuclear forces. Moreover, χEFT is able to provide well-founded estimates of statistical and systematic uncertainties -although this unique advantage has not yet been fully exploited. We fill this gap by performing an optimization and statistical analysis of all the low-energy constants (LECs) up to next-to-next-to-leading order. Our optimization protocol corresponds to a simultaneous fit to scattering and bound-state observables in the pion-nucleon, nucleon-nucleon, and few-nucleon sectors, thereby utilizing the full model capabilities of χEFT. Finally, we study the effect on other observables by demonstrating forwarderror-propagation methods that can easily be adopted by future works. We employ mathematical optimization and implement automatic differentiation to attain efficient and machine-precise first-and second-order derivatives of the objective function with respect to the LECs. This is also vital for the regression analysis. We use power-counting arguments to estimate the systematic uncertainty that is inherent to χEFT, and we construct chiral interactions at different orders with quantified uncertainties. Statistical error propagation is compared with Monte Carlo sampling, showing that statistical errors are, in general, small compared to systematic ones. In conclusion, we find that a simultaneous fit to different sets of data is critical to (i) identify the optimal set of LECs, (ii) capture all relevant correlations, (iii) reduce the statistical uncertainty, and (iv) attain order-by-order convergence in χEFT. Furthermore, certain systematic uncertainties in the few-nucleon sector are shown to get substantially magnified in the many-body sector, in particular when varying the cutoff in the chiral potentials. The methodology and results presented in this paper open a new frontier for uncertainty quantification in ab initio nuclear theory.Chiral effective field theory (χEFT) provides a systematic approach to describe low-energy nuclear forces.

        <p>The ab initio methods for solving the many-nucleon Schrödinger equation, such as the no-core shell model (NCSM) [6] and the coupled cluster (CC) approach [7], are characterized by the use of controlled approximations.

Over the past decade, there has been significant progress in first-principles calculations of bound, resonant, and scattering states in light nuclei [6,[8][9][10][11][12] and medium-mass nuclei [7,[13][14][15][16].

        <p>We use the common term low-energy constants (LECs) to denote the effective parameters of a nuclear interaction model. Indeed, for the description of atomic nuclei, the numerical values of the LECs play a decisive role. In the χEFT approach, the LECs can, in principle, be connected to predictions from the underlying theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) (see, e.g., Ref. [19]). However, the currently viable approach to accurately describe atomic nuclei in χEFT requires that the LECs are constrained from experimental low-energy data. The bulk of this fit data traditionally consists of cross sections measured in nucleon-nucleon (NN) scattering experiments. Most often, these data are parametrized in terms of phase shifts [20,21]. However, experimental data come with error bars, which implies that a thorough statistical error analysis of the constructed nuclear Hamiltonian can only be performed when fitting directly to nuclear scattering observables. This optimization procedure gives rise to statistical uncertainties on the LECs.We use the common term low-energy constants (LECs) to denote the effective parameters of a nuclear interaction model.

        <p>In general, the determination of the LECs constitutes an extensive nonlinear optimization problem. In other words, the relatively large number of parameters makes it challenging to find optimal values such that the experimental fit data are best reproduced. Various methods and objective functions have been used to solve this problem for a wide array of available nuclear-interaction models [22][23][24][25][26][27][28]. More often than not, the parameters of the models were fitted by hand. Mathematical optimization algorithms were only recently introduced in this venture by Ekström et al. [29] and by Navarro Perez et al. [30]. First attempts to investigate the statistical constraints on the LECs of mathematically optimized interactions have recently been performed in the NN sector with coarse-grained δ-shell interactions [31][32][33][34] and with χEFT NN interactions [35,36].In general, the determination of the LECs constitutes an extensive nonlinear optimization problem.

        <p>The so-called power-counting scheme of the χEFT approach offers a systematically improvable description of NN, three-nucleon (NNN), and pion-nucleon (πN) interactions. It provides a consistent framework in which LECs from the effective πN Lagrangian also govern the strength of pion exchanges in the NN potential and of longand intermediate-range NNN forces. This implies that πN scattering data can be used to constrain some LECs that enter the chiral nuclear Hamiltonian.The so-called power-counting scheme of the χEFT approach offers a systematically improvable description of NN, three-nucleon (NNN), and pion-nucleon (πN) interactions.

Most often, the LECs that are associated with the NNN terms have been determined relative to existing NN Hamiltonians.

        <p>The extended approach that is presented here is conceptually consistent with χEFT in the sense that the NN þ NNN Hamiltonian is constrained from a simultaneous mathematical optimization to NN and πN scattering data, plus observables from NNN bound states including the electroweak process responsible for the β decay of 3 H. Furthermore, we include the truncation error of the chiral expansion to take systematic theoretical errors into account. If correctly implemented, the truncation error of an observable calculated in this scheme should decrease systematically with increasing order in the χEFT expansion. Indeed, we show that the resulting propagated uncertainties of a simultaneous fit are smaller and exhibit a more obvious convergence pattern compared to the traditional separate or sequential approaches that have been published so far.The extended approach that is presented here is conceptually consistent with χEFT in the sense that the NN þ NNN Hamiltonian is constrained from a simultaneous mathematical optimization to NN and πN scattering data, plus observables from NNN bound states including the electroweak process responsible for the β decay of 3 H.

        <p>The long-range part of the nuclear interaction in χEFT is governed by the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry of QCD and mediated by the corresponding Goldstone boson, the pion (π). This groundbreaking insight [39] enables a perturbative approach to the description of phenomena in low-energy nuclear physics [40]. High-energy physics that is not explicitly important is accounted for through a process of renormalization and regularization with an accompanying power-counting scheme. The expansion parameter is defined as Q=Λ χ , where Q is associated with the external momenta (soft scale) and Λ χ ≈ M ρ (hard scale), with M ρ ≈ 800 MeV the mass of the rho meson. The benefit of a small-parameter expansion is that higher orders contribute less than lower orders. If the series is converging, an estimate of the magnitude of the truncation error is given by the size of the remainder.The long-range part of the nuclear interaction in χEFT is governed by the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry of QCD and mediated by the corresponding Goldstone boson, the pion (π).

It is clear that the residuals are not entirely normally distributed, with a skewness of -0.38ð3Þ and excess kurtosis of 5.39 (6). The main reason</p>
        <p>for this deviation can be traced to the inclusion of a systematic error in the fit. This can produce a consistent overestimate or underestimate of observables, resulting in a nonzero skewness. A nonzero excess kurtosis indicates that the model error sometimes overestimates the uncertainty and, in other cases, underestimates it, causing a too-sharp peak near zero in the histogram in Fig. 2. We stress that the deviations from normality do not invalidate the use of χ 2 ðαÞ as an objective function to fit the parameters; it just indicates that the minimizer α ⋆ will not be a maximumlikelihood estimator. In fact, we find that when optimizing NNLOsim using NN scattering data up to 125 MeVonly, to avoid large model errors, the skewness and excess kurtosis of the NN scattering residuals are significantly reduced; -0.01ð6Þ and 0.6(1), respectively. Still, the propagated uncertainties are very similar in these two cases. Thus, the minimization and subsequent regression analysis of the χ 2 ðαÞ function will provide valuable insights into both the model and the data [79].for this deviation can be traced to the inclusion of a systematic error in the fit. This can produce a consistent overestimate or underestimate of observables, resulting in a nonzero skewness. A nonzero excess kurtosis indicates that the model error sometimes overestimates the uncertainty and, in other cases, underestimates it, causing a too-sharp peak near zero in the histogram in Fig. 2. We stress that the deviations from normality do not invalidate the use of χ 2 ðαÞ as an objective function to fit the parameters; it just indicates that the minimizer α ⋆ will not be a maximumlikelihood estimator.

        <p>The minimization of χ 2 ðαÞ, Eq. ( 17), is a nonlinear optimization problem. In this work, we have employed three different nonlinear least-squares minimization methods at different stages during the optimization: POUNDerS [83], Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), and Newton's method.

            <rs type="software">TAO</rs> package [84] and is a socalled derivative-free method. As the label indicates, it does not require the computation of any derivatives. This makes it very attractive for use with applications where differentiation is a formidable task, e.g., nuclear energy density optimization [85] and previous optimizations of chiral interactions [29,35,86]. However, in this work, we have managed to make significant progress in the optimization problem by implementing automatic differentiation, which enables us to extract machine-precise derivatives of the objective function. Consequently, the whole class of derivative-based optimization algorithms becomes readily available. The convergence rate is increased considerably with the LM method that employs first-order derivatives of the residuals with respect to the LECs. A further improvement can be achieved with Newton's method, which also uses the second-order derivatives. At LO, the presence of only two LECs to parametrize the potential makes it a trivial task to minimize the corresponding objective functions. However, already at the next order, NLO, the optimization requires quite an effort. There are 11 LECs, and in order to provide a reasonable start vector α 0 of numerical values for these, we make an initial fit to the NN scattering phase shifts published by the Nijmegen group [20]. At NNLO, there is a total of 26 LECs since we also need to include all 13πN LECs up to order ν ¼ 4. Also at this order, we carry out an initial fit to NN phase shifts before proceeding with the optimization of the complete objective function. The optimization with respect to scattering observables in the πN sector could proceed without any fits to phase shifts.

The general idea is to form appropriate linear combinations of M function evaluations in the vicinity of the point of interest.</p>
        <p>There are, however, a number of issues with this method. First, it is prone to large numerical errors since differences of large, almost equal, numbers are needed. Second, the result can be very sensitive to the choice of step size. Furthermore, it is also a computationally demanding method since the number of required function evaluations grows quickly with the number of dependent variables and order of the derivative. For instance, a third-order, finite-difference calculation of first and second derivatives with respect to all 26 LECs requires M ¼ 3653 function evaluations. For these reasons, we abandon finitedifference methods and employ instead forward-mode automatic differentiation (AD). The basic idea of AD is the following: A computer implementation for calculating the observables, or any computational algorithm for that matter, will consist of a chain of simple (or intrinsic) mathematical operations, e.g., addition and multiplication, elementary functions such as sin and exp, and matrix operations. Therefore, by repeatedly employing the chain rule, derivatives with respect to the LECs can be calculated alongside the usual function evaluations. Using AD, the derivatives of Eq. ( 21) can actually be computed to machine precision, which is far beyond the precision of any reasonable finitedifference scheme. This accomplishment is illustrated in Fig. 4, where the dependence on the step size for the finitedifference method is also shown for comparison. We implement forward-mode AD using the

Furthermore, since all LECs enter linearly in the momentum-space formulation of the chiral potential, it is very easy to calculate the derivatives of the potential with respect to the LECs.

Furthermore, we might argue that the fourth minimum (NLO-4 and NNLO-4, respectively) is the physical one since its C LECs most resemble the values obtained at LO. This is not a strong justification since LECs are allowed to vary between orders.

        <p>A much more interesting difference between the four minima occurs in the few-nucleon sector. It turns out that minima 1-3 give significant underbinding of the triton.

        <p>The appearance of NNN diagrams and subleading terms from the πN sector does not occur until NNLO in our chiral expansion. This implies small differences between the separately and simultaneously optimized interactions at lower orders. The deuteron properties are included in the optimization of LOsim and NLOsim but not in LOsep and NLOsep. We find that the statistical χ 2 values (not including the model errors) with respect to NN scattering data are almost identical for LOsim and LOsep, and so are the values of the LECs. The small value of σ expþmethod for the deuteron binding energy constrains the statistical error for C3 S 1 in LOsim correspondingly. For the contact potential at NLO, there are three LECs that operate in the deuteron channel, more than in any other NN partial wave. The presence of mutual correlations cannot be neglected. This explains why the individual statistical errors for the LECs in NLOsim and NLOsep in this channel are similar and larger than at LO. The covariances will also impact the value for the forward error in the deuteron binding energy, discussed further in Sec.

At the same time, the χ 2 for np scattering and πN scattering are similar for the two potentials. Measured np scattering cross sections are characterized by larger uncertainties, and it is therefore not surprising that these data remain well described. However, it is noteworthy that the NNLOsim potential reaches a better description of the NN data while maintaining a description of the πN data that is comparable to the one of NNLOsep. Keep in mind that NNLOsep is separately optimized to the πN scattering data.

        <p>Statistical errors and covariances between computed observables are calculated under the assumption that each observable depends quadratically on the LECs in the vicinity of the minimum [see Eq. ( 34)]. Our estimate of the statistical uncertainty, σ A , of an observable O A rests on this assumption, which also explains why we have asymmetric error bars. We have performed extensive Monte Carlo samplings to verify the validity and necessity of using the second-order approximation. A linear truncation is more common. In particular, we compare the probability density function for various observables obtained from (i) Monte Carlo samplings of the multivariate Gaussian spanned by the covariance matrix, (ii) the quadratic approximation, and (iii) the linear approximation of Eq. ( 34). The Monte Carlo calculations use obtained in the Monte Carlo calculations with the NNLOsim potential are small and well reproduced already by the corresponding linear approximation, as expected. With NNLOsep, the errors are much larger and require at least a quadratic approximation for the forward error. The uncertainties of the ERE parameters differ quite a lot between these two potentials. It is important to remember that for the NNLOsim potential, all LECs are constrained by πN, NN, as well as NNN data. Hence, in the error analysis, the LECs that fulfill χ 2 scaled ðpÞ ≈ N dof will provide a reasonable description of most scattering data.

        <p>It is possible to explore correlations between any pair of observables by looking at joint probability distributions. As an example, we plot the statistical distribution of binding energies of 4 He and corresponding radii of the deuteron for the NNLO potentials in Fig. 8. The contour lines indicate the regions that encompass 68% (1σ) and 95% (2σ) of the probability density. It is remarkable that the quadratic approximation (dashed lines) reproduces even the fine details of the full calculation (solid lines) for the NNLOsim interaction. Again, the magnitude of variations is strikingly large for NNLOsep, but the quadratic approximation does rather well in reproducing them. In particular, we see a large improvement when going from a linear (dotted lines) to a quadratic dependence on the LECs. This even captures the departure from the standard first-order ellipse.It is possible to explore correlations between any pair of observables by looking at joint probability distributions.

The statistical uncertainty of the binding energy in 4 He grew with a factor ∼90 compared with the fully informed model.

        <p>Overall, the importance of applying simultaneous optimization is most prominent at higher chiral orders since the subleading πN LECs enter first at NNLO. In fact, the separately optimized NNLOsep potential contains a large systematic uncertainty by construction. We find that the scaling factor for the NN scattering model error, C NN , decreases from 1.6 to 1.0 mb 1=2 when going from NNLOsep to the simultaneously optimized NNLOsim. This implies that the separate, or sequential, optimization protocol introduces additional artificial systematic errors not due to the chiral expansion but due to incorrectly fitted LECs. This scenario is avoided in a simultaneous optimization. The scaling factor for the πN scattering model error, C πN , remains at 3.6 mb 1=2 for both NNLOsep and NNLOsim.Overall, the importance of applying simultaneous optimization is most prominent at higher chiral orders since the subleading πN LECs enter first at NNLO.

        <p>The size of the model error is determined such that the overall scattering χ 2 =N dof is unity, which means that it depends on the observables entering the optimization. We can explore the stability of our approach by reoptimizing NNLOsim with respect to different truncations of the input NN scattering data. To this end, we adjust the allowed T max lab between 125 and 290 MeV in six steps. It turns out that our procedure for extracting the model error is very stable. The resulting normalization constants C NN vary between 1.0 mb 1=2 and 1.3 mb 1=2 as shown in Fig. 10(a). To see the corresponding effect on predicted observables, we consider the np total cross section at laboratory scattering energy T lab ¼ 300 MeV. The model errors vary between 4.8 mb and 6.1 mb, and the calculated cross sections vary between 36.5 mb and 42.7 mb [see Fig. 10(b)]. The measured value is 34.563(174) mb [21,97]. We note that the size of the estimated model error is comparable with the variation in the predictions due to changing T max lab .

        <p>In nuclear physics, the theoretical uncertainties very often dominate over the experimental ones. In particular, this is true for the systematic error. Therefore, it is crucial to establish a credible program for assessing the error budget of any prediction or analysis of experimental information. Thus, we focus our attention on the convergence and missing physics in χEFT. In particular, we discuss consequences for predictions of bound-state observables in heavier nuclei such as 4 He and 16 O. It would be valuable to estimate the systematic uncertainty of predicted boundstate observables-due to the momentum-dependent χEFT uncertainty σ model in Eq. (20). However, the explicit momentum dependence is integrated over when solving the nonrelativistic Schrödinger equation. Thus, a clear connection to the momentum expansion is lost.In nuclear physics, the theoretical uncertainties very often dominate over the experimental ones. In particular, this is true for the systematic error. Therefore, it is crucial to establish a credible program for assessing the error budget of any prediction or analysis of experimental information. Thus, we focus our attention on the convergence and missing physics in χEFT. In particular, we discuss consequences for predictions of bound-state observables in heavier nuclei such as 4 He and 16 O. It would be valuable to estimate the systematic uncertainty of predicted boundstate observables-due to the momentum-dependent χEFT uncertainty σ model in Eq. (20). However, the explicit momentum dependence is integrated over when solving the nonrelativistic Schrödinger equation. Thus, a clear connection to the momentum expansion is lost.</p>
        <p>As demonstrated already in Fig. 10, the variations in model predictions obtained from different truncations of the input data (including only NN scattering data with T lab ≤ T max lab ) are a good first approximation of the expected model uncertainty. To get a more complete picture of the systematic uncertainty, we now also vary the regulator cutoff parameter Λ in the range 450-600 MeV in steps of 25 MeV. For each combination of T max lab and Λ, we perform a simultaneous optimization of the LECs, which results in a family of 42 NNLO interactions-i.e., 42 sets of LECs that each comes with statistical uncertainties. It is clear from Table V that the statistical uncertainties of the LECs are smaller than the overall shifts induced by varying T max Lab and the cutoff Λ. All sets of LECs at LO, NLO, and NNLO that were obtained in this work are listed in Ref. [92]. Furthermore, each set is accompanied by its own covariance matrix, also available for download. In the following discussion, we use this family of potentials to estimate the systematic uncertainty.As demonstrated already in Fig. 10, the variations in model predictions obtained from different truncations of the input data (including only NN scattering data with T lab ≤ T max lab ) are a good first approximation of the expected model uncertainty.

        <p>First, we would like to emphasize that all sets of simultaneously optimized LECs provide an almost equally good description of all A ≤ 4 data. Some of the πN LECs display large variations, but the χ 2 =N dof (without model error) for the πN data is within 2.28(4) for all of these potentials. The subleading πN LECs become more positive when NN scattering data at higher energies are included, and c 1 , in particular, carries a larger (relative) statistical uncertainty than the others. It is noteworthy that for a given T max Lab , and up to 1σ precision, the πN LECs exhibit Λ independence. The NNN LECs, c D and c E , tend to depend less on T max Lab at larger values of Λ. However, they always remain natural. It is also interesting to note that the tensor contact C E 1 is insensitive to Λ variations but strongly dependent on the T max Lab cut. It was shown in Fig. 6 that C E 1 and c 4 correlate strongly. This effect can already be expected from the structure of the underlying expression for the NNLO interaction.First, we would like to emphasize that all sets of simultaneously optimized LECs provide an almost equally good description of all A ≤ 4 data.

        <p>To gauge the magnitude of model variations in heavier nuclei, we computed the binding energies of 4 He and 16 O by using the previously mentioned family of 42 NNLO potentials. The resulting binding energies for 4 He and 16 O, computed in the NCSM and CC, respectively, are shown in Fig. 11. The NCSM calculations were carried out in a HO model space with N max ¼ 20 and ℏω ¼ 36 MeV. The CC calculations were carried out in the so-called Λ-CCSD(T) approximation [7] in 15 major oscillator shells with ℏω ¼ 22 MeV. The largest energy difference when going from 13 to 15 oscillator shells was 3.6 MeV (observed for Λ ¼ 600 MeV). From the observed convergence of the correlation energy we estimate the uncertainty of excluded higher rank excitation clusters to AE5 MeV. For our purposes, this provides well-enough converged results. The NNN force was truncated at the normal-ordered two-body level in the Hartree-Fock basis.To gauge the magnitude of model variations in heavier nuclei, we computed the binding energies of 4 He and 16 O by using the previously mentioned family of 42 NNLO potentials.

        <p>The Eð 4 HeÞ predictions vary within about a 2-MeV range. For Eð 16 OÞ, this variation increases dramatically to about 35 MeV. Irrespective of the discrepancy with the measured value, the spread of the central values indicates the presence of a surprisingly large systematic error when extrapolating to heavier systems.The Eð 4 HeÞ predictions vary within about a 2-MeV range.

        <p>The statistical uncertainties remain small: tens of keV for 4 He and a few hundred keV for 16 O. These uncertainties are obtained from the quadratic approximation with the computed Jacobian and Hessian for 4 He, while a brute-force Monte Carlo simulation with 2.5 × 10 4 CC calculations was performed for 16 O. This massive set of CC calculations employed the singles and doubles approximation (CCSD) in nine major oscillator shells. We conclude that the statistical uncertainties of the predictions for Eð 4 HeÞ and Eð 16 OÞ at NNLO are much smaller than the variations due to changing Λ or T max Lab . However, this is only true for simultaneously optimized potentials. For the separately optimized NNLO potential (NNLOsep), the statistical uncertainty of the Eð 4 HeÞ prediction is five times larger than the observed variations due to changing Λ and T max Lab .The statistical uncertainties remain small: tens of keV for 4 He and a few hundred keV for 16 O.

        <p>The extended analysis of systematic uncertainties presented above suggests that large fluctuations are induced in heavier nuclei (see Fig. 11). Furthermore, while predictions for 4 He are accurate over a rather wide range of regulator parameters, the binding energy for 16 O turns out to be underestimated for the entire range used in this study. In fact, there is no overlap between the theoretical predictions and the experimental results, even though the former ones have large error bars.The extended analysis of systematic uncertainties presented above suggests that large fluctuations are induced in heavier nuclei (see Fig. 11).

        <p>(1) Explore the alternative strategy of informing the model about low-energy many-body observables. (2) Diversify and extend the statistical analysis and perform a sensitivity analysis of input data. (3) Continue efforts towards higher orders of the chiral expansion, and possibly revisit the power counting. Let us comment briefly on these research directions. The poor many-body scaling observed in Fig. 11 was pragmatically accounted for in the construction of the so-called NNLO sat potential presented in Ref.

        <p>Second, to get a handle on possible bias in the statistical analysis due to the choice of statistical technique, it is important to apply different types of optimization and uncertainty quantification methods. Various choices exist, such as, e.g., Lagrange multiplier analysis [99], Bayesian methods [100], or Gaussian process modeling [101,102]. In general, stochastic modeling with Monte Carlo simulations offers a straightforward and versatile approach. This tool is also indispensable for computing the posterior probabilities in Bayesian inference. The Monte Carlo results for A ≤ 4 observables that were presented in this work consist of 10 5 sampling points over a multivariate Gaussian parameter space. With our current implementation, the computational cost for sampling all A ≤ 4 observables presented in this work is very low-less than 8000 CPU hours. As such, the present work also shows great promise for future stochastic applications.Second, to get a handle on possible bias in the statistical analysis due to the choice of statistical technique, it is important to apply different types of optimization and uncertainty quantification methods.
