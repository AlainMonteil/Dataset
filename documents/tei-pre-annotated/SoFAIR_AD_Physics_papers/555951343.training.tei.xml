        <p>Chile. Owing to the broad wavelength range (1.43 -2.42 µm over 54 spectral orders), high spectral resolution (R∼45,000), and sensitivity (SNR∼180-270/resolution-element), IGRINS on GS is particularly sensitive to the molecular lines from multiple carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur bearing species (see Methods). Seventy-nine separate spectra (140 s/spectrum) were obtained during the pre-eclipse portion (Fig. 1a) of the orbit when the hottest planetary hemisphere is present, covering a phase (φ) range between 0.32 and 0.47 (where φ=0 is transit and 0.5 is occultation/secondary eclipse). The IGRINS Pipeline Package 10 is used for the basic data reduction, spectral extraction, and initial wavelength calibrations, with additional reduction steps described in the Methods. When observing from the ground, it is necessary to remove the contaminating effects of Earth's atmosphere. Leveraging the rapidly changing Doppler shift of the planetary lines (∼140 km s -1 over the observing window) compared to the relatively stationary telluric (0 km s -1 ) and stellar lines (∼0.2 km s -1 ), a principle component analysis (PCA, see methods) can be used to identify and remove the dominant time dependent contaminating sources 11 , leaving the planetary signal largely unscathed.Chile.

        <p>Removal of the telluric contamination also removes any continuum level information in the planet-to-star flux ratio 7 . In order to extract meaningful information from data processed in this way 12,13 , we must first cross-correlate (CC) the data with model templates. Using a set of representative thermal emission models that include the dominant absorbers expected at these temperatures and over the IGRINS wavelength range (primarily, H2O and CO), we cross-correlate as a function of velocity against each processed spectrum. Provided the model is an adequate template, the CC function (CCF) for each spectrum reaches its maximum at the planetary velocity (a sum of the system velocity and orbital velocity) at that specific orbital phase, and hence, trace out a CC trail in velocity 14 . The CC trail is clearly visible in Fig. 1b, corresponding to the appropriate planetary velocity components, demonstrating that we are detecting the planetary atmosphere as the planet orbits the star. We further leverage the circular orbital geometry, which predicts the phase-dependent line-of-sight Doppler shift given the planetary orbital (Kp) and relative system velocities (∆Vsys), to determine the total atmospheric signal detection by summing over the CCF at each phase 12,13 (see Methods). Fig. 1c shows the total atmospheric thermal emission crosscorrelation signal-to-noise, peaking at an S/N=12.8 very near (offset by ∼-7 km s -1 ∆Vsys, see Methods) the anticipated pair of velocities, clearly indicating a strong detection of atmospheric thermal emission. The next step is to identify the specific trace molecular species (the bulk atmosphere is predominately H2/He) present in the spectrum and retrieve their absolute abundances. To do this we perform an automated procedure via a Bayesian inference (retrieval) scheme 7 (see Methods). This approach simultaneously optimizes the volume mixing ratios for each trace species (log10(ni), i=H2O, CO, CH4, H2S, NH3, and HCN as well as a CO isotopic abundance ratio-see Methods), the vertical temperature structure, the planetary orbital and system velocities, and nuisance parameters to account for uncertainties in the reported transit timing and possible signal stretching due the PCA analysis (see Methods). This method accounts for all of the degeneracies that arise amongst the the multiple overlapping molecular lines and absorption strength with atmospheric temperature gradient and permits for absolute molecular abundance determinations 5,7 .Removal of the telluric contamination also removes any continuum level information in the planet-to-star flux ratio 7 .

        <p>We achieve bounded constraints for log10(nH2O) and log10(nCO) (Fig. 2a) and only upper limits for the other species (see Methods), consistent with atmospheric chemical composition predictions under typical (∼solar elemental composition, thermochemical equilibrium) assumptions 15 (Fig. 1c). We are also able to retrieve a bounded constraint on the CO isotopic abundance ratio (see Methods for a discussion). These data prefer a monotonically decreasing relatively cool temperature profile (Fig. 2d), suggestive of an atmosphere that either has a fairly efficient day-to-night atmospheric circulation (the predicted day-side temperature for poor circulation planets should follow the hotter inverted predicted profile in Fig. 2d) or lacks high altitude UV/optical absorbers (e.g., metal hydrides and oxides), possibly indicative of night-side condensation (cold-trapping) of refractory species 16 .We achieve bounded constraints for log10(nH2O) and log10(nCO) (Fig. 2a) and only upper limits for the other species (see Methods), consistent with atmospheric chemical composition predictions under typical (∼solar elemental composition, thermochemical equilibrium) assumptions 15 (Fig. 1c).

        <p>The intrinsic elemental abundances in a planetary atmosphere are illuminating quantities because they are diagnostic of both atmospheric chemical processes and formation conditions. Furthermore, C and O account for ∼70% 17 of the total "metals" (e.g., any species heavier than H, He) in a typical solar-like composition gas, and are hence, good tracers for the metal enrichment of an atmosphere. Since H2O and CO are the dominant C and O bearing molecules in this atmosphere (with relatively low abundance upper limits on the other major C and O bearing molecules-see Methods), are expected to be largely unperturbed by disequilibrium chemistry mechanisms at these temperatures 15 , and are expected to be homogeneous with altitude over the pressures probed by typical observations 15 (Fig. 2c), we can convert them directly into the elemental oxygen (nO = nCO+nH2O) and carbon (nC = nCO) abundances. It is customary to normalize the elemental abundances relative to hydrogen (ni/nH), relative to that in the sun ([X/H]:=log10((nX/nH)/(nX/nH)sun)) 18 to facilitate comparisons with other astrophysical bodies in a common abundance reference frame. We find the elemental abundances in the atmosphere of WASP-77Ab to be [C/H]=-0.46 +0.17 -0.16, [O/H]=-0.49 +0.14 -0.12, [(C+O)/H]=-0.48 +0.15 -0.13, and a ratio of carbon to oxygen, C/O=0.59±0.08 (the Solar value is 0.55) (Fig. 2b) (all error bars reflect the 68% confidence interval). We also retrieve a subterrestrial 12 C/ 13 C abundance ratio (10.2-42.6 at 68% confidence, terrestrial value is 89), but see methods for a discussion and interpretation of the CO isotopic abundance constraint. Fig. 3a summarizes the [C/H] and [O/H] compared to the solar system giant planets. With these abundance measurements we find that the C and O abundances are both sub-solar/stellar (WASP-77A has been measured to have a solar [Fe/H], 8 ) by 2.7 and 3.5σ, respectively, and fall below the solar system values, suggestive of different conditions for WASP-77Ab's atmosphere formation than for our own solar system giants.The intrinsic elemental abundances in a planetary atmosphere are illuminating quantities because they are diagnostic of both atmospheric chemical processes and formation conditions.

        <p>When and where a planet forms within the protoplanetary disk, the relative role of solid versus gas accretion, and chemical processing ultimately dictate the observed atmospheric compositions, resulting in numerous potential outcomes for the elemental enrichment and abundance ratios. From the plethora of planet formation models, a few broad predictions have emerged for Jovian planet (M&gt;0.3MJ) atmosphere compositions 2 : (i) Formation beyond the major ice lines (H2O, CO, CO2) and subsequent inwards migration after disk dissipation leads to elevated (&gt; 0.8) C/O and relatively low metal enrichment 18,19,20 , (ii) Formation and migration within a disk results in substantial oxygen rich planetesimal pollution, resulting in low (&lt; 0.5) C/O, and elevated metal enrichment, with [X/H] decreasing with increasing planet mass 1,19 , and (iii) Pebble accretion and drift 20,21 can result in both high C/O and super-solar metallicities.When and where a planet forms within the protoplanetary disk, the relative role of solid versus gas accretion, and chemical processing ultimately dictate the observed atmospheric compositions, resulting in numerous potential outcomes for the elemental enrichment and abundance ratios.

        <p>It is with the sheer numbers of exoplanets that we can quantitatively test specific formationto-atmosphere hypotheses. By combining our abundance measurements with the solar system C abundances and H2O-based O abundances from low resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations 4 we can glean some insight into the diversity of planet formation outcomes (Fig. 3b). The Solar system carbon abundances (black diamonds) follow a decreasing trend (dotted line) with increasing planet mass 22 . The low resolution HST-based oxygen abundances 4 show virtually no trend with mass but span ∼0.03-300×Solar enrichments, though the constraints are rather coarse (typically ∼order- of-magnitude abundance precisions 4 , compared to the factor of 1.5 obtained in this work) for most objects. The WASP-77Ab C and O abundances both fall below the solar/stellar composition line and below the trend line predicted by the solar system, along with a few other O-based hot Jupiter abundances. These relatively low overall enrichments and ∼solar C/O are not consistent with the above broad predictions-e.g., ∼solar C/O but low metal enrichment. Instead, a possible formation scenario consistent with the measured abundances could be that the planetary core accreted its atmosphere interior to the major ice lines with O rich but C depleted gas (possibly due to sequestration into refractory grains), a relative lack of planetesimal bombardment,which would deliver both C and O, post atmosphere accretion, and little to no dissolution of the core metals into the atmosphere (Fig. 3b).It is with the sheer numbers of exoplanets that we can quantitatively test specific formationto-atmosphere hypotheses.

        <p>The challenge in connecting giant planet atmosphere compositions to their formation conditions is formidable. Over the past decades the planetary science community has made substantial progress on this front, starting with carbon and nitrogen abundances in the solar system planets, to order-of-magnitude oxygen abundance constraints in hot Jupiter atmospheres, a stringent upper limit on the Jovian oxygen abundance from JUNO 23 , to now the first precision carbon and oxygen abundance measurements in exoplanets, advancing theory with each new measurement paradigm. Improvement in our understanding of how atmospheres came to be and how they evolve will continue as we push towards higher precision abundance measurements of more targets and for more elements from both ground (dozens of planets are accessible with the level of precision presented here with current instruments)and space-based platforms (e.g., The James Webb Space Telescope), ultimately paving the way for understanding our own Solar system's formation history in the galactic context.The challenge in connecting giant planet atmosphere compositions to their formation conditions is formidable.

        <p>The IGRINS Pipeline Package (PLP) 10,27 is used to reduce, optimally extract the spectra, and perform wavelength calibrations. A further wavelength calibration fine adjustment is made by applying a linear stretch re-alignment of each spectrum with the spectrum at the end of the sequence. This ensures self-consistent alignment to enable more robust telluric detrending. Finally, due to heavy telluric contamination (median atmospheric transmittance &lt;0.7) we discard 11/54 orders near the edges of the H and K bands.The IGRINS Pipeline Package (PLP) 10,27 is used to reduce, optimally extract the spectra, and perform wavelength calibrations.

For HRCCS specific retrievals, we must also include the planet Keplerian and system velocities (∆Kp and ∆Vsys relative to the literature 8 reported values of 192±11 and 1.6845±0.0004 km s -1 , respectively).

An isothermal slab would produce a similar spectral effect (a blackbody produced at P 3 ) as an opaque gray cloud-top pressure. If there were such a cloud present at higher altitudes, we would have retrieved a lower value of P3 than the current upper limit of ∼0.4 (ED Figure 3, log10(P3) panel).

        <p>The model planet spectrum is convolved with both a planetary rotational (vsin(i)=4.52 km/s) and an instrumental broadening (assumed to be Gaussian) kernel followed by an interpolation (using the python 
            <rs type="software">scipy</rs>.interpolate.splrep
            <rs type="software">/splev</rs> functions (3 rd order) to the data wavelength grid (accounting for the appropriate Doppler shift), and finally divided by a stellar model (either a PHOENIX model or a blackbody) and scaled by the planet-to-star area ratio 8 . Bayesian inference and model selection are performed using 
            <rs type="software">pymultinest</rs> 44,45 to evaluate the log-likelihood function 7 . The likelihood evaluation steps are the same as described in ref. 7 except that we use the PCA instead of the airmass detrending method. To do so, we save the Ncomp discarded eigenvectors from the SVD to reconstruct the telluric/systematic data matrix followed by a multiplicative injection of the model (Doppler shifted matrix of 1+(Fp/Fstar)(λ,φ)). The PCA/SVD is then re-applied to the model injected data for each order. This model-injected matrix is then cross-correlated and corresponding log-likelihood evaluated and summed over each individual spectrum in each order against the true data matrix for each model/parameter instance. A typical retrieval under this set-up (17 parameters, 500 live points) runs in about 3 days (∼270K likelihood evaluations) if utilizing 24 CPUs (for paralleling-pythons' joblib package-the model-injected data PCA computation for each order) and a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU for the radiative transfer. We note that we could have chosen other CCF-to-log-likelihood mappings such as those described in Ref. 46 and Ref. 47 . These mappings make different assumptions regarding the properties of the noise. Generally, however, in the presence of high signal to noise, resolution, and broad wavelength coverage observations, like those obtained with IGRINS, these assumptions are unlikely to have a strong impact on the retrieved parameter constraints (e.g, as shown in Refs. 7,47 ).

        <p>There is a non-negligible offset (∼1.5σ, see dVsys histogram in ED Fig. 3) in the relative system velocity. Such offsets are not uncommon 6,50,51 and can arise for a variety of reasons including uncertainties in the propagated mid-point timing during the event (e.g., the propagated eclipse midpoint uncertainty is ∼260s which would correspond to a ∼2.7 km/s velocity uncertainty at the observed orbital phases), a small previously unnoticed eccentricity, or perhaps, more intriguingly a combination of rotation (∼4.5 km/s) which might preferentially blue shift a dayside hot spot and/or longitudinal temperature advection (west-to-east winds, ∼2 km/s 52 ). Whatever the source of the velocity offset, it is inconsequential for the chemical and thermal profile constraints as it is non-degenerate with those atmospheric parameters.There is a non-negligible offset (∼1.5σ, see dVsys histogram in ED Fig. 3) in the relative system velocity.

        <p>Elemental Abundance Determinations &amp; Interpretation The chemical plausibility, dominance of CO and H2O, and uniformity with pressure/altitude permits us to directly compute the C and O enrichments and carbon-to-oxygen ratio (main text Fig. 1b). The total C abundance is given by CO/H, O by (H2O+CO)/H, and H by 2H2 (where H2=0.837the equilibrium chemistry value at WASP-77Ab temperatures). Solar abundances from 17 (C/H=2.95×10 -4 , O/H =5.37×10 -4 , C/O=0.55) are used when referencing the "relative to solar values" (e.g., main text Fig. 3) with "[]" referring to the log10 relative to solar.

It is worth noting, however, that the reported JUNO value for O (based upon H2O via the microwave radiometer equatorial measurements), while seemingly greater than the Galileo Probe "hot spot" measurement, is technically not a bounded constraint, rather more of an upper limit (see Fig. 5b in Ref. 23 ) cannot rule out zero abundance alone. 23 Comparatively, with a single observation, our measurements provide bounded constraints on both C and O at sub-solar/stellar values.The C and O abundances for WASP-77Ab are interpreted through the lens of the solar system abundance determinations, the representative exoplanet population abundances as measured with low spectral resolution platforms (e.g., HST), and theoretical models in main text Fig. 3.

If all abundances scaled proportionally to the total envelope metallicity, and the population synthesis predictions from Ref. 63 and Ref. 1 were true, we would expect exoplanet atmosphere metal enrichment's to loosely follow the solar system trend line (dotted). There is clearly no trend with the H2O based O measurements in 4 (see also 63,64 ), though the uncertainties are quite large. This could be suggestive that perhaps O is "depleted" (e.g., via high C/O), though without a C measurement for each planet this cannot be confirmed.

        <p>Ref. 26 provide predictive models for the maximum metal enrichment (based upon O) for the exoplanet population given their measured mass and radius for a "core-less" planet, e.g., the metals and gas are well mixed throughout the entire planet. This is clearly extreme as these values (blue dots, main text Fig. 3b) vastly overshoot the measured Jupiter and Saturn envelope enrichment's, suggesting a large fraction of metals must be sequestered into a solid core (on the order of 90%). To match the retrieved depletion for WASP-77Ab, approximately 99% of the accreted metals must be in the planetary core (assuming the observed atmospheric composition is representative of the entire envelope). One cannot tell the formation story with a single planet as the vast complexities between the composition of accreted gas and the partitioning of metals/solids within the core are not yet cleanly predictable. A larger survey of planets with precisions obtained here could shed light on this seemingly insurmountable problem.Ref. 26 provide predictive models for the maximum metal enrichment (based upon O) for the exoplanet population given their measured mass and radius for a "core-less" planet, e.g., the metals and gas are well mixed throughout the entire planet.

        <p>The second test gauges the impact of spatial heterogeneity's in temperature 52,67 . If the planet had strong spatially varying temperatures, like a dominating hot spot, we would expect to retrieve different temperatures between the first half and the second half of the observing sequence as the heterogeneities rotate into/out of view. To test this, we broke the observing sequence in half (compared to the full sequence) as if each were its own separate observation, each having 40 (39) frames/spectra per sequence. The entire PCA analysis/retrieval procedure above was then applied to each half-sequence. For computational reasons we used the faster 3-parameter analytic TP-profile prescription from Refs. 65,66 (since this choice did not matter in the first test). These results are shown ("3D Temperature Effects") in the middle histogram row and middle TP-profile panel of ED Fig. 5. Again, this had little influence other than increasing the uncertainties on the abundances and TP-profile due to the reduced data set size per half-sequence. This suggests that a "1D" atmosphere/retrieval is sufficient in this case and does not result in any measurable bias.The second test gauges the impact of spatial heterogeneity's in temperature 52,67 .

        <p>Finally, in ED Fig. 6, bottom panel, we compare the WASP-77Ab 13 C/ 12 C constraint (via CO) to common solar system bodies and various reference values. It is currently beyond the scope of this manuscript to speculate as to why WASP-77Ab has a notably lower ratio than (enhanced 13 C) compared to solar system, suffice it to say that protoplanetary disk chemistry models can produce a broad range of 13 C/ 12 C in CO as a function of mid-plane height and radial distance from the star 69 . We purposefully choose not to strongly emphasize isotopic abundance constraint result in the main-text as more work needs to be done within the community to determine how to reliably quantify isotopic measurements-e.g., what is a detection?-this is non-trivial for these types of observations 71 . Future observations are needed both for this planet and for others in order to determine the commonality of such constraints. ED Fig. 7: Carbon isotopic abundance analysis. The top row of histograms compares the constraints from a nominal simplified retrieval model applied to the the true data (red) and an the reverse-injected data re-injected with 13 C isotope removed model (black). The upper limit on the simulated data and bounded constraint arising from the true dataset suggests that there is indeed isotopic information in these IGRINS data. The bottom panel compares the retrieved 12 C to 13 C ratio (red) to common solar system bodies (blue, after Ref. 73 ) and various reference values (galactic interstellar medium (ISM) components, and Earth (terrestrial), black dashed lines). WASP-77Ab sits anomalously low (enhanced 13 C) compared to most solar system objects.Finally, in ED Fig. 6, bottom panel, we compare the WASP-77Ab 13 C/ 12 C constraint (via CO) to common solar system bodies and various reference values.

        <p>Code Availability The IGRINS PLP used to perform the initial reduction and extraction by the instrument team is available at 
            <rs type="url">https://github.com/igrins/plp</rs>. The barycenter correction and planetary phase calculations were made using the python 
            <rs type="software">astropy</rs> library found here 
            <rs type="url">https://www.astropy.org/</rs>. Python 
            <rs type="software">Numpy</rs> specific tools are noted in the text (e.g., the SVD for the PCA). The chemical abundance analysis/physical plausibility assessment made use of the 
            <rs type="software">VULCAN</rs> chemical kinetics tool (
            <rs type="url">https://github.com/exoclime/VULCAN)</rs>. Absorption cross-sections were generated using the 
            <rs type="software">HELIOS-K</rs> tool (
            <rs type="url">https://helios-k.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)</rs>. Finally, we make available a an end-to-end python2/GPU HRCCS (25, 5). Stationary tellurics show up as vertical dark streaks. Wavelength dependent gradient is due to the echelle blaze throughput. The PCA/SVD method can remove these stationary features, leaving behind the planetary signal buried in the noise (bottom row). We use these "Post-PCA" frames for the subsequent crosscorrelation/retrieval analysis (repeated for all 43 use orders).

        <p>ED Fig. 4: Classic cross-correlation analysis data products. The model template used to in this cross-correlation analysis is the spectrum resulting from the maximum likelihood solution found by the retrieval analysis. The left column illustrates the gas detection's (all gases, H2O, CO, and other-NH3+H2S+HCN+CH4) in the standard Kp-Vsys plane, with a slice in Vsys along the literature reported Kp at the bottom. The detection maps are constructed by subtracting the mean total CC, then dividing by an "off peak" (a boxed region in the lower left corner of each panel) CC standard deviation. Using this method, only H2O is strongly detected, with a hint of CO present at the expected velocities. The right column reproduces analogous products using the log-likelihood formalism 7 (∆logL relative to the minimum), resulting in a stronger presence of CO. We emphasize, that while such maps may be instructive for "detecting" species or "atmosphere", they do not marginalize over all of the degeneracy, nor do they maximize the information content in the data. This is why in our analysis, we focus on the the results arising from the more comprehensive log-likelihood/retrieval formalism.ED Fig. 4: Classic cross-correlation analysis data products.

The top row of histograms and first TPprofile histogram demonstrate the lack of impact of TP-profile parameterization. The middle panel of histograms and middle TP-profile panel show that there is little impact due to any presence of temperature heterogeneities on the hemisphere(s) observed during the sequence. Finally, the bottom panel of histograms and last TP-profile panel illustrate the lack of impact of various data analysis and other minor modeling assumptions. In short, the retrieved abundances and temperature profile constraints are largely resilient against most common assumptions.ED Fig. 5: Robustness test analyses summary using the H2O, CO, and temperature profile constraints as the metrics for assumption impact.
