        <p>In 1972-1973 Wilson and Cowan introduced a mathematical model of the population dynamics of synaptically coupled excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the neocortex. The model dealt only with the mean numbers of activated and quiescent excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and said nothing about fluctuations and correlations of such activity. However, in 1997 Ohira and Cowan, and then in 2007-2009 Buice and Cowan introduced Markov models of such activity that included fluctuation and correlation effects. Here we show how both models can be used to provide a quantitative account of the population dynamics of neocortical activity.In 1972-1973 Wilson and Cowan introduced a mathematical model of the population dynamics of synaptically coupled excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the neocortex.

        <p>We first describe how the Markov models account for many recent measurements of the resting or spontaneous activity of the neocortex. In particular we show that the power spectrum of large-scale neocortical activity has a Brownian motion baseline, and that the statistical structure of the random bursts of spiking activity found near the resting state indicates that such a state can be represented as a percolation process on a random graph, called directed percolation.We first describe how the Markov models account for many recent measurements of the resting or spontaneous activity of the neocortex.

        <p>The analysis of large-scale brain activity is a difficult problem. There are about 50 billion neurons in the cortex of the human brain: 80 % are excitatory, whereas the remaining 20 % are inhibitory. Each neuron has about seven thousand axon terminals from other neurons, but there is some redundancy in the connectivity so that it has effective connections from about 80 other neurons, mostly nearest neighbors. Each neuron is actually a complex switching device, but in this review, we introduce only the simplest cellular model, that neurons are binary switches, either quiescent or activated. It follows that there are approximately 10 1.5×10 10 configurations of activated or quiescent neurons. Such a large configuration space suggests the need to use statistical methods to analyze large-scale brain activity. In addition there is some degree of microscopic randomness in neural connectivity, and there are also random fluctuations of neural activity, both of which also support the need for a statistical treatment, as noted by Sholl in 1956 [1].The analysis of large-scale brain activity is a difficult problem.

        <p>There is a large body of data on large-scale brain activity, including electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings with large electrodes from the surface of the scalp, functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) measurements of blood flow in different brain regions (also large-scale), local field potentials (LFP) recorded with smaller electrodes, microelectrode recordings from or near individual neurons, or (currently) microelectrode arrays which can record the simultaneous activity of many neighboring neurons. Currently there are also new techniques for forming optical images of local brain activity, using voltage sensitive dyes (VSD). All such recordings can be classified as either spontaneous or resting activity, or stimulus-driven evoked activity.There is a large body of data on large-scale brain activity, including electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings with large electrodes from the surface of the scalp, functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) measurements of blood flow in different brain regions (also large-scale), local field potentials (LFP) recorded with smaller electrodes, microelectrode recordings from or near individual neurons, or (currently) microelectrode arrays which can record the simultaneous activity of many neighboring neurons.

        <p>We first consider the resting brain activity of unanesthetized animals first observed in animals by Caton in 1875 [2], and in humans by Berger in 1924 [3].

The voltage differences measured between such electrode pairs are about 50 µV.

        <p>It will be seen that there are intermittent bursts of 10 Hz oscillations in the scalp activity. These oscillations comprise the alpha rhythm, seen in awake relaxed humans, mainly in the occipital region of the brain which processes visual signals from the eyes. Figure 2 shows the power spectrum of such activity. It will be seen that there is a pronounced peak in the power spectrum at around 10 Hz and a secondary peak around 20 Hz. This peak is said to be in the range of the beta rhythm of occipital EEG activity. Interestingly if the contributions of such peaks are eliminated, what is left can be fitted with the function a/(b + f 2 ), where a and b are constants, and f is the frequency in Hz. Figure 3 shows such a function and its fit to the EEG power spectrum. It is important to note that this power spectrum fit is that of Brownian motion, which suggests that resting brain activity is largely desynchronized and random.It will be seen that there are intermittent bursts of 10 Hz oscillations in the scalp activity.

        <p>But the most detailed studies, and the most information about the nature of spontaneous activity, has been obtained from studies of isolated neocortical slabs. The first detailed studies were carried out in the early 1950s by DeLisle Burns, on isolated slabs of parietal neocortex [7,8]. The main relevant result was that very lightly anesthetized slabs spontaneously generated bursts of propagating activity from a number of randomly occurring sites. Any variation of the level of anesthesia, either up or down, abolished the activity. Fig. 5 Electrode data from slices of rat neocortex. The top graph is a raster plot of electrode activation times. They seem synchronous, but closer examination reveals that the times exhibit self-similarity. The bottom graphs show a sequence of electrode activations in the original array. [Reproduced from [9]] However, it was not until 2003 that a systematic study of such burst activity was carried out by Beggs and Plenz [9] using isolated slabs of rat somatosensory cortex, either in mature tissue cultures, or else in slices. The tissue cultures exhibited spontaneous bursts of propagating activity in the form of local field potentials recorded at microelectrodes. The slices, however, were silent until stimulated with NMDA, a glutamate-receptor agonist, in combination with a dopamine D 1 -receptor agonist. In contrast to DeLisle Burns, Beggs and Plenz used an 8 × 8 microelectrode array to record local field potentials (LFPs) in the slab. The main result of their experiments is summarized in Figs. 5 and6.But the most detailed studies, and the most information about the nature of spontaneous activity, has been obtained from studies of isolated neocortical slabs.

        <p>Beggs and Plenz's conclusion is that such bursts of activity are avalanches defined as follows: the configuration of active electrodes in the array during one time bin of width t is termed a frame, and a sequence of frames preceded and followed by blank frames is called an avalanche. However, successive frames are not highly correlated, so the activity is not wave-like: it is in fact self-similar, and in addition, the avalanche size distribution follows the power law P [n] ∝ n α . In addition the exponent α is approximately -1.5. This is the mean-field exponent of a critical branching process [10]. This result was a step beyond that of Softky and Koch [11] who found Poissonlike spiking activity in individual cortical neurons, and introduced the possibility of criticality in brain dynamics. In fact this mean-field exponent turns up in several kinds of percolation processes on random graphs, including both isotropic and directed percolation. But branching and annihilating random walks are equivalent to directed [Reproduced from [9]] percolation, so it is possible that what Beggs and Plenz observed in cortical slices was a form of directed percolation. We will return to this topic later.Beggs and Plenz's conclusion is that such bursts of activity are avalanches defined as follows: the configuration of active electrodes in the array during one time bin of width t is termed a frame, and a sequence of frames preceded and followed by blank frames is called an avalanche.

        <p>In case there is an external stimulus, neocortical dynamics indicates a very different picture. It turns out that there is a big difference in the responses to weak stimuli, compared to those triggered by stronger stimuli. In addition correlations between pairs of neurons in driven neocortex have a shorter length scale than those found in spontaneous activity.In case there is an external stimulus, neocortical dynamics indicates a very different picture.

        <p>The basic result for weak stimuli is that the cortical response is a propagating wave whose amplitude decays exponentially with distance. Figure 7 shows the cortical responses to low amplitude stimuli in the form of spikes, recorded by an implanted microelectrode array in three monkey visual cortices by Nauhaus et al. [13]. Each row shows data from the spike-triggered local field potentials (LFP) from a single location. The first column shows the dependence of time to peak of the LFP as a function of the cortical distance from the triggering electrode, and estimated propagation velocities. The second column shows the propagating wave, both as a pseudo-colored image, and as a plot of wave amplitude vs. distance from the triggering electrode, together with estimates of the space-constants of the decaying waves. The third column shows average LFP waveforms at three locations from the triggering spike.The basic result for weak stimuli is that the cortical response is a propagating wave whose amplitude decays exponentially with distance.

        <p>It will be seen that the response is indeed a traveling LFP, whose velocity is about 25-30 cm/s.

        <p>In contrast the basic result for strong stimuli is that cortical responses to such stimuli are much more localized. Figure 8 shows a comparison of cortical responses to weak and strong stimuli [13]. It will be seen that responses to larger stimuli remain essentially localized.

        <p>Following early work by Shimbel and Rapaport [20], Beurle [21] focused, not on the activity of single neurons, but on the proportion of neurons activated per unit time in a given volume element of a slice or slab of neocortex, denoted by n(x, t). For all practical purposes this can be taken to be equivalent to the spike-triggered LFP and VSD described earlier.Following early work by Shimbel and Rapaport [20], Beurle [21] focused, not on the activity of single neurons, but on the proportion of neurons activated per unit time in a given volume element of a slice or slab of neocortex, denoted by n(x, t).

        <p>The left panel of Fig. 11 shows the detailed structure around such bifurcations. Evidently the saddle-node and Andronov-Hopf bifurcations lie near the Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. Thus all the bifurcations described in the spatially homogeneous Wilson-Cowan equations lie close to such a bifurcation in the (a, b)-plane. The Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation depends on two control parameters a and b, and is therefore of codimension 2. In such a bifurcation an equilibrium point can simultaneously become a marginally stable saddle and an Andronov-Hopf point. So at the bifurcation point the eigenvalues of its stability matrix have zero real parts. In addition the right panel of Fig. 11 shows how the fast E-nullcline and the slow I-nullcline intersect.

        <p>To develop such equations we need to reformulate neural population dynamics as a Markov process. We first consider the representation of the dynamics of a cortical sheet or slab comprising a single spatially homogeneous network of N excitatory binary neurons. Such neurons transition from a quiescent state q to an activated state a at the rate f and back again to the quiescent state q at the rate α, as shown in Fig. 12.To develop such equations we need to reformulate neural population dynamics as a Markov process.

In DP there are two stable states, separated by a marginally stable critical point.

The other is one in which many neurons are activated, so that n = 0 in the activated state. At a critical point the quiescent state becomes marginally stable and is driven by fluctuations into the activated state.The basic result is that the stochastic equivalent of the Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation is the critical point of a Directed Percolation phase transition, or DP [47].

        <p>It is evident that there are big differences between the effects produced by weak and strong stimuli. What is the cause of such differences? Given that the only parameter in the Wilson-Cowan equations that is varied in the two cases is the stimulus intensity, this suggests that the property which causes the different responses is the level of inhibition. It must therefore be the case that the threshold for inhibitory activity is set high enough that weak stimuli do not trigger inhibitory effects, whereas strong enough stimuli do trigger such effects. Indeed this is one of the possibilities suggested by Carandini et al. in their papers. Thus inhibition blocks LFP (and VSD) propagation.It is evident that there are big differences between the effects produced by weak and strong stimuli. What is the cause of such differences?

Early workers, including Shimbel and Rapaport [20] and Beurle [21], appreciated the need to use a statistical formulation of such dynamics, but lacked the techniques to go beyond mean-field theory. The Wilson-Cowan equations [24,27] were the first major attempt at a statistical theory, but still lacked a treatment of second and higher moments. However, what the equations did describe was mathematical conditions for attractor dynamics. Further work by Ermentrout and Cowan [29][30][31] and by Borisyuk and Kirillov [32], and Hoppenstaedt and Izhikevich [33,34] used the mathematical techniques of bifurcation theory to more fully analysis such dynamics. The main result was that neural population dynamics is organized around a Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation point, in the neighborhood of which (in a phase space of two control parameters) are saddle-node and Andronov-Hopf bifurcations. Thus neural network dynamics contains locally stable equilibria in the form of stationary and oscillatory attractors.The main results described in this article concern the use of the Wilson-Cowan equations to analyze the dynamics of large populations of interconnected neurons.

        <p>The problem of going beyond the mean-field regime proved to be very difficult. Some progress was made by Ohira and Cowan [37] formulating stochastic neural dynamics in the neighborhood of a stable stationary equilibrium as a random Markov process and using the Van Kampen system-size expansion [36]. Further process along these lines was made by Benayoun et al. [35] who formulated Eq. ( 7) as a random Markov process. But Benayoun et al. went further, by incorporating some symmetries into Eq. ( 7) discovered by Murphy and Miller [39] which, in retrospect, located the stationary equilibrium of the equations near a Bogdanov-Takens point. The result was that the stochastic version of Eq. ( 7) generates the random bursts of activity we now refer to as avalanches. In addition the avalanche distribution was that of a power law, with a slope exponent β = 1.6. This value is close to that observed by Beggs and Plenz [9] in their observations of neural activity in an isolated cortical slab, of avalanche distributions with a slope exponent of β = 1.5.The problem of going beyond the mean-field regime proved to be very difficult.

        <p>There remained the problem of developing a statistical theory for the fluctuations about a marginally stable critical point, such as a Bogdanov-Takens point. This problem was formulated by Cowan [42] and solved by Buice and Cowan [43,44]. This is a major result since it connects the theory of stochastic neural populations at a critical point, with many well studied examples of other populations of interconnected units. Examples include percolation in random graphs, branching and annihilating random walks, catalytic reactions, interacting particles, contact processes, nuclear physics, and bacterial colonies. Many of these processes are subject to a phase transition, known as a directed percolation phase transition (DP). and all these processes have the same statistical properties, including the appearance of random bursts or avalanches.There remained the problem of developing a statistical theory for the fluctuations about a marginally stable critical point, such as a Bogdanov-Takens point.

        <p>However, although the statistical theory is relevant to the pair-correlation problem, it is the mean-field Wilson-Cowan equations that proved to be necessary and sufficient to analyze neocortical responses to brief stimuli, both weak and strong. In our opinion the close fit between the data and the simulations of the Wilson-Cowan equations with fixed parameters is quite remarkable, especially given the fact that these equations were formulated some 45 to 50 years ago! More detailed papers dealing with these and other results on neocortical responses to stimuli are in preparation.However, although the statistical theory is relevant to the pair-correlation problem, it is the mean-field Wilson-Cowan equations that proved to be necessary and sufficient to analyze neocortical responses to brief stimuli, both weak and strong.
