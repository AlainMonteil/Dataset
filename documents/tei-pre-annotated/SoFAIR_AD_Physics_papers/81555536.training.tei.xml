        <p>We present a dark sector model based on gauging the L µ -L τ symmetry that addresses anomalies in b → sµ + µ -decays and that features a particle dark matter candidate. The dark matter particle candidate is a vector-like Dirac fermion coupled to the Z gauge boson of the L µ -L τ symmetry. We compute the dark matter thermal relic density, its pair-annihilation cross section, and the loop-suppressed dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section, and compare our predictions with current and future experimental results. We demonstrate that after taking into account bounds from B s meson oscillations, dark matter direct detection, and the CMB, the model is highly predictive: B physics anomalies and a viable particle dark matter candidate, with a mass of ∼ (5 -23) GeV, can be accommodated only in a tightly-constrained region of parameter space, with sharp predictions for future experimental tests. The viable region of parameter space expands if the dark matter is allowed to have L µ -L τ charges that are smaller than those of the SM leptons.We present a dark sector model based on gauging the L µ -L τ symmetry that addresses anomalies in b → sµ + µ -decays and that features a particle dark matter candidate.

        <p>The presence of non-baryonic dark matter in the universe has been ascertained from a variety of observations corresponding to different time scales in the history of the universe. All such observations hinge, however, exclusively on gravitational effects associated with the dark matter, and no striking evidence for non-gravitational manifestations of dark matter is known to date. A broad experimental program is presently in place, aimed at discovering such non-gravitational effects with collider searches and with direct and indirect dark matter detection.The presence of non-baryonic dark matter in the universe has been ascertained from a variety of observations corresponding to different time scales in the history of the universe.

        <p>Collider searches for dark matter typically rely on so-called mono-X searches, i.e. missing energy plus some visible final state (see [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13] for the latest analyses); such searches have the advantage of being sensitive to low dark matter masses, as opposed to e.g. current direct detection experiments which loose sensitivity for small masses below a few GeV. In addition to the usual mono-X studies, colliders might also give important information on the mediator that connects the dark and visible sector, for example in the case of vector mediators, as we will describe in more detail below.Collider searches for dark matter typically rely on so-called mono-X searches, i.e. missing energy plus some visible final state (see [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13] for the latest analyses); such searches have the advantage of being sensitive to low dark matter masses, as opposed to e.g. current direct detection experiments which loose sensitivity for small masses below a few GeV.

        <p>Specifically, we build on the model presented in refs. [14,15], which is based on gauging L µ -L τ , the difference of leptonic muon number and tau number [16][17][18]. The model of [14,15] was proposed to explain an anomaly in the rare B → K µ + µ -decay JHEP12(2016)106 mode observed by the LHCb collaboration in 2013 [19]. 1 The B → K µ + µ -anomaly persists in the latest experimental data [36,37], and is supported by measurements of the B s → φµ + µ - [38] decay and by the hint for lepton flavor universality violation in B + → K + + - [39]. Interestingly enough, the model in [14,15] necessarily predicts lepton flavor universality violation and is in excellent agreement with the latest model independent NP fits that take into account all relevant experimental data on rare B decays [40][41][42][43].Specifically, we build on the model presented in refs.

        <p>Beyond being able to explain the hints for lepton flavor universality violation in rare B decays, gauged L µ -L τ has a number of additional virtues. It has been considered as a solution to the anomaly in the g -2 of the muon, and is used in models for neutrino masses. Unbroken L µ -L τ predicts one degenerate neutrino pair and a maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing angle, which is a good starting point for model building.Beyond being able to explain the hints for lepton flavor universality violation in rare B decays, gauged L µ -L τ has a number of additional virtues.

        <p>Extra matter could be charged under the L µ -L τ gauge symmetry. Here, we consider a minimal dark sector composed by the Z gauge boson associated to the L µ -L τ symmetry and by a vector-like Dirac fermion that is a dark matter candidate, and which we assume to be charged under the new local L µ -L τ symmetry. We investigate whether both the rare B decay anomalies and dark matter can be simultaneously accounted for, considering all relevant phenomenological constraints. The dark matter phenomenology is dictated by gauge interactions mediated by the massive new Z gauge boson. The mass of the Z can be generated either through a Stueckelberg mechanism, thereby leaving the L µ -L τ symmetry unbroken [44,45], or by a spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism with the introduction of a scalar field, as described in ref. [14]. We will assume that the scalar field, if it exists, is either sufficiently heavy to be integrated out and inessential to the phenomenology of the model, or that is has sufficiently suppressed interactions with SM particles, again leading to no observable consequences. In what follows we remain agnostic about the mechanism by which the Z gauge boson acquires mass, and we outline the region of parameter space which accommodates both dark matter and the rare B decay anomalies.Extra matter could be charged under the L µ -L τ gauge symmetry.

        <p>Notice that the construction under consideration here is primarily motivated by the notion of minimality in addressing both dark matter and B physics anomalies. As a result, while a full underlying model might reveal a connection between the ingredients of the model (e.g. the vector-like dark matter particle and the vector-like quarks that generate the effective couplings between the Z and the Standard Model quarks), none is postulated here. The construction of a complete model, including connections among neutrino masses, dark matter and vector-like quarks goes beyond the scope of this work.Notice that the construction under consideration here is primarily motivated by the notion of minimality in addressing both dark matter and B physics anomalies.

        <p>Previous work has explored dark matter in models based on the L µ -L τ symmetry. Early studies of dark matter charged under L µ -L τ were motivated by the PAMELA positron fraction excess and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon [46][47][48] and the galactic center excess [49]. Extended L µ -L τ setups have also been explored, containing right-handed neutrinos and additional light scalars [50] or additional gauge bosons [51]. More studies of L µ -L τ models with extended fermion and scalar sectors have been performed in [52,53]. A complementary study of the interplay of B physics anomalies and Dark Matter in models with gauged Baryon number can be found in [54].Previous work has explored dark matter in models based on the L µ -L τ symmetry.

The region of di-muon invariant mass squared that is most relevant for the rare B decay anomalies is 1 GeV 2 &lt; q 2 &lt; 6 GeV 2 . For m Z 10 GeV, corrections are therefore at the few percent level at most.</p>

Indeed, integrating out the Z does not only lead to contributions to the b → sµ + µ -decays.

We find the following modification of the B s -Bs mixing amplitude M 12 = -1.07 [41], as favored by the anomalies in B meson decays, we obtain the following upper bound on the Z mass m Z &lt; 4.9 TeV × q g × -1.07Any explanation of the B decay anomalies based on Z bosons is subject to additional constraints from B s meson oscillations.

        <p>In this section we discuss the phenomenology of the dark matter in our model. It is important to first notice that the Z gauge boson arising from the L µ -L τ local symmetry dictates a dark matter phenomenology rather different from other realizations of a "dark Z portal" (see e.g. [67][68][69][70][71][72][73][74][75][76][77][78][79][80][81][82][83][84]). For example, the dark matter pair annihilation exclusively yields muon, tau, and neutrino pairs, as well as Z boson pairs, if kinematically allowed (i.e. if m χ &gt; m Z ). We show the schematic relevant Feynman diagrams in figure 1. This feature affects both the relic density and the indirect detection properties of the model. Secondly, scattering off of nuclei (direct detection) occurs only via loop induced dark matter-nucleon interactions (see figure 2). Most of the previous results obtained in the literature are therefore not directly applicable here.In this section we discuss the phenomenology of the dark matter in our model.

        <p>In the early universe, the dark matter particle was in thermal equilibrium with SM particles through the interactions shown in figure 1. As the universe expanded and cooled down, the expansion rate eventually became equal to the interaction rate, leading to the freeze-out of the dark matter particles, and to a relic dark matter population. Since in our model the interactions of the dark matter particles with SM particles are dictated by s-channel (velocity-independent) processes, away from the m χ m Z /2 resonance, the abundance is directly tied to the annihilation times relative velocity of the annihilating DM particles today.

        <p>Several probes exist of the late-time, low relative-velocity dark matter pair-annihilation cross section, generically known as "indirect dark matter detection". The characteristic feature of the model under consideration is the production of abundant hard leptons, as illustrated by the annihilation diagrams shown in figure 1. As such, one possible constraint stems from cosmic-ray and gamma-ray data. In particular, the AMS-02 measurement of the cosmic ray positron fraction can be used to set constraints on dark matter annihilating to leptons [90][91][92][93][94]. Dark matter below ∼ 100 GeV annihilating into muons is in principle subject to such constraints. However, utilizing charged cosmic rays to set constraints on dark matter annihilation inevitably involves significant uncertainties from propagation and energy losses in the Galaxy, and and, in the case of light dark matter, m χ 15 GeV, also from solar modulation. Though gamma-rays offer a promising search channel for dark matter annihilation, in the case of leptonic interactions, they are not the best probe. A more model-independent and robust way to probe the pair-annihilation rate is to use the effects of energy injection from dark matter annihilation on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Specifically, dark matter annihilation at redshifts z ∼ 1000 results in energy injection which heats and ionizes the photon-baryon plasma, significantly perturbing the ionization history in a way that can be constrained by measurements of the CMB temperature and polarization angular power spectra [95]. In our model, where the SM annihilation final states largely involve charged leptons, a sizable fraction, and in some case almost all of the energy is deposited in energetic electrons and positrons, the species with the highest effective deposited power fraction f eff [95].Several probes exist of the late-time, low relative-velocity dark matter pair-annihilation cross section, generically known as "indirect dark matter detection".

        <p>In figure 3 we show results for m χ = 5, 10 GeV and charge q χ = 1. For m χ = 5 GeV, current and projected direct detection limits (green curves on the top left of the plots) are weak due to the experimental energy threshold. The correct relic abundance can be achieved close to the resonance region, without being excluded by the constraints from the neutrino trident production. The CMB limit probes a sizable part of parameter space that yields the right abundance. Forecasted CMB data constrain the model a bit further. In the m χ = 5 GeV case we are left with a small region of parameter space with a Z mass of m Z 10 GeV and a L µ -L τ gauge coupling of g ∼ 10 -3 -10 -2 . For m χ = 10 GeV, only the projected CMB sensitivity applies. Direct detection limits from LUX and projected limits from XENON1T probe substantial parts of the parameter space of the model where one can accommodate both the LHCb anomaly and the relic density. Notice that CMB limits weaken at the resonance because, at the resonance, sufficiently small couplings can still reproduce the right abundance, however such small coupling lead to small annihilation cross sections today. This trend can be seen for m χ = (5 -15) GeV (see the upper panel of figure 4 for the latter case).In figure 3 we show results for m χ = 5, 10 GeV and charge q χ = 1.

        <p>Figure 4 focuses on dark matter masses m χ = 15, 50, 100 GeV. Notice that direct detection limits (green curves on the top left of the plots) are significantly stronger than in the 5 GeV case, becoming most relevant for a 50 GeV dark matter mass; XENON1T projected sensitivity can entirely probe the LHCb favored region for m χ = 15 GeV. The entire favored parameter space for m χ = 50 GeV and for m χ = 100 GeV is already excluded by current LUX bounds combined with B s mixing. We find that the current LUX bounds leaves viable parameter space only for m χ 23 GeV.Figure 4 focuses on dark matter masses m χ = 15, 50, 100 GeV.

        <p>In summary, in the regime with q l q χ , the dark matter mass window of m χ (5 -23) GeV is favored. For smaller dark matter masses the Z required to accommodate the right relic abundance is too light to explain the B decay anomalies. For larger dark matter masses direct detection and B s mixing exclude the entire favored parameter space. Upcoming XENON1T data might significantly test the model, leaving only masses around m χ (5 -10) GeV open. The latter can be later probed with further improvements from B s mixing constraints, and the LZ direct detection experiment [115].In summary, in the regime with q l q χ , the dark matter mass window of m χ (5 -23) GeV is favored.

        <p>These conclusions change if we depart from the assumption that q l q χ . In figure 5 we show the results for q χ = 1/6, keeping q l = 1. The indirect detection limits are essentially the same since the smaller q χ the larger the gauge coupling needed to obtain the right relic abundance, yielding no impact in the overall annihilation cross section needed to get the relic density. On the order hand, direct detection limits are weaker ameliorating the scenario specially for heavy masses. Indeed, for the examples m χ = 500 GeV and 1 TeV, one can see viable regions of parameter space in the center and bottom panels of figure 5 that are able to simultaneously accommodate dark matter and the LHCb anomaly.These conclusions change if we depart from the assumption that q l q χ .

        <p>Our final figure 6 provides an orthogonal view of the parameter space in the (m χ , g ) plane, with the mass of the Z set to m Z = g × 4500 GeV which is inside the LHCb favored region for both choices of q χ : q χ = 1 (upper panel) and q χ = 1/6 (lower panel). In this regime, CMB limits do not touch the relic density curves (green) but do probe the funnel region with larger annihilation cross sections. In the figures we show these limits in dark blue. For q χ = 1/6, the funnel region is rather narrow and for this reason the CMB projected limit is simply a line. The vertical red lines show contours of constant spin-independent dark matter-nucleon cross section σ SI . Notice that since σ SI ∝ g 4 /m 4 Z and the ratio g /m Z is kept fixed in the figure, the cross section only depends on the dark matter mass through the reduced mass, µ N (see eq. (5.8)). Having in mind that current LUX limit excludes σ SI 4 × 10 -9 pb for m χ = 10 GeV and σ SI 2.5 × 10 -10 pb for m χ = 100 GeV, we conclude that only light dark matter can circumvent all existing constraints and accommodate the B decay anomalies if q χ = 1, q = 1 (upper panel of figure 6). For the Z mass of m Z = g × 4500 GeV we find the bound m χ 22.9 GeV as indicated by the dashed vertical line in the plot.Our final figure 6 provides an orthogonal view of the parameter space in the (m χ , g ) plane, with the mass of the Z set to m Z = g × 4500 GeV which is inside the LHCb favored region for both choices of q χ : q χ = 1 (upper panel) and q χ = 1/6 (lower panel).

        <p>In the bottom panel, we set q χ = 1/6, q = 1, weakening direct detection limits. In this case, the entire parameter space is consistent with the data and can address the B decay anomalies.In the bottom panel, we set q χ = 1/6, q = 1, weakening direct detection limits.

        <p>In this paper we proposed a new physics setup with dark matter charged under a L µ -L τ gauge symmetry. Specifically, we studied if one could address at the same time anomalies observed in rare B meson decays by the LHCb collaboration and have a viable thermal dark matter candidate. Our model hinges upon the (automatically anomaly-free) L µ -L τ local gauge symmetry, U(1) µ-τ , with a new corresponding massive gauge boson Z . Dark matter is a vector-like Dirac fermion charged under the L µ -L τ symmetry and neutral under the SM gauge symmetries. This setup leads to an unusual and novel dark matter phenomenology, which we described in detail.In this paper we proposed a new physics setup with dark matter charged under a L µ -L τ gauge symmetry.

        <p>The dark matter relic abundance is mainly set by annihilation into muon, tau, and neutrino pairs, through s-channel Z exchange. We studied indirect detection limits stemming from distortions of the CMB power spectrum, and direct detection using current LUX2016 and XENON1T projected sensitivities. Despite the fact that dark matter nucleus scattering is loop-suppressed, we found that direct detection experiments do put remarkably strong constraints on the model parameter space. The correct relic abundance can only be obtained close to the resonance region m Z 2m χ . Combining the direct detection constraints with constraints from B s meson oscillations leaves only a restricted window of parameter space where both B decay anomalies and the correct relic abundance can be explained: the dark matter mass is 5 GeV m χ 23 GeV; the Z mass is m Z 2m χ ; the gauge coupling is in the range 2 × 10 -3 g 10 -2 . Substantial parts of this parameter space can be probed by the expected sensitivities of future direct detection experiments like XENON1T and LZ.The dark matter relic abundance is mainly set by annihilation into muon, tau, and neutrino pairs, through s-channel Z exchange.

        <p>The viable parameter space can be extended significantly by allowing the dark matter to have L µ -L τ charges that are smaller than the charges of the SM leptons. In this case direct detection constraints are weakened, and their upper bound on the dark matter mass disappears. A correct relic abundance still requires a Z mass that is close to the resonance region. Prospects for probing such a scenario with future direct detection experiments are excellent.The viable parameter space can be extended significantly by allowing the dark matter to have L µ -L τ charges that are smaller than the charges of the SM leptons.

        <p>Strictly speaking, in order to explain the B decay anomalies, the Z boson has to couple to SM quarks.In[14] this is achieved through dimension-six effective operators or through heavy vector-like quarks, which mix with SM ones, inducing a small flavor violating Z bs coupling. While a flavor-violating coupling cannot lead to any appreciable contribution to the direct detection cross section, it might be accompanied by flavor diagonal couplings to quarks. The size of the flavor diagonal couplings is model dependent and we will not consider their effects here.Strictly speaking, in order to explain the B decay anomalies, the Z boson has to couple to SM quarks.In[14] this is achieved through dimension-six effective operators or through heavy vector-like quarks, which mix with SM ones, inducing a small flavor violating Z bs coupling.
