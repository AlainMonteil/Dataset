        <p>A search is presented for a high-mass Higgs boson in the H → Z Z → + -+ -, H → Z Z → +ν ν, H → Z Z → + -q q, and H → Z Z → ν νq q decay modes using the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The search uses proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb -1 . The results of the search are interpreted in the scenario of a heavy Higgs boson with a width that is small compared with the experimental mass resolution. The Higgs boson mass range considered extends up to 1 TeV for all four decay modes and down to as low as 140 GeV, depending on the decay mode. No significant excess of events over the Standard Model prediction is found. A simultaneous fit to the four decay modes yields upper limits on the production cross-section of a heavy Higgs boson times the branching ratio to Z boson pairs. 95 % confidence level upper limits range from 0.53 pb at m H = 195 GeV to 0.008 pb at m H = 950 GeV for the gluon-fusion production mode and from 0.31 pb at m H = 195 GeV to 0.009 pb at m H = 950 GeV for the vector-boson-fusion production mode. The results are also interpreted in the context of Type-I and Type-II two-Higgs-doublet models.A search is presented for a high-mass Higgs boson in the H → Z Z → + -+ -, H → Z Z → +ν ν, H → Z Z → + -q q, and H → Z Z → ν νq q decay modes using the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.

        <p>In 2012, a Higgs boson h with a mass of 125 GeV was discovered by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the LHC [1,2]. One of the most important remaining questions is whether the newly discovered particle is part of an extended scalar sector as postulated by various extensions to the Standard Model (SM) such as the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) [3] and the electroweak-singlet (EWS) model [4]. These predict additional Higgs bosons, motivating searches at masses other than 125 GeV.In 2012, a Higgs boson h with a mass of 125 GeV was discovered by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the LHC [1,2].

        <p>This paper reports four separate searches with the ATLAS detector for a heavy neutral scalar H decaying into two SM Z bosons, encompassing the decay modes Z Z → + -+ -, Z Z → + -ν ν, Z Z → + -q q, and Z Z → ν νq q, where stands for either an electron or a muon. These modes are referred to, respectively, as , νν, qq, and ννqq. It is assumed that additional Higgs bosons would be produced predominantly via the gluon fusion (ggF) and vectorboson fusion (VBF) processes but that the ratio of the two production mechanisms is unknown in the absence of a specific model. For this reason, results are interpreted separately for ggF and VBF production modes. For Higgs boson masses below 200 GeV, associated production (VH, where V stands for either a W or a Z boson) is important as well. In this mass range, only the decay mode is considered. Due to its excellent mass resolution and high signal-to-background ratio, the decay mode is well-suited for a search for a narrow resonance in the range 140 &lt; m H &lt; 500 GeV; thus, this search covers the m H range down to 140 GeV. The search includes channels sensitive to VH production as well as to the VBF and ggF production modes. The qq and νν searches, covering m H ranges down to 200 and 240 GeV respectively, consider ggF and VBF channels only. The ννqq search covers the m H range down to 400 GeV and does not distinguish between ggF and VBF production. Due to their higher branching ratios, the qq, νν, and ννqq decay modes dominate at higher masses, and contribute to the overall sensitivity of the combined result. The m H range for all four searches extends up to 1000 GeV.This paper reports four separate searches with the ATLAS detector for a heavy neutral scalar H decaying into two SM Z bosons, encompassing the decay modes Z Z → + -+ -, Z Z → + -ν ν, Z Z → + -q q, and Z Z → ν νq q, where stands for either an electron or a muon.

        <p>The ggF production mode for the search is further divided into four channels based on lepton flavour, while the νν search includes four channels, corresponding to two lepton flavours for each of the ggF and VBF production modes. For the qq and ννqq searches, the ggF production modes are divided into two subchannels each based on the number of b-tagged jets in the event. For Higgs boson masses above 700 GeV, jets from Z boson decay are boosted and tend to be reconstructed as a single jet; the ggF qq search includes an additional channel sensitive to such final states.The ggF production mode for the search is further divided into four channels based on lepton flavour, while the νν search includes four channels, corresponding to two lepton flavours for each of the ggF and VBF production modes.

        <p>For each channel, a discriminating variable sensitive to m H is identified and used in a likelihood fit. The and qq searches use the invariant mass of the four-fermion system as the final discriminant, while the νν and ννqq searches use a transverse mass distribution. Distributions of these discriminants for each channel are combined in a simultaneous likelihood fit which estimates the rate of heavy Higgs boson production and simultaneously the nuisance parameters corresponding to systematic uncertainties. Additional distribu-tions from background-dominated control regions also enter the fit in order to constrain nuisance parameters. Unless otherwise stated, all figures show shapes and normalizations determined from this fit.

        <p>The ATLAS collaboration has published results of searches for a Standard Model Higgs boson decaying in the , qq, and νν modes with 4.7-4.8 fb -1 of data collected at √ s = 7 TeV [5][6][7]. A heavy Higgs boson with the width and branching fractions predicted by the SM was excluded at the 95 % confidence level in the ranges 182 &lt; m H &lt; 233 GeV, 256 &lt; m H &lt; 265 GeV, and 268 &lt; m H &lt; 415 GeV by the mode; in the ranges 300 &lt; m H &lt; 322 GeV and 353 &lt; m H &lt; 410 GeV by the qq mode; and in the range 319 &lt; m H &lt; 558 GeV by the νν mode. The searches in this paper use a data set of 20.3 fb -1 of pp collision data collected at a centre-ofmass energy of √ s = 8 TeV. Besides using a larger data set at a higher centre-of-mass energy, these searches improve on the earlier results by adding selections sensitive to VBF production for the , qq, and νν decay modes and by further optimizing the event selection and other aspects of the analysis. In addition, the ννqq decay mode has been added; finally, results of searches in all four decay modes are used in a combined search. The CMS Collaboration has also recently published a search for a heavy Higgs boson with SM width in H → Z Z decays [8]. Since the searches reported here use a narrow width for each Higgs boson mass hypothesis instead of the larger width corresponding to a SM Higgs boson, a direct comparison against earlier ATLAS results and the latest CMS results is not possible.The ATLAS collaboration has published results of searches for a Standard Model Higgs boson decaying in the , qq, and νν modes with 4.7-4.8 fb -1 of data collected at √ s = 7 TeV [5][6][7].

        <p>ATLAS is a multi-purpose detector [9] which provides nearly full solid-angle coverage around the interaction point. 1 It consists of a tracking system (inner detector or ID) surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid providing a 2 T magnetic field, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer (MS). The ID consists of pixel and silicon microstrip detectors covering the pseudorapidity region |η| &lt; 2.5, surrounded by a transition radiation tracker (TRT), which improves electron identification in the region |η| &lt; 2.0. The sampling calorimeters cover the region |η| &lt; 4.9. The forward region (3.2 &lt; |η| &lt; 4.9) is instrumented with a liquid-argon (LAr) calorimeter for electromagnetic and hadronic measurements. In the central region, a high-granularity lead/LAr electromagnetic calorimeter covers |η| &lt; 3.2. Hadron calorimetry is based on either steel absorbers with scintillator tiles (|η| &lt; 1.7) or copper absorbers in LAr (1.5 &lt; |η| &lt; 3.2). The MS consists of three large superconducting toroids arranged with an eight-fold azimuthal coil symmetry around the calorimeters, and a system of three layers of precision gas chambers providing tracking coverage in the range |η| &lt; 2.7, while dedicated chambers allow triggering on muons in the region |η| &lt; 2.4. The ATLAS trigger system [10] consists of three levels; the first (L1) is a hardware-based system, while the second and third levels are software-based systems.ATLAS is a multi-purpose detector [9] which provides nearly full solid-angle coverage around the interaction point. 1 It consists of a tracking system (inner detector or ID) surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid providing a 2 T magnetic field, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer (MS).

        <p>Collision events are recorded only if they are selected by the online trigger system. For the ννqq search this selection requires that the magnitude E miss T of the missing transverse momentum vector (see Sect. 4) is above 80 GeV. Searches with leptonic final states use a combination of single-lepton and dilepton triggers in order to maximize acceptance. The main single-lepton triggers have a minimum p T (muons) or E T (electrons) threshold of 24 GeV and require that the leptons are isolated. They are complemented with triggers with higher thresholds (60 GeV for electrons and 36 GeV for muons) and no isolation requirement in order to increase acceptance at high p T and E T . The dilepton triggers require two same-flavour leptons with a threshold of 12 GeV for Footnote 1 continued IP towards the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r ,φ) are used in the transverse plane, φ being the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle θ as η =ln tan(θ/2).

        <p>Besides model-independent results, a search in the context of a CP-conserving 2HDM [3] is also presented. This model has five physical Higgs bosons after electroweak symmetry breaking: two CP-even, h and H ; one CP-odd, A; and two charged, H ± . The model considered here has seven free parameters: the Higgs boson masses (m h , m H , m A , m H ± ), the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two doublets (tan β), the mixing angle between the CP-even Higgs bosons (α), and the potential parameter m 2 12 that mixes the two Higgs doublets. The two Higgs doublets 1 and 2 can couple to leptons and up-and down-type quarks in several ways. In the Type-I model, 2 couples to all quarks and leptons, whereas for Type-II, 1 couples to down-type quarks and leptons and 2 couples to up-type quarks. The 'lepton-specific' model is similar to Type-I except for the fact that the leptons couple to 1 , instead of 2 ; the 'flipped' model is similar to Type-II except that the leptons couple to 2 , instead of 1 . In all these models, the coupling of the H boson to vector bosons is proportional to cos(β -α). In the limit cos(β -α) → 0 the light CP-even Higgs boson, h, is indistinguishable from a SM Higgs boson with the same mass. In the context of H → Z Z decays there is no direct coupling of the Higgs boson to leptons, and so only the Type-I and -II interpretations are presented.Besides model-independent results, a search in the context of a CP-conserving 2HDM [3] is also presented.

In addition, the off-shell contribution from the light Higgs boson and its interference with the non-resonant Z Z background vary over the 2HDM parameter space as the light Higgs boson couplings are modified from their SM values.

        <p>Sherpa 1.4.1 [24] includes the effects of heavy-quark masses in its modelling of the production of W and Z bosons along with additional jets (V + jets). For this reason it is used to model these backgrounds in the hadronic qq and ννqq searches, which are subdivided based on whether the Z boson decays into b-quarks or light-flavour quarks. The Alpgen 2.14 W + jets and Z /γ * + jets samples are generated with up to five hard partons and with the partons matched to final-state particle jets [25,26]. They are used to describe these backgrounds in the other decay modes and also in the VBF channel of the qq search2 since the additional partons in the matrix element give a better description of the VBF topology.

For this reason it is used to model these backgrounds in the hadronic qq and ννqq searches, which are subdivided based on whether the Z boson decays into b-quarks or light-flavour quarks.

        <p>Jets containing b-hadrons (b-jets) can be discriminated from other jets ('tagged') based on the relatively long lifetime of b-hadrons. Several methods are used to tag jets originating from the fragmentation of a b-quark, including looking for tracks with a large impact parameter with respect to the primary event vertex, looking for a secondary decay vertex, and reconstructing a b-hadron → c hadron decay chain. For the qq and ννqq searches, this information is combined into a single neural-network discriminant ('MV1c'). This is a continuous variable that is larger for jets that are more like b-jets. A selection is then applied that gives an efficiency of about 70 %, on average, for identifying true b-jets, while the efficiencies for accepting c-jets or light-quark jets are 1/5 and 1/140 respectively [30,[80][81][82][83]. The νν search uses an alternative version of this discriminant, 'MV1' [80], to reject background due to top-quark production; compared with MV1c it has a smaller c-jet rejection. Tag efficiencies and mistag rates are calibrated using data. For the purpose of forming the invariant mass of the b-jets, m bb , the energies of b-tagged jets are corrected to account for muons within the jets and an additional p T -dependent correction is applied to account for biases in the response due to resolution effects.Jets containing b-hadrons (b-jets) can be discriminated from other jets ('tagged') based on the relatively long lifetime of b-hadrons.

        <p>Higgs boson candidates in the search must have two same-flavour, opposite-charge lepton pairs. Muons must satisfy p T &gt; 6 GeV and |η| &lt; 2.7, while electrons are identified using the likelihood discriminant corresponding to the 'loose LH' selection from Ref. [73] and must satisfy p T &gt; 7 GeV. The impact parameter requirements that are made for muons are also applied to electrons, and electrons (muons) must also satisfy a requirement on the transverse impact parameter significance, |d 0 |/σ d 0 &lt; 6.5 (3.5). For this search, the trackbased isolation requirement is relaxed to p ,isol T / p T &lt; 0.15 for both the electrons and muons. In addition, lepton candidates must also be isolated in E ,isol T , the sum of the transverse energies in calorimeter cells within a R = 0.2 cone around the candidate (excluding the deposit from the candidate itself). The requirement is E ,isol T / p T &lt; 0.2 for electrons, &lt;0.3 for muons with a matching ID track, and &lt;0.15 for other muons. The three highestp T leptons in the event must satisfy, in order, p T &gt; 20, 15, and 10 GeV. To ensure well-measured leptons, and reduce backgrounds containing electrons from bremsstrahlung, same-flavour leptons must be separated from each other by R &gt; 0.1, and differentflavour leptons by R &gt; 0.2. Jets that are R &lt; 0.2 from electrons are removed. Final states in this search are classified depending on the flavours of the leptons present: 4μ, 2e2μ, 2μ2e, and 4e. The selection of lepton pairs is made separately for each of these flavour combinations; the pair with invariant mass closest to the Z boson mass is called the leading pair and its invariant mass, m 12 , must be in the range 50-106 GeV. For the 2e2μ channel, the electrons form the leading pair, while for the 2μ2e channel the muons are leading. The second, subleading, pair of each combination is the pair from the remaining leptons with invariant mass m 34 closest to that of the Z boson in the range m min &lt; m 34 &lt; 115 GeV. Here m min is 12 GeV for m &lt; 140 GeV, rises linearly to 50 GeV at m = 190 GeV, and remains at 50 GeV for m &gt; 190 GeV. Finally, if more than one flavour combination passes the selection, which could happen for events with more than four leptons, the flavour combination with the highest expected signal acceptance is kept; i.e., in the order: 4μ, 2e2μ, 2μ2e, and 4e. For 4μ and 4e events, if an oppositecharge same-flavour dilepton pair is found with m below 5 GeV, the event is vetoed in order to reject backgrounds from J/ψ decays.Higgs boson candidates in the search must have two same-flavour, opposite-charge lepton pairs. Muons must satisfy p T &gt; 6 GeV and |η| &lt; 2.7, while electrons are identified using the likelihood discriminant corresponding to the 'loose LH' selection from Ref. [73] and must satisfy p T &gt; 7 GeV. The impact parameter requirements that are made for muons are also applied to electrons, and electrons (muons) must also satisfy a requirement on the transverse impact parameter significance, |d 0 |/σ d 0 &lt; 6.5 (3.5).

To ensure well-measured leptons, and reduce backgrounds containing electrons from bremsstrahlung, same-flavour leptons must be separated from each other by R &gt; 0.1, and differentflavour leptons by R &gt; 0.2. Jets that are R &lt; 0.2 from electrons are removed. Final states in this search are classified depending on the flavours of the leptons present: 4μ, 2e2μ, 2μ2e, and 4e.

The second, subleading, pair of each combination is the pair from the remaining leptons with invariant mass m 34 closest to that of the Z boson in the range m min &lt; m 34 &lt; 115 GeV. Here m min is 12 GeV for m &lt; 140 GeV, rises linearly to 50 GeV at m = 190 GeV, and remains at 50 GeV for m &gt; 190 GeV. Finally, if more than one flavour combination passes the selection, which could happen for events with more than four leptons, the flavour combination with the highest expected signal acceptance is kept; i.e., in the order: 4μ, 2e2μ, 2μ2e, and 4e. For 4μ and 4e events, if an oppositecharge same-flavour dilepton pair is found with m below 5 GeV, the event is vetoed in order to reject backgrounds from J/ψ decays.</p>
        <p>To improve the mass resolution, the four-momentum of any reconstructed photon consistent with having been radiated from one of the leptons in the leading pair is added to the final state. Also, the four-momenta of the leptons in the leading pair are adjusted by means of a kinematic fit assuming a Z → decay; this improves the m resolution by up to 15 %, depending on m H . This is not applied to the subleading pair in order to retain sensitivity at lower m H where one of the Z boson decays may be off-shell. For 4μ events, the resulting mass resolution varies from 1.5 % at m H = 200 GeV to 3.5 % at m H = 1 TeV, while for 4e events it ranges from 2 % at m H = 200 GeV to below 1 % at 1 TeV.To improve the mass resolution, the four-momentum of any reconstructed photon consistent with having been radiated from one of the leptons in the leading pair is added to the final state.

        <p>Signal events can be produced via ggF or VBF, or associated production (VH, where V stands for either a W or a Z boson). In order to measure the rates for these processes separately, events passing the event selection described above are classified into channels, either ggF, VBF, or VH. Events containing at least two jets with p T &gt; 25 GeV and |η| &lt; 2.5 or p T &gt; 30 GeV and 2.5 &lt; |η| &lt; 4.5 and with the leading two such jets having m j j &gt; 130 GeV are classified as VBF events. Otherwise, if a jet pair satisfying the same p T and η requirements is present but with 40 &lt; m j j &lt; 130 GeV, the event is classified as VH, providing it also passes a selection on a multivariate discriminant used to separate the VH and ggF signal. The multivariate discriminant makes use of m j j , η j j , the p T of the two jets, and the η of the leading jet. In order to account for leptonic decays of the V (W or Z ) boson, events failing this selection may still be classified as VH if an additional lepton with p T &gt; 8 GeV is present. All remaining events are classified as ggF. Due to the differing background compositions and signal resolutions, events in the ggF channel are further classified into subchannels according to their final state: 4e, 2e2μ, 2μ2e, or 4μ. The selection for VBF is looser than that used in the other searches; however, the effect on the final results is small. The m distributions for the three channels are shown in Fig. 1.Signal events can be produced via ggF or VBF, or associated production (VH, where V stands for either a W or a Z boson). In order to measure the rates for these processes separately, events passing the event selection described above are classified into channels, either ggF, VBF, or VH. Events containing at least two jets with p T &gt; 25 GeV and |η| &lt; 2.5 or p T &gt; 30 GeV and 2.5 &lt; |η| &lt; 4.5 and with the leading two such jets having m j j &gt; 130 GeV are classified as VBF events. Otherwise, if a jet pair satisfying the same p T and η requirements is present but with 40 &lt; m j j &lt; 130 GeV, the event is classified as VH, providing it also passes a selection on a multivariate discriminant used to separate the VH and ggF signal. The multivariate discriminant makes use of m j j , η j j , the p T of the two jets, and the η of the leading jet. In order to account for leptonic decays of the V (W or Z ) boson, events failing this selection may still be classified as VH if an additional lepton with p T &gt; 8 GeV is present. All remaining events are classified as ggF. Due to the differing background compositions and signal resolutions, events in the ggF channel are further classified into subchannels according to their final state: 4e, 2e2μ, 2μ2e, or 4μ.

        <p>The μμ non-Z Z background comprises mostly t t and Z +b b events, where in the latter the muons arise mostly from heavy-flavour semileptonic decays, and to a lesser extent from π /K in-flight decays. The contribution from single-top production is negligible. The normalization of each component is estimated by a simultaneous fit to the m 12 distribution in four control regions, defined by inverting the impact parameter significance or isolation requirements on the subleading muon, or by selecting a subleading eμ or samecharge pair. A small contribution from W Z decays is estimated using simulation. The electron background contributing to the ee final states comes mainly from jets misidentified as electrons, arising in three ways: light-flavour hadrons misidentified as electrons, photon conversions reconstructed as electrons, and non-isolated electrons from heavy-flavour hadronic decays. This background is estimated in a control region in which the three highestp T leptons must satisfy the full selection, with the third lepton being an electron. For the lowestp T lepton, which must also be an electron, the impact parameter and isolation requirements are removed and the likelihood requirement is relaxed. In addition, it must have the same charge as the other subleading electron in order to minimize the contribution from the Z Z ( * ) background. The yields of the background components of the lowestp T lepton are extracted with a fit to the number of hits in the innermost pixel layer and the ratio of the number of high-threshold to low-threshold TRT hits (which provides discrimination between electrons and pions).

Next, if a jet is within a cone of R = 0.4 of a muon, the jet is discarded if it has less than two matched tracks or if the JVF recalculated without muons (see Sect. 4) is less than 0.5, since in this case it is likely to originate from a muon having showered in the calorimeter; otherwise the muon is discarded.

        <p>The discriminating variable for this search is the transverse mass of the ννqq system, shown in Fig. 9, defined as in Eq. ( 1) with p j j T replacing p T . To improve the transverse mass resolution, the energies of the leading two jets are scaled event-by-event by a multiplicative factor to set the dijet invariant mass m j j to the Z boson mass, in the same manner as in the qq search. This improves the transverse mass resolution by approximately 20 % at m H = 400 GeV and by approximately 10 % at m H = 1 TeV. The resulting a cross-section corresponding to 20 times the observed limit given in Sect. 11, while for the m H = 900 GeV hypothesis (c, d) it is normalized to 30 times the observed limit. The contribution labelled as 'Top' includes both the t t and single-top processes. The bottom panes show the ratio of the observed data to the predicted background resolution in m T ranges from about 9 % at m H = 400 GeV to 14 % at m H = 1 TeV.The discriminating variable for this search is the transverse mass of the ννqq system, shown in Fig. 9, defined as in Eq.

        <p>The dominant backgrounds for this search are Z + jets, W + jets, and t t production. The normalization of the Z + jets background is determined using the Z + jets control region from the qq channel in the final profile-likelihood fit as described in Sect. 10. To check how well this background is modelled after the ννqq selection, an alternative Z + jets control region is defined in the same way as the signal sample for m bin H = 400 GeV except that events must contain exactly two loose muons. The E miss T is calculated without including the muons and must satisfy the same requirement as for the signal: E miss no μ T &gt; 160 GeV. The Z +jets MC simulation is corrected as a function of φ j j and p T in the same manner as in the resolved ggF channel of the qq search, as described in Sect. 7.2 and Appendix B. The W + jets background estimate similarly uses a control sample with the same selection as the signal sample for m bin H = 400 GeV except that there must be exactly one loose muon and the E miss T requirement is again on E miss no μ T . The simulated W + jets sample is also split into several different flavour components, as in the case of Z + jets. The normalization of the W + j j and W + cj components are free to float in the final profile-likelihood fit, and are constrained by providing as input to the fit the distribution of the MV1c b-tagging category, described in Appendix A, in the 0-b-tag and 1-b-tag control regions. Unlike the Z + jets case, the 2b-tag control region is not used in the final profile-likelihood fit to constrain the W + bj and W +hf background components since it is highly dominated by t t production. Their normalizations are instead taken from the NNLO cross section predictions with an uncertainty of 50 %. The uncertainty is determined by comparing the nominal fit value from the profile-likelihood fit with the value when including the 2-btag control region, where W + bj and W +hf are free to float; this uncertainty also covers the normalization determined in Ref. [30]. Following Ref. [30], the agreement between simulation and data for this background is improved by applying a correction to φ j j for W + j j and W + cj, with half the correction assigned as a systematic uncertainty; in the case of W + bj and W +hf, no correction is applied, but a dedicated systematic uncertainty is assigned.The dominant backgrounds for this search are Z + jets, W + jets, and t t production.

        <p>Even after these corrections, the simulation does not accurately describe the data in the Z + jets and W + jets control sample with no b-tagged jets (which is dominated by Z /W + j j) for important kinematic distributions such as E miss T and jet transverse momenta. Moreover, because the resolution of the transverse mass of the Z Z → ν νq q system is worse than that of m j j , the ννqq search is more sensitive to E miss T (i.e. Z /W boson p T ) than the qq search. Therefore, a further correction is applied, as a linear function of E miss T , derived from measuring the ratio of the E miss T distributions from simulation and data in the control sample with no b-tagged jets after non-Z /W + j j backgrounds have been subtracted. An uncertainty of 50 % is assigned to this correction. Following this correction, there is good agreement between simulation and data, as shown in Figs. 10 and11. For higher m bin H signal samples, which have tighter selections on kinematic variables than the control sample, the E miss T correction is somewhat underestimated, leading to some remaining difference between data and pre-fit simulation at high m T , as can be seen in Fig. 9c. However, the profile-likelihood-ratio fit (Sect. 10) is able to correct this residual mismodelling, leading to reasonable agreement between the data and simulation.Even after these corrections, the simulation does not accurately describe the data in the Z + jets and W + jets control sample with no b-tagged jets (which is dominated by Z /W + j j) for important kinematic distributions such as E miss T and jet transverse momenta.

        <p>The uncertainty in the jet energy scale has several sources, including uncertainties in the in situ calibration analysis, corrections for pile-up, and the flavour composition of the sample [76,89]. These uncertainties are decomposed into independent components. For central jets, the total relative uncertainty on the jet energy scale ranges from about 3 % for jets with a p T of 20 GeV to about 1 % for a p T of 1 TeV. The calibration of the b-jet transverse energy has an additional uncertainty of 1-2 %. There is also an uncertainty in the jet energy resolution [90], which ranges from 10-20 % for jets with a p T of 20 GeV to less than 5 % for jets with p T &gt; 200 GeV. The uncertainty associated with the pile-up rejection requirement (Sect. 4) is evaluated by varying the nominal value of 50 % between 47 and 53 % [78].

        <p>Uncertainties on the lepton and jet energy scales are propagated into the uncertainty on E miss T . A contribution to E miss T also comes from energy deposits that are not associated with 123 any identified physics object; uncertainties on the energy calibration (8 %) and resolution (3 %) of the sum of these deposits are also propagated to the uncertainty on E miss T [91]. Uncertainties in the efficiency for tagging b-jets and in the rejection factor for light jets are determined from t t and dijet control samples [81][82][83]. Additional uncertainties account for differences in b-tagging efficiency between simulated samples generated with sherpa and pythia and for differences observed between standard b-tagging and truth tagging (defined at the end of Sect. 4) for close-by jets [30].Uncertainties on the lepton and jet energy scales are propagated into the uncertainty on E miss T .

        <p>The merged-jet channel of the qq search relies on measuring single-jet masses. To estimate the uncertainty in this measurement, jets reconstructed as described in Sect. 4 are compared with jets constructed using the same clustering algorithm but using as input charged-particle tracks rather than calorimeter energy deposits. The uncertainty is found using a procedure similar to that described in Ref. [92] by studying the double ratio of masses of jets found by both the calorimeter-and track-based algorithms: R m trackcalo = r m,data trackcalo /r m,MC trackcalo , where r m,X trackcalo = m X calo /m X track , X = data or MC simulation, and m is the jet mass. The uncertainty is taken as the deviation of this quantity from unity. Studies performed on dijet samples yield a constant value of 10 % for this uncertainty. Applying the jet mass calibration derived from single jets in generic multijet samples to merged jets originating from boosted Z bosons results in a residual topology-dependent miscalibration. This effect can be bounded by an additional uncertainty of 10 %. Adding these two effects in quadrature gives a total uncertainty on the jet mass scale of 14 %.

        <p>Acceptance uncertainties for the ggF and VBF (and VH for ) channels due to the uncertainty on the ≤1-jet and 2-jet cross-sections are estimated for the q q → Z Z ( * ) background by comparing the acceptance upon varying the factorization and renormalization scales and changing the PDF set. For this leads to uncertainties of 4, 8, and 3 % on the ggF, VBF, and VH channels, respectively, where the uncertainty is fully anti-correlated between the ggF channel and the VBF and VH channels. For the gg → Z Z ( * ) process where only LO generators are available, the VBF jets are simulated only in the parton shower, and so the acceptance uncertainty is estimated by taking the difference between the acceptances predicted by

        <p>The simultaneous fit proceeds as follows. For each channel of each search, there is a distribution of the data with respect to some discriminating variable; these distributions are fitted to a sum of signal and backgrounds. The particular variables used are summarized in Table 3. The distributions for the search are unbinned, since the resolution of m is very good, while other searches have binned distributions. For the VBF channels of the νν search, only the overall event counts are used, rather than distributions, as the sample sizes are very small. The qq and ννqq searches include additional distributions in control regions in order to constrain the background, using either distributions of the mass variable or of the MV1c b-tagging category.

The observed limits can be compared with expectations by generating 'Asimov' data sets, which are representative event samples that provide both the median expectation for an experimental result and its expected statistical variation in the asymptotic approximation, as described in Refs. [104,105]. When producing the Asimov data set for the expected limits, the backgroundonly hypothesis is assumed and the cross-sections for both ggF and VBF production of the heavy Higgs boson are set to zero. The remaining nuisance parameters are set to the value that maximizes the likelihood function for the observed data (profiled). When using the asymptotic procedure to calculate limits it is necessary to generate an Asimov data set both for the background-only hypothesis and for the signal hypothe-sis. When setting the observed limits, the cross-section for the other production mode not under consideration is profiled to data before generating the background-only Asimov data set.As no significant excess is observed, exclusion limits are calculated with a modified frequentist method [103], also known as C L s , using the qμ test statistic in the asymptotic approximation [104,105].

Also shown are expected limits from the , νν and the combined qq +ννqq searches (the latter two searches are only shown in combination as they share control regions). At low mass the search has the best sensitivity while at high For example, the excess occurring around 200 GeV and the deficit occurring around 300 GeV arise from the (see Fig. 1) search. Deficits at higher mass are driven by fluctuations in the qq search (see Figs. 3 and6).Limits on the cross-section times branching ratio from the combination of all of the searches are shown in Fig. 12.

        <p>Figure 13 shows exclusion limits in the cos(β -α) versus tan β plane for Type-I and Type-II 2HDMs, for a heavy Higgs boson with mass m H = 200 GeV. This m H value is chosen so the assumption of a narrow-width Higgs boson is valid over most of the parameter space, and the experimental sensitivity is at a maximum. As explained in Sect. 3.2, the range of cos(β -α) and tan β explored is limited to the region where the assumption of a heavy narrow-width Higgs boson with negligible interference is valid. When calculating the limits at a given choice of cos(β -α) and tan β, the relative rate of ggF and VBF production in the fit is set according to the prediction of the 2HDM for that parameter choice. Figure 14 shows exclusion limits as a function of the heavy Higgs boson mass m H and the parameter tan β for cos(β -α) = -0.1. The white regions in the exclusion plots indicate regions of parameter space not excluded by the present analysis; in these regions the cross-section predicted by the 2HDM is below the experimental sensitivity. Compared with recent studies of indirect limits [106], the exclusion presented here is considerably more stringent for Type-I with cos(β -α) &lt; 0 and 1 &lt; tan β &lt; 2, and for Type-II with 0.5 &lt; tan β &lt; 2.Figure 13 shows exclusion limits in the cos(β -α) versus tan β plane for Type-I and Type-II 2HDMs, for a heavy Higgs boson with mass m H = 200 GeV.

        <p>The previously published ATLAS results using data collected at √ s = 7 TeV [5][6][7] assumed a SM Higgs boson with the relative rate of ggF and VBF production fixed to the SM prediction. Thus, they are not directly comparable with the current results, which assume that the heavy Higgs boson has a narrow width but also allow the rates of ggF and VBF production to vary independently. These results are also not directly comparable with the recent results published by the CMS Collaboration [8] for similar reasons.The previously published ATLAS results using data collected at √ s = 7 TeV [5][6][7] assumed a SM Higgs boson with the relative rate of ggF and VBF production fixed to the SM prediction.

        <p>A search is presented for a high-mass Higgs boson in the H → Z Z → + -+ -, H → Z Z → + -ν ν, H → Z Z → + -q q, and H → Z Z → ν νq q decay modes using the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The search uses proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb -1 . The results of the search are interpreted in the scenario of a heavy Higgs boson with a width that is small compared with the experimental mass resolution. The Higgs boson mass range considered extends up to 1 TeV for all four decay modes and down to as low as 140 GeV, depending on the decay mode. No significant excess of events over the Standard Model prediction is found. Limits on production and decay of a heavy Higgs boson to two Z bosons are set separately for gluon-fusion and vectorboson-fusion production modes. For the combination of all decay modes, 95 % CL upper limits range from 0.53 pb at m H = 195 GeV to 0.008 pb at m H = 950 GeV for the gluonfusion production mode and from 0.31 pb at m H = 195 GeV to 0.009 pb at m H = 950 GeV for the vector-boson-fusion production mode. The results are also interpreted in the context of Type-I and Type-II two-Higgs-doublet models, with exclusion contours given in the cos(β -α) versus tan β and m H versus tan β planes for m H = 200 GeV. This m H value is chosen so that the assumption of a narrow-width Higgs boson is valid over most of the parameter space, and so that the experimental sensitivity is at a maximum. Compared with recent studies of indirect limits, the two-Higgs-doublet model exclusion presented here is considerably more stringent for Type-I with cos(β -α) &lt; 0 and 1 &lt; tan β &lt; 2, and for Type-II with 0.5 &lt; tan β &lt; 2. and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

The bin boundaries correspond to the operating points (MV1c(jet) OP) giving b-tagging efficiencies of 100, 80, 70, and 50 %; i.e., the b-jet purity increases from left (bottom) to right (top). The event categories are labelled VL, L, M, T, and VT according to the definitions in the text, and the different colours correspond to events with 0, 1, and 2 identified b-jets simulation (prior to the likelihood fit) as a function of the azimuthal angle between the two signal jets, φ j j , and the transverse momentum of the leptonic Z boson, p T , following Ref. [30]. The simulation does not model well the observed φ j j distribution in the untagged control regions for p T &lt; 120 GeV; this is not seen at higher p T or in the tagged control region. In order to improve the modelling, the Z + j j component of the background with p T &lt; 120 GeV is scaled by a linear function derived from the control region with no b-tagged jets at low p T with non-Z boson backgrounds subtracted. Half the value of the correction is taken as a systematic uncertainty where it is applied. In the Z +hf sample with p T &lt; 120 GeV, the full value of the correction is taken as an uncertainty. For p T &gt; 120 GeV, no correction is applied for any sample. In this region, a linear fit is performed to the data/MC ratio of φ j j in the untagged subchannel after subtracting the small non-Z background, and the uncertainty on the fitted slope taken as an uncertainty for all Z + jets samples. Following this correction, the description of the p T distribution in the control region with no b-tagged jets also improves, but there is still some residual discrepancy seen in the control regions that have btagged jets. Thus, the Z +hf background component is scaled by a function logarithmic in p T , determined from the combination of the control regions with one or more b-tagged jets (after subtracting the Z + j j and non-Z + jets back- ). An uncertainty of half this correction is applied for all Z + jets channels. (All these uncertainties are taken to be uncorrelated between the Z + light-jet and Z +hf samples.) Following these corrections, the simulation models both the φ j j and p T distributions well in all Z +jets control regions.A search is presented for a high-mass Higgs boson in the H → Z Z → + -+ -, H → Z Z → + -ν ν, H → Z Z → + -q q, and H → Z Z → ν νq q decay modes using the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.

        <p>It has been observed in an unfolded measurement of the p T distribution of t t quark pairs that the simulation does not accurately describe the p t t T distribution [107]. To correct for this, t t MC events are weighed by a function of p t t T taken from 7 TeV data from Ref. [107] in order to make the simulation match the data. The correction is validated for 8 TeV data using the eμ top-quark control region, and the uncertainty in this correction is estimated by varying it from 50 to 150 % of its nominal value.It has been observed in an unfolded measurement of the p T distribution of t t quark pairs that the simulation does not accurately describe the p t t T distribution [107].
