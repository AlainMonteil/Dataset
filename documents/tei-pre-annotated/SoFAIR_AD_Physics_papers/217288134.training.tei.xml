        <p>Using the formalism of parton virtuality distribution functions (VDFs) we establish a connection between the transverse momentum dependent distributions (TMDs) F (x, k 2 ⊥ ) and quasi-distributions (PQDs) Q (y, p 3 ) introduced recently by X. Ji for lattice QCD extraction of parton distributions f (x). We build models for PQDs from the VDF-based models for soft TMDs, and analyze the p 3 dependence of the resulting PQDs. We observe a strong nonperturbative evolution of PQDs for small and moderately large values of p 3 reflecting the transverse momentum dependence of TMDs. Thus, the study of PQDs on the lattice in the domain of strong nonperturbative effects opens a new perspective for investigation of the 3-dimensional hadron structure.Using the formalism of parton virtuality distribution functions (VDFs) we establish a connection between the transverse momentum dependent distributions (TMDs) F (x, k 2 ⊥ ) and quasi-distributions (PQDs) Q (y, p 3 ) introduced recently by X.

        <p>The parton distribution functions (PDFs) f (x), being related to matrix elements of nonlocal operators near the light cone z 2 = 0 are notoriously difficult objects for a calculation using the lattice gauge theory. The latter is formulated in the Euclidean space where light-like separations do not exist. Recently, X. Ji [1] proposed to use purely space-like separations z = (0, 0, 0, z 3 ) to overcome this problem.The parton distribution functions (PDFs) f (x), being related to matrix elements of nonlocal operators near the light cone z 2 = 0 are notoriously difficult objects for a calculation using the lattice gauge theory.

However, since the values of p 3 used in these calculations are not very large, the observed p 3 evolution does not have a perturbative form.

        <p>To this end, in Section 2 we extend the VDF formalism onto the parton distribution functions, and show how the basic VDF (x, σ ) is related to PDFs, to TMDs and to PQDs. In particular, we show that PQDs are completely determined by TMDs through a rather simple transformation. Since the basic relations between the parton distributions are rather insensitive to complications brought by spin, in Section 2 we refer to a simple scalar model.

        <p>One may notice that the O α (0, z; A) operator involves a straight-line link from 0 to z rather than a stapled link usually used in the definitions of TMDs appearing in the description of Drell-Yan and semi-inclusive DIS processes. As is well-known, the stapled links reflect initial or final state interactions inherent in these processes. The "straight-link" TMDs, in this sense, describe the structure of a hadron when it is in its non-disturbed or "primordial" state. While it is unlikely that such a TMD can be measured in a scattering experiment, it is a well-defined QFT object, and one may hope that it can be measured on the lattice through its connection (2.29) to the quasi-distributions.One may notice that the O α (0, z; A) operator involves a straight-line link from 0 to z rather than a stapled link usually used in the definitions of TMDs appearing in the description of Drell-Yan and semi-inclusive DIS processes.

        <p>In this paper, we applied the formalism of parton virtuality distributions to study the p 3 -dependence of quasi-distributions Q (y, p 3 ). We established a simple relation between PQDs and TMDs that allows to derive models for PQDs from the models for TMDs. Our model results show a pronounced nonperturbative evolution of PQDs for small and moderately large values of p 3 reflecting the transverse momentum dependence of TMDs, i.e. the spatial structure of the hadrons. Using two rather different models for the k ⊥ dependence of TMDs, we obtained very similar patterns of the p 3 dependence of PQDs Q (y, p 3 ) for each particular y. This observation may be used for a guided extrapolation of the moderate-p 3 lattice results to the p 3 → ∞ limit. The basic idea is to find analytic models for soft TMDs that would successfully fit lattice PQDs for several values of p 3 , and then take the p 3 → ∞ limit. A practical implementation of this program should be a subject of future studies.In this paper, we applied the formalism of parton virtuality distributions to study the p 3 -dependence of quasi-distributions Q (y, p 3 ).
