        <p>This Letter describes a model-agnostic search for pairs of jets (dijets) produced by resonant and non-resonant phenomena beyond the Standard Model in 3.6 fb -1 of proton-proton collisions with a centre-of-mass energy of √ s = 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider.This Letter describes a model-agnostic search for pairs of jets (dijets) produced by resonant and non-resonant phenomena beyond the Standard Model in 3.6 fb -1 of proton-proton collisions with a centre-of-mass energy of √ s = 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider.</p>
        <p>The distribution of the invariant mass of the two leading jets is examined for local excesses above a data-derived estimate of the smoothly falling prediction of the Standard Model. The data are also compared to a Monte Carlo simulation of Standard Model angular distributions derived from the rapidity of the two jets. No evidence of anomalous phenomena is observed in the data, which are used to exclude, at 95% CL, quantum black holes with threshold masses below 8.3 TeV, 8.1 TeV, or 5.1 TeV in three different benchmark scenarios; resonance masses below 5.2 TeV for excited quarks, 2.6 TeV in a W model, a range of masses starting from m Z = 1.5 TeV and couplings from g q = 0.2 in a Z model; and contact interactions with a compositeness scale below 12.0 TeV and 17.5 TeV respectively for destructive and constructive interference between the new interaction and QCD processes. These results significantly extend the ATLAS limits obtained from 8 TeV data. Gaussian-shaped contributions to the mass distribution are also excluded if the effective cross-section exceeds values ranging from approximately 50-300 fb for masses below 2 TeV to 2-20 fb for masses above 4 TeV.The distribution of the invariant mass of the two leading jets is examined for local excesses above a data-derived estimate of the smoothly falling prediction of the Standard Model.

        <p>The centre-of-mass energy of proton-proton (pp) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN has been increased from √ s = 8 TeV to √ s = 13 TeV, opening a new energy regime to observation. New particles produced in LHC collisions must interact with the constituent partons of the proton. Consequently, the new particles can also produce partons in the final state. Final states including partons often dominate in models of new phenomena beyond the Standard Model (BSM). The partons shower and hadronize, creating collimated jets of particles carrying approximately the fourmomenta of the partons. The total production rates for two-jet (dijet) BSM signals can be large, allowing searches for anomalous dijet production to test for such signals with a relatively small data sample, even at masses that constitute significant fractions of the total hadron collision energy.The centre-of-mass energy of proton-proton (pp) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN has been increased from √ s = 8 TeV to √ s = 13 TeV, opening a new energy regime to observation.

        <p>In the Standard Model (SM), hadron collisions produce jet pairs primarily via 2 → 2 parton scattering processes governed by quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Far above the confinement scale of QCD (≈1 GeV), jets emerge from collisions with large transverse E-mail address: atlas.publications@cern.ch. momenta, p T , perpendicular to the direction of the incident partons. For the data analysed here, QCD predicts a smoothly falling dijet invariant mass distribution, m jj . New states decaying to two jets may introduce localized excesses in this distribution. In QCD, due to t-channel poles in the cross-sections for the dominant scattering processes, most dijet production occurs at small angles θ * , defined as the polar angle in the dijet centre-of-mass frame. 1 Many theories of BSM physics predict additional dijet production with a significant population of jets produced at large angles with respect to the beam; for reviews see Refs. [1,2]. The search reported in this Letter exploits these generic features of BSM signals in an analysis of the m jj and angular distributions.In the Standard Model (SM), hadron collisions produce jet pairs primarily via 2 → 2 parton scattering processes governed by quantum chromodynamics (QCD).

The reconstruction efficiency for jets with p T above 20 GeV is 100%. Jet calibrations derived from √ s = 13 TeV simulation, and collision data taken at √ s = 8 TeV and √ s = 13 TeV, are used to correct the jet energies and directions to those of the particles from the hard-scatter interaction. This calibration procedure, described in Refs. [25][26][27], is improved by a data-derived correction to the relative calibration of jets in the central and the forward regions. The dijet mass resolution is 2.4% and 2%, for dijet masses of 2 and 5 TeV respectively. The jet energy scale uncertainty from 8 TeV data is complemented by systematic uncertainties covering the differences between 8 TeV and 13 TeV data. The total jet energy scale uncertainty is 1% for central jets with p T of 500 GeV, and 3% for jets of 2 TeV. Analysis of jet data at 13 TeV using the in situ techniques described in Ref.

For each interval in the scan, it computes the significance of any excess found. The algorithm identifies the interval 1.53-1.61 TeV, indicated by the two vertical lines in Fig. 1, as the most discrepant interval. The statistical significance of this outcome is evaluated using the ensemble of possible outcomes across all intervals scanned, by applying the algorithm to many pseudo-data samples drawn randomly from the background fit. Without including systematic uncertainties, the probability that fluctuations of the background model would produce an excess at least as significant as the one observed in the data, anywhere in the distribution, is 0.67.

        <p>Theoretical uncertainties in simulations of the angular distributions from QCD processes are estimated as described in Ref. [19]. The effect on the QCD prediction of varying the PDFs is estimated using NLOJET++ with three different PDF sets: CT10 [53], MSTW2008 [54] and NNPDF23 [32]. As the choice of PDF largely affects the total cross-section rather than the shape of the χ distributions, these uncertainties are negligible (&lt; 1%). The uncertainty due to the choice of renormalization and factorization scales was estimated using NLOJET++ by varying each independently up and down by a factor two, excluding opposite variations. The resulting uncertainty, taken as the envelope of the variations in the normalized χ distributions, depends on both m jj and χ , rising to 20% at the smallest χ values at high m jj values. The statistical uncertainty of the simulated NLO corrections is less than 1%. The dominant experimental uncertainty in the predictions of the χ distributions is the jet energy scale uncertainty, with an impact of at most 25% at high m jj values. The uncertainty in the jet energy resolution has negligible impact. The theoretical uncertainties and the total uncertainties are displayed as shaded bands around the prediction.Theoretical uncertainties in simulations of the angular distributions from QCD processes are estimated as described in Ref.

The uncertainty due to the choice of renormalization and factorization scales was estimated using NLOJET++ by varying each independently up and down by a factor two, excluding opposite variations. The resulting uncertainty, taken as the envelope of the variations in the normalized χ distributions, depends on both m jj and χ , rising to 20% at the smallest χ values at high m jj values. The statistical uncertainty of the simulated NLO corrections is less than 1%. The dominant experimental uncertainty in the predictions of the χ distributions is the jet energy scale uncertainty, with an impact of at most 25% at high m jj values. The uncertainty in the jet energy resolution has negligible impact. The theoretical uncertainties and the total uncertainties are displayed as shaded bands around the prediction.</p>

        <p>The data are used to constrain several of the many BSM models that predict dijet excesses. Quantum black holes, excited quarks, and W and Z bosons would produce peaks in the m jj distribution. Contact interactions would introduce smooth changes in the high-mass tail of the m jj distribution that could be detected in the analysis of the χ distributions. The signal models are simulated using the parton-level generators indicated below, in an identical manner to QCD processes, using the same PDFs and parameters for non-perturbative effects, except where noted otherwise.The data are used to constrain several of the many BSM models that predict dijet excesses.

        <p>The LHC could produce black holes with masses at or above the fundamental scale of gravity, M D , if that scale is lowered to a few TeV by the existence of extra spatial dimensions [2,44,45,[57][58][59][60]. High-multiplicity final states from thermalizing black holes are explored at √ s = 13 TeV by ATLAS in Ref. [61]. This analysis explores quantum black holes (QBHs), which would be produced near M D and decay into a few particles rather than high-multiplicity final states [44][45][46]62], appearing in the m jj distribution as an excess localized at the threshold mass for the quantum black hole production, M th . Here, production and decay to two jets is simulated using the QBH generator [63] or the BlackMax generator [46], 3 assuming an Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulous-Dvali (ADD) scenario [64,65] with M D = M th and a number of extra dimensions n = 6, as in Ref. [17], and a Randall-Sundrum scenario (RS1) [66] with n = 1 using the QBH generator. In these models, the branching ratio to dijets is greater than 96%. The acceptance times efficiency of the resonance (angular) selection for a quantum black hole with a threshold mass of 6.5 TeV is 53% (92%) for both generators. The PDFs used are CTEQ6L1 [67]. Excited quarks (q * ) [39,40] are predicted in models of compositeness and are a benchmark for quark-gluon resonances [8,9,14,15]. The q * model is simulated with 
            <rs type="software">Pythia</rs>
            <rs type="version">8</rs>, assuming spin-1/2 excited quarks with coupling constants the same as for SM quarks. As in Ref. [40], the compositeness scale is set equal to the excited quark mass, m q * , and the SU(3), SU(2), and U(1) coupling multipliers f s = f = f = 1. The renormalization and factorization scales are set to the average p T of the two leading jets. In the simulation, only the decay of the excited quark to a gluon and an up-or down-type quark is modelled; this corresponds to a branching ratio of 85%. Before parton shower effects are taken into account, the intrinsic width of the q * signals is comparable to the detector resolution. The resonance selection acceptance times efficiency for a q * with a mass of 4 TeV is 58%.
        </p>
        <p>Additional spin-1 W and Z bosons often arise in the symmetry breaking of extended gauge theories. A W model [41] with V -A SM couplings and a corresponding branching ratio to dijets of 75% is considered. In this analysis, events are simulated in 
            <rs type="software">Pythia</rs> 8 and decays are restricted to quark-antiquark pairs with all six quark flavours included. Events including top decays were not removed from the analysis, resulting in conservative limits. A leptophobic Z model [42] is also simulated, with matrix elements calculated in 
            <rs type="software">MadGraph</rs> 5 [68] and parton showering performed in 
            <rs type="software">Pythia</rs> 8. The Z model assumes axial-vector couplings to all SM quarks and to a Dirac fermion dark matter candidate. No interference with the SM is simulated for either the W or the Z model and decays involving top quarks are included. The Z model considered follows a scenario [43] where its decays to dark matter are negligible, hence the dijet production rate and resonance width depend only on the coupling to quarks, g q , and the mass of the resonance m Z . Before parton shower effects are considered, the intrinsic width of the W and Z signals range from 0.05% for a Z with a mass of 1.5 TeV and g q = 0.1 to 10% for a Z with a mass of 3.5 TeV and g q = 0.5. The resonance selection acceptance times efficiency for a mass of 3 TeV is 40% for the W model and 47% for the Z model with g q = 0.2.

        <p>Results are also provided as limits on the cross-section times acceptance times branching ratio to two jets, σ × A × BR, of a hypothetical signal that produces a Gaussian contribution to the observed m jj distribution. For sufficiently narrow resonances, these results may be used to set limits in BSM models beyond those considered explicitly in this Letter. These limits should be used when PDF and non-perturbative effects can be safely truncated or neglected and, after applying the resonance selection, the reconstructed m jj distribution predicted by the model approaches a Gaussian distribution. Predicted BSM signals with an intrinsic width much smaller than 5% should be compared to the limit curve for width equal to the experimental resolution. Predicted signals with larger widths should be compared with the limit that corresponds most closely to the width of the Gaussian contribution predicted by the model. More instructions can be found in Appendix A of Ref.

            <rs type="software">Pythia 8</rs>. This type of coupling is chosen because its angular distributions are representative of those of other BSM models. Interference of the signal model with the SM process q q → q q is included. Events are simulated for both constructive and destructive interference with = 7 TeV. From this sample, the angular distributions for other values of are obtained using the fact that the interference term is proportional to 1/ 2 and the pure contact-interaction cross-section is proportional to 1/ 4 . The Pythia 8 signal prediction is reweighted to the NLO cross-sections provided by CI-JET [70]. Uncertainties in the prediction of the angular distributions for contact-interaction signals are obtained in the same manner as for QCD processes.

        <p>Starting from the m jj distribution obtained with the resonance selection, a Bayesian method [14] is applied to the data and simulation of signals at a series of discrete masses to set 95% credibility-level upper limits on the cross-section times acceptance for the signals described above. The method uses a constant prior for signal cross-section and Gaussian priors for nuisance parameters corresponding to systematic uncertainties. The expected limits are calculated using pseudo-experiments generated from the maximum-likelihood values for parameters of the background-only model in Eq. (1) using the full systematic uncertainties in both the signal and background models. The limit is interpolated logarithmically between the discrete masses to create curves continuous in signal mass. The mass limits for each of those models are shown in Figs. 3 and4 and Table 1.

        <p>Fig. 5 shows limits on the Gaussian contributions to the observed m jj distribution obtained for a mean mass m G and four different widths, from a width equal to the detector mass resolution to a width of 15% of the mean of the Gaussian mass distribution. Limits are set only when m G is within 1.1 TeV-6.9 TeV and separated by at least twice the width of the Gaussian from the endpoints of this range. Intrinsically narrow resonances with effective cross-sections exceeding values ranging from approximately 50-300 fb for masses below 2 TeV to 2-20 fb for masses above 4 TeV are excluded. As the width increases, the expected signal contribution is distributed across more bins. Therefore wider signals are affected less than narrower signals by statistical fluctuations of the data in a single bin.Fig. 5 shows limits on the Gaussian contributions to the observed m jj distribution obtained for a mean mass m G and four different widths, from a width equal to the detector mass resolution to a width of 15% of the mean of the Gaussian mass distribution.
