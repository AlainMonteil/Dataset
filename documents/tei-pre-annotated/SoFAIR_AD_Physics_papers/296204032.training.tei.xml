        <p>Quantum entanglements between integer-order and fractional-order orbital angular momentums (OAMs) have been previously discussed. However, the entangled nature of arbitrary rational-order OAM has long been considered a myth due to the absence of an effective strategy for generating arbitrary rational-order OAM beams. Therefore, we report a single metadevice comprising a bilaterally symmetric grating with an aperture, creating optical beams with dynamically controllable OAM values that are continuously varying over a rational range. Due to its encoded spiniform phase, this novel metagrating enables the production of an average OAM that can be increased without a theoretical limit by embracing distributed singularities, which differs significantly from the classic method of stacking phase singularities using fork gratings. This new method makes it possible to probe the unexplored niche of quantum entanglement between arbitrarily defined OAMs in light, which could lead to the complex manipulation of microparticles, high-dimensional quantum entanglement and optical communication. We show that quantum coincidence based on rational-order OAM-superposition states could give rise to low cross-talks between two different states that have no significant overlap in their spiral spectra. Additionally, future applications in quantum communication and optical micromanipulation may be found.Quantum entanglements between integer-order and fractional-order orbital angular momentums (OAMs) have been previously discussed.

        <p>Light has many different properties that are described by its electromagnetic field. One of the most interesting properties of light is its ability to carry orbital angular momentum (OAM), which manifests itself as a helical wavefront with a phase singularity on the beam axis. Since its discovery in 1992 1 , the OAM of light has excited interest because it allows a new degree of freedom and a potentially unbounded number of quantum states for a light beam. The current commonly used technology has resulted in investigations using discrete integer OAMs for applications such as optical trapping and manipulation 2-8 , photon entanglement 9-12 , astronomy 13 , microscopy 14,15 , remote sensing and detection 16,17 , optical communications [18][19][20] and even integrated photonics [21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30] . The rapidly developing exploitation of such diverse areas requires further development of OAM generation technology.Light has many different properties that are described by its electromagnetic field.

        <p>Hitherto, the devices for OAM generation have been primarily concerned with producing integer values of OAM states, even though one can theoretically continuously tune the OAM by changing the topological charges (TCs) of LG and Bessel beams [31][32][33] or tailoring the ellipticity of Ince-Gaussian modes 34 . An OAM carrying beam has a helical phase e iℓφ (where ℓ and φ are the winding numbers of the helical phase and angular coordinate, respectively) 1 , giving rise to an intensity annulus (i.e., doughnut) that is uniform for the integer ℓ, while for fractional ℓ, the intensity annulus is discontinuous with a phase step along φ = 0. This smoothness leads to a similar influence on the design of the kinoform for generating the diffractive optical component, for example, fork gratings have smoothly varying fringes for integer ℓ and cutoff fringes with a discontinuity along φ = 0 for fractional ℓ 35,36 . This distinction makes it fundamentally difficult to transition between integer OAM and fractional OAM in a static device, resulting in poor reconfigurability since different OAM states must be individually addressed by separate devices or phase profiles [21][22][23][37][38][39][40] . Digital devices such as spatial light modulators (SLMs) 41 and digital micromirror devices (DMDs) 42 have been used to generate different OAM values. However, their pixel resolution limits lead to spatial phase jumps and account for inaccuracies of fractional OAM (see Section 1 in Supplementary Materials). Therefore, the community has to explore the applications of such digital devices (such as those for quantum entanglement) on the basis of the integer or fractional-order OAM [9][10][11][12]43,44 .Hitherto, the devices for OAM generation have been primarily concerned with producing integer values of OAM states, even though one can theoretically continuously tune the OAM by changing the topological charges (TCs) of LG and Bessel beams [31][32][33] or tailoring the ellipticity of Ince-Gaussian modes 34 .

        <p>Furthermore, tunable or continuous OAMs have recently received increasing attention for applications like path-OAM-interfaced quantum entanglement 45 and optical successive micromanipulation 46 . Attempts have been made to generate tunable OAMs using indirect methods such, as the weighted superposition of two cross-polarized beams 46 , the interference of two vortices 47 , internal conical diffraction 48 and optical geometric transformations 45,[49][50][51] . Although these methods offer a new degree of control for the OAM of light, they are intrinsically accompanied by either poor beam quality, very limited tunable ranges or complicated transformations that require optical correction after long-distance propagation.

        <p>Here, we report a continuous OAM transmitter including bilaterally symmetric gratings with an aperture that produces arbitrary rationalorder vortex beams carrying OAMs without any theoretical limit. Distinguished from other vortex beams (e.g., LG and Bessel beams) that change their OAMs by changing TCs, our rational-order OAM beam has a spiniform wavefront with phase singularities located equidistant along a line and tunes its average OAM by changing the number of singularities that the beam accommodates. This approach realizes both non-integer and arbitrary rational-order generation of OAM across the full range by transmitting these phase singularities through the aperture and enables the exploration of quantum entanglement based on such continuous OAMs for communication purposes.Here, we report a continuous OAM transmitter including bilaterally symmetric gratings with an aperture that produces arbitrary rationalorder vortex beams carrying OAMs without any theoretical limit.

        <p>Traditionally, light with a planar wavefront can increase its OAM by successively passing through ℓ concentric and vertically located spiral phase plates (SPPs), each of which has a TC of 1 35 . Similarly, light could also obtain an OAM by passing through a series of transversely located SPPs (Figure 1a), which have wavefronts with spatially separated singularities. One can increase the OAM of light by including more SPPs, leading to more phase singularities in the wavefront of the light. Hence, when a phase profile with regularly distributed (e.g., periodic) singularities is encoded into a beam generator, we infer that the optical vortices will be smoothly emitted, making it possible to generate a continuous OAM by employing a gradually varying aperture.Traditionally, light with a planar wavefront can increase its OAM by successively passing through ℓ concentric and vertically located spiral phase plates (SPPs), each of which has a TC of 1 35 .

        <p>Figure 2 shows the simulated and experimental results of the integer group (q = 1-4) at a wavelength of 532 nm. Under the assumption of uniform illumination, the simulated intensity and phase profiles of the light from the first-order diffraction in the Fraunhofer region are shown in Figure 2a. At q = 1, an elliptical transverse profile is formed with a single phase singularity, which splits into a two-lobed shape from q = 2 onwards due to the spatial mismatch of the singularities. As q increases, the central darkness expands to accommodate more phase singularities, moving the two lobes farther apart. Meanwhile, these two lobes shrink due to gradually weakening diffractions when the aperture continues to increase 52 . The simulated intensity profiles are well validated by the measurements in Figure 2b. Such an intensity profile originates from the interactions between the spiniform phase and operating circular aperture during its paraxial propagation, which act as low-pass filters in the Fraunhofer region 52 ; see Section 4 in the Supplementary Materials.Figure 2 shows the simulated and experimental results of the integer group (q = 1-4) at a wavelength of 532 nm.

        <p>the strength of the quantum correlation. The quantum contrast is defined as the ratio of the recorded coincidence rate to the expected accidental coincidence rate, where the accidental coincidences are calculated by multiplying the time resolution (refer to Ref. 59) of our coincidence counting electronics with the count rates detected by detectors A and B (see Figure 4a) 59,60 . In Figure 4c, the experimental quantum contrast gets smaller at larger |q A | values, which is mainly attributed to the limited quantum spiral bandwidth of the system 58 and the increasing noise. As q A changes in our experiment, the smooth spiral spectrum confirms that the proposed mechanism is valid for manipulating the OAM at the single-photon level.the strength of the quantum correlation.

        <p>The coincidence rates decrease gradually when both the q A and q B parameters deviate from q A =q B . To incorporate this effect, a linescan simulated coincidence at q B = 0 is shown with a width of w (which is evaluated by the full-width at its half-maximum) in the inset of Figure 4d. For a given q B , the width w determines the range of q A where the coincidence is high. The simulated and experimental widths as functions of q B are located at ∼ 0.925, see Figure 4e. The significance of this result is twofold. First, the vortex beams with discrete q values are preferred to avoid the strong cross-talks between two neighboring states. Second, the state interval (i.e., the minimum difference in OAMs between two states) should be larger than 0.925 to decrease the cross-talk.The coincidence rates decrease gradually when both the q A and q B parameters deviate from q A =q B .

        <p>Figure 4f shows the simulated and experimental coincidences between these discrete states (q A,B = 0, ± 1, ± 2, ± 3) with intervals of 1. Similarly, the maximum coincidence occurs when the diagonal elements obey q A =q B , as confirmed in both the simulated and experimental results. The coincidence rate of the non-diagonal case stands for the noise and should be suppressed to achieve a low crosstalk. The maximum probability among these non-diagonal cases is 0.0711 (the cross-talk is 10log 10 (0.0711) = -11.48 dB) in the simulations and 0.1952 (indicating a cross-talk of -7.1 dB) in the experiments. This discrepancy mainly originates from the imperfect generation of our vortex beam caused by SLM pixilation (i.e., the pixel pitch of 15 μm in our SLMs) and the small aperture (0.6 mm in diameter) of the efficient phase of the SLM, which leads to increased noise due to the decreased photon flux used for detection (see Section 8 in the Supplementary Materials). When the state interval is greater, the cross-talk could be further suppressed due to the overlapping of the spiral spectra between two neighboring states becoming smaller. Figure 4g shows that the experimental cross-talks are -10.24 dB for the interval 2 (with q A,B = ± 1, ± 3) and -10.56 dB for the interval 3 (with q A,B = 0, ± 3), which are comparable to the pure-OAM-based communication requirements 18,19,61 . The experimental and simulated results for intervals 2 and 3 are provided in Section 8 and Supplementary Fig. S9 of the Supplementary Materials.Figure 4f shows the simulated and experimental coincidences between these discrete states (q A,B = 0, ± 1, ± 2, ± 3) with intervals of 1.

        <p>From the simulated and experimental results, one can find that our vortex beam is able to select the superposition states of OAMs for quantum operations, although this selection is realized by using a phase-type SLM. We have to emphasize that a rigorously continuous generation of rational OAM must refer to the proposed mechanism of our metagratings combined with a smoothly tunable aperture. We also note that two issues should be addressed when carrying out quantum operations using continuous OAMs. First, the total size of the metagratings should be large so that a tunable aperture is available in practice. In this work, the largest diameter of our metagratings is ~480 μm, which is too small for a commonly used aperture. The fabrication of large-scale metagratings can be achieved by using laser direct-writing techniques. Second, the pump laser in the spontaneous parametric downconversion process should be strong enough to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the quantum coincidence because the total efficiency of our binary-amplitude gratings has a theoretical value of ~10%.From the simulated and experimental results, one can find that our vortex beam is able to select the superposition states of OAMs for quantum operations, although this selection is realized by using a phase-type SLM.
