        <p>String theory axions are interesting candidates for fields whose potential might be controllable over super-Planckian field ranges and therefore as possible candidates for inflatons in large field inflation. Axion monodromy scenarios are setups where the axion shift symmetry is broken by some effect such that the axion can traverse a large number of periods potentially leading to super-Planckian excursions. We study such scenarios in type IIA string theory where the axion shift symmetry is broken by background fluxes. In particular we calculate the backreaction of the energy density induced by the axion vacuum expectation value on its own field space metric. We find universal behaviour for all the compactifications studied where up to a certain critical axion value there is only a small backreaction effect. Beyond the critical value the backreaction is strong and implies that the proper field distance as measured by the backreacted metric increases at best logarithmically with the axion vev, thereby placing strong limitations on extending the field distance any further. The critical axion value can be made arbitrarily large by the choice of fluxes. However the backreaction of these fluxes on the axion field space metric ensures a precise cancellation such that the proper field distance up to the critical axion value is flux independent and remains sub-Planckian. We also study an axion alignment scenario for type IIA compactifications on a twisted torus with four fundamental axions mixing to leave an axion with an effective decay constant which is flux dependent. There is a choice of fluxes for which the alignment parameter controlling the effective decay constant is unconstrained by tadpoles and can in principle lead to an arbitrarily large effective decay constant. However we show that these fluxes backreact on the fundamental decay constants so as to precisely cancel any enhancement leaving a sub-Planckian effective decay constant.String theory axions are interesting candidates for fields whose potential might be controllable over super-Planckian field ranges and therefore as possible candidates for inflatons in large field inflation.

        <p>From the perspective of Quantum Field Theory (QFT) large field inflation has a number of advantages over its small field counterpart: it can be realised by extremely simple potentials and requires no fine-tuning of an inflection point or the initial value of the field. However, as yet, no significant primordial tensor modes have been observed [1]. One possible explanation could be that the QFT perspective is misleading because there are Quantum Gravity (QG) constraints which actually obstruct this naively natural possibility, for example by limiting the available field range over which the potential can remain flat enough to be sub-Planckian. The question of the possible field excursion distances in an ultraviolet (UV) theory of gravity is one which has bearing on our understanding of current and future experimental results, through the connection to primordial tensor modes, while on the other hand requires a well-understood quantum theory of gravity to answer with significant detail and confidence.From the perspective of Quantum Field Theory (QFT) large field inflation has a number of advantages over its small field counterpart: it can be realised by extremely simple potentials and requires no fine-tuning of an inflection point or the initial value of the field.

        <p>A possible objection to large field inflation, or more generally to super-Planckian field displacements, from an effective QFT perspective is that one might expect an infinite number of operators controlled by powers of the field over the Planck scale to appear once UV gravitational physics has been integrated out. Such a situation would imply a breakdown of the effective theory for super-Planckian field values. An effective QFT answer to this could be that there is an additional symmetry in the theory which is respected by the UV physics and which controls these operators beyond their naive dimensional analysis. In turn, the objection to this is that QG is expected to not respect any global symmetries which could control operators in the theory. At this point it is not clear how to proceed JHEP08(2016)043 through general reasoning. Without knowing the UV theory we can not analyse the actual corrections from the UV physics, whether there is some symmetry that could control them and to what extent. One way to progress is to utilise general expectations of properties of QG, in particular along the lines of the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC), to restrict certain scenarios [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11]. Other approaches include an analysis of entropy bounds [12,13]. In this paper we will adopt the approach of considering string theory as a UV completion and explicitly study these questions in such a framework.A possible objection to large field inflation, or more generally to super-Planckian field displacements, from an effective QFT perspective is that one might expect an infinite number of operators controlled by powers of the field over the Planck scale to appear once UV gravitational physics has been integrated out.

        <p>Within the string theory context we are interested in closed-string fields as candidates for fields that can support super-Planckian excursions and therefore possibly large field inflation. Such fields arising from a string compactification split into two classes, there are moduli and there are axions. The two differ in a number of ways, perhaps the most important one being that axions do not appear perturbatively (as an expansion in the moduli vevs) in the Kahler potential due to a perturbative shift symmetry. Moduli fields have been considered as possible candidates for fields that could support super-Planckian excursions, see [14] for a review, [15] for early work and [16] for the most recent. However in doing so one faces two problems. The first is the generic one of controlling Planck scale suppressed operators since there is no UV symmetry to protect the moduli. The second problem is that the moduli values are also the parameters which control the effective theory such that their variation is bounded within a controlled effective theory. For too small moduli values there are large corrections to the effective theory, while for too large values the cut-off scale of the theory, for example the string or Kaluza-Klein scale, becomes low. The problem is amplified by the fact that closed-string moduli appear in the Kahler potential, and therefore in their own field space metric, in such a way that the canonically normalised fields are logarithmic in the moduli values. Therefore the displacement distance in the canonical field is exponentiated as a modulus variation which means one is fighting for control against an exponential. This may be possible if the coefficient in the exponent which multiplies the modulus could be controlled in some way, but it typically is only dependent on intersection numbers of the Calabi-Yau (CY) and such quantities rather than say a flux parameter. It is therefore difficult to ensure full control over super-Planckian field excursion in such a scenario, at least while keeping the cutoff scale of the theory sufficiently high, although we are not aware of a general proof against such a possibility.Within the string theory context we are interested in closed-string fields as candidates for fields that can support super-Planckian excursions and therefore possibly large field inflation.

        <p>Closed-string axions do not appear to suffer from these difficulties at first glance. Their vacuum expectation value (vev) is not a control parameter for the effective theory and since they do not appear in the perturbative Kahler potential their field space metric is also independent of their vev. Further they are protected by a perturbative shift symmetry which is broken to a non-perturbative discrete symmetry. These properties make them attractive candidates for fields that could support super-Planckian displacements within a fully controlled setting. On the other hand an analysis of possible axion periodicity lengths appears to suggest that a super-Planckian period for a fundamental string axion is not achievable, see [17] for the key original paper and [18] for the most recent analysis (while for example [19,20] study possible exceptions). One possibility for avoiding this limitation is to consider mixing two or more fundamental axions to get an effective super-Planckian axion decay constant for an aligned combination [21]. This possibility has been studied in JHEP08(2016)043 a string theory setting, see [14] for a review and [22][23][24][25][26][27][28] for recent work. Most relevant for the work in this paper is the analysis in [27] of type IIA compactifications. There it was shown that backreaction of the axion alignment parameter modified the metric on the axion field space so as to precisely cancel any enhancement of the axion periodicity. It was pointed out in [27] that in the case of more than two fundamental axions mixing, with an additional contribution to the superpotential to fix the additional combination, it is possible that this cancellation of the enhancement may be modified. In this work we will study such a more general possibility by considering compactifications of type IIA string theory on a twisted torus rather than a CY setting.Closed-string axions do not appear to suffer from these difficulties at first glance.

        <p>The primary focus of this work will be on a different idea for realising super-Planckian displacements with axions which is termed axion monodromy [29,30]. The basic idea behind it is to include effects in the vacuum which break the axion periodicity, for example a mass term, allowing it to traverse distances larger than a single period. For closed-string axions the effects which break the axion monodromy can be taken as branes, in IIA 6branes as in [45], within IIB 5-branes as in [30] and 7-branes as in [31], or as background fluxes. The fact that a background flux in string theory can induce a non-periodic potential for an otherwise periodic axion is a well known effect in flux compactifications, though it has only recently been applied in the context of large field inflation [32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44].

        <p>Both axion alignment and axion monodromy share the feature that they have some integer parameter N such that for N = 1 the field remains sub-Planckian and is then parametrically increased to super-Planckian values by dialing N large. The crucial effect which we focus on in this paper is the backreaction of the parameter N on the metric of the axion field space as it is dialed large. We focus on this as it is physics which has the right properties to form part of a censurship mechanism for large field displacements in string theory. The backreaction is gravitational physics and it interacts with the metric on the axion field space which determines the distance that the field travels. Further, while in QFT we are free to pick the field space metric as we like, typically it is considered to be a constant, in string theory it is a highly restricted and structured quantity. Ranging from coarse structures such as the universal logarithmic behaviour in the moduli of the Kahler potential signifying gravitational physics to fine details such as the structure of singularities on the field space which capture highly non-trivial non-perturbative quantum gravitational physics. Indeed the cancellation of N in the alignment scenarios found in [27] are examples of this general idea, and the form of the Kahler potential played a central role. If we let ourselves take the metric on the field space to be constant, or arbitrary, or neglect its dependence on N , this effect would not be captured.Both axion alignment and axion monodromy share the feature that they have some integer parameter N such that for N = 1 the field remains sub-Planckian and is then parametrically increased to super-Planckian values by dialing N large.

        <p>In the case of axion monodromy the parameter N is associated with the number of periods that the axion traverses. Its backreaction effect is therefore the backreaction of the energy density induced by the axion vev as it moves along its potential. For a sufficiently smooth and diluted flux background the backreaction of N is captured at leading order by its effect on the other moduli values. 1 We would like to study this effect and determineIn the case of axion monodromy the parameter N is associated with the number of periods that the axion traverses.

        <p>its influence on the possible axion excursion distance. Since we must be careful to account for any QG features of string theory that could affect this calculation we would like to use a framework which is as clean and simple as possible. We will therefore study this effect within the moduli stabilisation framework of type IIA flux compactifications on a CY manifold [48,49] or a twisted torus [50,51] (see [54] for a more complete reference list on these topics). In such a setting moduli stabilisation is a completely perturbative process which means we only need to utilise tree-level expressions for the Kahler potential and superpotential. Further it is simple enough to allow us to solve for the backreaction of N explicitly and precisely. Finally it is a setting for which the uplift to 10-dimensional supergravity solutions is well understood adding a further level of control. In this paper we will focus on the backreaction of the axion vev on its field space metric and thereby its excursion distance. There are a number of studies in the literature of the backreaction of axion vevs in axion monodromy scenarios within different settings which instead focus on the effect of flattening its potential or on the possible destabilisation of the vacuum. See for example [41,42,[55][56][57][58][59].

        <p>In this section we analyse models of flux-induced axion monodromy in type IIA string theory. There are two types of axions in compactifications of type IIA string theory on Calabi-Yau orientifolds. The Ramond-Ramond (RR) axions which pair up with the complex-structure moduli and the dilaton, and the Neveu-Schwarz (NS) axions which pair up with the Kahler moduli. Turning on RR fluxes induces a potential for the NS axions and vice-versa. They then become so-called monodromy axions, and the parameter N amounts to the number of times they traverse their period and so is measured by their vacuum expectation value. Therefore accounting for the effect of N on the field space metric amounts to calculating the backreaction on the moduli of the axion vev.In this section we analyse models of flux-induced axion monodromy in type IIA string theory.

        <p>Before entering into the calculation it is worthwhile to expand on the methodology we will utilise to study the backreaction and field range. If there is some constraint on field distances in string theory it is unclear what form it takes. The notion of a bound on a single field variation, tracing a line in scalar field space, is not well defined in the presence of multiple fields since a higher dimensional field space trivially supports an infinite length line. It may be that it is possible to formulate a constraint on the volume of field spaces, but in the absence of such a well defined formulation we adopt a different approach. Once we introduce a potential to the theory we can consider the dimensionality of the vacuum space of the theory. At the non-perturbative level one expects all fields to gain a potential which means that if the vacuum space is not empty then it is a collection of points.

The first is the lightest direction in field space. This is the identification we will use when studying axion alignment. It is possible to think of this as a theory where we integrate out all the heavier fields to obtain an effective field theory for a single field and see if our knowledge of the UV origin of this theory constrains the effective field range.still typically reduced from the dimensionality of the total field space.

        <p>The second possibility for identifying a single-field space is to consider dropping the requirement for one field to lie in the vacuum. So we displace by hand a single field from the vacuum and ask how far can this field go. This is the approach we will adopt for studying axion monodromy models, with the field away from the vacuum being the massive axion. This is quite a different setting to the previous one and we should not think of integrating out the other fields to obtain some effective theory for the field we are displacing. Rather they must be kept in the theory and we must adjust their values appropriately to track their minima as a function of the displaced field, this is the backreaction effect which we crucially want to capture. If the other fields are much more massive than the field which is displaced from the vacuum then they will not change much over the displacement, but this does not have to be imposed for the procedure to be well-defined. Note that it could be that after displacing the field far enough away from a stable vacuum we reach a point where the minima for the other fields disappear and they become unstable themselves. In this case the whole theory would undergo some phase transition to a different vacuum. We will show examples of such cases but they will not be of central interest for us, we will focus on the cases where the other fields have well defined, though continuously changing, minima.The second possibility for identifying a single-field space is to consider dropping the requirement for one field to lie in the vacuum.

        <p>There are two qualitative features of (2.9) to highlight. The most important feature is that the proper field distance is only logarithmic in the axion variation. This is the type of behaviour we expect from moduli fields and not axions. In this sense, once backreaction is accounted for, inducing a potential for an axion makes it behave like a modulus. The second important features is that the prefactor 0.7 is flux independent. Therefore there is no parameter to adjust in the model to make the field excursion large while keeping the logarithmic term small. While formally the field distance is unbounded, as discussed in the introduction it is not likely to be possible to obtain super-Planckian displacements in such a setting. Indeed it is precisely this logarithmic behaviour of moduli which we attempted to avoid by working with axions since an exponentially large variation of the moduli is difficult to support in an effective theory which is under control.

        <p>When we solve for the moduli in terms of ρ and the fluxes, only the ρ field carries weight under this symmetry and therefore s and u must be proportional to it. This argument is sufficient to establish the behaviour (2.9) up to a constant of proportionality factor. Now consider a general CY compactification with an arbitrary number of moduli. The system still satisfies the symmetry (2.10) with an equal scaling of all the moduli because of the logarithmic behaviour of the Kahler potential.

        <p>1 + q 3 they converge to (2.8). The first thing to observe is therefore that by taking large fluxes we can delay the onset of the scaling behaviour (2.8) arbitrarily far in ρ distance. The fluxes therefore act to shield the moduli from the axion vev backreaction. However, even though the variation in ρ can be extended parametrically far through this method we can see that this will not imply an arbitrarily far proper field distance. The rough argument is that if we assume that the moduli which control the axion field space metric, s and u, remains approximately constant up to ρ ∼ ρ crit then since at ρ crit their values go like s ∼ ρ crit this will be their approximate value over the regime of small ρ.

We will study a simpler version of this model where we restrict the complex structure and Kahler moduli to a single variation, ie. take one representative in each class. The key addition to the models of section 2.1.1 is an additional superpotential interaction which couples the dilaton and complex-structure moduli to the Kahler moduli. Due to this interaction both the RR axions gain a mass for generic fluxes. We will therefore restrict the fluxes further such that only one combination of the RR axions gains a (perturbative) mass while the other remains massless.

In this section we consider a different direction in field space away from the minima where we displace a massive combination of Neveu-Schwarz (NS) axions. Unlike the RR axions, where there is only a single combination which is perturbatively massive, generically all the NS axions will gain a mass from the fluxes in the compactification. There is therefore no distinguished direction in the NS axions field space to displace along with the exception of the case where all the moduli and axions are set to equal values and the displacement is then along this universal value. In this section we will study this case which is also the simplest setting.

        <p>As before, any further excursion will add only logarithmic corrections to those values. With regards to the stability analysis of the potential. Moving away from the turning points at v = ρ = 0 discussed in section 2.1.1, an analysis of the Hessian matrix with respect to the other directions shows that despite one of the eigenvalues picking up a negative sign for some values of v , it always lies above the BF bound. This stability holds for both branches, as well as both signs of f . Moreover plugging back the fields satisfying (2.44) in the potential such that it only depends on v and the flux numbers, this JHEP08(2016)043 expression has a local minimum at v = 0 for both signs of f in branch 2. For branch 1, it has a global minimum for positive f and local maximum for negative f . Finally we also studied excursions along the NS axions in the twisted torus setting of section 2.1.3.

        <p>In the previous section we studied the backreaction of the axion vev on the axion field-space metric in an axion monodromy scenario. In this section we consider an axion alignment scenario, as in [21] but where the alignment is induced through fluxes [24,27]. From a field theory approach, where we can choose the axion field space metric freely, such a setup leads to an effective super-Planckian decay constant for the axions combination which remains massless after the mixing. In [27] an analysis of this scenario in type IIA string theory concluded that, for all the classes of CY spaces studied, the large parameter N responsible for the mixing backreacts on the axion periods in such a way as to censure this super-Planckian enhancement. It was found that this occurs in two qualitatively different ways depending on the structure of the Kahler potential for the geometric moduli. For 'toroidallike' Kahler potentials it was shown that there is a scaling of the fundamental axion decay constants in such a way as to cancel any enhancement of the effective axion decay constant.In the previous section we studied the backreaction of the axion vev on the axion field-space metric in an axion monodromy scenario.

Some analysis of three axions mixing was performed and there it was shown that while for type IIA CY compactifications this does not lead to an effective super-Planckian decay constant, in principle if the superpotential was modified such that there was a new mass term to fix certain axion combinations then the possibility of super-Planckian enhancement was not ruled out. It was suggested that such an additional superpotential contribution could arise in type IIB compactifications on a CY or in type IIA compactifications on a twisted torus (or more generally a manifold with torsion).

        <p>In this paper we studied axion monodromy scenarios in flux compactifications of type IIA string theory on CY manifolds and a twisted torus. In particular we calculated the effect that the backreaction of the axion vev has on the proper length in field space traversed by the axion. We found universal behaviour in all the settings studied where the backreaction is small up to some critical axion value. After this critical point the backreaction is strong and cuts off the proper field distance so that it increases at best logarithmically with the axion vev, with a proportionality factor between the proper field distance and the logarithm which is flux independent. The critical axion value can be made arbitrarily large through flux choices thereby allowing for arbitrarily large changes in the axion vev, however the backreaction of the flux on the axion field space metric implies an exact cancellation of the fluxes in the proper distance traversed by the axion up to its critical value such that the result is flux independent and sub-Planckian.In this paper we studied axion monodromy scenarios in flux compactifications of type IIA string theory on CY manifolds and a twisted torus.

        <p>In more detail, we first studied the case where the monodromy axion is the single linear combination of RR axions which appears in the superpotential. Our starting point was the simplified model studied in [27] where the moduli are restricted to only one variation in each sector and some of the fluxes are turned off. In this model the axion vev backreacts strongly and the proper field length is only logarithmic in the axion vev. We argued that this can be attributed to a scaling symmetry of the fields, and in particular using this symmetry showed that the logarithmic behaviour holds for any CY compactification, as long as the fluxes which were turned off remain so. Next we considered turning the remaining fluxes, which carried dimensions under the scaling symmetry and therefore served as order parameters for its breaking, back on. We showed that in this case, for the single variation simplified models, the logarithmic strong backreaction behaviour can be delayed arbitrarily far in the axion value by breaking the scaling symmetry arbitrarily strongly using the fluxes. However the same fluxes which shielded the moduli from the strong axion backreaction in turn backreacted themselves on the axion field space metric such that a precise cancellation occurred and the proper field distance up to the axion critical value was flux independent. We then generalised these results to the case of multiple complex-structure moduli and JHEP08(2016)043 studied example CY Kahler potentials. We showed that in this case the system becomes more complicated and in particular depends on two combinations of flux parameters (rather than one parameter for the single modulus case). However the fluxes again canceled out in the proper field distance up to the critical value. Finally we studied compactifications on a twisted torus which in particular introduces new interactions in the superpotential. This setup can be reduced to a two flux parameters system. Solving for the backreacted moduli behaviour as a function of the axion vev numerically we showed that they take the form of an approximately constant region bounded by linear regimes for axion vev beyond some critical value. By scanning over flux parameters we showed that the proper field distance up to the critical axion value is again flux independent. After this we turned to excursion distances for NS axions and showed that they have the same qualitative behaviour as the RR axions described above.In more detail, we first studied the case where the monodromy axion is the single linear combination of RR axions which appears in the superpotential.

        <p>The cancellation of the flux parameters in the result for the proper length in field space traversed by the axion in the axion monodromy scenarios and the cancellation of the fluxes in the effective decay constant in the axion alignment scenarios (as studied in more detail in [27]) are strikingly similar physics. Indeed we showed that the two can be naturally related by zooming into the origin of the large effective axion period in an axion alignment scenario where the potential looks approximately quadratic rather than sinusoidal and therefore is similar to an axion monodromy scenario. On top of the quadratic potential there are oscillations from the sub-leading instanton and after N such periods we reach a critical axion value. In the alignment scenario this is where the quadratic approximation breaks down and the periodic nature of the system kicks in to censure the excursion distance, in the monodromy setting at the same axion value instead the strong backreaction kicks in and serves as the cutoff mechanism. In both cases although there are N oscillations before the cutoff mechanism the oscillation period scales as 1 N thereby ensuring a cancellation in the proper excursion length.The cancellation of the flux parameters in the result for the proper length in field space traversed by the axion in the axion monodromy scenarios and the cancellation of the fluxes in the effective decay constant in the axion alignment scenarios (as studied in more detail in [27]) are strikingly similar physics.

        <p>The results of this work uncover new mechanisms in string theory which censure super-Planckian axion excursions in axion monodromy and axion alignment scenarios. We did so in the specific type IIA setting because it is the simplest and best understood framework to calculate such effects since full moduli stabilisation can be realised by using only tree-level expressions for the Kahler potential and superpotential. However it is not unreasonable to expect that the mechanisms which operated in our settings could do so also in other string theory setups. In particular it would be interesting to study how the axion vev backreaction in axion monodromy scenarios affects its proper field distance in other string theory constructions and work towards a general understanding of this effect. In particular JHEP08(2016)043 the work presented in [63] and [34] suggests possible scenarios where a different type of shielding from axion backreaction to the one studied in this paper is realised and it would be interesting to see if similar effects to those observed in our work manifest in those settings when realised in explicit compactifications.The results of this work uncover new mechanisms in string theory which censure super-Planckian axion excursions in axion monodromy and axion alignment scenarios.

        <p>The fact that in all the cases studied we find that the growth rate of the proper field distance of the axion excursion beyond some critical point is at best logarithmic in the axion vev matches the general conjecture made within the swampland context of a maximum logarithmic growth for any field at field values asymptoting to infinity [64]. The non-trivial cancellation of the fluxes in the proper field distance before the logarithmic behaviour kicks in lends some weight to a sharpened swampland conjecture. At least at the same evidence level of the original conjecture, as well as conjecturing that the growth rate of the proper distance is at best logarithmic in a field for field values asymptoting to infinity, we could conjecture that this logarithmic growth rate must set in at a sub-Planckian proper path distance. 10 The scenarios studied in this work present non-trivial tests of such a sharpened statement.The fact that in all the cases studied we find that the growth rate of the proper field distance of the axion excursion beyond some critical point is at best logarithmic in the axion vev matches the general conjecture made within the swampland context of a maximum logarithmic growth for any field at field values asymptoting to infinity [64].

The latter option leads to the effect that the axion decay constants scale with the flux precisely in such a way to cancel the possible enhancement of an effective decay constant since the latter scales as f eff,1 ∼ q 1 fu 2 q 2 [27].

        <p>Now it is important that W 1 and W 2 are not just linearly added so that they fix two combinations of axions. To illustrate the result we can take q 1 = -q 2 = q and q1 = q2 = 1 in which case we find from a similar analysis of the F-term ratiosNow it is important that W 1 and W 2 are not just linearly added so that they fix two combinations of axions.

        <p>Now taking q 3 large does not imply a scaling of the axion decay constants to cancel it, indeed it is compatible with having f u 1 ∼ f u 2 and free in magnitude. The conclusion is that for more than two fundamental axions mixing the single constraint on the moduli values coming from the ratio of the F-terms is not sufficient to show that no super-Planckian enhancement is possible. Therefore if such a constraint emerges it must do so from a more detailed analysis of moduli stabilisation.Now taking q 3 large does not imply a scaling of the axion decay constants to cancel it, indeed it is compatible with having f u 1 ∼ f u 2 and free in magnitude.

        <p>In the previous subsection we showed that for more than two axions mixing any obstruction from flux backreaction to an enhanced effective decay constant must manifest through a more detailed analysis of moduli stabilisation, in this section we perform such an analysis JHEP08(2016)043In the previous subsection we showed that for more than two axions mixing any obstruction from flux backreaction to an enhanced effective decay constant must manifest through a more detailed analysis of moduli stabilisation, in this section we perform such an analysis JHEP08(2016)043</p>
        <p>Now for constant values of the moduli we can induce a parameterically large effective axion decay constant by taking any of {a, b 1 , b 2 , b 3 } large. In the case of two fundamental axions mixing we could show an obstruction to this by using the vanishing F-term combination associated to the massless axion.

        <p>If we restrict this to only two axions we obtain the familiar relation between ratios of decay constants and this leads to the usual cancellation [27]. However in this more general case this particular formulation of the obstruction is absent.If we restrict this to only two axions we obtain the familiar relation between ratios of decay constants and this leads to the usual cancellation [27].

        <p>The parameters which we need to dial up to enhance the axion decay constant are a and the b i . In the case of a CY compactification [27] these were restricted by the tadpole constraints.

        <p>This shows that an obstruction to arbitrarily large axion alignment need not arise from the tadpole constraints. Apart from allowing for arbitrarily large alignment parameters the flux restriction (3.26) is also special in terms of uplifting the four-dimensional vacuum to a ten-dimensional one. The tadpoles are topological charge cancellation conditions where in general flux contributions can cancel against localised sources. However they originate as the integration of the ten-dimensional Bianchi identity which is instead a local equation.This shows that an obstruction to arbitrarily large axion alignment need not arise from the tadpole constraints.
