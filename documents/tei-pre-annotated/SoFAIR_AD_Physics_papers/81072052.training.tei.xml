        <p>With their high beam energy and intensity, existing and near-future proton beam dumps provide an excellent opportunity to search for new very weakly coupled particles in the MeV to GeV mass range. One particularly interesting example is a so-called axion-like particle (ALP), i.e. a pseudoscalar coupled to two photons. The challenge in proton beam dumps is to reliably calculate the production of the new particles from the interactions of two composite objects, the proton and the target atoms. In this work we argue that Primakoff production of ALPs proceeds in a momentum range where production rates and angular distributions can be determined to sufficient precision using simple electromagnetic form factors. Reanalysing past proton beam dump experiments for this production channel, we derive novel constraints on the parameter space for ALPs. We show that the NA62 experiment at CERN could probe unexplored parameter space by running in 'dump mode' for a few days and discuss opportunities for future experiments such as SHiP.With their high beam energy and intensity, existing and near-future proton beam dumps provide an excellent opportunity to search for new very weakly coupled particles in the MeV to GeV mass range.

        <p>Over the last few years Nature has been quite reluctant to reveal its secrets beyond the Standard Model -certainly not for a lack of trying on our side. While the second run of the LHC still promises significant discovery potential, it also seems sensible to carefully examine our search strategy and look for potential places we have missed as well as for new opportunities that can be explored in parallel. In this endeavour it is only prudent that we first look at technologies and apparatuses that are already at our disposal and then turn to more ambitious future projects.Over the last few years Nature has been quite reluctant to reveal its secrets beyond the Standard Model -certainly not for a lack of trying on our side.

        <p>In this note we want to discuss an explicit and particularly promising example of this strategy: we will show that without major modifications an existing proton fixed target experiment, NA62 [1] at the CERN SPS, offers discovery potential for axion-like particles (ALPs) in the MeV to GeV range and can be competitive with existing experiments in a rather short run-time. A proposed dedicated search at the SPS, SHiP [2,3], could then probe even deeper into untested parameter space.In this note we want to discuss an explicit and particularly promising example of this strategy: we will show that without major modifications an existing proton fixed target experiment, NA62 [1] at the CERN SPS, offers discovery potential for axion-like particles (ALPs) in the MeV to GeV range and can be competitive with existing experiments in a rather short run-time.

        <p>Fixed target experiments are particularly useful to search for new weakly coupled particles in the MeV to GeV range [4][5][6][7], because they nicely combine a sufficiently energetic JHEP02(2016)018 reaction to produce particles in this mass regime with a sufficiently high reaction rate to probe small couplings. The two most common types of beams are electron and proton beams. Indeed some of the best current limits on axion-like particles in the MeV to GeV mass range originate from electron beam fixed-target experiments [4,[8][9][10] as well as electron-positron colliders [11]. As demonstrated in [5,12,13], another promising option are proton fixed-target experiments, in particular those making use of the high intensity of 400 GeV protons from the SPS at CERN. It is therefore a worthwhile task to determine the sensitivity of existing experiments, such as the NA62 experiment, as well as proposed experiments especially optimised for the search of long-lived neutral particles, such as SHiP.Fixed target experiments are particularly useful to search for new weakly coupled particles in the MeV to GeV range [4][5][6][7], because they nicely combine a sufficiently energetic JHEP02(2016)018 reaction to produce particles in this mass regime with a sufficiently high reaction rate to probe small couplings.

        <p>To fully exploit these experiments for the search of axion-like particles one needs a reliable calculation of the production rates and angular distributions. Due to the composite nature of both the proton and the nucleus this seems particularly challenging. However, we argue that for a high-energy proton beam one can reliably calculate the cross section for the fusion of two photons into one ALP (so-called Primakoff production [14]) for ALPs in the interesting MeV to GeV mass range using simple atomic form factors. The reason for this is as follows: both the proton and the nucleus are surrounded by the virtual photons that make up the usual electric field of a charged particle. Due to the highly relativistic nature of the incoming protons, the photons from the proton now 'see' the photons from the nucleus as highly blue shifted, thereby being able to provide more energy/momentum. This effect allows to create relatively massive ALPs from photons that, in the rest frame of the proton/nucleus, are too soft to be affected by the sub-structure of the proton/nucleus. In other words, the momentum transfer in the respective rest frames is sufficiently small that we can use simple electromagnetic form factors to describe the photon interactions.To fully exploit these experiments for the search of axion-like particles one needs a reliable calculation of the production rates and angular distributions.

        <p>At the same time, for the masses of interest to us, the typical photons from the nucleus have sufficient momentum to be essentially unaffected by the shielding from the electron shell, leading to an enhancement of the cross section proportional to the square of the nucleus charge. Coherent Primakoff production in this Goldilocks zone can therefore dominate over incoherent production processes and lead to detectable signals in present and near-future experiments for a significant range of ALP parameter space that is not yet explored. Crucially, it is possible for us to reliably calculate not only the production rate, but also angular distributions, which are particularly important to obtain a realistic calculation of the geometric acceptances that determine the sensitivity of a real experiment. This paper is structured as follows. In section 2 we review the nature of and motivation for ALPs and for searches in the low-energy/high-intensity regime. In section 3 we then provide a detailed calculation of the Primakoff production of ALPs from high energy protons impinging on a fixed target, paying particular attention to the angular distributions.

        <p>2 A brief review and motivation of ALPs Progress in particle physics has been guided by the paradigm of renormalizable interactions with O(1) dimensionless couplings. This paradigm suggests that any new particle to be discovered should be heavy and reveal its presence either directly in high-energy colliders or indirectly by mediating higher-dimensional interactions, which could then be probed in precision measurements such as muon g -2 experiments or flavour experiments. It has however become increasingly clear that there are other options. Even light particles could still remain to be discovered, provided they have sufficiently small interactions with Standard Model (SM) particles, and therefore with our experiments.2 A brief review and motivation of ALPs Progress in particle physics has been guided by the paradigm of renormalizable interactions with O(1) dimensionless couplings.

        <p>A given experiment will be most sensitive to ALPs with a decay length comparable to the distance L between target and the detector. Particles with shorter decay length are likely to decay before they reach the decay volume and the decay products will be absorbed.

        <p>Proton beam dumps can produce ALPs via coherent scattering (i.e. elastic scattering of the entire proton on the nucleus in the target), incoherent scattering (i.e. scattering of individual quarks or gluons from the proton and/or the nucleus) and non-perturbative processes (e.g. in the decay of hadronic resonances). The best example for coherent scattering is the Primakoff process shown in figure 2. As we will see, in contrast to incoherent scattering and non-perturbative processes, the Primakoff process remains perturbative at low energies and is not affected by hadronic uncertainties, so that predictions can be calculated with good accuracy. Moreover, the Primakoff process is particularly interesting for beam dump experiments for the following reasons:Proton beam dumps can produce ALPs via coherent scattering (i.e. elastic scattering of the entire proton on the nucleus in the target), incoherent scattering (i.e. scattering of individual quarks or gluons from the proton and/or the nucleus) and non-perturbative processes (e.g. in the decay of hadronic resonances).

        <p>1. The cross section for coherent scattering is typically proportional to the square of the charge of the target nucleus, Z 2 , while incoherent scattering and non-perturbative processes are roughly proportional to the mass number of the target nucleus, A. For heavy target materials, such as lead or tungsten, this can lead to a very significant enhancement of the rate of ALP production. But even for medium-weight target materials like copper, iron or molybdenum Primakoff production is still competitive with other production mechanisms [5].1.

The typical momentum transfer in coherent scattering is small, such that the ALPs produced via the Primakoff process typically have very small transverse momenta (i.e. momenta perpendicular to the direction of the beam). As a result, cross sections are very strongly peaked in the forward direction, such that even a relatively small detector far away from the target can have a large geometric acceptance. This makes it possible to use the Primakoff process to search for ALPs with very large decay length.2.

        <p>Primakoff production is therefore not only the theoretically cleanest production mode, but can be expected to give the dominant contribution for ALPs that do not directly couple to quarks. 4 In the present work we will therefore focus on this production mechanism. The Primakoff process can be studied in two different ways. In the laboratory frame, where the target nucleus is at rest, it makes sense to calculate the equivalent photon spectrum for the proton beam and then consider the process γ + N → a + N , i. the probability for the photon to emit an ALP before being absorbed by the nucleus. In the centre-of-mass frame, on the other hand, both the proton and the target nucleus are moving, so one can calculate the equivalent photon spectrum for each and then consider the photon-fusion process γ + γ → a. The former approach was considered previously in [4] for the analysis of electron beam dumps, the latter approach was employed by [5] for a proton beam dump experiment.Primakoff production is therefore not only the theoretically cleanest production mode, but can be expected to give the dominant contribution for ALPs that do not directly couple to quarks. 4 In the present work we will therefore focus on this production mechanism.

        <p>Of course, both approaches are physically equivalent and should lead to identical predictions for the ALP production cross section and distribution. However, as we will discuss in detail below, in order to accurately predict the angular distribution of the ALPs produced in the beam dump, it is essential to properly take into account the transverse momentum of the virtual photons (see e.g. [23,24]). These transverse momenta have been neglected entirely in [5], whereas in [4] only the virtual photon connected to the target nucleus is allowed to have non-zero transverse momentum. 5 We therefore revisit both approaches, carefully taking into account all transverse momenta, and derive the angular distribution for ALPs produced in proton beam dumps.Of course, both approaches are physically equivalent and should lead to identical predictions for the ALP production cross section and distribution.

        <p>The equivalent photon approximation (EPA), also known as the Weizsäcker-Williams approximation, provides a convenient framework for studying processes involving photons emitted from fast-moving charges. The basic idea is to replace the charged particle(s) in the initial state by photons following a distribution γ(ω, q t ) and then consider directly the interactions of these photons. Since the transverse momentum q t of the photons is typically very small, it is common in the literature to integrate the distribution γ(ω, q t ) over q t and consider only the energy distribution γ(ω), assuming that all photons travel in the same direction as the charged particle they originated from. 6 For our purposes, however, it will be crucial to accurately predict angular distribution down to very small scattering angles, so that we need to include the distribution of transverse momenta. Our discussion follows ref. [26] (see ref. [27] for a recent review).The equivalent photon approximation (EPA), also known as the Weizsäcker-Williams approximation, provides a convenient framework for studying processes involving photons emitted from fast-moving charges.

        <p>For scattering on neutral atoms one furthermore needs to take into account screening of the nuclear charge by electrons. These screening effects will become important for small q 2 , implying that one has to consider the electromagnetic form factor of the entire atom rather than the one of the nucleus. In principle, it is straight-forward to extract the atomic form factor at smaller momentum transfer from measurements (see e.g. [29]). At energies above the K-shell threshold we do not expect large deviations from D(q 2 ) = Z 2 , but even for smaller energies the deviations may be relatively small. Comparing to experimentally measured form factors in the literature [30], we conclude that for molybdenum it is a good approximation to take D(q 2 ) = Z 2 for q &gt; 20 keV, while for copper and iron D(q 2 ) = Z 2 holds for q &gt; 10 keV. For smaller momenta we set the form factor equal to zero, which has a negligible effect on the predicted cross section.For scattering on neutral atoms one furthermore needs to take into account screening of the nuclear charge by electrons. These screening effects will become important for small q 2 , implying that one has to consider the electromagnetic form factor of the entire atom rather than the one of the nucleus.

        <p>To conclude this section, let us comment on the ALP angular distribution. First of all, we emphasise that in figure 3 we show d 2 σ pN /dE a dθ = sin θ d 2 σ pN /dE a d cos θ, in order to reflect the larger solid angle at larger values of θ. We find that (for a beam energy of 400 GeV) this distribution peaks at around 20 mrad, implying that an ideal detector should aim to cover this angle in order to capture the majority of the ALPs produced in the target. For comparison, we show d 2 σ pN /dE a d cos θ in figure 4, which remains finite for θ → 0. However, we observe that -at least for small ALP masses -even this distribution peaks at non-zero θ. The reason is that, as can be seen from eq. (3.2), a photon with energy ω = x E beam has a typical transverse momentum of order q t ∼ x m p and hence a typical angle of q t /ω = m p /E beam . For a beam energy of 400 GeV the maximum is therefore found around θ ∼ 2.5 mrad. 7To conclude this section, let us comment on the ALP angular distribution.

        <p>Having calculated the rate and distribution of ALPs produced in the beam dump, we now proceed to calculating the probability that these ALPs lead to an observable signal in a given experiment. As the typical experimental set-up we assume that the target is immediately followed by an absorber of length D and a decay volume of length L. At the far end of the decay volume there is a photon detector, which we take to be cylindrically symmetric with radius R, such that it covers an angle θ max ≈ R/(D+L) from the interaction point. A concrete example of such an experiment is NA62, which is shown in figure 5 and discussed in detail in section 6.Having calculated the rate and distribution of ALPs produced in the beam dump, we now proceed to calculating the probability that these ALPs lead to an observable signal in a given experiment.

If the ALP lifetime is short compared to the length of the decay volume, such that most ALPs will decay at the beginning of the decay volume, the typical separation of the two photons at the position of the detector will hence be d γγ = α min L = 2L/γ. This consideration enables us to constrain the acceptance as a function of the boost factor γ. Clearly, it is a necessary requirement that d γγ &lt; d max ≡ 2 R. Consequently, we conclude p(γ &lt; L/R) = 0. If θ is significantly different from zero, even larger boost factors will be required in order for both photons to reach the detector.

        <p>The fixed-target experiment NA62 at the CERN SPS aims to measure the K + → π + ν ν branching ratio at the 10 % level within the next few years and is currently taking data. As π 0 s constitute a major background for this measurement, overall hermetic detection of photons is crucial. Consequently, NA62 could be adapted to search for ALPs decaying to two photons, and we will elaborate on this possibility.The fixed-target experiment NA62 at the CERN SPS aims to measure the K + → π + ν ν branching ratio at the 10 % level within the next few years and is currently taking data.

        <p>The NA62 experiment uses 400 GeV protons from the SPS impinging on a beryllium target. The positively charged hadron beam of 75 GeV is then selected via an achromat: only the wanted momentum component can pass through a set of apertures within the so-called 'Target Attenuator eXperimental areas' (TAXes)', see Chapter 2.1.2 of [1]. The particles passing the apertures are then guided by magnetic elements to the decay volume downstream, cf. figure 5 and [1] for details on the detector.The NA62 experiment uses 400 GeV protons from the SPS impinging on a beryllium target.

        <p>Technically, this is possible by 'closing' the two TAXes, which are approximately 25 m behind the target. This means that the TAXes are positioned such that no free aperture is being made available for main beam and all secondaries. In this way, almost only muons and neutrinos are able to reach the decay volume (both TAXes are approximately 1.6 m thick).Technically, this is possible by 'closing' the two TAXes, which are approximately 25 m behind the target.

        <p>As mentioned above, an excellent photon vetoing is crucial for the main physics goal of NA62. For our estimate, we conservatively assume usage of the Liquid Krypton Calorimeter (LKr) for photon detection only. The LKr was previously used in NA48 and is described in detail in [37]. A hole in the centre of the calorimeter hosts the vacuum tube for the beam (8 cm radius) and the calorimeter itself is segmented in the transverse plane into cells of approximately 2 cm by 2 cm. Additional calorimeters (IRC, SAC) are installed to cover the calorimeter hole, but as we will see below the presence of the LKr calorimeter hole has little influence on the ALP acceptance.As mentioned above, an excellent photon vetoing is crucial for the main physics goal of NA62.

        <p>Let r 1,2 be the two-vectors of the two photons on the calorimeter plane and r 1,2 be their radial distance with respect to the beam axis. Then, to summarize, the photons are required to be 1. within the calorimeter, thus r 1,2 &lt; R = 113 cm; Note that the transverse shape of the LKr calorimeter is octagonal.

        <p>With the requirements above implemented, we can obtain a realistic estimate of the detection probability p(l a , θ, γ) (an explicit dependence on m a and g aγ only arises after folding the acceptance with the production cross-section). While it would be possible to consider photon losses in the spectrometer or Ring Imaging Cherenchov detector as well as detection efficiencies smaller than unity, we expect these effects to be small and therefore do not include them in our Monte-Carlo simulation. Figure 6 shows the resulting detection probability as a function of the ALP angle and its boost factor for different values of the decay length. The largest acceptances are found for off-angle ALPs and l a ∼ D + L, θ ∼ 0.0025 and γ ∼ 10 3 and can reach up to 25%. 10 In fact, both TAXes are equipped with two holed inserts (the apertures for the appropriate component of the secondaries) and one 40 mm diameter solid tungsten insert, respectively. Impinging on the full tungsten insert would be obviously be even more favourable than impinging on copper. The solid tungsten insert would be large enough in diameter to absorb the full proton beam (which is of a couple of mm in transverse size). However the implemented range of movement for the TAXes does not allow to impinge on the tungsten of the first TAX directly. Doing so would require modifications in the target area and we do not consider this situation further. We also emphasise that, even in the configuration with the target in place, a sizable fraction (∼40 %) of the protons go through the target without interacting and eventually impinge on the copper of the TAX. In the left panel of figure 6, where the condition l a L is satisfied, we also show for comparison the estimate for the acceptance region derived in section 6. We find good agreement between our simple estimate and the results of the more detailed Monte-Carlo simulation. However, for longer decay lengths, as considered in the right panel, the acceptance region becomes much larger than predicted by our estimate, because a significant fraction of the ALPs decays closer to the detector. In addition to the features discussed in section 4 one can observe a loss of sensitivity for θ ≈ 0 and very large boost factors due to one or both photons being lost in the calorimeter hole. In agreement with expectations, this effect becomes relevant if both θ and α min /2 are small compared to R min /L, implying θ &lt; 0.0011 and γ &gt; 900. Since the ALP production cross section is very small for θ 10 -3 (see figure 3), the presence of the calorimeter hole does not significantly affect the sensitivity of NA62 to ALPs.With the requirements above implemented, we can obtain a realistic estimate of the detection probability p(l a , θ, γ) (an explicit dependence on m a and g aγ only arises after folding the acceptance with the production cross-section).

        <p>In fact, the angular distribution of ALPs produced via the Primakoff process peaks at somewhat larger angles and smaller boost factors than what can be detected by the NA62 detector, implying that an ideal detector should be somewhat larger and closer to the target. Nevertheless, high-energy ALPs are typically emitted with very small angle θ, such that they match the acceptance window of the NA62 experiment. We show in figure 7 the fiducial cross section defined in eq. (4.6). While the left panel shows a typical distribution as obtained in large regions of parameter space, the right panel corresponds to ALPs with a rather short lifetime, such that only particles produced with very large boost factor reach the decay volume.In fact, the angular distribution of ALPs produced via the Primakoff process peaks at somewhat larger angles and smaller boost factors than what can be detected by the NA62 detector, implying that an ideal detector should be somewhat larger and closer to the target.

        <p>To calculate the predicted number of events in NA62, we take as nominal intensity 1012 protons per effective second on target. The effective flat top of the proton spill is approximately 3 seconds, 2 times every super-cycle of 42 seconds, thus we have to multiply by an effective factor of 0.15.

        <p>While NA62 offers a unique opportunity to probe unexplored parameter space with an existing experiment, there are various ways in which to further improve the sensitivity of future experiments. As discussed above, the production rate is enhanced by a factor Z 2 /A 0.77 for heavy elements in the target. Furthermore, a shorter distance between the target and the beginning of the decay volume would allow to probe ALPs with shorter lifetimes, corresponding to larger couplings. Placing the detector closer to the target has the additional advantage that it is possible to cover somewhat larger ALP production angles and make use of the fact that the differential cross section typically peaks at around θ = 10 mrad.While NA62 offers a unique opportunity to probe unexplored parameter space with an existing experiment, there are various ways in which to further improve the sensitivity of future experiments.

        <p>All of these potential improvements have been incorporated in the SHiP proposal [2], which aims to search for a variety of weakly-coupled low-mass states with very high intensity beams [3].

        <p>Importantly, we have provided predictions for the angular distribution of the ALPproduction cross-section: although transversal momenta of the produced ALPs are typically small, the detector in a beam dump experiment is placed far away from the target and therefore covers only a tiny angle from the production point. A precise determination of the expected spatial distribution for ALP-induced events and an accurate estimate of the geometric acceptance is therefore mandatory in preparing and analysing a real experimental run. Taking all these effects into account, we have shown that even with a rather modest beam-time requirement, the currently operating NA62 experiment would have a sizeable discovery potential for ALPs in the mass range of ∼ (30 -200)MeV. The proposed facility SHiP could extend this reach over the course of its running period up to masses of 1 GeV.Importantly, we have provided predictions for the angular distribution of the ALPproduction cross-section: although transversal momenta of the produced ALPs are typically small, the detector in a beam dump experiment is placed far away from the target and therefore covers only a tiny angle from the production point.

        <p>In the present work we have focussed on pseudoscalar ALPs that couple dominantly to photons. It is however straight-forward to generalise our results to scalar ALPs as well as ALPs with additional couplings to fermions as follows:In the present work we have focussed on pseudoscalar ALPs that couple dominantly to photons.

        <p>• Writing the coupling between scalar ALPs and photons as gaγ 2 a F µν F µν , we obtain identical expressions for the ALP lifetime and the ALP production cross sections as for the case of the pseudoscalar.

        <p>• Even for ALPs with relatively large (derivative) couplings to fermions, the decay into photons will typically give the dominant contribution to the ALP decay length for 100 MeV m a 2 m µ [22], which is the region of interest for NA62. For larger ALP masses, as potentially testable at SHiP, decays into muons (and, for scalar ALPs, mesons) can significantly reduce the ALP decay length and hence suppress event rates.• Even for ALPs with relatively large (derivative) couplings to fermions, the decay into photons will typically give the dominant contribution to the ALP decay length for 100 MeV m a 2 m µ [22], which is the region of interest for NA62.
