        <p>The thermalization of isolated quantum many-body systems is deeply related to fundamental questions of quantum information theory. While integrable or many-body localized systems display non-ergodic behavior due to extensively many conserved quantities, recent theoretical studies have identified a rich variety of more exotic phenomena in between these two extreme limits. The tilted one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model, which is readily accessible in experiments with ultracold atoms, emerged as an intriguing playground to study nonergodic behavior in a clean disorder-free system. While non-ergodic behavior was established theoretically in certain limiting cases, there is no complete understanding of the complex thermalization properties of this model. In this work, we experimentally study the relaxation of an initial charge-density wave and find a remarkably long-lived initial-state memory over a wide range of parameters. Our observations are well reproduced by numerical simulations of a clean system. Using analytical calculations we further provide a detailed microscopic understanding of this behavior, which can be attributed to emergent kinetic constraints.The thermalization of isolated quantum many-body systems is deeply related to fundamental questions of quantum information theory.

        <p>In between the two extreme limits of ergodic and localizing dynamics there exists a rich variety of more complex thermalizing behavior. Models with many-body scar states, e.g., host a vanishing fraction of non-thermal eigenstates embedded within an otherwise thermal spectrum [11][12][13][14][15][16] . They exhibit a weak form of ergodicity-breaking, that strongly depends on the initial state, as has been observed with Rydberg atoms 14,17,18 . More recently, a whole new class of models has been suggested, where the presence of only few conserved quantities, in particular dipole conservation, results in non-ergodic dynamics due to an emergent fragmentation of the Hilbert space into exponentially many disconnected subspaces [19][20][21][22] . Fragmented models offer an alternative view on a central open question, namely if many-body localization can occur in translationally-invariant models without disorder [23][24][25][26][27][28][29] .In between the two extreme limits of ergodic and localizing dynamics there exists a rich variety of more complex thermalizing behavior.

        <p>In this work, we study non-ergodic behavior in the disorderfree tilted one-dimensional (1D) Fermi-Hubbard model (Fig. 1a), which lies at the interface of MBL and Hilbert-space fragmentation. In the presence of additional weak disorder or harmonic confinement, theoretical studies have found characteristic MBL phenomenology, known as Stark MBL [30][31][32][33][34] . This, however, does not hold for a clean system with pure linear potential 30,33 . While conventional MBL predicts localization for any typical initial state, we do not expect this to hold for our system, where resonances can occur between interaction and tilt energies (regime ① in Fig. 1b). Intriguingly, it has been predicted, that in the limit of large tilts, Δ ≫ J, |U|, non-ergodicity may still occur despite the absence of disorder. In this regime, the large tilt energy imposes kinetic constraints, which result in an emergent dipole conservation 19,20,22,31,33 . This emergent behavior is in fact governed by a fragmented Hamiltonian resulting in non-ergodic dynamics. Starting from an initial charge-density wave (CDW) of singlons (singly-occupied site), we study relaxation dynamics in the tilted 1D Fermi-Hubbard model for a large range of interaction strengths and moderate values of the tilt (Δ &lt; 4J), where none of the two mechanisms described above should apply and where naively one may expect the system to thermalize 35,36 . At short times we observe coherent dynamics due to Bloch oscillations, whose amplitude strongly depends on the Hubbard interactions. Surprisingly we find that after intermediate times and even close to resonance (regime ①), the evolution converges to a steady-state, that persists for long evolution times up to 700 tunneling times, signaling a robust memory of the initial CDW throughout.In this work, we study non-ergodic behavior in the disorderfree tilted one-dimensional (1D) Fermi-Hubbard model (Fig. 1a), which lies at the interface of MBL and Hilbert-space fragmentation.

        <p>Using numerical calculations we show that the observed nonergodicity cannot be explained by the phenomenon of Stark-MBL, i.e., the robust memory is not due to experimental imperfections, such as residual harmonic confinement or disorder, and the bipartite entanglement entropy does not exhibit the characteristic behavior of MBL systems 30,37 (Supplementary Fig. 5). Hence, non-ergodicity appears to have a different origin, despite similar experimental signatures. This raises the question about the origin of the observed non-ergodicity. We construct effective Hamiltonians in two distinct regimes (① and ②, Fig. 1b) by taking the large tilt limit and find strongly-fragmented Hamiltonians in both cases (Supplementary Note 3). While these models are only expected to describe the dynamics at large tilt values and for intermediate times (on the order of a few tens of tunneling times), they allow us to identify the microscopic processes that initiate dynamics at short times (Fig. 1b). In both regimes these are correlated tunneling processes, which result in the formation of doublons (doubly-occupied sites), either resonantly (regime ①) or detuned by the Hubbard interaction energy U (regime ②). Higher-order terms are expected to eventually drive the system towards thermalization 19 . However, we are able to show that energy penalties for the second-or higher-order tunneling processes, which occur naturally in the model, render these dynamics inefficient. This results in extremely slow relaxation (Supplementary Note 3), which appears stable for &gt; 10 4 tunneling times in our exact diagonalization studies of small systems, in agreement with our experimental observations (Supplementary Fig. 4).Using numerical calculations we show that the observed nonergodicity cannot be explained by the phenomenon of Stark-MBL, i.e., the robust memory is not due to experimental imperfections, such as residual harmonic confinement or disorder, and the bipartite entanglement entropy does not exhibit the characteristic behavior of MBL systems 30,37 (Supplementary Fig. 5).

        <p>In order to characterize the dynamics across the whole parameter regime studied experimentally, we compute the finite-time connectivity of our initial CDW state C ϵ ¼ dimðN ϵ Þ= dimðHÞ, which is defined by the fraction of states that participate in the time evolution up to a finite time T N ; here N ϵ denotes the subspace in the complete Hilbert-space H, which is defined, such that the residual overlap of the time-evolved state ψðtÞ outside of N ϵ is at most ϵ at any time t ≤ T N (Methods). The value of ϵ is typically chosen between 1 and 10%. The finite-time connectivity can be understood as a measure of non-ergodicity, similar to the more conventional return probability or other multifractality measures 38 . While effective Hamiltonians can only be derived explicitly in certain limits, the numerical construction is applicable in the whole parameter regime probed in this work (Fig. 1c). We find that the finite-time connectivity vanishes in the thermodynamic limit for all parameters, suggesting that only a small fraction of the states participates in the dynamics, signaling nonergodic behavior. Our results suggest that the emergent kinetic constraints result in transient non-ergodic behavior across the whole parameter range studied in this work.

In a tilted lattice an initially localized particle exhibits Bloch oscillations 39 , with a characteristic period T σ = h/Δ σ , set by the spin-dependent tilt. In the presence of interactions, Bloch oscillations persist, showing a rich variety of dynamics, such as interaction-induced dephasing and amplitude modulation [40][41][42][43][44][45] .

        <p>For weak tilt values, Δ ↓ = 1.2J, we find that the dynamics of the interacting spin-mixture (U = 3J) exhibits the same dominant frequency components as the non-interacting Bloch oscillations, while the dephasing is strongly enhanced. This can be seen more directly by calculating the power spectral density (PSD) of the imbalance j Ĩσ ðνÞj 2 (inset of Fig. 2a). We find three distinct peaks in the spectrum, the Bloch frequency Δ ↓ and an admixture of two higher harmonics with the largest spectral weight in the second harmonic at ν 1 = 2Δ ↓ /h. For U = 3J its weight is decreased by 70% compared to the non-interacting case. The higher-order harmonics originate from the real-space evolution within one Bloch cycle and are determined by the Bloch oscillation amplitude A σ /d s = 4J/Δ σ .

        <p>Interaction effects are expected to be less relevant once the Bloch oscillation amplitude is smaller than one site, resulting in negligible overlap between neighboring particles for our CDW initial state. In Fig. 2b we show the PSD of the coherent shorttime dynamics for Δ ↓ = 3.0J. While the largest spectral weight of the PSD is now contained in the Bloch frequency ν 2 = Δ ↓ /h, the reduction is still about 50% compared to the non-interacting case. Indeed, the spectral weight is a sensitive measure of the interaction-induced dephasing. Moreover, the on-site interactions lift the degeneracy of the energy levels in the Wannier-Stark spectrum, which results in additional frequency components in the PSD. For our parameters (Fig. 2b) they occur at ≈ ν 2 ± 0.5Δ ↓ /h in the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) simulations [46][47][48] , which is consistent with our data.Interaction effects are expected to be less relevant once the Bloch oscillation amplitude is smaller than one site, resulting in negligible overlap between neighboring particles for our CDW initial state.

We find a sharp decrease of the PPSD by about 40% already for small interaction strength U =± 0.5J for Δ σ = 1.2J. After reaching a global minimum at intermediate interaction strength, it slowly recovers to the noninteracting value in the limit of large interactions.The sensitivity of the coherent short-time dynamics on the interaction strength is further highlighted by the strong interaction-dependence of the peak power spectral density (PPSD) j Ĩ ðν j Þj 2 of the respective dominant frequency components ν j , j = {1, 2} (Fig. 2c,d).

        <p>Excellent agreement between our data and the analytical result provides strong evidence that the effect of the harmonic confinement is negligible for the late-time steady-state imbalance, in contrast to previous fermionic transport experiments 35,36 . This is further supported by the data in Fig. 3b, where the steady-state value is probed for a larger range of tilt values, even reproducing the non-monotonous behavior that is found for small values of the tilt. Note, that the vanishing imbalance, as observed for Δ ↓ ≈ 1.5J (dashed line in Fig. 3b), does not indicate delocalization.

        <p>In the presence of weak interactions localization was predicted to survive in the limit of small additional disorder or harmonic confinement, signaled by a finite steady-state imbalance 30,31 . Here, we find that after a small decay at intermediate times a plateau of the imbalance develops, which persists for long evolution times up to 700τ (Fig. 3a) in the strongly-interacting regime. A comparison with ED simulations (inset Fig. 3a) in a clean system without spin-dependent tilt and without harmonic confinement for a Néel-ordered initial CDW (as opposed to the random-spin initial state realized in the experiment) further highlights that this non-ergodic behavior is not due to experimental imperfections at least for the experimentally relevant observation times (see Supplementary Fig. 5 for a systematic finite-size scaling analysis). Moreover, this robust steady-state value survives over a wide range of parameters (Fig. 3b). As a function of the tilt it qualitatively follows the behavior of the noninteracting system, but shows consistently lower steady-state values.In the presence of weak interactions localization was predicted to survive in the limit of small additional disorder or harmonic confinement, signaled by a finite steady-state imbalance 30,31 .

        <p>The persistence of non-ergodicity down to very small values of the tilt is surprising at first sight. One may expect that for large Bloch-oscillation amplitudes the interactions between particles result in a dephasing of the coherent dynamics that give rise to Wannier-Stark localization in the non-interacting limit and hence cause ergodic behavior 35,36,[40][41][42][43] . We study the plateau value for Δ ↓ = 1.1J and find that it is largely independent of interactions (Fig. 3c). In a numerical analysis of this regime for a Néel-ordered singlon CDW we indeed find that the imbalance decays to zero for evolution times on the order of 10 4 τ (Supplementary Fig. 5), which further agrees with the finite imbalance measured at ~200 τ. The observed inversion of the spin-resolved imbalance I # &lt; I " after long evolution times (although Δ ↓ &gt; Δ ↑ ) is explained by the non-monotonic dependence of the stationary imbalance on the tilt for Δ σ &lt; 2J as shown in Fig. 3b.The persistence of non-ergodicity down to very small values of the tilt is surprising at first sight. One may expect that for large Bloch-oscillation amplitudes the interactions between particles result in a dephasing of the coherent dynamics that give rise to Wannier-Stark localization in the non-interacting limit and hence cause ergodic behavior 35,36,[40][41][42][43] .

The behavior is similar for both spin components and well reproduced by numerical simulations. The deviation between experiment and numerical simulations at larger interaction strengths is most likely due to the finite coupling between 1D chains, which plays a larger role for increased interactions 49 .

        <p>In order to gain additional insights into the observed non-ergodic behavior, we study the properties of our model perturbatively in the large tilt limit for the two distinct regimes ① and ② (Fig. 1c). In regime ②, Δ ≫ J, |U|, an effective Hamiltonian can be derived in powers of λ = J/Δ. As predicted 19,20,22,31,33 , we find an emergent dipole-conserving Hamiltonian Ĥdip eff [Supplementary Eq. ( 9)] up to third order in λ (Supplementary Note 3), where the dipole-moment operator is defined as ∑ i;σ in i;σ . The dominant off-diagonal terms of Ĥdip eff are of similar nature as those in the fragmented Hamiltonians studied previously 19,20 , seemingly consistent with the observed nonergodic behavior. Yet, higher-order processes Oðλ 4 Þ, relevant for Δ ≃ 3J, are expected to melt the CDW within the experimentally studied timescales 19 . These higher-order processes as well as the dominant off-diagonal contribution, however, require the production of doublons, which is penalized by the on-site interaction U. We numerically show that this leads to a significant slowdown of the dynamics (Supplementary Note 5), which explains the robustness of the steady-state value observed in the experiment. Thus, for large values of the tilt, the doublon number is effectively conserved as well, as suggested in Ref. 31 .In order to gain additional insights into the observed non-ergodic behavior, we study the properties of our model perturbatively in the large tilt limit for the two distinct regimes ① and ② (Fig. 1c).

        <p>On resonance, |U| ≃ 2Δ (regime ① in Fig. 1c), doublons can be formed without energy penalties, possibly leading to faster dynamics. Indeed, after an initial faster dynamics, we find a lower steady-state imbalance, which cannot be solely explained by the second-order resonant tunneling process shown in Fig. 1c, because it leaves the imbalance invariant. In this regime, we derive an effective Hamiltonian Ĥres eff [Supplementary Eq. ( 19)] up to second order in λ (the third order vanishes), conserving the dipole moment, the doublon number or the sum of the two (∑ i;σ in i;σ þ 2∑ i ni;" ni;# ). The corresponding symmetry sector exhibits strong fragmentation and results in a finite steady-state imbalance (Supplementary Note 4). In Fig. 4c we show the dominant second-order tunneling terms for our initial state, illustrating the importance of doublon-assisted tunneling processes for the reduction of the steady-state imbalance. For finite λ or longer evolution times, higher-order hopping processes Oðλ 4 Þ enable additional dynamics. These processes are expected to eventually melt the CDW completely, although the required timescales may be very large. In the experiment, we find robust steady-state values even for rather low values of the tilt (Δ ≃ 3J) up to evolution times of about 700τ (Fig. 3a).On resonance, |U| ≃ 2Δ (regime ① in Fig. 1c), doublons can be formed without energy penalties, possibly leading to faster dynamics.

        <p>In order to connect the large-tilt limit described by Ĥres eff to the experimental parameter regime, we investigate the states within the explored subspace N ϵ , which we denote numerical fragment in analogy to the phenomenon of Hilbert-space fragmentation. For simplicity, we study a clean system (ω h = 0, Δ ↑ = Δ ↓ ≡ Δ) and a Néel-ordered CDW initial state. In Fig. 4a, we show the density of states in the Hilbert space H and compare it to the density of states in the numerical fragment N ϵ for different values of the cut-off ϵ. Centered around the energy of the initial state, the density of states acquires a finite width within the numerical fragments, that is approximately set by the many-body bandwidth ± 2JN (dashed line in Fig. 4a), where N = N ↑ + N ↓ denotes the total number of atoms. In stark contrast to thermal systems, the low finite-time connectivity indicates that only a small number of states is relevant for the dynamics. Moreover, it vanishes exponentially in the thermodynamic limit for finite evolution times up to 1000 τ (Fig. 4b). Since the perturbative Hamiltonian Ĥres eff is only valid in the limit of large tilts, the intersection between the numerically constructed fragment and the analytical one K res ("Methods"), which was derived using the perturbative Hamiltonian Ĥres eff up to third order in λ = J/Δ, is small for our experimental parameters Δ = 3J and U = 5J (Fig. 4c). We expect, however, that the two subsectors coincide for λ → 0. Indeed the normalized intersection saturates to one, although only for Δ/J ≫ 20. For this comparison the cut-off value ϵðK res Þ is chosen such that dim ðN ϵðK res Þ Þ ¼ dim ðK res Þ, since generally, N ϵ contains a much larger number of states. Despite the large value of λ realized in the experiment, we find strong evidence that the slow dynamics is due to kinetic constraints and that the energetically allowed microscopic processes give rise to the phenomenon of Hilbert-space fragmentation in the large tilt limit, as demonstrated for the two regimes (① and ②). This is further supported by the resonance feature that is shown in the inset of Fig. 4c for the resonant regime ①.In order to connect the large-tilt limit described by Ĥres eff to the experimental parameter regime, we investigate the states within the explored subspace N ϵ , which we denote numerical fragment in analogy to the phenomenon of Hilbert-space fragmentation.

        <p>Experimental sequence. Our sequence begins with loading a degenerate Fermi gas with temperature T/T F = 0.15 (1), where T F is the Fermi temperature, into a threedimensional (3D) optical lattice. The wavelength is λ l = 1064 nm along the x direction and λ ⊥ = 738 nm in the transverse directions. Repulsive interactions during loading in combination with a short, off-resonant light pulse after loading ensure an initial state free of double occupancies (Supplementary Note 7). By adding a short lattice with wavelength λ s = λ l /2 along the x direction, we generate a CDW initial state consisting of singlons (Supplementary Note 7). Holding the gas in this deep 3D lattice with a tilted, bichromatic superlattice along the x direction, dephases remaining correlations between neighboring sites and suppresses any residual dynamics, while ramping up a magnetic field gradient and adjusting the interaction strength. The lattice depths are 18 E rs for the short lattice, 20 E rl for the long lattice and 55 E r⊥ for the transverse lattices. The depths are given in the respective recoil energies, E rj ¼ _ 2 k 2 j =ð2mÞ, with j ∈ {l, s, ⊥}, k j = 2π/λ j the corresponding wave vector, m the mass of 40 K and and ℏ = h/(2π) the reduced Planck constant. The deep transverse lattices decouple the 1D chains aligned along x and generate a 2D array of nearly independent 1D systems. The residual coupling along the transverse directions is typically less then 0.03 % of the coupling J along x. The dynamics to probe the tilted 1D Fermi-Hubbard model described by the Hamiltonian in Eq.

Simultaneously, the strength of the dipole trap is adjusted in order to compensate the anti-confining harmonic potential introduced by the lattice (Supplementary Note 8). After a variable evolution time t the on-site population is frozen by suddenly ramping up the longitudinal lattices to 18 E rs and 20 E rl respectively. Subsequently, we extract the spin-resolved imbalance I σ , by using a bandmapping technique 63,64 in conjunction with Stern-Gerlach resolved absorption imaging. Note, that the imbalance is defined as a charge imbalance between even and odd lattice sites in our system and does not probe spin imbalances.

        <p>In Fig. 2, we use TEBD calculations with L = 100 and bond-dimension χ = 120. The truncation error was less than 10 -2 . In Fig. 2b,c, we compare the experimental and numerical data in Fourier space. If the two data sets have different number of samplings in the time domain, we scale the numerical data appropriately after the fast Fourier transform.In Fig. 2, we use TEBD calculations with L = 100 and bond-dimension χ = 120.

        <p>Construction of the Krylov subspace. The Krylov subspace (corresponding to the fragment K res ) is constructed by using the effective Hamiltonian on resonance Ĥres eff in Supplementary Eq. ( 19). This Hamiltonian is then interpreted as an adjacency matrix in the Wannier basis and the Krylov subspace consists of all states, which are connected to the Néel-ordered CDW initial state. The Krylov subspace K res is closed under time-evolution generated by the effective Hamiltonian Ĥres eff . Starting from initial states within the Krylov subspace K res and including higher-order terms Oðλ 4 Þ, the dynamics is captured only approximately (Supplementary Note 4). An improvement is obtained by further rotating the diagonal basis in which the effective Hamiltonian becomes fragmented with the unitary transformation obtained in powers of λ (as given by the Schrieffer-Wolff perturbative expansion (Supplementary Note 3)). This results in a rotated Krylov subspace.Construction of the Krylov subspace.

        <p>Construction of the numerical fragment. We define the numerical fragment N ϵ as the span of a subset B ϵ of the number basis B of H, where H is restricted to quarter filling and zero magnetization. We define the set B ϵ via its complement, B ϵ ¼ BnB c ϵ , where B c ϵ would be ideally defined as the largest subset of B satisfying max t &lt; T N ∑ n c 2B c ϵ n c jψðtÞ 2 &lt; ϵ. Here T N defines a time window for the evolution of the initial state ψðt ¼ 0Þ . Equivalently, one could define the subset B ϵ as the smallest one, satisfying min t&lt;T N ∑ n2B ϵ njψðtÞ 2 ≥ 1 À ϵ. We work with the complement, because it is easier to implement numerically. This inequality condition for the complement would ensure that the residual overlap of ψðtÞ outside of N ϵ at any time t ≤ T N is bounded by ϵ. Constructing this B c ϵ , however, involves a search in the powerset of B, which is exponential in the dimension of H. This is intractable even for relatively small system sizes such as L = 7. It follows from the inequality max t &lt; T N ∑ n c n c jψðtÞ 2 ≤ ∑ n c max t &lt; T N n c jψðtÞ 2 that keeping the latter sum smaller than ϵ will ensure that the former sum is also bounded by ϵ. Moreover, the latter sum is computationally easier to handle and therefore, we use it to define the fragment. We construct the numerical fragment N ϵ using a B c ϵ , defined such that ∑ n c max t &lt; T N n c jψðtÞ 2 &lt; ϵ. The gap in the inequality max t &lt; T N ∑ n c n c jψðtÞ 2 ≤ ∑ n c max t &lt; T N n c jψðtÞ 2 loosely depends on the sum ∑ n2B max t &lt; T N njψðtÞ 2 , which is in general, not normalized. Although this sum can be as large as the dimension of H, in the examples that we study, it remains small, i.e., &lt; 10 for L &lt; 20, and grows logarithmically in the dimension of H.Construction of the numerical fragment.
