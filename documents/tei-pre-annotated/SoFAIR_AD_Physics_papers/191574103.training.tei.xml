        <p>We argue that the late time behavior of horizon fluctuations in large antide Sitter (AdS) black holes is governed by the random matrix dynamics characteristic of quantum chaotic systems. Our main tool is the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which we use as a simple model of a black hole. We use an analytically continued partition function |Z(β + it)| 2 as well as correlation functions as diagnostics. Using numerical techniques we establish random matrix behavior at late times. We determine the early time behavior exactly in a double scaling limit, giving us a plausible estimate for the crossover time to random matrix behavior. We use these ideas to formulate a conjecture about general large AdS black holes, like those dual to 4D super-Yang-Mills theory, giving a provisional estimate of the crossover time. We make some preliminary comments about challenges to understanding the late time dynamics from a bulk point of view.We argue that the late time behavior of horizon fluctuations in large antide Sitter (AdS) black holes is governed by the random matrix dynamics characteristic of quantum chaotic systems.

        <p>One of the deep questions in quantum gravity is the origin of the discrete spectrum of black hole microstates, from the bulk perspective of holographic duality. For large black holes the AdS/CFT duality makes the answer clear from the boundary perspective -a boundary field theory on a compact space generically has a discrete spectrum of states. But its origin from bulk gravity or string theory, even including nonperturbative effects like branes, is still mysterious.One of the deep questions in quantum gravity is the origin of the discrete spectrum of black hole microstates, from the bulk perspective of holographic duality.

        <p>Z generically scales as e aS where S is the entropy and a is a positive constant. So (1.5) scales as e -aS . In the holographic context S is the black hole entropy which scales as 1/g 2 s ∼ 1/G N , where g s and G N are the string coupling and Newton constants of the bulk theory, so (1.5) is nonperturbative in the bulk coupling. For large black holes, S is given by the thermal entropy of the boundary field theory, and it scales with the number of degrees of freedom. In particular, we have S ∼ N 2 in matrix theories like super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, and S ∼ N in vector theories like the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model [6,7]. Either way, the quantity (1.5) is non-perturbative in 1/N . Now, suppose we attempt to compute the left-hand side of (1.5) by making a coarse grained approximation. If we replace the discrete sum over states in (1.3) by an integral over a smooth density we find that the long-time average vanishes. In holography, by analytically continuing saddle points we also find disagreement with (1.5). (See section 9 and also [8].) Therefore, by studying how the long-time decay of the partition function (or of the correlator) is avoided in gravity we are in fact probing the discreteness of the black hole spectrum -a basic characteristic of its quantum nature. 3From the bulk perspective, Maldacena initially suggested that an instanton might be responsible for the analogous O(e -aS ) root-mean-square (RMS) height of the correlator. Barbon and Rabinovici [9] pointed out that such an instanton might not describe the details of the irregular long-time fluctuations expected in the correlator.

        <p>The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model [6,7] is a good laboratory to explore these questions. It is a quantum mechanical model of N Majorana fermions with random q-fermion JHEP05(2017)118 couplings that is soluble at large N . The theory is highly chaotic: at strong coupling it saturates [12][13][14] the chaos bound [15], a property that is characteristic of black holes in Einstein gravity [16][17][18]. It realizes a (highly curved) description of a "nearly AdS 2 "/"nearly CFT 1 " system [14,[19][20][21][22]. As is the case for other vector models, there is an exact rewrite of the disorder-averaged model in terms of a functional integral over bilocal O(N ) singlet fields G, Σ that presumably are related to the bulk description. 4The SYK model has several other properties that make it useful in the study of late time properties. The average over the random couplings should rattle the energy eigenvalues sufficiently to make the rapidly oscillating terms in equations (1.1), (1.3) average to zero at a fixed time, making these quantities smooth functions of time. This makes them more amenable to study. In addition, the model is computationally simple enough that numerical methods can yield significant insight [31,32].

        <p>One goal of this paper is to explore the late time behavior of the SYK model. We present numerous numerical results about such behavior in the model, and interpret them using a variety of analytic and conceptual arguments. One of our key findings is a close relationship between the late time behavior of the model and the behavior of random matrices. 5It is a widely held conjecture [36] that the spacing statistics of nearby energy levels in quantum chaotic systems should be well approximated by an appropriate random matrix ensemble. Since late times corresponds to small energy differences our result is a natural one.One goal of this paper is to explore the late time behavior of the SYK model.

        <p>Here we give an outline of the paper and summarize the main results. In section 2 we introduce the SYK model. Then in section 3 we write down the spectral form factor, which is given by |Z(β, t)| 2 /Z(β) 2 averaged over the random couplings. At late times this quantity goes over to a plateau value given approximately by (1.5), which characterizes the discreteness of the spectrum. By numerically computing this quantity we find that its late time behavior exhibits an interesting feature, see figure 1. Starting at t = 0, the spectral form factor first dips below its plateau value and then climbs back up in a linear fashion (we call this region the 'ramp'), joining onto the plateau. This behavior is readily explained if we approximate the SYK Hamiltonian by a Gaussian random matrix, as shown in figure 2. Further evidence for the relation between the late time behavior and random matrix theory (RMT) is given in section 3.1, where we show the relation between the choice of RMT ensemble (GUE, GOE, or GSE) and the detailed shape of the late time behavior in SYK.

        <p>We will be discussing the curve g(t) at length, so let us point out the main features in this plot and introduce some nomenclature. Starting with t = 0, at early times the value of g(t) drops quickly along what we will call the 'slope', until it reaches a minimum at the 'dip time' t d . Next comes a period of linear growth that we will call the 'ramp'. It ends at the plateau time t p , and beyond this we have an almost constant value of g(t) that we call the 'plateau'. The plateau height is equal to the long-time average of g(t).

(At infinite temperature the annealed and quenched quantities are in fact equal because Z(β = 0) = Tr(1) is independent of the random couplings.) 8 All numerical results in this paper were computed by fully diagonalizing the SYK Hamiltonian for independently generated Gaussian random couplings, computing the relevant quantity, and then taking the mean. Figure 1. A log-log plot of SYK g(t; β = 5), plotted against time for N = 34. Here we use the dimensionless combination tJ for time. Initially the value drops quickly, through a region we call the slope, to a minimum, which we call the dip. After that the value increases roughly linearly, ∼ t, until it smoothly connects to a plateau around tJ = 3 × 10 4 . We call this increase the ramp, and the time at which the extrapolated linear fit of the ramp in the log-log plot crosses the fitted plateau level the plateau time. The data was taken using 90 independent samples, and the disorder average was taken for the numerator and denominator separately.We will be discussing the curve g(t) at length, so let us point out the main features in this plot and introduce some nomenclature.

        <p>Quantities such as g, g d , and g c are studied extensively in the field of quantum chaos. In particular, g(t) (typically used with β = 0) is called the spectral form factor and it is a standard diagnostic of the pair correlation function of energy eigenvalues. We will often refer to g(t) by this name. It supplies information about the correlations of eigenvalues at different energy separations. 9One of the basic conjectures in the field of quantum chaos is that the fine grained energy eigenvalue structure of a chaotic system is the same as that of a random matrix chosen from one of the standard Dyson ensembles [40]: Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE), Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), or Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble (GSE).

        <p>Note the similarity between the RMT result and the SYK result, and in particular the presence of the ramp and the plateau. We will argue that the late-time behavior of the spectral form factor in SYK can be explained by random matrix theory. The early time behavior of RMT differs from SYK, although it is not obvious from the plots. The typical eigenvalue density has different dependence on energy in the two systems, which leads to somewhat different initial decays. Moreover, at early times RMT is governed by a perturbative expansion in 1/L, while SYK is governed by an expansion in 1/N . On the other hand, at times well beyond the dip, g(t) is determined by eigenvalue correlations on scales much smaller than the total width of the spectrum, and there one expects to find agreement between SYK and RMT.Note the similarity between the RMT result and the SYK result, and in particular the presence of the ramp and the plateau.

        <p>What is the physical origin of the ramp in RMT? Eigenvalues of generic matrices repel, so near degeneracies are extremely unlikely. This causes the plateau. The time of onset of the plateau is determined by the scale of near neighbor eigenvalue spacings. The ramp, though, is due to the repulsion between eigenvalues that are far apart in the spectrum. This repulsion, when balanced against the effects that keep the energy finite, gives rise to a very rigid eigenvalue structure. This phenomenon is referred to as long-range spectral rigidity [36,40,41]. More quantitatively, if δE n denotes the deviation of an energy from its average value, then at leading order δE n δE m ∼ log |n -m|. For comparison, if the eigenvalues formed a one dimensional crystal with harmonic near neighbor interactions, then δE n δE m ∼ |n-m|, a much less rigid behavior [36,40,41]. The log |n-m| form, after suitable processing we will discuss below, accounts for the linear behavior of the ramp. The ramp lies below the plateau because repulsion causes the eigenvalues to be anticorrelated.What is the physical origin of the ramp in RMT?

        <p>Figure 3 shows the nearest-neighbor statistics of SYK with N = 30, 32, and we see excellent agreement with RMT predictions. While the nearest-neighbor spacing distribution is sensitive to correlations between adjacent energy levels, the spectral form factor probes correlations between energy levels at larger separations. The t parameter in g(t) determines the scale of the energy differences being probed. As discussed above, beyond the plateau time only individual energy levels are probed, while at earlier times (and in particular on the ramp) g(t) is sensitive to correlations between levels that are much farther apart than the mean level spacing.

For N = 34 (GUE) a careful comparison that confirms the RMT ramp shape is described in section 6. As an initial test we fitted the ramp at times well before the plateau time (where unfolding effects discussed in section 6 become significant).

        <p>One important consequence of figure 4 is that it allows us to learn about the large N behavior of the ramp. As we go to larger N the dip time grows quickly, but the plateau time grows even faster, resulting in a more and more prominent ramp.

        <p>Eq. ( 6.3) can be interpreted as follows: we approximate the spectrum by bands over which ρ(E) varies very little. From each band, we get a GUE ramp.

In a theory with many degrees of freedom, we expect the integral over E to be strongly peaked around a maximum. In general, the location of this maximum will depend on time. The ramp will join the plateau at the time t p = e S(2β) , where the energy that maximizes the integral is simply E(2β), the energy that dominates the canonical ensemble at inverse temperature 2β.

        <p>One would like to apply (6.3) to SYK, but there is an important subtlety. The second term in (6.3) should be understood as exponentially smaller than the first, as long as t is not too large. In SYK, we also expect correlations between eigenvalues that are only power-law suppressed by N (more precisely of order 1/N q ). One source of such fluctuations would be the overall scale of the Hamiltonian, which varies from J configuration to J configuration. Such terms would dominate over the ramp contribution at short times. However, we might hope that these 1/N q terms will always be smaller than either the first term or the second term in (6.3), so the formula still gives a reasonable picture of SYK. We will return to this point below.One would like to apply (6.3) to SYK, but there is an important subtlety.

Another possibility is that some effect leads to the slope portion of g(t) decreasing more rapidly at an earlier timescale. For example, this could be the result of some 1/N q effect that tends to smooth out the sharp √ E -E 0 edge in the spectrum, leading to a faster decay. 23In this situation, the slope would crash and intersect the ramp much sooner, leading to a short dip time, perhaps of order t d ∼ N q . Another possibility is that the very bottom of the spectrum would be controlled by a spin-glass phase that was argued to exist in the Sachdev-Ye model [48], and may also be present at exponentially low temperatures in the SYK model [62]. Such effects may also lead to a softer edge in the spectrum, again leading to a faster decay of the slope and a correspondingly shorter dip time.We caution the reader that although the agreement in figure 7 looks reasonable, it is very possible that the true large N answer for g(t) would differ in important ways.

        <p>We are fairly confident that the dip time should be no later than e N s 0 /2 , based on the idea that neglected effects are not likely to make the spectrum vanish more sharply. As an extreme fallback position, one can argue without any calculation that the dip time is less than e N s 0 , which is enough to establish a parametrically long ramp at non-zero temperature. To make the argument, one assumes that the slow decay in the slope is monotonic and roughly independent of temperature, based on the idea that it comes from the edge of the spectrum. Note that t d can never be larger than t p , because at times t &gt; t p the spectral form factor g(t) is only sensitive to individual energy levels, with all correlations between different levels getting washed out by the oscillating terms.

        <p>It is important to ask whether the late time features of the spectral form factor (the dip, the ramp and the plateau) appear in ordinary chaotic quantum field theories without a disorder average. As a first step towards addressing this question, in this section we consider the SYK spectral form factor g(t; β) (3.1), computed for a single realization of JHEP05(2017)118 the random couplings J ijkl . Figure 10 compares the single sample result with the disorder averaged spectral form factor. Before the dip time there is good agreement between the single sample and the averaged results. This is consistent with our expectation that in the large N limit and at early times, a typical sample should give a good approximation to the disorder-averaged spectral form factor. We say that the spectral form factor is self averaging at early times. At late times, and in particular after the dip time, the spectral form factor is not self averaging [65]. This implies that at large N a typical realization of the couplings does not give a result that approaches the disorder-averaged value. In particular, at late times a typical realization exhibits large fluctuations as shown in figure 10. We expect ordinary quantum field theories (with no disorder average) to have similar behavior. 24Despite the large fluctuations, the underlying dip, ramp and plateau are still clearly visible. These features can be made clear by averaging over a sliding time window of width t ave , smearing out the fluctuations. 25,26 For this to work we need to be able to take t ave parametrically shorter than the length of the ramp, so that the features we are interested in will not get smeared out along with the fluctuations.

        <p>Given t decay we can estimate the minimal value of t ave required to remove the fluctuations from the single-sample data. We expect the fractional standard deviation (the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean) for such averaged data to behave like t decay tave . To have a curve with fluctuations smaller than, say, 1/N 2 would require t ave to be no greater than N 4 , even if t decay is as large as 1. Such a value of t ave is parametrically smaller than the length of the ramp, which is exponentially large in N . Therefore, at large N the averaging width t ave can be taken to be parametrically smaller than the length of the ramp. Now we show that on the plateau t decay ∼ 1/ √ N at large N and large fixed β.

        <p>On the ramp the analysis is more subtle. First we make the plausible assumption that the leading multipoint energy eigenvalue correlation functions at the exponentially small scales appropriate to the ramp are the same as the RMT correlators, up to 1/N q corrections. In GUE these correlators factorize into sums of products of sine kernels [36]. Then we can use a procedure like that leading to (6.3) to show that for most of the ramp after a time dt of order 1 the autocorrelation function h(dt) decays like 1/(dt) 4 . For the earliest part of the ramp, t &lt; e N s 0 , h(dt) ∼ 1/(dt) 3 . These power laws are integrable and so we estimate that on the ramp t decay ∼ 1. This means that t ave can be chosen to make the error smaller than any power of N and still leave exponentially many data points on the exponentially long ramp. Numerics are not conclusive here, but do show a systematic decrease of error after time averaging.On the ramp the analysis is more subtle.

        <p>At t = 0, Z ∼ e cN 2 /β 3 which for small β is very large. This reflects the very large entropy at high temperatures. (Here and below c denotes positive constants of order one.) As t is increased and β → β + it, |Z| 2 drops very quickly. At t ∼ β, |Z| 2 becomes less than one. Then another saddle, the thermal AdS solution, dominates. Including the one loop determinant around this saddle representing a gas of gravitons we find |Z| 2 ∼ e c/β 3 , an N -independent much smaller value. 27But this is not the whole story. As t increases to AdS scale |Z| 2 increases again, eventually becoming of order |Z| 2 ∼ e cN 2 (with no 1 β 3 enhancement).

        <p>But there is another wrinkle. As t becomes large the solutions of V (r + ) = 0 coalesce.

        <p>Other saddle points could be relevant here. For example, at high temperature, small β, there is a 10D small Schwarzschild black hole saddle point with r + l.

        <p>Although it is never thermodynamically dominant, the recent analysis of [68] indicates that there is a Gregory-Laflamme-type 5D to localized 10D transition in the space of saddles. At first glance this could produce a singularity in ρ(E) leading to a slow long-time falloff. If this transition is caused by a single mode becoming tachyonic then it produces a branch point singularity in Z which presumably can be analytically continued around. If there is a more serious kind of large N transition it may produce a more extreme form of singularity.

        <p>So we see that the first black holes that are relevant are small, with r s ∼ β, but not microscopic. The associated dip time is exponential, but with a parametrically small coefficient at high temperature. Note that this conclusion is rather sensitive to the longtime behavior of the slope, so this identification of the dip time is tentative. For example, if we have g slope = 1 Z(β) 2 e cN 2 instead, then we would expect t d ∼ e c N 2 for an order one c . Either way, at high temperature we have a large hierarchy between the dip time and the plateau time t p ∼ e 4c 0 N 2 /(2β) 3 , leading to a parametrically long ramp. 30 The early time behavior of AdS 3 /CFT 2 is under greater analytic control and has been analyzed in [8].

        <p>There is a subtlety in these estimates. SYM and many other theories have global symmetries (like the SO(6) R symmetry). We expect the spectrum within each sector to have chaotic RMT correlations, but the different sectors would be essentially uncorrelated. We expect the number of thermodynamically significant sectors at fixed β to be at most polynomial in the entropy S. If we denote the separate sectors by indices a, b we can write g(t) = a,b g ab (t) where g ab contains the sum over energies in the fixed sectors a, b. The diagonal terms in this sum contribute as usual to the ramp and plateau; the off-diagonal terms have vanishing contribution at late time and large S. So the overall heights of the ramp and plateau are suppressed by polynomials in S. This effect is subleading to the exponential effects we are interested in and so we ignore it. We have confirmed these ideas in the Dirac SYK model which contains a U(1) charge.There is a subtlety in these estimates.

Their saddle point equation for the average of a single logarithm is equivalent to the equation obtained by combining the saddle point equations for G(ω n ) and Σ(ω n ) for one frequency (D.1), except that we now account for the source with a shift of ω n , -iω n → -iω n + z n .Now we evaluate the averaged logarithms of the single frequency factors of the sourced partition function.

        <p>For the average of the product of logarithms, the saddle point equations have a mixing term. These equations are quadratic and thus have two solutions, G + (ω n ) and G -(ω n ) (D.2). Choosing a replica symmetric solution with G + for each replica gives the dominant contribution to the integrals, the fluctuation is the first term that survives. These contributions correspond to the semicircle part of the mass distribution and mass pair correlation function, and the fluctuations give the ramp. Considering a replica symmetry breaking saddle point involving both G + (ω n ) and G -(ω n ) gives the sine kernel type contribution to R 2 (λ, λ ) in G 2 c (ω n , ω m ), and thus gives us the plateau. As we noted above, calculations of Z(t) and g(t) using saddle points will be more complicated. It appears that the Itzykson-Zuber integral [79] will be helpful.

        <p>F On N -q vs. 2 -N It would be nice to have a direct analytical argument for the ramp and plateau in SYK. As a first step, one would like to understand where the e -2S scale of the ramp comes from. Naively, this is puzzling, because the ramp arises from correlations between the two replicas, and in simple diagrams such correlations are suppressed by powers of N q , not exponential factors. In this appendix, we make a simple comment about how the exponential can emerge from such diagrams.F On N -q vs. 2 -N It would be nice to have a direct analytical argument for the ramp and plateau in SYK.

        <p>This argument may seem a bit quick because the large fluctuations we are discussing are in the integral over random couplings, but this integral can be performed exactly.

        <p>g d (t) decays quickly to typically much smaller values than g(t) or g c (t) around the dip time. This is consistent with the theoretical expectation of a gaussian falloff due to fluctuations in the edge of the eigenvalue distribution at times of order N (albeit with a somewhat large coefficient). Such effects cancel out in g(t). (Beyond the dip time g d (t) seems to rebound. This is just because the number of samples is finite and hence the cancellation is not perfect.) Around the plateau time, the curves for g(t) and g c (t) exhibits a sharp peak for N = 20 and 28 (GSE), a kink for N = 18, 22, . . . , 34 (GUE), and a smoother connection for N = 16, 24, 32 (GOE), for β = 0. For β = 1 the feature is preserved, while for β = 5 the peak is broadened and the kink is less visible. However, the plateau heights for N ≡ 0 (mod 8) (GUE and GSE) cases appear shifted up compared to those for N ≡ 0 (mod 8) (GOE) cases, for all values of β, and the plateau heights for N = 18, 26, 34 are higher than those for N = 16, 24, 32 for β &gt; 0. All of this is consistent with the RMT interpretation, symmetry considerations and smoothing due to unfolding effects. Intuitively, the dip time can be determined by finding the minimum value of g. However, with finite statistics, the error is large because of the non-self-averaging nature of g(t) past the dip. Therefore, we estimated the error bar as follows. Firstly we found the minimum value g min . Then, the lower and upper limits of the error bar are estimated as the smallest and largest t which give g(t) &lt; g min × 1.04.g d (t) decays quickly to typically much smaller values than g(t) or g c (t) around the dip time.

These two choices agree when the quantity of interest is self-averaging (up to order 1/N q ). Therefore, g and g u must agree at early time.

        <p>A simple example of a 1/N q effect is the sample-to-sample variation of the edge of the eigenvalue spectrum. This causes a gaussian crash in the partition function g d (t) at times of order N (q-2)/2 but cancels out in g(t). Roughly speaking, effects that cause a crash in g(t) must be present in a single sample.A simple example of a 1/N q effect is the sample-to-sample variation of the edge of the eigenvalue spectrum.

        <p>As an example of the subtleties here, for n = 5, D = 6 the dominant saddle causes |Z| 2 to diverge as t → ∞. This is inconsistent so presumably this saddle eventually leaves the integration contour. In general we have not attempted to decide which saddles are on or off the steepest descent contour.As an example of the subtleties here, for n = 5, D = 6 the dominant saddle causes |Z| 2 to diverge as t → ∞.
