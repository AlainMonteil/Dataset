        <p>We present a direct measurement of the exchange interaction in room temperature ferromagnetic graphene. We study the spin transport in exfoliated graphene on an yttrium-iron-garnet substrate where the observed spin precession clearly indicates the presence and strength of an exchange field that is an unambiguous evidence of induced ferromagnetism. We describe the results with a modified Bloch diffusion equation and extract an average exchange field of the order of 0.2 T. Further, we demonstrate that a proximity induced 2D ferromagnet can efficiently modulate a spin current by controlling the direction of the exchange field. These findings can create a building block for magnetic-gate tuneable spin transport in one-atom-thick spintronic devices.We present a direct measurement of the exchange interaction in room temperature ferromagnetic graphene.

        <p>The introduction and control of ferromagnetism in graphene opens up a range of new directions for fundamental and applied studies [1,2]. Several approaches have been pursued so far, such as introduction of defects, functionalisation with adatoms, and shaping of graphene into nanoribbons with welldefined zigzag edges [3][4][5][6][7][8]. A more robust and less invasive method utilises the introduction of an exchange interaction by a ferromagnetic insulator (FMI) in proximity with graphene [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16]. The magnetic proximity effect describes the introduction of ferromagnetic order into an intrinsically nonmagnetic material by an adjacent ferromagnet due to the exchange interaction between the spins in the magnetic and non-magnetic material. Being atomically thin, graphene presents an ideal platform for studying such interaction, in particular when combined with a FMI. Theory predicts that for the idealised case of (super) lattice matching an exchange splitting of tens of meV can be obtained [16]. Up to date it has been studied experimentally in a number of FMI/graphene systems using materials with low Curie temperature such as EuO = ( ) T 69 K c and EuS = ( ) T 16.5 K c [13,14]. In comparison, yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) provides the advantage of a Curie temperature of 550 K, along with chemical stability in atmospheric conditions, the preservation of the charge transport properties in the graphene and the possibility to directly exfoliate or transfer graphene onto the surface for fabricating graphene-based spintronic devices.The introduction and control of ferromagnetism in graphene opens up a range of new directions for fundamental and applied studies [1,2].

        <p>As indication of a ferromagnetic exchange interaction in graphene/YIG heterostructures the observation of an anomalous Hall effect was reported [9]. More recently, the presence of an exchange interaction in YIG/CVD graphene devices was invoked to explain magnetoresistance measurements and ferromagnetic resonance spin pumping [15]. So far, in all the reports the authors employ charge transport, where in addition to exchange interaction also spin-orbit interaction is needed for the understanding, both a priori unknown parameters.As indication of a ferromagnetic exchange interaction in graphene/YIG heterostructures the observation of an anomalous Hall effect was reported [9].

        <p>In this work, we probe the induced exchange interaction in graphene in the most direct way using only the spin degree of freedom. The magnetic interaction between the YIG magnetisation and the graphene spins is expected to produce an exchange term in the Hamiltonian and to spin split the graphene energy bands (figure 1(a)). It can be described as an additional effective exchange field that is determined by the direction and magnitude of the YIG magnetisation. By studying its effect on spin transport and precession, and fitting the results with the modified Bloch spin diffusion equation we are able to describe our results qualitatively and quantitatively. We further demonstrate that the precession induced by the exchange field can be used for an efficient modulation of spin currents.In this work, we probe the induced exchange interaction in graphene in the most direct way using only the spin degree of freedom.

        <p>The device is shown in figures 1(b) and (c). A single layer graphene flake of approximately 12 μm by 1.2 μm is first exfoliated on SiO 2 and transferred to YIG. Ferromagnetic contacts are defined via e-beam lithography followed by Ti deposition, in situ oxidation to form TiO 2 , Co deposition and liftoff. A nonlocal spin valve characterisation [17] is shown in figure 2. A charge current is sent from the injector to the reference electrode. As a result a pure spin current diffuses through the channel and is detected as a voltage difference between the detecting and another reference electrode. The spin-transport measurements are obtained using contacts 1 and 2 as injector and detector with contact spacing m = d 1.2 m. The magnetisation direction of the injector (detector) can be controlled by sweeping the applied magnetic field along the easy axis of the electrodes. Figure 2(b) shows the change of the non-local resistance (R NL ) when the electrode configuration is switched between parallel and antiparallel alignment. The change in R NL is a pure spin signal that increases from 90 mΩ at room temperature to 650 mΩ at 75 K. To determine the spin relaxation length λ, we fit the dependence of the spin signal on d and extract λ=(490±40) nm (see footnote 2). These values are comparable to our other graphene devices on YIG or SiO 2 [18], which confirms that the basic spin transport properties of graphene are conserved after transfer to YIG.The device is shown in figures 1(b) and (c).

        <p>In summary, we have demonstrated the detection of ferromagnetic exchange field in graphene by spin transport at room temperature, 75 and 4.7 K. The exchange field strength is quantified in two different experimental configurations to be approximately 0.2 T. Given the theoretical results on idealised systems, substantial enhancement should be possible by appropriate interface optimisation [16]. We proposed spin-transport measurements as the most direct way to study the exchange field in graphene. Furthermore, we showed that a spin current can be efficiently modulated by controlling the exchange field, which opens up new directions to control spins in graphene based spintronic devices.In summary, we have demonstrated the detection of ferromagnetic exchange field in graphene by spin transport at room temperature, 75 and 4.7 K.

Single layer graphene flakes are selected by optical contrast and transferred to target substrates with a custom-built transfer stage using a polycarbonate based pickup technique.
