        <p>In this paper we study further properties of this distinguished perturbation. We discuss how it affects the energy levels and one-point functions of a general 2D QFT in finite volume through a surprising relation with a simple hydrodynamic equation. In the case of the perturbation of CFTs, adapting a result by Lüscher and Weisz we give a compact expression for the partition function on a finite-length cylinder and make a connection with the exact g-function method. We argue that, at the classical level, the deformation naturally maps the action of N massless free bosons into the Nambu-Goto action in static gauge, in N + 2 target space dimensions, and we briefly discuss a possible interpretation of this result in the context of effective string models.In this paper we study further properties of this distinguished perturbation.

        <p>The discovery of a connection between the exact S-matrix method, the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) [5] and the effective string theory description of the chromoelectric flux tube in confining gauge theories is a further surprising result recently obtained within the integrable model setup [6,7]. In particular, it has been discovered that the finite-size spectrum of a theory of free massless bosons modified by the inclusion of a very simple scalar scattering phase (CDD factor) can be computed exactly with the TBA method and that its JHEP10(2016)112 analytic form is precisely the well-known expressions for the energy levels of the Nambu-Goto model obtained in the early days of string theory via covariant quantization [8]. This idea was readily adapted in [9] to encompass the open string case, a framework more directly relevant to the study of the quark-anti-quark potential. In the same paper, the setup was generalised to describe the deformation, via the same CDD factor, of an arbitrary 2D conformal field theory (CFT). A tight link was observed to previous studies on massless RG flows with leading IR attracting operator given by the T T composite operator built with the chiral and anti-chiral components of the CFT stress-energy tensor (see [10][11][12][13][14]).

The CDD factor (1.2) was introduced in [20] as a generalization of the proposal of [6] to theories with more than one particle species. It was first pointed out in [9] that this deformation corresponds to perturbing the CFT theory with a series of irrelevant operators whose leading term is T T. As we shall discuss in this paper, the introduction of the phase factor in the nonlinear integral equations describing the spectrum at finite-size leads to a characteristic deformation of the energy levels as t is varied, which flows according to the inviscid Burgers equation of hydrodynamics. Further, the wave-breaking phenomenon, typical of the solutions to this simple fluid equation, is seen to correspond to the appearance of a spectral singularity at physical values of the system size: the famous tachyon singularity of effective string theories. While the specific form of the deformation of the spectrum was obtained for integrable theories, the result is strongly connected to the general properties of the T T operator studied in [18], suggesting that the JHEP10(2016)112 latter results might have a broader range of validity. Indeed, we believe that the formula for the deformation of the energy levels is universal and valid also for non-integrable theories deformed by the T T composite field. 2 However, without a precise characterization, at least at the level of an effective action, of the deformed theory, this might seem a void statement. It was put forward in [9] that the full effective action might be obtainable by a universal method involving the recursive re-definition of the stress-energy tensor. In this paper, we show that this idea can be realized (although with some subtle variation). We demonstrate this by reconstructing the full Nambu-Goto action in D dimensions in static gauge starting from the action of D -2 free massless bosons; we also apply the same method to single boson Lagrangians with generic potential. Next, we use an idea first proposed by Lüscher and Weisz [22] to reconstruct the cylinder partition function of t-deformed rational CFTs, linking the result to the exact g-function formula proposed for massless TBA flows in [23].

        <p>Finally, we would like to mention that, while we were working on this project, F. Smirnov and A. B.

        <p>The study of 2D quantum field theories perturbed by irrelevant operators is still a largely unexplored research topic. These perturbations may lead to singular RG flows where the UV fixed point is not well-defined. An important arena where such flows appear prominently is the study of effective string theories, such as the ones used to describe confining flux tubes in non-Abelian gauge theories. Recently, some of the powerful tools associated to integrable models have made an appearance in this context, suggesting that exact results can be obtained for some of these irrelevant deformations. In this paper we investigated some general exact properties of a class of such flows related to the T T composite operator.

These equations were deduced using integrable models tools, such as the TBA and the NLIE, together with Zamolodchikov's formula in [18], but can be considered as a definition of a special way of deforming an arbitrary QFT, irrespective of integrability. Moreover, under such a deformation, the energy levels evolve according to the simple hydrodynamic equation (4.12), where the deformation parameter t enters as a formal time variable.

        <p>We feel that research on this topic may clarify important aspects concerning the appearance of singularities in effective QFT, and hopefully be useful in the effective string framework. It is well known that the flux tube spectrum is very well approximated, at relative large inter-quark separation, by the formula (2.12) or by its open-string analogous, but deviations are observed at intermediate length scales (see, for example [55] for a nice up-to-date compact review). Particularly interesting is the idea that also massive excitations could propagate on the flux-tube. It would be wonderful if TCSA could help to find a precise perturbed CFT interpretation of the pseudoscalar particle whose presence on the 4D QCD flux tube was recently conjectured on the basis of numerical data and TBA-inspired computations [7], or the massive mode discovered through Monte Carlo simulations in the 3D U(1) gauge-theory [56].We feel that research on this topic may clarify important aspects concerning the appearance of singularities in effective QFT, and hopefully be useful in the effective string framework.

        <p>Furthermore, the light-cone spectrum is known to be incompatible with Lorentz invariance in the D-dimensional target space, except for the cases D = 3 and D = 26. In particular, a universal deviation from the spectrum (2.12) is observed at order O(1/R 5 ) (for the excited states), when the string is quantized preserving target-space Lorentz invariance [57] (see also [55,58,59] for reviews). For this reason, we find remarkable that within the current setup, a direct correspondence between the spectrum (2.12) and the Nambu-Goto action written in static gauge is established in an arbitrary dimension. 6 A possible explanation is suggested by the fact that perturbative calculations in [58] using the static-gauge action with a continuum, strictly two-dimensional regularization scheme show that the light-cone spectrum is reproduced at least up to -and including -order O(1/R 5 ). The approach taken in this paper is indeed strictly two-dimensional, suggesting that, within the same class of schemes, the result is valid at all orders. 7Coming back to the problem of target space Lorentz invariance, from the point of view of the current setup one may try to enforce this symmetry by adding further irrelevant operators, associated to corrections of the S-matrix, on top of the T T-related ones considered in this paper. The form of the extra phase shift proposed in [61] for the D = 4 case seems to suggest that the first additional perturbing operator is related to odd-spin symmetry generators, perhaps associated to some extended symmetry such as the W 3 -algebra of the three states Potts model [62]. Despite obvious complications, it would be nice to study this issue and understand if the current approach can at least partially be modified to better approximate Lorentz-invariant effective string models.Furthermore, the light-cone spectrum is known to be incompatible with Lorentz invariance in the D-dimensional target space, except for the cases D = 3 and D = 26.
