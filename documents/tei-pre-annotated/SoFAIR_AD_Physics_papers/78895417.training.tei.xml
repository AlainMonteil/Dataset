        <p>Traditional wave kinetics describes the slow evolution of systems with many degrees of freedom to equilibrium via numerous weak non-linear interactions and fails for very important class of dissipative (active) optical systems with cyclic gain and losses, such as lasers with non-linear intracavity dynamics. Here we introduce a conceptually new class of cyclic wave systems, characterized by non-uniform double-scale dynamics with strong periodic changes of the energy spectrum and slow evolution from cycle to cycle to a statistically steady state. Taking a practically important example-random fibre laser-we show that a model describing such a system is close to integrable non-linear Schro ¨dinger equation and needs a new formalism of wave kinetics, developed here. We derive a non-linear kinetic theory of the laser spectrum, generalizing the seminal linear model of Schawlow and Townes. Experimental results agree with our theory. The work has implications for describing kinetics of cyclical systems beyond photonics.Traditional wave kinetics describes the slow evolution of systems with many degrees of freedom to equilibrium via numerous weak non-linear interactions and fails for very important class of dissipative (active) optical systems with cyclic gain and losses, such as lasers with non-linear intracavity dynamics.

        <p>The challenge becomes evident for a laser, one of the most interesting and arduous optical systems from a theoretical point of view. A vast number of various laser theories have been formulated for different gain mechanisms and cavity types (see, for example, refs 9,10 and the references therein).

For cavity-free systems, such as random lasers [11][12][13][14][15] , dynamical models become complicated due to the co-existence of localized and extended modes and strong interactions between them [16][17][18] .The challenge becomes evident for a laser, one of the most interesting and arduous optical systems from a theoretical point of view.

        <p>A fibre laser typically features a very large number of longitudinal modes weakly interacting via Kerr non-linearity. Such laser is, in essence, a natural active cyclic system having a double-scale kinetic evolution. Indeed, in fibre lasers due to gain and loss non-homogeneity over the spatial coordinate along the cavity, the fast evolution of the laser spectrum within each cavity round trip (cycle) is subject to strong changes. At the same time, the light evolves slowly from one round trip to another approaching some statistical equilibrium state. Owing to a complex nature of such kinetic processes, there is no yet a general theory that quantitatively describes spectra of radiation of fibre lasers, despite their wide practical use.A fibre laser typically features a very large number of longitudinal modes weakly interacting via Kerr non-linearity.

        <p>In this work, we introduce a new conceptual framework to describe cyclic wave kinetics of fibre lasers modelled by dissipative modifications of the integrable non-linear Schro ¨dinger equation. This allows us to formulate the first-ever non-linear kinetic theory of laser radiation and describe, as an important practical example, an optical spectrum of a random fibre laser 19 . Since the system is close to integrable, we find very non-trivial kinetics, which makes for the conceptual novelty of our approach.In this work, we introduce a new conceptual framework to describe cyclic wave kinetics of fibre lasers modelled by dissipative modifications of the integrable non-linear Schro ¨dinger equation.

        <p>Wave kinetic equation for fibre lasers. Kinetic theory describes an average (macroscopic) probabilistic evolution of complex system. Starting from basic microscopic dynamic equations governing the interaction of elementary constituents (for example, particles or waves), the kinetic description effectively reduces a large number of degrees of freedom in the original nonlinear system by implying some assumptions about statistics of fluctuations. In the context of a wave system, the kinetic equation describes an evolution of quantities that are averages over times exceeding wave periods. In this case, waves with different frequencies acquire different phases enabling treating them as approximately independent at averaging.

        <p>In traditional wave kinetics, initial (arbitrary) wave spectrum F o evolves in a gradual way through cascades of numerous weak non-linear interactions towards a statistical steady state, as illustrated by Fig. 1a. The evolution from initial to asymptotically stationary spectrum is governed by the wave kinetic equation 4 . The long-time asymptotic state is steady both globally and locally meaning that statistical properties do not change at any arbitrary time shift. This is achieved when the external pumping of energy into the system and dumping of energy out of the system are time independent.In traditional wave kinetics, initial (arbitrary) wave spectrum F o evolves in a gradual way through cascades of numerous weak non-linear interactions towards a statistical steady state, as illustrated by Fig. 1a.

        <p>In fibre laser, radiation undergoes strong periodic (cyclic) changes along the cavity due to combined action of gain, loss, dispersion and non-linearity, superimposed on a slow evolution from one round trip to another. The global statistical equilibrium still may exist in terms of the Poincare mapping 20 as a state that is statistically reproduced after each round trip. However, contrary to the case of systems homogenous over evolution variable, a local statistically steady state does not exist, meaning that the wave spectrum is changed substantially at any arbitrary time shift. As a result, two scales over evolution coordinate do exist in laser systems-a fast evolution within each round trip, and slow evolution from cycle to cycle. This results in non-uniform spirallike evolution that differs from a monotonic relaxation in classical wave kinetics, as schematically depicted in Fig. 1b. It is important that the amplitudes of waves could be sufficiently increased or decreased during the fast evolution within each round trip depending on either the pumping or dumping being dominant at particular moment in a laser cavity. So the classical wave kinetic approach cannot be directly applied to the typical fibre lasers as the strong local (quasi periodic) dynamics of the wave spectrum must be taken into account.In fibre laser, radiation undergoes strong periodic (cyclic) changes along the cavity due to combined action of gain, loss, dispersion and non-linearity, superimposed on a slow evolution from one round trip to another.

        <p>There are several principal differences between the wave kinetic equation (3) for the active cyclic system and a classical wave kinetic equation. First of all, as the energy pumping and dumping is non-homogenous over the evolution coordinate z within the cycle, the wave spectrum exhibits strong changes during the evolution within the cycle, so the local stationary statistically steady state does not exist. Formally that means one cannot equate the derivative over evolution coordinate z to zero and find in this way a stationary solution similar to classical wave kinetics. The traditional wave kinetic equation for a conservative Hamiltonian system could be obtained from the local wave kinetic equation (3) in the limit of zero gain. In this case, the gainrelated Lorentzian terms g a;b;c =ðg 2 a;b;c þ F 2 Þ in the right-hand side of equation ( 3) turn into delta-functions, ensuring the energy conservation and giving the classical kinetic wave equation. However, the classical kinetic equation derived from NLSE is trivial in a sense that the right-hand side vanishes because of integrability of one-dimensional NLSE 27 . In other words, in NLSE-based integrable system, the spectrum does not evolve at all. This is not the case for local wave kinetic equation (3). From the formal point of view, wave interaction is uniform over slow evolution time 4 in classical wave kinetics. In active cyclic systems, however, these interactions are mediated by a non-homogenous gain (see Lorentzian factors due to gain in equation ( 3)), which results in the interaction being effective over the finite interval of the evolution coordinate only. Note that equation (3) does not conserve momentum, because the pumping and dumping are changed over the evolution coordinate z. We would like to also note that an interesting modification of the conventional wave turbulence kinetic equation was studied in the paper by Ascheri et al. 28 , where the integrability of the original NLSE model was broken by the transverse spatial inhomogeneity of the refraction index.There are several principal differences between the wave kinetic equation (3) for the active cyclic system and a classical wave kinetic equation.

High above the generation threshold, the random fibre laser spectrum demonstrates non-linear kinetic broadening. The spectrum shape is perfectly described by our theory Fig. 3a. Moreover, the theory describes the laser's spectrum broadening law over the pump power Fig. 3b (red line).</p>
        <p>Besides the non-linear kinetic contribution to the wave spectrum, well pronounced at high power, there is also a linear kinetic contribution dominant at low powers. Indeed, it is well known from the seminal work of Schawlow and Townes 31 that the laser spectrum exhibits spectral narrowing while the pump power increases above the generation threshold. The spectral narrowing is observed in random fibre laser spectrum as well (see Fig. 3b. However, the approach of Schawlow and Townes 31 can be used only for laser cavities having distinct well-defined cavity modes, which is not the case for the random fibre laser having modeless, that is, continuous spectrum. To deal with that, we modify the approach of Schawlow-Townes and derive the equation describing spectrum narrowing of the random fibre laser at low power (see Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Note 6 and Supplementary Equation 45). Its solution, Supplementary Equation 47, describes well the experimentally observed optical spectrum narrowing near the generation threshold Fig. 3b, inset.Besides the non-linear kinetic contribution to the wave spectrum, well pronounced at high power, there is also a linear kinetic contribution dominant at low powers.

        <p>Note that as a matter of fact, the Supplementary Equation 45 is a linear kinetic equation valid at lower powers where one can neglect the non-linear interactions between different spectral components. In this sense, the local wave kinetic equation, equation (3), describing the non-linear spectrum broadening high above the generation threshold, is the extension of the Schawlow-Townes equation to the non-linear mode interaction case. The real optical spectrum has both-linear and non-linear-contributions. The sum of linear and non-linear terms describes well the experimentally measured laser spectrum width in all power range Fig. 3b. The small residual difference between the theory and the experimental data could be attributed to the influence of the pump wave induced cross-phase modulation (XPM) effect. The estimate gives the value of XPM induced spectral width of 0.2 nm at low power.Note that as a matter of fact, the Supplementary Equation 45 is a linear kinetic equation valid at lower powers where one can neglect the non-linear interactions between different spectral components.

        <p>The general formalism of wave kinetics of active cyclic systems presented here could be applied for various optical systems where stochasticity is important, such as random lasers of other types, lasers with open or unstable resonators, multi-mode lasers with very large number of generation modes and other systems. However, our theoretical formalism for statistics of cyclic active systems can have implications far beyond photonics. To give the example most close to heart: within every heartbeat from diastole to systole, there are substantial and complicated changes of the blood flow-when one starts to run, it takes many heartbeats for a system to evolve into a new state. The world is full of such systems, non-Hamiltonian in their nature, which evolve to the statistical equilibrium in cycles as external energy pumping and dumping occurs in a periodic way; for instance, day and year cycles in meteorology, long-haul fibre transmission links, lasers, Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities in various media (water, atmosphere, coatings in surfaces). Our work shows a direction for describing such systems-considering slow evolution of the respective correlation function averaged over several cycles.The general formalism of wave kinetics of active cyclic systems presented here could be applied for various optical systems where stochasticity is important, such as random lasers of other types, lasers with open or unstable resonators, multi-mode lasers with very large number of generation modes and other systems.

        <p>Experimental set-up. In brief, the random fibre laser comprises a pump source at 1,115 nm coupled to 850 m of a phosphosilicate fibre. The laser generates near 1,308 nm. We minimize the length of the random fibre laser to keep the pump nearly undepleted and maintain a low non-linearity factor, which is actually the ratio of the generation power to the pump power. The shorter the length, the higher the generation threshold, and, therefore, the higher pump power at given generation power. To compare the non-linear kinetic laser theory predictions with experimental data, we measure all fibre parameters except non-linearity coefficient that is known from the literature. The coefficients are linear losses a ¼ 0.09 km -1 , dispersion coefficient b ¼ 4.3 ps 2 km -1 , g ¼ 7 (km W) -1 , Raman gain coefficient g R ¼ 0.68 (kmW) -1 .Experimental set-up.
