        <p>We present a spectroscopic survey of galaxies in the COSMOS field using the Fiber Multi-object Spectrograph (FMOS), a near-infrared instrument on the Subaru Telescope. Our survey is specifically designed to detect the Hα emission line that falls within the H-band (1.6-1.8 μm) spectroscopic window from star-forming galaxies with 1.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.7 and M stellar  10 10 M e . With the high multiplex capability of FMOS, it is now feasible to construct samples of over 1000 galaxies having spectroscopic redshifts at epochs that were previously challenging. The high-resolution mode (R ∼ 2600) effectively separates Hα and [N II]λ6585, thus enabling studies of the gas-phase metallicity and photoionization state of the interstellar medium. The primary aim of our program is to establish how star formation depends on stellar mass and environment, both recognized as drivers of galaxy evolution at lower redshifts. In addition to the main galaxy sample, our target selection places priority on those detected in the far-infrared by Herschel/PACS to assess the level of obscured star formation and investigate, in detail, outliers from the star formation rate (SFR)-stellar mass relation. Galaxies with Hα detections are followed up with FMOS observations at shorter wavelengths using the J-long (1.11-1.35 μm) grating to detect Hβ and [O III]λ5008 which provides an assessment of the extinction required to measure SFRs not hampered by dust, and an indication of embedded active galactic nuclei. With 460 redshifts measured from 1153 spectra, we assess the performance of the instrument with respect to achieving our goals, discuss inherent biases in the sample, and detail the emission-line properties. Our higher-level data products, including catalogs and spectra, are available to the community.We present a spectroscopic survey of galaxies in the COSMOS field using the Fiber Multi-object Spectrograph (FMOS), a near-infrared instrument on the Subaru Telescope.

        <p>Over the last few years, a clearer picture has started to emerge on how galaxies are built up with cosmic time. These developments are primarily afforded by the remarkable wealth of multi-wavelength imaging that telescopes have provided, from both space and the ground, together with optical spectroscopic surveys (e.g., SDSS, VVDS, zCOSMOS, DEEP2) that have amassed samples ranging from several thousands to over a million galaxies. This continuously expanding database provides a map of the galaxy distribution up to z ∼ 2 (and beyond), and enables a measure of their intrinsic properties such as their stellar mass, ongoing star formation rate (SFR), and information on their stellar populations such as ages and the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium. As a consequence, it has been recognized that at least to z ∼ 3 most galaxies are either star-forming or had their star formation quenched while subsequently evolving in a passive mode. The fraction of the latter rapidly drops beyond z ∼ 1 although most galaxies at high masses (M stellar  10 11 M e ) are quenched at least up to z ∼ 2 (e.g., Williams et al. 2009;Cassata et al. 2013). On the other hand, most star-forming galaxies cluster around a relatively tight SFR-stellar mass relation, that came to be called the main sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies (e.g., Daddi et al. 2007;Elbaz et al. 2007;Noeske et al. 2007;Wuyts et al. 2011;Speagle et al. 2014), whereas relatively few outliers, toward high specific SFR from the MS (∼2% by number), appear to be experiencing a starburst episode (Rodighiero et al. 2011;Sargent et al. 2012), possibly triggered by a merging event (e.g., Kartaltepe et al. 2012). For both the star-forming and quenched populations, the mass functions have been measured with fair accuracy to high redshift (e.g., Bundy et al. 2006;Fontana et al. 2009;Ilbert et al. 2010Ilbert et al. , 2013;;Grazian et al. 2015) and the fraction of quenched galaxies has been mapped as a function of stellar mass and, up to z ∼ 1, also of local environment (Peng et al. 2010(Peng et al. , 2012;;Scoville et al. 2013).Over the last few years, a clearer picture has started to emerge on how galaxies are built up with cosmic time.

        <p>At z &gt; 1, our understanding of the influence of the local environment on star-forming galaxies, based on spectroscopic surveys, is mainly limited to small samples of groups or massive clusters. However, studies based on large spectroscopic efforts have begun to construct significant samples of galaxy over-densities at these higher redshift (Gerke et al. 2012;Diener et al. 2013) using surveys such as zCOSMOS and DEEP2. Although, there has been a wide gap at 1.4 z 1.8, namely the redshift desert as it came to be called, which historically proved to be the most difficult redshift regime for optical spectroscopic surveys to penetrate (see Figure 13 of Le Fèvre et al. 2015). This is primarily the result of strong spectral features (e.g., the 4000 Å break and emission lines such as Hα, [O III]λ5008 and [O II]λ3727) having moved to the near-IR, hence to measure redshifts optical spectroscopy had to rely only on weak absorption lines detected in rest-frame ultraviolet (e.g., Lilly et al. 2007) or carry out deep and observationally expensive campaigns (Cimatti et al. 2008;Le Fèvre et al. 2015). Until recently, this wide critical "slice" of our universe, precisely at the peak cosmic epoch in galaxy growth and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, has not yet been adequately mapped by spectroscopic surveys.At z &gt; 1, our understanding of the influence of the local environment on star-forming galaxies, based on spectroscopic surveys, is mainly limited to small samples of groups or massive clusters.

        <p>Near-infrared instruments on large-aperture telescopes with high multiplex capabilities are providing the means for surveys to fill such a gap in redshift space. The Fiber Multi-object Spectrograph (FMOS; Kimura et al. 2010) at the prime focus of the Subaru Telescope is designed specifically for this purpose. With 400 fibers spread over a field of view of 30′ in diameter, it is now possible to carry out a redshift survey of a thousand galaxies, practically unfeasible with previous near-infrared instruments. There also exists a complementary capability with Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/WFC3 in grism mode that benefits from avoiding atmospheric contamination; although, its field of view is substantially smaller than that of FMOS thus preventing surveys (e.g., Wuyts et al. 2013;Price et al. 2014) from covering a large enough volume thus limiting the dynamic range in environment. The CANDELS field within COSMOS is an example of this since the area coverage is smaller than a single FMOS pointing (Figure 1) thus not capable of including rare objects (i.e., massive galaxies and AGNs). Equally important, the high spectral resolution of FMOS is suitable to separate Hα and [N II]λ6550, 6585 (not possible with the low resolution grism spectra from HST/ WFC3), hence measuring gas phase metallicity and providing an indication of AGN activity when coupled with spectral coverage of Hβ and [O III]λ5008. Other multi-object spectroscopic facilities such as KMOS on ESO's Very Large Telescope (Sharples et al. 2013), MOSFIRE (McLean et al. 2012) on Keck, and MOIRCS (Onodera et al. 2012) on Subaru nicely complement the wide-field capabilities of FMOS due to their high sensitivity, thus reaching the fainter galaxy population, although over a substantially smaller area.Near-infrared instruments on large-aperture telescopes with high multiplex capabilities are providing the means for surveys to fill such a gap in redshift space.

        <p>In this paper, we present the design and observational results of a large near-infrared spectroscopic survey targeting starforming galaxies at 1.4  z  1.7 in COSMOS (Scoville et al. 2007) using Subaru/FMOS. This is a joint effort based on a "Subaru Intensive Program" (PI J. Silverman) approved by NAOJ and a program awarded through the University of Hawaii, Institute for Astronomy (PI D. Sanders). The early Hband observations presented here include seven nights awarded by NOAJ to carry out a pilot study and a subsequent Intensive Program. The observations acquired through UH have focused on the J-band followup of the positive Hα detections from the H-band observations to provide the full suite of key emission lines of galaxies (Kartaltepe et al. 2015).In this paper, we present the design and observational results of a large near-infrared spectroscopic survey targeting starforming galaxies at 1.4  z  1.7 in COSMOS (Scoville et al. 2007) using Subaru/FMOS.

        <p>Our broad aim is to advance our understanding of galaxy evolution at this most active epoch by obtaining accurate measurements of SFR, extinction, metallicity, AGN identification and providing a characterization of the environment that only spectroscopic redshifts can accomplish. Our program makes use of the high-resolution mode to cleanly separate Hα and [N II] as detected in the H band. Follow-up observations are also acquired for a subset of targets to detect Hβ and [O III] λ5008 in the J band, thus providing an extinction correction based on the (1) Hα to Hβ ratio (i.e., Balmer decrement), (2) an indication of the photoionization state of the ISM, and (3) an improved measurement of metallicity. While the first results are public (Kashino et al. 2013;Rodighiero et al. 2014;Zahid et al. 2014b), herein we fully detail the survey design including the observing strategy and target selection. We explicitly demonstrate inherent biases in the sample such as that induced by a limit on the expected Hα flux that was imposed a priori to increase the likelihood of an emission-line detection. With 1153 FMOS spectra in hand, we present the effectiveness of our target selection as a function of key parameters and provide a catalog of emission-line properties including spectroscopic redshifts with a detailed assessment of their accuracy. With respect to the latter point, the zCOSMOS deep sample (Lilly et al. 2007) allows us to perform an independent check on the FMOS redshifts. The paper is organized with the following sections: survey design (Section 3), target selection (Sections 4 and 5), induced selection biases (Section 6), observations and data reduction (Section 7), emission-line fitting (Section 8), determination of spectroscopic redshifts (Section 9), description of our catalog (Section 10), and emission-line properties (Section 11). Finally, we conclude with our plans to acquire a final sample of over 1000 galaxies in COSMOS with 1.4  z  1.7 having spectroscopic redshifts (based on FMOS highresolution spectra) thus enabling us to significantly improve upon the density field and our investigation of galaxy properties as a function of environment. We also highlight that our earlier and complementary effort to build a large sample of galaxies with IR spectra using FMOS in lowresolution mode in the COSMOS field is well underway (Matsuoka et al. 2013;Kartaltepe et al. 2015) with the full details of the survey to be presented in a forthcoming paper (J. Kartaltepe et al. 2015, in preparation). Throughout this work, we assume H 0 = 70 km s -1 Mpc -1 , Ω Λ = 0.75, Ω M = 0.25, AB magnitudes and a Salpeter initial mass function.Our broad aim is to advance our understanding of galaxy evolution at this most active epoch by obtaining accurate measurements of SFR, extinction, metallicity, AGN identification and providing a characterization of the environment that only spectroscopic redshifts can accomplish.

        <p>FMOS (Kimura et al. 2010) on the Subaru Telescope is paving the way for surveys of high-redshift galaxies (Roseboom et al. 2012;Yabe et al. 2012Yabe et al. , 2014;;Okada et al. 2015;Tonegawa et al. 2015) and AGNs (Nobuta et al. 2012;Brightman et al. 2013;Matsuoka et al. 2013). Such progress is afforded by the ability to simultaneously acquire near-infrared spectra for about 200 galaxies (over a circular region of 30′ in diameter) when implementing the cross-beam switching (CBS) mode, a technique that dithers targets between fiber pairs effectively measuring the sky background spatially close to individual objects and through the same fibers as the science targets. Each fiber is 1″. 2 in diameter ideal for high-redshift targets observed under typical seeing conditions (∼0″. 7) at the summit of Mauna Kea. An OH-airglow suppression filter (Maihara et al. 1994;Iwamuro et al. 2001) masks out strong atmospheric emission lines that usually plague the J band and H band at the expense of losing ∼25% of spectral coverage. This fraction of lost pixels will come into the discussion later to explain the number of non-detections with respect to the Hα emission line.FMOS (Kimura et al. 2010) on the Subaru Telescope is paving the way for surveys of high-redshift galaxies (Roseboom et al. 2012;Yabe et al. 2012Yabe et al. , 2014;;Okada et al. 2015;Tonegawa et al. 2015) and AGNs (Nobuta et al. 2012;Brightman et al. 2013;Matsuoka et al. 2013).

        <p>While some of the early studies mentioned above were carried out in a low spectral resolution mode, FMOS has been operational in a high-resolution mode since the spring of 2012 (S12A). There is an overall improvement in system throughput by a factor of ∼3 due to the removal of the VPH grating required for low-resolution observations. The spectral resolution in high-resolution mode is λ/Δλ ≈ 260019 in the H band that cleanly separates Hα and [N II]λ6585 and has a velocity resolution FWHM ∼ 115 km s -1 . Four high-resolution gratings are designed to provide contiguous spectral coverage over the full J (J-short: 0.92-1.12 μm, J-long: 1.11-1.35 μm) and H (Hshort: 1.40-1.60 μm, H-long: 1.60-1.80 μm) bands. We refer the reader to Kimura et al. (2010) for further details of the instrument and its performance.While some of the early studies mentioned above were carried out in a low spectral resolution mode, FMOS has been operational in a high-resolution mode since the spring of 2012 (S12A).

        <p>We designate the central square degree20 of the COSMOS field as our spectroscopic survey area to benefit from the rich multi-wavelength efforts. In particular, the zCOSMOS Deep program (Lilly et al. 2007) has acquired ∼500 quality spectroscopic redshifts within our redshift range of interest. With a field of view of 0.19 square degrees, four FMOS footprints cover the central area (Figure 1 and Table 1). Each footprint is observed multiple times to increase the spatial sampling necessary to measure galaxy clustering with projected pair separations reaching down to ∼200 kpc (D. Kashino et al. 2015, in preparation). Galaxies slightly outside the FMOS field of view, shown in Figure 1, are targeted as a result of the fibers having a considerable angular patrol area.We designate the central square degree20 of the COSMOS field as our spectroscopic survey area to benefit from the rich multi-wavelength efforts.

        <p>The Hα emission line is the key spectral feature for redshift determination and an indicator of star formation (Kennicutt 1998). With the H-long grating, we observe a wavelength range of 1.6-1.8 μm, capable of detecting Hα for galaxies with 1.43 &lt; z &lt; 1.74. This redshift range is chosen specifically to take advantage of the fact that the H-long grating has the highest throughput among the FMOS gratings (see Figure 19 of Kimura et al. 2010). The detection of [N II]λ6585 emission lends further confidence in the redshift measurement and is used to estimate the gas-phase metallicity. The width of the line profile yields insight into the kinematics of the line-emitting gas as a result of our velocity resolution. For example, velocitybroadened lines may further indicate the presence of galactic outflows or underlying AGNs as identified by components having velocity widths substantially higher than expected for star-forming galaxies.The Hα emission line is the key spectral feature for redshift determination and an indicator of star formation (Kennicutt 1998).

        <p>A second layer of our survey is to re-observe galaxies (with positive Hα detections) using the J-long grating, that covers a wavelength range of 1.11-1.35 μm, to detect the Hβ and [O III] λ5008 emission lines. To alleviate the substantial demand on Subaru for this purpose, we are collaborating with the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii Manoa (PI Dave Sanders) to supplement our observations acquired through the intensive program. Exposure times are comparable to the H-long observations. The detection of additional emission lines provides a consistency check on the accuracy of the spectroscopic redshifts.

For each galaxy, the broadband photometry is fit using LePhare (Arnouts &amp; Ilbert 2011) with population synthesis models (BC03; see Ilbert et al. 2009Ilbert et al. , 2013, for further details) to derive accurate photometric redshifts that are crucial to establish their intrinsic properties such as stellar mass, SFR and color excess. Our scheme for target selection of the main sample (i.e., massive, star-forming galaxies) is devised to achieve our scientific goals while maximizing the efficiency with respect to detecting Hα in the FMOS IR spectroscopic window. We list the specific selection limits applied to the parent photometric catalogs (further elaborated below) including refinements that have been implemented for the intensive program. To reiterate, we use stellar masses and SFRs based on a Salpeter initial mass function.

Using the FMOS exposure time calculator for an initial estimate, a threshold of 4 × 10 -17 erg s -1 cm -2 is set to detect a line (integrated across a profile of FWHM = 300 km s -1 ) with a significance greater than 3σ. This emission-line limit is equivalent to a SFR of ∼10 M e yr -1 for galaxies at z ∼ 1.6 (Kashino et al. 2013). While a consideration of the spatial extent of the targets and the size of the fiber aperture is practical, we neglected to do so for the initial observations given various uncertainties at the time concerning the performance of the instrument.We further select galaxies having a prediction of their Hα emission-line flux (based on SFRs and dust corrections as derived from the broadband photometry) above a specific threshold to maximize the success rate of line detection.

        <p>We made a number of additional changes to the selection. With respect to predicting the level of Hα emission, the intrinsic SFR for the intensive program is derived from a fit to the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) in contrast to using solely the B J -band luminosity (corrected for extinction). This is based on the assumption of a constant star formation history that has been shown to return a SFR similar to that derived from the rest-frame UV band (e.g., Rodighiero et al. 2014). As shown in the top panel of Figure 3, there is a direct one-to-one relation between the SED-and the UVbased SFRs with scatter at the level of σ = 0.20. The color excess E B V star ( ) is also derived from the full SED fitting routine as opposed to being based on a single color Bz. There is some concern that the E star (B -V) output from the SED fitting may not effectively discriminate between dust extinction and stellar age. In the lower panel of the same figure, there is a clear correspondence in the the level of extinction assessed from both methods. However, the stellar extinction based on a single color is slightly higher by about ∼0.05 than that returned from the global SED fit, although not severe enough to affect our predictions of the Hα flux and impact our redshift success rate. At the expense of slightly lowering the success rate, we perform no additional screening of the sample, such as considering errors on SFR, to refrain from further removing heavily obscured galaxies.We made a number of additional changes to the selection.

We reserve the study of the rest-frame optical emission lines of the X-ray AGNs to subsequent works, particularly since the line profiles are more complex than the star-forming galaxies.</p>

We discontinued the observations of the low-mass galaxies after S12A to achieve a higher completeness for the more massive (M stellar  10 10 M e ) galaxies.When possible, we placed a limited number of fibers on low mass star-forming galaxies (1.4 &lt; z phot &lt; 1.7) to fill all the free fibers primarily during the pilot program (S12A).

        <p>There are induced constraints on the characteristics of the observed sample due to the imposition of a limit on the Hα flux expected to be detected with FMOS. In particular, this will bias the sample by placing greater weight on galaxies having higher SFRs, and lower levels of extinction. In Figure 6, we illustrate the magnitude of the effect by comparing the distributions of SFR (in bins of stellar mass and color excess) for the parent and observed samples. The top two panels (a)-(b) show the distribution of the expected total (i.e., galaxy-wide) Hα flux split into two mass bins (9.8 &lt; log M stellar &lt; 10.7, 10.7 &lt; log M stellar &lt; 11.5).

        <p>It is then imperative to establish the degree to which the emission-line flux limit shapes the distribution of SFR at a given stellar mass. In Figures 6 (c)-(f), we show the SED-based SFR distributions in the equivalent mass bins as given above. For this analysis, we illustrate the effect by simply plotting the distributions with (solid histogram) and without (dashed histogram) a cut on emission-line flux. We show the results of this exercise for two different Hα flux limits since we carried out the pilot survey with a flux limit of 4 × 10 -17 erg s -1 cm -2 (panels (c)-(d)) and then placed more weight on those with a limit of 1 × 10 -16 erg s -1 cm -2 for the remainder of the survey (panels (e)-(f)). As in the top two panels, we compare the distributions for galaxies of varying extinction based on their color excess. We see that the self-imposed flux limit has an impact on the sample selection, differently in each bin of mass and extinction. All panels (c)-(f) clearly demonstrate that the emission-line limit has a stronger effect on those with higher levels of extinction. The consequences are an increase in the mean SFRs and a narrower width of the SFR distribution within each given mass range. In particular, the dispersion in SFR for the sample with 9.8 &lt; log M stellar &lt; 10.7 and a limit on SFRs for PACS sources are based on 160 μm fluxes. Galaxies observed with FMOS are marked in color indicative of whether a spectroscopic redshift was attained (same labels as in Figure 2). Herschel/PACS sources that not observed are marked as black circles. For comparison, we include the larger star-forming galaxy sample (small gray dots) with SFRs derived from SED fitting as described in the text. f Hα &gt; 4 × 10 -17 erg s -1 cm -2 ; panels (e)-(f): f Hα &gt; 1 × 10 -16 erg s -1 cm -2 ) for each bin of color excess. the expected Hα flux (&gt;4 × 10 -17 erg s -1 cm -2 ) is a factor of 1.4 smaller than the parent population. A slightly smaller factor of 1.3 is measured for the higher mass bin. This correction factor is likely applicable to a distribution of Hα-based SFRs since we find very good agreement between these SFR indicators (Rodighiero et al. 2014) for MS galaxies. Any assessment of the intrinsic characteristics of the SFR-stellar mass relation using our sample will need to consider the magnitude of these effects as done in Speagle et al. (2014). Although, it remains to be established whether these SFR distributions, shown in Figure 6, are accurate in terms of their width that can be assessed by using an alternative indicator of star formation activity, namely, the Hα emission line that is one of the key science drivers of our program.It is then imperative to establish the degree to which the emission-line flux limit shapes the distribution of SFR at a given stellar mass.

        <p>For further illustrative purposes, we plot in Figure 7 the distribution of E B V star ( ) and isolate those expected to have an Hα emission line above our cut and those actually observed through our FMOS program. Both panels indicate that our sample is less representative of the intrinsic population with higher levels of extinction especially where E B V ( ) is above 0.5. We note that our final sample with spectroscopic redshifts, provided by FMOS, will inevitably be biased by having detected Hα, hence it will be an Hα-selected sample; however, we provide limits on Hα emission for an effective mass-selected subset having spectroscopic redshifts available by other means.For further illustrative purposes, we plot in Figure 7 the distribution of E B V star ( ) and isolate those expected to have an Hα emission line above our cut and those actually observed through our FMOS program.

        <p>The assignment of fiber pairs to galaxies is done by using the software package 
            <rs type="software">Spine-to-object</rs>. 21 For each fiber configuration, the CBS mode is implemented with sequential exposures taken by offsetting the telescope by 60″ while keeping the target within one of the two fibers; this reduces the number of science targets to ∼200 per FMOS configuration. A priority is given to ensure that rarer objects of interest are assigned a fiber at a sufficient rate such as galaxies detected in either the farinfrared or X-ray bands. The star-forming galaxy population represents the majority of our targets (see Table 3). Specifically, we place the Herschel/PACS targets as the top priority followed by the X-ray detected AGNs (Chandra and XMM-Newton) and then the larger star-forming population. At least, three fibers per spectrograph are placed on bright stars for flux calibration (see Section 7.2). Flat-field images are taken at the beginning and end of each night using a screen within the dome and exposure times are 20 s in duration. Arc lamp images are acquired for wavelength calibration having exposure times of 30 and 60 s taken at two position angles separated by 180°.
        </p>
        <p>Our aim is to maximize the on-source exposure time that can be achieved for each fiber configuration while observing in a single night and below an airmass of 2. At optimal times of the year when COSMOS has a high visibility, we effectively reach an exposure time of ∼5 hr per observation. This integration time is sufficient to detect an emission line with an integrated flux f = 4 × 10 -17 erg s -1 cm -2 at a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N hereafter) level of 3 (see Section 8.1). An increase of the total integration time beyond five hours per night is constrained by the considerable amount of time needed to setup a field (∼1 hr) and re-align fibers every 30 minutes.Our aim is to maximize the on-source exposure time that can be achieved for each fiber configuration while observing in a single night and below an airmass of 2.

        <p>We begin our spectroscopic observations using the H-long grating that covers a wavelength range of 1.6-1.8 μm. Seven FMOS configurations have led to the acquisition of 1153 galaxies with H-long spectra. Using the 
            <rs type="software">Fibre-pac reduction software</rs> (see below) at the summit, we are able to identify galaxies with positive emission-line detections (i.e., Hα and [N II]) to generate an input catalog for subsequent FMOS observations using the J-long grating covering a wavelength range of 1.1-1.35 μm. This lower wavelength range is ideally suited to supplement the detection of Hα with Hβ and [O III] λ5008. Of the 1153 galaxies, we have acquired spectra using the J-long grating for 313 of them from four FMOS configurations that also cover the full one square degree. Targets are prioritized for J-long followup dependent on the reliability of a spectroscopic redshift based on the centroid of the Hα line (see below for details on redshift measurements). An additional 410 galaxies have J-long but no H-long coverage as a result of assigning many remaining fibers primarily to lower redshift (0.7  z  1.1) galaxies and AGNs (J. Kartaltepe et al. 2015, in preparation).

        <p>For science exposures, the thermal background is removed through the A -B image subtraction, where A and B are the two positions of the field center (separated by 60″) in CBS mode. For this procedure, two B-frames, taken just before and after the considered A-frame, are subtracted with a optimized weight to minimize residual sky errors. Corrections are applied to account for the detector cross talk and the bias difference between quadrants. Pixel-to-pixel variations across both detectors (IRS1 and IRS2) are minimized using the flat field image of a uniform light source taken at the beginning of each night. After rejecting bad pixels, the science frame is corrected for distortions, as mentioned above, by using transformation coefficients, resulting from the analysis of the dome-flat images. The residual OH airglow emission lines are then subtracted. All science frames are combined into a single averaged image with an additional subtraction of the residual background and correction for bad pixels. Since one target is observed in each of the two fibers in CBS mode, the corresponding spectra of position A and B are combined. In the combine process, the relative throughput between fibers is measured using the dome-flat image taken with the fibers in the same position as arranged for the science exposure.For science exposures, the thermal background is removed through the A -B image subtraction, where A and B are the two positions of the field center (separated by 60″) in CBS mode.

        <p>We implement a scheme to achieve an improvement in the absolute flux calibration for each individual galaxy by dealing with these effects collectively since it is difficult to account for each of them separately. We estimate the fraction of the light sampled by the fiber by using HST/Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) I F814W -band images (Scoville et al. 2007;Koekemoer et al. 2007) of individual targets of a specific observation. This requires an assumption that the rest-frame UV and line emission (e.g., Hα) have a similar spatial extent. Justification of this assumption comes from the tight correlation between the half-light radii in Hα and the ACS I band for the SINS/zC-SINF galaxies (Mancini et al. 2011; C. Mancini &amp; N. M. Förster-Schreiber 2015, private communication). For each FMOS observation, we smooth the HST/ACS I-band (F814W) image of each galaxy by convolving with a point-spread function of an effective seeing as determined below. We then perform aperture photometry using SExtractor (Bertin &amp; Arnouts 1996) to derive the ratio of the observed flux (i.e., rest-frame UV emission within the FMOS aperture) to the total object flux to derive an aperture correction factor for each galaxy. This factor is then applied to each emission line flux measurement to derive a value for the total flux.We implement a scheme to achieve an improvement in the absolute flux calibration for each individual galaxy by dealing with these effects collectively since it is difficult to account for each of them separately.

        <p>Prior to obtaining aperture corrections based on the HST/ ACS imaging, we need to determine an effective seeing for each FMOS observation. We elect to use the brighter science targets that have the continuum detected in the FMOS spectral window for this purpose. We compare the ground-based magnitudes from UltraVISTA in the respective band (either J or H) to that determined from the FMOS spectra. For all observations, only galaxies for which the continuum is detected with FMOS at a S/N greater than 5 and H UVISTA &lt; 23 are used for this purpose. In Figure 8, we plot the distribution of FMOS and ground-based UltraVISTA photometry for five different observations. It is apparent that there is considerable flux loss for all objects in each observation. It is clear that without any aperture correction the FMOS magnitudes are offset toward fainter magnitudes. We then proceed to derive a correction to achieve unity between the FMOS and UltraVISTA photometry as expressed as an effective seeing for each observation separately. This is in essence an average of the seeing conditions over the duration of a full exposure. We report these values in Table 2.

The aperture correction factors are distributed from ∼1.2 to ∼5 (Figure 9), with a typical value of ∼2.2. It is important to recognize that there is inherent dispersion in these corrections as shown for the galaxies with detected continuum. In the bottom right panel of Figure 8, the level of dispersion is σ = 0.42 (based on a Gaussian fit to the distribution of magnitude offsets) that corresponds to an uncertainty on the flux for an individual galaxy to be within a factor of 1.5. Such dispersion in the flux calibration should be considered when addressing issues such as the width of the star-forming MS that is likely to be intrinsically narrower than the observed width.

We apply the same procedure to the J-band observations as well.</p>

        <p>We measure the position and strength of emission lines (i.e., Hα, [N II]λ6585, [O III]λ5008, Hβ) present in our near-infrared spectra to derive spectroscopic redshifts, SFRs, levels of dust extinction, and gas-phase metallicities. We specifically measure the centroid, amplitude and FHWM of each emission line thus the total flux using a line fitting routine. For the majority of individual spectra, we do not detect the stellar continuum; although, we do fit the continuum for the limited number of bright galaxies with a linear function and remove this component prior to fitting the emission lines.We measure the position and strength of emission lines (i.e., Hα, [N II]λ6585, [O III]λ5008, Hβ) present in our near-infrared spectra to derive spectroscopic redshifts, SFRs, levels of dust extinction, and gas-phase metallicities.

        <p>Our line-fitting procedure utilizes "MPFITFUN," a Levenberg-Marquardt least squares minimization algorithm. Each emission line (Hα, [N II]λ6550, 6585) is fit as a single 22Gaussian function to characterize the line shape less impacted by pixel-to-pixel noise variations. The relative amplitude of the [N II] lines is fixed to the laboratory value of 2.96. The width of the [N II] lines are fixed to that of Hα. The width of each component is constrained to have σ &gt; σ min ∼ 45 km s -1 that corresponds to the spectral resolution of FMOS in HR mode at λ ∼ 1.6 μ (R = 2600). The value of σ min is determined for each observation based on the width of the Th-Ar emission lines detected in the arc lamp calibration images taken just before the science exposures. The routine returns best-fit parameters, errors, and a measure of the overall quality of the fit. We visually inspect a subset of the line fits to gauge the overall accuracy of our fitting routine.Our line-fitting procedure utilizes "MPFITFUN," a Levenberg-Marquardt least squares minimization algorithm.

        <p>As an example of our fitting procedure, we show the FMOS spectrum of a galaxy at z = 1.573 (Figure 11) with the best-fit Gausssian functions to the Hα and [N II] emission lines overlaid. Various panels illustrate the data quality, fitting results, and inherent issues such as residuals from regions blocked by the OH suppression mask. Based on the initial spectroscopic redshift (see Section 9), we fit a section of the spectrum centered on the emission lines and spanning a range that enables an accurate determination of the continuum level (panel (b)). A weighting for each pixel (1/N 2 ; panel (e)) is determined from the noise spectrum (N; panel (d)) that essentially indicates the regions free of OH emission. Our fitting routine takes into consideration this weighting scheme. Any pixel that is affected by an OH line, where the noise is generally large, is masked by setting the weight to zero. Throughout, we use the error on the fit parameters (i.e., amplitude and width), returned by "MPFITFUN" as a covariance matrix, to estimate the error on the total line flux. The errors are scaled to match the residual noise of the object spectra since we find that the noise spectra, output by FIBREpac, are typically underestimated by ∼20%. We confirm that the errors returned by "
            <rs type="software">MPFITFUN</rs>" do actually represent the data quality of the line detections. For this check, we directly measure the total flux within ±2.5σ of the line center, as determined by the fitting routine, and the sum of the rms dispersion (Σσ rms ) from the regions in the object spectra local to the Hα emission line. We mask out regions impacted by OH emission. Based on a comparison of both sets of error estimates (Figure 12), there is very good agreement between the two with some scatter as expected since, in many cases, the OH emission reduces the number of pixels over which the line can be detected.

        <p>We empirically determine whether our FMOS observations are capable of reaching the required depth with respect to detecting emission lines down to fluxes of 4 × 10 -17 erg s -1 cm -2 . We measure the improvement in S/N gained with each hour of integration by analyzing the data in five segments of increasing exposure time up to the full five-hour exposure (Figure 15). In panels (a)-(c), the S/N is shown to increase as a function exposure time as expected at all flux levels. This is demonstrated using four objects with Hα detections in each bin of line flux. Even at the lowest fluxes (panel (a)), the S/N is greater than 5 after the full 5 hr exposure. At the brightest fluxes (f Hα 1 × 10 -16 erg s -1 cm -2 ), the S/N reaches above 15.

        <p>We measure spectroscopic redshifts from the presence of the Hα and [N II] emission lines through a two-step process. First, we inspect all NIR spectra using the graphical interface 
            <rs type="software">SpecPro</rs>
            <rs type="version">23</rs> (Masters &amp; Capak 2014). By viewing both the oneand two-dimensional spectra, a spectroscopic redshift is assigned manually based on the presence of the aforementioned emission lines. This tool has been updated to work with FMOS spectra including the overlay of OH emission, essential to determine the likelihood of line identification. During this process, the full broadband photometry is displayed with a best-fit spectral template. In many cases, the clear presence of a discontinuity between two photometric bands (i.e., 4000 Å break) redshifted to a value in close agreement with that determined by the presence of an emission line lends assurance to the realization of a successful Hα detection. As described above, a line-fitting routine returns the centroid of key emission lines thus providing a measure of the final spectroscopic redshift. In total, we measure spectroscopic redshifts for 460 out of 1153 star-forming galaxies, targeted from either our sBzK, SED, Herschel-PACS, or low-mass samples (Table 3). The redshift distribution is shown in Figure 16 split by a quality flag indicative of the S/N of line detection as described below (Section 9.1). Various factors influence the overall distribution such as errors in photometric redshift estimates, OH emission and presence of large-scale structure within the central area of COSMOS.

        <p>The effort to supplement the H-long observations with followup J-long coverage gives us an opportunity to check the reliability of our emission-line identification and the accuracy of our redshift measurements. For this exercise, we first search for emission lines (Hβ and [O III]λ5008) at the expected positions based on the redshift derived from Hα. We then identify additional lines if present. As a result of our procedure, the measurements are not completely independent. In Figure 18, we plot the spectroscopic redshift measured from Hα compared to that for either Hβ or [O III]λ5008. Symbols are color-coded depending on whether we detect at least one or more emission lines having S/N 3 (secure) or not (insecure). Overall, we find confirmation of the redshifts for many of our galaxies, even those with Hα detected at low S/N. We find perfect agreement for all the secure cases and the few outliers are based on low S/N detections. Furthermore, we measure an almost non-existent systematic offset (mean z z 1 ( ) D + = e 2.5 5 -for the secure sample) that corresponds to 0.43 Å at 1.6 μm which is less than the pixel resolution (∼1 Å).

To aid in our assessment, we plot the ratio [N II]/Hα (see insert) for each average spectrum. It is reassuring that there is a clear detection of [N II] for each bin of stellar mass and S/N thus indicating a high level of accuracy for our redshifts, especially those with Hα detections at S/N &gt; 3. There is not much significant difference between the lines ratios for the two bins with S/N &gt; 3. We do find that for the lowest mass bin (Figure 19(a)) there is a significant drop in the strength of the [N II] line by about 50% for the low S/N bin (1.5 &lt; S/N &lt; 3). The drop in the higher mass bin is less severe (∼20%). From this, we can conclude that the lowest S/N class likely includes false identifications.

In total, the FMOS program has a success rate of 44% (see Section 9.2) as compared to 36% (106/291) for the zCOSMOS deep program over the redshift interval 1.4  z  1.7. These success rates clearly exemplify the challenges with working at a difficult redshift regime either with UV spectra that lack strong features or the NIR where the sky emission is difficult to overcome from the ground.</p>
        <p>We test the accuracy of the photometric redshifts using our FMOS spectroscopic catalog. In Figure 21, we present such a comparison using the two photometric redshift catalogs (Ilbert et al. 2009(Ilbert et al. , 2013) ) generated before and after the availability of the UltraVISTA NIR photometry.

While the input target catalog for FMOS followup has been fixed with photometric redshifts from the v1.0 catalog, there is little difference between the two (v1.0 versus v1.2) that are relevant for our purposes.

It should be noted that such level of accuracy is expected since the photometric redshifts have been trained using the initial spectroscopic redshift catalog from the FMOS observations and the identification of an Hα emission line is aided by knowledge of the photometric redshifts in some cases.

        <p>Our program relies on the ability to accurately predict not only the redshift but also the Hα emission line flux to ensure that we effectively target galaxies that will result in a positive line detection given the sensitivity limits of FMOS. Our aim is to maximize the number of spectroscopic redshifts to improve our characterization of the large-scale distribution of galaxies. In Figure 24, we indicate how well we can predict the line flux from the UV and broadband photometry that includes a correction for extinction for galaxies for both the sBzK-and SED-selected parent catalogs. The two columns represent a different factor implemented to convert extinction of stellar light to that of the nebular regions (panel (a), (c): f = 0.44; panel (b), (d): f = 0.66). The higher f-factor was determined by minimizing the offset between the predicted and observed fluxes using an early subset of the sBzK-selected galaxies shown in panels (a) and (b). This is a crude approximation of the more proper exercise of directly comparing the extinction to the nebular regions (based on the Balmer decrement) to the color excess of the stellar light as carried out in Kashino et al. (2013) that resulted in a comparable value of 0.69. As discussed in Kashino et al. (2013), this value is dissimilar to the canonical factor of 0.44 (typically used for local starburst galaxies) that resulted in predictions of emission line flux for the preliminary FMOS sample that were substantially lower a Units of 10 -17 erg s -1 cm -2 .

        <p>than their observed strengths (Figure 24(a)). To remedy this discrepancy, we argue that less extinction to the nebular regions, given their stellar extinction, is evident thus a change in the f-factor appears to be effective. After the pilot survey, target selection for all observations incorporated this change in the f-factor. We remark that the similarity between the stellar and nebular extinction is applicable for the sample observed with FMOS that resulted in positive line detections. Whether this holds for the fainter and/or more obscured star-forming population remains to be determined. Furthermore, we confirm that a similar ratio of nebular-tostellar extinction is applicable for the SED-selected sample (Figure 24 panels (c)-(d)). Based on f = 0.44, the predicted estimates fall short as compared to the observed values (panel (c)). With the higher f-factor, the predicted flux estimates appear to overshoot the one-to-one relation (panel (d)). We attribute this discrepancy to the fact that the broadband SED fitting results in a slight underestimate of the color excess (Figure 3). We indicate in Figure 24(d With an extension of our NIR spectral coverage to the J band, we detect key diagnostic emission lines including Hβ for a number of individual cases with rates given in Table 4.

        <p>In Figure 25(a), we plot the flux (not corrected for the aperture size) of the Hβ line for individual detections that constitute 21% of our Hα-detected sample. This success rate is clearly indicative of the challenges with detecting Hβ at high redshift especially for the population with faint lines. Such difficulty can be seen by comparing the flux levels and S/N estimates of those of Hβ (Figure 25(a)) with Hα (Figure 22(a)). The Hβ fluxes are over a factor of four fainter than the Hα fluxes. Even so, it is evident that we are able to detect Hβ with S/N &gt; 2 down to a limit ∼10 -17 erg s -1 cm -2 . This depth is consistent with expectation given the long integration times (∼3-4 hr) and throughput estimates of FMOS.

        <p>We further illustrate the incompleteness with respect to detecting Hβ in Figure 25(b). Here, we plot the number distribution of galaxies observed with the J-long grating because Hα was previously detected. We include a subset of our sample with a S/N &gt; 3 (202 galaxies) for the detection of Hα (solid histogram). The distribution is shown as a function of the logarithm of Hα flux (not corrected for the aperture size). From this sample, we then identify those with positive Hβ detections having a S/N greater than 1.5, 3, and 5 each with a different shading. Above S/N of 1.5 (3), we have detections of Hβ for 21 (22)% of the FMOS sample. Our low success rate for detecting Hβ is also due to the fact that we did not neglect to target galaxies for which Hβ may be significantly (50%) blocked by the OH suppression mask. In such cases, there would be the possibility to detect [O III]λ5008. Given the low level of individual detections, we resort to using stacked spectra for much of our scientific analysis and are pursuing deeper J-band spectroscopic followup to increase the sample with significant individual detections.We further illustrate the incompleteness with respect to detecting Hβ in Figure 25(b).

While many sources are spread about a relation, expected for an A Hα ∼ 1, there are galaxies with a ratio of Hα/Hβ lower than the theoretical value of 2.86 (assuming case B recombination with no extinction). This is likely an indication that there is some uncertainty in the Hα, or more likely, the Hβ line fluxes for individual detections that may be further affected by being observed separately possibly under varying sky conditions that result in having to apply different aperture corrections with their own level of uncertainty.In Figure 26, the luminosities of Hα and Hβ (both corrected for the aperture size) are compared against each other for galaxies with Hα (S/N &gt; 5) and Hβ (S/N &gt; 1.5).

        <p>We discuss in full detail the selection function for the starforming galaxy sample that spans the full MS at stellar masses above 10 9.8 M e . The selection is based on the expectation to detect the Hα emission line. This puts constraints on the extinction properties of the sample by excluding the most heavily dust-obscured galaxies. To alleviate this bias, we specifically target galaxies detected by Herschel that lie on and off the star-forming MS. In addition, we observe Chandra X-ray selected AGNs (both type 1 and 2) to study black hole accretion at a cosmic epoch of maximal growth. Both Chandra and Herschel sources will be presented in subsequent studies. This paper is mainly focused on presenting a detailed analysis of the sample, information on the observing program, data analysis, redshift measurements, and characteristics of the observed and final sample with spectroscopic redshifts.

        <p>Our broad aim for the program is to build a large enough spectroscopic sample in the COSMOS field to provide a map of large-scale structure at z ∼ 1.6 and elucidate whether the environment plays a role in shaping the properties of galaxies as seen at low redshift. Furthermore, the rich multi-wavelength resources (i.e., HST, Spitzer, VLA, Chandra, etc.) of the COSMOS field provide a wealth of information to supply the means to answer many fundamental questions as to how galaxies and supermassive black holes grow, possibly in concert, with cosmic time. With FMOS, we have started to open this spectral window not yet fully explored and already being complemented with results coming from other multiaperture NIR instruments such as Keck/MOSFIRE, and the VLT/KMOS. The wide-field capability of FMOS will not be matched for a few years until the operation of a new generation of multi-fiber spectrographs such as MOONS, or Prime-focus-Spectrograph; (Takada et al. 2014) Facility: Subaru(FMOS).Our broad aim for the program is to build a large enough spectroscopic sample in the COSMOS field to provide a map of large-scale structure at z ∼ 1.6 and elucidate whether the environment plays a role in shaping the properties of galaxies as seen at low redshift. Furthermore, the rich multi-wavelength resources (i.e., HST, Spitzer, VLA, Chandra, etc.) of the COSMOS field provide a wealth of information to supply the means to answer many fundamental questions as to how galaxies and supermassive black holes grow, possibly in concert, with cosmic time.

        <p>For our purpose, a single component fit to the Hα line is sufficient. Although, there remains the possibility that, in some cases, an additional component may be required possibly indicative of galactic outflows or underlying AGNs. At this time, we reserve such investigations to subsequent studies.For our purpose, a single component fit to the Hα line is sufficient.
