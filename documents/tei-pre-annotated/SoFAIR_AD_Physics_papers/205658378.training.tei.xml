        <p>Motivated by the energy representation of Riemannian metric, in this paper we study different approaches toward the geometrical concept of black hole thermodynamics. We investigate thermodynamical Ricci scalar of Weinhold, Ruppeiner and Quevedo metrics and show that their number and location of divergences do not coincide with phase transition points arisen from heat capacity. Next, we introduce a new metric to solve these problems. We show that the denominator of the Ricci scalar of the new metric contains terms which coincide with different types of phase transitions. We elaborate the effectiveness of the new metric and shortcomings of the previous metrics with some examples. Furthermore, we find a characteristic behavior of the new thermodynamical Ricci scalar which enables one to distinguish two types of phase transitions. In addition, we generalize the new metric for the cases of more than two extensive parameters and show that in these cases the divergencies of thermodynamical Ricci scalar coincide with phase transition points of the heat capacity.Motivated by the energy representation of Riemannian metric, in this paper we study different approaches toward the geometrical concept of black hole thermodynamics.

        <p>Motivated by large applications of the geometrical concept of thermodynamics in the black hole phase transition, in this paper, we investigate strengths and shortcomings of different approaches toward the matter. First attempt was done by Weinhold [16,17] which introduced a metric on the space of equilibrium states where its components are given as the Hessian of the internal energy. Then, Ruppeiner introduced a metric which is defined as the negative Hessian of entropy with respect to the internal energy and other extensive quantities of a thermodynamical system [18,19]. It was shown that these two metrics are conformally equivalent to each other where the temperature is the conformal factor [20]. Recently, Quevedo [21,22] proposed a Legendre invariant metric, in which solved some of problems in Weinhold/Ruppeiner methods.Motivated by large applications of the geometrical concept of thermodynamics in the black hole phase transition, in this paper, we investigate strengths and shortcomings of different approaches toward the matter.

        <p>In order to investigate the local stability of a black hole, one can use various methods related to different ensembles. In principle thermal stability can be carried out in the grand canonical ensemble by finding the determinant of the Hessian matrix of M(X i ) with respect to its extensive variables X i [27,28]. For static charged black holes, we usually regard the mass M as a function of the entropy S and the charge Q. The number of thermodynamic variables depends on the ensemble that is used. The most well known approach for studying phase transition is in the context of canonical ensemble, hence the heat capacity of systems. Depending on the number of extensive parameters, the behavior of Hessian matrix is highly sensitive [29][30][31][32] and therefore most of physicists prefer to work in canonical ensemble. In this ensemble, the positivity of the heat capacity is sufficient to ensure thermal stability.

        <p>Another important property of new metric is the behavior of TRS very close to the phase transition points. As Fig. 3 confirms, the sign of the TRS before and after the divergence point for these two types of the phase transitions is different. If the phase transition is related to the vanishing heat capacity (type one), we see a change of sign for TRS before and after of the corresponding singular point. While for the divergence point of the heat capacity (type two), TRS has the same sign for the left and right sides of this point. Therefore, this characteristic behavior enables one to distinguish these two types of phase transitions from each other.Another important property of new metric is the behavior of TRS very close to the phase transition points.

For case II (Fig. 5 down panels), we obtain effective results. In other words, all divergence points and vanishing point of the heat capacity are matched with divergencies of the Quevedo's TRS of case II.

        <p>Now, we are in a position to generalize the new defined metric to the case of more than two extensive parameters. Regarding Weinhold, Ruppeiner and Quevedo approaches, one finds that supplementing additional extensive parameters increases the complexity of the thermodynamical Ricci scalars and also their denominators. The supplemental extensive parameters lead to extra terms which may contribute to the additional number of divergencies of the system under study.

        <p>Considering Eq.

Regarding the divergence points of the heat capacity, which are related to vanishing M SS , and in order to match both divergence points of heat capacity and those of the Weinhold and the Ruppeiner cases, one should set last three terms to zero and the coefficient of M SS should be a nonzero finite expression (M 2 Q J -M Q Q M J J = 0). Since these fine tuning conditions are not hold in general, we encounter mismatch between divergence points and/or extra divergencies in TRS.Considering Eq.
