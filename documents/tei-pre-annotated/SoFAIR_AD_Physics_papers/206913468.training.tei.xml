        <p>We analyze in detail the global symmetries of various (2 + 1)d quantum field theories and couple them to classical background gauge fields. A proper identification of the global symmetries allows us to consider all non-trivial bundles of those background fields, thus finding more subtle observables. The global symmetries exhibit interesting 't Hooft anomalies. These allow us to constrain the IR behavior of the theories and provide powerful constraints on conjectured dualities.We analyze in detail the global symmetries of various (2 + 1)d quantum field theories and couple them to classical background gauge fields.

        <p>The first duality is the celebrated particle/vortex duality of [1,2]. The second duality maps an interacting bosonic theory to a free fermion [38]. The theory in the third duality has a quantum SO(3) global symmetry [45] (see figure 1). In all these cases the monopole operator of U (1) k in the theory on the left side of the duality, whose spin is k 2 , is an important operator in the theory on the right side. It is the scalar in the first case, it is the free fermion in the second case, and it is the new current of the enhanced SO(3) symmetry in the third case. All these dualities are IR dualities. We start at short distances with a renormalizable Lagrangian and impose some global symmetry on its terms. Then, we scan the relevant deformations that are consistent with the global symmetry. These are typically mass terms, but there are also others. For generic values of these parameters the low-energy theory is gapped. As these parameters are varied there could be phase transitions between different phases and the phase transition points occur at fine-tuned values of the scanned parameters. We will assume that, as we vary these parameters, the phase transitions can be second order. Then the long-distance physics is described by a fixed point of the renormalization group, which is a continuum conformal field theory. The statement of the IR duality is about this fixed point and its neighborhood. If, on the other hand, the IR theory is always gapped with possible first-order transitions between phases, the statement of the duality is significantly weaker and it applies only to the gapped phases.The first duality is the celebrated particle/vortex duality of [1,2].

        <p>Conversely, there could be new elements in G IR that are not present in the UV. These lead to an accidental or quantum symmetry in the IR. These symmetries are approximate and are violated by higher-dimension operators in the IR theory.

        <p>A noteworthy simple example [45] is summarized in figure 1, where four different UV theories, some with G UV = O(2) and some with G UV = SO(3), flow to the very same IR fixed point with SO(3) global symmetry (we will discuss this example in section 3).

        <p>When we discuss the global symmetry G (either G UV or G IR ) we should make sure that it acts faithfully on the operators. Specifically, we will see many examples where all the local gauge-invariant operators in the theory transform in certain representations of the naive global symmetry group G naive , but the true global symmetry G -which acts faithfully -is a quotient G = G naive /C by an appropriate C.When we discuss the global symmetry G (either G UV or G IR ) we should make sure that it acts faithfully on the operators.

        <p>A key tool in the analysis of a quantum field theory is its coupling to background gauge fields for the global symmetry.

        <p>For example, consider the SU(2) 1 theory with a scalar in figure 1. The naive global symmetry is G naive = SU(2). However, in this case all gauge-invariant operators in the theory are in integer isospin representations of this group and therefore the true global symmetry is G = G naive /Z 2 = SO(3). This means that the system can be coupled to additional background fields -SO(3) gauge fields, which are not SU(2) gauge fields. The response to such more subtle backgrounds leads to interesting observables, which give us more diagnostics of the theory.For example, consider the SU(2) 1 theory with a scalar in figure 1.

        <p>More explicitly, we can couple the matter fields to SU(2) dyn × SU(2) naive /Z 2 (1.4) gauge fields. This is consistent because the matter fields do not sense the Z 2 quotient. The expression (1.4) means that when the classical fields are ordinary SU(2) naive gauge fields, the dynamical gauge fields are ordinary SU(2) dyn gauge fields. However, when the classical fields are nontrivial SO(3) gauge fields (i.e. SO(3) fields with nontrivial second Stiefel-Whitney class w 2 ), also the dynamical fields are in SO(3) bundles. This demonstrates that by using SO(3) background fields we can probe more twisted sectors of the dynamical fields. Below we will see many generalizations of this example. We will encounter dynamical fields b for a gauge group G dyn and background fields B for the true global symmetry of the model G = G naive /C for some C.

        <p>If the classical fields B are in G naive bundles, the dynamical fields b are in G dyn bundles. But when B are in nontrivial G = G naive /C bundles, also the dynamical fields b are in G dyn /C bundles rather than in G dyn bundles. The consistency of the theory under gauge transformations in (1.5) and possible anomalies in these transformations will be extremely important below.

        <p>It is often the case that the global symmetry G has 't Hooft anomalies. This means that the correlation functions at separated points are G invariant, but the contact terms in correlation functions cannot be taken to be G invariant. Related to that is the fact that the system with nonzero background gauge fields for G is not invariant under G gauge transformations. Often, this lack of G gauge invariance of background fields can be avoided by coupling the system to a higher-dimensional bulk theory with appropriate bulk terms.It is often the case that the global symmetry G has 't Hooft anomalies.

        <p>Let us discuss it more explicitly. Since we denote the classical gauge fields by uppercase letters, A, B, etc., we will denote the coefficients of their Chern-Simons counterterms [55,56] by K. 7 They should be distinguished from the Chern-Simons coefficients of dynamical fields a, b, etc., which we denote by lower case k. It is important that k and K should be properly normalized as (2 + 1)d terms. As we will see below, it is often the case that the proper normalization of these coefficients involves a nontrivial relation between K and k.Let us discuss it more explicitly.

A well known typical example in which we can preserve only a subgroup G ⊂ G is the time-reversal anomaly of (2 + 1)d free fermions. Here G includes a global U(1) symmetry and time reversal, but they have a mixed anomaly. One common option is to preserve G = U(1), but not time reversal. Alternatively, in the topological insulator we extend the background U(1) gauge field to the bulk and we turn on a (3 + 1)d θ-parameter equal to π [57,58], such that the entire global symmetry G is preserved.We will not present a general analysis of such anomalies.

The analysis of [39] paid more attention to global aspects of the gauge and global symmetries and to the Chern-Simons counterterms. Here we continue that analysis and discuss in detail the global symmetry and its anomalies. In particular, we will show that the IR behavior of this model has a global O(4) symmetry and time-reversal invariance T, but these symmetries have 't Hooft anomalies. As in previous sections, various subgroups or multiple covers of this symmetry are anomaly free and can be preserved in a purely (2 + 1)d model.

        <p>Building on the interesting fermion/fermion duality of [4][5][6], the authors of [46] proposed the self-duality of a U(1) theory with two fermions. This was later generalized in [47] to the self-duality of a U(1) gauge theory with two fermions, one with charge 1 and one with charge k odd. As emphasized in [38,39,49], the coefficients in the Lagrangians in [4][5][6] are improperly quantized. This was fixed in [38] by adding more fields and more terms to the Lagrangian. Then, a proper derivation of the self-duality of the theory with k = 1 was given in [39]. That perspective was also consistent with the spin/charge relation and described the proper coupling of background gauge fields. Here we will present a similar derivation of the self-duality of the theory with generic odd k. This will lead us to a more detailed analysis of the global symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies of the problem.Building on the interesting fermion/fermion duality of [4][5][6], the authors of [46] proposed the self-duality of a U(1) theory with two fermions.
