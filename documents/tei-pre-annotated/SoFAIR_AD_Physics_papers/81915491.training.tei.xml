        <p>The transverse momentum distribution of massive neutral vector bosons can be measured to high accuracy at hadron colliders. The transverse momentum is caused by a partonic recoil, and is determined by QCD dynamics. We compute the single and double-differential transverse momentum distributions for fully inclusive Z/γ * production including leptonic decay to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbative QCD. We also compute the same distributions normalised to the cross sections for inclusive Z/γ * production, i.e. integrated over the transverse momentum of the lepton pair. We compare our predictions for the fiducial cross sections to the 8 TeV data set from the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, which both observed a tension between data and NLO theory predictions, using the experimental cuts and binning. We find that the inclusion of the NNLO QCD effects does not fully resolve the tension with the data for the unnormalised p Z T distribution. However, we observe that normalising the NNLO Z-boson transverse momentum distribution by the NNLO Drell-Yan cross section substantially improves the agreement between experimental data and theory, and opens the way for precision QCD studies of this observable.The transverse momentum distribution of massive neutral vector bosons can be measured to high accuracy at hadron colliders.

        <p>The Drell-Yan production of lepton pairs mediated through a virtual photon or a Z boson is an important process at hadron colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This process has a clean signature with a large event rate, leading to small experimental errors over a wide range of energies. It is a key process in probing Standard Model physics, for example fitting parton distribution functions (PDFs) and measuring the strong coupling constant α s . Furthermore, it is an important background in searches for signatures of physics beyond the Standard Model, such as supersymmetry and dark matter.The Drell-Yan production of lepton pairs mediated through a virtual photon or a Z boson is an important process at hadron colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

        <p>There has been a significant amount of effort to ensure that theoretical predictions match the high precision data available from the LHC. The inclusive cross section for Z/γ * production is known at NNLO accuracy in QCD [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. Corrections beyond this order have been studied in the soft-virtual approximation [10][11][12][13][14][15]. The NNLO QCD corrections have been combined with a resummation of next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic effects (NNLL) [16][17][18][19] which is necessary to predict the transverse momentum distribution of the Z boson at small p T and matched with parton showers [20,21]. The NLO electroweak corrections [22][23][24][25] and the mixed QCD-EW corrections [26,27] have also been computed.There has been a significant amount of effort to ensure that theoretical predictions match the high precision data available from the LHC.

        <p>As illustrated in figure 1, the transverse momentum of the Z boson is generated by the emission of QCD radiation so that the fixed order calculation at O(α 2 s ), which is NNLO for the inclusive cross section, corresponds to only an NLO-accurate prediction of the transverse momentum distribution. The NLO EW corrections to the Z-boson transverse momentum distribution [28][29][30][31] are typically negative and at the level of a few percent at small to moderate p Z T , but are enhanced by the well-known electroweak Sudakov logarithms when p Z T M Z . At small p Z T , the electroweak corrections approach the corrections to the total Z production cross section, such that they largely cancel when normalising the p Z T distribution to the total cross section.As illustrated in figure 1, the transverse momentum of the Z boson is generated by the emission of QCD radiation so that the fixed order calculation at O(α 2 s ), which is NNLO for the inclusive cross section, corresponds to only an NLO-accurate prediction of the transverse momentum distribution.

        <p>Recently the O(α 3 s ) NNLO QCD corrections to Z+jet production were computed [32][33][34][35][36]. Building upon the calculation presented in ref. [32,33], we exploit our highly flexible and numerically stable code to compute the transverse momentum distribution of the Z boson at finite transverse momentum at NNLO precision. To achieve this we relax the requirement of observing a final state jet and instead impose a low transverse momentum cut on the Z boson. This transverse momentum cut ensures the infrared finiteness of the NNLO calculation, since it enforces the presence of final-state partons to balance the transverse momentum of the Z boson.Recently the O(α 3 s ) NNLO QCD corrections to Z+jet production were computed [32][33][34][35][36].

        <p>The production of Z bosons (or, more generally, of lepton pairs with given invariant mass) at large transverse momentum has been studied extensively at the LHC by the ATLAS [37,38], CMS [39,40] and LHCb [41,42] experiments. In order to reduce the systematic uncertainty on the measurement, the transverse momentum distribution is commonly normalised to the p T -inclusive Z-boson production cross section. ATLAS and CMS both observed a tension between their measurements and existing NLO QCD predictions, highlighting the potential importance of higher order corrections to this process.The production of Z bosons (or, more generally, of lepton pairs with given invariant mass) at large transverse momentum has been studied extensively at the LHC by the ATLAS [37,38], CMS [39,40] and LHCb [41,42] experiments.

        <p>Both experiments present their measurements in the form of fiducial cross sections for a restricted kinematical range of the final state leptons (in invariant mass, transverse momentum and rapidity). In view of a comparison between data and theory, this form of presenting the experimental data is preferable over a cross section that is fully inclusive in the lepton kinematics (requiring a theory-based extrapolation into phase space regions outside the detector coverage). Consequently, the theoretical calculation must take proper account of these restrictions in the final state lepton kinematics.Both experiments present their measurements in the form of fiducial cross sections for a restricted kinematical range of the final state leptons (in invariant mass, transverse momentum and rapidity).

        <p>The unnormalised p Z T distribution represents an absolute cross section measurement based on event counting rates. As with any absolute measurement, it has the disadvantage of being sensitive to the proper modelling of acceptance corrections, and of relying on the absolute determination of the integrated luminosity of the data sample under consideration. At the LHC the luminosity uncertainty alone amounts to about 3%. In order to reduce the luminosity uncertainty, the data can be normalised to the Drell-Yan cross section for the corresponding fiducial phase space. This is obtained from the cross section for Z boson production with the same transverse momentum and rapidity cuts on the individual leptons, but integrated over all possible transverse momenta of the Z boson. On the theoretical side, this amounts to normalising the distribution to the NNLO pp → + -+X cross section in which the fiducial cuts are applied to the leptons, but which is fully inclusive on the transverse momentum of the lepton-pair.The unnormalised p Z T distribution represents an absolute cross section measurement based on event counting rates.

        <p>where m and p Z T are the invariant mass and the transverse momentum of the final state lepton pair respectively. The theoretical uncertainty is estimated by varying the scale choice by a factor in the range [1/2, 2]. The electroweak coupling constant α is derived from the Fermi constant in the G µ scheme, which absorbs large logarithms of the light fermion masses induced by the running of the coupling constant from the Thomson limit (Q 2 = 0) to the electroweak scale into the tree-level coupling. We also impose a cut on the transverse momentum of the Z boson, p Z T &gt; 20 GeV. In the low transverse momentum region, large logarithmic corrections of the form log n (p T /M Z ) appear at each order in the perturbative expansion in α s , spoiling its convergence. A reliable theoretical prediction in this region can only be obtained by resummation [16][17][18][19] of these logarithms to all orders in perturbation theory. The cut on the transverse momentum also ensures the applicability of our approach, originally developed for Z+jet production at NNLO.

        <p>appropriate dilepton invariant mass cut. We computed these fiducial cross sections to NNLO accuracy (O(α 2 s )) and compare them to the measured values quoted by ATLAS [38] in figure 5. We clearly observe that the central value of the NNLO prediction falls below the experimental data in all mass bins. The large scale dependence in the three lowest mass bins can be explained from the interplay between the cuts on the lepton pair invariant mass and on the single lepton transverse momentum. The latter cuts forbid events at low transverse momentum of the lepton pair down to m = 40 GeV, such that the two lowest bins receive no leading order contribution, and the third bin only a very small one. All three bins are populated only from NLO onwards, with events containing a low-mass lepton pair recoiling against a parton at high transverse momentum. So our NNLO prediction for the inclusive cross section in these mass bins is effectively only NLO accurate, with consequently larger scale dependence. In the three bins with larger m , the scale uncertainty on the NNLO prediction is below 0.7%, which results in tension between data and theory at the level of two standard deviations.appropriate dilepton invariant mass cut. We computed these fiducial cross sections to NNLO accuracy (O(α 2 s )) and compare them to the measured values quoted by ATLAS [38] in figure 5. We clearly observe that the central value of the NNLO prediction falls below the experimental data in all mass bins. The large scale dependence in the three lowest mass bins can be explained from the interplay between the cuts on the lepton pair invariant mass and on the single lepton transverse momentum. The latter cuts forbid events at low transverse momentum of the lepton pair down to m = 40 GeV, such that the two lowest bins receive no leading order contribution, and the third bin only a very small one. All three bins are populated only from NLO onwards, with events containing a low-mass lepton pair recoiling against a parton at high transverse momentum. So our NNLO prediction for the inclusive cross section in these mass bins is effectively only NLO accurate, with consequently larger scale dependence. In the three bins with larger m , the scale uncertainty on the NNLO prediction is below 0.7%, which results in tension between data and theory at the level of two standard deviations.</p>
        <p>Combining together the unnormalised differential distribution with the inclusive cross sections, we obtain the normalised distributions shown in figure 6. Because of the large scale uncertainty in the inclusive cross section, the theoretical errors dominate the low m bins. At large m , the tension between the data and NNLO theory is largely relieved. At the highest values of p Z T , the tendency of the data to fall below the theory prediction may be an indication of the onset of electroweak corrections [28][29][30][31], which are negative in this region. Any remaining tension for medium values of p Z T could potentially be accounted for revisiting the parton distribution functions (especially the gluon distribution) in the kinematical region relevant to this measurement.Combining together the unnormalised differential distribution with the inclusive cross sections, we obtain the normalised distributions shown in figure 6.

        <p>The same tension between NNLO theory and ATLAS data for the unnormalised distribution is visible in figure 7, which shows the unnormalised double-differential distribution with respect to the transverse momentum of the Z boson for 66 GeV &lt; m &lt; 116 GeV in different ranges of the rapidity of the Z boson, normalised to the NLO prediction. The NNLO corrections are uniform in rapidity and transverse momentum at the level of about 5-8%, and they decrease the residual theoretical uncertainty to 2-4%. The data, which correspond to the invariant mass bin containing the Z resonance, are consistently above the NNLO prediction.The same tension between NNLO theory and ATLAS data for the unnormalised distribution is visible in figure 7, which shows the unnormalised double-differential distribution with respect to the transverse momentum of the Z boson for 66 GeV &lt; m &lt; 116 GeV in different ranges of the rapidity of the Z boson, normalised to the NLO prediction.

        <p>In order to eliminate the overall luminosity uncertainty, one again normalises the data to the inclusive fiducial dilepton cross section in the respective bins in y Z . Figure 8 shows the ratio of ATLAS data and the NNLO cross section compared to the NLO prediction. As for the rapidity-integrated cross section in this mass bin, figure 5, we observe the NNLO prediction to be accurate to 0.9%, and to underestimate the ATLAS data by about two standard deviations.

        <p>The CMS measurement of the Z-boson transverse momentum distribution at 8 TeV [40] concentrates on the dilepton invariant mass range 81 GeV &lt; m &lt; 101 GeV around the Z resonance. The fiducial region of this measurement, defined in table 1, applies asymmetric cuts on the leading and sub-leading lepton, disregarding the lepton charge. To ensure the correct implementation of these cuts in NNLOJET, and to maintain local cancellations between matrix elements and subtraction terms in the antenna subtraction method, the lepton identification as leading and sub-leading had to be passed alongside the lepton charge through all subtraction terms and into the event analysis routines. The doubledifferential measurement is performed in p Z T and y Z . Comparing the absolute doubledifferential distributions of figure 10 to our NNLO predictions, we observe the same features as for the ATLAS measurement, with positive NNLO corrections at the level of 5-8% and an NNLO scale uncertainty of 2-4%. Compared to NLO, inclusion of NNLO corrections brings the theoretical prediction closer to the experimental data, which are however still about 5-8% larger than expected from theory.The CMS measurement of the Z-boson transverse momentum distribution at 8 TeV [40] concentrates on the dilepton invariant mass range 81 GeV &lt; m &lt; 101 GeV around the Z resonance.

        <p>In the CMS study [40], the normalised cross section is obtained by dividing the distributions by the fiducial cross section integrated over all bins in y Z (in contrast to ATLAS, which normalised to the fiducial cross sections only integrated over the respective bin in y Z ). At NNLO, we obtain for the fiducial cross section with CMS cuts: σ NNLO (81 GeV &lt; m &lt; 101 GeV) = 450.6 +2.7 -1.6 pb.In the CMS study [40], the normalised cross section is obtained by dividing the distributions by the fiducial cross section integrated over all bins in y Z (in contrast to ATLAS, which normalised to the fiducial cross sections only integrated over the respective bin in y Z ).

        <p>The normalised distributions of CMS are compared to theory in figure 11, where excellent agreement is observed upon inclusion of the NNLO corrections. Compared to NNLO theory, both ATLAS and CMS fiducial cross section measurements of the Z-boson transverse momentum display a similar pattern of disagreement for the absolute distributions while having excellent agreement for the normalised distributions. The inclusion of the newly derived NNLO corrections to the transverse momentum distribution are crucial for a meaningful comparison between data and theory: (a) they reduce the theory uncertainty to a level that firmly establishes the discrepancy on the absolute cross sections, and (b) they modify the central value and the shape of the theory prediction to better agree with the data on the normalised distributions.The normalised distributions of CMS are compared to theory in figure 11, where excellent agreement is observed upon inclusion of the NNLO corrections.

        <p>We have derived the NNLO QCD corrections to the production of Z/γ * bosons decaying to lepton pairs at large transverse momentum, inclusive over the hadronic final state. This observable has typically been very easy to measure but difficult to predict theoretically because of the necessity to be fully inclusive with respect to all QCD radiation. Our calculation is performed using the parton-level Monte Carlo generator NNLOJET which implements the antenna subtraction method for NNLO calculations of hadron collider observables. It extends our earlier calculation of Z/γ * +jet production at this order [32,33] and now also includes inclusive Z/γ * production. We have performed a thorough comparison of theory predictions to the 8 TeV Run 1 data of the LHC for cross sections defined over a fiducial region of lepton kinematics from the ATLAS [38] and CMS [40] collaborations. We observe that the NNLO corrections to the unnormalised distributions are moderate and positive, resulting in theory predictions that are closer to the experimental observations than at NLO. However, this improvement is much more dramatic when one considers distributions normalised to the relevant dilepton cross section. This is true for both single and double-differential distributions. While the normalised distributions for low m slices in comparison to ATLAS are dominated by the theoretical scale uncertainty on the inclusive dilepton cross section, for larger m and all |y Z | bins the agreement between NNLO theory and LHC data is excellent. With the reduction of the theoretical scale uncertainty at NNLO, a careful reinvestigation of the parametric ingredients to the NNLO theory predictions (parton distributions, strong coupling constant, electroweak parameters) appears now to be mandatory. Our calculation enables exactly these precision studies, and will allow a consistent inclusion of the precision data on the Z transverse momentum distribution into NNLO determinations of parton distributions, leading to precision constraints at this order on the gluon distribution over a large momentum range.We have derived the NNLO QCD corrections to the production of Z/γ * bosons decaying to lepton pairs at large transverse momentum, inclusive over the hadronic final state.
