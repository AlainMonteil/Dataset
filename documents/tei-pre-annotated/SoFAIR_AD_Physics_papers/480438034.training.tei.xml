        <p>The properties of GaN devices allow the fabrication of high-efficiency (near or above 99 %) [2]- [6], kW-range power converters. Such converters can have switching frequencies above 1 MHz [7], [8], andthrough proper design, integration and/or hybrid GaN/CMOS manufacturingfrequencies as high as MHz can be reached [9], [10]. High frequency operation permits to substantially reduce the size and weight of inductors and capacitors, thus resulting in a compact converter design. Further innovation will come from the design of monolithically integrated all-GaN integrated circuits: specific platforms, such as GaN on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) can be used for the fabrication of fully integrated power converters, containing smart control, pulse width modulation (PWM) circuitry, dead time control and half bridge [11], [12]. Such solutions, that can be tailored for switching in the 1-10 MHz range, can reach very short turn on/off times, which are considerably smaller than in discrete gate drivers [12]. The availability of fast, small, efficient and light-weight power converters can be particularly beneficial in the fields of portable/consumer electronics, automotive, and avionics.The properties of GaN devices allow the fabrication of high-efficiency (near or above 99 %) [2]- [6], kW-range power converters.

        <p>Several key aspects related to device design, fabrication and performance must be discussed in detail, to understand how the performance of the transistors can be optimized through careful device design: this will be done extensively in the following sections of this paper. For introductory purposes, we remind here that in a HEMT current flows between drain and source through a 2dimensional electron gas (2DEG), which is formed at the heterojunction between an AlGaN barrier and a GaN layer. Figure 1 (a) reports the schematic structure of a GaN-based HEMT, showing the main layers that constitute the structure. Power GaN devices are typically grown on a Si substrate, to minimize cost and maximize yield. Growing GaN on a Si substrate is particularly complicated, due to: a) the large mismatch of the in-plane thermal expansion coefficient (2.6x10 -6 K -1 for Si and 5.59x10 -6 K -1 for GaN [29]), that may lead to cracking of the GaN layer during the cooling-phase after the epitaxial growth; b) the large lattice mismatch (around 16 % for Si (111)) [30], [31], that may result in the propagation of dislocations through the GaN epitaxial layers, with consequent defect generation. A careful optimization of the buffer is needed in order to limit the propagation of such defects towards the 2DEG region; Figure 1 (b) reports a cross sectional SEM image of the epitaxial layers of a GaN-based transistor. As can be noticed, the use of a step-graded buffer in combination with an AlN nucleation layer is used to release the strain and prevent the formation/propagation of dislocations.Several key aspects related to device design, fabrication and performance must be discussed in detail, to understand how the performance of the transistors can be optimized through careful device design: this will be done extensively in the following sections of this paper.

        <p>The lateral structure described in Figure 1 may have some limitations, when extremely high breakdown voltages and/or power densities are targeted. First, in a lateral transistor the breakdown voltage scales with the gate-drain spacing. Thus, devices with a high breakdown voltage can be fabricated, but will be more resistive and will use a wider semiconductor area, thus resulting in a higher device cost. Second, the density of electrons in the 2DEG can be strongly influenced by surface charges: for this reason, the performance of the final devices is strongly dependent on the process and backend. To solve the limitation of GaN lateral devices, vertical device structures are currently being explored and investigated, in line with what has been done with Si and SiC components. In a vertical device (see a schematic structure in Figure 1 (c)), current flows through the bulk of the material, thus allowing high current and power densities. The density of electrons in the channel is modulated through a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) stack, and a p-type body is usually employed to shift the threshold voltage towards more positive values. The breakdown voltage of a vertical GaN transistor depends on the thickness of the lightly-doped drift region, and not on the size and area of the device as in a lateral transistor. Vertical GaN devices represent the latest development in GaN technology, and the reader will find interest in the related concepts and applications, described in this paper.The lateral structure described in Figure 1 may have some limitations, when extremely high breakdown voltages and/or power densities are targeted.

        <p>As for every technology, there are some physical processes that may limit the performance and the reliability of GaN devices. The on-resistance of a GaN transistors (and thus the density of electrons in the 2DEG) strongly depends on the intrinsic (spontaneous and piezoelectric) polarization charges of GaN, as well as on the presence of charges trapped at surface states (e.g. in the passivation layer or at the interface between the passivation layer and the AlGaN barrier) or in buffer states. For this reason, it is of fundamental importance to know and manage the surfaceand buffer-related trapping phenomena that may limit the dynamic performance of GaN transistors, leading to a recoverable increase in on-resistance (dynamic-Ron problem). Trapping in the epitaxial layers and/or at the gate-stack may result in positive-or negative-bias threshold instability (PBTI or NBTI), and the related processes must be investigated and understood to be able to fabricate fast and reliable devices.As for every technology, there are some physical processes that may limit the performance and the reliability of GaN devices.

        <p>Finally, GaN-based transistors are operated at field, temperature, and frequency levels which are unimaginable for conventional Si devices. Electric fields can be in excess of 3 MV/cm, and channel temperatures can be above 300 °C during operation, if lightweight heat dissipators are used. Such conditions may favor sudden or time-dependent breakdown phenomena, leading to the failure of the devices. Furthermore, operation at high frequencies may exacerbate the degradation processes related to hard switching events. For this reason, it is of utmost importance to understand the degradation processes of GaN power devices, and to identify ways and strategies for improving the robustness of the components.

        <p>Controlled doping of wide bandgap semiconductors is not always straightforward: typically, mobile carriers in FET are induced through impurity doping, i.e. by introducing foreign atoms in a semiconductor lattice. The energy distance between the dopant level and the related band (𝐸 𝐶 -𝐸 𝐷 for a donor level at energy 𝐸 𝐷 , or 𝐸 𝐴 -𝐸 𝑉 for an acceptor level at energy 𝐸 𝐴 ) represents the dopant binding (or ionization) energy. The best dopants are relatively shallow, with binding energies in the range 0.01 eV -0.05 eV. For GaN, only shallow donors are available (Si, 𝐸 𝐶 -𝐸 𝐷 =0.015 eV), while the conventional acceptor is magnesium, that creates a level 0.16 eV above the valence band energy. As a consequence, it is relatively easy to achieve high electron concentrations, whereas for reaching high hole densities dopant levels in excess of 10 19 𝑐𝑚 -3 are required. It is worth noticing that even high quality GaN has a residual n-type (unintentional) conductivity, resulting in carrier densities in the range 10 15 -10 17 𝑐𝑚 -3 , depending on material properties. Such residual conductivity has been ascribed to native defects of the semiconductor (e.g. point defects, vacancies, antisites), and impurities (like carbon, oxygen, hydrogen) [42]. The suppression of such defect-induced free carriers is very important for the fabrication of highlyinsulating GaN layer, to be used in devices with extremely high blocking voltages.Controlled doping of wide bandgap semiconductors is not always straightforward: typically, mobile carriers in FET are induced through impurity doping, i.e. by introducing foreign atoms in a semiconductor lattice.

        <p>Figure 16: Cross section of a typical AlGaN/GaN HEMT structure One of the main issues for GaN-based heteroepitaxy is the lattice mismatch and difference in thermal expansion coefficients with the substrate. This generally leads to a high dislocation density, which may be a source of leakage current under high electric field and subsequent device degradation. Residual stress may be created, inducing eventually cracks. The most common materials used as substrates are Si, sapphire, SiC and more recently bulk GaN. In all cases, the epitaxial layers have rather high dislocation density (10 3 -10 10 cm -2 [70], [71]). Some properties of the substrates typically used for GaN-based epitaxy are shown in Table 5. For power applications, the Si substrate is preferred because of its low cost and availability in large diameter (up to 12 inches), despite a 17% lattice mismatch and a strong difference in thermal expansion coefficient between GaN and Si, which makes the growth challenging. Although sapphire substrates combine a high resistivity and low cost, the low thermal conductivity leads to a significant self-heating, which is not suitable for power applications. Finally, the high cost of SiC is prohibitive for large volume applications despite its outstanding properties.Figure 16: Cross section of a typical AlGaN/GaN HEMT structure One of the main issues for GaN-based heteroepitaxy is the lattice mismatch and difference in thermal expansion coefficients with the substrate.

        <p>In order to grow crack-free and high quality GaN films by reducing the defect density, especially when using Si substrates, the tensile stress during the growth and cooling process needs to be limited. An AlN nucleation layer (NL) is typically used as an initiating layer for GaN growth. By using a AlN NL, the melt-back etching of Ga into Si can be avoided [72]. Besides, the AlN NL provides a GaN layer with a compressive strain due to the 2.5% lattice mismatch between AlN and GaN. This is necessary for compensating the tensile stress generated during the cooling process.In order to grow crack-free and high quality GaN films by reducing the defect density, especially when using Si substrates, the tensile stress during the growth and cooling process needs to be limited.

The p-GaN layer has shown a wide process window in terms of thickness and doping, which eases process control requirements. However, the low selectivity of the etching process between the p-GaN and the barrier layer needs to be carefully optimized in order to achieve a stable high threshold voltage [95]. ). As a consequence, the metal/p-GaN contacts are not ohmic in strict sense; their conductivity depends on the properties of the materials formed at the metal/semiconductor interface during deposition and annealing [104].An attractive method to achieve normally-off GaN transistors is the use of a p-doped GaN layer [99] under the gate area (Figure 23). The presence of the p-GaN layer lifts the band diagram to higher energies (Figure 24), so that the 2DEG depletion occurs even in the absence of an applied Also, a high Mg concentration in the p-GaN layer is required, which should be balanced with the deterioration of the crystal quality for too high Mg doping concentration.

        <p>Compared to conventional planar AlGaN/GaN HEMTs, tri-gate transistors feature fins patterned in the gate region which are conformably covered by a 3D gate electrode (Fig. 26(a-b)). While such architecture was first introduced for Si ultra-scale MOSFET in 2002 [108] to address the short channel effects, it was soon adopted for power devices. The first tri-gate GaN demonstration appeared in 2008 [109], followed by several other works which showed the several benefits of such architecture, such as the improved current stability, the lower subthreshold slope, and the reduced off-state leakage [110]- [113]. The most interesting feature of the tri-gate is however its ability to modulate the device threshold voltage (VTH) by simply tuning the fin width (wfin) (Fig. 26 (c)). Such effect has been attributed to the partial AlGaN strain relaxation when patterned into fins and by the fin sidewalls depletion due the side gate electrode [115]- [117].Compared to conventional planar AlGaN/GaN HEMTs, tri-gate transistors feature fins patterned in the gate region which are conformably covered by a 3D gate electrode (Fig. 26(a-b)).

        <p>The dependence of the device VTH on the fin width can be used to achieve normally-off operation by simply designing the proper wfin by lithography, without the need for any critical etching as for gate recess or p-GaN gates. However, early demonstrations based on this approach typically presented still negative VTH (at 1μA/mm) and degraded on-resistance due to the very small fin width required to achieve normally-off operation [110], [118]- [120]. Recently, a tri-gate device with 20 nm-wide fins in combination with a large work-function gate metal stack (Pt/Au) successfully showed full normally-off operation with a VTH of 0.64 V (at 1μA/mm) and a competitive RON of 7.4 Ω•mm [121]. To achieve such performance, however, very high-resolution lithographic processes are required both to define the fin width (which sets VTH) and to reduce the gap in-between fins (which degrades RON).

        <p>A promising approach consists of combining the tri-gate architecture with conventional methods to achieve normally-off operation such as recessed gate and p-GaN cap.

        <p>At the moment, commercial GaN normally-off devices are based either on the cascode or the pGaN technology.

        <p>In addition, the crystal quality is an important factor. Considering the high material defect density in GaN/ Si epilayers, recent studies [143], [144] showed that the presence of defects may impact on the breakdown voltage. As shown in Figs 28 (a-d) the FP extends helps to extend the depletion region from the gate to the drain electrode, alleviating the electric field peak at the gate edge. Various designs of field plates have been developed [148], [149], [151] (Fig. 28 and Fig. 29), including the single FP, multiple FPs, and the slant field plate, which is the most effective but also very challenging to realize in a planar process. These structures are based on the precise control of the dielectric thickness, which sets the field plate threshold voltage and should be carefully designed. For high-voltage GaN devices (typically 650 V) several FP structures with increasing dielectric thickness are combined to smoothen the electric field profile [152]. Under this point of view, the tri-gate architecture provides an interesting solution for the design of the lower voltage section of the FPs since the fin width can be easily designed in a slanted shape by lithography to gradually increase its threshold voltage. This results in an optimal electric field distribution which leads to significant breakdown voltage improvement [112], [153]. Besides, the ability to precisely tune the field plate threshold voltage is of great importance for AlGaN/GaN SBDs as it enables to reduce the voltage drop on the Schottky contact and thus greatly improve the diode blocking performance [153]- [157].In addition, the crystal quality is an important factor.

        <p>A limiting factor for the breakdown voltage of GaN-on-Si transistors is the poor critical electrical field strength of the Si substrate, together with a parasitic conduction at the buffer/substrate interface. In order to suppress the parasitic conduction phenomenon, local Si substrate removal (LSR) [166] has been shown to be very effective leading to significantly improved blocking voltage up to 3 kV [27], [167]. Once the front-side processing was completed, the Si substrate is locally etched up to the AlN nucleation layer around the entire device (see Figure 34). Devices with and without LSR have been fabricated on the same samples, eliminating any processing or epi variation during the device characterization.

        <p>Ultra-wide band gap materials such as AlN (6.2 eV) and related Al-rich AlGaN channel could allow for further improvement, especially in terms of voltage and temperature operations. This is primarily due to their much higher critical electric field resulting from a wider bandgap (see Figure 3). In addition, the use of an AlN back barrier would enable to both increase the electron confinement in the transistor channel and enhance the thermal dissipation. It has already been demonstrated that for extremely high temperature electronics, the properties of Al-rich transistors [169]- [171] are showing favorable comparisons to conventional wide bandgap materials. Despite the difficulty to achieve very high voltage operations due to the material quality and the ability to implement high Al content above 50%, some recent attempts showed the premise of voltage enhancement with AlGaN channels together with superior thermal stability. characteristics of transistors with regrown non-alloyed contacts showed a significant current density increase above 100 mA/mm as compared to identical devices with partially etched barrier and annealed contacts (see Figure 39). This is clearly resulting from the drastic drop of the contact resistances. In spite of these obstacles, preliminary results show that contact resistivity will improve over time and that advanced approaches such as the etch and regrowth processes will ensure successful achievement at even higher Al-composition. Despite the recent progress, the performance of AlGaN/GaN devices is still far from the theoretical limit predicted for the GaN materials [179]. A direct way to improve the device's performance is represented by increasing its carrier concentration, which directly leads to a reduced on-resistance.

        <p>While multi-channel devices have first been proposed for RF applications [184]- [187], there has been a growing interest in their use in power electronics applications. However, power devices present very specific requirements such as normally-off operation, large blocking voltage capabilities and good stability during switching operation, which need to be separately addressed and solved. The first power multi-channel power HEMT was reported in 2018 [188], followed by the demonstration of a high-voltage multi-channel SBD [189]. While these early works showed the concept of multi-channel power devices, their performance improvement was still quite limited due to the relatively high sheet resistance (~ 240 Ω/sq) of the multi-channel heterostructure employed. More recent works [178], [190], [191], however, showed the full potential of the multichannel technology for power devices. By employing a highly conducting multi-channel heterostructure (Rsh of 83 Ω/sq) in combination with a carefully designed slanted tri-gate structure, multi-channel power devices showing normally-off operation with VTH of 0.85 V (at 1 μA/mm), on-resistance of 3.2 Ω•mm and breakdown voltage of 1300 V (at 1 μA/mm) were demonstrated [178]. Such performance considerably surpasses the state-of-the-art of conventional singlechannel devices and opens new perspectives for GaN power devices (Figure 41). Besides, multichannel devices passivated by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) Si3N4 presented reduced current collapse up to high voltage stress and excellent VTH stability both during switching and high-temperature operation, showing the potential of such technology [192]. Further research on this topic will likely concentrate on the optimization of the multi-channel heterostructure and on additional methods to achieve large positive VTH. Super Junction (SJ) devices have revolutionized silicon power devices leading to unprecedented performance well beyond the one-dimensional material limit [194], [195]. It is thus likely that eventually power devices based on other semiconductor material will embrace this technology too.While multi-channel devices have first been proposed for RF applications [184]- [187], there has been a growing interest in their use in power electronics applications. However, power devices present very specific requirements such as normally-off operation, large blocking voltage capabilities and good stability during switching operation, which need to be separately addressed and solved. The first power multi-channel power HEMT was reported in 2018 [188], followed by the demonstration of a high-voltage multi-channel SBD [189]. While these early works showed the concept of multi-channel power devices, their performance improvement was still quite limited due to the relatively high sheet resistance (~ 240 Ω/sq) of the multi-channel heterostructure employed. More recent works [178], [190], [191], however, showed the full potential of the multichannel technology for power devices. By employing a highly conducting multi-channel heterostructure (Rsh of 83 Ω/sq) in combination with a carefully designed slanted tri-gate structure, multi-channel power devices showing normally-off operation with VTH of 0.85 V (at 1 μA/mm), on-resistance of 3.2 Ω•mm and breakdown voltage of 1300 V (at 1 μA/mm) were demonstrated [178]. Such performance considerably surpasses the state-of-the-art of conventional singlechannel devices and opens new perspectives for GaN power devices (Figure 41). Besides, multichannel devices passivated by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) Si3N4 presented reduced current collapse up to high voltage stress and excellent VTH stability both during switching and high-temperature operation, showing the potential of such technology [192]. Further research on this topic will likely concentrate on the optimization of the multi-channel heterostructure and on additional methods to achieve large positive VTH.

        <p>The realization of conventional vertical SJ (Figure 42) in GaN is however not straightforward due to difficult technological challenges, among which the inefficient Mg-based p-doping of GaN is one of the most relevant. On the one side, the reduced Mg activation ratio results in relatively low doping concentrations, which, combined with the difficult control of the exact doping level, make charge-matching extremely challenging. On the other side, the absence of efficient implantation doping and high-quality p-GaN regrowth, hinder the realization of the typical vertical SJ pillars.The realization of conventional vertical SJ (Figure 42) in GaN is however not straightforward due to difficult technological challenges, among which the inefficient Mg-based p-doping of GaN is one of the most relevant.

        <p>In most cases, III-nitride devices are manufactured along the Ga-polar (0001) orientation, as extensively discussed in Section 3. Significant research efforts are underway to develop devices with inverted polarity: N-polar HEMTs (000-1) can have several advantages, compared to the Gapolar counterparts, due to the fact that the 2DEG is induced above (instead of below) the AlGaN barrier layer [205], [206], with a stack including a GaN-channel, an AlGaN barrier and a GaN buffer.In most cases, III-nitride devices are manufactured along the Ga-polar (0001) orientation, as extensively discussed in Section 3.

        <p>The most common GaN-based power devices available presently are GaN HEMTs, which have been discussed in detail in the previous sections. GaN HEMTs rated for 650 V/900 V breakdown voltage (BV) and maximum output DC current (IDS) as high as 150 A are available commercially [212]- [214] for a broad spectrum of applications, such as on-board battery chargers, highefficiency and high-density power converters, solar panel inverters, among many others.The most common GaN-based power devices available presently are GaN HEMTs, which have been discussed in detail in the previous sections.

        <p>However, the lateral topology of HEMTs presents some pertinent limitations related to reliability and breakdown voltage scaling, which hinder the usability of these devices for high voltage applications requiring breakdown voltages above 700 V, for example in electric and hybrid electric vehicles (EVs and HEVs), photovoltaic (PV) inverters, wind turbines, traction systems for trains, to name a few.However, the lateral topology of HEMTs presents some pertinent limitations related to reliability and breakdown voltage scaling, which hinder the usability of these devices for high voltage applications requiring breakdown voltages above 700 V, for example in electric and hybrid electric vehicles (EVs and HEVs), photovoltaic (PV) inverters, wind turbines, traction systems for trains, to name a few.</p>
        <p>Most of the limitations associated with GaN HEMTs arise from the lateral electron flow between the source and drain terminals, very close to the device surface. The density of electrons in the channel is sensitive to the presence of surface traps, that may degrade the electrical performance [215]- [217] of the transistors. This leads to issues like current collapse and dynamic degradation of the on resistance, which are more severe with increasing the BV rating of the device (see Sections 8.2 and 9). In addition, the lateral nature of the transport results in a very inhomogeneous distribution of the electric field in the device, peaking in specific regions (e.g. the edge of the gate, or of the field plate, on the drain side). This may enhance electron trapping at surface states, and may lead to premature breakdown of the semiconductor and of dielectrics. This ultimately degrades the forward and reverse performance of the device [217], [218], and limits its full voltage blocking potential. For traditional GaN HEMTs, the BV is dictated by the gate to drain spacing (provided this value is smaller than the drain-to-substrate BV) and thus larger breakdown voltages require larger device sizes, which also increases the device cost. Another major concern is that GaN HEMTs are in general normally-on devices: this is not desirable for power electronics applications from a safety perspective and for simplicity of the gate drivers, which are currently designed for normally-off devices. As discussed in Section 6.2, Several methods to achieve normally-OFF operation have been developed including cascode [219]- [221] configuration (based on GaN HEMT combined with a Si MOSFET), fluorine ion implantation [81], [91], [97] under the gate region, recessing the barrier layer [84] in the gate region, by applying tri-gate structures [111], [112], [121], [122], [190] to the gate region, among others. However, in many cases and even for commercial devices, the threshold voltage (Vth) that can be achieved is only around 1-2 V, which may not be ideal for fail-safe operation. Finally, GaN HEMTs do not present avalanche capability, which can prevent device failure under short term over-voltage conditions. Thus, for a GaN HEMT to qualify for a certain BV rating, the device has to be overdesigned to sustain a much higher BV, which increases the device size and cost.Most of the limitations associated with GaN HEMTs arise from the lateral electron flow between the source and drain terminals, very close to the device surface.

        <p>Vertical GaN power devices are different from their lateral counterparts as the current flows vertically, i.e., parallel to the growth direction of the epitaxial GaN layers. The vast majority of the Si and SiC power devices available commercially are based on this design philosophy and are capable of delivering high ON-state currents (&gt; 7000 A) and high BVs (&gt; 8000 V) [222]. For GaN, the vertical topology offers distinct advantages over lateral power HEMTs. The BV can be increased by increasing the thickness of the voltage blocking layer, generally formed by an unintentionally or low doped GaN layer (also referred to as the drift layer or i-GaN layer), independent of the size of the device. The RON in PiN diodes increases only slightly [223] with increasing the thickness of the drift layer as a result of extrinsic phenomena like conductivity modulation [224], [225]. Vertical devices are also not affected by surface traps as in GaN HEMTs, and the electric field peaks well inside the GaN layers, away from the surface, thus improving the device breakdown voltage and reliability. In addition, vertical MOSFETs can provide high positive Vth of 5-15 V, which is well suited for higher power applications like in automobiles. Another major advantage is the existence of avalanche breakdown [226]- [228] for GaN vertical power devices. This greatly improves the reliability, and eliminates the need to overdesign the device.Vertical GaN power devices are different from their lateral counterparts as the current flows vertically, i.e., parallel to the growth direction of the epitaxial GaN layers.

        <p>The ideal solution for obtaining high quality GaN epitaxial layers is by homo-epitaxy i.e., GaN layers grown on bulk GaN substrates. These substrates are mainly produced by hydride vaporphase epitaxy (HVPE), although several other methods like Na-flux or ammonothermal growth are currently being investigated [229]- [234]. The major advantages of growing GaN by homoepitaxy are their low dislocation density of 10 4 -10 6 /cm 2 and the inherently matched lattice and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) to the grown GaN layers. As a result, thick GaN layers suitable for achieving high-voltage (~ 5000 V) [235], [236] vertical power devices can be easily grown on these substrates. The downside is that these substrates are very expensive, at about 50 $/cm 2, and mostly available in small 2-inch wafer diameters [237]; strategies for larger size substrates are currently under investigation [229], [238] []. This hinders the widespread commercialization of devices grown on bulk GaN. The bulk GaN market is also highly concentrated, as three companies based out of Japan hold about 85% stake in the bulk GaN market [239]. Currently, these expensive substrates are being used only for special applications, like laser diodes and high-brightness LEDs [239], for which low dislocation densities are essential. Hence, in order to take advantage of the material benefits offered by GaN materials for power device applications, further improvements in wafer size and reduction in cost are highly desirable.The ideal solution for obtaining high quality GaN epitaxial layers is by homo-epitaxy i.e., GaN layers grown on bulk GaN substrates.

        <p>However, over the past decade, improvements in wafer size have been relatively slow, which is a critical aspect for reducing the production cost per device. A strategy to tackle this issue would be by hetero-epitaxy i.e., GaN layers grown on foreign substrates like Si, SiC and sapphire, which are cheaper than bulk GaN and are available up to 12-inch diameters [240], [241]. However, these substrates are both lattice and CTE mismatched to GaN, as shown in Table 6. This results in a high defect density in the GaN crystalline structure as a result of the stress built up during growth.However, over the past decade, improvements in wafer size have been relatively slow, which is a critical aspect for reducing the production cost per device.

        <p>[255], [264]. Arizona State University reported on the beneficial effects of growing a thick buffer layer of about 1 µm on the bulk GaN substrate prior to subsequent growth [266]. They also investigated in details the regrowth of p-GaN layers on etched GaN surfaces [254], [267]. Regrowth of p-GaN is an important topic, especially since ion implantation schemes for the realization of JTE (junction termination extension) structures similar to Si and SiC carbide vertical power devices are very complicated in GaN and still not available. The study revealed that the regrowth process could result in a slight increase in the edge dislocations and a high concentration of Si and O impurity atoms at the growth interface (Figure 47(a)). In a subsequent work [267], the reason for this high impurity atom concentration was shown to be from the defective etching process, and a low power etching coupled with UV-ozone/acid treatment of the etched surface prior to the p-GaN regrowth was presented as a remedy to this issue. A novel edge termination scheme was also introduced by passivating the p-GaN around the anode region by hydrogen plasma [265], to obtain significant gains in the BV (Figure 47 (b)). for GaN p-i-n diodes by researchers from Kyoto University [228]. The study set forth important design instructions, particularly the angle of the bevel, the thickness and the doping of the GaN layers, etc.[255], [264].

        <p>Unlike PiN diodes, SBDs are unipolar devices, which find applications in power converters by virtue of their low turn-on voltage as well as absence of reverse recovery charge. Due to the absence of a p-type layer, and thus conductivity modulation, SBDs normally have a higher RON compared to PiN diodes [271]. The reverse leakage current is also higher as the reverse voltage is accumulation on the leakage current of GaN SBDs [279]. In their study, initial failure of SBDs at low voltages were ascribed to leakage current path through polygonal pits created by C impurity accumulation during the growth process. Their group also perfected the method of achieving low impurity levels in m-plane GaN, approaching c-plane values by using a quartz-free flow channel [280]. In 2019, they reported on the effect of drift layer thickness on BV, along with the demonstration of vertical GaN SBD with the highest reported BV of 2.4 kV for a drift layer thickness of 30 µm [281]. A reduction in the effective donor concentration with increasing the thickness of the drift layer was observed by secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and is believed to have a positive effect on achieving such a high BV. In a recent publication, their group presented their results on SBDs with a drift layer compensated for the un-intentional n-type doping by introducing Mg dopants during the growth [282]. The resulting SBDs provided more than 3x- They could achieve a low Ron,sp of 1 mΩcm 2 and an excellent BV of 1.7 kV (Figure 56).

A higher BV of 880 V was achieved by Ji et al. [300] in a subsequent report by improving the gate trench etching quality and by using a gate dielectric, which reduced the gate to drain leakage. However, as a result of using a MIS structure for the gate, the VGS shifted to -21 V from 20 V for the previous report.[299] demonstrated a GaN CAVET with a similar gate trench structure but without the p-GaN gate and achieved 20 V threshold voltage, and a BV of 225 V.

        <p>Some aspects associated with the GaN CAVET need to be addressed to make this transistor viable for commercial use. The main issue stems from the regrowth process, which introduces high source to drain and gate to drain leakage currents in the majority of the reported devices. The on-state performance is also very sensitive to the doping and dimension of the aperture region formed between the adjacent CBLs, which is difficult to control due to the relatively complicated fabrication process. kV and Ron,sp of 12.1 mΩcm 2 . In 2015 [301], they reported a similar device with Ron,sp improved to 1.8 mΩcm 2 , along with a high BV of 1.2 kV. This was achieved by tuning the doping and thickness of the p-GaN channel region and the i-GaN layer. The Mg doping of the p-GaN channel layer was reduced, which resulted in lower scattering of inversion channel electrons by the dopant atoms, and they also slightly increased the doping of the i-GaN layer. Large area trench MOSFETs [302] with on-state current over 10 A while still maintaining a high BV of over 1.2 kV was also reported by the same group in 2016, which indicates that dislocation densities from bulk GaN substrates do not necessarily become a bottleneck for obtaining both high BV and high on-state current with large area devices (Figure 57(b)). A hexagonal cell array was employed for achieving a high gate width per unit cell area, leading to an increase in a current density and, thus, a reduction in the Ron,sp. Very recently [307], their group also demonstrated a vertical trench MOSFET with a current distribution layer (CDL) below the p-GaN as shown in Figure 58 (a). The CDL consists of a thin slightly n-type doped (2 × 10 16 /cm 3 ) layer which can better distribute the current from the base of the gate trench. This resulted in 1.17x-higher forward current density and an absolute value of current of 100 A was achieved for large area MOSFETs using the CDL (Figure 58 (b)). HRL Laboratories developed a method to avoid plasma etch damage to the p-GaN body contact region by selective area regrowth of n-GaN on top of the p-GaN. They demonstrated a 0.5 mm 2 large area trench MOSFET with an Ron,sp of 8.5 mΩcm 2 , threshold voltage of 4.8 V and a BV of 600 V. A detailed analysis of the dependence of main device parameters on gate dielectric thickness, body layer doping level and cleaning process was presented recently in [308]. In a traditional vertical trench gate MOSFET with a n-p-i-n heterostructure, the channel region is formed by the n-p-i sidewall of the trench gate structure; on the application of a positive gate bias above the threshold voltage, an inversion sheet charge of electrons is formed in the p-GaN layer adjacent to the gate dielectric. Since the channel is formed by dry etching, the field effect mobility of the inversion channel electrons is degraded by the defects in the sidewall formed during the etching process. In order to alleviate this issue, Prof. Mishra's group at UCSB devised a technique [311] whereby a thin undoped GaN layer is regrown in the gate trench region by MOCVD, followed by in-situ Al2O3 dielectric deposition as shown in Figure 59(a).

        <p>A normally-off operation with a threshold voltage of 2 V was also achieved along with a BV of 195 V. Subsequent devices [309] on bulk GaN substrates provided a higher BV of 990 V aided by a low damage gate trench etching process. Ji et al. reported large-area (0.2 mm 2 ) OGFETs with an output current close to 0.5 A and a BV of 320 V.

        <p>This is the author's peer reviewed, accepted manuscript. However, the online version of record will be different from this version once it has been copyedited and typeset. In recent years, vertical fin power FETs [315] have been demonstrated, with sub-micron fins on bulk GaN substrates. The advantage over classical trench MOSFETs is that they do not require a p-GaN layer to provide normally-off operation and blocking under off-state. The gate region of these devices consists of dielectric/gate metal on the fin sidewalls, which deplete the charge carriers in the fin due to the work function difference between the gate metal and the GaN, providing a normally-off operation (Figure 62). However, the fin needs to be sufficiently narrow (&lt; 500 nm) to be completely depleted, which degrades the current capability of the device. The initial devices presented by Sun et al. [315] from MIT revealed a threshold of 1 V, Ron,sp of 0.36 mΩcm 2 , and a BV of 800 V with a fin width of 450 nm. The device works by accumulation of electrons rather than by inversion as in the case of trench gate MOSFETs and high electron mobility of 150 cm 2 /Vs was obtained in the accumulation layer.This is the author's peer reviewed, accepted manuscript.

        <p>Zhang et al. [314] further optimized the fin width to obtain a higher BV of 1200 V and a lower Ron,sp of 0.2 mΩcm 2 , normalized to the total device area (Figure 60(b)). Large area devices with a current capability of 10 A and a BV of 800 V were also demonstrated simultaneously. Switching characteristics [317] of these fin power FETs with a BV of 1200 V and output current capability of 5 A were compared against commercial 0.9-1.2 kV class Si and SiC power transistors, revealing the lowest input capacitance (CISS), output capacitance (COSS), gate charge (QG), gate to drain charge (QGD), and reverse recovery charge (Qrr). These devices exhibited high-frequency (∼MHz) switching capabilities and superior switching figure of merits (FOMs) as compared to Si and SiC devices used for comparison. However, these devices break catastrophically, which is possibly due to the absence of p-GaN layers to modulate the electric field peaks. Also, the fabrication and control of the fin width could increase the fabrication complexity compared to other vertical devices. Since the threshold voltage is relatively low ~ 1V, a well-designed gate driver is required to ensure fail-safe operation. Recently, fin-FET and nanowire-based structures based on a npn vertical stack have been proposed to obtain robust normally-off operation [318], [319]: the integration of a p-type layer in a 3D stack (either nanowire-or fin-based) was demonstrated to be a good strategy for achieving robust normally-off operation, also under gate-stress experiments [320] (Figure 63). As presented in the previous sections, the ideal solution for obtaining high quality GaN layers with defect density less than 10 6 /cm 2 would be homo-epitaxy i.e., GaN grown on bulk GaN, as there would not be any lattice mismatch between substrate and epitaxial layer. However, even after the demonstration of high-performance diodes and transistors with excellent ON-as well as OFF-state characteristics, the commercialization of vertical GaN power devices have been hindered by the high cost and the small diameter of these bulk GaN substrates. Currently, these expensive substrates are being used only for specific applications in lasers and LED [239]. Hence, in order to take advantage of the material benefits that GaN offers for power device applications, further improvements in wafer size and reduction in cost are highly desirable. A strategy to tackle this issue is by adopting GaN grown on cheaper foreign substrates like Si and sapphire. GaN-on-Si growth has been widely researched and commercialized for the lateral GaN HEMT technology. A similar approach could be embraced for vertical power devices as well. Furthermore, GaN-on-Si growth could give 10-100 times lower wafer + epitaxy cost [237], [322] as compared to bulk GaN.Zhang et al. [314] further optimized the fin width to obtain a higher BV of 1200 V and a lower Ron,sp of 0.2 mΩcm 2 , normalized to the total device area (Figure 60(b)).

        <p>Si substrates also provide better thermal and electrical conductivity as compared to sapphire, in addition to more mature fabrication processes for the back-end processing. But the main advantage of GaN on Si is that Si substrates are commercially available up to 12-inch diameters which could drastically reduce the overall cost per unit of the device. The adoption of Si substrates could also allow current CMOS compatible fabs to mass produce GaN-on-Si device thus saving the high cost normally required for setting up new technology fabs. Recently, a new class of engineered substrates with poly-AlN has been introduced [323]- [326]. The main advantage of these substrates is their coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) matched to GaN and thus enabling the growth of thick, high-quality stress-free GaN with lower defect density as compared to GaN-on-Si substrates [30,102]. Thus, the future for GaN-on-Si vertical devices seems very promising. GaN-on-Si p-i-n and Schottky diodes [321] with a BV of 300 V and 205 V respectively (Figure 64). Even with a high defect density of 10 9 /cm 2 , a peak electric field of 2.9 MV/cm could be achieved. The current leakage paths, leakage mechanisms and methods to improve the leakage current were thoroughly researched and identified in a later work [322]. A device termination scheme based on ion implantation and anode field plate was found to reduce the leakage current by almost two orders of magnitude. For GaN layers grown on Si substrates, the traditional device structure is quasi-vertical, in which both top and bottom layers are accessed through the device top surface. This results in a non-uniform distribution of current from the anode and current crowding at the bottom GaN layer near the cathode terminal. In order to alleviate this issue, Zou. et al., demonstrated a method of making a fully-vertical p-i-n diode [327] by removing the Si substrate below the GaN layers, followed by transfer of GaN epilayers to a carrier wafer as shown in Figure 65(a).

        <p>The properties of GaN as a semiconductor material are determined by the specific periodicity of its crystalline structure. If this periodicity is lost, either due to incorporation of foreign atoms into the crystal or to a non-ideal arrangement of the host atoms during the growth of the material, a defect is locally generated. Defects are referred to as "impurity-related" in the former case, whereas they are defined as "native" in the latter. The presence of these defects locally perturbs the periodic potential of the lattice, therefore introducing allowed energy states within the forbidden bandgap of the material. These states, that can either act as carrier traps or recombination centers, can have a detrimental impact on both the performance and the reliability of GaN-based devices. It is therefore of primary importance to identify the properties and the physical origin that such states have in actual GaN devices. To this aim, a database of traps and deep-levels related to the GaN material system has been created by collecting and comparing the data of almost one hundred scientific publications (Table 7). The comparison of the 480+ records of traps experimentally detected in GaN by means of various techniques allowed us to correlate energy positioning, signature and trapping behavior of the levels accredited to the defects most commonly found in GaN.

        <p>Carbon doping is commonly adopted in the buffer region of power transistors to increase the blocking voltage. When this is the case, the carbon doped buffer can be the site for peculiar trapping mechanisms, that are mainly governed by the CN acceptor state at EV+0.9 eV [135], [470], [474]. Holes are emitted by these traps within the gate-drain access region when the device is in the OFF state, leading to an increase in the density of negatively-ionized CN acceptors, and therefore to a dynamic increase in the channel conductivity and RON [468], [479]. It has been shown that both RON increasing transients under off-state bias stress and subsequent RON recovery transients may be thermally activated with the same activation energy of 0.9 eV [499], [500].

        <p>Synchronous and short voltage pulses, typically in the 100 ns-10 us range with a duty-cycle in the 0.1 %-1 % range, are applied to the gate and drain terminals to evaluate the device I-V characteristics. The basic idea is that traps are not able to reach their equilibrium condition during the short duration of the pulses. Therefore, the measurement yields the I-V characteristics of the device obtained with the traps filled at the condition set by the quiescent bias point. Since trap filling condition strongly depend on the applied voltages, comparing pulsed I-V obtained at different quiescent bias points quickly allows to evaluate the presence and in some way the amount of trapping phenomena. A typical set of pulsed I-V is performed by comparing at least three or more different quiescent bias points [445], [523], [524]: (i) the VGS=0 V,VDS=0 V QBP, which sets also the reference of the "fresh" device conditions; (ii) gate-lag effect is then evaluated with a QBP where VGS is held below the device threshold voltage and VDS=0 V; (iii) drain-lag effect is finally evaluated by a QBP with the device in off-state conditions and large VDS. Obviously, many other combinations can be considered by the three reported are the most used for device characterization. PIV characterization quickly offers an overview on device operation and a qualitative evaluation of the reduced device performance due to trapping phenomena.

When three terminal devices are tested, these techniques suffer from the low device capacitance (typically in the pF range), making them less appealing for trap characterization. Furthermore, the electric field distribution in actual transistors in normal bias conditions can be significantly different from that in large area diodes. Consequently, while DLTS and DLOS can definitely provide useful information on crystal impurities, they might not be able to provide a clear indication on the effects of said impurities on actual device dynamic operation.DLTS and DLOS techniques are typically applied to large area diodes, in order to have a well measurable capacitance value.

        <p>Trapping sensing in DLTS and DLOS is provided by evaluating capacitance transients induced by depletion region variations linked to the emission of trapped charge. On an actual device, the effect of charge emission can be monitored by evaluating the drain current evolution as the emission process takes place. In fact, an emission of trapped electrons will lead to a decrease in the fixed negative charge within the device, leading to an increase in its 2DEG concentration [532], and, therefore, an increase in its drain current. Drain current transients (DCTs) are typically evaluated by monitoring the device current in on-state, after applying for a certain time a different bias condition typically in off-state condition (corresponding to the application of a VGS below device VTH and large VDS). It should be stressed though that this is only one of the possible biasing conditions. Generally speaking, any variation in the device bias point can in principle lead to a variation in traps occupancy and thus cause during the emission process the observation of a DCTs.Trapping sensing in DLTS and DLOS is provided by evaluating capacitance transients induced by depletion region variations linked to the emission of trapped charge.

        <p>The CID-DLTS/DLOS [428], [535] technique is based on a dynamic control of either the device gate or drain voltages with the aim of maintaining a fixed drain current in response to a thermally and optically stimulated trap emission. For a gate-controlled method, a constant and large enough VDS is applied to the device to have it working in its saturation region. The gate terminal is pulsed to the on-state to induce trap filling, and then lowered near pinch-off conditions. The dynamic control on VGS for maintaining a constant IDS will thus give rise to a VGS transient, that will thus be recorded. This condition is sensitive for trap levels located beneath the gate contact and affecting device VTH. For a drain-controlled method the device is biased in its linear region with low VDS and a VGS large enough to have a negligible forward transconductance gm. Filling condition is here obtained by biasing the device in pinch-off conditions with large VDS. The subsequent change in device resistance ΔRD=ΔVDS/IDS is then recorded. This condition is particularly sensitive to traps located in the device access regions.

Therefore, DCTs results needs to be carefully reviewed to avoid an erroneous estimation of the activation energy associated with the trap level causing the observed DCTs. Based on the comments and issues reported in this section, the authors would like to suggest that, to have an accurate estimation of the trap activation energy, VDS voltages applied during the sensing condition should be as low as possible, in order to reduce self-heating and electric field related enhanced emission. The use of pulsed-drain current transient (P-DCT) methodologies can also be effective to this aim, since the device is kept at zero bias during recovery, and short voltage pulses are used to sense the onresistance during the de-trapping phase [537].In other words, the de-trapping appears faster than it should be at the applied base-plate temperature [543].

[567] As shown in Figure 81 Since the defect-creation process is field-assisted, operation of a device at a larger gate overdrive causes a faster degradation, as commonly observed; in reliability tests a β parameter of the Weibull distribution larger than 1 may be extrapolated, consistently with a degradation related to intrinsic causes. [568], [569] Before catastrophic failure occurs, detected effects on the device performance include increase in the gate leakage current due to the creation and destruction of the metastable conduction paths (see Figure 82) [570] and the increase in gate leakage absolute value, [571] but the effects on the device performance in terms of threshold voltage and drain current are minor.

        <p>When a stress below the catastrophic failure is applied, a time-dependent degradation process might still be present, leading to sudden jumps and a larger noise in the gate current level. [577] The jumps are associated to the appearance of additional electroluminescence spots at the gate edge, suggesting that conductive paths are created in the gate stack due to a defect generation and percolation process, similar to what was found in the case of dielectrics in the previous section. [578] Early reports suggested that the traps are created due to impact ionization of electrons injected from the channel into the p-GaN region and accelerated by the high electric field. [579] This idea still needs to be supported by spectral electroluminescence measurements; so far, no band-to-band recombination and only bremsstrahlung and yellow luminescence, [578] or other sub-bandgap wavelengths have been detected. [580] Tallarico et al. [581] investigated HEMTs with a p-type gate, with a Schottky metal/p-GaN junction: they showed that during stress a large voltage drop falls on the depleted region of the p-GaN, and this contributes to the percolation process.When a stress below the catastrophic failure is applied, a time-dependent degradation process might still be present, leading to sudden jumps and a larger noise in the gate current level.

[578] Early reports suggested that the traps are created due to impact ionization of electrons injected from the channel into the p-GaN region and accelerated by the high electric field. [579] This idea still needs to be supported by spectral electroluminescence measurements; so far, no band-to-band recombination and only bremsstrahlung and yellow luminescence, [578] or other sub-bandgap wavelengths have been detected.

Even though the degradation is found to be faster at higher temperature, [584] a different behavior can be seen in case of more complex degradation processes.

        <p>The presence of the hole trapping is confirmed by the fact that the gate current decreases during stress, due to the electrostatic repulsion between the injected and trapped holes.

It is worth mentioning that carrier acceleration and impact ionization are also less prominent at high temperatures, due to the increased scattering, and this can also contribute to the positive temperature coefficient.The presence of the hole trapping is confirmed by the fact that the gate current decreases during stress, due to the electrostatic repulsion between the injected and trapped holes.

        <p>In the case of RF devices, a common degradation cause is the presence of hot electrons in near pinch-off conditions, especially when short channel effects and poor carrier confinement play a role due to the reduced gate length. Since the process is influenced by the source-drain leakage, a correct compensation of the buffer conductivity can significantly improve the reliability of the devices, with Fe and C co-doping leading to the best results. [593] The degradation mechanism is field-driven, as suggested by tests on devices with and without field-plates. [594] A RF stress usually induces small variations in the DC performance of state-of-the art devices, mainly a lowering of the saturation current and a decrease in gate leakage, [595] but the generation of defects causes an increase in the dynamic current collapse. [596] A negative [597] or positive [598] shift in threshold voltage is also observed sometimes, due to the presence of traps in the cap and barrier layer. [597] The important conclusion comes from the comparison between devices stressed in DC and RF conditions, showing different degradation modes and a stronger degradation in the RF case. [597] This suggests that, even for power devices, it may be important to test the degradation not only in ON-state, OFF-state and SEMI-ON-state separately, but to test it also in the real switching pattern, to take into account the interplay between the different mechanisms and time dependence occurring in the various bias points of the switching locus.[599]In the case of RF devices, a common degradation cause is the presence of hot electrons in near pinch-off conditions, especially when short channel effects and poor carrier confinement play a role due to the reduced gate length.

        <p>The OFF-state bias condition can be highly stressful for a power device, due to the high electric field present, on average, in the blocking region and peaking in critical device regions, such as the sharp corners and the gate edge. The electric field can cause damage to materials that are part of the device without being the semiconductor itself, such as the insulators for passivation and gate isolation. Other processes may involve the breakdown of GaN itself. In addition, interaction with the external atmosphere may promote field-assisted chemical reactions. In some cases, the high electric field can also be present together with a high current density, such as during avalanche conduction. In the following, we will discuss all these possibilities.The OFF-state bias condition can be highly stressful for a power device, due to the high electric field present, on average, in the blocking region and peaking in critical device regions, such as the sharp corners and the gate edge.

        <p>As discussed in section 9.1.1, degradation of the dielectrics is usually present in ON-state stress conditions, since the voltage drop across the gate insulator is the highest, whereas in OFF-state stress the large voltage drop in the depleted semiconductor mitigates the electric field across the gate stack. Therefore, some of the results already presented in section 9.1.1 still hold, even when a larger bias is applied: the better reliability of engineered bilayer insulators, [339], [572] the location of weak spots corresponding to electric field peaks [573], and the negative [566] or positive [600] threshold voltage shift related to defect generation, which may also cause worse dynamic performance. [566] Nevertheless, additional dielectrics are present in the complex structure of a state-of-the-art GaN power devices, such as the ones used for passivation and isolation of the field-plates. Their degradation results in an increase in gate leakage level and noise, eventually leading to catastrophic failure even significantly below the breakdown voltage of the device; dielectric degradation is typically characterized by an exponential dependence of the average time to failure on the stress voltage. [601] In this case, the shape parameter β of the Weibull distribution is lower than 1, suggesting that reliability is limited by extrinsic factors.

        <p>As can be seen through numerical simulations (Figure 87 (a)), in the case described in [601], in off-state conditions the peak of the electric field is located in the silicon nitride, in proximity of the edge of the gate overhang on the drain side, and the value is ~6 MV/cm, comparable with the theoretical breakdown electric field (∼ 6 MV/cm). [601] The electric field in the AlGaN barrier is lower than 3 MV/cm, therefore degradation in this layer is unlikely. This hypothesis can be confirmed by locating the failure spot by means of electroluminescence measurements (Figure 87 (c)) and performing cross-sectional transmission electron microscope (TEM) failure analysis on it.

        <p>This behavior is not only theoretical, but can be experimentally measured by means of interferometric techniques on GaN crystals. [603] The amount of displacement caused by different voltages applied to a 2.5 µm thick single crystal [0001] GaN film is shown in Figure 89, and corresponds to a displacement of 0.05 nm at an electric field of 64000 V/cm, i.e. to a displacement of 1.56 nm at an electric field of 2 MV/cm. The electric field peak found close to the gate edge at the drain side in common HEMT devices is close or can even exceed this value, even in presence of multiple field plates, in common high power operation. Therefore, one may wonder if this level of displacement (without considering the different value of the piezoelectric coefficients between the reported GaN film and the AlGaN of the barrier) can cause damage to the device and limit its reliability. Of course, a localized electric field would not be enough to produce a displacement, since the lattice would build up strain to accommodate for the expected local displacement, but the levels of piezoelectric stress originated by the expected variation can be very high, in the order of hundreds of MPa.

PLEASE CITE THIS ARTICLE AS DOI: 10.1063/5.0061354 This idea was proposed for the first time in 2006, [606] and a lot of work has been done to identify this mechanism in the following years. Specific tests have found the presence of a critical gate or drain voltage for the degradation, consistent with the build-up of a critical amount of strain in the structure before relaxation and formation of defects takes place. [606] When stressed above the critical voltage, an increase in charge trapping inside the AlGaN barrier takes place, consistently with the generation of defects in that region, whereas the trapping in the buffer remains unaffected. [607] By means of stresses at different gate voltages and current levels it was possible to exclude any effect of the hot electrons in the process, since the stress current was found to have no impact on the critical voltage value. [608] The generation of cracks only at the drain side of the gate taking place above the critical voltage, without any impact in the degradation of temperature or hot electrons, was reported by TEM measurements. [609] The generation of indentations, pits and grooves at the drain side of the gate edge was confirmed also by atomic force microscope (AFM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) testing of stressed devices after chemical etching of the gate metal, as shown in Figure 90. At least some of the new pits form without the presence of any pre-existing defects, consistently with the inverse piezoelectric effect. The defects act as gate leakage paths, may reduce the maximum drain current and favor the charge trapping in the device. Similar effects can be produced by reaction with hydroxyl groups (OH -) or water. [612] In this case, the degradation happens due to anodic oxidation of the AlGaN layer in the electrochemical cell composed of the gate metal, the passivation layer and the barrier, aided by water and by the presence of holes. The main effects are a degradation in drain current and dynamic performance, whereas in this case the increase in gate leakage is not caused by the presence of the pits.This behavior is not only theoretical, but can be experimentally measured by means of interferometric techniques on GaN crystals.

        <p>One can then wonder if GaN itself, when deeply depleted, can behave as a dielectric and experience a TDDB-like degradation process. In general, detecting a TDDB process in a full GaN power device can be complex, due to the large number of parts and materials it is composed of, each of them possibly contributing to the degradation as discussed in this Section 9. Moreover, if a device is not fully vertical, both a lateral and a vertical electric field are present, further complicating the analysis. Therefore, even though the presence of GaN TDDB was suggested in the past, no demonstration excluding other possible causes was provided. [614], [615] For this reason, the first conclusive demonstration of time-dependent dielectric breakdown in the GaN itself was done on optoelectronic devices. [616] LEDs have an intrinsic vertical structure, no complex parts such as field plates, gate with various geometries, blocking dielectrics or engineered passivation, and are already at a high technology readiness level, allowing for testing of stable and reliable devices with no reliability and behavioral issues, which is not the case for fully-vertical power devices.One can then wonder if GaN itself, when deeply depleted, can behave as a dielectric and experience a TDDB-like degradation process.

        <p>When a lateral power device is biased in the off-state, a large voltage drop is present in all the layers from drain to substrate, which usually include the AlN nucleation layer, an AlGaN buffer and a carbon-doped GaN buffer. Understanding which of these layers has the strongest impact on the vertical breakdown voltage and on device reliability is a critical task for improving the final behavior. This can be done by testing separate structures, where the growth has been stopped after each of the single layers above the Si substrate, to form AlN/Si, AlGaN/AlN/Si, and C:GaN/AlGaN/AlN/Si stacks. [618] [619] This way, the variation in reliability (and charge trapping) induced by each layer can be analyzed independently. In order to do this, a mandatory technical requirement is the processing of good ohmic contacts on top of each layer, a non-trivial task on low-conductivity and wide-bandgap materials.When a lateral power device is biased in the off-state, a large voltage drop is present in all the layers from drain to substrate, which usually include the AlN nucleation layer, an AlGaN buffer and a carbon-doped GaN buffer.

        <p>In addition, it was demonstrated that the AlN/Si structures show trapping of negative charge, which has been ascribed to the injection of electrons from the Si substrate towards deep traps located in the AlN. By adding an AlGaN layer on top of the AlN, it is possible to significantly reduce the density of defects, and this results in a more uniform sample-to-sample leakage current. A strong increase in the breakdown voltage can be reached by adding a C:GaN layer on top of the stack. In this case, the structures analyzed in [619] showed breakdown voltages larger than 800 V. It is worth noticing that the presence of a C:GaN layer can result in positive charge trapping.

        <p>As already mentioned for AlN in Section 9.2.2.4, in general the breakdown of (Al)GaN-on-Si is not ascribed to avalanche, but to the presence of large densities of defects: vertical GaN-on-GaN devices (having significantly lower dislocation densities compared to GaN-on-Si) can withstand higher electric fields, and reach the avalanche regime. The impact ionization coefficients for GaN have been recently estimated, as summarized in Avalanche operation is not an unwanted side-effect but a desired feature, especially in power diodes, since it allows them to withstand surge events.As already mentioned for AlN in Section 9.2.2.4, in general the breakdown of (Al)GaN-on-Si is not ascribed to avalanche, but to the presence of large densities of defects: vertical GaN-on-GaN devices (having significantly lower dislocation densities compared to GaN-on-Si) can withstand higher electric fields, and reach the avalanche regime.

        <p>However, one needs to consider that if the structure is not optimized, operation in avalanche mode may be detrimental for the reliability of the devices, due to the high electric field and to the presence of a large number of highly-energetic carriers. The former can cause failure due to nonoptimal termination and electric field peak at the bevel surface, [625] whereas the latter can create significant lattice damage. [626] The actual defect species responding during avalanche operation is not yet clear, but a possible hypothesis is that carbon in nitrogen substitutional position (CN) may be involved. These defects create a wide range of effects, including an increase in series resistance and leakage current, a variation in the turn-on voltage, an increase in avalanche breakdown voltage (avalanche walkout [627]) and a worsening of the dynamic performance.

        <p>In real operating conditions, a power switch is not limited only to ON-state and OFF-state bias points. During the turn-ON and turn-OFF transitions, the presence of the internal and parasitic capacitances prevents an instantaneous variation of the voltage at the terminals of the device, therefore a relatively high voltage at the drain can still be present when the gate voltage is already close to the threshold value. This bias condition is called SEMI-ON-state, because the conductive channel is partially formed. Depending on the residual drain voltage during the transition, in SEMI-ON-state state a relatively large amount of electrons in the channel can be accelerated by a large electric field, causing the flow of highly-energetic (hot) carriers in the device that can be detrimental for its reliability.In real operating conditions, a power switch is not limited only to ON-state and OFF-state bias points.

        <p>The main effects a SEMI-ON-state stress can cause on a transistor include a worsening of the isolation properties of the gate diode, threshold voltage shifts, increase in ON-resistance, decrease in transconductance peak value, change in peak electric field, knee walkout and increase in drainlag transient amplitude [628], [629]. These changes may be ascribed to the increase in defect concentration close to the channel region, shown in Figure 94, caused by the energy exchange between the hot electrons and the crystal lattice, as can be detected by several deep level characterization techniques applied during stress [629]. The specific microscopic configuration of the deep level causing the detected variations can change depending on the device growth conditions, structure and processing.

A promising approach was proposed in [633], [634], based on the use of switching setups capable of monitoring on-wafer the effects of semi-on stress. By tuning the capacitance at the drain node, it is possible to control the amount of energy/charge released during hard switching events, and to evaluate the effect of stress on the devices.

        <p>show the creation of dark spots, attributed to electromigration leading to current filamentation. The spots are always present on the grounded contact, suggesting that not only the high power dissipation but also the current flow or electric field direction plays a role in the degradation. In this case, no variation in material parameters, charge density or electron mobility is observed. In general, issues related to contacts can be solved by an improvement in device processing, leaving other parts as the causes of degradation and failure. The substrate is no exception, especially if semiconductors with worse breakdown fields, such as Si, are used in order to lower the cost and increase wafer size. This can easily be evaluated by testing lateral Schottky diodes, since additional structures can be tested to gain more information, as will be described in the following [638]. Schottky diodes tested in reverse conduction mode show no dependence of the failure voltage on diode length after a critical length, suggesting that the breakdown is not related to the lateral direction anymore. In order to investigate if the vertical electric field is causing the issue, specific buffer isolation structures can be fabricated, without and with Si substrate removal, composed of isolated ohmic contacts connected only through the substrate. The structures with Si substrate are found to fail at significantly lower voltage, confirming that the vertical electric field and the Si breakdown field define the ESD robustness.

        <p>In a state-of-the-art transistor, the list of the possible effects caused by an ESD/EOS event extends beyond contact and substrate damage, depending on device structure and test conditions [639].

In the case of shorter events (&lt; 10 ns), the heating of the device is not high enough to lead to metal melting and catastrophic failure.In a state-of-the-art transistor, the list of the possible effects caused by an ESD/EOS event extends beyond contact and substrate damage, depending on device structure and test conditions [639].

        <p>If the gate reliability is not the main goal of the analysis, it is possible to test devices without the gate metal [639]. If a mesa-type isolation is not present, the migration of the contact metal from drain to source, leading to a drain-source short, is a relevant process, especially at the corners of the contacts, where the electric field is the highest. The process is started by the melting of the metal at the high power dissipation condition, which is expected to happen at temperatures 1.5x to 4x lower than the GaN one. If a mesa isolation is present, the short-circuit instead forms along the channel, due to the presence of surface states that act as low-energy paths for the metal migration.If the gate reliability is not the main goal of the analysis, it is possible to test devices without the gate metal [639].

        <p>One of the main shortcomings with ESD/EOS testing on transistors is the fact that a single pulse is applied to the device under test, whereas it was demonstrated that GaN-based devices suffer from cumulative effects [639]. Another problem is that the protocol is usually based only on gatefloating and gate-grounded configurations. Unfortunately, in the real application the gate voltage will sweep the entire operating range, and there is no way to guarantee that the ESD event will happen only when the device is biased in one of the two tested configurations. For this reason, in a three-terminal device it is important to analyze the dependence of the robustness on the applied gate voltage [640].One of the main shortcomings with ESD/EOS testing on transistors is the fact that a single pulse is applied to the device under test, whereas it was demonstrated that GaN-based devices suffer from cumulative effects [639].

        <p>In some cases, the dynamic RON is found to be decreased rather than increased by the proton irradiation [645]: on irradiated devices an increase in off-state leakage is observed, indicating an increase in the unintentionally-doped GaN layer conductivity. This conductivity increase leads to an increased deionization rate, thus reducing the dynamic on-resistance. [645] The level of damage depends on the energy of the protons, and it is found to be higher for lower energy [646], [647]. This behavior may seem unexpected, but is related to the larger non-ionizing energy loss of the lower energy particles in the barrier and channel region, whereas higher energy protons cause damage deeper in the device structure.

        <p>2) Trapping effects that take place in the device portion under the gate directly influence VT, whereas those occurring in the gate-drain access region impact the drain access resistance and the transconductance peak. Table 8 lists the major trapping mechanisms that have been reported in the literature classified in terms of trap location and corresponding charging/discharging path and type of involved mobile carriers. The different trapping mechanisms resulting from this classification will be described in more detail in the following sections. Both bulk and interface dielectric traps affect the device performance through VT, by inducing instabilities on this crucial parameter [494].

        <p>Considering RF amplification, the most harmful trap-related effect is the so-called RF current collapse [358], [359] resulting in a reduction in the maximum drain current and simultaneous increase in the minimum drain-source voltage explorable by the operating point during the RF sweep. The increase in the minimum drain-source voltage is also referred as knee-voltage walkout [358], [495]. The overall result is a compression in the RF output power and a degradation of the power added efficiency compared to the theoretical limits achievable by the given transistor that can be calculated from the DC output characteristics.Considering RF amplification, the most harmful trap-related effect is the so-called RF current collapse [358], [359] resulting in a reduction in the maximum drain current and simultaneous increase in the minimum drain-source voltage explorable by the operating point during the RF sweep.

        <p>highlighting an oxygen-rich composition and the presence of gallium. The quantitative analysis is compatible with the formation of Ga2O3 and Al2O3. After metal removal, the presence of large pits below each oxide particle is clearly visible (Figure 91 (e)). By changing the polarity of the stress bias on the gate-source and gate-drain diodes, it is possible to demonstrate that the oxide forms where the electric field is the highest. By testing devices in vacuum it was possible to demonstrate that the oxide only forms when oxygen is present in the atmosphere, and it is supposed that oxygen diffuses through the passivation layer and locally oxidizes the AlGaN/GaN layers.highlighting an oxygen-rich composition and the presence of gallium.
