        <p>Most mode-locking techniques introduced in the past 1,2 focused mainly on increasing the spectral bandwidth to achieve ultra-short, sub-picosecond-long coherent light pulses. By contrast, little importance seemed to be given to mode-locked lasers generating Fouriertransform-limited nanosecond pulses, which feature the narrow spectral bandwidths required for applications in spectroscopy 3 , efficient excitation of molecules 4 , sensing, and quantum optics 5 . Here we demonstrate a passively mode-locked laser system that relies on simultaneous nested-cavity filtering and cavity-enhanced nonlinear interactions within an integrated microring resonator. This allows us to produce transform-limited optical pulses in the nanosecond regime (4.3 nanoseconds in duration), with an overall spectral bandwidth of 104.9 MHzmore than two orders of magnitude smaller than previous realizations. The very narrow bandwidth of our laser makes it possible to fully characterize its spectral properties in the radiofrequency-domain using widely available GHz-bandwidth optoelectronic components. In turn, this characterization reveals the strong coherence of the generated pulse train.Most mode-locking techniques introduced in the past 1,2 focused mainly on increasing the spectral bandwidth to achieve ultra-short, sub-picosecond-long coherent light pulses.

        <p>Over the last few decades, a plethora of methods 1,2,[6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] have been developed to realize numerous pulsed laser systems with performances specifically tailored to the needs of various applications. These devices range from Q-switched lasers 6,7 allowing high pulse intensities at low repetition rates with high noise figures (sufficient for, e.g., materials processing) 8 , to passively mode-locked laser systems 1,[9][10][11] enabling the generation of highly stable frequency combs for radio-frequency (RF) synthesis 12 and metrology 16 , as well as intense ultra-short attosecond pulses for the study of strong-intensity light-matter interactions such as higher-order nonlinear effects in gases and plasmas 17 . Simultaneously, many advances have been made to realize smaller, energy efficient and less complex laser systems 18 enabled by a fibre-based technology, now increasingly replacing the previous bulky solid-state pulsed sources. These advances have relied on developing innovative mode-locking techniques and devices, such as semiconductor saturable absorber mirrors 13,14,19 , nonlinear-polarization rotation 10 or nonlinear amplifying loop mirrors (NALM) 15,20,21 . While many schemes for generating a stable coherent train of "ultra-short" laser pulses are nowadays available, they provide only limited success in generating stable nanosecond (ns) pulses. By using volatile Q-switched operation in dye-22 and fibre-based lasers 23 or external electro-optic modulation of single-frequency fibre 23 and diode lasers 24,25 , nearly transformlimited ns pulses have been achieved with flexible pulse durations and repetition rates. However, such schemes are usually associated with significant experimental complexity and cost, and more importantly, typically produce outputs with high noise figures (timing-jitter, etc.) or no pulse-topulse coherence. Trying to take advantage of the typically superior noise characteristics of passive mode-locking techniques, graphene-based saturable absorbers have been used for passive mode-locking 2 of ns pulses. Yet, these systems produce strongly frequency-modulated (i.e. chirped) pulses with the narrowest bandwidths achieved to date in the 10's of GHz range 14,26,27 .Over the last few decades, a plethora of methods 1,2,[6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] have been developed to realize numerous pulsed laser systems with performances specifically tailored to the needs of various applications.

        <p>The limitations encountered in the stable generation of transform-limited ns-long laser pulses through passive mode-locking are mainly caused by the adverse operation timescales of saturable absorbers, as well as by the low strength of the nonlinear effects typically reachable through nspulses with manageable energies. Making use of optical high quality nonlinear micro cavities whose special optical characteristics enabled, e.g., the realization of stabilized Kerr frequency combs 28 , we overcome these limitations and demonstrate a novel, passively mode-locked laser that allows for the direct generation of transform-limited nanosecond optical pulses, which is also compact and operates with low power-consumption.The limitations encountered in the stable generation of transform-limited ns-long laser pulses through passive mode-locking are mainly caused by the adverse operation timescales of saturable absorbers, as well as by the low strength of the nonlinear effects typically reachable through nspulses with manageable energies.

        <p>We exploited a polarization-maintaining figure-eight NALM laser architecture 15,20 as shown in Figure 1, consisting of a NALM section and an amplification stage. In the NALM section, clockwise propagating light is first amplified (via a semiconductor optical amplifier, SOA) before entering the nonlinear element (in our case an integrated microring resonatorsee Methods), while the counter-clockwise propagating light passes through the nonlinear element before being amplified. The intensity-dependent nonlinear phase shift difference between the two inputs of the 50:50 beam splitter (50:50 splitter in Figure 1) enables the light splitting ratio to be controlled by the intensity. Such a NALM mimics the behaviour of a saturable absorber and has therefore been widely used for passive mode-locking 2,19 . To provide the required gain for laser operation, we introduced an amplification stage including an Erbium-doped fibre amplifier (EDFA) along with an isolator and a 90:10 output coupler.We exploited a polarization-maintaining figure-eight NALM laser architecture 15,20 as shown in Figure 1, consisting of a NALM section and an amplification stage.

        <p>In the past, a large variety of non-resonant nonlinear elements have been used within the NALM section in order to obtain the required nonlinear phase-shift for mode-locking operation. The novelty of our method relies on the implementation of a resonant nonlinear medium that acts as an ultra-narrowband spectral filter, while providing large field enhancement. This configuration enables, in turn, sufficient nonlinear phase-shifts for low-power narrow-bandwidth passive mode-locking. Specifically, we used a high-Q microring resonator fabricated in a CMOS-compatible high refractive index silica-based glass 29 with a measured Q-factor of 1.3 × 10 6 , a free spectral range (FSR) of 200 GHz and an associated resonance bandwidth of around 150 MHz.

        <p>In contrast to previous reports of mode-locked nanosecond pulsed lasers that were featured by hundred-GHz-wide spectra 14,26,27 , the bandwidth of our laser system is in the hundred-MHz range, and thus not accurately resolvable with the resolution and stability of common optical spectrum analysers, nor measurable with standard pulse characterization techniques (e.g. frequency-resolved auto/cross-correlation or spectral-shear interferometry techniques). At the same time, the spectral width of the laser is compatible with the bandwidth of widely-available photo-detectors and signal-processing electronics (i.e. ~GHz range or less). In this case, the coherent beating between the mode-locked laser field and a stable continuous wave (CW) laser field allows us to map the entire optical spectrum into the RF domain. The RF spectrum (in Figure 3a) reveals two prominent parts whose envelope is associated with i) the intensity Fourier transform (FT) of the pulse (lower frequency partgreen shading) and ii) the so-called beat note (higher frequency partred shading), which relates to the electric field spectrum of the pulse (see Methods). The beat note, centred around 1600 MHz, allows us to resolve not only the spectral shape but also the comb-like structure of the mode-locked laser associated with its repetition rate (i.e. each oscillating laser mode corresponds to a different beat frequency). The ultra-narrow bandwidth of our laser also permits the retrieval of additional information concerning the mode-locking properties of the system, such as the coherence of the spectral modes. In particular, the intensity FT, related to the lower-frequency part, describes the intermodal beating of each comb mode with the others, once the comb-like frequency distribution is taken into account (see Methods). For previous (large bandwidth) mode-locked lasers, the entire shape of this convolution was not resolvable due to bandwidth limitations of the electronics and photodetector. However, in our case, the laser characteristics enable us to resolve the relative contributions of the spectral wings (i.e. frequencies that are outside the FWHM) to each RF tone (red crosses in Figure 3b see Methods). Considering the different contributions to the RF spectrum, we compared the beat note at 𝑓 𝑅 = 9.565MHz and at 26𝑓 𝑅see inset of Figure 3b.In contrast to previous reports of mode-locked nanosecond pulsed lasers that were featured by hundred-GHz-wide spectra 14,26,27 , the bandwidth of our laser system is in the hundred-MHz range, and thus not accurately resolvable with the resolution and stability of common optical spectrum analysers, nor measurable with standard pulse characterization techniques (e.g. frequency-resolved auto/cross-correlation or spectral-shear interferometry techniques).

        <p>For both cases, the convolution linewidths perfectly matched, allowing us to conclude that the mode linewidths remain equal over the whole comb (within the measurement uncertainties), thus demonstrating the coherent locking of all laser modes. Finally, our laser scheme is highly flexible in terms of central lasing frequency and bandwidth.For both cases, the convolution linewidths perfectly matched, allowing us to conclude that the mode linewidths remain equal over the whole comb (within the measurement uncertainties), thus demonstrating the coherent locking of all laser modes.

        <p>In conclusion, the combination of very narrow spectral bandwidth and resulting high spectral density, along with low power operation and large tunability of the emitted frequency, make this laser very versatile and useful for a large number of applications. The compact architecture, and modest requirements in terms of power, readily allow for stable and portable operation, while opening up a route towards the full integration of the laser system. Together with the possibility to resolve the full laser spectrum in the RF domain, such characteristics will pave the way towards novel sensing and spectroscopy implementations. From a fundamental perspective, the low and tractable number of modes (11 within the spectral FWHM), may enable further studies of both nonlinear mode coupling and complex mode-locking regimes.In conclusion, the combination of very narrow spectral bandwidth and resulting high spectral density, along with low power operation and large tunability of the emitted frequency, make this laser very versatile and useful for a large number of applications.

        <p>RF analysis: Beat note -In Figure 3c, we compare the spectral shape measured from the beat note (red crosses) with the ideal Fourier-limited spectrum (dash-dotted purple line) calculated from the fitted temporal pulse profile (see Figure 2b), i.e. 𝐸 ̃𝑃 𝐴 = ℱ[𝐸 𝑃 𝐴 (𝑡)]. It can be observed that the high intensity central part of the Fourier-limited spectrum agrees well with the measured values, however, discrepancies appear on the spectral wings, which are slightly broader for the measured spectrum than for the ideal Fourier-limited case. Although a dispersive pulse broadening effect could be responsible for these discrepancies (i.e. not transform-limited pulse), we estimated that for such a ~100 MHz-bandwidth, the contribution originating from the laser elements is of the order of 10 -6 per meter, and is thus negligible. A more plausible explanation arises from a temporal phase modulation generated through the nonlinear Kerr effect acting within the microring resonator. The blue solid line in Figure 3c shows the calculated spectral profile of the pulse assuming an intensity-dependent phase shift induced by the Kerr effect 31 , i.e. Intensity FT -The lower frequency part of the RF beating spectrum (green crosses, see Figure 3b) can be related to the convolution of the pulse electric field spectrum with its inverse complex conjugate 𝐸 ̃𝑃 𝐴 (𝜈) * 𝐸 ̃𝑃 𝐴 * (-𝜈). Taking into account the comb nature of the mode-locked laser, this convolution can be interpreted as the beating of all laser modes with each other (i.e. the first RF tone is the sum of the beat intensities from next neighbouring frequency components, the second RF tone is the sum of beat intensities from second-next neighbouring frequency components, etc.). This implies that higher frequency RF tones have higher contributions from the spectral wings. By numerically calculating this convolution for a comb spectrum that only includes frequencies outside the FWHM (i.e. only counting the modes in the spectral wings) and comparing it with the result for a complete spectrum (i.e. including all frequency modes), we could retrieve the relative contribution of the spectral wings to each RF tone (red crosses in Figure 3b).RF analysis: Beat note -In Figure 3c, we compare the spectral shape measured from the beat note (red crosses) with the ideal Fourier-limited spectrum (dash-dotted purple line) calculated from the fitted temporal pulse profile (see Figure 2b), i.e. 𝐸 ̃𝑃 𝐴 = ℱ[𝐸 𝑃 𝐴 (𝑡)]. It can be observed that the high intensity central part of the Fourier-limited spectrum agrees well with the measured values, however, discrepancies appear on the spectral wings, which are slightly broader for the measured spectrum than for the ideal Fourier-limited case.
