        <p>We present benchmark scenarios for searches for an additional Higgs state in the real Higgs singlet extension of the Standard Model in Run 2 of the LHC. The scenarios are selected such that they fulfill all relevant current theoretical and experimental constraints, but can potentially be discovered at the current LHC run. We take into account the results presented in earlier work and update the experimental constraints from relevant LHC Higgs searches and signal rate measurements. The benchmark scenarios are given separately for the low-mass and high-mass region, i.e. the mass range where the additional Higgs state is lighter or heavier than the discovered Higgs state at around 125 GeV. They have also been presented in the framework of the LHC Higgs Cross Section Working Group.We present benchmark scenarios for searches for an additional Higgs state in the real Higgs singlet extension of the Standard Model in Run 2 of the LHC.

        <p>The first run of the LHC at center-of-mass (CM) energies of 7 and 8 TeV has been completed in 2015. Its remarkable success is highlighted by the breakthrough discovery of a scalar boson in July 2012 and the measurements of its coupling properties, which thus far are well compatible with the interpretation in terms of the Higgs boson of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs mechanism [1][2][3][4][5]. The combination of the Higgs mass measurements performed by ATLAS and CMS yields [6] m H = 125.09 ± 0.21 (stat.) ± 0.11 (syst.)

        <p>If the discovered particle is indeed the Higgs boson of the SM, its mass measurement determines the last unknown ingredient of this model, as all other properties of the electroweak sector then follow directly from theory. In the coming years a thorough investigation of the Higgs boson's properties is a e-mail: Tania.Robens@tu-dresden.de b e-mail: tistefan@ucsc.edu needed in order to identify whether the SM Higgs sector is indeed complete, or instead, the structure of a more involved Higgs sector is realized. This includes detailed and accurate measurements of its coupling strengths and CP structure at the LHC and ultimately at future experimental facilities for Higgs boson precision studies. Complementary to this, collider searches for additional Higgs bosons need to be continued over the full accessible mass range. The discovery of another Higgs boson would inevitably prove the existence of a non-minimal Higgs sector.If the discovered particle is indeed the Higgs boson of the SM, its mass measurement determines the last unknown ingredient of this model, as all other properties of the electroweak sector then follow directly from theory.

        <p>In this work we consider the simplest extension of the SM Higgs sector, where an additional real scalar field is added, which is neutral under all quantum numbers of the SM gauge groups [7,8] and acquires a vacuum expectation value (VEV). This model has been widely studied in the literature , also in the context of electroweak higher order corrections [53,54] or offshell and interference effects [33,34,[55][56][57][58][59]. Here, we present an update of the exploration of the model parameter space presented in Ref. [38], where we take the latest experimental constraints into account. As before, we consider masses of the second (non-standard) Higgs boson in the whole mass range up to 1 TeV. This minimal setup can be interpreted as a limiting case for more generic BSM scenarios, e.g. models with additional gauge sectors [60] or additional matter content [61,62].

        <p>straints have been taken into account. The production cross sections rapidly decrease with higher masses m H due to both the stronger constraints on the mixing angle (cf. Fig. 1) and a reduction of the available phase space for higher masses. The cross section for direct production in gluon fusion and successive decay into SM final states ranges from about 10 pb at lower masses to about 10 fb for masses around 800 GeV. Note that in order to obtain the predictions for a particular SM decay mode, H → X X, these numbers need to be multiplied by a factor of BR(H → X X)/BR(H → SM), where BR(H → SM) is the sum over all branching ratios of Higgs decays into SM particles according to Eq. ( 13). Taking into account the current design strategy for the LHC run (cf. e.g. Ref.

For the hh final state, on the other hand, cross sections are about an order of magnitude lower. A comparison of current exclusion limits from LHC H → hh searches with the predictions in the viable parameter space will be given in Sect. 4.straints have been taken into account. The production cross sections rapidly decrease with higher masses m H due to both the stronger constraints on the mixing angle (cf. Fig. 1) and a reduction of the available phase space for higher masses. The cross section for direct production in gluon fusion and successive decay into SM final states ranges from about 10 pb at lower masses to about 10 fb for masses around 800 GeV. Note that in order to obtain the predictions for a particular SM decay mode, H → X X, these numbers need to be multiplied by a factor of BR(H → X X)/BR(H → SM), where BR(H → SM) is the sum over all branching ratios of Higgs decays into SM particles according to Eq. ( 13). Taking into account the current design strategy for the LHC run (cf. e.g. Ref. [97]) and expecting an integrated luminosity of about 100 and 300 fb -1 before the shutdowns in 2019 and 2023, respectively, this translates into the fact that at least O 10 3 heavy Higgs bosons could be produced in that mass range in optimistic scenarios.

        <p>Note that these plots were obtained using a simple rescaling of production cross section of a SM Higgs boson of the same mass as given in Ref. [23], i.e. contributions due to interference with the additional scalar are not included. Tools which can handle these have been presented e.g. in Refs. [55,56,58,59]. These studies, however, focus on effects on the line-shape of the heavy scalar boson after a possible discovery. Moreover, thus far, their calculations neglect additional higher order corrections, whereas these have been calculated to great precision for the SM Higgs boson and are included in Fig. 3 [23]. For the future, it would be desirable to perform a dedicated study of interference effects including higher order corrections for the benchmark points presented in this work in order to estimate their effects (and the systematic uncertainty introduced here by neglecting them).Note that these plots were obtained using a simple rescaling of production cross section of a SM Higgs boson of the same mass as given in Ref.

        <p>The intermediate mass region, where both Higgs bosons have masses between 120 and 130 GeV, was originally discussed in Ref. [38]. In this mass region the observed Higgs signal at 125 GeV may be due to a signal overlap of both Higgs bosons, depending on the mass separation and the mass resolution of the experimental analysis. We show the allowed parameter space in the (m h , m H ) and (m h , sin α) plane from the updated fit in Fig. 4. The updated signal strength observables in HiggsSignals-1.4.0 yield only marginal improvements in the constrained parameter space, while the updated limits from direct Higgs searches are irrelevant in this mass region.The intermediate mass region, where both Higgs bosons have masses between 120 and 130 GeV, was originally discussed in Ref.

        <p>We quantify the benchmark scenarios for both signal channels in this regime by considering the maximally allowed mixing angle together with the maximal and minimal branching ratio for the decay H → hh, respectively. While these maximal and minimal points define benchmark points, all BR(H → hh) values in between are in principle allowed. Therefore, an interpolation between the minimal and maximal values defines a higher-dimensional benchmark scenario (benchmark slope or plane), where the additional third parameter (cf. Eqs.

        <p>We furthermore distinguish scenarios for which the H → hh on-shell decay mode is kinematically allowed or forbidden. As we neglect all other triple and quartic Higgs selfcouplings apart from μ , and work in the on-shell approximation, tan β only influences the collider phenomenology for regions in parameter space where the decay H → hh is kinematically allowed, i.e. for heavy Higgs masses m H ≥ 2m h ≈ 250 GeV. For lower masses tan β is irrelevant for the phenomenology considered here. However, to be consistent, we recommend to still keep the values within the respective parameter regions allowed by perturbativity and perturbative unitarity.We furthermore distinguish scenarios for which the H → hh on-shell decay mode is kinematically allowed or forbidden.

As long as the decay H → hh is kinematically accessible, the maximal value of its branching ratio, BR(H → hh) 0.259, is not dependent on the light Higgs mass. The lighter Higgs bosons then decay further according to the branching ratios of a SM Higgs of the respective mass.

We present benchmark points for fixed masses in Table 9.

We found that these modify our previous findings in the mass range 130 GeV ≤ m H ≤ 250 GeV, where now the direct Higgs searches as well as the ATLAS and CMS signal strength combination render the strongest constraints on the parameter space.In this paper we have revisited and updated the constraints on the parameter space of the real scalar singlet extension of the SM.
