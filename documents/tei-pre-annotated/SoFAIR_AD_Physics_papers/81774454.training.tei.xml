        <p>We attempt to explain recent anomalies in semileptonic B decays at LHCb via a composite Higgs model, in which both the Higgs and an SU(2) L -triplet leptoquark arise as pseudo-Goldstone bosons of the strong dynamics. Fermion masses are assumed to be generated via the mechanism of partial compositeness, which largely determines the leptoquark couplings and implies non-universal lepton interactions. The latter are needed to accommodate tensions in the b → sµµ dataset and to be consistent with a discrepancy measured at LHCb in the ratio of B + → K + µ + µ -to B + → K + e + e -branching ratios. The data imply that the leptoquark should have a mass of around a TeV. We find that the model is not in conflict with current flavour or direct production bounds, but we identify a few observables for which the new physics contributions are close to current limits and where the leptoquark is likely to show up in future measurements. The leptoquark will be pair-produced at the LHC and decay predominantly to third-generation quarks and leptons, and LHC13 searches will provide further strong bounds.We attempt to explain recent anomalies in semileptonic B decays at LHCb via a composite Higgs model, in which both the Higgs and an SU(2) L -triplet leptoquark arise as pseudo-Goldstone bosons of the strong dynamics.

        <p>The first run of the LHC brought us the long-awaited discovery of the Higgs boson, but no firm evidence for the physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) needed to avoid finetuning of the weak scale. This was perhaps not unexpected, given the plethora of indirect constraints on new physics coming from, e.g., flavour physics and electroweak precision tests. Typically these point at scales of new physics way beyond a TeV; even when we invoke all the dynamical dirty tricks that we know of, the best we can do is to lower the possible scale of new physics to perhaps a few TeV. Therefore, there seems to be, nolens volens, at least a small tuning in the weak scale.The first run of the LHC brought us the long-awaited discovery of the Higgs boson, but no firm evidence for the physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) needed to avoid finetuning of the weak scale.

        <p>In this work, we ask, in this vein, whether anomalies recently observed in semileptonic decays of B-mesons at LHCb [4][5][6] can be explained by a model in which a scale of a few TeV arises naturally via strong dynamics. The necessary residual fine tuning required to generate the electroweak scale can be achieved by making the Higgs boson a pseudo-Goldstone boson (PGB) of global symmetries of the strong dynamics sector [7][8][9][10]. The Higgs potential (and thus the electroweak scale) arises due to the breaking of the global symmetries by the SM gauging and by couplings to fermions, and one can hope that there is an accidental cancellation in the various contributions, whence a somewhat lower electroweak scale emerges. The Yukawa couplings of the SM are assumed to arise via the mechanism of partial compositeness [11], which not only provides a rationale for the structure of masses and mixings observed in the quark sector, but also provides a paradigm for suppressing large flavour-violating effects in processes involving the light fermions, where the experimental constraints are strongest.In this work, we ask, in this vein, whether anomalies recently observed in semileptonic decays of B-mesons at LHCb [4][5][6] can be explained by a model in which a scale of a few TeV arises naturally via strong dynamics.

        <p>The general framework of partial compositeness is an obvious choice for explaining the anomalies, which appear in processes involving second and third generation quarks, and which appear to require new physics in muonic, but not electronic processes. To fit the detailed structure of the anomalies, we hypothesize that they are due to the presence in such a model of an anomalously light (c. TeV, as it turns out) leptoquark. As pointed out in [12],2 partial compositeness models necessarily feature a plethora of composite coloured fermion states, namely the composite quarks, and so it would be something of a surprise if they did not also feature composite coloured scalar states, which could couple as leptoquarks or diquarks [13]. Moreover, one can easily arrange for a leptoquark state to be rather lighter than the other resonances of the strong sector, by making it a PGB of the same symmetry breaking that gives rise to the Higgs boson. 3A disadvantage of such models is that, being strongly coupled, we cannot calculate ad libitum. But we can use naïve dimensional analysis (NDA) to compute and make predictions modulo O(1) corrections. Using this framework, we find that the anomalies single out one among the possible SM irreps that allow leptoquark couplings, viz. a triplet under both SU(3) c and SU(2) L . This leptoquark is one of those identified in a recent analysis [14] of LHCb B meson anomalies, in which just two, non-vanishing leptoquark couplings (to b quarks, s quarks and muons) were invoked in an ad hoc fashion to fit the anomalies. In contrast, the model considered here is underpinned by a complete (albeit presently uncalculable) framework for flavour physics, and all leptoquark couplings are non-vanishing, with magnitude fixed by the degrees of compositeness of each of the SM fermion multiplets, giving 15 mixing parameters. In the quark sector, all but one of these parameters is fixed by measurements of quark masses and the CKM matrix; there is more JHEP05(2015)006 ambiguity in the lepton sector, but we find that everything can be fixed by assuming that the mixings of the left and right-handed lepton multiplets are comparable. This assumption is a plausible one, from the point of view of the UV flavour dynamics, and has the additional benefit that new physics (NP) corrections to the most severely constrained flavour-violating observable, µ → eγ, are minimized. As a result, we are left with just 3 free parameters in the model: the mass, M , of the leptoquark, the coupling strength, g ρ , of the strong sector resonances, and the degree of compositeness, ǫ q 3 , of the third generation quark doublet. Furthermore, all processes to which the leptoquark contributes (with the exception of meson mixing) result in constraints on the single combination x ≡ √ g ρ ǫ q 3 /M . Thus the model is extremely predictive. We find that the preferred range of x corresponds to plausible values of the 3 underlying parameters of the strongly coupled theory (in which the weak scale is slightly tuned), namely g ρ ∼ 4π, M ∼ TeV, and ǫ q 3 ∼ 1. Thus, g ρ and ǫ q 3 lie close to their maximal values, meaning that one cannot evade future direct searches at the LHC by scaling up M and g ρ .The general framework of partial compositeness is an obvious choice for explaining the anomalies, which appear in processes involving second and third generation quarks, and which appear to require new physics in muonic, but not electronic processes.

The observable R K has the advantage of being theoretically wellunderstood, predicted to be almost exactly 1 in the SM [34] (specifically, 1.0003 ± 0.0001 when mass effects are taken into account [35]). A discrepancy in R K cannot be explained by lepton-flavour-universal NP, nor by any of the sources of theoretical uncertainty that might underlie the B → K * µ + µ -anomalies. Analyses and fits including the R K data and other recent measurements were performed in [14,22,36,37]. Due to the lepton non-universality required by the R K data, these analyses allowed the electronic and muonic Wilson coefficients to differ. They found that a negative contribution to C µ 9 remains favoured, while contributions to electronic Wilson coefficients C e i were found to be consistent with zero, but could have large deviations therefrom, due to larger experimental uncertainties in electronic measurements.where q 2 is the invariant mass of the di-lepton pair and the integral is performed over the interval q 2 ∈ [1, 6] GeV 2 .

        <p>Given this, the recent analyses have also made use of this basis [14,22,36,37] .

Therefore, of the possible scalar leptoquarks, 4 which always generate contributions to one Wilson coefficient in the chiral basis, the obvious choice to explain the anomalies appears to be that with quantum numbers (3, 3, 1/3), which contributes to the combination C µ 9 = -C µ 10 at tree level. 5 This leptoquark was already considered to explain R K in [14], in a scenario in which its only non-zero couplings were to bµ and to sµ. 63 Details of the composite modelGiven this, the recent analyses have also made use of this basis [14,22,36,37] .

The strong sector is characterised by a mass scale m ρ and by a single coupling among the resonances, which is denoted by g ρ . We expect the strong sector in isolation to have a global symmetry G which is spontaneously broken by the strong dynamics to a subgroup H. The SM gauge interactions are introduced in the strong sector by gauging a subgroup of H. We identify the Goldstone bosons coming from the breaking G/H with the Higgs boson H and the leptoquark state Π. So as to avoid large contributions to other flavour observables, we seek a model in which the coset space contains only H and Π.With the required quantum numbers of the leptoquark in hand, we now embed the leptoquark in a composite Higgs model. 7 We assume, then, the presence of a new strong sector and of an elementary sector.

We need, therefore, to explore the alternative option, which is to look for a symmetry that lies (at least partly) within SO (9), such that the leptoquark is charged. A simple expedient is to use the Z 2 ⊂ SO(9) symmetry whose non-trivial element in the defining representation of SO( 9) is the matrix -I 6 0 0 I 3 , where I n is the n×n identity matrix. This element commutes with SO(6)×SO(3) (and therefore is unbroken by the gauging of the SM subgroup) but anti-commutes with the broken generators in SO(9)/SO(6)×SO(3), meaning that the leptoquarks transform under Z 2 as Π → -Π. Now, by insisting that the Z 2 be unbroken by the strong dynamics and the couplings to elementary fermions, the diquark coupling Πqq is forbidden. Provided, moreover, that the elementary q and ℓ are assigned opposite charges, the leptoquark coupling Πℓq is allowed. Yukawa couplings can be retained by assigning the elementary (u c , d c ) and e c to have the same charges as q and ℓ, respectively. Such a symmetry (which may be thought of as either a baryon or lepton parity) stabilizes nucleons completely, and so also solves potential problems from generic operators generated by the heavier resonances of the strong dynamics. Its drawback is that it cannot forbid neutron-antineutron oscillations, 11 for which there are again strong experimental constraints. There are two dimension 9 operators in the EFT that could give a contribution to this process, namely qqqq(d c d c ) † and u c d c d c u c d c d c .

        <p>The leptoquark we consider will mediate lepton flavour violating processes. However we find that all current bounds are well above rates predicted for the leptoquark contribution. Lepton flavour violation in the context of B decays was recently discussed in detail in [51]. There, the authors consider a model in which, similarly to our case, the NP contributions to b → sℓℓ decays arise in a V -A structure (ie. C ℓ 9 = -C ℓ 10 ) and the largest effects are in the third generation of quarks and leptons. Interestingly, a special case of our model can be made to fit into their framework, if we take all the O(1) coefficients c ij to be equal (and for simplicity, equal to 1). Then the coupling denoted G in [51] is given by G = (g ρ /M 2 ) (ǫ q 3 ) 2 mτ v , and the mixing matrices U ℓ L3i and U d L3i therein are given by U d L3 = (λ 3 , λ 2 , 1) and U ℓ L3i = m i /m τ . With these choices, we find that all bounds quoted in [51] are comfortably satisfied by the composite leptoquark model.

        <p>There will be electroweak mass splittings between the three leptoquark states, allowing the heavier ones to decay to the lighter ones, but these decays will be subdominant to those through the leptoquark couplings, if the mass splittings are small. Of the LHC leptoquark searches, dedicated searches for third generation leptoquarks will put the strongest limits on our leptoquarks [65]. The Π -2/3 leptoquark will decay to tops and missing energy, so stop searches, which look for the same signature, will apply. Likewise sbottom searches will apply to Π 1/3 . A recent CMS search [66] ruled out leptoquarks decaying wholly to τ and b up to a mass of 740 GeV. This bound roughly applies to the leptoquark Π 4/3 . This leptoquark's branching ratio to τ and b is 0.94 (over the mass range of the search, the variation is only in higher decimal places), so the bound on it from [66] is roughly 720 GeV. Another CMS search [67] puts bounds on leptoquarks decaying to either top and tau or bottom and neutrino with a combined branching ratio of 100%. Since the Π 1/3 state has a combined branching ratio of 97% to these final states, to a good approximation the results of this search should apply. This search implies a bound of 570 GeV on the mass of the Π 1/3 , which at this mass has a branching ratio of 0.40 to top and tau. A bound from an ATLAS stop search [68] can be applied to the remaining leptoquark state, Π -2/3 . In one scenario considered in the search, the stop is presumed to decay wholly to a top and the lightest neutralino, and a 640 GeV bound on the mass of the stop is quoted, assuming that the neutralino is massless. The production mechanism for the Π -2/3 leptoquark is identical to that for the stop, which is assumed in the search to be directly pair produced. Furthermore at a mass of 640 GeV, the branching ratio of Π -2/3 to top and neutrino is greater than 99.5%. We can hence take the 640 GeV bound to apply directly to the mass of the leptoquark Π -2/3 . Since we are assuming small mass splittings between the charge eigenstates in the leptoquark multiplet, a bound on the mass of one eigenstate roughly JHEP05(2015)006 corresponds to a bound on them all. So we can apply the strongest of the bounds given above to the mass M ; we therefore conclude that M &gt; 720 GeV.There will be electroweak mass splittings between the three leptoquark states, allowing the heavier ones to decay to the lighter ones, but these decays will be subdominant to those through the leptoquark couplings, if the mass splittings are small.

        <p>We have argued that current anomalies in semileptonic B decays seen at LHCb are consistent with a composite Higgs model featuring an additional, light leptoquark. This leptoquark has quantum numbers ( 3, 3, 1/3) under the SM gauge group and couplings to the SM fermions that are largely fixed by the partial compositeness paradigm. We have identified a possible coset structure that contains both the SM Higgs and the leptoquark as pseudo-Goldstone bosons of the strong sector, which allows them to be rather lighter than the resonances of the strong sector, and with a natural explanation of the sizes and signs of their squared-mass parameters (bar a small, unavoidable, residual fine-tuning in the electroweak scale). The partial compositeness framework automatically implies lepton non-universality in the leptoquark coupings. In this way, the departure from unity of the value of the ratio of the branching ratio of B → Kµ + µ -to that of B → Ke + e -measured at LHCb this year can be accommodated, as can earlier anomalies in measurements of angular observables in B → K * µ + µ -decays. The framework predicts large couplings to third-generation leptons, hence large deviations in observables involving tau leptons or neutrinos in the final state. These processes therefore provide a good check for the model, but the predictions are not in conflict with current bounds. In our scenario, with parameters chosen to fit the LHCb b → sℓℓ anomalies, we predict deviations of ∼ 25% from the SM value in B(B → Kνν), which will be testable at the Belle II experiment. And the NA62 experiment, starting in 2015, will measure B(K + → π + νν) to sufficient accuracy that the effects of the model should be visible there.We have argued that current anomalies in semileptonic B decays seen at LHCb are consistent with a composite Higgs model featuring an additional, light leptoquark.

        <p>We find that the model is consistent with all other flavour constraints, however we have identified a few processes for which the NP contributions are at or close to the current bounds. These are B(µ → eγ), the mass splitting ∆m Bs in B s meson mixing, and B(B + → π + µ + µ -). More precise measurements of these will also test the model. It should be remembered, however, that the leptoquark couplings, λ ij , within partial compositeness are each only predicted up to an O(1) factor, c ij . Thus predictions can only be made to an accuracy of order one or so, and even tight constraints could be evaded if, for a particular process, the combination of c ij factors involved is accidentally small. It should be noted JHEP05(2015)006 that, in particular, none of the processes listed in this paragraph get their dominant contributions from the same combination of couplings that are involved in the LHCb B decay anomalies. Thus, the various O(1) factors are not determined by fitting the anomalies. However, the fact that the framework can make predictions for a wide range of processes, due to non-zero couplings to all SM fermions, means that it is, nevertheless, falsifiable.We find that the model is consistent with all other flavour constraints, however we have identified a few processes for which the NP contributions are at or close to the current bounds.

        <p>If the composite leptoquark is the cause of the measured discrepancies in B decays, there are three implications for the model. Firstly, the composite sector must be strongly interacting, g ρ ∼ 4π. Secondly, the left handed doublet of the third quark generation must be highly composite ǫ q 3 ∼ 1. Thirdly, the leptoquark should have a mass of around a TeV, meaning that there is scope for its discovery at LHC13. Current LHC8 bounds, analysed in section 4.3, exclude the leptoquark up to masses of M &gt; 720 GeV (under an assumption on the coefficients involved in the couplings). Large third generation couplings ensure that the three charge eigenstates of the leptoquark triplet decay mostly to third generation quarks and leptons, so searches for third generation leptoquarks are effective for constraining their mass.If the composite leptoquark is the cause of the measured discrepancies in B decays, there are three implications for the model.

        <p>We finally comment on the physics associated with the strong sector at the scale m ρ . First of all let us estimate the value of that scale. According to the discussion in section 3 we expect that M 2 ∼ αs 4π m 2 ρ . Given that we need M ∼ 1 TeV to explain the LHCb anomalies, we obtain m ρ ∼ 10 TeV. With such a scale for the composite sector it has been shown [69] that the structure of partial compositeness is enough to suppress dangerous contributions to indirect search observables with the exception of the electron EDM and the radiative LFV decay µ → eγ. 14 The further suppression required in these channels might be obtained by departing from the hypothesis of lepton flavour anarchy in the strong sector. 15 Very roughly, the amount of tuning needed to accommodate the right values of the EW scale and of the Higgs mass [77][78][79][80][81] is expected to be, at best, at or below the per cent level, which is not much worse than the amount already required in generic supersymmetric extensions of the SM, given current bounds. We feel that this is a not unreasonable price to pay, given the additional benefits of a motivated flavour paradigm and the power to explain the LHCb anomalies.We finally comment on the physics associated with the strong sector at the scale m ρ .

        <p>Such light states might be present for a variety of reasons. For example, they might be desirable because they reduce fine-tuning (such as a light top squark and gluino in SUSY), or they might arise because of symmetries (such as additional pseudo-Goldstone boson states in composite Higgs models[1][2][3]).Such light states might be present for a variety of reasons.

        <p>The leptoquark is nevertheless expected to be somewhat heavier than the Higgs[12], both because it receives contributions to its potential from the QCD coupling and because we expect that the Higgs mass has been slightly tuned.The leptoquark is nevertheless expected to be somewhat heavier than the Higgs[12], both because it receives contributions to its potential from the QCD coupling and because we expect that the Higgs mass has been slightly tuned.</p>

        <p>Various non-anarchic flavour structures have been considered in the context of partial compositeness, see for example[42,[70][71][72][73][74][75][76]. In our framework a possible solution is to invoke an unbroken U(1)e symmetry protecting the electron family number. This will lead to vanishing leptoquark couplings with the electron field, but our phenomenological analysis is unaffected.Various non-anarchic flavour structures have been considered in the context of partial compositeness, see for example[42,[70][71][72][73][74][75][76].
