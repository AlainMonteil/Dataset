        <p>In this paper, we discuss how windows in Euclidean time can be used to isolate the origin of potential conflicts between evaluations of the hadronic-vacuum-polarization (HVP) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon in lattice QCD and from e + e -→ hadrons cross-section data. We provide phenomenological comparison numbers evaluated from e + e -→ hadrons data for the window quantities most commonly studied in lattice QCD, complete with the correlations among them. We discuss and evaluate modifications of window parameters that could be useful in dissecting the energy dependence of tensions in the HVP integral and emphasize that further optimizations require a precise knowledge of the full covariance matrix in lattice-QCD calculations as well.In this paper, we discuss how windows in Euclidean time can be used to isolate the origin of potential conflicts between evaluations of the hadronic-vacuum-polarization (HVP) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon in lattice QCD and from e + e -→ hadrons cross-section data.

        <p>In response to Ref. [36] it has been emphasized that connections between e + e -cross-section data, the HVP contribution, hadronic corrections to the running of the fine-structure constant α, the global electroweak fit, and related low-energy parameters such as the pion charge radius can help trace the origin of the tension to specific energy ranges [91][92][93][94]. Comparisons like this are particularly useful given that, e.g., the dispersion integral that determines the hadronic running involves a different energy weighting than a HVP μ [95]. More recently, a lattice-QCD evaluation of this running [96] suggested a similar tension with e + e -data as observed in Ref. [36], further motivating more detailed scrutiny of the comparison between lattice QCD and the data-driven approach.In response to Ref.

        <p>Another valuable tool for such comparisons is given by partial HVP integrals, the so-called window quantities, first suggested in Ref. [24] and further developed in Ref. [97]. These window quantities can be defined for fixed lattice spacing and have a welldefined continuum limit. In the continuum theory a similar idea had been discussed before in Ref. [98]. Adding a weight function to the HVP integral allows one to focus on certain regions in parameter space: either Euclidean time in the lattice approach or center-of-mass energy in phenomenology. In this paper, the possibilities regarding which window parameters are most useful for such comparisons are considered in detail and values for the same quantities are evaluated from e + e -data and provided. Given that several lattice collaborations (FNAL/HPQCD/MILC and RBC/UKQCD) have started to implement blind analyses, it is well motivated to compile such phenomenological reference points to allow one to draw more immediate conclusions once new lattice results become available.Another valuable tool for such comparisons is given by partial HVP integrals, the so-called window quantities, first suggested in Ref.

        <p>Table 1 also shows the decomposition for the two leading hadronic channels, indicating how their contributions are distributed over the three windows, as well as the extent to which the 2π channel dominates the long-distance window. As can be seen from Fig. 1, the sharp separation into short-distance, intermediate, and long-distance weight functions in Euclidean time becomes far more ambiguous in center-of-mass energy, with significant overlap of the windows and a long tail of the intermediate weight function. Accordingly, this window still receives the dominant contribution (∼ 60%) from the 2π channel (to be compared to 71% for the total HVP), but a significant part comes from highermultiplicity channels and the inclusive region above (1.8-2) GeV.Table 1 also shows the decomposition for the two leading hadronic channels, indicating how their contributions are distributed over the three windows, as well as the extent to which the 2π channel dominates the long-distance window.

To facilitate usage of our results (e.g., for the construction of linear combinations), the final correlations are provided in Table 3. The covariance matrix is derived starting from Ref.

        <p>To illustrate this, we show an example in Fig. 3 that is built to have a significant localization in √ s (another example, together with some details on how to build such linear combinations, is provided in Appendix B). The example shows that, to achieve this, strong cancellations between different windows must occur, which tends to enhance uncertainties. This is a manifestation of the corresponding ill-posed inverse Laplace transform. In this context, as recently also discussed in Ref. [117], precise knowledge of the covariance matrix of the windows within a lattice-QCD calculation is needed. The different setups regarding statistical sampling techniques, as well as the treatment of lattice systematics, make it difficult to provide a generally optimal recommendation. We encourage lattice collaborations to consider computing the additional modified windows and make the covariance matrices available to facilitate such optimizations.To illustrate this, we show an example in Fig. 3 that is built to have a significant localization in √ s (another example, together with some details on how to build such linear combinations, is provided in Appendix B).

        <p>In this work, we discussed the role of Euclidean window quantities to scrutinize the origin of potential conflicts between evaluations of the HVP contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon in lattice QCD and from e + e -→ hadrons data. As a first step, we provided phenomenological comparison numbers for the standard windows typically considered in lattice-QCD calculations, following Ref. [1] to account for tensions in the database. We then extended this setup in a minimal way that allows for more detailed studies of different energy regions, by dividing the intermediate window in half and adding commensurate Euclidean windows in either direction. Again, we provided the corresponding comparison numbers for these windows and the correlations among them, which allows building and studying general linear combinations. Correlations in the 2π channel, for Ref. [11] (upper triangle) and Ref. [8] (lower triangle). The latter do not include the systematic uncertainties of the dispersive representation but reflect the correlations of the fit parameters. While this choice of windows, as illustrated in Fig. 2, can be considered a minimal extension, it is by no means unique. Depending on forthcoming lattice-QCD results, other variants might prove more useful in isolating phenomenological tensions or minimizing specific sources of uncertainty. Such modifications can be implemented following the procedure established here. However, optimizing window observables also requires precise knowledge of the covariance matrices in lattice-QCD calculations.

The momentum-space weight function has a maximum at √ s = 0.5 GeV and stays in magnitude below 10% of the peak value for √ s &gt; 1 GeV. In Table B.7, we list the contributions of the different channels to this linear combination, where the uncertainties have been propagated with the provided correlations.

        <p>As an alternative strategy to weight functions that are localized in center-of-mass energy, one could try to alleviate the problems connected with the inverse Laplace transform by constructing different linear combinations that are dominated by individual Table A. 6 Correlations in the 3π channel, for Ref. [11] (upper triangle) and Ref. [9] (lower triangle). The latter do not include the systematic uncertainties of the dispersive representation but reflect the correlations of the fit parameters. hadronic channels instead of localized energy regions. The second panel of Table B. 7 and Fig. B.4 show linear combinations of the seven windows that are defined as follows: the combinations "mostly 2π ," "mostly 3π ," and "mostly rest" reproduce the HVP contributions of the 2π , 3π , and remaining channels, respectively, from linear combinations of windows 2 to 6 only (windows 1 and 7 are expected to be hampered most by lattice-QCD uncertainties). Two free parameters in each combination are tuned to minimize the amplitude of the Euclidean-time weight functions. The last combination sums with the first three combinations to unit weight. While in principle these combinations allow one to focus on contributions from individual channels, the oscillations in the Euclidean-time weight functions are still large, although somewhat reduced compared to the strategy of localized weight functions (rescaling the weight comb so that its 2π component matches the full 2π contribution leads to an amplitude twice as large as the one of the "mostly 2π " Euclidean-time weight function). Note that these linear combinations mainly serve as illustrations but choosing different energy cutoffs for the 2π and 3π channels should not change the picture qualitatively. Future updates of the cross-section data would lead to admixtures of the different channels (see Table B.7 for the current uncertainties) unless the combinations are adjusted. Finally, the free parameters of the combinations could be tuned to minimize lattice-QCD uncertainties. Whether such a strategy could disentangle contributions from different channels in realistic lattice-QCD simulations depends on the covariance matrices, which thus provides further motivation to make both the window quantities and their correlations available.As an alternative strategy to weight functions that are localized in center-of-mass energy, one could try to alleviate the problems connected with the inverse Laplace transform by constructing different linear combinations that are dominated by individual Table A. 6 Correlations in the 3π channel, for Ref.

        <p>In this appendix, we provide additional details on the correlations of the window quantities studied in Sec. 3. The uncertainties in each window are already separated into experimental and additional systematic uncertainties for the 2π and 3π channels in Table 2. These systematic errors are added in quadrature to the total experimental error from Ref. [11] to obtain the final uncertainty. In a similar fashion, the full covariance matrix is obtained by summing the experimental covariance matrix with the additional systematic covariance matrices. Since the entries of the latter are 100% correlated among all windows, they follow in a straightforward way from Table 2. The experimental correlations are given explicitly in Table A. 4.In this appendix, we provide additional details on the correlations of the window quantities studied in Sec. 3.
