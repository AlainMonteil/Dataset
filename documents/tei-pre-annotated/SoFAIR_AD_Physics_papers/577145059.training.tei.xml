        <p>A novel multigeneration system using dual renewable energy sources (i.e., geothermal and solar) is introduced, analyzed, and optimized. The integration of a geothermal line, a solar tower, a steam Rankine cycle, two organic Rankine cycles, an ejector refrigeration cycle, a thermoelectric generator unit, and a reverse osmosis subsystem forms the entire system. The outputs of this energy-conversion system are heating load, cooling load, electricity, and freshwater. Regarding methodology, the energy, exergy, and exergoeconomic approaches are implemented to assess the system from thermodynamic and economic viewpoints. Moreover, an optimization process based on exergy efficiency and the total unit cost of products is executed to determine the system's optimal decision variables. The results obtained from the optimization process show that the proposed system is able to achieve 25.4% exergy efficiency and 34.1 $/GJ total unit cost of products, exhibiting 48% and 43% improvement compared to a base case study. Furthermore, the methodology is demonstrated on a case study where the system operates at its optimum condition in a specific location. Having monthly average values of direct normal irradiation for this spot, the average hourly performance of the system is evaluated for each month. Based on the obtained results, the minimum and maximum freshwater production rates are 3.06 kg/s and 3.84 kg/s, respectively. It can be estimated that a range of 1224 to 1536 individuals, varying from month to month, can receive the produced freshwater.A novel multigeneration system using dual renewable energy sources (i.e., geothermal and solar) is introduced, analyzed, and optimized.

        <p>The climate risks such as the global warming crisis have become increasingly a pressing problem facing people and societies worldwide. According to the new IPCC report, it demands serious actions and fundamental changes to enhance our ability to deal with climate change [1]. Energy production is a major contributing factor to this issue [2]. This clearly highlights the necessity of harnessing environmentallybenign energy resources that are the backbone of the transition to sustainable and green energy systems. Some renewable energies are obtainable and abundant in nature, such as solar, biomass, wind, waves, tides, hydro, ocean currents, ocean thermal, and geothermal [3,4]. Despite the fact that renewable energy resources significantly reduce the adverse impacts on the environment, their conversion efficiency, like any other processes, is still limited due to irreversibilities. To this end, multi-generation processes are a promising solution. Generating multi-products/outputs from the same energy resource is an avenue to expand resource utilization [5]. A multi-generation system can produce electricity, heating, cooling, hot water, fresh water and hydrogen. Therefore, deploying multi-generation energy systems driven by renewable energy resources must be prioritized over fossil fuel and even renewable energy systems having only a single product such as electricity.The climate risks such as the global warming crisis have become increasingly a pressing problem facing people and societies worldwide.

        <p>Among the aforementioned renewable energy sources, solar and geothermal possess the potential to sufficiently fulfill multiple needs, such as the energy demands of societies. According to the WEA (world energy assessment) report, geothermal energy has the largest resources compared with solar photovoltaics, wind and hydro energies in the world [6,7]. The overall efficiency of geothermally-driven power conversion systems is higher than for the majority of other forms of energy. Furthermore, geothermal power plants are known for their higher capacity factors (typically over 90%). As a result, they generally are operated 24/7, producing plentiful amounts of baseload power and heat [8,9]. However, the recent growth in wind and solar deployment presents an opportunity to increase the value of geothermal generation through flexible operations [10]. Similarly, appropriate technologies for harvesting and supplying solar energy are adopted. In that case, the energy demands of the entire world will be theoretically met by solar energy alone. Reducing fossil fuel consumption is one of the key benefits of installing solar thermal systems: a 1-2% reduction has been reported. This type of green energy is also a suitable replacement for scarce renewable sources used in energy systems, such as biomass, and projected to be increasingly demanded in the transport and industrial sectors [11].Among the aforementioned renewable energy sources, solar and geothermal possess the potential to sufficiently fulfill multiple needs, such as the energy demands of societies.

By extracting heat from an injection well via geothermal water, the system provides permanently accessible green energy. At state 1, the geothermal hot water goes through the evaporator of the first organic Rankine cycle (ORC1), where heat is transferred to Isobutane (the working fluid of ORC1). The power generated in this subsystem will be sent to the grid after supplying the electricity required for all pumps except for that of a desalination unit. An ejector refrigeration unit consumes the remaining geothermal heat to generate cooling load for residential buildings.

        <p>The exergy destruction of each subsystem is shown in Fig. 2. Obviously, the solar tower exerts the highest rate of exergy destruction, with 860 kW. This is the main reason for the low value of total exergy efficiency. The second highest exergy destruction rate (560 kW) occurs in the geothermal line, which is comprised of three heat exchangers and a TEG unit. Other subsystems cause fewer than 200 kW exergy destruction rate, ranging from 172.4 kW to 29 kW, in the following order: SRC, ERC, ORC 1, RO, and ORC 2. Heat exchangers mainly cause a relatively higher exergy destruction effect, especially when the incoming heat is great. Also, the number of heat exchangers in a unit may have a direct relationship with the amount of exergy destruction rate caused by that unit.

The result of a similar analysis for the solar circuit's decision variables (i.e., number of heliostats and DNI) can also be observed in Fig. 3c. As depicted in Fig. 3a, the geothermal mass flow rate has a greater effect than the geothermal temperature on the cooling load, which varies from 20 kW to 130 kW. Changing geothermal decision variables also changes domestic hot water production (Fig. 3b). Again, the mass flow rate plays a more dominant role in heating load generation. Finally, from Fig. 3c, it can be inferred that both the number of heliostats and DNI have somewhat similar effects on domestic hot water production. The effect of the first three decision variables on performance indicators is addressed in the following. These performance indicators are exergy efficiency, the total unit cost of products, net produced power, and freshwater production. Regarding Fig. 4, as the geothermal mass flow rate changes from 2 to 15, net produced electricity escalates by more than double, while the freshwater mass flow rate declines by merely 2%. Since the power for the RO unit is supplied by three powergenerating units (i.e., SRC, ORC 2, and TEG), a complex relationship exists between the geothermal mass flow rate and the produced freshwater mass flow rate, as shown in Fig. 4a. At 2 kg/s, the TEG produces a relatively high amount of power, but this value declines at higher geothermal mass flow rates. On the other hand, SRC and ORC 2 produce more power at higher geothermal mass flow rates, pushing the freshwater production curve a little bit higher. Regarding Fig. 4b, it is evident that high geothermal mass flow rates can improve exergy efficiency and decrease total cost. At 15 kg/s, both performance indicators are improved by nearly 65% compared to the results of the lowest geothermal mass flow rate. This indicates that the system performs better at higher geothermal mass flow rates and it can be validated after carrying out optimization.The range of decision variables considered for the multi-objective optimization process. change of cooling and heating loads based on simultaneous alteration of the two geothermal decision variables (i.e., geothermal mass flow rate and geothermal temperature) are shown.

        <p>In comparison with the geothermal mass flow rate, the geothermal temperature demonstrates a less significant effect on all output variables (Fig. 5). As the geothermal water temperature rises from 125 • C to 165 • C, there is almost 8% enhancement of freshwater production, 14% lower cost rate, 2.5% exergy efficiency improvement, and 30% net produced electricity boost. As one can notice, total exergy efficiency reaches its peak at a geothermal temperature value of around 154 • C, implying to be potentially an optimal value. It is clear that overall system performance is also enhanced in this case.In comparison with the geothermal mass flow rate, the geothermal temperature demonstrates a less significant effect on all output variables (Fig. 5).

Net produced electricity also sees a 90 kW improvement as the number of heliostats increases from 25 to 65. On the other hand, Fig. 6b shows that the total exergetic performance of the system declines and the total unit cost of products increases, with 30% and 32%, respectively. It suggests a low number of heliostats as a sensible decision. This is in harmony with the main objective of the optimization process we aim to carry out in the next section that means to regulate decision variables to attain maximum exergy efficiency while keeping the total cost of products as low as possible.As shown in Fig. 6a, the number of heliostats can have a far-reaching effect on freshwater production, causing an almost 110% growth.

        <p>At the optimal condition, the major cost flow rates of the system are graphically illustrated in Fig. 8 via a Sankey diagram. As can be seen, the cost rate of the incoming geothermal heat is 7.5 $/h which decreases stage by stage up until the solar circuit. In the first subsystem (ORC 1), the cost rate of power generation for the grid is 9.3 $/h. Regarding the cost balance in this unit, the remaining cost rate (1.7 $/h) is related to pump 1 and the 11th stream. In ERC, generating cooling load costs 0.4 $/h, and the extra 3 $/h can be attributed to pump 2 and the 23rd stream. Since the solar circuit, SRC, and ORC 2 are connected in a cascade way, they can be taken as a compact unit for the sake of simplicity. From the cost balance in this unit, the remaining cost rate (0.7 $/h) relates to the contribution of pump 3, pump 4, and the 36th stream. The power output of this block of units is 6.8 $/h. After receiving heat from the solar circuit, the cost rate of the geothermal line at state 4 rises to 4.8 $/h. This stream goes into the TEG unit, in which electricity and hot water are produced at 0.5 $/h and 3.1 $/h, respectively. As can be observed from the RO unit, it possesses the highest capital cost rate in the entire system, with 26.7 $/h.

Based on these values, a case study was conducted to evaluate system performance under the meteorological condition of Minab city on a monthly basis. The following notes can be concluded from this study:</p>
        <p>• Regarding the base case study, the following results were obtained:• Regarding the base case study, the following results were obtained:</p>
        <p>17.2% total exergy efficiency, 59.7 $/GJ total cost rate of products, 15 kg/s potable water production, 82.8 kW cooling load, 1.5 MW heating load, and 311.4 kW generated electricity for the grid. • Exergy destruction results showed that the solar tower and the geothermal line had the highest exergy destruction rates, at 860 kW and 560 kW, respectively. • Among the three decision variables examined via parametric study, the geothermal mass flow rate, number of heliostats, and geothermal temperature had successively the highest to the least impact on the performance indicators. • Five decision variables were opted to perform multi-objective optimization, for which exergy efficiency and total unit cost of products were selected as objective functions. At the optimum condition, exergy efficiency, freshwater mass flow rate, electricity generation, and total unit cost of products were 25.4%, 9.1 kg/s, 423.7 kW, and 34.1 $/GJ, respectively. • Using the DNI of Minab and employing the optimal inputs, the monthly performance of the system was evaluated for this region.17.2% total exergy efficiency, 59.7 $/GJ total cost rate of products, 15 kg/s potable water production, 82.8 kW cooling load, 1.5 MW heating load, and 311.4 kW generated electricity for the grid. • Exergy destruction results showed that the solar tower and the geothermal line had the highest exergy destruction rates, at 860 kW and 560 kW, respectively. • Among the three decision variables examined via parametric study, the geothermal mass flow rate, number of heliostats, and geothermal temperature had successively the highest to the least impact on the performance indicators. • Five decision variables were opted to perform multi-objective optimization, for which exergy efficiency and total unit cost of products were selected as objective functions.
