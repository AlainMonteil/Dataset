        <p>General Management: -Dr. Karsten Tillmann, Ernst Ruska-Centre, Jülich Research Centre, 52425 Jülich, Germany, phone: ++49.2461.61.1438, e-mail: k.tillmann@fz-juelich.de</p>
        <p>Abstract: The FEI Titan G2 80-200 CREWLEY is a fourth generation transmission electron microscope which has been speci cally designed for the investigation of a wide range of solid state phenomena taking place on the atomic scale of both the structure and chemical composition. For these purposes, the FEI Titan G2 80-200 CREWLEY is equipped with a Schottky type high-brightness electron gun (FEI X-FEG), a Cs probe corrector (CEOS DCOR), an in-column Super-X energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) unit (ChemiSTEM technology), a post-column energy lter system (Gatan En nium ER 977) with dual electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) option allowing a simultaneous read-out of EDX and EELS signals at a speed of 1000 spectra per second. For data recording the microscope is equipped with an angular dark-eld (ADF) scanning TEM (STEM) detector (Fischione Model 3000), onaxis triple BF, DF1, DF2 detectors, on-axis BF/DF Gatan detectors as well as a 4 megapixel CCD system (Gatan UltraScan 1000 XP-P). Typical examples of use and technical speci cations for the instrument are given below.</p>
        <p>1 System Overview</p>
        <p>The con guration of the FEI Titan G2 80-200 CREWLEY allows a variety of advanced transmission electron microscopy techniques to be applied to wide variety of solid state materials. These techniques include high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) with annular detectors for bright-eld, annular dark-eld, and high-angle annular dark eld imaging, electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), electron tomography (ET), and combinations of the previous techniques. The excellent analytical research possibilities make the instrument an ultimate solution for studies of the structure and chemistry of materials in high-spatial resolution.</p>
        <p>The FEI Titan G2 80-200 CREWLEY is not intended for the investigation of aqueous, contaminated, ferromagnetic or organic samples without further discussions with both of the instruments o cers and the ER-C general management.</p>
        <p>Apart from the special case of the utilisation of dedicated cooling or heating stages, the FEI Titan G2 80-200 CREWLEY will allow samples to be investigated either under room temperature or liquid nitrogen cooling conditions at a vacuum level of about 10 -8 mbar. Besides this standard setup, the sample environment can be adapted to various conditions, e.g. the thermal treatment or the application of external electric or magnetic elds to samples, making use of a wide portfolio of in situ TEM holders available through the ER-C user services. The microscope is equipped with a large LN2 dewar, which holds liquid nitrogen for more than three days for optimum conditions around the sample.</p>
