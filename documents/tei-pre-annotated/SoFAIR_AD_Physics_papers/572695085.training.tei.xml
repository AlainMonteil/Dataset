        <p>where this relationship demonstrates that the yield stress, σ y , necessary for yielding and plastic deformation of polycrystalline materials changes linearly with the reciprocal of the square root of the grain size, d. In Eq. (1), σ 0 is the friction stress (or yield stress of a single crystal) and A is a positive material constant. This equation, which has become one of the most cited in materials science, demonstrates the basic strengthening mechanism in polycrystalline materials, as the yield stress and then the strength increase with decreasing grain size.where this relationship demonstrates that the yield stress, σ y , necessary for yielding and plastic deformation of polycrystalline materials changes linearly with the reciprocal of the square root of the grain size, d.

        <p>This relationship soon became a driving force of several efforts to obtain finer grain sizes in conventional materials [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11]. Thus, through various severe plastic deformation (SPD) processes [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] in bulk crystalline materials, average grain sizes in the sub-micrometer (d &lt; 1000 nm) range were achieved and this significantly increased the strength of these ultrafine-grained materials.This relationship soon became a driving force of several efforts to obtain finer grain sizes in conventional materials [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11].

        <p>In practice it is important to note that both Hall and Petch developed Eq. ( 1) phenomenologically, basing their conclusions on experimental data obtained on samples of iron, copper and brass [1][2][3]. This relationship is well established for polycrystalline metals and alloys having average grain sizes of d &gt; 1 μm, but more recent studies show that the relationship no longer holds in the range of sub-micron and exceptionally small grain sizes. On the one hand the parameter A in Eq. ( 1) paradoxically decreases in the submicron range [12][13][14] and on the other hand at grain sizes below approximately 20 nm the Hall-Petch equation is no longer valid since, as the grain size decreases, the yield strength also decreases and the material becomes softer [11,12,14]. This latter behavior is also called the inverse Hall-Petch effect and it has been explained using several different interpretive models [15][16][17].In practice it is important to note that both Hall and Petch developed Eq.

        <p>The present work is focused on experimental data obtained from submicron-structured materials having grain sizes in the range between 100 and 1000 nm.

        <p>When a polycrystalline specimen is subjected to a gradually increasing load, the critical shear stress is first reached in the slip plane having the most favorable orientation in any selected grain. If there is a Frank-Read source, S, belonging to this slip system, it will emit a series of dislocations as shown schematically in grain A of Fig. 1a. As a result of increasing external forces, the source emits an increasing number of dislocations which then pile up at the grain boundary (GB) as shown in Fig. 1b. In the stress field of the pile-ups, a maximum tensile stress, σ pile , forms in the adjacent grain with a magnitude given by Ref.

        <p>The application of Eq.

For the purpose of the analysis, it is worthwhile examining the data in a double logarithmic representation as shown in Fig. 2. It should be noted that, for a given material, the σ o term is usually much smaller than the yield stress of the ultrafine-grains. For example, for pure Cu σ o is less than 30 MPa and σ is greater than 380 MPa [31]. For this reason, to a first approximation, and with an error of less than 10%, the normalized stress (σ/ μ) can be considered proportional to the power of the normalized grain size (d/b).The application of Eq.

        <p>The fact that several ultrafine-grained metals and alloys behave according to this modified Hall-Petch relationship is indicative of the robustness of the applicability of the model and the underlying physical phenomenon. Based on Eq. ( 11) with the parameters given above, the strength of any sub-micron structured fcc metal or solid solution may be estimated if the grain-size is known. It should be noted that the conventional Hall-Petch behavior (for d &gt; 1000 nm, β = -1/2) is the consequence of the activation of multiple slip within the individual grains. In the case of single slip (d &lt; 100 nm), β = -1. In the middle range, the value of -3/4 for β is certainly representing an intermediate state in the slip-system.The fact that several ultrafine-grained metals and alloys behave according to this modified Hall-Petch relationship is indicative of the robustness of the applicability of the model and the underlying physical phenomenon.
