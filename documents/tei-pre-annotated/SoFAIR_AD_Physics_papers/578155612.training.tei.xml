        <p>Introduction. Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) form an intriguing paradigm of ergodicity breaking in interacting systems that are typically expected to thermalize due to their nonintegrability and spatial homogeneity [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]. QMBS comprise eigenstates of low entanglement entropy [9,10], many of which reside in the middle of the spectrum, and are often separated roughly equally in energy [11,12]. These eigenstates are nonthermal, forming a "cold" subspace that is weakly connected to the rest of the Hilbert space. Consequently, quenches starting in initial states with high overlap with these nonthermal states do not show typical thermalization, but instead exhibit long-lived coherent dynamics [13,14]. This behavior is of particular interest to fundamental investigations of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) [15][16][17][18][19][20], as it has been linked to novel mechanisms for avoiding thermalization in closed quantum systems based on spectrum generating algebras [21][22][23][24] and embedding of nonthermal eigenstates [25] (see recent reviews [26,27]). Moreover, given that QMBS constitute high-or even infinite-temperature states, when the system is initially prepared in them it will not dephase its information, which is pertinent to applications in quantum memory and information processing [28][29][30][31].Introduction.

        <p>QMBS are also relevant to gauge theories [32][33][34][35][36], which describe the interactions of elementary particles mediated by gauge bosons through an extensive set of local constraints [37][38][39]. A paradigmatic example of the latter is Gauss's law in quantum electrodynamics (QED), where the distribution of charged matter strictly specifies the allowed configurations of the surrounding electromagnetic field [40]. Recently, a concerted experimental effort has emerged for the implementation of gauge theories in synthetic quantum matter (SQM) devices [41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51]. This has been facilitated in large part due to the great progress achieved in the precision and control of SQM setups [52,53], making the quantum simulation of gauge theories a realistic endeavor [54][55][56][57][58][59][60]. Due to the complexity of these experiments, the implementations often focus on quantum link formulations of gauge theories, where spin-S operators model the gauge fields, which in QED span an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space [61]. This has allowed the first large-scale realization of the spin- 1 2 U(1) quantum link model (QLM) in 1 + 1 dimensions [(1 + 1)D] using ultracold atoms [50,51].QMBS are also relevant to gauge theories [32][33][34][35][36], which describe the interactions of elementary particles mediated by gauge bosons through an extensive set of local constraints [37][38][39].

        <p>The first experimental observation of QMBS was achieved in a Rydberg-atom setup implementing the PXP model [1], a paradigm of QMBS which maps to the spin- 1 2 U(1) QLM [33]. Such a mapping breaks down at S &gt; 1 2 , and it remains an open question whether QMBS persist at larger link spin lengths in the QLM formulation of QED, and, if they do, what their form will be. In this Letter, we show that QMBS are ubiquitous in lattice gauge theories for all values of spin S 5 2 accessible in numerical simulations. For a zero-mass quench, QMBS arise when the system is prepared in the extreme vacua of the spin-S U(1) QLM, which are the most highly excited vacuum states of lattice QED. Furthermore, we find that preparing the system in the physical (least excited) vacua or in the charge-proliferated state can still lead to detuned scarring behavior for certain massive quenches, similar to the case of S = 1 2 that has recently been demonstrated experimentally in a tilted Bose-Hubbard optical lattice [7]. The nonthermalizing dynamics due to QMBS provides a useful benchmark for the upcoming realizations of larger-S lattice gauge theories in cold-atom quantum simulators and the exploration of their out-of-equilibrium properties [48,57].The first experimental observation of QMBS was achieved in a Rydberg-atom setup implementing the PXP model [1], a paradigm of QMBS which maps to the spin- 1 2 U(1) QLM [33].

        <p>With respect to the eigenstates of Hamiltonian (1) at µ= g = 0, we find through ED that only |0 -exhibits the overlap behavior indicative of scarring for general S (see Fig. 1). Just as in the known case of S = 1 2 , we also see at other values of S signatures of 2SL + 1 towers equally spaced in energy (see insets), exhibiting large overlap with |0 -, particularly in the middle of the spectrum. The overlap of the top band of states can be further enhanced by considering a truncated version of the QED gauge field [67]. Note how for all values of S that we consider, there is a prominent zero-energy mode with the largest overlap. The presence of these eigenstates is evidence of weak ergodicity breaking in the model. Due to the scaling term 1/ √ S(S + 1), the ground-state energy E 0 is approximately independent of S at µ= g 2 = 0, and we find numerically that E 0 ≈ -0.32L. As the spectrum is symmetric around zero, we can use this along with the number of towers to get the approximate energy spacing between towers as E ≈ -2E 0 /(2SL) ≈ 0.32/S. We note that the various approximation schemes for scarred eigenstates in the PXP model also show good results for QLMs with larger S [67].With respect to the eigenstates of Hamiltonian (1) at µ= g = 0, we find through ED that only |0 -exhibits the overlap behavior indicative of scarring for general S (see Fig. 1).

        <p>In the case of S = 1 2 , |0 + = |0 -, as the last term of Eq. ( 1) is an inconsequential energy constant since (ŝ z j, j+1 ) 2 = 1. Quenching this vacuum state with Ĥ at µ= 0 is known to lead to scarring behavior for S = 1 2 [1,33], and this is exhibited in the revivals of the fidelity, shown in the FIG. 3. Dynamics of the mid-chain entanglement entropy for the same quench and initial states considered in Fig. 2. For all considered values of the link spin length S, an anomalously low and slowly growing entanglement entropy arises when the initial state is the extreme vacuum. Preparing the system in the charge-proliferated state or the physical vacuum leads to a fast growth in the entanglement entropy except for the case of S = 1 2 , where the physical and extreme vacua are the same. top left panel of Fig. 2. For comparison, we have included the fidelity dynamics for |ψ (0) = |CP , which shows no revivals, in agreement with what is established in the literature for this quench when S = 1 2 [26]. However, once the link spin length is S &gt; 1 2 , we find that the fidelity dynamics exhibits revivals only when the system is initialized in the extreme vacuum |ψ (0) = |0 -, whereas neither the physical vacuum |0 + nor the charge-proliferated state |CP give rise to scarring behavior; see Fig. 2 for S = 1, 3 2 , 2. We have checked that the other vacua |σ z 1 , s z 1,2 , σ z 2 , s z 2,3 = |+1, ±M, -1, ±M with 1 2 &lt; M &lt; S and higher-energy charge-proliferated states are also not scarred states [67]. From the previous estimate of the energies of scarred towers, we expect the revival period to be T ≈ 6.25π S. However, in practice the energy spacing between towers varies throughout the spectrum. So the relevant energy spacing is the one near E = 0, where the scarred states have the higher overlap with |0 -. This provides an estimate of T ≈ 5.13π S, which agrees much more accurately with the numerical data. We explore the effect of scarring on the dynamics of the mid-chain entanglement entropy S L/2 (t ), shown in Fig. 3 for S = 1 2 to 2. S L/2 is defined as the von Neumann entropy for the reduced density matrix describing one half of the chain. In all cases, starting in the extreme vacuum leads to an anomalously low S L/2 (t ) exhibiting significantly slower growth, whereas preparing the system in the charge-proliferated state leads to a rapid increase of the entanglement entropy. Except for the case of S = 1 2 where the extreme and physical vacua are the same, starting in the physical vacuum leads to qualitatively similar behavior to that of the charge-proliferated state, with a rapid growth in S L/2 (t ). These findings are consistent with nonthermal scarred dynamics only when the initial state is prepared in the extreme vacuum.In the case of S = 1 2 , |0 + = |0 -, as the last term of Eq.

While the available values remain far from 1, the deviation clearly grows with S, indicating a weakening of scarring towards the Kogut-Susskind limit S → ∞. At the same time, there is no convergence of the data with respect to S, implying that larger values of S are needed in order to reach a reliable conclusion about the existence of ergodicity breaking in the S → ∞ limit.To quantify ergodicity breaking, in the inset to Fig. 4 we plot the deviation of the first minimum in E (t ) from -1 as a function of S.

At the same time, there is no convergence of the data with respect to S, implying that larger values of S are needed in order to reach a reliable conclusion about the existence of ergodicity breaking in the S → ∞ limit.</p>
        <p>As such, we have demonstrated that for a quench at µ= g = 0, the spin-S U(1) QLM (1) exhibits scarring behavior when the system is initially prepared in an extreme vacuum. The underlying scarring mechanism is precession of a "large" spin of magnitude SL [70]. The relation between scarring and the Hilbert space constraint can be firmed up by studying the structure of the adjacency of the Hamiltonian [67].As such, we have demonstrated that for a quench at µ= g = 0, the spin-S U(1) QLM (1) exhibits scarring behavior when the system is initially prepared in an extreme vacuum.

        <p>Detuned scarring. In a recent study [7], it has been shown theoretically and demonstrated experimentally that there are scarring regimes beyond the resonant one discussed above. This was demonstrated in the spin- 1 2 U(1) QLM by starting 2 . Towers of eigenstates equally spaced in energy emerge, indicating the presence of QMBS. We confirm this picture by calculating the dynamics of the fidelity in the wake of this quench. For all accessible evolution times, we find consistent revivals in the fidelity, strongly indicative of scarred dynamics.

        <p>Motivated by the question as to whether QMBS persist in lattice QED for physically relevant initial states, we explore these detuned scarring regimes in the spin- 3 2 U(1) QLM starting in either the physical vacuum |0 + or the chargeproliferated state |CP . As shown in Fig. 5, the overlap of these initial states with the eigenstates of the quench Hamiltonian (1) at µ= 0.486J and g 2 = 0.6J shows distinctive towers equally spaced in energy, similar to the known case of S = 1 2 [7]. Also displayed in Fig. 5 is the fidelity dynamics for each of |0 + and |CP upon quenching them with this Hamiltonian, where we see persistent revivals up to all considered evolution times. We also arrive at a similar picture for other values of S, and in fact we find a wide range of values of (μ, g 2 ) over which scarring behavior emerges [67].Motivated by the question as to whether QMBS persist in lattice QED for physically relevant initial states, we explore these detuned scarring regimes in the spin- 3 2 U(1) QLM starting in either the physical vacuum |0 + or the chargeproliferated state |CP .

        <p>Given that |0 + and |CP are both physically relevant in lattice QED in one spatial dimension, and since the latter has been shown to be achieved at relatively small values of S both in [68,71,72] and out of equilibrium [73], our results suggest that QMBS may play a role for understanding dynamics in physically interesting regimes as well.Given that |0 + and |CP are both physically relevant in lattice QED in one spatial dimension, and since the latter has been shown to be achieved at relatively small values of S both in [68,71,72] and out of equilibrium [73], our results suggest that QMBS may play a role for understanding dynamics in physically interesting regimes as well.</p>
        <p>Summary. In conclusion, we have demonstrated an abundance of QMBS in the paradigmatic spin-S U(1) QLM, a staple of modern SQM experiments on lattice gauge theories. We have shown that the regime of resonant scarring for quenches at zero mass, prevalent in the literature in the case of S = 1 2 , is also present in the case of S &gt; 1 2 when the system is initially prepared in an extreme vacuum, where the local electric field takes on its largest possible eigenvalue. This has been demonstrated by ergodicity-breaking properties of many-body eigenstates, obtained using ED, as well as by showing the existence of quantum revivals in local observables in the TL using infinite matrix product state method. The extreme vacua associated are not physical as ground states in lattice QED, but they are product states easily implementable in SQM experiments [48,57]. These experiments, in particular, could provide key insight into the persistence of ergodicity breaking upon approaching the limit S → ∞, which our classical simulations cannot reliably access.Summary.

        <p>We have also presented evidence of detuned scarring in the spin-S U(1) QLM arising from quenches at small nonzero mass and electric-field coupling, when the system is initially prepared in either the physical vacuum, where the local electric field takes on its lowest possible eigenvalue, or the charge-proliferated state. While the scarring phenomenology is similar to the resonant case, the initial states associated with detuned scarring are physically relevant as low-energy states in lattice QED. Given that recent works have shown convergence to the latter limit in and out of equilibrium already at S 3 2 , our results suggest that this detuned scarring regime may already exist in lattice QED.We have also presented evidence of detuned scarring in the spin-S U(1) QLM arising from quenches at small nonzero mass and electric-field coupling, when the system is initially prepared in either the physical vacuum, where the local electric field takes on its lowest possible eigenvalue, or the charge-proliferated state.
