        <p>Deriving the expansion history of the Universe is a major goal of modern cosmology. To date, the most accurate measurements have been obtained with Type Ia Supernovae (SNe) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), providing evidence for the existence of a transition epoch at which the expansion rate changes from decelerated to accelerated. However, these results have been obtained within the framework of specific cosmological models that must be implicitly or explicitly assumed in the measurement. It is therefore crucial to obtain measurements of the accelerated expansion of the Universe independently of assumptions on cosmological models. Here we exploit the unprecedented statistics provided by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS, [1, 2, 3]) Data Release 9 to provide new constraints on the Hubble parameter H(z) using the cosmic chronometers approach. We extract a sample of more than 130000 of the most massive and passively evolving galaxies, obtaining five new cosmology-independent H(z) measurements in the redshift range 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 0.5, with an accuracy of ∼11-16% incorporating both statistical and systematic errors. Once combined, these measurements yield a 6% accuracy constraint of H(z = 0.4293) = 91.8 ± 5.3 km/s/Mpc. The new data are crucial to provide the first cosmology-independent determination of the transition redshift at high statistical significance, measuring z t = 0.4 ± 0.1, and to significantly disfavor the null hypothesis of no transition between decelerated and accelerated expansion at 99.9% confidence level. This analysis highlights the wide potential of the cosmic chronometers approach: it permits to derive constraints on the expansion history of the Universe with results competitive with standard probes, and most importantly, being the estimates independent of the cosmological model, it can constrain cosmologies beyondand including -the ΛCDM model.Deriving the expansion history of the Universe is a major goal of modern cosmology.

        <p>Almost 15 years have now passed since the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the Universe, based on the work by refs. [4] and [5]. Since then, constraining the expansion rate of the Universe as a function of redshift H(z) has become one of the most compelling tasks of modern cosmology, since it determines the scale factor a(t) in the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric; as a consequence, this allows us to probe the properties of the fundamental components of the Universe, helping to better understand their nature. Widening the panorama of cosmological probes is therefore of extreme interest, in order to take advantage of the strength of each method and to keep systematics under control (for a detailed review, see ref. [6]).Almost 15 years have now passed since the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the Universe, based on the work by refs. [4] and [5].

        <p>So far, the best measurements have been obtained with standard candles (SNe) [4,5] and standard rulers (BAO) [7,8]. These cosmological probes have provided exceptional results over the last decades, and contributed, together with the study of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) [9], to the development of the standard ΛCDM cosmological model. One of their main limitations, however, is that they do not constrain the Hubble parameter directly, but one of its integrals (e.g., the luminosity distance [4]) or the parameters that are used to model it. In order to set constraints on the cosmological model, it is necessary to obtain an independent determination of the expansion rate, which could then be used to test the model itself.So far, the best measurements have been obtained with standard candles (SNe) [4,5] and standard rulers (BAO) [7,8].

        <p>A possible way to achieve this task is given by the "cosmic chronometers" method. According to this method, firstly suggested by ref. [10], the relative age of old and passive galaxies dz/dt can be used to directly constrain the expansion history of the Universe. The most important point to emphasize is that because the differential dating of passively evolving galaxies only depends on atomic physics and does not include any integrated distance measurement over redshift, it is independent of the cosmological model or assumptions about the metric, and thus can be used to place constraints on it.A possible way to achieve this task is given by the "cosmic chronometers" method.

        <p>In ref. [11], analyzing a sample of ∼11000 massive and passive galaxies, eight new measurements of the Hubble parameter have been provided with an accuracy of ∼5-12% in the redshift range 0.15 &lt; z &lt; 1.1, significantly extending the redshift coverage and precision of previous similar analysis [12,13]. The majority of the sample in this work was at low redshift (z &lt; 0.3), where the most accurate constraints were obtained. The potential of this new method in comparison with more standard probes has been studied by many authors [14,15,16,17], which demonstrated how the cosmic chronometers method can be competitive for many aspects with Supernovae type Ia (SNe) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) in constraining cosmological parameters.In ref.

        <p>In this paper, we want to exploit the phenomenal set of data provided by the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS, [1,2,3]), which represents the largest sample of massive galaxies spectra available so far at 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.8, to provide new H(z) measurements with the highest possible accuracy at these redshifts. This sample allows us to minimize all possible uncertainties, by improving the statistics used so far by ∼2 orders of magnitude at these redshifts. BOSS data also represent a very well defined spectroscopic sample, being targeted to select the most massive envelope of the galaxy population at these redshifts [18]. Moreover, the redshift range probed by BOSS proves to be fundamental to set cosmology independent constraints on the redshift at which the Universe expansion turns from decelerated to accelerated, which we refer to as the cosmological transition redshift [19,20,21,22].In this paper, we want to exploit the phenomenal set of data provided by the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS, [1,2,3]), which represents the largest sample of massive galaxies spectra available so far at 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.8, to provide new H(z) measurements with the highest possible accuracy at these redshifts.

        <p>2 Method: the cosmic chronometers approach An accurate measurement of the expansion rate as a function of cosmic time is extremely challenging. An alternative and promising method is the "cosmic chronometers" approach, which uses the fact that the expansion rate can be expressed as H(z) = ȧ/a = -1/(1 + z) dz/dt. Since the quantity dz is obtained from spectroscopic surveys with high accuracy, the only quantity to be measured is the differential age evolution of the Universe (dt) in a given redshift interval (dz). Therefore, a measurement of dt corresponds to a direct cosmologyindependent measurement of the Hubble parameter. There are two main challenges to be faced: the identification of an optimal tracer of the aging of the Universe with redshift (a "cosmic chronometer"), and the reliable dating of its age.2 Method: the cosmic chronometers approach An accurate measurement of the expansion rate as a function of cosmic time is extremely challenging.

        <p>The best cosmic chronometers are galaxies that are evolving passively on a timescale much longer than their age difference. Based on several observational results, there is general agreement that these are massive (M stars &gt; 10 11 M ⊙ ) early-type galaxies which formed the vast majority (&gt;90%) of their stellar mass rapidly (∼0.1-0.3 Gyr) early in the Universe (at high-redshifts z &gt; 2 -3), and have not experienced any subsequent major episode of star for-mation since. Therefore they are the oldest objects at any redshift [23,24,25,26,27,28,29]. Thus, when observed at cosmic times considerably later than their formation epoch, the age evolution of their stars serves a clock that is synchronized with the evolution of cosmic time. Previous works [11,30,31,32] have also demonstrated that it is possible to obtain reliable and accurate cosmic chronometers using passively evolving selected galaxies. Recently, the independent analysis of SDSS-DR8 luminous red galaxies by ref. [33] has confirmed that massive and quiescent galaxies can be reliably used as cosmic chronometers.The best cosmic chronometers are galaxies that are evolving passively on a timescale much longer than their age difference.

        <p>It is important to underline that the main strength of this method is that it relies on a differential approach. On the one hand, it should be noted that the relevant quantities in this approach are the relative ages dt, which have the advantage of factorizing out systematic effects inherent to absolute age estimates. On the other hand, this method allows us to keep under control many observational biases which may affects this analysis. One of the main issues is the so-called progenitor bias [34,35], for which high-redshift ETGs are biased by sampling only the oldest and more massive progenitors of more local galaxies, therefore changing the slope of the age-redshift relation. This effect is more severe when galaxy samples are compared in wide redshift ranges, but here each H(z) value is estimated within small redshift slices, with ∆z = 0.1 (as discussed in section 5.1) corresponding to a difference in cosmic time of approximatively 0.7 Gyr at z ∼ 0.45. This is a rather short time for a potential significant evolution of these massive and passive systems, in particular considering that on average they would require more than the age of the Universe to double their mass [27,36]. Moreover, the progenitor bias dominates the low-mass range of the distribution, whereas BOSS galaxies have been selected to be the most massive galaxies (log(M/M ⊙ ) 11) between 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 0.7 (see Fig. 1 of ref. [18]), and further divided in bin of velocity dispersion, which is a proxy for stellar mass.It is important to underline that the main strength of this method is that it relies on a differential approach.

        <p>To minimize the dependence of the age estimate on evolutionary stellar population synthesis (EPS) models, refs. [11,32] proposed an improvement to this technique, consisting in studying a direct observable of galaxy spectra, the 4000 Å break (D4000), instead of galaxy ages. The D4000 feature is a break in the observed spectrum of galaxies defined as the ratio between the continuum flux densities F ν in a red band and a blue band around 4000 Å restframe [37]. The break originates from the onset of a series of metal absorption features, and is known to correlate with the stellar metallicity and age of the stellar population [38], and to be less dependent on the star formation history (SFH) for old stellar populations. Different choices have been proposed to measure the D4000, changing the range of the red and blue bands [37,38,39]. In this work, we considered the definition with narrower bands (D n 4000, 3850-3950 Å and 4000-4100 Å), since it has been shown to be less affected by potential reddening effects [39]. The assumption of a linear relation between D4000 and age of a galaxy has been proven to be an extremely good approximation for various D4000 ranges (see refs.

The factor dz/dD n 4000 is only dependent on observables, while degeneracies between parameters or assumptions of EPS models are contained in the factor A(SF H, Z/Z ⊙ ).

        <p>Starting from BOSS Data Release 9 (DR9), we considered all galaxies with measured stellar masses, emission lines and stellar velocity dispersions, obtaining an original sample consisting of 848697 galaxies for which the D n 4000 index has been measured. As discussed in section 2, the "cosmic chronometers" method relies on the selection of an optimal sample of massive and passive galaxies, minimally contaminated by star-forming galaxies outliers. A star-forming population, with its evolving properties (in terms of age, mass, metal content) as a function of cosmic time, could potentially bias the results. On the contrary, as already discussed, the most massive and passive galaxies represent the most homogeneous sample in terms of epoch and timescale of formation, thus being the best tracers of the age of the Universe as a function of redshift. It is therefore of utmost importance to ensure the purity of the sample by removing all galaxies with residual on-going star formation. A combination of selection cuts in color, spectroscopic properties, and stellar mass (M stars 10 10.75 M ⊙ ) has been demonstrated to maximize the purity of such a passively evolving galaxy sample [36]. We therefore applied the following cuts to obtain our sample.Starting from BOSS Data Release 9 (DR9), we considered all galaxies with measured stellar masses, emission lines and stellar velocity dispersions, obtaining an original sample consisting of 848697 galaxies for which the D n 4000 index has been measured.

        <p>The final sample contains 133912 galaxies, and represents the largest sample of massive and passive galaxies to date, improving current statistics by ∼2 orders of magnitude at these redshifts. This sample was further divided into 5 velocity dispersion bins: σ &lt; 150, 150 &lt; σ &lt; 200, 200 &lt; σ &lt; 250, 250 &lt; σ &lt; 300, and σ &gt; 300 km/s. The properties of the various subsamples are reported in Tab. 1, and the stellar mass and redshift distributions are shown in figure 1. Median stacked spectra have been created for each subsample by co-adding individual spectra in redshift bins of ∆z = 0.025, and the results are shown in figure 2. The redshift binning has been optimized by choosing the smallest width for which the median D n 4000-z Figure 2. Median stacked spectra as a function of redshift bins and σ bins (the upper and lower panels of each plot respectively). The spectra in the upper panels of each plot are extracted at fixed σ (grey lines, 250 &lt; σ &lt; 300), while the spectra in the lower panels are extracted at fixed redshift (colored lines, z ∼ 0.4). The upper plots show the median spectra. All spectra have been normalized near to the vertical dashed lines; therefore the differences in the upper panels flatten at higher wavelengths, but the steepening of the slope of the continuum with increasing mass and decreasing redshift is evident. This trend may be interpreted in the framework of the "mass-downsizing" scenario, with more massive galaxies being redder and older than less massive ones.

This sample was further divided into 5 velocity dispersion bins: σ &lt; 150, 150 &lt; σ &lt; 200, 200 &lt; σ &lt; 250, 250 &lt; σ &lt; 300, and σ &gt; 300 km/s. The properties of the various subsamples are reported in Tab. 1, and the stellar mass and redshift distributions are shown in figure 1. Median stacked spectra have been created for each subsample by co-adding individual spectra in redshift bins of ∆z = 0.025, and the results are shown in figure 2. The redshift binning has been optimized by choosing the smallest width for which the median D n 4000-z Figure 2.

        <p>The stacked spectra presented in figure 2 are typical of a passive population, with a clear red continuum, characteristic absorption features and no noticeable emission lines, demonstrating the effectiveness of the implemented selection criteria. A zoom-in around three specific lines is shown for D n 4000, Hβ, and Fe5015 respectively. The Hβ absorption line is a feature which is almost independent of metallicity, depending mostly only on the age of the galaxy population, being shallower for high ages. From the visual inspection of this line the aging of galaxies with cosmic time is evident, with galaxies at higher redshifts being younger. Fe5015 is instead a good proxy of the metallicity of the galaxy; in this case no significant trend with redshift can be noticed, giving a hint of no metallicity evolution of this population with cosmic time. The absence of clearly visible [OIII]λ5007 line shows the purity of the sample, where all contamination from emission-line galaxies has been removed.The stacked spectra presented in figure 2 are typical of a passive population, with a clear red continuum, characteristic absorption features and no noticeable emission lines, demonstrating the effectiveness of the implemented selection criteria.

        <p>The stellar metallicity Z of the various subsamples has been estimated from full spectral fitting of the median stacked spectra, in bins of redshift and velocity dispersion. The measurements have been performed on the median stacked spectra to increase the S/N from a typical value of about 5/ Å for individual galaxies [41] to about 300 -600/ Å around λ rest = 5000 Å. Depending on the considered bin, the final spectra were obtained by stacking from ∼ 1500 up to ∼ 5000 galaxies (Tab. 1). Moreover, in ref. [43] it was verified that the measurement of the metallicity on individual spectra is consistent with the one obtained on median stacked spectra. It is worth also noting that ref. [44] found a general agreement between estimates obtained from full spectral fitting and from other techniques (e.g. Lick indices), and these results have been more recently confirmed by ref. [28].The stellar metallicity Z of the various subsamples has been estimated from full spectral fitting of the median stacked spectra, in bins of redshift and velocity dispersion.

        <p>Different codes have been used to estimate the mass-weighted metallicity, and the results compared to quantify the robustness of the measurements, namely STARLIGHT [45], VESPA [46] and 
            <rs type="software">FIREFLY</rs> [47]. To further assess the dependence of the results on the assumed parameters, each code has been run adopting two different EPS model, Bruzual &amp; Charlot (2003) (hereafter BC03, [48]) and Maraston &amp; Strömbäck (2011) (hereafter M11, [44]). These two models present substantial differences, such as the treatment of the thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch phase, the method used to estimate integrated spectra, and the stellar evolutionary models adopted to build the isochrones (for more extensive discussion, see e.g. [44,49]). Moreover, they are also based on independent libraries of stellar spectra, the latest MILES models [50] for M11 and STELIB [51] for BC03. The M11 models are based on a selection of libraries of empirical stellar spectra (Pickles, ELODIE, and STELIB), but we studied the ones with MILES models to be consistent with the work done in previous analysis [11]. The two models provide similar metallicity ranges for exploration: Z/Z ⊙ = [0.4, 1, 2.5] for BC03 and Z/Z ⊙ = [0.5, 1, 2] for M11, and have a similar resolution, 3 Å across the wavelength range from 3200 Å to 9500 Å for BC03 [48], and 2.54 Å across the wavelength range from 3525 Å to 7500 Å for M11 [52], similar to BOSS spectra [53]. The full spectral fitting codes applied to estimate the metallicity are described here:
        </p>
        <p>• The full-spectrum fitting code 
            <rs type="software">STARLIGHT</rs> [45,54] provides a fit to both the galaxy spectral continuum and spectral features. It simultaneously fits a stellar population mix, which is given as a combination of spectra defined in user-made libraries, the global stellar velocity dispersion and the amount of dust extinction (in terms of A V ). The contribution of each library spectrum to the best fit model is enclosed in the socalled light-fraction and mass-fraction population vectors, which contain, respectively, the light and the mass fractions with which each library model contributes to the best fit spectrum at a reference wavelength λ. The best fit model is then derived by exploring the parameters space through a mixture of simulated annealing and Metropolis-Hasting Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques.

        <p>• VErsatile Spectral Analysis (VESPA, [46,55]) is a full spectral fitting code to recover non-parametric star-formation and metallicity histories from optical spectra. VESPA works on a grid of ages logarithmically binned between 0.02 and 14 Gyr with a resolution adaptable to the quality of the data, increasing the resolution only where the data demand it. VESPA imposes no constraints on the amount of star formation or metallicity in each age bin. VESPA finds the best-fit solution by appropriately linearizing the problem and then performing a single matrix inversion to solve the problem. Errors and full covariance matrices are computed by perturbing and then fitting the original best-fit solution a number of times. Dust attenuation is modeled according to either a one or two-parameter mixed-slab dust model of ref. [56].• VErsatile Spectral Analysis (VESPA, [46,55]) is a full spectral fitting code to recover non-parametric star-formation and metallicity histories from optical spectra.

        <p>The mass-weighted stellar metallicity estimated for the various ETG subsamples is shown in figure 3. The various fits show on average a slightly over-solar metallicity, with a value Z/Z ⊙ ∼ 1 -1.5. This result is both expected on a theoretical basis, and confirmed by other independent analysis. On a theoretical basis, for galaxies which have fully exhausted their gas reservoir, having completed their mass assembly at high redshift and being passively evolving since then, a negligible evolution in stellar metallicity is expected. Moreover refs. [26,57,58,59,60] analyzing the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at redshifts 0 &lt; z &lt; 0.3 similarly found a slightly over-solar metallicity for galaxies with masses log(M/M ⊙ ) ∼ 11, and these measurements are confirmed also for galaxies of the same mass at much higher redshifts (z ∼1.5-2 [61,62]).The mass-weighted stellar metallicity estimated for the various ETG subsamples is shown in figure 3.

        <p>While no statistically significant difference is detectable between the best-fits obtained with the different codes, 
            <rs type="software">FIREFLY</rs> presents a slightly larger dispersion, that could be due to the fact that it does not assume, as STARLIGHT, a fixed velocity dispersion. A slight difference is present between BC03 and M11 estimates, with BC03 values preferring a metallicity Z/Z ⊙ ∼ 1.5 while M11 Z/Z ⊙ ∼ 1.25; this difference is due to the intrinsic different input physics and methods in the models, as discussed e.g. in refs. [44,49]. It is important to notice that all best-fits find a negligible metallicity evolution, in agreement with what found from the visual inspection of the median spectra (see figure 2), confirming that galaxies have been evolving little over the redshift range probed.

        <p>To be as conservative as possible, we therefore decided to average the six metallicity estimates obtained with all models and codes, so that the dispersion of the obtained distribution takes all the systematic uncertainties into account. In this way, we obtain a mean value for the stellar metallicity of Z/Z ⊙ = 1.35 ± 0.3. We verified that this estimate is also stable when calculating the median, or restricting the redshift range, being always compatible within the errorbars.To be as conservative as possible, we therefore decided to average the six metallicity estimates obtained with all models and codes, so that the dispersion of the obtained distribution takes all the systematic uncertainties into account.

        <p>Sigma-clipping has been applied to both red and blue D n 4000 bands of the spectrum, to remove contamination of residual night sky emission lines (see figure 9). This method provided results compatible with other approaches, but is more generic and less dependent on various assumptions (see appendix A). The BOSS spectrograph is composed of two separate instruments, a red and a a blue arm, connected at λ ∼ 6000 Å. Any mis-calibration would impact the D n 4000 feature at z ∼ 0.5 -0.6. Indeed a strong contamination (not clearly evident by visual inspection, but well detectable in the median relations) persists in all subsamples in the form of a wiggle of the D n 4000-z relations at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 0.65. For this reason we decided to restrict our analysis to z &lt; 0.5 (see figure 10 in the Appendix). A more detailed discussion can be found in appendix B. The median D n 4000-z relations are shown in the upper panel of figure 5. These relations show a clear pattern, where more massive galaxies present a larger break, confirming what was found in the analysis of ref. [32]. This result can be interpreted in terms of redshift of formation, in particular for the three bins with the higher velocity dispersions where a smaller difference in metallicity is noticeable. For these samples it can be inferred that more massive galaxies are older and have formed their stellar mass at higher redshifts with respect to less massive ones, providing another observational confirmation to the mass-downsizing scenario [25,26,64,65,66].Sigma-clipping has been applied to both red and blue D n 4000 bands of the spectrum, to remove contamination of residual night sky emission lines (see figure 9).

In particular, for each EPS model three metallicities (sub-solar, solar and over-solar) and four different SFHs (characteristic of the selected passive population, i.e. a delayed exponentially declining SFH has been chosen, with τ = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 Gyr) are considered, and, at fixed metallicity, the slope of the D n 4000-age relation is obtained by averaging the values obtained for the various SFHs. The dispersion between the different SFHs has been taken into account as the associated error to A(SF H, Z/Z ⊙ ); then, the obtained values are interpolated to obtain the correct A(SF H, Z/Z ⊙ ) parameter at the metallicity of the sample.We estimated the quantity A(SF H, Z/Z ⊙ ) of eq. 2.2 following the approach discussed in ref.

The upper panels show the D n 4000-age relations at different metallicities and SFHs for both M11 and BC03 models. As it is evident from the bottom panels of the upper plots, in both D n 4000 ranges the linear fit to the data represent a very good approximation, with Spearman correlation coefficients always above 0.97, and on average of r = 0.995 ± 0.002 in the lower D n 4000 range and r = 0.9985±0.0003 in the higher D n 4000 range for M11, and of r = 0.989 ± 0.003 and r = 0.9987 ± 0.0004 for BC03, respectively in the lower and higher D n 4000 range. The lower panels of Fig. 4 show the factor A(SF H, Z/Z ⊙ ) as a function of the metallicity, and the interpolation performed. Green and blue shaded area represent the total uncertainty on A(SF H, Z/Z ⊙ ) (given the metallicity range as measured from our sample, see Sect. 4.1), and the contribution due to SFH alone. It is clear that the dominant systematic is at the moment due to our uncertainty on stellar metallicity, which contributes to ∼80% of the systematic error budget in M11, and to ∼75-85% in BC03, depending on the D n 4000 range.

To keep under control the systematic uncertainties, we performed the analysis separately with two different EPS models, BC03 and M11, and then compared the results. The method to estimate A(SF H, Z/Z ⊙ ) has been discussed in section 4.2. The stellar metallicity has been taken from the analysis presented in section 4.1, Z/Z ⊙ = 1.35 ± 0.3.

We have chosen N = 4 as a trade-off to minimize the statistical scatter of the data over the intrinsic D n 4000 evolution with redshift, simultaneously maximizing the redshift sampling of H(z). We therefore consider a redshift interval ∆z = 0.1, which corresponds to a difference in cosmic time ∼ 0.7 Gyr at z ∼ 0.45. We checked that different choices of N (provided not to be dominated by the statistical scatter of the data) do not affect the results.We estimated the Hubble parameter H(z) from eq. 2.2.

        <p>Analyzing Tab. 3, it is clear that, with the exceptional statistics provided by the BOSS data, systematics are now dominating over statistical errors.

        <p>The transition redshift can be also constrained without any further assumption from the function f (z) = H(z)/(1 + z) = ȧ, that directly maps the acceleration of the Universe. This function has a positive slope when the Universe is accelerating, and a negative slope when it is decelerating. The deceleration parameter q is related to f (z) by q = -H(z)/f (z). Our measurements are crucial to provide the first cosmology-independent determination of the redshift of transition between decelerated and accelerated expansion, z t , at high statistical significance. Combining them with literature data as presented in Tab. 4 and adopting the most recent local distance ladder measurement of the Hubble constant H 0 [69,70,71], which is also independent of any cosmology-based constraint, we obtain 31 H(z)/(1 + z) measurements (see figure 8). We fit these data with a piecewise linear function composed of two intervals (one for acceleration and one for deceleration), which is the simplest functional form parameterizing a change in the slope of H(z)/(1 + z) without assuming any model. The transition redshift between the two regimes is a free parameter, together with the slope of the two lines and the overall amplitude. We use a standard χ 2 approach, and, marginalizing over all other parameters, we find a transition redshift of z t = 0.4 ± 0.1 at the 68% confidence level, as shown in figure 8. We have also explored fitting with other functional forms like a parabola and a spline; however, the piecewise function provides the best χ 2 and the transition redshift does not change within the 68% confidence limit.The transition redshift can be also constrained without any further assumption from the function f (z) = H(z)/(1 + z) = ȧ, that directly maps the acceleration of the Universe.

        <p>We have shown that the choice of stellar population models does not affect the derived H(z) value and that differences are always smaller than 1σ. However, this small systematic shift might have a larger impact in computing the transition redshift, as it is, effectively, a derivative of H(z). In our data-set only 15 H(z) measurements are derived with M11 models. For this sub-set, following the same approach described in section 5.1, we find z t = 0.75±0.15 (we note, however, that at 95% confidence level the constraints degrade considerably because of the reduced number of points, giving 0.1 &lt; z t &lt; 2). As a further test, we also explored the full BC03 dataset, but using instead M11 H(z) measurements where available. This could be thought as an extreme example of systematic impact, as one should use just a given EPS model where the homogeneity of the EPS model ensures that these differences cancel out when estimating the derivative. In this case, we find z t = 0.75 ± 0.15 and 0.25 &lt; z t &lt; 1.0 at 95% confidence. This is perfectly consistent with our BC03 determination, but with a larger errorbar at higher redshifts. When using Bayesian evidence to analyze the significance of excluding the hypothesis of no transition redshift with this latest data-set, which combines estimates from different EPS models, we find a substantial-strong evidence in agreement with our general analysis.

This is the first time that the epoch of cosmic re-acceleration has been observed in a cosmological model-independent way.• The new data from SDSS-III/BOSS allow us to implement also an independent fit to the function H(z)/(1 + z), which directly probes the acceleration of the Universe, using a functional form without any further cosmological assumption. In this way, we obtain the constraint z t = 0.4±0.1.

        <p>This work has shown the potential of the cosmic chronometers approach to set cosmologyindependent constraints on the Hubble parameter H(z). This technique can be considered as a complementary tool with respect to more standard ones (e.g. BAO, SNe) to set constraints on cosmological models, and to keep the systematic affecting each probe under control. While it has been demonstrated that in many cases the constraining power of this method is comparable with the power of classical approaches, we also note that at the present status the measurements are systematic-dominated. Looking towards the future, on one hand we foresee that an improvement in the measurement of metallicity of passive galaxies will represent a decisive step to minimize systematics, and significantly reduce errorbars; on the other hand, it will be crucial to improve the samples at z &gt; 0.5, in order to maximize the accuracy of the measurements over a larger redshift range. From this point of view, future missions like Euclid [81], WFIRST [82], DESI [83] and LSST [84] will represent an ideal starting point at these high redshifts.This work has shown the potential of the cosmic chronometers approach to set cosmologyindependent constraints on the Hubble parameter H(z).

        <p>In future papers, we plan to explore the capability of these new data, in combination with Planck (2015) measurements, to set constraints on parameters in different cosmological scenarios, focusing on the additional constraining power provided by cosmic chronometers data, and to take advantage of the high-quality stacked spectra obtained in this analysis to set evolutionary constraints on the properties of passive galaxies.In future papers, we plan to explore the capability of these new data, in combination with Planck (2015) measurements, to set constraints on parameters in different cosmological scenarios, focusing on the additional constraining power provided by cosmic chronometers data, and to take advantage of the high-quality stacked spectra obtained in this analysis to set evolutionary constraints on the properties of passive galaxies.</p>

        <p>Night sky line residuals can be important source of noise in (BOSS) spectra. As discussed here and within the BOSS collaboration 2 , the lines at 5577 Å, 6300 Å, and 6363 Å in particular may leave significant spikes in the spectra, and bias the measurement of the break if they happen to be in D n 4000 red or blue band. Together with the previous lines, we identify in sky spectra five additional lines with significant residuals at 5892 Å, 5917 Å, 5934 Å and 5955 Å, as shown in figure 9. These residuals bias the measurement of D n 4000, leaving an imprint in the median D n 4000-z relation in the form of wiggles (particularly at z ∼ 0.4) that depart from the expected theoretical behavior, as can be seen in the left plot of figure 10. To overcome this issue, we applied a sigma-clipping procedure to the observed spectra in the and after (filled points, solid lines) the sigma clipping correction; the correction is in particular effective around z ∼ 0.4, where the 5577 Å line enters the D n 4000 range. As in figure 5, dashed lines show D n 4000 from models. In the right plot are presented the throughput curves for the red and blue arms of BOSS spectrograph ( [53], see also http://www.sdss.org/dr12/algorithms/spectrophotometry/) as a function of observed wavelength. The shaded regions with the same colors highlight the left and right bands where D n 4000 is calculated, at three different redshifts (z = 0.5 in red, z = 0.58 in green, adn z = 0.65 in blue) around which the wiggle in the median D n 4000-z relations is observed, showing that at these redshifts the D n 4000 transits from the blue to the red arm of the spectrograph. red and blue bands of D n 4000, removing pixels with a &gt; 4σ difference from the mean. This helps in particular to remove the wiggle at z ∼ 0.4, where the strong 5577 Å line falls in the D n 4000 range.Night sky line residuals can be important source of noise in (BOSS) spectra.

        <p>We also explored different methods to clean the spectra from the residuals of the sky emission lines, namely cutting the contaminated pixels, and weighting the pixels with their variance. Each method gave similar results to the one obtained with the sigma clipping approach, being however more dependent on various assumptions (such as how many pixels to cut, how to treat the removed regions, and how to properly weight the pixels). We therefore decide to adopt the first method, and applied it to the data.We also explored different methods to clean the spectra from the residuals of the sky emission lines, namely cutting the contaminated pixels, and weighting the pixels with their variance.

        <p>The BOSS spectra are obtained with two separate instruments, a blue arm and a red arm, with an overlapping region around ∼6000 Å, as shown in the right plot of figure 10. This observed range falls exactly in the D n 4000 range, once redshifted at z ∼ 0.5, and in particular we notice a correlation between the descending and ascending trend of the wiggle (described in Appendix A) and the D n 4000 being measured on the blue arm, in the red arm, or in between (see right plot of figure 10). This correlation suggests a possible sub-optimal calibration between the two spectrographs, that results in the observed wiggle in the median D n 4000-z relation. Even if this wiggle is actually small, of the order of ∆D n 4000 ∼ 0.05, it significantly affects the H(z) measurement, that critically depends on the differential dD n 4000. In order to avoid biasing our measurements, we therefore decided to restrict our analysis to z &lt; 0.5.The BOSS spectra are obtained with two separate instruments, a blue arm and a red arm, with an overlapping region around ∼6000 Å, as shown in the right plot of figure 10.
