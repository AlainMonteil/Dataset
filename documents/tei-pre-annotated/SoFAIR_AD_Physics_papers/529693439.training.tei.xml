        <p>We report the discovery of the closest known black hole candidate as a binary companion to V723 Mon. V723 Mon is a nearby (d ∼ 460 pc), bright (V 8.3 mag), evolved (T eff, giant 4440 K, and L giant 173 L ) red giant in a high mass function, f(M) = 1.72 ± 0.01 M , nearly circular binary (P = 59.9 d, e 0). V723 Mon is a known variable star, previously classified as an eclipsing binary, but its All-Sky Automated Survey, Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope, and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite light curves are those of a nearly edge-on ellipsoidal variable. Detailed models of the light curves constrained by the period, radial velocities, and stellar temperature give an inclination of 87.0 • +1.7 • -1.4 • , a mass ratio of q 0.33 ± 0.02, a companion mass of M comp = 3.04 ± 0.06 M , a stellar radius of R giant = 24.9 ± 0.7 R , and a giant mass of M giant = 1.00 ± 0.07 M . We identify a likely non-stellar, diffuse veiling component with contributions in the B and V band of ∼63 per cent and ∼24 per cent, respectively. The SED and the absence of continuum eclipses imply that the companion mass must be dominated by a compact object. We do observe eclipses of the Balmer lines when the dark companion passes behind the giant, but their velocity spreads are low compared to observed accretion discs. The X-ray luminosity of the system is L X 7.6 × 10 29 ergs s -1 , corresponding to L/L edd ∼ 10 -9 . The simplest explanation for the massive companion is a single compact object, most likely a black hole in the 'mass gap'.We report the discovery of the closest known black hole candidate as a binary companion to V723 Mon.

        <p>Other claims for non-interacting BH systems have been ruled out. For example, LB-1, which was initially thought to host an extremely massive stellar BH (M BH 68 +11 -3 M , Liu et al. 2019), was later found to have a much less massive companion that was not necessarily a compact object (see e.g. Abdul-Masih et al. 2020;El-Badry &amp; Quataert 2020;Irrgang et al. 2020;Shenar et al. 2020). Similarly, the naked-eye star HR 6819 was claimed to be a triple system with a detached BH with M BH = 6.3 ± 0.7 M (Rivinius et al. 2020), but was later argued to contain a binary system with a rapidly rotating Be star and a slowly rotating B star (Bodensteiner et al. 2020;El-Badry &amp; Quataert 2021).Other claims for non-interacting BH systems have been ruled out.

        <p>Here, we discuss our discovery that the bright red giant V723 Mon has a dark, massive companion that is a good candidate for the closest known BH. We discuss the current classification of this system in Section 2, and describe the archival data and new observations used in our analysis in Section 3. In Section 4, we analyse photometric and spectroscopic observations to derive the parameters of the binary system and the red giant secondary. In Section 5, we discuss the nature of the dark companion. We present a summary of our results in Section 6.Here, we discuss our discovery that the bright red giant V723 Mon has a dark, massive companion that is a good candidate for the closest known BH.

        <p>V723 Mon (HD 45762, SAO 133321, TIC 43077836) is a luminous (m V 8.3) red-giant1 in the Monoceros constellation with J2000 coordinates (α, δ) = (97.269410 • , -5.572286 • ). It was classified as a likely long period variable in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars (GCVS; Kazarovets et al. 1999) after it was identified as a variable source in the Hipparcos catalogue with period P = 29.97 d (ESA 1997). Subsequently, the All-Sky Automated Survey (ASAS; Pojmanski 1997Pojmanski , 2002) ) classified it as a contact/semidetached binary with P = 59.87 d. The Variable Star Index (VSX; Watson, Henden &amp; Price 2006) presently lists it as an eclipsing binary of the β-Lyrae type (EB) with P = 59.93 d.V723 Mon (HD 45762, SAO 133321, TIC 43077836) is a luminous (m V 8.3) red-giant1 in the Monoceros constellation with J2000 coordinates (α, δ) = (97.269410 • , -5.572286 • ).

        <p>V723 Mon has a well determined spectroscopic orbit and is included in the the Ninth Catalogue of Spectroscopic Binary Orbits (Pourbaix et al. 2004). In particular, Griffin (2010) identified V723 Mon as a single-lined spectroscopic binary (SB1) with a nearly circular P ∼ 60 d orbit. Strassmeier et al. (2012;hereafter S12) refined the orbit to P orb = 59.9363 ± 0.0016 d and e orb 0.0150 ± 0.0009 using a large number of high precision RV measurements from STELLA (Weber et al. 2008). S12 also argue that this is the outer orbit of a triple system, and that the more massive (inner) component is an SB1 consisting of another giant star and an unseen companion with a period P inner P outer /3. Griffin (2014;hereafter G14) was unable to find a spectral feature indicative of a second companion in their crosscorrelation functions. G14 discusses several peculiarities in the S12 RV solution. In particular, the radial velocity (RV) curve associated with the second component is unusual in structure compared to any other system characterized by S12 and a triple system with this period ratio would almost certainly be dynamically unstable.V723 Mon has a well determined spectroscopic orbit and is included in the the Ninth Catalogue of Spectroscopic Binary Orbits (Pourbaix et al. 2004).

        <p>If the observed giant has a mass of M giant ∼ 1 M , the mass function implies a massive companion with a minimum mass of M comp ∼ 3 M . Since the observed light is clearly dominated by the giant and the companion has to be both much less luminous and significantly more massive than the giant, V723 Mon is a prime candidate for a non-interacting, compact object binary. This realization led us to investigate V723 Mon in detail as part of a larger project to identify non-interacting, compact object binaries.If the observed giant has a mass of M giant ∼ 1 M , the mass function implies a massive companion with a minimum mass of M comp ∼ 3 M .

        <p>In Gaia EDR3 (Gaia Collaboration 2020), V723 Mon is source id = 3104145904761393408. Its EDR3 parallax of EDR3 = 2.175 ± 0.033 mas implies a distance of d = 1/ = 460 ± 7 pc. This is little changed from its Gaia DR2 parallax of DR2 = 1.9130 ± 0.0563 mas. At these distances, there is little difference between d = 1/ = 519 ± 15 pc (for DR2) and the more careful estimate of d = 515.6 +15.6 -14.6 pc by Bailer-Jones et al. (2018). The astrometric solution has significant excess noise of = 0.22 mas, which is not surprising given that the motion of the giant should be ∼0.8 mas. However, its renormalized unit weight error of 1.39, while larger than unity, is not indicative of problems in the parallax. We adopt a distance of d = 460 pc for the remainder of the paper. The distance uncertainties are unimportant for our analysis.In Gaia EDR3 (Gaia Collaboration 2020), V723 Mon is source id = 3104145904761393408.

        <p>V723 Mon has Galactic coordinates (l, b) (215.372 • , -7.502 • ), close to the Galactic disc, but away from the Galactic centre. At the EDR3 distance, V723 Mon is ∼32 pc below the midplane. Its proper motion in EDR3 is μ α = -1.347 ± 0.032 mas yr -1 , and μ δ = 16.140 ± 0.031 mas yr -1 . Combining this with the systemic RV from Section 4.2 and the definition of the local standard of rest (LSR) from Schönrich, Binney &amp; Dehnen (2010), the 3D space motion of V723 Mon relative to the LSR as (U, V , W ) LSR = (-10.8 ± 4.3, 36.9 ± 5.3, 20.1 ± 3.4) km s -1 using 
            <rs type="software">BANYAN</rs> (Gagné et al. 2018) for the calculations. We calculated the thin disc, thick disc, and halo membership probabilities based on the UVW velocities following Ramírez, Allende Prieto &amp; Lambert (2013) to obtain P (thin) 97 per cent, P (thick) 3 per cent, and P (halo) 0 per cent, respectively. This suggests that this system is a kinematically normal object in the thin disc.

        <p>The difference between the ASAS and KELT photometric period estimates is not statistically significant. V723 Mon (TIC 43077836) was observed by TESS (Ricker et al. 2015) in Sector 6, and the 27 d of observations correspond to [0.46, 0.82] in orbital phase where the phase of the RV maximum is 0.75. V723 Mon was also observed in Sector 33, with the observations spanning [0.94, 0.36] in orbital phase. We analysed the TESS data using the adaptation of the ASAS-SN image subtraction pipeline for analyzing TESS full-frame images described in Vallely et al. (2021). While this pipeline produces precise differential flux light curves, the large pixel scale of TESS makes it difficult to obtain reliable measurements of the reference flux of a given source. We normalized the light curve to have the reference TESS-band magnitude of 7.26 in the TESS Input Catalogue (Stassun et al. 2019). Conveniently, the mean of the Sector 6 observations is approximately the mean for a full orbital cycle (see Fig. 5). We use a zero-point of 20.44 electrons (TESS Instrument Handbook3 ). The light curve does not include epochs where the observations were compromised by the spacecraft's momentum dump maneuvers.The difference between the ASAS and KELT photometric period estimates is not statistically significant.

        <p>We obtained BVR c I c light curves at the ROAD (Hambsch 2012). All observations were acquired through Astrodon Photometric filters with an Orion Optics, UK Optimized Dall Kirkham 406/6.8 telescope and a FLI 16803 CCD camera. Twilight sky-flat images were used for flat-field corrections. Reductions were performed with the 
            <rs type="software">MAXIM DL</rs> program,4 and the photometry was carried out using the 
            <rs type="software">LesvePhotometry</rs> program. 5We obtained Swift UVOT (Roming et al. 2005) images in the UVM2 (2246 Å) band (Poole et al. 2008) through the Target of Opportunity (ToO) program (Target ID number 13777). We only obtained images in the UVM2 band because the Swift UVW1 and UVW2 filters have significant red leaks that make them unusable in the presence of the emission from the cool giant, and the star is too bright to obtain images in the optical UVOT filters. Each epoch of UVOT data includes multiple observations per filter, which we combined using the 
            <rs type="software">uvotimsum</rs> package. We then used uvotsource to extract source counts using a 5. 0 radius aperture centred on the star. We measured the background counts using a source-free region with radius of 40. 0 and used the most recent calibrations (Poole et al. 2008;Breeveld et al. 2010) and taking into account the recently released update to the sensitivity correction for the Swift UV filters. 6 The Swift UVM2 observations are summarized in Table 6. We report the median and standard deviation of these UVM2 observations in Table 1.

We used the 100 μm fiber and six crossdispersers (CD). The data were processed as described in Strassmeier, Ilyin &amp; Steffen (2018). The total integration time was 90 min, and the combined spectrum covers the entire wavelength range accessible to . The spectrum has a signal-to-noise ratio Pogge et al. 2010), we obtained a series of spectra from 2020 November 18 to 22 as the dark companion moved into eclipse behind the observed giant. Exposure times were typically 15 s, but this was extended to 24 s for the November 22 observation to compensate for clouds. We used a 2. 4 wide slit to ensure that all the light was captured. We reduced these observations using a standard combination of the

            <rs type="software">modsidl pipeline</rs>. 9 The blue and red channels of both spectrographs were reduced independently, and the final MODS spectrum for each night was obtained by averaging the MODS1 and MODS2 spectra. The best weather conditions during this observing run occurred on Nov 20. The HIRES, PEPSI, and MODS observations are summarized in Table 8.

        <p>We analysed X-ray observations from the Swift X-Ray Telescope (XRT; Burrows et al. 2005) and XMM-Newton (Jansen et al. 2001). The XRT data were taken simultaneously with the UVM2 observations, with individual exposure times of 160 to 1015 seconds. Additionally, two longer ∼5 ks XRT exposures were taken on 2021-01-21 (φ 0.5) and 2021-02-20 (φ 0). In total, V723 Mon was observed with Swift XRT for 19865 s. All XRT observations were reprocessed using the Swift XRTPIPELINE version 0.13.2 and standard filter and screening criteria 10 and the most up-to-date calibration files. To increase the signal to noise of our observations, we combined all cleaned individual XRT observations using

            <rs type="version">2.4g</rs>. To place constraints on the presence of X-ray emission, we used a source region with a radius of 30 arcsec centred on the position of V723 Mon and a source-free background region with a radius of 150 arcsec located at RA = 06:28:53.1, Dec. = -05:38:49.6 (J2000). We also retrieved archival XMM-Newton data obtained during a ∼10 ks observation of the nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxy IRAS 06269-0543 (Observation ID 0153100601; PI: N. Anabuki). However, V723 Mon is ∼12 arcmin off-axis in these observations, resulting in a non-optimal PSF with a 90 per cent enclosed energy radius of ∼1 arcmin. We reduced the data using the

        <p>Here, we present our analyses of the observations described in Section 3. In Section 4.1, we characterize the red giant using its spectral energy distribution (SED) and spectra. In Section 4.2, we fit Keplerian models to the radial velocities and derive a spectroscopic orbit for V723 Mon. In Section 4.3, we model the ellipsoidal variations of the red giant using multiband light curves and the binary modelling tools 
            <rs type="software">PHOEBE</rs> and 
            <rs type="software">ELC</rs> to derive the masses of the red giant and the dark companion. We also derive limits on companion eclipse depths. In Section 4.4, we characterize the veiling component in this system. In Section 4.5, we place constraints on luminous stellar companions. In Section 4.6, we characterize the Balmer emission lines and their variability. In Section 4.7, we discuss the X-ray observations.

        <p>We characterized the red giant using both fits to its overall SED and analyses of the available spectra. For the SED, we used photometry from APASS DR10 (Henden et al. 2018), SkyMapper DR2 (Onken et al. 2019), 2MASS (Skrutskie et al. 2006), and 
            <rs type="software">AllWISE</rs> (Wright 1) is treated as an upper limit and the error bars are expanded to give χ 2 /N dof 1. The SEDs for a main-sequence companion of mass 1.29 M , an equal mass binary consisting of two main-sequence stars each with 0.99 M , and a binary with companion masses of 1.25 and 0.77 M are also shown (see Section 4.5). These SEDs closely overlap and are hard to distinguish. As shown by the SED of a single 2.5 M main-sequence star (dashed line), hotter stars are easily ruled out. et al. 2010). We used the Swift UVM2 photometry only as an upper limit (Section 3.5). The compilation of the multiband photometry used in these fits are given in Table 1.

        <p>We fit the SED of V723 Mon using DUSTY (Ivezic &amp; Elitzur 1997;Elitzur &amp; Ivezić 2001) inside an MCMC wrapper (Adams &amp; Kochanek 2015). We assumed foreground extinction due to R V = 3.1 dust (Cardelli, Clayton &amp; Mathis 1989) and used the ATLAS9 Castelli &amp; Kurucz (2003) model atmospheres for the star. We assume that the source is at the Gaia EDR3 distance and used minimum luminosity uncertainties of 19 per cent for each band to obtain χ 2 /N dof 1. The expanded uncertainties needed to reach χ 2 /N dof 1 with respect to the reported photometric errors in each measurement are likely driven using single epoch photometry for a variable source plus any systematic problems in the models and photometry. We used a weak T eff, giant = 4500 ± 500 K prior on the temperature and a prior of E(B -V) = 0.10 ± 0.04 on the extinction from Green et al. (2019). The SED fit yields T eff, giant 4440 ± 90 K, L giant = 173 ± 8 L , R giant 22.2 ± 0.8 R and E(B -V) 0.085 ± 0.034 mag. Fig. 1 shows the SED and the best-fitting model. The SED well constrains the temperature and is consistent with the extinction estimates. If we force the model to have smaller stellar radii, the goodness of fit worsens rapidly, from χ 2 = 13.6 for the best fit to 20.3 for R giant = 20 R and 40.9 for R giant = 18 R . Decreasing the radius forces the star to become hotter (4800 K for 18 R ) to fit the SED at long wavelengths and more extincted to fit it at short wavelengths. Constraints on a stellar companion to the giant from the SED are discussed in Section 4.5.We fit the SED of V723 Mon using DUSTY (Ivezic &amp; Elitzur 1997;Elitzur &amp; Ivezić 2001) inside an MCMC wrapper (Adams &amp; Kochanek 2015).

        <p>The equivalent width (EW) of the Na I D doublet provides an independent estimate of the Galactic reddening towards V723 Mon (see e.g. Poznanski, Prochaska &amp; Bloom 2012). Using the very high resolution PEPSI spectrum, we measure EW(D 1 ) = 125.1 ± 12.0 mÅ and EW(D 2 ) = 85.7 ± 7.5 mÅ. From the EW-E(B -V) calibration in Poznanski et al. (2012), we find that E(B -V) = 0.025 ± 0.005 mag. This is consistent with the low foreground extinction that was derived from the SED models and the Green et al.

        <p>All high-resolution spectra indicate that the giant is rapidly rotating. Strassmeier et al. (2012) derived a projected rotational velocity of v rot sin i = 16 ± 2 km s -1 using the SES spectra. Griffin (2014) found a similar average v rot sin i ∼ 15 km s -1 but noted that the values seemed to depend on the orbital phase and ranged from v rot sin i ∼ 10 km s -1 to v rot sin i ∼ 20 km s -1 . We also find that v rot sin i varies from ∼17.6 to ∼21.7 km s -1 in the SES spectra. The HIRES CPS pipeline (Petigura 2015) reports v rot sin i = 21.6 ± 1.0 km s -1 , and we found v rot sin i = 17.9 ± 0.4 km s -1 from the PEPSI spectrum using iSpec (Blanco-Cuaresma et al. 2014;Blanco-Cuaresma 2019). Assuming that the rotation of the giant is tidally synchronized with the orbit, the SES, PEPSI and HIRES measurements yield stellar radii of R sin i = 19.0 ± 2.4 R , R sin i = 21.2 ± 0.5 R , and R sin i = 25.6 ± 1.2 R , respectively, consistent both with estimates from the SED and the radius derived for the giant from the PHOEBE models (Section 4.3).

        <p>To derive the surface temperature (T eff ), surface gravity [log (g)], and metallicity [(Fe/H)] of the giant, we use the spectral synthesis codes FASMA (Tsantaki et al. 2018;Tsantaki, Andreasen &amp; Teixeira 2020) and iSpec. FASMA generates synthetic spectra based on the ATLAS-APOGEE atmospheres (Kurucz 1993;Mészáros et al. 2012) with 
            <rs type="software">MOOG</rs> (Sneden 1973) and outputs the best-fitting stellar parameters following a χ 2 minimization process. iSpec carries out a similar minimization process with synthetic spectra generated by SPECTRUM (Gray &amp; Corbally 1994) and MARCS model atmospheres (Gustafsson et al. 2008). The line lists used in this process span the wavelength range from 480 to 680 nm. Since we are confident the companion should undergo eclipses (see Section 4.5), we fit the SES spectrum near conjunction (0.48 &lt; ∼ φ &lt; ∼ 0.52) when any companion would be eclipsed by the giant. For the detailed fits, we fix the rotational velocity to the value of v rot sin i = 19.1 ± 0.4 km s -1 found by iSpec for this spectrum.
        </p>
        <p>For the FASMA fits, we initially keep the macroturbulent broadening (v mac ) and the microturbulence (v micro ) fixed at v mac = 5 km s -1 and v mic = 2 km s -1 , but then allow them to be optimized once we have a reasonable fit. This fits yield T eff, giant = 4480 ± 50 K, log (g) = 1.7 ± 0.2, and [Fe/H] = -1.1 ± 0.1. In the iSpec fits, v mic was kept as a free parameter and we obtain similar results with T eff, giant = 4570 ± 60 K, log (g) = 1.7 ± 0.1, [Fe/H] = -0.9 ± 0.1, [α/Fe] = 0.7 ± 0.1, and v micro = 0.6 ± 0.1 km s -1 . We adopt the parameters from iSpec as our standard. Fig. 2 compares a model spectrum generated using the iSpec parameters to the LBT/PEPSI spectrum. The model spectrum is a reasonable fit to the PEPSI data. The spectroscopic parameters derived for the giant are summarized in Table 2. These estimates of the spectroscopic parameters do not consider the effects of veiling on the observed spectrum (see Section 4.4). Veiling introduces systematic uncertainties on these parameters and will lower the temperature estimate for the giant.For the FASMA fits, we initially keep the macroturbulent broadening (v mac ) and the microturbulence (v micro ) fixed at v mac = 5 km s -1 and v mic = 2 km s -1 , but then allow them to be optimized once we have a reasonable fit.

        <p>We fit Keplerian models both independently and jointly to the S12 and G14 radial velocities using the Monte Carlo sampler TheJoker (Price-Whelan et al. 2017). The results for the four fits are summarized in Table 3. We first fit each data set independently as an elliptical orbit to verify that we obtain results consistent with the published results. We then fit the joint data set using either a circular or an elliptical orbit. In the joint fits, we include an additional parameter to allow for any velocity zero-point offsets between the S12 and G14 data. For the circular orbit, we also set the argument of periastron ω = 0. Since the orbit is nearly circular even for the elliptical models, we derived the epoch of maximal RV T RV, max instead of the epoch of periastron. We define phases so that T RV, max (BJD/TDB) corresponds to φ = 0.75, the companion eclipses at φ = 0.5 and the giant would be eclipsed at φ = 0. After doing a first fit for the elliptical models, we did a further fit with P, K, e, γ , and T RV, max fixed to their posterior values and further optimized ω using least-squares minimization.We fit Keplerian models both independently and jointly to the S12 and G14 radial velocities using the Monte Carlo sampler TheJoker (Price-Whelan et al. 2017).

        <p>The results of the fits are summarized in Table 3 and shown in Fig. 3. The fits to the individual data sets agree well with the published results, and the mass functions are well constrained and mutually consistent. The elliptical models all yield a small, nonzero ellipticity, consistent with G14's arguments. We do find a small velocity offset of V = 0.58 ± 0.14 km s -1 for the elliptical model and V = 0.84 ± 0.21 km s -1 for the circular model between the S12 and G14 data. While the velocity residuals of the fits are small compared to K ( 1.7 km s -1 versus 65 km s -1 ), they are large compared to the measurement uncertainties. Thus, while the RV curve is clearly completely dominated by the orbital model, Fig. 3 also shows that there are significant velocity residuals for both joint fits. The circular fit is dominated by a residual of period P orb /2 and the elliptical fit is dominated by a residual of period P orb /3. Fitting an elliptical orbit with a circular orbit will show a dominant P orb /2 residual, but an elliptical orbit should not show a large P orb /3 residual. This P orb /3 residual to the fit of an elliptical orbit is likely the origin of the S12 hypothesis that the companion is an SB1 with this period. The residuals do not, however, resemble those of a Keplerian orbit. We discuss this hypothesis and the velocity residuals in Appendix A.The results of the fits are summarized in Table 3 and shown in Fig. 3.

Griffin (2014) carried out an F-test and noted that the ellipticity in their best-fitting orbit for V723 Mon was significant, and concluded that it was very likely real. While we use the circular orbit for the PHOEBE models in Section 4.3, the differences in the mass function and semimajor axis compared to the elliptical orbit are small and have no effect on our conclusions. Independent of this issue with the origin of the RV residuals, the companion to the red giant in V723 Mon must be very massive given a mass function of 1.72-1.74 M . The mass function itself is greater than the Chandrasekhar mass of ∼1.4 M , immediately ruling out a white dwarf (WD) companion. For an edge on orbit (see Section 4.3) and M giant 1 M , the companion mass is M comp 3 M and the semimajor axis is a 100 R . The Roche limits are approximately R L, giant = 0.29a 30 R for the giant and R L, comp = 0.48a 49 R for the companion. Based on the radius estimate from the SED fits (Section 4.1), the giant is comfortably inside its Roche lobe (R giant /R L, giant 0.66) but in the regime where we should be seeing strong ellipsoidal variability due to the tidal deformation of the giant by the gravity of the companion (e.g. Morris 1985). Any stellar companion also has to be well within its Roche lobe or it would dominate the SED because its Roche lobe is significantly larger. Hence, we can be confident that we have a detached binary whose light is dominated by a giant that should show ellipsoidal variability and might show eclipses.1995; Price-Whelan &amp; Goodman 2018).

The Roche limits are approximately R L, giant = 0.29a 30 R for the giant and R L, comp = 0.48a 49 R for the companion. Based on the radius estimate from the SED fits (Section 4.1), the giant is comfortably inside its Roche lobe (R giant /R L, giant 0.66) but in the regime where we should be seeing strong ellipsoidal variability due to the tidal deformation of the giant by the gravity of the companion (e.g. Morris 1985). Any stellar companion also has to be well within its Roche lobe or it would dominate the SED because its Roche lobe is significantly larger. Hence, we can be confident that we have a detached binary whose light is dominated by a giant that should show ellipsoidal variability and might show eclipses.</p>
        <p>While it has been previously claimed that V723 Mon is a contact/semidetached binary of the β-Lyrae type, we find that this is very unlikely. As we just argued, both the giant and any companion must lie well within their Roche lobes given the properties of the giant and the orbit. Additionally, the morphology of the light curve is inconsistent with those of detached and most semidetached eclipsing binaries. Here, we interpret the light curves as ellipsoidal variability and deduce limits on any eclipses of the companion for use in Section 4.5.While it has been previously claimed that V723 Mon is a contact/semidetached binary of the β-Lyrae type, we find that this is very unlikely.

Since the companion appears to be dark and producing no eclipses, we fix it to be a small (R = 3 × 10 -6 R ), cold (T eff = 300 K) blackbody, use the simplest and fastest eclipse model (eclipse method = only horizon) and do not include the effects of irradiation and reflection. We adopt the joint-circular RV solution from Table 3 (period, e = 0, systemic velocity, semimajor axis, and argument of periastron ω = 0). We set the bolometric gravity darkening coefficient as β = 0.54, comparable to those obtained by Claret &amp; Bloemen (2011) in the R band for stars with T eff ∼ 4600 K, -1 [Fe/H] -0.5, and 0 ࣠ log (g) ࣠ 2.

We fit for the binary mass ratio q = M giant /M comp , orbital inclination (i), the radius (R giant ) and the effective temperature of the giant (T eff, giant ). We marginalize over the semimajor axis of the red giant (a giant sin i), the passband luminosities and nuisance parameters that account for underestimated errors in the KELT R K -band and TESS T-band light curves. We adopt Gaussian priors on the effective temperature (T eff, giant = 4440 ± 90 K) and the radius (R giant = 22.2 ± 0.8 R ) based on the SED fits in Section 4.1. We adopt uniform priors of [70 • , 90 • ] and [0, 1] for the orbital inclination and mass ratio, respectively.

The reported errors are purely statistical and do not consider systematic effects (veiling, etc.) in the derivation of the binary solution. However, our results in Section 4.4 indicate that the veiling in the KELT and TESS light curves is minimal and should not significantly bias the mass estimates. In the absence of evidence for a stellar companion in the SED, spectra, or in eclipse, perhaps the simplest explanation for the mass of the companion (M comp 3.04 ± 0.06 M ) is that it is a non-interacting BH in the 'mass-gap' between 3 and 5 M ( Özel et al. 2010;Farr et al. 2011).

        <p>Given the configuration of the binary and the large size of the giant (∼25 R ), a companion with a radius of 1 R should be eclipsed for inclination angles i 76 • . Fig. 6 shows the eclipses predicted for the ASAS, KELT, and TESS light curves for main-sequence stars with masses of 1, 1.5, and 2 M . Any such stars would have produced relatively easy to detect eclipses. We will focus on the KELT limits because these data have higher S/N compared to ASAS photometry, and TESS only observed the eclipse of the red giant and not of the companion. At the expected phase of the eclipse, the RMS of the KELT data relative to the eclipse-free ellipsoidal (ELL) model is only 0.84 per cent for phases from 0.46 to 0.54. If we bin the data 0.01 in phase, the RMS of the binned data is only 0.38 per cent. We will adopt a very conservative KELT band eclipse limit of 1 per cent. Similarly, based on the Swift, ASAS, and ROAD light curves, we will adopt eclipse limits of 10 per cent, 3 per cent, and 2 per cent for the UVM2, B and V bands, respectively. The Swift UVM2 light curve is shown in Fig. 7. The UVM2 light curve appears somewhat variable, with one larger outlier on UT 2020-11-13 (φ 0.35).

        <p>After the KELT R K -band and TESS T-band light curves were jointly fit, we compared the resulting model V-band light curve to the ASAS observations, and found that the observed V-band variability amplitude was smaller than predicted by our model. Lower amplitudes at (usually) bluer wavelengths are generally attributed to an additional source of diluting ('second') light. For X-ray binaries, it is also known as 'disc veiling' due to additional light from accretion (e.g. Hynes, Robinson &amp; Bitner 2005;Wu et al. 2015). The amount of additional flux is usually characterized either by the ratio r of the veiling flux to the stellar flux or the veiling flux as a fraction of the total flux f = r/(1 + r).

        <p>We fixed the system parameters to those from the joint fit to the KELT + TESS light curves and fit for additional flux (second light) in the V band. The fit to the ASAS V-band light curve is consistent with an additional V-band flux (F 2 ) amounting to f second,V = F 2 /(F 2 + F giant ) = 24 ± 2 per cent. Fig. 5 shows the PHOEBE model fit for the V-band after accounting for this additional flux. The redder ROAD R c and I c light curves agree well with the PHOEBE model without additional flux. The ROAD observations also agree with the PHOEBE model for the V band with the additional flux (f second,V = 24 ± 2 per cent) added. The discrepancy between the B-band light curve and a model without extra flux is even larger than for the V band. Fitting the B-band data requires a larger second light contribution of f second,B = 63 ± 2 per cent. The colour of the extra light B -V = -0.2 ± 0.1 is very blue even before applying any extinction corrections. This corresponds to stars with T eff ranging from ∼13 000 to ∼30 000 K (Papaj, Krelowski &amp; Wegner 1993). However, no hot star could have a rapidly rising SED from V to B and then drop rapidly from B to the UVM2-band. Stellar SEDs are intrinsically broader in wavelength, like the model in Fig. 1.

        <p>Fig. 8 shows that the fractional veiling and second light as a function of wavelength r(λ) rises steeply towards bluer wavelengths, with a power-law (λ α ) index of α -5.0 ± 1.5, steeper than that expected from the Rayleigh-Jeans law (α = -4). These results also indicate minimal contamination in the KELT R K and TESS T filters that are used for our primary fits to the ellipsoidal variations. As a precaution, we ran PHOEBE models adding 10-20 per cent extra flux in the KELT R K band, and found that the masses of the red giant and dark companion are comparable to those obtained without considering veiling given the error estimates. The fractional second light in the V band from the PHOEBE fits is comparable to that derived from the line veiling estimates. The PHOEBE estimate of the second light in the B band is somewhat larger than that seen in the line veiling, however, both estimates indicate a large contribution to the B-band flux. Based on the lack of eclipses in the light curves (see Section 4.5), we can also infer that this emission component has to be diffuse.Fig. 8 shows that the fractional veiling and second light as a function of wavelength r(λ) rises steeply towards bluer wavelengths, with a power-law (λ α ) index of α -5.0 ± 1.5, steeper than that expected from the Rayleigh-Jeans law (α = -4).

The best model of the veiled SED has χ 2 = 14.2, rising to 33.9 for R giant = 20 R and to 64.0 for R giant = 18 R .1, and v micro = 0.8 ± 0.1 km s -1 .

        <p>The origin of this veiling component remains unclear, although it is clearly non-stellar in nature. However, the morphology of the veiling component is broadly compatible with the spectra of advection dominated accretion flows (ADAF). ADAF spectra can be described by contributions due to synchrotron emission, Compton scattering and Bremsstrahlung radiation (Quataert &amp; Narayan 1999). The most luminous feature in the ADAF models come from the synchrotron peak and for stellar mass BHs, this peak falls in the optical wavelengths (Quataert &amp; Narayan 1999). In their ADAF models for quiescent BH binaries (M BH = 6 M ) with low accretion rates (log( Ṁ/ Ṁedd ) ∼ -4), Esin, McClintock &amp; Narayan (1997) show that the SED peaks at optical wavelengths and rapidly decays at both longer and shorter wavelengths. For V723 Mon, detailed ADAF models are necessary to determine whether the veiling component is related to accretion flows around the dark companion, but such analysis is beyond the scope of this paper.The origin of this veiling component remains unclear, although it is clearly non-stellar in nature.

        <p>We can constrain the presence of luminous companions using either the SED or the absence of eclipses. The limits using only the SED will be weaker than those using the eclipses, but are also independent of any knowledge of the inclination. For the SED constraints, we require that the companion contributes less than 100 per cent, 60 per cent, and 20 per cent of the light in the UVM2, B, and V bands, respectively. The B-and V-band limits correspond to the estimated veiling source from Section 4.4 and are conservative since the SED of the veiling light appears to be inconsistent with a star, and the UVM2 band limit is simply the total observed flux because we lack any constraint on the amount of veiling for this band. For the eclipse constraints, we require that the companion contributes less than 10 per cent, 3 per cent, 2 per cent, and 1 per cent in the UVM2, B, V, and R bands based on the eclipse models in Section 4.3. While we did not use the UVM2 band in the SED fits because the SED models cannot account for any possible chromospheric emission from the rapidly rotating giant, there is no issue with using them to obtain these limits.We can constrain the presence of luminous companions using either the SED or the absence of eclipses.

        <p>To provide models for the relationships between luminosity, temperature and mass, we sampled stars from [Fe/H] = -1 PARSEC (Bressan et al. 2012) isochrones with ages from 1 to 10 Gyr, and we logarithmically interpolated along each isochrone to sample more densely in mass. We considered models in which the companion is either a single star or two stars. In the latter case, we considered all Figure 10. Limits on the mass of a companion that is comprised of either one (black) or two (red) luminous stars based on either the lack of KELT eclipses (solid) or the SED (dashed) as a function of the age of the stars. From these limits, the maximum allowed mass for a single star is 1.29 M (SED) and 0.80 M (eclipses). For two stars, the maximum allowed mass is 1.98 M (SED) and 1.51 M (eclipses). combinations of two stars on the same isochrone. The age of the stars is the principal variable leading to changes in the mass limits, but the differences are not large. Two star models will generically allow higher limiting masses for two reasons. First, since luminosity is a steeply rising function of mass, dividing a single star into two lower mass stars of the same total mass leads to a lower total luminosity. Secondly, the two lower mass stars are also cooler on the main sequence, so they produce less blue light per unit luminosity than the single star, which also allows the total mass be larger for the same constraints on the bluer fluxes.To provide models for the relationships between luminosity, temperature and mass, we sampled stars from [Fe/H] = -1 PARSEC (Bressan et al. 2012) isochrones with ages from 1 to 10 Gyr, and we logarithmically interpolated along each isochrone to sample more densely in mass.

        <p>We start with the weaker but inclination independent limits from the SED, where Fig. 10 shows the mass limits as a function of stellar age. For a single star, the maximum allowed mass is 1.29 M (log(age) = 9.49, L = 15.5 L , T = 5430 K), and it occurs where the star is just starting to evolve off the main sequence because the initial drop in temperature weakens the constraints more than the rise in luminosity (see Fig. 1). There are two maximum masses for models with two stars. The lower age peak corresponds to pairing a slightly evolved star with a lower mass main-sequence star. The total mass of 1.98 M comes from combining a 1.25 M (L = 12.0 L , T = 5510 K) star with a 0.77 M (L = 0.5 L , T = 5900 K) star at log(age) = 9.45. The higher age peak comes from combining two stars of the same mass. The total mass is again 1.98 M and the two components each have M = 0.99 M (log(age) = 9.80, L = 8.5 L , T = 5430 K). Fig. 1 shows the SEDs of these three models as compared to that of the giant, and they are nearly identical.We start with the weaker but inclination independent limits from the SED, where Fig. 10 shows the mass limits as a function of stellar age.

        <p>For the BH candidates LB1 and HR 6819, the stellar companions seemed 'dark' because they were hot. This cannot be the case here because of the tight UVM2 luminosity limit of λL λ ≈ 2 L (after correcting for extinction). Models normalized by this luminosity only have total luminosities of 4, 5, and 75 L , for temperatures of 10 4 , 3 × 10 4 , and 10 5 K, respectively, much too low for a massive He star companion. For example, a Helium star with T ∼ 10 5 K will have M ∼ 8 M and L ∼ 90 000 L (Gräfener, Owocki &amp; Vink 2012). For any hot companion with a luminosity approaching that of the giant, we would also expect to see the effects of irradiation of the giant on its light curve and phase dependent spectra, but no such perturbations are seen.For the BH candidates LB1 and HR 6819, the stellar companions seemed 'dark' because they were hot.

        <p>Given the size of the orbit and the size of the giant, companions with radii similar to those allowed by the SED will be eclipsed provided the inclination angle is i 76 • . While the systematic uncertainties on the estimated inclination of 87.0 • +1.7 • -1.4 • may be moderately larger, the light-curve shapes at inclinations anywhere approaching this upper limit for seeing eclipses are grossly incompatible with the observations. Fig. 10 also shows the limits on masses using the flux limits on the companion required to avoid visible eclipses, and they are stronger than those from the SED as expected. The biggest change is that they eliminate the 'bumps' associated with stars starting to move off the main sequence because they more directly constrain the size of any companion. The improvements are otherwise modest because the (blue) luminosities are such strong functions of mass that moderate changes in the limits on the luminosity produce very modest changes in the limits on the mass. The single star limit is now 0.80 M and the two star limit is 1.51 M where the two star limit is always weakest for the stars being twins. These limits are smaller than the binary mass function for this system (see Section 4.2).Given the size of the orbit and the size of the giant, companions with radii similar to those allowed by the SED will be eclipsed provided the inclination angle is i 76 • .

        <p>We find that the Balmer H α and Hβ lines appear to significantly vary with phase (Fig. 11) and this is unusual for a red giant. Given our phase convention, the dark companion will be eclipsed by the giant at φ = 0.50 with an eclipse duration of t ecl 5 d. If a companion is responsible for Balmer emission, the subtraction of a template spectrum near phase φ = 0.50 should isolate its contribution. To explore this, we subtracted the SES spectrum of the red giant near φ 0.5 from the remaining spectra with S/N &gt; 30. Fig. 11 shows the changes in the H α, H β, Ca I λ6439, and Ca I λ6463 lines with orbital phase. The left-hand panel shows the continuum normalized spectra, the middle panel shows the EWs, and the right-hand panel shows the residuals relative to the spectrum observed when the companion should be in eclipse. A first point to note is that all four lines show a phase-dependent change in EW that mirrors the ellipsoidal variability -this effect is well known (e.g. Neilsen, Steeghs &amp; Vrtilek 2008) and further confirms the origin of the variability (Section 4.3). The Balmer absorption lines appear to be blue shifted by ∼12 km s -1 (Fig. 12). This is also seen in the spectra close to conjunction at φ = 0.5 (Fig. 11). However, we do not see a similar shift in the other photospheric lines. The second point to note is that while photospheric absorption lines such as Ca I λ6439 and Ca I λ6463 lines are cleanly subtracted, the H α and H β emission clearly varies with orbital phase. We do not see the Ca II H&amp;K lines in emission, so the changes in the Balmer lines are unlikely to be caused by chromospheric activity.

        <p>The typical Gaussian full width at half-maximum of the H α and H β emission profiles is ∼290 km s -1 . The median EW of the residual H α and H β lines is EW(H α) = 1.79 ± 0.02 and EW(H β) = 2.72 ± 0.02, respectively. We can convert the H α EW to the flux at the stellar surface using F H α = F c EW(H α) (see e.g. Soderblom et al. 1993;González Hernández &amp; Casares 2010). F c is the continuum flux that we derive using Hall (1996) as log (F c ) = 7.538-1.081(B -V) 0 . For V723 Mon, we find (B -V) 0 = 0.85 ± 0.06 mag, using the APASS DR10 photometry and the E(B -V) from the SED fits. We obtain log (F c ) = 6.61 ± 0.06 and F H α = 7.3 ± 1.0 ergs cm -2 s -1 . Normalizing the H α flux to the bolometric flux (i.e. R H α = F H α /σ T 4 ), we obtain log (R H α ) = -3.53 ± 0.06. log (R H α ) is usually compared to the Rossby number R 0 = P rot /τ c ∼ 2.84, where τ c ≈ 21.1 d based on Noyes et al. (1984) and assuming that the giant's rotation is fully synchronized with the orbital period. At this value of R 0 , V723 Mon has a value of log (R H α ) higher than any of the chromospherically active single stars from López-Santiago et al. (2010;see fig. 5 in González Hernández &amp; Casares 2010).

        <p>Another argument against chromospheric activity is that the changes in the Balmer lines with phase are coherent over the ∼3.5 yr spanned by the SES data. If the Balmer emission was dominated by chromospheric activity, we would expect the structure to change with time as the spot patterns evolve. At RV quadrature (φ 0.25 and φ 0.75), the emission profiles of the Balmer lines resemble P-Cygni profiles with both absorption and emission components. This is illustrated in Fig. 13. In comparison, the Ca I λ6439 line is cleanly subtracted and does not show a similar correlation with the phase of the binary orbit. P Cygni profiles tend to be associated with mass outflow and stellar winds. At RV minimum (φ 0.25), the absorption component in the Balmer lines is red shifted whereas at RV maximum (φ 0.75), the absorption is blue shifted. In the rest frame of the giant, the peak of the H α emission component is relatively stationary at ∼ -35 km s -1 . The median separation between the absorption and emission components in H α is V ∼115 km s -1 , however, this appears to vary with orbital phase. The separation is largest for 0 ≤ φ ≤ 0.25, with V ∼148 km s -1 , and drops thereafter. The smallest separation between the two components is seen at phases 0.5 ≤ φ ≤ 0.75, with V ∼104 km s -1 . Much like with the SES spectra, we also see clear variability in the Hα line profiles in the HIRES spectra (Fig. 14), and the asymmetry in the HIRES line profiles also reverses after φ = 0.5.Another argument against chromospheric activity is that the changes in the Balmer lines with phase are coherent over the ∼3.5 yr spanned by the SES data.

        <p>Remarkably, near conjunction (φ 0.5) there is very little Balmer emission (Fig. 13). Both the Balmer and photospheric lines are modulated with the ellipsoidal variations (Fig. 11), however, near φ 0.5, the EW of the Balmer lines increases abruptly, signalling a dramatic drop in Balmer emission. A similar EW increase is not seen in the photospheric lines. This feature is coincident with the eclipse of the unseen companion by the red giant and has the expected duration. The MODS spectra were taken around the eclipse of the dark companion by the red giant at φ 0.5 and the depths of the MODS Balmer H α and H β absorption features also deepen during the eclipse.Remarkably, near conjunction (φ 0.5) there is very little Balmer emission (Fig. 13).

        <p>While we have clear evidence to show the presence of Balmer emission that is correlated with the orbital motion of the putative BH (Section 4.6), the exact origin of the Balmer emission is unclear. One explanation for this additional luminosity and the variability in the Balmer lines is from an accretion flow. Alternative explanations for the Balmer emission can come from a stellar wind and/or mass outflow at the inner Lagrangian point (L 1 ). At φ = 0, the inner Lagrangian point is directed toward the observer. This also coincides with the deeper minimum in the light curve because the surface gravity and brightness is smallest at L 1 (Beech 1985). Conversely, at φ = 0.5, L 1 points away from the observer. It is possible that the Balmer emission is associated with the photoionization of matter streaming through the inner Lagrangian point. The nearly constant velocity offset of the emission peak from the secondary is also consistent with this interpretation. However, this scenario requires a source of photoionization. The NS binary 1FGL J1417.7-4402 also has a persistent H α line with a complex morphology (Strader et al. 2015;Swihart et al. 2018). Instead of an accretion disc, the authors attributed this behaviour to the interaction between the magnetically driven wind from the secondary and the pulsar wind. Balmer photons originating from an interbinary shock or the wind from the secondary will have a velocity offset from the secondary. This is also seen in V723 Mon. However, the H α line in 1FGL J1417.7-4402 is significantly different from what is observed in V723 Mon as it has a double-peaked emission profile that is observed directly in the spectra without the need for template subtraction. Swihart et al. (2018) also did not find independent evidence of a disc through their light curves, whereas we see clear In summary, we see evidence of broad Balmer emission in the spectra. The Balmer line profiles prior to when the unseen companion is eclipsed by the giant (0 ≤ φ ࣠ 0.46) resemble P-Cygni profiles, with a blue shifted emission component and a red shifted absorption component in the rest frame of the giant. When the unseen companion is behind the giant at φ 0.5, both the Balmer components disappear and the Balmer absorption features from the giant become deeper. When the unseen companion re-emerges after the eclipse at phases 0.54 ࣠ φ ≤ 1, we see a clear change in the P-Cygni-like line profile, with both the absorption and emission components blue shifted. However, the absorption component is blue shifted more than the emission and the P-Cygni profile is reversed. We also see significant changes in the Balmer line depths at φ = 0.5 when the companion is eclipsed. The exact origin of the Balmer emission, be it from an accretion disc around the BH, a stellar wind, mass flow into an inner Lagrange point in the binary, or a combination of these, remains unclear.While we have clear evidence to show the presence of Balmer emission that is correlated with the orbital motion of the putative BH (Section 4.6), the exact origin of the Balmer emission is unclear.

We also see significant changes in the Balmer line depths at φ = 0.5 when the companion is eclipsed. The exact origin of the Balmer emission, be it from an accretion disc around the BH, a stellar wind, mass flow into an inner Lagrange point in the binary, or a combination of these, remains unclear.</p>

In the merged Swift XRT data, we detect a source with 18.5 ± 4.9 background-subtracted counts in the 0.3-2.0 keV energy range, corresponding to an aperture corrected count rate of (1.4 ± 0.4) × 10 -3 counts s -1 . Assuming that E(B -V) 0.086 from Section 4.1, and using the relationship between reddening and atomic hydrogen column density from Liszt (2014), the Galactic column density towards V723 Mon is N H,V723 7.1 × 10 20 cm -2 . This is considerably smaller than the total column density in the line of sight towards V723 Mon (N H,LOS = 3.42 × 10 21 cm -2 ).

        <p>The Swift XRT estimate of the X-ray luminosity is comparable to the L X ∼ 10 30 -10 31 ergs s -1 observed for quiescent X-ray binaries (Dinc ¸er et al. 2018) and the L X ∼ 10 29 -10 30 ergs s -1 observed for chromospherically active RS CVn systems (Demircan 1987). If the X-ray luminosity originates from an accretion disc, the putative BH accretes at a very low luminosity of ∼10 -9 L edd . There is observational evidence that indicates that the X-ray luminosity from quiescent BHs is significantly fainter than that from NSs (see e.g. Asai et al. 1998;Menou et al. 1999). While debated, this has been attributed to ADAF (see e.g. Narayan &amp; Yi 1995) and the existence of event horizons for BHs. However, given the rapid rotation of the giant, some of the observed X-ray luminosity may originate from the giant's chromosphere (Gondoin 2007). The X-ray spectra of X-ray binaries are generally harder (hotter), with average temperatures kT &gt; 5 keV, compared to stellar coronae that have lower temperatures, with kT &lt; 2 keV (Kong et al. 2002).

        <p>The stronger on the mass come from the PHOEBE models of the ellipsoidal variability in Section 4.3. Ignoring inclination, ellipsoidal variability constrains the mass ratio q because (to leading order) the amplitude of the P orb /2 term depends on 2 ∼ (R/a) 3 /q while the amplitudes of the P orb and P orb /3 terms depend on (R giant /a) 4 /q (e.g. Morris 1985;Gomel, Faigler &amp; Mazeh 2021). Since the semimajor axis is determined by the period, mass function and mass ratio, a 3 ∝ P 2 f(1 + q) 2 , the ellipsoidal variability can constrain both R giant and q. This also means that the radius of the giant is an important independent constraint. Given the period, mass function, and amplitude 2 , the mass of the giant M giant = f q(1 + q) 2 ∝ R 3 giant simply scales with the radius of the giant. The mass of the companion, M comp = f(1 + q) 2 , is less dependent on the radius because the mass ratio q is small.

        <p>We next consider all the possible scenarios for the composition of the companion, with Table 5 providing a summary. If the companion is a single object, the options are a star, a WD, an NS, or a BH. A star is ruled out by the eclipse and SED limits from Section 4.5, with M comp &lt; 0.8 M based on the lack of eclipses. A WD is ruled out because its mass would exceed the Chandrasekhar mass limit of 1.4 M . An NS is unlikely, since a companion mass of M comp 3.04 M is still slightly larger than the maximum passable mass of an NS (M ∼ 3 M ; Lattimer &amp; Prakash 2001). Additionally, the mass is well above the maximum observed masses of M 2.01 ± 0.04 M and M 2.14 +0.10 -0.09 M found for the NSs PSR J0348+0432 and MSP J0740 + 6620, respectively (Antoniadis et al. 2013;Cromartie et al. 2020). The mass of the dark companion is slightly larger than the M 2.59 +0.09 -0.08 M massgap compact object in the LIGO/VIRGO gravitational wave merger event GW190814 (Abbott et al. 2020), and it is comparable in mass to the M BH 3.3 +2.8 -0.7 M non-interacting BH identified around the red giant 2MASS J05215658 + 4359220 by Thompson et al. (2019). The mass estimates for V723 Mon, due to its ellipsoidal variability, are much tighter than for 2MASS J05215658 + 4359220. Thus, the simplest explanation of observed V723 Mon system properties is that the binary companion is a BH near the lower end of the mass gap.We next consider all the possible scenarios for the composition of the companion, with Table 5 providing a summary.

        <p>There are many more possible scenarios if the companion is a binary. The orbit of such a binary has to be fairly compact (see Appendix A), but not too compact, or the system would merge too rapidly (see below). While a single phase of common envelope evolution can likely lead to the simple binary models, any of these triple solutions likely requires a more complex evolutionary pathway, which we will not attempt to explore here. Based on our analyses in Section 4.5, the dark companion cannot be a stellar binary given that the two star mass limit is M binary &lt; 1.5 M from the eclipse constraints (Fig. 10).

        <p>In summary, while it is difficult to rule out more complex scenarios where the companion to the giant is a binary consisting of at least one compact object, the simplest explanation is that the dark companion is a low-mass BH. This would make V723 Mon a unique system, as it would contain both the lowest mass BH in a binary and be the closest known BH yet discovered. The low X-ray luminosity (L/L edd ∼ 10 -9 ) of this system likely also suggests a BH companion, as quiescent BHs are known to be X-ray faint (see Section 4.7).In summary, while it is difficult to rule out more complex scenarios where the companion to the giant is a binary consisting of at least one compact object, the simplest explanation is that the dark companion is a low-mass BH.

        <p>The first argument against a ∼20 d inner binary is the dynamical stability argument raised by G14.

The 45 R semimajor axis of a 20 d binary is very close to the Roche limit around the companion of 49 R . A rough estimate of the largest semimajor axis that could be dynamically stable given the outer orbit and the mass ratios is 32 R based on Mardling &amp; Aarseth (2001).

        <p>We experimented with numerically integrating planar three-body orbits starting from nominally circular orbits as initial conditions for ∼100 orbits of the outer binary and varying mass ratios of the inner binary. High mass ratio inner binaries were generally very unstable, presumably because the lighter star in the inner binary is trying to maintain an orbital radius close to the full semimajor axis of 45 R in this limit. Equal mass inner binaries tended to be more stable, presumably because each star now only has an orbit of ∼23 R about the centre of mass of the inner binary. Nonetheless, many trials resulted in the destruction of the system well before 100 orbits were completed. These results were not unique to picking a truly resonant P orb /3 period for the inner binary. We suspect, but do not investigate here, that essentially all such inner binaries are unstable on long time-scales. The inner binary would have to have a period shorter than ∼12 d to satisfy the dynamical stability criterion, although such systems may still be secularly unstable.We experimented with numerically integrating planar three-body orbits starting from nominally circular orbits as initial conditions for ∼100 orbits of the outer binary and varying mass ratios of the inner binary.

In particular, the wider inner binaries would generally drive the outer orbit to be significantly elliptical in our numerical experiments even if they were stable over the 100 orbits.

        <p>A tidally locked star is simply rotating at the orbital frequency, so the rotation velocity at the surface scales with the cylindrical radius from the rotation axis. Thus, the rotational velocity is larger on the long axis of the star than on the short axis. When viewed along a principal axis, there is the usual cancellation of the contributions from the parts of the star rotating towards and away from the observer. However, when viewed at an intermediate direction, the contribution of one sign of the rotation comes from the slower moving short axis, while the contribution from the other sign comes from the faster moving long axis. This makes a contribution to the observed radial velocities with a period P orb /2 because it is a m = 2 perturbation just like the tidal distortions. If the orbit is genuinely circular, a fit to the RV curve will instead yield a small eccentricity to try to remove the contribution from this effect (see Eaton 2008). This should mean that the dominant velocity residual will now have a period P orb /3, and we think this is the likely origin of the P orb /3 signal found by Strassmeier et al.

In particular, for the 20 d period inner binary proposed by S12, we would expect strong fluctuating tides on periods of 30 and 15 d, although the 30 d period could be partly absorbed into the ELL fit.

Given the spectroscopic parameters in Section 4.1, we estimate that ν max ≈ 6.8 μHz, which corresponds to a period of P osc ≈ 1.7 d. With no clear peaks in the periodogram of the existing TESS data, we cannot presently use asteroseismology as an additional probe of the mass of the giant, but this may change with further analysis and additional TESS data. Finally, many compact-object systems (e.g. Wagner et al. 1992;Zurita, Casares &amp; Shahbaz 2003;Shahbaz et al. 2013) show rapid variability on time-scales of minutes to hours. We used the ROAD telescope (Hambsch 2012) to continuously observe the system for about 2 h on multiple nights, obtaining in total more than 3000 10-s B-band exposures. We have reduced these data using the ASAS-SN version of the 
            <rs type="software">Alard</rs> (2000) image subtraction software. We do not find any evidence for short (&lt;1 h) time-scale B-band variability, with the rms scatter during individual nights below 0.01 mag. Given that the 'second light' contribution to the total B-band flux of V723 Mon is about 60 per cent, this translates to the short time-scale variability of this component being less that ∼2 per cent. However, on longer time-scales of hours to days B-band variability at the ∼2 per cent level is still possible (on top of the observed ellipsoidal modulations discussed in Section 4.3).

        <p>We derive a 3σ upperlimit of 1.2 × 10 -4 counts s -1 to the 2.0-10.0 keV count rate, which corresponds to an absorbed flux of 1.4 × 10 -14 ergs s -1 and a luminosity of 3.6 × 10 29 ergs s -1 .We derive a 3σ upperlimit of 1.2 × 10 -4 counts s -1 to the 2.0-10.0 keV count rate, which corresponds to an absorbed flux of 1.4 × 10 -14 ergs s -1 and a luminosity of 3.6 × 10 29 ergs s -1 .</p>
        <p>Here, the hardness ratio is defined as HR = (H-S)/(H + S), where H is the number of counts in the 2.0-10.0 keV energy range and S is the number of counts in the 0.3-2.0 keV energy range.MNRAS 504, 2577-2602 (2021)Downloadedfrom https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/504/2/2577/6261635 by guest on 04 July 2022Here, the hardness ratio is defined as HR = (H-S)/(H + S), where H is the number of counts in the 2.0-10.0 keV energy range and S is the number of counts in the 0.3-2.0 keV energy range.MNRAS 504, 2577-2602 (2021)Downloadedfrom https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/504/2/2577/6261635 by guest on 04 July 2022</p>
