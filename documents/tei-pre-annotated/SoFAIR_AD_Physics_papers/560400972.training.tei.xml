        <p>Notwithstanding decades of progress since Yukawa first developed a description of the force between nucleons in terms of meson exchange 1 , a full understanding of the strong interaction remains a major challenge in modern science. One remaining difficulty arises from the non-perturbative nature of the strong force, which leads to the phenomenon of quark confinement at distances on the order of the size of the proton. Here we show that in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, where quarks and gluons are set free over an extended volume, two species of produced vector (spin-1) mesons, namely φ and K * 0 , emerge with a surprising pattern of global spin alignment. In particular, the global spin alignment for φ is unexpectedly large, while that for K * 0 is consistent with zero. The observed spin-alignment pattern and magnitude for the φ cannot be explained by conventional mechanisms, while a model with a connection to strong force fields 2-6 , i.e. an effective proxy description within the Standard Model and Quantum Chromodynamics, accommodates the current data. This connection, if fully established, will open a potential new avenue for studying the behaviour of strong force fields.Notwithstanding decades of progress since Yukawa first developed a description of the force between nucleons in terms of meson exchange 1 , a full understanding of the strong interaction remains a major challenge in modern science.

        <p>At the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, heavy ions (e.g., gold nuclei) are accelerated up to 99.995% of the speed of light and collide from opposite directions. Due to the extreme conditions achieved, quarks and gluons are liberated for a brief time 1 arXiv:2204.02302v3 [hep-ph] 18 Jan 2023 (∼ 10 -23 seconds), instead of being confined inside particles such as protons and neutrons by the strong force. The hot and dense state of matter formed in these collisions is called the quark gluon plasma (QGP) [7][8][9][10] . These collisions offer an ideal environment for studying phenomena related to Quantum Chromodynamics, the theory of strong interaction among quarks and gluons.At the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, heavy ions (e.g., gold nuclei) are accelerated up to 99.995% of the speed of light and collide from opposite directions.

        <p>The global polarization of quarks influences production of vector mesons such as φ(1020) and K * 0 (892). Unlike Λ ( Λ) hyperons, which can undergo weak decay with parity violation, and where the products in the decay's rest frame are emitted preferentially in the spin direction, the polarization of vector mesons cannot be directly measured since they mainly decay through the strong interaction, in which parity is conserved. Nevertheless the spin state of a vector meson can be described by a 3 × 3 spin density matrix with unit trace 23 . The diagonal elements of this matrix, namely, ρ 11 , ρ 00 and ρ -1-1 , are probabilities for the spin component along a quantization axis to take the values of 1, 0, and -1 respectively. The quantization axis is a chosen axis onto which the projection of angular momentum has well-defined quantum numbers. When the three spin states have equal probability to be occupied, all three elements are 1/3 and there is no spin alignment.The global polarization of quarks influences production of vector mesons such as φ(1020) and K * 0 (892).

        <p>The relationship of the φ meson to the φ-meson field is like that of the photon to the electromagnetic field. In analogy to the way in which the photon mediates the electromagnetic interaction, the φ meson can be regarded as a mediator of the nuclear interaction. The φ-meson field behaves like the electromagnetic field since both are vector fields, but the φ-meson field is one component of the short-distance (a few fm) strong force, while the electromagnetic field is a long-distance force. The φ-meson fields, along with other meson fields such as σ, π, ρ, ω, etc., are low-energy or intermediate-distance (of the order of nuclear radii) effective modes of q q 34, 35 . These modes with the vacuum quantum number are in connection with modes of two gluon fields in Quantum Chromodynamics 36 . Just as an electric charge in motion can generate an electromagnetic field, the strange quarks s and s in motion can produce an effective φ-meson field. The local difference between the currents of s and s (net-strangeness current), which may occur because the s and s have different momenta at a given space-time point, can generate an effective φ-meson field. Through its magnetic part, the vector meson field has been used to predict the difference between the polarization of Λ and Λ 37 . Similar to how an electric field can polarize a quark and anti-quark through spin-orbit couplings, the strong electric part of the φ-meson field can also polarize s and s, leading to a positive contribution to ρ 00 of the φ-meson (as a bound state of s and s) but with much larger magnitude due to its strong interaction (a large coupling constant g φ ). Figure 3 shows that, while conventional explanations fall far short in accounting for the data, our experimental measurement in 20-60% centrality can be described well by this model, which invokes the φ-meson field, thus favoring the conclusion that the φ-meson field leads to the φ-meson global spin alignment.The relationship of the φ meson to the φ-meson field is like that of the photon to the electromagnetic field.

        <p>The lifetime of K * 0 is about 10 times shorter than the φ lifetime, corresponding to a mean proper decay length cτ ≈ 4.1 fm, making it susceptible to in-medium effects. The difference between the global spin alignment for K * 0 and φ may be attributed to different in-medium interactions due to this difference in lifetime, a polarization transfer during the late stage of hadronic interactions 38 , and a different response to the vector meson field 2 . Similar to strange quarks (s and s), light quarks can also be polarized by vorticity fields and vector meson fields. However, the vector fields that polarize light quarks, such as the ρ and ω fields, are distinct from the φ field that polarizes strange quarks. The contributions from vector meson fields to ρ 00 for K * 0 involve averages of products of different vector meson fields such as that from the φ (for the s) and ρ (for the d). It is expected that the correlations between these two different, fluctuating vector meson fields for d and s are much weaker than the correlations between the same fields for s and s, causing the vector meson field contributions to ρ 00 for K * 0 to be negligible 4 .

The above considerations may account for the insignificant deviation of ρ 00 for K * 0 from 1/3, as observed in experiments.</p>

        <p>In heavy ion collisions, the global spin alignment for a collision system can show up in local spin alignments also. It is the same phenomenon, but viewed from different frames. For example, the relation between global ρ 00 and production plane ρ 00 {PP} is given 33 by ρ 00 {PP} -1 3 = (ρ 00 -1 3 ) 1+3v 2 4 . Here the production plane is the plane defined by the beam and vector meson's momentum direction, and the ρ 00 {PP} is measured with the normal to the production plane as the quantization axis. Another popular choice of local frame is the helicity frame, in which vector meson's momentum direction is taken as the quantization axis. An analytical relation between global ρ 00 and the helicity frame ρ 00 does not exist, but based on our simulation for the same kinematic range, typical values of ρ 00 in the helicity frame (in between 0.2 and 0.6 53 ) will result in the global ρ 00 deviating from 1/3 by only ∼ 0.001 and ∼ 0.01 for φ and K * 0 mesons, respectively, which are either negligible or very small when compared to the (ρ 00 -1/3) observations presented in this work. In a recent work, it is argued that the gradient of the radial flow along the beam axis can generate transverse vorticity loops at finite rapidity, and cause the transverse local spin alignment 26 . This effect can give a negative contribution to the global spin alignment of vector mesons, and is more prominent and clearly evident in central collisions. This can be part of the reason why at top RHIC energies, we observe that the central value of ρ 00 is below 1/3.In heavy ion collisions, the global spin alignment for a collision system can show up in local spin alignments also.

An analytical relation between global ρ 00 and the helicity frame ρ 00 does not exist, but based on our simulation for the same kinematic range, typical values of ρ 00 in the helicity frame (in between 0.2 and 0.6 53 ) will result in the global ρ 00 deviating from 1/3 by only ∼ 0.001 and ∼ 0.01 for φ and K * 0 mesons, respectively, which are either negligible or very small when compared to the (ρ 00 -1/3) observations presented in this work. In a recent work, it is argued that the gradient of the radial flow along the beam axis can generate transverse vorticity loops at finite rapidity, and cause the transverse local spin alignment 26 . This effect can give a negative contribution to the global spin alignment of vector mesons, and is more prominent and clearly evident in central collisions. This can be part of the reason why at top RHIC energies, we observe that the central value of ρ 00 is below 1/3.</p>
        <p>The result with L boosted into vector meson's rest frame In the study of the hyperon global polarization or the vector meson global spin alignment, it is a convention to take L in the laboratory frame as the quantization axis. We follow that convention in this paper. An alternative choice of the quantization axis is the direction of L after being boosted into particle's rest frame 54 . We estimated that for our ρ 00 value that is averaged over beam energies of 62.4 GeV and below, the difference between the results with and without boosting L into rest frame is on the order of 10 -3 .The result with L boosted into vector meson's rest frame In the study of the hyperon global polarization or the vector meson global spin alignment, it is a convention to take L in the laboratory frame as the quantization axis.

After repeating the analysis with reasonable variations of quality selections or analysis procedures and obtaining the corresponding values, systematic errors from each individual source are calculated as (maximum value -minimum value)/ √ 12, assuming uniform probability distributions between the maximum and minimum values. The final systematic errors are the quadrature sum of the systematic errors from the various sources. The averaged ρ 00 over beam energies of 62.4 GeV and below is calculated for each variation. The systematic errors for averaged ρ 00 are evaluated with the same procedure as described above. Contributions of each systematic uncertainty for the averaged ρ 00 are listed in extended data Tables 1 and2, for φ and K * 0 respectively.for signal extraction, iv) histogram bin counting vs. functional integration for yield extraction, v) different efficiency evaluation methods.
