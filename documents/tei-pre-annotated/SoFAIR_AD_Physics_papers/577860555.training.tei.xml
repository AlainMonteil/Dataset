        <p>We present an interstellar medium and stellar population analysis of three spectroscopically confirmed z &gt; 7 galaxies in the Early Release Observations JWST /NIRCam and JWST /NIRSpec data of the SMACS J0723.3 -7327 cluster. We use the Bayesian spectral energy distribution-fitting code 
            <rs type="software">PROSPECTOR</rs> with a flexible star formation history (SFH), a variable dust attenuation law, and a self-consistent model of nebular emission (continuum and emission lines). Importantly, we self-consistently fit both the emission line fluxes from JWST /NIRSpec and the broad-band photometry from JWST /NIRCam, taking into account slit-loss effects. We find that these three z= 7.6-8.5 galaxies ( M ≈ 10 8 M ) are young with rising SFHs and mass-weighted ages of 3-4 Myr, though we find indications for underlying older stellar populations. The inferred gas-phase metallicities broadly agree with the direct metallicity estimates from the auroral lines. The galaxy with the lowest gas-phase metallicity ( Z gas = 0.06 Z ) has a steeply rising SFH, is very compact ( &lt; 0.2 kpc), and has a high star formation rate surface density ( SFR ≈ 22 M yr -1 kpc -2 ), consistent with rapid gas accretion. The two other objects with higher gas-phase metallicities show more complex multicomponent morphologies on kpc scales, indicating that their recent increase in star formation rate is driven by mergers or internal, gravitational instabilities. We discuss effects of assuming different SFH priors or only fitting the photometric data. Our analysis highlights the strength and importance of combining JWST imaging and spectroscopy for fully assessing the nature of galaxies at the earliest epochs.

        <p>JWST will impro v e the situation tremendously by delivering larger wav elength co v erage and higher spectral resolution, both with spectra and medium-or narrow-band imaging. This will help break the de generac y between strong emission lines and a strong Balmer/4000 Å break, which is needed to age-date these galaxies accurately (Roberts-Borsani et al. 2021 ;Tacchella et al. 2022c ), enabling not only with learning more about the physical properties of these high-z galaxies during and before the EoR, but also with timing cosmic dawn by delivering accurate SFHs. Several JWST programmes will deliver such data sets (i.e. spectra and medium-band imaging), including the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), which is a Guaranteed Time Observer (GTO) programme using about 800 h of prime time and 800 h of parallel time to study the formation and evolution of galaxies, combining NIRSpec, NIRCam, and MIRI data in a coordinated observing programme (Rieke et al. 2019 ).JWST will impro v e the situation tremendously by delivering larger wav elength co v erage and higher spectral resolution, both with spectra and medium-or narrow-band imaging.

        <p>These three objects have been discussed in several recent papers (e.g. Arellano-C órdova et al. 2022 ;Brinchmann 2022 ;Schaerer et al. 2022 ;Trussler et al. 2022 ;Carnall et al. 2023 ;Curti et al. 2023 ;Katz et al. 2023 ;Rhoads et al. 2023 ;Trump et al. 2023 ). The different studies rely on not only different measurement techniques but also different reduction and calibration pipelines, making comparisons difficult. Carnall et al. ( 2023 ) performed spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of the NIRCam imaging and the existing HST imaging for these three objects, finding low stellar masses [log( M /M ) = 7.1-8.2] and correspondingly young mean stellar ages of only a few Myr. Curti et al. ( 2023 ) used the [O III ] 4363 auroral line to measure metallicities with the direct T e method, finding Galaxy ID 04590 to be extremely metal poor [12 + log(O/H) ≈ 7], Galaxy ID 10612 to be about 1/10 solar, and Galaxy ID 06355 to be about one-third solar. The latter two objects are marginally consistent with the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR; Mannucci et al. 2010 ;Onodera et al. 2016 ;Curti et al. 2020 ;Suzuki et al. 2021 ;P apo vich et al. 2022 ), while Galaxy ID 04590 deviates significantly from it, consistent with being far from the smooth equilibrium between gas flows, star formation, and metal enrichment in place at later epochs. This possibly indicates that we enter at z &gt; 7 another epoch of galaxy formation, where galactic systems are out of equilibrium and evolve more stochastically. Consistent with this, other studies find high ionization, low metallicity, and high pressure in the interstellar medium (ISM; Schaerer et al. 2022 ;Trussler et al. 2022 ;Katz et al. 2023 ;Rhoads et al. 2023 ;Trump et al. 2023 ).These three objects have been discussed in several recent papers (e.g. Arellano-C órdova et al. 2022 ;Brinchmann 2022 ;Schaerer et al. 2022 ;Trussler et al. 2022 ;Carnall et al. 2023 ;Curti et al. 2023 ;Katz et al. 2023 ;Rhoads et al. 2023 ;Trump et al. 2023 ).

An additional, local background subtraction is performed on the final mosaiced images and applied to the individual exposures, see details in Robertson et al. ( 2023 ) and Tacchella et al. ( 2023 ).
        </p>
        <p>We measure object fluxes using the Bayesian model-fitting program 
            <rs type="software">FORCEPHO</rs> (Johnson et al., in preparation). This program simultaneously fits multiple point spread function (PSF)-convolved S érsic profiles, each having 11 parameters, to all of the backgroundsubtracted stage 2 cal exposures for every NIRCam filter. The joint posterior distribution for the parameters of all of the profiles is sampled via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), allowing estimation of covariances between the parameters of a single object (such as S érsic index and half-light radius) as well as covariance between objects (due to blending), and identification of any non-Gaussian posterior distributions. The simultaneous fit to all bands and the MCMC sampling allow us to obtain self-consistent estimates of object fluxes in each band. We represent Galaxy IDs 06355 and 10612 with several subcomponents to account for clumpy structure obvious in the higher resolution F150W imaging, and we simultaneously model all sources within 1 arcsec to account for the contribution of extended structures. To determine total source fluxes, we then combine the fluxes of the subcomponents while taking into account covariances among them, which we accomplish by summing the subcomponent fluxes for each posterior sample and then computing the mean and standard deviation of the summed fluxes. In Figs 1 ,2 , and 3 , we show examples of the data, model, and stacked residuals, respectively, for one draw from the MCMC chain. We have varied the number of subcomponents used for the sources and find similar total fluxes. Due to uncertainties in photometric calibration and other factors affecting these very early data, we adopt an error floor of 10 per cent on the photometry.
        </p>
        <p>The FORCEPHO fits to the images also provide size estimates. For the single component of Galaxy ID 04590, this is taken directly from the half-light radius of the fitted S érsic profile. For the other two Galaxy IDs that have multiple components, we estimate a combined ef fecti ve half-light radius by generating a model image with the PSF remo v ed using the F150W fluxes, compute the barycentre, and determine the radius containing half the combined model flux. This yields half-light radii of 0.039 arcsec ± 0.004 (0.18 ± 0.02 kpc), 0.077 arcsec ± 0.008 (0.39 ± 0.04 kpc), and 0.100 arcsec ± 0.010 (0.51 ± 0.05 kpc), respectively, for Galaxy IDs 04590, 06355, and 10612. The size for Galaxy ID 10612 is driven by the separation between the two dominant components, which are each ࣠ 0.03 arcsec in half-light radius. We note that we have not corrected these sizes for lensing distortions (Section 2.5 ). We expect this effect to be small for Galaxy IDs 06355 and 10612, because they are only weakly magnified. This effect could however be more substantial for Galaxy ID 04590, indicating that our size is possibly an upper limit.The FORCEPHO fits to the images also provide size estimates.

        <p>The GTO pipeline uses a custom flagging and masking algorithm for bad pixels and cosmic rays, which ef fecti v ely remo v es all artefacts from the final spectra. The extraction is performed with a custom aperture, using a boxcar extraction. After inspecting the exposures of the individual nods, it was found that one of the shutters on which Galaxy ID 04590 was nodded did not open in Obs 7 (Rawle et al. 2018 ); the affected nod positions were discarded before stacking the data.Stacking was performed with the GTO pipeline, taking into account the variance and quality arrays of both pointings. We refined the flux calibration using an empirical response function, derived from a spectrophotometric star observed during commissioning (Programme #1128; Gordon et al. 2022 ). Because our three targets are only marginally resolved, we apply the path-loss correction derived for a point-like source. The path-loss correction appropriate for an extended uniform source gives a spectrum that has higher o v erall flux, but approximately the same shape as our default choice.2 As we discuss below (see Section 2.3 ), we introduce a nuisance parameter in the spectrophotometric modelling to account for any mismatch between the photometry and spectroscopy (related to slit loss, calibration issues as well as physical effects). Therefore, it does not matter in this analysis whether we use the point-like or extended source approximation. The resulting spectra are shown in the lower left corner of Figs 123.The GTO pipeline uses a custom flagging and masking algorithm for bad pixels and cosmic rays, which ef fecti v ely remo v es all artefacts from the final spectra.

        <p>Emission line fluxes were measured using PPXF (Cappellari 2017 ), using the configuration described in Curti et al. ( 2023 ). Briefly, we fit the stellar continuum using a linear combination of simple stellar population spectra from the C3K library (Conroy et al. 2019 ), using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) Isochrones and Stellar Tracks (MIST) isochrones (Choi et al. 2016 ). The continuum is scaled using a 10th-order Legendre polynomial. Emission lines are modelled as Gaussians. All the model spectra (both continuum and emission line) are constrained to have the same velocity and velocity dispersion; note that the continuum is only marginally resolved; replacing the single stellar population (SSP) template spectra with a constant does not change the emission line fluxes (Curti et al. 2023 ). The resulting fluxes have already been published (Curti et al. 2023 , their table 1) and are not repeated here. We remark that fitting each line individually does not change our conclusions, as reported in Katz et al. ( 2023 ).

            <rs type="software">PROSPECTOR</rs> (Johnson et al. 2021 ) to simultaneously fit the photometric and spectroscopic data. We adopt a similar, 13-parameter physical model and priors as described in Tacchella et al. ( 2022c ). Specifically, we fit for the stellar mass, stellar and gas-phase metallicities, dust attenuation [using a two-component dust model, which includes a diffuse component for the entire galaxy, extra attenuation around the youngest stars ( &lt; 10 Myr), and a flexible slope; three free parameters], and ionization parameter for the nebular emission. We adopt the flexible SFH prescription (Leja et al. 2019 ) with six time bins with the bursty-continuity prior (Tacchella et al. 2022c ). This model includes five free parameters that control the ratio of star formation rate (SFR) in six adjacent time bins; the first two bins are spaced at 0-5 and 5-10 Myr of lookback time, and the remaining four bins are log-spaced to z = 20. This implies that we are not able to infer ages below 2.5 Myr, which we believe is a realistic lower limit for galaxies. We also fit for a nuisance parameter that scales all the emission line fluxes by a constant factor to account for flux calibration offsets or , first-order , slit losses or physical ef fects (see belo w for details). For all the fits, we assume the MIST stellar models (Choi, Conroy &amp; Byler 2017 ) and a Chabrier ( 2003 )

        <p>PROSPECTOR has the ability to model (and fit) nebular emission line fluxes using the nebular line and continuum emission predictions provided by the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis code, as described in Byler et al. ( 2017 ). These predictions are based on interpolated CLOUDY (version 13.03;Ferland et al. 2013 ) photoionization models that were constructed on a grid of ionization parameter ( U ), gasphase metallicity, and SSP age, using stellar spectra of the same age and metallicity as the ionizing source. The solar nebular abundances are taken from Anders &amp; Grevesse ( 1989 ). The CLOUDY modelling used a constant electron density and the highest ionization parameter in the grid is log( U ) = -1, making it difficult to model extreme [O III ] ratios (e.g. Ferland et al. 2013 ;Katz et al. 2023 ). Critically, the nebular emission is scaled by the number of ionizing photons predicted at each SSP age for the given SFH.PROSPECTOR has the ability to model (and fit) nebular emission line fluxes using the nebular line and continuum emission predictions provided by the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis code, as described in Byler et al.

        <p>As discussed in Tacchella et al. ( 2022a ; see also Smith et al. 2022 ), these assumptions do not necessarily hold at these early epochs: LyC absorption by dust can be important (absorbing up to 50 per cent of the LyC photons during a starburst phase), about 5-10 per cent of the LyC photons are absorbed by helium, and a small fraction of the LyC can also escape the galaxy. Ho we ver, we add additional flexibility in tw o w ays. First, we allow the gas-phase and stellar metallicities to take on different values, which in detail means that the shape of the model ionizing spectrum may be different than that used to predict the nebular line ratios, though the normalization (and hence Balmer line flux) is kept consistent. Secondly, we rescale all the model emission line fluxes multiplying them by f scale , a fittable nuisance parameter (we do not rescale the nebular continuum). This constant factor can account for flux calibration offsets with NIRSpec or , first-order , slit losses, dif ferential magnification ef fects, 3 or physical ef fects like LyC escape or dust absorption.As discussed in Tacchella et al.

        <p>In addition to the fiducial PROSPECTOR set-up described abo v e, we run three further configurations in order to investigate how our results depend on the modelling assumptions as well as the data present. Specifically, our fiducial approach simultaneously fits the NIRCam photometry and NIRSpec emission lines with the bursty-continuity prior ('EL and bursty' fits). Since the inferred stellar population parameters can significantly depend on the assumed SFH prior (Carnall et al. 2019 ;Leja et al. 2019 ;Suess et al. 2022 ;Tacchella et al. 2022b , c ;Whitler et al. 2023 ), we vary the SFH prior. Specifically, the bursty-continuity SFH prior assumes that log(SFR) between adjacent time bins is described by Student's t-distribution with σ = 1.0 and ν = 2. We also run fits with the standard continuity prior ('EL and continuous' fits), which assumes σ = 0.3, which weights against sharp transitions between the different time bins of the SFH (Leja et al. 2019 ). In addition, to study the effect of including emission lines in the fitting, we fit those two SFH prescriptions to only the photometry, i.e. ignoring the emission line constraints ('phot-only and bursty' and 'phot-only and continuous').In addition to the fiducial PROSPECTOR set-up described abo v e, we run three further configurations in order to investigate how our results depend on the modelling assumptions as well as the data present.

        <p>3 Our sources are extended, consisting of several components. Different emission lines have probably different spatial extents (P érez-Montero et al. 2007 , their fig. 6). Since the magnification might not be constant across the source, emission lines from more compact regions could be more magnified, leading to a bias in the line ratios ('magnification bias'). This effect is probably negligible for Galaxy IDs 06355 and 10612, which both have a very low magnification (Table 1 ).3 Our sources are extended, consisting of several components.

        <p>The emission lines are o v erall well reproduced (bottom panels of Fig. 4 ) with χ 2 tot = 1 . 1, 1.4, and 1.7, respectively. As mentioned in Section 2. Importantly, the bottom panels of Fig. 4 include the nuisance parameter that rescales all the emission fluxes. We find that the emission lines predicted from the model need to be suppressed by 40-70 per cent in order to be consistent with the observed fluxes. Not including this nuisance parameter would lead to non-physical high stellar metallicities (i.e. &gt; Z ) in order to suppress the ionizing photon production. Specifically, the rescale factors f scale are 0 . 57 + 0 . 07 -0 . 07 , 0 . 50 + 0 . 11 -0 . 07 , and 0 . 31 + 0 . 05 -0 . 04 for Galaxy IDs 04590, 06355, and 10612, respectively. Our inferred rescale factors are physically plausible. They are larger than the slit-loss corrections (12, 29, and 39 per cent for Galaxy IDs 04590, 06355, and 10612), implying that the slit loss can only partially explain our inferred f scale , and that the remaining 31, 21, and 30 per cent need be explained via other means; for example, LyC absorption by dust or escape. Overall, this highlights that understanding slit-loss corrections is fundamentally important to shed light on to both the stellar populations and radiative transfer effects.The emission lines are o v erall well reproduced (bottom panels of Fig. 4 ) with χ 2 tot = 1 . 1, 1.4, and 1.7, respectively.

Both the stellar masses and ages are consistent within the uncertainties. The ages of Carnall et al. ( 2023 ) are at lower end of our quantiles, but still consistent with our estimates. Ho we ver, Carnall et al. ( 2023 ) seem to rule out any underlying older component for those galaxies, which contrasts with our estimates. It is not straightforward to pinpoint the cause for this difference, but it most probably has to do with the different SFH prescriptions. Carnall et al. ( 2023 ) assume a simple constant SFH, while we assume a more flexible SFH. In addition, different extraction methods of the photometry could also lead to some differences. Finally, Carnall et al. ( 2023 ) only fit the photometry, while we fit both photometry and emission lines. As shown in Section 3.3 , we would however expect that this leads to the opposite trend: excluding emission lines leads typically to older ages (Table 2 ).</p>

        <p>We find that the gas-phase and stellar metallicities are marginally consistent, though we emphasize that the inferred stellar metallicities are uncertain and that the elements that the gas-phase and stellar metallicities trace are different.

        <p>Fig. 8 shows the posterior distribution of the fits including both photometry and emission lines (red; fiducial) and only photometry (blue) for Galaxy ID 06355. The results are summarized for all objects in Table 2 . An obvious, straightforward difference is that the gas-phase metallicity is basically unconstrained when fitting only the photometry. In addition, since the relative line ratios are sensitive to the dust attenuation (in particular Balmer line series), the dust attenuation is more tightly constrained when including emission lines, which also affects the stellar age constraint via the rest-UV (although some de generac y remains due to the fle xible dust attenuation law). Directly related, another large difference can be seen for the inferred SFHs: without emission line constraints, the inferred stellar ages are older since the most recent SFH is less well constrained. This then also leads to larger stellar masses (up to ∼0.4 dex in the case of Galaxy ID 04590), indicating that most inferred properties of the galaxies are affected by whether emission lines are included or not in the fits.Fig. 8 shows the posterior distribution of the fits including both photometry and emission lines (red; fiducial) and only photometry (blue) for Galaxy ID 06355.

        <p>Since all these galaxies seem to be undergoing a recent burst in star formation (Fig. 5 ), young stellar populations dominate the SED and outshine older stellar populations. Therefore, a significant amount of stellar mass could be hidden and is difficult to rule out, which implies that the prior on the SFH is expected to play an important role. As mentioned in Section 2.4 , we run PROSPECTOR with two SFH priors: our fiducial 'bursty' prior, which allows for large variations between adjacent time bins, and the standard 'continuity' prior, which downweights extreme bursts.Since all these galaxies seem to be undergoing a recent burst in star formation (Fig. 5 ), young stellar populations dominate the SED and outshine older stellar populations.

        <p>The stellar age constraints come from the rest-UV and 4000 Å break (e.g. Conroy 2013 ). Since we are using a flexible dust attenuation law (Section 2.3 ), the rest-UV has only little constraining power. The 4000 Å break for our three galaxies at z ∼ 7-9 is probed by the broad-band photometry, but -as shown in Fig. 4 -there is a de generac y with the strength of the emission lines. Specifically, both a strong continuum break and strong emission lines can lead to a boost of the longer wavelength filter relative to the shorter wavelength one. But why are we not able to do better when including emission lines in the fitting? The problem is that our nuisance parameter, which rescales the emission line fluxes, is degenerate with the strength of the 4000 Å break, i.e. our emission line measurements mainly constrain the gas-phase metallicity and the dust attenuation, which in second order leads to a tighter constraint on the stellar ages via the rest-UV.The stellar age constraints come from the rest-UV and 4000 Å break (e.g. Conroy 2013 ).

        <p>In this work, we addressed these technical, observational, and astrophysical issues by fitting for a nuisance parameter, f scale , which scales all the emission lines by a constant factor, mainly intended to account for slit loss. We find f scale to be 0 . 57 + 0 . 07 -0 . 07 , 0 . 50 + 0 . 11 -0 . 07 , and 0 . 31 + 0 . 05 -0 . 04 for Galaxy IDs 04590, 06355, and 10612, respectively. If this rescaling is ignored, we find extremely high values for the stellar metallicities ( Z &gt; Z ). This highlights that this factor is important when performing the fitting. Our inferred f scale is larger than calculated from slit loss, implying that 31, 21, and 30 per cent need be explained via other means; for example, LyC absorption by dust or escape. Furthermore, working with unlensed galaxies will resolve the issue with the differential magnification bias.In this work, we addressed these technical, observational, and astrophysical issues by fitting for a nuisance parameter, f scale , which scales all the emission lines by a constant factor, mainly intended to account for slit loss.

        <p>Related to this is the assumption in our approach that stellar populations are driving the emission lines. First, active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and other non-stellar sources could power the emission lines as well as contribute to the rest-UV emission. Within PROSPECTOR , only the rest-frame mid-infrared emission of AGNs can be modelled (i.e. dusty torus emission). There are ongoing efforts to expand upon this. Secondly, a recent analysis by Katz et al. ( 2023 ) shows that the inclusion of high-mass X-ray binaries or a high cosmic ray background in addition to a young, low-metallicity stellar population can provide the additional heating necessary to explain the observed high [O III ] 4364/[O III ] 5007 ratio while remaining consistent with other observed line ratios. Ho we ver, because it is challenging for photoionization models to predict [O III ] 4364 (e.g. Dors et al. 2011 ), we mask this line. More generally, it is notoriously difficult to distinguish between AGN and star formation as an ionization source at low metallicity . Interestingly , Galaxy ID 06355 appears to have an AGN contribution (narro w-line AGN gi ven [Ne IV ] 2422, 2424 is detected; Brinchmann 2022 ). We believe that our results are robust even for this object given that such high-ionization lines can be obtained by adding an X-ray source without strongly affecting the other lines (Katz et al. 2023 ).Related to this is the assumption in our approach that stellar populations are driving the emission lines.

        <p>For completeness, we also mention the caveats related to stars. In particular, in this work we assume a solar abundance pattern scaled by the metallicity. Ho we ver, there is an indication that at higher redshifts (for z ≈ 2 results see Strom et al. 2022 ) galaxies are more α-enhanced (but see Arellano-C órdova et al. 2022 for a recent analysis of this for those three galaxies, finding no evolution in this α-element ratio). This is also theoretically expected given that some of the high-z galaxies are old enough to have seen enrichment from intermediate-mass stars, but are still young enough that Type Ia superno vae hav e not had time to contribute significantly to their enrichment (e.g. Kriek et al. 2016 ). We further assume the MIST stellar models (Choi et al. 2017 ), which include rotation, but not binarity. Investigating the effects the binary-based stellar model (e.g. Eldridge et al. 2017 ) or varying the IMF is beyond the scope of this work.For completeness, we also mention the caveats related to stars.

        <p>Finally, this work investigates three galaxies, the only three z &gt; 7 galaxies that have both NIRCam and NIRSpec observations. Ob viously, we cannot dra w strong conclusions re garding the whole galaxy population from three objects. Although we think that galaxies have mostly increasing SFHs at these early times (e.g. Tacchella et al. 2018 ;Endsley et al. 2021 ), the substantial bursts found in these galaxies might be a selection effect and not representative of all galaxies at z ∼ 7-9 (e.g. Looser et al. 2023 ). Therefore, we stress that the main purpose of this work is to deliver interesting insights into the properties of those three galaxies by combining NIRSpec and NIRCam data, discuss technical but important details for doing this, and discuss how priors play an important role in driving some of the results.Finally, this work investigates three galaxies, the only three z &gt; 7 galaxies that have both NIRCam and NIRSpec observations.

Although we think that galaxies have mostly increasing SFHs at these early times (e.g. Tacchella et al. 2018 ;Endsley et al. 2021 ), the substantial bursts found in these galaxies might be a selection effect and not representative of all galaxies at z ∼ 7-9 (e.g. Looser et al. 2023 ).

        <p>We present a careful ISM and stellar population analysis of the ERO NIRCam and NIRSpec data of three z= 7.6-8.5 galaxies in the SMACS0723 cluster field. These three galaxies have diverse morphologies (Figs 1-3 ), from being compact (Galaxy ID 04590) to being made up of several components (at least two components in Galaxy ID 10612 and four components in Galaxy ID 06355). We perform the photometry with the new photometry tool 
            <rs type="software">FORCEPHO</rs> , which is a Bayesian model-fitting program that simultaneously fits multiple PSF-convolved S érsic profiles to all filters.

        <p>Within the PROSPECTOR framework, we fit a 13-parameter model to NIRCam photometry and the NIRSpec emission lines. This physical SED model includes a flexible SFH, a multicomponent dust model including a variable dust attenuation law, different gas-phase and stellar metallicities, a free ionization parameter for the nebular emission, and a nuisance parameter that scales the emission line fluxes. The latter parameter is important to account for possible slit-loss effects and physical effects such as LyC dust absorption and escape. We find that this factor is important: model-based emission line fluxes need to be rescaled by factors of 0.3-0.6, caused both by slit loss and astrophysical reasons (for example, escape of ionizing radiation). Overall, we find that we are able to reproduce the photometry and emission line measurements (Fig. 4 ). An exception is the emission line [O III ] 4364, which is brighter than predicted by our modelling, which could be attributed to non-stellar sources powering this line, to a conserv ati ve CLOUDY grid (too low ionization parameter values).Within the PROSPECTOR framework, we fit a 13-parameter model to NIRCam photometry and the NIRSpec emission lines.

        <p>We infer for all three galaxies rising SFHs and stellar masses of M ≈ 10 8 M (Fig. 5 and Table 1 ). These galaxies are all young with mass-weighted ages of t 50 = 3-4 Myr. Ho we ver, we find indications for underlying older stellar populations, implying that the SFHs extend at least over several tens of Myr. We emphasize that the SFHs, stellar masses, and stellar ages depend on the adopted SFH prior (Fig. 9 and Table 2 ): assuming a bursty SFH prior leads to younger, lower mass galaxies, which is consistent with previous studies (Tacchella et al. 2022c ;Whitler et al. 2023 ). Emission lines are helpful to constrain mainly the gas-phase metallicity and ionization parameter, and only have a second-order effect on the inferred SFHs and ages (Fig. 8 and Table 2 ). This is because of the aforementioned rescaling of the emission lines, i.e. we are fitting for relative emission line strength and not their absolute strengths.

        <p>Focusing on metallicity, our SED-fitting approach (with masking the [O III ] 4364 line) delivers gas-phase metallicities consistent with the direct method from the [O III ] 4364 line from Curti et al. ( 2023 , fig. 6). We find no convincing trend between the gas-phase metallicity and the total sSFR (and stellar age) of the galaxies (Fig. 7 ). Ho we ver, Galaxy ID 04590 with the lowest gas-phase metallicity shows the highest star formation intensity as measured by the sSFR surface density sSFR ( sSFR ≈ 330 Gyr -1 kpc -2 ), i.e. this galaxy has very high SFR surface density ( SFR ≈ 22 M yr -1 kpc -2 ) for its stellar mass ( M ≈ 10 8 M ), indicating that this galaxy is vigorously forming stars in a very compact configuration. This is consistent with a scenario in which Galaxy ID 04590 is undergoing rapid accretion of pristine gas, which leads to a steeply rising SFH and a high (s)SFR surface density. Despite having a low gas-phase metallicity, the high A V can be explained by its compactness (i.e. high gas surface density). Consistent with this rapid inflow of pristine gas is the tentati ve e vidence of Z gas ࣠ Z . The two other galaxies (Galaxy IDs 06355 and 10612) with higher gas-phase metallicity show more complex multicomponent morphologies on kpc scales, indicating that their recent increase in SFRs is driven by mergers or internal, gravitational instabilities.Focusing on metallicity, our SED-fitting approach (with masking the [O III ] 4364 line) delivers gas-phase metallicities consistent with the direct method from the [O III ] 4364 line from Curti et al.

        <p>Another technical challenge is that the level-3 data products of the current Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) pipeline lead to unphysical ratios between the Balmer lines (e.g. H γ/H β; see e.g.Schaerer et al. 2022 ;Curti et al. 2023 ;Trump et al. 2023 ) -one key reason why we used the reprocessed data fromCurti et al.
