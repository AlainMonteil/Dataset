        <p>Migrating cells show a versatile repertoire of migration modes with remarkable plasticity, allowing them to switch between different migration strategies in response to changing environmental conditions and activation of distinct molecular pathways (Friedl and Alexander, 2011). In order to migrate, cells need to establish an axis of polarity prior to movement. This polarity ultimately manifests itself in a polarized architecture of the actomyosin network, which in turn drives cell locomotion through different mechanical principles: in mesenchymal migration, the cortical actomyosin network facilitates unidirectional movement via polarized actin polymerization at the leading edge, combined with myosin-based contraction at the cell rear to disassemble adhesion sites. Amoeboid cells, in contrast, show hetero-geneous shape and motility characteristics with actin-based protrusions, such as lamellipodia and pseudopodia and contraction-mediated protrusions, such as cellular blebs (La ¨mmermann and Sixt, 2009). Recent studies have suggested that propulsive forces in amoeboid cells are generated by cortical contractility and retrograde cortical flows (Blaser et al., 2006;Poincloux et al., 2011;Shih and Yamada, 2010), allowing movement even in the absence of specific adhesive coupling to the environment (La ¨mmermann and Sixt, 2009;Tozluo glu et al., 2013).Migrating cells show a versatile repertoire of migration modes with remarkable plasticity, allowing them to switch between different migration strategies in response to changing environmental conditions and activation of distinct molecular pathways (Friedl and Alexander, 2011).

        <p>During zebrafish gastrulation, progenitor cells become motile and undergo extensive migration to form the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm germ layers. While ectodermal progenitors assemble in a pseudo-epithelial cell layer, mesodermal and endodermal (mesendodermal) progenitor cells display a highly motile mesenchymal phenotype with a mixture of lamellipodia and bleb-like protrusions (Row et al., 2011). Interfering with the ratio of those protrusion types has been shown to lower the directionality but not the speed of their migration (Diz-Mun ˜oz et al., 2010). Besides mesendodermal progenitors, primordial germ cells (PGCs) also undergo extensive migration during gastrulation but nearly exclusively use bleb-like protrusions for their migration (Blaser et al., 2006). Although using different protrusion types, migration speed and directionality of PGCs and mesendodermal progenitors appear surprisingly similar (Blaser et al., 2006;Diz-Mun ˜oz et al., 2010), raising questions as to the choice and benefit of certain protrusion types over others for the migration of the different progenitor cell types during gastrulation.During zebrafish gastrulation, progenitor cells become motile and undergo extensive migration to form the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm germ layers.

        <p>Here, we have studied different migration phenotypes during zebrafish gastrulation and identified a cortical contractility-mediated cell-intrinsic motility switch to fast amoeboid migration in 3D environments, which we termed stable-bleb migration.Here, we have studied different migration phenotypes during zebrafish gastrulation and identified a cortical contractility-mediated cell-intrinsic motility switch to fast amoeboid migration in 3D environments, which we termed stable-bleb migration.</p>
        <p>To study the emergence of migration competence in early germ layer progenitor cells, we aimed at developing in vitro assays to investigate the complex range of migration behaviors observed in vivo under controlled conditions with a minimal set of defined environmental parameters. Early progenitor cells placed on 2D substrates displayed a characteristic blebbing morphology that can also be observed in early blastula stage embryos in vivo (Diz-Mun ˜oz et al., 2010). Notably, those blebbing cells failed to migrate irrespective of adhesive substrate coating with extracellular matrix (ECM) components, such as Laminin or Fibronectin (Figure 1A; Movie S1 available online). However, when progenitor cells were induced to be of mesodermal or mesendodermal origin and placed on Fibronectin-coated substrates, they formed a characteristic mixture of lamellipodia and filopodia (Figure 1B) and underwent collective migration with similar speed (&lt;v Cell &gt; = 3.8 ± 0.3 mm/min) to their movement in vivo (Figure 1B 0 ; Movie S1).To study the emergence of migration competence in early germ layer progenitor cells, we aimed at developing in vitro assays to investigate the complex range of migration behaviors observed in vivo under controlled conditions with a minimal set of defined environmental parameters.

        <p>Strikingly, when adding serum to the culture medium, we observed unexpected changes in progenitor cell architecture with cells displaying a highly polarized cell morphology charac-terized by a stable pear-like shape and a large spherical protrusion front (Figure 1C). These cells, which we termed stable-bleb cells, were non-motile when plated on adhesive 2D substrates, but became highly migratory in confined environments (Figure 1C 0 ; Movie S1). Thus, in the presence of serum, progenitors transformed into a novel migration mode in vitro, clearly distinct from previously described lamellipodia-, filopodia-, and blebbased migration types (Figure 1D).Strikingly, when adding serum to the culture medium, we observed unexpected changes in progenitor cell architecture with cells displaying a highly polarized cell morphology charac-terized by a stable pear-like shape and a large spherical protrusion front (Figure 1C).

        <p>To investigate the molecular basis underlying this transformation, we first asked which serum components are involved. While adding serum growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), or epidermal growth factor (EGF), to the culture medium was not sufficient to induce stable-bleb cells (Figure S1A), we observed a fast and robust transformation when lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) was added (Figures 2A and S1B), a serum phospholipid known to activate cortical contractility via the Rho/Rock pathway (Mills and Moolenaar, 2003).To investigate the molecular basis underlying this transformation, we first asked which serum components are involved.

        <p>Polarization was stable in the presence of LPA, but cells switched rapidly back into their original blebbing behavior upon dilution of LPA from the culture medium, indicating that LPA-mediated transformation of progenitors into stable-bleb cells is a reversible process (Figure S1C). Furthermore, cell polarization was observed in suspension at homogenous levels of LPA (Movie S2) suggesting that cell transformation occurs in the absence of extrinsic gradients of biochemical or environmental polarity cues and arguing in favor of a cell intrinsic stochastic polarization mechanism induced by LPA.Polarization was stable in the presence of LPA, but cells switched rapidly back into their original blebbing behavior upon dilution of LPA from the culture medium, indicating that LPA-mediated transformation of progenitors into stable-bleb cells is a reversible process (Figure S1C).

        <p>Surprisingly, transformation into stable-bleb cells could be triggered in progenitor cells from blastula and gastrula stages irrespective of their primary cell fate (Figure 2B) as determined by dissociating cells from Tg(mezzo:eGFP) transgenic embryos expressing eGFP in mesendodermal progenitor cells. We thus reasoned that the motile switch occurred independently of a cell-type-specific genetic module, but might rather be associated with a generic polarization mechanism retrievable in these cells.Surprisingly, transformation into stable-bleb cells could be triggered in progenitor cells from blastula and gastrula stages irrespective of their primary cell fate (Figure 2B) as determined by dissociating cells from Tg(mezzo:eGFP) transgenic embryos expressing eGFP in mesendodermal progenitor cells.

        <p>Given that LPA is known to activate cortical contractility via the Rho/Rock pathway, we hypothesized that a mechanical polarization mechanism of the cell cortex could trigger the transformation of progenitor cells into stable-bleb cells (Carvalho et al., 2013). To test this hypothesis, we treated stable-bleb cells with the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 or the myosin-II inhibitor Blebbistatin (Figure 2C). Treated cells lost their characteristic polarization, supporting a critical role for Rho/Rock-mediated cortical contractility in driving stable-bleb cell transformation.Given that LPA is known to activate cortical contractility via the Rho/Rock pathway, we hypothesized that a mechanical polarization mechanism of the cell cortex could trigger the transformation of progenitor cells into stable-bleb cells (Carvalho et al., 2013).

        <p>To address the effect of LPA stimulation on stable-bleb cell polarization, we monitored the distribution of cortical markers in the presence of different LPA concentrations. Myosin II rapidly redistributed to the cell cortex upon LPA stimulation (t 1/2 $20 s, Figure 2D), and rising LPA concentrations were associated with increasing cortical accumulations of myosin II, eventually saturating at a threshold level at which progenitors transformed into stable-bleb cells (Figures 2E and2F). Importantly, the accumulation of myosin II at the cortex was up to seven times larger than the accumulation of actin, indicating that myosin II-mediated cortical contractility was specifically elevated upon LPA stimulation (Figures 2G andS1D). Furthermore, bleb sizes in dissociated progenitor cells closely scaled with the concentrations of LPA in the medium (Figures 2E and2H), suggesting that LPA upregulates cortical contractility and enhances bleb expansion by increasing intracellular pressure.To address the effect of LPA stimulation on stable-bleb cell polarization, we monitored the distribution of cortical markers in the presence of different LPA concentrations.

        <p>Interestingly, we observed that strong spatial confinement of progenitor cells in serum-free medium also led to elevated levels of myosin II accumulation at the cortex, larger blebs, and stochastic transformation into stable-bleb cells (Figures 2I-2K). In mesenchymal cells, this transformation was typically preceded by an increase in the formation of cellular blebs at the expense of lamellipodia and filopodia (Figure 2L). Together, these results imply that increasing levels of myosin-II mediated cortical contractility by either biochemical or physical stimuli can trigger a rapid and reversible amoeboid transformation of non-polarized and mesenchymal progenitors (Figure 2M; Movie S3) that is accompanied with extensive remodeling of cortical architecture and myosin II localization in those cells. Notably, a similar mesenchymal-to-amoeboid transition (MAT) has been observed in various culture cell types upon compression (see Liu et al. [2015] in this issue of Cell), suggesting that contractility-induced MAT is a universal mechanism retrievable in various primary and culture cell types.Interestingly, we observed that strong spatial confinement of progenitor cells in serum-free medium also led to elevated levels of myosin II accumulation at the cortex, larger blebs, and stochastic transformation into stable-bleb cells (Figures 2I-2K).

        <p>Based on these experimental results, we hypothesized that rapid changes in cortical architecture by increasing levels of cortical contractility mediate a cell intrinsic transformation into stablebleb cells. To address this hypothesis, we developed a theoretical description of the polarization process by modeling cortex structures and associated cell shapes as a function of cortical contractility (see Extended Experimental Procedures). In this model, the cell cortex was treated as a thin spherical shell of compressible active gel (Callan-Jones and Voituriez, 2013;Hawkins et al., 2011) (Figure S2A). Assuming homogenous bulk polymerization and depolymerization rates, we precluded a predetermined symmetry break of the cortical layer. Instead, we treated blebbing events in unpolarized progenitor cells as random spatial fluctuations in cortical contractility (Figure 3A), an assumption supported by measurements of the spatial extent (bleb size) and amplitude of cortical instabilities (myosin II enrichment) during cell blebbing at increasing LPA levels (Figures S2B and S2C). Notably, our model predicted that above a threshold level of cortical contractility these local instabilities would not relax but be amplified, eventually transforming an initially homogenous cortex layer into a polarized steady state characterized by a stable cortical density gradient along with retrograde cortical flows (Figures 3B andS2D).Based on these experimental results, we hypothesized that rapid changes in cortical architecture by increasing levels of cortical contractility mediate a cell intrinsic transformation into stablebleb cells.

        <p>Indeed, time-lapse imaging of myosin II localization during cell polarization in LPA stimulated progenitor cells confirmed a rapid myosin II re-localization to the cortex and strongly increasing bleb sizes prior to polarization, consistent with elevated levels of cortical contractility fluctuations and an increasing imbalance in contractile forces between the bleb and cellular cortical network (Figure 3C; Movie S4). Stabilization of blebs was initiated by the appearance of directional cortical flows from the weak actomyosin-network assembling underneath the bleb toward the cell cortex, which resulted in a failure of bleb retraction and ultimately led to stable cell polarization (Movie S4). To test whether ectopically increased levels of contractility can trigger cell polarization, we generated a localized LPA diffusion gradient by a micropipette (Figure 3D). Progenitor cells in the presence of this LPA gradient rapidly transformed into stable-bleb cells with their contractile back oriented toward the source of LPA (Figures 3E,3F,and S2E). This suggests that external gradients of LPA can trigger directional cell polarization by inducing an asymmetric contraction of the cortical cytoskeleton in agreement with theoretical modeling.Indeed, time-lapse imaging of myosin II localization during cell polarization in LPA stimulated progenitor cells confirmed a rapid myosin II re-localization to the cortex and strongly increasing bleb sizes prior to polarization, consistent with elevated levels of cortical contractility fluctuations and an increasing imbalance in contractile forces between the bleb and cellular cortical network (Figure 3C; Movie S4).

        <p>positive feedback loop between cortical contractility gradients and the presence of cortical flows (Bois et al., 2011;Hawkins et al., 2011). In this positive feedback, cortical flows reinforce density gradients, in particular rearward localization of myosin II, and thereby reinforce contractility gradients that drive cortical flow toward the contractile region (Figure 3G). High resolution TIRF imaging of cortical actin and myosin II in polarized progenitor cells confirmed the presence of stable cortical density gradients toward the cell rear and revealed a low density actomyosin network in the spherical protrusion front (Figures 4A, 4B, S3A, and S3B). This sparse actomyosin meshwork was reminiscent of a bleb-like membrane blister but, unlike blebs, was accompanied by an unusually fast and continuous cortical actomyosin flow, referred to as cortical flow in the following, with maximal flow speeds up to 150 mm/min in the very cell front (Figures 4A, 4C, S3C, and S3D). Measurement of cortical flows along with cortical density profiles allowed for calculating cortex flux and cortex turnover rate (Figure 4D), indicating net polymerization in the spherical protrusion front and de-polymerization toward the rear. As a continuous rearward cortex flux requires permanent cortex turnover, stable-bleb cell polarization was rapidly lost upon treatment with the G-actin sequestering drug Latrunculin A or Jasplakinolide, a drug that interferes with cortex turnover (Figures 2C andS1E; Movie S2). Moreover, treatment with the myosin II inhibitor Blebbistatin also reversed cell polarization (Figure 2C), indicating that cortical flow in combination with a gradient in contractility is critical for maintaining stable-bleb cell polarization over time. In contrast, inhibition of CDC42 (ML-141) or PI3Kinase (L-294002), previously shown to be required for mesendodermal progenitor cell migration in vivo (Montero et al., 2003), did not affect stable-bleb cell polarization (Figure S2F), supporting the concept that stable-bleb cell motility is unrelated to actin driven protrusion types such as lamellipodia or filopodia. Collectively, our results support a simple mechanical model of stochastic cell polarization based on the amplification of local fluctuations in cortical contractility and a positive feedback mechanism between contractility gradients and continuous cortical flows maintaining polarity in stable-bleb cells (Figure 3H).positive feedback loop between cortical contractility gradients and the presence of cortical flows (Bois et al., 2011;Hawkins et al., 2011).

        <p>To determine how the polarized cortical scaffold in stable-bleb cells connects to their characteristic shape, we expanded our theoretical model to calculate cell shapes based on deforma-tions of the cytoplasm due to compressive and shear stresses at the cytoplasmic surface arising from cortical tension and flow-friction (Behrndt et al., 2012) (Figures S3E and S3F). The cytoplasm was modeled as a viscoelastic medium with residual elastic response at long times (Tinevez et al., 2009), which is the regime of interest for discussing steady-state shapes. While measured actomyosin density gradients serve as a readout of cortical contractility, cortical tension in general is related not only to contractility but also to viscous forces arising from flow (Mayer et al., 2010) and flow-induced filament alignment (Salbreux et al., 2009). Using experimentally determined cortical density profiles we calculated shapes for two different cases: In the first case, we assumed an isotropic tension resulting in flattened, bulbous cell shapes not matching our experimental observations (Figure 4G, bottom). In the second case, we included viscous forces leading to tension reduction along the flow direction. Such tension anisotropy resulted in elongated pear shapes closely mirroring the observed shapes of stablebleb cells (Figure 4G,top). In support of our theoretical predictions, we observed a preferential alignment of actin filaments perpendicular to the front-to-rear axis of stable-bleb cells, highlighting the presence of anisotropic tension within the cortex (Figures S3I-S3K). Finally, we tested whether stable-bleb cell shapes depend on cortical viscosity and cell stiffness (Figures 4H andS3G) and used osmotic shock experiments to alter intracellular pressure and, consequently, cell stiffness. Consistent with our theoretical predictions, we found that decreasing intracellular pressure resulted in more elongated cell shapes (Figure S3H). Together, our theoretical considerations suggest that the characteristic pear-shape morphology of stable-bleb cells is generated by anisotropic tension in the cell cortex, which acts as a belt-like constriction unit applying compressive forces normal to the axis of polarization.To determine how the polarized cortical scaffold in stable-bleb cells connects to their characteristic shape, we expanded our theoretical model to calculate cell shapes based on deforma-tions of the cytoplasm due to compressive and shear stresses at the cytoplasmic surface arising from cortical tension and flow-friction (Behrndt et al., 2012) (Figures S3E and S3F).

        <p>To study the migratory behavior of polarized stable-bleb cells, we monitored their motility in different environments (Figure 5A). Stable-bleb cells only weakly adhered to and failed to migrate on 2D adhesive substrates coated with ECM components, such as Laminin and Fibronectin. Fluorescence imaging of the subcellular distribution of molecules associated with coupling the cortex to the surrounding substrate, such as N-Cadherin, Ezrin, and Integrin revealed a highly asymmetric accumulation toward the cell rear, while the bleb-like protrusion front was largely devoid of those molecules (Figures 5B and5C). This indicates only weak adhesive forces in the front that are insufficient for forward locomotion on 2D substrates. To increase frictional coupling of migrating cells, we thus created a planar 2D confine-ment by placing cells between a coated glass substrate and an agarose layer. We found that stable-bleb cells plated on Fibronectin-coated substrates under confinement displayed exceptionally fast and directional movements with average cell speed &lt;v cell &gt; = 17.1 ± 0.6 mm/min (n = 67 cells) and persistence length of approximately four cell diameters (Figures 5E and 5F To test the role of specific versus unspecific adhesion, we monitored stable-bleb cell migration in various adhesive and non-adhesive environments using a modified assay that consists of two parallel glass slides coated with either Fibronectin, poly-L-lysine (PLL), BSA, or polyethyleneglycol (PEG) separated by 15-mm beads. Surprisingly, stable-bleb cells were highly motile under all conditions with their migration efficacy increasing in non-adhesive environments (Figure 5G). To monitor the formation of adhesive foci in stable-bleb cells during migration, we further imaged Paxillin-GFP, an adaptor protein known to be involved in Integrin-mediated force transduction and focal adhesion assembly in motile cells (Turner, 2000). When stable-bleb cells were placed between Fibronectin-coated surfaces, Paxillin-GFP localized in distinct spots at cell-substrate contacts similar to mesenchymal mesodermal cells cultured on 2D planar Fibronectin-coated substrates, while Paxillin-GFP appeared homogeneously distributed on non-adhesive BSA and PEG-coated surfaces (Figures 5H-5K). This suggests that stable-bleb cells are able to generate both Integrin-dependent and independent surface attachments during migration. To further investigate the role of cell-substrate versus cell-cell adhesion, we also reduced E-Cadherin expression in stable-bleb cells by injecting antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) and found that E-Cadherin is dispensable for cell migration in vitro irrespective of the substrate coating (Figure S4F). Together, these data support that stable-bleb cells are able to generate both specific and unspecific traction forces during migration, highlighting their versatile migration competence in various adhesive and nonadhesive environments.To study the migratory behavior of polarized stable-bleb cells, we monitored their motility in different environments (Figure 5A). Stable-bleb cells only weakly adhered to and failed to migrate on 2D adhesive substrates coated with ECM components, such as Laminin and Fibronectin. Fluorescence imaging of the subcellular distribution of molecules associated with coupling the cortex to the surrounding substrate, such as N-Cadherin, Ezrin, and Integrin revealed a highly asymmetric accumulation toward the cell rear, while the bleb-like protrusion front was largely devoid of those molecules (Figures 5B and5C). This indicates only weak adhesive forces in the front that are insufficient for forward locomotion on 2D substrates. To increase frictional coupling of migrating cells, we thus created a planar 2D confine-ment by placing cells between a coated glass substrate and an agarose layer. We found that stable-bleb cells plated on Fibronectin-coated substrates under confinement displayed exceptionally fast and directional movements with average cell speed &lt;v cell &gt; = 17.1 ± 0.6 mm/min (n = 67 cells) and persistence length of approximately four cell diameters (Figures 5E and 5F To test the role of specific versus unspecific adhesion, we monitored stable-bleb cell migration in various adhesive and non-adhesive environments using a modified assay that consists of two parallel glass slides coated with either Fibronectin, poly-L-lysine (PLL), BSA, or polyethyleneglycol (PEG) separated by 15-mm beads. Surprisingly, stable-bleb cells were highly motile under all conditions with their migration efficacy increasing in non-adhesive environments (Figure 5G). To monitor the formation of adhesive foci in stable-bleb cells during migration, we further imaged Paxillin-GFP, an adaptor protein known to be involved in Integrin-mediated force transduction and focal adhesion assembly in motile cells (Turner, 2000). When stable-bleb cells were placed between Fibronectin-coated surfaces, Paxillin-GFP localized in distinct spots at cell-substrate contacts similar to mesenchymal mesodermal cells cultured on 2D planar Fibronectin-coated substrates, while Paxillin-GFP appeared homogeneously distributed on non-adhesive BSA and PEG-coated surfaces (Figures 5H-5K).

        <p>To understand this efficient and persistent motile behavior, we asked how stable-bleb cells move in 2D confined environments. Depletion of cortical elements in the cell front (Figure 4A) and the diffuse zone of actin net polymerization in the spherical front (Figure 4D), exclude a classical polymerization-driven locomotion strategy, where polymerizing actin filaments push the leading edge plasma membrane forward. However, the presence of fast retrograde cortical flows led us to hypothesize that coupling of the flowing actin network to the surrounding substrate powers stable-bleb cell migration under 2D confinement. To test this hypothesis, we performed high-resolution live cell imaging of retrograde cortical flows in stable-bleb cells in confinement under agarose. Motile stable-bleb cells on adhesive Fibronectin-coated substrates showed a rapid decay of flow velocities toward the cell rear with a pronounced zone of zero flow speed (Figures 6A-6F and 6H; Movie S5). In contrast, non-motile stable-bleb cells that were placed on passivated PEG-coated substrates revealed considerably different retrograde flow profiles with similar maximal flow velocities to motile cells in the cell front, but a slower decay of flow speeds to the cell rear (Figures 6G andS3D). Using a 1D fluid description of the cortex, we estimated from those cortical flow profiles a higher frictional coefficient x on adhesive in comparison to non-adhesive surfaces (x adhesive x 2.8 3 10 8 Pa 3 s/m versus x non-adhesive x 1 3 10 8 Pa 3 s/m; Figures S4A-S4C). Furthermore, osmotic shock experiments revealed that cortical flows are progressively decreased for lower levels of intracellular pressure and that these changes in cortical flow velocity strongly correlate with cell migration speed (Figures S4D andS4E). These findings support the notion that coupling of the cortex to the surrounding substrate leads to a reduction of cortical flow in motile cells, providing the necessary forward traction force required for cell movement.To understand this efficient and persistent motile behavior, we asked how stable-bleb cells move in 2D confined environments.

        <p>To study the motile switch and migration characteristics of stable-bleb cells in vivo, we first aimed to ectopically transform cells in the early zebrafish blastula by elevating their cortical contractility. To this end, we expressed a constitutively active version of RhoA (caRhoA) (Takesono et al., 2012) in single progenitor cells and performed two-photon imaging of their morphology and migration properties in the gastrulating embryo. CaRhoA expressing cells in vivo showed high blebbing rates and pronounced cortical myosin accumulations similar to LPA-stimulated progenitor cells in vitro (Figure 7A). Moreover, caRhoAexpressing cells frequently transformed into motile cells closely resembling stable-bleb cells in vitro displaying a pear-shape, pronounced cortical actin and myosin II gradients and rearward cortical flows of similar magnitude as found in vitro (v cortex $30 mm/min; Figures 7B and S5A-S5C; Movie S6). To further test whether caRhoA expressing progenitor cells in vivo indeed resemble stable-bleb cells in vitro, we transferred them into (legend continued on next page) culture and found that they exhibited a morphology and migration behavior indistinguishable from LPA-induced stable-bleb cells in vitro (Figures S4G-S4J). This suggests that upregulation of cortical contractility through expression of caRhoA is sufficient to transform progenitor cells into motile stable-bleb cells in vivo.To study the motile switch and migration characteristics of stable-bleb cells in vivo, we first aimed to ectopically transform cells in the early zebrafish blastula by elevating their cortical contractility.

        <p>To unravel the role of cell-cell adhesion for adhesive force coupling during stable-bleb cell motility in vivo, we downregulated E-Cadherin expression in caRhoA expressing embryos by injecting specific e-Cadherin MOs. Upon transplantation of those cells into a wild-type host we found that E-Cadherin was dispensable for stable-bleb migration in vivo and even led to an increase of cell dispersal compared to caRhoA expressing cells with normal levels of E-Cadherin .To unravel the role of cell-cell adhesion for adhesive force coupling during stable-bleb cell motility in vivo, we downregulated E-Cadherin expression in caRhoA expressing embryos by injecting specific e-Cadherin MOs.

        <p>We next sought to address if stable-bleb cells also emerge in the endogenous context of embryonic development. Timelapse movies of cell movements within the gastrulating embryo occasionally revealed single fast migrating amoeboid cells reminiscent of stable-bleb cells (see Movie S7). However, since it was impossible to predict where and when in the gastrulating embryo these cells appear, we reasoned that locally increasing cortical contractility within the gastrulating embryo might trigger stable-bleb cell transformation. Wounding sites have previously been shown to display elevated levels of actomyosin contractility (Sonnemann and Bement, 2011). To test if stable-bleb cells emerge at local wounding sites within the gastrulating embryo, we transplanted fluorescently labeled donor cells into an unlabeled host embryo at sphere stage (4 hr post fertilization [hpf]) (Figures 7C and7D). Using Tg(actb1:myl12.1eGFP) donor embryos, elevated cortical accumulations of myosin II were detected around the wounding area (Movie S8) and, interestingly, labeled donor cells stochastically transformed into stable-bleb like cells with a highly polarized cortical architecture and fast retrograde cortical flows similar to their morphology in vitro (Figure 7E; Movie S8). Transformed cells migrated away from the region of transplantation with speed (v = 8.5 ± 0.3 mm/min) and directionality much higher than any other cells yet described in the zebrafish embryo (Figures 7F and7G). Together, this indicates that stable-bleb motility can be induced at places of high contractility within the gastrulating embryo, suggesting a mechanism for rapid cell extrusion from highly contractile regions within the embryo. To further test this assumption, we prepared tissue explants from early blastula stage embryos and cultured them in LPA containing medium. We found that marginal cells in tissue explants not only rapidly transformed into stable-bleb cells, as expected for progenitors, but also frequently extruded from the explant surface (Figure 7I). This suggests that stable-bleb cells can overcome the surface tension of those tissue explants and freely disperse into the environment, supporting our notion of stable-bleb cell transformation as an efficient cell extrusion mechanism from contractile tissues.We next sought to address if stable-bleb cells also emerge in the endogenous context of embryonic development.

        <p>Here, we describe a stochastic amoeboid motility switch of early zebrafish progenitor cells into stable-bleb cells. Cell morphology and migration characteristics of stable-bleb cells show unique features in comparison to other motile cell types described before. The invariant roundish cortex-depleted front end of stable-bleb cells is clearly different from actin rich protrusions, such as lamellipodia and filopodia typically found in mesenchymal cells and also distinct from contractility-driven bleb protrusions that periodically appear in blebbing cells. We show that stable polarization of transformed progenitor cells is maintained by a positive feedback loop between cortical density gradients and continuous cortical flows, yielding a robust steady-state configuration with a highly polarized cortical architecture. Interestingly, we found that increasing cortical contractility is sufficient to switch progenitor cells from a blebbing or mesenchymal mode to a stably polarized state above a critical threshold level of contractility, and that this transformation is reversible upon lowering myosin II activity below a critical threshold level. This indicates that the level of cortical contractility determines whether cells migrate by forming either transient protrusions, such as blebs and lamellipodia, or one stably polarized front thereby increasing their migration persistence and efficacy. Supported by theoretical modeling of progenitor transformation into stable-bleb cells, it further suggests that this process does not require an elaborate genetic program, but rather occurs as a simple mechanical switch triggered by increased cortical contractility. This generic polarization module can likely be activated via diverse cellular pathways such as microtubule disassembly-dependent activation of the Rho/ROCK pathway (Niggli, 2003) and could thus be a potentially effective polarization mechanism also functional in other cell types. Notably, findings in various culture cell lines suggest that high spatial confinement combined with low substrate adhesion is sufficient to trigger an amoeboid cell transformation strikingly similar to stable-bleb cells (see Liu et al., 2015). Together, these data suggest that the regulation of cortical contractility might serve as a universal switch for transforming cells into an amoeboid cell migration mode characterized by fast and highly directional migration in 3D confinement.Here, we describe a stochastic amoeboid motility switch of early zebrafish progenitor cells into stable-bleb cells.

        <p>Spatially confined environments promote stable-bleb cell migration by providing compressive forces that increase frictional coupling required for efficient locomotion. Moreover, retrograde cortical flows are sufficient to drive stable-bleb cell migration in both adhesive and non-adhesive confined environments. Similar flow-friction mechanisms have recently been proposed to drive locomotion of various cell types in confinement (Hawkins et al., 2009;Liu et al., 2015), suggesting that force-coupling via retrograde cortical flows might constitute a general mechanism of cell movement especially in low adhesive 3D environments.Spatially confined environments promote stable-bleb cell migration by providing compressive forces that increase frictional coupling required for efficient locomotion.

        <p>During gastrulation cell motility needs to be precisely controlled and spatio-temporally regulated. Recent studies have pointed at important functions of small Rho GTPases in cell migration during zebrafish gastrulation (Matthews et al., 2008;Kardash et al., 2010). Our observation that LPA, a RhoAactivating signal ubiquitously expressed during zebrafish gastrulation (Lee et al., 2008;Yukiura et al., 2011), can transform progenitor cells into stable-bleb cells, reveals a yet unrecognized function of RhoA in the control of cell migration during gastrulation and points at LPA as one potential regulator determining stable-bleb cell induction during gastrulation. However, given the large number of known signals with RhoA activating capacity, a systematic functional analysis of these signals will be needed to dissect the upstream regulation of stable-bleb cell transformation during gastrulation.During gastrulation cell motility needs to be precisely controlled and spatio-temporally regulated.

        <p>As to the function of stable-bleb cells in gastrulation, we observed stable-bleb cell transformation at areas of high cell contractility, such as wounding sites, followed by rapid dispersal of those cells. This suggests that stable-bleb transformation serves as a mechanism for cell extrusion from areas of increased contractility in the embryo. This might help in equilibrating contractility-driven cell density variations, but might also be used as a mean of long-range communication where extruding stable-bleb cells rapidly transmit signals from areas of high contractility to the remainder of the embryo. Our observation of stable-bleb cell extrusion from tissue explants along with observations of a similar migration phenotype in various cancer cell lines (see Liu et al., 2015) also points at the intriguing possibility that stable-bleb cells might be involved in other contexts such as cancer metastasis where cancer cells disseminate from the primary tumor into unaffected tissues. Thus, stable-bleb cell transformation identifies a yet unrecognized mechanism for rapid and long-range cell dispersal in vertebrates.As to the function of stable-bleb cells in gastrulation, we observed stable-bleb cell transformation at areas of high cell contractility, such as wounding sites, followed by rapid dispersal of those cells.
