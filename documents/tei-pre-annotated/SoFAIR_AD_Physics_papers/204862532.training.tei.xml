        <p>A search for heavy Majorana neutrinos in events containing a pair of high-p T leptons of the same charge and high-p T jets is presented. The search uses 20.3 fb -1 of pp collision data collected with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider with a centre-of-mass energy of √ s = 8 TeV. The data are found to be consistent with the background-only hypothesis based on the Standard Model expectation. In the context of a Type-I seesaw mechanism, limits are set on the production cross-section times branching ratio for production of heavy Majorana neutrinos in the mass range between 100 and 500 GeV. The limits are subsequently interpreted as limits on the mixing between the heavy Majorana neutrinos and the Standard Model neutrinos. In the context of a left-right symmetric model, limits on the production cross-section times branching ratio are set with respect to the masses of heavy Majorana neutrinos and heavy gauge bosons W R and Z .A search for heavy Majorana neutrinos in events containing a pair of high-p T leptons of the same charge and high-p T jets is presented.

        <p>Heavy Majorana neutrinos with masses above 50 GeV are considered. In this regime, the production and subsequent decay of heavy Majorana neutrinos could lead to a final state containing exactly two charged leptons, where the leptons may have the same or opposite charge in equal fractions of the heavy neutrino decays. Only lepton pairs of the same charge (same-sign) are considered as there is a smaller expected SM background for pairs of same-sign leptons than for pairs of leptons of opposite charge (opposite-sign). The search includes the ee and µµ final states. The search is guided by two theoretical models. In the first model, the SM is extended in the simplest way to include right-handed neutrinos [8], such that light neutrino masses are generated by a Type-I seesaw mechanism or by radiative corrections [9]. In this minimal Type-I seesaw mechanism (mTISM), the heavy Majorana neutrinos, N , can be produced via an off-shell W boson, pp → (W ± ) * → ± N . Due to previous limits [10,11], the heavy neutrino is assumed to be more massive than the W boson and therefore subsequently decays to an on-shell W boson and a lepton. The on-shell W boson produced in the decay of the heavy neutrino predominantly decays into a quark-antiquark (q q) pair. The final state in this case contains two opposite-sign or same-sign leptons and at least two high-p T jets, where p T is the transverse momentum with respect to the beam direction. 1 The tree-level process is illustrated in figure 1.

        <p>Both the mTISM and LRSM models produce final states containing two same-sign leptons and high-p T jets, but the kinematic characteristics of the events are quite different. In the mTISM final state, one can reconstruct the resonant SM W boson from the jets originating from the tree-level q q pair, whereas in the LRSM final states, one can instead reconstruct the masses of the heavy gauge bosons. Furthermore, the energy scales of the two models are largely separate. The energy scale of mTISM final states is set by the heavy neutrino mass, which, based on the LEP constraints [10,11], is assumed to be greater than 100 GeV. Instead, the energy scale of LRSM final states is set by the masses of the heavy bosons, which, motivated by the earlier heavy neutrino searches, are assumed to be greater than 400 GeV. For these reasons, the event selection criteria are optimised separately for each model, although a common object selection is used in both cases.Both the mTISM and LRSM models produce final states containing two same-sign leptons and high-p T jets, but the kinematic characteristics of the events are quite different.

        <p>The ATLAS detector [19] surrounds the interaction point and covers nearly the entire solid angle. The detector consists of an inner detector (ID) tracking system, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer (MS) that surrounds the other detector systems. The ID tracking system consists of a silicon pixel detector, a silicon microstrip tracker, both covering |η| &lt; 2.5, and a transition radiation tracker covering |η| &lt; 2.0. The ID tracker is immersed in a 2 T axial magnetic field provided by a superconducting solenoid magnet. The electromagnetic accordion calorimeter is composed of lead and liquidargon (LAr) and provides coverage for |η| &lt; 3.2. Hadronic calorimetry is provided by steel and scintillator tile calorimeters for |η| &lt; 1.7 and copper and LAr calorimeters for 1.5 &lt; |η| &lt; 3.2. Additional LAr calorimeters with copper and tungsten absorbers cover the forward region. The MS consists of dedicated trigger chambers covering |η| &lt; 2.4 and precision tracking detectors covering |η| &lt; 2.7. A system of three superconducting toroids (one in the barrel, two in the end-caps), with eight coils each, provides the magnetic field for the MS. A three-level trigger system is used to collect the data. The first-level trigger (L1) is implemented in hardware, using a subset of detector information to reduce the event rate to no more than 75 kHz. This is followed by two software-based trigger levels (L2 and EF), which together further reduce the event rate to less than 1 kHz.The ATLAS detector [19] surrounds the interaction point and covers nearly the entire solid angle.

        <p>There are several SM interactions that can produce pairs of isolated charged leptons from vector boson decays, specifically from Drell-Yan and diboson processes and also from the decay products of top quarks. These processes are modelled using events produced by Monte Carlo (MC) generators. A summary of the primary MC generators used in this paper to model the background processes is presented in table 1. Processes that contribute to the background with pairs of same-sign leptons are indicated by the label 'SS' and processes which contribute with pairs of opposite-sign leptons, which are included in the charge-misidentification background estimate (section 5.2), are indicated by the label 'OS'. The MC samples are normalised using the best available theoretical cross-sections, typically next-to-leading order or next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD.There are several SM interactions that can produce pairs of isolated charged leptons from vector boson decays, specifically from Drell-Yan and diboson processes and also from the decay products of top quarks.

            <rs type="version">.170</rs> generator [29] is used to generate LRSM events at leading order in QCD. It is assumed in the model that the coupling between heavy gauge bosons and the heavy neutrino is equal to the coupling between the respective SM gauge bosons and light neutrinos. Similarly, the couplings of the new gauge bosons and the quarks are assumed to be equal to the couplings between the SM gauge bosons and the quarks. In the 
            <rs type="software">Pythia</rs> implementation of this process, all of the decay products of heavy neutrinos are distributed isotropically and so the heavy neutrino decays are independent of m W R , with the assumption that m W R &gt; m N . In this approximation, the decay of the Z boson is also independent of m W R . The events are generated with W R boson masses between 0.6 TeV and 4.5 TeV and Z boson masses between 0.4 TeV and 3.6 TeV. At each Z and W R mass point, the heavy neutrino mass is varied upward from 50 GeV to at most 100 GeV below the mass of the heavy gauge boson. At each mass point, a sample is generated assuming no mixing between the heavy neutrinos, which results in final states containing same-flavour leptons {ee, µµ, τ τ }.

        <p>The background is evaluated in the signal regions according to three categories of lepton pairs. The first two categories describe the contribution due to leptons originating from SM processes that produce prompt isolated leptons. The first category, labelled as 'prompt' in the following and discussed in section 5.1, corresponds to irreducible background from true same-sign prompt lepton pairs. The second category, labelled as 'charge-flip' in the following and discussed in section 5.2, corresponds to true opposite-sign prompt lepton pairs, in which one lepton has its charge mismeasured. The third category, labelled as 'non-prompt' in the following and discussed in section 5.3, corresponds to one or both leptons being either a non-prompt lepton from semileptonic heavy-flavour decays, a jet misidentified as a lepton or, in the case of electrons, photons misidentified as leptons. The first category of background events are entirely estimated using the SS MC samples described in section 3, the second category is estimated using OS MC samples in conjunction with a measurement in the data of the charge misidentification rate and the third category is estimated from data.

The contribution to these events from fake and non-prompt electrons (see section 5.3) is subtracted from the data sample prior to the fit. The measured rate, which is strongly correlated to the amount of material traversed by the electron in the ID, is found to be approximately 10 -4 for electrons within the barrel region (|η| &lt; 1.0), increasing to 10 -2 at the edge of the detector acceptance (|η| = 2.47).

        <p>The background estimates and signal efficiencies are subject to several systematic uncertainties. The relative size of the uncertainties on the total background estimates in the mTISM and LRSM signal regions are detailed in tables 2 and 3 respectively. Since the tables show the size of each uncertainty relative to the total background estimate, the impact of each uncertainty depends on the background composition in the different channels (see section 7 and tables 4 and 5).The background estimates and signal efficiencies are subject to several systematic uncertainties.

The total uncertainty on the non-prompt background in the ee (µµ) channel varies from 30 -48% (41-45%), depending on the signal region. The charge-flip background is only relevant for the ee channel (see section 5.2) and its uncertainty is dominated by the statistical precision with which the charge-flip rate is determined from the available data. There is, additionally, a non-negligible contribution to the total uncertainty due to the modelling of the subtraction of the non-prompt background, although this is correlated with the uncertainty on the non-prompt background.

        <p>The uncertainty on the normalisation of the backgrounds originating from W Z and ZZ processes is derived from the diboson control region described in section 5.1. This uncertainty is taken to be either the difference between the data and the prediction or the statistical uncertainty from the limited data statistics, whichever is largest. The uncertainty is applied as a function of the number of jets, leading to uncertainties of 10-14%, depending on the signal region. The uncertainty on the cross-section of other background processes from MC estimates is taken from the uncertainties on the theoretical cross-sections.

        <p>The systematic uncertainty on the jet energy scale has an important effect on both the signal and background processes, as the signal-region event selection includes requirements on quantities that are reconstructed from jet kinematics [40]. The uncertainty on the jet energy scale is notably asymmetric in the mTISM signal region (table 2) compared to the LRSM signal region (table 3) due to the dependency on the leading dijet mass in the mTISM signal region definition described in section 4.4. The uncertainty due to the JES on the sum of the prompt and charge-flip backgrounds varies from 6 -28%, depending on the signal region. The modelling of the missing transverse momentum ('E miss T ') [46] is included as a systematic uncertainty in the mTISM signal region (table 2) as there is a dependence on this quantity in the signal region definition described in section 4.4. Other smaller systematic uncertainties include the uncertainty on the the jet energy resolution [47], the jet vertex fraction requirement, uncertainties on lepton identification efficiencies, energy / momentum scales and resolutions ('Lepton uncertainties') [35,36] and the uncertainty on the luminosity measurement ('Luminosity') [48].The systematic uncertainty on the jet energy scale has an important effect on both the signal and background processes, as the signal-region event selection includes requirements on quantities that are reconstructed from jet kinematics [40].

        <p>In addition to the uncertainties associated with the MC simulation of background processes, there are systematic modelling uncertainties associated with the signal MC samples. An uncertainty is considered for the signal MC simulation to reflect the choice of parton shower model. The nominal parton shower model that is used for all signal MC samples is Pythia 8.165. The total number of events in the signal region when the signal MC generator is interfaced to 
            <rs type="software">Pythia</rs> is compared to the number of events when the generator is interfaced to Herwig 6.520. The variation in the signal efficiency is measured to be approximately 5%. The uncertainty due to the parton distribution functions on the signal acceptance is found to be approximately 5% for the mTISM signal samples and approximately 7% for the LRSM signal samples.

        <p>The observed and predicted distributions of the invariant mass of the two highest-p T jets (m jj ) in events satisfying the mTISM selection criteria, excluding the criteria on m jj (60 GeV&lt; m jj &lt; 100 GeV) are presented in figure 7. The shapes of the distributions show good agreement between data and expectation. The numbers of expected and observed events in the mTISM signal region (indicated by arrows in figure 7) are shown in table 4. There is no excess of events relative to the expectation. The observed yields in the data are used to set 95% CL upper limits on the production cross-section times branching ratio, σ × Br(pp → ± N → ± ± q q ), of heavy neutrinos to electrons or muons, using the profile-likelihood test statistic [49] and the CL s method [50]. The systematic uncertainties are included in the test statistic as nuisance parameters. Each systematic uncertainty is assumed to be uncorrelated with all other systematic uncertainties. The limits are shown as a function of m N in figure 8 and are translated into limits on the mixing parameter, |V N | 2 , between the heavy neutrino and the SM neutrino, separately for the ee and µµ channels. The extraction of the limits on the mixing parameters uses the leading-order cross-section for the signal process and no uncertainties are included on the signal cross-section. The extraction furthermore assumes that only the lightest of the heavy neutrinos contributes to the cross-section and that the masses of the other heavy neutrino species are sufficiently high that the effect of interference is negligible.The observed and predicted distributions of the invariant mass of the two highest-p T jets (m jj ) in events satisfying the mTISM selection criteria, excluding the criteria on m jj (60 GeV&lt; m jj &lt; 100 GeV) are presented in figure 7.

        <p>The LRSM signal is expected to produce a peak in the invariant mass of the decay products of the heavy gauge boson. This would be observed in the invariant mass distribution m j(j) (m jj(jj) ) in the W R (Z ) signal regions, as described in section 4. The observed and predicted distributions are shown in figures 9 and 10. Binned likelihood fits are performed to the invariant mass distributions and the profile-likelihood test statistic is used to assess the compatibility of the data with the background-only and signal-plus-background hypotheses. No significant excess is observed in the data compared to the background expectation and 95% CL upper limits on the cross-section of the production of heavy gauge bosons decaying to heavy neutrinos within the LRSM are set using the CL s method. The expected and observed cross-section exclusion limits as a function of the masses of the heavy gauge bosons and heavy neutrino are shown for example mass points for both channels, ee and µµ, in table 6. The full cross-section limits for all analysed mass points are available in 
            <rs type="software">HepData</rs>. 3 Exclusion contours are also set in the {m V R , m N } plane, and are shown in figure 11. The contours are found by comparing the cross-section limits to the leading-order cross-sections for the signal processes and no uncertainties are included on the signal crosssections. For this interpretation there is assumed to be no mixing between lepton flavours and three cases are investigated: the first two cases assume a single heavy neutrino being kinematically accessible and being of either electron or muon flavour, which leads to events expected in one of the ee and µµ channels, respectively. The limits are stronger in the µµ channel at low heavy neutrino mass, due to the higher signal acceptance discussed in section 4.5. As the efficiency of the LRSM signal is low in the ee channel for m V R m N , the limit in this region is weaker. Finally the case where two degenerate neutrinos are present is investigated, leading to events expected in both the ee and µµ channels. The expected limits for this scenario are slightly stronger than either of the individual channel scenarios. The sharp changes in the expected and observed limits visible in figure 11 originate from the interpolation between the limited number of mass points for which the limits are extracted.
