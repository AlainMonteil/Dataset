        <p>Section 1: Principle of the detour phase in the meta-hologram The principle of the detour phase in the meta-hologram is shown in Fig. S1. Considering a monochromatic plane wave impinging on a metasurface with an identical periodicity and structural size, the phase retardation of diffraction light between any two adjacent nanostructures is expressed as</p>
        <p>a λ θ where is the distance between adjacent unit cells; is the incident wavelength; is the diffraction angle. The wavefront would not be modulated when the distance between two adjacent nanostructures is locally identical. As a result, by varying the distance , we can obtain variety of 0-2π phase distributions. Furthermore, these isotropic nanostructures can be extended to a two-dimensional periodic array and choose the period length . An interface seen by an observer standing at an angle θ from the normal can be discretized by sections of two perpendicular directions width , each of which can then be apertured to select a phase within the 2π range by adjusting the plasma circular pore position in each period. To form a hologram with two-dimensional phase distribution , the nanostructure position shift of the plasma circular pore to the center of its period in each unit cell is determined</p>
        <p>Finally, the desired phase distribution is obtained by a two-dimensional array with different location shifts . The generated holographic pattern is received at the diffraction angle</p>
        <p>θ 0 where is the oblique incidence angle. In general, detour-phase holograms are composed of many scatters (pixels) and each one is viable to realize a desirable phase delay. Thus, a metasurface is formed by a series of dislocated nanostructures to achieve the true phase-modulated holography.</p>
        <p>In our case, the isotropic nanostructures as a kind of basic and undecorated building blocks are studied for purely validating the spatial frequency orthogonality as a new degree of freedom. According to the Babinet's principle S1,S2 , nanoholes and nanodisks of known size and shape can be regarded as a pair of complementary building blocks. The diffraction patterns from complementary apertures and opaque bodies are quite similar except for the forward scattering intensity. In addition to the trade off between the ease of nanofabrication and diffraction efficiency, the reflective configuration is accordingly adopted.</p>
        <p>Section 2: Effect of gold film thickness and pore size on transmittance In order to optimize the structural parameters of the metasurface, we investigated the effect of the thickness of the gold film and the radius of the metal aperture on the transmittance. Figure S2 and Fig. S3 show the variation of the reflectance and transmittance in the wavelength range of 400-1100 nm for different thicknesses and apertures of the gold film. After analyzing the above results, the gold film with a thickness of h=200 nm and nanoholes with a radius of r=75 nm were selected for subsequent nanofabrication Section 3: Fabrication process of peristrophic multiplexing metasurface Quartz substrates (n=1.46) were first cleaned by acetone and isopropyl alcohol and then rinsed by deionized water.</p>
        <p>After blow-drying with nitrogen, the substrates were put into an electron beam evaporator chamber (The Nanochrome™ II) for 200 nm gold deposition with 10 nm chromium as adhesion. Finally, metasurfaces were patterned by directly focused ion beam milling (FEI Helios Nanolab 600 FIB-SEM) using a 9.7 pA beam (gallium ions) current with 30 kV accelerating voltage.</p>
        <p>Section 4: Convergence analysis of RMSE with different phase discrete levels The required phase profile for "H" and "V" have been calculated based on Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm. As the number of iterations rises under the constraint of various discretized phase levels, the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) function is introduced to monitor the quality of the resulting reconstruction image of the hologram. When the number of iterations is low, the RMSE between the initial and the retrieving image is relatively great. The reconstruction would exhibit a quick convergence and a stable trend as the number of iterations rises.</p>
        <p>Section 5: FDTD simulation results of transmitted and reflected of metasurface with different peristrophic angles</p>
        <p>The principle of peristrophic multiplexing can be explained that when the incident beam is a plane wave with a special spatial frequency, the distinguishing playback of holograms is attainable through the relative rotation around an axis normal to the sample. As shown in Fig. S5, different images are reconstructed by the off-axis observation taking place in the transmitted and reflected domains, whilst the metasurface is rotated around the rotation axes 1 and 2. Theoretically, the multiplexing metadevice has the ability to exhibit distinguishing holograms in both transmitted and reflected fields. Hence, the holographic results in two cases are exhibited by means of finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation. Noteworthy that, the position of the incident light at the initial position is set to remain coincident with the rotation axis 1. And the and indicate the rotation angle of the metasurface around the axis 1 and 2, respectively. Specifically, in the case where the incident spatial frequency light is kept constant, and . Besides the calculation based on the Fourier transform, the simulated results during the corresponding rotation can be done by the full-wave FDTD method. For the qualitative verification, the simulations of a low resolution (50*50 pixels) level were carried out. Section 7: Multiple-channel multiplexing using a synthetic peristrophic meta-hologram</p>
        <p>By adopting our method, a four-channel multiplexing metasurface in which all the information is highly integrated and encodes to the peristrophic angles of 0°, 45°, 90°, and 135° can be also realized. We combined the two-channel H/V and two-channel 0/1 multiplexing metasurfaces. The specific implementation process is shown in Fig. S7(a). The phase encoding of two pairs of target images H/V and 0/1 is done in two mutually perpendicular directions using the principle of detour phase encoding. Note that all the channels (Metasurface 1 and Metasurface 2) of the meta-holograms can be generated independently. Keeping the Metasurface 1 fixed, the Metasurface 2 is superimposed onto the Metasurface 1 after rotating through 45 degrees to create a new synthetic multiplexed metasurface. The schematic of the synthetic metasurface structure for quadruplexing is demonstrated in Fig. S7(b). In particular, the incident light maintains constant, the rotation angle to the axis 2 is fixed at 45°, the rotation angle to the axis 1 is 0°, 45°, 90°, 135° in the clockwise direction, and the reconstruction of "1", "H", "0", and "V" images can be observed in turns (Fig. S7(c)). Additionally, Fig. S7(d) displays the simulation results by means of FDTD solution, which is in line with the outcomes of the anticipated design.</p>
        <p>It should be noted that as the number of rotational multiplexing channels increases, the signal-to-noise ratio and isolation of the reconstructed target information of each channel will decrease significantly. This is primarily ascribed to the overlap or gap effect of adjacent building blocks during the stacking process. Reducing the crosstalk and enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio for peristrophic multiplexing metasurface would overcome in future. It is worth mentioning that, for the peristrophic multiplexing by the spatial frequency orthogonality, the two-channel holograms represent an excellent reconstruction performance. With the increase of multiplexing channels, the crosstalk will be inevitably introduced. Fig. S7 shows the four-channel multiplexing results using a synthetic peristrophic meta-hologram with four rotation angles. For further improving the multiplexing dimensionality, the synthetic strategy should be exploited. By integrating the wavelength, phase, polarization or OAM degree of freedom into the multitasked metadevices S3,S4 , the high-dimensional multiplexing could be realized.</p>
        <p>In order to verify the polarization-independent and the versatility of our designed meta-hologram, the experimental setup is schematically shown in Fig. S8. Though the detectable holograms can be experimentally observed at the +1st reflective diffraction order, the most of energies are consumed at the zero-order diffraction due to the absence of blazed phase gradient. In the experiment, the multiplexing holographic images are reconstructed by the off-axis observation taking place in the reflected field, whilst the metasurface is rotated around the rotation axes 1. And the experimental DE is evaluated by the ratio of the intensity of the reflected diffraction order carrying the target information (n = +1) to the total reflection power after the excitation of the rotational multiplexing metasurface.</p>
