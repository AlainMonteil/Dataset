        <p>Combined analyses of the Higgs boson production and decay rates as well as its coupling strengths to vector bosons and fermions are presented. The combinations include the results of the analyses of the H → γ γ, Z Z * , W W * , Z γ, b b, ττ and μμ decay modes, and the constraints on the associated production with a pair of top quarks and on the off-shell coupling strengths of the Higgs boson. The results are based on the LHC proton-proton collision datasets, with integrated luminosities of up to 4.7 fb -1 at √ s = 7 TeV and 20.3 fb -1 at √ s = 8 TeV, recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2011 and 2012. Combining all production modes and decay channels, the measured signal yield, normalised to the Standard Model expectation, is 1.18 +0.15 -0.14 . The observed Higgs boson production and decay rates are interpreted in a leading-order coupling framework, exploring a wide range of benchmark coupling models both with and without assumptions on the Higgs boson width and on the Standard Model particle content in loop processes. The data are found to be compatible with the Standard Model expectations for a Higgs boson at a mass of 125.36 GeV for all models considered.Combined analyses of the Higgs boson production and decay rates as well as its coupling strengths to vector bosons and fermions are presented.

        <p>In 2012, the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) reported the observation of a new particle at a mass of approximately 125 GeV [1,2]. The discovery made in the search for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson (H ), is a milestone in the quest to understand electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). Within the SM, EWSB is achieved through the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism [3][4][5][6][7][8] which predicts the existence of a neutral scalar particle, commonly known as the Higgs boson. While the SM does not predict the value of its mass (m H ), the produce-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch tion cross sections and decay branching ratios (BR) of the Higgs boson can be precisely calculated once the mass is known. Therefore, precision measurements of the properties of the new particle are critical in ascertaining whether the newly discovered particle is fully responsible for EWSB and whether there are potential deviations from SM predictions.In 2012, the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) reported the observation of a new particle at a mass of approximately 125 GeV [1,2].

        <p>At the LHC, SM production of the Higgs boson is dominated by the gluon fusion process gg → H (ggF), followed by the vector-boson fusion process qq → qq H (VBF). Associated production with a W boson q q → W H (W H), a Z boson q q/gg → Z H (Z H) or with a pair of top quarks q q/gg → t t H (tt H ) have sizeable contributions as well. The W H and Z H production processes are collectively referred to as the V H process. Contributions are also expected from b b → H (bbH ) and production in association with a single top quark (t H). The latter proceeds through either the qb → t Hq or gb → W t H process. With the present dataset, the LHC is expected to be most sensitive to the Higgs boson decays of H → γ γ, Z Z * , W W * , ττ and b b. Together they account for approximately 88 % of all decays of a SM Higgs boson at m H ∼ 125 GeV.At the LHC, SM production of the Higgs boson is dominated by the gluon fusion process gg → H (ggF), followed by the vector-boson fusion process qq → qq H (VBF).

        <p>The discovery of the Higgs boson was made through analyses of the bosonic decay modes in H → γ γ , H → Z Z * → 4 and H → W W * → ν ν ( = e, μ) events. Since the discovery, these analyses have been improved and updated with more data [9][10][11]. The H → W W * → ν ν analysis has been supplemented with a dedicated V H analysis targeting H → W W * [12]. The ATLAS Collaboration has measured the Higgs boson mass from the H → γ γ and H → Z Z * → 4 decays to be m H = 125.36 ± 0.41 GeV [13], reported results in the H → τ τ [14] and H → b b [15] fermionic decay modes, and published upper limits on the rare decays H → Z γ [16] and H → μμ [17]. Furthermore, constraints have been set on the tt H production rate [18][19][20] and on the off-shell coupling strengths of the Higgs boson [21]. These results are based on the full proton-proton collision data with integrated luminosities of up to 4.7 fb -1 at a centre-of-mass energy √ s = 7 TeV recorded in 2011 and 20.3 fb -1 at √ s = 8 TeV recorded in 2012 by the ATLAS detector at the LHC.

        <p>This paper presents the combined results of the analyses mentioned above. These analyses are designed for maximum sensitivities to SM Higgs boson production from different processes, exploiting in particular the differences in kinematics through categorisation of the selected events. Thus the yields of different Higgs boson production processes and decays can be extracted. The Higgs boson coupling strengths to SM vector bosons and fermions in different benchmark models are probed for the measured Higgs boson mass of m H = 125. 36 GeV. All results are obtained assuming the Higgs boson has a small total decay width such that its production and decay factorise. The ATLAS Collaboration has previously published combined studies of Higgs boson production and decay rates [23] and of spin-parity properties [24,25] using diboson final states. The results are found to be consistent with expectations from the SM Higgs boson. Compared with the previous publication, the current results are based on the improved analysis sensitivities and the addition of information from other decay modes. A similar combination has been published by the CMS Collaboration [26].This paper presents the combined results of the analyses mentioned above.

        <p>The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 briefly summarises the individual analyses that are included in the combinations and Sect. 3 outlines the statistical method and the treatment of systematic uncertainties used in the combinations. In Sect. 4, the measured Higgs boson yields are compared with the SM predictions for different production processes and decay modes. In Sect. 5, the coupling strengths of the Higgs boson are tested through fits to the observed data. These studies probe possible deviations from the SM predictions under various assumptions, motivated in many cases by beyond-the-SM (BSM) physics scenarios. An upper limit on the branching ratio to invisible or undetected decay modes of the Higgs boson is also set. Finally, a brief summary is presented in Sect. 6.The paper is organised as follows.

        <p>The inputs to the combinations are the results from the analyses of H → γ γ, Z Z * , W W * , ττ, b b, μμ and Z γ decay modes, and of the constraints on tt H and off-shell Higgs boson production. These analyses and changes made for the combinations are briefly discussed in this section. The ATLAS Collaboration has also performed a search for the rare H → J/ψγ decay [27] which has the potential to constrain the Higgs boson coupling strength to the charm quark. However, the current result does not add sensitivity and is therefore omitted from the combinations.

        <p>The theoretical calculations of the Higgs boson production cross sections and decay branching ratios have been compiled in Refs. [30][31][32] and are summarised in Table 1. For the ggF process, the cross section is computed at up to NNLO in QCD corrections [33][34][35][36][37][38] and NLO in electroweak (EW) corrections [39][40][41]. The effects of QCD soft-gluon resummations at up to NNLL [42] are also applied. These calculations are described in Refs. [43][44][45][46][47]. For the VBF process, full QCD and EW corrections up to NLO [48][49][50] and approximate NNLO [51,52] QCD corrections are used to calculate the cross section. The cross sections of the W H and Z H (q q → Z H) are calculated including QCD corrections up to NNLO [53,54] and EW corrections up to NLO [55,56] whereas the cross section of the gg → Z H process is calculated up to NLO in QCD corrections [57,58]. The cross section for tt H is computed up to NLO in QCD [59][60][61][62]. For the bbH process, the cross section is calculated in QCD corrections up to NLO [63][64][65] in the four-flavour scheme and up to NNLO [66] in the five-flavour scheme with the Santander matching scheme [67]. The cross sections of the t H processes used are calculated at up to NLO in QCD corrections [68,69]. The PDF sets used in these calculations are CT10 [70,71],

The Higgs boson transverse momentum distribution from ggF production is reweighted to match the calculation of HRes2.1 [90,91], which includes QCD corrections up to the next-to-nextto-leading order (NNLO) and next-to-next-to-leading logarithm (NNLL) in perturbative expansions. Furthermore, ggF events with two or more jets are reweighted to match the transverse momentum distribution from MiNLO HJJ predictions [92].

For most of the analyses, the process is modelled using Table 1 SM predictions of the Higgs boson production cross sections and decay branching ratios and their uncertainties for m H = 125. 36 GeV, obtained by linear interpolations from those at 125.3 and 125.4 GeV from Ref. [32] except for the t H production cross section which is obtained from Refs. [20,82]. The uncertainties of the cross sections are the sum in quadrature of the uncertainties resulting from variations of QCD scales, parton distribution functions and α s . The uncertainty on the t H cross section is calculated following the procedure in Refs. [20,32] Production q q → Z H of

            <rs type="software">Pythia</rs>8. The tt H process is modelled using the NLO calculation in the HELAC-Oneloop package [93] interfaced to Powheg and Pythia8 for the subsequent simulation. The t H production process is simulated using MadGraph [94] interfaced to Pythia8 for qb → t Hq and using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [82] interfaced to Herwig++ [95] for gb → W t H. The bbH production process contributes approximately 1 % [96] to the total Higgs boson cross section in the SM. It is simulated with the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO program for some analyses. The event kinematics of ggF and bbH production are found to be similar for analysis categories that are most important for bbH . Thus the acceptance times efficiency for bbH is assumed to be the same as for ggF for all analyses. The PDF sets used in the event generations are CT10 [70] and CTEQ6L1 [97]. All Higgs boson decays are simulated by the showering programs.

        <p>In the H → γ γ analysis, described in detail in Ref. [9], the Higgs boson signal is measured in events with at least two isolated and well-identified photon candidates. The leading and subleading photon candidates are required to have E T /m γ γ &gt; 0.35 and 0.25, respectively, where m γ γ is the invariant mass of the two selected photons. The diphoton candidate events are grouped into twelve exclusive categories separately for the √ s = 7 and 8 TeV datasets; the order of categorisation is chosen to give precedence to production modes with the most distinct signatures. Each category is optimised by adjusting the event selection criteria to minimise the expected uncertainty on the signal yield of the targeted production mode.In the H → γ γ analysis, described in detail in Ref.

        <p>The first two categories are designed for tt H production based on the topology of leptonic and hadronic decays of the associated t t pair. They are described in Sect. 2.8. The next four categories are optimised for V H production, targeting one-lepton, dilepton, E miss T , and hadronic signatures of W and Z boson decays. Events from VBF production are identified by requiring two well-separated and highp T jets and little hadronic activity between them. A boosted decision tree (BDT) [98,99] algorithm is employed to maximise the VBF signal and background separation. Events are sorted into two categories with different VBF purities according to the output value of the BDT. Finally, the remaining events are separated into four categories based on the pseudorapidities of the photons and the p Tt of the diphoton system [9], the diphoton momentum transverse to its thrust axis in the transverse plane.The first two categories are designed for tt H production based on the topology of leptonic and hadronic decays of the associated t t pair.

        <p>The analysis of the ggF and VBF production processes [11] selects the signal candidate events by requiring two oppositely charged leptons. Candidates are categorised according to the number of jets (N jet ) and to the flavours of the leptons. The N jet categorisation separates the large top-quark production background from the ggF signal while the categorisation by lepton flavours isolates the challenging Drell-Yan background in the same-flavour categories. The categories targeting ggF production include N jet = 0, 1 and ≥2 and are further divided into the same-and differentflavour leptons for N jet = 0, 1. Only the different-flavour leptons are considered for N jet ≥ 2. The categories targeting VBF production require N jet ≥ 2, separately for the same-or different-flavour leptons. The primary background processes are W W , top quark (t t and W t), W +jets, Drell-Yan, and other diboson (W Z, W γ , W γ * , and Z Z) production. Most of the background contributions are estimated using data. For the ggF categories, the final signal region is selected by requiring the dilepton mass m &lt; 55 GeV and their azimuthal angular separation φ &lt; 1.8 and the signal is extracted through a combined fit to the transverse mass distributions of the dilepton plus E miss T system in both the signal and control regions of different categories and lepton flavours.

        <p>The V H analysis [12] is optimised for different lepton multiplicities: opposite-charge dileptons, same-charge dileptons, three and four leptons. Most final states are required to have E miss T and events with a b-tagged jet are vetoed. Dilepton final states target V H production with the H → W W * decay with two bosons decaying leptonically and the other hadronically. The opposite-charge dilepton final state selects events with two or more jets, with the value of m j j required to be close to the W and Z boson masses. Similar to the ggF N jet ≥ 2 category, the dominant background is from top quark production. The same-charge dilepton category accepts events with either one or two jets. The dominant backgrounds are from W Z, W γ ( * ) , and W +jets production. The three-lepton final state targets W H with H → W W * and has the highest sensitivity of the four final states. The three leptons are required to have a net charge of ±1 and the event can have at most one jet. The dominant background process is W Z production and is reduced with a Z → veto. The four-lepton category is designed to accept events from Z H production with the H → W W * decay. The net charge of the leptons is required to be zero and at least one pair of leptons is required to have the same flavour, opposite charge, and an invariant mass close to the Z boson mass. The dominant background is SM Z Z * production. In the three-lepton category, the signal yield is extracted through fits to distributions of a BDT or the minimum separation in the η -φ plane between opposite-charge leptons depending on the lepton flavours.

        <p>The H → τ τ analysis [14] considers both the leptonic (τ lep ) and hadronic (τ had ) decays of the τ lepton. Three sub-channels (τ lep τ lep , τ lep τ had and τ had τ had ) are defined by orthogonal requirements on the number of reconstructed hadronic τ decays and leptons (electrons or muons) in the event. 1Candidate events are divided into boosted and VBF categories. The boosted category targets signal events where the Higgs boson is produced with a large boost, primarily from the gluon fusion process, and requires the transverse momentum of the reconstructed Higgs boson candidate to be greater than 100 GeV. The VBF category contains events with two jets separated in pseudorapidity and targets signal events produced through the vector boson fusion process. A separate BDT is then employed in each category and sub-channel to discriminate signal from background, utilising between five and nine input variables, chosen in order to exploit discriminating features such as Higgs boson decay properties, event activity, and the VBF topology in the corresponding category. One of the most important input variables is the mass of the τ τ system, which is quite challenging to reconstruct due to the presence of at least two neutrinos in the final state; the Missing Mass Calculator [101] is used for this purpose.The H → τ τ analysis [14] considers both the leptonic (τ lep ) and hadronic (τ had ) decays of the τ lepton.

Similarly, there is cross-feed from H → W W * in the H → τ τ analysis. In such cases, this cross-feed was treated as background in the relevant individual channel analyses. For the combinations described in this paper, such events are interpreted as signal from the corresponding Higgs boson decay. • The rate of gg → Z H events in the V H channels is parameterised in terms of Higgs boson coupling strengths to Z bosons and top quarks, following the calculations of Ref.

To avoid spurious sensitivity due to these very small components in the com-bined analyses presented in this paper, both aforementioned decays are treated like H → b b in the fits for the Higgs boson signal strength.

        <p>This section discusses the measurements of the signalstrength parameter μ of different production modes and decay channels as well as their ratios for a fixed Higgs boson mass hypothesis of m H = 125.36 GeV [23]. The signalstrength parameter is a measure of potential deviations from the SM prediction under the assumption that the Higgs boson production and decay kinematics do not change appreciably from the SM expectations. In particular, the transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of the Higgs boson are assumed to be those predicted for the SM Higgs boson by state-of-the-art event generators and calculations of each production process. This assumption is corroborated by studies such as the measurements of differential production cross sections [113,114] and tests of spin and CP properties of the Higgs boson [24,115].This section discusses the measurements of the signalstrength parameter μ of different production modes and decay channels as well as their ratios for a fixed Higgs boson mass hypothesis of m H = 125.36 GeV [23].

        <p>The Higgs boson production modes can be probed with four signal-strength parameters: μ ggF , μ VBF , μ V H and μ tt H , one for each main production mode, combining Higgs boson signals from different decay channels under the assumption of SM values for the ratios of the branching ratios of different Higgs boson decays. This assumption is equivalent to set all μ f s in Eq. ( 2) to be equal. The SM predictions of the signal yields are scaled by these four production-dependent parameters. The best-fit values of these parameters for the √ s = 8 TeV data separately and in combination with the √ s = 7 TeV data are shown in Table 4. Uncertainty components from statistics, systematics, and signal theory are also shown. The accuracy with which the uncertainties are broken down is limited by the precision of the fit and more importantly by the approximations made in individual analyses when neglecting uncertainties which are small with respect to, e.g., the statistical uncertainty. The √ s = 7 and 8 TeV combined values with their total uncertainties are also illustrated in Fig. 3. The √ s = 7 TeV data are included in the combinations only, as they have limited statistical power to distinguish between different production modes. The signalstrength measurements are in reasonable agreement with the SM predictions of unity. Although the results support the SM prediction of the tt H production (see Sect. 4.4), this production process remains to be firmly established in future LHC runs. Thus, a 95 % CL upper limit on its signal strength is also derived. Combining the results from various analyses with sensitivity to tt H production, the observed and expected limits are μ tt H &lt; 3.2 and 1.4, respectively.The Higgs boson production modes can be probed with four signal-strength parameters: μ ggF , μ VBF , μ V H and μ tt H , one for each main production mode, combining Higgs boson signals from different decay channels under the assumption of SM values for the ratios of the branching ratios of different Higgs boson decays. This assumption is equivalent to set all μ f s in Eq. ( 2) to be equal. The SM predictions of the signal yields are scaled by these four production-dependent parameters. The best-fit values of these parameters for the √ s = 8 TeV data separately and in combination with the √ s = 7 TeV data are shown in Table 4. Uncertainty components from statistics, systematics, and signal theory are also shown. The accuracy with which the uncertainties are broken down is limited by the precision of the fit and more importantly by the approximations made in individual analyses when neglecting uncertainties which are small with respect to, e.g., the statistical uncertainty.

One can sum the different cross sections to obtain an overall extrapolated cross section for Higgs boson produc- TeV. The differences are largely the result of analysis categorisation. Categories often explore production processes or phase-space regions with distinct signal-event topologies. The resulting high signal-to-background ratios can significantly improve the precision of the signal-strength measurements. However, these categories often account for small fractions of the production cross section and thus have limited impact on the total cross-section measurement, which is dominated by processes with larger expected cross sections.

        <p>In some of the fits, effective scale factors κ g , κ γ and κ Zγ are introduced to describe the processes gg → H , H → γ γ and H → Z γ , which are loop-induced in the SM, as shown in Figs. 7a and 11, respectively. In other fits they are treated as a function of the more fundamental coupling-strength scale factors κ t , κ b , κ W , and similarly for all other particles that contribute to these SM loop processes. In these cases, the loop contributions are expressed in terms of the fundamental coupling strengths, including all interference effects, as listed for the SM in Table 9. The loop process gg → Z H is never treated as an effective scale factor, as unlike in the other loop processes, a gg H Z contact interaction from new physics would likely show a kinematic structure very different from the SM gg → Z H process [58] assumed in the current study and is expected to be suppressed.

        <p>As all observed Higgs boson cross sections in the LO framework are inversely proportional to the Higgs boson width (Eq. ( 7)), which is not experimentally constrained to a meaningful precision at the LHC, only ratios of coupling strengths can be measured at the LHC without assumptions about the Higgs boson width. To make measurements of absolute coupling strengths, an assumption about the Higgs boson width must be introduced. The simplest assumption is that there are no invisible or undetected Higgs boson decays, i.e. BR i.,u. = 0 is assumed in Eq. ( 8). An alternative, less strong assumption, is that κ W ≤ 1 and κ Z ≤ 1 [32]. This assumption is theoretically motivated by the premise that the Higgs boson should solve the unitarity problem in vector boson scattering and also holds in a wide class of BSM models. In particular, it is valid in any model with an arbitrary number of Higgs doublets, with and without additional Higgs singlets. The assumption is also justified in certain classes of composite Higgs boson models. A second alternative is to assume that the coupling strengths in off-shell Higgs boson production are identical to those for onshell Higgs boson production. Under the assumption that the off-shell signal strength and coupling-strength scale factors are independent of the energy scale of Higgs boson production, the total Higgs boson decay width can be determined from the ratio of off-shell to on-shell signal strengths [21]. The constraint BR i.,u. ≥ 0, motivated by the basic assumption that the total width of the Higgs boson must be greater or equal to the sum of the measured partial widths, always introduces a lower bound on the Higgs boson width. The difference in effect of these assumptions is therefore mostly in the resulting upper limit on the Higgs boson width. The assumptions made for the various measurements are summarised in Table 10 and discussed in the next sections together with the results.As all observed Higgs boson cross sections in the LO framework are inversely proportional to the Higgs boson width (Eq.

The sensitivity to disfavour the negative solution of κ t is reduced with respect to generic model 1 as the interference in loop couplings can no longer be exploited because effective coupling-strength scale factors were introduced. The observed residual sensitivity to the sign of κ t is exclusively due to the tree-level interference effect of the t H background in the tt H channel.Figure 24 shows profile likelihood ratios as a function of selected coupling-strength scale factors.

        <p>The power of individual loop processes to measure the magnitude of κ t and resolve the sign of κ t relative to κ W is illustrated in more detail in Fig. 25. The blue curve shows the profile likelihood ratio as a function of κ t for a model with the least sensitivity to the sign of κ t : all loop processes are described with effective coupling parameters, including the gg → Z H loop process. Subsequently the red, green and orange curves represent the profile likelihood ratios for models that incrementally include information from loop processes by resolving the gg → Z H, ggF and H → γ γ, Z γ loop processes into their expected SM content. Here the red curve corresponds to the configuration of generic model 2, and the orange curve corresponds to the configuration of generic model 1. As expected, resolving gg → Z H process adds little information on κ t . Additionally resolving the ggF of the profile likelihood ratio corresponding to a 68 % (95 %) confidence interval for the parameter of interest, assuming the asymptotic χ 2 distribution for the test statistic loop process into its SM content greatly improves the precision on κ t (green curve), but reduces the sensitivity to the relative sign of κ t and κ W . This reduction happens because on one hand the ggF process yields no new information on this relative sign, as it is dominated by t-b interference, and on the other hand because it decreases the observed magnitude of κ t to a more SM-compatible level, thereby reducing the sensitivity of the t H process to the relative sign. Further resolving the H → γ γ and H → Z γ loop processes, which are dominated by W -t interference, greatly improves the measurement of the relative sign of κ W and κ t (orange curve), but does not significantly contribute to the precision of the magnitude of κ t .The power of individual loop processes to measure the magnitude of κ t and resolve the sign of κ t relative to κ W is illustrated in more detail in Fig. 25.

The fitted values and their uncertainties are also shown in Fig. 25 Profile likelihood ratio as a function of κ t for models with and without resolved loop processes: shown are measurements of κ t with no loop processes resolved (blue), only gg → Z H resolved (red, generic model 2), gg → H additionally resolved (green), and H → γ γ and H → Z γ additionally resolved (orange, generic model 1). The dashed blue and orange curves correspond to the expected sensitivity for the no-loop and all-loop models. All profile likelihood curves are drawn for the full range of κ t , however some curves are partially obscured when overlapping with another nearly identical curve.

Hence only positive values for all κ-factors except κ t are shown without loss of generality. The parameter κ gZ , λ Zg , λ WZ , λ tg , λ bZ , λ τ Z and λ γ Z are all measured to be compatible with their SM expectation, while limits are set on the parameters λ μZ and λ (Zγ )Z . The nine-dimensional cates the cutoff value of the profile likelihood ratio corresponding to a 68 % (95 %) confidence interval for the parameter of interest, assuming the asymptotic χ 2 distribution for the test statistic LEP and at the Tevatron [120]. This custodial constraint is directly probed in the Higgs sector through the parameter λ WZ . The measured ratio λ WZ is in part directly constrained by the decays in the H → W W * → ν ν and H → Z Z * → 4 channels and the W H and Z H production processes. It is also indirectly constrained by the VBF production process, which in the SM is 74 % W fusion-mediated and 26 % Z fusion-mediated (see Table 9). Figure 27a shows the profile likelihood ratio as a function of the coupling-strength scale factor ratio λ WZ . Due to the interference terms, the fit is sensitive to the relative sign of the W and t coupling (t H) and the relative sign of the Z and t coupling (gg → Z H), providing indirect sensitivity to the sign of λ WZ . The negative solution is disfavoured at 0.5σ (0.3σ expected). The minimum corresponding to the positive solution is found at λ WZ = 0.92 +0.14 -0.12 , in excellent agreement with the prediction of SU(2) custodial symmetry.Figure 26 shows the full set of results obtained from the fit to this benchmark model.

The study combines specific analyses of the H → γ γ, Z Z * , W W * , Z γ, b b, ττ and μμ decay channels, as well as searches for tt H production and measurements of off-shell Higgs boson production. It significantly extends a previous combination of the H → γ γ, Z Z * and W W * decays [23]. In particular, the addition of the fermionic decays of the Higgs boson in the combinations allows for direct tests of the Yukawa interactions of the Higgs boson with fermions.The Higgs boson production and decay properties are studied using proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 4.7 fb -1 at √ s = 7 TeV and 20.3 fb -1 at √ s = 8 TeV.

        <p>The measured Higgs boson signal yields are compared with the SM expectations at the fixed Higgs boson mass of m H = 125.36 GeV. The combined yield relative to its SM prediction is determined to be 1.18 ± 0.10 (stat.) ± 0.07 (syst.) +0.08 -0.07 (theo.). The combined analysis provides unequivocal confirmation of gluon fusion production of the Higgs boson with a significance exceeding 5σ and strong evidence of vector-boson fusion production with a significance of 4.3σ . Furthermore, it supports the SM predictions of Higgs boson production in association with a vector boson or a pair of top quarks. Values for the total cross sections can be obtained from the signal strength of each production process within the uncertainties related to the modelling of Higgs boson production and decay kinematics and assuming SM decay branching ratios. The total cross sections at √ s = 7 and 8 TeV are 22.1 +6.7 -5.3 (stat.) +2.7 -2.3 (syst.) +1.9 -1.4 (theo.) pb and 27.7 ± 3.0 (stat.) +2.0 -1.7 (syst.) +1.2 -0.9 (theo.) pb, respectively. The observed Higgs boson production and decay rates are also interpreted in a leading-order coupling framework, exploring a wide range of benchmark coupling models both with and without assumptions about the Higgs boson width and the SM particle content of loop processes. Higgs boson couplings to up-type fermions and vector bosons are found with both significances above 5σ and to down-type fermions with a significance of 4.5σ , under the assumption of unified coupling scale factors, one for each type of particles.
