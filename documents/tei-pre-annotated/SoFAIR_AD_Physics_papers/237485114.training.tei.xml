        <p>It has recently been shown that Bondi-van der Burg-Metzner-Sachs supertranslation symmetries imply an infinite number of conservation laws for all gravitational theories in asymptotically Minkowskian spacetimes. These laws require black holes to carry a large amount of soft (i.e., zero-energy) supertranslation hair. The presence of a Maxwell field similarly implies soft electric hair. This Letter gives an explicit description of soft hair in terms of soft gravitons or photons on the black hole horizon, and shows that complete information about their quantum state is stored on a holographic plate at the future boundary of the horizon. Charge conservation is used to give an infinite number of exact relations between the evaporation products of black holes which have different soft hair but are otherwise identical. It is further argued that soft hair which is spatially localized to much less than a Planck length cannot be excited in a physically realizable process, giving an effective number of soft degrees of freedom proportional to the horizon area in Planck units.

        <p>Introduction.-Forty years ago, one of the authors argued [1] that information is destroyed when a black hole is formed and subsequently evaporates [2,3]. This conclusion seems to follow inescapably from an "unquestionable" set of general assumptions such as causality, the uncertainty principle, and the equivalence principle. However it leaves us bereft of deterministic laws to describe the Universe. This is the infamous information paradox.Introduction.-Forty years ago, one of the authors argued [1] that information is destroyed when a black hole is formed and subsequently evaporates [2,3].

        <p>Over the intervening years, for a variety of reasons, the initial conclusion that information is destroyed has become widely regarded as implausible. Despite this general sentiment, in all this time there has been neither a universally accepted flaw discovered in the original argument of [1] nor an a priori reason to doubt any of the "unquestionable" assumptions on which it is based.Over the intervening years, for a variety of reasons, the initial conclusion that information is destroyed has become widely regarded as implausible.

        <p>Recently such an a priori reason for doubt has emerged from new discoveries about the infrared structure of quantum gravity in asymptotically flat spacetimes. The starting point goes back to the 1962 demonstration by Bondi, van der Burg, Metzner, and Sachs (BMS) [4] that physical data at future or past null infinity transform nontrivially under, in addition to the expected Poincaré transformations, an infinite set of diffeomorphisms known as supertranslations. These supertranslations separately shift forward or backward in retarded (advanced) time the individual light rays comprising future (past) null infinity. Recently it was shown [5], using new mathematical results [6] on the structure of null infinity, that a certain antipodal combination of past and future supertranslations is an exact symmetry of gravitational scattering. The concomitant infinite number of "supertranslation charge" conservation laws equate the net incoming energy at any angle to the net outgoing energy at the opposing angle. In the quantum theory, matrix elements of the conservation laws give an infinite number of exact relations between scattering amplitudes in quantum gravity. These relations turned out [7] to have been previously discovered by Weinberg in 1965 [8] using Feynman diagrammatics and are known as the soft graviton theorem. The argument may also be run backwards: starting from the soft graviton theorem one may derive both the infinity of conservation laws and supertranslation symmetry of gravitational scattering.Recently such an a priori reason for doubt has emerged from new discoveries about the infrared structure of quantum gravity in asymptotically flat spacetimes.

        <p>This exact equivalence has provided fundamentally new perspectives on both BMS symmetry and the soft graviton theorem, as well as more generally the infrared behavior of gravitational theories [5,7,. Supertranslations transform the Minkowski vacuum to a physically inequivalent zero-energy vacuum. Since the vacuum is not invariant, supertranslation symmetry is spontaneously broken. The soft (i.e., zero-energy) gravitons are the associated Goldstone bosons. The infinity of inequivalent vacua differ from one another by the creation or annihilation of soft gravitons. They all have zero energy but different angular momenta. (None of these vacua are preferred, and each is annihilated by a different Poincaré subgroup of BMS. This is related to the lack of a canonical definition of angular momentum in general relativity.)This exact equivalence has provided fundamentally new perspectives on both BMS symmetry and the soft graviton theorem, as well as more generally the infrared behavior of gravitational theories [5,7,.

        <p>(i) The vacuum in quantum gravity is not unique. The information loss argument assumes that after the evaporation process is completed, the quantum state settles down to a unique vacuum. In fact, the process of black hole formation or evaporation will generically induce a transition among the infinitely degenerate vacua. In principle, the final vacuum state could be correlated with the thermal Hawking radiation in such a way as to maintain quantum purity.(i) The vacuum in quantum gravity is not unique.

        <p>(ii) Black holes have a lush head of "soft hair." The information loss argument assumes that static black holes are nearly bald; i.e., they are characterized solely by their mass M, charge Q, and angular momentum J. The no-hair theorem [41] indeed shows that static black holes are characterized by M, Q, and J up to diffeomorphisms. However, BMS transformations are diffeomorphisms which change the physical state. A Lorentz boost for example maps a stationary black hole to an obviously physically inequivalent black hole with different energy and nonzero momentum. Supertranslations similarly map a stationary black hole to a physically inequivalent one. In the process of Hawking evaporation, supertranslation charge will be radiated through null infinity. Since this charge is conserved, the sum of the black hole and radiated supertranslation charge is fixed at all times. (In the quantum theory the state will typically not be an eigenstate of the supertranslation charge operator, and the conservation law becomes a statement about matrix elements.) This requires that black holes carry what we call soft hair arising from supertranslations. Moreover, when the black hole has fully evaporated, the net supertranslation charge in the outgoing radiation must be conserved. This will force correlations between the early-and late-time Hawking radiation, generalizing the correlations enforced by overall energymomentum conservation. Such correlations are not seen in the usual semiclassical computation. Put another way, if the evolution of a spacetime in which a black hole forms and then evaporates is to be unitary, then viewed as a scattering amplitude from I -to I þ , it must be constrained by the soft graviton theorem and its descendants.(ii) Black holes have a lush head of "soft hair."

        <p>Of course, finding a flawed assumption underlying the information loss argument is a far cry from resolving the information paradox. That would require, at a minimum, a detailed understanding of the information flow out of black holes as well as a derivation of the Hawking-Bekenstein area-entropy law [2,3,42]. In this Letter we take some steps in that direction.Of course, finding a flawed assumption underlying the information loss argument is a far cry from resolving the information paradox.

        <p>The problem of black hole information has been fruitfully informed by developments in string theory. In particular it was shown [48] that certain string-theoretic black holes store complete information about their quantum state in a holographic plate that lives at the horizon. Moreover the storage capacity was found to be precisely the amount predicted by the Hawking-Bekenstein areaentropy law. Whether or not string theory in some form is a correct theory of nature, the holographic method it has presented to us of storing information on the black hole horizon is an appealing one, which might be employed by real-world black holes independently of the ultimate status of string theory.The problem of black hole information has been fruitfully informed by developments in string theory.

        <p>Indeed, in this Letter we show that soft hair has a natural description as quantum pixels in a holographic plate. The plate lives on the two-sphere at the future boundary of the horizon. Exciting a pixel corresponds to creating a spatially localized soft graviton or photon on the horizon, and may be implemented by a horizon supertranslation or large gauge transformation. In a physical setting, the quantum state of the pixel is transformed whenever a particle crosses the horizon. The combination of the uncertainty principle and cosmic censorship requires all physical particles to be larger than the Planck length, effectively setting a minimum spatial size for excitable pixels. This gives an effective number of soft hairs proportional to the area of the horizon in Planck units and hints at a connection to the areaentropy law.Indeed, in this Letter we show that soft hair has a natural description as quantum pixels in a holographic plate.

        <p>It is natural to ask whether or not the supertranslation pixels could conceivably store all of the information that crosses the horizon into the black hole. We expect the supertranslation hair is too thin to fully reproduce the areaentropy law. However there are other soft symmetries such as superrotations [11,12,[49][50][51] which lead to thicker kinds of hair as discussed in [10]. Superrotations have not yet been fully studied or understood. It is an open question whether or not the current line of investigation, perhaps with additional new ingredients, can characterize all the pixels on the holographic plate.It is natural to ask whether or not the supertranslation pixels could conceivably store all of the information that crosses the horizon into the black hole.

Soft photons exiting at I þ can be measured using the electromagnetic memory effect [53][54][55]. The effect falls off like 1=r so the measurement must be done near, but not on, I þ .
