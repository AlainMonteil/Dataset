        <p>The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics has been remarkably successful in describing the nature of the elementary constituents and their interactions. Of the four fundamental forces, the strong interaction as described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is particularly intriguing, as it exhibits a wealth of phenomena (confinement, spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, anomalies, instantons) and binds the quarks and gluons that form the observable hadrons. However, it is precisely these properties of QCD that make it challenging to characterize the structure of the strongly interacting hadrons in the context of conventional perturbation theory.The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics has been remarkably successful in describing the nature of the elementary constituents and their interactions.

        <p>The QCD-based parton picture has provided a reliable phenomenological framework for describing the physics of hadrons. However, an essential ingredient for these calculations are the parton distribution functions (PDFs), which encode the properties of quarks and gluons inside the hadrons. Ultimately, the accuracy of any calculation based on the QCD parton model depends on the accuracy of the PDFs; thus, the PDFs are crucial for current LHC measurements as well as future HL-LHC, LHeC, and EIC investigations.The QCD-based parton picture has provided a reliable phenomenological framework for describing the physics of hadrons.

        <p>Unfortunately the PDFs are, at present, often the element that limits the precision. For example, the focus of the upcoming LHC runs will be to improve the event statistics with increased luminosity; thus, the path to future discoveries will be delineated with high-precision comparisons as we search for discrepancies between the data and the Standard-Model predictions. Hence, our ability to fully characterize the Higgs boson and constrain any new-physics signatures ultimately comes down to how accurately we can determine the underlying PDFs.Unfortunately the PDFs are, at present, often the element that limits the precision.

        <p>There are two main communities with complementary approaches to determining the PDFs: (1) determination by global analysis of experimental measurements, and (2) direct computation using lattice QCD. The global QCD analyses use large experimental data sets in the context of the QCD parton model (along with factorization theorems) to extract process-independent PDFs. The lattice-QCD approach directly computes the QCD path integral on a discretized finite-volume Euclidean space-time grid to extract moments of PDFs, quasi-PDFs, and other quantities.There are two main communities with complementary approaches to determining the PDFs: (1) determination by global analysis of experimental measurements, and (2) direct computation using lattice QCD.

        <p>A general overview of these approaches was presented in the 2017 PDFLattice report [1]; this work grew out of a 2017 workshop 2 which brought the two communities together to address common questions and followed up on the very fruitful discussions and interactions that took place during the workshop. That first document served as a common reference to standardize notation and conventions to facilitate communication between these communities.

        <p>At the lowest perturbative order, the conventional PDFs f (x) describe the probability of finding a parton with momentum fraction x inside a hadron. In this 1-dimensional description, we project out the collinear momentum of the parton, and integrate over the transverse momentum. If we desire additional information about the parton, we could ask about the transverse momentum k T or the impact parameter b T of the parton relative to the parent hadron. Both k T and b T are separate 2-dimensional vectors measured relative to the axis defined by the hadron momentum; note, k T and b T are independent quantities and not Fourier conjugates of each other. Combining this information together yields the 5-dimensional Wigner distribution W (x, k T , b T ) which, in a sense, provides complete information on the parton. If we integrate the Wigner distribution over the transverse momentum, we obtain a generalized parton distribution (GPD) f GPD (x, b T ), while if we integrate over the impact parameter we obtain a transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) PDF f TMD (x, k T ). Thus, by expanding the scope of our investigations beyond collinear PDFs to include the independent GPDs and TMD PDFs, we can extract more detailed information on the partons which comprise the hadron.At the lowest perturbative order, the conventional PDFs f (x) describe the probability of finding a parton with momentum fraction x inside a hadron.

        <p>Not only do the GPDs describe the spatial distributions of quarks and gluons in the plane transverse to the hadron momentum, but they also provide a mechanism to study the rich spin structure of the hadrons. Together with the collinear information encoded in the x momentum fraction variable, the GPDs provide a three-dimensional (3D) tomographic image of the structure of hadrons in terms of QCD's quarks and gluons.Not only do the GPDs describe the spatial distributions of quarks and gluons in the plane transverse to the hadron momentum, but they also provide a mechanism to study the rich spin structure of the hadrons.

        <p>Likewise, the TMD PDFs encode not only the transverse momentum distribution of the hadronic components, but can also provide the polarization degrees of freedom. The information about transverse degrees of freedom is essential in the context of QCD factorization theorems for multiscale, noninclusive collider observables. The transverse momentum degrees of freedom of partons can be addressed within so called transverse-momentum-dependent factorization, where essentially the transverse momentum is much smaller than the hard scale of the final state. A typical process where one applies this factorization is Drell-Yan production. Another approach (valid at low x) is addressed within the color-glass condensate (CGC) model, which is an effective model formulated within QCD.Likewise, the TMD PDFs encode not only the transverse momentum distribution of the hadronic components, but can also provide the polarization degrees of freedom.

        <p>In the framework of leading-twist collinear factorization [2], PDFs are the number densities of partons carrying a fraction x of the momentum of their parent nucleon. Depending on the polarization of the parton with respect to that of the nucleon, three collinear PDF species can be defined: the unpolarized PDF, f , for an unpolarized parton in an unpolarized nucleon; the helicity PDF, ∆f , for the net amount of partons polarized along or opposite a longitudinally polarized nucleon; and the transversity PDF, δf = h f 1 , for the net amount of quarks polarized along or opposite a transversely polarized nucleon. In canonical field theory, PDFs are equivalently defined in terms of matrix elements of bi-local operators (see Sec. 2 in [3] for a detailed discussion), e.g. for quarksIn the framework of leading-twist collinear factorization [2], PDFs are the number densities of partons carrying a fraction x of the momentum of their parent nucleon.

        <p>Expressions similar to those in Eq. ( 1) also hold for unpolarized and helicity gluon PDFs. They all include renormalization of all fields and coupling, usually in the MS scheme, a fact that makes PDF depend on the (renormalization) scale µ. This dependence is purely perturbative, and can be computed by means of DGLAP evolution equations [5][6][7]. Nuclear modifications, occurring when a nucleon is bound in a nucleus, do not alter these definitions: nuclear and nucleon PDFs are defined by the same leading-twist operators entering Eq. ( 1) (though acting on different states), therefore it is customary to assume that nuclear modifications can be absorbed into the PDFs.Expressions similar to those in Eq.

        <p>In this Section, we review recent progress in the determination of unpolarized, helicity and transversity PDFs from the two methods delineated in the Introduction: global QCD analyses of experimental data, on the one hand; and lattice QCD, on the other hand. We focus on updates occurred since the publication of the 2017 PDFLattice report [1]. We then investigate possible intersections between the two methods, specifically three aspects that we deem of particular relevance: moments of PDFs, the use of lattice data in global fits, and the unpolarized and helicity strange PDF.

        <p>A global QCD analysis of PDFs consists in modeling PDFs by means of a suitable parametrization, which is then optimized by comparing PDF-dependent predictions for one or more physical scattering processes involving initial-state nucleons to (multiple sets of) their actual measurements. In this sense, a PDF determination can be considered a nonlinearregression problem, in which one has to learn the relative weights of a set of functions from data. Key to this procedure are QCD factorization theorems [2], according to which the cross section for a class of sufficiently inclusive hadronic processes can be determined by folding the PDFs with perturbatively computable partonic cross sections.A global QCD analysis of PDFs consists in modeling PDFs by means of a suitable parametrization, which is then optimized by comparing PDF-dependent predictions for one or more physical scattering processes involving initial-state nucleons to (multiple sets of) their actual measurements.

        <p>The accuracy and precision of a PDF determination largely depend on the data set and on the theoretical and statistical sophistication of the analysis. The input data sets are remarkably different across the three PDF species defined in Eq. (1); while there are thousands of measurements available to determine the unpolarized PDFs, there are typically only hundreds of them for the helicity, and tens for the transversity. The kinematic coverage and the variety of hadronic processes decreases accordingly: unpolarized and helicity PDFs benefit, although to a different extent, from measurements in inclusive and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (DIS and SIDIS), Drell-Yan (DY), and a variety of proton-proton (pp) scattering processes (including gauge-boson, jet, and heavy-particle production). The transversity PDF, instead, is limited by its nature to processes coupled to a chiral-odd final state; in a purely collinear framework, that is di-hadron production in SIDIS or in pp collisions (Di). This state of affairs is summarized in Fig. 1, where we display the kinematic coverage, in the (x, Q 2 )-plane (Q = µ is the characteristic scale of the data), of the hadronic cross section data for the processes commonly included in modern QCD analyses of unpolarized, helicity and transversity PDFs. The dashed line is at Q = 1 GeV. Data below this value are usually not included in QCD analyses of PDFs because QCD becomes largely nonperturbative, due to the growth of the strong coupling. The extended kinematic ranges attained by a future Large Hadron-Electron Collider (LHeC) [11] or a polarized Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) [12] are also displayed. A corresponding plot for unpolarized nuclear PDFs can be found in Fig. 1 of Ref.

        <p>The continued excellent performance of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [13] has brought the determination of unpolarized PDFs in a precision era. The recent completion of Run II has accumulated data from an integrated luminosity of approximately 150 fb -1 , a fact that shrank the statistical uncertainty of the measurements to unprecedented small values, typically 1% or less. This state of affairs challenges PDFs as a tool to perform precision tests of the SM and searches of new physics; PDFs must become comparably precise. Next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) accuracy has become standard, and large efforts were also devoted to update PDF sets with an increasing amount of LHC measurements, to develop statistical tools to investigate the impact and/or inconsistencies of the data, and to represent residual theoretical uncertainties Source: Figure from [3].The continued excellent performance of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [13] has brought the determination of unpolarized PDFs in a precision era.

        <p>The CTEQ-TEA collaboration has recently released their new CT18 PDF set [14], accurate up to NNLO. More than 700 data points from 12 new LHC data sets were included in the new fits. Among them, the most important data sets that drove changes in the quark and antiquark PDFs are the LHCb W -and Z -boson data at 7 and 8 TeV. Very mild changes in the fitted PDFs were observed with the addition of the ATLAS 8-TeV and CMS 7-and 8-TeV W -and Z -boson data. Changes in the gluon PDF were instead driven by the inclusion of CMS and ATLAS jet data, and of ATLAS 8-TeV Z -boson transverse-momentum distributions, which both made the central value and the uncertainty of the gluon decrease in the region 0.1 &lt; x &lt; 0.4. The subsequent inclusion of top-pair-production data from ATLAS and CMS, in particular of singleand double-differential distributions, was demonstrated to have little impact in the CT18 fit. Finally, the central value of the sea-quark ratio (s + s) / ( ū + d) increased in the small-x region, due predominantly to the inclusion of LHCb data.The CTEQ-TEA collaboration has recently released their new CT18 PDF set [14], accurate up to NNLO.

        <p>We note that the conclusions above regarding the PDF-level pulls of experiments fitted in CT18 were also informed by a recently developed family of methodologies to study the sensitivity and impact of specific data sets without the necessity of performing full global fits [15][16][17].We note that the conclusions above regarding the PDF-level pulls of experiments fitted in CT18 were also informed by a recently developed family of methodologies to study the sensitivity and impact of specific data sets without the necessity of performing full global fits [15][16][17].</p>
        <p>A variant of the baseline CT18 fit, called CT18Z, was determined with the additional inclusion of the ATLAS 7-TeV W ± /Z rapidity distributions and by taking the factorization and renormalization scales in the DIS process to be x-dependent. The fit represents the maximal deviation from the nominal CT18 fit, notably in the gluon and strange-quark PDFs. The resulting PDFs for the CT18 set, which are representative of the qualitative status of current unpolarized PDFs, are shown in Fig. 2. The latest PDF determination from the MMHT collaboration is MMHT14 [18], which was later extended to include HERA I-II legacy measurements [19], jet-production measurements [20], and differential measurements in top-pair production [21] from the LHC. These intermediate updates demonstrated that experimental correlations across systematic uncertainties have been improperly estimated for some of the ATLAS jet and differential top data sets. The features of a new preliminary PDF set were presented in Ref. [22], which included new LHC data sets, notably the particularly precise 7-TeV ATLAS W -and Z -boson measurements, which increase the ratio of strange to nonstrange light sea quarks at low x, whilst still allowing for a positive light-sea-quark asymmetry, albeit with a maximum at slightly lower x. The MMHT fit has also been updated with an improved and extended parametrization based on Chebyshev polynomials.A variant of the baseline CT18 fit, called CT18Z, was determined with the additional inclusion of the ATLAS 7-TeV W ± /Z rapidity distributions and by taking the factorization and renormalization scales in the DIS process to be x-dependent. The fit represents the maximal deviation from the nominal CT18 fit, notably in the gluon and strange-quark PDFs.

        <p>The NNPDF collaboration released their latest PDF set in Ref. [23]. This was later extended to include direct photon [24], single-top [25], and dijet-production measurements [26] from the LHC. A reassessment of the impact of top-pair differential distributions measured by ATLAS at 8 TeV was also presented in Ref. [27], which demonstrated the different impact of absolute and normalized distributions in the fit, and the importance of fitting charm in their description. The NNPDF collaboration has also developed a statistical procedure to represent theory uncertainties in PDFs [28], and applied it to missing higher-order uncertainties (MHOU) in the strong-coupling expansion of theoretical predictions [29,30], and to nuclear uncertainties in observables obtained from scattering off nuclear targets [31]. The procedure consists in supplementing the experimental covariance matrix with a theoretical covariance matrix estimated by way of an educated guess. In the case of MHOU, correlated uncertainties were estimated at next-to-leading order (NLO) by varying the factorization and renormalization scales according to various prescriptions; in the case of nuclear corrections, correlated uncertainties were estimated as the difference between theoretical predictions obtained either with a free-proton or nuclear PDF. The representation of such uncertainties in PDFs is likely to become mandatory in the future, because their size is comparable to that determined from the uncertainty of the data. The inclusion of such theoretical uncertainties was demonstrated to improve the description of the data, while increasing PDF uncertainties only mildly.The NNPDF collaboration released their latest PDF set in Ref.

        <p>In Fig. 3 we compare the CT18, MMHT14 and NNPDF3.1 PDF sets at a scale Q = µ = 2 GeV. Specifically, we display the following PDF combinations from top to bottom and left to right: c + c and g. Note the special scale on the x axis. While the three global analyses produce similar total valence distributions u v + d v for 0.05 ≲ x ≲ 0.5, their predictions on other flavor combinations could differ by 10% or more, as in ūd, ū + d, s + s, c + c and g. In particular, the c + c PDF combination is largely different between NNPDF3.1 and the other sets, given that charm is parametrized on the same footing as other PDFs in the NNPDF3.1 set, while it is generated perturbatively in the others. Finally, note that the difference ss is not displayed for CT18 because they assume s = s; MMHT14 and NNPDF3.1 determine s and s PDFs independently.In Fig. 3 we compare the CT18, MMHT14 and NNPDF3.1 PDF sets at a scale Q = µ = 2 GeV.

        <p>Besides the three PDF sets described above, other unpolarized PDF determinations have been produced or updated recently, namely ABMP, CJ, JAM, JR and HERAPDF.

        <p>The ABMP16 [33] PDF set is the only unpolarized PDF set determined in a scheme with a fixed number of flavors: for 3, 4 and 5 active flavors separately. In comparison to the previous ABM12 [34] PDF set, it includes an extended set of single-top and top-pair measurements from the Tevatron and the LHC and an increasing number of DY data, notably recent ATLAS gauge-boson-production distributions at 5 and 7 TeV and double-differential distributions for Z -boson production from ATLAS and CMS. More stringent kinematic cuts have been applied, which reduce the impact of higher-twist terms included in the analysis. The CJ15 [35] analysis determined the ratio d/u at NLO by including fixed-target DIS data at low Q and high x, which are otherwise excluded by kinematic cuts in other PDF analyses. In order to reduce theoretical bias, higher-twist contributions and nuclear effects important in this kinematic region were included in the analysis. In Fig. 4 the d/u ratio obtained from the CJ15 analysis at NLO is compared to the result obtained from the CT14HERA2 [36] and CT18 analyses at NNLO. The plot shows that the CT18 and CJ15 central predictions converge to different values at large x, respectively 0.1 and 0.2. Nevertheless, the CT18 and CJ15 results are compatible within uncertainties, although the CJ15 error band is much smaller than the CT18 one, possibly because the tolerance criterion is not adopted in the CJ15 analysis.The ABMP16 [33] PDF set is the only unpolarized PDF set determined in a scheme with a fixed number of flavors: for 3, 4 and 5 active flavors separately.

        <p>The JAM collaboration performed the first universal fit, JAM19 [37], a simultaneous determination of PDFs and fragmentation functions (FFs) at NLO from a global analysis of DIS, DY, SIDIS and electron-positron annihilation data. This fit is unique in its kind, as it allows investigation of the unpolarized sea-quark PDFs from semi-inclusive processes, whereby bias from the unknown FFs is minimized as much as possible. The fit revealed in particular a strong suppression of the strange PDF from kaon production, in contrast to what is found in all other PDF determinations, which deserves further investigation.The JAM collaboration performed the first universal fit, JAM19 [37], a simultaneous determination of PDFs and fragmentation functions (FFs) at NLO from a global analysis of DIS, DY, SIDIS and electron-positron annihilation data.

        <p>Finally, the HERAPDF2.0 set [39] has been updated into various PDF sets whereby the impact of specific measurements have been assessed by including them on top of a baseline dataset, made of DIS HERA data. These PDF determinations have been carried out at NNLO in perturbative QCD; electroweak and non-perturbative corrections have occasionally been included if deemed to be theoretically relevant for the description of the specific dataset analyzed. Examples of such PDF sets include the ATLAS-epWZ16 [40], the ATLAS-epWZtop [41], the CSKK [42] and the HERAPDF2.0Jets [43] PDF sets. They focus, respectively, on the impact of the ATLAS gauge boson production measurements [40], of the ATLAS top-pair production measurements [44,45], of the ATLAS and CMS gauge boson production measurements [40,46,47] and on the (multi-)jet production data in DIS from ZEUS and H1 (see [39] and references therein). In this last case, in particular, theoretical predictions were computed at NNLO with NNLOJET [48] for the first time. The new NNLO fit favors a value of the strong coupling α s (M Z ) = 0.1150 which is lower than that found at NLO, α s (M Z ) = 0.1183.

        <p>As we probe to the small-x region, we also encounter large logarithms arising from ln(1/x) terms. These can be resummed with the BFKL equation. (C.f., Refs. [49][50][51], and also Ref. [52] for an introduction.) These small-x resummation corrections have been implemented numerically [53,54] and incorporated into global PDF analyses [55,56]. These terms can yield an improved fit in the small-x region, especially for quantities such as F L , which is key for constraining the gluon PDF. As an additional remark, we note the small-x region is also phenomenologically relevant for the production of final states, for example, dijets in the forward-rapidity region of HERA, RHIC and LHC. In pp collisions, a final state of rapidity around 4 can probe momentum regions as low as x ∼ 10 -4 . Furthermore, in heavy-ion collisions it is believed that the small-x gluons form an over-occupied system needed for later thermalization of a quark-gluon plasma. A precise understanding of the gluon PDF at low x is, therefore, of uttermost importance and represents a domain where all of the analyses discussed above can be improved [56][57][58][59][60][61][62].

        <p>Should the unpolarized hard-scattering processes occur off nuclei instead of free nucleons, it is customary to assume that they can still be described in terms of factorization theorems [63]. Nuclear effects are then reabsorbed into PDFs, which differ from the unpolarized PDFs discussed in the previous section, and which are called nuclear PDFs. Within the current precision of the available data, this hypothesis is phenomenologically well supported. Recent progress in the phenomenological determination of nuclear PDFs has been mainly driven by the availability of hard probes in protonlead collisions at the LHC. Representative examples of such processes include dijet [64] and D-meson production [65] to constrain the gluon nuclear PDFs at small and large x, respectively, and W , Z production to constrain nuclear modifications to quark flavor separation [66]. These observables complement the existing information from neutral-current and chargedcurrent DIS structure functions as well as from proton-lead collision data from RHIC (see Ref. [8] for an overview). Several other processes could be added to global nuclear PDF fits in the future, such as photon production [24], low-mass DY, and possibly even top-quark pair production.Should the unpolarized hard-scattering processes occur off nuclei instead of free nucleons, it is customary to assume that they can still be described in terms of factorization theorems [63].

        <p>We refer the interested reader to Refs. [3,8] for a detailed comparison of all of these nuclear PDF sets.

First, the limited amount of experimental measurements, which results in large uncertainties on nuclear PDFs, especially for the gluon and the individual quark flavors. Second, the use, to some extent, of model-dependent assumptions, in particular to mimic shadowing and anti-shadowing effects as a function of x and of the atomic number A.We refer the interested reader to Refs.

        <p>Future facilities, specifically the LHeC and the EIC, will address the first of these limitations by extending the kinematic reach of the measurements to low values of x, see Fig. 1, as anticipated in several impact studies [71,73,74]. Reliable calculations from lattice QCD could add valuable information to address some of the remaining limitations. The calculation of nuclear PDFs using lattice QCD is in general more demanding than the computation of free-proton PDFs, in a way that grows with the number of nucleons in the nucleus. For this reason, only few pioneering results on very light nuclei are currently available. In particular, the NPLQCD collaboration computed the first moment of the unpolarized gluon distribution in nuclei up to A = 3 [75] (for deuteron and 3 He). These results are obtained at a higher-than-physical quark mass; as such, they should be viewed as a starting point for future developments.Future facilities, specifically the LHeC and the EIC, will address the first of these limitations by extending the kinematic reach of the measurements to low values of x, see Fig. 1, as anticipated in several impact studies [71,73,74].

The JAM17 analysis is unique in its kind, because it realizes a universal fit, that is, a simultaneous determination of the helicity PDFs and of the FFs of pions and kaons by means of an analysis of the SIDIS data. Because of this fact, theoretical assumptions on the SU(N f ) symmetry, which relate the first moments of the isotriplet and octet helicity PDF combinations to the weak decays of hadrons, can be relaxed.

        <p>The PDFs from the NNPDFpol1.1 sets are displayed, at a scale µ 2 = 10 GeV 2 in Fig. 5 for illustration purposes. The up quark valence distribution is the most constrained helicity PDF, primarily thanks to measurements of the proton structure function g 1 over a relatively broad range of x and Q 2 ; see Fig. 1. The corresponding down-quark distribution, which is opposite in sign, is smaller in magnitude and shows somewhat larger uncertainties. Nevertheless, a fair agreement between various PDF sets has been achieved for the valence polarizations, with differences originating from theoretical, experimental, and methodological choices generally being smaller than the PDF uncertainty (representing the uncertainty of the data). The polarization of the sea quarks is significantly smaller than the polarization of the valence quarks. It is also more dependent on the measurements included in each PDF set, and on the flavor assumptions with which the data are analyzed. Specifically, while all PDF sets show a fairly consistent anti-down polarization, the anti-up distribution is positive in the NNPDFpol1.1 PDF set, while it changes sign in the DSSV14 PDF set. The two results are, however, determined by measurements for two independent processes: the former by W -boson production, the latter by SIDIS.

        <p>theoretical predictions computed with the DSSV14 PDFs for the production of a W -boson systematically undershoot the data [91]. This fact suggests that a larger polarization of the up anti-quark is preferred. This difference is somewhat relieved in the JAM17 result, where the simultaneous determination of helicity PDFs and FFs generally leads to PDFs with larger uncertainties. The situation is more involved for the strange helicity PDF, which remains largely unconstrained from DIS data alone (see Section 2.4.3). Various theoretical models predict the sign and/or the size of the polarized light sea-quark distributions [92] from general physical considerations. However, predictions may differ significantly (and are sometimes opposite). Phenomenological evidence generally suggests that ∆ū &gt; ∆ d [93,94], a fact that disfavor meson cloud models [95][96][97][98]. Finally, the gluon helicity distribution has been established to be consistently sizeable and positive in both the DSSV14 and NNPDFpol1.1 analyses thanks to the availability of precise jet, dijet, and pion-production spinasymmetry measurements at RHIC. Such evidence, however, is limited to the region 0.02 ≲ x ≲ 0.4, outside of which the gluon helicity PDF is affected by large extrapolation uncertainties that prevent any definitive conclusion about its role in the proton spin decomposition. The extended kinematic region attained by a future polarized EIC (see Fig. 1) will be pivotal to clarify this picture, as demonstrated by several impact studies [99][100][101][102].theoretical predictions computed with the DSSV14 PDFs for the production of a W -boson systematically undershoot the data [91].

However, predictions may differ significantly (and are sometimes opposite). Phenomenological evidence generally suggests that ∆ū &gt; ∆ d [93,94], a fact that disfavor meson cloud models [95][96][97][98]. Finally, the gluon helicity distribution has been established to be consistently sizeable and positive in both the DSSV14 and NNPDFpol1.1 analyses thanks to the availability of precise jet, dijet, and pion-production spinasymmetry measurements at RHIC. Such evidence, however, is limited to the region 0.02 ≲ x ≲ 0.4, outside of which the gluon helicity PDF is affected by large extrapolation uncertainties that prevent any definitive conclusion about its role in the proton spin decomposition. The extended kinematic region attained by a future polarized EIC (see Fig. 1) will be pivotal to clarify this picture, as demonstrated by several impact studies [99][100][101][102].</p>
        <p>Transversity describes the correlation between the transverse polarizations of the nucleon and of its constituent partons. Because of its chiral-odd nature, it can be measured only in processes where it pairs to another chiral-odd object [103,104]. Historically, transversity was extracted for the first time in the framework of TMD factorization, by exploiting the Collins effect [105] in SIDIS measurements, whereby transversity couples to the chiral-odd Collins FF H ⊥ 1 [106]. This procedure may be prone to theoretical bias, because TMD evolution depends on nonperturbative parameters that are not very well constrained by experiment. Furthermore, it cannot be extended to pp collision measurements, for which TMD factorization is explicitly broken [107]. This limitation can be overcome by considering the Collins effect for a hadron detected inside a jet [108]. A hybrid framework can be established [109], where the TMD FF H ⊥ 1 is paired to the collinear PDF h 1 .Transversity describes the correlation between the transverse polarizations of the nucleon and of its constituent partons.

        <p>An alternative method was proposed to determine transversity in a fully collinear framework: it is based on the semiinclusive production of two hadrons inside the same current jet with small invariant mass [110,111]. The elementary mechanism consists in the correlation between the transverse polarization of the quark directly fragmenting into the two hadrons and their transverse relative momentum [112]. In this case, the dihadron SIDIS cross section (once integrated over partonic transverse momenta) contains a specific azimuthal modulation in the orientation of the plane containing the momenta of the two hadrons. The coefficient of this modulation is the simple product h 1 H ∢ 1 , where H ∢ 1 is a chiral-odd dihadron FF (DiFF) quantifying the above correlation [111,113,114]. The function H ∢ 1 can be independently determined from correlations between the azimuthal orientations of two hadron pairs in back-to-back jets produced in electronpositron annihilation [115][116][117][118]. Because of collinear factorization, it is possible to isolate the same combination h 1 H ∢ also in pp collisions [119], a fact that gives rise to an asymmetric azimuthal distribution of the final hadron pair when one of the two initial protons is transversely polarized [120].An alternative method was proposed to determine transversity in a fully collinear framework: it is based on the semiinclusive production of two hadrons inside the same current jet with small invariant mass [110,111].

        <p>Experimental measurements of the asymmetric azimuthal distribution of π + π -pairs in SIDIS have been collected by the HERMES collaboration for a proton target [121] and by the COMPASS collaboration for both proton and deuteron targets [122,123], summing up to 22 independent data points. The azimuthal asymmetry in the distribution of backto-back π + π -pairs in e + e -annihilation was firstly measured by the BELLE collaboration [124], a fact that opened the way to the first parametrization of H ∢ 1 [117]. In turn, this result was used in combination with the SIDIS data to extract the valence components of h 1 [125][126][127] at leading-order (LO) accuracy. The STAR collaboration recently released results for the predicted asymmetry of π + π -pairs produced from pp collisions with a transversely polarized proton at the center-of-mass energy of √ s = 200 GeV [128]. The first extraction of transversity from a global analysis of all of these data sets was, therefore, carried out in Ref. [129] at LO, where the bootstrap method [126,127] was used to propagate the data uncertainty into the PDF uncertainty. We will call this analysis PV18 in the remainder of the paper. The STAR collaboration subsequently released measurements at √ s = 500 GeV [108], that need to be included in future updates of the fit. The overall experimental information amounts to approximately 50 independent data points covering the range 0.008 &lt; x &lt; 0.35, about two orders of magnitude less than for the analysis of unpolarized PDFs, see Fig. 1.Experimental measurements of the asymmetric azimuthal distribution of π + π -pairs in SIDIS have been collected by the HERMES collaboration for a proton target [121] and by the COMPASS collaboration for both proton and deuteron targets [122,123], summing up to 22 independent data points.

[129]. The error band corresponds to the 90% confidence level (CL), and includes also a systematic theoretical error induced by the currently unconstrained gluon contribution to DiFF [129]. It turns out that the transversity for the valence down quark is very sensitive to this uncertainty. The plain (cyan) band is the result of the MEX19 constrained fit of Ref. [136]; error bands correspond to the 90% CL. The Soffer bound is represented in a limited range by a gray line using the unpolarized and helicity PDFs from the LO MSTW08 [133] and the NLO DSSV08 [134] sets, respectively. At small x, the error on the bound (still negligible in comparison to the current overall uncertainties on the transversity PDF) increases due to the uncertainties in both parametrizations. This is, however, inconsequential for valence distributions, which are suppressed by evolution. From Fig. 6 we observe that the two determinations are consistent within uncertainties, although the larger uncertainty on the valence down quark at large x can be appreciated in the fit of Ref. [136] as a consequence of releasing the Soffer bound. Nevertheless, PDF shapes and uncertainties are comparable to those determined in TMD analyses of the Collins effect [137,138], including a dedicated study on the role of the Soffer bound on the tensor charge [139]. The Soffer bound was completely released in [140]. In all cases, the uncertainty bands remain large; future developments will depend on a detailed study of flavor dependence of DiFFs by using BELLE data for dihadron multiplicities [141], and on including in the global fit also the STAR data at higher center-of-mass energy [108].

        <p>Lattice QCD regularizes QCD on a finite Euclidean lattice by means of numerical computations of QCD correlation functions in the path-integral formalism, using methods adapted from statistical mechanics. Of particular interest for this report, are novel methods to access information on PDFs using lattice QCD. This is a very challenging task, as distribution functions are light-cone quantities and cannot be calculated on a Euclidean lattice. A few methods have been proposed, some as early as the 1990s, and others very recently. This includes, studies based on the hadronic tensor [142][143][144], auxiliary quark field approaches [145,146], large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) [147][148][149] quasi-PDFs, pseudo-PDFs [150], a method based on OPE [151], and the lattice good cross sections approach [152][153][154]. These methods share some commonalities, but they have also differences. This discussion, while interesting, is beyond the scope of this document. We refer the Reader to Ref.

        <p>The unpolarized PDFs (top left plot) in the positive isovector quark region, the lattice results agree with CT14 [184], which is consistent with NNPDF3.1 [23] and CJ15 [35], up to the small-x region, where even larger zP 3 data are required for lattice calculations to have control over these regions. It should be noted, that the large-x region as obtained from lattice calculations poses challenges related to the reconstruction of the x dependence from a finite number of lattice data. Therefore, the comparison between different lattice calculations, as well as with global fits, is meaningful in the intermediate-x region. The middle plot of Fig. 7 shows a collection of the lattice results for the helicity PDFs, obtained in Refs. [177,179]. The lattice results are compared to two phenomenological fits, NNPDFpol1.1 [78] and JAM17 [80], exhibiting nice agreement. The bottom plot in Fig. 7 shows the lattice results for the transversity PDFs [178,180], and the global analysis by PV18 and LMPSS17 [185]. It is interesting to observe the accuracy of lattice calculations, as compared to the global fits applied only on experimental data. Nevertheless, there are still systematic uncertainties that are yet to be fully understood, such as, discretization effect and reconstruction of the x-dependence. The equivalent anti-quark contributions to the unpolarized, helicity, and transversity PDFs, are shown in the left panels, from top to bottom, respectively. It should be emphasized that the anti-quark region is susceptible to systematic uncertainties, and in particular the inverse problem arising in the reconstruction of the x-dependence. As a consequence, extracting conclusions on the flavor asymmetry is premature, and further study of systematic effects is imperative. ETMC refined the matching procedure by proposing a modified MS scheme, which satisfies particle number conservation for their unpolarized and helicity PDFs [179] and transversity [180] at physical pion mass. Note that this scheme is used for the quasi-PDFs, while the light-cone PDFs (see Eq. ( 1)) are always renormalized in the MS scheme. These calculations were done using the momenta 0.83, 1.11, and 1.38 GeV, since they had difficulty reliably extracting the ground state when increasing the momentum to values higher than 1.5 GeV; the largest P 3 PDFs results are shown in Fig. 7. The unpolarized PDF has a slope similar to the phenomenological one in the positive-x region, but lies above it. Both the helicity and transversity distributions are compatible with the phenomenological PDFs for x ≲ 0.4-0.5. Interestingly, the statistical accuracy of the aforementioned lattice results is better than either phenomenological determination. Nevertheless the preceding discrepancies indicate that systematic uncertainties far outweigh the statistical ones. ETMC also studied several sources of systematic uncertainty at the physical point: excited-state contamination, renormalization, reconstruction of the x-dependence, effects of truncating the Fourier transform, and different matching prescriptions in a followup work [181].The unpolarized PDFs (top left plot) in the positive isovector quark region, the lattice results agree with CT14 [184], which is consistent with NNPDF3.1 [23] and CJ15 [35], up to the small-x region, where even larger zP 3 data are required for lattice calculations to have control over these regions.

        <p>LP3 Collaboration have studied several sources of systematic uncertainty in their newer PDF results [176] on an ensemble at the physical pion mass with boost momenta around 2.2, 2.6 and 3.0 GeV. Excited-state systematics are carefully studied using five source-sink separations and including up to two excited-state related matrix elements; the excited-state systematics errors are reflected in the final statistics.

        <p>The first study of systematic uncertainties arising from finite-volume effects for the quasi-distributions was reported in Ref. [186] using a 220-MeV pion mass with M val π L ≈ 3.3, 4.4 and 5.5, respectively. After a careful extraction of the bare matrix elements for the unpolarized and polarized distributions (see the unpolarized example in Fig. 8), no volume dependence was observed in these ensembles within the statistical error. It was, therefore, concluded that finite-volume dependence does not play a significant role for the boosted nucleon matrix elements (P 3 ≈ 1.3 GeV and larger) used for quasi-distributions within the range M val π L ∈ {3.3, 5.5}.

        <p>To calculate the small-x (x &lt; 0.01) behavior of the PDFs using existing lattice x-dependent methods, one needs to pursue boost momenta P 3 an order of magnitude higher than those currently being used. The minimum x obtainable from lattice QCD is connected to the product of the length of the Wilson line and momentum boost, zP 3 . It is also expected that the size of the momentum boost is connected to the reliability of the lattice results in the various x regions. For example, the matrix elements of higher values of P 3 decrease significantly faster, and therefore, the truncation of the maximum value of z in the Fourier transform matters less. There are a number of proposals to avoid Fourier transforming by working in position space; this would work in an ideal world where there is arbitrarily precise data throughout the large-zP 3 region. However, in reality, the lattice data taken in the small-zP 3 region are not precise enough to even discern whether the parton distribution is flat across all regions of x in the case of the pion distribution amplitude [187]; one loses sensitivity to very distinct distributions in x-space, which appear very similar in zP 3 space. Furthermore, one still needs large boost momenta zP 3 to reliably obtain the distribution in the small-x region, and very fine lattice spacing, a &lt; 0.02 fm to reduce the lattice discretization systematic error that goes like (P 3 a) n .

        <p>Besides quasi-PDFs, additional novel methods have been proposed for the extraction of light-cone distributions [142,145,146,151,152,154,[189][190][191][192][193]. One of these methods is the so-called pseudo-distributions approach, originally proposed by Radyushkin [150,[194][195][196][197][198][199][200]. The raw data are the same as in the quasi-PDFs approach, but the analysis differs in several ways. In the pseudo-PDFs approach, the matrix elements are expressed in terms of z 2 and of the Ioffe time [201] ν ≡ -p • z (where p is the nucleon momentum boost), and are called Ioffe-time distributions. One of the main differences between quasi-and pseudo-PDFs is the reconstruction of the x-dependence of the distributions: quasi-PDFs are defined as the Fourier transform of the matrix elements in z, while pseudo-PDFs as the transform in Ioffe time. As a consequence, pseudo-distributions have canonical support (x ∈ [-1 : 1]), while quasi-PDFs are allowed to be nonzero outside the canonical x-range. Another major difference of practical value is that the Ioffe time can increase by either increasing z or p. In general, lattice data at small values of the momentum boost are also desirable. However, for large z values there is dominance from higher-twist contributions. In addition, model-dependence enters in the reconstruction of the light-cone distributions.Besides quasi-PDFs, additional novel methods have been proposed for the extraction of light-cone distributions [142,145,146,151,152,154,[189][190][191][192][193].

        <p>The pseudo-distribution approach was investigated on the lattice soon after it was proposed. The valence unpolarized PDF of the nucleon was studied first in the quenched setup [202], and later using dynamical simulations at m π = 400 MeV [203]. The pion PDFs were also studied in Ref. [204]. Other work related to the pseudo-PDFs approach on the lattice can be found in Ref. [205,206]. A recent calculation including an ensemble near physical pion mass (170 MeV) is presented in Ref. [183]. The maximum value of P 3 used for the ensembles with pion mass 358, 278, and 179 MeV is 2.46, 3.29, and 2.12 GeV, respectively. In Fig. 7 we show the valence PDF extrapolated to the physical pion mass using the aforementioned ensembles, as explained in Ref. [183]. It is important to emphasize that, unlike the case of quasi-PDFs, the final PDFs do not rely on a sole value of P 3 . The relevant parameter for the reconstruction of the PDFs is the Ioffe time, which can be increased by increasing either z or P 3 . Typically, data at large P 3 are more noisy, and, therefore, do not drive the values of the final PDFs. The lattice results of Ref. [183] are compared to various determinations from global fits.

        <p>In the hadronic tensor approach, additional parton degrees of freedom are revealed graphically, among which, the connected sea (CS) antipartons which account for the Gottfried sum-rule violation [142,221]. It is shown from the operator product expansion that the parton degrees of freedom in the hadronic tensor are the same as those in the quasi-PDF approach [222]. In particular, the quasi-PDF in the negative-x region of the connected insertion is identified as the connected sea parton in the hadronic tensor formulation. Furthermore, the renormalization and mixing between the glue and quarks for the moments reveals that the connected insertion can mix into glue and the disconnected insertion, but not vice versa. There are no valence-like partons in the strange and glue partons. This is reflected in the extended evolution equations [223], which distinguish the connected sea from the disconnected sea partons.

        <p>Numerically, a substantial challenge of this approach is to convert the hadronic tensor from the Euclidean space back to the Minkowski space, which involves solving an inverse problem of a Laplacian transform [218][219][220]. In order to tackle this problem, three methods (i.e., the Backus-Gilbert method [224][225][226], the maximum entropy method [227,228] and the Bayesian reconstruction method [229]) have been implemented and tested [219,220]. It is believed that the Bayesian reconstruction method and its further improved version [230,231] is the best method so far to solve the problem. On the other hand, the inverse problem is a common problem in PDF calculations, and can be simplified or avoided by using model-inspired fitting functions.Numerically, a substantial challenge of this approach is to convert the hadronic tensor from the Euclidean space back to the Minkowski space, which involves solving an inverse problem of a Laplacian transform [218][219][220]. In order to tackle this problem, three methods (i.e., the Backus-Gilbert method [224][225][226], the maximum entropy method [227,228] and the Bayesian reconstruction method [229]) have been implemented and tested [219,220].

        <p>Another challenge of this approach is to access high momentum and energy transfers in such a way that the calculation can be extended into the DIS region. Numerical tests [220] show that small lattice spacings are essential for this purpose. The need of fine lattices appears to be a common problem faced by the lattice PDF community. For the hadronic tensor calculation, one important point is that it works in all the energy ranges (from elastic scattering to inelastic scattering and on to DIS). Before lattices with very fine spacing are available, the hadronic tensor can be used to study the nucleon elastic form factors and low-energy scatterings such as the neutrino-nucleon scattering which is of significant physical importance. Fig. 11 shows a numerical check of this approach in terms of form factors on the RBC-UKQCD 32Ifine lattice [232]. The structure function of the elastic scattering from the hadronic tensor, a 4-point function, is the product of the elastic nucleon form factors for the currents involved. Fig. 11 shows that the electric form factors (connected insertions only) calculated by means of the 3-point functions for both u and d quarks are found to be consistent with errors with those deduced from the hadronic tensor. This lays a solid foundation for further calculations. Currently, lattices with lattice spacing ∼0.04 fm are suitable, for instance, to study the neutrino-nucleus scattering for DUNE experiments where the neutrino energy is between about 1 to 7 GeV. At the same time, these lattices can also be used to explore the pion PDFs. In the future, working on lattices with lattice spacing of 0.03 fm or even smaller would be desirable for studying the nucleon substructure.Another challenge of this approach is to access high momentum and energy transfers in such a way that the calculation can be extended into the DIS region.

        <p>In this Section, we review some aspects of potential interplay between lattice-QCD computations and PDF fits. First, we update the benchmark of lattice-QCD and global fit results for the lowest moments of unpolarized and helicity PDFs, in continuity with the previous [1], and extend it to transversity. Second, we investigate the usage of lattice-QCD data in fits of unpolarized PDFs. Third, we discuss how lattice-QCD computations can shed light on the poorly known unpolarized and helicity strange PDFs.In this Section, we review some aspects of potential interplay between lattice-QCD computations and PDF fits.

        <p>In the 2017 PDFLattice white paper we appraised each source of systematic uncertainty in the lattice-QCD results by means of a rating system, defined in Sec. (3.1.2) of [1]. Specifically, we considered the following sources of systematic uncertainties: discretization effects and extrapolation to the continuum limit (DE); chiral extrapolation to unphysical pion masses (CE); finite-volume effects (FV); choice of renormalization (RE); and excited state contamination (ES). The rating system, which is inspired to that adopted by the Flavor Lattice Averaging Group FLAG) [234], awards a blue star (⋆) for sources of uncertainty that are well controlled or very conservatively estimated, a blue circle (•) for sources of uncertainty that have been controlled or estimated to some extent, and a red square (■) for uncertainties that have not met our criteria or for which no estimate is given. The details of the rating system are further summarized in Table 2 for the reader's convenience.In the 2017 PDFLattice white paper we appraised each source of systematic uncertainty in the lattice-QCD results by means of a rating system, defined in Sec.

        <p>Our criteria and the corresponding ratings are chosen to provide as fair an assessment of the various calculations as possible, and are not intended to discredit the merits of any of them.

        <p>Furthermore, modifications to this rating system will occur as the lattice-QCD results evolve. For instance, the renormalization rating (RE) can be expanded in order to account, in more detail, for the renormalization, mixing and normalization (e.g. the finite Z A for the computation of g A ) aspects of each computation. These aspects are particularly important for some benchmark moments: in the case of unpolarized PDF moments, the computation of ⟨x⟩ u + -d + requires both renormalization and normalization to be treated properly, in order to ensure that the valence number sum rule is satisfied; in the case of helicity PDF moments, renormalization and normalization should also be treated carefully to ensure that the anomalous Ward identity is satisfied. An extended rating of all of these aspects seems advisable, especially in light of the fact that results with different treatments of renormalization and normalization can visibly differ within systematic uncertainties, and should therefore be considered in the future.Furthermore, modifications to this rating system will occur as the lattice-QCD results evolve.

        <p>In comparison to the 2017 PDFLattice white paper, some new lattice-QCD computations were performed, which we summarize in Table 3 and rate according to the criteria defined in Table 2. New results, mostly for N f = 2 + 1 + 1 and N f = 2 + 1 dynamical flavors, were computed at a scale µ = 2 GeV, including for ⟨x⟩ g .

We report these values at µ = 2 GeV in Table 4, where we also display the PDFLattice17 benchmark value [1] for comparison. We recall that this value was determined as the unweighted average of the NNPDF3.1 [23], CT14 [184], MMHT14 [18], ABMP16 [33] (with N f = 4 flavors), CJ15 [35] and HERAPDF2.0 [39] analyses (see Table 3.5 of Ref.

For global analyses of experimental data, given the lack of new results, we take the 2017 PDFLattice average. We recall that it was determined as the unweighted average of the NNPDFpol1.1 [78], DSSV08 [134] and JAM15 [135] analyses.

        <p>As is apparent from Fig. 13 and Tables 6-7 there is an overall fair agreement between lattice-QCD computations and phenomenological fits, except for some discrepancies in the results for the individual flavor components of the axial charge. Contrary to the case of unpolarized moments, the uncertainties of the two are of comparable size. We note however that the uncertainties on the global fit result might be underestimated because of extrapolation into the smalland large-x regions, where data are less abundant. In the case of ⟨1⟩ ∆s + the lattice result is compatible with the JAM17 result, within its large uncertainties, but not with the PDFLattice17 average. As noted above, this is a consequence of the theoretical bias associated to the assumption of SU(3) flavor asymmetry in the latter. We finally remark that current uncertainties on g A do not discriminate among lattice-QCD results obtained with a different numbers of dynamical flavors.As is apparent from Fig. 13 and Tables 6-7 there is an overall fair agreement between lattice-QCD computations and phenomenological fits, except for some discrepancies in the results for the individual flavor components of the axial charge.

This constraint avoided extrapolation errors below x min [129]; the missing contribution from the [0, x min ] region was estimated to affect the tensor charge at the O(1%) level [129]. In the MEX19 analysis, extrapolation was controlled by choosing a parametrization that ensured the integrability of h 1 by construction.As is apparent from Fig. 14 and Tables 9-10, the results obtained from a global analysis of experimental data are affected by uncertainties which are significantly larger than those of their lattice counterparts as well as than those of their unpolarized and helicity companions.

        <p>From Fig. 14, we also conclude that most determinations of the tensor charge from global fits are compatible with each other. The compatibility with lattice results is a little more involved. While there is compatibility for ⟨1⟩ δd -(within large uncertainties), there is a clear tension (up to 2σ ) for ⟨1⟩ δu -and, consequently, for g T . In particular, the JAM18 result is compatible with the lattice prediction for g T by construction, but it is largely incompatible for the flavor-diagonal tensor charges. The JAM20 result is the only one that is compatible with all of the lattice tensor charges; it clearly supersedes JAM18 and confirms how crucial it is to pursue global fits from large independent data sets. However, the JAM20 analysis has some relevant limitations (for example, it does not include effects from TMD evolution, which might be important when connecting SIDIS data to e + e -and hadronic collision data at much higher scales); because of the still large error bars, this result is also compatible with other phenomenological outcomes, and in particular with the global fit PV18. In conclusion, the issue of compatibility of tensor charges obtained from lattice calculations and from phenomenological fits still requires further studies.From Fig. 14, we also conclude that most determinations of the tensor charge from global fits are compatible with each other.

Here, the data of these lattice observables play the same role as experimental data that can be used for extracting PDFs.

        <p>In the case of lattice QCD, computations of PDF moments have improved for unpolarized, helicity and transversity moments. In particular, N f = 2 + 1 + 1 has now become a standard, and new techniques are allowing for a realistic characterization of most of the systematic uncertainties involved in the computation. Lattice QCD has also witnessed a spectacular flourishing of ideas to determine the x-dependence of PDFs. These ideas, prompted by the seminal concept of quasi-PDFs, include, for instance, pseudo-distributions and good lattice cross sections. Most of these methods are still at an exploratory stage, which was, however, able to demonstrate the applicability of each method and their main theoretical challenges. In particular the quasi-PDF approach is currently entering a more advanced phase, in which a better characterization of systematic uncertainties and various technical and theoretical challenges are being addressed. As a result, the x dependence of PDFs determined from lattice QCD has become comparable to that of PDFs determined in global fits, for which experimental information is scarce.In the case of lattice QCD, computations of PDF moments have improved for unpolarized, helicity and transversity moments. In particular, N f = 2 + 1 + 1 has now become a standard, and new techniques are allowing for a realistic characterization of most of the systematic uncertainties involved in the computation. Lattice QCD has also witnessed a spectacular flourishing of ideas to determine the x-dependence of PDFs. These ideas, prompted by the seminal concept of quasi-PDFs, include, for instance, pseudo-distributions and good lattice cross sections. Most of these methods are still at an exploratory stage, which was, however, able to demonstrate the applicability of each method and their main theoretical challenges.

        <p>In the endeavor of improving the precision and the accuracy of PDFs, the cross-talk between global fits and lattice QCD will remain fundamental. On the one hand, global analyses should be used to appraise lattice QCD by means of extensive benchmarks. On the other hand, lattice QCD could be exploited to inform global analyses by means of specific inputs, such as lattice data, in particular whenever experimental information is scarce. Such a cross-talk may shed light on some unknown or not understood features of PDFs, such as the content of unpolarized and helicity strange quarks in the proton (and its relationship with SU(N f ) violations), or the distribution of transversely polarized quarks.In the endeavor of improving the precision and the accuracy of PDFs, the cross-talk between global fits and lattice QCD will remain fundamental.

        <p>More than half a century after the first discovery of the nucleon's internal structure, we still know little about its three-dimensional structure, which is described in terms of the generalized parton distributions (GPDs). Interest in GPDs has proliferated since they were first introduced in the late 90s [270][271][272], because of the unique insight they provide into the spatial distribution of quarks and gluons inside the proton [273], as well as its mechanical properties, including angular momentum, pressure, and shear forces [274]. We refer to Refs. [275][276][277][278] for extensive reviews and in Refs. [273,279,280] for physical interpretation of GPDs. While the latter are encoded in the QCD energy-momentum tensor, which is canonically probed through gravity, it was realized by Ji [271] that its matrix elements between proton states can be described through Mellin moments of GPDs. GPDs, therefore, bring the energy-momentum tensor matrix elements within experimental grasp through electromagnetic scattering. GPDs can be viewed as a hybrid of parton distributions (PDFs), form factors, and distribution amplitudes. For example, the forward limit of the unpolarized and helicity GPDs lead to the f 1 (x) and g 1 (x) PDFs respectively. Also, taking the integral over x at finite values of the momentum transfer results in the form factors and generalized form factors. In the case of the unpolarized GPDs, for example, one obtains the Dirac (F 1 ) and Pauli (F 2 ) FFs. Several of these limits of the GPDs have physical interpretation, for instance, the spin decomposition of the proton using Ji's sum rule [271]. Experimentally, they can be accessed in exclusive processes such as deeply virtual Compton scattering or meson electroproduction [281]. Determining GPDs is an important mission of the US Department of Energy (DOE), drawing global scientific interest. Experimental collaborations and facilities worldwide have been devoted to searching for these last unknowns of the nucleon, including HERMES at DESY, COMPASS at CERN, GSI in Europe, BELLE and JPAC in Japan, Halls A, B, and C at Jefferson Laboratory, and PHENIX and STAR at RHIC (Brookhaven National Laboratory) in the US. The study of GPDs and their imaging, or nucleon femtography, has led both the QCD and hadronic physics community worldwide to propose building an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) to further explore these quantities [12]. In Europe, CERN has plans for the LHeC, adding an electron accelerator to the existing LHC hadron accelerator.

        <p>Like the PDFs, GPDs are nonperturbative parton-parton correlation functions. They are not direct physical observables since no quark or gluon has been observed in isolation, owing to QCD color confinement. Lattice QCD cannot calculate GPDs directly since they are defined in terms of operators with lightlike separation between the parton fields. GPDs are connected to various physical observables through QCD factorization. For example, the deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) cross-section can be expressed in terms of Compton form factors (CFFs). The latter, are factorized into GPDs convoluted over the variable x with perturbatively calculated short-distance coefficient functions [275][276][277][278]282]. In addition to the four chiral even GPDs, we have four more quark-flip/chiral odd GPDs, H T , E T , HT and ẼT and four gluon GPDs, H g , E g , Hg and Ẽg .

        <p>Deeply virtual exclusive processes are measured in coincidence experiments where all the final state particles are directly or indirectly detected. Extracting GPDs from data involves a much larger number of variables than extracting PDFs. Furthermore, each experiment can only add a small piece to the picture.

More sophisticated analyses are being developed working towards this goal, and a significant research effort has been focused on applying machine-learning tools to the extraction of GPDs from data (Section 3.5).Deeply virtual exclusive processes are measured in coincidence experiments where all the final state particles are directly or indirectly detected.

        <p>To be able to rely on various models is particularly important for the study of GPDs because of the additional constraints that have to be satisfied compared to PDFs and other one-dimensional quantities. Time reversal and Parity conservation generate discrete symmetries obeyed by GPDs for ξ → -ξ , x → -x. Lorentz invariance generates the property of polynomiality, namely that the x j moments of quark GPDs are even polynomials in ξ , and that x j-1 moments of gluon GPDs are even polynomials in ξ (see also Section 3.4.3). Finally, from the norm of the Hilbert space, one obtains positivity constraints, or inequalities between GPDs and the corresponding PDFs [275,277,278]. Under these constraints, the behavior of GPDs, including their perturbative evolution, can be tracked down and monitored using models.To be able to rely on various models is particularly important for the study of GPDs because of the additional constraints that have to be satisfied compared to PDFs and other one-dimensional quantities.

        <p>In lattice QCD, there are several challenges in calculating quasi-GPDs. In contrast with the PDFs, the extraction of GPDs is more challenging because they require momentum transfer, Q 2 , between the initial (source) and final (sink) states. Another complication is that the GPDs are defined in the Breit frame, in which the momentum transfer is equally distributed to the initial and final states. Working in the Breit frame has no conceptual difficulty, however, it increases the computational cost, as separate calculations are necessary for each value of the momentum transfer.

        <p>To aid a quantitative analysis, one can draw information from models. Building a relatively simple model to evaluate GPDs can help to understand some of the essential features of the pseudo-pdfs approach. For example, the reggeized diquark model [286] can be used to have a better understanding of the ''off-the-light-cone'' behavior of the PDFs/GPDs and to put more stringent constraints on the onset of perturbative behavior in coordinate space. In models, one has the flexibility to perform calculations that mimic the equal time constraint on the lattice. Instead of obtaining the usual light-cone PDF, f (x), using this procedure, one obtains the off-the-light-cone PDFs which are a function of k 3 and P 3 . Upon performing the Fourier transform in k 3 , one obtains the Ioffe-time distributions, which are now a function of z and P 3 or, equivalently, the two Lorentz scalars P • z and z 2 . One expects that as z 2 tends to zero and P 3 increases, the pseudo Ioffe-time distribution approaches the light-cone Ioffe-time distribution. This is illustrated in Fig. 26.To aid a quantitative analysis, one can draw information from models.

        <p>Moving off forward, one can repeat a similar exercise for the GPDs. The presence of an additional vector ∆ introduces, in coordinate space, the dependence on another Lorentz scalar ∆ • z. For zero skewness, this quantity is zero for GPDs on the light-cone. For pseudo-GPDs, however, this is no longer true. Hence, in addition to z 2 , which captures the ''off the light-coneness'' of pseudo PDFs, one also has a dependence on ∆ • z for zero skewness. Model calculations of pseudo GPDs at zero skewness reveal that the dependence on ∆ • z is more pronounced at larger t.Moving off forward, one can repeat a similar exercise for the GPDs.

        <p>Complementary to calculating nonlocal operators on the lattice is the evaluation of Mellin moments of PDFs. While having their own set of complications in evaluating higher moments, they provide valuable input for a completely independent way of obtaining the PDFs. In the target rest frame, Ioffe time ν ≡ P • z quantifies the distance along the light-cone that the quark fields describing the PDF are separated by. In this sense, it is a natural candidate for separating the short distance from the long-distance physics. Using the Mellin moments, one can map out the Ioffe-time behavior of the PDF for smaller Ioffe time values. Having more moments allows one to describe the Ioffe-time behavior of the PDF for higher and higher values of ν. On the other hand, the large Ioffe-time behavior is characterized by a term of the form ν -α , which essentially captures the small-x physics.Complementary to calculating nonlocal operators on the lattice is the evaluation of Mellin moments of PDFs.

        <p>Deeply virtual exclusive processes are measured in coincidence experiments where all the final state particles are either directly or indirectly detected. Therefore, extracting GPDs from data involves a much larger number of variables than in inclusive deep inelastic scattering.

            <rs type="software">PARTONS (</rs>
            <rs type="software">Partonic Tomography of Nucleon Software</rs>) is a platform that handles multiple experimental channels where most of the tasks are automated, allowing the users to set physics assumptions at various point of the computation [285]. This is achieved by splitting experimental channels into three pieces (see Fig. 28), accordingly to the framework of collinear factorization. The large distance part contains the physics related to GPDs themselves. Various models [290,347] are provided, together with leading-order evolution routines [348]. The second step consists of the computations of amplitudes from GPDs. Next-to-leading order computations of Compton form factors (CFFs) are also available. Finally, CFFs are connected to observables. 
            <rs type="software">PARTONS</rs> has been used in recent extractions of CFF from experimental data, using both functional parametrizations [349] and artificial neural networks (ANNs) [350]. This analysis focuses on the suppression of any model dependence and the careful estimation of uncertainties. This was achieved by using separate neural networks for the real and imaginary parts of each CFF and avoiding any prefactors driving the functional forms of CFFs. The replica method was used to propagate uncertainties, while the early-stopping regularization method was utilized to provide the anticipated growth of uncertainties in the unconstrained kinematic domains. The networks are trained to nearly all available DVCS data with the genetic algorithm.

        <p>Traditional QCD global fits to extract GPDs from data are particularly challenging because of the complexity of the higher-order Wilson coefficient functions (replacing C ± in Eqs. ( 42) and ( 43)). Also, the relative momentum fraction, x, of GPDs is only indirectly accessible from experiments through the ξ -dependence of CFFs. It is particularly complicated to extract GPDs with an accurate flavor separation and determination of the scale dependence, with a similar accuracy level to what has been accomplished for PDFs. With the present kinematic coverage of experiments worldwide, it has not been possible to perform global fits of GPDs that span from the valence region measured in fixed-target experiments to the small-x, accessible at high energy colliders. What makes such a global analysis very demanding is, first of all, as mentioned above, that GPDs need to fulfill a set of properties derived from the symmetries of QCD, such as positivity and polynomiality. Fulfilling both at the same time has been a long issue for GPD phenomenologists. Recently, new modeling techniques have been introduced that might solve this longstanding issue [359] but have not been applied in practical fits. Another significant difference with PDFs is that the CFFs from which GPDs are extracted enter the cross-section in bilinear forms. Therefore, GPDs corresponding to different polarization configurations all contribute to specific helicity states of the various observables: for example, in DVCS, the unpolarized structure function, F UU,T [283], contains both the vector, H, E, and axial-vector, H, Ẽ, GPDs (the other polarization configurations behave similarly). As a result, to extract information from the experiment, many more observables need to be analyzed simultaneously. This is what motivated, for instance, the first attempts to global fits in Refs. [289,355]. To determine the various observables that are necessary to extract GPDs from data, current experimental programs at Jefferson Lab, COMPASS at CERN and J-PARC are set to measure DVCS and the crossed channel reactions to DVCS, namely both TCS, γ p → p ′ µ + µ - [360][361][362], and the exclusive Drell-Yan process, π ± p → p ′ µ + µ - [363].

It should also be noticed that factorization has not been proven for transversely polarized virtual photon exchange, which dominates the process in this case, and that the quark flip process involves a beyond leading-twist pion lightfront wave function.

That is, instead of having a number density f (x) of partons per unit of lightcone momentum fraction x, one has a density f (x, k T ) of partons per unit of both the momentum fraction x and the (small) transverse momentum components. A similar relation exists between standard fragmentation functions and TMD fragmentation functions. Standard factorization theorems involve collinear PDFs (and fragmentation functions) only, whereas situations that use TMD PDFs require a different kind of ''TMD'' factorization theorem [372].The TMD PDF concept, in the most basic sense, directly extends the ordinary PDF concept to incorporate dependence on the parton's transverse momentum.

        <p>The extensive field of research into which the study of TMD PDFs has developed at the time of this writing originated contemporaneously with the initial investigations of collinear PDFs. Building on first intuitive notions based on number densities in the parton model [373,374], field theoretic formulations were advanced in Refs. [375][376][377][378], leading up to the derivation of the Collins-Soper (CS) equation [379] describing TMD evolution, and the Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) formalism [372].

Whereas the associated Sivers TMD was initially thought to be forbidden by PT invariance [106], it was subsequently shown [389] that a Sivers-type asymmetry indeed arises in processes such as semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS), and this forced the development of more mature TMD PDF definitions incorporating sophisticated Wilson line structures [390].

        <p>Collinear factorization relies on processes being rather inclusive, such that the details of small variations in parton transverse momentum are not important. Transverse-momentum-dependent PDFs (TMD PDFs), by contrast, arise in less inclusive processes, particularly where low, and especially nonperturbative, transverse momentum transfer is important. There are a number of processes where a complete QCD treatment calls for the TMD PDF concept. These include especially cross sections differential in a measured transverse momentum -so-called multiscale processes, where there is an overall physical hard scale (usually labeled Q ) and a transverse momentum which may also be hard in some regions but is typically very different from Q . Drell-Yan scattering is a classic example of this. There, the overall hard scale is set by the invariant energy Q of the produced dilepton pair, while the total transverse momentum of the pair q T provides the transverse momentum dependence. For a cross section integrated over q T , collinear factorization is relevant, whereas cross sections differential in q T require a form of TMD factorization, especially in the region q T ≪ Q (we denote |q T | ≡ q T here and in the following). More on this example follows below. The information about transverse degrees of freedom is essential in many noninclusive collider observables [412]. The sensitivity to a nonperturbative intrinsic transverse momentum is especially exciting from the perspective of hadron structure also because the intrinsic transverse momentum may couple in nontrivial ways with spin degrees of freedom. Early classic work on TMD structures [401] enumerated the substantial number of TMD PDFs that can arise once a transverse momentum degree of freedom is allowed for the parton.Collinear factorization relies on processes being rather inclusive, such that the details of small variations in parton transverse momentum are not important.

        <p>In this section, we provide more details on the definition of TMD PDFs. Classification of TMD PDFs. First, we note that TMD PDFs can be classified according to the scheme used for the hard factor H ij in (47). In the original formulation by Collins, Soper and Sterman, often referred to as CSS1, one has H ij = 1 such that the hard factor is effectively absorbed into the TMD PDFs [372]. In its revised formulation (CSS2) due to Collins [398], see also [402], H ij is defined as the form factor of the Drell-Yan process in the MS scheme. This scheme choice is also adopted by formulations of TMD factorization employing soft-collinear effective theory (SCET) [420][421][422][423]. Lastly, TMD PDFs as introduced by Ji, Ma and Yuan (JMY) [424] employ a scheme where H ij depends not only on the MS-renormalization scale µ, but also on an additional parameter ρ related to the regulation of rapidity divergences, which we discuss below. All of these formulations are perturbatively related to each other, and explicit relations are given in [425,426]. 8 The unfortunate overlapping use of the notation b T for two distinct objects in the TMD PDF and GPD literatures should be noted. In the GPD literature, b T denotes the impact parameter of the struck quark with respect to the center of momentum of the hadron; it is Fourier conjugate to the momentum transfer ∆ T . In the TMD PDF literature, b T denotes the Fourier conjugate to the transverse momentum k T of the struck quark, corresponding to a relative separation in the relevant quark bilinear operator, cf. the definition Eq. ( 50) below. Put succinctly, the relation between the conventions in the two literatures is akin to the relation between center-of-mass and relative coordinates. In the present section, the impact parameter will instead be denoted by r T , cf. the discussion at the end of Section 4.3.In this section, we provide more details on the definition of TMD PDFs.

Of particular value will be lattice results of sufficient quality, and in the relevant kinematical regimes, to be useful as auxiliary input to phenomenological fits of TMD PDFs, discussed in the next section.

        <p>TMD PDFs carry rich information on parton confined motion inside a bound hadron, as well as on correlations between the motion of quarks and gluons and the direction of hadron spin. Their information can be extracted from data on QCD factorizable hadronic cross sections or from lattice observables, such as discussed in the preceding section, and their properties can also be studied in terms of model calculations. The limited kinematic coverage for the differential cross sections provided by experimental data leads to a challenging inverse problem; it is unlikely, if not impossible, that one can completely fix the TMD PDFs as continuous functions over the full range of kinematics. To pin down TMD PDFs to the best possible accuracy, we need data from multiple observables, experimentally measured or calculated within lattice QCD, that are related to the same universal set of TMD PDFs, covering a wide kinematic regime, and to perform QCD global analyses and fits, similar to what is done to extract the PDFs as described in Section 2.4.TMD PDFs carry rich information on parton confined motion inside a bound hadron, as well as on correlations between the motion of quarks and gluons and the direction of hadron spin.

        <p>However, there are fundamental differences between global fits to extract PDFs and the global fits for extracting TMD PDFs. With the linear DGLAP evolution equations, PDFs are uniquely determined once we have a set of input PDFs as a function of x at a lowest possible input hard scale Q 0 ∼ 1 GeV, since all DGLAP evolution kernels are perturbatively calculable for scales larger than Q 0 . Then, PDFs at Q &gt; Q 0 can be generated by the DGLAP evolution, embodying the predictive power of QCD dynamics and its factorization formalism.However, there are fundamental differences between global fits to extract PDFs and the global fits for extracting TMD PDFs.

        <p>For TMD PDFs with two momentum scales, Q and k T (or its Fourier conjugate b T ), QCD evolution involves two coupled evolution equations and covers a two-dimensional phase space, e.g., (Q , b T ), where b T ∈ [0, ∞) [372]. As a consequence, the path used in solving these two coupled equations is not unique, which could affect the size of higher order corrections, leading to an additional scheme dependence of the TMD PDFs [410]. However, the fundamental and most important difference from DGLAP evolution is that evolution kernels for evolving TMD PDFs from an input scale Q 0 to any higher observed scale Q , referred as the Collins-Soper kernels (cf. Section 4.2), depend on the value of b T , and are not perturbatively calculable for the region where b T &gt; 1/Q 0 . That is, if the Fourier transform to obtain momentum space k T -dependent TMD PDFs, which are needed for evaluating momentum-space cross sections, is sensitive to the large b Tregion of the evolved b T -distributions, QCD perturbation theory and its factorization formalism cannot uniquely generate TMD PDFs at a large scale Q from input TMD PDFs at Q 0 as a function of x and k T (or b T in Fourier space) [372].For TMD PDFs with two momentum scales, Q and k T (or its Fourier conjugate b T ), QCD evolution involves two coupled evolution equations and covers a two-dimensional phase space, e.g., (Q , b T ), where b T ∈ [0, ∞) [372].

        <p>In high energy collisions, a parton shower develops following the breaking up of the colliding hadron(s), and the characteristics of the shower depend on the hard scale of the collision Q and the available phase space for the shower, which is sensitive to probed parton momentum fraction x [466]. Consequently, the probed active parton's k T in hard collisions, described by the measured TMD PDFs, is not the same as the intrinsic transverse momentum k T 0 of the same parton inside a bound hadron. The difference is encoded in the QCD evolution of TMD PDFs. For physical observables whose momentum transfer Q is large and active parton x is effectively small, such as the transverse momentum q Tdependence of W /Z or Higgs production at collider energies, QCD evolution (or the effect of the shower) is dominated by perturbatively calculable large logarithms, or equivalently, the b T -dependence of the relevant TMD PDFs in Fourier space is completely dominated by the perturbative small-b T region [466,467]. In this case, nonperturbative evolution kernels from the large-b T region are effectively irrelevant, the extracted k T -dependence of TMD PDFs for these observables is perturbatively generated (by the calculable part of the shower), and the only relevant nonperturbative information is given by normal collinear PDFs. Physically, for such observables and the corresponding TMD PDFs, the information on nonperturbative partonic motion (or intrinsic k T 0 -dependence) inside a bound hadron was diluted by the tremendous shower developed during the collision (or the effective ⟨k 2 T 0 ⟩ ≪ ⟨q 2 T ⟩). In this case, QCD perturbation theory and its TMD factorization formalism should have excellent predictive power similar to that of collinear factorization [466,468,469]. QCD global analyses and fits of data on this kind of observable at high energy colliders should provide excellent precision tests of QCD factorization and resummation of large logarithms, and additional opportunities or channels to explore new physics; they should be pursued for LHC physics. On the other hand, for extracting information on the motion of quarks and gluons inside a bound hadron, a fundamental emergent QCD phenomenon, we need to probe TMD PDFs through scattering processes with relatively less dilution from partonic showers, and observables with a relatively smaller momentum transfer Q . In this case, QCD evolution (or the connection between the measured k T -dependence at the hard collision scale Q and the intrinsic k T 0 dependence inside a bound hadron) is very much sensitive to the nonperturbative large b T region [410,466,467].

        <p>Phenomenologically, most efforts to extract TMD PDFs from existing data are concentrated on the unpolarized f 1 (x, k 2 T ) in Eq. (57). In recent years, there has been tremendous progress both in the accuracy of the theoretical framework and in the dimension of the data set included in the fit. Extractions of f 1 (x, k 2 T ) from SIDIS data were performed in the socalled extended parton model [403,404] (the latter being the only analysis so far with an explicit flavor dependence in the fitting parameters of the functional form), and were followed by extractions in the appropriate TMD framework but limited to Drell-Yan and Z -boson production data. In these cases, the description of the TMD evolution formula (56) was continuously improved, moving from the NLL level [406,474,475] through the NNLL one [407,408,476], up to the NNNLL level [409,410] that matches the accuracy of standard phenomenology at the LHC (see Table 1 and Section 2.3 of Ref. [409] for more details on the perturbative expansion). In the most recent analyses [407][408][409][410], very precise data from the LHC (in particular, from ATLAS) were included in the fit and turned out to have a large impact on the behavior of f 1 (x, k 2 T ) at small x. Conversely, the impact of a flavor-dependent TMD (as obtained from the low-energy analysis of Ref. [403]) on the extraction of Standard Model parameters at the LHC was explored in Ref. [477] using the template-fit technique, reaching the conclusion that flavor sensitivity in the intrinsic quark transverse momentum might induce an additional uncertainty in the extraction of the W boson mass that is comparable to the error correlated to PDF uncertainties.Phenomenologically, most efforts to extract TMD PDFs from existing data are concentrated on the unpolarized f 1 (x, k 2 T ) in Eq.

The transverse polarization of the nucleon induces a distortion of the density along the x direction through the Sivers TMD PDF f ⊥ 1T . Evidently, f ⊥ 1T describes a spin-orbit effect at the partonic level. The Sivers function is representative of the class of naïve T-odd TMDs, namely of those TMDs that are not constrained by T-reversal invariance [399]. Their universality is broken but in a calculable way. For example, the Sivers function extracted in a Drell-Yan process with a transversely polarized proton should turn out opposite to the one that is extracted in SIDIS. The f ⊥ 1T | DY = -f ⊥ 1T | SIDIS prediction is based on very general assumptions, and it represents a fundamental test of QCD [390]. Therefore, it is the subject of intense experimental investigation. Preliminary results hint to statistically favor the prediction [405,478,479] although more precise data are needed to draw a sharp conclusion. Many parametrizations of the Sivers function are available (for example, see Refs. [480][481][482][483][484][485][486]). In Ref. [487], the density f q/N ↑ of Eq. ( 69) is reconstructed by combining the extraction of the unpolarized f 1 from Ref. [406] with the extraction of the Sivers f ⊥ 1T from SIDIS data in the same approach. In this way, the quark density is reconstructed in a consistent way from real experimental data for nucleons with or without transverse polarization. In Fig. 34, f q/N ↑ is represented at x = 0.1 and Q 2 = 1 GeV 2 for a proton ideally moving towards the reader. The upper panels correspond to the symmetric situation of an unpolarized proton. The lower panels show the distortion along the x direction induced by the transverse polarization along the ŷ direction, which turns out opposite for the up quark (left panel) and the down quark (right panel).cf.

        <p>In summary, recent developments in the field have enabled the first accurate tomography in momentum space of quarks inside (polarized) nucleons, and we can describe how this picture evolves with the hard scale Q and how it changes with the quark longitudinal momentum fraction x. Concomitantly, lattice QCD calculations have been pursued, with an increasing understanding of systematics as well as the theoretical underpinnings necessary to connect the lattice results to quantities extracted from phenomenology. With more and higher quality data becoming available from Jefferson Lab at 12 GeV, COMPASS at CERN, and the future EIC, and a better understanding of nonperturbative evolution at large b T from lattice QCD calculations, the community should be able to perform much more accurate global fits of TMD PDFs to learn about the ''true'' confined partonic motion in hadrons, isolating it from the contamination from parton showers triggered by high energy collisions. In addition to the specific issue of the Collins-Soper evolution kernel, lattice QCD can provide further auxiliary input for future global fits. TMD observables at separations up to b T ∼ 1 fm at hadron momenta up to about 2 GeV will be accessible at the physical pion mass in the medium term, where it can be expected that moments in the momentum fraction x will continue to be obtained with better precision than the x-dependent quantities, even as determinations of the latter are developed. Used to anchor phenomenological fits, such moments may represent the most accessible avenue for lattice QCD to contribute to global fit efforts.In summary, recent developments in the field have enabled the first accurate tomography in momentum space of quarks inside (polarized) nucleons, and we can describe how this picture evolves with the hard scale Q and how it changes with the quark longitudinal momentum fraction x.

        <p>From the perspective of QCD global analysis, fits of PDFs, GPDs and TMD PDFs are often limited by kinematical regions which have either been weakly probed experimentally or are inaccessible to contemporary measurements, such as (very) high or (very) low x, in the case of PDFs. Similarly, precise extractions of the flavor dependence of the PDFs and related quantities are frequently hindered by the sparsity of data with direct sensitivity. For instance, in studies of unpolarized PDFs, determinations of the nucleon's strangeness content commonly require final-state tagging of charm quarks in dimuon production off nuclei or other semi-inclusive processes for which various ambiguities exist regarding the treatment of nuclear medium effects, hadronization, and other issues. Due to these complexities, lattice-QCD data on PDF moments or quasi-/pseudo-distributions can already have a valuable impact as fitted data or theoretical priors in global PDF fits. In contrast, contemporary data informing the u-and d-quark distributions are sufficiently constraining that lattice calculations on the lowest PDFs moments do not yet possess the needed precision to be quite as informative in a global analysis. All the same, technical improvements in the evaluation of PDF moments, the extension of lattice calculations to higher moments, and supplementation of this information with quasi-and pseudo-PDFs will gain pace in coming years. These developments suggest the possibility of future global PDF fits in which extractions of unpolarized PDFs are augmented by an array of lattice calculations that provide enhanced precision.From the perspective of QCD global analysis, fits of PDFs, GPDs and TMD PDFs are often limited by kinematical regions which have either been weakly probed experimentally or are inaccessible to contemporary measurements, such as (very) high or (very) low x, in the case of PDFs. Similarly, precise extractions of the flavor dependence of the PDFs and related quantities are frequently hindered by the sparsity of data with direct sensitivity. For instance, in studies of unpolarized PDFs, determinations of the nucleon's strangeness content commonly require final-state tagging of charm quarks in dimuon production off nuclei or other semi-inclusive processes for which various ambiguities exist regarding the treatment of nuclear medium effects, hadronization, and other issues. Due to these complexities, lattice-QCD data on PDF moments or quasi-/pseudo-distributions can already have a valuable impact as fitted data or theoretical priors in global PDF fits.

        <p>Strategies and theory developments for this approach can be guided by lattice calculations and QCD analyses for the comparatively less constrained partonic distributions, such as the helicity and transversity collinear distributions, GPDs, and TMD PDFs. The impact of lattice calculations in QCD global fits can be reciprocally enhanced by the phenomenological determinations themselves, which, by their precision, can provide benchmarks for many standard lattice observables. We therefore envision a PDF-Lattice synergy deriving from the ability of QCD global fitters to drive improvements in lattice calculations with benchmarks informed by high-energy data, while the lattice provides informative constraints in kinematical regions that are otherwise challenging to constrain empirically.Strategies and theory developments for this approach can be guided by lattice calculations and QCD analyses for the comparatively less constrained partonic distributions, such as the helicity and transversity collinear distributions, GPDs, and TMD PDFs.

This is a primary goal of this report, which, in addition to numerous updates, aimed to extend the comparative PDF-lattice basis from the arena of collinear distributions developed in the 2017 PDFLattice white paper to multidimensional distributions for which lattice information can more immediately drive global fits.As an essential ingredient for this relationship, both communities must establish a common basis for comparing results from lattice QCD and global fits -a challenging undertaking given the complex contemporary landscape of lattice calculations and global fits, which involve a patchwork of theoretical settings, systematic assumptions, and, in the case of QCD analyses, empirical data sets.

        <p>The TMD PDFs and GPDs discussed in this report are examples of how we can augment our current collinear PDFs to more fully map out the hadronic structure. These generalized distributions provide a special opportunity with new facilities on the horizon such as the HL-LHC, LHeC, and EIC. For example, the EIC is well suited to perform hadron tomography measurements, given its high-luminosity coverage of the low Q 2 quark-hadron transition region in the kinematical parameter space. These hadron tomography measurements can be crucial in unfolding the nucleon's collinear and transverse structure at scales adjacent to the nucleon mass, and for constraining the quantities accessible in next-generation lattice-QCD calculations.The TMD PDFs and GPDs discussed in this report are examples of how we can augment our current collinear PDFs to more fully map out the hadronic structure.

        <p>The paths of the Wilson lines in (50) are illustrated in Fig. 29. They form a closed path between the quark fields in the TMD PDF and a closed loop in the soft function, thereby rendering these functions gauge invariant.The paths of the Wilson lines in (50) are illustrated in Fig. 29.
