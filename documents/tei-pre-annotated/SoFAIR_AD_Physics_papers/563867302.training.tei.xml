        <p>The Lyman continuum (LyC) cannot be observed at the epoch of reionization (z  6) owing to intergalactic H I absorption. To identify LyC emitters (LCEs) and infer the fraction of escaping LyC, astronomers have developed various indirect diagnostics of LyC escape. Using measurements of the LyC from the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS), we present the first statistical test of these diagnostics. While optical depth indicators based on Lyα, such as peak velocity separation and equivalent width, perform well, we also find that other diagnostics, such as the [O III]/[O II] flux ratio and star formation rate surface density, predict whether a galaxy is an LCE. The relationship between these galaxy properties and the fraction of escaping LyC flux suggests that LyC escape depends strongly on H I column density, ionization parameter, and stellar feedback. We find that LCEs occupy a range of stellar masses, metallicities, star formation histories, and ionization parameters, which may indicate episodic and/or different physical causes of LyC escape.The Lyman continuum (LyC) cannot be observed at the epoch of reionization (z  6) owing to intergalactic H I absorption.

        <p>While the reionization of the universe likely completed by a redshift of z ∼ 6 (e.g., Becker et al. 2001;Paoletti et al. 2020;Pahl et al. 2020;Yang et al. 2020), substantial contention persists concerning which galaxies are responsible. Intense, concentrated star formation seems to be a necessary characteristic of reionizing galaxies because of the associated stellar feedback (e.g., Heckman et al. 2001;Clarke &amp; Oey 2002;Heckman et al. 2011;Sharma et al. 2017;Naidu et al. 2020). Many predictions suggest that dwarf galaxies are the primary Lyman continuum (LyC) photon donors because the weak gravitational potentials of low-mass galaxies exacerbate the clearing effects of feedback (e.g., Razoumov &amp; Sommer-Larsen 2010;Wise et al. 2014;Paardekooper et al. 2015;Izotov et al. 2021). Others indicate that more massive galaxies dominate reionization because stronger gravitational potentials better facilitate efficient star formation, resulting in a higher LyC photon budget (e.g., Wyithe &amp; Loeb 2013). An increase in dust extinction with galaxy mass could reduce LyC escape at the highest masses, causing galaxies with masses in between these two regimes to dominate reionization (e.g., Ma et al. 2020).While the reionization of the universe likely completed by a redshift of z ∼ 6 (e.g., Becker et al. 2001;Paoletti et al. 2020;Pahl et al. 2020;Yang et al. 2020), substantial contention persists concerning which galaxies are responsible.

        <p>Central to this debate is the fraction of LyC photons that escape from a galaxy to reionize the intergalactic medium (IGM). This "escape fraction" f esc LyC relates the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) density and LyC production efficiency to the cosmic ionization rate. Based on results from stacked spectra at z ∼ 3 (e.g., Steidel et al. 2018) and from cosmological simulations (e.g., Finkelstein et al. 2012), galaxies that exhibit f esc LyC  0.05 are the most relevant to reionization. Due to the increase in intergalactic LyC absorption with redshift, direct measurement of the LyC, let alone f esc LyC , is statistically unlikely beyond z ∼ 4 (e.g., Vanzella et al. 2012;Worseck et al. 2014) to ascertain which galaxies are responsible for reionizing the universe.Central to this debate is the fraction of LyC photons that escape from a galaxy to reionize the intergalactic medium (IGM).

        <p>Therefore, we must study lower-redshift LyC-leaking galaxies to develop indirect diagnostics for f esc LyC . These diagnostics may also provide insight into the physical mechanism(s) and environmental conditions that contribute to leaking of LyC photons. In the following, we will explore some of the most promising diagnostics for f esc LyC , including the equivalent widths (EWs) of nebular emission lines, emissionline flux ratios, the profile of the Lyα emission line, the SFR surface density (Σ SFR ), and the UV continuum slope (β) and magnitude (M 1500 ).Therefore, we must study lower-redshift LyC-leaking galaxies to develop indirect diagnostics for f esc LyC .

        <p>Of these properties, nebular emission-line EWs are one of the easiest to measure. Because hydrogen Balmer lines originate from recombination across the entire extent of H II regions, measuring a smaller EW in these lines may indicate lower optical depth: if gas does not extend out to the Strömgren radius, not all LyC photons will photoionize H I, and thus the nebula will emit fewer Balmer photons (e.g., Bergvall et al. 2013). To date, few tests of this diagnostic have been conducted. Moreover, many local LyC emitters (LCEs) exhibiting high Balmer emission line EWs have been found (Izotov et al. 2016b(Izotov et al. , 2018a(Izotov et al. , 2018b)). In any case, Balmer-line EWs are sensitive not only to nebula size but also to starburst age and star formation history (Zackrisson et al. 2017;Binggeli et al. 2018;Alavi et al. 2020). Plagued by such degeneracies, the EW diagnostic may be best when paired with another indicator.Of these properties, nebular emission-line EWs are one of the easiest to measure.

        <p>Similarly motivated by optical depth, the emission-line flux ratio O 32 = [O III] λ5007/[O II] λλ3726, 3729 probes the relative sizes of the O +2 and O + ionized zones. When the nebula is optically thin to LyC, the O + zone will be smaller relative to the O +2 zone (Jaskot &amp; Oey 2013;Nakajima &amp; Ouchi 2014). Albeit straightforward, O 32 also depends strongly on ionization parameter to the extent that O 32 is commonly used to measure it (e.g., Kobulnicky &amp; Kewley 2004;Stasińska et al. 2015;Strom et al. 2018). It is unclear whether this dependence will obfuscate f esc LyC diagnostics. For instance, f esc LyC itself may depend on ionization parameter if the incident stellar radiation field is responsible for a density-bounded scenario wherein gas does not persist out to the Strömgren radius. O 32 also does not probe the outer extent of the nebula, the region that is most sensitive to optical depth. Observationally, there is substantial scatter in the f esc LyC -O 32 relation (e.g., Izotov et al. 2018b), making this diagnostic tenuous.Similarly motivated by optical depth, the emission-line flux ratio O 32 = [O III] λ5007/[O II] λλ3726, 3729 probes the relative sizes of the O +2 and O + ionized zones.

        <p>Complementing the O 32 diagnostic, the [O I] λ6300 emission line traces neutral gas at the outer extent of a nebula because O 0 has an ionization potential similar to that of hydrogen (13.62 eV) and is coupled to hydrogen recombination by charge exchange reactions (Osterbrock &amp; Ferland 2006). Comparing the [O I] λ6300 flux to the flux of another emission line can thus indicate the prevalence of neutral gas at the nebula boundary. Stasińska et al. (2015) consider the O 31 = [O III] λ5007/[O I] λ6300 flux ratio as a diagnostic for LyC escape. They argue that, while sensitive to physical conditions and other ionization sources, O 31 could indicate a density-bounded nebula, as it traces the size of the O 0 zone relative to the O +2 zone. Similarly, the [O I]/Hβ ratio could indicate a deficiency in neutral gas relative to hydrogen recombining from H II to H I across the nebula, comparable to the effect described by Wang et al. (2019) for [S II]/Hα. The [O I] line is not without complications, though. In models where LyC optical depth and ionization parameter are not constant across the nebula (the socalled "picket fence" scenario; see Heckman et al. 2001), Ramambason et al. (2020) predict that O 31 and [O I]/Hβ depend on conditions such as starburst age, ionization parameter, and LyC escape conditions. Shocks can also produce [O I] emission, further complicating the [O I] line as a diagnostic. Even so, these [O I] flux ratios have promise as indicators of f esc LyC . Jaskot et al. (2019) found that both flux ratios correlate with the Lyα profile peak velocity separation, itself an indicator of f esc LyC (e.g., Izotov et al. 2018b). The Lyα recombination emission line is sensitive to the neutral H I opacity of a galaxy (e.g., Behrens et al. 2014;Verhamme et al. 2015). First, the shape of the Lyα profile depends on the amount of both absorption and reemission of Lyα photons by H I in the host galaxy (essentially a "scattering" effect; e.g., Verhamme et al. 2017;Gazagnes et al. 2020). Second, the line-of-sight H I column density affects the fraction of Lyα photons that escape (e.g., Henry et al. 2015;Yang et al. 2017a;Izotov et al. 2018b). The discovery of triple-peaked Lyα profiles associated with LCEs (e.g., Rivera-Thorsen et al. 2019;Izotov et al. 2018b;Vanzella et al. 2020) suggests low optical depth cavities in the interstellar medium (ISM) facilitating both Lyα and LyC photon escape (Byrohl &amp; Gronke 2020). While these results are promising, the Lyα line can be sensitive to IGM extinction, metallicity, and stellar populations in the host galaxy (e.g., Henry et al. 2015;Yang et al. 2017a). Moreover, the increasing IGM neutral covering can significantly extinguish Lyα at high redshifts (e.g., Pentericci et al. 2011;Schenker et al. 2014), particularly the blue peak in the emission-line profile (e.g., Laursen et al. 2011;Yang et al. 2017b;Hayes et al. 2021). Focusing on Lyα emitters may additionally introduce a sampling bias since a nonnegligible fraction of high-redshift Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and some LCEs exhibit little to no Lyα (e.g., Vanzella et al. 2009;Ji et al. 2020). Nevertheless, at reionization, Lyα falls in an ideal ground-based observing window (Bagley et al. 2017;Yajima et al. 2018), making Lyα more feasible a diagnostic of f esc LyC than rest-frame optical lines.Complementing the O 32 diagnostic, the [O I] λ6300 emission line traces neutral gas at the outer extent of a nebula because O 0 has an ionization potential similar to that of hydrogen (13.62 eV) and is coupled to hydrogen recombination by charge exchange reactions (Osterbrock &amp; Ferland 2006).

        <p>SFR surface density, on the other hand, may serve simultaneously as a probe of the physical mechanism of LyC leakage and a as proxy for f esc LyC . Feedback from star formation can blow bubbles/chimneys in the host galaxy's ISM (e.g., Heckman et al. 2001;Clarke &amp; Oey 2002;Sharma et al. 2016;Naidu et al. 2020;Gazagnes et al. 2020), suggesting that high Σ SFR will correspond to high f esc LyC . Previously detected LCEs also appear to be compact (e.g., Izotov et al. 2018b;Marchi et al. 2018). Compactness indicates concentrated star formation and may correlate with LyC emission (e.g., Marchi et al. 2018), although it is yet unclear whether this is a defining characteristic of all LCEs. High Σ SFR appears to correlate with weaker low-ionization metal absorption lines (e.g., Alexandroff et al. 2015), which suggests a connection with low optical depth.SFR surface density, on the other hand, may serve simultaneously as a probe of the physical mechanism of LyC leakage and a as proxy for f esc LyC .

        <p>All the diagnostics outlined above are plausible but remain, as of yet, insufficiently explored owing to small sample sizes. Future observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and other observatories require reliable indirect diagnostics to infer f esc LyC at reionization. The recent Lowredshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS; Flury et al. 2022, hereafter Paper I) presents an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the properties of nearby (z ∼ 0.3) LCEs to test each diagnostic. In this paper, we summarize the survey in Section 2 but refer the reader to Paper I for details. We provide assessments of the success of indirect diagnostics for selecting LCEs and inferring f esc LyC (Section 3). In Section 4, we compare different parameters and consider the implications both for diagnostics and for populations of LCEs. Finally, we discuss our results in the contexts of different LyC escape scenarios, cosmological simulations, and high-redshift surveys in Section 5. As in Paper I, we assume H 0 = 70 km s -1 Mpc -1 , Ω m = 0.3, and Ω Λ = 0.7.All the diagnostics outlined above are plausible but remain, as of yet, insufficiently explored owing to small sample sizes.

        <p>From the COS spectra, we measure the LyC and Lyα flux, the Lyα EW, and the spectral slope of the attenuated starlight continuum. To assess the detection of the LyC, we define the probability P( &gt; N|B) given by the Poisson survival function that the observed signal arises by chance from background fluctuations (see Worseck et al. 2016;Makan et al. 2021). In summary, we detect LyC emission from 35 galaxies at &gt;97.725% confidence (P( &gt; N|B) &lt; 0.02275, &gt; 2σ significance), with 13/35 of these galaxies having fairly detected LyC flux (P( &gt; N|B) &lt; 0.00135, 3σ-5σ significance) and 12/ 35 of these galaxies having well-detected LyC flux (P( &gt; N|B) &lt; 2.867 × 10 -7 , &gt;5σ significance). Following Chisholm et al. (2019), we also perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using instantaneous burst model spectra from 
            <rs type="software">STARBURST</rs>
            <rs type="version">99</rs> (Leitherer et al. 2010) to infer the intrinsic and observed UV magnitudes at 1500 Å, starlight attenuation, starburst age, and intrinsic LyC flux (see Saldana-Lopez et al. 2022, for details). From the COS acquisition images, we determine the UV half-light radius from the background-subtracted empirical cumulative light distribution, which is consistent with results from Sérsic profile fits.

        <p>Optical spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) provide additional information. We measure nebular emissionline fluxes and EWs from these spectra. To correct the fluxes for reddening, we infer nebular extinction from Balmer lines assuming Case B recombination with Storey &amp; Hummer (1995) atomic data and the Cardelli et al. (1989) reddening law. From the extinction-corrected fluxes, we obtain diagnostic flux ratios like O 32 . Since [O III] λ4363 is detected in the majority of the galaxies in our sample, we determine gas-phase metallicities by the direct method, inferring the auroral line flux by the flux-flux relation (Pilyugin et al. 2006) when not available.Optical spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) provide additional information.

From the Balmer-line SFR (Kennicutt &amp; Evans 2012), UV half-light radius, and stellar mass, we calculate the SFR surface density and specific SFR (sSFR). We subsequently correct the Balmer-line SFR quantities for the escape of ionizing photons.

        <p>As discussed in Section 1, the key objective of establishing LyC escape diagnostics is to determine which properties most strongly correlate with the LyC escape fraction f esc LyC . We measure f esc LyC by three different methods: (i) the empirical F λLyC /F λ1100 ratio, (ii) using Hβ to infer the intrinsic LyC from STARBURST99 continuous starburst model spectra ( f esc LyC (Hβ)), and (iii) using SED fits to the COS far-UV (FUV) spectra to infer the intrinsic LyC ( f esc LyC (UV)). We summarize these metrics below.As discussed in Section 1, the key objective of establishing LyC escape diagnostics is to determine which properties most strongly correlate with the LyC escape fraction f esc LyC .

        <p>1. The F λLyC /F λ1100 ratio is simply a ratio of flux density measurements and is therefore free of any assumptions. However, F λLyC /F λ1100 is sensitive to a number of factors in addition to the LyC escape fraction, including dust attenuation, SFR, metallicity, and burst age, complicating the interpretation of this quantity as a metric of f esc LyC . 2. The Hβ approach introduced by Izotov et al. (2016b) uses the Hβ flux, a measure of the total number of absorbed ionizing photons, the Hβ EW, a proxy for burst age, and the gas-phase metallicity to determine which STAR- BURST99 model to use to predict the intrinsic LyC flux density corresponding to the measured LyC. The observed LyC flux density relative to the intrinsic LyC flux density then gives the f esc LyC . This method can be sensitive to the assumed star formation history, particularly for older burst ages or for galaxies with high stellar mass. In Paper I, we find that a continuous star formation scenario provides the best agreement with the other two f esc LyC metrics. 3. The UV approach relies on fitting the COS UV spectra over the rest-frame wavelength range of 925-1345 Å.1.

        <p>These SED fits consist of a uniform Reddy et al. (2016) attenuation law applied to a weighted linear combination of single-burst STARBURST99 spectra and accompanying nebular continua (see Chisholm et al. 2019;Saldana-Lopez et al. 2022). The best-fit SED allows us to predict the intrinsic LyC flux density, which we then use to obtain the f esc LyC . While the UV fits are still affected by assumptions about the star formation history and dust attenuation, the COS UV f esc LyC is less sensitive to systematics than the Hβ f esc LyC , making this metric the most reliable of the three.These SED fits consist of a uniform Reddy et al.

        <p>The LzLCS aims to test various f esc LyC diagnostics proposed in the literature as discussed in Section 1. To that end, we compare our measured f esc LyC against each parameter in Figures 1234567891011121314151617.

        <p>Below we examine diagnostics motivated by LyC optical depth and by properties related to stellar feedback mechanisms facilitating LyC escape. Many proxies exhibit an intrinsic, often significant correlation with f esc LyC , but with substantial scatter in the data. This scatter often extends from a parameterdependent upper bound on f esc LyC down to f esc LyC = 0. These upper bounds in f esc LyC suggest that line-of-sight effects (e.g., orientation, covering fraction) may be responsible for obscuring otherwise clear trends, although relationships between various properties may also contribute to the scatter.Below we examine diagnostics motivated by LyC optical depth and by properties related to stellar feedback mechanisms facilitating LyC escape.

        <p>To illustrate the combination of obscuring scatter and upperbound effects, we refer to Figure 1 We define the LCE fraction as the ratio of strong LCEs (P( &gt; N|B) &lt; 2.867 × 10 -7 for 5σ significance as in Section 2, and the f esc LyC indicator exceeds 5%) to total galaxies in the combined sample in a given bin of a particular property. Bin counts are given as the sum of the probabilities for the strong LCE and total LCE samples, i.e., the Poisson binomial expected value for each bin. We define the final LCE detection fraction as the ratio of the strong LCE counts to that of the total counts in a given bin. We determine uncertainty in the LCE detection fraction using a Monte Carlo simulation of the ratio of Poisson binomial distributions using 10 4 independent Bernoulli trials for each measurement to determine the distribution of counts in each bin. In cases of upper limits where no uncertainty is reported for a measurement (notably the [O I] line), we follow the root-finding minimization method from Gehrels (1986) to define confidence intervals on the detection fraction. The F λLyC /F λ1100 flux ratio tends to agree more with f esc LyC (Hβ) than with f esc LyC (UV); however, f esc LyC (UV) is less dependent on assumptions about stellar populations and star formation history than f esc LyC (Hβ) and contains corrections for dust that are absent in F λLyC /F λ1100 . Despite some disagreements in values of LCE fraction, f esc LyC , and F λLyC /F λ1100 , the trend in LCE fraction does not change significantly depending on the f esc LyC indicator.To illustrate the combination of obscuring scatter and upperbound effects, we refer to Figure 1 We define the LCE fraction as the ratio of strong LCEs (P( &gt; N|B) &lt; 2.867 × 10 -7 for 5σ significance as in Section 2, and the f esc LyC indicator exceeds 5%) to total galaxies in the combined sample in a given bin of a particular property.

        <p>As both Lyα and the LyC are sensitive to the line of sight, we anticipate the former to trace the LCE fraction rather well, even as the emission line experiences higher optical depths than the continuum for the same column density. We demonstrate that this relation is the case in Figure 2. The LCE fraction increases nearly monotonically with both f esc Lya and the Lyα EW. Deviations from this trend occur at high f esc Lya owing to two galaxies having abnormally high Lyα/Hβ ratios corresponding to values of f esc Lya close to 1. The overwhelming success of all three Lyα diagnostics in correlating with f esc LyC demonstrates that both Lyα and LyC escape depend on the distribution of neutral hydrogen in a galaxy. While all three are promising candidates for f esc LyC indicators at high redshift, Lyα EW is perhaps the easiest to measure, as it requires neither rest-frame optical nor highresolution spectroscopy. The wealth of Lyα EW measurements of LCEs at higher redshifts (z ∼ 3-4; e.g., Steidel et al. 2018;Marchi et al. 2018;Fletcher et al. 2019;Pahl et al. 2021) suggests that these diagnostics will likely remain applicable for galaxies at the epoch of reionization.

        <p>In Paper I, we derived f esc Lya from Lyα and Hβ emission-line fluxes using Case B recombination coefficients determined by the measured electron temperatures and densities. The f esc LyC exhibits a strong correlation with the fraction of escaping Lyα photons. Consistent with previous studies (e.g., Dijkstra et al. 2016;Verhamme et al. 2017;Izotov et al. 2020), we typically find that f esc Lya  f esc LyC and that the envelope of f esc LyC increases with increasing f esc Lya (Figure 1). This result illustrates that Lyα has an advantage over the LyC in escaping a galaxy because it can resonantly scatter. However, Lyα and LyC escape have a clear physical connection: our results in Figure 1 suggest that only Lyα emitters (LAEs) can be strong LCEs.

        <p>There remains a great deal of scatter in f esc LyC values for any given f esc Lya , which is to be expected. Observed Lyα flux depends on scattering effects from dust and gas along and outside the line of sight, making f esc Lya sensitive to dust and gas content, ISM clumpiness, and gas dynamics (e.g., Dijkstra et al. 2016). While ISM content and geometry also affect f esc LyC , the scatter evident in Figure 1 suggests that the dependence of f esc LyC on these properties may differ from that of f esc Lya .There remains a great deal of scatter in f esc LyC values for any given f esc Lya , which is to be expected.

        <p>The correlation between f esc LyC and Lyα EW is one of the stronger and more significant of the diagnostics we consider, with τ ≈ 0.3 across all three f esc LyC indicators. Ten of the 16 galaxies with high Lyα EW are strong leakers, indicating a possible transition in Lyα EW at 100 Å. Galaxies with EWs above this value are far more likely to be strong LCEs than those below it (see also Figure 2). Further supporting this notion of a 100 Å transition, LCEs with EWs below this value are not as prodigious emitters as above it, which may suggest that LCEs with high EW contribute more significantly to the cosmic LyC budget.The correlation between f esc LyC and Lyα EW is one of the stronger and more significant of the diagnostics we consider, with τ ≈ 0.3 across all three f esc LyC indicators.

        <p>Lyα is sensitive to both column density and f esc LyC , which affects the distribution of f esc LyC over the EWs. As the optical depth decreases, more Lyα and LyC photons can escape. The drop in column density will then begin to limit the intrinsic emission of Lyα photons, causing Lyα EW to decrease with increasing f esc LyC (Nakajima &amp; Ouchi 2014;Steidel et al. 2018). This effect may explain why some strong LCEs persist at Lyα EWs at or even below 100 Å. However, Lyα EW also depends very strongly on the continuum flux and, by extension, the stellar population(s), making unclear how significantly f esc LyC affects the Lyα EW.

        <p>Lyα profiles are typically double peaked, with the velocity separation of the two peaks directly depending on the H I column density (e.g., Verhamme et al. 2015). Previously, Izotov et al.

        <p>As shown in Figure 7, we see increasing average and maximum f esc LyC with increasing O 32 . The total combined sample exhibits a significant (|τ| &gt; 0.2 at &gt;3σ confidence) correlation with O 32 in all three f esc LyC metrics (see Table 1). The redshift persists at z ∼ 2-4 (Sanders et al. 2020). Therefore, the underlying properties that affect O 32 remain related in the same way regardless of epoch, supporting the extension of the O 32 diagnostic to higher redshifts. Regardless of the physical connection between O 32 and f esc LyC , the scatter in this diagnostic indicates that an isotropic density-bounded escape scenario alone is likely incompatible with the observations.

        <p>With these nuances to O 32 in mind, we do find that f esc LyC correlates strongly with O 32 , particularly for f esc LyC derived from the UV spectrum. Further evidence for this relationship is the LCE fraction shown in Figure 8. The highest-O 32 galaxies in the combined sample (O 32  10) have LCE fractions 0.5. However, LCE fractions &gt;0.1 persist across the full range of O 32 values regardless of f esc LyC indicator. As we demonstrate in Figure 7, while most galaxies with O 32 &gt; 5 in the combined sample are strong LCEs along the line of sight, some galaxies with lower O 32 can still be strong LCEs. Two scenarios might contribute to this trend with O 32 : separate populations of LCEs with LyC escaping under different conditions, or an evolutionary sequence in which LyC escape recurs at later times when fewer early-type stars persist.With these nuances to O 32 in mind, we do find that f esc LyC correlates strongly with O 32 , particularly for f esc LyC derived from the UV spectrum. Further evidence for this relationship is the LCE fraction shown in Figure 8. The highest-O 32 galaxies in the combined sample (O 32  10) have LCE fractions 0.5. However, LCE fractions &gt;0.1 persist across the full range of O 32 values regardless of f esc LyC indicator.

        <p>As evident in Figure 9, the average and maximum values of f esc LyC increase with Hβ EW. f esc LyC (UV) has a significant and strong correlation with Hβ EW, indicating at least a moderate relationship between the two. The distribution of f esc LyC appears to occupy two distinct ranges in EW (see also Figure 10), one with high (150 Å) EW containing the most prodigious strong LCEs ( f esc LyC  0.1), and one with low (150 Å) EW containing additional strong LCEs and the majority of weaker LCEs. Twothirds of the galaxies in our combined sample with Hβ EW &gt;150 Å have detected LyC. Similarly, 28 of the 39 nondetections appear concentrated at EWs below 150 Å.As evident in Figure 9, the average and maximum values of f esc LyC increase with Hβ EW. f esc LyC (UV) has a significant and strong correlation with Hβ EW, indicating at least a moderate relationship between the two.

        <p>Quantifying these results, the fraction of galaxies that are strong LCEs appears to increase with EW, which we demonstrate in Figure 10. This may indicate a preference for young, strong bursts of star formation. As noted above, though, strong LCEs have a wide range in EWs. Thus, the increase in strong LCE fraction with EW demonstrates a dearth of weak LCEs and nonemitters rather than an increase in the prevalence in LCEs at high EW. In other words, high Hβ EW indicates a strong LCE, but high-EW galaxies do not account for the full population of LCEs. Some scatter persists in LCE fraction, particularly at lower EW, depending on the f esc LyC indicator. Uncertainties in the LCE fraction are large enough to suggest that any change in LCE fraction between the various indicators may not be significant. However, our results suggest a significant occurrence of LCEs for EWs below 150 Å, consistent with the f esc LyC trends in Figure 9. The prevalence of LCEs at high EW demonstrates that Hβ EW is more sensitive to star formation history or sSFR than it is to optical depth. Studies at higher redshifts find similar results in combined Hβ+[O III] EWs (e.g., Castellano et al. 2017;Endsley et al. 2021;Saxena et al. 2022), suggesting that this trend persists in earlier cosmological epochs. As stellar mass and starburst age dominate the Hβ EW, LCEs with high EWs are likely young starbursts and/or low-mass galaxies. The lack of weak LCEs and nonemitters at high EWs may indicate that young ages and/or low masses better facilitate high LyC escape fractions. However, a subset of between 6 and 10 strong LCEs have EWs below 150 Å, indicating that strong LCEs occupy a wide range of ages, star formation histories, and/or sSFRs. These low-EW LCEs are likely more evolved galaxies with higher stellar mass and metallicity.

The persistence of LCEs at higher UV luminosities could imply that LCEs consist of multiple epochs of recent star formation and/or higher stellar masses.

A major caveat to this interpretation is the effect of dust on the observed UV magnitude. With the LzLCS, we find that f esc LyC depends on both dust (Saldana-Lopez et al. 2022) and age (Section 3.4), but less so on mass (Section 3.7).

        <p>Figure 13 demonstrates that the highest f esc LyC values occur for the steepest values of β 1200 .

        <p>These trends in β 1200 make sense because early-type stars produce the majority of the LyC and low dust extinction better facilitates LyC escape.

Although less pronounced, this envelope in f esc LyC is similar to the f esc LyC ∝ Σ SFR 0.4 relation described by Naidu et al. (2020).

        <p>High Σ SFR , like those seen for GP galaxies, need not imply unusually strong SN feedback (e.g., Chisholm et al. 2017;Jaskot et al. 2017).

Indeed, τ is higher and more significant for r 50 than for Σ SFR , sSFR, or Σ sSFR . Such concentrated star-forming regions could deplete the surrounding gas so that LyC photons can leave the local H II region and escape into the more diffuse host galaxy and potentially escape into the IGM.High Σ SFR , like those seen for GP galaxies, need not imply unusually strong SN feedback (e.g., Chisholm et al. 2017;Jaskot et al. 2017).

        <p>Starburst age and ionization parameter are related since the earliest O stars die off within the first 2-4 million years. Because these stars dominate the LyC flux, properties sensitive to ionization parameter like O 32 will consequently depend, at least in part, on the age of the starburst (e.g., Jaskot &amp; Oey 2013;Izotov et al. 2017), in addition to other properties.

        <p>The trend in Figure 22 could result from a variety of processes. Decreasing Hβ flux due to fewer ionizing photons would decrease the EW in tandem with O 32 as the O +2 zone declines relative to O + . Due to the mass-metallicity correlation for galaxies (e.g., Tremonti et al. 2004), increased continuum flux due to higher galaxy mass would decrease the EW while increasing the metallicity, the latter serving to decrease O 32 . We find that O 32 and EW decrease with increasing mass, but because mass correlates with 12 log O H of preference of f esc LyC for any part of the distribution demonstrates that age and ionization parameter mitigate any effects of escaping LyC photons on the measured properties.The trend in Figure 22 could result from a variety of processes.

        <p>Gas-phase and stellar metallicities also affect O 32 . As collisionally excited lines, [O III] and [O II] depend on electron temperature, which is higher in low-metallicity gas owing to decreased cooling by metal emission lines. Higher stellar metallicity changes the opacity of stellar interiors and thus affects their photosphere temperatures. Secondarily, high stellar metallicity increases line blanketing in the LyC of O and B stars. These metallicity effects on stellar atmospheres serve to decrease the ionizing photon budget. 23. Harder ionizing spectra at lower metallicity could facilitate a density-bounded escape scenario. Weaker feedback from low-metallicity stars may also generate a dense, clumpy gas geometry that enables LyC escape (Jaskot et al. 2019), perhaps owing to low covering fractions (e.g., Gazagnes et al. 2020;Saldana-Lopez et al. 2022). Mechanical feedback from stars is stronger at higher metallicity, which might explain the subpopulation of high LCEs at higher metallicity. However, higher metallicity is also linked to higher UV attenuation (e.g., Wang et al. 2019), thereby limiting LyC escape. The reduced f esc LyC of LCEs at higher metallicity may also be due to the fact that, at higher galaxy masses, increased gravity may reduce the effectiveness of feedback and thus limit LyC escape.Gas-phase and stellar metallicities also affect O 32 . As collisionally excited lines, [O III] and [O II] depend on electron temperature, which is higher in low-metallicity gas owing to decreased cooling by metal emission lines.

        <p>Following the known mass-metallicity relation, O 32 ought to anticorrelate with M å just as it does with 12 log O H 10 + ( ). Indeed, in Figure 23 we see such a trend until M å  10 9 M e (corresponding to O 32 ≈ 2-3), at which point the two properties appear to decouple. With weaker gravitational potentials, low-M å galaxies also undergo more bursty star formation (e.g., Weisz et al. 2012;Guo et al. 2016). Such episodic star formation results in a range of stellar feedback and ionization parameters, which would lead to a wide range in O 32 .Following the known mass-metallicity relation, O 32 ought to anticorrelate with M å just as it does with 12 log O H 10 + ( ).

        <p>Photoionization models predict that O 31 should increase by 0.5 dex or more as the LyC optical depth decreases from ionization to density boundary conditions at a fixed O 32 (e.g., Stasińska et al. 2015;Plat et al. 2019;Ramambason et al. 2020). We compare our results to the predicted sequences for radiation-and density-bounded nebula models from Stasińska et al. (2015) in Figure 24. The combined samples reside on or above the radiation-bounded sequence. We find no relationship between f esc LyC and any offset from the locus. Because the strongest LCEs have only upper limits in [O I], these galaxies may in fact be consistent with density-bounded or picket fence scenarios. LCEs with detected [O I] reside along the radiationbounded model predictions, which may suggest that an isotropic density-bounded escape scenario is not realized. Indeed, Ramambason et al.

        <p>The substantial scatter evident in all considered diagnostics could be attributed to one or both of two physical explanations. First, orientation could cause the observed scatter since f esc LyC likely depends on line of sight in an anisotropic, radiationbounded escape scenario (e.g., Zastrow et al. 2013;Cen &amp; Kimm 2015). Alternatively, the observed scatter might be due to a time delay between the onset of star formation and the escape of the LyC since feedback requires sufficient time to clear out escape channels, thus decoupling properties from f esc LyC to some extent (e.g., Trebitsch et al. 2017; Barrow et al. 2020; Naidu et al. 2022). Whatever might cause this scatter, it is likely physical because an upper envelope in f esc LyC persists across several diagnostics. These envelopes suggest that genuine trends do exist between f esc LyC and different parameters, but orientation, time delays, and/or starburst properties like age and ionization parameter might influence the values of f esc LyC , causing the observed scatter.The substantial scatter evident in all considered diagnostics could be attributed to one or both of two physical explanations.

        <p>As implied by the envelopes and correlations in the f esc LyC diagnostics, the strongest correlations are Lyα EW, f esc Lya , and v sep for the diagnostics motivated primarily by optical depth.

Different LyC escape scenarios (e.g., Kakiichi &amp; Gronke 2021; Gazagnes et al. 2020) could populate different parts of these diagnostics because the corresponding conditions (e.g., optical depth, porosity of the ISM, or feedback mechanism driving LyC escape) correspond to different ranges of the observable parameter space of O 32 and Hβ EW.As implied by the envelopes and correlations in the f esc LyC diagnostics, the strongest correlations are Lyα EW, f esc Lya , and v sep for the diagnostics motivated primarily by optical depth.

        <p>Investigation of two-dimensional diagnostics sheds light on these possible explanations. At higher mass and higher metallicity, the lower O 32 , lower Hβ EW LCEs likely clear out their birth cloud by mechanical feedback from early-type stars. This serves to more uniformly distribute the dense gas and dust leftover from star formation into an optically thick bubble around the O and B stars. SN feedback and turbulent feedback subsequently clear optically thin channels in this bubble.Investigation of two-dimensional diagnostics sheds light on these possible explanations.

        <p>The younger, lower-mass, lower-metallicity nature of the high O 32 , high Hβ EW LCEs indicates that this second class of LyC leakers are like the GP galaxies. Such galaxies, while strongly star-forming, likely lack the high-velocity outflows necessary to expel the remnant birth cloud material and form a uniform obscuring medium (Jaskot et al. 2019). However, they may have sufficient radiative feedback to evacuate cavities in the ISM (Kakiichi &amp; Gronke 2021). As a result, these GP LCEs might contain an ISM that is optically thin except where dense clouds cause optically thick patches of relatively small covering fractions. We speculate that the range of parameter spaces occupied by LCEs indicates a shift in conditions and escape mechanism from young GP starbursts with large optically thin cavities to older, optically thick star-forming galaxies with a porous ISM.The younger, lower-mass, lower-metallicity nature of the high O 32 , high Hβ EW LCEs indicates that this second class of LyC leakers are like the GP galaxies.

        <p>While these putative differences in LCEs spurred our comparison of f esc LyC proxies, the two-dimensional diagnostics also demonstrate how different parameters depend on one another. These comparisons show that metallicity, mass, Σ SFR , age, and ionization parameter are inextricably linked. Furthermore, we find that age and ionization parameter dominate any optical depth effects on properties like O 32 and Hβ EW. In other words, young ages and strong radiation boost O 32 and Hβ EW in the strongest LCEs and may be critical for high levels of LyC escape. It is also plausible that a feedback-induced time delay introduces LCE "stragglers" into the distributions of f esc LyC (e.g., Trebitsch et al. 2017;Secunda et al. 2020).While these putative differences in LCEs spurred our comparison of f esc LyC proxies, the two-dimensional diagnostics also demonstrate how different parameters depend on one another.

We find that the combined sample of LCEs is largely consistent with their predictions, including the range in f esc LyC . However, our average f esc LyC toward higher stellar mass bins is about 0.1 dex lower than theirs even if considering only the strongest LCEs. Moreover, although we find qualitative agreement between the envelope in f esc LyC with respect to Σ SFR and the f esc LyC SFR 0.42 µS relation prescribed by Naidu et al.

        <p>O 32 is a more empirical measurement than M å or Σ SFR and directly traces the ionization parameter. Together, these attributes have favored O 32 as an f esc LyC diagnostic in the past. Unfortunately, properties like Σ SFR and metallicity can also contribute to O 32 , thus making interpretation of O 32 unclear (see Nakajima &amp; Ouchi 2014).

        <p>In contrast to these theoretical predictions, LCEs at moderate redshift (z ∼ 3; Nakajima et al. 2020) still reside in this tail, despite having f esc values in excess of 10%. Thus, even in earlier epochs, properties like age, ionization parameter, and metallicity may continue to outweigh the effects of LyC escape in setting O 32 . Star-forming galaxies from the MOSDEF survey at z ∼ 2-3 have O 32 values more consistent with non-LCEs and typical SDSS star-forming galaxies.

The z ∼ 2-3 LBG-like star-forming galaxies from Reddy et al. found that individual LCE detections at higher redshifts are consistent with LzLCS results for F λLyC /F λ1500 (see their Figure 16). LyC measurements using stacked spectra from Steidel et al. (2018) suggest that a possible envelope in F λLyC /F λ1500 persists out to M 1500 ∼ -22. Despite scatter, the increase in max F λLyC /F λ1500 with magnitude suggests that M 1500 may still be a useful tool to estimate galaxy contributions to reionization. However, additional observations of UV-faint LCEs at z ∼ 3 are necessary to confirm that the dependence of maximal F λLyC /F λ1100 on M 1500 at z ∼ 3 is similar to that observed in the combined LzLCS at z ∼ 0.3.Star-forming galaxies observed at higher redshifts allow a more direct comparison with the LCEs from our sample.

        <p>Several indirect diagnostics driven by physical mechanism also show promise at high redshift. Star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 6-8 have UV slopes and SFRs comparable to those of LCEs in this study (e.g., Bhatawdekar &amp; Conselice 2021), which may suggest that the β 1200 and Σ SFR diagnostics at z ∼ 0.3 can be used to identify LCEs and even infer f esc LyC at the epoch of reionization. Shibuya et al. (2015Shibuya et al. ( , 2019) ) find that starforming galaxies become increasingly compact, approaching UV half-light radii of 0.5-0.7 kpc at z ∼ 6. Such compactness is typical for the z ∼ 0.3 LCEs in this study and LAEs in other studies (e.g., Kim et al. 2021). Moreover, this UV concentration corresponds to an average increase in Σ SFR up to values 10 M e yr -1 kpc -2 at z ∼ 6 (Shibuya et al. 2015), which is comparable to the Σ SFR of z ∼ 0.3 LCEs. Such concentrated star formation at the epoch of reionization may be indicative of LyC escape. Star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 5-6 could have higher-velocity outflows than galaxies of the same SFRs and stellar masses at z ∼ 0 (Sugahara et al. 2019). Such extreme outflows might indicate augmented stellar feedback, in turn improving LyC escape indicators like Σ SFR , M å , and UV β at z ∼ 6 relative to z ∼ 0.3.Several indirect diagnostics driven by physical mechanism also show promise at high redshift.

        <p>We did find a significant trend between f esc LyC and sSFR in Section 3.8, which may indicate that strong feedback better facilitates LyC escape in weaker gravitational potentials. At z ∼ 2.3 (Sanders et al. 2016), z ∼ 3 (Reddy et al. 2022), and z = 7 (Endsley et al. 2021), galaxies tend to have sSFR in the 1-10 Gyr -1 range, which corresponds to weaker LCEs and nonemitters at z ∼ 0.3. Taking the Section 3.8 results at face value, these higher-redshift galaxies might not be prodigious LCEs. However, the analysis by Saxena et al. (2022) of individual LCEs at z ∼ 3 suggests that galaxies with lower sSFR values of 1-10 Gyr -1 have f esc LyC in excess of 10% at higher redshift. No z ∼ 0.3 LCEs with f esc LyC &gt; 10% have sSFR &lt;10 Gyr -1 . This striking difference at z ∼ 3 may point to an increase in burst-enabled LyC escape with redshift.We did find a significant trend between f esc LyC and sSFR in Section 3.8, which may indicate that strong feedback better facilitates LyC escape in weaker gravitational potentials.

        <p>Other properties may readily persist at higher redshifts (e.g., Hβ EW, [O III] λ5007 EW, O 32 , R 23 ; see Nakajima et al. 2020;Boyett et al. 2021;Endsley et al. 2021;Reddy et al. 2022;Saxena et al. 2022) but are difficult to observe at z  6 without space-based facilities like JWST. However, as we enter the JWST era, indirect indicators of f esc LyC will prove immensely useful via the trends presented in Section 3. Indeed, unlike observing the LyC, the reionization of the IGM is relatively insensitive to the anisotropic escape of LyC photons. The broad range of LCE properties may still complicate interpreting some diagnostics, as might the interdependent nature of parameters, since it is not clear how either will differ at z ∼ 6.Other properties may readily persist at higher redshifts (e.g., Hβ EW, [O III] λ5007 EW, O 32 , R 23 ; see Nakajima et al. 2020;Boyett et al. 2021;Endsley et al. 2021;Reddy et al. 2022;Saxena et al. 2022) but are difficult to observe at z  6 without space-based facilities like JWST.

        <p>LCEs at the epoch of reionization could be intrinsically unlike those in the LzLCS. Dust and the corresponding attenuation laws might alter the optical depth of the ISM at the epoch of reionization. Low metallicities in the early universe could suppress fragmentation during star formation, resulting in a top-heavy IMF with higher concentrations of O and B stars than at low redshift for the same Σ SFR . Thus, a more physically complete understanding of the ISM and star formation at high redshift is paramount to successfully interpreting the signatures of LyC escape. Nevertheless, we find that young ages, concentrated star formation, and high ionization parameter are important for LyC escape.LCEs at the epoch of reionization could be intrinsically unlike those in the LzLCS.

        <p>Using the results for the 66 galaxies at z ∼ 0.3 in the LzLCS, we have conducted the first thorough statistical test of indirect diagnostics of f esc LyC and LyC escape. We find that f esc Lya , EW Lyα, v sep , O 32 , EW Hβ, β 1200 , M 1500,int , NUV r 50 , Σ SFR , and Σ sSFR provide the best correlations with f esc LyC . However, many of these diagnostics exhibit an upper limit in the values of f esc LyC that varies with the property in question. We interpret these results as underlying trends that are obscured by a combination of line-of-sight effects and variations in other physical properties. Indirect diagnostics arising from stellar feedback mechanisms (e.g., stellar winds, SNe) tend to suffer from this effect more so than those based on optical depth. Such mechanism-based trends are still useful to infer f esc LyC while also providing insight into the nature of LyC escape. We note that the apparent success of each diagnostic may depend on the f esc LyC metric used, with templates fit to the COS spectra giving the strongest, most significant correlations of properties with f esc LyC . Since many of the trends show significant scatter for any given diagnostic parameter, we also perform a quantitative assessment of the fraction of galaxies that are LCEs.Using the results for the 66 galaxies at z ∼ 0.3 in the LzLCS, we have conducted the first thorough statistical test of indirect diagnostics of f esc LyC and LyC escape.

        <p>To better understand how certain properties can affect one another and the inferred f esc LyC , we juxtapose f esc LyC diagnostics. Zackrisson et al. (2013) proposed a comparison of β 1200 with EW(Hβ). We find that, while not following the predictions from Zackrisson et al. (2013), LCEs with higher f esc LyC tend to have higher EW(Hβ) (&gt;100 Å) and steeper UV continua (&lt; -2). Moreover, LCEs distinguish themselves as having either higher EW(Hβ) and steeper UV continua or lower EW(Hβ) (&lt;100 Å) and more shallow UV continua (&gt;-2).To better understand how certain properties can affect one another and the inferred f esc LyC , we juxtapose f esc LyC diagnostics.

        <p>We also compare O 32 and EW(Hβ), finding that the two are strongly correlated. Through comparisons with mass and metallicity, we find that higher O 32 (&gt;5), higher f esc LyC LCEs have low masses and low metallicities, while the lower O 32 (&lt;5), lower f esc LyC LCEs have higher masses and higher metallicities. These results point to a distinct difference in LyC escape mechanism, as discussed above. The oxygen ionization structure indicated by O 32 and O 31 (e.g., Stasińska et al. 2015) demonstrates that LCEs cannot be readily described by a simple density-bounded, isotropic escape scenario. Even so, all LCEs display concentrated star formation, indicating that locally intense star formation is necessary for LyC escape regardless of mechanism.We also compare O 32 and EW(Hβ), finding that the two are strongly correlated.

        <p>For further insight into LCEs, we compare our results with cosmological and galaxy evolution simulation predictions. Consistent with some simulations (e.g., Trebitsch et al. 2017;Secunda et al. 2020), we demonstrate that compact, UV-faint, low-mass galaxies are far more likely to be significant LyC leakers than other galaxies. While we do find that concentrated star formation is a significant indicator of LyC escape, simulations that predict this relationship suggest that LCEs ought to have higher stellar masses than we find in our sample (e.g., Sharma et al. 2017;Nakajima et al. 2020).For further insight into LCEs, we compare our results with cosmological and galaxy evolution simulation predictions.
