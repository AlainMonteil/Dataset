        <p>In view of the recent start of the NA62 experiment at CERN that is expected to measure the K + → π + ν ν branching ratio with a precision of 10%, we summarise the present status of this promising decay within the Standard Model (SM). We do likewise for the closely related K L → π 0 ν ν, which will be measured by the KOTO experiment around 2020. As the perturbative QCD and electroweak corrections in both decays are under full control, the dominant uncertainties within the SM presently originate from the CKM parameters |V cb |, |V ub | and γ. We show this dependence with the help of analytic expressions as well as accurate interpolating formulae. Unfortunately a clarification of the discrepancies between inclusive and exclusive determinations of |V cb | and |V ub | from tree-level decays will likely require results from the Belle II experiment available at the end of this decade. Thus we investigate whether higher precision on both branching ratios is achievable by determining |V cb |, |V ub | and γ by means of other observables that are already precisely measured. In this context ε K and ∆M s,d , together with the expected progress in QCD lattice calculations will play a prominent role. We find B(K + → π + ν ν) = (9.11 ± 0.72) × 10 -11 and B(K L → π 0 ν ν) = (3.00 ± 0.30) × 10 -11 , which is more precise than using averages of the present tree-level values of |V cb |, |V ub | and γ. Furthermore, we point out the correlation between B(K + → π + ν ν), B(B s → µ + µ -) and γ within the SM, that is only very weakly dependent on other CKM parameters. Finally, we update the correlation of K L → π 0 ν ν with the ratio ε /ε in the SM taking the recent progress on ε /ε from lattice QCD and the large N approach into account.In view of the recent start of the NA62 experiment at CERN that is expected to measure the K + → π + ν ν branching ratio with a precision of 10%, we summarise the present status of this promising decay within the Standard Model (SM).

        <p>The measurements of the branching ratios of the two golden modes K + → π + ν ν and K L → π 0 ν ν will be among the top highlights of flavour physics in the rest of this decade. K + → π + ν ν is CP conserving while K L → π 0 ν ν is governed by CP violation. Both decays are dominated in the SM and in many of its extensions by Z penguin diagrams. These decays are theoretically very clean, and the calculation of their branching ratios within the SM includes next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections to the top quark contributions [1][2][3], NNLO QCD corrections to the charm contribution [4][5][6] and NLO electroweak corrections [7][8][9] to both top and charm contributions. Moreover, extensive calculations of isospin breaking effects and non-perturbative effects have been performed [10,11]. Reviews of these two decays can be found in [12][13][14][15][16][17][18] and their power in probing energy scales as high as several hundreds of TeV has been demonstrated in [19].The measurements of the branching ratios of the two golden modes K + → π + ν ν and K L → π 0 ν ν will be among the top highlights of flavour physics in the rest of this decade.

This is motivated in particular by the fact that different estimates appear in the literature due to different inputs used for the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements, which presently constitute the main uncertainty in the SM predictions for these two branching ratios. This has been stressed in [23], where the dependence of both branching ratios on the chosen values of |V cb | and |V ub | extracted from tree-level decays has been studied (see table 3 of that paper).In view of the recent start of the NA62 experiment at CERN that is expected to measure the K + → π + ν ν branching ratio with a precision of 10% compared to the SM prediction [20,21], and the expected measurement of K L → π 0 ν ν by KOTO around 2020 JHEP11(2015)033 at J-PARC [15,22], it is the right time to summarise the present status of these decays within the SM.

As New Physics (NP) seems to now be well separated from the electroweak scale, this determination of the CKM matrix is not expected to be polluted by NP contributions. 1 Inserting these inputs into the known expressions for the relevant branching ratios (see section 2) then allows a determination of the SM values for the K → πν ν branching ratios independently of whether NP is present at short distance scales or not. The departure of these predictions from future data would therefore allow us to discover whether NP contributes to these decays independently of whether it contributes to other decays or not. This information is clearly important for the selection of successful extensions of the SM through flavour-violating processes.where γ is an angle of the unitarity triangle (UT).

        <p>Unfortunately, this strategy cannot be executed in a satisfactory manner at present due to the discrepancies between inclusive and exclusive determinations of |V cb | and |V ub | from tree-level decays. Moreover, the precision on γ from tree-level decays is still unsatisfactory for this purpose. While the measurement of γ should be significantly improved by LHCb in the coming years, discrepancies between inclusive and exclusive determinations of |V cb | and |V ub | from tree-level decays are likely to be resolved only by the time of the Belle II experiment at SuperKEKB at the end of this decade.Unfortunately, this strategy cannot be executed in a satisfactory manner at present due to the discrepancies between inclusive and exclusive determinations of |V cb | and |V ub | from tree-level decays.

        <p>The clarification of the discrepancies between inclusive and exclusive determinations of |V cb | and |V ub | from tree-level decays is important, but there are reasons to expect that the exclusive determinations will eventually be the ones to be favoured. First of all, exclusive measurements are easier to perform than the inclusive ones. Equally important, due to the significant improvement in the calculations of the relevant form factors by lattice QCD, exclusive determinations are more straightforward than the inclusive ones. This is opposite to the philosophy of ten years ago, where QCD lattice calculations were still at the early stage and inclusive determinations were favoured.The clarification of the discrepancies between inclusive and exclusive determinations of |V cb | and |V ub | from tree-level decays is important, but there are reasons to expect that the exclusive determinations will eventually be the ones to be favoured.

        <p>Yet, from the present perspective it is useful to study the SM predictions for K + → π + ν ν and K L → π 0 ν ν in the full range of |V cb |, |V ub | and γ known from tree-level decays, as this will clearly demonstrate the need for the reduction of parametric uncertainties. This will also allow the SM predictions for these decays to be monitored as the determination of JHEP11(2015)033 γ will improve in the coming years at the LHC. This should be of interest in view of the first results on K + → π + ν ν from NA62, which are expected already in 2016. Moreover, it will also be of interest to see how other observables, like ε K , ∆M s , ∆M d , and rare B s,d decays are modified when the parameters in (1.1) are varied, and what their correlations with K + → π + ν ν and K L → π 0 ν ν are within the SM. As we will see, some of these correlations are practically independent of |V cb | and |V ub | and as such are particularly suited for a precise tests of the SM.Yet, from the present perspective it is useful to study the SM predictions for K + → π + ν ν and K L → π 0 ν ν in the full range of |V cb |, |V ub | and γ known from tree-level decays, as this will clearly demonstrate the need for the reduction of parametric uncertainties.

This is basically what the UTfit [27] and CKMfitter [28] collaborations do, except that we ignore the tree-level determinations of |V cb |, |V ub | and γ for the reasons stated above. As the dominant top quark contribution to ε K is proportional to |V cb | 4 and ∆M s,d are proportional to |V cb |2 , a useful determination of |V cb | can be obtained from these quantities. 3 The full UT is then constructed by using the ratio ∆M d /∆M s and S ψK S .

        <p>The prospects for improved measurements of B(K + → π + ν ν) are very good. One should stress that already a measurement of this branching ratio with an accuracy of 10% will give us a very important insight into the physics at short distance scales. Indeed the NA62 experiment at CERN [20,21] is aiming to reach this precision, and it is expected to accumulate 100 SM events with a good signal over background figure by 2018. In order to achieve a 5% measurement of the branching ratio, which will be the next goal of NA62, more time is needed. The planned new experiment at Fermilab (ORKA) could in principle reach the accuracy of 5% [43]. 4Concerning K L → π 0 ν ν, the KOTO experiment at J-PARC aims in the first step in measuring B(K L → π 0 ν ν) at SM sensitivity and should provide interesting results around 2020 on this branching ratio [15,22]. There are also plans to measure this decay at CERN and one should hope that Fermilab will contribute to these efforts in the next decade. The combination of K + → π + ν ν and K L → π 0 ν ν is particularly powerful in testing NP. Assuming that NA62 and KOTO will reach the expected precision and the branching ratios on these decays will be at least as high as the ones predicted in the SM, these two decays are expected to be the superstars of flavour physics after 2018.The prospects for improved measurements of B(K + → π + ν ν) are very good.

While ε /ε clearly does not depend on this difference, it is crucial to take it into account when extracting the value of B from the results obtained by RBC-UKQCD collaboration. To this end we use eq. ( 30) for A 2 in [94], adjust to our normalisation, and compare to A 2 expressed in terms of Q 8 (µ) 2 in (C.5).
