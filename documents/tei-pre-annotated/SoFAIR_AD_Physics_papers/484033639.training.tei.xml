        <p>Context. The Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) contains more than half a million sources that are identified as variable stars. Aims. We summarise the processing and results of the identification of variable source candidates of RR Lyrae stars, Cepheids, longperiod variables (LPVs), rotation modulation (BY Dra-type) stars, δ Scuti and SX Phoenicis stars, and short-timescale variables. In this release we aim to provide useful but not necessarily complete samples of candidates. Methods. The processed Gaia data consist of the G, G BP , and G RP photometry during the first 22 months of operations as well as positions and parallaxes. Various methods from classical statistics, data mining, and time-series analysis were applied and tailored to the specific properties of Gaia data, as were various visualisation tools to interpret the data. Results. The DR2 variability release contains 228 904 RR Lyrae stars, 11 438 Cepheids, 151 761 LPVs, 147 535 stars with rotation modulation, 8882 δ Scuti and SX Phoenicis stars, and 3018 short-timescale variables. These results are distributed over a classification and various Specific Object Studies tables in the Gaia archive, along with the three-band time series and associated statistics for the underlying 550 737 unique sources. We estimate that about half of them are newly identified variables. The variability type completeness varies strongly as a function of sky position as a result of the non-uniform sky coverage and intermediate calibration level of these data. The probabilistic and automated nature of this work implies certain completeness and contamination rates that are quantified so that users can anticipate their effects. This means that even well-known variable sources can be missed or misidentified in the published data. Conclusions. The DR2 variability release only represents a small subset of the processed data. Future releases will include more variable sources and data products; however, DR2 shows the (already) very high quality of the data and great promise for variability studies.Context.

        <p>The results in DR2 are based on the first 22 months of Gaia data, taken between 25 July 2014 and 23 May 2016. For the variability analysis we made use of the photometric time series in the G, G BP , and G RP bands, using field-of-view (FoV) averaged transit photometry. An exception to this was the analysis of short-timescale variables, for which some per-CCD G-band photometry was also analysed, but not published. The photometry is described in detail in Evans et al. (2018) and Riello et al. (2018). We emphasise that owing to the tight DR2 dataprocessing schedule, we only had access to a preliminary version of the DR2 astrometric solution (Lindegren et al. 2018), on which our results are based. No radial velocity data or astrophysical parameters were available during our processing.The results in DR2 are based on the first 22 months of Gaia data, taken between 25 July 2014 and 23 May 2016.

        <p>As a consequence of the Gaia scanning law, the sky coverage is rather non-uniform for the 22 months of DR2 data, resulting in sky-coverage gaps when selecting a certain minimum number of FoV transits. In our processing, we used cuts of ≥2, ≥12, and ≥20 G-band FoV transits, which we discuss in Sect. 3. Figure 1 shows the effect of these cuts on the sample of all available time series at the time of processing. Assuming that all sources with ≥2 FoV transits are bona fide sources, these figures show that a cut of ≥12 FoV transits results in a relative completeness of 80%, and a cut of ≥20 FoV transits results in a relative completeness of only 51%. It can generally be expected that these relative completeness are an upper limit to the absolute (sky) completeness, which is assessed in detail in the follow-up variability papers mentioned in the introduction. Arenou et al. (2018) conclude that the catalogue is mostly complete, in the absolute sense, roughly between magnitudes 7 and 17, and incomplete beyond.

        <p>We remark that the numbers in Table 1 and Fig. 1 do not correspond exactly to the number of sources published in the gaia_source table of DR2 because various source filters in the global Gaia processing chain were applied before and after the variability processing.

        <p>Depending on the type of object, there might only exist either a classification or SOS result. SOS results have generally lower contamination than the classification results and contain various type-specific astrophysical parameters that can be used to obtain more detailed information (such as the period), although this information might be available for a less sky-uniform sample due to the minimum number of G-band FoV observations of 12 or 20, depending on the SOS type. The classification contains only a label and "score" and has generally higher contamination rates, but it contains larger samples that are (more) uniformly distributed over the sky due to the minimum number of G-band FoV observations, which are 5 for RR Lyrae stars, 6 for δ Scuti and SX Phoenicis stars, 9 for Cepheids, and 12 for LPVs. These differences between classification and SOS in contamination rate and sample size are part of the pipeline design in which classification results feed into most of the SOS modules, as shown in Fig. 2 and discussed in more detail in the DR1 paper (Eyer et al. 2017).Depending on the type of object, there might only exist either a classification or SOS result. SOS results have generally lower contamination than the classification results and contain various type-specific astrophysical parameters that can be used to obtain more detailed information (such as the period), although this information might be available for a less sky-uniform sample due to the minimum number of G-band FoV observations of 12 or 20, depending on the SOS type.

        <p>The variability processing makes use of photometric data provided in units of fluxes (e/s), and then converts them into magnitudes using the magnitude zero-points defined in Evans et al. (2018). In our pipeline, this transformation is done by our 
            <rs type="software">GaiaFluxToMagOperator</rs> operator. Several additional operators were used to remove FoV transits by flagging and filtering them when they did not meet the required criteria, that is, when they were of insufficient quality. The chain of consecutive operators is described briefly here, for more details see the DR2 documentation:
        </p>
        <p>-RemoveNaNNegativeAndZeroValuesOperator flagged and removed transits with NaN, negative, or zero flux values. -RemoveDuplicateObservationsOperator flagged and removed pairs of transits with too close observation times (essentially one transit from the pair was incorrectly assigned to the source). This operator was responsible for the majority of the transit removals for G magnitudes brighter than ∼8; see Mowlavi et al. (2018) The time series following the above last operator was then the input for the different variability modules, and all transits that were flagged and filtered in the operator chain can be identified in the published time series by the rejected_by_variability flag (see Sect. 4.2). The resulting number of selected (i.e., not-rejected) transits can be found in the num_selected_g_fov/bp/rp fields of the vari_time_series_statistics table. In Figs. A.1-A.3 the rejected transits are plotted as crosses. However, some SOS modules (e.g., SOS Cep and RRL, SOS rotation modulation) applied individual stricter conditions that were tuned for their analysis. We note that the SOS short timescale module also used another operator, 
            <rs type="software">RemoveOutlierPerTransitOperator</rs>, to remove CCD outliers per transit.

        <p>Short-timescale variable sources are astrophysical objects showing any variability in their optical light curve with a characteristic timescale of the variation shorter than 1 d (Roelens et al. 2017). A variety of astronomical objects are known to exhibit such fast photometric variations, including both periodic and transient variability, involving amplitudes from a few millimagnitudes to a few magnitudes, with different variability characteristics and phenomena at the origin of variation, from pulsations to flares to eclipsing systems. The diverse variability types targeted by the short-timescale module range from short-period binary stars to pulsating white dwarfs (e.g., ZZ Ceti stars or V777 Herculis stars) and cataclysmic variables such as AM Canum Venaticorum stars. However, for the Gaia DR 2, the short-timescale variability processing is oriented towards periodic variability, and the exact variable type of the detected short-timescale candidates is not yet determined. Both the investigation of transient variability (Wevers et al. 2018) and the further classification of the candidates are foreseen for the future Gaia data releases.Short-timescale variable sources are astrophysical objects showing any variability in their optical light curve with a characteristic timescale of the variation shorter than 1 d (Roelens et al. 2017).

        <p>As mentioned previously, the identification of the shorttimescale variable candidates published in Gaia DR2 involves particular variability detection methods that are specifically tuned to detect fast photometric variability, complementarily to the general variability detection approach (which may miss some of these events because they are so fast). These methods are applied to a preselected subset of the Gaia data set (Eyer et al. 2017): for Gaia DR 2, the short-timescale variability analysis is restricted to relatively faint sources (G ∼ 16.5-20 mag) whose G per-CCD time series indicates that they are likely to show rapid variations (Roelens et al. 2018). Consequently, the candidates resulting from the short-timescale module are expected to overlap with other short-period SOS variables such as RR Lyrae and δ Scuti stars with periods shorter than 1 d, even though not there is no complete overlap with these SOS variable candidates.As mentioned previously, the identification of the shorttimescale variable candidates published in Gaia DR2 involves particular variability detection methods that are specifically tuned to detect fast photometric variability, complementarily to the general variability detection approach (which may miss some of these events because they are so fast).

        <p>The SOS short-timescale module identified 3018 short-timescale, suspected periodic candidates. These bona fide, short-timescale, suspected periodic candidates were identified based on the combination of the variogram analysis (Eyer &amp; Genton 1999;Roelens et al. 2017), least-squares frequency search (Zechmeister &amp; Kürster 2009), analysis of the environment of candidate sources over the sky, and a series of selection criteria from various statistics, such as the Abbe or inter-quartile range (IQR) values in the three bands (G, G BP , and G RP ).The SOS short-timescale module identified 3018 short-timescale, suspected periodic candidates.

        <p>Completeness and contamination numbers for the shorttimescale variable candidate sample, estimated by comparing OGLE-II, III, IV, and Gaia data in the Magellanic Clouds, are listed in Table 3.

However, most of these contaminant sources have periods of a few days and quite high amplitudes, hence although they are no true short-period variables, their presence in the short-timescale published sample is justified.

        <p>Stellar flux modulation induced by surface inhomogeneities and rotation is searched for in a region of the HR diagram, broadly embracing stars of spectral type later than F on the main sequence. This type of variability, often indicated in the literature as BY Draconis stars (BY Dra) regardless of possible binarity, is an indication of active regions (dark spots and bright faculae on the stellar photosphere) that are produced by stellar magnetic activity. The evolution of stellar magnetic fields, similar to solar fields, produces variability phenomena on a wide range of timescales (see e.g., Lanza et al. 2004Lanza et al. , 2006;;Distefano et al. 2012, and references therein); one of the most prominent phenomena is the rotational modulation itself, from which the stellar rotation period can be inferred.Stellar flux modulation induced by surface inhomogeneities and rotation is searched for in a region of the HR diagram, broadly embracing stars of spectral type later than F on the main sequence.

        <p>The variability pipeline comprises two packages dedicated to the detection and characterisation of solar-like stars with rotational modulation. First, solar-like variable candidates are selected, and if they are confirmed, they are studied in more detail to determine stellar rotation periods and other properties. We detected some 7 × 10 5 periodic variables in the preselected HR diagram region, which excludes areas populated by pulsating variables. The remaining expected main contaminants are eclipsing binaries and spurious detections derived from an incomplete sampling. To filter out these cases as well as possible, we applied filters that exclude sources whose period-folded light curves have a significantly uneven distribution in phase, with significant gaps, and are far from being sinusoidal (see Lanzafame et al. 2018, for details). The final DR2 clean sample contains 147 535 rotational modulation candidates and fills 38% of the whole sky when divided into bins of ≈0.84 deg 2 (level 6 HEALPix); see for example Fig. 6.The variability pipeline comprises two packages dedicated to the detection and characterisation of solar-like stars with rotational modulation.

        <p>An estimate of the final completeness and contamination of the DR2 rotational modulation variables is hampered by the fact that the occurrence rate of the BY Dra phenomenon is largely unknown so far. It is expected that all low-mass dwarfs are magnetically active to some extent, and the rotational modulation detectability essentially depends on the instrumental sensitivity, and also on the active region distribution and the phase of the magnetic cycle at the epoch of observations. New lowmass dwarfs displaying rotational modulation are continuously detected with the ever-wider span and increasing sensitivity of modern surveys, none of which has the full sky coverage capabilities of Gaia, however. At this stage, it is possible to perform some meaningful comparison only with the Hartman et al. (2010) and Rebull et al. (2016) observations of the Pleiades, with which, nevertheless, the DR2 geq20 sky coverage still overlaps only marginally. Assuming that the Hartman et al. (2010) catalogue lists all the BY Dra in its FoV down to G ≈ 14.5, we estimate that the completeness of the BY Dra sample is 14% down to G ≈ 16.5 in the overlapping field. Assuming that this value is uniform over the whole sky, we estimate a completeness upper limit of 5%. At the other extreme, we may assume that all low-mass dwarfs are BY Dra variables. Then, comparing with all stars observed by Gaia in the same sky region and magnitude range, we estimate a lower completeness limit of 0.7%.An estimate of the final completeness and contamination of the DR2 rotational modulation variables is hampered by the fact that the occurrence rate of the BY Dra phenomenon is largely unknown so far.

        <p>We may roughly estimate an upper limit for contamination by assuming that the Gaia BY Dra detections that are not present in the Hartman et al. (2010) or in the Rebull et al. (2016) samples in the common region on the sky are variables of other types. This upper limit is obviously largely overestimated given that no BY Dra catalogue can be deemed complete to date, as also testified by the fact that there are sources in the Hartman et al.

        <p>At the other extreme, we can make an educated guess regarding the contamination of close grazing binaries that would be incorrectly classified as BY Dra because of the similarity of the light curves. If the orbital period is long, then the grazing eclipse occurs only in a small part of the orbit, and it does not look like rotation modulation. We assume an upper limit period of 10 days for this contaminating effect. The fraction of stars with such short-period companions is only about 2-5% (Raghavan et al. 2010), of which only 2-5% are grazing binaries (at most), which means 0.04-0.25 % of the stars, while we did not yet take into account that for most binaries, the secondaries are substantially smaller. Even though we cannot consider the rotation modulation sample a random subset of G and later-type stars (which is the assumption in above estimate), it seems unlikely that this type of contamination would exceed 1%. The same conclusion is reached from our internal validation against known and newly identified (but not published) eclipsing binaries, based on which, we estimate an upper limit of 0.5% grazing contamination. From the estimated grazing binary contamination and non-occurrence in the reference catalogue discussed above, we estimate a contamination level ranging from &lt;1% to ≈50%, as listed in Table 3. More details on the SVD solar-like and SOS rotational modulation packages and results can be found in Lanzafame et al. (2018).At the other extreme, we can make an educated guess regarding the contamination of close grazing binaries that would be incorrectly classified as BY Dra because of the similarity of the light curves.

        <p>Differences are found between classification types (as obtained by supervised classification in the geq2 path) and the types that are eventually derived in SOS results (either from the geq12 or geq20 paths). In particular, one source was classified as DSCT_SXPHE, but also appears in SOS rotational modulation. Similarly, one source was classified as MIRA_SR, was not confirmed by SOS LPV, but appears in SOS rotational modulation.

Of the sources classified as an RR Lyrae star (any type), 70 appear in the SOS short timescale table, one was instead confirmed as a Cepheid by SOS (shown in the top panel of Fig. A.2), and many were confirmed as RR Lyrae star by SOS. Overall, a reassignment of the type from RRL into Cep by SOS occurred in 618 cases, but only in 77 cases from Cepheid to RR Lyrae star by SOS. We have decided to retain the original classification type despite the possible reassignment by the SOS Cep&amp;RRL module or in cases where they were confirmed as another type by SOS modules.Differences are found between classification types (as obtained by supervised classification in the geq2 path) and the types that are eventually derived in SOS results (either from the geq12 or geq20 paths).

        <p>In this second Gaia data release, a sample of 550 737 variable sources with their three-band time series and analysis results has been released to the astronomical community, showcasing samples of high-amplitude variable candidates distributed over (a large portion of) the whole sky. It demonstrates the immense potential of Gaia data to provide an unbiased all-sky photometric survey together with astrometric and spectroscopic data. Although the variability analyses in DR2 did only mildly rely on the astrometric data and on none of the spectroscopic data, this dependence will become much heavier in future data releases.In this second Gaia data release, a sample of 550 737 variable sources with their three-band time series and analysis results has been released to the astronomical community, showcasing samples of high-amplitude variable candidates distributed over (a large portion of) the whole sky.

        <p>Several caveats have been outlined in this paper: -Most provided stellar samples are rather incomplete as a result of the current state of data calibration (e.g., even well-known variables might be missing) or the limited scanning law coverage for the minimum number of selected observations, -known incomplete flagging of outliers in the time series, -existence of uncalibrated systematics or spurious calibration error signals in some of the time series, -the probabilistic and automated nature of this work implies certain completeness and contamination rates (Tables 2 and3), hence even well-known literature sources could be misidentified. Overall, we estimate10 to have identified the following numbers of new variables: a few hundred Cepheids, a few tens of thousand RR Lyrae stars, about one hundred thousand stars with rotation modulation, several tens of thousand long-period variables, a few thousand δ Scuti and SX Phoenicis stars, and a few thousand short-timescale variables. In total, this is about half of the variable sources released in this DR2. Compared to the DR1 example, we increased the sample size about 100 times, which is expected to result in a large number of novel studies, regardless of whether they are combined with existing data sets.Several caveats have been outlined in this paper: -Most provided stellar samples are rather incomplete as a result of the current state of data calibration (e.g., even well-known variables might be missing) or the limited scanning law coverage for the minimum number of selected observations, -known incomplete flagging of outliers in the time series, -existence of uncalibrated systematics or spurious calibration error signals in some of the time series, -the probabilistic and automated nature of this work implies certain completeness and contamination rates (Tables 2 and3), hence even well-known literature sources could be misidentified.
