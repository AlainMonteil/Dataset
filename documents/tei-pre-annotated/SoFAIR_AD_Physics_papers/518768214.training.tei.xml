        <p>X-ray spectroscopy is an important tool for scientific analysis. While the earliest demonstration experiments were realised in the laboratory, with the advent of synchrotron light sources most of the experiments shifted to large scale synchrotron facilities. In the recent past there is an increased interest to perform X-ray experiments also with in-house laboratory sources, to simplify access to X-ray absorption and X-ray emission spectroscopy, in particular for routine measurements. Here we summarise the recent developments and comment on the most representative example experiments in the field of in-house laboratory X-ray spectroscopy. We first give an introduction and some historic background on X-ray spectroscopy. This is followed by an overview of the detection techniques used for X-ray absorption and X-ray emission measurements. A short paragraph also puts related high energy resolution and resonant techniques into context, though they are not yet feasible in the laboratory. At the end of this section the opportunities using wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in the laboratory are discussed. Then we summarise the relevant details of the recent experimental laboratory setups split into two separate sections, one for the recent von Hamos setups, and one for the recent Johann/Johansson type setups. Following that, focussing on chemistry and catalysis, we then summarise some of the notable X-ray absorption and X-ray emission experiments and the results accomplished with in-house setups. In a third part we then discuss some applications of laboratory X-ray spectroscopy with a particular focus on chemistry and catalysis.X-ray spectroscopy is an important tool for scientific analysis.

        <p>The field of X-ray spectroscopy underwent a dramatic evolution during the past decades and there have been enormous developments and technological improvements, experimentally as well as in theory and modelling [1,2]. Nowadays X-ray spectroscopy is employed in almost every thinkable field of technology and research. To give just a few examples, applications range from fundamental research in chemistry [3][4][5][6][7][8], physics [9][10][11][12][13][14][15] and material science [16,17], to environmental research [18,19], architecture [20], art [19,21,22], archeology [19,[23][24][25] and industrial applications [19], to even forensics [19], security systems [26,27] and astronomy [28][29][30][31]. In a scientific context X-ray spectroscopy is also known as core-level-or core-spectroscopy [32,33] and it has become an essential tool for the study of a vast number of systems. Two of the key attributes of X-rays are the intrinsic elemental selectivity due to the characteristic energy of the core-level transitions and, especially for hard X-rays, the methods are bulk sensitive, referring to the ability to penetrate a material allowing one to 'look inside'. Over the years many books on core-spectroscopy have been written making it essentially impossible to create a complete list, hence we only refer to a few example sources [1,2,19,32,34] for the interested reader.The field of X-ray spectroscopy underwent a dramatic evolution during the past decades and there have been enormous developments and technological improvements, experimentally as well as in theory and modelling [1,2].

        <p>Historically, in most cases W.C. Röntgen is with his article Uber eine neue Art von Strahlen, published in 1895 [35,36], credited for the discovery of X-rays. For his work he received in 1901 the Nobel Prize in Physics in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by the discovery of the remarkable rays subsequently named after him [37]. However, as Lederman [38] and Grubbé [39] point out others have used X-rays prior to Röntgen and much of the ground work had been done several years before by Plücker (1859) [40,41], Crookes (1875) and Lenard (1893) (both cited by Grubbé [39]). Nonetheless, in German speaking countries X-rays are called 'Röntgenstrahlung' crediting Röntgen as the discoverer of this new kind of light.Historically, in most cases W.C.

        <p>In the early days X-rays were a physical curiosity and mostly used only for therapeutical or medical applications [39]. The last years of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century were a revolutionary time in physics with a lot of controversy [42]. During these years, among the well-known figures including Planck, Heisenberg and Einstein many others such as Born [43,44], Sommerfeld [45,46] and Bohr [42,47] made significant contributions laying the foundation of quantum-mechanics and the fundamental understanding of the atomic structure. This was the beginning of modern physics and core spectroscopy as we know it today.In the early days X-rays were a physical curiosity and mostly used only for therapeutical or medical applications [39].

        <p>One of the fundamental discoveries relevant to the field of Xrays came from Lawrence Bragg and his father William H. Bragg which they published in 1913 [48]. They systematically studied The Reflection of X-rays by Crystals, for which they both received the Nobel price in physics in 1915, and Bragg's law was subsequently named after them. Also in 1913 De Broglie published his remarkable article Recherches sur la diffraction des rayons de Röntgen par les milieux cristallins [49] in which he uses Bragg's law employing salt crystals (NaCl and K 3 [Fe(CN) 6 ]) to disperse the emission of an X-ray tube and to measure one of the first X-ray absorption spectra (XAS). Other early notable spectroscopic experiments with X-rays were carried out in the laboratory by Coster [50,51], Sommerfeld [45,46], Siegbahn [52] and Kronig [53] in the 1920s and 30s.One of the fundamental discoveries relevant to the field of Xrays came from Lawrence Bragg and his father William H.

        <p>One of the first reports of an X-ray Emission Spectrum (XES), published by Lundquist [54] in 1925, was based on measurements using an X-ray tube with a copper anode, operating at approximately 200 Watts. In this early experiment the dispersive component was a natural calcite (CaCO 3 ) crystal employed for the investigation of the Kb emission lines of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). This experiment done almost one century ago is in its essence still one of the important methods in regard to chemical speciation [3].One of the first reports of an X-ray Emission Spectrum (XES), published by Lundquist [54] in 1925, was based on measurements using an X-ray tube with a copper anode, operating at approximately 200 Watts.

        <p>Before we discuss the existing in-house setups, we review in this section the essential techniques required for the production and detection of X-rays. Due to the fact that hard X-rays can be used at ambient conditions, while measurements in the soft Xray energy range typically require a vacuum setup, we focus on the hard X-ray energy range. However, some of the sources mentioned are employed for the generation of soft X-rays and where appropriate we also give some references with respect to the soft energy range.Before we discuss the existing in-house setups, we review in this section the essential techniques required for the production and detection of X-rays.

        <p>Nowadays, there are various kinds of X-ray sources.

        <p>In 1974 the first machine designed as dedicated X-ray light source using a 300 MeV storage ring was built in Japan [55][56][57]. Though some earlier machines did exist, they were not designed as light sources and the light was rather used in a parasitic mode. Since these early days of synchrotron radiation huge improvements have been made. Most importantly the development of the so-called insertion devices (wigglers, undulators) around 1980 can be considered as one of the big milestones for modern X-ray spectroscopy leading to a broad application in many research fields [57][58][59].In 1974 the first machine designed as dedicated X-ray light source using a 300 MeV storage ring was built in Japan [55][56][57].

        <p>Since then great efforts have been made to improve and use the various unique properties of synchrotron radiation. For example the increased intensity across a broad energy range, the high coherence and low angular divergence (brilliance), but also the tunability using undulators and sophisticated single and double bounce monochromators, and taking advantage of the intrinsic pulsed time structure and high degree of polarisation are important properties of synchrotron light [57]. All these properties are often highly desirable making the currently existing third and fourth generation of synchrotron light sources still irreplaceable for many applications and without doubt an essential tool in modern research. Hence, we are now seeing some of theses machines being either in the planning-phase or in the process to be upgraded to deliver even higher brilliance and coherence (ERSF upgrade completed in 2020 [60], SOLEIL upgrade planned for 2022-25 [61], SLS upgrade planned for 2021-24 [62]).Since then great efforts have been made to improve and use the various unique properties of synchrotron radiation.

        <p>Synchrotrons are and will be for the foreseeable future irreplaceable for many applications. However, as access to large scale infrastructure is limited and highly competitive, we are seeing in the recent years more efforts being made to bring the know-how from the synchrotron back into the lab in order to simplify access and to increase the available measurement time. Hence, modern lab sources are being utilised as a valuable alternative for some applications, or as a means to allow for preliminary tests for Xray spectroscopic studies. Moreover, lab-based spectrometers also enable to perform different types of experiments, such as for example long-term measurements or the study of systems which are toxic or dangerous and hence not allowed at many synchrotrons. [63,64] Thus, there are attempts by Lyncean to employ 'mini synchrotrons' in the lab, which they call Compact Light Source (CLS).

        <p>The most common laboratory sources in the hard X-ray energy range are, due to their relatively simple working principle the classic, though highly improved [68] X-ray tubes using various anode materials. It is well known that X-ray tubes convert only about 1% of the energy applied to the anode into radiation, while the majority of 99% is lost due to the conversion into thermal energy. [68,2] Thus a 100 W tube (f.e. with an acceleration potential of U ¼ 25 kV and an electron beam current of I ¼ 4 mA) delivers only 1 W of light across its entire spectrum. This translates to an order of magnitude of roughly 10 12 À 10 13 photons per second integrated over all energies. The result is, depending on the photon energy and aperture of the slits used, approximately 10 2 À 10 4 photons per second when monochromatised to a sub-eV bandwidth. The characteristic lines, however, of course yield notably higher count rates. Overall this illustrates that X-ray tubes are obviously a very inefficient source of radiation.The most common laboratory sources in the hard X-ray energy range are, due to their relatively simple working principle the classic, though highly improved [68] X-ray tubes using various anode materials.

        <p>Since most of the energy transferred to the anode dissipates as heat, in fact, the melting point of the anode material sets the limit for the maximum power of the tube, making substantial cooling necessary for high-power X-ray tubes [2]. To address this problem, rotating and even liquid metal anodes are used as a target in highpower X-ray tubes [69][70][71]. An alternative approach is presented by Tuohimaa et al. [72] who introduced a methanol jet as a nonmetal liquid target excited by an electron beam. A promising recent development are so-called Line Focus X-ray Tubes (LFXTs) which employ an extremely small focal spot in one direction. It is essentially a very thin line allowing for a much more efficient heat dissipation when compared to conventional point source Xray tubes. The photon flux and coherence length of such a LFXT is predicted to be comparable to inverse Compton scattering sources (see Fig. 1) [73].Since most of the energy transferred to the anode dissipates as heat, in fact, the melting point of the anode material sets the limit for the maximum power of the tube, making substantial cooling necessary for high-power X-ray tubes [2].

        <p>Yet another approach addressing the issue of heat-dissipation is offered by Sigray, who have developed a microstructured anode material comprised of arrays of metal, such as copper (Cu) or tungsten (W), embedded in a diamond substrate. This allows for highly localised and large thermal gradients for rapid passive cooling. Additionally the linear accumulation across the embedded microstructures notably increases the emitted photon flux produced by the source [74]. A different approach is to use laser driven X-ray sources, though they are typically limited to the soft X-ray energy range E &lt; 500 eV. Their working principle is essentially that a very intense laser creates a plasma from various target materials, which then recombines under emission of X-rays, hence they are called Laser Plasma Source (LPS) or more specifically Laser Plasma X-ray Source (LPXS) [75][76][77][78][79]. One of the major advantages of a LPS is that a Laser can create well-defined pulses translating into pulses of X-rays which then enable time-resolved X-ray experiments.Yet another approach addressing the issue of heat-dissipation is offered by Sigray, who have developed a microstructured anode material comprised of arrays of metal, such as copper (Cu) or tungsten (W), embedded in a diamond substrate.

        <p>Also the detection of X-rays has dramatically improved during the last century [80]. On the one hand there are Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) detectors, such as solid state Silicon Drift Detectors (SDDs) with an energy resolution up to DE % 120eV (due to the Fano limit [2,81,82]), and even spatially resolving 1D line and 2D area EDX pixel detectors [83][84][85][86]. The latter ones are essentially a 'color camera' for the X-ray energy range. Typically EDX detectors can cover a large energy range, from approximately 1 keV to 40 keV [87].Also the detection of X-rays has dramatically improved during the last century [80].

        <p>Wavelength Dispersive X-ray (WDX) detection on the other hand is commonly used to achieve the highest possible energy resolution by trading flux for resolution. WDX configurations take advantage of Bragg's law [48], where a grating or crystal is used to spatially disperse the photons wavelength selectively. In the soft X-ray energy range below 2 keV, gratings are usually preferred, while at higher energies for hard X-rays crystal analysers are used [76,82]. Under ideal conditions they can reach a sub-eV energy resolution in the hard and a few tens of meV in the soft X-ray range [82,88,89]. Considering the most recent developments at the SIX beamline at NSLS-II, they now reach a DE ¼ 14meV at an energy of E ¼ 1 keV, translating to a E=DE % 71500 [90]. The downside of the WDX based detection is that each (crystal) configuration covers a relatively small energy range, say a few hundred eV in the soft energy range to a few keV in the hard energy range. Another aspect is that due to the cot h B ð Þ relation the resolving power decreases notably for measurements at low Bragg angles h B [91,92].

        <p>A flat crystal spectrometer employed in a scanning approach provides the highest resolution, because curved crystals suffer from geometrical aberrations related to imperfections in the crystal when it is bent. Though, the strain in the crystal can be reduced with the 'strip-bent' method [93]. The spherically bent crystals (SBC) used in Johann and Johansson Rowland circle geometry give a luminosity enhancement of the order of 10 2 -10 3 due to an increased solid angle, but at the cost of some losses in the resolution due to the geometrical aberrations [94]. For both types of crystals, flat and curved, two types of spectrometer exists: Laue type (transmission) and Bragg type (reflection) instruments. Most reflection type instruments using curved crystal spectrometers are either operated in the Johann/Johansson geometry where the crystal is aligned in Rowland geometry, or in the slightly different von Hamos geometry. The transmission type instruments are most commonly using curved crystals employed in the DuMond and Cauchois geometry [94].A flat crystal spectrometer employed in a scanning approach provides the highest resolution, because curved crystals suffer from geometrical aberrations related to imperfections in the crystal when it is bent.

        <p>The Johann and Johansson geometries are almost identical, the main difference being the different crystals. Johansson crystals are bent to twice the radius of curvature of the spectrometer circle, and the inner surface is then ground away to match the radius equal to that of the spectrometer circle. The effect is that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection while the Bragg angle remains constant over the entire surface of the crystal. This leads essentially to a perfect focus with a high diffraction intensity (Fig. 2). Therefore, a Johansson crystal gives a better resolution over the entire spectrometer range than the Johann crystals [95].The Johann and Johansson geometries are almost identical, the main difference being the different crystals.

        <p>One important attribute in WDX spectroscopy is the effective solid angle. A larger solid angle directly translates into a higher intensity due to the collection of more photons. Hence, a common approach is to combine a number of crystals for a larger effective solid angle of detection. The first multi-crystal experimental setup used six crystals and was developed by Wang in 1997 [98]. Today there are several experimental setups operating at synchrotron facilities using an arrangement of multiple SBC to increase the solid angle [99][100][101]. Alonso-Mori [101] mentions for example the ESRF (beamline BM30B/CRG-FAME XAS, 5 analysers [102], and beamline ID26, 5 analyzers [103]), SSRL (beamline 6-2 using 14 analyzers [4]) the SLS (SuperXAS beamline uses 5 crystals) [104], and NSLS (beamline X21, uses 9 crystals) [105].One important attribute in WDX spectroscopy is the effective solid angle.

        <p>While the detectable countrate can be increased with multiple crystals, it typically also reduces the resolution due to small misalignments between each crystal. Furthermore, not all emissions from the sample are necessarily isotropic. Fluorescence emission is typically assumed to be isotropic, but especially resonant techniques or experiments with polarised light can show a strong angular dependence [106][107][108]. In other words, increasing the solid angle with multiple crystals comes at the cost of potentially loosing information of the angle of emission, which can be relevant for polarisation dependent experiments or resonant techniques [10,11,13,[106][107][108].While the detectable countrate can be increased with multiple crystals, it typically also reduces the resolution due to small misalignments between each crystal.

        <p>Another approach, of particular importance for time-resolved measurements, is the von Hamos geometry.

        <p>As such, the von Hamos setup enables one to acquire a spectrum without any moving components, implying a significant reduction of the measurement time per spectrum [101]. According to Bauer this comes at the cost of reduced energy resolution and lower signal intensities [100], while Alonso-Mori reports the signal to background ratio to be lower when compared with the one obtained in a Rowland based spectrometer [101]. However, this could be due to an insufficiently optimised setup, as Szlachetko states that the von Hamos setup provides a good energy resolution often below 1 eV at relatively large Bragg angles [3]. Furthermore, a von Hamos spectrometer can be built relatively compact due to the use of short curvature radiuses without loss on energy resolution. Importantly, both von Hamos and the Johansson geometries, can yield an absolute energy resolution significantly below the lifetime of characteristic emission lines, which is crucial for a detailed analysis of spectral features [3]. Something of more practical relevance is, that for the Johann/Johansson geometry one does not need a very tightly focused beam, because slits can be used to optimise the resolution of the instrument. For example, the Johann/Johansson type spectrometer works well with a source spot-size of approximately 0.5-1 mm, while the von Hamos geometry requires a good focus in the dispersion direction of approximately 50 lm.As such, the von Hamos setup enables one to acquire a spectrum without any moving components, implying a significant reduction of the measurement time per spectrum [101].

        <p>Comparison of three experimental XES setups with different sources and WDX spectrometers. a) refers to a laboratory von Hamos setup with a Ga metal-jet source [5] and b) refers to a commercial laboratory Johann setup from EasyXAFS using an X-ray tube as source, [123,125] and c) refers to a von Hamos setup installed at the PINK beamline at BESSY II. Most notable are the different acquisition times, where the synchrotron light source allows for much faster measurement due to the higher brilliance and better signal-to-noise ratio. Comparing the two geometries in terms of efficiency, the Johann approach is essentially always wasting a large fraction of photons, because it is always just looking at one energy at a time determined by the slit in front of the detector. Thus, though it introduces other limitations, the von Hamos approach appears to be the better choice in regard to the detection efficiency and acquisition times as it does not require scanning the spatially dispersed spectrum, but instead it simultaneously collects the photons of all energies.Comparison of three experimental XES setups with different sources and WDX spectrometers. a) refers to a laboratory von Hamos setup with a Ga metal-jet source [5] and b) refers to a commercial laboratory Johann setup from EasyXAFS using an X-ray tube as source, [123,125] and c) refers to a von Hamos setup installed at the PINK beamline at BESSY II.

        <p>In XAS the absorption of energy, typically carried by a photon, promotes an electron from a core-level to an empty orbital, thus one usually says that ''XAS probes the empty levels".

        <p>XAS is a well-established technique which can provide information on the oxidation state, site symmetry, and coordination environment of a selected analyte in the gas, liquid or solid phase [2,6,8,[3][4][5]7,32,33,126,128,127,129,130]. Transmission XAS experiments are the most direct way to measure the absorption as it does not suffer from self-absorption effects, where the latter is the case in most fluorescence yield detected XAS (FY-XAS) experiments [33,131,132]. However, transmission experiments can suffer from other effects, for example the pinhole effect caused by inhomogeneous concentrations or densities. Thus they require careful sample preparation and relatively concentrated samples, ideally in a light matrix. In contrast dilute samples, or systems with heavy matrices are better measured with fluorescence yield detected methods. Transmission XAS is a one-step process which can be modelled using Fermi's Golden Rule [133]. Most XAS experiments are performed at large scale synchrotron facilities acting as a highly brilliant (low divergence, highly monochromatic, high intensity) tunable source of photons.XAS is a well-established technique which can provide information on the oxidation state, site symmetry, and coordination environment of a selected analyte in the gas, liquid or solid phase [2,6,8,[3][4][5]7,32,33,126,128,127,129,130].

        <p>While XAS is a more general term referring to the absorption of photons, we are focussing here on the specific case where the XAS is used to study the X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS). Hence, in our review the two terms may be used interchangeably unless specific differences are emphasised. In a typical XAFS experiment, the incident beam is usually monochromatic and the energy is scanned through an absorption edge of interest to selectively probe the unoccupied levels.

        <p>However, there are exceptions to this monochromatic incident beam approach where XAFS spectra can also be acquired when the incident beam is not monochromatic. The approach is often called Energy Dispersive XAS (EDXAS), which should not be confused with the 'energy dispersive' detection using solid-state detectors. In fact, one uses a wavelength dispersive curved crystal polychromator to spatially disperse the polychromatic X-ray beam and focus it onto the sample (see Fig. 4). In other words, the polychromatic beam is spatially dispersed in such a way that photons of different energies are passing through the sample at different angles [8,129,130,[135][136][137][138].However, there are exceptions to this monochromatic incident beam approach where XAFS spectra can also be acquired when the incident beam is not monochromatic.

        <p>Hence, perhaps Polychromatic Dispersive XAS (PDXAS) would be a better name, as it avoids the confusion with the EDX based detection, while it emphasizes that the polychromatic incident beam is sent through the sample in a spatially dispersed manner. Such experiments are especially useful for fast time-resolved XAS experiments where one is interested in the dynamics of a system, because it enables one to acquire a complete spectrum in a single shot as the time consuming energy scan of the incident beam is not required [138,139]. An implicit requirement, for all XAFS measurements but in particular in PDXAS (because the polychromatic focussing leads to a higher intensity) is that absorbing sites must be well separated, such that there is no overlap between the photo electron scattering spheres of each site. For example, if the incident photon density (intensity) would be so high that neighbouring sites each absorb a photon of different energy, then the photo electron scattering spheres would overlap and the XAFS structure would be altered due to the local interferences being disturbed by the interaction between the de Broglie waves of the neighbouring sites. However, such high intensities are typically only achievable at Free Electron Lasers (FELs) and certainly not (yet) achievable in the laboratory; this could explain why this aspect is usually not discussed at all.Hence, perhaps Polychromatic Dispersive XAS (PDXAS) would be a better name, as it avoids the confusion with the EDX based detection, while it emphasizes that the polychromatic incident beam is sent through the sample in a spatially dispersed manner.

        <p>XAFS spectra are commonly separated into the X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) covering the energy range approximately from 50 eV below to 100 eV above the main absorption edge, and the Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) starting above the XANES region reaching up to several hundreds of eV above the main edge (see Fig. 5).XAFS spectra are commonly separated into the X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) covering the energy range approximately from 50 eV below to 100 eV above the main absorption edge, and the Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) starting above the XANES region reaching up to several hundreds of eV above the main edge (see Fig. 5).</p>
        <p>XANES spectra can be further split into the pre-edge region and the main edge. The K pre-edge for 3d transition metals corresponds to the promotion of an electron from the 1s orbital (K-shell) into a 3d orbital (M-shell). Thus, neglecting non-local and local pdmixing, it rigorously refers to the local 1s ? 3d quadrupole transition.

        <p>The K main edge of 3d transition metals refers to the local 1s ? 4p dipole transition and for higher photon energies (E ph &gt; E ion ) also to transitions into the continuum as mentioned above [7,32,128,134,141]. Typical applications of XANES include ''fingerprint analysis" and the determination of the oxidation state of the analyte. Fingerprinting essentially means that one measures the XANES of known reference samples and subsequently compares the shape and structure of the spectrum with the XANES of an unknown system [142]. Using a more advanced analytic approach one can also perform a fit with a linear-combination of known references to derive the relative contributions in mixed systems.

        <p>Another nice example illustrating the relation between the oxidation and the energy position of various edge features is shown in a publication from Wong et al. (Fig. 5 therein) [141]. This shift of the absorption edge can be understood when considering that a change of the oxidation state implies the addition (chemical reduction, anionic) or the removal (chemical oxidation, cationic) of an electron, which means that the local charge changes with respect to the neutral metal state. The shift of the absorption edge occurs due to the change of the effective charge Z eff of the nucleus. In other words, changing a neutral atom to a positive ion notably increases the binding energy of the core electrons [146]. Hence the energy required to promote an electron from a core-level into an empty orbital results in a shift of the absorption edge to higher (oxidation) or lower (reduction) energy [146,147]. This appears especially conclusive when considering that the frontier orbitals (HOMO,LUMO) lie for the 3d transition metals typically in the 3d shell, while the K-main edge typically arises from the 1s ? 4p dipole transition. Hence, in a simple picture the edge position in K-edge XANES can be a direct measure of the analytes valence state [33,146,148]. Although XANES and EXAFS are part of same experiment, their respective analyses provide complementary information. While XANES is sensitive to oxidation state and geometrical structure around the central atom, EXAFS provides quantitative information on the local structure defined by bond distances, coordination numbers, and disorder around the probed atom.Another nice example illustrating the relation between the oxidation and the energy position of various edge features is shown in a publication from Wong et al.

        <p>In 1911 Barkla was the first to introduce labels for X-ray emission lines. Assuming that future discoveries would reveal 'more absorbing and more penetrating' radiation he wanted to leave alphabetically some space in either direction, hence he started with the letter K for the -as we know today -innermost shell [150]. Subsequently the higher shells where then labelled alphabetically, and these labels are relating to the principle quantum number n as we use them today, where n ¼ 1; 2; 3; 4 . . . corresponds to the K,L, M,N,. . .atomic shells. If Barkla would have known already that there is no lower level, the 1s orbital would have the letter A instead of K [150]. The most common notations in X-ray spectroscopy are the Siegbahn notation [151,152] (first introduced by Moseley in 1913 [153]) and the IUPAC notation [154]. In Table 2 we summarise some of the transitions in K-edge XES.In 1911 Barkla was the first to introduce labels for X-ray emission lines.

        <p>However, we want to emphasise that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) as well as local Coulomb interactions and exchange coupling usually lead to an orbital mixing, such that their nature is not pure anymore. Thus the assignment of the orbitals involved in each transition typically refers to the dominant contribution only [32,155]. The true contributions strongly depend on the particular system such that the Kb XES can also have significant metal 4p contributions as discussed by Tsutsumi et al. [156].However, we want to emphasise that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) as well as local Coulomb interactions and exchange coupling usually lead to an orbital mixing, such that their nature is not pure anymore.

        <p>IUPAC explicitly recommends to use the hyphen to separate the initial and final state levels (indicating the vacancy/electron hole), thus one should always write for example K-L 2;3 or K-L 2 L 3 instead of KL 2;3 or KL 2 L 3 . It is furthermore suggested to use K-L 2;3 instead of K-L 2 L 3 in cases where the experimental resolution is not sufficient to distinguish the K-L 2 transition from the K-L 3 transition. [154] In the following we will continue to use the Siegbahn notation as it allows also for a distinct assignment of non-diagram transitions involving the molecular orbitals which relate to the so-called satellites.IUPAC explicitly recommends to use the hyphen to separate the initial and final state levels (indicating the vacancy/electron hole), thus one should always write for example K-L 2;3 or K-L 2 L 3 instead of KL 2;3 or KL 2 L 3 .

        <p>The Ka 1 and Ka 2 lines, often just called Ka lines, refer to the radiative decay of a K-shell (1s orbital) vacancy being filled with an electron from the L 2 L 3 -shells (2p orbitals) [157].

        <p>The transition is dipole allowed, but with a notably smaller transition probability with respect to the Ka emission. The Kb main line consists of the Kb 1;3 main peak and a Kb 0 shoulder on the lowenergy side as shown in Fig. 7 (right) and Fig. 8. The Kb 1;3 doublet typically appears as a single peak due to the small spin-orbit interaction in the 3p valence shell (see Table 2) [158,159,161,162]. The separation between the Kb 1;3 and Kb0 feature is dominated by pdexchange coupling, while further perturbation of the spectra results from a 3p SOC contribution being typically an order of magnitude smaller that the pd-exchange.The transition is dipole allowed, but with a notably smaller transition probability with respect to the Ka emission.

        <p>A comparison of some iron compounds in high-spin and lowspin (see Fig. 8) suggests that the appearance of the Kb 0 shoulder could be used as a fingerprint for the spin-state of a system [163,161,162,96,159,158].A comparison of some iron compounds in high-spin and lowspin (see Fig. 8) suggests that the appearance of the Kb 0 shoulder could be used as a fingerprint for the spin-state of a system [163,161,162,96,159,158].</p>
        <p>The apparent difference of the Kb 0 shoulder between high-spin and low-spin complexes shown in Fig. 8 can be explained with the 3p3d exchange coupling in the valence shell, which typically dominates the other intra-atomic interactions in the valence shell.

        <p>As illustrated by Pollock et al. [159] with a series of high-spin iron compounds, the Kb main line, and especially the Kb 0 shoulder, can notably be modulated by the covalency of the ligand (see Fig. 9). This contradicts the common picture of the pure atomic nature of the Kb main line, where the Kb main emission is assigned to local intra-atomic transitions. In fact this shows that one must consider both, exchange coupling and covalency, when modelling and analysing the Kb main emission comprising the Kb 1;3 and Kb 0 lines [159,162].As illustrated by Pollock et al.

        <p>The Ka and Kb main emissions are nowadays commonly known and measured routinely. One can extend the transition rules to include also the molecular orbitals which are created by the hybridisation between the local atomic orbitals and the ligand's orbitals (see Table 2 bottom) [164]. These inter-atomic transitions will then yield information about the molecular electronic structure and the ligands involved [100,149,155,157,165,162]. Therefore we will in the following shortly introduce the so-called satellite emissions, which have first been reported by Sommerfeld and Wentzel in the early 1920s as spark lines in the X-ray spectrum [45,52,166,167].The Ka and Kb main emissions are nowadays commonly known and measured routinely.

        <p>We do not want to omit that also the Ka decays can show satellites, however, we will focus here on the Kb satellites as they involve the valence orbitals which are usually of greater interest. For more information on the Ka satellites we refer to Torres-Deluigi et al. [157]. The Kb satellite emission lines are the Kb 2;5 and Kb 00 , which appear on the high-energy side of the Kb 1;3 main line (see Table 2 and Fig. 7). Their relative intensity is usually only 10 À2 to 10 À3 with respect to the Kb 1;3 main line. Hence the term 'satellite', as they are weak lines in the vicinity of a strong parent emission [157]. These satellites carry ligand information via the molecular orbitals created by the hybridisation between the metal and the ligand [76,96,149,155,161,164,168,163,169,162]. In other words, the satellite emission lines do not correspond to the energy difference of two energy levels of the same atom, instead they are transitions involving metal-ligand mixed molecular orbitals (see Fig. 7 and Table 2). [96] The measurement of these satellite emissions is sometimes also summarised under the term Valence-to-Core XES (VtC-XES) [100,149,155,165].

        <p>It has been found that the Kb 00 line typically involves the molecular orbitals with ligand ns-type atomic orbitals (e.g. ligand 2s ? metal 1s), while the Kb 2;5 line is particularly sensitive to valence changes of the orbitals and primarily related to molecular orbitals with ligand np-type atomic character (e.g. ligand 2p ! metal 1s, see also Fig. 7) [170,96,160,163,164,171,172,149,161,168,173,174]. To be more clear, it is only ligand 2s/2p for the ligand elements with atomic number Z ¼ 5 to 9 (B,C,N,O,F), hence, to be more general we refer above to ligand ns/np orbitals. As Joe et al. [76] discuss, the centroid position of the Kb 2;5 feature for example relates to the oxidation state and spin state of the analyte. The centroid and the intensity of the weak Kb 00 feature can be used to identify bond lengths and the element species of the ligands, which can be understood via the characteristic energy of the ligand's 2s level. Though entirely based on different mechanisms, VtC-XES is somewhat related to EXAFS in the sense that both spectroscopies yield information on the local atomic structure around the absorbing atom [157,171]. However, while difficult with EXAFS, as discussed in several publications VtC-XES enables to distinguish different ligands with similar atomic numbers Z such as carbon (C, Z ¼ 6), nitrogen (N, Z ¼ 7), oxygen (O, Z ¼ 8) and fluorine (F, Z ¼ 9) as the example shown in Fig. 10 nicely illustrates [149,157,160,163,171,175,176].It has been found that the Kb 00 line typically involves the molecular orbitals with ligand ns-type atomic orbitals (e.g. ligand 2s ? metal 1s), while the Kb 2;5 line is particularly sensitive to valence changes of the orbitals and primarily related to molecular orbitals with ligand np-type atomic character (e.g. ligand 2p ! metal 1s, see also Fig. 7) [170,96,160,163,164,171,172,149,161,168,173,174].

        <p>Other recent studies have shown that the XES satellites can reveal even more detailed information on the ligand-based valence molecular orbitals. It has been shown for manganese complexes that the VtC region (Kb 00 and Kb 2;5 ) is sensitive to the relative contributions of the donor orbitals [170]. Another recommended study on copper complexes shows the sensitivity for the oxygen ligand O-O bondlengths [173]. A similar study on iron complexes shows the sensitivity to the nitrogen ligand N-N bondlengths [174].Other recent studies have shown that the XES satellites can reveal even more detailed information on the ligand-based valence molecular orbitals.

        <p>And finally, although we will not discuss here in detail we also want to mention that for some elements with higher atomic numbers (Z &gt; 28) [177], also the La and Lb emission lines, which fill a vacancy in the L-shell, can show satellites. This has been already reported for Tantalum (Ta, Z ¼ 73), Osmium (Os, Z ¼ 76), Iridium (Ir, Z ¼ 77), Gold (Au, Z ¼ 79) and Uranium (U, Z ¼ 92) by Richtmyer et al. in the 1930s. [177][178][179] Especially for those Lsatellites also the Coster-Kronig transitions play an important role, which refer in an over-simplified way to an intra-shell electron reordering process [180].And finally, although we will not discuss here in detail we also want to mention that for some elements with higher atomic numbers (Z &gt; 28) [177], also the La and Lb emission lines, which fill a vacancy in the L-shell, can show satellites.

        <p>Altogether, XES can provide valuable information on the absorbing species as well as information about the ligand environment and covalency, and even discriminate between different dimers with different protonation states [76,145,162,126,181,100,155,96,149,157].Altogether, XES can provide valuable information on the absorbing species as well as information about the ligand environment and covalency, and even discriminate between different dimers with different protonation states [76,145,162,126,181,100,155,96,149,157].</p>
        <p>Considering that XES often aims at the detection of very weak signals (satellites), which are often having a relative intensity of 10 À12 with respect to the incident flux, it is understandable that XES came into broader use only with the advent of highly brilliant synchrotron light sources [5,2]. Therefor most publications on XES and especially VtC-XES are based on synchrotron experiments.Considering that XES often aims at the detection of very weak signals (satellites), which are often having a relative intensity of 10 À12 with respect to the incident flux, it is understandable that XES came into broader use only with the advent of highly brilliant synchrotron light sources [5,2].

        <p>All these spectroscopies require a monochromatic incident beam for the excitation of the system, combined with a highresolution detection of the subsequent radiative decays. In other words, a combination of two WDX monochromators is required, one for the incident beam, and one for the photons emitted from the sample. And, as one trades in any WDX approach intensity for resolution, each of the two monochromators leads a notable reduction of the available flux. Additionally, intrinsic effects such as the photo absorption cross-section in the first step, and the photon yield in the second step further reduce the detectable countrate. This altogether emphasizes why resonant photon-in/ photon-out spectroscopies are very photon-hungry, making an intense source necessary for such measurements.

        <p>In non-resonant XES, however, one can use a 'white light excitation' such as an X-ray tube spectrum for example, hence the term 'non-resonant'. The polychromatic excitation makes the absorption step more efficient, and only one WDX spectrometer is required to enable for a high-resolution detection of the XES. This makes nonresonant XES a suitable method for laboratory measurements. However, as shown by Kopelent et al.

But because elucidating resonant techniques in detail goes far beyond the scope of this review, we would like to refer to other publications discussing HERFD-XAS and RXES/RIXS in more detail [9,12,14,15,32,140,[186][187][188][189][190]184,103,100,13,185,76,96,162].In resonant XES (RXES), as well as in RIXS, the excitation energy is tuned to be in and around a resonance of a specific feature in the region of interest.

        <p>Before we focus in the following on laboratory experiments only, we want to clarify that high-resolution laboratory spectroscopy is to date mainly limited by the low intensities of available laboratory sources. Therefore transmission XAS and nonresonant XES are the most common WDX techniques in the laboratory.

        <p>Being intrinsically element specific the detection of the X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) and XES has found many applications in the natural sciences. Due to its ability to penetrate materials it is especially useful in catalysis for in situ and operando studies [63]. As discussed above XAFS can give direct information on the oxidation state, symmetry and coordination of the analyte. XES, namely the shape of the Kb lines and its satellites (i.e. Kb 00 ; Kb 2;5 ) can reveal ligand information [162,100,192,183,96,157,2]. Due to the low photon yield such measurements are usually performed at a synchrotron to take advantage of the highly brilliant and intense incident beam.Being intrinsically element specific the detection of the X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) and XES has found many applications in the natural sciences.

        <p>However, the limited availability of measurement time and the competition for the few large scale facilities, makes it very appealing to bring the gained knowledge back to the lab. This is especially interesting for experiments on dangerous or toxic materials such as the actinides for example, which are only allowed at very few selected beamlines around the globe. Additionally, long time stability tests over weeks or even months are virtually impossible to be realised at a synchrotron.However, the limited availability of measurement time and the competition for the few large scale facilities, makes it very appealing to bring the gained knowledge back to the lab.

        <p>Assuming a stable source and stable sample, and neglecting non-linear effects, repeating and averaging several measurements is equal to a measurement with an increased intensity. Thus one can counter a lower flux by extending the measurement time when using a lab-based setup.

        <p>Conventional energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy using Silicon-Drift-Detectors (SDDs), typically referred to as X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy, is already for many years a well established lab technique for elemental analysis. In recent years the employment of wavelength-dispersive X-ray (WDX) spectrometers has become more common in laboratory setups making nowadays also high-resolution spectroscopies accessible in the lab. The main limitation are typically the photon sources available in the laboratory, as their intensity and especially their brilliance is usually several orders of magnitude less with respect to the highly brilliant synchrotron light sources.

        <p>The most accessible high-resolution spectroscopy in the laboratory is non-resonant XES. The three main reasons are 1.) one can use the entire white-light spectrum of an X-ray tube for the excitation implying that no photons are wasted by monochromatizing the incident beam, 2.) it does not require a normalisation to the energy dependent incident flux (I 0 normalisation) and 3.) it can be used to measure virtually any kind of sample, including optically thick samples.The most accessible high-resolution spectroscopy in the laboratory is non-resonant XES.

        <p>XAS experiments on the other hand, here we are focussing on XAFS (XANES and EXAFS), are typically performed in transmission to avoid spectral deformations due to self-absorption [33,131,194]. To realise a transmission XAS measurement an optically thin sample is required, where a reduction of the intensity to 1=e % 37% at the main absorption edge is considered to be optimal. For highly concentrated liquid or powder samples the transmission can in many cases be adjusted by dilution (i.e. powders are often diluted with cellulose or boron-nitride, BN). But this is not always possible, i.e. solid samples such as single crystals, and ordered or multilayered structures cannot be diluted in this way. Furthermore, one must ensure that the sample does not undergo any reaction with the diluting substance which could result in an altered sample, i.e. cellulose can be burnt in high temperature in situ experiments, and though BN has a low reactivity, several reaction paths exist with salts. And BN also reacts at high temperatures (800 °C) with water forming boron trioxide and ammonia [195].XAS experiments on the other hand, here we are focussing on XAFS (XANES and EXAFS), are typically performed in transmission to avoid spectral deformations due to self-absorption [33,131,194].

        <p>For low concentration samples (6 3% analyte) on the other hand the contrast at the absorption edge (height of the step) can be too small. For samples with a light matrix the sample thickness can be increased, but the scattering background of the matrix of lowconcentration analyte samples can reduce the signal-noise ratio (SNR) below an acceptable level. In other words, there are practical limits to increasing the thickness of such low concentration samples. Overall this means, that for transmission XAS experiments very specific sample conditions must be met.For low concentration samples (6 3% analyte) on the other hand the contrast at the absorption edge (height of the step) can be too small.

        <p>An accurate I 0 measurement and subsequent normalisation is a crucial aspect especially when X-ray tubes are used as a source. Because in contrast to synchrotron sources the intensity of X-ray tubes has an intrinsic spectral shape, leading to intensity changes by several orders of magnitude due to the characteristic lines from the anode material. In other words, whenever possible one should choose an anode material where the characteristic lines do not lie in the energy range where the measurements will be performed (region of interest, ROI). This does of course still not allow to omit the I 0 normalisation, but on the one hand this helps to avoid saturation effects of the detector (i.e. when a characteristic line of the anode lies in the ROI) and on the other hand a rather constant incident flux improves the overall quality of the measured spectrum.An accurate I 0 measurement and subsequent normalisation is a crucial aspect especially when X-ray tubes are used as a source.

        <p>Fluorescence yield (FY) detected measurements (i.e. Total Fluorescence Yield (TFY) or Partial Fluorescence Yield (PFY) using an SDD) enables to perform XAFS experiments on optically thick samples, but this requires a sufficiently intense source. Mostly because the incident beam has to be monochromatic, and the two-step process (photon-in/photon-out) with its intrinsic competition between radiative and non-radiative decays (! photon yield) further reduces the detectable intensity. However, as Honkanen et al. [191] demonstrate, with a sufficiently intense photon source, FY-XAS experiments are now becoming also accessible in the laboratory. And, though often ignored, it has been shown that FY detected spectra can differ from the real cross section measured in transmission XAS. Apart from saturation effects and self-absorption, there are also intrinsic mechanisms related to the fluorescence decay process which are altering the spectra [132]. This is why transmission XAS experiments are considered to be the most direct way to measure the real absorption.Fluorescence yield (FY) detected measurements (i.e. Total Fluorescence Yield (TFY) or Partial Fluorescence Yield (PFY) using an SDD) enables to perform XAFS experiments on optically thick samples, but this requires a sufficiently intense source.

        <p>Altogether, this makes nowadays non-resonant XES and transmission XAS experiments the most commonly performed highresolution X-ray spectroscopies using an in-house laboratory setup [134]. As already emphasised above, one major limitation is certainly the limited incident flux when compared to synchrotron sources, but also the tunability while maintaining a high intensity, and hence the lack of brilliance of in-house sources, is a relevant factor. The lack of photons is also the main reason why photonhungry experiments such as HERFD-XAS and RIXS/RXES experiments have still to be performed as large scale synchrotron facilities.Altogether, this makes nowadays non-resonant XES and transmission XAS experiments the most commonly performed highresolution X-ray spectroscopies using an in-house laboratory setup [134].

        <p>Legall et al. [197] investigate the performance of thin mosaic crystals for different spectroscopic methods and three different sources. As X-ray sources they used i) a low-power micro-focus X-ray tube with an Ag anode (iMOXS MFR; IfG GmbH), ii) the mySpot beamline at BESSY II and iii) an ultrafast laser plasma source (LPS) emitting femtosecond X-ray pulses at the Max-Born-Institut. For the detection they use 100 lm thick HAPG (Highly Annealed Pyrolytic Graphite) mosaic crystal films in the von Hamos geometry to achieve a large solid angle of acceptance. For thicker crystals they report an increase of the mosaic spread leading to an increase of the acceptance angle of the spectrometer, which is favourable in polychromatic single shot spectroscopy. They compare the EXAFS of a Ti foil measured with their lab setup to synchrotron measurements emphasising that the flux in the lab is about two orders of magnitude lower when compared to the synchrotron measurement. However, this can be an advantage when beam damage is an issue. Furthermore they compare measurements from other authors with their own and show the Kb XES spectra for a Ti foil and a TiO 2 pellet, both fitted with the underlying peak structure formed by the various contributions (e.g. Kb 5 ; Kb 1;3 ; Kb 0 ; Kb 00 ).Legall et al.

        <p>Using a full-cylinder instead of just a segment increases the solid angle and makes it a highly efficient spectrometer. It covers the energy range from 2:5 keV to 15 keV and thus allows for chemical speciation including all Kb emission lines for the 3d transition metal series. At an energy of 8 keV they report a resolving power of E=DE ¼ 2000, corresponding to a DE ¼ 4eV at 8 keV. For the measurement of the Kb multiplet spectrum they report typical acquisition times of about 10 min for bulk materials, and hours for thin samples with a thickness of less than 1 lm. This shows that the increased solid angle enables for an excellent performance and relatively short acquisition times when compared to standard Rowland circle setups.Using a full-cylinder instead of just a segment increases the solid angle and makes it a highly efficient spectrometer.

        <p>They have measured several iron Kb spectra of samples with varying thicknesses (bulk to 0:3 lm) and different acquisition times (10 min to 180 min). And they demonstrate the spectrometers ability for chemical speciation by measuring the Kb XES for several titan compounds such as Ti, TiO, Ti 2 O 3 and TiO 2 . For all measured samples the Kb 1;3 mainline appears virtually noise free, and also the Kb 2;5 can be clearly distinguished. For the TiO 2 the Kb 00 line can be observed as a high energy shoulder of the Kb 1;3 mainline. The differences between the TiO and the Ti 2 O 3 appear to be very small in the Kb 2;5 region. Note, the article from Malzer et al. [5] summarised below is basically the next generation of the Anklamm spectrometer, which provides a higher resolution by using a larger cylinder.They have measured several iron Kb spectra of samples with varying thicknesses (bulk to 0:3 lm) and different acquisition times (10 min to 180 min).

        <p>All features are distinguishable but the synchrotron data show better statistics and some spectral features are more pronounced. Furthermore they measured different concentrations of iron (pure Fe, 50% Fe, pure Fe 2 O 3 ) showing that the spectra can be well distinguished, and thus they demonstrate that their spectrometer is well suited for the determination of mass fractions of chemical species in mixtures. Nemeth et al. [199] propose a laboratory von Hamos type X-ray spectrometer as alternative to synchrotron based measurements. It allows for rapid transmission XAS experiments, but it is also capable to measure X-ray emission spectra. They use a cylindrically bent analyser crystal to build a flexible low-cost alternative with synchrotron grade S/N ratio at reasonable measurements times. The source is a water cooled X-ray tube with a copper anode operating at 10 kV and 40 mA, or 40 Watt respectively for XAS and 60 mA or 60 Watt for XES measurements. The data acquisition is realised with a position sensitive MYTHEN detector (1280 lines with 50 lm pitch), alternatively an Amptek SDD is used which shows a significantly lower resolution. The difference is clearly demonstrated with the XANES of a NiO sample for an approximate acquisition time of 2h. To test the chemical sensitivity they measured the K-edge XANES of several Ni compounds: metallic Ni foil, divalent NiO and NiCl 2 , trivalent YNiO 3 , tetravalent K 2 NiF 6 . The spectra are clearly distinguishable allowing to distinguish the oxidation states of nickel similar to synchrotron based measurements. A similar procedure is applied to a series of cobalt compounds: metallic Co foil, divalent CoO, mixed valent Co 3 O 4 and trivalent PrCoO 3 . The cobalt K-edge XANES, measured in the order of minutes to hours, allows to clearly distinguish the oxidation states of the different compounds. For both cases the differences in the oxidation state are nicely illustrated via the first derivative of the spectrum allowing a sufficient determination of the edge position. Furthermore, the Ka XES is measured for a Ni foil, and the Ka and Kb XES is recorded for a CoO sample taking 70 min for the Ka and 19h for the Kb.All features are distinguishable but the synchrotron data show better statistics and some spectral features are more pronounced. Furthermore they measured different concentrations of iron (pure Fe, 50% Fe, pure Fe 2 O 3 ) showing that the spectra can be well distinguished, and thus they demonstrate that their spectrometer is well suited for the determination of mass fractions of chemical species in mixtures. Nemeth et al. [199] propose a laboratory von Hamos type X-ray spectrometer as alternative to synchrotron based measurements. It allows for rapid transmission XAS experiments, but it is also capable to measure X-ray emission spectra. They use a cylindrically bent analyser crystal to build a flexible low-cost alternative with synchrotron grade S/N ratio at reasonable measurements times. The source is a water cooled X-ray tube with a copper anode operating at 10 kV and 40 mA, or 40 Watt respectively for XAS and 60 mA or 60 Watt for XES measurements. The data acquisition is realised with a position sensitive MYTHEN detector (1280 lines with 50 lm pitch), alternatively an Amptek SDD is used which shows a significantly lower resolution. The difference is clearly demonstrated with the XANES of a NiO sample for an approximate acquisition time of 2h. To test the chemical sensitivity they measured the K-edge XANES of several Ni compounds: metallic Ni foil, divalent NiO and NiCl 2 , trivalent YNiO 3 , tetravalent K 2 NiF 6 . The spectra are clearly distinguishable allowing to distinguish the oxidation states of nickel similar to synchrotron based measurements.

        <p>Malzer et al. [5] did high resolution Ka and Kb measurements using a Gallium-jet X-ray source and a von Hamos full cylinder optic with Highly Annealed Pyrolytic Graphite (HAPG) as a dispersive element allowing for the analysis of dilute samples. This can be considered as the next generation of the Anklamm spectrometer [113] cited above, providing a higher resolution by the employment of a larger cylinder. They cover the energy range of E % 2:3 . . . 10 keV and report a resolving power of E=DE ¼ 4000, corresponding to a resolution of DE ¼ 2 eV at an energy of E ¼ 8 keV. Their setup is specifically employed for catalysis research. They illustrate and discuss the power of this configuration by measurements of the sulphur Ka emission in FeS. The spectrum, ranging from 2295 eV to 2340 eV, took 1 h for the main lines and 5 h for the satellite lines above 2317 eV. Furthermore they illustrate the very notable improvements between the current setup and the prototype setup they have used earlier, by comparing spectra of the copper Ka and iron Kb multiplet including the satellites in FeS for both setups. Emphasising the relevance of the sample characteristics on XES resolution, they compare the Ka 1;2 lines for thick and thin iron samples, Fe 2 O 3 and Fe(TPP), which is of particular interest for dilute and low weight-percent (wt%) samples as they appear in catalysis. A notable difference between thick and thin samples is that with thin samples one can achieve the highest possible resolution, while this of course reduces the count rates. A pure Fe 2 O 3 sample reaches 2 Á 10 6 counts per second at the Ka 1 , compared to the dilute iron oxide the count rates are one order of magnitude below that. In other words, going from thick to thin samples reduces the intensity by one order of magnitude. And going from the Ka 1 to the Kb main emission line they predict a reduction of three orders of magnitude. Overall their approach looks very promising, as the high sensitivity allows for measurements on dilute samples with typical acquisition times of 5 to 10 hours.Malzer et al.

        <p>Taguchi et al. [200] describe the improvements of a Rowland circle lab spectrometer to measure the K-edge of low Z elements (Z 20), such as calcium (Ca), potassium (K), aluminium (Al) and sulphur (S). They achieve this by replacing the path in air, by vacuum or helium which significantly increases the number of photons reaching the detector. Helium makes Ca K-edge (4038 eV) measurements fairly easy they report, but K K-edge (3607 eV) remains difficult. Hence, they set the limit for laboratory measurements to Ti under air, and to Ca when the beam path is under helium. They find, to be able to measure the K-edges of Al (1559 eV) or Si (1838 eV), the entire beam path, including the sample and detector must be put in vacuum.Taguchi et al.

        <p>They claim to do a critical evaluation of the setup via Co Kb XES measurements of Co 3 O 4 and LiCoO 2 reporting peak count rates of approximately 5000cts/s for concentrated samples for the Kb 1;3 emission with a reproducibility of the measurements within 25 meV or better. They are advertising the instrument for the determination of the spin and oxidation state using Kb 1;3 XES, though energy shifts due to different sample positions can hinder an exact analysis. Also the VtC-XES (Kb 00 and Kb 2;5 ) appears in good agreement for these systems with a high Co concentration. Perhaps one of the most surprising claims is that the low distance to the Xray tube source would allow excitation with count rates between those possible for a monochromatised bending magnet and an insertion device. Instead of placing source and sample exactly on the Rowland circle a slit is placed on the Rowland circle, and the source and sample are moved around 10 mm behind the slit. Two reasons are given for that, one being that the slit enables to tune the energy resolution by adjusting the slit's aperture, and the other is that a slit is easier to position exactly compared to placing the source and sample at the exact position on the Rowland circle. In spite of this reasoning EasyXAFS delivers their spectrometers without adjustable slits. Instead, in XAS mode just the tube's and detector's aperture (d % 10 mm) are used as 'slits'. For XES measurements three slits for the source end with fixed apertures of 0:5 mm; 1 mm and 2 mm are supplied.They claim to do a critical evaluation of the setup via Co Kb XES measurements of Co 3 O 4 and LiCoO 2 reporting peak count rates of approximately 5000cts/s for concentrated samples for the Kb 1;3 emission with a reproducibility of the measurements within 25 meV or better.

        <p>Limandri et al. [206] did a chemical study and quantitative analysis based on high-resolution Mn Kb XES measurements using a Johann type lab spectrometer with a Si(110) crystal (in 440 reflection) with a Rowland circle r ¼ 41 cm and an X-ray tube with a cobalt (Co) anode running at U ¼ 37 kV and I ¼ 40 mA (P ¼ 1480 Watt). The reported energy resolution near backscattering at h B % 84 is given as DE ¼ 2 eV at the Mn Kb 1;3 main line (E % 6490 eV), translating to a resolving power of E=DE ¼ 3245. They measured the Mn Kb main line and the satellites (Kb 00 ; Kb 2;5 ) where the satellites shape in nicely resolved and used for a subsequent analysis. The complete setup (sample, analyzer and detector is enclosed in an evacuated chamber, confirming that under these conditions even the weak satellites can be studied without the need for a synchrotron light source. Especially the combination of a high powered source and enclosing the setup in an evacuated environment appears to be the key for such an experimental success using an in-house setup.Limandri et al.

        <p>Anwar et al. [207] used a laboratory femtosecond Laser Plasma X-ray Source (fs-LPXS) to perform ultrafast IR pump/X-ray probe experiments in the laboratory. The measurement was performed in transmission mode using a Ti:Sapphire laser with a wavelength of k ¼ 800 nm, a repetition rate of f ¼ 1 kHz, and a pulse length of t ¼ 50 fs with each pulse having 5-8 mJ hitting a copper (Cu) target to create Bremstrahlung which is then acting as the X-ray source. The transmitted beam is dispersed using a highly annealed pyrolytic graphite (HAPG) being then sent to either an energy-dispersive X-ray PIN detector (AMPTEK, XR100CR or an X-ray CCD camera). The setup is described in more detail in a publication by Iqbal et al. [216]. They measured the Fe K-edge XANES of a magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) film observing a 12 eV shift upon IR excitation attributing the shift to charge transfer effects between the Fe ions. The spectral shapes are noisy but the shift can be clearly observed. Especially for fs time-resolved XANES measurements laboratory setups are very appealing because the experiments are often difficult to perform at the synchrotron (synchrotron slicing [217][218][219][220][221][222]) and the limited time to execute the measurements is often a crucial factor in femtosecond synchrotron measurements.Anwar et al.

        <p>Catalysis and materials chemistry are cross-cutting disciplines that plays a pivotal role in the chemical and energy conversion industries. Indeed, at least one catalytic step is involved in the production of more than 85% of the chemical products [223,224]. Key global challenges such as increasing the sustainability of the chemical industry and energy sector rely heavily on the development of innovative processes that produce less toxic (side) products and utilise, convert or store renewable energy. As a consequence, considerable efforts are currently undertaken to develop novel, more effective catalytic or electro-catalytic processes, providing a key step for cleaner and more sustainable economies. Prominent examples of current developments are the catalytic conversion of CO 2 into value-added chemicals or fuels (such as methanol synthesis or the dry reforming of methane), the production of olefins and aromatics from a synthesis gas (Fischer-Tropsch), alkane dehydrogenation, methane oxidation (partial oxidation of methane to syngas or methanol) and the electrochemical production of H 2 , to name a few [225]. A key step towards the development of more effective (electro-) catalysts is an in-depth understanding of the relationship between a catalysts structure and its activity to avoid a cumbersome trial and error approach for their improvement.Catalysis and materials chemistry are cross-cutting disciplines that plays a pivotal role in the chemical and energy conversion industries.

        <p>To formulate such structure-function relationships, the identification and characterisation of a catalyst's active sites (and deactivation pathways) is critical, allowing in turn the possibility to design more effective catalytic materials yielding higher activities and selectivities towards the desired product(s). However, the role of the individual features of typically multi-component industrial catalysts remains elusive, mainly due to their intrinsic complexity and difficulties in determining in detail their structure and electronic properties under operating conditions.To formulate such structure-function relationships, the identification and characterisation of a catalyst's active sites (and deactivation pathways) is critical, allowing in turn the possibility to design more effective catalytic materials yielding higher activities and selectivities towards the desired product(s).

        <p>Heterogeneous (electro-) catalysts are complex and dynamic systems, typically composed of different phases and sites that exhibit different functionalities. A catalyst's structure can thereby range from crystalline, nano-crystalline and amorphous phases to single sites. Yet, all of these structural features are susceptible to undergo changes during reaction (and activation) [226]. To characterise such complex and dynamic systems, X-ray absorption spectroscopy has been shown to be a very valuable tool since it provides element-specific information of the local structure, geometry and oxidation state of a target element. Specifically, using EXAFS analysis the atomic structure within the range of approximately 1-6 Å can be probed allowing inter-atomic distances, coordination number, and identity of neighbour species around the absorbing atom to be determined. XANES analysis provides information on the oxidation state and coordination geometry of the species probed [2]. Hence, XAS can shed light on both active or spectator species, as well as the support or promoters that are present in a multi-component catalytic material. Moreover, XAS can provide information on the local structure of a target element in a crystalline material with intrinsic local disorder.Heterogeneous (electro-) catalysts are complex and dynamic systems, typically composed of different phases and sites that exhibit different functionalities.

        <p>An excellent illustration of lab-based XAS experimentation has been the characterisation of iron-based zeolites (Fe-TNU-9, Fe-TNU-10, and Fe-IM-5), containing both Fe and Al in framework positions and their steam-activated forms as catalysts for N 2 O decomposition [238]. For comparison an isomorphously substituted Fe-ZSM-5 with a similar Fe content was also studied. The goal of this work was to examine the effect of the structure of the zeolite on the nature and distribution of extra-framework iron species and in turn on their N 2 O decomposition activity. The specific activity (per mole of iron) was found to follow the following order: Fe-TNU-10 &lt; Fe-IM-5 &lt; Fe-TNU-9 &lt; Fe-ZSM-5. A combination of extra-framework Fe and Al species has been proposed to be the active sites for N 2 O decomposition. In addition, steam activation is required to obtain a highly homogeneous distribution of oxidic iron species upon Fe extraction from the zeolite framework, giving steam-activated iron zeolites. Lee et al. [238] were able to perform EXAFS analysis at the Fe K-edge (range of 2.0-12 Å) of the as synthesised materials and after steam activation at a relatively low iron loading (1.3-1.7 wt% Fe) using a laboratory XAS instrument (Rigaku, R-XAS Looper) in transmission mode. The EXAFS data of steam-activated zeolites revealed that the degree of extraction of framework Fe atoms depends on the structure type of the zeolites (Fig. 15).An excellent illustration of lab-based XAS experimentation has been the characterisation of iron-based zeolites (Fe-TNU-9, Fe-TNU-10, and Fe-IM-5), containing both Fe and Al in framework positions and their steam-activated forms as catalysts for N 2 O decomposition [238].

        <p>As-synthesised zeolites, made by a hydrothermal synthesis, exhibit Fe in the framework. After steam activation, the relative intensity of the Fe-O peak at R ¼ 2:0 Å, due to framework Fe atoms, in the Fourier transform becomes higher in the order Fe-TNU-9 (Fe-ZSM-5 $ Fe-IM-5 &lt; Fe-TNU-10. These EXAFS results were correlated with the poor N 2 O decomposition activity of Fe-TNU-10, since Fe atoms in the zeolite framework are not catalytically active for this reaction. The results were also compared with Fe-TNU-9 and Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by a sublimation method, showing the presence of Fe 2 O 3 particles in the as prepared material. For this class of materials, steam treatment resulted in the further sintering of Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles, which correlates well with the lower activity of the materials prepared by the sublimation method. In line with these observations, TEM showed that the materials prepared by sublimation were characterised by larger particles that are inactive for N 2 O decomposition. Combining the result of EXAFS modelling with TEM, UV-vis spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance, which provided further evidence of the Fe species and their dispersion, allowed the authors to con-clude that the zeolite structure determines the nature and distribution of extra-framework iron species formed during the calcination and steaming steps, controlling in turn the N 2 O decomposition activity of the material.As-synthesised zeolites, made by a hydrothermal synthesis, exhibit Fe in the framework.

        <p>Another study that highlights the usefulness of lab-based XAS was reported by Yamamoto and co-workers. The study focused on elucidating the structure of tungsten oxide, supported on zirconium oxide doped with yttrium-or ytterbium (WO x /Y(Yb)-ZrO 2 ), to investigate the mechanism responsible for the strong solid acidity in these materials [233]. To probe the effect of the quantity of dopant added, on the crystalline phases, acidity and the type of tungsten species, WO x /Y(Yb)-ZrO 2 materials with varying concentrations of Y or Yb (xY(Yb)-ZrO 2 ; x ¼ 0 À 40) while maintaining the tungsten loading (15 wt% WO 3 ) were prepared. The materials were probed for catalytic reactions that require strong acidic catalysts, namely n-butane skeletal isomerisation, alkylation of anisole with benzyl alcohol and 2-butanol decomposition. Structural insight into the catalysts was obtained using XANES (W L 1 -edge) and EXAFS (W L 3 -edge and Yb L 3 -edge) complemented by XRD and UV-vis. XRD showed an increasing fraction of the tetragonal zirconia phase with increasing Y (Yb) doping. Assessment of the local environment around Yb by EXAFS confirmed the incorporation of Yb into the tetragonal ZrO 2 lattice forming a substitutional solid solution. W L 1 -edge XANES and pre-edge analysis indicated that the tungsten species in the samples were in a distorted WO 6 octahedral geometry and a quantitative component analysis of the (W L 3 -edge) EXAFS spectra by a least-squares method allowed to determine the relative amounts of tree different tungsten species depending on the Y (or Yb) loading: WO 3 -like species, Y 2 (WO 4 ) 3 and Y 2 WO 6 .The EXAFS results (Fig. 16) showed that the fraction of WO 3 -like species was $ 70% in WO x /4Y-ZrO 2 , which was the most active catalyst.Another study that highlights the usefulness of lab-based XAS was reported by Yamamoto and co-workers.

To probe the effect of the quantity of dopant added, on the crystalline phases, acidity and the type of tungsten species, WO x /Y(Yb)-ZrO 2 materials with varying concentrations of Y or Yb (xY(Yb)-ZrO 2 ; x ¼ 0 À 40) while maintaining the tungsten loading (15 wt% WO 3 ) were prepared. The materials were probed for catalytic reactions that require strong acidic catalysts, namely n-butane skeletal isomerisation, alkylation of anisole with benzyl alcohol and 2-butanol decomposition. Structural insight into the catalysts was obtained using XANES (W L 1 -edge) and EXAFS (W L 3 -edge and Yb L 3 -edge) complemented by XRD and UV-vis. XRD showed an increasing fraction of the tetragonal zirconia phase with increasing Y (Yb) doping. Assessment of the local environment around Yb by EXAFS confirmed the incorporation of Yb into the tetragonal ZrO 2 lattice forming a substitutional solid solution.

        <p>The combination of EXAFS, XRD and UV-vis allowed for the following conclusions to be drawn: i) monoclinic ZrO 2 with Y (Yb)-doping of less than 2 mol% led to large WO 3 particles. ii) Y (Yb) stabilised tetragonal zirconia effectively stabilised small clusters of WO 3 and provided strong acidity which is critical to effectively catalyse reactions that require strong acidic catalysts, such as alkane skeletal isomerisation and the Friedel-Crafts alkylation and iii) inactive mixed oxides ((WO 4 ) 3 and Y 2 WO 6 ) were formed when the Y (Yb) doping level exceeded 10 mol%.The combination of EXAFS, XRD and UV-vis allowed for the following conclusions to be drawn: i) monoclinic ZrO 2 with Y (Yb)-doping of less than 2 mol% led to large WO 3 particles. ii) Y (Yb) stabilised tetragonal zirconia effectively stabilised small clusters of WO 3 and provided strong acidity which is critical to effectively catalyse reactions that require strong acidic catalysts, such as alkane skeletal isomerisation and the Friedel-Crafts alkylation and iii) inactive mixed oxides ((WO 4 ) 3 and Y 2 WO 6 ) were formed when the Y (Yb) doping level exceeded 10 mol%.</p>
        <p>More recently, lab-based XAS has been extended to in situ studies [208,209,246]. As already mentioned above, Moya-Cancino et al. described the development of an in situ setup based on a laboratory based X-ray spectrometer, and demonstrated its application for the study of an industrial Co/TiO 2 based catalysts for Fischer-Tropsch (FTS) at 523 K and 5 bar for 200 h time on stream using a quartz capillary plug-flow reactor [208]. Analysis of the acquired in situ Co K-edge XANES data by linear combination fitting (using reference spectra) indicated that cobalt is maintained in its metallic form under reactive conditions. Only a very small fraction of inactive CoTiO 3 phase was detected under FTS conditions. This observation allowed to rule out the oxidation of cobalt as the main deactivation pathway. The XANES spectra collected in the laboratory set-up were validated by comparison with results obtained using synchrotron radiation XANES (BM26 beamline, ESRF). However, the lower signal-to-noise ratio obtain in the laboratory experiment (when compared to the synchrotron data) limited the timeresolution to 7:8 h per averaged spectra (Fig. 17). The poorer signal to noise ratio that is achieved using lab-based XAS instruments means that dynamic features of catalyst restructuring may be better assessed by performing experiments at synchrotron based facilities. However, long-term stability tests of catalysts may readily be explored using laboratory-based equipment, providing the concentration of the photo-absorber is sufficiently high.More recently, lab-based XAS has been extended to in situ studies [208,209,246].

        <p>A follow-up work by Moya-Cancino et al., based on the same setup as described above, studied the Co K-edge spectrum of cobalt carbide (Co 2 C) during the in situ carburisation of pure metallic cobalt and by applying a non-negative matrix factorisation (NNMF) method [209]. The spectrum of pure Co 2 C was further corroborated by theoretical calculations. The applied methodology allowed to provide the reference spectrum of the elusive cobalt carbide phase formed under in situ FTS conditions. Overall, this work contributes to the further understanding of the role of cobalt carbides in FTS that remains highly debated. Moreover, these studies demonstrate the usefulness of the laboratory based XAS experiments to study catalysts at relevant conditions.A follow-up work by Moya-Cancino et al., based on the same setup as described above, studied the Co K-edge spectrum of cobalt carbide (Co 2 C) during the in situ carburisation of pure metallic cobalt and by applying a non-negative matrix factorisation (NNMF) method [209].

        <p>XES studies, which can be carried out as well in laboratorybased instruments, can provide information about speciation and coordination chemistry that is complementary to XAS [202,192,5,247,159,2]. An example of such application, published by Holden et al. [192], is the determination of the sulphur speciation in biochars. The distribution of the oxidation states of sulphur (S) in different biochar samples was performed by fitting XES spectra using two Ka 1;2 doublet components (each doublet is composed of Ka 1 and Ka 2 with a fixed intensity ratio) representing two oxidation states (Fig. 18).XES studies, which can be carried out as well in laboratorybased instruments, can provide information about speciation and coordination chemistry that is complementary to XAS [202,192,5,247,159,2].

        <p>One of the fitted components of the XES spectra has a Ka 1 at 2309:15 eV and represents sulphate species; the second sulphur component has a Ka 1 at 2307:97 eV and represents sulphur (S) with a lower oxidation state (attributed to both organic and sulphidic species). Using this approach the distribution of the oxidation states of sulphur in the different biochar samples was quantified. The results were validated by comparison with sulphur (S) K-edge XANES data (previously acquired at beamline 4-3 of the 18. Ka XES spectra obtained from four different biochar samples and linear combination fits to determine the sulphur speciation of the biochar samples. The lower energy doublet component represents S with a lower oxidation state (both organic and sulphidic species) and the higher energy doublet represents sulphur in a higher oxidation state (sulphate).

        <p>The studies described in this section showcase the potential of laboratory-based XAS and XES instrumentation for characterisation in material chemistry, catalysts and environmental science. The potential applications are much broader than the examples covered in this review. Presumably due to the limited number of laboratory-based equipment, the number of studies are limited, but they are expected to growth with the increasing number of available instrumentation and a continuous improvements of their capabilities. A general limitation of laboratory-based equipment is the relatively low signal to noise ratio which has to be compensated by long acquisition times. This limits to some extent the study of very low concentration samples. Nonetheless it is important to remark that the use of low X-ray doses can also be an advantage for samples that are very prone to radiation damage. Moreover, recent developments have shown the usefulness of these instruments for in situ studies of processes that occur over a longer timescale (for instance the structural evolution of catalysts that occurs over days or weeks). Importantly, laboratorybased spectrometers will not replace synchrotron studies, but they can complement them, allowing for better sample screening and, thus, leading to an optimisation of the relatively scarce beamtime at synchrotrons. This is a key aspect since in many cases there are no other available techniques to characterise certain materials aspect (for instance doping) and an efficient use of synchrotron time will profit enormously by a thorough preliminary assessment of the samples under study in readily available laboratory-based instrumentation. Further advances in the field of laboratory based XAS and XES may include the integration of more powerful X-ray sources and the implementation of highly efficient detectors, which can lead to a reduction of the acquisition times.The studies described in this section showcase the potential of laboratory-based XAS and XES instrumentation for characterisation in material chemistry, catalysts and environmental science.

        <p>Various laboratory setups exist already which are employed for in-house XAS and non-resonant XES experiments. Transmission XAS experiments are for a broad range of systems feasible in the lab as long as their optical thickness fulfils the requirements. Non-resonant XES experiments are possible even on optically thick samples and they are already widely used for complementary experimental studies. The relatively low costs of laboratory setups and the broad range of possible applications makes them an useful alternative to synchrotron experiments. Either as preliminary study to strengthen an application for measurement time at a synchrotron, or even for full research quality studies. Also worth to mention in the fact that laboratory setups are a very nice teaching instrument, i.e. to explain students the methodology.Various laboratory setups exist already which are employed for in-house XAS and non-resonant XES experiments.

        <p>Standard XAS and XES measurements on reference compounds and model systems under ex-situ conditions can routinely be realised in the laboratory [249]. Though limited to larger time-scales, the most recent developments prove that also experiments under in situ and operando conditions can now be realised in the laboratory [208]. This will be especially useful in the field of chemistry and catalysis, but laboratory X-ray spectroscopy can be expected to soon cover a broad range of fields, similar to the ones mentioned in the introduction. The applications are often limited to certain types of samples and sufficiently powerful sources are needed to deliver the required flux to perform the experiments with reasonable acquisition times and acceptable SNR. Measurements on samples with an analyte fraction down to approximately 3 wt% can now be routinely realised in the laboratory. Highly diluted samples with a small analyte fraction ( 3 wt%) make in-house experiments still challenging, but with a sufficiently stable source these difficulties can to some degree be overcome by longer acquisition times. Low analyte concentrations in a heavy matrix, however, typically require a fluorescence yield approach, which was until recently only possible at the synchrotron. But the recent developments and the employment of high-power X-ray tubes show that also in-house fluorescence yield experiments are becoming feasible now [191]. This also illustrates that the limiting factor is in most cases the source of X-rays, as typical in-house sources cannot offer the unique capabilities such as the tunability while maintaining high intensities as they are available at a synchrotron.Standard XAS and XES measurements on reference compounds and model systems under ex-situ conditions can routinely be realised in the laboratory [249].

        <p>Considering sources covering the soft and hard X-ray energy range, the employment of high intensity laser plasma sources, the new micro-structured anode materials for better heat-dissipation, and the Line Focus X-ray Tubes appear to be among of the most promising developments regarding X-ray sources. In particular the improvements in modern laser plasma sources suggest that for example spin-state studies using time-resolved XES can soon be realised routinely in the laboratory [76]. Further, the interesting development of a compact light source by Lyncean could fill the gap between X-ray tubes and large scale synchrotrons [67].Considering sources covering the soft and hard X-ray energy range, the employment of high intensity laser plasma sources, the new micro-structured anode materials for better heat-dissipation, and the Line Focus X-ray Tubes appear to be among of the most promising developments regarding X-ray sources.

        <p>However, the very photon-hungry techniques such as high energy fluorescence detected (HERFD) XAS, resonant XES and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) appear to be still beyond the practical limits of in-house experiments and therefore still have to be performed at a synchrotron offering the highest brilliances. Although, to be optimistic, with modern detectors such as a Transition Edge Sensor (TES) [250,251] some systems with a large photon-yield and sufficient stability could in principle be measured in the laboratory if a sufficiently efficient source is available and long acquisition times can be accepted.However, the very photon-hungry techniques such as high energy fluorescence detected (HERFD) XAS, resonant XES and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) appear to be still beyond the practical limits of in-house experiments and therefore still have to be performed at a synchrotron offering the highest brilliances.

        <p>Altogether we conclude that in the next years an increased number of X-ray experiments will be moving back into the laboratory, as in-house X-ray instruments are for certain applications indeed a valuable alternative to measurements at large scale synchrotrons.Altogether we conclude that in the next years an increased number of X-ray experiments will be moving back into the laboratory, as in-house X-ray instruments are for certain applications indeed a valuable alternative to measurements at large scale synchrotrons.</p>
