        <p>In this paper I summarize some of the many factors that could easily contribute 1-3 kcal mol À1 errors at 298 K: three-body dispersion effects, molecular symmetry, anharmonicity, spurious imaginary frequencies, insufficient conformational sampling, wrong or changing ionization states, errors in the solvation free energy of ions, and explicit solvent (and ion) effects that are not well-represented by continuum models. While I focus on binding free energies in aqueous solution the approach also applies (with minor adjustments) to any free energy difference such as conformational or reaction free energy differences or activation free energies in any solvent.In this paper I summarize some of the many factors that could easily contribute 1-3 kcal mol À1 errors at 298 K: three-body dispersion effects, molecular symmetry, anharmonicity, spurious imaginary frequencies, insufficient conformational sampling, wrong or changing ionization states, errors in the solvation free energy of ions, and explicit solvent (and ion) effects that are not well-represented by continuum models.

        <p>The prediction of accurate absolute binding energies in aqueous solution is one of the holy grails of computational chemistry, mainly because of the potential use in rational drug design. ''Accurate'' is typically taken to be 1 kcal mol À1 , which roughly corresponds to predicting the binding constant within an order of magnitude at room temperature and it is understood that the method must be generally applicable. The recent blind prediction challenge 
            <rs type="software">SAMPL</rs>4 has shown that this goal has yet to be met even for host-guest complexes that are significantly smaller than proteins. 1 Interestingly, the entry that arguably performed best for one of the hosts (curcurbit [7]uril or CB7) was, for the first time, based on the rigid rotor-harmonic oscillator (RRHO) approximation and electronic structure theory and involved no direct parameterization against experimental binding free energies. 2 This method reproduced 14 experimental CB7-guest binding free energies with a mean absolute deviation of 2.02 AE 0.46 kcal mol À1 suggesting that, perhaps, the holy grail is within reach. However, the mean absolute error was significantly larger for another hostguest system indicating that there remains some work to be done.

        <p>One of the reasons electronic structure-based approaches are starting to yield accurate binding free energies is the use of dispersion corrections 3 in the evaluation of the electronic energy and the structure (as well as the vibrational frequencies as discussed below). Grimme 4 has shown that dispersion typically makes a very big (410 kcal mol À1 ) contribution to binding free energies of host-guest complexes. Dispersion corrections are therefore a must if DFT is used to compute the electronic binding energy. Furthermore, Grimme has shown that three-body dispersion makes a non-negligible (2-3 kcal mol À1 ) contribution to the electronic binding energy. For convergent methods this effect is only included in rather expensive methods that involve tripleexcitations such as MP4 and CCSD(T).One of the reasons electronic structure-based approaches are starting to yield accurate binding free energies is the use of dispersion corrections 3 in the evaluation of the electronic energy and the structure (as well as the vibrational frequencies as discussed below).

        <p>Interestingly, it has been found that dispersion corrected, and short-range corrected, semiempirical methods such as DFTB or PM6, yield binding energies with accuracies similar to conventional DFT calculations with large basis sets. For example, Muddana and Gilson 5 used PM6-DH+ to compute reasonably accurate relative binding energies for CB7-ligand complexes. On the other hand, Yilmazer and Korth 6 found significant deviations for PM6-DH+ and similar methods when applied to larger protein-ligand models. Whether these minimal basis set-based methods are sufficiently flexible to handle large many-body polarization effects involving many charged groups remains to be determined. In any case, Grimme and co-workers have computed E gas (X) at the PW6B95-D3(BJ)/def2-QZVP// TPSS27-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP level of theory with good results. 2Interestingly, it has been found that dispersion corrected, and short-range corrected, semiempirical methods such as DFTB or PM6, yield binding energies with accuracies similar to conventional DFT calculations with large basis sets.

        <p>The translational, rotational and vibrational thermodynamic contribution to the binding free energy is very large (410 kcal mol À1 ) and must be included for accurate results. Some years ago there was a bit of confusion in the literature about whether the RRHO approach was appropriate for condensed phase systems, but Zhou and Gilson 7 have clarified this beautifully. The accuracy of the dispersion and hydrogen bond-corrected semi-empirical methods mentioned above has now made it feasible to compute the vibrational frequencies for typical host-guest complexes and this is another reason why electronic structure-based approaches are starting to yield accurate binding free energies.

        <p>In the absence of theoretical benchmarks, comparison to experiment can prove constructive. Kjaergaard and co-workers 9,10 have recently measured standard binding free energies for small gas phase compounds and compared them to CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(T+d) calculations. For example, in the case of acetronitrile-HCl the measured binding free energy at 295 K is between 1.2 and 1.9 kcal mol À1 , while the predicted value is 1.9 kcal mol À1 using the harmonic approximation. 10 Since the errors in DE and the rigid-rotor approximation presumably are quite low, this suggest an error in the vibrational free energy of at most 0.7 kcal mol À1 , despite the fact that the lowest vibrational frequency is only about 30 cm À1 . Furthermore, the error can be reduced by 0.4 kcal mol À1 by scaling the harmonic frequencies by anharmonic scaling factors suggested by Shields and co-workers. 11,12 Similar results were found for dimethylsulfide-HCl. 9 So there are some indications that the harmonic approximation yields free energy corrections that are reasonable and possibly can be improved upon by relatively minor corrections.In the absence of theoretical benchmarks, comparison to experiment can prove constructive.

        <p>On the other hand in a recent study Piccini and Sauer 13 show that anharmonic effects need to be included to obtain agreement with the experimental binding free energy of methane to H-CHA zeolite. Specifically, they compute the vibrational binding free energy by computing the 1-dimensional potential energy surface for each low frequency mode and compute the vibrational energy levels and corresponding partition function numerically (as opposed to using the anharmonic fundamental frequency together with the harmonic oscillator partition function). This decreases the binding free energy by 2.5 kcal mol À1 compared to the standard harmonic oscillator treatment.On the other hand in a recent study Piccini and Sauer 13 show that anharmonic effects need to be included to obtain agreement with the experimental binding free energy of methane to H-CHA zeolite.

        <p>Low frequencies are especially susceptible to numerical error and it is not unusual to see 1 or 2 imaginary frequencies of low magnitude in a vibrational analysis of a host-guest complex. Since imaginary frequencies are excluded from the vibrational free energy this effectively removes 1 or 2 low frequency contributions to the vibrational free energy.

        <p>Imaginary frequencies resulting from a flat PES and numerical errors can often be removed by making the convergence criteria for the geometry optimization and electronic energy minimization more stringent and making the grid size finer in the case of DFT calculations.

If all else fails, it is probably better to pretend that the imaginary frequency is real and add the corresponding vibrational free energy contribution.

        <p>One of the main problems in computing accurate binding free energies is to identify the structures of the host, guest and (especially) the host-guest complex with the lowest free energy. Because both the RRHO and solvation energy contributions contribute greatly to the binding free energy change, simply finding the structure with the lowest electronic energy and computing the free energy only for that conformation is unlikely to result in the global free energy minimum.One of the main problems in computing accurate binding free energies is to identify the structures of the host, guest and (especially) the host-guest complex with the lowest free energy.

This may well be necessary for binding free energy calculations as well, in which case the effect of the constraints on the vibrational frequencies must be accounted for. 47 Alternatively, only the Hessian of the un-constrained region can be computed. 48 So while there is some code-adjustment to be done it may well be that the promising developments in electronic structurebased prediction of aqueous binding free energies may also be brought to bear on drug design within the next few years.Most QM/MM studies of enzyme catalysis constrain the geometry of a significant portion of the system to avoid spurious structural fluctuation far away from the active site contributing to the barrier.

        <p>Recent predictions of absolute binding free energies of hostguest complexes in aqueous solution using electronic structure theory have been encouraging for some systems. It is interesting to consider the underlying innovations that have lead to the recent increase in accuracy in predicted binding free energies. Advances in computer hardware and coupled cluster algorithms made it possible to construct benchmark sets of accurate electronic binding energies for a diverse set of molecules. These benchmarks sets were then used to develop the dispersion corrections needed for accurate DFT-based electronic binding energies and the short-range (hydrogen bond) corrections to the semi-empirical methods needed to compute accurate vibrational frequencies for the RRHO free energy corrections. In fact methods like HF-3c, 49 while containing empirical corrections, was developed without reference to any experimental data. Another interesting observation is that the dispersion and RRHO free energy contributions to the binding free energy have roughly the same magnitude, but opposite signs. So including just one of the corrections is likely to significantly increase the error relative to experiment and lead to the wrong conclusions regarding their importance.Recent predictions of absolute binding free energies of hostguest complexes in aqueous solution using electronic structure theory have been encouraging for some systems.

        <p>While there have been reasonably accurate predictions for some host-guest systems, other systems remain problematic. In this paper I summarize some of the many factors that could easily contribute 1-3 kcal mol À1 at 298 K: three-body dispersion effects, molecular symmetry, anharmonicity, spurious imaginary frequencies, insufficient conformational sampling, wrong or changing ionization states, errors in the solvation free energy of ions, and explicit solvent (and ion) effects that are not wellrepresented by continuum models.While there have been reasonably accurate predictions for some host-guest systems, other systems remain problematic.

        <p>While I focus on binding free energies in aqueous solution it is worth noting that the approach also applies to any free energy difference in solution, such as conformational and reaction free energy differences or activation free energies. Furthermore, the equations apply to solvents other than water as long as the concentration of liquid water, the solvation free energy of the proton changed, and the parameterization of the continuum solvation model is changed to match the solvent of interest. Furthermore, while the recent successes with electronic structurebased approaches have been for host-guest complexes they can be extended to protein-ligand complexes with a few methodological improvements (mainly related to the computation of vibrational frequencies). Thus, it may well be that the promising developments in electronic structure-based prediction of aqueous binding free energies may also be brought to bear on drug design within the next few years.While I focus on binding free energies in aqueous solution it is worth noting that the approach also applies to any free energy difference in solution, such as conformational and reaction free energy differences or activation free energies.
