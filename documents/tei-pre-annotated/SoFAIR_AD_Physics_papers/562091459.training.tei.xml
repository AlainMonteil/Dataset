        <p>T he X-ray spectrum of black hole binaries can be decomposed into three main radiation components. The first is a thermal component that dominates the emission at low (soft) energies 1 , below ~5 keV, due to an accretion disk through which mass flows from the binary companion to the black hole. The second is a power-law like component that dominates the spectrum at energies above ~5-10 keV, caused by inverse Compton scattering of the disk photons in a corona of highly energetic electrons 2 . If the energy distribution of the electrons is Maxwellian, this component features a high-energy cut-off at an energy that depends on the electron temperature of the corona, kT e . The third is a broad emission line at ~6.5-7 keV due to iron, produced when photons from the corona reflect off the disk, with the line profile being set by special and general relativistic effects 3,4 . The X-ray emission of accreting black hole binaries exhibits high-amplitude variability from tens of milliseconds to decades 5,6 . Depending on the relative importance of these spectral components and the strength of the variability, accreting black holes display different states 7 . In the hard states the X-ray spectrum (~1-20 keV range) is dominated by emission from the corona, and the Fourier power spectrum shows variability of up to 50% of the average luminosity over a broad range of timescales plus narrow quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). In the soft states the emission is dominated by the accretion disk, and the variability drops to less than 5% of the average luminosity.T he X-ray spectrum of black hole binaries can be decomposed into three main radiation components.

        <p>Black hole binaries in the hard states emit in the infrared 8 and radio 9 wavelengths with a spectrum that is consistent with self-absorbed synchrotron radiation from an optically thick and compact jet 10 . During the transition from the hard to the soft states, some black hole binaries show radio emission from individual, spatially resolved, plasma clouds that are ejected in a jet at speeds close to the speed of light. The radio spectrum of these discrete ejections is consistent with synchrotron emission from optically thin material 11 . GRS 1915+105 (ref. 12 ) harbours a + -solar mass black hole 13 and is very variable both in X-rays and radio wavelengths 6,14 . In X-rays, the emission switches from times in which a bright accretion disk with a temperature of kT bb ≈ 2 keV and a small inner radius dominates the spectrum, to times in which the corona dominates the spectrum, the disk is relatively cool, kT bb ≈ 0.5-1 keV and the disk is inferred to have a large inner radius 15 . In several observations, mostly those with a cool disk, in addition to a band-limited noise component, a narrow and strong QPO (called type-C QPO 16 ) appears in the Fourier power spectrum at frequencies between ~0.4 Hz and 6.5 Hz (ref. 17 ). The frequency of the QPO increases as the temperature of the disk increases and the spectrum of the source softens. Besides this QPO (and harmonics and sub-harmonics of the fundamental frequency), the power spectrum of GRS 1915+105 sometimes shows a broad variability component at ~60-80 Hz (ref. 18 ) that we will call the high-frequency bump. The high-frequency bump appears when the spectrum of the source is dominated by the corona, but observations in which the corona dominates the emission do not always show this bump. At the same time, observations of GRS 1915+105 in which the spectrum is dominated by the corona are sometimes, but not always, accompanied by high radio fluxes 19,20 .

        <p>In Fig. 1 we plot the X-ray hardness ratio as a function of the frequency of the QPO for these 410 observations of GRS 1915+105. The x and y axes of the four panels in this figure are the same, whereas the colours of the points in each panel represent, respectively, the simultaneous 15 GHz radio flux measurements from the jet (Fig. 1a), the electron temperature of the X-ray corona (Fig. 1b), the flux of the iron emission line in the X-ray spectrum (Fig. 1c) and the fractional r.m.s. amplitude of the high-frequency bump (Fig. 1d). The QPO frequency generally increases as the hardness ratio decreases and the source spectrum softens, consistent with a decreasing inner radius of the accretion disk that leads to an increase in both the disk flux 1 and the QPO frequency 21,22 . The relation, however, is strongly broader than the spread expected from the errors in each quantity.

As the source moves from the top of the flatter correlation to the point where the two correlations cross each other, and then from the bottom to the top of the steeper correlation, the QPO frequency decreases steadily from ~6 Hz to ~0.5 Hz.

        <p>These results provide evidence of a change in the geometry of the corona, and offer a unique clue to understand the nature of the corona and the jet in this object and the nature of the source that powers these components. Inverse Compton scattering cools down the corona by transferring energy from the electrons to the soft disk photons. The temperature of the corona in black hole binaries, however, increases during periods in which the photon flux of the disk drops and Compton cooling is less effective. This means that a source of power balances the inverse Compton cooling and sets the temperature of the corona. Our findings reveal that in GRS 1915+105 the energy provided by this mechanism is split to either power the jet or heat the corona.These results provide evidence of a change in the geometry of the corona, and offer a unique clue to understand the nature of the corona and the jet in this object and the nature of the source that powers these components.

As discussed in the Supplementary Information, the change of sign of the lags is explained if a fraction of the disk photons that are Comptonized in the corona, which we call the feedback fraction, impinges back onto the disk before reaching the observer 26 . When this feedback fraction (which is between 0 and 1 from its definition) is low, time delays due to Comptonization dominate and the lags are positive; when this fraction is high, reprocessed disk photons reach the observer later than those from the corona and the lags become negative. Taking the corona sizes from fits with this model 27 , L ≈ 10-1,200 R g , and τ ≈ 1-6 and kT e ≈ 5-40 keV from the spectral fits, we find that E th ≈ 10 31 -10 35 erg. If this energy is released over the timescale of the high-frequency bump (note that this is the shortest variability timescale in the data; using any other timescale longer than this one to estimate the thermal luminosity would make the discrepancy even bigger), the thermal luminosity is two to five orders of magnitude lower than the observed luminosity of the corona in GRS 1915+105. The alternative is that the corona is powered by magnetic energy 25,28 , for example, shear energy due to differential rotation of the magnetic field lines that thread the accretion disk.

        <p>Motivated by the above, we propose that in GRS 1915+105 the corona turns into the jet and both are, at different times, the same physical component. The two separate correlations between the iron-line flux and the total flux in Fig. 2 are consistent with the above scenario, and point to a change in the geometry of the corona. When the source is along the flatter correlation, the corona covers the part of the accretion disk that produces the iron line, and the flux line is therefore attenuated 29,30 . When the source is along the steeper correlation, the corona extends vertically, switching to a lamp post geometry 31 ; in this phase inverse Compton scattering takes place in the jet, which then illuminates the disk anisotropically 32,33 . Because the jet does not cover the accretion disk, the flux of the iron line is not (or only mildly) attenuated.Motivated by the above, we propose that in GRS 1915+105 the corona turns into the jet and both are, at different times, the same physical component.

        <p>Based on the results shown here and based on fits with the model of the lags that we present in the Supplementary Information, the process by which the corona turns into the jet could proceed as follows. First, when the QPO frequency is ~6 Hz the corona is rela- tively large and enshrouds the inner parts of the accretion disk (Fig. 3a); as seen from the corona, the disk covers half of the sky and hence there is a high probability that photons from the corona return to the disk, leading to a high feedback fraction and negative QPO lags. As the QPO frequency decreases from ~6 Hz to ~2 Hz, the inner edge of the disk moves outwards and the magnitude of the lags and the size of the corona decrease. In this phase the magnetic field that threads the disk and powers the corona is relatively disorganized, and the magnetic energy is dissipated stochastically, leading to a high corona temperature. Second, at a QPO frequency of ~2 Hz (the transition occurs when the lags of the QPO change from negative to positive; although the exact value of the QPO frequency 17 at which this transition occurs is between 1.8 Hz and 2 Hz, here we will always write 2 Hz for simplicity), the size of the corona becomes equal to the truncation radius of the accretion disk, the feedback fraction decreases abruptly and the QPO lags become zero. From this point on, the corona moves inside the accretion disk (Fig. 3b), the magnetic field starts to become coherent on longer spatial scales, the stochastic energy dissipation decreases and the temperature of the corona drops. At the same time the magnetic field lines start to channel material from the corona into the direction perpendicular to the accretion disk, and low-level radio emission from the jet starts to appear. Third, as the QPO frequency continues decreasing from ~2 Hz to ~0.5 Hz, the inner disk radius moves farther out and the size of the corona increases again but, given that the lags are positive, this time the feedback fraction remains low. From this it follows that the corona does not cover the inner parts of the disk, which can only be the case if the geometry of the corona changes such that it becomes more prominent in the direction perpendicular to the disk (Fig. 3c); as seen from the corona, the disk now covers a much smaller area of the sky. As the magnetic field lines become more spatially coherent 34 , there is less stochastic energy dissipation, the corona temperature drops further, and the material from the corona that was channelled off the originally extended corona is expelled away from the accretion-disk plane and becomes the radio jet (Fig. 3d).Based on the results shown here and based on fits with the model of the lags that we present in the Supplementary Information, the process by which the corona turns into the jet could proceed as follows.

        <p>The appearance of radio flares when the QPO frequency is below 2 Hz reinforces our interpretation. Figure 4 shows that in the periods in which the frequency of the QPO moves more or less stochastically between ~2 Hz and ~8 Hz (red circles), the radio flux (light blue curve) is low. Occasionally, the QPO frequency evolves in a more systematic way: it starts to decrease and crosses below the value of 2 Hz (blue-red points), and at the same time the radio flux increases sharply and a radio flare lasting a few tens of days is observed. Figure 4 shows this behaviour over a period of about 500 days in which the source shows two radio flares. Supplementary Fig. 5 shows that the same behaviour repeats consistently over a period of 10 years and about a dozen radio flares.The appearance of radio flares when the QPO frequency is below 2 Hz reinforces our interpretation.

        <p>The behaviour we observe in GRS 1915+105 could explain the deviations from a single track in the radio and X-ray correlation of other accreting galactic black holes [43][44][45][46][47][48] . In Supplementary Fig. 7 we show that in the observations of GRS 1915+105 presented here the radio and X-ray flux are strongly correlated when the corona temperature is low and the lags of the QPO are positive, but they are uncorrelated when the corona temperature is high and the lags of the QPO are negative. If, as in the case of GRS 1915+105, the energy powering these systems is used to either accelerate the jet or heat the corona, different sources, or the same source at different times, will show lower radio fluxes at a given X-ray flux (or, equivalently, higher X-ray fluxes at a given radio flux), depending on how much energy is directed towards launching the radio jet or heating the X-ray corona, respectively. In principle, the same channelling of energy to the jet and the corona should happen in supermassive black holes, and should therefore apply to the full range of black hole masses in the fundamental plane of black hole activity 49 . Interestingly, it has been recently shown that radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars trace two separate planes in a plot of radio luminosity versus X-ray luminosity and black hole mass 50 . We speculate that, as in the case of GRS 1915+105 (Supplementary Fig. 7), these two relations reflect the fact that the temperature of the corona is higher in radio-quiet quasars than in radio-loud quasars.The behaviour we observe in GRS 1915+105 could explain the deviations from a single track in the radio and X-ray correlation of other accreting galactic black holes [43][44][45][46][47][48] . In Supplementary Fig. 7 we show that in the observations of GRS 1915+105 presented here the radio and X-ray flux are strongly correlated when the corona temperature is low and the lags of the QPO are positive, but they are uncorrelated when the corona temperature is high and the lags of the QPO are negative. If, as in the case of GRS 1915+105, the energy powering these systems is used to either accelerate the jet or heat the corona, different sources, or the same source at different times, will show lower radio fluxes at a given X-ray flux (or, equivalently, higher X-ray fluxes at a given radio flux), depending on how much energy is directed towards launching the radio jet or heating the X-ray corona, respectively. In principle, the same channelling of energy to the jet and the corona should happen in supermassive black holes, and should therefore apply to the full range of black hole masses in the fundamental plane of black hole activity 49 .

        <p>Power spectra. We examined all the RXTE archival observations of GRS 1915+105 from 1996 to 2012 obtained with the PCA. The observations that we used for our analysis belong to the class χ (ref. 6 ), state C, equivalent to one of the hard states in other (transient) black hole sources. For each observation we computed the Fourier power spectrum in the full energy band (absolute PCA channel 0-249) every 128 s with a time resolution of 1/512 s, corresponding to a Nyquist frequency of 256 Hz. We averaged all the 128 s power spectra within an observation, subtracted the contribution due to Poisson noise 51 and normalized 52 these averaged power spectra to units of fractional r.m.s. squared per hertz. (We ignored the background count rate for this calculation as it was always negligible compared to the source count rate.) We subsequently applied a logarithmic frequency re-bin to the data such that the size of a bin increases by exp(1/100) with respect to the size of the previous one, and we used 
            <rs type="software">XSPEC</rs> version 
            <rs type="version">12.9</rs> to fit the resulting power spectra with a sum of Lorentzian functions 53 that represent the broadband noise component and a number of QPOs 17 . As in previous studies 18 we included a Gaussian component centred at zero frequency in the model to fit a high-frequency bump at 60-80 Hz in the power spectra. (We show two power spectra with the best-fitting model in Supplementary Fig. 1.) For the rest of the analysis we selected only observations in which at least one narrow QPO peak is present on top of the broadband noise component in the power spectra, which is typical for the type-C QPOs 16 . Based on the fitting results we retained only features that were detected at a significance greater than 3σ and had a Q factor, defined as the ratio of the QPO frequency to its width, of 2 or more. We further checked the spectrogram of each observation, which shows visually the Fourier power spectrum as it varies with time, and excluded ~130 observations in which the QPO frequency changed strongly within a full RXTE observation. Our final sample contains a total of 620 observations. Lag spectra. Following the method described in refs. 54,55 , we produced a frequency-dependent phase-lag spectrum (lag-frequency spectrum) between the 2-5.7 and 5.7-15 keV energy bands for each observation. As our sample includes observations during the PCA calibration epochs 3-5, to account for changes in the PCA channel-to-energy gain factor we selected the closest absolute channels that matched these energy bands, but the exact boundaries of each band still differ slightly between epochs. To calculate the phase lags of the QPO, we averaged the lag-frequency spectra around the centroid frequency of the QPO, ν 0 ± FWHM/2, where FWHM is the full width at half maximum of the Lorentzian that we used to fit the QPO profile. In principle, the phase lags in the range of frequencies of the QPO can be affected by the lags of the underlying broadband noise component. However, in GRS 1915+105 the r.m.s. amplitude of the QPO is much higher than that of the broadband noise and the phase lags at the frequency of the QPO are dominated by the QPO itself, with the contribution of the noise component being negligible 56 . In this work, a positive (negative) lag means that the hard photons lag (lead) the soft photons. No correction for the dead-time-driven crosstalk 57 was done because this effect was found to be negligible. (See ref. 17 for other details of the timing analysis.) In Supplementary Fig. 2 we show nine representative power and lag-frequency spectra covering the range of frequencies of the QPO in GRS 1915+105.

        <p>Energy spectra. We used the RXTE PCA Standard 2 data to extract energy spectra separately for each observation in our sample. (We also fitted the RXTE High Energy X-ray Timing Experiment (HEXTE) data of those observations in which the instrument was operational; the results were consistent with those of the RXTE PCA, but as data of this instrument were not available for all observations, we did not use the RXTE HEXTE data for the rest of the analysis.) We corrected the energy spectra for dead time and used the FTOOLS PCABACKEST and PCARSP in 
            <rs type="software">HEADAS</rs> version 
            <rs type="version">6.27</rs> to, respectively, extract background spectra and produce response files for each observation. We fitted the energy spectra of all observations jointly with the model VPHABS*(DISKBB+GAUSS+NTHCOMP). The component VPHABS accounts for the interstellar absorption along the line of sight to the source; we used the abundance and cross-section tables given by ref. 58 and ref. 59 , respectively, with the column density of hydrogen, N H , linked across observations and free to vary. Because N H in the direction of GRS 1915+105 is quite high 60 (N H ≳ 6 × 10 22 atoms cm -2 ), we also made the abundance of iron in the interstellar material free to vary, as neutral iron produces an absorption edge at E ≈ 7.1 keV that was apparent in the fit residuals. The component DISKBB 61 represents the emission from an optically thick and geometrically thin accretion disk, and has parameters kT bb and N dbb that are, respectively, the temperature at the inner disk radius and the normalization of the component defined as the ratio of the inner disk radius to the distance to the source squared multiplied by the cosine of the inclination of the disk with respect to the line of sight. The component NTHCOMP 62 represents the emission due to inverse Compton scattering from the corona. The parameters of this component are the power-law index, Γ; the electron temperature of the corona, kT e ; the temperature of the source of soft photons that enter into, and are upscattered in, the corona, kT seed ; and a normalization that gives the flux density at 1 keV. We assumed that the source of seed soft photons is the accretion disk, and linked the temperature kT seed to the temperature of the DISKBB component for each observation separately during the fits. In this model, the optical depth of the corona, τ, assumed to be homogeneous, is a function 2 of Γ and kT e . Finally, the component GAUSS represents a broad iron emission line at 6.5-7 keV due to reflection of corona photons off the accretion disk 3,4 . Although a full reflection model 63,64 would be more appropriate to describe this effect, the PCA instrument does not have enough spectral resolution to distinguish between the profile of a line in a full reflection model and a Gaussian component. The parameters of the GAUSS component are the energy, width and total photon flux of the line, or E g , σ and N g , respectively. Finally, we calculated the total observed flux of the source and the intrinsic (that is, not affected by interstellar absorption) flux of the full model and of all the individual model components in the 2-25 keV energy range. In Supplementary Fig. 3 we show the energy spectra, with the best-fitting model, of the same two observations in Supplementary Fig. 1.

        <p>If the iron emission line is due to reflection of corona photons off the accretion disk, and the width of the line is a consequence of Doppler boosting, Doppler beaming and gravitational redshift, it would be more appropriate to use a full reflection component that includes relativistic broadening instead of a Gaussian to fit the spectrum. To explore this we fitted all the spectra with the model VPH ABS*(DISKBB+RELXILLCP+NTHCOMP), where the component REXILLCP 64 represents the reflection off the accretion disk of the emission from the NTHCOMP component. Compared to the fits with a Gaussian, this model has six extra free parameters. Given that the RXTE PCA instrument has limited spectral resolution and does not extend below ~3 keV, the model is insensitive to some of the parameters of REXILLCP, and some of these parameters become highly correlated with those of the DISKBB component. We therefore fixed the spin of the black hole to a * = 0.95 (ref. 60 ) and the inclination angle of the accretion disk to the line of sight to i = 65° (ref. 11 ). We further linked the two emissivity indices during the fits, which eliminates the parameter that gives the radius in the disk at which the power-law index of the emissivity profile changes, and fixed the inner radius of the disk at the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit 60 . Finally, we linked the power-law index, Γ, and the electron temperature, kT e , of RELXILLCP to the corresponding parameters of NTHCOMP. The extra free parameters of the fit are one emissivity index, the reflection fraction, the ionization parameter and the iron abundance of the disk. We obtain fits as good as those of the previous model, with the reflection fraction ranging from 1% to 20%. As the reflected component is much lower than the Comptonized component, the parameters of the NTHCOMP in these fits are consistent with those from the fits with a Gaussian line. The biggest impact of fitting the spectra with a reflection component is that the parameters of the disk are less well constrained in the model with REXILLCP than in the model with a Gaussian. This is understandable given that the emission of the reflection component at energies below ~4-5 keV, where the disk emission peaks, is higher than that of a Gaussian.If the iron emission line is due to reflection of corona photons off the accretion disk, and the width of the line is a consequence of Doppler boosting, Doppler beaming and gravitational redshift, it would be more appropriate to use a full reflection component that includes relativistic broadening instead of a Gaussian to fit the spectrum.

        <p>The REXILLCP model does not provide the flux or the equivalent width of the Gaussian; however, the reflection fraction of REXILLCP is generally correlated with the parameters of the line 65 . We plotted the flux of the iron line from the fits with a Gaussian against the reflection fraction from the fits with REXILLCP and confirmed that this is indeed the case in our fits. We therefore obtain plots similar to those in Fig. 2 if instead of the flux of the Gaussian line we plot the reflection fraction of REXILLCP versus total flux. We prefer to use the former because, as we explained above, the model with a Gaussian line has fewer free parameters than the full reflection model, which, given the limited spectral resolution of the RXTE PCA instrument, leads to degeneracies of the parameters in the fits with the full reflection model, and because by using a Gaussian we can easily include in the plot the measurements of the flux of the iron line obtained with Chandra and Suzaku, as we did in Fig. 2.The REXILLCP model does not provide the flux or the equivalent width of the Gaussian; however, the reflection fraction of REXILLCP is generally correlated with the parameters of the line 65 .

        <p>Hardness ratio. For each RXTE observation of GRS 1915+105 we computed a hardness ratio value defined as the ratio of the background-subtracted count rate of the source in the 13-60 keV band to that in the 2-7 keV band. As with the lagfrequency spectra, we selected the closest absolute channels that matched these energy bands in each PCA gain epoch. Before calculating the ratios, we corrected each observed count rate for instrumental dead time and normalized it by the count rate in the same band from the Crab Nebula to account for possible changes of the effective area of the instrument with time.Hardness ratio.

        <p>Radio fluxes. For the flux density data of GRS 1915+105 in radio, we used measurements 14 from the Ryle Telescope at 15 GHz with the four mobile antennas set in a compact array configuration within 100 m of the nearest fixed antenna, yielding a resolution of ~30 arcsec at that frequency. The flux density scale was calibrated with observations of the nearby quasars 3C 48 or 3C 286. The observations consist mostly of 32 s samples with an r.m.s. noise of 6 mJy that decreases as the square root of the integration time; flux density values below about 1 mJy may be unreliable. See ref. 14 for other details of the analysis of the radio data. Finally, we cross-correlated all the X-ray and radio data based on the date of the observations, which left us with a sample of 410 observations with simultaneous radio flux densities at 15 GHz and X-ray energy, power density and lag-frequency spectra, and hardness ratios.Radio fluxes.

        <p>Having described the observations and analysis we used, we note that the measurements presented in this paper come from very different types of data and totally independent analysis techniques. The hardness ratio, iron-line flux and kT e come from X-ray light curves and time-averaged energy spectra. The frequency and lags of the QPO and the r.m.s. amplitude of the high-frequency bump come from Fourier power spectra of high-time-resolution data. The radio flux was measured independently in a frequency band totally different from that of the X-ray data.Having described the observations and analysis we used, we note that the measurements presented in this paper come from very different types of data and totally independent analysis techniques.

This evinces that, although inclination may play a role, the thermodynamical properties of the corona have a much larger effect than inclination in setting the rms amplitude and lags of the QPO.Fits to the energy spectra: In Supplementary Figure 3 we show the energy spectra of the same two observations for which we show the power spectra in Supplementary Figure 1 1 spherical corona the rms amplitude and lags of the QPO may change with the inclination of the binary system with respect to the line of sight 71,72 .

At the same time the size of the corona decreases from L⇡1000 2000 km (⇠60 120 R g for a 12 solarmass black hole) to L⇡100 km (⇠6 10 R g ), the lags are negative and their magnitude decreases.Fits with this time-dependent model to the data of GRS 1915+105 show 27,74 that, as the QPO frequency decreases from ⇠6 Hz to ⇠2 Hz, the feedback fraction, which is the fraction of the corona photons that return to the disc, is close to 100% and remains more or less constant.

At a QPO frequency of ⇠2 Hz the corona size is minimum, the feedback fraction drops abruptly to zero and the lags become zero. If the QPO frequency is produced by Lense-Thirring precession 21,22 of the inner edge of the accretion disc, at a QPO frequency of 2 Hz the size of the corona is more or less equal to the inner disc radius (dashed line in Supplementary Figure 4).(In the model we solve the Kompaneets equation 75 for a spherical corona; since the actual geometry of the corona is likely different, the values given here should be considered as a characteristic size of the corona.)

Although the size of the corona increases again when the QPO frequency is below ⇠2 Hz, the fact that the feedback fraction is close to zero whereas when the QPO frequency is above ⇠2 Hz the feedback fraction is high, implies that the corona does not cover the inner parts of the accretion disc. This in turn demonstrates that the geometry of the corona has changed (see Fig. 3). Supplementary Figure 5 shows the time evolution of the QPO frequency superimposed on 10 years of the radio flux measurements of GRS 1915+105 with the Ryle telescope. To produce this Figure we reanalysed all the RXTE observations in the period of the radio monitoring campaign, and added 357 observations with QPOs that were not in the sample of 410 observations discussed so far. These 357 observations were not included in the original analysis 17 because the QPO frequency drifts by a few tenths of Hz in the observation period, which could bias the measurement of the rms and lags of the QPO. But since the frequency drift is only slightly larger than the error of the average QPO frequency in each observation, we decided to use these data for this Figure because this allows us to have a denser coverage of the time evolution of the QPO frequency during the radio monitoring campaign. Supplementary Figure 5 shows that the intervals of strong radio flares coincide with the times when the QPO frequency is below 2 Hz. (While it is apparent to the eye from the Figure, it is difficult to quantify what a strong radio flare is. Here we classify a flare as strong if its flux density exceeds 50 mJy for more than 10 days and the flare lasts more than 100 days.) This behaviour repeats consistently for all the radio flares in these observations; there is no radio flare in which the QPO frequency is not below 2 Hz, and there is no case of a QPO frequency below 2 Hz without a radio flare. Given the data, we estimated that the probability of having a QPO frequency below 2 Hz and a radio flare at the same time if the two phenomena were uncorrelated is less than 2⇥10 10 .When the QPO frequency decreases below ⇠2 Hz, the corona size increases again up to L⇡2⇥10 4 km (⇠1200 R g ) at the lowest QPO frequency, the feedback fraction remains constant close to zero and the lags become positive and increase with decreasing QPO frequency.

        <p>Taken together, the results shown in Supplementary Figures 4 and5 and the sudden change of the feedback fraction 27,74 from ⇠1 to ⇠0 when the QPO frequency is, respectively, above or below 2 Hz are consistent with the scenario described earlier, in which the energy that is initially stored in the X-ray corona is gradually released into the radio jet and, quite possibly, the X-ray corona itself becomes the jet.Taken together, the results shown in Supplementary Figures 4 and5 and the sudden change of the feedback fraction 27,74 from ⇠1 to ⇠0 when the QPO frequency is, respectively, above or below 2 Hz are consistent with the scenario described earlier, in which the energy that is initially stored in the X-ray corona is gradually released into the radio jet and, quite possibly, the X-ray corona itself becomes the jet.</p>

We calculated the expected flux as the product of the bolometric disc flux times e y , where y is the Compton parameter.The morphing of the extended corona into the jet is strengthened by the relation between the actual luminosity of the corona and that expected if the emission is due to inverse-Compton scattering of seed photons from the accretion disc.

        <p>(This is the expression for the case that the optical depth is ⌧ &gt; 1.) Since the Compton y parameter gives the number of scatterings times the relative energy that a photon gains per scattering, if the seed-photon source is the disc, the expected and observed corona fluxes should be roughly the same. This Figure shows that the observed and expected fluxes are the same (within a factor 3) only when the lags of the QPO are negative (yellow, orange and red points), i.e., when the QPO frequency is higher than ⇠2 Hz and the disc is enshrouded by the corona. When the lags are positive (light blue and blue points) and the corona morphed into the jet, if the seed photons were from the disc the expected flux of the corona is much lower than the one observed. In this phase a different source must be providing the seed photons for Comptonisation. Since in this phase the jet is active, the most likely source of seed photons is synchrotron emission 76 from the same electrons that produce the jet. Indeed, if we calculate the expected corona flux by multiplying the observed synchrotron flux coming from the jet extrapolated to the X-ray band times e y , the expected corona flux is much higher when the lags of the QPO are positive than when they are negative.(This is the expression for the case that the optical depth is ⌧ &gt; 1.) Since the Compton y parameter gives the number of scatterings times the relative energy that a photon gains per scattering, if the seed-photon source is the disc, the expected and observed corona fluxes should be roughly the same. This Figure shows that the observed and expected fluxes are the same (within a factor 3) only when the lags of the QPO are negative (yellow, orange and red points), i.e., when the QPO frequency is higher than ⇠2 Hz and the disc is enshrouded by the corona. When the lags are positive (light blue and blue points) and the corona morphed into the jet, if the seed photons were from the disc the expected flux of the corona is much lower than the one observed. In this phase a different source must be providing the seed photons for Comptonisation. Since in this phase the jet is active, the most likely source of seed photons is synchrotron emission 76 from the same electrons that produce the jet. Indeed, if we calculate the expected corona flux by multiplying the observed synchrotron flux coming from the jet extrapolated to the X-ray band times e y , the expected corona flux is much higher when the lags of the QPO are positive than when they are negative.</p>
        <p>The radio/X-ray correlation: In Figure 7 we show the radio flux vs. the total X-ray flux in the 2 25 keV band for all 410 separate observations of GRS 1915+105. In the left panel the colour scale represents the temperature of the corona , kT e , while in the right panel the colours represent the phase lags of the QPO. The radio and X-ray fluxes are strongly correlated when the corona is cold and the QPO lags are positive (colours towards blue), but are uncorrelated when the corona is hot and the QPO lags are negative (colours towards red). This dichotomy naturally explains the deviations from a single track in the radio/X-ray correlation of accreting galactic black holes [43][44][45][46][47] as well as the spread in the fundamental plane of black-hole activity 77 . If, as we propose here, the energy powering these systems is used to either accelerate the jet or heat the corona, different sources, or the same source at different times, will show lower radio fluxes at a given X-ray flux (or, equivalently, higher X-ray fluxes at a given radio flux), depending on how much energy is directed towards, respectively, launching the radio jet or heating the X-ray corona.The radio/X-ray correlation: In Figure 7 we show the radio flux vs. the total X-ray flux in the 2 25 keV band for all 410 separate observations of GRS 1915+105.

        <p>Fits to the power spectra: In Supplementary Figure 1 we plot two representative Fourier power spectra of GRS 1915+105 to show both the type-C QPO and the high-frequency bump. The power spectrum plotted in black corresponds to the observation from September 21 1998 (ObsID 30703-01-34-00), while the power spectrum plotted in blue corresponds to the observation from April 10 1998 (ObsID 30402-01-09-01). Both power spectra were calculated using photons from the full PCA band, nominally 2 60 keV. The QPO is the narrow feature that appears in both power spectra at ⇠2 Hz, with a second harmonic and subharmonic at, respectively, ⇠4 Hz and ⇠1 Hz.Fits to the power spectra: In Supplementary Figure 1 we plot two representative Fourier power spectra of GRS 1915+105 to show both the type-C QPO and the high-frequency bump.

        <p>In the case of GRS 1915+105 it is relatively straightforward to distinguish the QPO fundamental from the subharmonic and harmonic components because the QPO fundamental, subharmonic and harmonic components show very different rms amplitude and lags dependence when plotted vs. their own frequency 17 , and the fundamental is always the strongest peak in the power spectrum.In the case of GRS 1915+105 it is relatively straightforward to distinguish the QPO fundamental from the subharmonic and harmonic components because the QPO fundamental, subharmonic and harmonic components show very different rms amplitude and lags dependence when plotted vs. their own frequency 17 , and the fundamental is always the strongest peak in the power spectrum.</p>
        <p>The model includes also two broad Lorentzians centred, respectively, at 0 Hz and 2.5 Hz to fit the the broad-band noise component in the power spectrum. The high-frequency bump is the broad feature extending up to ⇠100 Hz in the black power spectrum 51,[64][65][66][67][68][69] . We fitted this bump with a zero-centred Gaussian and let the width and normalisation free to vary during the fits. It is apparent that the QPO at 2 Hz and its second harmonic and subharmonic are present in both power spectra, but the high-frequency bump is only present in the observation of September 1998 and significantly absent in the one of April 1998. We computed the rms amplitude of the highfrequency bump by integrating the power of the best-fitting Gaussian from 0 Hz to 1. The rms amplitude of the high-frequency bump in the observation of September 1998 is 8.0±0.3% of the it is apparent that the high-frequency bump is present when the temperature of the corona is high.The model includes also two broad Lorentzians centred, respectively, at 0 Hz and 2.5 Hz to fit the the broad-band noise component in the power spectrum.

        <p>Indeed, when we fit all the observations we find that the rms amplitude of the high-frequency bump is higher when the temperature of the corona is higher, regardless of the values of the hardness ratio and QPO frequency in each observation (see Figure 1).Indeed, when we fit all the observations we find that the rms amplitude of the high-frequency bump is higher when the temperature of the corona is higher, regardless of the values of the hardness ratio and QPO frequency in each observation (see Figure 1).</p>
        <p>In Supplementary Figure 2 we plot the power-and lag-frequency spectra of nine observations of GRS 1915+105, representative of the range of frequencies covered by the type-C QPO. The phase lags of the QPO change from positive when the frequency of the QPO is lower than ⇠2 Hz to negative when the frequency of the QPO is higher than ⇠2 Hz. (See 17 for details of this result and a discussion of the implication of this behaviour.) At the same time, as the QPO frequency increases the slope of the lag spectrum decreases 27 , going from positive when the frequency increases from from ⇠0.5 Hz to ⇠2 Hz, to 0 when the frequency is ⇠2 Hz, and finally to negative when the QPO frequency increases further from ⇠2 Hz to ⇠6 Hz.In Supplementary Figure 2 we plot the power-and lag-frequency spectra of nine observations of GRS 1915+105, representative of the range of frequencies covered by the type-C QPO.
