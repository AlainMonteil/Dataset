        <p>Over the last few years, both Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and Spitzer observations have revealed a population of likely massive galaxies at z &gt; 3 that was too faint to be detected in Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) rest-frame ultraviolet imaging. Ho we v er, due to the v ery limited photometry for individual galaxies, the true nature of these so-called HSTdark galaxies has remained elusive. Here, we present the first sample of such galaxies observed with very deep, high-resolution NIRCam imaging from the Early Release Science programme CEERS. 30 HST -dark sources are selected based on their red colours across 1.6-4.4 μm. Their physical properties are derived from 12-band multiwavelength photometry, including ancillary HST imaging. We find that these galaxies are generally heavily dust-obscured ( A V ∼ 2 mag), massive (log ( M /M ) ∼ 10), star-forming sources at z ∼ 2 -8 with an observed surface density of ∼0.8 arcmin -2 . This suggests that an important fraction of massive galaxies may have been missing from our cosmic census at z &gt; 3 all the way into the Epoch of Reionization. The HST -dark sources lie on the main sequence of galaxies and add an obscured star formation rate density of 3 . 2 + 1 . 8 -1 . 3 × 10 -3 M yr -1 Mpc -3 at z ∼ 7, showing likely presence of dust in the Epoch of Reionization. Our analysis shows the unique power of JWST to reveal this previously missing galaxy population and to provide a more complete census of galaxies at z = 2 -8 based on rest-frame optical imaging.Over the last few years, both Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and Spitzer observations have revealed a population of likely massive galaxies at z &gt; 3 that was too faint to be detected in Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) rest-frame ultraviolet imaging.

        <p>Over the last few years, evidence has been mounting that, indeed, a population of obscured, star-forming galaxies with less extreme star formation rates (SFRs) than SMGs could be quite common in the early Universe. These sources have been undetected in current HST surv e ys, due to their very red colours between 1 . 6 and 4 . 5 μm (e.g. Franco et al. 2018 ;Wang et al. 2019 ), and they have thus been named HIEROs ( HST to IRAC extremely red objects), H dropouts, HST -dark galaxies, or HST-faint galaxies. Very red dusty sources e xist ev en below the sensitivity limits in IRAC, making them only detectable by ALMA. Ho we ver, pre vious studies with ALMA relied on small areas of the sky, thus reporting only one or two galaxies in some cases (e.g. Williams et al. 2019 ;Fudamoto et al. 2021 ). Hence, HST -dark sources are typically selected in Spitzer /IRAC imaging or as serendipitous sources in ALMA submillimetre continuum data (e.g. Huang et al. 2011 ;Simpson et al. 2014 ;Caputi et al. 2015 ;Stefanon et al. 2015 ;Wang et al. 2016Wang et al. , 2019 ; ;Franco et al. 2018 ;Alcalde P amplie ga et al. 2019 ;Williams et al. 2019 ;Yamaguchi et al. 2019 ;Umehata et al. 2020 ;Fudamoto et al. 2021 ;Sun et al. 2021 ;Manning et al. 2022 ). Ho we ver, due to the limited photometric information available, their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and redshifts remained uncertain. Nevertheless, the general consensus in the literature is that the vast majority of these galaxies are heavily dust-obscured, star-forming sources at z ∼ 3 -6 that dominate the high-mass end of the galaxy population at these early cosmic times (e.g. Alcalde P amplie ga et al. 2019 ; Wang et al. 2019 ).Over the last few years, evidence has been mounting that, indeed, a population of obscured, star-forming galaxies with less extreme star formation rates (SFRs) than SMGs could be quite common in the early Universe.

        <p>Accurately constraining the number densities and the physical properties of such sources is critical for our understanding of early galaxy build-up. It is concei v able that dust-obscured, HSTundetected sources dominate the SFRD at z &gt; 4 unlike what is typically assumed (e.g. Williams et al. 2019 ;Gruppioni et al. 2020 ;Zavala et al. 2021 ). However, the most recent 2 mm number counts as well as IR luminosity functions measured from ALMA continuum observations out to z ∼ 4 -7 indicate a less extreme scenario (see Casey et al. 2018 ;Barrufet et al. 2023 ). Nevertheless, it has become clear that our census of galaxies at z &gt; 3 is indeed far from complete, leaving a critical gap in our understanding of early galaxy build-up.Accurately constraining the number densities and the physical properties of such sources is critical for our understanding of early galaxy build-up.

        <p>Finding and characterizing this missing galaxy population is a key goal of extragalactic astronomy in order to inform theoretical models of galaxy evolution. In this paper, we address this important question with some of the first JWST NIRCam imaging from the Early Release Science (ERS) surv e y CEERS (Finkelstein et al. 2022 ).

            <rs type="software">grizli1</rs> pipeline. Most notably, the images are aligned with the Gaia Data Release 3 catalogues. For details on the reduction, we refer the reader to Brammer et al. (in preparation). In the following, we work with images at 40 mas pixel scale. The 5 σ depths are measured in circular apertures of 0.48 arcsec diameter. They range from 27.8 mag in the medium band filter F 410 M to 28.4-28.6 mag in the wide filters F 200 W , F 277 W , and F 356 W at 2 -3 . 5 μm (see also table 1 in Naidu et al. 2022 ).

In particular, we include a re-reduction of all the ACS and WFC3/IR imaging taken in these fields in the five filters: F 606 W , F 814 W , F 125 W , F 140 W , and F 160 W . The 5 σ depths measured in the 0.48 arcsec circular apertures for the HST data range from 28.4 mag in F 606 W to 27.0 mag in F 140 W . While the HST near infra-red (NIR) data are shallower, they still provide additional multiwavelength constraints. Most importantly, using the F 160 W filter allows us to use HST -dark galaxy selections analogous to previous HST + Spitzer searches (see the next section).We also include the available ancillary data from HST since the CEERS surv e y co v ers the previous CANDELS/EGS field.

        <p>We match the point spread functions (PSFs) in all but the WFC3 images to the F 444 W filter using the deconvolution algorithm from Lucy ( 1974 ). The multiwavelength photometric catalogues were derived with 
            <rs type="software">SEXTRACTOR</rs> (Bertin &amp; Arnouts 1996 ), which we run in dual mode, using a PSF-matched, inverse-variance weighted stack of the F 277 W , F 356 W , and F 444 W images as the detection image and measuring fluxes in all bands in circular apertures of 0.48 arcsec diameter. We scale the obtained fluxes to total based on the AUTO flux measurements in the F 444 W image with the default Kron parameters. In order to take the PSF differences between F 444 W and the WFC3 filters into account, we match their PSFs to the F 160 W filter, which has the largest FWHM among all filters considered here. We run 
            <rs type="software">SEXTRACTOR</rs> again on the resulting images, using the same detection image as before. For each WFC3 filter, we then correct the fluxes measured in the original image to match the PSFmatched colour between the WFC3 filter and F 444 W , respectively. As a general quality cut, the catalogue contains objects with S/N &gt; 5 in at least one of the available NIRCam-wide filters. We also remo v ed MNRAS 522, 449-456 (2023) objects near the edge and bad pixels; hence, we guarantee that all the sources of the catalogue are not spurious. Finally, to account for systematic uncertainties in the photometry we apply an error floor of 5 per cent to all flux measurements.

        <p>Previous HST -dark galaxy studies were based on analyses of HST + Spitzer /IRAC data (e.g. Wang et al. 2016 ;Alcalde P amplie ga et al. 2019 ;Wang et al. 2019 ). These selections were limited by two factors: (1) the very broad PSF of the IRAC data with FWHM of ∼1.7 arcsec and (2) the limited depth of available IRAC imaging. Hence, typical HST -dark samples were limited to very bright sources with [4.5] ࣠ 24.5 mag. Now, with the unparalleled high-resolution, deep JWST data, we can push such analyses to much fainter sources. Nevertheless, in this first paper, we focus on sources that are identified using very similar selection methods as previous HST + Spitzer samples in order to reveal their nature.Previous HST -dark galaxy studies were based on analyses of HST + Spitzer /IRAC data (e.g. Wang et al. 2016 ;Alcalde P amplie ga et al. 2019 ;Wang et al. 2019 ).

Ho we ver, the av ailable photometry for these sources is very poor, with significant detections only in the IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 μm bands, and mostly upper limits at HST wavelengths.We use a similar colour cut to the 'traditional' HST -dark galaxies selection colour adopted in the literature (e.g. Caputi et al. 2012 ;Wang et al. 2016 ).

To find an appropriate colour cut, we compute theoretical fluxes using Bayesian Analysis of Galaxies for Physical Inference and Parameter EStimation (BAGPIPES; Carnall et al. 2018 ). We perform similar modelling that we use on the SED fitting (see Section 3 ). We set to a delayed SFH (e-folding time τ = 3 Gyr), a stellar mass of M * = 10 M and a metallicity of Z = 0.5 Z . We model the fluxes F 160 W and F 444 W with a dust attenuation set to A V = 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 mag, respectively, tracking the redshift evolution with steeps z = 0.1 between 2 &lt; z &lt; 6. We find that applying a colour cut of F 160 W -F 444 W &gt; 2.0 selects galaxies at z &gt; 3 at A V = 2.0 (see Fig. 1 ).In this first paper, we substitute the IRAC data for NIRCam data.

We remo v e six galaxies that are at the edge of the image and do not have a clear detection in the longer wavelength of the wide NIRCam filters ( F 444 W , F 356 W , F 277 W ). And three more galaxies for which the photometry is extremely noisy, likely due to remaining detector artefacts.

We also show the cut-outs of previous IRAC images from the S-CANDELS programme (Ashby et al. 2015 ). The outstanding increase in depth and spatial resolution at 3 -5 μm can be appreciated. With the exception of a handful of our sample galaxies, none of these would have been easily selected based on pre viously av ailable data.

        <p>We find that an HST -dark galaxy selection includes a variety of sources with the vast majority of the sample being high redshift dustobscured, massive, star-forming systems. The photometric redshifts are accurate for the galaxies at z &gt; 3.3 with small uncertainties ( z ∼ 0.1 -0.2) with only one solution in the redshift posterior distribution function (see Table A1 and Fig. 2 ). The subset of galaxies that is placed at z &lt; 3.3 presents more considerable uncertainties and typically shows two possible redshift solutions.We find that an HST -dark galaxy selection includes a variety of sources with the vast majority of the sample being high redshift dustobscured, massive, star-forming systems.

        <p>As expected, we confirm the dusty nature of these colour-selected HST -dark galaxies. We have allowed the dust attenuation to vary broadly in the modelling, but the values only reach up to A v = 4 mag for almost all HST -dark galaxies with a median value for the sample of A v ∼ 2.1 mag. An alternative procedure to classify among dusty and quiescent galaxies is the commonly accepted UVJ diagrams (see e.g. Spitler et al. 2014 ).

        <p>Given their dusty nature, it is interesting to compare the HST -dark galaxies with a classical SMG sample in order to put them in a broader conte xt of massiv e highz dusty galaxies. We find that HST -dark galaxies have higher redshifts compared to SMGs (see the histogram in Fig. 5 ). Interestingly and probably not unexpectedly, HST -dark galaxies have lower SFRs than SMGs. Similarly, we also find HSTdark galaxies have more than an order of magnitude lower stellar masses than the massive SMGs that weigh M * ∼ 10 12 M .Given their dusty nature, it is interesting to compare the HST -dark galaxies with a classical SMG sample in order to put them in a broader conte xt of massiv e highz dusty galaxies.

        <p>In Fig. 6 , we further show the location of HST -dark and SMGs on the SFR-M * diagram with respect to the main sequence (MS) of galaxies at z ∼ 4. As can be seen, HST -dark sources at these redshifts follow the MS. They populate its lower mass end compared to both SMGs and IRAC-selected HST -dark galaxies. Specifically, we have compared our results with two previous studies of dusty galaxies. The ALESS sample from da Cunha et al. ( 2015 ) shows a larger number of starburst galaxies that lie significantly abo v e the MS. In between our sample and SMGs, we find more massive HST -dark galaxies from Wang et al. ( 2019 ). This difference could be due to the selection criteria and lower mass HST -dark galaxies could have been missing from Spitzer -selected samples.In Fig. 6 , we further show the location of HST -dark and SMGs on the SFR-M * diagram with respect to the main sequence (MS) of galaxies at z ∼ 4.

        <p>In a nutshell, HST -dark galaxies appear to be the higher redshift, lower SFR extension of SMGs. They have likely just not been detected in previous submillimetre single-dish studies due to their faintness. The synergy between JWST and ALMA data will be needed to confirm this rather interesting outcome.In a nutshell, HST -dark galaxies appear to be the higher redshift, lower SFR extension of SMGs.

        <p>The cosmic SFH is key to explaining the mass assembly and the metal enrichment of the galaxy population both vital to understanding galaxy evolution. Although the CSFRD is well constrained up to z ∼ 8 for UV-selected galaxies (i.e. LBGs), the contribution from obscured, IR rest-frame selected galaxies is still highly uncertain and only poorly constrained at z &gt; 3 (e.g. is: when does the dust-obscured star formation start to dominate the CSFRD? And, more specifically, what is the contribution to the CSFRD from HST -dark galaxies? In this section, we approach this question and put our results in the context of the most rele v ant highz galaxy populations.The cosmic SFH is key to explaining the mass assembly and the metal enrichment of the galaxy population both vital to understanding galaxy evolution.

        <p>We calculate the SFRD for our sample of HST -dark galaxies at z &gt; 3.5 in four redshift equidistant bins centred at z = 3.3, 4.5, 5.7, and 6.9, respectively. We find a contribution of SFRD = 1 . 4 + 1 . 1 -0 . 8 × 10 -3 M yr -1 Mpc -3 at z = 4.5 that remains constant within the uncertainty up to z ∼ 7. Specifically, we measure SFRD ∼ 2 . 0 + 2 . 0 -1 . 1 × 10 -3 M yr -1 Mpc -3 at z ∼ 6, and SFRD ∼ 3 . 2 + 1 . 8 -1 . 3 × 10 -3 M yr -1 Mpc -3 at z ∼ 7. Fig. 7 shows that our results have similar SFRD to previously selected HST -dark galaxy samples at z ∼ 4 -6. There are no current observations of HST -dark galaxies at z &gt; 6. Our results, however, suggest that the SFRD of HST -dark galaxies remains constant, within the uncertainty, or becomes even slightly larger at z ∼ 7. This could suggest a remarkable presence of dust in the Epoch of Reionization. As a caveat, we notice that our selection criteria tend to select HSTdark galaxies at z ∼ 7 due to the bright F 444 W flux that selects [O III ] lines in the SED. Also, our redshift bins currently only contain a few sources each and future studies with larger samples are needed to corroborate this result.We calculate the SFRD for our sample of HST -dark galaxies at z &gt; 3.5 in four redshift equidistant bins centred at z = 3.3, 4.5, 5.7, and 6.9, respectively.

        <p>Thanks to the outstanding impro v ement of NIRCam data o v er the previous Spitzer /IRAC imaging, this work provides more reliable photometric redshifts, SFRs, and stellar masses compared to previous HST -dark galaxy studies.
