        <p>We study 3d CFTs with an O(N ) global symmetry using the conformal bootstrap for a system of mixed correlators. Specifically, we consider all nonvanishing scalar four-point functions containing the lowest dimension O(N ) vector φ i and the lowest dimension O(N ) singlet s, assumed to be the only relevant operators in their symmetry representations. The constraints of crossing symmetry and unitarity for these four-point functions force the scaling dimensions (∆ φ , ∆ s ) to lie inside small islands. We also make rigorous determinations of current two-point functions in the O(2) and O(3) models, with applications to transport in condensed matter systems.We study 3d CFTs with an O(N ) global symmetry using the conformal bootstrap for a system of mixed correlators.

        <p>Conformal field theories (CFTs) lie at the heart of theoretical physics, describing critical phenomena in statistical and condensed matter systems, quantum gravity via the AdS/CFT correspondence, and possible solutions to the hierarchy problem (and other puzzles) in physics beyond the standard model. Quite generally, they serve as the endpoints of renormalization group flows in quantum field theory. The conformal bootstrap [1,2] aims to use general consistency conditions to map out and solve CFTs, even when they are strongly-coupled and do not have a useful Lagrangian description.Conformal field theories (CFTs) lie at the heart of theoretical physics, describing critical phenomena in statistical and condensed matter systems, quantum gravity via the AdS/CFT correspondence, and possible solutions to the hierarchy problem (and other puzzles) in physics beyond the standard model.

        <p>In [51] some of the present authors demonstrated that semidefinite programming techniques can very generally be applied to systems of mixed correlators. In 3d CFTs with a Z 2 symmetry, one relevant Z 2 -odd operator σ, and one relevant Z 2 -even operator , the mixed The case N = 1, corresponding to the 3d Ising model, is from [51]. The allowed regions for N = 2, 3, 4, 20 were computed with Λ = 35, where Λ (defined in appendix A) is related to the number of derivatives of the crossing equation used. Each region is roughly triangular, with an upper-left vertex that corresponds to the kinks in previous bounds [15].

        <p>Let us consider whether the crossing equations must be modified in the case of only SO(N ) symmetry. In theories with SO(2) symmetry, the antisymmetric tensor representation is isomorphic to the singlet representation. (This is not true for O(2) because the isomorphism involves ij .) However in the crossing equation (2.7), antisymmetric tensors appear with odd spin, while singlets appear with even spin. Thus, the coincidence between A and S does not lead to additional relations in (2.7).Let us consider whether the crossing equations must be modified in the case of only SO(N ) symmetry.

        <p>For theories with SO(3) symmetry, the antisymmetric tensor representation is equivalent to the vector representation. Thus, antisymmetric odd spin operators appearing in φ × φ may also appear in φ × s. This does not affect (2.7) because there is no a priori relationship between λ φφO and λ φsO . However, it is now possible to have a nonvanishing four-point function φ i φ j φ k s proportional to ijk . Including crossing symmetry of this four-point function cannot change the resulting dimension bounds without additional assumptions. The reason is as follows. Any bound computed from (2.7) without using crossing of φφφs is still valid. Hence, the bounds cannot weaken. However, because any O(3)-invariant theory is also SO(3)-invariant, any bound computed while demanding crossing of φφφs must also apply to O(3)-invariant theories. So the bounds cannot strengthen. Crossing for φφφs only becomes important if we input that λ φφO λ φsO is nonzero for a particular operator. 2 This would guarantee our theory does not have O(3) symmetry.For theories with SO(3) symmetry, the antisymmetric tensor representation is equivalent to the vector representation.

The medium blue region was computed from the system of correlators φφφφ , φφss , ssss at Λ = 19, and assumes ∆ φ and ∆ s are the only relevant dimensions in the vector and singlet scalar channels at which contributions appear. The dark blue region is computed similarly, but additionally assumes the OPE coefficient relation λ φφs = λ φsφ . This latter assumption leads to a small closed region in the vicinity of the red cross, which represents the Monte Carlo estimate for the position of the O(2) model from [56].Figure 2.

        <p>correlator bound has an excluded upper region, an allowed lower region, and a kink in the curve separating the two. The position of this kink corresponds closely to where we expect the O(2) model to lie, and one of our goals is to prove using the bootstrap that the O(2) model does indeed live at the kink. 5 If we assume that s is the only relevant O(2) singlet, then a small portion of the allowed region below the kink gets carved away, analogous to the Ising case in [51].correlator bound has an excluded upper region, an allowed lower region, and a kink in the curve separating the two.

        <p>Adding the constraints of crossing symmetry and unitarity for the full system of correlators φφφφ , φφss , ssss does not change these bounds without additional assumptions. However, having access to the correlator φφss lets us input information special to the O(2) model that does have an effect. We expect that φ is the only relevant O(2) vector in the theory. One way to understand this fact is via the equation of motion at the Wilson-Fisher fixed point in 4 -dimensions, [56]. The red lines represent the 1σ (solid) and 3σ (dashed) confidence intervals for ∆ s from experiment [55]. The allowed/disallowed regions in this work were computed by scanning over a lattice of points in operator dimension space.Adding the constraints of crossing symmetry and unitarity for the full system of correlators φφφφ , φφss , ssss does not change these bounds without additional assumptions.

        <p>This equation implies that the operator φ 2 φ i is a descendent, so there is a gap in the spectrum of O(2)-vector primaries between φ i and the next operator in this sector, which is a linear combination of φ i φ 4 and φ i (∂φ) 2 . The equation of motion makes sense in perturbation theory 1. However, it is reasonable to expect gaps in the spectrum to be robust as gets larger. In particular, we expect this gap to persist as → 1. Thus, a gap in the O(2)-vector sector reflects the equations of motion of the O(2) model.This equation implies that the operator φ 2 φ i is a descendent, so there is a gap in the spectrum of O(2)-vector primaries between φ i and the next operator in this sector, which is a linear combination of φ i φ 4 and φ i (∂φ) 2 .

        <p>Including more correlators could result in significantly improved bounds on operator dimensions. In the case of O(N ) symmetric CFTs, it would be natural to include the lowest dimension O(N ) symmetric tensor as an external operator in the crossing equations. In the O(N ) models, this operator actually has a lower dimension than s. This is an important difference from the Ising model, where φ and s are the two lowest dimensional scalars in any sector of the theory. Our present bounds on the lowest symmetric tensor treated it as an internal operator in the crossing equations. Including it as an external operator would open access to many other O(N ) representations. Perhaps the O(N ) models are not uniquely determined by the condition of only one relevant O(N ) singlet and vector scalar, and we must also specify something about these other representations. Studying the O(N ) models in other dimensions (such as in 5d [22,28,30,69,70]) may also help to shed light on these issues. We plan to further explore these questions in the future.Including more correlators could result in significantly improved bounds on operator dimensions.

        <p>In addition to scaling dimensions, it is also important to determine OPE coefficients. Here we presented an example in the computation of the current central charge C J . In the case of O(2) symmetry, this yields the current most precise prediction for the highfrequency conductivity in O(2)-symmetric systems at criticality. It will be interesting to extend these mixed-correlator computations to other OPE coefficients in the O(N ) models such as the stress-tensor central charge C T and 3-point coefficients appearing in JJs and JJT which control frequency-dependent corrections to conductivity. Pursuing the latter will require implementing the bootstrap for current 4-point functions, a technical challenge for which efforts are ongoing in the bootstrap community.In addition to scaling dimensions, it is also important to determine OPE coefficients.

        <p>More generally, the results of this work make it seem likely that scaling dimensions in many other strongly-interacting CFTs can be rigorously determined using the multiple correlator bootstrap. It will be interesting to study mixed correlators in 3d CFTs with fermions and gauge fields -it is plausible that similar islands can be found for the 3d Gross-Neveu models and 3d Chern-Simons and gauge theories coupled to matter. In 4d, we hope that by pursuing the mixed correlator bootstrap we will eventually be able to isolate and rigorously determine the conformal window of QCD. It also be interesting to apply this approach to theories with conformal manifolds to see the emergence of lines and surfaces of allowed dimensions; a concrete application would be to extend the analysis of [14,23] to mixed correlators and pursue a rigorous study of the dimension of the Konishi operator in N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at finite N . The time is ripe to set sail away from our archipelago and explore the vast ocean of CFTs!More generally, the results of this work make it seem likely that scaling dimensions in many other strongly-interacting CFTs can be rigorously determined using the multiple correlator bootstrap.

        <p>As described in [51], the problem of finding α satisfying (2.10) can be transformed into a semidefinite program. Firstly, we must approximate derivatives of V S , V T , V A , and V V as positive functions times polynomials in ∆. We do this by computing rational approximations for conformal blocks using the recursion relation described in [51]. Keeping only the polynomial numerator in these rational approximations, (2.10) becomes a "polynomial matrix program" (PMP), which can be solved with SDPB [52].As described in [51], the problem of finding α satisfying (2.10) can be transformed into a semidefinite program.

The number of spins depends on Λ as follows Finally let us conclude with some comments on the precision of the plots presented in the main text. Conformal blocks of correlation functions involving operators of nonequal dimensions depend nontrivially on the difference of the dimensions. Hence, when computing the boundary of various allowed regions, it is convenient to perform a scan over a lattice of points. The vectors generating the lattice points are shown in table 2. The smooth regions shown in figures 1, 3, 5, and 6 are the results of a least-squares fit, subject to the constraint that allowed lattice points should lie inside the curves while excluded ones lie outside. In table 2 we also show the maximal perpendicular distance of these points to the curves.Finally, we must choose which spins to include in the PMP.

        <p>In this appendix we collect some detailed scans of the allowed region of (∆ φ , ∆ s , ∆ t Qualitatively the picture is the same for each value of N and we expect that the projections of the 3d plot into the (∆ φ , ∆ s ) plane will look similar for even higher values of N . In particular, the lowest allowed values of ∆ t are obtained at the lower left corner of the allowed region in the (∆ φ , ∆ s ) plane, while the greatest values are obtained at upper right corner of the allowed region. This allows us to find general bounds on ∆ t without doing a whole scan over the (∆ φ , ∆ s ) plane; it is enough to find bounds on ∆ t at the corner points. Open Access.
