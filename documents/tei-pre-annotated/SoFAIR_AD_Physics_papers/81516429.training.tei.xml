        <p>We examine various scenarios that involve a light O(1 TeV) leptoquark state and select those which are compatible with the current experimental values for B(B s → µµ), B(B → Kµµ) large-q 2 , R K = B (B → Kµµ)/B (B → Kee), and which lead to predictions consistent with other experimental data. We show that two such scenarios are phenomenologically plausible, namely the one with a doublet of scalar leptoquarks of hypercharge 1/6, and the one with a triplet of vector leptoquarks of hypercharge 2/3. We also argue that a model with a singlet scalar leptoquark of hypercharge 1/3 is not viable. Using the present experimental data as constraints, it is shown that the exclusive lepton flavor violating decays, B(B s → µτ ), B(B → Kµτ ) and B(B → K * µτ ), can be as large as O(10 -5 ).We examine various scenarios that involve a light O(1 TeV) leptoquark state and select those which are compatible with the current experimental values for B(B s → µµ), B(B → Kµµ) large-q 2 , R K = B (B → Kµµ)/B (B → Kee), and which lead to predictions consistent with other experimental data.

        <p>The experimental searches of New Physics (NP) at the LHC are of great importance in our quest for solving the hierarchy and flavor problems. Rare decays and low-energy precision measurements play a crucial role in searching for the effects of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) because they are complementary to direct searches and even allow us to probe JHEP11(2016)035 energy scales well above those that can be probed through them. Among the various types of rare decays, the lepton flavor violating (LFV) ones are particularly appealing because they are absent in the Standard Model (SM), and their detection would represent a clean signal of NP.The experimental searches of New Physics (NP) at the LHC are of great importance in our quest for solving the hierarchy and flavor problems.

        <p>Theoretically, the LFV decays are predicted in various NP scenarios, such as in models with heavy sterile fermions [1][2][3][4][5][6], in models with a peculiar breaking of supersymmetry [7][8][9][10], in models involving an extra Z -boson [11,12], and in multiple scenarios founded on the paradigm of existence of one or more leptoquark (LQ) states [13]. Most of the current experimental efforts in searching for the effects of LFV are focused onto lepton decays, 1 → 2 γ, 1 → 3 2 (with 1,2 ∈ {e, µ, τ }), and on the µ -e conversion in nuclei [14]. The experimental sensitivity to probe these decays is expected to be improved in the years to come by several orders of magnitude. The LFV decays of hadrons are complementary to the purely leptonic decays because they represent a convenient ground to test LQ models, and they also represent a different environment to test the result of the above-mentioned leptonic modes. For example, in the LQ models, which will be discussed in this paper, the rates of the LFV decays of hadrons are much larger than in radiative and three-body lepton decays.Theoretically, the LFV decays are predicted in various NP scenarios, such as in models with heavy sterile fermions [1][2][3][4][5][6], in models with a peculiar breaking of supersymmetry [7][8][9][10], in models involving an extra Z -boson [11,12], and in multiple scenarios founded on the paradigm of existence of one or more leptoquark (LQ) states [13].

        <p>Since the LHCb Collaboration is actively searching for the B s → τ τ events, we also show the correlation between B(B → Kµτ ) and B(B s → τ τ ) in figure 4. We see again that even if B(B s → τ τ ) is found to be consistent with the SM value, B(B s → τ τ ) SM = 7.7(5) × 10 -7 , one can still have a significant B(B → Kµτ ). This can be understood from eq. (3.2), since B s → τ τ will be modified by NP only if the product (g L ) sτ (g L ) * bτ is nonzero, and therefore one should have both (g L ) sτ = 0 and (g L ) bτ = 0 to produce a deviation from the SM. On the other hand, the product (g L ) sµ (g L ) * bµ is already fixed to a nonzero value by b → sµµ exclusive data. Therefore, it is enough to have one of the couplings (g L ) sτ or (g L ) bτ different JHEP11(2016)035 from zero in order to induce LFV in B (s) decays through the effective coefficients (C τ µ 10 ) or (C µτ 10 ) , respectively. For that reason, the LFV modes are more robust probes of the LQ couplings. Notice, however, that if LHCb can establish an upper bound on B(B s → τ τ ), this would certainly be more important than the other limits that we have used here to constraint the third generation couplings.Since the LHCb Collaboration is actively searching for the B s → τ τ events, we also show the correlation between B(B → Kµτ ) and B(B s → τ τ ) in figure 4.

(3.10) to be unitary. Indeed, if U 3 was a remnant of a larger multiplet of gauge bosons, one could consider a theory in the unitary gauge in which the UV divergences appearing in the flavour changing neutral processes are removed by the sums over the couplings, i.e. by the GIM mechanism, and for this technique to work we would require x LL to be unitary. 11 However, in the unitary case the couplings to e and/or first generation of quarks cannot be avoided and then the very strong null constraints from LFV searches apply. In this particular case, we have found that the upper bounds on µ -e conversion on Au nucleus and the one on B(K L → µe) already discard U 3 with unitary x LL as a viable scenario for explaining R exp K . Thus we continue along with our analysis using the non-unitary ansatz, and we completely avoid couplings to electrons by paying the price of being unable to unambiguously JHEP11(2016)035 predict any loop-induced process.

        <p>Through g V the U 3 vector LQ state modifies the overall normalization of the SM spectrum of B → D ν without modifying its shape, cf. eq. (A.8) in appendix A. Thus in the U 3 -model we vary the couplings within |x LL ij | &lt; 4π and apply the abovementioned constraints, namely the one on C µµ 9 , and the one arising from R exp D , both at 2σ. 12We fix the mass at m U = 1 TeV. Further constraints are coming from the purely thirdgeneration charged current and the up-type neutral current processes which are mediated by the U (5/3) 3µ eigencharge component. Among the charged current processes, the most efficient constraint comes from the measured B(t → bτ ν) exp = 0.096 (28) [90]. The effect of U 3 here is an overall rescaling of t → bτ ν via coupling g V | b→tτ ν , cf. eq. (5.9). We apply this constraint by eliminating any point in the parameter space that results in B(t → bτ ν) out of the 1σ region of B(t → bτ ν) exp . Once the above constraints are applied it appears that the constraints coming from the up-quark rare process, B(D 0 → µµ) exp &lt; 6.2 × 10 -9 [73] (cf. eq. (A.14)), and from B(τ → µφ) are redundant. Furthermore, we have checked that the LFU ratios, Γ(τ → Kν)/Γ(K → µν) and Γ(K → µν)/Γ(K → eν), are consistent with experiment. Like in the previous subsection, with the couplings selected to verify the above constraints, we can compute various quantities. In particular, in figure 5 we show the correlation between R νν and B(B s → τ τ ), and again observe that the current experimental limit on R νν provides a stringent constraint on the parameter space.

These two quantities are used mostly because the theoretical uncertainties are under better control since the hadronic matrix elements have been estimated by means of numerical simulations of QCD on the lattice, and also because the high-q 2 region is above the very narrow ccresonances, so that the contribution of cc can be treated by using the quark-hadron duality.In this paper we discuss exclusive b → s 1 2 LFV decay modes in various models in which the existence of an O(1 TeV) leptoquark state is assumed.

        <p>In this section we summarized the hadronic parameters considered in our analysis. The decay constants obtained by simulations of QCD on the Lattice are summarized in table 3 [61]. In order to perform the fit of B(B → Kµ + µ -) high-q 2 , we combine the B → K form factors which were precisely determined in the low-recoil region by ref. [68], and more recently by ref. [69]. Similarly, to compute R D we have used the B → D form factors recently computed in ref. [74]. Finally, the LFV semileptonic decays B → K ( * ) 1 2 were analysed by employing the form factors of ref.
