        <p>We investigate the shadow, deflection angle, and the greybody bounding of a Schwarzschild-AdS/dS black hole in scaledependent gravity. We used the EHT data to constrain the parameter . We have found that within the 1σ level of uncertainty, M 0 ranges at 10 -11 -10 -16 orders of magnitude for Sgr. A*, and 10 -11 -10 -17 for M87*. Using these parameters, we explored how the shadow radius behaves as perceived by a static observer. Using the known parameters for Sgr. A* and M87*, we found different shadow cast behavior near the cosmological horizon even if the same scaling parameters were used. We explored the deflection angle α in the weak field limit for both massive and null particles, in addition to the effect of finite distances using the non-asymptotically flat version of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. We have found that the α strongly depends on massive particles. Tests on 's effect using Sgr. A* is only along points of low impact parameters. For M87*, only the scaled BH in AdS type can be tested at high impact parameters at the expense of very low value for α. We study the rigorous bound on the greybody factor for scalar field emitted from black holes in the theory and show the bound on the transmission probability. The effects of the scale-dependent gravity on the greybody factors are investigated, and the results indicate that the bound on the greybody factor in this case is less than the bound for the Schwarzschild black hole.We investigate the shadow, deflection angle, and the greybody bounding of a Schwarzschild-AdS/dS black hole in scaledependent gravity.

        <p>In four-dimensional spacetime, General Relativity (in what follows GR) is the only viable theory (of gravity) able to satisfy: (i) the requirements of diffeomorphism invariance and (ii) the strong equivalence principle [1]. Albeit General Relativity has a solid theoretical and experimental foundation, there are several additional reasons to investigate alternative theories of gravity. Firstly, from a theoretical perspective, two of the most remarkable problems still present in GR are: (i) the presence of singularities [2,3], and (ii) the impossibility of a renormalization (following standard processes of quantization) [4]. Secondly, from an observational perspective, it is well-known that the discovery of the dark sectors of the Universe becomes evident the necessity of fundamental physics. At this point, it is required the inclusion of new physics to connect both the ultraviolet (UV) and the infrared (IR) sectors. Such a 'New physics' could maintain the laws of gravity and perhaps will be only necessary for the inclusion of new fields (interacting with ordinary matter) that are felt mainly through gravity. In recent years, gravitational wave (GW) astronomy [5][6][7][8] has emerged as an indispensable tool for strong-gravity observations. Thus, GWs are representations in which inspiral and merger of binary compact objects, such as black holes and neutron stars, acquire extreme configurations. In the context of an alternative theory of gravity, we should expect GW waveforms to be disturbed [9].

        <p>Of particular interest in classical and alternative theories of gravity is the study of black holes. They are usually considered elementary objects. This idea comes from a significant amount of results, usually encoded into the "no-hair theorem" [12]. Moreover, black holes are essential for classical and quantum gravity. On the one hand, they are a generic prediction of Einstein's General Relativity (and other metric theories of gravity) and, on the other hand, the simplest objects in the Universe. Black holes offer a wide variety of features in which classical and quantum effect coexists in a complex form. In this respect, although it has not been detected yet, Hawking's radiation [13,14] has a particular spot inside the different effects occurring in a black hole. Up to now, we have a few classic and remarkable examples of black holes in four dimensions. The Schwarzschild solution [15], the Reissner-Nordström solution [16,17], the Kerr solution [18] and, finally, the Kerr-Newman solution [19]. The solutions mentioned above can certainly be connected. Thus, the Kerr black hole solution is the spinning generalization of the Schwarzschild solution, and, on the other hand, the Kerr-Newman solution is the charged spinning generalization of Reissner-Nordström black hole. These four metrics are often referred to as the "black-hole" solutions of general relativity. The aforementioned examples have been significantly studied, obtaining almost all their properties.Of particular interest in classical and alternative theories of gravity is the study of black holes.

        <p>Interestingly, black holes have been investigated in several dimensions. One of the most remarkable examples found is devoted to the 2+1 dimensional case. The BTZ solution [20][21][22] as well as its modifications (see, for example [23]) offers a perfect arena to study the vast properties a black hole has. Alternatively, the relevance of higher-dimensional black holes becomes evident when we analyze two main ingredients: different rotation dynamics and the appearance of extended black objects. It is well-known that in more than four dimensions, there is the possibility of rotation in several independent rotation planes. The other aspect of rotation that is modified when the number of dimensions increases is the relative competition between the gravitational and centrifugal potentials [24]. The other novel ingredient in d &gt; 4 (and usually absent in lower dimensions -at least in vacuum gravity-) is the presence of black objects with extended horizons. The latter means black strings and, in general, black p-branes.Interestingly, black holes have been investigated in several dimensions.

        <p>Up to now, black holes in General Relativity have been profoundly analyzed, ranging from 2+1 dimensions to moving the most realistic case, i.e., 3+1 dimensions, up to considering higher-dimensional extensions as 4+1 gravity (or higher dimensional cases). Although successful, GR has specific problems such as the singularity problem or the incompatibility with quantum mechanics. Such issues make it necessary to extend/modify GR. Among other theories, we have several canonical attempts to modify Einstein's General Relativity. Let us mention the well-known Brans-Dicke theory, in which Newton's constant is identified as a scalar field coupled non-minimally with the Ricci scalar [25,26]. Another alternative is Asymptotically Safe (AS) gravity, a formalism in which the idea is simple: to obtain a consistent and predictive quantum theory of the gravitational field [27], systematically applied to black hole physics [28]. Interestingly, one of the most remarkable ingredients required in any attempt to consistently include quantum features in gravity is the inclusion of running couplings. Thus, coupling constants appearing at the action level are no longer constant. Instead, they are functions that evolve in spacetime. In this respect, we have several alternatives to be used to replace/improve classical gravity compatible with quantum physics. To name a few, we have (i) The improved formalism [29] (ii) The variational parameter settings [30] (iii) Scale-dependent gravity (see details and seminal references in next section), among others. Thus, this paper will consider a black hole solution obtained in the context of scale-dependent gravity in four dimensions with spherical symmetry in the presence of a cosmological constant.Up to now, black holes in General Relativity have been profoundly analyzed, ranging from 2+1 dimensions to moving the most realistic case, i.e., 3+1 dimensions, up to considering higher-dimensional extensions as 4+1 gravity (or higher dimensional cases).

        <p>On the other hand, the most visually striking example of the light bending effect is the curious phenomenon of shadow cast and also gravitational lensing of the black hole. The shadow of the Schwarzschild black hole was first studied by Synge in 1966 [31], then Luminet provided a formula for the angular radius of the shadow and visualized it [32]. Recently, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has taken picture of the first image of the supermassive black hole Messier 87 and later Sagittarius A* [33,34]. This observation reveals a way to test Einstein's theory of general relativity in a strong field regime where the photon ring and shadow have been seen in the image. In the literature there are many studies on shadow of the black hole and also wormholes to understand the nature of the spacetime and their properties in various modified gravity theories . On the other hand, gravitational lensing has been known as a impressive tool to address fundamental problems in astrophysics at different scales [66][67][68][69][70][71][72][73]. In 2008, Gibbons and Werner found a new way to derive deflection angle of the black holes in weak field limits by using Gauss-bonnet theorem on the optical metric for the Schwarzschild black hole [74], then Werner extended it to stationary black holes using the Kerr-Randers optical geometry [75]. Since then, this method of Gibbons-Werner has been used in various papers to show the weak deflection angle of many black holes or wormholes in the literature [39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][76][77][78][79][80][81][82][83][84][85][86][87][88][89][90][91][92].On the other hand, the most visually striking example of the light bending effect is the curious phenomenon of shadow cast and also gravitational lensing of the black hole.

        <p>We will now move to the scale-dependent version of the above-mentioned black hole. As was previously mentioned in the introduction, to include quantum features into a certain classical background, it is (usually) necessary to allow the classical coupling constant to evolve to functions, which, in principle, run with the energy scale k. Up to now, there are a huge variety of well-motivated scenarios where scale-dependent couplings are the key ingredient to obtaining self-consistent solutions. Technically, the starting point is the same that the classical case. However, instead of considering the classical action, we use an average effective action [g μν , k]. Taking variations with respect to the metric field, g μν , and the renormalization scale, k, we can get the effective Einstein's field equations plus a consistent relation to close the system. Thus, the action in this effective gravity is given as follows:We will now move to the scale-dependent version of the above-mentioned black hole.

        <p>At this point, it is mandatory to mention the physical meaning of the renormalization scale k. The connection between k and any physical variable is not well-established, being always a technical and conceptual issue. In curved spacetimes, the concrete form of k ≡ k(r ) is not evident [128], different from those occurred in flat spacetimes (where k ∼ r -1 ). Naively, we could consider a few ways to make progress regarding k(r). Firstly, we could use semiclassical approaches where a classical metric must be used. The disadvantage, however, is that such a metric is no longer valid in the strong-curvature regime. Another possibility emerge when we consider a k(r) as a function of invariants of the theory, for instance: (i) the Ricci scalar or, (ii) the Kretschmann scalar. Thus, we could introduce a relation as k ≡ k(R), but the concrete form is still missing. These kinds of problems motivated us to review how k is related to variables of the system under study. Irrespectively of the concrete form of k, the scale-dependent formalism contains solutions coming from GR after considering the appropriated limit values. The latter is true by construction, given that SD gravity slightly modifies classical black hole solutions when varying scale-dependent coupling functions replace classical couplings. These kinds of systems (where the coupling constant evolves) can be solved by knowing the concrete form of the coupling constants [94] or, alternatively, from a background independent integration of the functional renormalization group [129][130][131][132].At this point, it is mandatory to mention the physical meaning of the renormalization scale k.

We then applied such bounds to analyze the shadow cast behavior as perceived by a static observer, whose position r obs can be found near the black hole or to a limit near the cosmological horizon. The Schw dS and AdS types manifest at points near such limits. However, we have seen that 's effect is to disrupt such behavior. For instance, as shown in Fig. 3, the effect of high is to make the AdS type behavior become a dS type relative to our location from Sgr. A* or M87*. For M87*, we also observe a decoupling behavior between the dS and AdS Schw in 4D scaled gravity. Next, we have implemented the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, modified to allow calculation of the weak deflection angle for nonasymptotically flat spacetime. We derived an expression that accommodates finite distance, massive, and null particles. We have found that as v → 1, the weak deflection by a BH in 4D scaled gravity approaches the Schw dS and AdS type. That is, the effect of the scale parameter vanishes. However, observing the deflection angle of relativistic particles, we have seen that such deviations from the standard ones only manifest at low values of impact parameters for Sgr. A*. For M87*, the effect of AdS scaled gravity can also manifest at high impact parameters at the expense of low values of α. Consequently, ultra-sensitive devices are needed to detect the effect of scaled gravity at high impact parameters. Finally, we also considered an alternative analysis where it would be possible to determine α if both the light source and the receiver are near the cosmological horizon. Our results revealed that the resulting value α is even higher than those at low impact parameters. The effects of can still be realized in this domain, except for the scaled dS type model. See Fig. 5.In this paper, we have investigated the shadow and weak deflecting angle of 4D scale-dependent Schwarzschild-AdS/dS black holes for the first time. Also, its greybody bound was computed too. We first find constraints for using the EHT data. These values are summarized in Table 2.

        <p>In Einstein's theory of relativity, it is known that greybody factor is related to a black hole's quantum nature, so a high value of the greybody factor shows a high probability that Hawking radiation can propagate to infinity. In this way, one can extract quantum information from the greybody factor to gain insight into the theory of quantum gravity. In this paper, last we studied the rigours bound of the greybody factor numerically and plot it in Fig. 6 for 0 and Fig. 7 for 1. We show in the graph that when the parameter of M 0 increases, the bound of the greybody factor also decreases. The numerical analysis demonstrates that the effect of parameter M 0 estimation is significant when the deflection angle, the shadow cast, and the rigorous bound of the greybody are calculated. Future observations and further analysis will test the shadow cast's stability, shape, and depth more accurately and give us hints about the black holes in light of scale-dependent gravity.In Einstein's theory of relativity, it is known that greybody factor is related to a black hole's quantum nature, so a high value of the greybody factor shows a high probability that Hawking radiation can propagate to infinity.
