        <p>We propose a new experiment to measure the running of the electromagnetic coupling constant in the spacelike region by scattering high-energy muons on atomic electrons of a low-Z target through the elastic process μ e → μ e. The differential cross section of this process, measured as a function of the squared momentum transfer t = q 2 &lt; 0, provides direct sensitivity to the leading-order hadronic contribution to the muon anomaly a HLO μ . By using a muon beam of 150 GeV, with an average rate of ∼1.3 ×10 7 muon/s, currently available at the CERN North Area, a statistical uncertainty of ∼0.3% can be achieved on a HLO μ after two years of data taking. The direct measurement of a HLO μ via μe scattering will provide an independent determination, competitive with the time-like dispersive approach, and consolidate the theoretical prediction for the muon g-2 in the Standard Model. It will allow therefore a firmer interpretation of the measurements of the future muon g-2 experiments at Fermilab and J-PARC.We propose a new experiment to measure the running of the electromagnetic coupling constant in the spacelike region by scattering high-energy muons on atomic electrons of a low-Z target through the elastic process μ e → μ e.

        <p>In searching for new physics, low-energy high-precision measurements are complementary to the LHC high-energy frontier. The long-standing (3)(4)σ discrepancy between the experimental value of the muon anomalous magnetic moment a μ = (g -2)/2 and the Standard Model (SM) prediction, a μ (Exp -SM) ∼ (28 ± 8) × 10 -10 [1,2], has been considered during these years as one of the most intriguing indications of physics beyond the SM. However, the accuracy of the SM prediction, 5 × 10 -10 , is limited by strong interaction effects, which cannot be computed perturbatively at low energies. Long time ago, by using analyticity and unitarity, it was shown [3][4][5] that the leading-order (LO) hadronic contribution to the muon g-2, a HLO μ , could be computed via a dispersion integral of the hadron production cross section in e + e -annihilation at low-energy. The present error on a HLO μ , ∼ 4 × 10 -10 , with a fractional accuracy of 0.6%, constitutes the main uncertainty of the SM prediction.

        <p>Figure 1, from Ref. [1], shows the status of the g-2 discrepancy compared with what could be expected after the new g-2 measurements at Fermilab and J-PARC, assuming that the central value would remain the same. Together with a fourfold improved precision on the experimental side, an improvement on the LO hadronic contribution is highly desirable. Differently from the dispersive approach, which relies on time-like data from annihilation cross sections, our proposal is to determine a HLO μ from a measurement of the effective electromagnetic coupling in the space-like region, where the vacuum polarization is a smooth function of the squared momentum transfer. This method has been recently proposed [25] by using Bhabha scattering data. A method to determine the running of α by using small-angle Bhabha scattering was proposed in [26] and applied to LEP data in [27]. The hadronic contribution to the running of α can also be determined unambiguously through the t-channel μe elastic scattering process, from which a HLO μ could be obtained, as detailed in this paper.Figure 1, from Ref.

        <p>Such an accuracy can be achieved if the efficiency is kept highly uniform over the entire q 2 range, including the normalization region, and over all the detector components. This motivates the choice of a purely angular measurement: an acceptance of tens of mrad can be covered with a single sensor of modern silicon detectors, positioned at a distance of about one meter from the target. It has to be stressed that particle identification (electromagnetic calorimeter and muon filter) is necessary to solve the electron-muon ambiguity in the region below 5 mrad. The wrong assignment probability can be measured with the data by using the rate of muon-muon and electron-electron events.Such an accuracy can be achieved if the efficiency is kept highly uniform over the entire q 2 range, including the normalization region, and over all the detector components.

        <p>Another requirement for reaching very high accuracy is to measure all the relevant contributions to systematic uncertainties from the data themselves. An important effect, which distinguishes the normalization from the signal region, is multiple scattering, as the electron energy in the normalization region is as low as 1 GeV. Multiple scattering breaks the muon-electron two-body angular correlation, moving events out of the kinematic line in the 2D plot of Fig. 3. In addition, multiple scattering in general causes acoplanarity, while two-body events are planar, within the resolution. These facts allow effects to be modelled and measured using data. An additional handle on multiple scattering could be the inclusion of a thin layer in the apparatus, made of the same material as the main target modules. This possibility will be studied in detail with simulation.Another requirement for reaching very high accuracy is to measure all the relevant contributions to systematic uncertainties from the data themselves.

Multiple scattering breaks the muon-electron two-body angular correlation, moving events out of the kinematic line in the 2D plot of Fig. 3. In addition, multiple scattering in general causes acoplanarity, while two-body events are planar, within the resolution. These facts allow effects to be modelled and measured using data. An additional handle on multiple scattering could be the inclusion of a thin layer in the apparatus, made of the same material as the main target modules. This possibility will be studied in detail with simulation.</p>
        <p>The challenge of the proposed measurement is the feasibility of achieving a systematic uncertainty at the level of 10 ppm. This is the key point from the experimental side. In order to demonstrate that such a precision can be realistic, a very detailed optimization of the experimental apparatus is necessary. Tests with beams (electrons and muons), and with one or two modules of the detector, will be necessary and a crucial tool to understand if and to what extent the systematic uncertainties can be kept under control. They will provide a proof-of-concept of the proposed method. From preliminary studies we are confident that such a challenge can be succesfully addressed.The challenge of the proposed measurement is the feasibility of achieving a systematic uncertainty at the level of 10 ppm.

        <p>From the theoretical point of view, the control of the systematic uncertainties requires the development of highprecision Monte Carlo tools, including all the relevant QED radiative corrections to reach the needed theoretical precision.From the theoretical point of view, the control of the systematic uncertainties requires the development of highprecision Monte Carlo tools, including all the relevant QED radiative corrections to reach the needed theoretical precision.</p>
        <p>To this aim, QED radiative corrections at fixed order (NLO, NNLO), properly matched to leading-logarithmic corrections resummed to all orders of perturbation theory, are mandatory to achieve the necessary theoretical accuracy on the relevant differential cross sections.To this aim, QED radiative corrections at fixed order (NLO, NNLO), properly matched to leading-logarithmic corrections resummed to all orders of perturbation theory, are mandatory to achieve the necessary theoretical accuracy on the relevant differential cross sections.</p>
        <p>Tools to calculate Bhabha scattering exist, like for instance the BabaYaga event generator [48][49][50], which implement exact NLO corrections matched with leading-logarithmic resummation, ensuring that the differential cross section is theoretically under control at the O(10 -4 ) level. The same algorithmic framework can be extended to μe → μe scattering and generalized to include exact diagrammatic NNLO corrections.Tools to calculate Bhabha scattering exist, like for instance the BabaYaga event generator [48][49][50], which implement exact NLO corrections matched with leading-logarithmic resummation, ensuring that the differential cross section is theoretically under control at the O(10 -4 ) level.

        <p>For the μe → μe case, NLO QED corrections have been explored in Refs. [51][52][53] and can be easily reproduced with modern numerical techniques and tools. Concerning NNLO corrections, they are not yet available for μe → μe scattering. Nevertheless, the full two-loop result is known for Bhabha scattering (see Ref. [54] and references therein); we expect that at least some sub-sets of these corrections can be used (e.g. two loop corrections which do not connect e and μ lines) and the remaining part (e.g. two-loop box corrections, which connect the two lines and have two different mass scales) can be studied and eventually calculated with modern techniques. Matching NNLO corrections to resummation of higher orders will shift the theoretical error from contributions of order α 2 L to order α 3 L 2 (where L is a typical collinear logarithm, i.e. L ≡ log(s/m 2 e ) 14 for the process under consideration). From exploratory simulations in the setup of the present proposal in the case of Bhabha scattering, we estimate that, while O(α 2 L) contributions on the t distribution are at the level of few 10 -4 , the O(α 3 L 2 ) ones are roughly in the range of 10 -5 , therefore reaching the necessary theoretical goal.For the μe → μe case, NLO QED corrections have been explored in Refs.

        <p>Two comments are in order: first, the above estimate concerns the Bhabha process and hence can be considered as an upper limit of the impact of radiative corrections to the μe → μe process, being the leading collinear logarithm for μ radiation (L 4.5) smaller than for e. Second, when using the ratio of the cross sections in the signal and normalization regions, we expect that the theoretical uncertainty will not deteriorate, due to partial cancellation of common radiative corrections.Two comments are in order: first, the above estimate concerns the Bhabha process and hence can be considered as an upper limit of the impact of radiative corrections to the μe → μe process, being the leading collinear logarithm for μ radiation (L 4.5) smaller than for e.

        <p>We presented a novel approach to determine the running of α in the space-like region and a HLO μ , the leading hadronic contribution to the muon g-2, by scattering high-energy muons on atomic electrons of a low-Z target through the process μe → μe. The experiment is primarily based on a precise measurement of the scattering angles of the two outgoing particles as the q 2 of the muon-electron interaction can be directly determined by the electron (or muon) scattering angle.We presented a novel approach to determine the running of α in the space-like region and a HLO μ , the leading hadronic contribution to the muon g-2, by scattering high-energy muons on atomic electrons of a low-Z target through the process μe → μe.

        <p>An advantage of the muon beam is the possibility of employing a modular apparatus, with the target subdivided in subsequent layers. A low-Z solid target is preferred in order to provide the required event rate, limiting at the same time the effect of multiple scattering as well as of other types of muon interactions (pair production, bremsstrahlung and nuclear interactions).An advantage of the muon beam is the possibility of employing a modular apparatus, with the target subdivided in subsequent layers.

        <p>The normalization of the cross section is provided by the very same μe → μe process in the low-q 2 region, where the effect of the hadronic corrections on α(t) is negligible. Such a simple and robust technique has the potential to keep systematic effects under control, aiming to reach a systematic uncertainty of the same order as the statistical one. For this purpose a preliminary detector layout has been described. By considering a beam of 150 GeV muons with an average intensity of ∼1.3×10 7 muon/s, currently available at the CERN North Area, a statistical uncertainty of ∼0.3% can be achieved on a HLO μ in two years of data taking. A test performed using a single detector module, exploiting the muon beam facility, could provide a validation of the proposed method.The normalization of the cross section is provided by the very same μe → μe process in the low-q 2 region, where the effect of the hadronic corrections on α(t) is negligible.
