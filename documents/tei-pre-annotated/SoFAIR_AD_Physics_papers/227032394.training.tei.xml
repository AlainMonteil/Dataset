        <p>A search for the decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson into a b b pair when produced in association with a W or Z boson is performed with the ATLAS detector. The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 79.8 fb -1 were collected in proton-proton collisions during Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. For a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, an excess of events over the expected background from other Standard Model processes is found with an observed (expected) significance of 4.9 (4.3) standard deviations. A combination with the results from other searches in Run 1 and in Run 2 for the Higgs boson in the b b decay mode is performed, which yields an observed (expected) significance of 5.4 (5.5) standard deviations, thus providing direct observation of the Higgs boson decay into b-quarks. The ratio of the measured event yield for a Higgs boson decaying into b b to the Standard Model expectation is 1.01 ± 0.12(stat.) +0.16 -0.15 (syst.). Additionally, a combination of Run 2 results searching for the Higgs boson produced in association with a vector boson yields an observed (expected) significance of 5.3 (4.8) standard deviations.A search for the decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson into a b b pair when produced in association with a W or Z boson is performed with the ATLAS detector.

        <p>The Higgs boson [1][2][3][4] was discovered in 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [5,6] with a mass of approximately 125 GeV from the analysis of proton-proton (pp) collisions produced by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [7]. Since then, the analysis of data collected at centre-of-mass energies of 7 TeV, 8 TeV and 13 TeV in Runs 1 and 2 of the LHC has led to the observation of many of the production modes and decay channels predicted by the Standard Model (SM). The bosonic decay channels are well established and have entered an era of precision measurements [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18]. The decay into τ -lepton pairs was first observed in the combination of the ATLAS and CMS analyses [19,20]. The main Higgs boson production modes, gluon-gluon fusion (ggF) and vector-boson fusion (VBF), were already measured following the analysis of the Run 1 data, and recently the coupling of the Higgs boson to top quarks was directly observed by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [21,22] through the observation of the associated production of a Higgs boson and a top-quark pair (t t H).The Higgs boson [1][2][3][4] was discovered in 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [5,6] with a mass of approximately 125 GeV from the analysis of proton-proton (pp) collisions produced by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [7].

        <p>Searches in this channel at the Tevatron by the CDF and D0 Collaborations showed an excess of events with a significance of 2.8 standard deviations for a Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV [28].

        <p>This Letter reports an update to the search for the SM Higgs boson decaying into a b b pair in the V H production mode with the ATLAS detector in Run 2 of the LHC presented in Ref. [32]. This update uses 79.8 fb -1 of pp collision data collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, to be compared with 36.1 fb -1 for the previous result. In addition, an updated version of the ATLAS reconstruction code and improved object calibrations are used, the impact of the luminosity and modelling systematic uncertainties are reduced from updated measurements and estimates, and larger samples of simulated events are used to model the background processes. Events are selected in 0-, 1-and 2-lepton channels, based on the number of charged leptons, (electrons or muons), to explore the Z H → ννb b, W H → νb b and Z H → b b signatures, respectively. The dominant background processes after the event selection are V + jets, t t, single-top and diboson process.This Letter reports an update to the search for the SM Higgs boson decaying into a b b pair in the V H production mode with the ATLAS detector in Run 2 of the LHC presented in Ref.

        <p>Multivariate discriminants, built from variables that describe the kinematics of the selected events, are used to maximise the sensitivity to the Higgs boson signal. Their output distributions are combined using a binned maximum-likelihood fit, referred to as the global likelihood fit, which allows the signal yield and the background normalisations to be extracted. The signal extraction method is cross-checked with the dijet-mass analysis, where the signal yield is extracted using the mass of the dijet system as the main fit observable, and validated using the diboson analysis, where the nominal multivariate analysis is modified to extract the V Z, Z → b b diboson process. The result of the multivariate analysis is then combined with that of the previously published analysis of Run 1 data [30], with other searches for b b decays of the Higgs boson and with other searches in the V H production mode. The latter two combinations lead to the observation of both the b b decay of the Higgs boson and V H production. An observation of the b b decay of the Higgs boson by the CMS Collaboration [31] was submitted for publication at the same time as this Letter.Multivariate discriminants, built from variables that describe the kinematics of the selected events, are used to maximise the sensitivity to the Higgs boson signal.

        <p>ATLAS [44] is a general-purpose particle detector covering nearly the entire solid angle 1 around the collision point. An inner tracking detector, located within a 2 T axial magnetic field generated by a thin superconducting solenoid, is used to measure the trajectories and momenta of charged particles. The inner layers consist of high-granularity silicon pixel detectors covering a pseudorapidity range |η| &lt; 2.5, and include an innermost layer [45,46] that was added to the detector between Run 1 and Run 2. Silicon microstrip detectors covering |η| &lt; 2.5 are located beyond the pixel detectors. Outside the microstrip detectors and covering |η| &lt; 2.0, there are straw-tube tracking detectors, which also provide measurements of transition radiation that are used in electron identification. A calorimeter system surrounds the inner tracking detector, covering the pseudorapidity range |η| &lt; 4.9. Within the region |η| &lt; 3.2, electromagnetic calorimetry is provided by barrel (|η| &lt; 1.475) and endcap (1.375 &lt; |η| &lt; 3.2) high-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters, with an additional thin LAr presampler covering |η| &lt; 1.8 to correct for energy loss in material upstream of the calorimeters. Hadronic calorimetry is provided by a steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter within |η| &lt; 1.7, and copper/LAr endcap calorimeters extend the coverage to |η| = 3.2. The solid angle coverage for |η| between 3.2 and 4.9 is completed with copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr calorimeter modules optimised for electromagnetic and hadronic measurements, respectively. The 1 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the z-axis coinciding with the axis of the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP towards the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r, φ) are used in the transverse plane, φ being the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle θ as η =ln tan(θ/2). The distance in (η, φ) 2 , is also used to define cone sizes. Transverse momentum and energy are defined as p T = p sin θ and E T = E sin θ , respectively. outermost part of the detector is the muon spectrometer, which measures the curved trajectories of muons in the magnetic field of three large air-core superconducting toroidal magnets.

        <p>The online selection uses E miss T triggers with thresholds that varied from 70 GeV to 110 GeV between the 2015 and 2017 data-taking periods. Their efficiency was measured in W + jets, Z + jets and t t events in data using single-muon triggers, resulting in correction factors that are applied to the simulated events, ranging from 1.05 at the offline E miss T threshold of 150 GeV to a negligible deviation from unity at an E miss T above 200 GeV. A requirement on the scalar sum of the transverse momenta H T of the jets removes a small part of the phase space where the trigger efficiency depends mildly on the number of jets in the event. Events with any loose lepton are rejected. High E miss T in multi-jet events typically arises from mismeasured jets in the calorimeters. Such events are efficiently removed by requirements on the angular separation of the E miss T , jets, and p miss T (the missing transverse momentum calculated using only tracks reconstructed in the inner tracking detector and matched to the primary vertex).The online selection uses E miss T triggers with thresholds that varied from 70 GeV to 110 GeV between the 2015 and 2017 data-taking periods.

The muon sub-channel uses the same E miss T triggers and correction factors as the 0-lepton channel, as these triggers effectively select on p V T given that muons are not included in the online E miss T calculation and they perform more efficiently than the single-muon triggers in the analysis phase space. Events are required to have exactly one high-p T tight electron or muon, and no additional loose leptons. In the electron sub-channel an additional selection of E miss T &gt; 30 GeV is applied to reduce the background from multi-jet production. Events are categorised into the signal region (SR) or into a control region enriched in W + HF events (W + HF CR) using selections on the invariant mass of the two b-tagged jets (m bb ), and on the reconstructed mass of a semi-leptonically decaying top-quark candidate (m top ). The latter is calculated as the invariant mass of the lepton, the reconstructed neutrino 3 and the b-tagged jet that yields the lowest mass value.In the electron sub-channel, events are required to satisfy a logical OR of single-electron triggers with identification and isolation criteria looser than those used in the offline analysis, and p T thresholds that started at 24 GeV in 2015 and increased to 26 GeV in 2016 and 2017.

        <p>The background processes involving W or Z boson decays into leptons (including those in which the W boson arises from a topquark decay) are collectively referred to in the following as electroweak (EW) backgrounds and were simulated as described above. In contrast, the multi-jet background is estimated in all three channels using data-driven methods. In both the 0-and 2-lepton channels, the multi-jet contribution is estimated from template fits to data, using the simulated samples to model the EW backgrounds and a functional form to model the multi-jet background. The template fit is performed using a variable that provides significant discrimination between the multi-jet and EW processes, with any selection on that variable removed. In the 0-lepton channel, min[ φ(E miss T , jets)] is used, and in the 2-lepton channel, the dilepton mass distribution is used for the case where the charges of the lepton candidates have the same sign, assuming the multijet contribution is symmetric for opposite-and same-sign lepton charges. In both cases, it is found that the multi-jet contribution is sufficiently small that it can be neglected in the global likelihood fit without having any impact on the extracted signal.The background processes involving W or Z boson decays into leptons (including those in which the W boson arises from a topquark decay) are collectively referred to in the following as electroweak (EW) backgrounds and were simulated as described above.

        <p>The multi-jet background is found to be non-negligible in the 1-lepton channel and is estimated separately in the electron and muon sub-channels, and in the 2-and 3-jet categories. In each category, a template fit to the transverse mass distribution of the W boson candidate is performed, which offers the clearest discrimination between the multi-jet and EW processes, to extract the multi-jet yield. The template used for the multi-jet contribution is obtained from data in a control region after subtraction of the residual EW contribution, based on MC predictions, while the template for the EW contribution in the signal region is obtained directly from MC predictions. The control region is enriched in multi-jet events that are kinematically close to the corresponding signal region but not overlapping with it, and is defined by applying the nominal selection but inverting the stricter lepton isolation requirements. To increase the statistical precision of the data-driven estimate, the number of required b-tagged jets is reduced from two to one in the multi-jet enriched control region. The template fit applied in the signal region determines the normalisation of the multi-jet contribution, while the shape of the BDT discriminant (or of other relevant observables) is obtained using a control region analogously to the m W T template. Both the normalisation and shape derived for the BDT discriminant are then used in the global likelihood fit. The multi-jet contribution in the 2-jet category is found to be 1.9% (2.8%) of the total background contribution in the electron (muon) sub-channel, while in the 3-jet category it is found to be 0.2% (0.4%).

The approximate size of the uncertainty in the tagging efficiency is 2% for b-jets, 10% for c-jets and 40% for light-flavour jets. Additional uncertainties are considered in the extrapolation of the b-jet efficiency calibration to jets with p T &gt; 300 GeV and in the misidentification of hadronically decaying τ -leptons as b-jets. The uncertainties in the jet energy scale and resolution are based on their respective measurements [60,110].

The overall normalisations and associated uncertainties for the background processes are taken from the currently most accurate calculations as detailed in Table 4, apart from the main backgrounds whose normalisations are left unconstrained (floated) in the global likelihood fit. The additional systematic uncertainties in the acceptance differences and in the shapes are derived either from particle-level comparisons between nominal and alternative simulated samples, or from comparisons with data in control regions. The particle-level comparisons are cross-checked with detectorlevel simulations whenever these are available, and good agreement is found.

Their overall normalisation, separately in the 2-and 3-jet categories, is free to float in the global likelihood fit.

This result is combined with previous results based on all the Run 1 data collected at centre-of-mass energies of 7 TeV and 8 TeV. An excess over the expected SM background is observed, with a significance of 4.9 standard deviations compared with an expectation of 5.1. The measured signal strength relative to the SM expectation is found to be μ bb V H = 0.98 ± 0.14(stat.) +0.17 -0.16 (syst.).
