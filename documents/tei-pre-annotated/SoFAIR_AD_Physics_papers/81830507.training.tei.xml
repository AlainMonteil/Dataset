        <p>We find simple expressions for the kinematic numerators of one-loop MHV amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and supergravity, at any multiplicity. The gauge-theory numerators satisfy the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) duality between color and kinematics, so that the gravity numerators are simply the square of the gauge-theory ones. The duality holds because the numerators can be written in terms of structure constants of a kinematic algebra, which is familiar from the BCJ organization of self-dual gauge theory and gravity. The close connection that we find between one-loop amplitudes in the self-dual case and in the maximally supersymmetric case is reminiscent of the dimension-shifting formula. The starting point for arriving at our expressions is the dimensional reduction of ten-dimensional amplitudes obtained in the field-theory limit of open superstrings.We find simple expressions for the kinematic numerators of one-loop MHV amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and supergravity, at any multiplicity.

        <p>Recent progress on scattering amplitudes has sought to describe these quantities in a variety of manners, which highlight different properties and symmetries of a theory, or connections between different theories. The Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) duality between color and kinematics [1] resulted from exploring the connections between amplitudes in gauge theory and in gravity. Refs. [1,2] found that a gauge-theory amplitude can often be expressed such that its kinematic dependence closely mirrors its color dependence. The kinematic numerators corresponding to trivalent diagrams are known as BCJ numerators when they satisfy this "duality" between color and kinematics. Their most remarkable property is that gravity amplitudes can be obtained in a simple manner from the gauge-theory ones by substituting color factors for another copy of BCJ numerators. This procedure to construct gravity amplitudes has led to great advances in the study of the ultraviolet behaviour of supergravity theories [2][3][4][5][6][7].Recent progress on scattering amplitudes has sought to describe these quantities in a variety of manners, which highlight different properties and symmetries of a theory, or connections between different theories.

        <p>The BCJ duality remains a conjecture at loop level, and the principles at work are poorly understood. Most loop-level results have followed from an ad hoc approach to the construction of BCJ numerators, starting with an ansatz and fixing it by unitarity cuts. The difficulty in extending this approach to higher loops is a major obstacle at present. In this work, we bring together two lines of research which explore the mathematical structure underlying the BCJ duality. As a result, we find simple and suggestive expressions for MHV amplitudes at one loop, in maximally supersymmetric theories.The BCJ duality remains a conjecture at loop level, and the principles at work are poorly understood.

        <p>One line of research on the principles behind BCJ is based on string theory. Amplitudes of various field theories can be obtained in the infinite tension limit (α → 0) of superstring amplitudes [8]. The meta-structure provided by string theory has already led to many insights and practical applications in the study of field-theory amplitudes, starting with the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) relations between gauge and gravity amplitudes at tree level [9], and the BCJ story is no exception. The color-kinematics duality in gauge theory leads to linear relations between tree-level color-ordered amplitudes, known as BCJ relations [1]. The first proof of these relations was based on the monodromy properties of integrals appearing in string amplitudes [10,11]. Moreover, the first explicit local expressions for BCJ numerators at tree level were derived in ref. [12] from the pure-spinor formulation of superstring theory [13]. This line of work has been streamlined and generalized in the framework of multiparticle superfields [14,15] which has led to important insights on the BCJ conjecture at loop level [16,17]. These building blocks also allow one to determine one-loop amplitudes of the ten-dimensional open superstring [18], or at least their BRSTinvariant subsector which is unaffected by the gauge anomaly [19,20]. Constraining the helicities of their four-dimensional reduction to MHV configurations is used as a driving force to derive the all-multiplicity BCJ numerators presented in this work.One line of research on the principles behind BCJ is based on string theory.

        <p>Another line of research on BCJ is based on the direct search for a "kinematic algebra" which mirrors the color Lie algebra, making the duality between color and kinematics manifest. Such a kinematic algebra has indeed been found for the self-dual sector of gauge theory and gravity [21]. At tree level, while amplitudes in the self-dual theories vanish, this structure is essentially preserved for the closely-related MHV amplitudes. At one JHEP01(2016)171 loop, the amplitudes in the (non-supersymmetric) self-dual theories do not vanish, and the kinematic algebra allows for the construction of BCJ numerators for all-plus amplitudes, and also for the closely related one-minus amplitudes [22]. These are the only two families of loop-level amplitudes for which explicit BCJ numerators were known for any multiplicity. Our results add one more all-multiplicity family, that of MHV amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric gauge theory and gravity. While five-point BCJ numerators [23] and a procedure to implicitly determine them for higher multiplicities [24] were known, we present here closed-form and remarkably simple expressions for any multiplicity. A notable feature of our BCJ numerators is that the only poles appearing in them can be traced back to reference spinors of polarization vectors; our BCJ numerators (4.20) are manifestly local after factoring out simple prefactors.Another line of research on BCJ is based on the direct search for a "kinematic algebra" which mirrors the color Lie algebra, making the duality between color and kinematics manifest.

        <p>We show that there is a direct connection between one-loop MHV amplitudes obtained from string theory, and the kinematic algebra of the self-dual theories. Our numerators (4.20), provided by the field-theory limit of strings, can be conveniently presented in terms of kinematic structure constants. We identify a prescription X , which maps the kinematic structure constants in the self-dual numerators to our BCJ numerators for MHV amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric theories. This connection is reminiscent of the result of ref. [25], which gives one-loop all-plus amplitudes in non-supersymmetric gauge theory and gravity (which correspond to the self-dual sector) in terms of a dimension-shifting rule applied to the integrand of one-loop MHV amplitudes in the maximally supersymmetric theories.

        <p>The BCJ duality, or color-kinematics duality, states that the kinematic dependence of a gauge-theory amplitude can be expressed so that it has the same algebraic properties as the color dependence [1,2]. In order to present it precisely, we first write down the N -point amplitude at a given loop order L in terms of a sum over trivalent diagrams, i.e. diagrams with cubic vertices, For each trivalent diagram Γ i , S i is the symmetry factor (to avoid overcounting), and P -1 k,i are the propagators, which generically depend on loop momenta j . The color factors c i can be straightforwardly read off from the graph Γ i by dressing each cubic vertex with a structure constant f abc of the gauge group, and n i are kinematic numerators depending on polarizations and (internal or external) momenta. It is clearly always possible to write down the amplitude in this manner, as four-point vertices can be decomposed according to the color structures and absorbed into the trivalent diagrams by changing n i .

Thus our representation of SYM amplitudes differs significantly from other forms in four dimensions, e.g. those obtained using generalized unitarity [61,62,80], though it should be possible to show their equivalence by reductions of higher-gon integrals [81]. It also takes a different form from previous BCJ representations at five [23] and six points [24]; most notably, the only kinematic poles of our numerators are introduced by the polarization vectors.Although the explicit form of the numerators is worked out here only for the MHV case, we emphasize that the diagrammatic structure of our representation as derived from string theory is dimension-agnostic: no integral reductions have been performed to eliminate certain m-gon integrals or loop momenta in the numerators, and the structure extends to arbitrary helicities and higher dimensions.

        <p>In this appendix, we describe in detail the Jacobi identities satisfied by our one-loop MHV numerators and give a proof of eq. (4.21). A Jacobi identity involves four lines (internal or external) connected by a propagator, and the three diagrams in the identity correspond to the three different channels that the propagator may represent (see figure 1). Now, a generic one-loop diagram is a p-gon with a tree attached to each corner. As elaborated in section 4.3, it is helpful to distinguish Jacobi identities which affect propagators in treelevel subdiagrams from those relating p-gons and (p ± 1)-gons as in figure 7. For the former type, the Jacobi identities follow trivially from the fact that X is a spinor bracket, as in the self-dual theory, since our prescription X preserves the X-structure of the trees. For the latter type, however, the Jacobi identities are non-trivial because the prescription X changes the X-structure of the p-gon, and we focus on this type of identity. As a warm up, let us first consider the one-loop all-plus numerators, which have the form the Jacobi identity in figure 7 follows fromIn this appendix, we describe in detail the Jacobi identities satisfied by our one-loop MHV numerators and give a proof of eq.
