        <p>Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that reside at the centres of galaxies can inject vast amounts of energy into the surrounding gas and are thought to be a viable mechanism to quench star formation in massive galaxies. Here, we study the 10 9-12.5 M stellar mass central galaxy population of the IllustrisTNG simulation, specifically the TNG100 and TNG300 volumes at z = 0, and show how the three components -SMBH, galaxy, and circumgalactic medium (CGM) -are interconnected in their evolution. We find that gas entropy is a sensitive diagnostic of feedback injection. In particular, we demonstrate how the onset of the low-accretion black hole (BH) feedback mode, realized in the IllustrisTNG model as a kinetic, BH-driven wind, leads not only to star formation quenching at stellar masses 10 10.5 M but also to a change in thermodynamic properties of the (non-star-forming) gas, both within the galaxy and beyond. The IllustrisTNG kinetic feedback from SMBHs increases the average gas entropy, within the galaxy and in the CGM, lengthening typical gas cooling times from 10-100 Myr to 1-10 Gyr, effectively ceasing ongoing star formation and inhibiting radiative cooling and future gas accretion. In practice, the same active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback channel is simultaneously 'ejective' and 'preventative' and leaves an imprint on the temperature, density, entropy, and cooling times also in the outer reaches of the gas halo, up to distances of several hundred kiloparsecs. In the IllustrisTNG model, a long-lasting quenching state can occur for a heterogeneous CGM, whereby the hot and dilute CGM gas of quiescent galaxies contains regions of low-entropy gas with short cooling times.Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that reside at the centres of galaxies can inject vast amounts of energy into the surrounding gas and are thought to be a viable mechanism to quench star formation in massive galaxies.

        <p>While for the quenching of satellite galaxies a host of physical 'environmental' mechanisms have been proposed, e.g. gas removal by ram pressure (Gunn &amp; Gott 1972;McCarthy et al. 2008;Zinger et al. 2018) or tidal forces (Gnedin 2003;Villalobos, De Lucia &amp; Murante 2014), the processes that terminate the formation of new stars in the central galaxy population must originate from within the galaxy itself (Peng et al. 2010;Liu et al. 2019). In this study, we focus on central galaxies and thus exclude the effects of 'environmental' processes in the transition of galaxies from star forming to quenched.While for the quenching of satellite galaxies a host of physical 'environmental' mechanisms have been proposed, e.g. gas removal by ram pressure (Gunn &amp; Gott 1972;McCarthy et al. 2008;Zinger et al. 2018) or tidal forces (Gnedin 2003;Villalobos, De Lucia &amp; Murante 2014), the processes that terminate the formation of new stars in the central galaxy population must originate from within the galaxy itself (Peng et al. 2010;Liu et al. 2019).

        <p>For quenching of central galaxies, energy injection (feedback) is often invoked as the main driver, either from supernovae (SNe) or from the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that reside in the centres of galaxies. SMBHs are found in galaxies at very high redshifts (Bañados et al. 2018) as well as in our local Universe (e.g. Reines &amp; Volonteri 2015). When accreting mass, SMBHs can inject energy into their host galaxies and are known as active galactic nuclei (AGNs).For quenching of central galaxies, energy injection (feedback) is often invoked as the main driver, either from supernovae (SNe) or from the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that reside in the centres of galaxies.

        <p>While the energy feedback from stars and SNe can be an important factor in shaping the evolution of low-mass galaxies and galaxies in general (Dekel &amp; Silk 1986;Hopkins, Quataert &amp; Murray 2011), from a theoretical perspective it is widely accepted that, in galaxies at and above the ∼ 3 × 10 10 M stellar mass transition scale, AGN feedback plays an important role in regulating star formation and possibly in quenching galaxies (Di Matteo, Springel &amp; Hernquist 2005;Silk 2013;Somerville &amp; Davé 2015;Penny et al. 2018). More specifically, theoretical studies with numerical cosmological simulations and semi-analytical models that follow galaxy evolution with and without AGN feedback (e.g. McCarthy et al. 2011;Dubois et al. 2016;Kaviraj et al. 2017) show that the quenching of entire populations of galaxies in a manner consistent with observations is only possible when AGN feedback is included. This is especially true at the high-mass end, where feedback from SNe and massive stars is ineffective in shutting off star formation (Bower et al. 2006;Weinberger et al. 2017;Choi et al. 2018). As such, AGN feedback is a critical component of most galaxy formation models in both semi-analytical models and large-volume simulations (Vogelsberger et al. 2014a;Schaye et al. 2015;Bower et al. 2017;McCarthy et al. 2017;Weinberger et al. 2017).While the energy feedback from stars and SNe can be an important factor in shaping the evolution of low-mass galaxies and galaxies in general (Dekel &amp; Silk 1986;Hopkins, Quataert &amp; Murray 2011), from a theoretical perspective it is widely accepted that, in galaxies at and above the ∼ 3 × 10 10 M stellar mass transition scale, AGN feedback plays an important role in regulating star formation and possibly in quenching galaxies (Di Matteo, Springel &amp; Hernquist 2005;Silk 2013;Somerville &amp; Davé 2015;Penny et al. 2018).

        <p>From an observational perspective, the association of AGN feedback to the quenching of star formation is more nuanced. On the one hand, AGN feedback may not account for quenching in all massive galaxies and other secular processes have been invoked to explain the quenched population of central galaxies at the high-mass end (Smethurst et al. 2016). On the other hand, while there are strong observational indications that AGN feedback can lead to quenching (Hickox et al. 2009;Cheung et al. 2016), strong AGN outflows have also been observed in massive star-forming galaxies, at intermediate redshifts (Förster Schreiber et al. 2014;Genzel et al. 2014). Yet, the existence of observed scaling relations between the large-scale properties of the host galaxies -e.g. luminosity, stellar mass, and stellar velocity dispersion -and the mass of the SMBH suggests that the evolution of the latter and its host galaxy are intertwined (Kormendy &amp; Ho 2013;Heckman &amp; Best 2014, and references therein).From an observational perspective, the association of AGN feedback to the quenching of star formation is more nuanced.

        <p>Though SMBHs comprise a small fraction of the mass and volume of a galaxy, their effects can be seen and measured in the galaxy as well as out to hundreds of kiloparsecs in the surrounding gas (Bîrzan et al. 2004;Fabian 2012). In galaxy clusters, for example, the energy from black hole (BH) feedback is known to be a key player in compensating the high cooling rates inferred within the intracluster medium (ICM) and in setting the thermodynamic conditions in the central regions of the cluster (McNamara &amp; Nulsen 2007;Böhringer &amp; Werner 2010;Prasad, Sharma &amp; Babul 2015).Though SMBHs comprise a small fraction of the mass and volume of a galaxy, their effects can be seen and measured in the galaxy as well as out to hundreds of kiloparsecs in the surrounding gas (Bîrzan et al. 2004;Fabian 2012).

        <p>Various observations indicate that the thermodynamics of the gaseous atmospheres surrounding massive galaxies (i.e. not just those at the centres of the most massive clusters) are also regulated by the energy injected by black holes (Nulsen et al. 2009;Werner et al. 2019). In atmospheres heated in such a manner, the cooling and accretion of gas on to the galaxy can be suppressed and thus future epochs of star formation in the central galaxy can also be suppressed. Through this 'preventative' feedback (Somerville &amp; Davé 2015), the AGN not only quenches the galaxy but can maintain its quenched state for long periods of time.Various observations indicate that the thermodynamics of the gaseous atmospheres surrounding massive galaxies (i.e. not just those at the centres of the most massive clusters) are also regulated by the energy injected by black holes (Nulsen et al. 2009;Werner et al. 2019).

        <p>Observations of AGN suggest two main modes of activity: AGN in which the mass accretion rates is high, exceeding a few per cent of the Eddington rate, are dominated by radiation in IR, optical, UV all the way to X-ray wavelengths, originating from the luminous gas in the black hole accretion disc (Crenshaw et al. 2010;Villar-Martín et al. 2011;Woo et al. 2016;Rupke, Gültekin &amp; Veilleux 2017). This energy deposition mode, mediated by radiation-driven winds, is often called the 'quasar' mode. In the other case, linked to low accretion rates, mechanical energy is deposited in the surrounding gas, often resulting in radio jets or large synchrotron emitting plasma lobes. This feedback mode is often referred to as the 'radio' or 'mechanical' mode (McNamara &amp; Nulsen 2007;Fabian 2012;Shin, Woo &amp; Mulchaey 2016). From an observational perspective, a general picture has emerged whereby the first mode of feedback, the high-accretion channel, is responsible for triggering the quenching of the galaxies, while the second mode, at low accretion rates, is often referred to as a 'maintenance' mode (Mathews &amp; Brighenti 2003;Best et al. 2005;Rangel et al. 2014). Still, this separation remains uncertain and so does the nature of the feedback for quenching star formation; i.e. whether the energy injection from the SMBHs effectively heats up or vacates the gas within the galaxies and their surroundings and how these phenomena complement one another at different mass scales and cosmic epochs.Observations of AGN suggest two main modes of activity: AGN in which the mass accretion rates is high, exceeding a few per cent of the Eddington rate, are dominated by radiation in IR, optical, UV all the way to X-ray wavelengths, originating from the luminous gas in the black hole accretion disc (Crenshaw et al. 2010;Villar-Martín et al. 2011;Woo et al. 2016;Rupke, Gültekin &amp; Veilleux 2017).

        <p>While there has been extensive study of the physical processes that connect the accretion of gas on to the SMBHs to their energy output (e.g. Yuan &amp; Narayan 2014) the subject is still not fully understood, especially when it comes to the coupling of the feedback energy to the surrounding gas. Complicating matters further, some galaxies have been found with signatures of both extended radio emission and a bright X-ray source (Yuan et al. 2008;Coziol et al. 2017). The murkiness surrounding the basic physical process which takes place on the BH scale (King &amp; Nixon 2015), and the challenges of sharing the output energy with the gas over large scales (McNamara &amp; Nulsen 2007), makes modelling AGN feedback in galaxy simulations particularly challenging.While there has been extensive study of the physical processes that connect the accretion of gas on to the SMBHs to their energy output (e.g. Yuan &amp; Narayan 2014) the subject is still not fully understood, especially when it comes to the coupling of the feedback energy to the surrounding gas.

        <p>Simply injecting the right amount of energy, which in itself is uncertain, is not enough. The details of modelling AGN feedback are also quite important, as the comparison between the Illustris (Vogelsberger et al. 2014a,b) and the IllustrisTNG (The Next Generation; Marinacci et al. 2018;Naiman et al. 2018;Nelson et al. 2018a;Pillepich et al. 2018b;Springel et al. 2018) simulation results clearly shows. Though very similar in the overall energy injected by the AGN, the differences in implementation of the feedback in the two models led to several key differences. The 'bubble model' (Sijacki et al. 2007) employed in the 
            <rs type="software">Illustris</rs> suite and parametrized as in Vogelsberger et al. (2013) (but see Henden et al. 2018) resulted in too-low gas fractions in galaxy groups and low-mass galaxy clusters due to an overefficient expulsion of the high density gas (Genel et al. 2014), while at the same time generating too-high stellar masses in the central galaxies. These issues have been resolved and the overall agreement with observations has improved with the new AGN model (Weinberger et al. 2017) of the IllustrisTNG simulations. Another example of this is found in Davies et al. (2020) who compared the halo gas-fractions in the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE (Schaye et al. 2015) simulations: differences in the implementations of the AGN feedback resulted in a very different halo gas content for halo masses of ∼ 10 12.5 M and below. Future observational measures of this property, in this mass range, will be a powerful tool to discriminate between various models.

        <p>In this study, we put forward a comprehensive description of the role AGN feedback plays in setting the physical and thermodynamic conditions of the gaseous component in the galaxy and in the CGM within the framework of the IllustrisTNG simulations (hereafter TNG) and the AGN feedback model therein implemented. We study the entire (resolved) galaxy population afforded by the TNG100 and TNG300 simulations (galaxy stellar masses in the 10 9-12.5 M range) and focus exclusively on central galaxies at z = 0.In this study, we put forward a comprehensive description of the role AGN feedback plays in setting the physical and thermodynamic conditions of the gaseous component in the galaxy and in the CGM within the framework of the IllustrisTNG simulations (hereafter TNG) and the AGN feedback model therein implemented.

(2020) have demonstrated a close connection between the suppression of star formation in massive galaxies and the BH feedback in its kinetic mode, indicating the crucial role played by the latter in establishing the quenched population in the TNG simulations. The phenomena emerging from the underlying effective theory for galaxy formation include the appearance of a population of quenched galaxies also at intermediate/high redshifts (Weinberger et al. 2018;Donnari et al. 2019) and the good match of the shapes and widths of the red sequence and blue cloud in comparison to Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies (Nelson et al. 2018a). This base level of realism in the properties of the simulated galaxy population enables us to gain insight into the workings of AGN feedback in the real Universe.Within the TNG framework, earlier works by Weinberger et al.

        <p>We take these notions further by examining the importance of the AGN energy injections in TNG, particularly the kinetic BH-driven winds, in setting the thermodynamic state of the gas in the galaxy itself and beyond in the CGM. As a case in point, Nelson et al. (2018b) have shown how this feedback model affects the abundance of highly ionized oxygen atoms, O VI, which are an observational tracer of the thermodynamic state of the CGM.We take these notions further by examining the importance of the AGN energy injections in TNG, particularly the kinetic BH-driven winds, in setting the thermodynamic state of the gas in the galaxy itself and beyond in the CGM.

Once seeded, BHs can grow by accreting gas from their close vicinity, the 'feedback region', which also defines the gas cells into which feedback energy is deposited. The size of the feedback region in the z = 0 snapshots is of order a few kiloparsecs: ∼ 2.2 kpc in TNG100 and ∼ 3.6 kpc in TNG300 on average. In addition, BH-BH mergers occur whenever one BH is within the 'feedback region' of the other (Sijacki et al. 2007). The BHs are 'pinned' to the local minimum of the potential field, which in most cases coincides with the global minimum of its host halo.BHs are formed in the simulation based on the host-halo relationship (Di Matteo et al. 2008;Sijacki, Springel &amp; Haehnelt 2009): a BH is seeded in any friends-of-friends (FoF) halo whose mass exceeds 7.3 × 10 10 M (if the halo does not already possess a BH), with an initial seed mass of 6.2 × 10 6 M .

        <p>The theoretical treatment of AGN feedback accounts for two modes of energy injection, set by the accretion rate of matter on to the BH (Begelman 2014). The high accretion mode or thermal mode is associated with efficient accretion through a disc and feedback in this state is implemented as an injection of thermal energy into the surrounding gas. The low accretion mode or kinetic mode occurs at lower accretion rates in which the accretion disc is in a radiatively inefficient state (Blandford &amp; Begelman 1999;Yuan &amp; Narayan 2014), and results in a kinetic injection of energy. Two feedback modes acting at different BH accretion rates have been called, traditionally, the 'quasar' and 'radio' modes, respectively. However, within the TNG model the kinetic mode is distinct from the observed jets that have been typically associated with radio galaxies at the centres of clusters. Hence, in what follows we label the two modes as the thermal and kinetic modes.The theoretical treatment of AGN feedback accounts for two modes of energy injection, set by the accretion rate of matter on to the BH (Begelman 2014).

The ratio of the two energies versus the BH mass is shown in the Fig. 1(a) inset. The central BH is chosen as the most massive BH particle in the galaxy.

        <p>These figures emphasize some important features of the AGN model. For all galaxies, more energy is injected in the thermal mode channel. In low-mass galaxies, the dominant mass growth channel for the SMBH is through the high-accretion thermal mode. Since at any time Ėhigh ∝ ṀBH , the cumulative energy will naturally be proportional to the total BH mass. Once a BH is seeded at a mass of 10 6.07 M , and starts giving off energy, we see a tight one-to-one relation between E high and M BH form4 (Fig. 1a). The convolution of this tight relation with the M BH -stellar mass relation (see inset in Fig. 1b) leads to a similar relation with stellar mass, albeit with more scatter.These figures emphasize some important features of the AGN model.

        <p>Examining the distribution of BH mass versus stellar mass (in the inset of Fig. 1b) we see a concentration of BH masses at ∼ 10 6 M , close to the initial BH seed mass, found within low-mass galaxies and another concentration at M BH 10 7.5 M , with a dearth of BHs in between. This distribution most likely arises due to the regulation of BH mass growth by the SN feedback process (see also Dubois et al. 2015;Anglés-Alcázar et al. 2017;Bower et al. 2017;Habouzit, Volonteri &amp; Dubois 2017, though we note that these studies do not address the TNG model). Pillepich et al. (2018a) show with simulation run with variations of the TNG model, that in the lowmass galaxies, SN feedback limits the amount of available gas for BH accretion, keeping the BH mass close to the initial seed mass (though the BH can still grow by BH-BH mergers). As the galaxy grows in mass and its potential well deepens, the effectiveness of SN feedback diminishes, and the BH grows quickly to higher masses, concentrating at roughly M BH ∼ 10 8.3 M where the kinetic mode feedback becomes important and self-regulates the further growth of the BH. McAlpine et al.

        <p>The picture for the kinetic mode is more complex: 60 per cent of all galaxies in the z = 0 sample have experienced no kinetic mode feedback at all throughout the history of the (simulated) universe. These are invariably of low-BH mass M BH &lt; 10 8 M , or 10 10.5 M in stellar mass. In this mass range, the threshold χ to be in the kinetic mode is very low, implying that the required accretion conditions are never satisfied.

        <p>The two 'branches' in the kinetic mode energy versus the BH mass relation of Fig. 1(a) come about from the distribution of BH masses mentioned earlier, in which low-mass BHs are concentrated close to the seed mass and most of the high-mass BHs are found at masses of 10 7.5-8.5 M . If the BH mass is low when it experiences its first kinetic mode injection event, it will progress on the shallow-slope left branch. If the BH experiences its first injection event only after it grows to the high-mass group, it will progress on the steeper, right branch.The two 'branches' in the kinetic mode energy versus the BH mass relation of Fig. 1(a) come about from the distribution of BH masses mentioned earlier, in which low-mass BHs are concentrated close to the seed mass and most of the high-mass BHs are found at masses of 10 7.5-8.5 M .

        <p>Due to the scarcity of injection events at low masses, the energy input is quite low, but rises steeply with BH mass as the likelihood of being in the kinetic mode grows. A transitional mass scale appears at M BH = 10 8.3 or 10 10.5 M in stellar mass, where the energy injected in the kinetic mode becomes comparable to that of the thermal mode, with a typical ratio of ∼0.3 (see inset in Fig. 1a). Beyond this mass scale, the relation with M BH is also linear, but with a larger scatter Here and throughout the paper, we show the central galaxies of the TNG300 simulation (excluding backsplash galaxies at z = 0 -see Section 2.4). The black contours show the distribution of the galaxy population. Roughly 60 per cent of all galaxies in the depicted mass range have never had a kinetic feedback event and these have been placed by hand on a flat relation in the bottom of the plots. compared to the thermal mode relation. In SMBHs above this mass scale, the gas accretion is self-regulated by kinetic mode feedback, and the SMBHs experience mostly epochs of kinetic mode feedback.

        <p>The transitional mass scale is set in part by the parameters of the AGN model (e.g. equation 2), but is also influenced by other physical processes in the TNG model convolved with the coupled growth of galaxies and their BHs across cosmic epochs. For example, in a simulation run with the TNG model in which SN feedback was turned off, the stellar mass transitional mass scale occurs at a lower value. This most likely occurs since the mass growth of the BHs is no longer regulated by stellar feedback and thus massive BHs (with a propensity for kinetic mode feedback) are found in galaxies of lower stellar mass, when compared to the fiducial simulations.The transitional mass scale is set in part by the parameters of the AGN model (e.g. equation 2), but is also influenced by other physical processes in the TNG model convolved with the coupled growth of galaxies and their BHs across cosmic epochs.

        <p>As we show in this study, this mass scale, marking the onset of the kinetic feedback is a major determinant of the properties of the galaxies and their surrounding atmospheres (see also Terrazas et al. 2020) and is also found in the distributions of f Edd and AGN occupation fractions (Habouzit et al. 2019), despite it being subdominant in terms of overall energy output compared to the thermal mode.As we show in this study, this mass scale, marking the onset of the kinetic feedback is a major determinant of the properties of the galaxies and their surrounding atmospheres (see also Terrazas et al. 2020) and is also found in the distributions of f Edd and AGN occupation fractions (Habouzit et al. 2019), despite it being subdominant in terms of overall energy output compared to the thermal mode.</p>
        <p>Although it supplies most of the feedback energy, the thermal mode appears to be relatively ineffective. This is likely due to the fact that the thermal energy is deposited in a region close to the BH which is usually comprised of dense, star-forming gas. The injected energy is then (1) radiated away very efficiently, since cooling processes scale with ∝ρ 2 , or (2) if the gas is star forming, it is governed by an effective equation of state (see Section 2.3) which will set an artificial temperature regardless of the amount of injected thermal energy (Weinberger et al. 2018). Since kinetic energy is agnostic to both radiative cooling and the equation of state of the gas, the kinetic mode can have a larger affect on the gas even if its total energy injection is considerably lower.Although it supplies most of the feedback energy, the thermal mode appears to be relatively ineffective.

        <p>The rightmost system in the lower mass, first part of the figure, captures a bipolar high-entropy outflow originating from the central region of the galaxy. The outflow is hotter than the surrounding gas, but of similar density to its surroundings. The source of this outflow may be stellar/SN feedback, thermal mode or kinetic mode AGN feedback, or some combination of all three. The stellar mass of this system is found below the transitional mass scale of 10 10.5 M , and its BH mass, M BH = 10 7.6 M , is likewise below the threshold where the kinetic mode has become comparable to the thermal mode. However, we have confirmed that this BH has indeed experienced kinetic feedback injection events in its history, with a cumulative injected kinetic energy of ∼ 10 58 erg, which is relatively high compared to most BHs of this mass (see Fig. 1). Nelson et al. (2019b) carried out an extensive study of such outflows in the TNG50 simulation (the smaller volume/higher resolution run of the TNG project) showing that these outflows also originate from the action of the kinetic mode AGN feedback. Even though each kinetic feedback energy injection event is assigned a random direction, the resulting outflows follow the path of least resistance and form collimated outflows perpendicular to the galactic disc. While the cooling time in the outflow is quite long, 1-10 Gyr (see bottom panel), the cooling time in the extended gas disc is of only of order 10 Myr. So even as the AGN is pushing gas out of the galaxy, more gas can be accreted to take its place.

        <p>The important role that AGN feedback plays in quenching the star formation of its host galaxy within the framework of the TNG physical model has been studied previously. For example, Nelson et al. (2018a) showed that the TNG model reproduces the galaxy colour bimodality, with the transition stellar mass scale found at ∼ 10 10.5 M as in observations. Weinberger et al. (2018) demonstrated that the onset of quenching occurs thanks to the kinetic mode feedback, and Terrazas et al. (2020) showed that the quenching of star formation follows once the cumulative energy injection of the kinetic mode exceeds the binding energy of the gas in a galaxy, leading to gas depletion. In what follows, we consider the quenching process as it relates to the conditions found in the gaseous components within the galaxy and beyond, in the CGM.

Galaxies with unresolved star formation, SFR = 0, are placed 'by-hand' in the band on the bottom of the plot. The pixels in the plot vary in size to include no more than 30 galaxies, with the colour corresponding to the median of the entropy or sSFR. Black contours show the distribution in the plane for all galaxies. The dashed line in (a) marks our fiducial sSFR threshold of 10 -11 yr -1 used to label star forming versus quenched galaxies. The blue and red contours in (b) each enclose 90 per cent of the star-forming/quenched population. The lowmass/low-entropy quenched population comprises roughly 15 per cent of the total quenched population and is discussed in Appendix B. numbers, the quenched population comprises 23 per cent of the total galaxy sample in TNG300 and 15 per cent of the TNG100 galaxy sample for the same stellar mass minimum of 10 9 M (see Section 2.4).</p>
        <p>We divide the z = 0 galaxy population into star-forming versus quenched galaxies by using an sSFR threshold of 10 -11 yr -1 to separate the two groups. This threshold is based on the bi-modal distributions of galaxies at z = 0 in observations (e.g. Brinchmann et al. 2004;Kauffmann et al. 2004;Wetzel et al. 2012), as well as simulations (e.g. Donnari et al. 2019, for the TNG suite).We divide the z = 0 galaxy population into star-forming versus quenched galaxies by using an sSFR threshold of 10 -11 yr -1 to separate the two groups.

        <p>The transition between the star-forming and quenched population is seen to correspond to a jump in the entropy of the galactic gas. This transition is more striking when displayed in the entropy-stellar mass plane (Fig. 4b) where the colour coding now shows the sSFR of the galaxy. The star-forming and quenched population each inhabit a distinct region in this plane, with the transition between the two occurring at the transitional stellar mass scale of 10 10-11 M , where the kinetic mode feedback becomes a significant source of energy, as seen in Fig. 1(b). Because the entropy of the gas scales as K ∝ Tn -2/3 , this separation may indicate that the gas within galaxies is depleted or heated up, or a combination of the two.The transition between the star-forming and quenched population is seen to correspond to a jump in the entropy of the galactic gas.

        <p>An interesting feature of Fig. 4(b) is the appearance of an entropy 'floor' for the low-mass galaxies and an entropy 'ceiling' seen in the high-mass galaxies. The existence of the entropy 'floor' is set by the physical model of the TNG simulation: in the simulation gas cannot cool below 10 4 K, and as specified in Section 2.3, cold gas with a number density above ∼ 0.1 cm -3 is deemed star forming and placed on an effective EOS and thus is no longer part of our analysis. Combining these two values in equation ( 7) results in a minimal entropy value for the gas of log K/( keV cm 2 ) -2.4. There is no straightforward physical reason for the existence of a limiting entropy value, and indeed, when examining the entropy of the inner and outer CGM (see Fig. 6) we see that there is no maximal value for the entropy of the gas. In the outer CGM of high-mass galaxies, where the gravitational potential of the host halo determines the gas entropy, it is seen to rise with host mass. The entropy limit seen in the galactic gas may be a matter of buoyancy -when the entropy of a gas element is higher than its surrounding, a buoyant force is exerted on it, accelerating it outward (Keller, Kruijssen &amp; Wadsley 2020), until it is no longer found within our prescribed radial distance limit r gal .An interesting feature of Fig. 4(b) is the appearance of an entropy 'floor' for the low-mass galaxies and an entropy 'ceiling' seen in the high-mass galaxies.

        <p>The classification of star-forming versus quenched galaxies is shown in Fig. 4(b), and in all subsequent figures, by the blue and red contours, each of which encloses 90 per cent of the starforming/quenched population, respectively. While there are some galaxies at the high-mass end which are considered to be star forming, their numbers are very small. However, we do find a non-negligible group of low-mass, low-entropy galaxies which are quenched, as marked by the red contour in the bottom-left corner. Though the size of the contour is not an indication of the size of this galaxy subsample, but rather their spread in stellar mass and entropy, we find that these objects comprise roughly 3.5 per cent of the total galaxy population and 15 per cent of the quenched population in TNG300 for stellar mass ≥ 10 9 M (in TNG100, a similar population comprises 0.5 per cent of the total galaxy population and 3.4 per cent of the quenched population).

        <p>The decisive role of the kinetic mode feedback in this transition is all the more evident when the galaxy entropy is displayed versus the mass of the central black hole, as shown in Fig. 5(a). The transition from star forming to quenched, and the corresponding jump in entropy occurs very sharply at the transitional black hole mass of M BH ∼ 10 8.3 M found in Section 2.2.1 (Fig. 1a). We speculate that the bi-modality in BH masses, seen earlier in the inset of Fig. 1(b), is also evident in this figure. The cause for the bi-modality is most likely the regulation of the BH growth by SN feedback in low-mass galaxies (see Section 2.2.1 for details). The distribution of z = 0 TNG300 galaxies in the entropy-M BH plane, with sSFR shown by colour (a), shows that the jump in galactic gas entropy and star-forming quenching occur at a sharp BH mass scale, where the energy injection of kinetic mode feedback becomes comparable to the thermal mode. This can be seen in (b) where the entropy is shown versus the ratio between the cumulative energy injected by the two accretion modes, coloured by sSFR as before. The vertical band of points on the left of the plot are galaxies that have not experienced a single kinetic mode injection event, and are given a random value &lt;10 -7 for the ratio. Red and blue contours enclose 90 per cent of the star-forming/quenched populations, respectively.

        <p>When the kinetic mode is responsible for more than a few per cent of the total energy output of the AGN, the entropy of the galactic gas jumps to much higher values and the host galaxy becomes quenched. The contribution of the kinetic mode to the total energy output is always sub-dominant, yet even this small contribution has an appreciable effect on the galaxy properties, which can extend even to the surrounding gas and leave its mark on the entire sub-halo CGM (see Fig. 6 and Section 3.4).When the kinetic mode is responsible for more than a few per cent of the total energy output of the AGN, the entropy of the galactic gas jumps to much higher values and the host galaxy becomes quenched.

As mentioned above and throughout the paper, we only consider the gas within galaxies and haloes that is not star forming when deriving an average gas temperature. While the (non-star-forming) gas within star-forming galaxies is cool, and close to the lower limit of 10 4 K (as seen in the low-mass galaxies shown in Fig. 3), in the majority of quenched population, the average gas temperature is as hot, or as much as 10 times hotter than, the virial temperature of the host halo. This shows that feedback processes inject additional energy into the gas beyond what is available through gravitational infall into the host halo.In the top left panel (Fig. 6a), we show the mean temperature of the galactic gas, normalized by the virial temperature T vir of the host halo, for the distribution of the galaxies in the entropy-stellar mass plane.

        <p>The kinetic mode feedback therefore not only heats the gas to beyond the virial temperature, it can remove it altogether to beyond r gal . This is especially true for the galaxies just at the 10 10.5 M mass scale. Of all galaxies affected by the kinetic mode feedback, these have the shallowest potential wells and their gas is most susceptible to the feedback. This result is complemented by the findings of Terrazas et al. (2020), who analysed the TNG100 simulation, and found that the shutdown of star formation occurred in galaxies in which the cumulative energy injected by the kinetic mode of the central BH exceeded the gravitational binding energy of the gas in the galaxy.The kinetic mode feedback therefore not only heats the gas to beyond the virial temperature, it can remove it altogether to beyond r gal .

        <p>Indeed, when examining galaxies of higher mass, we see that they still contain large amounts of gas, which is kept hot by the AGNs and thus maintaining their quenched state. This can be seen in the most massive galaxy shown in Fig. 3: a gaseous disc of density 0.01 cm -3 is found in the centre of the galaxy, with a temperature of ∼ 10 6 K, and cooling times of order several Gyr.Indeed, when examining galaxies of higher mass, we see that they still contain large amounts of gas, which is kept hot by the AGNs and thus maintaining their quenched state.

        <p>In Fig. 6(g), we examine the cooling time of the galactic gas, which naturally reflects the star-forming efficiency of the galactic gas. The value of the cooling time in the gas here and in Figs 6(h) and (i) appears to correlate strongly with the entropy (see also Davies et al. 2020). In star-forming galaxies, the cooling time is of order 10-100 Myr. For the quenched population, galaxies with high entropies of log K/( keV cm 2 ) ≥ 1 exhibit cooling times of 1-10 Gyr and above. This implies that the quenched state of these galaxies will be long lived since the gas cannot cool efficiently to form stars. Gas repletion from the CGM of these galaxies is even less likely, since the cooling time in the CGM is of order 30 Gyr and above for these galaxies, as can be seen in Fig. 6(h).In Fig. 6(g), we examine the cooling time of the galactic gas, which naturally reflects the star-forming efficiency of the galactic gas.

        <p>For quenched galaxies in the entropy range 1-10 keV cm 2 , the cooling times are of order several hundred Myr, but, as shown above, they contain very little gas. For a galaxy found at the peak of the quenched distribution, of mass 10 10.5 M and entropy of ∼ 10 keV cm 2 , the gas content is of order ∼ 10 8.5 M (Fig. 6d) with typical cooling times of order ∼ 300 Myr. Even if 10 per cent of the available gas would form stars over a single cooling time (with actual star formation efficiencies being of order ∼1 per cent per free-fall time, Krumholz, McKee &amp; Bland Hawthorn 2019), the fractional stellar mass increase would be ∼10 -3 . In comparison, the fractional stellar mass increase for a galaxy on the sSFR threshold over the same period would be roughly 3 times this value -thus even under these very favourable conditions, the galaxies are expected to remain quenched. The cooling times in the CGM of these galaxies is 10 Gyr (see Fig. 6 and Section 3.4) and is therefore not expected to be a significant source of gas accretion on to the galaxy.

        <p>The effects of the AGN are not limited to the gas within the galaxy but extend out to the surrounding CGM. We see this explicitly in Fig. 3, in the left-most galaxy of the first part, and the two right-most galaxies in the second part.

        <p>We find that the onset of the kinetic mode feedback at the transitional mass scale of ∼ 10 10.5 M leaves a distinct imprint in the gas entropy in the inner CGM and even in the outer regions of the gas halo, up to distances of several hundreds of kiloparsecs (Fig. 2). In the distribution of the outer CGM (Figs 6c, f, and i), we find that most galaxies lie on a relatively tight relation between stellar mass and entropy, set by the properties of the host halo. The orange dotted line shows the global entropy-halo mass relation one obtains in the adiabatic case (see equation 8). In essence, this line shows what the average entropy of the gas would be for a halo of a given mass and a gas fraction equal to the universal baryon fraction, affected only by the gravitational potential of the host halo. The distribution of galaxies roughly follows this relation, except in the 10 10.5 M region where a prominent 'bump' of higher entropy values is found, where kinetic mode feedback becomes important. This shows that the effects of the AGN feedback can leave an imprint that extends to the gaseous atmospheres around galaxies.We find that the onset of the kinetic mode feedback at the transitional mass scale of ∼ 10 10.5 M leaves a distinct imprint in the gas entropy in the inner CGM and even in the outer regions of the gas halo, up to distances of several hundreds of kiloparsecs (Fig. 2).

        <p>Furthermore, it is interesting to note that in the low-mass range (below the transitional mass scale), the average entropy of the outer CGM is found to be above the adiabatic prediction, whereas in the high-mass range, the entropy of the outer CGM lies closer to the adiabatic relation. An excess in entropy above the adiabatic relation indicates that additional energy, beyond the gravitational potential of the halo, is imparted into the gas. The injected energy affects both the thermodynamic properties of the gas, and the gas fraction in the halo by removing some of it.Furthermore, it is interesting to note that in the low-mass range (below the transitional mass scale), the average entropy of the outer CGM is found to be above the adiabatic prediction, whereas in the high-mass range, the entropy of the outer CGM lies closer to the adiabatic relation.

        <p>In the low-mass range, the energy injection is likely due to SN and thermal mode AGN feedback. When the kinetic mode becomes important, the excess in entropy grows considerably, indicating that the injection mode (kinetic versus thermal) is of extreme importance in coupling the energy to the gas. As we examine haloes of even higher mass, the amount of energy that can be injected by SN and AGN becomes sub-dominant with respect to the gravitational energy of the host halo and the global entropy is set largely by the gravitational potential.In the low-mass range, the energy injection is likely due to SN and thermal mode AGN feedback.

        <p>The average cooling time in the CGM of galaxies found at the transitional mass scale is the same as in the central galaxies of massive clusters, and is of order 10-30 Gyr. With average cooling times exceeding the Hubble time, the gas in the CGM is not expected to cool in any significant quantity, ensuring that these galaxies remain quenched in the future. In this way, the AGN feedback not only shuts off star formation in the galaxy, but also maintains the quenched state for extended times. Of course, if gas is funnelled to the galaxy in a different way, such as in a merger with a gas-rich companion or via smooth accretion of pristine or feedback gas, the galaxy may acquire more gas and star formation may resume.The average cooling time in the CGM of galaxies found at the transitional mass scale is the same as in the central galaxies of massive clusters, and is of order 10-30 Gyr.

        <p>The kinetic mode feedback heats the CGM of the central galaxies, and, if the potential well of the halo is shallow enough, may actually evacuate gas from the inner CGM as well. This can be seen in Fig. 6(e) where the mean density of the CGM gas is colour coded. The extremely low densities in the lower mass quenched galaxies, at masses of 10 10 M , show that the energy supplied by the AGN is enough to unbind the gas not only from the galaxy itself but to push out significant amounts of gas from the surrounding medium as well. This has also been seen in the EAGLE simulation (Davies et al. 2019), even though the implementation of the BH feedback in the EAGLE model does not include a kinetic mode.The kinetic mode feedback heats the CGM of the central galaxies, and, if the potential well of the halo is shallow enough, may actually evacuate gas from the inner CGM as well.

This has also been seen in the EAGLE simulation (Davies et al. 2019), even though the implementation of the BH feedback in the EAGLE model does not include a kinetic mode.</p>
        <p>When examining the distribution of galaxies in the CGM entropystellar mass plane, as represented by the black contours of Figs 6(b) and 7 for example, we find three distinct galaxy concentrations: a low entropy concentration at low stellar masses (&lt; 10 9.5 M and log K &lt; 0), an intermediate-entropy concentration at stellar masses of in the range 10 9.5 -10 10.5 M and entropies of 0 &lt; log K 1, and a high entropy concentration with masses of &gt; 10 10.5 M and entropies of log K &gt; 1.5. Both the low-and intermediateentropy concentrations are comprised of star-forming galaxies, while the high-entropy concentration is composed of quenched galaxies.When examining the distribution of galaxies in the CGM entropystellar mass plane, as represented by the black contours of Figs 6(b) and 7 for example, we find three distinct galaxy concentrations: a low entropy concentration at low stellar masses (&lt; 10 9.5 M and log K &lt; 0), an intermediate-entropy concentration at stellar masses of in the range 10 9.5 -10 10.5 M and entropies of 0 &lt; log K 1, and a high entropy concentration with masses of &gt; 10 10.5 M and entropies of log K &gt; 1.5.

        <p>The cooling time in the low entropy concentration is very short, of order ∼ 100 Myr, thus the galactic gas in these galaxies can be easily replenished by CGM gas cooling. For the intermediate-mass concentration, comprised of galaxies of mass ∼ 10 10 M , the CGM cooling time is of order 1 Gyr. The gas depletion time-scale due to star formation is also of order several Gyr (Kong 2004;Bigiel et al. 2008;Leroy et al. 2008;Pflamm-Altenburg &amp; Kroupa 2009;Bauermeister et al. 2013), thus these galaxies can remain star forming since the gas cooling in the CGM can balance the gas depletion from star formation. In the high-entropy concentration, above a stellar mass of 10 10.5 M the cooling time is 10 Gyr, thus these galaxies are expected to remain quenched since they have been depleted of cold galactic gas which cannot be replenished on time-scales shorter than that. The caveat to this statement is the induced cooling of the CGM by cold, high-metallicity gas ejected by SN winds from the galaxy itself (Marinacci et al. 2010;Fraternali et al. 2013;Armillotta, Fraternali &amp; Marinacci 2016), though this effect is more important in star-forming galaxies rather than in galaxies that have already been quenched.The cooling time in the low entropy concentration is very short, of order ∼ 100 Myr, thus the galactic gas in these galaxies can be easily replenished by CGM gas cooling.

        <p>In Fig. 7, we can find clues as to what causes the groupings of galaxies in CGM entropies: the typical BH masses found in these galaxies (Fig. 7a) and more importantly, the amount of kinetic feedback released by the BH, or lack thereof (Fig. 7b). In the lowentropy concentration BH masses are small and there has been no kinetic mode feedback at all. Once the kinetic mode feedback starts to occur, even at very low levels (below the M BH ∼ 10 8 M mass scale), the entropy of the inner CGM is seen to increase by two order of magnitudes, and the typical temperature rises to T vir (Fig. 6b), though the gas density remains high (Fig. 6e). Once the BH mass scale is crossed and the kinetic feedback jumps to higher values, the entropy of the inner CGM grows even further, reaching values identical to Red and blue contours each enclose 90 per cent of the quenched and star-forming populations, respectively. The transition to substantial kinetic feedback at the transitional mass scale is found in an entropy jump in the inner CGM. In the low-mass regime, the concentration of galaxies at low entropies corresponds to galaxies in which the kinetic mode feedback has not operated at all, while in the concentration at intermediate entropies, although kinetic feedback events have occurred, they have contributed a very small fraction of the total feedback energy, which nevertheless has a noticeable effect on the CGM entropy.In Fig. 7, we can find clues as to what causes the groupings of galaxies in CGM entropies: the typical BH masses found in these galaxies (Fig. 7a) and more importantly, the amount of kinetic feedback released by the BH, or lack thereof (Fig. 7b).

        <p>A question naturally arises -Why do we not see a similar distinction in entropy in the galactic gas of star-forming galaxies between those galaxies with no kinetic feedback at all and those with some kinetic feedback (e.g. Fig. 6g)? We think that once the kinetic feedback begins to be active, even with low levels of energy injection, some portion of the gas will be affected, and its entropy will increase. This gas would be hydrodynamically unstable and thus rise outwards to beyond our fiducial r gal , thus becoming part of the CGM. The rest of the gas is unaffected and retains its low entropy and short cooling time.A question naturally arises -Why do we not see a similar distinction in entropy in the galactic gas of star-forming galaxies between those galaxies with no kinetic feedback at all and those with some kinetic feedback (e.g. Fig. 6g)?

        <p>As seen earlier, the transition from star forming to quenched is marked by a rise in the temperature -the galactic gas is very cool in the star-forming galaxies, but in the quenched galaxies it is as hot as the inner and outer CGM with values of order T vir . The inner and outer CGM temperatures remain fairly constant. In all three gas components we see a rise in entropy, with the most significant change in the galactic gas.

        <p>A quantitative characterization of the multiphase nature of the CGM is shown in Fig. 9 where we separately stack histograms of the CGM entropy of star-forming and quenched galaxies selected from the TNG100 simulation, in three galaxy stellar mass ranges. In each mass range, 10 9 -10 10 , 10 10 -10 11 , and 10 11 -10 12 M , we randomly select 100 galaxies from each group, star forming or quenched. In the low-(high-) mass range we find less than 100 quenched (star-forming) galaxies, and in those cases collect all the available galaxies of that group. For each galaxy, a mass histogram of the CGM entropy is created, i.e. how much gas mass is found at a given entropy value, and these histograms are stacked together. As in the analysis presented thus far, here we include only central galaxies and we account only for the gas that is gravitationally bound to each central, i.e. excising the gas contribution from satellites. We choose to present here the results from the TNG100 galaxies since the higher resolution of the simulation better captures the multiphase nature of Figure 9. The multiphase nature of the inner and outer CGM (top and bottom, respectively) is shown by stacked mass-histograms, counting only the nonstar-forming gas, of the CGM entropy for star-forming (blue) and quenched (red) galaxies in three stellar mass ranges of the TNG100 simulation: 10 9 -10 10 (left), 10 10 -10 11 (middle), and 10 11 -10 12 M (right). In each mass bin, the individual mass-histograms of the CGM entropy of 100 (or less) galaxies of each group were stacked. The number of stacked histograms for each group and mass bin is shown in the legend. In all cases, most (but not all) of the individual stacked galaxies have qualitatively similar distributions to the stacked histogram shown here. The bi-modal distribution in the inner CGM shows that the gas is not monolithic in its properties. The shift to higher values in the high-entropy peak of the quenched, intermediate-mass galaxy compared to similar mass star forming ones shows that the transition between being star forming and quenched involves a change in the CGM properties as well.

        <p>In the inner CGM, shown on the top row of Fig. 9, the entropy distribution is bi-modal for (nearly) all galaxy types and mass ranges, indicating that the CGM contains both low-and high-entropy gas, although the amount of low-entropy gas in the high-mass regime is found to be very small. The high amount of low-entropy gas found in the quenched galaxies of the transitional mass range (top-middle panel) is especially striking: these are mass histograms and thus the top middle panel in Fig. 9 shows that there can be as much (in mass) low-entropy as high-entropy gas in the CGM of the depicted galaxies. Though the AGN feedback has already affected some of the CGM gas, (seen in shift of the high-entropy peak compared to that of the star-forming galaxies), there are still considerable amounts of lowentropy gas. This points to a localized effect of the AGN, as can be achieved with collimated outflows or bubbles (the mid-range galaxy images of Fig. 3 show this nicely). We note that a similar bi-modal distribution is found in the mass histograms of the temperature and density separately (not shown here), with the high-temperature/lowdensity peak of the quenched galaxy groups shifted to higher/lower values compared to the star-forming group.In the inner CGM, shown on the top row of Fig. 9, the entropy distribution is bi-modal for (nearly) all galaxy types and mass ranges, indicating that the CGM contains both low-and high-entropy gas, although the amount of low-entropy gas in the high-mass regime is found to be very small.

We examined the individual distributions and found that for the inner CGM, in both groups and all mass ranges, most ( 60 per cent) of the individual galaxies exhibit distributions similar to the final stacking, that is, most of the individual galaxy distributions are also bi-modal. The rest of the distributions usually had a single peak, either in low-entropy regime (log K &lt; 0) or in the high-entropy regime (log K &gt; 0).

This is also the case for the outer CGM. In the high-mass end, both quenched and star-forming groups are practically identical, both in the inner and outer CGM.

        <p>From both the TNG simulations studied here, we can trace a relationship between the star forming and thermodynamic states of the galaxy and its CGM with the stellar mass of the galaxy and its SMBH mass, which can be summarized as follows. In low-mass galaxies, 10 9.5 M , the (non-star-forming) gas in the galaxy is cold and dense with very low entropy values and short cooling times of order ∼ 10 Myr -within the main stellar body of galaxies. The BH masses are also low, around the initial seed mass of 10 6 M . In most of these galaxies, AGN feedback is limited to the high accretion mode alone (Figs 5b and7b). Under these conditions, the sSFR of these galaxies is high and they are typically found on the star-forming sequence. Star formation in these galaxies is expected to continue unabated due to the conditions in the gas immediately surrounding the galaxy, which we have dubbed the inner CGM. The cooling time in the inner CGM is of order ∼ 100 Myr ensuring that any gas used up through star formation will be replenished by gas cooling from the CGM. In these galaxies, the BH masses remain low due to low accretion rates.From both the TNG simulations studied here, we can trace a relationship between the star forming and thermodynamic states of the galaxy and its CGM with the stellar mass of the galaxy and its SMBH mass, which can be summarized as follows. In low-mass galaxies, 10 9.5 M , the (non-star-forming) gas in the galaxy is cold and dense with very low entropy values and short cooling times of order ∼ 10 Myr -within the main stellar body of galaxies. The BH masses are also low, around the initial seed mass of 10 6 M . In most of these galaxies, AGN feedback is limited to the high accretion mode alone (Figs 5b and7b).

        <p>In more massive galaxies, ∼ 10 10 M , the BH mass is 10 7-8 M . At these BH masses, the kinetic feedback is present and weak, but its effects can already be seen. Part of the galactic gas is affected by the AGN and thus has elevated entropy and is pushed out of the galaxies to become part of the CGM, however most of the galactic gas is unaffected and the galaxy remains star forming. The entropy of the inner CGM is higher and thus the cooling time is ∼ 1 Gyr. In these galaxies, the cooling of the CGM can still balance gas depletion due to star formation since both have roughly the same time-scales.In more massive galaxies, ∼ 10 10 M , the BH mass is 10 7-8 M .

        <p>Once the BH mass crosses the transitional mass scale of log M BH ∼ 8.3, energy injected by the kinetic mode kinetic feedback becomes comparable (∼1/3) to that supplied by the thermal mode (and therefore 1/4 of the total energy output), and as a result the galaxy entropy jumps by 2-3 orders of magnitude, and the galaxy transitions from star forming to quenched. Naturally, this transition will also manifest in observable properties of the galaxy such as colour (Nelson et al. 2018a).Once the BH mass crosses the transitional mass scale of log M BH ∼ 8.3, energy injected by the kinetic mode kinetic feedback becomes comparable (∼1/3) to that supplied by the thermal mode (and therefore 1/4 of the total energy output), and as a result the galaxy entropy jumps by 2-3 orders of magnitude, and the galaxy transitions from star forming to quenched.

        <p>Throughout this paper (and elsewhere), the transition in galaxy and CGM properties -e.g. sSFR, entropy, cooling time, halo gas content (Davies et al. 2020;Terrazas et al. 2020), colour (Nelson et al. 2018a), size (Genel et al. 2018), and others -is seen to occur at specific values of stellar or BH mass as a result of the way the AGN feedback is implemented in the TNG model. Whether or not such a sharp transition is supported by observations is still an open question, but we would suggest that entropy, due to its dramatic increase at the transition, constitutes a powerful diagnostic for future studies.Throughout this paper (and elsewhere), the transition in galaxy and CGM properties -e.g. sSFR, entropy, cooling time, halo gas content (Davies et al. 2020;Terrazas et al. 2020), colour (Nelson et al. 2018a), size (Genel et al. 2018), and others -is seen to occur at specific values of stellar or BH mass as a result of the way the AGN feedback is implemented in the TNG model.

        <p>In galaxies close to the transition mass of 10 10.5 M the kinetic feedback overcomes the binding energy of the gas in the galaxy (Terrazas et al. 2020) and can deplete much of the galactic gas. In some cases, even the inner CGM becomes extremely dilute (Fig. 6e): the kinetic feedback in the TNG model is therefore 'ejective' and star formation quenching is triggered, in effect, by gas removal from the star-forming regions.In galaxies close to the transition mass of 10 10.5 M the kinetic feedback overcomes the binding energy of the gas in the galaxy (Terrazas et al. 2020) and can deplete much of the galactic gas.

        <p>However, the onset of kinetic mode feedback also leads to a change in the CGM of the galaxies: the CGM is hotter, more dilute and of higher entropy. Therefore, in a nutshell, the TNG AGN feedback ejects and heats up the gas within and around galaxies. The change in conditions may be observable, as the high-entropy CGM becomes a detectable X-ray source, albeit strongly susceptible to the underlying gas density (Oppenheimer et al. 2020b;Truong et al. 2020).However, the onset of kinetic mode feedback also leads to a change in the CGM of the galaxies: the CGM is hotter, more dilute and of higher entropy.

        <p>The cooling time, both in the galactic gas as well as the CGM is now quite long, of order 10 Gyr. These galaxies are quenched, and expected to remain so, since the cooling from the CGM, even when taking into account the multiphase nature of the CGM, will not replenish the gas in the galaxy. Only if gas is accreted into the galaxy in a different way, by a merger for example, can star formation be ignited in the galaxy.The cooling time, both in the galactic gas as well as the CGM is now quite long, of order 10 Gyr.

        <p>It is important to note that a similar physical occurrence is found in the EAGLE simulations (Davies et al. 2020;Oppenheimer et al. 2020a), a consensus that lends credibility to the outcome at the galaxy and CGM levels of from two very different galaxy formation models. In fact, in the details, this is achieved by a different implementation of BH feedback: the very effective kinetic mode in the TNG model operates at accretion rates well below the Eddington rate whereas in the EAGLE model, in which the AGN feedback efficiency is constant, the BH feedback is most effective at accretions rates close to the Eddington rate. This in turn highlights the challenges and uncertainties present in the modelling of this important process, as well as the need for detailed studies of the physical outcomes of its implementation.It is important to note that a similar physical occurrence is found in the EAGLE simulations (Davies et al. 2020;Oppenheimer et al. 2020a), a consensus that lends credibility to the outcome at the galaxy and CGM levels of from two very different galaxy formation models.

        <p>In the inner CGM, we found the imprints of the kinetic mode feedback at two mass scales -when the first event of kinetic feedback injection occurs (even when the galaxy is still star forming), and when the kinetic to thermal energy ratio becomes roughly constant. In both, the typical entropy of the CGM increases noticeably. In the outer CGM, we only see the imprint of the latter. This is probably due to two processes that work in tandem at this mass scale: only when the energy injected by the kinetic mode feedback is high enough can it influence the outer regions of the CGM. In addition, for galaxies at this mass scale the dark matter host halo becomes massive enough to sustain stable shocks emanating from its centre (Birnboim &amp; Dekel 2003;Dekel &amp; Birnboim 2006) allowing them to expand and encompass the entire host halo. It may be that the shocks being driven by the kinetic feedback in lower mass systems cannot expand far enough to affect the outer CGM.In the inner CGM, we found the imprints of the kinetic mode feedback at two mass scales -when the first event of kinetic feedback injection occurs (even when the galaxy is still star forming), and when the kinetic to thermal energy ratio becomes roughly constant.

        <p>As shown by Nelson et al. (2019b), the kinetic mode of AGN feedback can drive strong bi-polar outflows of gas, which emerge perpendicular to the galaxy disc ('path of least resistance'). Examples of this can be seen in Fig. 3. In addition to gas removal from the galaxy itself, the high-velocity gas in the outflow generates shocks as it encounters the ambient gas (see idealized tests in Weinberger et al. 2017). These shocks, in turn, convert the kinetic energy of the outflows into thermal energy and lead to the heating of the CGM gas and a subsequent rise in entropy and cooling times. Regions of high-entropy gas ('bubbles') embedded in lower entropy gas (see Fig. 3) which rise due to their buoyancy (Bower et al. 2017;Keller et al. 2020) can also transport energy from the central regions to the outer halo gas.As shown by Nelson et al.

To do so, we assume that a gas cell in the CGM can only be accreted on to the galaxy and form stars if it can cool in the time it would take it to reach the centre, namely that its cooling time (equation 9), must be less than the free-fall time (equation 12) at its position, t cool &lt; t ff .To assess whether the TNG black hole feedback model is indeed preventative, we calculate an estimate for the total mass of (inner and outer) CGM gas which may turn into stars in the near future for each galaxy, and try to determine whether the galaxy would be classified as quenched or not based on this value.

        <p>In each galaxy in our sample, for a given time-scale t s = 1 Gyr, we sum up the mass of all gas cells for which t cool ≤ t ff and t ff ≤ t s to estimate how much gas is available to fuel star formation, by assuming that only gas cells which (a) can reach the galaxy within the given time-scale and (b) can cool within that time can in turn form stars. Studies of star-forming gas clouds show that only a small fraction of the cloud mass actually forms stars, with star formation efficiencies of order ∼1 per cent per cloud free-fall time (see Krumholz et al. 2019, and references therein). We likewise assume that not all the available gas cooled from the CGM will form stars and assume a high fraction of SF = 5 per cent, so as to obtain a high estimate of the total amount of gas which can be transformed into stars.7 Thus the total amount by which the stellar mass can increase within a time-scale of t s isIn each galaxy in our sample, for a given time-scale t s = 1 Gyr, we sum up the mass of all gas cells for which t cool ≤ t ff and t ff ≤ t s to estimate how much gas is available to fuel star formation, by assuming that only gas cells which (a) can reach the galaxy within the given time-scale and (b) can cool within that time can in turn form stars.

Of course, in making this estimate of the stellar mass formed in the future, we are deliberately ignoring the effects of feedback, SN and AGN, that in practice would continue to act on galaxies. As such, this estimate reflects the conditions within the CGM and should not be considered as an attempt to predict the stellar mass in the future of a galaxy.

        <p>A complementary, in-depth study of the evolution over the history of individual galaxies may still be necessary for a complete understanding of the role the AGN plays in the evolution of the gas conditions in tandem with the star-forming state of the galaxy.A complementary, in-depth study of the evolution over the history of individual galaxies may still be necessary for a complete understanding of the role the AGN plays in the evolution of the gas conditions in tandem with the star-forming state of the galaxy.</p>
        <p>The analysis presented above rests on the results of both the TNG300 simulation, with its extremely large sample of galaxies, as well as the higher resolution TNG100 simulation. In this way, we could better explore the distribution of galaxy properties over a large sample with TNG300 (especially in the high-mass end), as was done in Figs 45678and 11, and also study important small-scale features that are better resolved in TNG100 (Figs 3, 9, and 10).The analysis presented above rests on the results of both the TNG300 simulation, with its extremely large sample of galaxies, as well as the higher resolution TNG100 simulation.

        <p>To study the effects of the simulation resolution, we carried out our population analysis on the TNG100 simulation. We find that the salient features remain unchanged when examining the betterresolved population: the transitional stellar mass scale is identical and the typical average values of entropy, temperature, density, and cooling times shown in Fig. 6 are by and large unchanged as well. We show a few examples of these comparisons in Appendix A and Figs A1 andA2.

        <p>Thus, our conclusions do not depend on the resolution of our simulations, though we stress that this is also due to our studying averaged values both within the galaxies and over the galaxy populations. Simulations with increased resolution would undoubtedly reveal features and properties of the CGM, particularly pertaining to regions of low entropy, which the simulations studied here cannot capture (e.g. Suresh et al. 2019;van de Voort et al. 2019). To gain insight as to how these small-scale differences may alter the way BH feedback affects the CGM, it would be interesting to carry out a detailed comparison between individual, similar-mass galactic systems in the TNG300, TNG100, as well as the higher resolution TNG50 simulation (Pillepich et al. 2019;Nelson et al. 2019b), an endeavour we defer to a later date.Thus, our conclusions do not depend on the resolution of our simulations, though we stress that this is also due to our studying averaged values both within the galaxies and over the galaxy populations.

        <p>In this paper, we have quantified the effects of AGN feedback, as realized in the TNG model, on the evolution of galaxies by specifically focusing on the physical conditions of the non-starforming gas within the galaxy and beyond, i.e. in the surrounding CGM. To that end, we have examined the population of central galaxies in the stellar mass range 10 9-12.5 M from the TNG100 and TNG300 simulations at z = 0. We have drawn our conclusions from global properties of the entire population under the assumption that the galaxy histories are imprinted on their present-day properties -an assumption that may not hold in all cases. We have relied on a numerical framework whereby the feedback from SMBHs is implemented as thermal energy injection at high-BH accretion rates and kinetic BH-driven winds at low accretion rates capable of driving large-scale outflows.In this paper, we have quantified the effects of AGN feedback, as realized in the TNG model, on the evolution of galaxies by specifically focusing on the physical conditions of the non-starforming gas within the galaxy and beyond, i.e. in the surrounding CGM.

We have connected the gas thermodynamics to the star-forming state of the galaxies (e.g. star-forming versus quiescent) and hence to the current and timeintegrated properties and activity of their central SMBHs.In particular, we have quantified the temperature, density, entropy, and cooling times of the non-star-forming, gravitationally bound gas of tens of thousands of galaxies, by broadly distinguishing among galactic gas (within twice the stellar half-mass radius), the inner CGM (between the latter and the gas half-mass radius), and the outer CGM (beyond the gas half-mass radius).

        <p>More specifically, our findings can be summarized as follows:More specifically, our findings can be summarized as follows:</p>
        <p>(i) The population of z = 0 central galaxies in the TNG simulations (TNG100 and TNG300) transitions between a largely starforming population at low masses, which forms a tight 'star-forming sequence' in the sSFR-stellar mass plane, to a mostly quiescent population at higher masses (Fig. 4a). The transition between the two populations comes about when the kinetic mode feedback of the AGN model (BH-driven winds) accounts for roughly 1/4 of the total energy output over the lifetime of the BH (Figs 1 and5). This occurs at a BH mass scale of ∼ 10 8.3 M , which corresponds to a stellar mass scale of ∼ 10 10.5 M .(i) The population of z = 0 central galaxies in the TNG simulations (TNG100 and TNG300) transitions between a largely starforming population at low masses, which forms a tight 'star-forming sequence' in the sSFR-stellar mass plane, to a mostly quiescent population at higher masses (Fig. 4a).

This occurs at a BH mass scale of ∼ 10 8.3 M , which corresponds to a stellar mass scale of ∼ 10 10.5 M .</p>
        <p>(ii) The transition between star-forming and quiescent galaxies manifests itself in the gas properties of the galaxy in the form of a rapid increase in the average entropy of the galactic gas (Fig. 4b, excluding star-forming gas) which corresponds to a jump in the typical gas cooling times from 10-100 Myr to 1-10 Gyr (Fig. 6g).(ii) The transition between star-forming and quiescent galaxies manifests itself in the gas properties of the galaxy in the form of a rapid increase in the average entropy of the galactic gas (Fig. 4b, excluding star-forming gas) which corresponds to a jump in the typical gas cooling times from 10-100 Myr to 1-10 Gyr (Fig. 6g).</p>
        <p>(iii) The changes in galactic gas properties are mirrored in the CGM, showing that the kinetic mode feedback also affects the gas beyond the galaxy. Even very small amounts of energy injected via the kinetic mode feedback result in a noticeable jump in the CGM average entropy. In other words, in quenching galaxies, the effects of the kinetic mode AGN Feedback leave an imprint also on the outer reaches of the gas halo, up to distances of several hundreds of kiloparsecs (Fig. 6). This separation in the typical thermodynamic properties of the gas within and around star-forming versus quiescent galaxies can be tested with X-ray observations (see Oppenheimer et al. 2020b;Truong et al. 2020).(iii) The changes in galactic gas properties are mirrored in the CGM, showing that the kinetic mode feedback also affects the gas beyond the galaxy.

        <p>(iv) Within the framework of the TNG model, AGN feedback, and particularly the kinetic mode feedback at low BH accretion rates, ejects and heats up the gas within and around galaxies (Fig. 8). Namely, it acts as both an 'ejective' feedback -by expelling starforming gas from the galaxy and triggering quenching -as well as a 'preventative' feedback -by increasing the average CGM entropy and cooling time and making them non-conducive for fueling future star formation (Figs 10 and 11). This remains true even though the CGM itself is multi phase, with both high-and low-entropy (diffuse and dense) components (Fig. 9). While for some systems the 'ejective' part of the feedback is enough to ensure long-term quiescence, a significant sub-population would start to form stars again unless preventative AGN feedback is operating.(iv) Within the framework of the TNG model, AGN feedback, and particularly the kinetic mode feedback at low BH accretion rates, ejects and heats up the gas within and around galaxies (Fig. 8).

        <p>In conclusion, with this work we have examined how the three components -the SMBH, the galaxy, and the CGM -are all interconnected in their evolution within the context of a numerical model for galaxy formation that yields galaxy populations in reasonable agreement with observations. While the latter may not be fully realistic in detail owing to limited resolution (see e.g. van de Voort et al. 2019;Suresh et al. 2019), it still provides us with a rich and plausible laboratory to get insights and inspirations for what may happen in the real Universe.In conclusion, with this work we have examined how the three components -the SMBH, the galaxy, and the CGM -are all interconnected in their evolution within the context of a numerical model for galaxy formation that yields galaxy populations in reasonable agreement with observations.

        <p>Importantly, global evolutionary properties, such as a long-lasting quenched state, can be accompanied by a diversity of halo gas states, spanning orders of magnitude in entropy values within the same galaxy or gaseous halo. Finally and more generally, we hope we have inspired future studies of the formation and evolution of galaxies to treat the entire galactic ecosystem -from the small scales of the central BH, to the outer reaches of the CGM -as a complex, interdependent structure, with each component having its own part to play in determining the future of the system.Importantly, global evolutionary properties, such as a long-lasting quenched state, can be accompanied by a diversity of halo gas states, spanning orders of magnitude in entropy values within the same galaxy or gaseous halo.

Here too we see that despite the difference in resolution, the quenched and star-forming populations inhabit similar regions in the plot, and the estimated fractional increase in stellar mass is by and large the same. 11. Galaxies that are star forming or quenched at z = 0 are coloured in blue and red, respectively, with contours showing the 25, 50, 75, and 95 percentiles of each population. The dashed line corresponds to the expected fractional mass increase of a galaxy with sSFR = 10 -11 yr -1 (our star-forming/quenched threshold) over a period of t s = 1 Gyr. The blue and red numbers at the top of each panel show the percentage of the star forming and quenched z = 0 populations that are found above the black dashed lines after 1 Gyr. For the quenched population, we also quote the percentage of galaxies of stellar mass higher 10 10 M found above this line. The results for the two samples are very similar, and thus are not resolution dependant.In Fig. A3(a), we show the results for the TNG100 sample, with the TNG300 sample results shown for comparison in Fig. A3(b) (previously shown in Fig. 11).

        <p>In Fig. 4(b), we encountered a population of low-mass, low-entropy galaxies, marked in the figure by the red contour found in the lower left corner. These galaxies comprise roughly 3.5 per cent of the TNG300 galaxies in our sample (with stellar mass above 10 9 M ), and about 15 per cent of the quenched galaxy population. It should be noted that we find these galaxies after removing 'back-splash' galaxies as described in Section 2.4.In Fig. 4(b), we encountered a population of low-mass, low-entropy galaxies, marked in the figure by the red contour found in the lower left corner.

        <p>In TNG100, a similar population is found (see Fig. A1a), but of much lower relative numbers: only 0.5 per cent of the total population and only 3.4 per cent of the quenched population. The fact that the relative size of this population is different between TNG100 and TNG300 points to either a resolution or volume dependent effect. We note that when lowering the sSFR threshold for what should be considered a quenched galaxy by a factor of 2, this galaxy population shrinks by roughly 25 percent, but still comprises 11 per cent of the quenched galaxy population.In TNG100, a similar population is found (see Fig. A1a), but of much lower relative numbers: only 0.5 per cent of the total population and only 3.4 per cent of the quenched population.

        <p>In Fig. 5(a), we learn that the BHs in all these galaxies have low mass, and all have not yet experienced a single kinetic mode injection event, as can be seen in Fig. 5(b). As such, the inner CGM of these galaxies is characterized by relatively low entropies (Fig. 6b). The outer CGM of these galaxies is no different overall from most other star-forming galaxies of similar masses (Figs 6c, f, and i). We cannot rely on Fig. 6 to learn about the temperatures, densities, and cooling times of these galaxies directly since the values of these quantities are averaged over all galaxies within a pixel, most of which are likely star forming. However, based on the entropy values for these galaxies one can confidently surmise that their cooling times are most likely similar to those of the star-forming population of order 10 Myr in the galactic gas and 100 Myr in the inner CGM.In Fig. 5(a), we learn that the BHs in all these galaxies have low mass, and all have not yet experienced a single kinetic mode injection event, as can be seen in Fig. 5(b).

        <p>When examining the conditions in the CGM of similar galaxies in the TNG100 simulation, by studying the red histogram of Figs 9(a) and (d), we see that these galaxies have entropy distributions that are skewed to lower values in the inner CGM and possess a more massive low-entropy component than their star-forming counterparts.When examining the conditions in the CGM of similar galaxies in the TNG100 simulation, by studying the red histogram of Figs 9(a) and (d), we see that these galaxies have entropy distributions that are skewed to lower values in the inner CGM and possess a more massive low-entropy component than their star-forming counterparts.</p>
        <p>All this points to the fact that whatever process is quenching these galaxies, it is most likely not energy injected by either SN or AGN kinetic feedback -the conditions within the gas of these galaxies are conducive to star formation at a rate similar to that of galaxies on the star-forming sequence. Indeed, when examining the future star-forming potential of these galaxies, as was done in Fig. 11, most of them occupy the same region as similar mass star-forming galaxies. In light of this, we are confident that the existence of this small group does not affect our conclusions as to the role of AGN feedback in instigating the quenching of the general population of galaxies.All this points to the fact that whatever process is quenching these galaxies, it is most likely not energy injected by either SN or AGN kinetic feedback -the conditions within the gas of these galaxies are conducive to star formation at a rate similar to that of galaxies on the star-forming sequence.

        <p>We defer an in-depth analysis as to the reason this specific galaxy population is quenched to a later date, but offer several conjectures as to why these galaxies are found in this state. It is possible that these are 'back-splash' galaxies that evaded our filtering procedure, i.e. galaxies who are centrals at z = 0 but were identified as satellites at some point in the past 5 Gyr. When we further remove all galaxies which were identified as satellites within the past 12 Gyr, the low-mass, low-entropy galaxies now comprise 3.3 per cent of total TNG300 sample and roughly 13 per cent of the quenched sub-sample. In TNG100, most galaxies from this group were found to be 'back-splash' galaxies and only a negligible number of quenched low-mass galaxies remain after their removal, based on the criteria set out in Section 2.4.We defer an in-depth analysis as to the reason this specific galaxy population is quenched to a later date, but offer several conjectures as to why these galaxies are found in this state.

        <p>Another possibility is that the quenched state of these galaxies is a transient short-lived episode of low SFR. We tested this conjecture by examining the smoothed SFR of these systems over the past 200 Myr, calculated by tallying up the total amount of stellar mass formed over this period. By this metric, i.e. when the star-formation rates are averaged across longer periods of time, roughly 25 per cent of these systems are actually considered star forming. As it stands, it appears that within the TNG model there is a quenching channel for low-mass galaxies which is likely resolution dependent.Another possibility is that the quenched state of these galaxies is a transient short-lived episode of low SFR.

        <p>In Fig. A1, we show the distribution of the galactic gas of central galaxies at z = 0 for the two simulation boxes on the entropystellar mass plane, with the colours corresponding to the sSFR of the galaxies (shown earlier in Fig. 4b). The advantages of using the much larger TNG300 sample are clear as the distribution is much more 'fleshed-out' with this sample, especially at the high-mass end. 4b). Black contours show the distribution of all galaxies in the plane and the blue and red contours each enclose 90 per cent of the star-forming/quenched population. The distribution of the galaxy population is similar between the two simulation boxes, as are the typical entropy values for the star-forming and quenched population.In Fig. A1, we show the distribution of the galactic gas of central galaxies at z = 0 for the two simulation boxes on the entropystellar mass plane, with the colours corresponding to the sSFR of the galaxies (shown earlier in Fig. 4b).

        <p>The transition between star forming and quenched occurs at the same mass scale, as expected, since this threshold is set by the physical model and the transition between the thermal and kinetic mode (Section 2.2). In addition, the entropy values for the star forming and quenched population are by and large identical, with the same entropy 'floor' (as set by the physical model) and 'ceiling', and the same typical values for the peak of the distribution.The transition between star forming and quenched occurs at the same mass scale, as expected, since this threshold is set by the physical model and the transition between the thermal and kinetic mode (Section 2.2).

        <p>In Fig. A2, we show the distribution for the galactic gas and inner CGM, top and bottom row, respectively, with the colours showing the cooling time in the gas, for the TNG100 sample on the left and TNG300 sample on the right (Figs A2b and A2d are identical to Fig. 6g, 6h, respectively). The distribution of galaxies for inner CGM entropy values is also similar in both samples. Even though the gas is better resolved in the TNG100 sample, the average values of the cooling time in both the galactic and CGM gas is also practically identical between the two simulations.
