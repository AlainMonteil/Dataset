        <p>We present an incremental version (4FGL-DR3, for Data Release 3) of the fourth Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) catalog of γ-ray sources. Based on the first 12 years of science data in the energy range from 50 MeV to 1 TeV, it contains 6658 sources. The analysis improves on that used for the 4FGL catalog over eight years of data: more sources are fit with curved spectra, we introduce a more robust spectral parameterization for pulsars, and we extend the spectral points to 1 TeV. The spectral parameters, spectral energy distributions, and associations are updated for all sources. Light curves are rebuilt for all sources with 1 yr intervals (not 2 month intervals). Among the 5064 original 4FGL sources, 16 were deleted, 112 are formally below the detection threshold over 12 yr (but are kept in the list), while 74 are newly associated, 10 have an improved association, and seven associations were withdrawn. Pulsars are split explicitly between young and millisecond pulsars. Pulsars and binaries newly detected in LAT sources, as well as more than 100 newly classified blazars, are reported. We add three extended sources and 1607 new point sources, mostly just above the detection threshold, among which eight are considered identified, and 699 have a plausible counterpart at other wavelengths. We discuss the degree-scale residuals to the global sky model and clusters of soft unassociated point sources close to the Galactic plane, which are possibly related to limitations of the interstellar emission model and missing extended sources.We present an incremental version (4FGL-DR3, for Data Release 3) of the fourth Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) catalog of γ-ray sources.

        <p>fourth source catalog (4FGL, where FGL stands for Fermi Gamma-ray LAT) was derived from the analysis of the first 8 yr of LAT science data and contained 5064 sources (Abdollahi et al. 2020, hereafter the 4FGL paper, or simply 4FGL). Every FGL catalog until and including 4FGL had used a new analysis method, new calibrations, a new diffuse model, and even a new reconstruction of the events themselves (like Pass 8 for 4FGL). Therefore each successive version of the catalog was largely independent of the previous one. Results for different versions were compared only after the fact.fourth source catalog (4FGL, where FGL stands for Fermi Gamma-ray LAT) was derived from the analysis of the first 8 yr of LAT science data and contained 5064 sources (Abdollahi et al. 2020, hereafter the 4FGL paper, or simply 4FGL).

        <p>Since the development of the 4FGL, the data have been stable, no new model for the Galactic interstellar emission was built, and the analysis method has not evolved much. So we decided to change our approach and start building incremental 4FGL versions every two years, until one major analysis or data component changes. The Data Release 2 (DR2; Ballet et al. 2020) covered 10 yr of data and contained 723 additional sources. We refer to the original 4FGL sources as Data Release 1 (DR1).Since the development of the 4FGL, the data have been stable, no new model for the Galactic interstellar emission was built, and the analysis method has not evolved much.

        <p>In this paper, we describe the incremental procedure and apply it to 12 yr of data, creating the Data Release 3 (4FGL-DR3 or DR3 for short). The 4FGL paper remains the reference for the detailed methodology. DR2 was strictly incremental (all DR1 sources are included and the analysis procedure was exactly the same). Meanwhile we have improved a few analysis steps, and recent publications have revealed a few new extended sources. Therefore we have relaxed this condition in DR3, to allow for deleting a few sources, and accept a few improved localizations.In this paper, we describe the incremental procedure and apply it to 12 yr of data, creating the Data Release 3 (4FGL-DR3 or DR3 for short).

        <p>All the information present in the DR1 catalog is updated, except the 2 month light curves. Those are very costly (in terms of CPU and disk space), and we have shown in the 4FGL paper that the 1 yr light curves capture most of the variability information. Monthly light curves, including indications of spectral variability, are now provided with similar accuracy in the Fermi-LAT Light Curve Repository. 85 Detection of transient sources on monthly timescales is covered by 1FLT 86 (Baldini et al. 2021). Transients on weekly timescales are covered by FAVA 87 (Abdollahi et al. 2017). Phase-folded spectral analysis of periodic sources (pulsars and binaries) is provided in dedicated papers.All the information present in the DR1 catalog is updated, except the 2 month light curves.

        <p>The condition for switching the spectral models to a curved representation is now less stringent, thereby increasing the fraction of curved spectra to about half. We improved the spectral parameterization of pulsars, quantified the residuals using a new method, and now include in the Catalog FITS file the peak energy (in νF ν ) for each source.The condition for switching the spectral models to a curved representation is now less stringent, thereby increasing the fraction of curved spectra to about half.

        <p>The community has worked hard on the unassociated LAT sources in recent years. Optical observations allowed for classifying many blazars, and radio, optical, and γ-ray timing allowed for detecting new pulsars and binary systems. We have included all this information in the source associations. The DR2 and DR3 results provide about 900 more unassociated sources to look into. Unassociated sources close to the Galactic plane are spatially clustered and have distinct spectral characteristics. We have singled them out by a specific flag.The community has worked hard on the unassociated LAT sources in recent years.

        <p>The data for the 4FGL-DR3 catalog were taken during the period 2008 August 4 (15:43 UTC) to 2020 August 2 (8:33 UTC) covering 12 years. During most of this time, Fermi was operated in sky-scanning survey mode, with the viewing direction rocking north and south of the zenith on alternate orbits such that the entire sky is observed every ∼3 hr. Starting on 2018 March 16, the Fermi spacecraft was put in safe hold after one solar array drive became stuck. Scientific operations of the LAT were interrupted for more than 3 weeks, by far the longest missing time interval since 2008, and restarted on April 8 in partial sky-scanning mode. 88 The Sun more rarely enters the field of view, and during some phases of the ∼53-day precession period of the orbit, the entire sky is not covered every 3 hours. This hampers the solar observations and shortterm light curves, but has little impact on the integrated sky coverage.The data for the 4FGL-DR3 catalog were taken during the period 2008 August 4 (15:43 UTC) to 2020 August 2 (8:33 UTC) covering 12 years.

        <p>As in 4FGL, intervals around solar flares and bright gammaray bursts (GRBs) were excised. During the additional 4 years, 108 ks were cut due to two successive bright solar flares in 2017 September, and 2.4 ks around five new bright GRBs. The current version of the LAT data is Pass 8 P8R3 (Atwood et al. 2013;Bruel et al. 2018). For DR2 and DR3, we used the P8R3_V3 IRFs instead of P8R3_V2 used to build DR1. The relative effective areas for the point-spread function (PSF) event types were recalibrated on bright sources, 89 reducing the systematics from 20% to 5%. The energy range remains 50 MeV to 1 TeV. In 4FGL, the event types were not treated separately above 10 GeV. We now decompose the events into four components up to 30 GeV, resulting in 19 components in total (Table 1), for better precision but at the cost of more disk space and CPU.As in 4FGL, intervals around solar flares and bright gammaray bursts (GRBs) were excised.

        <p>The interstellar emission is a very important ingredient when characterizing the point sources, because it is structured and 90% of the photons in the Galactic plane are of diffuse origin. We used exactly the same model as in 4FGL. 90 The isotropic spectrum was updated to P8R3_V3. The model for the emission of the Sun and the Moon was also kept the same, neglecting the modulation of the emission along the solar cycle. It became necessary, however, to generate a different effective model for each year (for the light curves). After the solar array drive anomaly during the tenth year, the coverage of the Sun changed significantly (Figure 1). For intervals of about 2 weeks, the Sun does not enter the field of view at all.The interstellar emission is a very important ingredient when characterizing the point sources, because it is structured and 90% of the photons in the Galactic plane are of diffuse origin.

        <p>Most of the steps were identical to 4FGL (Abdollahi et al. 2020). As before the extended sources are taken from the literature. We only search for point sources.

        <p>1. We adopted the Gaussian model proposed by Devin et al. (2020) for the broad supernova remnant (SNR) G150.3 +4.5, after we confirmed that it is a better fit than the disk model used in DR1. 2. Tibaldo et al. (2018) have studied the Vela X pulsar wind nebula (PWN) and reported that the radio template was superior to the geometric templates. We found that it does not provide a better fit than the DR1 model, but it eliminates six dubious point sources, so it is simpler and we adopted it. The same authors reported a spatial evolution as a function of energy, but we found that their Note. We used 19 components (all in binned mode) in the summed-likelihood approach (Section 3.3) for DR3. Components in a given energy interval share the same number of energy bins, the same zenith angle selection, and the same region of interest (RoI) core, but have different pixel sizes in order to adapt to the PSF width. Each filled entry under Pixel Size corresponds to one component of the summed log-likelihood. NBins is the number of energy bins in the interval, ZMax is the zenith angle cut, Ring Width refers to the difference between the RoI core and the extraction region (see Abdollahi et al. 2020, for details). high-energy disk is not significant when using the radio template. 3. Araya (2020) has shown that the cluster of DR1 sources around the SNR G279.0+1.1 is actually an extended LAT source. We adopted their ring model. 4. HESS J1640-465 is seen as extended by H.E.S.S., but was considered a point source in the DR1 catalog. We adopted the H.E.S.S. Gaussian template, after it was shown by Mares et al. (2021) that it is a better fit to the LAT data as well. 5. Two papers discussed the Fermi-LAT emission from the PWN HESS J1825-137. The morphology considered by Araya et al. (2019) was too complex for our catalog. We tried the broader Gaussian proposed by Principe et al.1. We adopted the Gaussian model proposed by Devin et al.

        <p>(2020) but found it worsened the fit. We did change the template, however, because we noticed that the one that we used since 2FGL was not the final version of Grondin et al. (2011). 6. Ambrogi et al. (2019) have shown that the previous template for the SNR HB 21 was too broad, because it mistakenly included a separate point source. We adopted their smaller template. 7. Xin et al. (2019) reported the detection with Fermi-LAT of the extended VERITAS source VER J2227+608, corresponding to the SNR G106.3+2.7 next to the much brighter pulsar PSR J2229+6114.

        <p>The source detection procedure followed the same lines as in 4FGL. It used pointlike (Kerr 2010) and a specialized diffuse model in which the nontemplate features are estimated differently. It started from the previous list of sources (DR1 for DR2, DR2 for DR3), relocalized them over 12 yr of data, looked for peaks in the residual TS maps generated for several spectral shapes, introduced those in the model, refit, and iterated over the full procedure. The resulting list (called uw1216) contained 11,128 seed sources at TS &gt; 10.The source detection procedure followed the same lines as in 4FGL.

        <p>That procedure naturally resulted in changing the positions of all sources. Since we wanted the catalog to be incremental, we forced most DR1 and DR2 sources back to their original positions (consistent with their names). This requires associating the uw1216 seed sources with the DR2 catalog. To do that, we started by defining pairs in which each member is the nearest counterpart of the other, within at most 1°. We repeated that procedure after removing the pairs found at the first step, in order to handle faint sources close to much brighter ones (in which the nearest counterpart can be the bright source). We rejected 58 pairs in which the distance between the two members was larger than the largest of the two 99.9% position errors (approximately 1.5 times the 95% error) and 0°.15. We eliminated the uw1216 seeds in a pair with a DR2 source, and formed the input list from the DR2 sources (including 139 with no counterpart in uw1216) and the remaining uw1216 seeds.That procedure naturally resulted in changing the positions of all sources.

        <p>In DR2 we actually used the original positions of all DR1 sources strictly, and kept all of them. However a number of sources became much brighter in recent years than they were during the first 8 yr, so they are now much better localized. In recognition of this, we adopted for DR3 the new error ellipse when its area was at least 10 times smaller and TS at least 10 times larger than the same quantities in DR1. We used those very strict conditions to preserve the incremental nature of the catalog. This selected 10 sources, clear outliers when looking at the distribution of ratios of ellipse areas and TS (Figure 2). All are associated with blazars (very variable sources). One of them was in uw8606 (list of seeds for DR1) but too faint to be included in DR1 (it appeared in DR2), so only nine DR1 sources were updated. They have a 4FGL counterpart in the ASSOC_FGL column, but have DataRelease set to 3 because they have moved.In DR2 we actually used the original positions of all DR1 sources strictly, and kept all of them.

        <p>We have also adopted the new error ellipses of one DR1 source close to the modified extended source HESS J1825 -137 and three faint soft sources (two from DR1, one from DR2) whose 95% semimajor axes R 95 were larger than 1°in DR1 or DR2. Three DR1 sources with broad error ellipses R 95 ∼ 0°.4 were split into two better localized seeds inside the original error ellipse. We replaced the DR1 sources by the two seeds. The same applied to two DR2 sources.

        <p>We reassessed the systematic corrections to localization. Up to 4FGL, they were defined globally over the entire sky, so their values were dominated by high-latitude sources (92% of associated point sources in DR1 are at |b| &gt; 5°). However, confusion and strong interstellar emission make localization much more difficult in the Galactic plane. In DR2 we estimated localization systematics separately at |b| &lt; 5°, based on 110 pulsars and low-latitude active galactic nuclei (AGN). We found that they should indeed be increased there, to 27″ for the absolute 95% error, and 1.37 for the systematic factor. We did not change the systematics in the high-latitude sky (25″ and 1.06).

            <rs type="software">Science Tools</rs> setting was equivalent to edisp_bins = -1, not enough to fully fill the first and last data bins for the small energy bins that we use (10 per decade). We used edisp_bins = -2 instead, considering two bins for energy dispersion on each side beyond the data bins. The acceptance for the PSF3 event type increases by a factor 2.4 between 50 and 100 MeV, so to account for this rapid change, we used six energy bins in the first component (Table 1) instead of three and set edisp_bins to -4 accordingly.

        <p>For DR1 and DR2, the normalization of one of the diffuse components sometimes became very large (close to the maximum, set to 2) or very small (close to 0) in regions where that component contributed little. This was particularly obvious for the isotropic component in the Galactic ridge. This could happen because of missing features in the interstellar emission model (IEM), leading to a higher isotropic component in the fit. This was not satisfying since the isotropic emission is supposed to be approximately constant over the sky, and the stuck parameters caused trouble in the error estimates. In order to stabilize the diffuse parameters, we replaced the hard limits with Bayesian priors. We chose the priors from the distributions of the parameters (in DR2) in regions where they are dominant (|b| &lt; 10°for the Galactic parameters and |b| &gt; 30°f or the isotropic normalization). This led to the values reported in Table 3. The intrinsic reasons for the large or small values did not go away, of course, so the resulting isotropic normalizations were still larger than one in the Galactic ridge, but they rarely exceeded 1.5.

        <p>The implication is that we should choose a TS curv threshold as low as possible while preserving global convergence of the model. For DR3 we set the threshold to 4 as a compromise because the test with a threshold at 1 required manual intervention, and global convergence could not be guaranteed.

        <p>Thanks to the improved statistics and the lowered TS curv threshold, many more sources are considered significantly curved in DR3 than in DR1. The number of LP spectral models is now 3130 (among which 650 are new sources), while the number of PLEC models is now 258 (among which 2 are new sources). The fraction of sources represented by a curved spectral model increased from 30% to 51% overall.Thanks to the improved statistics and the lowered TS curv threshold, many more sources are considered significantly curved in DR3 than in DR1.

        <p>Changing the spectral models for many sources from PL to curved also has an impact on their energy flux estimate. The PL flux is nearly always larger, due to the integration down to 100 MeV for soft sources (or up to 100 GeV for hard sources Γ &lt; 2). This is quantified in Figure 6. Well-measured pulsars (diamonds at high significance) have on average a 50% larger flux estimate in the PL model than in the PLEC model. The wellmeasured blazars (plus signs) are in the lower branch at a ratio around 1.1, because their spectra are much less curved than those of pulsars. The diamonds in the lower branch are the very bright blazars fit with PLEC (see above). A ratio less than one occurs when the peak of the curved spectrum is close to either 100 MeV or 100 GeV (the boundaries of the energy interval over which the energy flux is extracted), because the full analysis interval (50 MeV to 1 TeV) extends beyond those boundaries and maintains the PL fit below the peak of the curved model.Changing the spectral models for many sources from PL to curved also has an impact on their energy flux estimate.

        <p>In the DR1 and DR2 catalogs, we provided SEDs over N bands = 7 energy bands. Thanks to the increased statistics after 12 yr (particularly valuable at high energy where the precision is limited by counts rather than background), we can provide them over eight energy bands in DR3, extending to 1 TeV as in the 3FHL catalog (Ajello et al. 2017). We replaced the 30-300 GeV bin by a 30-100 GeV bin and a 100 GeV-1 TeV bin. We computed those two fluxes using unbinned likelihood, as in 4FGL. In the highest-energy band, 172 sources have TS &gt; 25. An example of such a hard source is shown in Figure 7. That source has TS curv (LP) = 8.70, below the DR2 threshold of 9 but above the DR3 threshold of 4, so it is fit with the LP model in DR3. The significant differences between 1 and 10 GeV are due to the natural variability of that strong source.In the DR1 and DR2 catalogs, we provided SEDs over N bands = 7 energy bands.

        <p>The systematic uncertainties92 have improved when moving from P8R3_V2 to P8R3_V3 and are now 0.1 in bands 1 and 8 and 0.05 in bands 2-7. We compute the spectral fit quality (SFQ) as before (Equation (5) in Abdollahi et al. 2020). Figure 8 shows how that quantity is distributed. Up to DR2, we flagged (Flag 10 in Table 4) sources with SFQ above the 99.9% quantile (10 -3 p-value) of the χ 2 distribution with N bands -2 degrees of freedom (dof), considering that most sources were fit with PL spectra that have two free parameters. For DR3 that would result in 6 dof. Clearly the data do not follow the χ 2 (6) distribution, but are much closer to the χ 2 (4) distribution. This is due to two effects: first, half the sources are now fit with curved spectra (3 free parameters); second, the first (&lt;100 MeV) and last (&gt;100 GeV) bands do not behave as a Gaussian distribution (very large errors in the first band, and very low counts in the last band), so they contribute little to SFQ. For DR3 we flagged sources with SFQ &gt; 18.47, the 10 -3 p-value of the χ 2 (4) distribution. The number of sources that trigger this remains small (only 16). The largest SFQ is obtained in PSR J0205+6449 at 49.6. That pulsar indeed has a known PWN (3C 58), which is very significant above the PLEC fit in the two bands above 30 GeV.

        <p>As before, we attempt to flag the sources affected by systematic errors larger than the statistical errors that we report, and which should therefore be treated with more caution. This can impact all source parameters, and even call into question the existence of the faintest flagged sources with significance less than 6σ or 7σ (TS &lt; 50). Because the largest source of systematics is the underlying diffuse emission, the sources close to the Galactic plane, where diffuse emission is both the strongest and most structured, are most affected.As before, we attempt to flag the sources affected by systematic errors larger than the statistical errors that we report, and which should therefore be treated with more caution.

The comparison with the old IEM also flags a few sources (although the seed positions are exactly the same) when among two nearby seeds one survives in DR3 and the other one with the old IEM. Overall the fraction of sources with any flag set increased from 23% in DR1 to 32% in DR3.

        <p>For one pixel, the 3σ, 4σ, and 5σ thresholds correspond to PS = 2.57, 4.20 and 6.24.

        <p>The PS distributions for samples of sources in three different ranges of Galactic latitude are shown in Figure 9. The highlatitude (|b| &gt; 35°) distribution follows the 10 -|x| expectation, whereas some deviations are visible in the low-latitude (|b| &lt; 5°) and mid-latitude (5°&lt; |b| &lt; 35°) distributions. To show the locations of these deviations, we build an all-sky HEALPix (Górski et al. 2005) map in Galactic coordinates with N side = 256 from the 540 PS maps. Figure 10 shows the resulting all-sky PS map. Overall the data/model agreement is good over the whole sky. Using a 4σ threshold, we find two positive and five negative deviations. The positive ones are both located inside bright extended sources: 4FGL J1923.2 +1408e (W 51C) and 4FGL J0822.1-4253e (Puppis A). They occur because the geometric templates that we use for those sources are far from perfect, and we do not allow additional point sources inside them (Section 3.2). Regarding the negative deviations, the one at a distance of ∼1°from the Galactic center corresponds to only one pixel. The other four are clusters of several pixels with PS &lt; -10.82 and correspond to extended deviations explaining the negative tail in the mid-latitude histogram in Figure 9.

        <p>Since these extended negative deviations seem to be related to the Galactic diffuse emission, we also compute the 540 PS maps with the set of PS spatial integration parameters optimized for large extended deviations (p 0 = 5°, p 1 = 0°.8, and p 2 = 1°). With p 2 = 1°, the level of correlation between pixels is expected to increase. Assuming that pixels within 0°.5 of each other are highly correlated, we divide the number of trials by 69, and the 3σ, 4σ, 5σ thresholds become PS = 7.4, 9, 11. The corresponding all-sky PS map, shown in Figure 11, exhibits many deviations above 4σ. A preliminary analysis of the negative ones shows that many of them are correlated with some components of the IEM, especially the local CO template (Galactocentric radius range 7-9 kpc), which may indicate that allowance for variation of the X CO factor among the local clouds is necessary. The positive deviations are less numerous and less significant. Like the negative ones, some are likely due to imperfections in the modeling of the Galactic diffuse emission, but some could correspond to new extended sources.Since these extended negative deviations seem to be related to the Galactic diffuse emission, we also compute the 540 PS maps with the set of PS spatial integration parameters optimized for large extended deviations (p 0 = 5°, p 1 = 0°.8, and p 2 = 1°).

        <p>Although a complete analysis of these extended deviations is outside the scope of this paper, we try to quantify their impact on the DR3 catalog. In order to do so, we look at the 540 PS maps and count the number of pixels with |PS| &gt; 7.4 and derive the expected number of DR3 sources in these regions from the average source density in the |PS| &lt; 7.4 region. In the 40 RoIs centered along the Galactic plane, the fraction of negative and positive deviation pixels is 2% and 0.9%, respectively. The numbers of observed and expected DR3 sources are 15 and 24.2 in the negative deviation pixels, and 33 and 10.1 in the positive deviation pixels. In the RoIs farther from the Galactic plane, the fraction of negative and positive deviation pixels is 0.15% and 0.03%, respectively. There are no DR3 sources in the negative deviation pixels, while 8.4 are expected. We conclude that the catalog results are biased in the negative and positive deviation regions, but the effect is small and the number of missed or spurious sources is at most ∼20.Although a complete analysis of these extended deviations is outside the scope of this paper, we try to quantify their impact on the DR3 catalog.

Among sources that are fit with the PL model in both catalogs (no TS boost from switching to a curved model), TS increased on average by 33% at high latitude (|b| &gt; 10°) and by 22% closer to the Galactic plane. The difference between the two is due to the lower loglikelihood weights, which partly offset the exposure increase close to the Galactic plane where diffuse emission is strong, particularly for soft sources. Even at high latitude, the TS ratio is less than expected from the exposure increase (50%). This is not due to the lower weights (the TS ratio does not depend on index) but to the selection bias (sources tend to be brighter in the interval in which they were defined) and signal-splitting with new sources. The statistical uncertainties on the parameters decreased by 15% at high latitude and 9% close to the plane.The TS of the 5048 remaining DR1 sources in DR3 increased on average compared to DR1.

        <p>The random character of adding new data and the variable nature of the γ-ray sources inevitably lead to broadening the TS distribution, in addition to shifting it to larger values. The sharp selection threshold at TS = 25 in DR1 becomes a tail of sources at TS &lt; 25 in DR3. Figure 12 shows the TS distribution outside the Galactic plane, where 74 DR1 sources have TS &lt; 25. Over the entire sky, 112 DR1 sources have TS &lt; 25 in DR3, among which 15 have TS &lt; 16, and the smallest TS is 9.8 (4FGL J1816.4-0057).The random character of adding new data and the variable nature of the γ-ray sources inevitably lead to broadening the TS distribution, in addition to shifting it to larger values.

        <p>The energy flux decreased on average by 5% (0.2σ) between DR1 and DR3 (considering only PL sources to avoid the effect of switching to a curved model). This is again a selection bias dominated by faint sources: close to the detection threshold, DR1 sources can get either brighter or fainter in DR3, but faint sources in DR3 cannot be fainter in DR1 because they would have TS &lt; 25. Real variability is apparent for bright sources (TS &gt; 1000). The scatter on the energy flux ratio is 5σ on variable DR1 sources, but only 1σ on nonvariable ones. There is no offset and less scatter (only 0.8σ overall) on the difference of PL indices because source fluxes vary strongly, but spectral shapes only slightly.The energy flux decreased on average by 5% (0.2σ) between DR1 and DR3 (considering only PL sources to avoid the effect of switching to a curved model).

        <p>The 1607 new DR2 and DR3 sources are on average very close to the detection threshold (median TS of 34). This is obvious in Figure 12.

Outside the Galactic plane, the confusion limit is still distant, because ever-deeper exposures reach to higher energies at which the PSF is better.

        <p>Figure 13 (right) compares the distribution of PL indices of the new sources with that of the DR1 ones. The variable new sources are soft on average, similar to flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). The same effect is observed in the 1FLT catalog (Baldini et al. 2021), even more strongly because detections in 1FLT are based on one-month data sets. The nonvariable new sources have a peak on the soft side as well (probably similar to the variable ones, but not bright enough to be significantly variable). But they also have a shoulder on the hard side. This is because adding more exposure is more beneficial at high energies (in the count-dominated regime) than at low energies, and therefore helps with detecting hard sources (like BL Lac objects).Figure 13 (right) compares the distribution of PL indices of the new sources with that of the DR1 ones.

        <p>Prior to that, the model counts were underestimated by about 5% in the first energy band (50 to 100 MeV), so the model fit was too high by the same amount at low energy. We found 16 fewer sources with the new settings, due to a slight TS reduction in soft sources. The energy flux decreased by 2% on average. The largest effect was spectral: we found 155 more LP spectra (+10%). Hard PL sources (Γ &lt; 2.1) were unchanged, but Γ decreased more and more for softer sources, reaching ΔΓ = -0.1 at Γ = 3. Note that this is specific to the catalog setting that uses many components for the summed likelihood in relatively narrow energy bands (Table 1). Analyses using few broader energy bands are not as sensitive to edisp_bins. 3. Introducing diffuse priors had very little effect on the sources. We found 7 fewer sources and 11 fewer LP spectra. In the Galactic ridge (where the effect of the priors is strongest), the average energy flux of sources decreased by 2% (0.1σ), and the average PL index decreased (became harder) by 0.005 (0.06σ). This is completely innocuous. 4. Lowering the TS curv threshold from 9 to 4 (Section 3.4) had an important effect on the sources, besides the collective effect illustrated in Figure 5 (right). The number of LP spectra increased by 1000 (+58%). The total number of sources increased by 127 (+2%) because more LP sources allowed more soft neighbors to reach the detection threshold. The energy fluxes of sources that switched from PL to LP decreased by 1.8σ (well above the statistical precision) as illustrated in Figure 6. Their neighbors picked up most of that flux, so their energy fluxes increased. They also became somewhat softer in the process (by 0.02 on average). On the other hand, the neighbors of those neighbors became a little harder, so that the global average PL index did not change. In conclusion, the change with the greatest consequences was lowering the TS curv threshold. We are confident that the new setting is closer to the physical reality.Prior to that, the model counts were underestimated by about 5% in the first energy band (50 to 100 MeV), so the model fit was too high by the same amount at low energy.

        <p>We have performed the same association procedure as in 4FGL, using the Bayesian method and likelihood-ratio method (see Abdollahi et al. 2020). The procedure yielded associations for 341 new DR2 sources and 366 new DR3 sources, representing association fractions of 48% and 41% respectively. These fractions are roughly consistent with that expected from DR1 for these low-TS sources. We provide lowprobability (0.1 &lt; P &lt; 0.8) associations for 95 new DR2 or DR3 sources and associations with Planck sources for 44 others. One major change regarding classes is that now we split the generic pulsar class used in previous catalogs into two separate classes, namely young pulsars (PSR) and millisecond pulsars (MSP). We recall that some pulsars with LAT-detected pulsations do not fill the defining significance criterion of this general source catalog and are thus omitted. The full list of LAT-detected pulsars is regularly updated,94 and the current population will be discussed in the forthcoming third LAT pulsar catalog. We also point out that associations with pulsar candidates are based on spatial coincidence only and that γ-ray pulsations from these sources are not necessarily expected to be detected soon.We have performed the same association procedure as in 4FGL, using the Bayesian method and likelihood-ratio method (see Abdollahi et al. 2020).

        <p>In this section, the spectral properties for the main source classes in the whole 4FGL-DR3 sample are presented. We use these properties to shed light on the nature of the unassociated sources in the next section. Although some classes, most notably pulsars, show significant levels of spectral curvature, the PL photon index, Γ, is a convenient parameter enabling comparison across classes. Figure 14 compares the photonindex distributions for different established classes. Pulsars show remarkably consistent soft spectra, along with GLCs. MSP have somewhat harder spectra on average compared to PSR and GLCs. The observed difference between the MSP and GLC distributions seems to challenge the conventional wisdom that MSP dominate the GLC's γ-ray emission (e.g., Harding et al. 2005;Venter et al. 2009), and is possibly due to different ambient stellar radiation fields comptonized by the MSP electrons (Bednarek &amp; Sitarek 2007). The spectra of SNRs and PWNe are notably harder than those of pulsars, in agreement with the observation that several SNRs and almost all PWNe are detected in the TeV domain. The distribution for blazars spans a broad range of photon index, the distributions for FSRQs and BLLs exhibiting moderate overlap (see Ajello et al. 2020). Blazars constitute the only abundant class showing a hard-spectrum component.In this section, the spectral properties for the main source classes in the whole 4FGL-DR3 sample are presented.

The spectra of SNRs and PWNe are notably harder than those of pulsars, in agreement with the observation that several SNRs and almost all PWNe are detected in the TeV domain. The distribution for blazars spans a broad range of photon index, the distributions for FSRQs and BLLs exhibiting moderate overlap (see Ajello et al. 2020). Blazars constitute the only abundant class showing a hard-spectrum component.</p>
        <p>Turning to the spectral curvature, while some blazars show significant curvature, as do most pulsars, the two classes occupy different branches in the LP_TS curv versus TS plane (Figure 15 top). These branches merge at the low-TS end as curvature cannot be assessed with high significance in that case. Despite the fact that PSR and MSP show slightly different spectra as can be seen from their photon-index distributions, both fall on the same branch in Figure 15 top.Turning to the spectral curvature, while some blazars show significant curvature, as do most pulsars, the two classes occupy different branches in the LP_TS curv versus TS plane (Figure 15 top).

        <p>The variation of the photon-index distribution of unassociated sources with Galactic latitude indicates that different populations coexist (see Figure 21 of the 4FGL paper), with the spectra becoming softer on average for lower Galactic latitudes. This observation justifies treating separately the cases of highand low-latitude unassociated sources. We set a somewhat arbitrary limit at |b| = 10°, with 1122 and 1018 unassociated point sources lying at higher and lower latitudes respectively.The variation of the photon-index distribution of unassociated sources with Galactic latitude indicates that different populations coexist (see Figure 21 of the 4FGL paper), with the spectra becoming softer on average for lower Galactic latitudes.

        <p>Drawing on the class-wise discriminating power of the photon-index distributions illustrated in Figure 14, the distribution for high-latitude unassociated sources is compared to that of BCUs, which are the most relevant blazar set given the low TS, in Figure 16 top. The good agreement between the two distributions supports the conclusion that most highlatitude unassociated sources are indeed blazars. 99 This conclusion is slightly qualified when considering the loci of the unassociated sources in the TS versus LP_TS curv plane (Figure 15 bottom). A significant fraction (;70%) of the higher-TS (TS &gt; 100) unassociated sources fall onto the pulsar branch, strongly suggesting that they are MSP. This idea is also supported by considering the evolution of the photon-index and variability-index distributions with TS (Figure 17). While for the lower-TS bins, the distributions quite closely match those of BCUs, clear differences are observed for the higher-TS bin (100 &lt; TS &lt; 500), where the distributions are compatible with those expected for MSP. In conclusion, their photon indices, significance of spectral curvature, and lack of variability make many of the high-latitude, 100 &lt; TS &lt; 500 unassociated sources good MSP candidates.Drawing on the class-wise discriminating power of the photon-index distributions illustrated in Figure 14, the distribution for high-latitude unassociated sources is compared to that of BCUs, which are the most relevant blazar set given the low TS, in Figure 16 top.

        <p>Since some AGN catalogs suffer from significant incompleteness close to the plane due to extinction, some background blazars detected through the plane could elude association and contribute to the unassociated sample. Based on the tallies observed at high latitude and the difference in flux limits due to the brighter diffuse emission background close to the plane, the number of |b| &lt; 10°blazars is estimated to be 340 ± 20, while 399 blazars are actually reported as associations in DR3.Since some AGN catalogs suffer from significant incompleteness close to the plane due to extinction, some background blazars detected through the plane could elude association and contribute to the unassociated sample.

        <p>Comparing the low-latitude photon-index distribution with that obtained for higher latitudes (normalized so that the total yield of Γ &lt; 2.4 sources match), an excess of soft sources (Γ ; 2.5) is found in the low-latitude sample relative to the other. From the difference of the spectral-index distributions, this excess, which was less pronounced in 3FGL and is very likely due to a contamination from a nonblazar population, amounts to 75 ± 4 sources. In conclusion, an excess of soft-spectra sources stands out in the low-latitude blazar sample. It can be attributed to a contamination from another population, likely of Galactic origin. After subtracting this excess from the number of reported blazars, the remaining number of detected blazars agrees reasonably well with that extrapolated from the highlatitude population (324 versus 340 ± 20). Few blazars with missed associations are thus expected to contribute to the lowlatitude unassociated sample.Comparing the low-latitude photon-index distribution with that obtained for higher latitudes (normalized so that the total yield of Γ &lt; 2.4 sources match), an excess of soft sources (Γ ; 2.5) is found in the low-latitude sample relative to the other.

        <p>The GU latitude distribution, shown in Figure 18, shows a narrow Gaussian-like component (;210 sources) centered on the plane, and two broad shoulders (;760 sources) extending out to about |b| = 10°(these components will be referred to as "spike" and "shoulders" respectively). The spike is narrower The loci of the unassociated sources close to the plane exhibit a notable clustering. Some high-density regions ("hot spots") are readily seen in Figure 19, while other areas are mostly devoid of unassociated sources. The clustering aspect also manifests itself in the large fraction (30%) of GUs with Flag 5 (i.e., close to a brighter neighbor). High-density regions have been determined using a HEALPix tesselation with N side = 8 produced in Galactic coordinates. The average density of GUs per pixel in the three pixel rows spanning the Galactic Plane is about 7. We define the high-density pixels as those encompassing more than 14 GUs, i.e., twice the average value. The photon-index distribution is compared to that of PSR in the lower panel of Figure 16. The distribution is remarkably narrow and contrasts sharply with that observed at higher latitude (Figure 16 top). It peaks around Γ = 2.5, with a tail toward lower Γ values. This tail might be due to blazars, SNRs, or PWNe (Figure 14). The high-Γ end of the distribution is peculiar. No established class of Galactic γ-ray emitters exhibits such a soft component.

        <p>A dedicated flag (Flag 14) has been devised to indicate SGUs that are in regions of relatively high source density as seen in Figure 19. Flag 14 is set for SGUs lying inside a highdensity pixel, having Γ &gt; 2.4, TS &lt; 500, and a closest neighbor (classified either as GU, SPP, or UNK) less than 2°away. Since most SPP or UNK sources probably belong to the same population as GUs as ascertained by their similar photon-index distributions (peaking around Γ = 2.5), they are also flagged if the above conditions are filled. Flag 14 is set for 446 SGUs, 54 SPPs, and 49 UNKs.100 SGUs were already significantly present in DR1, but their number in high-density regions has now increased by 50% (see census of Flag 14 in Table 4).A dedicated flag (Flag 14) has been devised to indicate SGUs that are in regions of relatively high source density as seen in Figure 19.

        <p>Returning to the spectral properties, the photon-index distribution is essentially constant across the plane, as illustrated in Figure 20 for different (not mutually exclusive) sky regions. In this figure, "clusters" refers to the high-density pixels mentioned above. The unassociated sources preferably lie within the pulsar branch in the LP_TS curv versus TS plane (Figure 21), supporting their spectral resemblance with pulsars. Their distribution of the LP curvature parameter β is also consistent with that of pulsars. Despite these similarities, other factors distinguish GUs and pulsars. First, the photon-index distributions do not closely match. The significant clustering observed also disfavors the possibility that GUs are mostly pulsars. Moreover, the low-b unassociated sources outnumber the detected PSR by about a factor of 9, making the scenario that so many pulsars have gone undetected so far implausible. The final blow to this possibility comes from their broad latitude distribution, which does not match that of PSR (nor any of the distributions of known γ-ray emitters for that matter). Older pulsars (&gt;10 6 yr), which could have drifted farther off the plane over time, exhibit a wider Galactic-latitude distribution, more compatible with that observed. However, these pulsars should be undetectable in γ-rays as they would have crossed the "pair-creation death line" (see Abdo et al. 2013).Returning to the spectral properties, the photon-index distribution is essentially constant across the plane, as illustrated in Figure 20 for different (not mutually exclusive) sky regions.

        <p>Most GUs exhibit a low source-to-background ratio (30% of them having the corresponding Flag 4 set). Whether they originate from mismodeled Galactic diffuse emission becomes a valid question. This emission is not fully understood, and its modeling suffers many uncertainties. To produce the Pass 8 model, 101 the contributions of different components, H I, CO, dark neutral medium, and inverse Compton, whose properties are established at larger wavelengths, were fitted to the data in 9 rings of increasing Galactocentric distances. An ad hoc component called the patch encapsulates the contributions of nontemplate components like the Galactic center excess, Loop I, or the Fermi bubbles. Other, yet-to-be-identified large scale structures may be (see Jóhannesson &amp; Porter 2021, for a search performed at high latitude), and a comprehensive analysis of the patch still needs to be carried out.

        <p>1. As mentioned above, SGUs may result from mismodeled Galactic diffuse emission. Allowing more flexibility to the model fitting by leaving free individual diffuse components, like H I and CO, would constrain the robustness of the SGU detections, if the templates used for the model are accurate on scales that are finer than the RoI size, while inaccurate on larger scales. 2. A possibility to be considered is that SGUs trace the large-scale regions associated with fresh injection of cosmic-rays, leading to locally harder γ-ray emission than assumed in the model components. A worthwhile test would be to investigate (e.g., by means of simulations) whether the spurious point-like sources spawned from a possible, not-accounted-for diffuse excess would share common spectral features with the observed SGUs. 3. Some SGUs could be spatially extended if they are related to structures in the diffuse emission. This would introduce some spectral distortion when analyzing them under the assumption that they are point-like, making them softer than really are. 4. Some correlation with the general structures of interstellar clouds is found by visual inspection, suggesting that the emission ascribed to SGUs could be due to molecular gas unaccounted for on small scales, e.g., because of saturated CO lines. This situation is reminiscent of that encountered in the EGRET era, which led to the discovery of "dark gas" (Grenier et al. 2005) and the suppression of about 30% of unassociated EGRET sources (Casandjian &amp; Grenier 2008) once a modified diffuse emission model was considered. Assessing the effect of saturated CO lines using 13 CO data would shed light on this possibility. 5. Alternative ways could be pursued to build the patch (diffuse emission that is not accounted for by standard components of the interstellar emission model) and distinguish it from point sources (e.g., Selig et al. 2015). 6. The alternative to mismodeled diffuse emission, namely the existence of an abundant, entirely new class of sources remains highly speculative. Follow-up multiwavelength studies (as in Bruzewski et al. 2021), e.g., of regions of high SGU densities or surrounding the brightest SGUs, could help elucidate this issue.1.

        <p>We applied a new method to check the quality of the global model of the sky (see Section 3.6).

Understanding the nature of these sources and what fraction are actually diffuse emission will be an important challenge, which could potentially lead to major advances like the discovery of the dark gas in the EGRET data (Grenier et al. 2005).We applied a new method to check the quality of the global model of the sky (see Section 3.6).

        <p>This work made extensive use of the ATNF pulsar catalog 102 (Manchester et al. 2005). This research has made use of the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED; 2019), which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and of archival data, software, and online services provided by the ASI Science Data Center (ASDC) operated by the Italian Space Agency. We used the Manitoba SNR catalog (Ferrand &amp; Safi-Harb 2012) to check recently published extended sources. We acknowledge the Einstein@Home project for providing new pulsar associations through the dedicated efforts of the Einstein@Home volunteers. The Einstein@Home project is supported by the NSF award 1816904.This work made extensive use of the ATNF pulsar catalog 102 (Manchester et al. 2005).

        <p>The FITS format version of the third release of the 4FGL catalog has seven binary table extensions. The extension LAT_Point_Source_Catalog Extension has all of the information about the sources, and has changed to adapt to the evolutions described in Section 3.4. Its format is described in Table 6. Columns (Unc_)PLEC_Index and (Unc_)PLE-C_Expfactor have been replaced by (Unc_)PLEC_In-dexS and (Unc_)PLEC_ExpfactorS corresponding to the new pulsar parameterization (Equation ( 2)). The table has 6659 rows for 6658 sources because the Crab Nebula is described by two entries (the synchrotron component and the inverse Compton component) but counted as only one source. The Crab pulsar is another entry and counted as a separate source. The extended sources are indicated by an "e" appended to their names in the main table.The FITS format version of the third release of the 4FGL catalog has seven binary table extensions.
