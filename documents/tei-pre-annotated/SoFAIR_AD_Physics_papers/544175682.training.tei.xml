        <p>The magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) is the core component in memory technologies, such as the magnetic random-access memory, magnetic sensors and programmable logic devices. In particular, MTJs based on two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures offer unprecedented opportunities for low power consumption and miniaturization of spintronic devices. However, their operation at room temperature remains a challenge. Here, we report a large tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) of up to 85% at room temperature (T = 300 K) in vdW MTJs based on a thin (&lt; 10 nm) semiconductor spacer WSe 2 layer embedded between two Fe 3 GaTe 2 electrodes with intrinsic above-room-temperature ferromagnetism. The TMR in the MTJ increases with decreasing temperature up to 164% at T = 10 K. The demonstration of TMR in ultra-thin MTJs at room-temperature opens a realistic and promising route for nextgeneration spintronic applications beyond the current state of the art.The magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) is the core component in memory technologies, such as the magnetic random-access memory, magnetic sensors and programmable logic devices.

        <p>Different from covalently bonded multilayer systems, van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures with atomically sharp and clean interfaces offer opportunities to build high-quality junctions without the requirement of lattice matching [9,10]. Specifically, the recent discovery of magnetic two-dimensional (2D) vdW materials, such as Cr 2 Ge 2 Te 6 [11], CrI 3 [12,13], Fe 3 GeTe 2 [14,15] and Fe 5 GeTe 2 [16] not only provide platforms for studies of novel physics phenomena, but also offer promising application prospects for 2D electronic devices where the spin is used as an extra degree of freedom [17][18][19].Different from covalently bonded multilayer systems, van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures with atomically sharp and clean interfaces offer opportunities to build high-quality junctions without the requirement of lattice matching [9,10].

        <p>Amongst the catalogue of magnetic 2D vdW materials, ferromagnet Fe 3 GeTe 2 has attracted extensive attention from worldwide researchers owing to its metallic nature and strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) [20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29]. At low temperatures, TMRs of 41% (10 K) and 300% (4.2 K) were reported in Fe 3 GeTe 2 /InSe/Fe 3 GeTe 2 MTJs [26] and Fe 3 GeTe 2 /hBN/Fe 3 GeTe 2 MTJs [30], respectively. As the temperature approaches the Curie temperature of Fe 3 GeTe 2 (T C , 220 K in bulk and 130 K in monolayer), the TMR of the Fe 3 GeTe 2 -based MTJs quickly decreases and vanishes [25,27,30,31]. Although the T C of 2D magnets can be tuned to room temperature by electrostatic gating [15], high-pressure [32] or interlayer magnetic coupling [33], the room temperature operation of vertical MTJs under these conditions remains a challenge, hindering prospects for future applications [34]. On the other hand, there is the ambition for all-2D room-temperature MTJs to be manufactured for production within the next decade [1]. This could be facilitated the recent discovery of the vdW A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t temperature T C of up to 380 K [35].Amongst the catalogue of magnetic 2D vdW materials, ferromagnet Fe 3 GeTe 2 has attracted extensive attention from worldwide researchers owing to its metallic nature and strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) [20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29].

        <p>As the magnetic moment of Ga and Te atoms in Fe 3 GaTe 2 are negligible, the ferromagnetism of Fe 3 GaTe 2 mainly comes from the 3d-orbital electrons in Fe atoms [35]. An exfoliated ~10 nm-thick Fe 3 GaTe 2 flake was used to fabricate a Hall-bar (Fig. 1b) and investigate the magnetic properties of Fe 3 GaTe 2 (fabrication details in Supplementary Note 1). The thickness of Fe 3 GaTe 2 is measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 1c upper-left inset). In the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) measurements, the longitudinal resistance R xx increases monotonically with increasing temperature, as expected for a metallic layer (Fig. 1c). ferromagnetic electrodes are separated by a non-magnetic WSe 2 spacer layer. The whole structure is capped with a hBN layer (typically 10-30 nm) to prevent degradation or oxidation once the MTJ is exposed to air (details of the fabrication in Supplementary Note 1). The semiconductor 2H-WSe 2 is a typical TMDC material in a hexagonal structure with space group P6 3 /mmc, consisting of van der Waals bonded Se-W-Se layers [37]. The bulk WSe 2 is an indirect-gap semiconductor with a band gap of 1.20 eV, while WSe 2 has a direct band gap of 1.65 eV in its monolayer form [38]. The AFM study of the MTJ indicates that the thickness of the spacer WSe 2 layer is ~ 7 nm (inset of Fig. 2b). To distinguish the coercivities of the top and bottom ferromagnetic electrodes in the MTJs, we selected Fe 3 GaTe 2 flakes with different thicknesses (~11 nm bottom Fe 3 GaTe 2 and ~17 nm top Fe 3 GaTe 2 ). The different switching fields of the top and bottom ferromagnetic layers enable the parallel and antiparallel configurations under different specific magnetic fields, corresponding to the low and high resistance states of the MTJ [39].

        <p>This is reflected by the reduction of the critical magnetic switching field of the MTJ in Figs. 3a-b. Interestingly, some TMR -V curves in Fig. 3a are asymmetric, indicating that the coercivity of Fe 3 GaTe 2 can be different at positive and negative magnetic field. This can be attributed to the defect-related pinning effect, which is weakened at high temperatures (Fig. 3b) [44]. The TMR can be defined as TMR = 2P 2 /(1 -P 2 ), where P = (D ↑ - D ↓ )/(D ↑ + D ↓ ) denotes the spin polarization at the Fermi-level (E F ) for the injector and detector Fe 3 GaTe 2 electrodes [45]. A room-temperature spin polarization P of 55 % is calculated by the TMR of 85%. As shown in Fig. 3d, the estimated temperature-dependence of the spin polarization can be fitted well by a power-law given by P = P 0 (1-T/T C ) β , where P 0 is the spin polarization at 0 K and β is a material-dependent constant that can be fitted to β = 0.137 [46,47]. Our fitting results also indicate that T C = 400 K, which is close to that obtained in Fig. 3b. Another MTJ shown in Fig. S4 shows a similar behaviour, but with a lower T C of 357 K (see Supplementary Note 2).This is reflected by the reduction of the critical magnetic switching field of the MTJ in Figs. 3a-b.

        <p>In summary, our results demonstrate that the vdW heterostructure An extremely large TMR of 210% in the device is observed at T = 10 K. Same as the device in the main text, the magnitude of the TMR decreases and vanishes above T C with increasing temperature (Fig. S4c). Interestingly, the TMR of this device (210%, 10K) is larger than that of the device in the main text (164%, 10K) at a low temperature, but the TMR of this device (53%, 300K) is smaller than that of the device in the main text (85%, 300K) at room temperature, which indicates that the TMR of this device decays more significantly with increasing temperature. This is caused by the difference in T C of Fe 3 GeTe 2 between the two devices. Fitted by power-law P = P 0 (1-T/T C ) β (Fig. S4d), we get a T C = 357 K of Fe 3 GeTe 2 in this device, which is lower than that of the device in the main text (T C = 400 K).

The source and drain electrode regions were pre-patterned by standard photolithography, and Cr/Au (10/40 nm) layers were deposited using an ultrahigh vacuum magnetron sputtering system, followed by a lift-off process. By a similar process, a Fe 3 GaTe 2 /hBN heterostructure was stamped onto four pre-patterned Cr/Au (10/15 nm) electrodes on a 300 nm thick SiO 2 /Si substrate to form a Hall-bar device. The electrodes of the Hall-bar device were patterned by standard electron beam lithography (EBL) and an ultrahigh vacuum magnetron sputtering, followed by a lift-off process.</p>
