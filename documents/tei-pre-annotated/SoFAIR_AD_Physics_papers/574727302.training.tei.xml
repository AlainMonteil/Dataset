        <p>Studying the impact of new-physics models on low-energy observables necessitates matching to effective field theories at the relevant mass thresholds. We introduce the first public version of Matchete, a computer tool for matching weakly-coupled models at one-loop order. It uses functional methods to directly compute all matching contributions in a manifestly gauge-covariant manner, while simplification methods eliminate redundant operators from the output. We sketch the workings of the program and provide examples of how to match simple Standard Model extensions. The package, documentation, and example notebooks are publicly available at https://gitlab.com/matchete/ matchete.Studying the impact of new-physics models on low-energy observables necessitates matching to effective field theories at the relevant mass thresholds.

        <p>The advent of the LHC heralded a new era for beyond-the-Standard-Model (BSM) physics. With the discovery of the Higgs boson and no direct signs of new resonances, we see indications of a mass gap up to the scale of yet-to-bediscovered new physics (NP). The focus of the community is shifting to precision flavor and electroweak physics in order to search for indirect signs of new particles and potentially probe scales far beyond the reach of resonance searches. The result has been a renaissance of Effective Field Theories (EFTs) applied to BSM physics often using the Standard Model Effective Theory (SMEFT), whose basis was first determined after the LHC went into service [1]. The use of EFTs goes all the way back to Fermi's theory and has long since reached maturity within the Standard Model (SM), facilitating SM predictions for many precision observables. Now, new methods are rapidly being developed for BSM physics with an aspiration of reaching a similar level of maturity. The new challenge to achieving this goal is the need for a near-complete level of generality, as the nature of NP has yet to be revealed.The advent of the LHC heralded a new era for beyond-the-Standard-Model (BSM) physics.

        <p>To determine the low-energy effects of high-scale NP, one typically has to perform sequential matching to consecutive EFTs at the relevant mass thresholds and renormalization group (RG) running between these scales. In the absence of any light new particles, the running and matching machinery is already available to handle computations below the NP mass threshold: the one-loop RG equations in the SMEFT [2][3][4][5], the matching to the Low-Energy Effective Theory (LEFT) at the weak scale [6][7][8], and the LEFT RG equations [9] have been determined and even implemented in computational tools [10][11][12]. Many tools are also available for phenomenological analyses of theories within the SMEFT and LEFT frameworks [13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24].To determine the low-energy effects of high-scale NP, one typically has to perform sequential matching to consecutive EFTs at the relevant mass thresholds and renormalization group (RG) running between these scales.

        <p>The sticking point for a long time has been performing the matching computation of BSM models to their EFTs. Although it is tempting to think of the target EFT as the SMEFT, we should bear in mind that realistic BSM constructions can contain a rich NP sector spanning large ranges of energy scales, calling for intermediate-scale EFTs. Alternatively, the presence of additional light fields, for example axion-like or dark-matter particles, demands extensions of the SMEFT (see, e.g., [25][26][27][28][29]). The unclear nature of both the UV model and the target EFT makes matching a formidable task. Functional methods promise a direct approach to the problem [30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49]. They entirely circumvent the matching of individual amplitudes and produce the EFT Lagrangian directly, albeit unsimplified, without requiring any prior knowledge about its structure or symmetries. The method has produced general results in the form of the Universal One-Loop Effective Action [50][51][52][53][54], several tools to assist part of the matching computations [55][56][57][58], and has been used for a number of simple BSM models [59][60][61][62][63][64]. Nevertheless, the package we present here represents the first truly automated, end-to-end one-loop matching tool based on functional methods, making it competitive with the diagrammatic matchmakereft [65] but with the advantages of the functional approach. Thanks to these new tools, fast and competent matching requiring little more than the press of a button is finally becoming feasible. Not only that, matching tools can easily be repurposed to compute RG equations for other EFTs, as both types of computations require the evaluation of loop integrals in the hard region.The sticking point for a long time has been performing the matching computation of BSM models to their EFTs.

        <p>Here we introduce a first public, proof-of-concept version (v
            <rs type="version">0.1.0</rs>) of the 
            <rs type="software">Mathematica</rs> package Matchete-Matching Effective Theories Efficiently -to solve the problem of matching weakly-coupled UV models to their EFTs at the relevant mass thresholds. It uses functional methods [44][45][46], which facilitates direct matching without the need for specifying a target basis for the EFT. This feature is especially useful in theories that match into EFTs other than the SMEFT or when extending EFT matching beyond dimension-six operators. The automated application of these methods was previously demonstrated by the authors in the 
            <rs type="software">SuperTracer</rs> package [57], which Matchete supersedes. Furthermore, we make significant headway with the challenging task of automatically simplifying the EFT Lagrangian to an on-shell basis. The design of the package includes a simple and user-friendly interface that considerably simplifies the user input while still allowing for very generic implementations. In essence, the user can write down the Lagrangian in a 
            <rs type="software">Mathematica</rs> notebook, in manner that is very close to a pen-and-paper form, and leave the rest to the package. While there are still many features and capabilities that we would like to implement over the next years, this proof-of-concept release already represents a major leap in the development of (functional) matching tools and can greatly assist many matching computations, including those in multiple BSM scenarios. The limitations in this release are reflected in the discussion of the future prospects of the package in Sect. 4. This paper is meant as a short introduction to give a flavor of the first public version of 
            <rs type="software">Matchete</rs>. The paper contains a brief description of the underlying package structure and gives some hands-on examples of how to use it. It is not a comprehensive guide to the use of the program. For more detailed instructions, the user is encouraged to consult the documentation notebook included with the distribution. Section 2 presents the organization and use of the package in broad scopes, touching on the specific methods used in the computation. This is followed with some concrete usage example in Sect. 3, including simple extensions of the SM, to give the reader a feel for the practical applications. We conclude the paper in Sect. 4 with a short discussion of the direction of future package developments.

        <p>Matchete is organized around Lagrangians and operators, which are the objects the user will interact with in the workflow illustrated in Fig. 1. With standard functional methods, a UV Lagrangian is matched to an EFT Lagrangian at treeand one-loop level. However, by nature of the functional approach, the EFT Lagrangian is not simplified and contains many redundant operators that need to be reduced to a basis. A core part of Matchete consists of powerful methods for simplifying the matching result to a (near-)basis to bridge the gap to a useful EFT Lagrangian. Various functions are also available for manipulating the output in various ways and identifying individual contributions. The simplification methods do not handle evanescent contributions yet, so the output is in a d-dimensional basis, which is redundant in a physical renormalization scheme [66].Matchete is organized around Lagrangians and operators, which are the objects the user will interact with in the workflow illustrated in Fig. 1.

        <p>All manner of group invariants show up in quantum-fieldtheory computations. These can be as simple as Kronecker deltas or generators of a representation, or they can be much more complicated once more exotic representations are involved. We will refer to all such invariant tensors as Clebsch-Gordan (CG) coefficients in line with the wellknown SU(2) case. We are unaware of analytic rules for evaluating generic contractions of CG coefficients that apply to all cases, so a more constructive approach is used in Matchete.All manner of group invariants show up in quantum-fieldtheory computations.

[68,69], which casts the problem in terms of linear algebra.

        <p>When the user specifies a simple (gauge) group to be included in a model, Matchete automatically generates several common representations and CG coefficients and more can be initialized by the user with build-in routines.

However, when contracting CG objects, the symbols are replaced internally with numerical tensors, contracted, and, finally, projected to a basis of CG coefficients. This procedure allows for efficient evaluation of CG products, with a minimum of inconvenience to the user.When the user specifies a simple (gauge) group to be included in a model, Matchete automatically generates several common representations and CG coefficients and more can be initialized by the user with build-in routines.

        <p>All objects in a Lagrangian have properties associated with them that are necessary for determining what algebraic manipulations are possible.

Although concise, the amount of information contained in a Lagrangian, or even an operator, is considerable, which can be useful for careful manipulations of the output should the user so desire. In most common cases, the user will want to exploit the convenience of the notebook format to view the output in a more legible form, and build-in routines allow the user to print Matchete objects in the format of a regular textbook.All objects in a Lagrangian have properties associated with them that are necessary for determining what algebraic manipulations are possible.

Couplings, similarly, need to be defined beforehand to specify their flavor indices and mass dimensions.Despite all the information contained in field objects, users can simply refer to them with their label (name) and the indices they might have.

        <p>Properly simplifying the output Lagrangian is a challenge related to the long-standing problem of finding a basis for the higher-dimensional operators of an EFT. We distinguish between simplification with exact identities (integration-byparts and group identities, and commutation relations), taking the Lagrangian to the Green's basis, and using field redefinitions to produce a simplified Lagrangian with on-shell equivalence. The exact simplification relates operators linearly, and can be applied to individual operators as well as the full EFT Lagrangian. On the other hand, field redefinitions work non-linearly and make sense only when acting on the EFT Lagrangian as a whole.Properly simplifying the output Lagrangian is a challenge related to the long-standing problem of finding a basis for the higher-dimensional operators of an EFT.

        <p>To reduce EFT Lagrangians to a Green's basis, we use methods from linear algebra, as this allows for efficient and robust simplifications. One can think of L EFT as an element in the vector space O equipped with a basis {O a } consisting of all operators in the absence of any exact identities. That is, the elements of this basis span the complete set of gauge and Lorentz-invariant monomials of the fields, their covariant derivatives, and CG coefficients (including Dirac matrices). This vector space is redundant once the exact identities, relating the basis operators, are accounted for. Each identity relation can be represented as a vector that is equivalent to 0. Together, the identity vectors span a subspace I ⊆ O, and we can identify the coset O/I with the set of Green's basis Lagrangians. Simplifying L EFT then comes down to finding a convenient basis for O/I and determining the representative element of the equivalence class [L EFT ] defined by the coset.To reduce EFT Lagrangians to a Green's basis, we use methods from linear algebra, as this allows for efficient and robust simplifications.

        <p>To arrive at the Green's basis in Matchete, we employ the following strategy: For all basis elements (operators) we encounter, we generate the complete set of possible identities using integration by parts, Jacobi identities, commutation of covariant derivatives, and gamma matrix identities (such as γ μ γ ν = g μνiσ μν ). Denoting the vectors in O corresponding to the resulting identities by I n , it follows that I = span {I n } .

        <p>Using these identities, all {O r } r ∈R can be eliminated from the representative element of [L EFT ], that is, the Green's basis Lagrangian. By absorption of gauge couplings into gauge fields, all entries in M are numbers, allowing for efficient matrix manipulations of M. The main challenge to implementing the simplification procedure described above is that of identifying identical operators based on their internal representation. To this end, Matchete relies heavily on pattern matching to identify, e.g., different labeling of the dummy indices, permutations of indices on symmetric tensors, and orderings of terms in products. By choosing an ordering of the basis {O a }, it is possible to dictate a preference as to what operators are considered redundant, that is, in {O r } r ∈R . While the choice is somewhat arbitrary, we can ensure that the maximal number of operators that can be removed with field redefinitions are kept in the basis. Additional requirements are enforced to ensure that the output Lagrangian is manifestly Hermitian.Using these identities, all {O r } r ∈R can be eliminated from the representative element of [L EFT ], that is, the Green's basis Lagrangian.

        <p>The main limitation of our current approach is the need to hard-code all possible identity types in Matchete. However, additional identities can be added in a modular manner. The initial version notably does not include Fierz identities, as the proper handling of these necessitate the evaluation of evanescent contributions [66]. This is something we expect to address in future updates. In any event, the lack of implementation of identities does not result in an invalid result from the simplification method, merely a non-minimal operator basis for L EFT as the full identity space I is not found.The main limitation of our current approach is the need to hard-code all possible identity types in Matchete.

        <p>After the simplifications outlined in the previous section have been performed, we are left with a Lagrangian that contains redundant operators that can be removed by field redefinitions. To classify these operators, we first define for each field type the object D (ψ) corresponding to the kinetic piece of the field EOM and whose definition is given in Table 1. Operators with at least one occurrence of D (ψ) can be removed from the Lagrangian employing a field redefinition of the field ψ.

        <p>When eliminating a redundant operator with D (ψ), the field redefinitions will generate contributions only at higher order in the EFT power counting or at the same dimension but with fewer derivatives. In practice, therefore, one proceeds in an iterative fashion, seeking out redundant operators at the lowest order in the EFT counting and removing them by field redefinitions. The lowest-order operators that can appear here are kinetic-mixing terms at dimension four. At higher powers, the procedure needs to be repeated since operators may contain more than one D (ψ) object, and the redefinition removes only one occurrence. Once all redundant terms are removed at a given order in power-counting, the procedure is repeated at the next order, until no more redundant operators remain.When eliminating a redundant operator with D (ψ), the field redefinitions will generate contributions only at higher order in the EFT power counting or at the same dimension but with fewer derivatives.

        <p>Despite its limitations, this proof-of-concept version of Matchete already automates EFT matching computations for a wide class of weakly-coupled UV models. Models with an arbitrary particle content can be matched at tree-level, and automated one-loop matching for any model with heavy scalars and/or fermions (but no heavy vectors) is now possible. These matching steps can be performed up to arbitrary order in the heavy-mass expansion without requiring any further input from the user. This is subject to constraints from the fast growth in computing time and memory requirements with increasing mass dimension, an area in which there is still room for improvement in future releases. While these functionalities certainly leave out many relevant models, they can already be used in multiple phenomenologically interesting applications.

        <p>As we discuss in the next section, we intend to expand these functionalities to cover an even wider range of applications. Moreover, the automated simplification routines contained in 
            <rs type="software">Matchete</rs>, although not exhaustive, introduce entirely new capabilities to the EFT toolbox. While other tools [91][92][93] deduce a suitable EFT basis, the simplification routines of 
            <rs type="software">Matchete</rs> automatically simplify an EFT with redundant operators and bring it to a form with mostly 123 Fig. 2 Roadmap for the future capabilities of 
            <rs type="software">Matchete</rs>. The workflow contained in the blue boxes are implemented in the proof-ofconcept version, whereas the orange boxes are features expected in future releases. Here Standard format output refers to both EFT basis identification and interfacing with other EFT tools basis operators. 9 Despite some redundant operators persisting in some cases, the current implementation goes most of the way towards producing an EFT in a basis form. Failures to reach the basis with the current implementation are not critical, as on-/off-shell equivalence is preserved. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at automatic simplification without any basis-specific hard-coded identities. These routines becomes particularly useful in studies where higherdimensional operators are involved (see e.g. Refs. [83,84,[94][95][96] for recent literature examples), as the operator-reduction identities needed to obtain a basis are typically harder to implement due to the large proliferation of terms.

        <p>In this article, we have introduced the first version of Matchete and sketched out the workings of its routines. Already in this first version, it has great utility and versatility and can perform the matching of a wide range of UV models without any additional input for group theory or EFT bases: In its current form, Matchete is able to integrate out heavy scalars and fermions at the one-loop level, as well as heavy vectors at tree-level, with no restriction on the mass dimension of the effective theory, other than computing time limitations. As demonstrated in Sect. 3, this already proves useful for a variety of concrete applications. Furthermore, the simplification routines can be used to automatically reduce Lagrangians to a close-to-basis form, even if the tool is not used for matching.In this article, we have introduced the first version of Matchete and sketched out the workings of its routines.

Our roadmap for future functionality includes addressing the following points:It is also clear that we can enhance the capabilities of Matchete even further. Our roadmap for future functionality includes addressing the following points:</p>
        <p>• Currently, the matching is performed in strictly d dimensions, which prevents EFT simplifications to the fourdimensional basis. We intend to implement the methods of Ref. [66] for defining a physical projection on the operator space and matching the remnant evanescent operator to the physical space. • After the implementation of routines for handling the evanescent operators, it will be possible to reduce EFT Lagrangians all the way to specific four-dimensional bases. The idea is to use this to obtain matching results as Wilson coefficients of known EFT bases, such as the Warsaw basis for the SMEFT or the LEFT basis of Ref. [7]. Hence, it will be possible to interface the result with phenomenology packages through export in the WCxf [97] format. The interface with other phenomenology tools and/or commonly used formats, such as UFO [98], would also be desirable. • The restriction of heavy states to scalars and fermions is the primary limitation of Matchete v0.1.0. In weakly-coupled theories, heavy vectors must arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking. This results in a complicated interplay between vectors, ghosts, and Goldstone bosons, especially in the background field gauge. So as to avoid having to derive and input all interactions manually, we wish to provide (semi-)automated methods to determine the broken phase Lagrangian. • With small changes to the matching procedure, it is possible to determine the EFT counterterms and, thereby, the RG functions. Implementing this functionality in 
            <rs type="software">Matchete</rs> will allow for finding the RG functions for intermediate-scale EFTs and vastly simplify sequential matching scenarios.
        </p>
        <p>In Fig. 2 we show how the future functionalities fit into the 
            <rs type="software">Matchete</rs> workflow. The roadmap is our vision for the future of the 
            <rs type="software">Matchete</rs> package. It is of course subject to changes, as we determine what features are most important, or if the implementation of the functions becomes problematic. Automated tools like 
            <rs type="software">Matchete</rs> have the potential to fundamentally change the workflow of BSM physics. They allow the practitioner to focus less on mechanical tasks and instead concentrate on finding answers to open questions in physics. Even with its current limitations, the proof of concept for Matchete already provides a valuable tool for NP phenomenology, and it demonstrates that functional methods offer a natural formulation of the matching (and RG running) procedure.
