The nuclear modification factor, comparing D 0 meson yields in PbPb and pp collisions, was extracted for both minimum-bias and the 10% most central PbPb interactions.

        <p>Relativistic heavy ion collisions allow the study of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at high energy density and temperature. Lattice QCD calculations predict that under such extreme conditions a transition to a strongly interacting and deconfined medium, called the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), occurs [1][2][3]. Heavy quarks are effective probes to study the properties of the deconfined medium created in heavy ion collisions. These quarks are mostly produced in primary hard QCD scatterings with a production timescale that is shorter than the formation time of the QGP [4]. During their propagation through the medium, heavy quarks lose energy via radiative and collisional interactions with the medium constituents. Quarks are expected to lose less energy than gluons as a consequence of their smaller colour factor. In addition, the socalled "dead-cone effect" is expected to reduce small-angle gluon radiation of heavy quarks when compared to both gluons and light quarks [5][6][7]. Energy loss can be studied using the nuclear modification factor (R AA ), defined as the ratio of the PbPb yield to the pp cross-section scaled by the nuclear overlap function [8].

        <p>A maximum suppression by a factor of 5-6 with respect to the pp reference was observed for the 10% most central collisions at p T of about 10 GeV/c. A suppression by a factor of about 3 was measured at the highest p T range studied, from 25 to 35 GeV/c. The D meson R AA was found to be consistent with that for all charged particles for p T from 6 to 36 GeV/c. For lower p T , the D meson R AA was observed to be slightly higher than the charged-particle R AA , although still compatible within the uncertainties [11,12]. At RHIC, the R AA of D 0 mesons for the 10% most central AuAu collisions at p T larger than 3 GeV/c was seen. This suggests that a significant energy loss of charm quarks in the hot medium also occurs at RHIC energies. A first indication of a sizeable difference in the R AA of B and D mesons was observed when comparing the ALICE D meson R AA with the nonprompt J / ψ meson (i.e. from b-hadron decays) R AA measurement performed by the CMS Collaboration in PbPb collisions at the same energy and collision centrality [14]. The R AA of nonprompt J / ψ mesons in the p T range 6.5-30 GeV/c was indeed found to be significantly larger than the R AA of D mesons in the 8-16 GeV/c p T region for central events. The D 0 p T range was chosen to give a similar median p T value to that of the parent b hadrons decaying to J / ψ particles [9]. Several measurements were also performed to address the relevance of cold nuclear matter effects for the suppression observed for heavy-flavour particles. Indeed, these phenomena can affect the yield of such particles, independently of the presence of a deconfined partonic medium. For instance, modifications of the parton distribution functions (PDFs) in the nucleus with respect to nucleon PDFs [15][16][17] could change the production rate of heavy-flavour particles. To evaluate the relevance of these effects, the production of prompt D mesons was measured in pPb collisions at mid-rapidity at 5.02 TeV by the ALICE Collaboration [18]. The nuclear modification factor in pPb collisions (R pA ) was found to be consistent within the 15-20% uncertainties with unity for p T from 2 to 24 GeV/c. This suggests that the suppression of D mesons observed in PbPb collisions cannot be explained in terms of initial-state effects but is mostly due to strong final-state effects induced by the QGP. A similar conclusion was obtained from the study of the R pA of B mesons in pPb collisions at 5.02 TeV, where values consistent with unity within the uncertainties were found for p T from 10 to 60 GeV/c [19].A maximum suppression by a factor of 5-6 with respect to the pp reference was observed for the 10% most central collisions at p T of about 10 GeV/c.

        <p>The pp (PbPb) dataset used for this analysis corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 27.4 pb -1 (530 μb -1 ). The D 0 meson production is measured from p T of 2 up to 20 GeV/c using large samples of minimum-bias (MB) events (≈2.5 billion pp events and ≈300 million PbPb events). Minimum-bias events were selected online using the information from the HF calorimeters and the beam pickup monitors. For measuring the D 0 meson production above 20 GeV/c, dedicated high-level trigger (HLT) algorithms were designed to identify online events with a D 0 candidate. Since events with a high-p T D 0 meson are expected to leave large energy deposits in HCAL, HLT algorithms were run on events preselected by jet triggers in the level-1 (L1) calorimeter trigger system. In PbPb collisions, the D 0 triggers with p T threshold below 40 GeV/c were run on events passing the L1 MB trigger selection. While the MB and lower-threshold triggers had to be prescaled because of the high instantaneous luminosity of the LHC, the highest threshold trigger used in the analysis (p T &gt; 60 (50) GeV/c for PbPb (pp) data taken) was always unprescaled. The efficiency of the HLT algorithms was evaluated in data, and modelled by a linear function of D 0 p T . The efficiency was found to be about 100 (90)% in pp (PbPb) collisions for events passing the corresponding L1 selection.The pp (PbPb) dataset used for this analysis corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 27.4 pb -1 (530 μb -1 ).

        <p>For the offline analysis, events have to pass a set of selection criteria designed to reject events from background processes (beam-gas collisions and beam scraping events) as described in Ref. [21]. In order to select hadronic collisions, both pp and PbPb events are required to have at least one reconstructed primary interaction vertex with a distance from the centre of the nominal interaction region of less than 15 cm along the beam axis. In addition, in PbPb collisions the shapes of the clusters in the pixel detector have to be compatible with those expected from particles produced by a PbPb collision [22]. The PbPb collision events are also required to have at least three towers in each of the HF detectors with energy deposits of more than 3 GeV per tower. The combined efficiency for this event selection, and the remaining nonhadronic contamination, is (99 ± 2)%. Selection efficiencies higher than 100% are possible, reflecting the possible presence of ultraperipheral (nonhadronic) collisions in the selected event sample. The collision centrality is determined from the total transverse energy deposition in both the HF calorimeters.

        <p>Several Monte Carlo (MC) simulated event samples are used to evaluate background components, signal efficiencies, and detector acceptance corrections. The events produced include both prompt and nonprompt (from b hadron decays) D 0 meson events. Proton-proton collisions are generated with pythia 8 v212 [23] tune CUETP8M1 [24] and propagated through the CMS detector using the 
            <rs type="software">Geant4</rs> package [25]. The D 0 mesons are decayed with evtgen 1.3.0 [26], and final-state photon radiation in the D 0 decays is simulated with photos 2.0 [27]. For the PbPb MC samples, each pythia 8 event is embedded into a PbPb collision event generated with hydjet 1.8 [28], which is tuned to reproduce global event properties such as the charged-hadron p T spectrum and particle multiplicity.

Each track is required to have p T &gt; 1 GeV/c in order to reduce the combinatorial background. For high-p T D 0 mesons (above 20 GeV/c) in PbPb data, the single track cut is raised to p T &gt; 8.5 GeV/c to account for the selection (p T &gt; 8 GeV/c) performed at the HLT. All tracks are also required to be within |η| &lt; 1.5. For each pair of selected tracks, two D 0 candidates are created by assuming that one of the particles has the mass of the pion while the other has the mass of the kaon, and vice-versa. The D 0 mesons are required to be within |y| &lt; 1, optimised in conjunction to the track pseudorapidity selection to give the best signal to background ratio over the whole range of D 0 p T studied. In order to further reduce the combinatorial background, the D 0 candidates are selected based on three topological criteria: on the three-dimensional (3D) decay length L xyz normalised to its uncertainty (required to be larger than 4-6), on the pointing angle θ p (defined as the angle between the total momentum vector of the tracks and the vector connecting the primary and the secondary vertices and required to be smaller than 0.12), and on the χ 2 probability, divided by the number of degrees of freedom, of the D 0 vertex fit (required to be larger than 0.025-0.05).

        <p>The yields are affected by several sources of systematic uncertainties arising from the signal extraction, acceptance and efficiency corrections, branching fraction, and integrated luminosity determination. The uncertainty in the raw yield extraction (1.6-8.2% for pp and 1.3-17.5% for PbPb data, with the highest value at low-p T , which is the region with the smallest signal to background ratio) is evaluated by repeating the fit procedure using different background fit functions and by forcing the widths of the Gaussian functions that describe the signal to be equal to the values extracted in simulations to account for possible differences in the signal resolution in data and in MC. In the background variation study, an exponential plus a second-order polynomial function was considered instead of the first order polynomial one, which is used as default. The final uncertainty in the raw yield extraction is defined as the sum in quadrature of the relative differences of the signal variation and the maximum of all the background variations.The yields are affected by several sources of systematic uncertainties arising from the signal extraction, acceptance and efficiency corrections, branching fraction, and integrated luminosity determination.

To evaluate this uncertainty for the R AA measurement, the widths of the template distributions are varied simultaneously in pp and PbPb.

        <p>The results are also compared to calculations of four types of models: (a) two perturbative QCD-based models that include both collisional and radiative energy loss, (M. Djordjevic [37] and CUJET 3.0 [38][39][40]) and one that includes radiative energy loss only (I. Vitev [41,42]), (b) a transport model based on a Langevin equation that includes collisional energy loss and heavy-quark diffusion in the medium (S. Cao et al. [43,44]), (c) a microscopic off-shell transport model based on a Boltzmann approach that includes collisional energy loss only (PHSD [45,46]), and (d) a model based on the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, that includes thermal fluctuations in the energy loss for heavy quarks in a strongly coupled plasma [47]. The AdS/CFT calculation is provided for two settings of the diffusion coefficient D of the heavy quark propagation through the medium: dependent on, and independent of the quark momentum. For D 0 meson p T &gt; 40 GeV/c, the perturbative QCD-based models describe the suppression in both centrality ranges within the uncertainties, although the trend suggested by these predictions is typically lower than that in the experimental data. The model based on a Langevin approach describes the measurement well in the centrality range 0-100%, while it predicts slightly too much suppression for central events. The AdS/CFT calculations describe well both the 0-100% and the 0-10% measurements. In the intermediate p T region (10 &lt; p T &lt; 40 GeV/c), all the theoretical calculations describe well the R AA results in both centrality intervals. For p T &lt; 10 GeV/c, the PHSD prediction that includes shadowing can reproduce the measurement in the 0-100% centrality region accurately, while the Langevin calculation predicts significantly more suppression than seen in data for both centrality ranges. In the same low-p T region, the AdS/CFT calculation lies at the lower limit of the experimental uncertainties for both 0-10% and 0-100% measurements. The D 0 R AA measured in the centrality range 0-100% is compared in the top panel of Fig. 4 to the CMS measurements of the R AA of charged particles [21], B ± mesons [48] and nonprompt J / ψ meson [49] performed at the same energy and in the same centrality range. The systematic uncertainties between the R AA measurement of the D 0 mesons, and of the light and beauty particles, are almost completely uncorrelated. The only common contribution comes from the systematic uncertainty of one track (4%), which is however negligible when compared to the total uncertainties. The D 0 meson R AA values are consistent with those of charged particles for p T &gt; 4 GeV/c. For lower p T , a somewhat smaller suppression for D 0 mesons is observed. The R AA of the B ± mesons, measured in the p T range 7-50 GeV/c and the rapidity range of |y| &lt; 2.4, is also consistent with the D 0 meson measurement within the experimental uncertainties. The R AA of nonprompt J / ψ , which was found to have almost no rapidity dependence [49], is shown here measured in the p T ranges 6.5-50 GeV/c in |y| &lt; 2.4, and 3-6.5 GeV/c in 1.8 &lt; |y| &lt; 2.4. Its R AA is found to be higher than the D 0 meson R AA in almost the entire p T range. The D 0 meson R AA in the centrality range 0-10% is compared in Fig. 4 to the chargedparticle R AA .
