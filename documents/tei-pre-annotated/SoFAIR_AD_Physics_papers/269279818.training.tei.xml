        <p>Coupling a two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor heterostructure to a superconductor opens new research and technology opportunities, including fundamental problems in mesoscopic superconductivity, scalable superconducting electronics, and new topological states of matter. One route towards topological matter is by coupling a 2D electron gas with strong spin-orbit interaction to an s-wave superconductor. Previous efforts along these lines have been adversely affected by interface disorder and unstable gating. Here we show measurements on a gateable InGaAs/InAs 2DEG with patterned epitaxial Al, yielding devices with atomically pristine interfaces between semiconductor and superconductor. Using surface gates to form a quantum point contact (QPC), we find a hard superconducting gap in the tunnelling regime. When the QPC is in the open regime, we observe a first conductance plateau at 4e 2 /h, consistent with theory. The hard-gap semiconductor-superconductor system demonstrated here is amenable to top-down processing and provides a new avenue towards low-dissipation electronics and topological quantum systems.Coupling a two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor heterostructure to a superconductor opens new research and technology opportunities, including fundamental problems in mesoscopic superconductivity, scalable superconducting electronics, and new topological states of matter.

        <p>ecent work on semiconductor nanowires has offered evidence for the existence of Majorana zero modes, a signature of topological superconductivity [1][2][3] . A characteristic of the first studies in this area was significant subgap tunnelling conductance (a so-called soft gap), attributed to disorder at the semiconductor-superconductor (Sm-S) interface 4,5 . In nanowires, the soft-gap problem was recently resolved by growing Al epitaxially on InAs nanowires, yielding greatly reduced subgap conductance 6,7 . Studies of Sm-S systems based on top-down processed gateable two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) coupled to superconductors have not explicitly addressed the soft-gap issue yet 8,9 . However experiments on such systems have demonstrated other theoretical predictions, such as quantization of critical current [9][10][11] , the retro-reflection property of Andreev scattering 12 , and spectroscopy of a gate-defined quantum dot with superconducting leads 13,14 , which do not require a hard proximity-induced gap in the semiconductor.ecent work on semiconductor nanowires has offered evidence for the existence of Majorana zero modes, a signature of topological superconductivity [1][2][3] .

        <p>The two main results we present in this paper are both consequences of the transparent epitaxial Sm-S interface and overcome the soft gap problem for 2D electron gases. The first is a doubling of the the lowest quantized conductance plateau, from 2e 2 /h in the normal state to 4e 2 /h in the superconducting state, as predicted theoretically 15 . The second is a strong suppression of conductance for voltages smaller than the superconducting gap when the quantum point contact (QPC) is in the tunnelling regime-that is, the detection of a hard superconducting gap in a proximitized 2DEG. Conductance doubling arises from Andreev reflection transferring charge 2e into the superconductor 16 . The hard gap reflects the absence of electronic states below the superconducting gap in the semiconductor. Using gate voltage to control the QPC, we measure conductance across the transition from weak tunnelling to the open-channel regime and find good (but not perfect) agreement with the theory of a normal-QPCsuperconductor structure 15 .The two main results we present in this paper are both consequences of the transparent epitaxial Sm-S interface and overcome the soft gap problem for 2D electron gases.

        <p>A scanning electron micrograph of Device 1 is shown in Fig. 1b. The conductance of the QPC is tuned by negative voltages applied to the gates. The QPC is located B150 nm in front of the region where the Al film has not been removed. Figure 2 shows conductance traces for two lithographically similar QPCs. In the superconducting state, both devices show increased conductance at the plateau of the QPC and suppressed conductance below GB0.8G 0 , where G 0 2e 2 /h, relative to the normal state. This behaviour is the hallmark of Andreev reflection being the dominant conduction mechanism through the QPC 15,19 . Raising the temperature above the critical temperature of the Al film, applying an out-of-plane magnetic field, or applying a bias larger than the gap, all bring the lowest plateau back to 2e 2 /h (Fig. 2). The dip structure at the transition between conductance plateaus was also observed in a similar experiment on nanowires 20 , and is presumably caused by mode mixing due to disorder, leading to a reduction in transparency of the already open first channel.
