        <p>Photochemistry is a fundamental process of planetary atmospheres that regulates the atmospheric composition and stability 1 . However, no unambiguous photochemical products have been detected in exoplanet atmospheres so far. Recent observations from the JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science Program 2,3 found a spectral absorption feature at 4.05 μm arising from sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) in the atmosphere of WASP-39b. WASP-39b is a 1.27-Jupiter-radii, Saturn-mass (0.28 M J ) gas giant exoplanet orbiting a Sun-like star with an equilibrium temperature of around 1,100 K (ref. 4). The most plausible way of generating SO 2 in such an atmosphere is through photochemical processes 5,6 . Here we show that the SO 2 distribution computed by a suite of photochemical models robustly explains the 4.05-μm spectral feature identified by JWST transmission observations 7 with NIRSpec PRISM (2.7σ) 8 and G395H (4.5σ) 9 . SO 2 is produced by successive oxidation of sulfur radicals freed when hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is destroyed. The sensitivity of the SO 2 feature to the enrichment of the atmosphere by heavy elements (metallicity) suggests that it can be used as a tracer of atmospheric properties, with WASP-39b exhibiting an inferred metallicity of about 10× solar. We further point out that SO 2 also shows observable features at ultraviolet and thermal infrared wavelengths not available from the existing observations. Article in the reduced form, such that H 2 S is the primary sulfur reservoir in a hydrogen/helium-dominated gas giant [11][12][13][14] . At the temperature of WASP-39b, the equilibrium mixing ratio of SO 2 in the observable part of the atmosphere is less than about 10 -12 for 10× solar metallicity and less than about 10 -9 for even 100× solar metallicity (see Extended Data Fig. 1). This equilibrium abundance of SO 2 is several orders of magnitude smaller than the values needed to produce the spectral feature observed by JWST (volume mixing ratios (VMRs) of 10 -6 -10 -5 ) 8,9 . By contrast, under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, SO 2 can be oxidized from H 2 S as a photochemical product. H and OH radicals, generated by photolysis processes, are key to liberating SH radicals and atomic S from H 2 S and subsequently oxidizing them to SO and SO 2 . Although previous photochemical modelling studies have shown that substantial SO 2 can be produced in hydrogen-rich exoplanet atmospheres in this way 5,6,13,15,16 , the extent to which such a model could reproduce the current WASP-39b observations remained unverified.Photochemistry is a fundamental process of planetary atmospheres that regulates the atmospheric composition and stability 1 .

        <p>The peak mixing ratios of the main sulfur species produced by the different photochemical models are largely consistent with each other to within an order of magnitude, as shown in Fig. 1. The SO 2 mixing ratio profiles are highly variable with altitude and strongly peaked at 0.01-1 mbar with a value of 10-100 ppm. SO 2 (along with CO 2 ) is more favoured at the cooler morning terminator, at which H 2 S is less stable against reaction with atomic H at depth (with SO 2 abundance peak of 50-90 ppm at the morning terminator and 15-30 ppm at the evening terminator). Although the peak SO 2 abundance from the photochemical models is greater than that estimated from fitting to the PRISM and Oxidation state of S +3 Fig. 2 | A simplified schematic of the chemical pathways of sulfur species. H 2 S, which is the stable sulfur-bearing molecule at thermochemical equilibrium in an H 2 atmosphere, readily reacts with atomic H to form SH radicals and, subsequently, atomic S in the photochemical region (above about 0.1 mbar). Reaction of S with photochemically generated OH then produces SO, which is further oxidized to SO 2 . The thick arrows denote efficient reactions and M denotes any third body. Inefficient reactions and inactive paths in the temperature regime of WASP-39b are greyed out.

Our models indicate that S, S 2 and SO, which are precursors of SO 2 , also reach high abundances in the upper atmosphere above the pressure level at which H 2 S is destroyed. Nevertheless, they are not expected to manifest observable spectral features in the PRISM/G395H wavelength range.G395H data, which assumed vertically constant mixing ratios of about 1-10 ppm and about 2.5-4.6 ppm, respectively, the column-integrated number densities above 10 mbar are highly consistent (see Methods).

        <p>Water photolysis in equation ( 1) is an important source of atomic H that initiates the pathway. The last step of oxidizing SO into SO 2 is generally the rate-limiting step. The oxidization of SO and photolysis of SO 2 account for the main sources and sinks of SO 2 , which lead to altitude-varying distribution that peaks around 0.1 mbar (see Extended Data Fig. 4). At high pressures with less available OH, reactions involving S 2 become important in oxidizing S (see Methods). The growth of elemental sulfur allotropes beyond S 2 effectively stops for temperatures higher than approximately 750 K (refs. 5,6).Water photolysis in equation ( 1) is an important source of atomic H that initiates the pathway.

        <p>Figure 3 shows the morning/evening averaged transmission spectra resulting from the different photochemical models. All models are able to reproduce the strength and shape of the 4.05-μm SO 2 feature seen in the NIRSpec PRISM and G395H modes. The scatter in the model spectra is on par with the uncertainties of the data and is attributed to the spread in the vertical VMR structure of SO 2 and CO 2 produced by each model (Fig. 1). Also shown in Fig. 3 are the predicted spectra in the MIRI LRS wavelength range (5-12 μm), which exhibit prominent SO 2 features around 7.5 μm and 8.8 μm, as well as an upward slope redward of 12 μm owing to CO 2 .

        <p>H 2 S, S 2 , SO 2 and SH produce a sharp opacity gradient shortward of 0.38 μm (Extended Data Fig. 7), at which the room-temperature UV cross-sections are used except those at 800 K for SH. The discrepancy between the models and previous HST STIS and VLT/FORS2 observations 19 (see Fig. 3) within 0.38-0.5 μm could potentially be because of enhanced UV opacities at high temperatures and/or aerosol particles. Further characterization of the sulfur species spectral features in the UV is promising with the scheduled HST/UVIS observation (Program 17162, principal investigators: Z. Rustamkulov and D. Sing). SO 2 has recently been suggested as a promising tracer of metallicity in giant exoplanet atmospheres 16 . To test this and show trends in atmospheric properties, we have conducted sensitivity analysis on metallicity as well as temperature and vertical mixing using 
            <rs type="software">VULCAN</rs> (see Methods for details and further tests on C/O and stellar UV flux). Figure 4a summarizes these results for SO 2 , along with H 2 O and CO 2 , which are more commonly used as proxies for atmospheric metallicity 13,[20][21][22] . Overall, the average abundance of SO 2 in the pressure region relevant for such observation is not strongly sensitive to temperature or vertical mixing once SO 2 has reached observable ppm levels and is mildly sensitive to C/O (see Extended Data Fig. 5). By contrast, SO 2 shows either a similar or a stronger dependence on metallicity compared with H 2 O and CO 2 . This sensitivity to metallicity can be understood from the net reaction (equation (1)), in which it takes one molecule of H 2 S and two molecules of H 2 O to make one SO 2 . Although SO 2 can be further oxidized into SO 3 , which requires extra oxygen, SO 3 is rarely produced to an observable level in a H 2 -dominated atmosphere. Therefore, SO 2 can be an ideal tracer of heavy-element enrichment for giant planets, with given constraints on the temperature and stellar far-ultraviolet (FUV) flux. The applicability of SO 2 as a tracer of metallicity is further shown in Fig. 4b, in which the increase in the SO 2 feature amplitude between 5× and 20× solar metallicity is much greater than that of CO 2 and H 2 O. As such, retrieval analyses seeking to evaluate the atmospheric metallicity of warm giant exoplanets can substantially benefit from both CO 2 and SO 2 measurements.

        <p>Our results demonstrate the importance of considering photochemistry-and sulfur chemistry in particular-in warm exoplanet atmospheres when interpreting exoplanet atmospheric observations. Exoplanet photochemistry has been investigated using numerical models since the detection of an atmosphere on a transiting exoplanet 23,24 , followed by a diverse set of subsequent studies explaining the interplay of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen and sulfur (see, for example, ref. 25 for a review). It has been further pointed out that sulfur can affect other nonsulfur species, such as atomic H, CH 4 and NH 3 (refs. 6,15; also see Extended Data Fig. 6). Temperature trends in the photochemical production of sulfur species (Extended Data Fig. 10) in exoplanet atmospheres are potentially observable with features in the UV and infrared (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 7). At temperatures higher than that of WASP-39b, SH and SO may become relatively more abundant than SO 2 (refs. 6,13,15). Observing these compositional variations with temperature in H 2 -dominated atmospheres, modulated by the atmospheric metallicity, could substantially improve our understanding of high-temperature chemical networks and atmospheric properties. The observational effort should also be complemented by a more accurate determination of key chemical reaction rate constants and UV cross-sections at the relevant temperatures (for example, refs. 26,27), as well as photochemical modelling development beyond 1D that includes horizontal transport (for example, refs. 28-30).Our results demonstrate the importance of considering photochemistry-and sulfur chemistry in particular-in warm exoplanet atmospheres when interpreting exoplanet atmospheric observations.

        <p>The accessibility of sulfur species in exoplanet atmospheres through the aid of photochemistry allows for a new window into planet-formation processes, whereas in the Solar System gas giants, the temperature is sufficiently low that sulfur is condensed out as either H 2 S clouds or together with NH 3 as ammonium hydrosulfide (NH 4 SH) clouds 31 , making it more difficult to observe. Sulfur has been detected in protoplanetary disks 32 , in which it may be primarily in refractory form 33 , making it a reference element showing the metallicity contributions of accreted solid and gas [34][35][36] .

Furthermore, this full condensation is unlikely because sulfide condensates generally have high surface energies 43,44 that inhibit efficient nucleation, consistent with the detection of gaseous sodium on WASP-39b (ref. 8).Although the temperatures of WASP-39b cross several condensation curves of sulfide clouds, such as Na 2 S and ZnS, the gas composition is not expected to be markedly affected.

The peak of heating owing to SO 2 is comparable with a grey opacity of 0.05 cm 2 g -1 over 220-800 nm and could potentially raise the temperatures around 0.1 mbar (the visible grey opacity for the irradiation of WASP-39b irradiation is about 0.005 cm 2 g -1 (ref. 50)). Nevertheless, this heating effect does not change our main conclusions about photochemically forming SO 2 on WASP-39b. As long as temperatures do not fall below roughly 750 K, at which sulfur allotrope formation starts to take over, SO 2 is not too sensitive to temperature increases up to 100 K.Our estimate shows that SO 2 contributed the most in our WASP-39b model, rather than SH and S 2 being the main shortwave absorbers for atmospheres with solar-like metallicity 13,49 .

        <p>We require the high-energy spectral energy distribution (SED) of the WASP-39 host star as input to drive our set of photochemical models. However, as an inactive mid G-type star (T eff = 5,485 ± 50 K; ref. 51) at a distance of 215 pc (Gaia DR3), WASP-39 is too faint for high-S/N UV spectroscopy with HST. To approximate the stellar radiation incident on WASP-39b, we created a custom stellar SED that combines direct spectroscopy of WASP-39 in the optical (with HST/STIS G430L and G750L modes; GO 12473, principal investigator: D. Sing) with representative spectra from analogous stars at shorter wavelengths. Our approach to estimating the UV stellar SED was based on two factors: (1) in the near-ultraviolet (NUV; 2,300-2,950 Å), in which the flux is dominated by the photosphere, we chose a proxy with a similar spectral type to WASP-39 and (2) in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) and FUV (1-2,300 Å), in which the stellar flux is dominated by chromospheric, transition region and coronal emission lines, we chose a proxy star with similar chromospheric activity indicators and used spectral type as a secondary consideration. In the NUV, we used HST/STIS E230M spectra of HD 203244, a relatively active (Ca II log(R ′ HK ) = -4.4 (ref. 52)), nearby (that is, unreddened, d = 20.8 pc; Gaia DR2), G5 V star (T eff = 5,480 K (ref. 53)) from the STARCat archive 54 . Although HD 203244 is a suitable proxy at photospheric wavelengths, WASP-39 is a relatively old (about 7 Gyr) star with low chromospheric activity (log(R ′ HK ) = -4.97 ± 0.06) and a long rotation period (P rot = 42.1 ± 2.6 days; ref. 51), suggesting substantially lower high-energy flux than HD 203244. Therefore, we elected to use a lower-activity G-type star, the Sun, at wavelengths shorter than 2,300 Å. The Sun has high-quality archival data available across the UV and X-rays and similar chromospheric activity to WASP-39 (the average solar Ca II log(R ′ HK ) value is -4.902 ± 0.063 and ranges from approximately -4.8 to -5.0 from solar maximum to solar minimum 55,56 ). With the components in hand, we first corrected the observed STIS spectra of WASP-39 for interstellar dust extinction of E(B - V) = 0.079 (ref. 57) using a standard R V = 3.1 interstellar reddening curve 58 and then interpolated all spectra onto a 0.5-Å-pixel -1 grid. The NUV spectrum of HD 203244 was scaled to the reddening-corrected WASP-39 observations in the overlap region between 2,900 and 3,000 Å and the XUV + FUV spectrum of the quiet Sun 59 was scaled to the blue end of the combined SED. The flux scaling between two spectral components is defined as ((F ref - α × F proxy )/σ ref ) 2 in the overlap region, in which 'proxy' is the spectrum being scaled, 'ref' is the spectrum to which we are scaling and α is the scale factor applied to the proxy spectrum. α is varied until the above quantity is minimized (α = 2.04 × 10 -16 and 7.58 × 10 -3 for the FUV and NUV components, respectively). The final combined spectrum was convolved with a 2-Å full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel and wavelengths longer than 7,000 Å were removed to avoid the near-infrared fringing in the STIS G750L mode.

        <p>We compared our estimated SED for WASP-39 against archival GALEX observations from Shkolnik 60 , who found the NUV (1,771-2,831 Å) flux density to be 168.89 μJy, or an average NUV spectral flux of F λ = 9.8 × 10 -16 erg cm -2 s -1 Å -1 at 2,271 Å. Correcting this value by the average extinction correction in the GALEX NUV bandpass, a factor of 1.79, and comparing it with the average flux of our estimated SED over the same spectral range (1.66 × 10 -15 erg cm -2 s -1 Å -1 ), we find the agreement between the GALEX measurement of WASP-39 and our stellar proxy to be better than 6%.We compared our estimated SED for WASP-39 against archival GALEX observations from Shkolnik 60 , who found the NUV (1,771-2,831 Å) flux density to be 168.89 μJy, or an average NUV spectral flux of F λ = 9.8 × 10 -16 erg cm -2 s -1 Å -1 at 2,271 Å.

        <p>The KINETICS 1D thermo-photochemical transport model 42 uses the Caltech/JPL KINETICS model 82,83 to solve the coupled 1D continuity equations describing the chemical production, loss and vertical transport of atmospheric constituents of WASP-39 b. The model contains 150 neutral C-bearing, H-bearing, O-bearing, N-bearing, S-bearing and Cl-bearing species that interact with each other through a total of 2,350 reactions (that is, 1,175 forward-reverse reaction pairs). These reactions have all been fully reversed through the thermodynamic principle of microscopic reversibility 84 , such that the model would reproduce thermochemical equilibrium in the absence of transport and external energy sources, given sufficient integration time. The chemical reaction list involving C-bearing, H-bearing, O-bearing and N-bearing species is taken directly from ref. 22. Included for the first time here are 41 sulfur and chlorine species: S, S(1D), S 2 , S 3 , S 4 , S 8 , SH, H 2 S, HS 2 , H 2 S 2 , CS, CS 2 , HCS, H 2 CS, CH 3 S, CH 3 SH, SO, SO 2 , SO 3 , S 2 O, HOSO 2 , H 2 SO 4 (gas and condensed), OCS, NS, NCS, HNCS, Cl, Cl 2 , HCl, ClO, HOCl, ClCO, ClCO 3 , ClS, ClS 2 , Cl 2 S, ClSH, OSCl, ClSO 2 and SO 2 Cl 2 . The thermodynamic data of several chlorine-bearing and sulfur-bearing species are not available in the previous literature and we performed ab initio calculations for these species. We first carried out electronic-structure calculations at the CBS-QB3 level of theory using Gaussian 09 (ref. 85) to determine geometric conformations, energies and vibrational frequencies of the target molecules. Then the thermodynamic properties of these molecules were calculated by

        <p>We examine the sensitivity of our chemical outcomes to essential atmospheric properties using VULCAN. For models with various metallicity and C/O ratios, we explore the sensitivity to temperature and vertical mixing by systematically varying the temperaturepressure and eddy diffusion coefficient profiles. Specifically, the temperature throughout the atmosphere is shifted by 50 K and the eddy diffusion coefficients are multiplied/divided by 10. These variations span a range comparable with the temperature differences among radiative transfer models 47 and the uncertainties in parameterizing vertical mixing with eddy diffusion coefficients 118,119 . On our choice of internal heat, we have further conducted tests with different internal temperatures and found that the compositions above 1 bar are not sensitive to internal temperature, because the quench levels of the main species are at higher levels given the adopted eddy diffusion coefficient. We have also verified that the temperature above the top boundary of the GCM (about 5 × 10 -5 bar; Extended Data Fig. 2) does not affect the composition below.We examine the sensitivity of our chemical outcomes to essential atmospheric properties using VULCAN.

        <p>Sensitivity to C/O is summarized in Extended Data Fig. 5, in which the nominal model has a C/O ratio of 0.55, as in the main text. The averaged abundance of both SO 2 and H 2 O in the pressure region relevant for transmission spectrum observations show similar dependencies on C/O, decreasing by a few factors as the C/O increased from sub-solar (0.25) to super-solar (0.75) values. The averaged abundance of SO 2 is not very sensitive to temperature and vertical mixing either, except for C/O = 0.75, for which the SO 2 concentration is at roughly the ppm level, similar to what is found in Fig. 4.Sensitivity to C/O is summarized in Extended Data Fig. 5, in which the nominal model has a C/O ratio of 0.55, as in the main text.

        <p>Finally, we performed sensitivity tests to the UV irradiation-the ultimate energy source of photochemistry. We first tested the sensitivity to the assumed stellar spectra by performing the same models with the solar spectrum (close to WASP-39) and found negligible differences in the photochemical results. Because the UV spectrum shortward of 295 nm is constructed from stellar proxies rather than directly measured, we then focused on varying the stellar flux in the FUV (1-230 nm) and NUV (230-295 nm) separately. Extended Data Fig. 8 shows that the resulting sulfur species abundances are almost identical when the UV flux is reduced by a factor of 10, broadly consistent with what Zahnle et al. 5 suggested that the photochemical destruction of H 2 S only becomes photon-limited when the stellar UV flux is reduced by about two orders of magnitude (for a directly imaged gas giant). On the other hand, although SO and SO 2 are not sensitive to increased NUV, they are substantially depleted with increased FUV. This is because the photodissociation of SO and SO 2 mainly operates in the FUV and the enhanced FUV can destroy SO and SO 2 , even with the same amount of available OH radicals.Finally, we performed sensitivity tests to the UV irradiation-the ultimate energy source of photochemistry.

        <p>Minor species commonly have VMR varying with altitude in the observable region of the atmosphere, especially those produced or destroyed by photochemistry. Extended Data Fig. 9 demonstrates that assuming a vertically constant VMR of SO 2 can lead to underestimating its abundances by about an order of magnitude. This is verified by comparing the column-integrated number density from the pressure level relevant for transmission spectroscopy. For example, the terminator-averaged column-integrated number density of SO 2 above 10 mbar by VULCAN is about 1.4 × 10 19 molecules cm -2 , which is equal to a vertically uniform SO 2 with a concentration around 4 ppm. Hence modelling frameworks that assume vertically uniform composition should be treated with caution and would benefit from comparisons with photochemical models, especially for photochemically active species that can exhibit large vertical gradients.Minor species commonly have VMR varying with altitude in the observable region of the atmosphere, especially those produced or destroyed by photochemistry.

The room-temperature UV cross-sections are taken from the Leiden Observatory database 120 Alternative SO 2 production pathways S 2 formation can compete with SO 2 production, as we will explore in detail in the next section. On WASP-39b, reactions involving S 2 are found to be important in oxidizing S at high pressures at which less OH is available. S and SH would first react to form S 2 by SH + S → H + S 2 before getting oxidized through S 2 + OH → SO + SH. The scheme is similar to that in equation (1) except SH and S 2 play the role of the catalyst to oxidize S into SO, whereas SO can also self-react to form SO 2 in this regime (references of important reactions are listed in Extended Data Table 1).The opacities of sulfur species illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 7 are compiled from UV cross-sections and infrared line lists.

        <p>After S is liberated from H 2 S, sulfur can follow either the oxidization or the chain polymerization paths, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The competing of the two paths is essentially controlled by the abundance of the oxidizing radical OH relative to atomic H. We can estimate the OH to H ratio by assuming that OH is in quasi-equilibrium with H 2 O, that is, We further perform photochemical calculations using 
            <rs type="software">VULCAN</rs> with a grid of temperature profiles across planetary equilibrium temperatures 600-2,000 K, adopted from the 1D radiative-convective equilibrium models applied in ref. 39, in which an internal temperature of 100 K with perfect heat redistribution and gravity g = 1,000 cm s -2 are assumed. Apart from the thermal profiles, we keep the rest of the planetary parameters the same as the WASP-39b model in this work, including stellar UV irradiation. Extended Data Fig. 10b reveals the observation of sulfur photochemistry on other irradiated exoplanets, summarizing the averaged abundances of the key sulfur molecules produced by photochemistry as a function of equilibrium temperature. For 10× solar metallicity, the sweet-spot temperature for producing observable SO 2 is 1,000 K ≲ T eq ≲ 1,600 K. For T eq ≲ 1,000 K, SO 2 production below the 0.01-mbar level ceased and S x (sulfur allotropes; mainly S 2 and S 8 here) is more favoured. For T eq ≳ 1,600 K, SH becomes the predominant sulfur-bearing molecular (apart from atomic S) around mbar levels. Although observing SH is challenging in the infrared, it can potentially be identified in the near-UV (300-400 nm) 125 . b, The average VMR between 10 and 0.01 mbar as a function of planetary equilibrium temperature with temperature profiles adopted from ref. 39 (see text for setup). The grey line marks approximately the required SO 2 concentration to be detectable with WASP-39b parameters. S x denotes the allotropes S 2 and S 8 and x denotes the oxidized species SO and SO 2 .
