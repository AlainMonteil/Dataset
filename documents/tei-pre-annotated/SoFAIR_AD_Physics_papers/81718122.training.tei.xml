        <p>Background: Quantification of myocardial blood flow requires knowledge of the amount of contrast agent in the myocardial tissue and the arterial input function (AIF) driving the delivery of this contrast agent. Accurate quantification is challenged by the lack of linearity between the measured signal and contrast agent concentration. This work characterizes sources of non-linearity and presents a systematic approach to accurate measurements of contrast agent concentration in both blood and myocardium.Background: Quantification of myocardial blood flow requires knowledge of the amount of contrast agent in the myocardial tissue and the arterial input function (AIF) driving the delivery of this contrast agent.

        <p>Methods: A dual sequence approach with separate pulse sequences for AIF and myocardial tissue allowed separate optimization of parameters for blood and myocardium. A systems approach to the overall design was taken to achieve linearity between signal and contrast agent concentration. Conversion of signal intensity values to contrast agent concentration was achieved through a combination of surface coil sensitivity correction, Bloch simulation based look-up table correction, and in the case of the AIF measurement, correction of T2* losses. Validation of signal correction was performed in phantoms, and values for peak AIF concentration and myocardial flow are provided for 29 normal subjects for rest and adenosine stress.Methods: A dual sequence approach with separate pulse sequences for AIF and myocardial tissue allowed separate optimization of parameters for blood and myocardium.

        <p>Results: For phantoms, the measured fits were within 5% for both AIF and myocardium. In healthy volunteers the peak [Gd] was 3.5 ± 1.2 for stress and 4.4 ± 1.2 mmol/L for rest. The T2* in the left ventricle blood pool at peak AIF was approximately 10 ms. The peak-to-valley ratio was 5.6 for the raw signal intensities without correction, and was 8.3 for the look-up-table (LUT) corrected AIF which represents approximately 48% correction. Without T2* correction the myocardial blood flow estimates are overestimated by approximately 10%. The signal-to-noise ratio of the myocardial signal at peak enhancement (1.5 T) was 17.7 ± 6.6 at stress and the peak [Gd] was 0.49 ± 0.15 mmol/L. The estimated perfusion flow was 3.9 ± 0.38 and 1.03 ± 0.19 ml/min/g using the BTEX model and 3.4 ± 0.39 and 0.95 ± 0.16 using a Fermi model, for stress and rest, respectively.Results: For phantoms, the measured fits were within 5% for both AIF and myocardium.

        <p>Myocardial perfusion can be evaluated with dynamic cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) during the passage of a bolus of contrast agent. Most commonly, perfusion CMR is evaluated qualitatively, but objective quantitative evaluation would be more desirable. The potential benefits of quantification are: objective assessment, simpler and faster analysis, and the ability to detect disease with a global reduction in flow such as multi-vessel obstructive disease or microvascular disease. Quantification of myocardial blood flow using CMR was first proposed over 20 years ago [1,2], yet qualitative interpretation of images remains the primary means available to clinicians. The desired output of a quantitative perfusion study is a map of myocardial blood flow in units of ml/g/min.Myocardial perfusion can be evaluated with dynamic cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) during the passage of a bolus of contrast agent.

        <p>Quantification requires knowledge of the amount of contrast agent in the myocardial tissue and the arterial input function (AIF) driving the delivery of this contrast agent. Accurate quantification is challenged by the lack of linearity between the measured signal and contrast agent concentration.

Current, commercially available, myocardial perfusion sequences have not been optimized to yield accurate concentration curves and the observed signal intensity curves are not linearly related to the concentrations of contrast agent, i.e., there is a non-linear relationship between signal intensity and contrast agent concentration, which leads to quantification biases.Quantification requires knowledge of the amount of contrast agent in the myocardial tissue and the arterial input function (AIF) driving the delivery of this contrast agent.

        <p>The main sources of non-linearity and bias are: spatial signal variations caused by the sensitivity profiles of the surface coils, imperfect saturation of magnetization during contrast bolus passage, T2* decay (and signal loss) caused by high contrast agent concentrations in the blood pool, and the non-linear signal response inherent due to saturation recovery that depends on the parameters of the imaging protocol. It has been proposed that some of the non-linearity of the AIF response curve can be mitigated by imaging the AIF during a separate injection of a bolus with lower concentration (the dual bolus approach) [3], but this approach has some practical drawbacks as it requires multiple injections and acquisitions. Moreover, there are other potential bias sources with his approach, since changes in breathing, etc. between the two measurements may introduce new sources of variation. Consequently, it is desirable to acquire the AIF curve simultaneously with the tissue response curve.The main sources of non-linearity and bias are: spatial signal variations caused by the sensitivity profiles of the surface coils, imperfect saturation of magnetization during contrast bolus passage, T2* decay (and signal loss) caused by high contrast agent concentrations in the blood pool, and the non-linear signal response inherent due to saturation recovery that depends on the parameters of the imaging protocol.

        <p>A saturation recovery (SR) sequence was used for myocardial perfusion imaging during the passage of a bolus of gadolinium based contrast agent as depicted in Fig. 1 which is illustrated for a subject with single vessel disease. Baseline images were acquired prior to bolus administration and continued through the first pass. Typically, images were acquired for 60-90 heartbeats depending on the cardiac output. Proton density (PD) weighted images were acquired at the start.A saturation recovery (SR) sequence was used for myocardial perfusion imaging during the passage of a bolus of gadolinium based contrast agent as depicted in Fig. 1 which is illustrated for a subject with single vessel disease.

        <p>A multi-slice 2D SR dual imaging sequence is diagrammed in Fig. 2. Low resolution blood pool images used for estimating the AIF were acquired every heartbeat immediately following the R-wave trigger. Higher resolution images were acquired following the AIF and may be sampled every RR or every second RR if greater spatial coverage is desired. The sequence uses a pulse sequel for saturation [6] for each image. The image readout is single shot using parallel imaging acceleration to reduce the imaging duration. The AIF uses a FLASH readout, whereas the higher resolution myocardial images may be either b-SSFP or FLASH, selected by the user. The measurement begins with the acquisition of PD weighted images used for surface coil intensity correction and normalization of signal values. The PD images are acquired using a low flip angle FLASH readout without SR preparation to minimize artifacts of b-SSFP at low flip angle [7]. An optional chemical shift fat suppression may be used to mitigate artifacts due to the presence of fat around the heart. Fat suppression is used in this study.A multi-slice 2D SR dual imaging sequence is diagrammed in Fig. 2.

        <p>Saturation efficiency is very important in quantification since the conversion of signal intensities to gadolinium concentration depends on a known signal recovery and independence of the signal from slice to slice that is achieved by resetting the magnetization to zero for each image. With high saturation efficiency it is also possible to prescribe a mixture of long and short axis views without cross-talk between slices due to the readout. The SR preparation using the 6-pulse design [6] was chosen since it had excellent saturation efficiency over a wide range of off-resonance and effective transmitter flip angle (FA) which may vary across the heart. A BIR-4 design [6] achieved excellent saturation performance with a shorter duration but was found empirically to have specific absorption rate (SAR) limitation at higher heart rates particularly at higher field strength such as 3 Tesla. The 6-pulse design consisted of non-selective RF pulses with tailored flip angles separated by gradient spoilers. The voltage of the RF pulses was maximized in order to reduce the pulse duration, and the duration was modulated to achieve the specified FAs. The pulse amplitude corresponded to approx. 27 μT at 1.5 T and was reduced to approx. 11 μT at 3 T to reduce the SAR. To ensure that the sequence would not terminate at run time due to average SAR monitor responding to actual changes in the heart rate, a post-scan acquisition delay of up to 100 s was allowed to increase the averaging interval. The performance of the SR preparation in both blood and myocardium was characterized by simulation for different gadolinium contrast concentrations. At 1.5 T, the SR preparation was 26 ms including 1 ms preand 4 ms post-spoiler gradients.Saturation efficiency is very important in quantification since the conversion of signal intensities to gadolinium concentration depends on a known signal recovery and independence of the signal from slice to slice that is achieved by resetting the magnetization to zero for each image.

        <p>Signal intensities were converted to gadolinium concentration, [Gd], in order to linearize the relationship of signal and [Gd] and to be able to have a common Fig. 2 Overview diagram of "dual"-sequence for multi-slice 2D saturation recovery. The low resolution AIF image is acquired at the R-wave triggered followed by multiple full resolution myocardial perfusion images. Each image has a saturation recovery RF preparation consisting of a sequence of RF pulses and gradient spoilers followed by single shot image readout. The myocardial perfusion images have an optional chemical shift fat saturation. The AIF uses a FLASH readout, whereas the full resolution myocardial images may be either b-SSFP or FLASH. The AIF is acquired for a single slice every RR interval, whereas the myocardial perfusion images may be sampled every RR or every other RR interval to increase the overall number of slices. TD and TS are the trigger delay and saturation time, respectively scaling between the AIF and myocardial signals which are acquired using different protocols. Cernicanu, et al. [8] proposed a method for conversion of normalized signal intensities using an analytic expression for readout using a gradient recalled echo (GRE) protocol. This formulation was extended to the dual sequence using a numerical Bloch calculation [9] which permitted application to b-SSFP readout of myocardium and FLASH readout of the AIF.Signal intensities were converted to gadolinium concentration, [Gd], in order to linearize the relationship of signal and [Gd] and to be able to have a common Fig. 2 Overview diagram of "dual"-sequence for multi-slice 2D saturation recovery.

        <p>Proton density weighted images were acquired at the start of the scan for both AIF and myocardial image slices using a FLASH sequence without the SR preparation. The timing of the PD images matched the SR prepared images such that the images were acquired at the same cardiac phase. The images were used to correct the surface coil variation and were used as the signal normalization for look-up table (LUT) linearization. LUT calculations assumed that the native tissue T1 for the PD is prior to contrast (T1 0 ), therefore it was important that the PD signal intensity was sufficiently independent of the actual T1 since acquisition of rest perfusion scans typically follow the stress scans after only several minutes at which time the actual T1 is not fully recovered, i.e., the actual gadolinium concentration [Gd] &gt; 0. The dependence of PD signal amplitude versus [Gd] for myocardium and blood tissue was calculated through simulation. This led to a selection of readout FA = 5°. Note that coil sensitivity maps, used both in parallel imaging reconstruction and adaptive coil combination, consisted of the average of all time frames including PD weighted images, therefore the number of PD frames acquired was set equal to the parallel imaging acceleration factor of the myocardial imaging (in this case, R = 3). The first PD image was used for normalization to avoid signal loss caused by previous heartbeat images.Proton density weighted images were acquired at the start of the scan for both AIF and myocardial image slices using a FLASH sequence without the SR preparation.

        <p>The AIF was acquired immediately after the R-wave trigger and was selected as the most basal of the slices prescribed in the first slice group. The AIF used the 6-pulse sequel for saturation preparation as described above followed by a dual echo low FA FLASH readout. The protocol parameters are listed in Table 1. A short readout (64 point) with wide bandwidth (3900 Hz/pixel) and short duration RF pulses (250 μs, time-bandwidth product = 2.0) were used to achieve low T2* losses (TE 1 = 0.76 ms). T2* dephasing loss has been a known concern in estimating AIF and conversion to [Gd] and approaches to this problem have focused either on minimizing the loss by choosing adequately short echo time (TE) [10] or on correcting for T2* loss based on modeling the relationship between T1 and T2* [11,12]. In this work, the dual sequence approach was modified to incorporate a 2 echo acquisition for measurement of T2* during the bolus passage. A dual echo acquisition with monopolar readout was used to acquire a second echo (TE 2 = 1.76 μs) which was used for direct estimation of T2* during the first pass. The ratio of the 2 echo signals S1/S2 = S0 exp((T2-T1)/T2*) was used to calculate the signal amplitude S0 without T2* loss. This was performed for a blood pool region signal after left ventricle (LV) blood pool segmentation.The AIF was acquired immediately after the R-wave trigger and was selected as the most basal of the slices prescribed in the first slice group.

        <p>Blood pool segmentation was performed on the motion corrected low resolution AIF image series to extract arterial input function intensities signals for both echoes. First, the AIF PD image is used to detect the noise background. Since the noise standard deviation (SD) is unity after the SNR unit reconstruction [13], a simple threshold of 3 SD's was used. For all foreground pixels as determined by the noise mask, the time intensity curves are analyzed using a scale-space based detector [14]. Pixels with top 10% upslope and AUC values are picked as the candidates for LV blood pool mask. A connected component analysis is then used to separate RV and LV pixels based on the time to peak enhancement. The final LV blood pool mask is calculated using a further erosion step which seeks to drop border pixels which are a mixture of blood and myocardial tissue.Blood pool segmentation was performed on the motion corrected low resolution AIF image series to extract arterial input function intensities signals for both echoes.

        <p>In order to shorten the imaging duration, 2-fold acceleration was achieved using parallel imaging with temporal generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions (TGRAPPA) [15]. In order to minimize the non-linear response due to saturation at high gadolinium concentration a short saturation delay (TS) is desired, where TS is defined as the time from saturation to the kspace center. There is a tradeoff between the image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is reduced at low TS, and linearity, which is improved at low TS. Early designs used a centric readout ordering to minimize TS [16,17]. In centric ordering the saturation delay is nearly the trigger delay (TD), which may be as short as the gradient spoiler following the RF saturation (4 ms). The difficulty with centric order is 2-fold: 1) the SNR of the baseline images is too low, and 2) the k-space weighting during the saturation recovery leads to a strong high pass spatial filter that enhances the edge of the blood pool. The high pass spatial filter is problematic for accurate calculation of gadolinium concentration since the effective TS is a function of spatial frequency and will vary depending on how the blood region is segmented. For this reason, a linear acquisition ordering was chosen. Although not perfectly linear at high [Gd], it was sufficiently linear to enable LUT correction. Using a low resolution image and parallel imaging factor 2, the k-space center was typically at N = 9 pulses. The sensitivity of the blood signal to in-flowing spins was estimated by comparing the signal after 9-pulses compared to the signal assuming all spins were new.In order to shorten the imaging duration, 2-fold acceleration was achieved using parallel imaging with temporal generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions (TGRAPPA) [15].

        <p>Conversion of the signal to gadolinium concentration, [Gd], was performed by LUT based on Bloch signal calculations. In this way, the LUT corrected signal was directly proportional to [Gd] and importantly was in the same units as the LUT corrected myocardial signal which was acquired with a different imaging protocol. The LUT was applied to the normalized signal SR/PD where SR and PD were the saturation recovery and proton density weighted images, respectively. It was important that the normalized signal SR/PD was not strongly dependent on the actual transmitted FA.

        <p>The readout of the PD image for the AIF may influence the initial magnetization of the 1 st myocardial image which is at the same slice location since there is no SR preparation for the PD image.

        <p>The 2D multi-slice myocardial imaging sequence used the same 6-pulse sequel saturation preparation, followed by a trigger delay (TD) and single shot readout. The single shot readout was either FLASH or b-SSFP. Protocol parameters at 1.5 T are listed in Table 2 and may vary slightly at 3 T. The readout used parallel imaging with 3-fold acceleration using TGRAPPA, and there were 3 PD frames without SR using a FLASH readout at the start of the sequence. An optional chemical shift fat saturation may be used without any penalty in the timing since the TD accommodated the fat saturation RF pulse. Although the gadolinium concentration in the myocardium is typically &lt; 1 mmol/L, the signal response is still somewhat non-linear and therefore, the normalized signal SR/PD was corrected by a LUT which converts the myocardial signal to gadolinium concentration units, [Gd]. The sensitivity of the LUT correction to the actual transmitted FA was calculated by simulation.

        <p>The duration of actual signal shot image was 70 ms for SSFP protocol using factor 3 acceleration and Partial Fourier factor of ¾ with the latter part of k-space omitted. There is a trade-off between contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), spatial coverage (number of slices per RR), and linearity as illustrated in Fig. 3. The protocol was designed to work at a heart rate of 120 bpm which is commonly seen for patients under adenosine stress. It was possible to acquire the AIF plus 3 slices at 120 bpm with the proposed protocol using TS = 95 ms, or AIF plus 2 slices using TI = 160 with increased CNR. It is also possible to prescribe 2x the number of slices by acquiring slices at 2RR intervals. Although there is a gain CNR with longer TS, there is also a loss in performance when using 2RR sampling since there will be fewer samples of the myocardial signal during the first pass measurement.The duration of actual signal shot image was 70 ms for SSFP protocol using factor 3 acceleration and Partial Fourier factor of ¾ with the latter part of k-space omitted.

        <p>Image reconstruction and processing steps are diagrammed in Fig. 4. Parallel imaging was used to accelerate the acquisition of both AIF and myocardial images. This helped to minimize cardiac motion contribution to dark rim artifacts (DRA) [18,19] that appear as false perfusion defects, and to achieve adequate spatial coverage. Parallel imaging used TGRAPPA reconstruction with coil maps estimated by integrating the complete dataset [15]. All acquisitions were with normal free breathing and parallel imaging auto-calibration was performed on the complete dataset resulted in images free of aliasing artifacts. Individual coil images are adaptively combined to minimize noise bias prior to magnitude detection. Raw filtering was used to reduce edge ringing [20] (Gibb's ringing) and to mitigate contamination of the measurements due to fat. In the low resolution AIF, a true Hanning window (i.e., without modification as in Tukey windows) was used to mitigate the influence of fat on the blood pool. For the low resolution AIF images the chest wall fat may be only 10-20 pixels from the LV blood pool. The Hanning window point spread function is &lt;0.02% at a distance greater than 10 pixels whereas an un-windowed reconstruction would be &lt;3.5% at this distance. The loss in resolution at full width half maximum is approx. 60%. In the higher resolution myocardial images, a truncated Gaussian filter was used, truncated to a width of 1.5 standard deviations. The first sidelobe was reduced to 36% compared to unweighted with a mainlobe broadening of 16% at full width half maximum.Image reconstruction and processing steps are diagrammed in Fig. 4.

        <p>The dual sequence approach was chosen for automated, in-line perfusion mapping since it is readily integrated into a clinical workflow. Unlike the dual bolus method, simultaneous measurement of the AIF and myocardial signals avoids physiological variation between bolus injections such as those due to differences in respiration. Another benefit of the dual sequence is that it decouples the measurement of the AIF from the myocardial imaging protocol so that they may be independently optimized. The inherent non-linear response of SR on the AIF was minimized by design of the protocol and post-processing. Earlier dual sequence AIF protocols used centric ordered acquisition to minimize the TS for improved linearity, but this leads to a high pass spatial filtering of the blood pool signal which becomes dependent on gadolinium concentration [10] and creates a dependence on the AIF and how the blood pool is segmented, i.e., the edges of the blood pool will have a longer effective saturation delay. Use of a linear ordering leads to a more homogeneous blood pool image. The saturation delay was minimized by use of parallel imaging acceleration to reduce the number of phase encodes lines actually acquired. The AIF signal with linear phase encoder order was slightly more non-linear than centric but could be corrected by a look-up-table approach based on Bloch signal calculations of the normalized signal (SR/PD). In this way, the blood pool signal could be automatically segmented and the AIF could be reliably estimated. Parallel imaging was used to accelerate the acquisition of myocardial perfusion images in order to reduce the single shot duration and thereby mitigate dark rim artifacts to some extent.

        <p>The conversion to gadolinium concentration units facilitated the use of the dual sequence which used a FLASH readout for the AIF and could support either FLASH or SSFP for myocardial perfusion imaging. The relaxivities (r1 and r2) were measured in Gd doped saline phantoms. Although the estimated concentration is dependent on the accuracy of these values, which may be slightly different in blood plasma, the quantified myocardial blood flow has been found through simulation to be quite insensitive since they affect the scale of both blood and myocardium. In-vivo values of blood T2* were significantly lower than for saline phantoms at a given [Gd] as previously reported [26]. The average blood T2* at 1.5 T was approximately 10 ms at 4 mmol/L peak [Gd], whereas the T2* was approximately 25 ms in saline at the same concentration. The T2* decreases with field strength [26] and values as low as 4 ms are likely to be encountered at 3 T using a dose of 0.05 mmol/kg leading to higher signal losses and greater importance for T2* correction. The conversion to [Gd] in the presence of error in FA due to unknown B1 was analyzed through simulation to cause small errors in [Gd] which in turn will result in an error in estimated flow of &lt; 15% for ±20% variation in B1.The conversion to gadolinium concentration units facilitated the use of the dual sequence which used a FLASH readout for the AIF and could support either FLASH or SSFP for myocardial perfusion imaging. The relaxivities (r1 and r2) were measured in Gd doped saline phantoms.

        <p>The in-line automated perfusion mapping software has the capability of calculating perfusion estimates based on several different widely used models with differing complexity including the Fermi model [2] and distributed BTEX model [23]. The distributed BTEX model explicitly estimates the permeability surface area (PS) product which is used to calculate an extraction fraction to account for the flow dependent leakage of Gd from the vascular space into the interstitium. The BTEX model has been used in 13 N-Ammonia PET and validated against microspheres [27]. There is growing interest in distributed tissue models for perfusion [28][29][30]. A more comprehensive comparison of models will be the subject of a detailed study. Despite significant differences in models, the mean values for perfusion estimates compare reasonably well with other reported values in normal subjects. In a study by Broadbent, et al. [28], perfusion was estimated using both Fermi and a distributed parameter (DP) model. Values for stress and rest perfusion estimates and myocardial flow reserve in that study were 3.8/1.5/2.7 for Fermi and 3.5/1.5/2.5 for DP, as compared to 3.4/0.95/3.6 for Fermi and 3.9/1.03/3.8 for BTEX in the present study. In a study of 10 normal subjects, Hsu, et al. [31] reported values of 3.39/1.02/3.3 using a Fermi tissue model.The in-line automated perfusion mapping software has the capability of calculating perfusion estimates based on several different widely used models with differing complexity including the Fermi model [2] and distributed BTEX model [23].

        <p>The 6-pulse saturation preparation achieved &gt; 99% saturation over a wide range of off-resonance, effective transmitter FA, and gadolinium concentration. Excellent saturation mitigates slice to slice cross-talk and allows the user to prescribe a mixture of short and long axis slices. There is possibility of slight cross talk between intersecting slices for the initial non-saturated PD frames, but this is quite small due to the low FA of PD weighted acquisition protocol. The 6-pulse is designed conservatively, and has recently been reduced to a 5pulse design to reduce the overall duration and SAR. The newly design preparation has recently been evaluated and perform with &gt;99% saturation over a design range of 50-110% nominal B1+. This newly designed SR preparation is 14.7 ms including crushers which translated to a total AIF duration of 57 ms. Using this 5-pulse design allows for slight increase of the saturation delay from 95 to 105 ms, thereby increasing the SNR while maintaining 3-slices up to 120 bpm.The 6-pulse saturation preparation achieved &gt; 99% saturation over a wide range of off-resonance, effective transmitter FA, and gadolinium concentration.

        <p>A dual sequence for myocardial perfusion CMR and arterial input function measurement has been optimized for quantification of myocardial blood flow. A validation in phantoms was performed to confirm that the signal conversion to gadolinium concentration was linear. The proposed sequence was integrated with a fully automatic in-line solution for pixel-wise mapping of myocardial blood flow and evaluated in adenosine stress and rest studies on N = 29 normal healthy subjects. Reliable perfusion mapping was demonstrated and produced estimates with low variability.A dual sequence for myocardial perfusion CMR and arterial input function measurement has been optimized for quantification of myocardial blood flow.
