        <p>Skyrmions, topologically protected vortex-like nanometric spin textures in magnets, have been attracting increasing attention for emergent electromagnetic responses and possible technological applications for spintronics. In particular, metallic magnets with chiral and cubic/tetragonal crystal structure may have high potential to host skyrmions that can be driven by low electrical current excitation. However, experimental observations of skyrmions have been limited to below room temperature for the metallic chiral magnets, specifically for the MnSi-type B20 compounds. Towards technological applications, transcending this limitation is crucial. Here we demonstrate the formation of skyrmions with unique spin helicity both at and above room temperature in a family of cubic chiral magnets: b-Mn-type Co-Zn-Mn alloys with a different chiral space group from that of B20 compounds. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, magnetization and small-angle neutron scattering measurements unambiguously reveal formation of a skyrmion crystal under application of a magnetic field in both thin-plate and bulk forms.Skyrmions, topologically protected vortex-like nanometric spin textures in magnets, have been attracting increasing attention for emergent electromagnetic responses and possible technological applications for spintronics.

        <p>kyrmions with topologically non-trivial spin textures [1][2][3] have been observed or proposed to exist in various magnets due to different mechanisms, such as magnetic dipolar interaction 4,5 , antisymmetric spin exchange or so-called Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction [6][7][8][9] , frustrated exchange interaction 10 and four-spin exchange interactions 11 . In metallic compounds, skyrmions induce fictitious magnetic fluxes acting on the conduction electrons, thereby inducing the so-called topological Hall effect [12][13][14] . Conversely, an applied electric current can induce a flow of skyrmions, with a threshold current density (B10 6 A m À 2 ), which is 5-6 orders of magnitude smaller than that necessary for driving magnetic domain walls in ferromagnets [15][16][17] . This property can be understood to arise from the theoretically predicted topological features of skyrmions [18][19][20] . On the other hand, in the insulating chiral magnet Cu 2 OSeO 3 , each skyrmion carries an electric dipole or quadrupole, which makes it possible to manipulate skyrmions by means of electric fields [21][22][23][24][25] . These features are promising for technological applications, including spintronic devices and ultra-low powerconsumption, high-density magnetic memory.kyrmions with topologically non-trivial spin textures [1][2][3] have been observed or proposed to exist in various magnets due to different mechanisms, such as magnetic dipolar interaction 4,5 , antisymmetric spin exchange or so-called Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction [6][7][8][9] , frustrated exchange interaction 10 and four-spin exchange interactions 11 .

        <p>Among the various skyrmions, those induced by the DM interaction are particularly interesting due to their relatively small size (o150 nm) and fixed unique helicity (spin swirling direction). Theoretically, a number of helical magnets mediated by the DM interaction and with non-centrosymmetric crystallographic symmetries are predicted to be good candidates for hosting stable skyrmions 2,26 . In spite of such anticipation, experimental observations of skyrmions in non-centrosymmetric bulk magnets have been limited to only B20-type alloys 3,6,7,27 and Cu 2 OSeO 3 (refs 21,22), all of which have the same cubic chiral space group P2 1 3. Their helical transition temperatures (T c ), and hence the maximum formation temperatures of skyrmions, are below room temperature (at most B278 K in FeGe 27 ). The sub-ambient T c is a bottleneck for the integration of skyrmions in non-centrosymmetric magnets into practical spintronics devices. Therefore, new systems with higher T c are required.Among the various skyrmions, those induced by the DM interaction are particularly interesting due to their relatively small size (o150 nm) and fixed unique helicity (spin swirling direction).

        <p>Temperature dependence of magnetization. All prepared samples were confirmed to be of b-Mn-type, whose structure is depicted in Fig. 1a,b. Figure 1c shows the temperature dependence of the magnetization for selected samples measured in field-cooling runs. T c for Co 10 Zn 10 is B462 K, which is higher than the reported value (B420 K, ref. 29), possibly due to a slight difference in the composition. On substituting Co and Zn with Mn, T c systematically decreases and Co 6 Mn 6 Zn 8 no longer shows ferromagnetic-like behaviour. Magnetization measured at this magnetic field (H ¼ 20 Oe) is observed to decrease at low temperatures in many samples, but this tendency is mostly suppressed for H ¼ 1 kOe. Whether there is a second transition or not at low temperature remain a topic for future investigations.Temperature dependence of magnetization.

        <p>Demonstration of the helimagnetic nature. To elucidate the possible helical nature of the magnetic ordering in these compounds, we have performed small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements. Figure 1d,e show typical SANS images obtained from polycrystalline pieces of Co 10 Zn 10 and Co 7 Zn 7 Mn 6 under respective magnetic fields of 300 and 250 Oe applied perpendicular to the incident neutron beam direction. In the vicinity of the Q ¼ 0 position, pairs of magnetic reflections are clearly observed nearly along the magnetic field direction, demonstrating the helical (or more precisely, conical due to the presence of the magnetic field) nature of the spin ordering in this system. The slight tilting of the peaks relative to the horizontal field direction demonstrates presence of weak magnetic anisotropy. As shown in Fig. 1f, the helical periodicity (l) determined from the positions of the magnetic reflections shows a systematic change from lB185 nm for Co 10 Zn 10 to lB115 nm for Co 7 Zn 7 Mn 6 . This can be consistently understood as a decrease in the dominant ferromagnetic exchange interaction (J), which is reflected in the decrease of T c . As a result, the periodicity which is given by J/D (where D is the DM interaction) also decreases. It is to be noted that all the compounds of Co 10-x/2 Zn 10-x/2 Mn x are good metals showing resistivity of 140-280 mOcm at room temperature.

        <p>Formation of the chiral skyrmion above room temperature. Since the system is found to be a cubic DM helimagnet, the formation of skyrmions is anticipated on application of the magnetic field in analogy to the case of B20-type (MnSi-type) alloys 6,7,27 and Cu 2 OSeO 3 (refs 21,22). To demonstrate directly the formation of skyrmions in this system, real-space observations by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) have been performed for a thin-plate sample with thickness of o150 nm. In LTEM the under-and over-focusing of the deflected electron beam can reveal magnetic contrast, which has proven an efficient way to investigate skyrmion textures 7 . A thin-plate specimen was sliced out from a polycrystalline ingot consisting of single-crystalline grains as large as several tens to hundred mm 3 , and LTEM observations were performed for single-crystalline areas of larger than 100 mm 2 with specific crystallographic axes fortuitously normal to the thin plate. Figure 2a,b show the LTEM images for the (111) grain of Co 8 Zn 8 Mn 4 taken in the under-focus condition at 283 K. At H ¼ 0 (Fig. 2a), a magnetic stripe structure is observed with a periodicity (lB124 nm) that is in excellent agreement with the SANS result (lB125 nm). On applying H ¼ 400 Oe normal to the plate, the emergence of a skyrmion crystal (SkX) is clearly observed (Fig. 2b).Formation of the chiral skyrmion above room temperature.

        <p>Figure 2c-f show the LTEM images obtained for a (110) grain of Co 8 Zn 10 Mn 2 at 345 K. Different from the former case of Co 8 Zn 8 Mn 4 , there is no discernible magnetic contrast at H ¼ 0 in the region shown in Fig. 2c in spite of ToT c , and magnetic stripes develop only in limited areas at this temperature (not shown). Considering the fact that LTEM is only susceptible to the in-plane components of the magnetic induction, which reflects in-plane magnetization that does not cancel out when summed up along the thickness direction of the plate, a possible assignment of this phase is a helix with propagation vector directed normal to the plane, as conjectured from observations in the bulk B20 compounds 6,31 . On application of magnetic field, however, a SkX emerges despite the absence of a helical structure with in-plane propagation vector at H ¼ 0.

        <p>Convergent-beam electron diffraction (CBED) patterns can be utilized to assign the crystal chirality of the region where the LTEM image of Co 8 Zn 10 Mn 2 was taken. Figure 2g shows the experimental CBED pattern with the [111] incidence, which has three-fold symmetry. The simulated CBED patterns for the possible crystal chiralities of P4 1 32 and P4 3 32 are shown in Fig. 2h,i, respectively. The magnified images (Fig. 2j-r) display significant differences that are dependent on the crystal chirality. The CBED pattern obtained experimentally (Fig. 2g) shows good agreement with the simulated pattern for the crystal chirality of P4 1 32 (Fig. 2h). The observed region was further shown to be a single crystallographic domain, and therefore of unique crystal chirality. This unique crystal chirality is hence reflected by the unique sign of the DM interaction so that the magnetic helicity of the skyrmions is fully aligned over the whole region (Fig. 2e), similiar to the case of the other cubic chiral magnets 7,21,27 .Convergent-beam electron diffraction (CBED) patterns can be utilized to assign the crystal chirality of the region where the LTEM image of Co 8 Zn 10 Mn 2 was taken.

        <p>Magnetic phase diagrams in the bulk and thin-plate form. The signature of the SkX formation in bulk specimens was also observed by magnetization measurements. Figure 3a shows isothermal dM/dH versus H curves measured at different temperatures for a polycrystalline piece of Co 8 Zn 9 Mn 3 . Between B311 and B320 K, a characteristic dip structure can be clearly seen at B100 Oe, signalling the formation of the SkX in analogy with the B20-type alloys 33 and Cu 2 OSeO 3 systems 21,22 . The magnetic phase diagram can be established from a contour plot of dM/dH, as shown in Fig. 3b. The SkX phase in the bulk appears in a relatively narrow temperature window with a width of B9 K just below the helical ordering temperature. These features are in accordance with the phase diagram of bulk B20 alloys 6 and Cu 2 OSeO 3 (refs 21,22), and suggest that thermal fluctuations play a crucial role in stabilising the SkX phase also in this system of bulk form 6 . To observe directly the SkX and uncover the influence of dimensionality on its stability, the phase diagram of a (111) thin plate (o150 nm) of Co 8 Zn 9 Mn 3 was studied with the use of LTEM. Figures 3c-e and3f-h show typical LTEM images and their Fourier transformed images taken at H ¼ 0.7 kOe. At T ¼ 295 K, a stripe structure with weak contrast in real space (Fig. 3c) and broad peaks in Fourier space (Fig. 3f) is observed, suggesting the system to be in the helical phase. At 315 K (Fig. 3d,g), the formation of the SkX with hexagonal symmetry is clearly observed. Further increase of the temperature to 320 K (Fig. 3e,h) results in the disappearance of magnetic contrast as the system enters the paramagnetic phase. Figure 3i shows a contour plot of the skyrmion density as a function of magnetic field versus temperature. The magnetic field range required to induce the SkX phase in the thin plate is significantly increased compared with the bulk case due to the demagnetization factor of the plate-like geometry 7,21,27 . Likewise, the SkX phase expands over a wider temperature range of B20 K. As was the case for the other chiral magnets, this can be interpreted in terms of a relative suppression of the competing conical phase with out-of-plane propagation vector compared with the bulk case 7,21,27 .Magnetic phase diagrams in the bulk and thin-plate form.

        <p>Sample preparation. Polycrystalline samples of Co x Zn y Mn z (x þ y þ z ¼ 20) were synthesized by the method described in ref. 29. Stoichiometric amounts of pure Co, Zn and Mn pieces of 2 g total mass were sealed in evacuated quartz tubes (B10 À 3 Pa), heated to 1,000 °C for 12 h, followed by slow cooling (1 °C h À 1 ) down to 925 °C, then kept at this temperature for 75-100 h. Finally, the products were water quenched. A polycrystalline sample of Co 8 Zn 8 Mn 4 with larger grain sizes (typically up to 3 mm) was grown by the Bridgman method with cooling from 1,025 °C to B700 °C over 1 week, followed by water quench. A single-crystalline specimen was cut out from the resultant product and oriented with use of back-reflection X-ray Laue photographs.Sample preparation. Polycrystalline samples of Co x Zn y Mn z (x þ y þ z ¼ 20) were synthesized by the method described in ref. 29. Stoichiometric amounts of pure Co, Zn and Mn pieces of 2 g total mass were sealed in evacuated quartz tubes (B10 À 3 Pa), heated to 1,000 °C for 12 h, followed by slow cooling (1 °C h À 1 ) down to 925 °C, then kept at this temperature for 75-100 h. Finally, the products were water quenched.

        <p>Magnetization measurements. Magnetization and a.c.-susceptibility were measured by a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer (MPMS3, Quantum Design) equipped with oven and a.c.-susceptibility measurement options. SANS measurements. The long-wavelength magnetic structures in bulk samples of Co x Zn y Mn z were measured using the SANS instrument SANS-I at the Swiss Spallation Neutron Source, Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland. In a typical instrument setup, neutrons of wavelength 10 Å were selected with a full-width at half-maximum spread (Dl/l) of B10%, and collimated over a distance of 18 m before the sample. The scattered neutrons were collected by a position-sensitive multi-detector placed 18 m behind the sample. Polycrystalline ingot samples of Co x Zn y Mn z , and single crystals samples of Co 8 Zn 8 Mn 4 , were mounted inside a horizontal field cryomagnet that was installed on the beamline. The cryomagnet could be rotated so that the direction of applied magnetic field was either approximately parallel, or approximately perpendicular to the neutron beam. For SANS measurements on the polycrystalline samples, the magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the neutron beam (Fig. 1d,e), while measurements on the single crystal samples made use of an applied field approximately parallel to the neutron beam (Fig. 4b,c).Magnetization measurements.

        <p>For either experimental geometry, the SANS measurements were done typically by rotating the sample and cryomagnet ensemble in a step-wise manner around its vertical axis-a so-called rocking scan-and over a sufficiently broad angular range, so as to move the various magnetic diffraction spots through the Bragg condition at the detector. Typical rocking scans spanned an angular range of up to ± 20°with a SANS measurement conducted every 2°. This chosen step size was larger than the calculated instrumental contribution to the rocking half-width of the magnetic Bragg peaks (B0.2°), yet smaller than the observed Lorentz factor-corrected rocking half-widths, which, while sample dependent, were always 4B4.5°. This observation demonstrates the observed rocking widths of the magnetic peaks to be dominated by the mosaicity of the magnetic order in the sample. By summing the detector measurements taken over all rotation angles, all of the diffraction spots can be seen in a single image, thus resulting in the SANS diffraction patterns shown in Figs 1 and4.For either experimental geometry, the SANS measurements were done typically by rotating the sample and cryomagnet ensemble in a step-wise manner around its vertical axis-a so-called rocking scan-and over a sufficiently broad angular range, so as to move the various magnetic diffraction spots through the Bragg condition at the detector.

        <p>Determination of the crystallographic chirality. The crystal chirality of Co 8 Zn 10 Mn 2 was determined by using CBED pattern. The CBED pattern was obtained by using a JEM-2100F at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV at room temperature. For the simulation of CBED patterns, the 
            <rs type="software">MBFIT</rs> software 34 was used. From the comparison between the experimental and simulated CBED patterns, the crystal chirality can be determined uniquely.

        <p>LTEM measurements. For LTEM measurements, thin plates were cut from polycrystalline samples and thinned by mechanical polishing and argon ion milling. The crystal orientation and thickness were confirmed by conventional TEM observation and the electron energy-loss spectroscopy, respectively. In LTEM observations, the magnetic structures can be imaged as convergences (bright contrast) or divergences (dark contrast) of the electron beam on the defocused (under-or over focused) image planes. The inversion of contrast between the over-and under-focused images as well as disappearance of the contrast above T c assured the magnetic origin of the image contrast. The analysis of the in-plane components of magnetic induction (which reflects the in-plane magnetization) from the LTEM data was performed by the transport-of-intensity equation method with use of the
