        <p>We present a sample of 80 candidate strongly lensed galaxies with flux density above 100 mJy at 500 µm extracted from the Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey, over an area of 600 deg 2 . Available imaging and spectroscopic data allow us to confirm the strong lensing in 20 cases and to reject it in one case. For other eight objects, the lensing scenario is strongly supported by the presence of two sources along the same line of sight with distinct photometric redshifts. The remaining objects await more follow-up observations to confirm their nature. The lenses and the background sources have median redshifts z L = 0.6 and z S = 2.5, respectively, and are observed out to z L = 1.2 and z S = 4.2. We measure the number counts of candidate lensed galaxies at 500 µm and compare them with theoretical predictions, finding a good agreement for a maximum magnification of the background sources in the range 10-20. These values are consistent with the magnification factors derived from the lens modelling of individual systems. The catalogue presented here provides sub-mm bright targets for follow-up observations aimed at exploiting gravitational lensing, to study with unprecedented details the morphological and dynamical properties of dusty star-forming regions in z 1.5 galaxies.We present a sample of 80 candidate strongly lensed galaxies with flux density above 100 mJy at 500 µm extracted from the Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey, over an area of 600 deg 2 .

        <p>. The selection of strongly lensed galaxies at these wavelengths is made possible by the (predicted) steep number counts of high-redshift sub-mm galaxies (Blain 1996;Negrello et al. 2007); in fact, almost exclusively, those galaxies whose flux density has been boosted by an event of lensing can be observed above a certain threshold, namely ∼100 mJy at 500 µm (Negrello et al. 2010;Wardlow et al. 2013)..

        <p>By means of a simple selection in flux density at 500 µm, Negrello et al. (2010) produced the first sample of five strongly lensed galaxies from 16 deg2 of the sky observed with Herschel during the Science Demonstration Phase (SDP) as part of the Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey 1 (Eales et al. 2010, H-ATLAS hereafter). Preliminary source catalogues derived from the full H-ATLAS were then used to identify the sub-mm brightest candidate lensed galaxies for follow-up observations with both ground based and space telescopes to measure their redshifts (Frayer et al. 2011;Omont et al. 2011Omont et al. , 2013;;Valtchanov et al. 2011;Harris et al. 2012;Lupu et al. 2012;George et al. 2013;Messias et al. 2014) and confirm their nature (Negrello et al. 2010(Negrello et al. , 2014;;Bussmann et al. 2012Bussmann et al. , 2013;;Fu et al. 2012;Calanog et al. 2014). Using the same methodology, i.e. a cut in flux density at 500 µm, Wardlow et al. (2013) have identified 11 lensed galaxies over 95 deg 2 of the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey (HerMES; Oliver et al. 2012), while, more recently, Nayyeri et al. (2016) have published a catalogue of 77 candidate lensed galaxies with F 500 ≥ 100 mJy extracted from the HerMES Large Mode Survey (HeLMS; Oliver et al. 2012) and the Herschel Stripe 82 Survey (HerS; Viero et al. 2014), over an area of 372 deg 2 . All together, the extragalactic surveys carried out with Herschel are expected to deliver a sample of more than a hundred of sub-mm bright strongly lensed galaxies, which, as argued by Gonzalez-Nuevo et al. (2012), might increase to over a thousand if the selection is based on the steepness of the luminosity function of DSFGs (Lapi et al. 2011) rather than that of the number counts. Similarly, at mm wavelengths, the SPT survey has already discovered several tens of lensed galaxies (e.g. Vieira et al. 2013;Spilker et al. 2016) and other lensing events have been found in the Planck all-sky surveys (Cañameras et al. 2015;Planck Collaboration XXVII 2015;Harrington et al. 2016) Having a large sample of strongly lensed DSFGs is important for several reasons. (i) Thanks to the boosting in luminosity and increase in angular size offered by gravitational lensing, distant galaxies can be studied with unprecedented details down to sub-kpc scales. For sub-mm/mm-selected sources, this means understanding the morphological and dynamical properties of individual giant molecular clouds in a statistically significant sample of dusty galaxies across the peak of the cosmic star formation history of the Universe (e.g. Swinbank et al. 2010;Dye et al. 2015). (ii) The observed lensed morphology is determined by the content and the spatial distribution of the total (baryonic+dark) matter in the foreground galaxy; therefore, by means of high-resolution imaging data at submm/mm wavelengths -as now provided by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) -gravitational lensing allows the detection of low-mass sub-structures in the lenses, whose abundance can be used to test the cold-dark-matter scenario of structure formation on small scales (e.g. Mao &amp; Schneider 1998;Metcalf &amp; Madau 2001;Dalal &amp; Kochanek 2002;Vegetti et al. 2012;Hezaveh et al. 2013Hezaveh et al. , 2016;;Inoue et al. 2016); in this respect, it is worth noticing that for sub-mm/mm-selected lensed galaxies, the contamination of the lens -typically a passively evolving elliptical galaxy -to the sub-mm emission of the background galaxy is negligible. Therefore, the modelling of the lensed morphology does not suffer from uncertainties on the lens subtraction, as usually happens in optically selected lensing systems; furthermore, since the sample of lensed galaxies is constructed by exploiting the properties of the background galaxy alone, i.e. its sub-mm flux density, it is less biased against the redshift and the mass of the lens, compared to standard optical/spectroscopic selection techniques, thus allowing us to probe the mass distribution of foreground galaxies out to z 1(e.g. Dye et al. 2014). (iii) The statistics of lenses, as well 1 www.h-atlas.org as the distribution and extent of the image separations, depend on the dark-matter and dark-energy content of the Universe; therefore, large samples of gravitational lenses can be used to constrain cosmological parameters (e.g. Grillo, Lombardi &amp; Bertin 2008;Eales 2015).By means of a simple selection in flux density at 500 µm, Negrello et al.

        <p>Candidate lensed galaxies were selected from the Herschel/SPIRE (Griffin et al. 2010) catalogue of the H-ATLAS Data Release 1 and 2 (Valiante et al. 2016). These catalogues are created in two stages. First, the Multiband Algorithm for source Detection and eXtraction (MADX; Maddox et al., in preparation) is used to identify the 2.5σ peaks in the 250 µm maps and to measure the flux densities at the position of those peaks in all the SPIRE bands. The maps used for the flux measurements have been filtered with a matched-filter technique (Chapin et al. 2011) to minimize instrumental and confusion noise. Secondly, only sources with signal-to-noise ratio ≥4 in at least one of the three SPIRE bands are kept in the final catalogue. The 4σ detection limit at 250 µm for a point source ranges from 24 mJy in the deepest regions of the maps (where tiles overlap) to 29 mJy in the non-overlapping regions. For more details about the source extraction procedure and the flux-density measurements, we refer the reader to Valiante et al. (2016). The catalogue and the maps will be made available at the H-ATLAS website: www.h-atlas.org.Candidate lensed galaxies were selected from the Herschel/SPIRE (Griffin et al. 2010) catalogue of the H-ATLAS Data Release 1 and 2 (Valiante et al. 2016).

        <p>Flux-density measurements for extended galaxies are currently only available for sources detected in the H-ATLAS equatorial fields. Therefore, in the present analysis, we only use point-source flux densities. This is not an issue for lensed galaxies, as they do appear as point sources in the SPIRE maps. Extended galaxies are treated as contaminants to be removed from the final sample and they are identified by means of available optical imaging data; therefore, their precise flux density at sub-mm wavelengths is not a concern. We warn the reader against using the number of local galaxies with F 500 ≥ 100 mJy derived here for comparison with theoretical models, as such number is significantly underestimating the true density of local galaxies that have 500 µm flux density above the adopted threshold.Flux-density measurements for extended galaxies are currently only available for sources detected in the H-ATLAS equatorial fields.

        <p>According to model predictions (Blain 1996;Perrotta et al. 2002Perrotta et al. , 2003;;Lapi et al. 2006Lapi et al. , 2011;;Negrello et al. 2007Negrello et al. , 2010)), the number counts of unlensed DSFGs are expected to drop abruptly at 500 µm flux densities of 100 mJy, as an effect of the intrinsically steep luminosity function and high redshift (z 1.5) of these sources. Therefore, we start by selecting all the sources with F 500 ≥ 100 mJy. They are 325 in total. A fraction of these sources are either low-redshift (z 0.1) spiral galaxies or flat spectrum radio sources (e.g. Negrello et al. 2007). Both of these classes of objects are considered as 'contaminants' for the purpose of this paper, and therefore need to be identified and removed. We used the interactive software

            <rs type="software">ALADIN</rs> (Bonnarel et al. 2000) to inspect available optical, IR and radio imaging data and to query the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database3 (NED) around the position of each source.

        <p>231 spiral-like galaxies with an angular size exceeding several arcseconds in optical images were categorized as local galaxies. All were confirmed as local galaxies via available spectroscopic redshift. Their redshift distribution is shown in Fig. 1.

All were confirmed as local galaxies via available spectroscopic redshift. Their redshift distribution is shown in Fig. 1.

        <p>The lenses in the sample exhibit a wide range of redshifts, from z L = 0.22 up to 1.22, with a median redshift z L = 0.6. This is a consequence of our selection technique, which is based exclusively on the observed properties of the background source, i.e. its flux density. No prior information on the lens properties is introduced during the lensed galaxy search. This means that samples of submm-selected lenses can allow us to study of the evolution of the mass density profile of galaxies out to high redshift (z &gt; 1) and over a wide range of galaxy masses (e.g. Dye et al. 2014). For each source the following information is provided: Herschel/SPIRE flux densities; reliability of association with any SDSS source within 5 arcsec from the SPIRE position and with r &lt; 22.4 (Bourne et al. 2016;Furlanetto et al. 2016); distance of the SDSS source from the SPIRE detection and its AB r-band magnitude; redshift of the SDSS association and of the SPIRE source (when no spectroscopic measurement is available, the photometric redshift is provided instead, in italic style); lensing rank: A = confirmed to be lensed, B = likely to be lensed, C = unclear, D = not (strongly) lensed; magnification factor derived from the modelling of high-resolution sub-mm/mm imaging data. Magnification factors, μ, have been derived from the lens modelling of the high-resolution imaging data shown in Fig. 3. Those obtained at sub-mm wavelengths from SMA (and ALMA for HATLAS090311.6+003907 and HATLASJ142935.3-002836) data are reported in Table 4. For three objects, the magnification factor derived by Bussmann et al.

        <p>A colour-colour plot based on the Herschel/SPIRE photometry is shown in Fig. 4 for candidate lensed galaxies (dots), local galaxies (squares) and blazars (triangles) with F 500 ≥ 100 mJy.

        <p>In the lower panel of Fig. 5, we show the redshift distribution of the candidate lensed galaxies with F 500 ≥ 100 mJy, with photometric redshifts replaced by spectroscopic ones where available. The Ivison et al. (2013) source is not included in the plot, as it is known to not be strongly lensed. The distribution is derived by performing 10 000 simulations. Each time, the redshift of the sources is resampled at random, from a Gaussian probability distribution with a mean equal to the measured photometric/spectroscopic redshift and dispersion equal to the associated error. The simulated redshifts are then binned into a histogram and the mean value in each bin is taken as the estimate of the number of objects in that bin. Error bars, corresponding to the 68 per cent confidence interval, are derived following the prescriptions of Gehrels et al. (1986) for Poisson statistics. The median redshift is z median = 2.53. Similar median redshifts are obtained for the spectroscopic redshift sample and the photometric redshift sample alone, i.e. z median = 2.49 and 2.54, respectively (the two distributions are shown in the upper panel of Fig. 5). The measured redshift distribution is consistent with predictions based on the physical model of Cai et al. (2013) once combined with the lensing formalism of Lapi et al. (2012) for maximum magnifications in the range 10-15 (see Section 4.2 for details on the modelling). We use the redshift information to derive the IR luminosity, L IR (integrated over the rest-frame wavelength range 8--1000 µm), of our candidate lensed galaxies. We assume a single temperature, optically thin, modified blackbody spectrum with dust emissivity index β = 1.5 (Bussmann et al. 2013;Nayyeri et al. 2016) and we fit it to the Herschel photometry of each source. The IR luminosity and dust temperature, T dust , are kept as free parameters. In order to account for the uncertainty on the photometric/spectroscopic redshift, as well as that on the photometry, we perform for each source 1000 simulations by resampling at random the distributions of redshift values and measured flux densities, both assumed to be Gaussian. The final values of L IR and T dust , shown in Fig. 6, are obtained as the median of the derived distributions of 1000 best-fitting values. All the galaxies in the sample appear to be HyLIRGs (i.e. L IR ≥ 10 13 L ). However, with an expected typical magnification of ∼5-15 (Lapi et al. 2012;Bussmann et al. 2013;Dye et al. 2014, see also Fig. 9), most of them are likely to be intrinsically ultraluminous infrared galaxies (10 12 ≤ L IR /L ≤ 10 13 ). The median value of the dust temperature is T dust = 34.6, consistent with what was found for other sub-mm/mm-selected unlensed (Magnelli et al. 2012) and lensed (Weiß et al. 2013;Cañameras et al. 2015;Nayyeri et al. 2016) galaxies. Bourne et al. (2016) and Furlanetto et al. (2016) used a likelihoodratio (LR) technique (Richter et al. 1975;Sutherland &amp; Saunders 1992;Ciliegi et al. 2003) to identify SDSS counterparts with r &lt; 22.4 to the H-ATLAS sources in the GAMA fields and in the NGP field, respectively. This technique exploits the knowledge of the intrinsic positional uncertainty of the sources, as well as the magnitude distributions of true counterparts and background sources to assign a probability ('reliability', R) to each potential match, thus allowing us to distinguish robust counterparts from chance alignments with background sources. We consider an optical source to be reliable counterpart to the Heschel/SPIRE detection if R &gt; 0.8. We do not expect lensed DSFGs to be visible in the optical above the adopted r-band limit, because of the combined effect of high redshift and dust obscuration. However, in gravitational lensing systems, the foreground object acting as the lens, usually an elliptical galaxy at redshifts z ∼ 0.3-0.8 (see Table 4), is likely to be detected at optical and/or near-IR wavelengths. We find that nine of the yet to be confirmed lensed galaxies have a reliable optical counterpart in SDSS, but the photometric redshift of the SDSS source (where available) is much lower than the one derived from the Herschel/SPIRE photometry, as reported in Table 4. This is consistent with the lensing scenario where the lens is detected in the optical while the background galaxy entirely contributes to the far-IR/sub-mm emission. The estimated high reliability of the association between two distinct objects is actually determined by gravitational lensing, which physically relates them. This effect was already observed in the first sample of five lensed galaxies discovered by Negrello et al. (2010).In the lower panel of Fig. 5, we show the redshift distribution of the candidate lensed galaxies with F 500 ≥ 100 mJy, with photometric redshifts replaced by spectroscopic ones where available.

No LR analysis has been performed on near-IR catalogues yet; however, we note that most of our candidate lensed galaxies have a near-IR source (or even more than one in some cases) within a 5 arcsec distance, likely to be the lens, with eventually some contribution from the background galaxy (see e.g. Negrello et al. 2014). There is an ongoing effort to measure the redshift of these near-IR counterparts to confirm that they lie at z 1.</p>

        <p>density. Here, we focus on the strong lensing regime, which occurs when multiple images of the background source are formed. The typical separation between multiple images is of the order of one to a few arcseconds. Such angular scales are below the resolution capabilities of Herschel which, in the case of a lensing event, can only measure the summed flux of the multiple images. For this reason, we will only consider the total magnification, μ tot , experienced by a source, i.e. the sum of the modulus of the magnifications of the individual images. In equation ( 2), the minimum value of μ in the integration is fixed to the lowest value of μ tot , which corresponds to the formation of multiple images. For lenses with a mass profile described by a Singular Isothermal Sphere model -as supported by the modelling of individual lensing systems (e.g. Dye et al. 2014) -the strong lensing regime is achieved when μ tot ≥ 2. Therefore, we set μ min = 2. On the other hand, the value of μ max mainly depends on the intrinsic angular size of the background source: in general, the more compact the source, the higher the maximum magnification that can be achieved (see e.g. fig. 8 of Lapi et al. 2012). Perrotta et al. (2002) showed that for a source in the redshift range z = 1-4, with typical size 1-10 kpc, consistent with observations of the dust-emitting region in DSFGs (e.g. Riechers et al. 2013Riechers et al. , 2014;;De Breuck et al. 2014;Simpson et al. 2014Simpson et al. , 2015;;Hodge et al. 2015Hodge et al. , 2016;;Ikarashi et al. 2015;Lindroos et al. 2016), the value of μ tot lies in the range 10-30 (see also Lapi et al. 2012).density.

        <p>In the following, we work out predictions for different values for μ max in the range 10-30. The function p(μ, z S ) depends on several factors: the distribution in mass and in redshift of the lenses and their mass profile. For a given lens of mass M L and redshift z L , and a given redshift of source z S , one can define, in the source plane, the cross-section, (&gt;μ|M L , z L , z S ), for lensing events with total magnification &gt;μ, i.e. the area containing all the source positions for which μ tot &gt; μ. In the strong lensing regime, the probability P( &gt; μ|z S ) that a source is magnified by a value higher than μ is significantly lower than unity (as multiple images are only formed when the source and the lens are sufficiently well aligned), and it is very unlikely that the source is lensed by more than one foreground mass (i.e. 'non-overlapping' cross-sections approximation). In this regime, the probability P( &gt; μ|z S ) is just (e.g. Peacock 1982)In the following, we work out predictions for different values for μ max in the range 10-30.

        <p>where dN L /dM L dz L is the number density of the lenses per unit interval in mass and in redshift. The (differential) probability distribution of the magnifications can then be obtained by differentiating, i.e. p(μ|z S ) = -dP( &gt; μ|z S )/dμ. The total mass distribution of the lenses is described by the mass function of the dark-matter haloes derived from N-body simulation (e.g. Sheth &amp; Tormen 1999). Therefore, the main uncertainty in the modelling of p is related to the choice of the cross-section ( &gt; μ|M L , z L , z S )), which strictly depends on the mass profile of the lenses.

As shown by, e.g. Lapi et al.

The range of integral number densities of lensed galaxies produced by the simulations is shown by the red shaded region in the bottom-right panel of Fig. 7. Large fluctuations in the number of the brightest lensed galaxies, as those observed in the GAMA+NGP versus SGP field, are quite rare, but not unlikely to occur.

        <p>This H-ATLAS catalogue of candidate lensed galaxies will provide valuable targets for follow-up observations aimed at studying with unprecedented detail the morphological and dynamical properties of DSFGs at z ∼ 2, as recently demonstrated by the analysis of the high-resolution ALMA observations of SDP.81 (ALMA partnership 2015; Dye et al. 2015;Hatsukade et al. 2015;Rybak et al. 2015a,b;Swinbank et al. 2015;Tamura et al. 2015;Hezaveh et al. 2016), one of the first lensed galaxies discovered with Herschel (Negrello et al. 2010).This H-ATLAS catalogue of candidate lensed galaxies will provide valuable targets for follow-up observations aimed at studying with unprecedented detail the morphological and dynamical properties of DSFGs at z ∼ 2, as recently demonstrated by the analysis of the high-resolution ALMA observations of SDP.81 (ALMA partnership 2015; Dye et al. 2015;Hatsukade et al. 2015;Rybak et al. 2015a,b;Swinbank et al. 2015;Tamura et al. 2015;Hezaveh et al. 2016), one of the first lensed galaxies discovered with Herschel (Negrello et al. 2010).</p>
