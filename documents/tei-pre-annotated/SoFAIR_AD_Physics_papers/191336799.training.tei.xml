        <p>The study of Λ 0 b baryon decays is of considerable interest for several reasons. Firstly, as the Λ 0 b baryon has non-zero spin, there is the potential to improve the limited understanding of the helicity structure of the underlying Hamiltonian, which cannot be extracted from meson decays [1,2]. Secondly, as the Λ 0 b baryon may be considered as consisting of a heavy quark combined with a light diquark system, the hadronic physics differs significantly from that of the B meson decay. A further motivation specific to the Λ 0 b → Λµ + µ -channel is that the polarisation of the Λ baryon is preserved in the Λ → pπ -decay, 1 giving access to complementary information to that available from meson decays [3].The study of Λ 0 b baryon decays is of considerable interest for several reasons.

        <p>Theoretical aspects of the Λ 0 b → Λµ + µ -decay have been considered both in the SM and in some of its extensions [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16]. Although based on the same effective Hamiltonian as that for the corresponding mesonic transitions, the hadronic form factors for the Λ 0 b baryon case are less well-known due to the less stringent experimental constraints. This leads to a large spread in the predicted branching fractions. The decay has a non-trivial angular structure which, in the case of unpolarised Λ 0 b production, is described by the helicity angles of the muon and proton, the angle between the planes defined by the Λ decay products and the two muons, and the square of the dimuon invariant mass, q 2 . In theoretical investigations, the differential branching fraction, and forward-backward asymmetries for both the dilepton and the hadron systems of the decay, have received particular attention [3,11,[15][16][17].

        <p>In previous observations of the decay Λ 0 b → Λµ + µ - [18,19], evidence for signal had been limited to q 2 values above the square of the mass of the ψ(2S) resonance.

        <p>The final selection is based on a neural network classifier [41,42], exploiting 15 variables carrying kinematic, candidate quality and particle identification information. Both the track parameter resolutions and kinematic properties are different for downstream and long Λ decays and therefore a separate training is performed for each category. The signal sample used to train the neural network consists of simulated Λ 0 b → Λµ + µ -events, while the background is taken from data in the upper sideband of the Λ 0 b candidate mass spectrum, between 6.0 and 7.0 GeV/c 2 . Candidates with a dimuon mass in either the J/ψ or ψ(2S) regions (±100 MeV/c 2 intervals around their known masses) are excluded from the training samples. The variable that provides the greatest discrimination in the case of long candidates is the χ 2 from the kinematic fit. For downstream candidates, the p T of the Λ candidate is the most powerful variable. Other variables that contribute significantly are: the PID information for muons; the separation of the muons, the pion and the Λ 0 b candidate from the PV; the distance between the Λ and Λ 0 b decay vertices; and the pointing angle, θ D . The requirement on the response of the neural network classifier is chosen separately for low-and high-q 2 candidates using two different figures of merit. In the low-q 2 region, where the signal has not been previously established, the figure of merit ε/( √ N B +a/2) [43] is used, where ε and N B are the signal efficiency and the expected number of background decays and a is the target significance; a value of a = 3 is used. In contrast, for the high-q 2 region the figure of merit N S / √ N S + N B is maximised, where N S is the expected number of signal candidates. To ensure an appropriate normalisation of N S , the number of Λ 0 b → J/ψ Λ candidates that satisfy the preselection is scaled by the measured ratio of branching fractions of [19], and the J/ψ → µ + µ -branching fraction [39]. The value of N B is determined by extrapolating the number of candidate decays found in the background training sample into the signal region. Relative to the preselected event sample, the neural network retains approximately 96% (66%) of downstream candidates and 97% (82%) of long candidates for the selection at high (low) q 2 .The final selection is based on a neural network classifier [41,42], exploiting 15 variables carrying kinematic, candidate quality and particle identification information.

        <p>In addition to combinatorial background formed from the random combination of particles, backgrounds due to specific decays are studied using fully reconstructed samples of simulated b hadron decays in which the final state includes two muons. For the Λ 0 b → J/ψ Λ channel, the only significant contribution is from B 0 → J/ψ K 0 S decays, with K 0 S → π + π - where one of the pions is misidentified as a proton. This decay contains a long-lived K 0 S meson and therefore has the same topology as the Λ 0 b → J/ψ Λ mode.

        <p>The relative efficiency for the ratio of branching fractions in each q 2 interval, calculated from the absolute efficiencies described above, is shown in figure 4. The increase in efficiency as a function of increasing q 2 is dominated by two effects. Firstly, at low q 2 the muons have lower momenta and therefore have a lower probability of satisfying the trigger requirements. Secondly, at low q 2 the Λ baryon has a larger fraction of the Λ 0 b momentum and is more likely to decay outside of the acceptance of the detector. Separate selections are used for the low-and high-q 2 regions and, as can be seen in figure 4, the tighter neural network requirement used in the low-q 2 region has a stronger effect on downstream candidates.The relative efficiency for the ratio of branching fractions in each q 2 interval, calculated from the absolute efficiencies described above, is shown in figure 4.

Simulated experiments are then generated according to the measured angular distributions and smeared using the angular resolution maps. The simulated events, before and after smearing by the angular resolution function, are fitted with the default PDF. The average deviations from the default values are assigned as systematic uncertainties. These are larger for the A h FB observable because the resolution is poorer for cos θ h and the distribution is more asymmetric, yielding a net migration effect. The uncertainties from this source are in the ranges [0.011, 0.016] for A FB , [-0.001, -0.007] for A h FB and [0.002, 0.008] for f L , depending on q 2 .Resolution effects may induce an asymmetric migration of events between bins and therefore generate a bias in the measured value of the forward-backward asymmetries.

        <p>An imprecise determination of the efficiency due to data-simulation discrepancies could bias the A FB measurement. To estimate the potential impact arising from this source, the kinematic reweighting described in section 7.2 is removed from the simulation. Simulated samples are fitted using the same theoretical PDF multiplied by the efficiency function obtained with and without kinematical reweighting. The average biases evaluated from simulated experiments are assigned as systematic uncertainties. These are larger for sparsely populated q 2 intervals and vary in the intervals [0.009, 0.016] for A FB , [0.001, 0.007] for A h FB and [0.002, 0.044] for f L , depending on q 2 . The effect of the limited knowledge of the Λ 0 b polarisation is investigated by varying the polarisation within its measured uncertainties, in the same way as for the branching fraction measurement. No significant effect is found and therefore no contribution is assigned.An imprecise determination of the efficiency due to data-simulation discrepancies could bias the A FB measurement.

        <p>As there is ambiguity in the choice of parametrisation for the background model, in particular for regions with low statistical significance in data, simulated experiments are generated from a PDF corresponding to the best fit to data, for each q 2 interval. Each simulated sample is fitted with two models: the nominal fit model, consisting of the product of a linear function and the signal efficiency, and an alternative model formed from a constant function multiplied by the efficiency shape. The average deviations are taken as systematic JHEP06(2015)115 . Measured values of (left) the leptonic and (right) the hadronic forward-backward asymmetries in bins of q 2 . Data points are only shown for q 2 intervals where a statistically significant signal yield is found, see text for details. The (red) triangle represents the values for the 15 &lt; q 2 &lt; 20 GeV 2 /c 4 interval. Standard Model predictions are obtained from ref. [17].As there is ambiguity in the choice of parametrisation for the background model, in particular for regions with low statistical significance in data, simulated experiments are generated from a PDF corresponding to the best fit to data, for each q 2 interval.

        <p>The measured values of the leptonic and hadronic forward-backward asymmetries, A FB and A h FB , and the f L observable are summarised in table 5, with the asymmetries shown in figure 8. The statistical uncertainties are obtained using the likelihood-ratio ordering method [49] where only one of the two observables at a time is treated as the parameter of interest. In this analysis nuisance parameters were accounted for using the plug-in method [50]. In figure 9

        <p>A measurement of the differential branching fraction of the Λ 0 b → Λµ + µ -decay is performed using data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb -1 , recorded by the LHCb detector at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. Signal is observed for the first time at a significance of more than three standard deviations in two q 2 intervals: 0.1 &lt; q 2 &lt; 2.0 GeV 2 /c 4 , close to the photon pole, and between the charmonium resonances. No significant signal is observed in the 1.1 &lt; q 2 &lt; 6.0 GeV 2 /c 4 range. The uncertainties of the measurements in the region 15 &lt; q 2 &lt; 20 GeV 2 /c 4 are reduced by a factor of approximately three relative to previous LHCb measurements [19]. The improvements in the results, which supersede those of ref. [19], are due to the larger data sample size and a better control of systematic uncertainties. The measurements are compatible with the predictions of the Standard Model in the high-q 2 region and lie below the predictions in the low-q 2 region.A measurement of the differential branching fraction of the Λ 0 b → Λµ + µ -decay is performed using data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb -1 , recorded by the LHCb detector at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV.
