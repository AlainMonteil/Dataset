        <p>We present redshift distribution estimates of galaxies selected from the fourth data release of the Kilo-Degree Survey over an area of ∼1000 deg 2 (KiDS-1000). These redshift distributions represent one of the crucial ingredients for weak gravitational lensing measurements with the KiDS-1000 data. The primary estimate is based on deep spectroscopic reference catalogues that are re-weighted with the help of a self-organising map (SOM) to closely resemble the KiDS-1000 sources, split into five tomographic redshift bins in the photometric redshift range 0.1 &lt; z B ≤ 1.2. Sources are selected such that they only occupy that volume of nine-dimensional magnitude-space that is also covered by the reference samples ('gold' selection). Residual biases in the mean redshifts determined from this calibration are estimated from mock catalogues to be 0.01 for all five bins with uncertainties of ∼0.01. This primary SOM estimate of the KiDS-1000 redshift distributions is complemented with an independent clustering redshift approach. After validation of the clustering-z on the same mock catalogues and a careful assessment of systematic errors, we find no significant bias of the SOM redshift distributions with respect to the clustering-z measurements. The SOM redshift distributions re-calibrated by the clustering-z represent an alternative calibration of the redshift distributions with only slightly larger uncertainties in the mean redshifts of ∼0.01-0.02 to be used in KiDS-1000 cosmological weak lensing analyses. As this includes the SOM uncertainty, clustering-z are shown to be fully competitive on KiDS-1000 data.We present redshift distribution estimates of galaxies selected from the fourth data release of the Kilo-Degree Survey over an area of ∼1000 deg 2 (KiDS-1000).

        <p>One of the most important goals of observational astronomy has always been to add a third dimension to the two-dimensional images of the sky. In modern extra-galactic imaging surveys containing tens of millions of galaxies this information is obtained with the technique of photometric redshifts (photo-z; see Salvato et al. 2019, for a recent review). The cosmological redshift leads to a reddening of galaxy spectra that can be detected by observing a galaxy in different photometric passbands. This can yield approximate redshifts at a much higher efficiency and to fainter magnitudes than any spectroscopic technique, albeit at significantly reduced precision.One of the most important goals of observational astronomy has always been to add a third dimension to the two-dimensional images of the sky.

        <p>Measurements of weak gravitational lensing (WL; see e.g., Bartelmann &amp; Schneider 2001) crucially depend on photo-z to estimate the geometric factors that enter the modelling of this effect. The accuracy of the cosmological conclusions drawn from modern WL surveys depends directly on the accuracy of the photo-z used to model the WL observables (Huterer et al. 2006). In this process, it is useful to distinguish two different regimes where multi-band photometric information is typically used (Newman et al. 2015). First, approximate individual redshifts for all galaxies used in a WL measurement are estimated to bin the galaxies along the redshift axis. Secondly, the same photometric information is used to estimate the redshift distributions of the ensembles of galaxies in these so-called tomographic bins. While high precision is desirable for the first task in order to attain a high resolution along the line-of-sight, accuracy of the second task determines the quality of the cosmological estimates from statistical WL measurements in the end.Measurements of weak gravitational lensing (WL; see e.g., Bartelmann &amp; Schneider 2001) crucially depend on photo-z to estimate the geometric factors that enter the modelling of this effect.

        <p>Recently, most surveys have employed template-based techniques (that assume a physical model) to tackle the first problem and empirical or machine-learning (ML) techniques (using e.g., a spectroscopic calibration sample) for the second problem. These choices follow directly from the requirements for the individual photo-z (low scatter) and the redshift distributions of ensembles of galaxies (low bias).Recently, most surveys have employed template-based techniques (that assume a physical model) to tackle the first problem and empirical or machine-learning (ML) techniques (using e.g., a spectroscopic calibration sample) for the second problem.

        <p>In this paper, we concentrate on the second problem and how it is solved for the cosmological analysis of the KiDS-1000 data set based on the fourth data release (Kuijken et al. 2019) of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS; de Jong et al. 2013). The two other ongoing stage-III surveys are the Dark Energy Survey (DES; Flaugher et al. 2015) and the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC; Aihara et al. 2018) survey, whose redshift calibrations in their most recent cosmological analyses are described in Hoyle et al. (2018) and Tanaka et al. (2018), respectively.In this paper, we concentrate on the second problem and how it is solved for the cosmological analysis of the KiDS-1000 data set based on the fourth data release (Kuijken et al. 2019) of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS; de Jong et al. 2013).

        <p>The main requirement is to get an unbiased estimate of the mean redshift of the galaxies in the different tomographic bins (e.g., Laureijs et al. 2011). The uncertainty on this mean redshift needs to be of the order of σ z ∼ 0.01 for stage-III surveys to not seriously jeopardise their constraining power (see Appendix A of Hildebrandt et al. 2017). These uncertainties are propagated into the full error budget and the exact requirement depends on which survey is analysed and which degradation with respect to the pure statistical uncertainty is deemed acceptable.The main requirement is to get an unbiased estimate of the mean redshift of the galaxies in the different tomographic bins (e.g., Laureijs et al. 2011).

        <p>Certainly, higher-order moments of the redshift distributions also play a role. However, as WL is an integrated effect along the line-of-sight, the accuracy in estimating these higherorder moments is less important than the mean redshift and can, under normal conditions, be ignored for stage-III surveys (see e.g., Hoyle et al. 2018); it will become important though for upcoming stage-IV experiments like the ESA/NASA Euclid space mission (Laureijs et al. 2011), the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST; Ivezić et al. 2019), and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (RST; Spergel et al. 2015). For these future missions, not only do the mean redshifts need to be controlled to σ z ∼ 0.001-0.002, but the shape of the distribution also needs to be known accurately. At this level of precision, it also becomes relevant that the redshift distributions vary spatially with observing conditions so that even redshift distributions that perfectly describe the average of a survey are no longer sufficient and additional corrections are needed (Heydenreich et al. 2020). Similarly, correlations between the point spread function (PSF) ellipticity and the accuracy of the redshift measurements can no longer be ignored (Asgari et al. 2019).Certainly, higher-order moments of the redshift distributions also play a role.

        <p>The calibration of the redshifts is usually achieved with the help of a reference sample, which is often spectroscopic but can occasionally also utilise higher-quality photo-z, like the COSMOS-2015 catalogue (Laigle et al. 2016) based on photometry from more than 30 bands. These reference samples are selected in different ways than the WL source samples and hence are in general neither complete nor representative of those source samples. Different techniques have been developed to overcome this limitation, mostly through re-weighting the reference samples and through culling of the source samples. Lima et al. (2008) describe a re-weighting approach that utilises a k-nearest neighbour search in multi-dimensional magnitude-space to reweight a spectroscopic sample such that it resembles a target photometric sample with unknown redshifts, which are the WL sources in our case. This approach was tested in Cunha et al. (2009) and later on used for KiDS in Hildebrandt et al. (2017Hildebrandt et al. ( , 2020) ) as well as for DES (Bonnett et al. 2016;Hoyle et al. 2018), and to some degree also for HSC (Tanaka et al. 2018). The estimated uncertainties with this approach are of the order of σ z ∼ 0.02, which was sufficient for the first cosmological analyses that used only a fraction of the data from the stage-III surveys. In order to fully exploit the statistical power of the completed surveys, these uncertainties have to be improved by a factor of ∼2.The calibration of the redshifts is usually achieved with the help of a reference sample, which is often spectroscopic but can occasionally also utilise higher-quality photo-z, like the COSMOS-2015 catalogue (Laigle et al. 2016) based on photometry from more than 30 bands.

        <p>A similar re-weighting can be achieved by projecting the multi-dimensional magnitude-space into two dimensions with the help of a self-organising map (SOM; Kohonen 1982). This was pioneered in the framework of Euclid by Masters et al. (2015) and is now being used by KiDS (Wright et al. 2020a, hereafter W20a) and HSC (Tanaka et al. 2018), and suggested for DES (Buchs et al. 2019), too. These studies show that the SOM can, under certain conditions, reach uncertainties in the mean redshifts of tomographic bins of σ z ∼ 0.01, or even better. Thus, it represents a very promising technique to calibrate redshifts for WL applications in current and future projects.A similar re-weighting can be achieved by projecting the multi-dimensional magnitude-space into two dimensions with the help of a self-organising map (SOM; Kohonen 1982).

        <p>A complementary estimate of the source redshift distribution can be obtained through crosscorrelation studies (Schneider et al. 2006;Newman 2008;Matthews &amp; Newman 2010;Schmidt et al. 2013;Ménard et al. 2013;McQuinn &amp; White 2013;Morrison et al. 2017;Johnson et al. 2017;Davis et al. 2017;Scottez et al. 2018;Gatti et al. 2018). Here, the colour-information is not used but instead the angular cross-correlation of the positions of a target source sample and a reference sample with known redshifts is employed. The appeal of this technique is that, unlike colourbased methods, the reference and target samples need not share any magnitude-space whatsoever. All galaxies at a given redshift cluster with each other and hence, in principle a bright reference sample that is relatively easy to observe spectroscopically can be used to calibrate the redshift distribution of a faint source sample. Besides spatial overlap on the sky, the most important requirement is that the reference sample covers the whole redshift range that needs to be probed for the target sample. An important nuisance in this method is the presence of galaxy bias: The fact that galaxies are biased tracers of the underlying matter field can influence the measured cross-correlation functions in a systematic fashion. For the purpose of estimating the redshift distribution, the absolute value of the galaxy bias can usually be neglected (its effect is removed through normalisation of the redshift distribution), any redshift evolution of the galaxy bias must be corrected (e.g., Newman 2008;Schmidt et al. 2013).A complementary estimate of the source redshift distribution can be obtained through crosscorrelation studies (Schneider et al. 2006;Newman 2008;Matthews &amp; Newman 2010;Schmidt et al. 2013;Ménard et al. 2013;McQuinn &amp; White 2013;Morrison et al. 2017;Johnson et al. 2017;Davis et al. 2017;Scottez et al. 2018;Gatti et al. 2018).

        <p>Clustering-redshift (clustering-z) measurements in the literature differ in the details of the implementation of the measurement itself as well as the galaxy bias correction scheme. All these approaches have one thing in common though: They do not yield a redshift distribution directly but instead some noisy representation of this distribution that needs to be interpreted via a model. This model can either be based on a different calibration approach (like the colour-based techniques discussed above; see e.g., Hoyle et al. 2018) or take the free form of a parametric function (spline, Gaussian process, etc.; see e.g., Johnson et al. 2017). Fitting this model to the clustering-z measurements thereby yields a redshift distribution estimate which can be propagated (along with relevant uncertainties) into a cosmological measurement. Here, we follow the methodology laid out in van den Busch et al. (2020), who test clustering-z measurements on mock catalogues that resemble the KiDS+VIKING-450 data set (Wright et al. 2019).Clustering-redshift (clustering-z) measurements in the literature differ in the details of the implementation of the measurement itself as well as the galaxy bias correction scheme.

        <p>The KiDS-1000 catalogues used here are based on the fourth data release of KiDS (DR4; Kuijken et al. 2019), which includes near-infrared (NIR) photometry based on imaging from the fully overlapping VISTA Kilo degree INfrared Galaxy Survey (VIKING; Edge et al. 2013;Venemans et al. 2015). This data set comprises PSF-corrected nine-band ugriZY JHK s photometry (Kuijken 2008) and BPZ (Bayesian Photometric Redshift; Benítez 2000) photo-z estimates for more than 100 million objects over an area of ∼1000 deg 2 . This constitutes roughly three quarters of the final KiDS+VIKING data set and more than a doubling of the data volume compared to the third data release of KiDS (KiDS-DR3; de Jong et al. 2017) that was based on ∼450 deg 2 and was used for previous KiDS cosmology analyses (Hildebrandt et al. 2020, hereafter H20).The KiDS-1000 catalogues used here are based on the fourth data release of KiDS (DR4; Kuijken et al. 2019), which includes near-infrared (NIR) photometry based on imaging from the fully overlapping VISTA Kilo degree INfrared Galaxy Survey (VIKING; Edge et al. 2013;Venemans et al. 2015).

This is the sample used for WL measurements and will be referred to as sources in the following. An in-depth description of a very similar sample of roughly half the size called KiDS+VIKING-450 (or KV450) and based on KiDS-DR3 can be found in Wright et al. (2019). There, the properties of the nine-band photo-z are described in detail and quantified by comparisons to deep spectroscopic redshift catalogues that overlap with KiDS. This information still applies to the KiDS-1000 data used here, as the depth and seeing distributions of KiDS-DR3 and KiDS-DR4 are extremely similar (see de Jong et al. 2017;Kuijken et al. 2019).

        <p>The deep spectroscopic sample for the colour-based calibration with the SOM technique (Sect. 3) did not change between DR3 and DR4. It consists of a diverse combination of data from the zCOSMOS (Lilly et al. 2007(Lilly et al. , 2009)), VVDS-Deep (VIMOS VLT Deep Survey;Le Fèvre et al. 2005, 2013, 2015), and DEEP2 (Newman et al. 2013) projects as well as some additional redshifts from the GAMA (Galaxy And Mass Assembly; Driver et al. 2011) deep field G15Deep (Kafle et al. 2018) and the CDFS (Chandra Deep Field South; ESO spec-z compilation consisting of spectra from Vanzella et al. 2008;Popesso et al. 2009;Balestra et al. 2010;Le Fèvre et al. 2013). The main properties of the samples are reported in Table 1 of W20a. All of these fields have been observed in the nine KiDS+VIKING bands to at least KiDS+VIKING depth, in some cases much deeper. The only exception is the COSMOS field that has no VISTA z-band data. However, it has very deep CFHT (Canada France Hawaii Telescope) z-band data (Hildebrandt et al. 2009), which, due to the similarity of the MegaCam@CFHT z-band and the VIRCAM@VISTA z-band, can be used as a substitute. In cases where the imaging data in the deep redshift calibration fields is deeper than in KiDS+VIKING, we added Gaussian noise to arrive at a data set that is representative for KiDS+VIKING. In principle, one could also make use of deeper data in the calibration fields and improve the precision of the calibration for instance as described by Buchs et al. (2019), but we leave such an enhancement of the KiDS+VIKING redshift calibration to future work.The deep spectroscopic sample for the colour-based calibration with the SOM technique (Sect. 3) did not change between DR3 and DR4.

The main properties of the samples are reported in Table 1 of W20a. All of these fields have been observed in the nine KiDS+VIKING bands to at least KiDS+VIKING depth, in some cases much deeper. The only exception is the COSMOS field that has no VISTA z-band data. However, it has very deep CFHT (Canada France Hawaii Telescope) z-band data (Hildebrandt et al. 2009), which, due to the similarity of the MegaCam@CFHT z-band and the VIRCAM@VISTA z-band, can be used as a substitute. In cases where the imaging data in the deep redshift calibration fields is deeper than in KiDS+VIKING, we added Gaussian noise to arrive at a data set that is representative for KiDS+VIKING. In principle, one could also make use of deeper data in the calibration fields and improve the precision of the calibration for instance as described by Buchs et al. (2019), but we leave such an enhancement of the KiDS+VIKING redshift calibration to future work.</p>
        <p>In H20, clustering-z (CZ)1 were estimated with the help of specz data from the wide-area surveys GAMA-DR3 (Baldry et al. 2018), SDSS-DR12 (Eisenstein et al. 2011;Alam et al. 2015), 2dFLenS (Blake et al. 2016), and WiggleZ (Drinkwater et al. 2010) and complemented with information about the highredshift part of the n(z) from zCOSMOS, VVDS-Deep, and DEEP2. The same samples are employed here but with some significant changes, the most important one being approximately a doubling in the size of the overlap area between KiDS+VIKING and SDSS in the Northern Hemisphere as well as between KiDS+VIKING and 2dFLenS in the Southern Hemisphere. This alone significantly increases the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the CZ measurements as described in Sect. 4. Additionally, we have relaxed some of the very conservative masking in previous KiDS CZ analyses.In H20, clustering-z (CZ)1 were estimated with the help of specz data from the wide-area surveys GAMA-DR3 (Baldry et al. 2018), SDSS-DR12 (Eisenstein et al. 2011;Alam et al. 2015), 2dFLenS (Blake et al. 2016), and WiggleZ (Drinkwater et al. 2010) and complemented with information about the highredshift part of the n(z) from zCOSMOS, VVDS-Deep, and DEEP2.

        <p>From the SDSS spec-z compilation we only use sources observed as part of BOSS (Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey; Dawson et al. 2013) unlike in previous KiDS work where also the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample (MGS; Strauss et al. 2002) and the SDSS Quasar Sample (Schneider et al. 2010) were used. The reason behind this decision is the desire to minimise systematic errors through the correction for evolving galaxy bias, which becomes more complicated when different samples are combined. At low redshift, we have very high S/N from GAMA already and do not need the limited additional information from the SDSS-MGS. While a higher S/N at high redshift would be desirable, the sparsity of the SDSS-QSO sample does not add any significant information and the results are almost indistinguishable whether it is included or not.From the SDSS spec-z compilation we only use sources observed as part of BOSS (Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey; Dawson et al. 2013) unlike in previous KiDS work where also the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample (MGS; Strauss et al. 2002) and the SDSS Quasar Sample (Schneider et al. 2010) were used.

        <p>The KiDS+VIKING redshift calibration is validated on simulated mock catalogues based on the 
            <rs type="software">MICE</rs> simulation (Fosalba et al. 2015a,b;Crocce et al. 2015;Carretero et al. 2015;Hoffmann et al. 2015). The creation and properties of these mock catalogues is covered in detail in van den Busch et al. (2020). The KiDS+VIKING nine-band photometry and the BPZ photo-z are simulated within these mocks, whereas the shape measurement weights are sampled from the real data by assigning each mock galaxy the weight of its nearest neighbour in the KiDS-1000 data in r-band magnitude. This results in a mock source catalogue that closely resembles the data. The most important difference is that 
            <rs type="software">MICE</rs> only provides mock galaxies out to z ∼ 1.4. Hence, we cannot test for possible high-z tails with the help of this mock, but we note that the core of the redshift distribution of each tomographic bin is well covered by these mocks.
        </p>
        <p>In a similar way, the spec-z calibration samples are simulated by applying the original (or in some cases slightly modified) selection criteria to the mock photometry and implementing realistic magnitude-and redshift-dependent spectroscopic success rates. For details, we refer the reader to van den Busch et al. (2020). We also create an idealised reference sample by taking every 10th KiDS mock source. This somewhat unrealistic case can be used to test the CZ methodology and explore the unavoidable systematic error floor inherent to our CZ implementation, agnostic to the complexities of reference sample construction.In a similar way, the spec-z calibration samples are simulated by applying the original (or in some cases slightly modified) selection criteria to the mock photometry and implementing realistic magnitude-and redshift-dependent spectroscopic success rates.

        <p>The mock catalogues for the CZ measurement are simply expanded in area compared to the ones in van den Busch et al. (2020) to account for the larger area of the KiDS-1000 source sample compared to KV450.

In particular for the deep fields, having such a large number of realisations makes it possible to estimate covariance matrices from the simulations that can be used to combine the results from the different surveys on the real data. One notable difference to the mock catalogues presented in van den Busch et al.

        <p>Photometric redshifts rely on the fact that galaxy colours strongly correlate with redshift. The same information is exploited in the calibration of redshift distributions for WL applications with the help of a deep spec-z reference sample. In essence, this is quite similar to the well-known category of ML photo-z, with the important difference that we want to apply this to a target ensemble of galaxies with unknown redshifts rather than to individual galaxies. Additionally, the goals of colourbased n(z) calibration are somewhat different from the goals of most ML photo-z codes, with the former being optimised towards low bias in the mean redshift and the latter often towards low scatter and low outlier rates.Photometric redshifts rely on the fact that galaxy colours strongly correlate with redshift.

        <p>The inherent differences between a spec-z calibration sample and a typical WL source sample can -under certain circumstances -be overcome by re-weighting. This re-weighting of the A124, page 4 of 14 calibration sample is supposed to make the distributions of relevant quantities as similar as possible between the two samples. Once this is achieved, it is assumed that the weighted distribution of spec-z in the calibration sample should be a good estimate of the unknown distribution of redshifts of the target source sample. It is clear that this works better the more spec-z are available, the more complementary information (e.g., number of photometric bands) is used to establish the weighting, and the closer the selection of the spec-z sample resembles the source sample to start with (Gruen &amp; Brimioulle 2017). Lima et al. (2008) suggest an approach that estimates the density of both samples in high-dimensional magnitude-space via a k-nearest-neighbour (kNN) method. The ratio of the densities in each point in magnitude-space is then used as a weight for the spec-z in that place. Essentially, spec-z that are underrepresented compared to the unknown target sample are up-weighted and spec-z that are over-represented are down-weighted. It can be shown on simulations (Lima et al. 2008;Wright et al. 2020a) that this approach yields good results if the magnitude-space is sufficiently high-dimensional, the photometry has high S/N, and the magnitude-space of the target sample is fully covered with spec-z calibrators.The inherent differences between a spec-z calibration sample and a typical WL source sample can -under certain circumstances -be overcome by re-weighting.

        <p>Whether the first two requirements are sufficiently met can realistically only be investigated with simulations.

        <p>W20a show that the SOM method can be used to actually carry out the estimation of the redshift distribution, n(z), without further need for the kNN method. Instead of estimating the densities of target and calibration sample at the location of each calibration source, the densities are estimated in each cell of the SOM. Moreover, the SOM gives the user a simple tool to cull from the target sample sources that are not represented by the spec-z calibration sample, that is sources that lie in cells that are not filled with at least one reference object. Each tomographic redshift bin is calibrated individually with a calibration sample that is limited to the same photo-z (z B ) range.

Given that the spec-z calibration sample is identical in both studies, the only difference is the larger (by a factor of ∼2) target catalogue with slightly updated absolute photometric calibration and updated lensfit weights (Giblin et al. 2021).

By applying the gold selection, roughly 20% of the effective source density is removed, which slightly increases the statistical noise (shape noise). Partly counteracting the decrease in n eff , however, is a small reduction in σ , which sets the noise level per source of WL measurements.We update the SOM analysis of W20a by populating the SOM with the new KiDS-1000 catalogues instead of the KV450 catalogues that were used in that paper.

        <p>In comparison to previous KiDS analyses, we have implemented a number of changes to the CZ methodology. Unlike Hildebrandt et al. (2017Hildebrandt et al. ( , 2020) ) we use an updated version of the angular cross-correlation code the-wizz (Morrison et al. 2017) called yet-another-wizz or yaw. We refer the reader to van den Busch et al. ( 2020) for a detailed description of the features of yaw. The main advantage of this new version is that it avoids the inherent sky pixelisation of the-wizz, which is inherited from the library 
            <rs type="software">STOMP</rs> (Scranton et al. 2002). This improvement yields more realistic uncertainties, especially for small angular scales that are often probed at high redshift for a given comoving scale.

        <p>The other update compared to van den Busch et al. ( 2020) and the CZ analysis in H20 concerns the covariance matrix of the CZ measurements. Due to the limited size of the reference samples all previous CZ analyses with KiDS estimated the covariance from a bootstrap or jackknife re-sampling over all (∼1 deg 2 ) pointings that went into the measurement. We will call this approach of estimating the covariance via bootstrap (A) in the following and use it by default.The other update compared to van den Busch et al.

        <p>Another general problem with this approach is that the shape of the DIR or SOM n(z) is not perfectly accurate, meaning their higher-order moments differ from the true redshift distribution. While the DIR n(z) are typically too broad, the opposite is true for the SOM n(z) that are typically slightly too narrow. These properties are revealed by the mock analysis of Wright et al. (2019). If the S/N of the CZ measurements changes significantly with redshift, such a bias in the shape of the model can lead to a bias in the mean redshift as estimated from the best-fit shift parameter δz CZ . This can be easily understood by imagining some CZ measurement for a tomographic bin, whose S/N is high on the low-z side of the peak and low on the high-z side. The fit of any model will be driven by the high S/N data points at low-z and influenced little by the low S/N data points at redshifts higher than the peak. If the model is too broad this will bias the inferred mean redshift high, if the model is too narrow the inferred mean redshift will be biased low.

        <p>In order to avoid such problems, one could add more parameters to the model that would account for this behaviour, for example by parametrically modifying the width. We investigate such more complex models and apply those to the KV450 data in Stölzner et al. (2020). Instead, we opt to not combine the CZ measurements from the wide-area and deep pencil-beam surveys, as was done before, because such a combination would exactly yield a strongly varying S/N over the peaks for the fourth and fifth tomographic bins (see Fig. 16 from van den Busch et al. 2020). We therefore use the wide-area surveys exclusively for the first three tomographic bins and the deep pencil-beam surveys for the fourth and fifth bin. This yields relatively symmetric S/N over the redshift range of the peak of each of these bins, and hence fortifies our results against this particular systematic effect. It also allows us to pick different scales over which we evaluate the correlation functions. We use scales of 100 kpc &lt; r &lt; 1 Mpc with a full bias correction (n CZ (z), Eq. ( 5)), for tomographic bins 1-3, and 30 kpc &lt; r &lt; 300 kpc with a correction for the bias of the reference sample only (ñ CZ (z), Eq. ( 4)), for tomographic bins 4 and 5. These choices are justified by the S/N in the different bins.

        <p>The model chosen here is quite inflexible. Thus, it cannot be expected to give a good fit (e.g., in terms of reduced χ 2 ) to the complex CZ data that are affected by residual galaxy bias, variable observing conditions, spectroscopic selection effects, etc., all of which are not modelled. Furthermore, the model itself, being based on the SOM method (Sect. 3), is noisy, which is not accounted for in our fit. Most importantly, its shape can be slightly different for systematic reasons or due to sample variance. This can be tested on the realistic mocks by using the true redshift distributions as a model. This yields a very good χ 2 arguing that a mismatch in the shape is the most important aspect driving the χ 2 high in realistic situations (see also van den Busch et al. 2020, for a discussion of the effect of the shape of the model). Instead of using only the (possibly unreliable) uncertainties of the best-fit parameters when fitting the SOM n(z) to the CZ data we opt to explore systematic errors by also estimating results for alternative choices of measurement scales, covariance determination, and galaxy bias removal.The model chosen here is quite inflexible.

        <p>Moving to the fiducial setup, with the first three tomographic bins being calibrated by CZ measurements on the wide-area surveys and the upper two tomographic bins being calibrated by the deep pencil-beam surveys, these numbers vary only very slightly, when the SOM n(z) from one representative line-of-sight (in terms of the mean redshifts of the five tomographic bins) are used as a model. The best-fit solutions and their respective best-fit parameters δz CZ i are reported in Fig. 4 and Table 3 (Col. 3). Only bin 4 shows a somewhat larger bias of δz CZ 4 ∼ 0.015, indicating that the CZ prefers a slightly lower mean redshift than the SOM estimate (in agreement with the value of ∆ z SOM in that bin). Fitting uncertainties are of the order σ(δz CZ i ) 0.003, but should not be taken at face value due to the limitations mentioned above.Moving to the fiducial setup, with the first three tomographic bins being calibrated by CZ measurements on the wide-area surveys and the upper two tomographic bins being calibrated by the deep pencil-beam surveys, these numbers vary only very slightly, when the SOM n(z) from one representative line-of-sight (in terms of the mean redshifts of the five tomographic bins) are used as a model.

        <p>As described, we explore some alternative scenarios to estimate robust systematic uncertainties for these shifts. The standard deviation between these scenarios ranges from σ syst. (δz CZ i ) = 0.004 for bins i ∈ (1, 2, 5) to σ syst. (δz CZ 4 ) = 0.024 for bin 4. This indicates that all shifts quoted above are consistent with zero.

        <p>As we are using the SOM redshift distributions from a single line-of-sight (see Fig. 1 for the differences in 100 lines-ofsight), it is clear that there is some residual sample variance that is not fully accounted for in either of the uncertainties quoted in Col. 3 of Table 3. We have, for now, ignored this effect. We do, however, propagate an estimate of the calibration uncertainty due to sample variance in our final CZ results for KiDS-1000 in Sect. 4.3.As we are using the SOM redshift distributions from a single line-of-sight (see Fig. 1 for the differences in 100 lines-ofsight), it is clear that there is some residual sample variance that is not fully accounted for in either of the uncertainties quoted in Col. 3 of Table 3.

        <p>Figure 4 highlights some of the problems encountered with the interpretation of CZ measurements. The uncertainty estimates for the upper two bins are quite noisy due to the small number of deep fields that contribute to the bootstrap resampling. Some of these data points clearly influence the fit but the δz CZ results suggest that this problem does not lead to an overall large bias. Moreover, the shape of the SOM redshift distributions is somewhat different than the shape suggested by the CZ data points. This mismatch will depend on the line-of-sight chosen for the SOM and highlights the limitations of our modelling. We take the pragmatic stance that, as long as the results for δz CZ indicate almost unbiased measurements, these limitations are unimportant for the conclusions drawn in this work.Figure 4 highlights some of the problems encountered with the interpretation of CZ measurements.

        <p>Having verified the methodology from Sect. 4.1 with the mock catalogues in Sect. 4.2, we finally apply the clustering-z technique to the KiDS-1000 data. Results for the fiducial setup are reported in Fig. 5 and Table 3. The best-fit shift parameters δz CZ are of the same order as in the simulated analysis, which increases our confidence in the realism of our mock catalogues. There are some subtle differences, such as the bias and systematic scatter in the third bin being slightly larger on the data than on the simulations, with the opposite behaviour in the fourth bin, but the details certainly depend on the line-of-sight chosen for the mocks. Overall the agreement is quite good. We note that there is some mismatch in the shape of the n(z) between the SOM and CZ data for some of the bins. We attribute this partly to sample variance as the SOM n(z) is based on a few linesof-sight (the deep fields) whereas the clustering-z are estimated from hundreds of square degrees.Having verified the methodology from Sect. 4.1 with the mock catalogues in Sect. 4.2, we finally apply the clustering-z technique to the KiDS-1000 data.

        <p>We propagate the uncertainty of the mean redshifts of the SOM n(z) into this estimate as we are essentially using a noisy model (the noise being a combination of statistical shot noise, cosmological sample variance, and some other contributions; see Wright et al. 2020a). We conservatively multiply this SOM uncertainty by a factor of two (Col. 2 of Table 3) to account for limitations in our MICE mocks, in particular the z &lt; 1.4 redshift limit. Then we add this inflated error and the other errors quoted in Col. 4 of Table 3 in quadrature to arrive at the combined uncertainty quoted in the last column.We propagate the uncertainty of the mean redshifts of the SOM n(z) into this estimate as we are essentially using a noisy model (the noise being a combination of statistical shot noise, cosmological sample variance, and some other contributions; see Wright et al. 2020a).

        <p>The primary calibration method to estimate redshift distributions for the KiDS-1000 cosmology analyses is based on the SOM method. This method projects the high-dimensional magnitude-space into two dimensions so that one can easily identify KiDS galaxies that are not represented by a reference sample. With the same spectroscopic calibration surveys used as a reference, this calibration is almost identical to the one presented in W20a, with the minor exception of updated lensfit shape measurement weights and photometric calibration in the current analysis. The accuracy estimates and systematic error discussion of W20a also hold for KiDS-1000 due to the similarity to the KiDS+VIKING-450 data set (Wright et al. 2019). We expect the gold samples defined by the SOM method to be A124, page 10 of 14 3. more robustly represented by their corresponding redshift distributions than the full samples used in H20 were represented by their DIR-estimated n(z). It should be noted that Wright et al. (2020b) showed that cosmological conclusions, in particular the tension w.r.t. Planck, are not strongly affected by this switch in the redshift calibration, while the use of SOM calibration in the KiDS-1000 analyses reduces the redshift calibration systematic uncertainties (compared to the DIR). This represents an important step for systematic error control to keep pace with the growing statistical power of WL surveys.The primary calibration method to estimate redshift distributions for the KiDS-1000 cosmology analyses is based on the SOM method.

        <p>Clustering redshifts (CZ) are used as a validation technique for the SOM n(z) in this paper. With unprecedented overlap with spectroscopic surveys over hundreds of square degrees containing more than 300 000 spectroscopic reference objects, we estimate precise CZ for the KiDS-1000 tomographic redshift bins. The wide-area spec-z reference samples GAMA, BOSS, 2dFLenS, and WiggleZ are used to estimate CZ for the first three tomographic bins with a photo-z range of 0.1 &lt; z B ≤ 0.7, whereas the deep pencil-beam surveys zCOSMOS, DEEP2, and VVDS are used for the two high-redshift bins (0.7 &lt; z B ≤ 1.2). This yields a homogeneous S/N of cross-correlation amplitudes as a function of redshift, which is important for the unbiased interpretation of the results.Clustering redshifts (CZ) are used as a validation technique for the SOM n(z) in this paper.

        <p>The same analysis is replicated on mock catalogues based on the MICE simulation to identify and estimate systematic uncertainties (with the caveat that mock galaxies are only available for z &lt; 1.4). Using the SOM n(z) as a model we fit for residual biases in these primary estimates of the KiDS-1000 redshifts. We find no significant bias in any of the five tomographic bins, neither in the simulated analysis nor on the real KiDS data. The combined uncertainties that are associated with this validation method are at most a factor ∼2 larger than the ones estimated for the SOM. As these numbers include the SOM uncertainty (the SOM n(z) are used as a model after all), the CZ method is shown to be fully competitive here.The same analysis is replicated on mock catalogues based on the MICE simulation to identify and estimate systematic uncertainties (with the caveat that mock galaxies are only available for z &lt; 1.4).

        <p>The most important systematic errors to account for in a CZ analysis are the evolution of the galaxy bias, the non-trivial combination of surveys with different redshift range, density, spatial overlap, and -connected to this -model bias from the interpretation of the results with an imperfect model.

        <p>The work presented here indicates a clear way forward to reach the stringent requirements of stage-IV WL surveys like Euclid (Laureijs et al. 2011), LSST (Ivezić et al. 2019), and RST (Spergel et al. 2015). Given sufficient deep, multi-band photometry, the SOM method allows for a robust gold selection whose accuracy is ultimately only limited by shot noise and competing requirements on the number density of the gold samples. Spectroscopic campaigns like the C3R2 (Masters et al. 2017(Masters et al. , 2019; Euclid Collaboration 2020) will push the envelope and allow for increasingly inclusive gold selections with the SOM at furtherreduced uncertainties in the redshift distributions.The work presented here indicates a clear way forward to reach the stringent requirements of stage-IV WL surveys like Euclid (Laureijs et al. 2011), LSST (Ivezić et al. 2019), and RST (Spergel et al. 2015).

        <p>An interesting addition to these purely spectroscopic approaches to colour-based calibration is offered by the inclusion of high-quality photo-z, not as the single calibration source but as a complement to the spectroscopic calibration data already present in the SOM. Multi-wavelength campaigns like the ones in COSMOS (Ilbert et al. 2009(Ilbert et al. , 2013;;Laigle et al. 2016) can yield exquisite redshift estimates with close to spectroscopic quality but without the drawback of incompleteness. Even better precision can be obtained from intermediate-or narrow-band surveys such as PAUS (Padilla et al. 2019;Eriksen et al. 2019) and J-PAS (Benitez et al. 2014), at least at brighter magnitudes. A smart combination of these surveys with the more traditional spectroscopic reference samples in a colour-based calibration like the SOM will mitigate the individual weaknesses of these catalogues and leverage their complementary advantages.An interesting addition to these purely spectroscopic approaches to colour-based calibration is offered by the inclusion of high-quality photo-z, not as the single calibration source but as a complement to the spectroscopic calibration data already present in the SOM.

        <p>The future of the CZ technique looks similarly bright. Most of the limiting systematic effects seem to be understood by now and mitigation techniques have been established. The interpretation with a suitable model and subsequent estimation of realistic uncertainties is currently the biggest methodological problem to overcome. On the data side, the redshift range covered by wide-area surveys is still not sufficient to leverage the full potential of CZ. Currently, only the cores of the redshift distributions of typical weak lensing source samples can be calibrated with CZ. But with the advent of new spectroscopic facilities like DESI5 (DESI Collaboration 2016), 4MOST6 (Richard et al. 2019), WEAVE7 (Dalton 2016), and PFS8 (Takada et al. 2014) this situation will improve and the crucial calibration of highredshift tails will become possible at high precision.The future of the CZ technique looks similarly bright.

        <p>All of these data-related efforts need to be accompanied by improved mock catalogues and better theoretical understanding. In terms of mocks, larger volumes, higher redshifts, even more realistic galaxy colours, and a realistic integration of galaxy colours and shapes is needed. On the theoretical side, the standard practice in the analysis of weak lensing surveys regards the work presented here as calibration steps that are carried out before the main cosmological inference. In the future, this clear distinction could be broken up, with parts or all of this calibration being integrated into the inference pipeline itself (Bernstein 2009). This is more obvious for CZ, which represents "just another two-point function" to model and fit, but such an integration can also be imagined for the colour-based calibration approach. While systematic error control is an issue in such integrated approaches, the optimal use of information in the data for example through Bayesian-hierarchical modelling (Sánchez &amp; Bernstein 2019;Alarcon et al. 2020) makes this idea extremely attractive for established methods that have left the exploratory stage.All of these data-related efforts need to be accompanied by improved mock catalogues and better theoretical understanding.

        <p>Here we illustrate with a simple toy model how variable S/N can bias a model fit. This situation is quite common in clustering-z measurements that typically exhibit a large number of reference galaxies at low redshift and a small number at high redshift due to the difficulties of measuring redshifts for high-z galaxies.Here we illustrate with a simple toy model how variable S/N can bias a model fit.

        <p>In This observation led to our decision to analyse the clusteringz of the wide and deep fields separately. The number of reference galaxies in the two sets is just too different so that a sharp drop in S/N is observed at the transition redshift (z ∼ 0.8). Analysing the wide and deep fields together and using the SOM (DIR) n(z), whose widths are typically to small (large), would result in a similar model bias as shown in One alternative would be to randomly subsample the Wide data to homogenise the S/N. We leave this idea to future work. Top: black data points correspond to one noise realisation with decreasing S/N. The blue lines correspond to fits with a model of perfect width whereas the teal and orange lines correspond to models that are to narrow and the magenta and green lines correspond to models that are too wide. Bottom: if the model has the correct width the mean of the best fit is on average unbiased (blue) whereas it is on average biased low if the model is too narrow (teal and orange) and biased high if the model is too broad (magenta and green).In This observation led to our decision to analyse the clusteringz of the wide and deep fields separately. The number of reference galaxies in the two sets is just too different so that a sharp drop in S/N is observed at the transition redshift (z ∼ 0.8). Analysing the wide and deep fields together and using the SOM (DIR) n(z), whose widths are typically to small (large), would result in a similar model bias as shown in One alternative would be to randomly subsample the Wide data to homogenise the S/N. We leave this idea to future work. Top: black data points correspond to one noise realisation with decreasing S/N. The blue lines correspond to fits with a model of perfect width whereas the teal and orange lines correspond to models that are to narrow and the magenta and green lines correspond to models that are too wide. Bottom: if the model has the correct width the mean of the best fit is on average unbiased (blue) whereas it is on average biased low if the model is too narrow (teal and orange) and biased high if the model is too broad (magenta and green).</p>
