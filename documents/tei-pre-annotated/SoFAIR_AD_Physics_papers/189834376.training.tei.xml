        <p>Polar molecules offer a new platform for quantum simulation of systems with long-range interactions, based on the electrostatic interaction between their electric dipole moments. Here, we report the development of coherent quantum state control using microwave fields in 40 Ca 19 F and 87 Rb 133 Cs molecules, a crucial ingredient for many quantum simulation applications. We perform Ramsey interferometry measurements with fringe spacings of ∼1 kHz and investigate the dephasing time of a superposition of N=0 and N=1 rotational states when the molecules are confined. For both molecules, we show that a judicious choice of molecular hyperfine states minimises the impact of spatially varying transition-frequency shifts across the trap. For magnetically trapped 40 Ca 19 F we use a magnetically insensitive transition and observe a coherence time of 0.61(3)ms. For optically trapped 87 Rb 133 Cs we exploit an avoided crossing in the AC Stark shifts and observe a maximum coherence time of 0.75(6)ms. Since Lloyd's proof that evolving a controllable quantum system in small time steps can allow efficient simulation of any quantum many-body Hamiltonian [1], the field of quantum simulation has grown enormously. This growth has been driven by the prospect of understanding complex physical systems, such as high-temperature superconductors [2, 3] or warm, dense nuclear matter [4]. In this context, the role of the quantum simulator is to implement a model of a physical system, and to measure observables that can be compared to real systems of interest [5]. Currently, a number of experimental platforms are under exploration, each in essence attempting to address Cirac and Zoller's criteria to qualify as a quantum simulator [6] through different paths [7][8][9].Polar molecules offer a new platform for quantum simulation of systems with long-range interactions, based on the electrostatic interaction between their electric dipole moments.

        <p>Trapped ions are the best-established candidate system for quantum simulation [10]. They offer exceptional quantum control over small numbers of ions with high-fidelity gate operations [11]. Ongoing efforts are aimed at scaling up to larger numbers of ions. In the short term, very good control is probably achievable for 10-20 ions [12], and less perfect control for up to 50 ions. Scaling up to much larger numbers is a challenging goal that will probably require new ideas. In contrast, superconducting circuits have recently made considerable progress as an alternative platform [13]. Here, the superconducting qubits and qubit gates are of lower fidelity, but scaling up to larger systems is easier and integration with other existing electronic technology is relatively straightforward.Trapped ions are the best-established candidate system for quantum simulation [10].

        <p>Quantum simulation with ultracold atoms in optical lattices [14,15] has offered some ground-breaking results, such as the recent observation of magnetic correlations in experiments implementing the twodimensional (2D) Hubbard model [16][17][18]. These experiments prepare a large number of atoms in a wellcontrolled initial state. Gate operations are highly parallelisable, so this approach is suitable for quantum simulation of model Hamiltonians that do not require spatially varying operations. Indeed, it has frequently been difficult to address individual atoms, although the development of the quantum gas microscope [19][20][21] and tweezer arrays [22][23][24] represent important breakthroughs in this respect. Gate operations are relatively slow, governed by trap frequencies and tunnelling rates on the order of Hz to kHz [25]. Moreover, interactions between ground-state alkali-metal atoms are short-ranged, which makes them suitable to model local interactions only. This last point has prompted growing interest in long-range dipolar interactions, which may be implemented in atomic systems either by using highly magnetic atoms [26][27][28][29][30][31] or by exciting atoms to Rydberg states [9,[32][33][34].Quantum simulation with ultracold atoms in optical lattices [14,15] has offered some ground-breaking results, such as the recent observation of magnetic correlations in experiments implementing the twodimensional (2D) Hubbard model [16][17][18].

        <p>Ultracold polar molecules offer new possibilities for quantum simulation. The electric dipole moments of polar molecules give rise to interactions that are significantly greater than those between magnetic atoms. Although interactions between Rydberg states are even stronger, ground-state polar molecules have longer lifetimes. Molecules also possess a rich internal structure, with vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom, in addition to electronic and hyperfine structure. The rotational structure is of particular importance in the context of quantum simulation, providing a rich basis in which to encode pseudo-spins that can be easily manipulated with microwave fields. Moreover, the electric dipole coupling between rotational states allows tunable longrange interactions to be engineered between the encoded spins. These properties have inspired numerous proposed applications in quantum magnetism, the study of the many-body physics of coupled spins [35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43]. Finally, the enormous range of molecular species allows selection of molecular properties to match the application. For example, molecules with no electronic spin or orbital angular momentum possess only an electric dipole moment, whereas those with an unpaired spin may have both electric and magnetic dipole moments. Beyond the field of quantum simulation, ultracold molecules also have potential applications in the study of quantum-controlled chemistry [44][45][46][47], quantum information processing [48] and precision measurement [49][50][51][52] .Ultracold polar molecules offer new possibilities for quantum simulation.

        <p>There has been considerable success in producing a growing number of ultracold molecular species, both through the association of atoms in ultracold atomic gases and more recently by direct laser cooling of molecules. The most successful association method to date has employed magnetoassociation on a zero-energy Feshbach resonance [53,54] followed by optical transfer using stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) [55] to produce molecules in the rovibronic ground state. This approach has been employed extensively to associate pairs of ultracold alkali-metal atoms, where the ability to cool the atomic gases to quantum degeneracy leads to molecular gases at high phase-space density and typical temperatures of ∼1 μK or below. Ultracold ground-state KRb [56], Cs 2 [57], Rb 2 [58], RbCs [59,60], NaK [61,62], NaRb [63] and NaLi [64] molecules have all been created. A new wave of experiments aims to extend this approach to molecules with doublet ground states, by associating atoms in mixtures of alkali-metal and closed-shell atoms [65][66][67]. A new technique that is advancing very rapidly is direct laser cooling of molecules. Although their complex level structure makes molecules difficult to cool, there are many molecules that have almost-closed electronic transitions suitable for laser cooling. So far, laser cooling has been demonstrated for SrF [68][69][70][71], YO [72], CaF [73][74][75], YbF [76] and SrOH [77]. Cooling of several other species is also being pursued, including BaF [78], BaH [79] and TlF [80]. Recent advances have led to laser cooling of molecules to sub-Doppler temperatures [74], and transfer of these ultracold molecules into magnetic and optical traps [81][82][83]. Direct cooling into the microkelvin regime has also been demonstrated by optoelectrical Sisyphus cooling [84]. With such remarkable and rapid progress, we can expect the control of ultracold molecules soon to develop to the level required for proof-of-principle quantum simulation.There has been considerable success in producing a growing number of ultracold molecular species, both through the association of atoms in ultracold atomic gases and more recently by direct laser cooling of molecules.

        <p>In this paper we explore the potential of ultracold molecules for quantum simulation. We focus on two contrasting molecular species, 40 Ca 19 F and 87 Rb 133 Cs, hereafter referred to simply as CaF and RbCs. In section 1 we describe the properties of molecules that make them suited to applications in quantum simulation, focussing on the role of the molecular rotation. In section 2 we describe the rotational and hyperfine structure of CaF and RbCs, which are important for internal state control using microwave fields. In section 3 we report Ramsey interferometry measurements and investigate the coherence time of a superposition of ground and excited rotational states when the molecules are confined. For both molecules, we show that a judicious choice of molecular hyperfine states minimises the impact of spatially varying shifts in transition frequencies across the trap, providing a route to long interrogation and control times in future experiments. Finally, we outline our plans for loading, addressing and detecting individual molecules in ordered arrays; this is the next major challenge in the development of molecules for quantum simulation.In this paper we explore the potential of ultracold molecules for quantum simulation.

        <p>In this section we introduce the distinctive properties of polar molecules that make them an attractive platform for quantum simulation. We motivate our study of rotational coherence by illustrating how the rotational degrees of freedom can be used to encode models of quantum magnetism. We limit our discussion to the simple case of diatomic polar molecules in their electronic ground state, pinned on the sites of an optical lattice or tweezer array such that motion and tunnelling between sites can be neglected. Extensions beyond this simple scenario to include, for example, different trapping geometries, tunnelling between lattice sites, disordered filling, and greater molecular complexity, lead to even richer physics [85][86][87] but are beyond the scope of this paper.In this section we introduce the distinctive properties of polar molecules that make them an attractive platform for quantum simulation.

        <p>Diatomic molecules feature two new degrees of freedom compared to atoms: vibrations, corresponding to the variation of the distance, R, between the constituent nuclei, and characterised by a vibrational quantum number v=0, 1, 2, K; and rotations of the molecule about the axis perpendicular to the internuclear separation vector. These are described by a rotational quantum number, N=0, 1, 2, K, and its projection on the laboratory quantisation axis, M N [88]. The typical energy scale associated with vibrations is 50K or more; the ultracold molecules we consider are in a single vibrational state, and we focus on the rotational degree of freedom. The energies of the rotational states are approximately E B N N 1  ´ and the rotational states can be conveniently manipulated with microwave fields. Molecules also possess rich hyperfine structure, as discussed in section 2, but this complication does not preclude the use of rotational states for quantum simulation.Diatomic molecules feature two new degrees of freedom compared to atoms: vibrations, corresponding to the variation of the distance, R, between the constituent nuclei, and characterised by a vibrational quantum number v=0, 1, 2, K; and rotations of the molecule about the axis perpendicular to the internuclear separation vector.

        <p>Understanding the AC Stark effect is vital to implementing internal-state microwave control for polar molecules confined in an optical trap. For RbCs, we have previously measured the scalar and tensor parts of the AC polarisability, α (0) and α (2) , for linearly polarised light at a wavelength of 1550 nm, and investigated the effect of varying the angle between the polarisation of the light and the applied magnetic field [104]. We showed that coupling between neighbouring hyperfine states manifests in a rich and highly complicated structure with many avoided crossings. In addition, we found that the energy structure is simplest when the polarisation of the light is parallel to the direction of the magnetic field, as this avoids competition between magnetic and electric quantisation axes; this is the case shown in figure 3(b) and used in this work.Understanding the AC Stark effect is vital to implementing internal-state microwave control for polar molecules confined in an optical trap.

Here, the initial atomic gases can be cooled to quantum degeneracy and efficiently loaded into the lattice in a Mott insulator (MI) state [120,121] such that two atoms reside in each site prior to association [122][123][124][125][126]. This approach greatly increases the efficiency of the magnetoassociation step to close to unity [127,128], as well as producing molecules in an ordered array. However, in two-species experiments, achieving a filling fraction of heteronuclear atom pairs is difficult and requires careful control of both the intraspecies and interspecies interactions. Nevertheless, molecular filling fractions of up to ∼30% in 3D lattices have been demonstrated for both ground-state KRb molecules [124] and RbCs Feshbach molecules [126]. At such fillings, coherent many-body effects due to the long-range DDI are predicted to be observable [129]. In both these experiments, interspecies Feshbach resonances are exploited to enhance the miscibility of the atomic mixture. However, this can introduce high inelastic losses for one of the species. Fortunately the MI phase can also be used to protect against such inelastic collisions. For example, Cs suffers from high 3-body loss rates at most magnetic fields, but by first loading the atoms into a MI state with one atom per lattice site at a magnetic field with favourable intraspecies interactions, the atoms can be protected against collisions when moving to a magnetic field with favourable interspecies interactions [126]. Further exploiting the advanced control techniques developed for atomic gases, for example by using species-specific optical potentials [130], it should be possible to create molecules in optical lattices with even higher filling factors. Accurate site-resolved detection and addressing of individual molecules in an optical lattice presents additional challenges. In the atomic quantum gas microscopes, a lens with a high numerical aperture (NA) is used to collect scattered photons as the atoms are laser-cooled in a very deep optical lattice [19][20][21]. The small depth of field allows site-resolved imaging only of a single plane of atoms, although sequential readout has been employed to study a bilayer system [131]. It is important to note that atoms are detected only on sites with an odd number of atoms; light-assisted inelastic collisions lead to rapid loss of both atoms on doubly occupied sites. This parity detection has led to striking images of the Mott-insulator transition [132]. For molecules produced by association, detection usually involves reversing the association process and detecting the constituent atoms, although direct absorption imaging has been demonstrated [133]. In a lattice, reversing the association will inevitably lead to two atoms on each site. To implement site-resolved imaging, either the atoms must be separated using species-specific optical potentials [130] or one species must be removed, for example by using a short pulse of blue-detuned light. Addressing of individual molecules can be achieved by focusing light onto a specific lattice site using the same high-NA lens used for imaging. The resulting AC Stark shift, experienced only by the molecule on the chosen site, allows a microwave field to address just a single molecule. The desire to manipulate molecules with electric fields imposes additional constraints on the microscope, as the inclusion of electrodes forces the use of lenses with longer working distances. However, several designs have been proposed to ensure that the electric field is uniform across the lattice whilst keeping the electrode structure sufficiently compact [134,135].) , where 2 l is the lattice spacing.

        <p>The direct loading of an optical lattice is appealing when associating atoms to form molecules, as the production of high-phase-space density samples of many atomic species is well understood. However, a variety of interesting experiments could be done with smaller arrays using tweezer traps, which may be loaded from lower-density sources. A tweezer trap is a tightly focussed far-detuned laser beam that can confine a single atom. When loaded from a MOT or molasses, the occupancy of the trap is always zero or one, because two atoms in the same trap undergo a fast light-assisted collision involving the laser-cooling light that ejects both [136]. Multiple tweezer traps can be loaded stochastically, and then re-arranged to make regular, defect-free 1D, 2D or even 3D arrays [24,[137][138][139]. Exciting the atoms to Rydberg states introduces strong, controllable interactions between them, and the many-body quantum dynamics of a linear array of such atoms has recently been studied [140].The direct loading of an optical lattice is appealing when associating atoms to form molecules, as the production of high-phase-space density samples of many atomic species is well understood.

        <p>The same techniques could be used to make arrays of ultracold molecules with DDIs. Molecules could be loaded into tweezer traps directly from a MOT or molasses; the phase-space density reached with laser-cooled molecules is already high enough for efficient loading. Alternatively, molecules could be formed by associating pairs of atoms pre-loaded into the same tweezer [141]. These are attractive approaches to quantum simulation and quantum-information processing with molecules. The arrays are easily reconfigured, so various geometries and molecule spacings can be explored. Molecules can be brought together to interact at a fixed spacing for a known time, then separated again to turn off the interaction and read out the final state of each.The same techniques could be used to make arrays of ultracold molecules with DDIs.

        <p>Atoms in tweezer traps have been cooled to the motional ground state by Raman sideband cooling [142,143]. The cooling proceeds by driving a Raman transition from i n , ñ | to j n , 1 -ñ | , followed by optical pumping back to i n , 1 -ñ | .

        <p>| which is dark to both the Raman and optical pumping steps. It is desirable to cool molecules in the same way; for CaF, both the optical pumping and Raman steps can in principle be done using one of the laser-cooling transitions. However, because of the tensor nature of the polarizability, the AC Stark shift is different for each rotational, hyperfine and Zeeman sub-level. The resulting state-dependent trapping potential brings several complications. The trap frequency will, in general, be different for states iñ | and jñ | , which means that the frequency of the Raman transition depends on n, whose value is unknown when the cooling begins. The usual theory used to find the relative strengths of transitions between motional states n and m, involving an expansion in the Lamb-Dicke parameter, no longer applies because the states i n , ñ | and j m , ñ | are not orthogonal. Instead, Franck-Condon factors between these states determine the transition strengths. The spatially varying elliptical polarization of the light around the focus of the tweezer, resulting from the breakdown of the paraxial approximation, adds further complexity [143]. Statedependent potentials can also result in rapid dephasing of the coherences needed for quantum simulation, as explored in section 3. However, these challenges also bring new opportunities. For example, with statedependent potentials, efficient sideband cooling to the motional ground state could be done using microwave transitions between rotational states, instead of Raman transitions [144].

        <p>Ultracold molecules offer a variety of new possibilities for quantum simulation, but the development of experiments presents a number of key challenges. We have presented our progress towards overcoming these challenges to develop a platform on which to build future quantum simulation experiments. The molecules used in this work, CaF and RbCs, are produced in very different ways, using two of the most successful approaches in the field, laser cooling and magnetoassociation. We have described in detail the hyperfine and rotational structure of each molecule, highlighting their differences and similarities. We have demonstrated Ramsey spectroscopy of the rotational transition N N 0 1 = « = for free-space and trapped samples in each experiment. In the case of trapped samples, we find that the main decoherence mechanism is dephasing due to spatially varying Zeeman shifts for magnetically trapped CaF or AC Stark shifts for optically trapped RbCs. For both molecules, we find that the choice of hyperfine states is critical to maximise the coherence time. Future experiments will focus on the loading of molecules into arrays, either by direct loading into optical lattices, or by building smaller arrays of tweezer traps. This will open the door to a number of realisable quantum simulation experiments.Ultracold molecules offer a variety of new possibilities for quantum simulation, but the development of experiments presents a number of key challenges.
