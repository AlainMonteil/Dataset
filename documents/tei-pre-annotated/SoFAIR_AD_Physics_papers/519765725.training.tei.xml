        <p>. The first binary neutron star (BNS) coalescence signal, GW170817, was discovered during the second of these observing campaigns (Abbott et al. 2017a(Abbott et al. , 2019b)). It proved to be a multmessenger source with emission across the electromagnetic spectrum (Abbott et al. 2017b), with implications for the origin of short gamma-ray bursts (Abbott et al. 2017c), the formation of heavy elements (Abbott et al. 2017d;Chornock et al. 2017;Tanvir et al. 2017;Rosswog et al. 2018;Kasliwal et al. 2019;Watson et al. 2019), cosmology (Abbott et al. 2017e, 2019c), and fundamental physics (Abbott et al. 2017c(Abbott et al. , 2019d))..

        <p>The first six months of the third observing run (O3) were completed between 2019 April 1 and September 30. The LVC recently reported on the discovery of GW190425, the coalescence signal of what is most likely a BNS with unusually large chirp mass and total mass compared to the Galactic BNSs known from radio pulsar observations (Abbott et al. 2020a). Another discovery from O3 is that of GW190412, the first BBH coalescence with an unequivocally unequal mass ratio q=m 2 /m 1 of -+ 0.28 0.06 0.12 (all measurements are reported as symmetric 90% credible intervals around the median of the marginalized posterior distribution, unless otherwise specified). It is also the first event for which higher-multipole gravitational radiation was detected with high significance (Abbott et al. 2020d).The first six months of the third observing run (O3) were completed between 2019 April 1 and September 30.

        <p>Here we report on another O3 detection, GW190814, the signal of a compact binary coalescence with the most unequal mass ratio yet measured with gravitational waves: q= -+ 0.112 0.009 0.008 . The signal was first identified in data from two detectors, LIGO Livingston and Virgo, on 2019 August 14, 21:11:00 UTC.

The lack of measurable tidal deformations and the absence of an electromagnetic counterpart are consistent with either a neutron star (NS) or a BH given the event's asymmetric masses and distance of -+ 241 45 41 Mpc. However, we show here that comparisons with the maximum NS mass predicted by studies of GW170817ʼs remnant, by current knowledge of the NS equation of state, and by electromagnetic observations of NSs in binary systems indicate that the secondary is likely too heavy to be an NS. Either way, this is an unprecedented source because the secondary's well-constrained mass of 2.50-2.67 M e makes it either the lightest BH or the heaviest NS ever observed in a double compact-object system.1.1 M e .

        <p>As in the case of GW190412, we are able to measure the presence of higher multipoles in the gravitational radiation, and a set of tests of general relativity with the signal reveal no deviations from the theory. Treating this event as a new class of compact binary coalescences, we estimate a merger rate density of 1-23 Gpc -3 yr -1 for GW190814-like events. Forming coalescing compact binaries with this unusual combination of masses at such a rate challenges our current understanding of astrophysical models.As in the case of GW190412, we are able to measure the presence of higher multipoles in the gravitational radiation, and a set of tests of general relativity with the signal reveal no deviations from the theory.

        <p>At the time of GW190814, LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston,and Virgo were operating with typical O3 sensitivities (Abbott et al. 2020a). Although LIGO Hanford was in a stable operating configuration at the time of GW190814, the detector was not in observing mode due to a routine procedure to minimize angular noise coupling to the strain measurement (Kasprzack &amp; Yu 2017). This same procedure took place at LIGO Hanford around the time of GW170608; we refer the reader to Abbott et al. (2017f) for details of this procedure. Within a 5 minute window around GW190814, this procedure was not taking place; therefore, LIGO Hanford data for GW190814 are usable in the nominal range of analyzed frequencies. A time-frequency representation (Chatterji et al. 2004) of the data from all three detectors around the time of the signal is shown in Figure 1.At the time of GW190814, LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston,and Virgo were operating with typical O3 sensitivities (Abbott et al. 2020a).

        <p>We used validation procedures similar to those used to vet previous gravitational-wave events (Abbott et al. 2016c(Abbott et al. , 2019a)). Overall we found no evidence that instrumental or environmental disturbances (Effler et al. 2015) could account for GW190814. However, we did identify low-frequency transient noise due to scattered light at LIGO Livingston, a common source of noise in (Chatterji et al. 2004) of data containing GW190814, observed by LIGO Hanford (top), LIGO Livingston (middle), and Virgo (bottom). Times are shown relative to 2019 August 14, 21:10:39 UTC. Each detector's data are whitened by their respective noise amplitude spectral density and a Q-transform is calculated. The colorbar displays the normalized energy reported by the Q-transform at each frequency.

Scattered light features in the strain data are produced when a small fraction of the main laser beam reflects off a moving surface and is phase modulated before recombining with the main beam. This recombination can result in excess noise with the morphology of arches in the time-frequency plane; the frequency of this noise is determined by the velocity of the moving surface (Accadia et al. 2010). Thunderstorms near LIGO Livingston around the time of GW190814 resulted in acoustic noise coupling to the detector and caused features in the strain data associated with scattered light (Abbott et al. 2019a). In this instance, this form of noise affects frequencies up to 30 Hz from roughly 22 s to 8 s before and 0.2 s to 1.5 s after the detected time of GW190814, as seen in the middle panel of Figure 1. Since this noise could bias the estimation of GW190814ʼs source parameters, we used a starting frequency of 30 Hz to analyze LIGO Livingston data.

The event was initially classified as "MassGap" (Kapadia et al. 2020;LIGO Scientific Collaboration &amp; Virgo Collaboration 2019b), implying that at least one of the binary merger components was found to have a mass between 3 and 5 M e in the low-latency analyses.GW190814 was first identified on 2019 August 14, 21:11:00 UTC as a loud two-detector event in LIGO Livingston and Virgo data (S/N 21.4 and 4.3) by the low-latency GSTLAL matchedfiltering search pipeline for coalescing binaries (Cannon et al. 2012;Privitera et al. 2014;Messick et al. 2017;Sachdev et al. 2019;Hanna et al. 2020).

        </p>
        <p>Shortly thereafter, reanalyses including LIGO Hanford data were performed using GSTLAL and PYCBC. A coincident gravitational-wave signal was identified in all three detectors by both searches, with S/N 21.6 in LIGO Livingston, 10.6 in LIGO Hanford, and 4.5 in Virgo data (as measured by GSTLAL, consistent with S/Ns reported by PYCBC). Results of these three-detector analyses were reported in a GCN Circular within 2.3 hr of the time of the event(LIGO Scientific Collaboration &amp; Virgo Collaboration 2019c, 2019d), providing a three-detector localization (Singer &amp; Price 2016) constraining the distance to 220-330 Mpc and the sky area to 38 deg 2 at the 90% credible level. Another GCN Circular(LIGO Scientific Collaboration &amp; Virgo Collaboration 2019e) sent 13.5hours after the event updated the source localization to a distance of 215-320 Mpc, the sky area to 23 deg 2 , and the source classification to "NSBH" (Kapadia et al. 2020;LIGO Scientific Collaboration &amp; Virgo Collaboration 2019b), indicating that the secondary had a mass below 3 M e . These updated sky localizations are also shown in Figure 2. The two disjoint sky localizations arise because the low S/N in the Virgo detector (4.5) means that the data are consistent with two different signal arrival times in that detector.Shortly thereafter, reanalyses including LIGO Hanford data were performed using GSTLAL and PYCBC.

        <p>Several external groups performed multimessenger follow-up of the source with observations across the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., Dobie et al. 2019;Gomez et al. 2019;Lipunov et al. 2019;Ackley et al. 2020;Antier et al. 2020;Andreoni et al. 2020;Watson et al. 2020;Vieira et al. 2020) and with neutrino observations(e.g., Ageron et al. 2019;The IceCube Collaboration 2019). No counterpart candidates were reported. The nondetection is consistent with the source's highly unequal mass ratio and low primary spin (LIGO Scientific Collaboration &amp; Virgo Collaboration 2019d, 2019e;Fernández et al. 2020;Morgan et al. 2020). Tentative constraints placed by multimessenger studies on the properties of the system, such as the ejecta mass and maximum primary spin (Ackley et al. 2020;Andreoni et al. 2020;Coughlin et al. 2020;Kawaguchi et al. 2020) or the circum-merger density (Dobie et al. 2019) assuming (Singer &amp; Price 2016).

        <p>The significance of GW190814 was estimated by follow-up searches using improved calibration and refined data-quality information that are not available in low latency. They also used longer stretches of data for better precision (Abbott et al. 2016b(Abbott et al. , 2016c)). With LIGO Hanford data being usable but not in nominal observing mode at the time of GW190814, we used only data from the LIGO Livingston and Virgo detectors for significance estimation. GW190814 was identified as a confident detection in analyses of detector data collected over the period from 2019 August 7 to August 15 by the two independent matched-filtering searches GSTLAL and PYCBC, with S/N values consistent with the low-latency analyses. The production version of PYCBC for O3 estimates significance only for events that are coincident in the LIGO Hanford and LIGO Livingston detectors, and therefore an extended version (Davies et al. 2020) was used for GW190814 in order to enable the use of Virgo data in significance estimation.The significance of GW190814 was estimated by follow-up searches using improved calibration and refined data-quality information that are not available in low latency.

        <p>GSTLAL and PYCBC use different techniques for estimating the noise background and methods of ranking gravitational-wave candidates. Both use results from searches over non-timecoincident data to improve their noise background estimation (Privitera et al. 2014;Messick et al. 2017;Usman et al. 2016). Using data from the first six months of O3 and including all events during this period in the estimation of noise background, GSTLAL estimated a false-alarm rate (FAR) of 1 in 1.3×10 3 yr for GW190814. Using data from the 8 day period surrounding GW190814 and including this and all quieter events during this period in noise background estimation, the extended PYCBC pipeline (Davies et al. 2020) estimated an FAR for the event of 1 in 8.1yr. The higher FAR estimate from PYCBC can be attributed to the event being identified by the pipeline as being quieter than multiple noise events in Virgo data. As PYCBC estimates background statistics using noncoincident data from both detectors, these louder noise events in Virgo data can form chance coincidences with the signal in LIGO Livingston data and elevate the noise background estimate for coincident events, especially when considering shorter data periods. All estimated background events that were ranked higher than GW190814 by PYCBC were indeed confirmed to be coincidences of the candidate event itself in LIGO Livingston with random noise events in Virgo. The stated background estimates are therefore conservative (Capano et al. 2016a). We also estimate the background excluding the candidate from the calculation, a procedure that yields a mean-unbiased estimation of the distribution of noise events (Abbott et al. 2016d;Capano et al. 2016a). In this case, with GSTLAL we found an FAR of &lt;1 in 10 5 yr while with PYCBC we found an FAR of &lt;1 in 4.2×10 4 yr. With both pipelines identifying GW190814 as more significant than any event in the background, the FARs assigned are upper bounds.GSTLAL and PYCBC use different techniques for estimating the noise background and methods of ranking gravitational-wave candidates. Both use results from searches over non-timecoincident data to improve their noise background estimation (Privitera et al. 2014;Messick et al. 2017;Usman et al. 2016).

As PYCBC estimates background statistics using noncoincident data from both detectors, these louder noise events in Virgo data can form chance coincidences with the signal in LIGO Livingston data and elevate the noise background estimate for coincident events, especially when considering shorter data periods. All estimated background events that were ranked higher than GW190814 by PYCBC were indeed confirmed to be coincidences of the candidate event itself in LIGO Livingston with random noise events in Virgo. The stated background estimates are therefore conservative (Capano et al. 2016a). We also estimate the background excluding the candidate from the calculation, a procedure that yields a mean-unbiased estimation of the distribution of noise events (Abbott et al. 2016d;Capano et al. 2016a). In this case, with GSTLAL we found an FAR of &lt;1 in 10 5 yr while with PYCBC we found an FAR of &lt;1 in 4.2×10 4 yr. With both pipelines identifying GW190814 as more significant than any event in the background, the FARs assigned are upper bounds.</p>
        <p>When data from LIGO Hanford were included, GW190814 was also identified by the unmodeled coherent WaveBurst (CWB) search that targets generic gravitational-wave transients with increasing frequency over time without relying on waveform models (Klimenko et al. 2008(Klimenko et al. , 2016;;Abbott et al. 2016e). We found an FAR of &lt;1 in 10 3 yr of observing time against the noise background from LIGO Hanford and LIGO Livingston data, consistent with the other searches.When data from LIGO Hanford were included, GW190814 was also identified by the unmodeled coherent WaveBurst (CWB) search that targets generic gravitational-wave transients with increasing frequency over time without relying on waveform models (Klimenko et al. 2008(Klimenko et al. , 2016;;Abbott et al. 2016e).

        <p>We infer the physical properties of GW190814using a coherent Bayesian analysis of the data from LIGO Livingston, LIGO Hanford, and Virgo following the methodology described in Appendix B of Abbott et al.

We use a low-frequency cutoff of 20 Hz for LIGO Hanford and Virgo and 30 Hz for LIGO Livingston for the likelihood evaluations, and we choose uninformative and wide priors, as defined in Appendix B.1 of Abbott et al.

When sampling the parameter space with the SEOBNRV4_ROM_NRTIDALV2_NSBH(Matas et al. 2020) and IMRPHENOMNSBH (Thompson et al. 2020a) waveform models, we obtained posterior distributions for the secondary component's tidal deformability Λ 2 that are uninformative relative to a uniform prior in Λ 2 ä[0, 3000]. The absence of a measurable tidal signature is consistent with the highly unequal mass ratio (Foucart et al. 2013;Kumar et al. 2017) and with the relatively large secondary mass (Flanagan &amp; Hinderer 2008). The large asymmetry in the masses implies that the binary will merge before the neutron star is tidally disrupted for any expected NS equation of state (Foucart et al. 2013).

        <p>Finally, we perform two complementary analyses involving time-frequency tracks in the data to provide further evidence for the presence of higher multipoles in the signal. In the first approach(also outlined in Abbott et al. 2020d, Section 4) we predict the time-frequency track of the dominant (2, 2) multipole in the LIGO Livingston detector (as seen in Figure 1, middle panel) from an EOBNR HM parameter estimation analysis. This analysis collects energies along a time-frequency track that is α×f 22 (t), the (2, 2) multipole's instantaneous frequency, where α is a dimensionless para-meter (Roy et al. 2019b;Abbott et al. 2020d). We find prominent peaks in Y(α), the energy in the pixels along the α-th track defined in Abbott et al. (2020d), at α=1 and 1.5, as can be seen from the on-source curve in the top panel of Figure 7. These peaks correspond to the m=2 and m=3 multipole predictions in the data containing the signal (on-source data). We also compute a detection statistic β (Roy et al. 2019b) of 10.09 for the presence of the m=3 multipole with a p-value of &lt;2.5×10 -4 , compared to a background distribution estimated over 18 hr of data adjacent to the event (off-source data), where the largest background β is 7.59. The significant difference between on-and off-source values provides much stronger evidence for the presence of higher multipoles than what is reported for GW190412 (Abbott et al. 2020d).Finally, we perform two complementary analyses involving time-frequency tracks in the data to provide further evidence for the presence of higher multipoles in the signal.

It then compares the observed coherent signal energy in the LIGO Hanford-LIGO Livingston-Virgo network of detectors, as identified by the cWB detection pipeline (Klimenko et al. 2016), with the predictions of a waveform model without higher multipoles(EOBNR; Prodi et al. 2020) to investigate if the description of the underlying signal is incomplete if we do not include contributions from the m=3 multipole in our waveform model. We compute a test statistic, the squared sum of the coherent residuals estimated over Figure 6. Two-dimensional posterior probability for the tilt-angle and spinmagnitude for the primary object (left) and secondary object (right) based on the combined samples. The tilt angles are 0°for spins aligned and 180°for spins antialigned with the orbital angular momentum.

        <p>GW190814 is the gravitational-wave event with the most unequal mass ratio to date, and can therefore be used to test general relativity (GR) in a region of parameter space previously unexplored with strong-field tests of GR (Abbott et al. 2016g, 2019e, 2019d). The asymmetric nature of a system excites the higher multipole moments of the gravitational signal, which allows us to test the multipolar structure of gravity (Kastha et al. 2018(Kastha et al. , 2019;;Dhanpal et al. 2019;Islam et al. 2020).

We perform several null tests of GR using GW190814. These tests assume GW190814 is a (quasi-circular) BBH merger as described in GR, and look for inconsistencies between the observed signal and predictions of the theory.

        <p>First, as a consistency test of the signal reconstruction, we subtract from the data the maximum likelihood compact binary coalescence waveforms, Phenom (Khan et al. 2016), Phenom HM (Kalaghatgi et al. 2020), Phenom PHM (Khan et al. 2020), and EOBNR PHM (Ossokine et al. 2020) and analyze 4 s of the resulting residual data centered around the time of merger with the morphology-independent transient analysis 
            <rs type="software">BAYESWAVE</rs> (Cornish &amp; Littenberg 2015;Littenberg &amp; Cornish 2015). We measure the 90% credible upper limit on the coherent S/N, ρ 90 , and compare it to the S/N, r N 90 , recovered by analyzing 175 randomly selected data segments in surrounding time (off-source data) with the same configuration settings. If the residual data are consistent with the noise, we expect ρ 90 to be consistent with r N 90 . We compute the p-value by comparing the distribution of r N 90 to ρ 90 through ( ) r r = &lt; p P N 90 90 . We obtain p-values of 0.59, 0.82, 0.82, and 0.75 for Phenom, Phenom HM, Phenom PHM, and EOBNR PHM, respectively. Hence, we find no evidence for deviations in the behavior of the residual data stream.

        <p>We also look for deviations in the spin-induced quadrupole moments of the binary components. According to the no-hair conjecture (Carter 1971;Hansen 1974) the multipole moments of a Kerr BH are completely described by its mass and spin angular momentum. At leading order in spin, the spin-induced quadrupole moment scalar is (Hartle 1967;Pappas &amp; Apostolatos 2012), Q=-κa 2 m 3 , where (m, a) are the mass and dimensionless spin of the compact object, and κ is a dimensionless deformation parameter characterizing deviations in the spin-induced quadrupole moment. Kerr BHs have κ=1 (Thorne 1980), while κ∼2-14 for NSs (depending on the equation of state) and κ∼10-150 for spinning boson stars with large self-interaction (Ryan 1997). The deformation parameter can even be negative for (slowly rotating, thin-shelled) gravastars (Uchikata et al. 2016). Hence, an accurate measurement of κ sheds light onto the nature of the compact object. For compact binaries, the spin-induced quadrupole moment terms appear at second post-Newtonian order (Poisson 1998). For Kerr BHs in GR, κ 1 =κ 2 =1, where κ 1 , κ 2 are the individual deformation parameters of the primary and secondary compact objects in the binary. Since κ 1 and κ 2 are strongly degenerate in the gravitational waveform, we instead measure a linear symmetric combination of these quantities, κ s =(κ 1 +κ 2 )/2, which is 1 for a BBH in GR. The posteriors on κ s are relatively uninformative, and nearly span the prior range of [0, 500], with increased support at κ s =0 relative to the prior. The upper bound of the prior was chosen to accommodate all the objects listed above. The result shows that GW190814 is consistent with having a BBH source described by GR. However, the broad posterior means that we cannot exclude the possibility that one or both components of the source is not a BH. We can attempt to understand this result in terms of the spin measurements for the binary. The measurements of κ s and a nonzero χ eff are highly correlated (Krishnendu et al. 2019), and for a system with small χ eff the bounds on the measured value of κ s are weak.We also look for deviations in the spin-induced quadrupole moments of the binary components.

        <p>While some candidate EOSs from nuclear theory can support nonrotating NSs with masses of up to ∼3 M e (e.g., Müller &amp; Serot 1996), such large values of M max are disfavored by the relatively small tidal deformabilities measured in GW170817 (Abbott et al. 2017a(Abbott et al. , 2019b)), which correlate with smaller internal pressure gradients as a function of density and hence a lower threshold for gravitational collapse.

        <p>Finally, the NS maximum mass is constrained by studies of the merger remnant of GW170817. Although no postmerger gravitational waves were observed (Abbott et al. 2017g, 2019f), modeling of the associated kilonova (Abbott et al. 2017b(Abbott et al. , 2017d;;Cowperthwaite et al. 2017;Kasen et al. 2017;Villar et al. 2017) suggests that the merger remnant collapsed to a BH after a brief supramassive or hypermassive NS phase during which it was stabilized by uniform or differential rotation. Assuming this ultimate fate for the merger remnant immediately implies that no NS can be stable above ∼2.7 M e , but it places a more stringent constraint on NSs that are not rotationally supported. The precise mapping from the collapse threshold mass of the remnant to M max depends on the EOS, but by developing approximate prescriptions based on sequences of rapidly rotating stars for a range of candidate EOSs, M max has been bounded below approximately 2.2-2.3 M e  (Margalit &amp; Metzger 2017;Rezzolla et al. 2018;Ruiz et al. 2018;Shibata et al. 2019;Abbott et al. 2020c). Although the degree of EOS uncertainty in these results is difficult to quantify precisely, if we take the more conservative 2.3 M e bound at face value, then m 2 is almost certainly not an NS: the m 2 posterior distribution has negligible support below 2.3 M e .Finally, the NS maximum mass is constrained by studies of the merger remnant of GW170817.

        <p>Overall, these considerations suggest that GW190814 is probably not the product of an NSBH coalescence, despite its preliminary classification as such.

        <p>There are two further caveats to this assessment. First, because the secondary's spin is unconstrained, it could conceivably be rotating rapidly enough for m 2 to exceed M max without triggering gravitational collapse: rapid uniform rotation can stabilize a star up to ∼20% more massive than the nonrotating maximum mass (Cook et al. 1994), in which case only the absolute upper bound of ∼2.7 M e is relevant. However, it is very unlikely that an NSBH system could merge before dissipating such extreme natal NS spin angular momentum.There are two further caveats to this assessment.

        <p>Since the NSBH scenario cannot be definitively ruled out, we examine GW190814's potential implications for the NS EOS, assuming that the secondary proves to be an NS. This would require M max to be no less than m 2 , a condition that severely constrains the distribution of EOSs compatible with existing astrophysical data. The combined constraints on the EOS from GW170817 and this hypothetical maximum mass information are shown in Figure 8. Specifically, we have taken the spectral EOS distribution conditioned on GW170817 from Abbott et al. (2018) and reweighted each EOS by the probability that its maximum mass is at least as large as m 2 . The updated posterior favors stiffer EOSs, which translates to larger radii for NSs of a given mass.

        <p>From a theoretical point of view, accurately calculating the masses of compact remnants at formation is challenging, because it depends on the complex physics of the supernova explosion and the details of stellar evolution, especially for the late evolutionary stages of massive stars (Janka 2012;Müller 2016;Burrows et al. 2018Burrows et al. , 2019)). Whether the models favor the presence of a gap or a smooth transition between NSs and BHs is still unclear, and in fact some models have been developed with the purpose of reproducing this lower mass gap (Ugliano et al. 2012;Fryer et al. 2012;Kochanek 2014;Sukhbold &amp; Woosley 2014;Ertl et al. 2016). Therefore, our robust discovery of an object with a well-constrained mass in this regime may provide crucial constraints on compact-object formation models. In fact, GW190814 demonstrates the need to adjust remnant mass prescriptions previously designed to produce a perceived mass gap. The combination of mass ratio and component masses challenges most results obtained from population synthesis simulations for isolated binaries (Dominik et al. 2012(Dominik et al. , 2015;;Marchant et al. 2017;Giacobbo &amp; Mapelli 2018;Kruckow et al. 2018;Mapelli &amp; Giacobbo 2018;Mapelli et al. 2019;Neijssel et al. 2019;Spera et al. 2019;Olejak et al. 2020).From a theoretical point of view, accurately calculating the masses of compact remnants at formation is challenging, because it depends on the complex physics of the supernova explosion and the details of stellar evolution, especially for the late evolutionary stages of massive stars (Janka 2012;Müller 2016;Burrows et al. 2018Burrows et al. , 2019)).

        <p>Population synthesis models distinguish between NSs and BHs using only a mass threshold, which is generally in the range of 2-3 M e . Thus, depending on the adopted threshold and on the adopted supernova explosion model, a GW190814like event may be labeled as either an NSBH merger or a BBH merger. Most BBH mergers have q&gt;0.5, while the distributions of merging NSBH binaries suggest that systems with q0.1 may be up to ∼10 3 times less common than more symmetric ones (q&gt;0.1) and that the mass-ratio distribution peaks at q≈0.2. Furthermore, models tend to favor mergers of massive (1.3 M e ) NSs with relatively small BHs (15 M e ) in environments with subsolar metallicity (Z0.5 Z e ). The tendency to disfavor mergers with highly asymmetric masses in isolated binaries may be the consequence of mass transfer (e.g., Postnov &amp; Yungelson 2014) and common envelope episodes (e.g., Ivanova et al. 2013) that cause systems with initially asymmetric masses to evolve toward more symmetric configurations.

        <p>Another possibility is that GW190814 is of dynamical origin. Dynamical exchanges in dense stellar environments tend to pair up massive compact objects with similar masses (e.g., Sigurdsson &amp; Hernquist 1993). This process is effective for globular clusters, where compact-object binaries may undergo tens of exchanges before they get ejected from the cluster (Portegies Zwart &amp; McMillan 2000;Rodriguez et al. 2016Rodriguez et al. , 2019;;Askar et al. 2017;Park et al. 2017). For such environments, models predict that most merging BBHs have q;1 (e.g., Rodriguez et al. 2016), and the formation of NSBH binaries is highly suppressed because BHs dynamically dominate the cores over the complete lifetime of the clusters, preventing the interactions between BHs and NSs, with the consequence that the merger rate of NSBH binaries in globular clusters in the local universe is ∼10 -2 -10 -1 Gpc -3 yr -1 (Clausen et al. 2013;Arca Sedda 2020;Ye et al. 2020). The rate for GW190814-like events, with a secondary in the perceived mass gap, is likely even lower. In contrast, the NSBH merger rate may be significantly higher in young star clusters (e.g., Ziosi et al. 2014) and the latter can effectively increase the number of progenitors leading to merging compact-object binaries with q0. 15 (di Carlo et al. 2019;Rastello et al. 2020).

Specifically, Safarzadeh et al. (2020) explore the possibility that a second-generation remnant with mass 3 M e may merge with a 30 M e BH, catalyzed by a 50 M e -BH perturber. The mass-ratio distributions of BBH and NSBH mergers from hierarchical systems are similar to those of field binaries and it is unclear whether hierarchies may enhance the formation of merging compact-object binaries with highly asymmetric masses (e.g., Silsbee &amp; Tremaine 2017).A GW190814-like merger may also have originated from a hierarchical triple in the field (e.g., Antonini et al. 2017;Silsbee &amp; Tremaine 2017;Fragione &amp; Loeb 2019), from a wide hierarchical quadruple system (Safarzadeh et al. 2020), or from hierarchical triples in galactic centers, where the tertiary body is a supermassive BH(Antonini &amp; Perets 2012; Petrovich &amp; Antonini 2017;Hoang et al. 2018;Fragione et al. 2019;Stephan et al. 2019).

        <p>Disks of gas around supermassive BHs in active galactic nuclei may be promising environments for the formation of GW190814-like systems. For such environments, theoretical models show that merging compact-object binaries with asymmetric masses are likely, but cannot necessarily accommodate masses as low as the secondary mass of GW190814 (e.g., Yang et al. 2019). However, McKernan et al. (2020) show that the median mass ratio of NSBH mergers in active galactic nucleus disks may be as low as ∼0.07.Disks of gas around supermassive BHs in active galactic nuclei may be promising environments for the formation of GW190814-like systems.

        <p>We conclude that the combination of masses, mass ratio, and inferred rate of GW190814 is challenging to explain, but potentially consistent with multiple formation scenarios. However, it is not possible to assess the validity of models that produce the right properties but do not make quantitative predictions about formation rates, even at some order-ofmagnitude level.We conclude that the combination of masses, mass ratio, and inferred rate of GW190814 is challenging to explain, but potentially consistent with multiple formation scenarios.

        <p>Young star clusters and active galactic nucleus disks seem to be more promising hosts for GW190814-like mergers, since both these environments may enhance the formation of either progenitors of or directly merging compact-object binaries with more asymmetric masses to relevant rates. In contrast, globularcluster models provide more robust predictions, showing that GW190814-like mergers with such asymmetric masses are outliers in the population predictions, even though a revision of the remnant-mass prescription is still needed. Isolated binaries could prove possible progenitors provided similar revisions are implemented. The importance of field multiples remains to be fully explored. Future gravitational-wave observations will provide further insights into the dominance of different channels.Young star clusters and active galactic nucleus disks seem to be more promising hosts for GW190814-like mergers, since both these environments may enhance the formation of either progenitors of or directly merging compact-object binaries with more asymmetric masses to relevant rates.

        <p>GW190814 is the best localized dark siren, i.e., gravitationalwave source without an electromagnetic counterpart, observed to date, and so it is a good candidate for the statistical crosscorrelation method. For a fixed reference cosmology (Ade et al. 2016), the GLADE galaxy catalog (Dálya et al. 2018) is approximately 40%complete at the distance of GW190814 and contains 472galaxies within the 90%posterior credible volume of GW190814. To obtain a constrain on H 0 , we use the methodology described in Abbott et al. (2019c) and the GLADE catalog. We take a flat prior for H 0 ä[20, 140]km s -1 Mpc -1 and assign a probability to each galaxy that it is the true host of the event that is proportional to its B-band luminosity. Using the posterior distribution on the distance obtained from the combined PHM samples, we obtain H 0 = (Soares-Santos et al. 2019) obtained using the dark siren GW170814 alone. The GW190814 result is the most precise measurement from a single dark siren observation to date, albeit comparable to the GW170814 result, which is expected given GW190814ʼs small localization volume (∼39,000 Mpc 3 ). The result is not very constraining, with the 68.3% highest posterior density interval comprising 60%of the prior range. Combining the result for GW190814 with the result obtained from GW170817, we see an improvement over the GW170817-only result, to ).This result is not yet sufficiently constraining to provide further insight into current tensions in low and high redshift measurements of the Hubble constant (Verde et al. 2019), but these constraints will continue to improve as further gravitational-wave observations are included(e.g., projections in Chen et al. 2018;Vitale &amp; Chen 2018;Gray et al. 2020;Feeney et al. 2019).GW190814 is the best localized dark siren, i.e., gravitationalwave source without an electromagnetic counterpart, observed to date, and so it is a good candidate for the statistical crosscorrelation method.

        <p>Comparisons between the secondary mass and several current estimates of the maximum NS mass suggest that GW190814 is unlikely to originate in an NSBH coalescence. Nevertheless, the M max estimates are uncertain enough that improved knowledge of the NS EOS or further observations of the astrophysical population of compact objects could alter this assessment. For this reason, we cannot firmly exclude the possibility that the secondary is an NS, nor can we be certain that it is a BH. Regardless, this event sheds new light on the compact-object mass distribution at the interface between known NSs and BHs.Comparisons between the secondary mass and several current estimates of the maximum NS mass suggest that GW190814 is unlikely to originate in an NSBH coalescence.

        <p>The unique combination of masses and inferred merger rate for this event is difficult to produce in population synthesis models of multicomponent systems in galactic fields or dense stellar environments. The discovery of GW190814 may therefore reshape our understanding of the processes by which the lightest BHs or the most massive NSs form. Based on our rate density estimate, we may reasonably expect to detect more systems of this kind after a year at design sensitivity. This discovery may prove to be the first hint of a larger population that could change our perspective on the formation and mass spectrum of compact objects.The unique combination of masses and inferred merger rate for this event is difficult to produce in population synthesis models of multicomponent systems in galactic fields or dense stellar environments.

The source was localized to 18.5 deg 2 at a distance of -+ 241 45 41 Mpc; no electromagnetic counterpart has been confirmed to date. The source has the most unequal mass ratio yet measured with gravitational waves, -+ 0.112 0.009 0.008 , and its secondary component is either the lightest black hole or the heaviest neutron star ever discovered in a double compact-object system. The dimensionless spin of the primary black hole is tightly constrained to 0.07. Tests of general relativity reveal no measurable deviations from the theory, and its prediction of higher-multipole emission is confirmed at high confidence. We estimate a merger rate density of 1-23 Gpc -3 yr -1 for the new class of binary coalescence sources that GW190814 represents.
