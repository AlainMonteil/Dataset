        <p>Here we show that molecular vibrational modes of the electronic ground state can also be coherently coupled with a microcavity mode at room temperature, given the low vibrational thermal occupation factors associated with molecular vibrations, and the collective coupling of a large ensemble of molecules immersed within the cavity-mode volume. This enables the enhancement of the collective Rabi-exchange rate with respect to the single-oscillator coupling strength. The possibility of inducing large shifts in the vibrational frequency of selected molecular bonds should have immediate consequences for chemistry.Here we show that molecular vibrational modes of the electronic ground state can also be coherently coupled with a microcavity mode at room temperature, given the low vibrational thermal occupation factors associated with molecular vibrations, and the collective coupling of a large ensemble of molecules immersed within the cavity-mode volume.

        <p>First, it is possible to perform direct resonant dipolar coupling by engineering micro-scaled cavities with a fundamental mode o c tuned to the molecular vibrational transitions. Then, as a consequence of their high frequencies in the IR regime, vibrational resonances are characterized by small thermal occupation factors n n $ e À ' o n =k B T $ 10 À 4 , even at room temperature. This means that such molecular normal modes are in their ground state, allowing coherent light-matter coupling in a straightforward manner.First, it is possible to perform direct resonant dipolar coupling by engineering micro-scaled cavities with a fundamental mode o c tuned to the molecular vibrational transitions.

        <p>In the following, we demonstrate the coherent coupling between molecular vibrational transitions and an optical mode of a microcavity, leading to the possibility to swap, at room temperature, excitations coherently between the molecular oscillators and the optical mode. To do so, we have exploited two crucial features offered by polymers. First, the possibility to have an isolated, practically homogeneous, spectral signal associated to a specific vibrational molecular normal mode. Second, the capacity offered through the bulky extension of the polymer film inserted in a Fabry-Perot microcavity to have within a volume of strong optical confinement (that is, the coherence volume of the cavity mode) a large number of resonators. The colocalization of the optical and mechanical modes induces a collective enhancement of the resonant coupling rate between the vibrational resonators and the cavity mode, reaching the regime of strong coherent coupling. In other words, a macroscopic coherent mechanical mode is now generated by strong coupling.In the following, we demonstrate the coherent coupling between molecular vibrational transitions and an optical mode of a microcavity, leading to the possibility to swap, at room temperature, excitations coherently between the molecular oscillators and the optical mode.

        <p>Hamiltonian description. IR spectra associated with gas-phase molecules usually display features where rotational transitions are coupled to vibrational ones. The resulting well-known complexity of rovibrational molecular spectra leads to spectral components separated by wavenumbers o10 cm À 1 . Still, there are specific environments where molecules can display much simpler spectra from which it is possible to select and manipulate chosen vibrational normal modes. Polymeric phases are in this context particularly interesting to explore, since free rotations of molecular moieties are frozen-out and the excitation spectrum of the polymer is determined solely by electronic and vibrational contributions. One should also consider low-frequency vibrations of the polymer lattice itself. Yet, given the small wavenumbers for such lattice vibrations (less than ca. 100 cm À 1 ) compared with the vibrations of individual bonds (ca. 1,000 cm À 1 ), the two classes of motions can be clearly separated 1 . In this regime therefore, vibrational spectra of polymers display normal-mode transitions sufficiently isolated from the background to be tuned properly to a given cavity resonance, as presented in Fig. 1.Hamiltonian description.

        <p>This situation allows us to define the molecular Hamiltonian from a 'double-adiabatic approximation' where a slow component (inter-molecular lattice vibrations) is separated from a fast subsystem describing intra-molecular motions 2 . In our situation, the fast component of the whole Hamiltonian is the only relevant one. We can then perform a second adiabatic (Born-Oppenheimer) approximation to separate the vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom. This separation leads to the definition of the vibrational dipole operator corresponding to the dependence on nuclear coordinates Q of the expectation value of the dipole moment p h iðQÞ in the electronic state considered. We emphasize that our coupling scheme only involves the fundamental electronic state. The low vibrational occupancy number implies moreover that only the fundamental level of the vibrational spectrum is populated. At such low excitations, the molecular vibrations occur within a mean electronic potential that is well treated in the harmonic approximation. We are thus finally dealing with a mechanical normal mode in its harmonic quantum ground state, which constitutes the engaging feature of molecular vibrations in this context-see Fig. 2b.This situation allows us to define the molecular Hamiltonian from a 'double-adiabatic approximation' where a slow component (inter-molecular lattice vibrations) is separated from a fast subsystem describing intra-molecular motions 2 .

        <p>Indeed, the spatially coherent single-mode cavity field drives all the coupled resonators in phase with each other. This induces coherence among the resonators within the whole mode volume and leads to the definition of a macroscopic collective dipole, made of a large number of coupled transitions over which the excitation is delocalized. In the simplest case, neglecting all sources of inhomogeneous broadening 4 , the strong coupling dynamics is defined within a two-level subspace made of collective ground and first excited states through an enhanced coupling rate ' O ffiffiffiffi N p , where N is the ensemble of indiscernible resonators. Considering the very large number of resonators available in condensed systems, this enhancement can rise orders of magnitude, as observed in particular in organic systems [5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] . It thus leads to conditions much easier to fulfill to enter and exploit the regime of coherent strong coupling 16 .Indeed, the spatially coherent single-mode cavity field drives all the coupled resonators in phase with each other.

        <p>Experimental demonstration. To test these ideas and demonstrate their consequences, we choose a polymer with a vibration band that is well isolated from other modes. Polyvinyl acetate has such a feature where the (C ¼ O) bond has a symmetric stretching frequency at 1,740 cm À 1 (215 meV) as shown in Fig. 1. The other peaks are due to other fundamental vibrational modes that are well assigned, as illustrated in the caption 17 . The spectral line of the (C ¼ O) vibration is remarkably close to a Lorentzian line shape (see inset in Fig. 1a), revealing essentially a homogeneous intrinsic vibrational damping of :G v B3.2 meV extracted from the full width at half maximum (FWHM). This results in an associated mechanical quality factor Q v B70.

This is much smaller than both the mechanical damping rate :G v and the cavity decay rate :kB17 meV (see below). In such conditions, it is thus impossible to strongly couple a single molecular vibration to the cavity vacuum field. However, the extremely high density, r, of (C ¼ O) bonds in the polymer can in principle enable the formation of a collective dipole within the cavity-mode volume, as discussed above. With one (C ¼ O) bond per monomer, this density corresponds to approximately r ¼ 10 21 cm À 3 (see Supplementary Note 4).

        <p>To demonstrate this, a specific Fabry-Perot cavity was engineered to have a first mode in the mid IR (MIR) range resonant with the (C ¼ O) vibrational transition (Fig. 1a). This tuning requires a careful choice of substrates and metals forming the mirrors, but eventually allowed us to demonstrate direct dipolar coupling between the cavity field and the molecular motion. The whole experimental set-up, together with the description of the best material compromise, is shown in Fig. 2. Fourier transform IR spectroscopy gives direct access to the spectral density of the transition through a phase-modulated signal transmitted through the cavity þ polymer ensemble (see Supplementary Note 1). This interrogation mode allows the recording of angle-resolved spectral coherent responses of the coupled system.To demonstrate this, a specific Fabry-Perot cavity was engineered to have a first mode in the mid IR (MIR) range resonant with the (C ¼ O) vibrational transition (Fig. 1a).

        <p>As shown in Fig. 3, a Rabi anti-crossing is demonstrated at normal incidence in the dispersion relation of the cavity. The associated vacuum Rabi splitting :O R B20.7 meV exceeds all decoherence rates (evaluated above) and therefore corresponds to the regime of strong coupling. This leads to the formation of two new opto-vibrational modes for the system, as illustrated in Fig. 4. These new modes are the lower and upper polaritonic states and correspond to molecular vibrations dressed by the cavity vacuum field. From the widths of the associated spectral peaks, it is possible to give an estimate of the dephasing times of the dressed states, which are 0.23 and 0.44 ps for the upper and lower polariton states, respectively. The generation of new hybrid vibrational states was further confirmed by the modification of the cavity fundamental modes as shown in Fig. 4. The obvious splitting in the field's distribution due to the strong coupling immediately indicates that the integrated absorption of the coupled system shows the same splitting as well, which is the unambiguous signature of the strong coupling regime (see Supplementary Fig. 1). In our experiments, the observed splittings are probed at very low power and do not depend on it. This rules out any multi-photonic effects occurring in the experiments and reveals that the probe does not induce any a.c.-Stark effect in the system 19 . It thus confirms that the observed energy splittings are due to vacuum Rabi splitting only.As shown in Fig. 3, a Rabi anti-crossing is demonstrated at normal incidence in the dispersion relation of the cavity.

        <p>Exploiting specific properties of polymers, we have been able to demonstrate for the first time the regime of vibrational strong coupling. The microscopic nature of our individual resonators leads to a practically perfect thermal decoupling of the molecular vibrations. Indeed, with Q v Á o v /2p4 4k B T/:, thermal decoherence can be neglected over more than one vibrational period. Thus, essentially due to the extremely tiny effective mass involved in the mechanical stretching mode of the (C ¼ O) bond, coherent coupling is achieved at room temperature. In addition, the high mechanical product Q v Á o v /2p holds promises in the context of transient spectroscopy. Indeed, while our discussion was here limited to the electronic ground state and first vibrational transition, one can envision to actually pump transiently the vibrational manifold. This might lead to inverted population dynamics in connection with polariton vibrational lasing 21 . Finally, because it involves dressed collective modes through the colocalization of the cavity field and the vibrational modes, large coupling rates with ratios O R /k close to 1 can be reached. This could lead to nonlinear behaviour in the IR regime similar to that recently demonstrated for polariton Bose-Einstein condensation 22,23 in the optical regime.Exploiting specific properties of polymers, we have been able to demonstrate for the first time the regime of vibrational strong coupling.

The cavity polarizability is assumed to be homogenous and isotropic, and the incidence angle is taken equal to zero. chemical reaction can be modified by strongly coupling an electronic excited state to the vacuum field 6 . In that case, the reaction involved a light-induced isomerization, a structural transformation of individual photochromic molecules, electronically strongly coupled in the optical regime. However, most chemistry is done in the ground state and starts by bond breaking and formation. Therefore the modification of bond strengths in the ground state by strong coupling to molecular vibrations could open many possibilities in chemical reactivity, catalysis and site-selective reactions. For instance, the optical resonance could be selectively tuned to the vibration of a bond targeted for dissociation. A reduction of the vibrational frequency through hybridization will most likely imply a weakening of the bond strength f, since o / ffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi f =m p . The ground-state energy landscape governing the chemistry may be significantly modified. As an example of important chemical functional groups, the carbonyls (C ¼ O), coupled in this study, play a central role in amide bonding in peptides and as coordinating units in metalloenzymes, as ligands in organometallic and coordination complexes and as the active site in many industrial and pharmaceutical syntheses. For instance, the reaction between benzaldehyde with phenylhydrazine to give a hydrazone, shown in Fig. 5, involves the breaking of the (C ¼ O) bond and therefore its rate and possibly yield could be modified by such bond weakening through strong coupling.

        <p>The possibility of modifying chemical reaction rates, as described above, seems plausible based on several earlier experiments where bulk properties were modified by strong coupling, such as the already cited photochemical reaction, workfunction and the ground-state energy 6,24,25 . However, the actual mechanism of how strong coupling modifies the molecular material properties is still not clear, and it might be counterintuitive that the collective coupling induced in such systems will affect the properties of individual molecules. Further theory is indeed needed on such topics that can handle the complexity of strongly coupled molecular systems to be able to fully understand the potential of light-matter strong coupling for molecular science.The possibility of modifying chemical reaction rates, as described above, seems plausible based on several earlier experiments where bulk properties were modified by strong coupling, such as the already cited photochemical reaction, workfunction and the ground-state energy 6,24,25 .
