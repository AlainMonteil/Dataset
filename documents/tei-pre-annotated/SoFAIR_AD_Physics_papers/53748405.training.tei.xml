        <p>New results for the double spin asymmetry A p 1 and the proton longitudinal spin structure function g p 1 are presented. They were obtained by the COMPASS Collaboration using polarised 200 GeV muons scattered off a longitudinally polarised NH 3 target. The data were collected in 2011 and complement those recorded in 2007 at 160 GeV, in particular at lower values of x. They improve the statistical precision of g p 1 (x) by about a factor of two in the region x 0.02. A next-to-leading order QCD fit to the g 1 world data is performed. It leads to a new determination of the quark spin contribution to the nucleon spin, , ranging from 0.26 to 0.36, and to a re-evaluation of the first moment of g p 1 . The uncertainty of is mostly due to the large uncertainty in the present determinations of the gluon helicity distribution.

In all these experiments, longitudinally polarised high-energy leptons were scattered off longitudinally polarised nucleon or nuclear targets.

        <p>In this Letter, we report on new results from the COMPASS experiment at CERN. By measuring A p 1 , we obtain results on g p 1 in the deep inelastic scattering (DIS) region. They cover the range from 1 (GeV/c) 2 to 190 (GeV/c) 2 in the photon virtuality Q 2 and from 0.0025 to 0.7 in the Bjorken scaling variable x. The new data, which were collected in 2011 at a beam energy of 200 GeV, complement earlier data taken in 2007 at 160 GeV that covered the range 0.004 &lt; x &lt; 0.7 [3]. In the newly explored low-x region, our results significantly improve the statistical precision of g p 1 and thereby allow us to decrease the low-x extrapolation uncertainty in the determination of first moments.In this Letter, we report on new results from the COMPASS experiment at CERN.

        <p>The measurements were performed with the COMPASS setup at the M2 beam line of the CERN SPS. The data presented in this Letter correspond to an integrated luminosity of 0.52 fb -1 . A beam of positive muons was used with an intensity of 10 7 s -1 in a 10 s long spill every 40 s. The nominal beam momentum was 200 GeV/c with a spread of 5%. The beam was naturally polarised with a polarisation P B ≈ 0.8, which is known with a precision of 0.04. Momentum and trajectory of each incoming particle were measured in a set of scintillator hodoscopes, scintillating fibre and silicon detectors. The beam was impinging on a solid-state ammonia (NH 3 ) target that provides longitudinally polarised protons. The three protons in ammonia were polarised up to |P T | ≈ 0.9 by dynamic nuclear polarisation with microwaves.The measurements were performed with the COMPASS setup at the M2 beam line of the CERN SPS.

        <p>For this purpose, the target was placed inside a large-aperture superconducting solenoid with a field of 2.5 T and cooled to 60 mK by a mixture of liquid 3 He and 4 He. The target material was contained in three cylindrical cells with a diameter of 4 cm, which had their axes along the beam line and were separated by a distance of 5 cm. The outer cells with a length of 30 cm were oppositely polarised to the central one, which was 60 cm long. In order to compensate for acceptance differences between the cells, the polarisation was regularly reversed by rotation of the magnetic field direction. In order to guard against unknown systematic effects, the direction of the polarisation relative to the magnetic field was reversed once during the data taking period by exchanging the microwave frequencies applied to the cells. Ten NMR coils surrounding the target material allowed for a measurement of P T with a precision of 0.032 for both signs of the polarisation. The typical dilution due to unpolarisable material in the target amounts to about 0.15.For this purpose, the target was placed inside a large-aperture superconducting solenoid with a field of 2.5 T and cooled to 60 mK by a mixture of liquid 3 He and 4 He.

        <p>The experimental setup allowed for the measurement of scattered muons and produced hadrons. These particles were detected in a two-stage, open forward spectrometer with large acceptance in momentum and angle. Each spectrometer stage consisted of a dipole magnet surrounded by tracking detectors. Scintillating fibre detectors and micropattern gaseous detectors were used in the beam region and close to the beam, while multiwire proportional chambers, drift chambers and straw detectors covered the large outer areas. Scattered muons were identified in sets of drifttube planes located behind iron and concrete absorbers in the first and second stages. Particle identification with the ring imaging Cerenkov detector or calorimeters is not used in this measurement. The 'inclusive triggers' were based on a combination of hodoscope signals for the scattered muons, while for 'semi-inclusive triggers' an energy deposit of hadron tracks in one of the calorimeters was required, optionally in coincidence with an inclusive trigger.

        <p>The selected events are required to contain a reconstructed incoming muon, a scattered muon and an interaction vertex. The measured incident muon momentum has to be in the range 185 GeV/c &lt; p B &lt; 215 GeV/c. In order to equalise the beam flux through all target cells, the extrapolated beam track is required to pass all of them. The measured longitudinal position of the vertex allows us to identify the target cell in which the scattering occurred. The radial distance of the vertex from the beam axis is required to be less than 1.9 cm, by which the contribution of unpolarised material is minimised. All physics triggers, inclusive and semi-inclusive ones, are included in this analysis. In order to be attributed to the scattered muon, a track is required to pass more than 30 radiation lengths of material and it has to point to the hodoscopes that have triggered the event. In order to select the DIS region, only events with photon virtuality Q 2 &gt; 1 (GeV/c) 2 are selected. In addition, the relative muon energy transfer, y, is required to be between 0.1 and 0.9. Here, the lower limit removes events that are difficult to reconstruct, while the upper limit removes the region that is dominated by radiative events. These kinematic constraints lead to the range 0.0025 &lt; x &lt; 0.7 and to a minimum mass squared of the hadronic final state, W 2 , of 12 (GeV/c 2 ) 2 . After all selections, the final sample consists of 77 million events. The selected sample is dominated by inclusive triggers that contribute 84% to the total number of triggers.

        <p>Systematic uncertainties are calculated taking into account multiplicative and additive contributions to A p 1 . Multiplicative contributions originate from the uncertainties of the target polarisation, the beam polarisation, the depolarisation factor (mainly due to the uncertainty of R) and the dilution factor. When added in quadrature, these uncertainties result in a total uncertainty A mult 1 of 0.07 A p 1 . They are shown in Table 1, which also shows the additive contributions. The largest additive contribution to the systematic uncertainty is the one from possible false asymmetries. Their size is estimated with two different approaches. In the first approach, the central target cell is artificially divided into two consecutive 30 cm long parts. Calculating the asymmetry using the two outer cells or the two central parts, the physics asymmetry cancels and thus two independent false asymmetries are formed. Both are found to be consistent with zero. This test was done using the same sub-samples as for the physics asymmetries determination. In order to check for a false asymmetry due to time-dependent effects, the asymmetries A p 1 obtained from these sub-samples are compared by using the method of "pulls" [12]. No significant broadening of pull distributions is observed. These pulls are used to set an upper limit on the systematic uncertainty due to false asymmetries A false , which is due to spin-dependent radiative effects. The total systematic uncertainty is given by the quadratic sum of the contributions in Table 1. The data are analysed in terms of A p 1 and g p 1 as a function of x and Q 2 . The x dependence of A p 1 averaged over Q 2 in each x bin is shown in Fig. 1 together with the previous COMPASS results obtained at 160 GeV [3] and with results from other experiments [1,[13][14][15][16] including those by SMC at 190 GeV [17], while the latest results from JLab [18] were not included because of the W 2 &gt; 12 (GeV/c 2 ) 2 cut.

This is also illustrated in Fig. 2, which shows A p 1 as a function of Q 2 in sixteen intervals of x for the COMPASS data sets at 160 GeV and 200 GeV. In none of the x bins, a significant Q 2 dependence is observed.

        <p>The obtained distributions are presented in Fig. 5. The dark error bands seen in this figure stem from generating several sets of g 1 pseudo-data, which are obtained by randomising the measured g 1 values using their statistical uncertainties according to a normal distribution. This corresponds to a one-standard-deviation accuracy of the extracted parton distributions. A thorough analysis of systematic uncertainties of the fitting procedure is performed. The most important source is the freedom in the choice of the functional forms for q S (x) and g(x). Further uncertainties arise from the uncertainty in the value of α s (Q 2 ) and from effects of SU(2) f and SU(3) f symmetry breaking. The total systematic and statistical uncertainties are represented by the light bands overlaying the dark ones in Fig. 5. For both sets of functional forms discussed above, s(x) + s(x) stays negative. It is different from zero for x 0.001 as are d(x) + d(x) and u(x) + ū(x). The singlet distribution q S (x) is compatible with zero for x 0.07.

The results for the first moments are given in Table 3. In this table, denotes the first moment of the singlet distribution. Note that the first moments of u + ū, d + d and s + s are not independent, since the first moments of the non-singlet distributions are fixed by the decay constants F and D at every value of Q 2 .

        <p>The world data for g p 1 , g d 1 and g n 1 were used to perform a NLO QCD analysis, including a detailed investigation of systematic effects. This analysis thus updates and supersedes the previous COMPASS QCD analysis [20]. It was found that the contribution of quarks to the nucleon spin, , lies in the interval 0.26 and 0.36 2 , where the interval limits reflect mainly the large uncertainty in the determination of the gluon contribution.The world data for g p 1 , g d 1 and g n 1 were used to perform a NLO QCD analysis, including a detailed investigation of systematic effects.
