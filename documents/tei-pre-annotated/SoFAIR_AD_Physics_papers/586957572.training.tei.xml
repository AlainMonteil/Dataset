        <p>Generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) is a large-scale theory for the dynamics of many-body integrable systems. It consists of an infinite set of conservation laws for quasi-particles traveling with effective ("dressed") velocities that depend on the local state. We show that these equations can be recast into a geometric dynamical problem. They are conservation equations with state-independent quasi-particle velocities, in a space equipped with a family of metrics, parametrized by the quasi-particles' type and speed, that depend on the local state. In the classical hard rod or soliton gas picture, these metrics measure the free length of space as perceived by quasi-particles; in the quantum picture, they weigh space with the density of states available to them. Using this geometric construction, we find a general solution to the initial value problem of GHD, in terms of a set of integral equations where time appears explicitly. These integral equations are solvable by iteration and provide an extremely efficient solution algorithm for GHD.Generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) is a large-scale theory for the dynamics of many-body integrable systems.

        <p>Generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) [1,2] is a hydrodynamic theory where the notion of local equilibration to a Galilean (or relativistic) boost of a Gibbs state, is replaced by that of local relaxation to generalized Gibbs ensembles [3][4][5]. It is expected to emerge in appropriate hydrodynamic limits in both quantum and classical integrable many-body systems, including field theory and spin chains, and describes time evolution in inhomogeneous backgrounds or from inhomoge- neous states. It is in the context of steady states arising from domain-wall initial conditions (see, for instance, a review [6]) that it was originally introduced, where it solved the long-standing problem of obtaining full density and current profiles in interacting integrable quantum systems [1,2]. It was generalized to include inhomogeneous force fields [7]. It is seen as emerging in integrable classical systems such as the hard rod fluid [8,9] and soliton gases [10][11][12][13][14], and a classical molecular dynamics solver has been developed for the general form of GHD [14]. It was applied to study spin transport [15][16][17], transport in the hard rod fluid [18], and quantum dynamics of density profiles such as propagating waves in interacting Bose gases [19,20]. Most of these studies concentrate on the emerging hydrodynamics at the Euler scale, at which GHD was originally formulated, but see [7,18,21] for discussions of viscosity effects. Here we do not discuss such effects.Generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) [1,2] is a hydrodynamic theory where the notion of local equilibration to a Galilean (or relativistic) boost of a Gibbs state, is replaced by that of local relaxation to generalized Gibbs ensembles [3][4][5].

        <p>The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we provide a geometric interpretation of GHD. We show that it is a theory for a gas of freely (inertially) propagating particles, but within a space whose metric depends both on the type and velocity of the particle, and on local distribution of particles in the gas. In the hard rod fluid, the metric has a clear interpretation: it measures the free space available between the rods, a notion that was used in [18] in a derivation of the exact solution to the domain wall initial problem. The observation that this generalizes to soliton gases, still described by GHD, then suggests the metric construction proposed here. It is worth noting some similarity, in spirit, to Einstein's theory of general relativity, where currents are conserved in a metric that is determined by the matter content. Second, we use this geometric construction in order to provide a system of integral equations that solve the initial-value problem of GHD in full generality. The integral equations involve the initial condition and the time parameter in an explicit fashion, essentially integrating out the time direction. They can be solved by iteration. We confirm their validity by providing comparisons with direct solutions of the GHD partial differential equations. It is surprising that a general solution to a hydrodynamic equation can be obtained, and this might connect with the integrability of the GHD equations themselves, as found in soliton gases [10][11][12][13]22].The goal of this paper is twofold.

        <p>The most powerful formulation of GHD to date [1,2] uses the physical notion of quasiparticles (although other formulations will doubtless come to the fore in the future). Integrable models solvable by Bethe ansatz, and integrable classical gases such as the hard rod model [8,9] and soliton gases [14], can be seen as models for interacting quasi-particles. A quasiparticle is specified by a spectral parameter θ ∈ R, parametrizing its momentum p(θ) (it can be taken as the velocity in the Galilean case, or the rapidity in the relativistic case; in general it is just a parametrization of the momentum). The scattering kernel S(θ, α) characterizes the interaction amongst quasi-particles, and it is customary to define the differential scattering phase ϕ(θ, α) = -i d log S(θ, α)/dθ , which we assume to be symmetric. In this paper we assume for simplicity that there is a single particle species, but all equations are directly generalizable to models with many species such as the Heisenberg chain, simply by viewing the rapidity θ as a multi-index θ = (θ, j). In the quasi-particle formulation of GHD, the local fluid state is described by a function specifying the distribution of quasi-particles. This function can be taken as the density ρ p (x; θ): the infinitesimal ρ p (x; θ) dx dθ is the number of quasi-particles in the phase space volume element [x, x + dx] × [p(θ), p(θ) + p (θ )dθ ] (here and below the prime symbol ( ) denotes a derivative with respect to the spectral parameter).The most powerful formulation of GHD to date [1,2] uses the physical notion of quasiparticles (although other formulations will doubtless come to the fore in the future).

        <p>In the hard rod fluid, segments, all of fixed length a, move on the line, freely (inertially) except for collisions at which they exchange their velocities. By definition, a quasi-particle is a tracer of a given velocity: it follows the trajectory of a given velocity. The quasi-particle therefore travels like a free particle, except at collisions. Two quasi-particles, with velocities v, w, collide if their actual positions, x w , x v and velocities satisfy either x vx w = a and v &lt; w, or x wx v = a and w &lt; v. Because of the collision, in the first case x v jumps to x va and x w to x w + a, while in the second case x v jumps to x v + a and x w to x wa.

        <p>As a natural generalization, the jump size may be assumed to depend on the velocities of both collision partners. In other words, in the rules above, -a is replaced by the general kernel ϕ(v, w) without any particular sign restrictions. That is, ϕ(v, w) is seen as an effective rod length, as perceived by the quasi-particles at velocities v and w when they collide. In order to take into account correctly cases where many particles interact within short time intervals, care must be taken in implementing the jumps. However, the above rules provide the sufficient features for our analysis, and for connecting with soliton scattering. See [14] for more details. Heuristically, ϕ(v, w) &lt; 0 corresponds to a repulsive and ϕ(v, w) &gt; 0 to an attractive interaction. In our context, velocity is replaced by the spectral parameter. Thus in a collision two quasi-particles at spectral parameters θ and α jump by the distance -ϕ(θ, α) with a sign governed by the rules from above.As a natural generalization, the jump size may be assumed to depend on the velocities of both collision partners.

        <p>There is a natural geometric re-interpretation of the Euler equations for the hard rod or soliton gas. The idea is that the quasi-particles travel as free particles, which do not seem to interact, if one "shrinks" the effective rods' lengths to zero. Indeed the motion of a test quasi-particle in the free space available in-between the (effective) rods in the gas in which it moves, is that of a free point-like particle at the group velocity v gr (θ ) = E (θ )/p (θ ). This free space is, however, state-dependent, as it depends on the density of rods in the fluid, and in the general case it also depends on the spectral parameters (the type and speed) of the test quasi-particle itself. Therefore, we may put a family of metrics on the one-dimensional space in which quasi-particles propagate, parametrized by the spectral parameters, whose associated length is the available length as perceived by the test quasi-particles. Each such metric is determined by the local state, and in this metric, the test quasi-particle propagates freely. The relation that fixes the metric as a function of the local state may be interpreted as an "Einstein equation", and the free propagation is a conservation equation within the metric. The full system is therefore, in spirit, somewhat similar to Einstein's theory of general relativity.There is a natural geometric re-interpretation of the Euler equations for the hard rod or soliton gas.

The derivation above is unaffected by the change θ → (θ, j) where j is an internal index for particle types; the only difference, in the derivation, is that integrals over spectral parameters are augmented by sums over particle types.

The derivation above is unaffected by the change θ → (θ, j) where j is an internal index for particle types; the only difference, in the derivation, is that integrals over spectral parameters are augmented by sums over particle types.

The potential is then suddenly flattened, so that the density accumulation is released into two oppositely propagating waves. At zero temperature, GHD results have been explicitly checked in [20] to agree with numerical quantum evolution, and it has been shown that GHD equations (7) simplify to conventional hydrodynamics for finite times, providing a simple alternative for the time evolution. This allows for compelling comparison with the current iterative method. We also study the bump release problem at finite temperature where conventional hydrodynamics fails, comparing with the molecular dynamics developed in [14] and thus giving further compelling evidence.In order to explicitly check that solving the integral equations by iteration coincides with directly solving the GHD equation ( 7), we focus on the "bump-release problem" studied for instance in [20].
