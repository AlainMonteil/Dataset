        <p>The lattice symmetry of a crystal is one of the most important factors in determining its physical properties. Particularly, low-symmetry crystals offer powerful opportunities to control light propagation, polarization and phase [1][2][3][4] . Materials featuring extreme optical anisotropy can support a hyperbolic response, enabling coupled light-matter interactions, also known as polaritons, with highly directional propagation and compression of light to deeply sub-wavelength scales 5 . Here we show that monoclinic crystals can support hyperbolic shear polaritons, a new polariton class arising in the mid-infrared to far-infrared due to shear phenomena in the dielectric response. This feature emerges in materials in which the dielectric tensor cannot be diagonalized, that is, in low-symmetry monoclinic and triclinic crystals in which several oscillators with non-orthogonal relative orientations contribute to the optical response 6,7 . Hyperbolic shear polaritons complement previous observations of hyperbolic phonon polaritons in orthorhombic 1,3,4 and hexagonal 8,9 crystal systems, unveiling new features, such as the continuous evolution of their propagation direction with frequency, tilted wavefronts and asymmetric responses. The interplay between diagonal loss and off-diagonal shear phenomena in the dielectric response of these materials has implications for new forms of non-Hermitian and topological photonic states. We anticipate that our results will motivate new directions for polariton physics in low-symmetry materials, which include geological minerals 10 , many common oxides 11 and organic crystals 12 , greatly expanding the material base and extending design opportunities for compact photonic devices.The lattice symmetry of a crystal is one of the most important factors in determining its physical properties.

        <p>Crystal symmetry plays a critical role in dictating the optical, electronic, mechanical and thermal properties of a material. Reduced symmetry is at the heart of numerous emergent phenomena, including structural phase transitions 11 , charge-density waves 13 and topological physics 14 . The interaction of light with low-symmetry materials is particularly important, as it allows fine control over the phase, propagation direction and polarization 1-4 . This control can be especially pronounced for sub-diffractional surface waves, for instance, surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) 15 and surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), supported at the surface of polar crystals and conductors, respectively. Both SPhPs and SPPs are quasiparticles comprising photons and coherently oscillating charges, that is, polar lattice vibrations or free-carrier plasmas, respectively, and they are strongly influenced by crystal symmetry. As a relevant example, low-symmetry polaritonic materials can support hyperbolic light propagation 16 , constituting an exotic class of light waves that are highly directional with very large momenta. Hyperbolic polaritons occur in materials in which the real part of the permittivity along at least one crystal direction is negative and positive along at least one other. This extreme anisotropy is associated with free carriers and optic phonons in anisotropic lattices. In turn, hyperbolic polaritons enable deeply sub-wavelength light confinement over broad bandwidths 8,9 . In polar crystals with symmetries that support a single optical axis (uniaxial), such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), hyperbolic polaritons (HPs) of type I or type II can arise 5,8,9 , for which the hyperbolic isofrequency surfaces do or do not intersect the optical axis, respectively. Materials or metamaterials exhibiting lower symmetry, in which all three major polarizability axes are different (biaxial) but orthogonal, such as alpha-phase molybdenum trioxide (α-MoO 3 ) 1,3 , Li-intercalated vanadium pentoxide (V 2 O 5 ) 4 or nanostructured metasurfaces 17 , exhibit several distinct spectral regimes of hyperbolic modes propagating along different crystal axes. Notably, in-plane hyperbolicity within α-MoO 3 films has been shown to be low loss 1,3 , with reconfigurable features 2 and capable of supporting topological transitions 2 . More exotic polaritonic responses may be expected in crystals with further reduced symmetry, such as monoclinic and triclinic lattices.Crystal symmetry plays a critical role in dictating the optical, electronic, mechanical and thermal properties of a material.

        <p>Monoclinic crystals make up the largest crystal system, with around one-third of the minerals of Earth belonging to one of its three classes 18 . These low-symmetry Bravais lattices exhibit non-orthogonal principal crystal axes (Fig. 1a), in contrast to orthorhombic (for example, biaxial α-MoO 3 (ref. 1 )), tetragonal, hexagonal, trigonal (for example, uniaxial α-quartz, aQ, Fig. 1b) or cubic crystal systems. As a consequence, their dielectric permittivity tensor has major polarizability directions that strongly depend on the frequency, with off-diagonal terms that cannot be completely removed through coordinate rotation 6,7 , and exhibits shear terms analogous to viscous flow 19 . These features arise due to the non-trivial relative orientation (neither parallel nor orthogonal) of several optical transitions that, at a given frequency, contribute to a net polarization that cannot be aligned with the crystal axes. In turn, this property results in exotic light propagation not supported by higher-symmetry crystals 6,7,20 . Here we show exemplary consequences of these material features for nanophotonics, in particular, the emergence of a new form of waves -hyperbolic shear polaritons (HShPs)which have not been previously observed.Monoclinic crystals make up the largest crystal system, with around one-third of the minerals of Earth belonging to one of its three classes 18 .

        <p>In this work, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate the emergence of HShPs in monoclinic crystals. As an exemplary material to demonstrate this phenomenon, we study beta-phase Ga 2 O 3 (bGO), which has gained a large amount of research and industrial attention for its high breakdown field 21 and applications in photovoltaics 22 , optical displays 23 and gas sensors 24 . In the low-energy range, bGO features several strong infrared-active, non-orthogonal phonon resonances 6 , making the permittivity tensor of bGO naturally non-diagonalizable. Its low symmetry has two consequences on the polariton propagation when compared with more conventional hyperbolic materials with a diagonal permittivity tensor, such as hBN, aQ and α-MoO 3 . First, both the bGO polariton wavelength and the propagation direction strongly disperse with frequency. Second, we demonstrate that the asymmetric nature of optical loss in such crystals gives rise to shear, resulting in polariton propagation with tilted wavefronts. Such tilted wavefronts are a direct consequence of the low symmetry of the material and are one of the most notable and unique features of HShPs. New opportunities for polaritonics arise for HShPs stemming directly from their non-Hermitian and topological nature. Yet, surprisingly, they can be observed in low-loss, naturally occurring materials, without the need for artificial structuring of a material surface 17 .In this work, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate the emergence of HShPs in monoclinic crystals.

        <p>To highlight the role of the asymmetry of monoclinic crystals in their polariton response, we compare HShPs with HPs supported by higher-symmetry anisotropic crystals, such as aQ 25 . In this vein, we compare the crystal structure of monoclinic bGO in Fig 1a with the trigonal crystal of aQ in Fig. 1b, illustrating the low crystal symmetry present in bGO. In general, the description of the dielectric response of monoclinic crystals requires inclusion of identical off-diagonal elements in the monoclinic plane within the frequency-dependent, complex-valued dielectric tensor.To highlight the role of the asymmetry of monoclinic crystals in their polariton response, we compare HShPs with HPs supported by higher-symmetry anisotropic crystals, such as aQ 25 .

        <p>The coordinate systems used to define the response of bGO and aQ are sketched in Fig. 1a, b, respectively. To analyse the properties of HShPs in monoclinic materials, we first rigorously solve Maxwell's equations (see Methods) to calculate the dispersion relation of the polaritonic modes supported by bGO and -for comparison -aQ, each at two distinct frequencies. Initially, we consider the lossless case, in which the imaginary part of each term in the dielectric tensor is neglected for both bGO and aQ. The solutions for the polariton wavevectors in both materials at two different frequencies are provided in Fig. 1c,d. For aQ, we observe two open hyperboloid surfaces -as expected for uniaxial hyperbolic materials -in which a change in frequency results in a corresponding change in wavevector, while preserving the hyperboloid orientation, that is, the direction of polariton propagation (Fig. 1d). By contrast, as we change the frequency, not only does the bGO polariton wavevector magnitude change but the direction of the hyperboloid also rotates within the monoclinic plane, as can be appreciated by examining the k z = 0 projections (Fig. 1c). This is a direct consequence of the non-trivial relative orientation of the phonon resonances supporting the hyperbolic response 6 , which results in polariton bands that disperse in azimuth angle as a function of frequency. This feature represents a signature of the reduced symmetry associated with HShPs supported in monoclinic crystals (and is also anticipated in triclinic crystals), in contrast to HPs observed in higher-symmetry lattices.The coordinate systems used to define the response of bGO and aQ are sketched in Fig. 1a, b, respectively.

        <p>When we also account for natural material losses resulting from inherent phonon-scattering processes, the polariton propagation in bGO shows a reduced symmetry in comparison with hyperbolic polaritons in aQ, even at individual frequencies, as illustrated in Fig. 1e,f. In these panels, we show the results of full-wave calculations of dipole-launched surface polaritons propagating across the surface of a semi-infinite slab of bGO and y-cut aQ, in which -in both cases -natural material losses were explicitly taken into account. For in-plane hyperbolic materials, these surface waves show a hyperbolic dispersion within the surface plane and are referred to as hyperbolic surface or hyperbolic Dyakonov polaritons 26,27 , constituting a subset of HPs supported in these materials similar to volume-confined HPs in thin films. For aQ, HPs spread out along one crystal axis of the surface and are symmetric with respect to the crystal axes, as can be confirmed by a Fourier transform of the real-space electric field profile (Fig. 1h). However, for bGO (Fig. 1e), we observe that HPs are rotated with respect to the coordinate system of the monoclinic plane, as anticipated by the isofrequency contours (Fig. 1c). In addition, the wavefronts are tilted with respect to the major propagation direction, with no apparent mirror symmetry. This feature can also be clearly seen by examining the Fourier transform of the real-space profile (Fig. 1g), exhibiting a stronger intensity along one side of the hyperbola. These observations constitute the discovery of HShPs in low-symmetry crystals.When we also account for natural material losses resulting from inherent phonon-scattering processes, the polariton propagation in bGO shows a reduced symmetry in comparison with hyperbolic polaritons in aQ, even at individual frequencies, as illustrated in Fig. 1e,f.

        <p>To experimentally demonstrate the effects of reduced symmetry in polariton propagation in bGO in contrast to higher-symmetry materials, we compare the azimuthal dispersion of HShPs in bGO to the one of HPs in aQ using an Otto-type prism-coupling geometry 28,29 (sketched in Fig. 2a; for details, see Methods). The experimental azimuthal dispersion of HPs on the surface of aQ is shown in Fig. 2b (see also Extended Data Fig. 3), in excellent agreement with the corresponding simulations (Fig. 2c). The dips in the reflectance spectra show the polariton resonances, which are only observable along specific azimuth angles and are symmetric about the crystal axes, ϕ = 0° (180°) and 90°. By contrast, the experimental azimuthal dispersion of HShPs on monoclinic bGO (Fig. 2d) exhibits no mirror symmetry, again in excellent agreement with the simulated dispersion (Fig. 2e).To experimentally demonstrate the effects of reduced symmetry in polariton propagation in bGO in contrast to higher-symmetry materials, we compare the azimuthal dispersion of HShPs in bGO to the one of HPs in aQ using an Otto-type prism-coupling geometry 28,29 (sketched in Fig. 2a; for details, see Methods).

        <p>To experimentally access the in-plane hyperbolic dispersion of the HShP in bGO observed in Fig. 1e, we mapped out the frequency-momentum dispersion in close spectral proximity of that mode (680-720 cm -1 ) at many azimuth angles (see Extended Data Fig. 4). The resulting map of polariton resonance frequencies is shown in Fig. 2f, in excellent agreement with the simulated resonance frequencies shown in Fig. 2g. These data allow extraction of single-frequency in-plane dispersion curves shown in Fig. 2h, i from experiment and simulations, respectively, for several selected frequencies, clearly demonstrating a hyperbolic dispersion, in excellent agreement with Fig. 1e. Notably, the base of the hyperbola shifts continuously with frequency, as marked by the symmetry axes for each curve in Fig. 2i, which directly leads to an asymmetric distribution of the group velocity along the hyperbolic dispersion curve, as shown in Fig. 2j (see also Extended Data Fig. 7).To experimentally access the in-plane hyperbolic dispersion of the HShP in bGO observed in Fig. 1e, we mapped out the frequency-momentum dispersion in close spectral proximity of that mode (680-720 cm -1 ) at many azimuth angles (see Extended Data Fig. 4).

        <p>The reduced symmetry observed in the polaritonic dispersion of bGO (Fig. 2d) is a direct consequence of the lack of symmetry in its vibrational structure 6 . Therefore, the HShPs are not propagating along fixed axes but show a continuous rotation of the HShP propagation direction as the frequency is varied. To describe the nature of this rotation, we diagonalize the real part of the permittivity tensor of bGO ε ω Re[ ( )] individually at each frequency, by rotating the monoclinic plane by the frequency-dependent angle.The reduced symmetry observed in the polaritonic dispersion of bGO (Fig. 2d) is a direct consequence of the lack of symmetry in its vibrational structure 6 .

        <p>Although equation ( 2) describes the frequency variation of the polariton propagation direction, it does not capture the tilted wavefronts observed in Fig. 1e. This is because, as we choose the rotated coordinate system [mnz], we still retain a purely imaginary off-diagonal permittivity component (see Extended Data Fig. 1). These terms are associated with the non-orthogonal relative orientation of the material resonances, coupling the two crystal axes in the monoclinic plane. As a result, even in the rotated coordinate system [mnz], the dielectric tensor has off-diagonal terms associated with shear phenomena.Although equation ( 2) describes the frequency variation of the polariton propagation direction, it does not capture the tilted wavefronts observed in Fig. 1e.

        <p>To selectively analyse the role of these shear terms, we simulate the polariton propagation in the rotated coordinate system [mnz] at 718 cm -1 . In particular, we include a scaling factor for the magnitude of the off-diagonal imaginary component, indicated as i × fIm(ε mn ), with f = 0, 0.5 and 1 (shown in Fig. 3a-c), while retaining the diagonal loss terms. When we remove the off-diagonal component (f = 0), bGO essentially becomes a shear-free biaxial material, akin to α-MoO 3 and similar to uniaxial aQ, with polaritons propagating along the optical axes (Fig. 3a). Therefore, whereas polariton propagation in such a fictional form of bGO is anisotropic in specific spectral ranges (similar to polaritons in MoO 3 (refs. 1,3 )), mode propagation without shear phenomena is symmetric about the (frequency-dependent) major polarizability axes (Fig. 3a). As we gradually increase the magnitude of the off-diagonal imaginary terms back to its natural value (f = 1), the wavefronts become increasingly skewed from the major polarizability axis (Fig. 3b,c). The respective reciprocal space maps in Fig. 3d-f show a strong symmetry breaking in the intensity distribution within the hyperbolic isofrequency curves. This observation provides further evidence that the propagation of polaritons is non-trivial within low-symmetry monoclinic -and, by extension, triclinic -systems, and it cannot be expected in higher-symmetry materials in which polariton propagation patterns are symmetric about the principal crystal axes 1,3,4 .To selectively analyse the role of these shear terms, we simulate the polariton propagation in the rotated coordinate system [mnz] at 718 cm -1 .

The respective reciprocal space maps in Fig. 3d-f show a strong symmetry breaking in the intensity distribution within the hyperbolic isofrequency curves. This observation provides further evidence that the propagation of polaritons is non-trivial within low-symmetry monoclinic -and, by extension, triclinic -systems, and it cannot be expected in higher-symmetry materials in which polariton propagation patterns are symmetric about the principal crystal axes 1,3,4 .</p>
        <p>To connect the reduced symmetry of the surface subset of HShPs observed here experimentally (Fig. 2) and through our simulations (Fig. 3a-c) to the more general HShPs in the bulk, we now calculate isofrequency surfaces for polariton modes in bGO explicitly including loss, to account for the effect of shear phenomena. To this end, we solve Maxwell's equations for real momentum values, yielding complex frequency eigenvalues, whose imaginary part accounts for the finite lifetime of the supported modes (see Methods for details). The results of these calculations are shown in Fig. 3g-i. Here the real part of the eigenfrequency is fixed and we find its imaginary part ω i (Fig. 3h), which is proportional to the modal lifetime, and the corresponding value of k z (Fig. 3g) for each pair of k m and k n . The calculations are performed in the rotated coordinate system for both f = 0 and f = 1, showing that both the shape of the isofrequency surfaces as well as their lifetimes change greatly with the inclusion of the off-diagonal imaginary components. Notably, these calculations prove that, at individual frequencies and in the major polarizability frame, mirror symmetry of polariton propagation is lost in monoclinic materials as a direct consequence of shear.To connect the reduced symmetry of the surface subset of HShPs observed here experimentally (Fig. 2) and through our simulations (Fig. 3a-c) to the more general HShPs in the bulk, we now calculate isofrequency surfaces for polariton modes in bGO explicitly including loss, to account for the effect of shear phenomena.

A point dipole was placed 100 nm above the surface of an infinite slab of bGO, with a dielectric permittivity matching that of ref. 6 . The dielectric function of aQ was taken from ref. 46 . Perfectly matched impedance boundary conditions were used on the sides of the simulation, which -in principle -absorb all radiation. However, to account for the imperfect behaviour of the boundaries, we ensured that the bGO slab was sufficiently large (250 × 250 × 8 μm), such that the wave is sufficiently damped when it reaches the boundary so as not to influence the results. Reciprocal space maps were generated by 2D Fourier transformation of the real-space electric field profiles.

        <p>Assignment of the polariton mode nature. First, we briefly outline how conventional polariton materials are classified. A material supports surface polaritons at frequencies for which the real part of the crystal permittivity fulfils Re(ε) &lt; -1 (ref. 47 ). In uniaxial crystals, the diagonal permittivity elements can be of different sign, leading to hyperbolic behaviour in which either the real part of one element is negative and the other two are positive (type I) or two are negative and one is positive (type II) 9 . However, this classification of anisotropic materials relies on the off-diagonal permittivity tensor elements being zero at all frequencies for an appropriate choice of coordinate system. The lower symmetry of bGO requires the emergence of ε xy ≠ 0. The dielectric permittivity elements using coordinates as indicated in Fig. 1a are shown in Extended Data Fig. 1a-e, but no coordinate system exists in which Re(ε x,y ) ≠ 0 at all frequencies. This, as we have demonstrated in the Otto-geometry experiments (Fig. 2d), results in a non-trivial polaritonic response with highly directional modes that propagate along frequency-dictated propagation angles in the a-c plane. Furthermore, because ε xy ≠ 0, it is not straightforward to determine whether the modes are elliptical (ε xx , ε yy , ε zz &lt; -1) or hyperbolic in nature (type I or type II), as the propagation angle is typically not aligned with one of the principal axes.Assignment of the polariton mode nature.

        <p>To unambiguously describe the nature of the polariton modes, we switch to a frequency-dispersive coordinate system [mnz], in which the real part of the permittivity tensor is diagonal. This is achieved by rotating the monoclinic plane by the frequency-dependent angle γ(ω) (equation ( 2)). The dispersion of γ(ω) and the resulting diagonal elements of ε [mnz] are plotted in Extended Data Fig. 1f-j. This new frequency-dispersive coordinate system enables the unique assignment of the supported polariton mode nature, which we have colour-coded in Extended Data Fig. 1g-j. For bGO, we observe the full range of possible combinations of positive and negative real parts of ε mm , ε nn and ε zz , leading to dielectric (white), elliptical (grey) and hyperbolic spectral regimes of type I (in-plane in blue, out-of-plane in red) and type II (in-plane in green, out-of-plane in yellow). By performing such a frequency-dependent rotation of the permittivity tensor, we have simplified the system into a pseudo-biaxial crystal at each frequency. However, as the dielectric tensor of a monoclinic crystal is not diagonalizable 20,48,49 , the in-plane, off-diagonal element of ε [mnz] retains a non-vanishing imaginary part at all frequencies, that is, Im(ε mn ) ≠ 0 (plotted in Extended Data Fig. 1i), giving rise to the reduced symmetry of hyperbolic shear polaritons in monoclinic crystals, as discussed in Fig. 3.To unambiguously describe the nature of the polariton modes, we switch to a frequency-dispersive coordinate system [mnz], in which the real part of the permittivity tensor is diagonal.

        <p>The frequency-dependent rotation of the dielectric permittivity tensor is performed in three subsequent steps. First, the in-plane permittivity tensor as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1a-c is rotated about the angle γ(ω) (equation ( 2)). However, γ(ω) has jumps of 90° at arbitrary frequencies, resulting in abrupt discontinuities in the real parts of ε mm and ε nn , for which the two curves switch values. By analysing the derivative of ε mm , we extract the frequency values ω jump , in which the jumps occur and reassign the permittivity curves, respectively. At the eight in-plane TO frequencies ω TO of bGO, the permittivity curves feature a pole, which is also captured in the analysis of the derivative. Therefore, at this step, the resulting curves are smooth between the TO frequencies, but switch assignment at every ω TO . The switching of the curves at every ω TO is performed in the last step. However, near ω TO , the permittivity features a large imaginary part, which is not accounted for in the rotation angle γ(ω). This leads to poles in γ(ω) at ω TO (see Extended Data Fig. 1f), which -in turn -results in a small avoided crossing of ε mm and ε nn at the TO frequencies. Therefore, the reassignment of the last step results in discontinuous solutions near ω TO , which is clearly not physical. To resolve this issue, we cut out ±1 cm -1 in both ε mm and ε nn at all eight ω TO and smooth the curves by interpolation, resulting in the pseudo-biaxial permittivity curves as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1g-h. The rotation about γ(ω) also leads to discontinuities in the off-diagonal imaginary part Im(ε mn ) at the frequencies ω jump . However, because ε mn = ε nm , the abrupt rotation about 90° only leads to sign changes at every ω jump . The curve of Im(ε mn ) shown in Extended Data Fig. 1i is corrected for these sign changes.The frequency-dependent rotation of the dielectric permittivity tensor is performed in three subsequent steps.

        <p>Polariton behaviour in bGO in the rotated frame. To verify the polaritonic behaviour of bGO in the rotated frame, that is, the pseudo-biaxial crystal, we subsequently analyse the surface polariton dispersion in the rotated coordinate system [mnz] in Extended Data Fig. 2. For electric fields in the m-z or n-z planes, the analytical expression describing extraordinary surface polaritons in uniaxial crystals can be used 50 in which ε in-plane = ε mm , ε nn . In bGO, the solutions yield four polariton branches for each direction, m and n, respectively, plotted as red dotted lines in Extended Data Fig. 2c,d. These analytical results are in perfect agreement with the numerically obtained surface polariton dispersion using a transfer matrix formalism 44 . To obtain the polariton propagation properties of the system, we calculate the full electric field patterns by placing a point dipole source above the bGO surface at x = y = 0 and simulating the optical response along the bGO-air interface (z = 0) with COMSOL Multiphysics 45 . The real-space field profiles clearly show the rotation of the major polarizability direction as a function of frequency, demonstrated for six different modes M1-M3 and N1-N3 (See Extended Data Fig. 2e-g, k-m). Frequencies are indicated as black dash-dotted lines in Extended Data Fig. 2a-d. Mode N4 is shown in Fig. 1e,g. The field profiles align with the rotated coordinate system, with basis vectors indicated by the 'm' and 'n' crosshair in each figure.Polariton behaviour in bGO in the rotated frame. To verify the polaritonic behaviour of bGO in the rotated frame, that is, the pseudo-biaxial crystal, we subsequently analyse the surface polariton dispersion in the rotated coordinate system [mnz] in Extended Data Fig. 2. For electric fields in the m-z or n-z planes, the analytical expression describing extraordinary surface polaritons in uniaxial crystals can be used 50 in which ε in-plane = ε mm , ε nn . In bGO, the solutions yield four polariton branches for each direction, m and n, respectively, plotted as red dotted lines in Extended Data Fig. 2c,d. These analytical results are in perfect agreement with the numerically obtained surface polariton dispersion using a transfer matrix formalism 44 . To obtain the polariton propagation properties of the system, we calculate the full electric field patterns by placing a point dipole source above the bGO surface at x = y = 0 and simulating the optical response along the bGO-air interface (z = 0) with COMSOL Multiphysics 45 .

        <p>To relate the calculated dispersion of the polariton branches to the field profiles, we calculate the momentum-k maps of these modes, as obtained by a 2D Fourier transformation of the respective electric field patterns of Extended Data Fig. 2e-g, k-m in Extended Data Fig. 2h-j, n-p, respectively. At all selected frequency positions, the electric field patterns contain a directional wave of large amplitude with low spatial frequency, as well as a wave with high spatial frequency. The observed in-plane momenta of the low-k modes follow the modal dispersion predicted in Extended Data Fig. 2c,d, along the m and n axes for modes M1-M3 and N1-N3, respectively, as indicated by the black circles in Extended Data Fig. 2h-j, n-p. According to the mode characterization provided in Extended Data Fig. 1, these modes are hyperbolic, either of type I in-plane (M1-M3 and N1) or of type II in-plane (N2, N3). For all HShP modes, field patterns and k-space maps are characterized by twofold rotational symmetry only, in agreement with the 2D plane group 2 (no mirror plane symmetries). Further, the distinct peaks in the k-space maps verify the principal polariton propagation direction, whereas the corresponding radial and azimuthal spreads are representative of their decay length and degree of directionality, respectively. Analogous to the model at 718 cm -1 discussed in the main text, the maxima of the k-space maps shown in Extended Data Fig. 2 do not lie on the major polarizability axes (most prominently for the cases in Extended Data Fig. 2n,o), owing to shear phenomena in monoclinic bGO. This is discussed further in the main text and in Fig. 3. 44 . The four supported polaritons along each axis m and n are clearly distinguishable, in perfect agreement with the theoretically calculated polariton dispersion (red dotted lines) 50 . Black horizontal dash-dotted lines mark the frequencies M1-M3 and N1-N4 at which the electric field distribution is plotted.

All maps (e-p) were calculated using the non-dispersive permittivity tensor (Extended Data Fig. 1a-e), thus showing rotated field patterns with different orientations, depending on the frequency. The thin black and white crosshairs indicate the principal axes of the respective frequency-dispersive coordinate system, its rotation given by γ at the corresponding frequency. Small black circles in h-j and n-p mark the momentum value of the analytical dispersion in c and d, respectively. Extended Data Fig. 3 | Experimental datasets for bGO and aQ at different gap sizes. The gap size d gap in our Otto geometry setup can be tuned and monitored 43 , enabling control over the excitation efficiency of the polariton modes 44 . Datasets measured for bGO (a-c) and for aQ (d-f) at three different gap sizes each. For smaller gaps, some modes are overcoupled and their resonance features broadened (such as the mode at 500 cm -1 in bGO), whereas for larger gaps, some modes are undercoupled and their resonance features too weak to be clearly distinguishable (in particular, the mode at 725 cm -1 in bGO). The centre gap sizes compromise between these effects. Note that the gap sizes indicated here are the values monitored with a white-light interferometry setup 43 . The fits performed for the datasets shown in Fig. 2, that is, the datasets shown in Extended Data Fig. 3b for bGO and Extended Data Fig. 3e for aQ, however, yielded larger gap sizes of 8.3 μm (bGO) and 10.4 μm (aQ). The offset can be attributed to non-perfect parallel alignment between prism and sample and a lateral offset between the polariton excitation site with the FEL and the white-light spot for the gap measurement.

        <p>Extended Data Fig. 5 | Q-factor asymmetry along the in-plane hyperbolic dispersion of bGO. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the polariton resonance dips in Extended Data Fig. 4 was extracted, indicative of the (inverse) quality factor (Q-factor) of the polariton. We used the 
            <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> function 'findpeaks' to extract the FWHM of the resonance dips, which works robustly independent of the specific peak shapes. To account for the effect of different optical coupling efficiencies for different momenta in the Otto geometry at constant air gap 28 , the FWHM should only be compared at the same momentum values. Therefore, we first interpolated the azimuth angle at which the polariton crosses the experimental momenta from Fig. 2f and then interpolated the resonance width extracted for these momenta from Extended Data Fig. 4 to that same azimuth angle. This procedure was performed for each frequency at both sides of the hyperbolic curves (Fig. 2h). Finally, the Q-factor asymmetry is given as the ratio of the FWHM on the left side (smaller azimuth angles) and the right side (larger azimuth angles) of the hyperbolic dispersion for each momentum and frequency. Please note that not all hyperbolic dispersions in Fig. 2h cross all experimental momentum values, which is why the Q-factor asymmetry can only be evaluated at selected momentum values as shown for each frequency. Owing to the larger experimental uncertainty of the FWHM analysis (as compared with the peak position), we refrained from extrapolation during this procedure. Also note that the polariton dip shapes for k/k 0 = 1.03 (incidence angle θ = 26°) are strongly asymmetric (see Extended Data Fig. 4), such that the quality factor analysis is not very reliable there, explaining the outlier for which the Q-factor asymmetry is &lt;1. For all other cases, we find values clearly &gt;1, that is, we find consistently that the Q-factor is smaller on the left side than on the right side of the hyperbolic dispersion. Also, the data show a trend of increasing asymmetry with increasing momenta, that is, further out in the dispersion. Both effects are in very good agreement with the theoretical predictions (Fig. 3).
