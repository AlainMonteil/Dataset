        <p>The coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic has motivated a widespread effort to understand adaptation of its etiologic agent, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Similar to all viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is constantly evolving; mutants are selected due to a fitness advantage, which can be associated with an ability to spread more efficiently in the human population or to overcome natural or vaccine-mediated immune responses. Ongoing viral evolution is a major concern for direct antivirals, especially for therapeutics targeting the main proteins recognized by humoral immunity, such as the viral glycoproteins. Such mutations can provide a fitness advantage in the context of drug treatment; therefore they can be rapidly selected during therapy and may lead to treatment failure and/or spread of treatment resistant-associated variants. To date, multiple studies have investigated the development of viral resistance against neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Baum et al., 2020a;Liu et al., 2021b;Weisblum et al., 2020).The coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic has motivated a widespread effort to understand adaptation of its etiologic agent, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

        <p>REGEN-COV (previously known as REGN-COV2) is a cocktail of two fully human non-competing, neutralizing antibodies-casirivimab (REGN10933) and imdevimab (REGN10987)-that target the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and thereby prevent viral entry into the host cell (Hansen et al., 2020). The strategic decision to include a pair of highly potent non-competing antibodies that can simultaneously bind to distinct, non-overlapping epitopes of the RBD was made to safeguard against the rapid emergence of drug-resistant variants and provide coverage against circulating viral variants (Baum et al., 2020a). In vitro studies showed that combining two non-competing antibodies protected against rapid escape seen with its individual single-antibody components (Baum et al., 2020a). Additionally, the benefit of this combination approach has been supported by subsequent studies showing that REGEN-COV retains neutralization potency against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants potentially associated with increased infectivity (e.g., D614G and UK B.1.1.7 variants), as well as those associated with reduced vaccine-induced neutralization titers or vaccine efficacy (e.g., South Africa B.1.351), even when one of its components has partially reduced activity (Garcia-Beltran et al., 2021;Liu et al., 2021a;Madhi et al., 2021;Wang et al., 2021;Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020). Concerns regarding single antibody approaches in the clinic are emerging, based on increasing prevalence of naturally circulating variants resistant to these single agents (Wang et al., 2021), and reports within clinical studies that single antibody treatment is associated with the emergence of resistant (Food and Drug Administration, 2021).REGEN-COV (previously known as REGN-COV2) is a cocktail of two fully human non-competing, neutralizing antibodies-casirivimab (REGN10933) and imdevimab (REGN10987)-that target the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and thereby prevent viral entry into the host cell (Hansen et al., 2020).

        <p>Although in vitro escape studies using recombinant viruses strongly support the rationale of using non-competing antibody combinations to avoid drug resistance, questions remain regarding the relevance of these findings to authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus, to in vivo infection models, and most importantly, to the clinical setting. In this work, we first show that in vitro escape variants are rapidly selected against all individual clinical-stage antibodies targeting the RBD of the spike protein, independent of the targeted epitope or its degree of conservation, that such risk can be mitigated by utilizing combinations of two non-competing antibodies, and even further reduced by combining three noncompeting antibodies. We extend these findings by showing that escape variants can also be efficiently selected in vivo upon treatment with individual antibodies, independent of dosage or treatment setting (prophylaxis or therapy), whereas the REGEN-COV combination fully protects against development of such resistance. Importantly, we confirm these findings in humans; we investigated the genetic diversity of the entire spike protein across 4,882 samples from 1,000 outpatients or hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 from ongoing phase 1-3 trials (Weinreich et al., 2020(Weinreich et al., , 2021; https://clinicaltrials.gov; NCT04666441, NCT04426695, and NCT04452318). Analysis of baseline and post-treatment sequence diversity in placebo and REGEN-COVtreated patients demonstrated that the non-competing antibody combination protects against selection of drug resistant variants.Although in vitro escape studies using recombinant viruses strongly support the rationale of using non-competing antibody combinations to avoid drug resistance, questions remain regarding the relevance of these findings to authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus, to in vivo infection models, and most importantly, to the clinical setting.

        <p>We previously generated a large library of fully human monoclonal antibodies targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and selected REGN10933 + REGN10987 as a pair of potently neutralizing molecules that can simultaneously bind to their target (Hansen et al., 2020). We hypothesized that this noncompeting antibody combination would retain its potency as the virus evolves in the human population and safeguard against selection of escape mutants following treatment (Baum et al., 2020a;Tegally et al., 2020) With the recent rise in rapidly emerging variants, we are able to test this hypothesis by evaluating the potency of the individual antibodies as well as the REGEN-COV combination against variants of concern/interest as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.427/ B.1429 (California), B.1.351 (South Africa), P.1 (Brazil), B.1.526 (New York), and B.1.617.1/B.1.717.2/B.1.617.3 (India) lineages (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021;Davies et al., 2021;Nonaka et al., 2021;Tegally et al., 2020;West et al., 2021;Zhang et al., 2021) Importantly, even in instances where one of the antibodies is impacted, the combination retains full neutralization potency, a key property through which this combination of antibodies was originally selected, thus maintaining coverage against all assessed variants (Figures 1A and1B).We previously generated a large library of fully human monoclonal antibodies targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and selected REGN10933 + REGN10987 as a pair of potently neutralizing molecules that can simultaneously bind to their target (Hansen et al., 2020).

        <p>We have previously shown that combination therapy with two anti-spike antibodies targeting non-overlapping epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein minimizes the likelihood of rapid viral escape observed in vitro with monotherapy (Baum et al., 2020a), as has also been demonstrated by others (Dong et al., 2021;Weisblum et al., 2020). Expanding on our previous work using VSV-SARS-CoV-2-spike recombinant virus to monitor resistance to mAb treatment, we now performed such escape studies with several RBD-targeting mAbs approved under emergency use authorization (EUA) or in late-stage clinical trials and tested monotherapy as well as dual and triple combinations. We found that although only one to two passages led to complete virus resistance against all mAbs used as monotherapy, seven consecutive passages were needed to reach complete resistance to the REGEN-COV combination, requiring selection of multiple simultaneous mutations impacting each antibody (Figures 2A and 2B). Escape variants identified with COV2-2130, COV2-2196, and LY-COV555 antibodies were consistent with those previously described for these molecules (Table S1; Dong et al., 2021;Food and Drug Administration, 2021). Similar to the REGEN-COV combination, the COV2-2130 and COV2-2196 cocktail was also resistant to rapid escape, and full escape was associated with acquiring multiple mutations within the same virus (Figure 2A) (Dong et al., 2021). In contrast, the LY-CoV555/CB6 combination behaved similarly to monotherapy, where rapid escape driven by a single amino acid substitution was observed. Such rapid escape from combinations of competing antibodies has been demonstrated in our previous studies and is expected based on the overlapping nature of the LY-CoV555 and CB6 epitopes (Baum et al., 2020a;Jones et al., 2021;Shi et al., 2020;Starr et al., 2021).We have previously shown that combination therapy with two anti-spike antibodies targeting non-overlapping epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein minimizes the likelihood of rapid viral escape observed in vitro with monotherapy (Baum et al., 2020a), as has also been demonstrated by others (Dong et al., 2021;Weisblum et al., 2020).

        <p>Importantly, rapid escape observed in the monotherapy setting was independent of the targeted epitope or its sequence conservation because escape variants were rapidly selected against an antibody targeting a broad coronavirus epitope, VIR-7831 (Pinto et al., 2020;Figure 2A; Table S1). All VIR-7831 escape residues mapped to the published epitope of the antibody, and the resultant escape virus maintained its ability to replicate, indicating that these mutations were not deleterious to the virus (data not shown). Furthermore, the identified escape variants can be found in publicly available genome sequences (GISAID), indicating that they are tolerated by the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus and thus are likely to be selected under pressure. These experiments highlight the inherent risk of monotherapy against SARS-CoV-2 with any anti-spike mAb, regardless of the targeted epitope or its conservation.Importantly, rapid escape observed in the monotherapy setting was independent of the targeted epitope or its sequence conservation because escape variants were rapidly selected against an antibody targeting a broad coronavirus epitope, VIR-7831 (Pinto et al., 2020;Figure 2A; Table S1).

        <p>We have previously described a triple antibody combination against Zaire ebolavirus (Pascal et al., 2018), and we similarly decided to assess potential advantages of combining three noncompeting neutralizing mAbs targeting the RBD of SARS-CoV-2:REGN10933+REGN10987+REGN10985. As part of an effort to (A) Passage number during which the virus completely escaped neutralizing activity of the antibodies as evidenced by the cytopathic effect (CPE) is shown as ''complete escape'' for wells where antibody concentration was 10 mg/mL or above or ''partial escape'' for wells where antibody concentration was 1-10 mg/mL. (B) Neutralization potency of the two mAb REGN10987+REGN10933 combination and the three mAb REGN10987+REGN10933+ REGN10987+REGN10985 combination along with individual mAbs. Data represent three technical replicates. (C) Two views of the RBD-REGN10933-REGN10987-REGN10985 model. RBD is colored white; REGN10933 is shown blue, REGN10987 is shown in red and REGN10985 is shown in green. Surface representation of the RBD in white with contact patches for each antibody, colors as in (A). See also Figure S4 and Table S1. structurally characterize our SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, we determined a cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of REGN10985 (plus another antibody, REGN10989) bound to RBD (Figure S1). REGN10985 binds to a broad patch on the side of the RBD, directly below the region contacted by ACE2. Although there is very little overlap between the ACE2 and REGN10985 contact surfaces on the RBD, the REGN10985 Fab is angled so that it overlaps with the space that ACE2 would occupy, making this antibody a direct blocker of ACE2 binding like REGN10933 and REGN10987. By combining this cryo-EM structure with our previously determined structure of REGN10933+REGN10987+RBD (Hansen et al., 2020), we produced a model of the three-antibody complex showing that all three mAbs are able to bind simultaneously to the RBD of the spike protein in a non-overlapping fashion (Figure 2C). We additionally demonstrated that the three-antibody combination has similar neutralization potency as REGEN-COV (Figure 2B). We found that addition of the third non-competing RBD mAb further increased protection against viral escape, with no loss of antiviral potency observed through eleven consecutive passages (Figure 2A; Table S1). These results demonstrate that a three-mAb neutralizing non-competing combination targeting the spike RBD provides a potential further advantage as a SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic.We have previously described a triple antibody combination against Zaire ebolavirus (Pascal et al., 2018), and we similarly decided to assess potential advantages of combining three noncompeting neutralizing mAbs targeting the RBD of SARS-CoV-2:REGN10933+REGN10987+REGN10985.

        <p>To understand how these in vitro escape findings demonstrating that mAb combination treatments safeguard against development of drug resistance translate to a more physiological setting, we evaluated virus evolution in vivo following mAb administration as both monotherapy (REGN10987 or REGN10933) and as the RE-GEN-COV combination in the SARS-CoV-2 hamster challenge model. Animals were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/ 2020) and treated with either high or low dose (50 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg) of either REGN10987 or REGN10933 as monotherapy or with the REGEN-COV combination (50 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg) in both prophylactic and treatment settings (Figure 3A). These doses were previously shown to provide partial or complete efficacy in this animal model with REGEN-COV (Baum et al., 2020b). Lungs from infected animals were collected on day 7 post-challenge, presumably after the virus has had an opportunity to go through multiple rounds of replication, to isolate viral RNA. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis was used to detect variants in the spike protein present even at low frequencies in the virus population (&gt;5%). To identify putative treatment resistant variants, we focused our analysis on the spike RBD, where the REGEN-COV antibodies are known to bind and where all previously identified resistant variants to either antibody are located. Analysis of the RBD sequence in saline-treated animals did not reveal any variants, indicating that in the absence of treatment the virus is not under strong selection pressure in this model (Figures 3B and 3C). However, several variants in the RBD were identified in animals treated with either of the single antibodies as monotherapy (Figures 3B and 3C). Remarkably, our analysis demonstrated selection of resistance variants in almost half (18/40) of monotherapy-treated animals versus none (0/20) of the animals treated with the REGEN-COV combination. Out of the 7 RBD variants identified in monotherapy-treated animals, 6 have been previously described as resistance variants or mapped to the same amino acid position as other resistance variants to either REGN10933 or REGN10987 (Table S3). Four of these variants were previously identified in our in vitro escape studies, validating the relevance of using VSV-SARS-CoV-2-spike recombinant virus to identify SARS-CoV-2 escape mutations (Baum et al., 2020a). Interestingly, variant selection occurred with monotherapy treatment in both the prophylactic and therapeutic settings, and in both low and high dose groups. Although rare unique variants outside of the RBD were also identified in a single animal treated with the REGEN-COV combination (Figures 3B and 3C), the low frequency of these variants and their location well outside the epitopes of the antibodies make it extremely unlikely that they were associated with the REGEN-COV treatment.To understand how these in vitro escape findings demonstrating that mAb combination treatments safeguard against development of drug resistance translate to a more physiological setting, we evaluated virus evolution in vivo following mAb administration as both monotherapy (REGN10987 or REGN10933) and as the RE-GEN-COV combination in the SARS-CoV-2 hamster challenge model.

        <p>To assess the emergence of drug resistance in REGEN-COVtreated COVID-19 patients, we characterized the genetic diversity of 1,336 and 3,546 SARS-CoV-2 RNA samples isolated from 272 hospitalized and 728 non-hospitalized individuals, respectively, at baseline and several time points post mAb cocktail administration (Table S2). In both hospitalized and non-hospitalized study groups, patients were randomly as-signed (1:1:1) to receive placebo, 2.4 g of REGEN-COV, or 8.0 g of REGEN-COV, and patient samples were collected at multiple time points from baseline (day 1) to study end point (day 29). RNA-seq analysis was performed to characterize the genetic diversity of the spike sequence from all swabs positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by qRT-PCR. Minor variants present at a frequency of at least 15% in the virus population were identified. In total, 244 and 514 amino acid changes were identified across all samples from hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients, respectively. For both studies, variant counts and frequencies in all three treatment groups were similar, indicating that REGEN-COV did not increase spike protein diversity relative to placebo (Table S2).To assess the emergence of drug resistance in REGEN-COVtreated COVID-19 patients, we characterized the genetic diversity of 1,336 and 3,546 SARS-CoV-2 RNA samples isolated from 272 hospitalized and 728 non-hospitalized individuals, respectively, at baseline and several time points post mAb cocktail administration (Table S2).

        <p>To determine whether REGEN-COV treatment contributed to selection of resistant variants in the spike protein, we longitudinally compared the frequency of minor variants in each patient from all available RT-PCR-positive samples. Among all patient samples from the hospitalized group, we identified a total of 89, 87, and 108 amino acid changes in the placebo, low dose-, and high dose-treated groups, respectively. These mutations were evenly spread across the entire spike protein sequence (Figures 4A and4B). The low number of variants in the RBD found among samples from patients treated with REGEN-COV further demonstrated lack of treatment emergent selection relative to placebo (15 RBD variants in placebo versus 12 low-dose/12 high-dose in REGEN-COV-treated group). Only 17% (42/244) of all amino acid changes were observed at more than one time point in at least one patient (Figure 4B) indicating that the vast majority of variants were lost over time likely as a result of lack of fitness or population bottlenecks. Three of these variants were found in the RBD in the REGEN-COV-treated groups only (S477N, N501T, and K537R). The S477N variant was present in 7 REGEN-COV-treated patients at multiple time points, including baseline (Figure S2).

Of note, in all patients, the three variants were identified at baseline or earliest time points (&lt;5 days after REGEN-COV treatment), and no significant increase in their frequencies between early and late time points were observed indicating absence of treatment-related selection.To determine whether REGEN-COV treatment contributed to selection of resistant variants in the spike protein, we longitudinally compared the frequency of minor variants in each patient from all available RT-PCR-positive samples. Among all patient samples from the hospitalized group, we identified a total of 89, 87, and 108 amino acid changes in the placebo, low dose-, and high dose-treated groups, respectively.

        <p>The increasing use of mAbs as a clinically validated therapeutic option against SARS-CoV-2 raises questions about which of these therapies may be impacted by circulating and rapidly emerging variants and which may induce treatment-emergent resistance. The recent recognition that some immunodominant residues in the spike protein, such as E484K, often impact both mAb therapies and vaccine-induced immune responses makes it imperative to ensure that mAb treatments not only provide protection against common circulating variants but to also ensure that treatment-induced escape variants are not seeded into the population, where they may contribute to undermining S2 andS4.The increasing use of mAbs as a clinically validated therapeutic option against SARS-CoV-2 raises questions about which of these therapies may be impacted by circulating and rapidly emerging variants and which may induce treatment-emergent resistance.

        <p>To date, we and others have identified antibody resistant variants through in vitro escape studies and have demonstrated that combinations of two non-competing antibodies provide protection against rapid viral escape (Baum et al., 2020a;Weisblum et al., 2020). We hypothesized that a cocktail of three noncompeting antibodies could further delay emergence of resistance. Although neutralizing antibodies against the N-terminal domain (NTD) of spike has been described (Liu et al., 2020), this region is frequently deleted in emerging variants (Wang et al., 2021), and therefore such molecules are not ideal as therapeutics. We thus screened for, and identified, a third, noncompeting, RBD-binding mAb and now show that a triple antibody combination containing this mAb is even less susceptible to escape than the double combination.To date, we and others have identified antibody resistant variants through in vitro escape studies and have demonstrated that combinations of two non-competing antibodies provide protection against rapid viral escape (Baum et al., 2020a;Weisblum et al., 2020).

        <p>However, the question regarding the relevance of these in vitro escape studies remains, and it is important to examine viral dynamics under therapeutic antibody pressure in more relevant settings, including in in vivo efficacy models and in treated patients. Our study provides evidence that in vitro escape studies with recombinant virus are highly predictive of in vivo selection. Indeed, we are able to show that in animals and in humans, the relative risk of selecting for spike variants that are resistant to treatment is predicted by in vitro findings. Treatment with the single antibody components of the REGEN-COV combination results in rapid selection of escape variants, whereas the combination protects against viral escape in vitro, in vivo, and in COVID-19 patients.

To date, the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data has come from global surveillance efforts and reporting of consensus sequences that include fixed mutations in isolates obtained from independent individuals. This is a large-scale report describing, within individual patients, the longitudinal evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus population. Moreover, this study evaluates the effects of antiviral antibody treatment on virus evolution in humans. As predicted by our in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies, treatment with the RE-GEN-COV cocktail in the clinic did not seemingly select for resistant variants nor appreciably alter virus evolution. Our approach allowed us to observe minor variants, and our data indicate the vast majority of infected individuals are already harboring spike protein variants at baseline, prior to use of any antiviral agent and before natural immunity is established, as half of the study participants had not yet mounted an antiviral immune response at baseline (Weinreich et al., 2020). Indeed, from our clinical sequencing data, we can observe multiple variants in amino acid residues identified in our in vitro escape studies expected to impact clinical antibody candidates, including VIR-7831 (P337, T345) and COV-2196 (G476) as well as our own individual antibodies. This clearly demonstrates that the SARS-CoV-2 circulating population is highly heterogeneous in infected patients and the large reservoir of existing (or future) minor variants could be readily selected under the right selective pressure conditions. Indeed, treatment-emergent resistant variants have been reported in clinical studies in which patients were treated with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody monotherapy (FDA, 2021).Understanding pathogen population diversity and selection within the infected host has important implications for understanding virus evolution and resistance processes and for proper S2 andS4. identification of appropriate drug treatments.

        <p>Although the REGEN-COV combination maintains its neutralization potency against all variants of interest/concern to date, one of its components (REGN10933) demonstrates partially decreased potency against some variants. This highlights the potential risk that even non-competing combination therapies may not retain their full advantages in some geographical regions with high prevalence of select variants of concern. Thus, active surveillance of circulating viruses and development of next-generation antibody combinations where multiple components maintain coverage against emerging variants should be an important focus for the future of antiviral mAb therapeutics. This type of approach will require agility and may need to be analogous to the framework applied to seasonal updates of influenza vaccine components, where new anti-spike mAbs are substituted or added as necessary to maintain optimal efficacy against a rapidly mutating pathogen.Although the REGEN-COV combination maintains its neutralization potency against all variants of interest/concern to date, one of its components (REGN10933) demonstrates partially decreased potency against some variants.

        <p>The current study focused on assessing the likelihood of identifying REGEN-COV-mediated selection of resistant viral variants in treated COVID-19 patients and overall predictability of preclin-ical in vitro and in vivo escape studies to human patients. Our data clearly demonstrated that treatment with any RBD-directed mAb monotherapy results in rapid selection of drug-resistant viral variants. However, although we did not identify any clear selection of resistant variants in the clinical population after treatment with REGEN-COV, it was impossible for us to directly compare monotherapy and combination therapy in the clinical setting due to the combination nature of our therapeutic. Thorough sequencing of viral samples post-treatment with clinical monotherapy products may help to provide clinical data on likelihood of resistance in that setting.

Variants were cloned into the spike expression plasmid using site-directed mutagenesis and pseudoparticles were produced as described above.Non-replicative pseudoparticles were generated as previously described (Baum et al., 2020a). Human codon-optimized SARS-CoV-2 spike (MN908947.3) was cloned into an expression plasmid. A total of 1.2 3 107 HEK293T cells (ATCC CRL-3216) were seeded overnight in 15-cm dishes in DMEM without glutamine (Life Technologies) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies), and Penicillin-Streptomycin-L-Glutamine (Life Technologies). The following day, the cells were transfected with 15ug spike expression plasmid with Lipofectamine LTX (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer's protocol. At 24 hours post transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and infected at a MOI of 1 with the VSV-DG-Fluc-2A-GFP/VSV-G virus diluted in 10mL Opti-MEM (Life Technologies). The cells were incubated 1 hour at 37C with 5% CO2.

        <p>Escape studies were performed with recombinant VSV-SARS-CoV-2-Spike virus as previously described (Baum et al., 2020a). Escape variants were selected by incubating VSV-SARS-CoV-2-Spike under antibody pressure ranging from 0.016ug/mL to 50ug/mL. After 30 minutes of incubation, the mixture was used to infect 2.5x10^5 Vero (ATCC: CCL-81) or 3x10^5 Vero E6 (ATCC CRL-1586) cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5. Virus replication was monitored by screening for cytopathic effect over 96 hours. The supernatant and cellular RNA was collected from the wells with the highest antibody concentration with evident virus replication. The RNA was then subjected to RNaseq to identify spike protein variants. For subsequent rounds of selection,100uL of supernatant containing the virus was passaged under the same or greater antibody concentrations as in previous passages until complete CPE was observed after antibody treatment at concentration of R 10 ug/mL.Escape studies were performed with recombinant VSV-SARS-CoV-2-Spike virus as previously described (Baum et al., 2020a).

An initial set of particles picked using blob picker were subjected to 2D classification to generate templates for template picking. $5.5 million particles picked by template picking were subjected to multiple rounds of 2D classification to remove unbound Fabs and particles containing an incomplete complex, resulting in 607,309 'good' complex particles. Ab initio reconstruction with 6 classes generated a single class containing 146,054 particles that corresponded to the full REGN10985 Fab -REGN10989 Fab -RBD complex. Non-uniform refinement of the particles in this class followed by local refinement resulted in a 3.3 A ˚resolution (FSC = 0.143) map that was used for model building.
