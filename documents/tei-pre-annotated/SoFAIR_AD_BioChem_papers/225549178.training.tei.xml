        <p>The potential of microRNAs (miRNA) as non-invasive diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers, as well as therapeutic targets, has recently been recognized. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of consistency in the methodology used, but to our knowledge, no study has described the methodology of sample preparation and storage systematically with respect to miRNAs as blood biomarkers. The aim of this study was to investigate the stability of miRNAs in blood under various relevant clinical and research conditions: different collection tubes, storage at different temperatures, physical disturbance, as well as serial freeze-thaw cycles.The potential of microRNAs (miRNA) as non-invasive diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers, as well as therapeutic targets, has recently been recognized.

        <p>The potential importance of circulating microRNA (miRNA) as non-invasive diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers, as well as therapeutic targets has been given great attention [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. MiRNAs are a class of small non-protein-coding RNA molecules that play an essential role in gene regulation at the post-transcriptional level by causing messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation or inhibiting mRNA translation into protein [8][9][10][11][12][13]. More than 2,500 miRNAs have been found in humans [14], and these appear to regulate 60% of the human protein-coding genes [15]. With the discovery of miRNAs being expressed in clinical samples such as plasma/serum [2,[16][17][18][19][20], urine [21,22], and other bodyfluids [23,24] miRNAs have evolved as potential biomarkers that may provide insights into the underlying pathophysiological condition of a disease. Furthermore miRNAs have the potential of being used for diagnostic purposes, and thereby guiding treatment strategies. However, when used as clinical biomarkers, attention must be paid to the stability of miRNAs given the various conditions the clinical samples are processed with respect to the specific methodology and source of biological material (e.g., whole blood, plasma or serum) [25,26]. While RNA molecules are known to be highly unstable, previous studies have indicated that miRNAs are remarkably stable in plasma and serum, and resistant to RNase activity, as well as extreme pH and multiple numbers of freeze-thaw cycles [2,16,17]. However, studies characterizing and quantifying biomarkers in heart failure and atrial fibrillation patients were lacking consistent and reproducible results concerning quantification of the miRNA concentration in blood samples of patients [27]. One possible explanation could be an inconsistency in the methodology used. Previous studies have highlighted that confounding methodological factors should be ruled out [25,26,28]. To our knowledge, no study has described the methodology of sample preparation and storage systematically with respect to miRNAs as blood biomarkers. It is not known whether the time between blood collection and processing of plasma/serum or physical disturbance of the samples affects the miRNA levels and the reproducibility of results. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the stability of miRNA expression in whole blood and plasma/serum under various relevant clinical and research conditions in several types of collection tubes.The potential importance of circulating microRNA (miRNA) as non-invasive diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers, as well as therapeutic targets has been given great attention [1][2][3][4][5][6][7].

        <p>This study was conducted in two different centers (Copenhagen, Denmark and Munich, Germany). Blood samples were collected from 6 healthy donors (4 males and 2 females) in Copenhagen, and 6 healthy donors (3 males and 3 females) in Munich. All were of Caucasian ethnicity, except of 2 Asians in the Copenhagen cohort. For each study, whole blood was collected by venous puncture with butterfly needles into 6 ml serum separator and/or anticoagulant (salts of EDTA, lithium-heparin (at both study sites) and citrate (only at Copenhagen site)) containing tubes at the same blood draw. All tubes were inverted 10 times for mixing immediately after collection, and before further processing and storage. Participants provided written informed consent before participation, and the study was conducted according to the guidelines of The National Committee on Health Research Ethics, Denmark, and The Local Ethics Committee of the University of Munich, Germany. All data used in this study were analyzed anonymously and according to the health research ethics committee system in Denmark and the project did not need approval by the committees.

        <p>Since the expression of miRNAs in the blood is very low, spectrophotometry is not reliable for quantification. In order to compensate for potential variations we added cel-miR-39 as a loading control (see above) and used a fixed volume of input RNA eluate as it was described before [16]. Total cDNA was synthesized from total RNA (5 μl), following the manufacturer´s instructions.

        <p>To mimic clinical blood sample handling, the stability of miRNAs incubated at room temperature for various duration was evaluated. In the Copenhagen cohort we measured miRNA levels in EDTA-treated whole blood samples. At different experimental time points (0, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 72 h) whole blood was processed to plasma (Fig 2). These time points were chosen to represent typical short-term transport and storage conditions in the clinical laboratory. Significant changes in the miRNA levels after 72 h were observed for miR-21 (p&lt;0.01) and miR-29b (p&lt;0.01). However, miRNA concentrations were stable in whole blood at room temperature for at least 24 h (p = 0.50 for miR-21 and p = 0.16 for miR-29b compared to T0). In the Munich cohort we evaluated time-dependent effects on miR-1 and miR-21 levels in already separated fractions of EDTA plasma and serum plasma samples in addition to whole blood samples at room temperature after 24 h and 4 d (Fig 3). We could confirm the results from the Copenhagen cohort demonstrating that miR-21 levels in EDTA-treated whole blood are stable for at least 24 h (Fig 3A). In tubes containing serum separator miR-21 was stable only for up to 24 h (Fig 3B ) whereas miR-1 levels were stable up to 4 d. Separated plasma or serum fractions showed significantly reduced miRNA levels after incubation for 24 h or 4 d (Fig 3C and3D).To mimic clinical blood sample handling, the stability of miRNAs incubated at room temperature for various duration was evaluated.

        <p>To evaluate the effect of physical disturbances (e.g. transportation of blood samples from one center to another center) different samples (EDTA whole blood, serum whole blood, EDTA plasma fraction, serum fraction) were placed on a shaker for 1 or 8 h (Fig 4). The miRNA expression of both miR-1 and miR-21 decreased significantly after 8 h of physical disturbance in the separated plasma fraction (Fig 4C). In the serum fraction the results showed a more stable profile revealing just a slight non-significant trend for a decreased concentration over time (Fig 4D). Furthermore, we compared if the effect of physical disturbance differs in whole blood vs. the separated fractions (plasma and serum). MiRNA expression in EDTA-treated whole blood was stable after 1 or 8 h of disturbance (Fig 4A ), in serum whole blood we observed a significant reduction in miR-1 expression after 8 h whereas miR-21 expression remained stable (Fig 4B). These results suggest no preventive effect of fraction separation prior to mechanical stress.To evaluate the effect of physical disturbances (e.g. transportation of blood samples from one center to another center) different samples (EDTA whole blood, serum whole blood, EDTA plasma fraction, serum fraction) were placed on a shaker for 1 or 8 h (Fig 4).

        <p>Next, we investigated whether long term storage at -80˚C had any effect on miRNA stability, by examining the effect of storage conditions on miRNA expression. The analysis revealed that storage of separated plasma at -80˚C for 9 months had no significant effect on miR-21 and miR-29b levels (p = 0.11 and p = 0.96, respectively), while the concentration of free miRNAs in whole blood increased during storage at -80˚C for both miRNAs over time (+3.47±0.83, p&lt;0.01 for miR-21 and +2.56±1.09, p = 0.04 for miR-29b) (Fig 5).Next, we investigated whether long term storage at -80˚C had any effect on miRNA stability, by examining the effect of storage conditions on miRNA expression.

        <p>This study highlights several variables that could affect the concentration of miRNAs in whole blood and in plasma/serum samples, respectively. To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide detailed methodological information regarding the role of miRNAs as biomarkers, which have to be taken into account for generating reliable and representative data for use in clinical routine. We demonstrated that the type of collection tubes, preparation, handling and storage of samples should be standardized to avoid confounding variables influencing the results and to provide a solid basis for comparison of results between studies.This study highlights several variables that could affect the concentration of miRNAs in whole blood and in plasma/serum samples, respectively.

        <p>Collection of whole blood is the first step in the preparation of plasma and serum, and is important for accurate analysis of miRNA expressions. The blood tubes containing serum separator or the anticoagulants, EDTA and citrate, do not significantly change the detectible levels of miRNAs. In contrast, the presence of lithium-heparin makes detection of the three miRNAs impossible. Both plasma and serum samples have been used for circulating miRNA analysis [20], and although all tubes used in our study were effective (except lithium-heparin), there were subtle differences for miRNA-expression in EDTA plasma vs. citrate plasma vs. serum fraction samples. Previous studies have shown that different centrifugation protocols can produce platelet-rich or platelet-poor plasma, which could lead to different amounts of blood cell contamination in these fluids [30], and the coagulation process may also affect the concentration of miRNAs [26]. Furthermore, the samples of the Munich cohort showed a larger variability of serum results in comparison to plasma EDTA (data not shown). This data indicates that samples collected from different blood tubes and blood fractions should not be included in the same study or directly compared to each other, in order to avoid confounding of the results.Collection of whole blood is the first step in the preparation of plasma and serum, and is important for accurate analysis of miRNA expressions.

        <p>Previous studies have shown that plasma miRNAs are stable under various conditions [16,20]. We found a significant change in the miR-21 and miR-29b levels after 72 h of incubation of whole blood at room temperature, yet no changes were observed after 24 h at room temperature. These findings indicate that miRNAs may be released from blood cells and platelets, and argues for storing only processed samples (plasma or serum) rather than whole blood. Our study is in line with previous studies reporting only small variations in plasma miRNA levels at room temperature up to 24 h [2,20], and indicates that the storage of whole blood at room temperature under clinical conditions for extended periods of time (at least up to 24 h) prior to the separation of plasma does not appear to affect plasma miRNA concentrations. Nevertheless, separated fractions of plasma seem to be less stable showing significant changes already within 24 h after blood collection and separation. In view of these results it is important to keep in mind that samples should still be processed as fast as possible or in a systemic temporal fashion. In case of a longer blood processing periods whole blood samples should be preferred. Still, the possibility that the stability of distinct miRNAs may be different should be taken into account; the result of this study only reflects the stability of miR-1, miR-21, and miR-29b.Previous studies have shown that plasma miRNAs are stable under various conditions [16,20].

        <p>Physical disturbance resulted in decreased levels of miRNAs in whole blood and separated fractions of plasma and serum. The difference was only significant for serum whole blood and separated plasma after 8 h of disturbance, but a trend towards a decrease over time was detectable for all the measurements. However, whole blood samples seem to be more robust than the separated fractions in conditions of physical stress, but they still show a similar trend of decreasing miRNA levels over time. So far, no report on miRNA stability in whole blood, plasma or serum during transport or physical disturbance has been published. The reason for the reduced miRNA expression after disturbance remains highly speculative. It is not very likely that contaminating cells (e.g. platelets) are the reason since lysis of cells would result in increased miRNA expression. A potential explanation is plasma inhibitors that might be activated by mechanical disturbance, i.e. shaking might provide sufficient activation energy for inhibitors to become active. Nevertheless, translating our results into a clinical practice longterm physical disturbance of blood samples, e.g., in context of transportation, should be avoided to prevent artificial altered results of miRNA concentration.Physical disturbance resulted in decreased levels of miRNAs in whole blood and separated fractions of plasma and serum.

        <p>In our study long-time storage at -80˚C had no significant effect on miRNA expression up to 9 months after freezing for either miR-21 or miR-29b in EDTA plasma samples. In contrast, increased levels of free miRNA in whole blood samples were found 9 months after freezing. These findings indicate that miRNAs may be released from blood cells and platelets, and argues for storing only processed samples (plasma or serum) rather than whole blood. Additionally, a previous study has shown that hemolysis during sample preparation can change the level of miRNAs, producing artificially high miRNA concentrations [31].In our study long-time storage at -80˚C had no significant effect on miRNA expression up to 9 months after freezing for either miR-21 or miR-29b in EDTA plasma samples.

        <p>MiRNA levels (miR-1 and miR-21) were decreased after four repetitive freeze-thaw cycles in plasma and serum. A similar effect has been shown previously by Zhao et al. [32]. They evaluated miR-346 and miR-134 and could demonstrate reduced miRNA levels in samples that were frozen/thawed. The effect observed in our study was not as striking but may be mimic a biological signal. Interestingly, Farina et al. observed the opposite effect [33]. In their study the serum expression of several miRNAs, including miR-21, was increased after two freezethaw cycles. These results suggest that multiple measurements of a frozen sample should be done with caution for direct comparison of results. Assuming a systematic effect, the relative changes between groups should be less pronounced, but are not predictable.MiRNA levels (miR-1 and miR-21) were decreased after four repetitive freeze-thaw cycles in plasma and serum.

        <p>Human blood consists of RBC (erythrocytes), platelets, and white blood cells (leukocytes, buffy coat) suspended in plasma. We found that both miR-21 and miR-29b are present in all 3 blood fractions and that they are differentially distributed in the fractions. This underscores the danger of contamination of the plasma by cells from the cellular pellet during aspiration or hemolysis.Human blood consists of RBC (erythrocytes), platelets, and white blood cells (leukocytes, buffy coat) suspended in plasma.

        <p>In the current study we focused on miR-1, miR-21 and miR-29b, however, we do acknowledge that the stability of these miRNAs may not be representative of all miRNAs in plasma, including miRNAs with either higher or lower expression level. Whether these results can be extrapolated to other miRNAs requires additional studies. Furthermore, we only studied a small number of individuals, which bears the potential of false-negative results due to insufficient statistical power. However, even within this small number of individuals we were able to identify potential variables affecting results which should be considered before initiating a clinical study. The majority of the study persons were Caucasians. Therefore, our results cannot be generalized to other non-Caucasian individuals. It could be speculated that the stability of the miRNAs may be confounding due to slightly different processing protocols in the two centres. However, this highlights even more the importance of standardized methodology. Another limitation of our study is the lack of a reliable housekeeping miRNA for normalization. Although some miRNAs are supposed to be stably expressed in human blood (e.g. miR-16), we could see significant variation of these miRNAs when measuring a large set of patient samples from our institution's biobank (unpublished data). Therefore, we used cel-miR-39 as a spiked-in control as described above.In the current study we focused on miR-1, miR-21 and miR-29b, however, we do acknowledge that the stability of these miRNAs may not be representative of all miRNAs in plasma, including miRNAs with either higher or lower expression level.

        <p>This study aimed to investigate how variation in preparing and handling samples could influence the analysis of circulating miRNA in clinical practice. We found that miR-1, miR-21 and miR-29b levels are stable for at least 24 h at room temperature in whole blood. Storage of samples at -80˚C extended the miRNA stability remarkably, however, miRNA levels in long-term stored (9 months) whole blood samples were significantly changed, which is in contrast to the plasma samples, where miRNA levels were found to be stable. Furthermore, we found that disturbance of the plasma/serum sample as well as repetitive freeze-thaw cycles result in reduced miRNA levels. This study highlights the importance of proper and standardized sample collection and preparation. Our data suggest that standardized procedures are required to overcome challenges with miRNA stability, thus enabling the use of miRNAs as non-invasive diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers that provide valid results and the option of comparability.This study aimed to investigate how variation in preparing and handling samples could influence the analysis of circulating miRNA in clinical practice.
