        <p>Many environmental factors influence the gut microbiome, including diet, medication usage 4,5 and host genetics. Heritability studies have estimated that human genetics could explain from 1.9% to 8.1% of gut microbiome variation 6,7 . This observation drove the first efforts to identify genomic loci that influence gut microbiota through genome-wide association studies (GWASs). These early gut microbiome GWASs identified several microbial quantitative trait loci (mbQTLs) located in genes related to the intestinal mucosal barrier, immune response and drug and food metabolism [8][9][10][11] . However, the reproducibility of these findings has been limited by differences in data processing methodologies, modest sample sizes and strong environmental effects, which, taken together, limit the detection of robust host genetic associations 12 . A recent large-scale genome-wide meta-analysis of 24 cohorts replicated the association between Bifidobacterium abundance and the lactase (LCT) gene locus 13 , which had previously been reported in single-cohort studies 6,14 . Other suggestive mbQTLs identified in this broad meta-analysis were proportional to heritability estimates from independent twin studies, indicating that additional loci found at lenient levels of significance are likely to be real but larger sample sizes are needed to reach sufficient statistical power 13 . Nonetheless, meta-analyses of mbQTL studies are still underpowered due to the high levels of heterogeneity between cohorts. On top of this, many existing cohorts rely on 16 S rRNA measurements, which do not allow for bacterial identification at species-level resolution or for identification of bacterial pathway abundances. Indeed, measuring both species and pathway abundances is essential for a further understanding of an individual's microbiome; pathways may be shared across distant microbial species and have the same biological effect 15 . mbQTL studies using shotgun metagenomic sequencing in large cohorts are therefore needed to overcome the variability in microbiome definition to reveal robust associations.Many environmental factors influence the gut microbiome, including diet, medication usage 4,5 and host genetics.

        <p>Association at LCT affects multiple taxa and pathways. Given that lactose tolerance is inherited in a dominant fashion, we tested the associations found in this locus using a dominant model for the alternative allele at SNP rs182549 and thereby compared lactase-persistent (LP) and lactose-intolerant (LI) individuals. Indeed, all seven taxa associated with the LCT locus at genome-wide significance showed a stronger association signal when we used a dominant model (all associations P &lt; 2 × 10 -27 ), with increased taxa abundance in LI individuals (Supplementary Table 3). The associations seen at the family level could mostly be accounted for by species B. adolescentis (no significant difference in effect size, Cochran's Q P value &gt; 0.05), whereas smaller effects were seen for species B. longum and B. bifidum (Cochran's Q P values when comparing effect sizes with those observed for B. adolescentis were 0.018 and 0.003). Moreover, the association with these species remained unchanged when adding B. adolescentis to the association models, indicating that the associations are independent and not driven by species correlation.Association at LCT affects multiple taxa and pathways.

        <p>We further tested the other 200 taxa for this SNP and the dominant model. Intriguingly, we observed suggestive association (P &lt; 1 × 10 -4 ) at rs182549 with taxa that were associated with the ABO locus in our GWAS (Collinsella genus and species B. bifidum and C. aerofaciens) and for the species Roseburia inulinivorans of the family Lachnospiraceae (Supplementary Table 3). For all but Roseburia inulinivorans, there was a consistent direction of effect across the associated taxa, with increased abundance in LI compared with LP individuals (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 2). The associations seen with several taxa suggest that this locus has a wide-ranging effect on microbiome composition.We further tested the other 200 taxa for this SNP and the dominant model.

        <p>Finally, when comparing the abundance of bacterial pathways between the LI and LP groups, we observed a higher abundance of the LACTOSECAT-PWY in LI individuals (effect = +0.300 in s.d. units, s.e. = 0.049, P = 1.02 × 10 -9 ). This is not surprising given that in our dataset, this pathway correlates mostly with class Actinobacteria and species B. adolescentis (Spearman correlation [r S ], 0.73 and 0.69, respectively), which are both associated with SNPs at the LCT locus.Finally, when comparing the abundance of bacterial pathways between the LI and LP groups, we observed a higher abundance of the LACTOSECAT-PWY in LI individuals (effect = +0.300 in s.d. units, s.e. = 0.049, P = 1.02 × 10 -9 ).

        <p>Associations at ABO are dependent on secretor status. To further understand the mechanisms underlying the association signals at the ABO locus, we derived blood-group types based on the genotype status of three genetic variants (Methods). The majority of the individuals were either type A (40%) or type O (48%), as expected 21 . Genetic associations at this locus could be explained by differences between individuals with non-O blood type and O blood type. Individuals with blood type O had the highest observed abundance of B. bifidum compared with other blood-type groups (Wilcoxon test blood type, A vs. O: P = 2.3 × 10 -14 , blood type B vs. O: P = 0.007, blood type AB vs. O: P = 0.006), whereas higher abundances of Collinsella and the pathway LACTOSECAT-PWY were observed in individuals with blood type A compared with individuals with blood type O (Wilcoxon test for Collinsella, blood type O vs. A: P = 2.8 × 10 -9 , for metabolic pathway, blood type O vs. A: P = 5 × 10 -14 ) (Fig. 3).Associations at ABO are dependent on secretor status.

        <p>Notably, all these associations were present only in individuals able to expose A/B antigens to gut bacteria (secretors) and were absent in nonsecretors, with secretor status being determined by a functional variant in the FUT2 gene (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Note). This observation is in line with recent studies showing that association at the ABO locus with microbiome depends on FUT2 genotypes 18,22 . Associations of functional variants in the FUT2 gene with other bacterial taxa were observed in a recent meta-analysis 13 , but none of the bacterial taxa or pathways analyzed showed significant association at this locus in our cohort.Notably, all these associations were present only in individuals able to expose A/B antigens to gut bacteria (secretors) and were absent in nonsecretors, with secretor status being determined by a functional variant in the FUT2 gene (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Note).

        <p>The novel associations with species levels at ABO, including that with B. bifidum, are intriguing. Early genomic analyses suggest that among Bifidobacterium, B. bifidum is particularly adapted to the human gastrointestinal mucosa because of a unique set of genes encoding for enzymes involved in the degradation and utilization of mucin, the main component of gastrointestinal mucosa 23,24 . The degradation activity of the mucosa, where antigens are secreted, could explain the association with differences in B. bifidum abundance at ABO modulated by FUT2. This mechanism has been proposed for the association with Collinsella genus 18 , and it is likely to also apply to the novel associations we identified with C. aerofaciens and LACTOSECAT-PWY pathway abundances. Genetic associations may be modulated by diet. Gut microbiome composition and function are known to be affected by several factors, including sex, body mass index (BMI), diet and medication usage 4 . None of our 37 SNP-trait genome-wide significant associations were attenuated when including BMI, medication usage, stool frequency or stool consistency as covariates (Methods; for all comparisons, Cochran's Q for difference in effect size P &gt; 0.05), indicating that these associations are independent and not confounded by these factors (Supplementary Table 4a). Furthermore, none showed evidence for being a sex-specific effect, although five did exhibit a smaller genetic effect in females compared to males (Supplementary Table 4b).The novel associations with species levels at ABO, including that with B. bifidum, are intriguing.

        <p>We also investigated the effect of diet at the LCT and ABO loci, considering the dominant inheritance model at LCT and the observed dependence on secretor status at ABO. We considered dietary factors previously associated (false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05) with microbial taxa and pathway abundances that show genome-wide association signals in the ABO and LCT loci (Methods) 16 . In an analysis that included age, sex and genetic and dietary factors, the dietary factors did not significantly attenuate the effect of the genetic components, suggesting that diet is not a source of bias in these genetic associations (Supplementary Table 5). Nonetheless, diet remained an important factor after correction for genetic factors. Four taxa and one pathway associated with LCT and ABO SNPs were statistically associated with at least one dietary factor (P &lt; 0.05) (Supplementary Table 5), with a maximum of 16 factors found for B. longum. We further tested these associated dietary (44 diet-microbiome pairs) factors for interaction with genetics and detected evidence for a gene-diet interaction for only one taxon at the LCT locus. Specifically, we observed an increased abundance of the Bifidobacteriaceae family in LI individuals who consumed larger amounts of lactose or dairy (interaction term P = 0.03) (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 6), a finding that is consistent with previous reports 8,18 . In contrast, there was no evidence for interaction with diet at the ABO locus (interaction term P &gt; 0.05) (Supplementary Table 6). This could be attributable to the limited accuracy of our diet scores, information that was recorded 4 years prior to microbiome collection. Interaction between fiber intake and genetic variants at this locus, when it is associated with Collinsella genus, have been reported in other populations 18 .We also investigated the effect of diet at the LCT and ABO loci, considering the dominant inheritance model at LCT and the observed dependence on secretor status at ABO.

        <p>Taxa and pathways genetic signatures are likely polygenic. None of the 22 other loci that showed suggestive association at P &lt; 5 × 10 -8 (Supplementary Table 2) were reported previously. The majority (18 loci) were associated with bacterial pathways that could not have been directly quantified in studies using 16 S rRNA data, the methodology predominantly used in microbiome genetic studies to date. The associated regions harbor genes and variants associated with metabolic and immune phenotypes, thus providing intriguing links with microbiome and diseases, as described in Supplementary Note.Taxa and pathways genetic signatures are likely polygenic.

        <p>We sought to replicate these suggestive signals using summary statistics from other independent cohorts in which microbiome data was characterized using either 16 S rRNA (the MiBioGen study) 13 or metagenomic sequencing (the LL-DEEP cohort) 17 . In the MiBioGen study, a meta-analysis of 24 cohorts comprising up to 18,340 individuals, the 16 S rRNA measurements do not allow for the evaluation of the abundance of bacterial species and pathways, and the X chromosome was not analyzed. Consequently, only 10 of our 18 SNP-taxa pairs could be tested in MiBioGen, and no pathways were testable. In LL-DEEP, a genome-wide microbiome association study Lactose intake was corrected for daily calorie consumption. The y axis represents the relative abundance of the microbial feature, natural log-transformed and adjusted by age and sex. Density distribution is displayed with violin plots, whereas boxplots represent summary statistics; the center line represents the median, the box hinges represent the lower and upper quartiles (percentiles 25 and 75) of the distribution, the upper whisker extends to the maximum value no further than 1.5× interquartile range (IQR) from the upper hinge, the lower whisker extends to the minimum value no further than 1.5× IQR from the lower hinge and data beyond the end of the whiskers are outliers plotted as individual points. Lactose intake levels were defined as low if less than the first quartile and high if greater than or equal to the first quartile. Lactose intake was only available for 5,801 of the 6,809 LP participants and 376 of the 443 LI participants. P values were obtained with a two-sided Wilcoxon rank test. Species in the same family shared similar distributions, although the difference in distribution within the LI group was not significant (Extended Data Fig. 2). n, number of participants. on 952 individuals, we extracted information for the majority of the SNP-taxa pairs (14/18) and SNP-pathway associations (18/19). Unfortunately, the power to replicate the associations in LL-DEEP was limited due to the small sample size. In both studies, we observed significant replication of the study-wide significant loci, LCT and ABO, using a Bonferroni threshold of P &lt; 0.0015 (equivalent to 32 SNP-trait pairs tested). All seven taxa associated with SNPs near LCT were replicated with consistent allelic effect directions (all P &lt; 3.7 × 10 -6 ). For the ABO locus, we found significant replication for the Collinsella genus (P &lt; 2 × 10 -5 in MiBioGen) and replication at only nominal significance for the bacterial pathway LACTOSECAT-PWY and B. bifidum species (P &lt; 0.05 in LL-DEEP) (Supplementary Tables 7 and8). The association at ABO with B. bifidum does not reach the multiple-testing-adjusted threshold for replication. Therefore, although the consistent direction of effects is encouraging, we cannot exclude the possibility for this signal to be a false positive. None of the other SNP-taxa or pathway pairs were replicated in MiBioGen or LL-DEEP. Interestingly, another independent SNP in the COL23A1 gene (rs11958296; r 2 = 0.1 with rs10447306 from our study) shows association in MiBioGen to the abundance of the same taxa: family Rikenellaceae (P = 2.4 × 10 -5 ) and genus Alistipes (P = 9.3 × 10 -6 ).We sought to replicate these suggestive signals using summary statistics from other independent cohorts in which microbiome data was characterized using either 16 S rRNA (the MiBioGen study) 13 or metagenomic sequencing (the LL-DEEP cohort) 17 .

        <p>To explore whether the association signals at lower levels of significance are enriched in heritable bacteria, which would indicate if it is possible to detect more genome-wide significant mbQTLs by further increasing the sample size, we investigated the correlation of taxa and pathway heritability estimations from family-based analysis with the number of suggestively associated loci for each taxon and pathway. Here, we observed a positive and significant correlation for both taxonomic (r S = 0.248, P = 3.1 × 10 -4 ) and pathway (r S = 0.263, P = 1.3 × 10 -4 ) heritability with the number of suggestive (P &lt; 1 × 10 -5 ) loci identified in our GWAS (Fig. 4).

        <p>We also evaluated whether we could replicate any of the association signals outside the LCT and ABO loci that were reported in a recent and similarly sized Finnish population study 18 . After extracting all associations with P &lt; 1 × 10 -4 in our dataset, we identified 3 out of 451 genome-wide significant SNPs from the Finnish study using direct or proxy (r 2 &gt; 0.8) information (279 of the SNPs reported in this study were not included in our dataset because their MAF was &lt;0.05).

In the top panels, the distribution across all blood types is also significantly different for all features (ANOVA: P = 6.7 × 10 -14 for species B. bifidum, P = 5.4 × 10 -9 for LACTOSECAT-PWy and P = 1.4 × 10 -13 for genus Collinsella).

This corroborates the allelic effects seen in the Finnish study for the abundances of phylum Desulfobacterota A, class Desulfovibrionia, order Desulfovibrionales and family Desulfovibrionaceae.We also evaluated whether we could replicate any of the association signals outside the LCT and ABO loci that were reported in a recent and similarly sized Finnish population study 18 .

        <p>To investigate the causal relationships between microbiome composition/function and complex traits, and vice versa, we used publicly available summary statistics in conjunction with our mbQTL results to perform bidirectional two-sample MR analyses (Methods). We analyzed 78 phenotypes representing autoimmune diseases, cardiometabolic diseases and related risk factors, as well as food preferences (Supplementary Table 10) and the 37 microbiome features associated with at least one variant at genome-wide significance in our GWAS. None of the causal relationships were significant at FDR &lt; 0.05. At FDR &lt; 0.1, we observed three causal relationships in the direction from microbiome to phenotypes, suggesting that variation in microbiome abundance can influence salt intake and triglyceride levels (Supplementary Note, Supplementary Table 11 and Extended Data Fig. 3). There was no evidence for these relationships being affected by pleiotropy, and results were very similar when we performed a polygenic risk score analysis in the UK Biobank cohort (Supplementary Table 12 and Supplementary Note).To investigate the causal relationships between microbiome composition/function and complex traits, and vice versa, we used publicly available summary statistics in conjunction with our mbQTL results to perform bidirectional two-sample MR analyses (Methods).

        <p>We carried out the largest GWAS of gut microbiome composition and function in a single population by analyzing metagenomic sequencing data in 7,738 volunteers from the northern Netherlands. We recapitulated genetic associations at two known loci, LCT and ABO, and the resolution of our metagenomic sequencing allowed us to pinpoint associations with species (B. adolescentis at LCT, B. bifidum and C. aerofaciens at ABO) and bacterial pathways (LACTOSECAT-PWY at ABO) in these loci. Furthermore, we identified associations (P &lt; 5 × 10 -8 ) at 22 other loci for four taxa and 18 bacterial pathways. None were affected by major confounders of the gut microbiome such as medication usage, diet and BMI. Finally, we used an MR approach to pinpoint causal links among gut microbiome composition, complex traits and food intake habits.We carried out the largest GWAS of gut microbiome composition and function in a single population by analyzing metagenomic sequencing data in 7,738 volunteers from the northern Netherlands.

        <p>The association between the LCT locus and the gut microbiome remains the most robust genetic association identified to date. Associations at LCT with Bifidobacterium have been consistently reported in studies of different ethnicities, across a range of sample sizes and in studies using different technologies and protocols 6,8,13,14,22 . We recapitulate that an increase of Bifidobacterium was more evident in LI individuals who consume milk or milk-derived products 13,25 . In addition, given that the resolution of metagenomic sequencing allows for species-level characterization of microbiome profiles, we showed that this effect was mainly attributable to the species B. longum, B. adolescentis, B. catenulatum and B. bifidum, which was also corroborated by two recent studies in Finnish and US Hispanic/Latino populations 18,26 .The association between the LCT locus and the gut microbiome remains the most robust genetic association identified to date.

        <p>Another study-wide association was at the ABO locus. Associations with microbiome composition and blood types were observed in previous experimental studies 27,28 . Genetic associations at ABO have been reported previously in populations of different ethnicities 22,29 and in nonhuman species, including pigs 30 . A deletion at this locus that inactivates the ABO acetylgalactosaminyltransferase has been shown to change porcine microbiome composition by altering intestinal N-acetylgalactosamine concentrations and consequently reducing the abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae strains, which have the capacity to import and catabolize N-acetylgalactosamine 31 . We did not detect any evidence of interaction with diet at the ABO locus, although this could be due to limitations in available information, as the recording of dietary information and stool collection were done at different times. We did, however, find that associations at this locus depend on secretor status that is determined by a nonsense mutation at the FUT2 gene 22 and thus on the host's ability to incorporate antigens into bodily fluids that are released in the gut. Intriguingly, we observed that taxa associated with ABO also showed evidence of association at LCT independently of blood type (interaction P &gt; 0.05 for all taxa), indicating a common, independent action of these two loci in contributing to the growth of the associated bacteria. The most compelling hypothesis is that the availability of sugars in the gut, via undigested lactose in LI individuals or secretion of antigens with accessible glycans in non-O blood-type secretors, provides direct energy sources for these bacteria. This is further supported by the observation that LI individuals and non-O blood-type secretors were both associated with the increased abundance of a bacterial pathway for lactose and galactose degradation. However, this mechanism would not fully explain the opposite direction of the association at ABO seen for B. bifidum, which, under this hypothesis and considering its adaptation to normal gastrointestinal mucosa (apparently independent of H-antigen secretion, as shown in Fig. 4), would be subjected to competition in the environment, as is the case of non-O blood secretors. Of note, a similar pattern of association at this locus was found in a recent study 22 , where a branch of the Bacteroides genus represented by OTU97_12, OTU99_12, and TestASV_13, showed association with an inverse relationship between their prevalence and the non-O blood-type group and instead a positive relationship with prevalence of OTU97_27. Although these opposite associations could be explained by antigen degradation activity of certain species and consequent environment competition for others, more studies are needed to clarify the complex mechanisms involved.Another study-wide association was at the ABO locus.

        <p>We acknowledge that anachronistic diet information is a limitation of our study. Although we have shown that in general the microbiome remains fairly stable in an individual after 4 years, with interindividual differences being larger than interindividual differences 32 , short-term changes in diet, especially those introducing drastic shifts, can perturbate microbiome composition and function. These cannot be taken in account by our analyses. Capturing these shifts would not be easy even with frequency food questionnaires recorded at time of sample collection; ideally, real-time extensive recording in weeks preceding microbiome collection should be implemented in future biobanks.We acknowledge that anachronistic diet information is a limitation of our study.

        <p>The strongest mbQTLs we identified reside in genes under selective pressure. The LCT gene is highly differentiated among human populations due to positive selection of the lactase-persistence phenotype. It has been estimated that strong selection occurred within the past 5,000-10,000 years, consistent with an advantage of lactase persistence and the ability to digest milk in the setting of dairy farming 33 . Variants at this locus have been linked, through GWASs, to not only food habits and metabolic phenotypes but also immune cell populations 34 . The ABO locus is evolutionarily highly differentiated; it has been shown to have experienced balancing selection in the last three million years in many primate species 35 . Several evolutionary sources of selective pressure have been proposed, including via infections by pathogens such as malaria 36 and cholera 37 . ABO variants have also been linked to cardiometabolic traits, cytokine levels and white and red blood cell levels 38,39 . Therefore, host-microbiome interactions are likely shaped by human-microbe coevolution and survival, probably through a balance between food availability for gut bacteria and enhanced immune response of the host. Better understanding of these interactions will expand our current knowledge of human evolution 40 .

        <p>To explore the causality of the relations of the microbiome with complex traits and food preferences, we performed bidirectional MR analysis using 56 dietary traits, 16 diseases and 5 biomarkers. At FDR &lt; 0.1, we observed that a genetically determined increase in the abundance of genus Alistipes and its family Rikenellaceae led to decreased consumption of salt, although the limited impact of genetic variants on both microbiome composition and dietary preferences requires caution when interpreting causality estimation by MR 42,43 . Although it is known that dietary changes have a strong effect on microbiome composition 44 , it is intriguing to suggest that genetically determined variation of the microbiome might affect food preferences. This is supported by bacterial genetic variations in salt tolerance 45 and the established knowledge that the composition of gut microbiome can predict the effect of food items on host metabolism 46 . There is additional evidence supporting a role for the microbiome in influencing food preferences. A perfect proxy of rs642387 (rs503397, r 2 = 0.99 in 1000 Genomes Project Europeans) was recently reported to be associated with the family Desulfovibrionaceae and related taxa in a Finnish population and replicated in our study and has been associated with bitter alcoholic beverage consumption in an independent cohort 47 . Another study found an increase in family Desulfovibrionaceae in individuals with high alcohol consumption 48 , and family Desulfovibrionaceae, genus Desulfovibrio and other related taxa were also associated with increased consumption of alcohol in our DMP cohort 16 , supporting a pleiotropic effect of this locus on both microbiome composition and alcohol intake. Combined with our findings, this suggests that gut microbiota could influence an individual's food preferences by mediating the downstream effect of the consumption of different products.To explore the causality of the relations of the microbiome with complex traits and food preferences, we performed bidirectional MR analysis using 56 dietary traits, 16 diseases and 5 biomarkers.

        <p>In addition to the two study-wide significant loci, we also observed 22 loci at genome-wide significance and many more at more lenient thresholds. The observed correlation between the heritability of microbial taxa and pathways and the number of suggestively associated loci indicates that mbQTLs with smaller effects are likely to exist. These loci remain under the detection limit in this study. According to our power estimates, sample sizes would need to be increased by orders of magnitude to elucidate the genetic architecture of microbiome traits, especially of rarer bacteria. Joint efforts that combine tens of thousands of individuals, combined with harmonized methodology to reduce technical bias, will be needed to characterize more than a few major loci, as has also been the case for genetic studies of much more heritable quantitative traits such as BMI (heritability ~40%), height (heritability ~80%) and other human phenotypes [49][50][51] . of genetic association. Next, we added these variables to the basic genetic model (feature = age + sex + genetic variant) to confirm their association at (at least) nominal significance level (P &lt; 0.05) while accounting for the associated genetic variant(s). Finally, for the dietary variables showing nominal significance, we evaluated the interaction with the genetic variant(s) by including an interaction term into the association model. For the LCT locus, we considered a binary variable to distinguish two groups of genotypes at SNP rs182549 (C/C vs. C/T and T/T) according to the dominant inheritance model at this locus. For the ABO locus, we used a binary definition of blood type (blood type O vs. A/B/AB) and also considered the effect of the rs601338 genotype in the FUT2 gene (defining secretor/nonsecretor individuals). All microbiome features were inverse-rank normalized before analyses, and age and sex were added as covariates as in the main GWAS analysis. All models were fit using the lm() function from base

        <p>Power analysis. We calculated the variance explained at our loci using the formula described in Teslovich et al. 71 , which takes into account MAF, effect size, s.e. and sample size. We then performed a power analysis based on a linear model of association, considering different genetic effect sizes (variance explained) and sample sizes (https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Power_Calculations:_ Quantitative_Traits). We performed a sample size calculation by doing a grid search in the sample size sequence (1,000, 1,050, …, 50,000) and kept the lowest sample size that had power &gt;80%.Power analysis.

        <p>Cohort description. LifeLines is a multidisciplinary prospective population-based cohort study with a unique three-generation design that is examining the health and health-related behaviors of 167,729 people living in the north of the Netherlands. LifeLines employs a broad range of investigative procedures to assess the biomedical, sociodemographic, behavioral, physical and psychological factors that contribute to the health and disease of the general population, with a special focus on multimorbidity and complex genetics 52,53 . During the first follow-up visit, all participants were invited to participate in a parallel project, the DMP, on a voluntary basis. The goal of this project is to evaluate the impact of different exposures and lifestyles on gut microbiota composition 16 . A subset of 10,000 LifeLines participants were included; for 8,719 of these participants, both feces and phenotype information were collected. Of these, samples from 8,208 participants were retained for downstream analysis after stringent quality control 16 . Distribution of age, gender and location within the three north provinces was similar to that observed in the total LifeLines cohort 53 .Cohort description.

        <p>Genome characterization. Genotyping of 38,030 LifeLines participants was carried out using the Infinium Global Screening Array MultiEthnic Diseases version, following the manufacturer's protocols, at the Rotterdam Genotyping Center and the Department of Genetics of the University Medical Center Groningen. Here, we used available quality-controlled genotyping data imputed with Haplotype Reference Consortium panel v.1.1 54 , as described elsewhere 55 . To avoid population stratification, we analyzed only European samples. We selected 43,587 genetic markers by applying LD pruning on the genotyped data (sliding window of 1 Mb, LD r 2 &lt; 0.2, step = 5) and used them for a principal-component analysis projecting the 1000 Genomes Project (all populations) and GoNL cohorts a population references 56,57 . Europeans were then identified as samples clustering together with European populations according to the first two principal components or &lt;3 s.d. away from the most distant European samples in the reference. In total, 35 non-European participants were removed. Quality-controlled genotype information was obtained for 7,738 of the DMP participants for whom quality-controlled microbiome data and BMI were also available. Of these, 58.1% were females, and ages ranged from 8 to 84 years (mean, 48.5 years). The mean BMI value was 25.58 (range, 13.10 to 63.70).Genome characterization.

        <p>The gut microbiome was characterized from stool samples as described in Gacesa et al 16 . In brief, stool samples were collected by participants, frozen within 15 min after production and transported on dry ice to the LifeLines facility to be stored at -80 °C. Microbial DNA was extracted using the QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Samples with a total DNA yield lower than 200 ng (as determined by Qubit 4 Fluorometer) were prepared using NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina), and samples with higher DNA yield were prepared using NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina). Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was carried out using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform at Novogene. Metagenomic sequencing data was profiled following methods used in other cohorts, as described previously 16,52 . Low-quality reads (PHRED quality ≤30), adapters and host sequences were removed using 
            <rs type="software">KneadData</rs> tools v.
            <rs type="version">0.5.1</rs>. Taxonomic composition was determined with

            <rs type="version">2.7.2</rs> (ref. 58 ). Characterization of biochemical pathways was performed with the HUMAnN2

            <rs type="version">0.11.1</rs> (ref. 59 ), integrated with the UniRef90 v.0.1.1 protein database 60 , the ChocoPhlAn pangenome database and the 
            <rs type="software">DIAMOND</rs> alignment tool v.
            <rs type="version">0.8.22</rs> (ref. 61 ). After quality control (where samples with eukaryotic or viral abundance ≤25% and total read depth ≥10 million were retained), we had information on 950 microbial taxa and 559 functional pathways. For this study, we focused only on bacterial taxa and functional pathways with mean relative abundance &gt;0.001% across all samples and present in at least 1,000 of the 7,738 participants, which resulted in a list of 207 taxonomies (5 phyla, 10 classes, 13 orders, 26 families, 48 genera and 105 species) and 328 bacterial pathways. Furthermore, we removed redundant pathways by discarding one pathway among pairs that were highly correlated (r S &gt; 0.95), as well as pathways not previously described in bacteria that could thus be coming from sources other than bacteria, resulting in 205 pathways for genetic analyses.

        <p>Diet phenotypes definition. Dietary habits were assessed using a semiquantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire designed and validated by the division of Human Nutrition of Wageningen University as described before in Siebelink et al. and Gacesa et al. 16,62 . The Food Frequency Questionnaire data were collected 4 years prior to fecal sampling, and supplementary questionnaires were collected concurrent with fecal sampling, with the stability of long-term dietary habits between time points assessed as described in Gacesa et al. 16 . We analyzed the dietary factors that were previously found to be associated (FDR &lt; 0.05) with the microbiome features in our study that had a genome-wide significant signal in the ABO and LCT loci. We also analyzed lactose intake for the species B. longum and B. adolescentis, given their association with the LCT region in our study. Participants with an implausible caloric intake (&lt;800 or &gt;3,934 kcal/d for males and &lt;500 or &gt;2,906 kcal/d for females) 63 were not included in these analyses.Diet phenotypes definition.

        <p>Genome-wide association analysis was performed in 7,738 European samples for 412 features (205 functional pathways and 207 microbial taxa), investigating genetic additive effects using allele dosages for 5,584,686 genetic variants with MAF &gt; 0.05 and information score &gt;0.4 on the autosomes (chromosomes 1-22) and the X chromosome. We focused on the quantitative dimensions of relative bacterial and pathway abundances, treating all zero values as missing data. We used natural log-transformed abundances and regressed these in a linear mixed model using SAIGE v.0.38 (ref. 19 ), with age, sex and the genetic relationship matrix among participants as covariates. We used the standard settings of SAIGE, which applies inverse-rank normalization to the traits prior to the association analyses. The genetic relationship matrix was built with SAIGE using a set of 54,565 SNPs selected from the total set of quality-controlled SNPs directly genotyped and filtered for allele frequency and redundancy (MAF ≥ 0.05, r 2 &lt; 0.2, sliding window = 500 kb).Genome-wide association analysis was performed in 7,738 European samples for 412 features (205 functional pathways and 207 microbial taxa), investigating genetic additive effects using allele dosages for 5,584,686 genetic variants with MAF &gt; 0.05 and information score &gt;0.4 on the autosomes (chromosomes 1-22) and the X chromosome.

        <p>Definition of the study-wide significant threshold. To estimate the number of independent phenotypes assessed, we used principal-component analysis on the matrix of 412 microbiome features (207 taxonomies and 205 pathways) available for GWAS analysis to decompose variability in independent components (axes). We estimated that 264 components are needed to explain 90% of the microbiome variance. We then defined our study-wide significant P value threshold by correcting the genome-wide significance threshold for this factor (5 × 10 -8 /264 = 1.89 × 10 -10 ).Definition of the study-wide significant threshold.

        <p>Inference of blood groups. We estimated blood groups from genotyped and imputed data following the scheme of Ellinghaus et al. 65 . Specifically, we used the absence of the rs8176719 insertion to define blood-type allele O1, the T allele of rs41302905 to define blood-type allele O2 and the T allele of rs8176746 to define the blood-type allele B (instead of rs8176747). Diploid individuals O1O1, O2O2 and O1O2 were considered blood type O. Diploid individuals O1B, O2B and BB were considered blood type B. Absence of the alleles mentioned above was used to define blood-type allele A. To evaluate differences across blood types, we compared the mean relative abundance of microbiome features in individuals with A, B and AB blood type to that in individuals with the O blood type using a two-sided Wilcoxon test. To evaluate the interaction with the rs601338 FUT2 (secretor/ nonsecretor) locus, we grouped individuals into two groups (non-O blood type and blood type O) to distinguish production or nonproduction of antigens and compared pairs using a two-sided Wilcoxon test. All analyses were done using base R v.3.6.1 (https://www.R-project.org/). Effects of potential confounders. We evaluated the robustness of genome-wideassociated signals by incorporating the following potential confounders into our statistical model: medication usage, anthropometric data and stool frequency and consistency data (collection and processing was described in Gacesa et al. 16 ). We analyzed the effects of the following medication groups: proton pump inhibitors (ATC A02BC, N = 130), laxatives (osmotic ATC A06AD, N = 44; volume increasing ATC A06AC, N = 77), one group of antibacterials (ATC J01, N = 24) and other group of anti-infectives (ATC J, N = 39). The other group of medication considered was antibiotic use in the 3 months prior to stool collection (N = 450). For each of these medications, we created dichotomous variables for all participants coded as 0 (nonuser) or 1 (user). The other factors included were BMI, stool frequency and stool consistency (mean Bristol stool scale). All models also incorporated age and sex as covariates and were run only for the genome-wide-significant SNP-trait pairs (Supplementary Table 1) using the same software used for GWAS (SAIGE; Zhou et al. 19 ). To evaluate the impact of these covariates on the genetic signals, we used Cochran's Q heterogeneity test to compare the effect size obtained by the covariate-inclusive model and the basic model (that only includes age, sex and the genetic variant). To evaluate the impact of sex, we ran the SNP-association analysis in SAIGE separately for males and females using only age as a covariate. For each genetic variant, differences in effect size in males and females were tested using Cochran's Q heterogeneity test.Inference of blood groups.

For each of these medications, we created dichotomous variables for all participants coded as 0 (nonuser) or 1 (user). The other factors included were BMI, stool frequency and stool consistency (mean Bristol stool scale). All models also incorporated age and sex as covariates and were run only for the genome-wide-significant SNP-trait pairs (Supplementary Table 1) using the same software used for GWAS (SAIGE; Zhou et al. 19 ). To evaluate the impact of these covariates on the genetic signals, we used Cochran's Q heterogeneity test to compare the effect size obtained by the covariate-inclusive model and the basic model (that only includes age, sex and the genetic variant). To evaluate the impact of sex, we ran the SNP-association analysis in SAIGE separately for males and females using only age as a covariate. For each genetic variant, differences in effect size in males and females were tested using Cochran's Q heterogeneity test.</p>
        <p>Interaction analyses. We used a three-step procedure to evaluate gene-diet interactions for all the taxa and pathways associated with SNPs at the LCT and ABO loci. First, we extracted the variables representing dietary habits that had previously shown significant association with these microbial traits at FDR &lt; 0.05 16 . For the genus Collinsella and pathway LACTOSECAT-PWY, no dietary factors were found at this FDR threshold. We therefore considered the same dietary factors associated with B. bifidum in the analyses, given that they showed similar patterns NATuRE GENETiCS | www.nature.com/naturegenetics Reporting Summary.
