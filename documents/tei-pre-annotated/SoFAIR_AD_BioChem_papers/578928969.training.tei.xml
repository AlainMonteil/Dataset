        <p>We show that epigenome-and transcriptome-wide association studies (EWAS and TWAS) are prone to significant inflation and bias of test statistics, an unrecognized phenomenon introducing spurious findings if left unaddressed. Neither GWAS-based methodology nor state-of-the-art confounder adjustment methods completely remove bias and inflation. We propose a Bayesian method to control bias and inflation in EWAS and TWAS based on estimation of the empirical null distribution. Using simulations and real data, we demonstrate that our method maximizes power while properly controlling the false positive rate. We illustrate the utility of our method in large-scale EWAS and TWAS meta-analyses of age and smoking.We show that epigenome-and transcriptome-wide association studies (EWAS and TWAS) are prone to significant inflation and bias of test statistics, an unrecognized phenomenon introducing spurious findings if left unaddressed.

        <p>The large-scale analysis of epigenome and transcriptome data in population studies is thought to answer fundamental questions about genome biology and will be instrumental in linking genetic and environmental influences to disease etiology [1,2]. Worldwide, research groups are now joining forces to generate and analyze such data [3][4][5][6][7] complementary to the vast resources of genetic data that are already available and have been used successfully in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). While the analysis tool box for GWAS has matured, the development of effective methodology for the analysis of epigenomeand transcriptome-wide association studies (EWAS and TWAS) is a nascent field of research. In an EWAS, DNA methylation levels of typically hundreds of thousands of CpG dinucleotides are individually tested for association with an outcome of interest, while in a TWAS this is done for expression levels of tens of thousands of genes.The large-scale analysis of epigenome and transcriptome data in population studies is thought to answer fundamental questions about genome biology and will be instrumental in linking genetic and environmental influences to disease etiology [1,2].

        <p>Currently, EWAS and TWAS analysis heavily relies on approaches specifically designed for GWAS. However, epigenome and transcriptome data are crucially different from genetic data. They are quantitative measures (and not discrete like genotypes) that are subject to major confounding effects of technical batches and biological influences, including cellular heterogeneity [2,8]. Furthermore, molecular phenotypes such as DNA methylation and gene expression often show stronger associations with phenotypic traits or complex diseases than genotypic markers.Currently, EWAS and TWAS analysis heavily relies on approaches specifically designed for GWAS.

        <p>A key aspect of the analysis of ome-wide association studies is the control of test-statistic inflation. Inflation of test statistics leads to an overestimation of the level of statistical significance and dramatically increases the number of false positive findings [9]. This has always been a major concern in GWAS, but inflated test statistics are also observed in EWAS [10,11]. Often the level of inflation exceeds that observed in GWAS, yet it is generally not corrected [12]. In GWAS, test-statistic inflation is commonly addressed using genomic control in which the inflated test statistics are divided by the genomic inflation factor. The genomic inflation factor estimates the amount of inflation by comparing observed test statistics across all genetic variants to those expected under the hypothesis of no effect [9]. Recent work pointed out crucial limitations of genomic control in GWAS [13,14]. Notably, the genomic inflation factor was shown to provide an invalid estimate of test-statistic inflation when the outcome of interest is associated with many, small genetic effects [13]. In EWAS and TWAS, this is the rule rather than the exception. Moreover, test statistics may not only be subject to inflation but also to bias [15], which is not corrected for when using genomic control. Bias of test statistics leads to a shift in the distribution of effect sizes and is driven by confounding [16,17], a prominent feature of EWAS and TWAS but much less of a concern in GWAS [18]. Thus, this calls for the development of new methods specifically designed to address test-statistic inflation and bias in EWAS and TWAS analyses.A key aspect of the analysis of ome-wide association studies is the control of test-statistic inflation.

        <p>Although generally ignored, genomic control will overestimate the actual inflation unless it is estimated on the basis of genetic variants not associated with the outcome of interest [9,19]. A Bayesian outlier model [20] was proposed to solve this issue; it estimates inflation while assuming a fixed and small number of 10 associated genetic variants. Although this is an improvement for GWAS with few associations, it will not be sufficient to solve the overestimation of inflation in EWAS and TWAS, which typically yield substantially more associations. Nor does it address the occurrence of test-statistic bias. In the statistical literature, alternative methods have been proposed in the context of large-scale multiple hypothesis testing where an empirical null distribution is used for inference [16,[21][22][23]. The utility of these approaches in EWAS and TWAS, however, remains to be evaluated.Although generally ignored, genomic control will overestimate the actual inflation unless it is estimated on the basis of genetic variants not associated with the outcome of interest [9,19].

        <p>Here, we use simulation studies and large-scale methylome (n = 2203) and transcriptome (n = 1910) data [24,25] to show that correcting inflated test statistics by applying genomic control is too conservative for EWAS and TWAS and that test-statistic bias cannot be ignored. Moreover, we demonstrate that test-statistic bias and inflation are represented by the mean and standard deviation of the empirical null distribution and propose a Bayesian method for its estimation. Application of stateof-the-art batch correction methods, including SVA [26], RUV [27], and CATE [17], were not able to remove all test-statistic bias and inflation. Hence, the resulting test statistics require empirical calibration to achieve optimal statistical power while controlling the number of false positives at the desired level. We develop a Bayesian method for estimation of the empirical null distribution and propose a bias and inflation correction implemented as an

        </p>
        <p>We performed an EWAS and TWAS of age and smoking status using subsets of 500 individuals from two population cohorts, namely the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS) and LifeLines (LL) (Additional file 1: Table S1). The analyses were adjusted for known technical and biological covariates (including measured white blood cell counts) within a linear model framework. Inflation of test statistics was observed in all of the eight analyses (two cohorts, two data types, and two outcomes; Fig. 1). The amount of inflation estimated using the commonly used genomic inflation factor [9] varied substantially across analyses and ranged from 1.33 to 1.72 for the EWAS and from 1.21 to 1.54 for the TWAS (Fig. 1).We performed an EWAS and TWAS of age and smoking status using subsets of 500 individuals from two population cohorts, namely the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS) and LifeLines (LL) (Additional file 1: Table S1).

        <p>However, the genomic inflation factor appeared to be correlated with the expected number of true associations. For example, the genomic inflation factor was higher for age than smoking status, and previous studies showed that age is associated with many more differentially methylated sites and differentially expressed genes than smoking status [3][4][5][6][7]. For the analysis of age, the genomic inflation factor was higher for LL than LLS, which can be attributed to the higher statistical power for LL (age range 21 years) than LLS (age range 9 years).However, the genomic inflation factor appeared to be correlated with the expected number of true associations.

        <p>A simulation study substantiated the impression that the genomic inflation factor depends on the number of true associations (Fig. 2). In fact, this result can be derived mathematically [9].

        <p>While quantile-quantile plots of expected versus observed test statistics, or their corresponding P values, are frequently used to visualize inflation (Fig. 1), the alternative representation through a histogram of test statistics reveals a second artifact, namely a bias of the test statistics (Fig. 3a and Additional file 1: Figure S1). This bias is visible as a deviation of the mode of the observed test statistics from zero, which is the mode of the standard normal distribution. Since the majority of features (being genetic variants, CpGs, or genes) are assumed not to be associated with the outcome of interest, test statistics obtained from a linear model should follow a standard normal distribution (i.e., centered at zero). We observed test-statistic bias in the EWAS and TWAS of age and smoking irrespective of cohort and outcome (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Genomic control does not address bias because it uses a normal distribution with the mode fixed at zero (Additional file 2). The misspecification of the observed distribution of test statistics by genomic control [9], was observed for both EWAS and TWAS of age, while for the EWAS and TWAS of smoking the amount of inflation is smaller (notice different y-axis scales) is illustrated in Fig. 3c. Note that even permutation-based approaches, which are often assumed to rescue violations of assumptions regarding the theoretical null distribution, do not result in a proper null distribution, and both teststatistic bias and inflation persist [16,30] (Fig. 3d). We mathematically derived that unobserved confounding factors introduce bias in the analysis of high-dimensional data (Additional file 2), thus expanding on earlier work by Rao [15].While quantile-quantile plots of expected versus observed test statistics, or their corresponding P values, are frequently used to visualize inflation (Fig. 1), the alternative representation through a histogram of test statistics reveals a second artifact, namely a bias of the test statistics (Fig. 3a and Additional file 1: Figure S1).

        <p>Both bias and inflation represent deviations from the theoretical null distribution: bias (i.e., mean), a deviation from zero, and inflation (i.e., standard deviation) (Additional file 2). Hence, estimating the amount of bias and inflation is identical to estimating the parameters of the empirical null distribution. We developed a Bayesian method to estimate the empirical null distribution from an observed set of test statistics and thus simultaneously obtain estimates of bias and inflation. The method fits a three-component normal mixture to the observed set of test statistics using a Gibbs sampling algorithm [31]. One component reflects the null distribution with mean and standard deviation representing bias and inflation. The other two components with a positive and a negative mean capture the fraction of true associations observed in the data, which is assumed to be an unknown minority of tests (Fig. 3b, Fig. 4, and Additional file 1: Figure S2). Hence, our method simultaneously provides estimates for the amount of bias and inflation without being affected by an unknown proportion of true associations (Additional file 1: Figure S3). We compared our method to alternative approaches for estimation of the empirical null distribution [16] in a simulation study. This showed that the proportion Genomic Inflation Factor Estimates Fig. 2 The genomic inflation factor overestimates inflation in the presence of a moderate proportion of true associations. The box-plot summarizes the estimated inflation for simulated data with different amounts of true associations. One hundred sets of test statistics were generated with different amounts of true associations (20%, 10% and 5%) but without any true inflation; i.e., the inflation factor should be equal to one. The genomic inflation factor was calculated using λ χ 2 1 [9]. A clear dependence on the number of true associations is seen for the genomic inflation factor performance of our method is equal to or better than those of the previous methods under various scenarios. Moreover, our method resulted in the most stable estimation of the inflation, which suggests that other methods randomly over-or underestimate the level of inflation (Additional file 1: Figure S4 and Additional file 3).Both bias and inflation represent deviations from the theoretical null distribution: bias (i.e., mean), a deviation from zero, and inflation (i.e., standard deviation) (Additional file 2).

        <p>The primary causes of inflation and bias are thought to be unmeasured technical and biological confounding [8,16], e.g., population substructure, batch effects, and cellular heterogeneity. Various methods have been developed to reduce the impact of these unmeasured factors in high-dimensional data [17,26,27,[32][33][34]. We applied six of these methods to adjust an EWAS and TWAS of age in 500 individuals, a subset of the LLS cohort, and investigated their impact on test-statistic bias and inflation. All approaches reduced the amount of bias and inflation as compared with a model using known covariates only (Table 1 and Additional file 1: Table S2). Nevertheless, residual bias and inflation were observed. Therefore, we designed a two-stage method in order to preserve statistical power while appropriately controlling the number of false positives. First, we performed an analysis that normal distribution with mean and variance (0.0, 1.0 2 ), b empirical null (brown): normal distribution with estimated mean and variance using our Bayesian method (0.23, 1.5 2 ), c inflated null (purple): normal distribution with zero mean and variance equal to the estimated inflation estimated using the genomic control method (0.0, 1.5 2 ), and d permutation null (pink): normal distribution with permutation-based estimates of mean and variance (-0.006, 1.1 2 ). For comparison the theoretical null (green) is shown in each panel corrects for known biological and technical covariates plus estimated unobserved covariates, followed by estimating and adjusting the residual bias and inflation using the empirical null distribution. In the adjustment step, P values are calculated using the empirical null distribution instead of the standard normal or the inflated normal that is used by the genomic control method.

Furthermore, it is important to note that bias not only results in incorrect test statistics and P values but also results in biased estimates of effect sizes. To evaluate the performance of the twostage method, we conducted a numerical simulation. To account for unmeasured confounding, we selected CATE, a state-of-the-art method that was shown to have superior performance in estimating unobserved covariates as compared with alternative methods [17]. Our Bayesian method in combination with CATE yielded the highest power with the fraction of false positives close to the nominal level (0.058±0.0052). In contrast, methods that ignore unobserved covariates led to high false positive rates and methods that use genomic control resulted in low power (Table 2).

        <p>A main development in the field of EWAS and TWAS, analogous to current practice in GWAS, is the combined analysis of multiple population studies to detect an increasing number of associations including those with small effect sizes. Fixed-effect meta-analysis combines estimated effect sizes and their standard errors from different studies to construct pooled estimates resulting in higher precision of effect-size estimates and hence superior statistical power [35,36]. We performed an EWAS and TWAS of age and smoking status in four cohorts totaling 2203 individuals with methylome and 1910 individuals with transcriptome data, respectively. We combined the results from the four cohorts through fixedeffect meta-analysis (Table 4 and Additional file 1: Figure S5). As observed earlier, bias and inflation remained present after addressing unmeasured confounding using CATE. Also estimates of inflation using genomic control were both higher and considerably more variable across analyses and cohorts than the estimates obtained using our Bayesian method (Table 4). The Bayesian method fully removed all bias and inflation. Critically, bias (&lt; |0.03|) and inflation (&lt; 1.14) remained minimal in the metaanalysis as compared with a meta-analysis using genomic control (Table 4).

Furthermore, the simultaneous performance of an EWAS and TWAS in a large-scale meta-analysis showed a remarkable overlap in results between the two study types of 410 and Mean and standard deviation of the number of false positives and true positives (power) for a simulation study repeated 100×. Data were generated according to the simulation setup of Wang et al. [17]. The table summarizes the results for the naive approach of no adjustment for confounding factors and adjusting for confounding factors using CATE. Both in combination with different approaches are used to control for inflation (and bias): no correction, correction using genomic control, correction using the median and median absolute deviation (MAD), calibration [17], and using our Bayesian method. As a comparison the oracle method is shown where the simulated confounding factors have been added to the linear model S3a-d). For example, both DNA methylation near and expression of CD248, DNMT3A, and FBLN2 were associated with age (Fig. 5a), while the same was true for GPR15, AHRR and CLDND1 for smoking (Fig. 5b). In total 15,967 (3.5%) CpG sites and 1020 (2.7%) genes were significantly associated with age (Bonferroni-corrected P values &lt; 0.05). For smoking, the number of associated CpGs and genes were 1128 (0.25%) and 301 (0.80%), respectively. We implemented our Bayesian method as an

        <p>We describe a novel Bayesian method to detect and correct for bias and inflation in epigenome-and transcriptome-wide association studies. Our method has the crucial characteristic that it is largely independent of the fraction of true associations in the data. We showed that the application of genomic control results in spurious associations because it does not address bias and, moreover, reduces power because it is sensitive to the number of true associations and thus commonly overestimates the levels of inflation. The performance of our method towards estimating the empirical null distribution of test statistics outperforms existing methods [16] by taking advantage of prior knowledge of the distribution and the composition of test statistics.We describe a novel Bayesian method to detect and correct for bias and inflation in epigenome-and transcriptome-wide association studies.

        <p>Methods that try to estimate unmeasured covariates [17,26,27] and those that try to recover the empirical null distribution [16] rely on the same principle. They extract information from features that are assumed not to be associated with the outcome of interest. Methods to estimate unknown covariates (e.g., RUV, SVA, and CATE as we used here) either use negative controls or assume the number of associated features to be sparse and, interestingly, they can be unified in a single mathematical framework [17]. Genomic control [9] yields a valid estimate of the inflation factor when calculated from features that are known not to be associated with the phenotype of interest. Similarly, the estimation of the empirical null distribution requires that the vast majority of features follow the null distribution [16]. Our Bayesian method is designed to be flexible in dealing with larger fractions of true associations, which turns out to be crucial in particular for EWAS and TWAS meta-analyses.Methods that try to estimate unmeasured covariates [17,26,27] and those that try to recover the empirical null distribution [16] rely on the same principle.

        <p>Our work extends the work of Devlin and Roeder [9], who originally propose to use genomic control to tackle test-statistic inflation for GWAS, and links their method to the pioneering work of Efron [16] on estimating an empirical null distribution for high-dimensional data inference.

        <p>Our method of estimating bias and inflation may resolve a common inconsistency in the current analysis of EWAS and TWAS. While it is becoming the norm to report inflation factors calculated using the traditional genomic control approach, inflation is rarely actually dealt with in the analysis, presumably because this is deemed to be too conservative. However, inflation may be substantial, in particular in a meta-analysis, and current practice is bound to introduce false positive findings. We show that estimating the inflation factor using the genomic inflation factor results both in an overestimation of the actual inflation (i.e., it is indeed conservative) and in imprecise estimates contributing to the previously unexplained, high variability across studies. Our method provides a realistic estimate of inflation that does not suffer from a high variability. Moreover, our method is the first to address the previously unrecognized issue of bias in test statistics. In conclusion, our method optimally reduces the number of false positive findings while preserving statistical power and can be seamlessly incorporated into existing workflows for the analysis of EWAS, TWAS, and other omics data.Our method of estimating bias and inflation may resolve a common inconsistency in the current analysis of EWAS and TWAS.

        <p>A detailed description of the RNA-seq data processing can be found in Zhernakova et al. [24]. Briefly, total RNA from whole blood, depleted of globin transcripts, was sequenced (2 × 50-bp) using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, and read alignment was performed using 
            <rs type="software">STAR</rs> (v
            <rs type="version">2.3.0</rs>). Subsequently, RNA-seq counts were normalized using TMM [41] and transformed to log 2 counts per million. Genes that yielded zero counts for all samples across cohorts were removed, which resulted in 45,867 genes (
            <rs type="software">ENSEMBLv</rs>73). For all analyses, genes with the lowest overall variance were excluded (5% lowest).

        <p>The generation of genome-wide DNA methylation data is described by Bonder et al. [25]. Briefly, 500 ng of genomic DNA was bisulfite modified using the EZ DNA Methylation kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) and hybridized on Illumina 450K arrays according to the manufacturer's protocols. The original idat files were generated by the Illumina iScan BeadChip scanner. Subsequently, sample quality control was performed using MethylAid [42]. Ambiguously mapped probes [43], probes with a high detection P value (&gt; 0.01), probes with a low bead count (&lt; 3 beads), and probes with a low success rate (missing in &gt; 95% of the samples) were set to missing. Samples containing an excess of missing probes (&gt; 5%) were excluded from the analysis. Subsequently, per cohort, imputation [44] was performed to impute the missing values. Functional normalization [45], as implemented in the 
            <rs type="software">minfi</rs> package [46], was used per cohort. All analyses were performed on M values. Detailed description of the 450K DNA methylation preprocessing steps are available from the git-repo Leiden450K [47].

        <p>White blood cell counts (WBC), i.e., neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils, were measured by the standard WBC differential as part of the complete blood count (CBC). A minority of samples were lacking CBC measurements. Since DNA methylation levels are informative of the white blood cell composition [48], we build a linear predictor to infer the white blood cell composition of those samples lacking WBC measurements (Additional file 2). Predicted cell counts were used in the meta-analysis. For the analyses of the cohort subsets, individuals with measured cell counts were selected.White blood cell counts (WBC), i.e., neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils, were measured by the standard WBC differential as part of the complete blood count (CBC).

        <p>All association analyses were performed using

T test statistics were transformed to P values using a standard normal distribution. For the analysis of RNAseq data, we first applied a voom-transformation [50] on the TMM-normalized counts while controlling for known covariates including age, gender, smoking status measured cell counts, and a technical covariate introducing a batch effect (the flow-cell identifier of the sequencing machine). For the analysis of DNA methylation data, the functional normalized beta-values [45] were transformed to M values, and again 
            <rs type="software">lmFit</rs> was used to obtain test statistics for the covariate of interest. Here we included age, gender, smoking status, measured cell counts, and array position as known covariates.

        <p>Efron proposed two methods for estimation of the empirical null distribution from a set of test statistics [16]. In order to compare the performance of those methods with our Bayesian method, sets of test statistics were generated, similar to the approach described above, but under different scenarios: scenario "equal" with equal proportion of positive and negative associations (0.05, 0.05), scenario "skewed" with only positive associations (prop. 0.1), scenario "small" similar to scenario equal with only 0.01 proportion of true associations, and scenario "close" where the distribution for the means had expected value of 1 (instead of 3). For each scenario, 2000 test statistics were generated 100 times. To estimate the empirical null distributions as proposed by Efron, we used the

Well chosen hyper-priors ensure that the occurrence of labeling switching is minimized; i.e., during sampling from the posterior, the null component is switched with one of the alternative components. That is, we take informative hyper-priors for means, the null component, λ 1 = 0, and for the alternative components λ 2 = -3 and λ 3 = 3 all τ 's are equal to 100. The hyper-priors for the variance parameters are equal for all components α = 1.28 and β = 0.36 and were taken from Raftery [54]. For the Dirichlet distribution, widely used uniform noninformative prior parameters were chosen: γ 1 = γ 2 = γ 3 = 1. Furthermore, data-dependent starting values are used to start the algorithm at a good initial point. These are based on the median and median absolute deviation (MAD) of the test statistics.
