        <p>Improvements in temporal resolution of single photon detectors enable increased data rates and transmission distances for both classical and quantum optical communication systems, higher spatial resolution in laser ranging, and observation of shorter-lived fluorophores in biomedical imaging. In recent years, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have emerged as the most efficient, time-resolving single-photon counting detectors available in the near infrared, but understanding of the fundamental limits of timing resolution in these devices has been limited due to a lack investigations into the time scales involved in the detection process. We introduce an experimental technique to probe the detection latency in SNSPDs and show that the key to achieving low timing jitter is the use of materials with low latency. By using a specialised niobium nitride (NbN) SNSPD we demonstrate that the system temporal resolution can be as good as 2.6±0.2 ps for visible wavelengths and 4.3±0.2 ps at 1550 nm.Improvements in temporal resolution of single photon detectors enable increased data rates and transmission distances for both classical and quantum optical communication systems, higher spatial resolution in laser ranging, and observation of shorter-lived fluorophores in biomedical imaging.

        <p>Temporal resolution of SNSPDs, commonly referred to as jitter, is quantified by the width of the temporal distribution of output signals with respect to the photon arrival times. This statistical distribution is known as the instrument response function (IRF), and its width is commonly evaluated as the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM). Significant effort has been made in the community to reduce the jitter and to ultimately understand the fundamental limitations. Though timing fluctuations arise from the microscopic physics of the detection mechanism, it is only recently that limited indications of these effects have been observed, such as asymmetry in the IRF, dependence on photon energy and external magnetic field. [21][22][23] The ability to directly observe the intrinsic timing jitter has been difficult, primarily because jitter in SNSPDs has often been limited by instrumental mechanisms, preventing a systematic experimental study of the intrinsic timing characteristics on different device design parameters.Temporal resolution of SNSPDs, commonly referred to as jitter, is quantified by the width of the temporal distribution of output signals with respect to the photon arrival times.

        <p>A typical SNSPD signal is shown in Figure 1a which illustrates the effect of electrical noise jitter on the system, which arises due to amplifier noise-induced shifts of the readout voltage that lead to fluctuations in the time at which the threshold is crossed. Electrical noise jitter can be reduced by engineering devices with higher operating currents and faster rise times, as well as by using lower-noise radio-frequency (RF) cryogenic amplifiers (see Ref. 20 for a review of recent efforts). Despite this progress, a reduction of the noise contribution down to the 1 ps level has so far been missing. In addition, it was recently realised that fluctuations in the longitudinal position of the photon absorption lead to significant changes in the detection latency (defined as the time between the absorption of a photon and the registration of an electrical output pulse). This occurs because the high kinetic inductance of typical nanowire structures renders the speed of RF pulse propagation along the wire to be a small fraction of the speed of light in vacuum. 24 Fortunately, this so-called "longitudinal geometric" jitter can be compensated, at least in part, by using a differential readout scheme with a low-noise amplifier at each end of the nanowire, 25 provided that an impedance matching taper is used to avoid reflections at the end of the nanowire. 24,26A typical SNSPD signal is shown in Figure 1a which illustrates the effect of electrical noise jitter on the system, which arises due to amplifier noise-induced shifts of the readout voltage that lead to fluctuations in the time at which the threshold is crossed.

        <p>In this work, we realise 5 µm-long NbN SNSPD devices (illustrated in Figure 2) designed to simultaneously minimise the longitudinal geometric and intrinsic jitter. The electrical noise jitter is also minimised through the use of a cryogenic RF amplifier and by maintaining a low device kinetic inductance, which ensures a fast rise of the readout signal 27 (see Methods for details). Achievement of low system jitter allows us to carry out a comprehensive study, demonstrating significant photon energy, nanowire width, and temperature dependence of the jitter (see Extended Data Figure 1), as well as intrinsic variations in the detection latency. These results make an important step towards probing the fundamental physics of photon detection and have guided us in refining the model of the detection mechanism in SNSPDs.In this work, we realise 5 µm-long NbN SNSPD devices (illustrated in Figure 2) designed to simultaneously minimise the longitudinal geometric and intrinsic jitter.

        <p>The IRF for a 80 nm-wide device is shown in Figure 2b, demonstrating a clear dependence on the detected wavelength. With 1550 nm light, we observed 4.6±0.2 ps jitter, which is reduced to 3.8±0.3 ps for 775 nm light, at the same bias current (see Figure 3 and Figure 4 for a comparison of a wider range of devices and wavelengths). Fundamental understanding of this effect starts from the consideration of the intrinsic detection latency. Numerical modelling has predicted that variation in photon energy should lead to changes in detection latency in SNSPDs [28][29][30] but until now it has not been possible to experimentally quantify the time scales involved in order to validate the models. A previous attempt 31 to study this time delay, based on the difference between the high photon flux bolometric response and the single photon response, suffers from a lack of calibration of longitudinal signal propagation effects 25 as well as the change of signal rise time which has been shown to depend on the number of absorbed photons. 32 To overcome these limitations, we implement a straightforward measurement of the relative latency between single photons of different wavelengths, synchronised in time, in order to measure the time scales involved (see Methods and Extended Data Figure 2 for a description of the experimental setup). Figure 1b shows that the detection signals resulting from 1550 nm photons are delayed by 4.2±0.4 ps relative to 775 nm photons. Reducing the bias current increases both the jitter and the relative detection latency, as illustrated in Figure 1c, hinting at the intrinsic link between the latency and jitter.The IRF for a 80 nm-wide device is shown in Figure 2b, demonstrating a clear dependence on the detected wavelength.

        <p>Figure 3a shows the effect of varying the nanowire width and bias current on the jitter while Figure 3c shows the relative latency change for these parameters. For a fixed bias current, the jitter and latency decreases for narrower nanowires and for higher energy photons. The same trend is evident in the normalised photon count rates (PCR) shown in Figure 3b: for a given bias current, increasing the photon energy or reducing the nanowire width leads to higher internal detection efficiency. The existence of saturated PCR plateaus suggests that the devices are operating with near-unity internal detection efficiency at high bias currents. 2 The link between these metrics can be interpreted qualitatively by introducing timedependence into the internal detection efficiency and calculating the detection latency as a function of energy retained in the nanowire following the photon absorption, as shown in Figure 1d (see Methods for details). For a uniform nanowire the amount of energy retained in the electronic system fluctuates from shot to shot, due to Fano fluctuations, 33 leading to latency changes, which is the jitter. From Figure 1d it is clear that a normal distribution of energy deposition leads to a positive-skew bell-shaped jitter histogram and for a given nanowire it is possible to reduce the overall jitter by either increasing the photon energy or increasing the bias current as illustrated in Figure 1e. We estimate that we are able to achieve up to 85% of the theoretical maximum depairing current (see Methods), which helps explain the low values of jitter achieved in this work.Figure 3a shows the effect of varying the nanowire width and bias current on the jitter while Figure 3c shows the relative latency change for these parameters.

        <p>The jitter reduction for increasing photon energies has been studied with the widest nanowire (120 nm), using wavelengths down to 273 nm, as illustrated in Figure 4a and the lowest achieved values of jitter are outlined in Figure 4d. As before, the jitter curves are correlated with the PCR curves (Figure 4b). The change in histogram shape for several wavelengths is seen in Figure 4c and it is clear that a long tail of detection events is present, which is expected to arise primarily due to detections in the tapering sections at the ends of the nanowire (see Figure 2). It is expected that focusing the light onto the straight section of the nanowire will significantly reduce this tail (see Supplementary Note 1 for analysis). We note that even once detections in tapering sections and bends are prevented, the simulations predict that the shape of the tail will not to be purely exponential.The jitter reduction for increasing photon energies has been studied with the widest nanowire (120 nm), using wavelengths down to 273 nm, as illustrated in Figure 4a and the lowest achieved values of jitter are outlined in Figure 4d.

        <p>As discussed earlier, in order to achieve low intrinsic jitter it is important to operate at a high fraction of the depairing current which calls for good nanowire uniformity (note that spatial nonuniformities are themselves a potential source of jitter). 30 We believe that an important factor in achieving the high uniformity, and thus low jitter presented in this work, is the use of RF-bias sputtered NbN films which creates a quasi-amorphous small-crystal structure. 34 Amorphous superconductors such as tungsten silicide (WSi) and molybdenum silicide (MoSi) are popular choices for SNSPD fabrication precisely due to their uniformity and typically saturated internal efficiency, indicating high fractions of depairing current. Unfortunately, this alone is not sufficient for low jitter operation. We characterised the relative latency of WSi devices, using the same low jitter design, which achieve a comparable fraction of the depairing current to the NbN devices, and found that it is a factor of 2-3.5 larger depending on the bias current (see Extended Data Figure 3 for details). Consequently, the jitter is a factor of two higher. Biasing at similar fractions of critical depairing current results in close functional dependencies of latency versus energy deposition (Figure 1d) for both NbN and WSi (for spatial non-uniformities one can describe their effect by introducing the effective deposited energy fluctuations). 33 Intrinsic timing jitter occurs due to variability (derivative of latency) of sensor latency with respect to fluctuating parameters, such as energy deposition and random spatial variations of material properties. As a result, the FWHM of the IRF is approximately proportional to the derivative of SNSPD latency with respect to energy deposition. We have also verified that MoSi devices have a similarly increased intrinsic jitter compared to NbN (although the relative latency data has not been presented so far). 35As discussed earlier, in order to achieve low intrinsic jitter it is important to operate at a high fraction of the depairing current which calls for good nanowire uniformity (note that spatial nonuniformities are themselves a potential source of jitter). 30 We believe that an important factor in achieving the high uniformity, and thus low jitter presented in this work, is the use of RF-bias sputtered NbN films which creates a quasi-amorphous small-crystal structure. 34 Amorphous superconductors such as tungsten silicide (WSi) and molybdenum silicide (MoSi) are popular choices for SNSPD fabrication precisely due to their uniformity and typically saturated internal efficiency, indicating high fractions of depairing current.

        <p>We have demonstrated that when seeking an SNSPD with low intrinsic jitter, the key characteristic to evaluate is the intrinsic latency, even though the details of time-and spatial-evolution of the highly nonequilibrium state following photon absorption are dependent on many individual material parameters. In that respect, the low jitter results presented in this work has been made possible through the use of low latency NbN devices with good uniformity. Our proposed method of characterising the relative latency proves to be a practical way to analyse and compare devices fabricated using different materials and designs, as well as matching the data to simulations. Reproducing the intrinsic relative latency is easier than comparing the IRF to microscopic models, since many sources of instrumental fluctuations and timing offsets can be eliminated. Furthermore, a model can average over transverse coordinate dependence, 29,36 Fano fluctuations, 33 and thermal fluctuations, reducing the complexity and computational demands of generating a full IRF for model validation.We have demonstrated that when seeking an SNSPD with low intrinsic jitter, the key characteristic to evaluate is the intrinsic latency, even though the details of time-and spatial-evolution of the highly nonequilibrium state following photon absorption are dependent on many individual material parameters.

        <p>While the current detection model (see Methods) neglects two-dimensional effects (known as transverse geometric jitter) 29 it can be used for qualitative interpretation of the data and we have taken an important step in showing that the calculated relative latency time-scales match the experimental data for narrow nanowires (see Figure 3c), while previous models considerably underestimate the timescales involved. 30 We have already observed the emergence of transverse geometric jitter for high photon energies with wide nanowires at low bias currents (see Supplementary Note 2) which highlights the need for further development of the detection models with the goal of achieving quantitative agreement with experiment.While the current detection model (see Methods) neglects two-dimensional effects (known as transverse geometric jitter) 29 it can be used for qualitative interpretation of the data and we have taken an important step in showing that the calculated relative latency time-scales match the experimental data for narrow nanowires (see Figure 3c), while previous models considerably underestimate the timescales involved. 30 We have already observed the emergence of transverse geometric jitter for high photon energies with wide nanowires at low bias currents (see Supplementary Note 2) which highlights the need for further development of the detection models with the goal of achieving quantitative agreement with experiment.</p>
        <p>Our results show that SNSPDs can outperform any other free-running single-photon detection technology in terms of jitter: we observed a jitter of 2.6±0.2 ps for visible wavelengths, whereas the lowest jitter achieved with Si avalanche diodes is 7.8 ps. 37 In the near-infrared, our results show 4.3±0.2 jitter and the best alternative detectors are indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) avalanche diodes, that are capable of 50 ps jitter. 38 Until this work, the lowest jitter achieved with SNSPDs was 14.2 ps for NIR wavelengths. 20 We note that although sub-picosecond jitter and single-photon sensitivity is achievable with commercial streak cameras, their temporal dynamic range is extremely limited -deeming them incapable of detecting both fast and slow processes simultaneously, which is possible with the SNSPD detectors achieved in this work.Our results show that SNSPDs can outperform any other free-running single-photon detection technology in terms of jitter: we observed a jitter of 2.6±0.2 ps for visible wavelengths, whereas the lowest jitter achieved with Si avalanche diodes is 7.8 ps. 37 In the near-infrared, our results show 4.3±0.2 jitter and the best alternative detectors are indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) avalanche diodes, that are capable of 50 ps jitter. 38 Until this work, the lowest jitter achieved with SNSPDs was 14.2 ps for NIR wavelengths. 20 We note that although sub-picosecond jitter and single-photon sensitivity is achievable with commercial streak cameras, their temporal dynamic range is extremely limited -deeming them incapable of detecting both fast and slow processes simultaneously, which is possible with the SNSPD detectors achieved in this work.</p>

        <p>The combination of an SNSPD with a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) module results in an optical sampling oscilloscope, 19 where an IRF width of 2.6 ps is equivalent to a signal bandwidth of about 135 GHz -comparable to the fastest available sampling oscilloscopes. We have demonstrated this capability by capturing a single-photon-level 100 GHz optical waveform using the detector developed here. 39 Laser ranging also benefits from SNSPDs with low timing jitter: detection of a single visible photon reflected from an object with 2.6 ps resolution yields a depth precision of 1 mm with a confidence of approximately 90%. Averaging of multiple detections adds further advantage, with a resolution of 10 µm possible after just 10,000 detected events. 19 Figure 5 shows a three-dimensional reconstruction of a small key achieved with a table-top laser-ranging scanner using the detector presented here (see Methods for details), which shows that millimetre-scale depth resolution is achievable with just tens of detected photons, highlighting the potential impact on laser ranging.

        <p>The observed saturation of jitter at short wavelengths (see Figure 4a), which is likely due to limits of the characterisation setup as well as the noise floor of our readout scheme, suggests that there is still room for further optimisation of the noise jitter and that the intrinsic jitter could approach the subpicosecond level as suggested by recent models. 29,30 This optimisation could be achieved using a near quantum-limited amplifier, 43 a superconducting digital readout element such as a nanocryotron, 44 by using an adiabatic taper to impedance match the nanowire to 50 Ω, 24,26 or by engineering SNSPDs with faster rise times. 27 Reaching the sub-picosecond level would also require experimental studies of the effect of transverse geometric jitter as well as the role of spatial inhomogeneities. 30 Our investigation has taken an important step towards better understanding the fundamental origin of timing jitter in SNSPDs and calls for further theoretical work to quantitatively reproduce the experimental data.The observed saturation of jitter at short wavelengths (see Figure 4a), which is likely due to limits of the characterisation setup as well as the noise floor of our readout scheme, suggests that there is still room for further optimisation of the noise jitter and that the intrinsic jitter could approach the subpicosecond level as suggested by recent models. 29,30 This optimisation could be achieved using a near quantum-limited amplifier, 43 a superconducting digital readout element such as a nanocryotron, 44 by using an adiabatic taper to impedance match the nanowire to 50 Ω, 24,26 or by engineering SNSPDs with faster rise times. 27 Reaching the sub-picosecond level would also require experimental studies of the effect of transverse geometric jitter as well as the role of spatial inhomogeneities. 30 Our investigation has taken an important step towards better understanding the fundamental origin of timing jitter in SNSPDs and calls for further theoretical work to quantitatively reproduce the experimental data.</p>
        <p>The devices were fabricated in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) cleanroom, patterned from a NbN film with a nominal thickness of 7 nm. We deposited the film in a reactive sputtering system, at room temperature on a 4 inch silicon wafer with a 300 nm-thick thermal oxide layer. 34 As deposited, the film sheet resistance was Rsq = 340 Ω/□ at room temperature and the residual resistance ratio was ρRRR = 0.8. The critical temperature of the film was measured to be Tc = 8.65 K. The entire device was patterned with one step of electron-beam lithography. We spun an 80 nm-thick positive-tone e-beam resist (gl2000, diluted to 5%) baked at 180°C for 2 minutes. The e-beam lithography was performed with a 125 kV system. We separated the writing into two steps. The first step exposed the nanowire, which was designed as a coplanar waveguide structure. To expose the gap area of the nanowire with fine edge roughness, the exposure beam current was 500 pA with a step size of 1 nm. The second step was to expose the outline of the electrical contacts. Because the size of the contacts exceeded the size of the maximum writing field, we applied a multi-pass method with a 10 nA beam current and a step size of 4 nm. We developed the chip in O-xylene at 5°C for 30 seconds and a subsequent rinse in isopropanol for another 30 seconds. To transfer the pattern to the NbN film, we performed a CF4 reactive ion etch at 50 W for 3 minutes. After the etch, resist was applied to protect the device from oxidisation and dicing. We first removed the residual gl2000 layer in 60ºC N-methyl pyrodone for 10 minutes, and then spun a new layer of gl2000 and a 1.5 µm-thick photoresist (Microposit S1813) for protection. After dicing, the S1813 was stripped with acetone while the gl2000 layer was left as a protection layer. It was possible to wire bond though the gl2000 layer directly to the NbN contact pad.The devices were fabricated in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) cleanroom, patterned from a NbN film with a nominal thickness of 7 nm.

We separated the writing into two steps. The first step exposed the nanowire, which was designed as a coplanar waveguide structure. To expose the gap area of the nanowire with fine edge roughness, the exposure beam current was 500 pA with a step size of 1 nm. The second step was to expose the outline of the electrical contacts. Because the size of the contacts exceeded the size of the maximum writing field, we applied a multi-pass method with a 10 nA beam current and a step size of 4 nm. We developed the chip in O-xylene at 5°C for 30 seconds and a subsequent rinse in isopropanol for another 30 seconds. To transfer the pattern to the NbN film, we performed a CF4 reactive ion etch at 50 W for 3 minutes. After the etch, resist was applied to protect the device from oxidisation and dicing. We first removed the residual gl2000 layer in 60ºC N-methyl pyrodone for 10 minutes, and then spun a new layer of gl2000 and a 1.5 µm-thick photoresist (Microposit S1813) for protection. After dicing, the S1813 was stripped with acetone while the gl2000 layer was left as a protection layer. It was possible to wire bond though the gl2000 layer directly to the NbN contact pad.</p>

        <p>The SNSPD and laser synchronisation signals were acquired simultaneously on a digital real-time oscilloscope. To investigate the effect of the oscilloscope sample rate, we carried out measurements with both 40 and 80 Giga-samples per second, which reduces the lowest jitter from 3.2 ps to 2.6 ps (See Figure 4a compared to Figure 4d). The reason for this reduction is due to an improved reproduction of both the SNSPD and synchronisation signals. Since the laser synchronisation signal had a rise time of approximately 50 ps, it is actually under-sampled with a rate of 40 Giga-samples per second, resulting in quantisation noise of the acquired waveform. The optimum analogue bandwidth setting of the oscilloscope was found to be 6 GHz, which is sufficiently high for the SNSPD signal which had a rise time (20% to 80%) of approximately 80 ps. Increasing the bandwidth further generates additional noise, which increases the noise jitter. The vertical scale setting of the oscilloscope was also optimised in order to minimise the noise floor of the input whilst limiting saturation effects. The residual quantisation and noise jitter was measured to be 1.5 ps by splitting the electronic synchronisation signal and passing one side through the cryogenic readout chain and running an IRF acquisition with the same settings. Since this value is close to the system jitter achieved, it is likely that even lower jitter could be achieved with further improvements to the measurement setup.The SNSPD and laser synchronisation signals were acquired simultaneously on a digital real-time oscilloscope.

        <p>It is difficult to obtain the absolute detection latency due to the complexity of calibrating the exact moment of photon absorption in the nanowire (see main text for discussion). Instead, we investigated the relative detection latency difference between two photon energies. Since the 775 nm and 1550 nm pulses are synchronised in our optical setup and follow the same optical path (see Extended Data Figure 2), an IRF was collected for each bias current with light of both wavelengths without realigning the beam, by simply changing the free-space filter. The delay through the two filters was verified to be the same, by using a 1064 nm pulsed laser for which both filters are transparent. The trigger level was kept the same for the two wavelengths at each bias current, and it was verified that the SNSPD pulse shape was the same for both wavelengths (see Extended Data Figure 4). The latency difference was calculated by measuring the shift of the 1550 nm data relative to 775 nm, taking the peak of the fitted IRF as the reference. Although the IRF does not follow an exponentially modified Gaussian exactly, it provides enough accuracy for extraction of the peak location and FWHM values.

        <p>A proof-of-principle laser-ranging experiment was carried out over a distance of 1 meter (see Extended Data Figure 5 for details of the setup) with a 1064 nm mode-locked laser and a fast scanning mirror. The collected light was focused onto the detector using a lens external to the cryostat, yielding a system efficiency on the order of 0.01%. With 1 mW of laser power, an additional 30 dB of channel attenuation was added to prevent detector saturation effects. The detection events were time-tagged using a Becker and Hickl SPC-150NXX TCSPC module which has an electronic IRF of 3 ps, minimum bin duration of 203 fs and a saturated acquisition rate of 10 Mcps. The system IRF was 6.2 ps (see Extended Data Figure 6). The three-dimensional image of a small key in Figure 5 was achieved using a 200 by 200 scan with a 20 ms dwell time at each location.A proof-of-principle laser-ranging experiment was carried out over a distance of 1 meter (see Extended Data Figure 5 for details of the setup) with a 1064 nm mode-locked laser and a fast scanning mirror.

        <p>We recently demonstrated a practical method of estimating the depairing current in superconducting nanowires based on the bias current dependence of the kinetic inductance. 47 By fabricating resonator structures from the same NbN film used for the detectors in this work we extracted a depairing current of 38.8 µA for a 120 nm-wide nanowire. The switching current of 33 µA for the 120 nm detector corresponds to 85% of the depairing current. The same technique was used for estimation of the depairing current in the WSi device studied (see Extended Data Figure 3).We recently demonstrated a practical method of estimating the depairing current in superconducting nanowires based on the bias current dependence of the kinetic inductance. 47 By fabricating resonator structures from the same NbN film used for the detectors in this work we extracted a depairing current of 38.8 µA for a 120 nm-wide nanowire.

        <p>The qualitative picture of intrinsic jitter can be drawn from very general considerations. Latency is one of the fundamental characteristics of any sensor response. 29,30 In SNSPDs, the monitored state is that of the condensate through its capacity to carry supercurrent without dissipation throughout the evolution of the non-equilibrium state formed during photoresponse. Considering a fully deterministic response, i.e. Supplementary Note 1 | Latency to slew rate correlation. In order to avoid current crowding, 1 the nanowire is connected to the wire terminals with a short tapering section (see Figure 2 in the main manuscript). If a photon detection occurs in this region of widening nanowire, then the overall detection latency will increase (see Figure 3 in main text for effect of nanowire width at a fixed bias current), resulting in a larger number of tail of events in the IRF histogram. As evidence towards this hypothesis we have studied the correlation between the shot-to-shot slew rate of the SNSPD signals and the threshold crossing delay. An additional effect of a detection in a widening section of a nanowire is that during the hotspot expansion, the final resistance will be lower and since the slew rate is proportional to the kinetic inductance (fixed) divided by the hotspot resistance. It means that the slew rate will be lower for detection in the tapering sections. It is therefore possible to use the slew rate as an indicator of whether the detection happened in the tapering sections. Supplementary Figure 1a confirms this since there is a correlation between the slew rate and detection delay -the lower the slew rate, the wider the nanowire section responsible for the detection and hence the larger the delay. In order to infer how the jitter histogram would look like without the effect of the tapering sections we set a threshold in the slew rate such as to reduce the contribution of the tail events. Supplementary Figure 1b shows the resulting IRF with and without the slew rate thresholding, achieving a significant reduction of the tail events. Note that the tail still deviated from exponential, which is expected based on the simulations (see Supplementary Note 3). This analysis indicates that for best performance the light absorption should be concentrated away from tapering sections and bends. Supplementary Note 2 | Changes in the IRF tail for short wavelengths. When characterizing the 120 nm-wide nanowire, we noticed that the tail of the distribution for the shortest wavelength light has a significantly different shape, especially at low bias currents. Supplementary Figure 2 shows a comparison of the instrument response functions for three wavelengths (273 nm, 400 nm and 800 nm) for different bias currents. At the lowest bias current of 13 µA, there is a systematic deviation (below 0.25 of the peak) for the 273 nm wavelength data (Supplementary Figure 2a). This deviation decreases at longer wavelengths (Supplementary Figure 2b,c). The origin of this effect can be attributed to differing detection latency for various transverse coordinates of absorption in the nanowire. 2 This effect is known as 'transverse geometric' jitter.
