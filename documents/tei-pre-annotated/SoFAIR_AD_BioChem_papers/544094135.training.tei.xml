        <p>Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) offer a treatment option for COVID-19 in patients with severe disease and are especially important in high-risk patients where vaccination is not an option. Given the importance of understanding the evolution of resistance to mAbs by SARS-CoV-2, we reviewed the available in vitro neutralisation data for mAbs against live variants and viral constructs containing spike mutations of interest. Unfortunately, evasion of mAb induced protection is being reported with new SARS-CoV-2 variants. The magnitude of neutralisation reduction varied greatly between mAb-variant pairs. For example, sotrovimab retained its neutralisation capacity against Omicron/BA.1 but showed reduced efficacy against BA.2, BA.4/BA.5 and BA.2.12.1. At present, only bebtelovimab has been reported to retain its efficacy against all SARS-CoV-2 variants considered here. Resistance to mAb neutralisation was dominated by the action of epitope single amino acid substitutions in the spike protein. While not all observed epitope mutations result in increased mAb evasion, amino acid substitutions at nonepitope positions and combinations of mutations also contribute to evasion of neutralisation. This review highlights the implications for the rational design of viral genomic surveillance and factors to consider for the development of novel mAb therapies.Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) offer a treatment option for COVID-19 in patients with severe disease and are especially important in high-risk patients where vaccination is not an option.

        <p>The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in nearly 600 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 6 million deaths as of August 2022 1 . Vaccines, antiviral drugs, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and non-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdowns, contact-tracing, isolation, social distancing and intensive care and/or oxygen use have been deployed to control the spread of the virus and mitigate the harms of disease [2][3][4] . Global efforts to develop and deploy vaccinations have been unprecedented in their speed and scale and have contributed greatly to reducing transmission and severe disease in infected individuals. Antivirals such as remdesivir, molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir, and mAbs, administered either individually, such as sotrovimab or a , a a a a , a E ( a a + tixagevimab), have provided much-needed additional treatment options for the clinically vulnerable and those who progress to severe disease 3 .The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in nearly 600 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 6 million deaths as of August 2022 1 .

        <p>As of August 2022, a dozen mAbs that target the virus's spike protein (Table 1) have been approved for clinical use in treating those infected by, or exposed to, SARS-CoV-2. Note, those mAbs that mediate the immune response by targeting host proteins are outside the scope of this review 5 Virus-targeting mAbs are designed to reduce COVID-19 severity by binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein leading to direct neutralisation, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC 6 ) or complement activation. These prevent the virus from binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the surface of human cells, which is required for infection. The mAbs approved for clinical use and discussed here target the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, but some mAbs in the early stages of development target other spike domains 7,8 . The efficacy of mAbs has been threatened by the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants resistant to existing treatments 9 . On April 16 th 2021, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ended the Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) for bamlanivimab due to resistance shown by variants (Iota, Epsilon and others) carrying the L452R and E484K substitutions 10 .As of August 2022, a dozen mAbs that target the virus's spike protein (Table 1) have been approved for clinical use in treating those infected by, or exposed to, SARS-CoV-2.

        <p>Since then, the mAb sotrovimab and the cocktails Ronapreve (casirivimab + imdevemab) and bamlanivimab + etesevimab have also had limitations placed on their use as resistant variants continue to emerge and spread [11][12][13] .Variants of concern (VOCs) Delta and Omicron, BA.1 and BA.2 lineages, have spread globally [14][15][16][17] , with Gamma and Beta previously associated mainly with regional spread 18 (and sequencing bias) in Brazil and South Africa respectively and travel to these regions. At present the Omicron lineages BA.4/BA.5 (defined by the same spike mutations, in particular the RBD substitutions L452R and F486V, deletion 69-70, and the reversion R493Q, relative to BA.2) and BA.2.12.1 sublineage (defined by the additional RBD mutation L452Q, relative to BA.2) are emerging globally and causing localised epidemic waves [19][20][21] (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig. 1).

        <p>The acquisition by SARS-CoV-2 of mutations conferring evasion properties to mAbs will almost certainly continue, leading to negative clinical outcomes and impacting the utility and longevity of mAbs in managing the ongoing pandemic. Here, we consider studies in the primary literature presenting data on the neutralisation of globally circulating VOCs by mAbs, with the aim of identifying and characterising the mutations that lead to this resistance. We discuss how knowledge of the dynamics of viral evasion of mAbs can contribute to viral surveillance and the development of novel mAb treatments, as well as inform predictions of resistance that may arise in the future.The acquisition by SARS-CoV-2 of mutations conferring evasion properties to mAbs will almost certainly continue, leading to negative clinical outcomes and impacting the utility and longevity of mAbs in managing the ongoing pandemic.

        <p>a a a a a a a in vitro studies of antibody protection against viral infection 26 . The fold-reduction in neutralisation (FRN) is calculated by measuring the concentration of mAb required to prevent infection of cells by virus or pseudovirus carrying a mutated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and comparing the results to one or more wildtype control sequences (usually the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence sampled early in the pandemic), under the same experimental conditions. This allows comparisons between studies while mitigating the confounding effects of differences in experimental protocol. We reviewed all 118 published studies reporting neutralisation data on clinically approved mAbs against VOCs and other mutants up to 1 st August 2022 (Supplementary Data File 1) and calculated the geometric mean FRN (mFRN) for each mAb-variant pair (Fig. 1B,2, Supplementary Fig. 2,3) to represent the extent of resistance of a variant relative to that mAbs ability to neutralise wildtype virus. The use of geometric mean is considered the appropriate measure for comparing titers generated by serial dilution 27 . Geometric mean IC50 values were also calculated (Supplementary Fig. 4) to show the absolute ability of each mAb to neutralise each variant in vitro.

        <p>As shown in Fig. 1B, the Alpha VOC remains susceptible to most mAbs with mild evasion, relative to wild type of etesevimab neutralisation (mFRN: 9.3; IC50[ng/ml]: 200)(Fig. 1B, Supplementary Fig 4). Delta, despite being generally less resistant to mAbs overall (with mFRN &lt;4 to 13 out of 15 mAbs; IC50[ng/ml] &lt;50 for 12 out of 14 for which IC50 data were available), demonstrated reduced neutralisation by bamlanivimab (mFRN: 650; IC50[ng/ml]: 5000) and regdanvimab (mFRN: 37; IC50[ng/ml]: 67).As shown in Fig. 1B, the Alpha VOC remains susceptible to most mAbs with mild evasion, relative to wild type of etesevimab neutralisation (mFRN: 9.3; IC50[ng/ml]: 200)(Fig. 1B, Supplementary Fig 4).

        <p>Beta and Gamma VOCs exhibited reduced neutralisation for 5 out of 16 mAbs with mFRN &gt;30 (Fig. 1B). This is likely due to both having mutations at the 417, 484, and 501 positions in the spike RBD (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig 1). However, considerable variability in FRN results from the different assays underpinning the mFRN values has been observed for these two variants (Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Data File X). For example, several studies reported only minimal or no resistance (FRN &lt;15, n=5) of casirivimab by Beta, whereas others presented very strong evasion (FRN &gt;250, n=13). This may be due to differences in experimental protocols between studies ( 28,29 e.g., incubation time, viral system and target cells used). We compared the fold change results for different viral assay systems (virus isolate versus pseudovirus) and found the distribution of results to be similar in each group (Supplementary Fig. 5) indicating that different viral systems do not have a confounding effect on our results. This is in line with the high correlation between neutralisation results using different viral systems observed elsewhere 30 While, details on cell type and other experimental parameters were not readily available for all studies, making it possible that differences in these factors are confounding given that cell type and hACE2 expression have been shown to affect the susceptibility of cells to the virus 30 , the over all trends in fold change are likely to be robust. 31 and smaller retrospective studies [32][33][34] during Omicron waves, suggest that high doses of both treatments have an important role to play in treating and preventing infection with Omicron variants, although further clinical evidence is required to confirm this alongside the close monitoring of emergent resistance 35 .Beta and Gamma VOCs exhibited reduced neutralisation for 5 out of 16 mAbs with mFRN &gt;30 (Fig. 1B).

        <p>The high fold change associated with Evusheld against BA.1 (mFRN: 75) (Fig. 1B) compared to bebtelovimab, romlusevimab, and sotrovimab (mFRN: 1.1, 0.74, and 3.3), despite having an IC50 value (IC50 [ng/ml]: 270) (Supplementary Fig 4) within the range of the other antibodies (IC50 [ng/ml]: 2.6, 240, and 290), highlights an important limitation of this metric for comparing the neutralisation capacities of different antibodies. Because fold change compares the mAb neutralsiation of the variant against neutralisation of the WT, mAbs that have very high levels of neutalisation against WT will have higher fold change values against a variant than another mAb that neutralises the WT less but the variant similarly. However, fold change is much better suited to our focus on a given mAbs neutralisation capacity against a variant relative to its neutralisation of other variants.The high fold change associated with Evusheld against BA.1 (mFRN: 75) (Fig. 1B) compared to bebtelovimab, romlusevimab, and sotrovimab (mFRN: 1.1, 0.74, and 3.3), despite having an IC50 value (IC50 [ng/ml]: 270) (Supplementary Fig 4) within the range of the other antibodies (IC50 [ng/ml]: 2.6, 240, and 290), highlights an important limitation of this metric for comparing the neutralisation capacities of different antibodies.

        <p>We did not systematically analyze neutralisation data on the recently emerged BA.2.75 variant, but early studies show it to have some resistance to bebtelovimab but increased sensitivity to tixagevemab and casirivimab [36][37][38] .We did not systematically analyze neutralisation data on the recently emerged BA.2.75 variant, but early studies show it to have some resistance to bebtelovimab but increased sensitivity to tixagevemab and casirivimab [36][37][38] .</p>
        <p>a a a a a a VOC mutations cannot conclusively show the impact of specific mutations on mAb efficacy due to interactions between spike mutations in the same variant. Whereas, FRN data from viral constructs that contain single mutations of interest on a wildtype background only assesses the influence of individual mutations on mAb efficacy. For this reason, we compared published FRN values from assays involving viral constructs with single mutations against those using VOC spike proteins (Fig. 2). Interestingly, mutations had similar effects on resistance regardless of whether they were studied individually or in VOC representative sequences (Fig. 2). VOCs were resistant to a mAb if they contained mutations that were resistant to that mAb in isolation, i.e., on the reference/control background.a a a a a a VOC mutations cannot conclusively show the impact of specific mutations on mAb efficacy due to interactions between spike mutations in the same variant.

        <p>Imdevimab showed reduction of the neutralising activity in the presence of BA.1 (mFRN: 600) and in the presence of BA.1 RBD mutations, G446S (mFRN: 390) and N440K (nFRN: 92), when studied individually (Fig. 2), and this trend was also seen for the other Omicron sub-lineages. 66Casirivimab was observed to be evaded by Beta (mFRN: 110) and by mutants containing B a RBD a a : E484K ( FRN: 15) and K417N (mFRN: 17), and by Gamma (mFRN: 89), and single mutant constructs with K417T and E484K (mFRN: 7.1 and 15, respectively), but not with N501Y (mFRN: 1.1) (Fig. 2). On the other hand, whenever variants lacked mutations that individually reduced neutralisation, the mAbs generally retained their activity against the variants themselves. This was the case for Delta which retained its susceptibility to casirivimab (mFRN: 0.71), as did single mutants containing the Delta substitutions, L452R and T478K (mFRN: 1.4 and 1.0, respectively)(Fig. 2). Additionally, no resistance to bebtelovimab was displayed by any of the variants or any of the single mutant constructs (Fig. 2). In cocktails of mAbs, consisting of non-competing antibodies that target different regions of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, resistance occurs whenever the combination of mutations in a VOC results in resistance to each of the individual mAbs. For instance, BA.1 displayed strong resistance to Ronapreve (casirivimab + imdevimab) (mFRN: 840) (Supplementary Fig. 3), with K417N and Q493R evading neutralisation by casirivimab (mFRN: 17, and 38 respectively), and N440K, G446S, and S371L resistant to imdevimab (mFRN: 92, 390, and 22 respectively).Imdevimab showed reduction of the neutralising activity in the presence of BA.1 (mFRN: 600) and in the presence of BA.1 RBD mutations, G446S (mFRN: 390) and N440K (nFRN: 92), when studied individually (Fig. 2), and this trend was also seen for the other Omicron sub-lineages. 66Casirivimab was observed to be evaded by Beta (mFRN: 110) and by mutants containing B a RBD a a : E484K ( FRN: 15) and K417N (mFRN: 17), and by Gamma (mFRN: 89), and single mutant constructs with K417T and E484K (mFRN: 7.1 and 15, respectively), but not with N501Y (mFRN: 1.1) (Fig. 2).

In cocktails of mAbs, consisting of non-competing antibodies that target different regions of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, resistance occurs whenever the combination of mutations in a VOC results in resistance to each of the individual mAbs. For instance, BA.1 displayed strong resistance to Ronapreve (casirivimab + imdevimab) (mFRN: 840) (Supplementary Fig. 3), with K417N and Q493R evading neutralisation by casirivimab (mFRN: 17, and 38 respectively), and N440K, G446S, and S371L resistant to imdevimab (mFRN: 92, 390, and 22 respectively).</p>
        <p>The association between the mAb neutralisation levels of single mutant constructs and full variants can also be found in the context of the bamlanivimab and etesevimab cocktail (Supplementary Fig. 3). Beta and Gamma, and mutants containing E484K alone were observed to be resistant to the cocktail (mFRN: 510 and 410, and 20, respectively) (Supplementary Fig. 3). The greater reduction observed with Beta and Gamma in comparison to E484K taken in isolation, could be due to the combination of E484K with K417N and K417T, found in Beta and Gamma respectively. However, K417N and K417T in isolation showed no loss of neutralisation against the cocktail (mFRN: 1.4, and 0.30). Similarly, the strong evasion of the cocktail by all the Omicron sub-lineage variants is matched by that conferred by E484A (mFRN: 48), with BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.2.12.1 also carrying Q493R (mFRN: 100), and BA.4 and BA.5 carrying F486V (mFRN: 140). In contrast, the neutralisation capacity of the cocktail was retained against Delta (mFRN: 1.1) as it was against the single mutants carrying the Delta RBD mutations L452R (mFRN: 4.2) and T478K (mFRN: 1.5).The association between the mAb neutralisation levels of single mutant constructs and full variants can also be found in the context of the bamlanivimab and etesevimab cocktail (Supplementary Fig. 3). Beta and Gamma, and mutants containing E484K alone were observed to be resistant to the cocktail (mFRN: 510 and 410, and 20, respectively) (Supplementary Fig. 3). The greater reduction observed with Beta and Gamma in comparison to E484K taken in isolation, could be due to the combination of E484K with K417N and K417T, found in Beta and Gamma respectively. However, K417N and K417T in isolation showed no loss of neutralisation against the cocktail (mFRN: 1.4, and 0.30). Similarly, the strong evasion of the cocktail by all the Omicron sub-lineage variants is matched by that conferred by E484A (mFRN: 48), with BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.2.12.1 also carrying Q493R (mFRN: 100), and BA.4 and BA.5 carrying F486V (mFRN: 140). In contrast, the neutralisation capacity of the cocktail was retained against Delta (mFRN: 1.1) as it was against the single mutants carrying the Delta RBD mutations L452R (mFRN: 4.2) and T478K (mFRN: 1.5).</p>
        <p>For other mAbs too, strong evasion of neutralisation by all Omicron sub-lineage variants aligns with the resistance of viral constructs containing single Omicron RBD mutations. S371L, present in the BA.1 and BA.1.1 variants, conferred resistance to amubarvimab, and etesevimab (mFRN: 17 and 15) (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. S3).666 S371F, present in the BA. Although these observations support the hypothesis that in general the observed resistance of VOCs to specific mAbs is due to effects of individual resistance mutations acting in isolation 39 , in several cases the resistance observed in variants was greater than the sum of the evasive effects of the spike lineage-defining mutations alone. For instance, the neutralising activity of amubarvimab against BA.1 and BA.1.1 was markedly reduced (mFRN: 180 and 220) although S371L and Q493R were individually found to confer only moderate-to-weak evasion of neutralisation (mFRN: 17 and 11, respectively) (Supplementary Fig. 3) . Similarly, BA.1 and BA.1.1 strongly evaded both cilgavimab (mFRN: 220 and 820, respectively) and tixagevimab (mFRN: 360 and 400) administered alone, yet none of the constituent BA.1 RBD mutations conferred mFRN &gt;10 to either mAb. Thus, the strong evasion by BA.1 and BA.1.1 of these mAbs can not be explained by the additive effects of their RBD mutations in isolation, indicating that other mechanisms may be at play. One possibility is that mutations outside the spike RBD contribute to resistance. Another, is that synergistic effects between RBD mutations lead to enhanced resistance when they are present in combination.For other mAbs too, strong evasion of neutralisation by all Omicron sub-lineage variants aligns with the resistance of viral constructs containing single Omicron RBD mutations. S371L, present in the BA.1 and BA.1.1 variants, conferred resistance to amubarvimab, and etesevimab (mFRN: 17 and 15) (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. S3).666 S371F, present in the BA.

Similarly, BA.1 and BA.1.1 strongly evaded both cilgavimab (mFRN: 220 and 820, respectively) and tixagevimab (mFRN: 360 and 400) administered alone, yet none of the constituent BA.1 RBD mutations conferred mFRN &gt;10 to either mAb. Thus, the strong evasion by BA.1 and BA.1.1 of these mAbs can not be explained by the additive effects of their RBD mutations in isolation, indicating that other mechanisms may be at play. One possibility is that mutations outside the spike RBD contribute to resistance. Another, is that synergistic effects between RBD mutations lead to enhanced resistance when they are present in combination.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, there are examples where single mutations of interest show higher reduction of neutralisation than the full variant itself. For example, the mutants bearing the BA.1 and BA.1.1 mutation S371L displayed moderate resistance to sotrovimab (mFRN: 20)(Supplementary Fig. 3), whereas resistance observed with BA.1 and BA.1.1 was only mild (mFRN: 3.3 and 2.4). BA.1 mutations other than S371L, such as G496S 40 , might antagonistically dampen the effect of S371L leading to only moderate resistance overall. This possibly explains why BA.2 missing mutations at positions 446 and 496 (relative to BA.1) was found to be less sensitive to sotrovimab (mFRN: 22 vs 3.3) than BA.1. Alternatively, NTD mutations may allosterically alter the BA.2 RBD leading to antigenic effects 41 . This mechanistic ambiguity of how mutations interact highlights the need for comparative studies where combinations of mutations are taken into consideration.On the other hand, there are examples where single mutations of interest show higher reduction of neutralisation than the full variant itself.

        <p>To better understand the effect of single mutations on mAb activity we investigated the role of mutations occurring at epitope and non-epitope positions (S Data File 2) on the reduction of the neutralisation by mAbs. As expected, mutations causing the strongest resistance were found within the binding footprint of the mAb at cognate epitope positions in the spike RBD (Fig. 3A-B). However, not all mutations at epitope positions were observed to cause mAb resistance, and a small number of strongly resistant mutations were found at distal, non-epitope positions in the RBD (Fig. 3A-B) and in the N-terminal domain (NTD) (Supplementary Fig. 6A) able to generate long-range allosteric perturbations. Generally, mutations close to epitope positions, at the +/-1 proximal positions, but not inside the epitope, were observed to not cause reductions in neutralisation (Supplementary Fig. 6B).To better understand the effect of single mutations on mAb activity we investigated the role of mutations occurring at epitope and non-epitope positions (S Data File 2) on the reduction of the neutralisation by mAbs.

        <p>At some sites, the level of evasion depended on the specific amino acid substitution introduced by the mutation. For example, in the case of casirivimab and mutations at 417, the substitution of a Lysine (K) with either Glutamic acid (E) or Arginine (R) was associated with a marked reduction of the neutralisation activity (mFRN: 160 and 61 respectively)(S Data File 3), whereas more moderate evasion was observed with Asparagine (N) (mFRN: 17), with an even smaller effect with Threonine (T) (mFRN: 7.1). Additionally, the single mutant carrying the substitution of Valine (V) with Threonine (T) at 445 showed strong resistance to casirivimab (mFRN: 110), whereas the Alanine substitution (V445A) presented no evasion (mFRN: 1.7)(S Data File 3). Similarly, sotrovimab was strongly evaded by mutants containing P337L (mFRN: 160) and P337R (mFRN: 216) in isolation, but only mildly by those containing P337T and P337H (mFRN: 8.5 and 5.8, respectively), and not at all by the P337S single mutant (mFRN: 1.At some sites, the level of evasion depended on the specific amino acid substitution introduced by the mutation.

        <p>There are some cases in which mutations outside of the epitope contribute to resistance against the mAb, displaying a potential allosteric influence. The S371L single mutant conferred moderate evasion of Amubarivimab (mFRN: 17), imdevimab (mFRN: 22), sotrovimab (mFRN: 20) and etesevimab (mFRN: 15) despite not being present in the epitope of any of these mAbs (Fig. 3A). (Romlusevimab also displayed reduced neutralisation against S371L, mFRN: 17, but no epitope data is yet available). Similarly, mutants containing E406W alone markedly evaded both casirivimab (mFRN: 84) and imdevimab (mFRN: 110)(S Data File 3); E406D was resistant to casirivimab (mFRN: 51); F377K evaded sotrovimab (mFRN: 300), and P499S imdevimab (mFRN: 210). The broad evasion of S371L and mutations at 406 suggests that, given that each mAb has different epitopes, those mutations might affect the global spike conformation, rather than making local changes to specific epitopes only (Fig. 3C).There are some cases in which mutations outside of the epitope contribute to resistance against the mAb, displaying a potential allosteric influence.

        <p>Several studies have been carried out to investigate the structural mechanisms through which non-epitope mutations can disrupt antibody binding. The S371L mutation was found to alter the conformation of both the 371-376 loop and the 365-370 helix, leading to disruptive interactions with mAbs at those sites 42,43 . At the same positon, S371F leads to the repositioning of the N343 glycan, potentially causing resistance to sotroviamb 44 . E406W was observed to cause allosteric remodeling of sites contacted by cilgavimab and Ronapreve (casirivimab + imdevimab), reducing binding by these mAbs 45 , with allostery being central to spike dynamics more generally 46,47 . G496S may preclude mAb binding through steric clash, which may explain why a different mutation at the same site, G496R, was observed to cause resistance of etesivimab 48 . However, other studies showed G496S to stabilise interactions with mAbs by the formation of hydrogen bonds, indicating that mutational effects to be mAb specific 40 . Nabel et al. found that the D364N, A372S and A372T mutations may cause mAb evasion by supporting N-linked glycosylation at N370 49 . Addition of a bulky glycan at this site obstructs mAb binding to the epitope directly and through stabilisation of RBD a at hides the epitope (Fig. 3C) 50 . Using an amino acid interaction (AAI) approach, mutations at the non-epitope 373, 440 and 446 positions have been reported to disrupt sotrovimab binding via interactions with amino acids that are in the epitope 51 . Molecular dynamics-based approaches have also helped to delineate how residues in the NTD and S2 domain may be able to allosterically affect antigenicity and infectivity 41 . Taken together, these observations show that comprehensive analysis of mAb evasion by SARS-CoV-2 must include non-epitope mutations on top of the more prominent epitope mutation resistance effects.Several studies have been carried out to investigate the structural mechanisms through which non-epitope mutations can disrupt antibody binding.

        <p>Protein structure studies have reported on the mechanisms by which specific epitope substitutions affect the interaction of mAbs with the spike protein, shedding light on why some substitutions lead to resistance but others do not. The E484A mutation is likely to cause the loss of salt bridges between spike and class 2 mAbs (e.g bamlanivimab) 40,52 , and destabilising energy changes in bonds with class 1 casirivimab 40 . These different effects on bonding to antibodies of different classes may explain why E484A conferred strong evasion of bamlanivimab (class 2, mFRN: 570), but only mild resistance to casirivimab (class 1, mFRN: 9.8). Similarly, explanation of the evasion of bamlanivimab (mFRN: 750), casirivimab (mFRN: 15), tixagevimab (mFRN: 6.8) and regdanvimab (mFRN: 8.7) by mutants containing E484K has been offered by computational modeling that reveals the reversal of the side chain charge to significantly alter the electrostatic complementarity of mAb binding (Fig. 3C) 53 . E484K, E484A and E484Q mutations all drive resistance to bamlanivimab and casirivimab to some extent which, given the different biochemical properties of the amino acid substitutions, suggests in this case it is the loss of Glutamic acid (E) that is important, rather than the amino acid which it is replaced with. This is supported by the identification of E484 as a key binding site for some mAbs 54 , and by the loss of hydrogen bonds between E484 and an experimental mAb due to mutation (Fig. 3C) 55 . Structural analysis reveals L452R to disrupt a hydrophobic binding pocket, potentially explaining the loss of neutralisation by antibodies targeting this site in Delta and BA.4/BA.5 variants 21 . BA.4/BA.5 also carries F486V, which involves the loss of phenylalanine from binding site of multiple mAbs 21 .

        <p>The structural changes introduced by spike mutations have consequences not only for mAb evasion but also viral infectivity, replication, transmissibility and stability 24,[56][57][58][59] . Some antigenic mutations decrease infectivity as they affect the ability of RBD to bind the hACE2 receptor required for entry into the human cell 49,[60][61][62][63][64][65][66][67] Other mutations can compensate for this detrimental effect by increasing hACE2 binding 52 , allowing the virus to retain its infectivity while reducing susceptibility to the antibody response. The BA.1 spike mutational profile demonstrates this as the antigenic evasion mutations G496S, Y505H, K417N, S371L, S373P, S375F alone decrease hACE2 binding affinity, but overall BA.1 infectivity is retained through the compensatory increase in affinity due to N501Y, S477N, G493K, and Q498R 23,52,60 . It is possible that the BA.4/BA.5 affinity for ACE2 is further increased by the electrostatic complementarity of L452R, offering explanation of the transmission advantage of both BA.4/BA.5 and Delta 21 . Other mutations, such as S373P and S375F, do not have immune evasive effects in isolation, but do so in combination 51 . These combinations are able to arise as the individual mutations have positive effects on other aspects of viral fitness and so experience positive selection before the full immune evasive combination is achieved 51 .

        <p>Care must be taken when extrapolating between neutralisation assays and the clinical efficacy of mAbs. Post-vaccination sera neutralisation titers strongly correlate with protection from symptomatic infection and severe disease 68,69 , and mAb neutralisation may be expected to follow a similar trend. A perfect correlation would not be expected due to mechanisms other than neutralisation, such as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity, antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis, and complement activation, which are also important to antibodies' role in combating viral infection, and other aspects of the immune response such as T cells that are not captured in neutralisation assays. Such effects likely contribute to the generally strong in vivo efficacy of sotrovimab 70 , ated IC50 values (Supplementary Fig. 4). Some mAbs have their Fc domains altered, meaning they are able to participate in effector functions to different degrees 71,72 .

        <p>Although indications that Omicron infections are less clinically severe are encouraging 77 , the reduced susceptibility of Omicron lineages BA.1, BA.2, and BA.4/BA.5 to neutralisation by many of the mAbs available for clinical use highlights the risk that novel variants pose to the efficacy of mAb treatments in the present and future. The currently rapidly emerging BA.4/BA.5 lineages, in particular, show the highest levels of mAb evasion of any VOC to date. Pandemic management strategies must account for the possibility that future variants will evade all currently available mAbs. There are several precautionary steps that can be taken (Fig. 4). Firstly, reliance must not be placed on any single control strategy so that the cost of any strategy failing is reduced. This is being achieved already with the combination of vaccination, monoclonal antibodies, antivirals, and non-pharmaceutical interventions such as self-isolation [2][3][4] . Secondly, mAb development strategies could minimise resistance to mAbs by targeting conserved epitopes 78 and susceptible epitopes of future variants using knowledge of patterns of resistant mutations, such as those discussed in this review. Maintaining a diverse range of viable drugs will ensure that effective COVID-19 treatments are available, even if some variants are resistant to a subset of drugs. Thirdly, clinical mAb treatment needs to be conducted in a manner that mitigates the risk of directly causing the emergence and spread of resistant variants. Resistance mutations have been observed to emerge when patients are treated with mAbs or convalescent plasma 56,[79][80][81] .

        <p>Desirable clinical outcomes can be supported by virus genome sequencing to determine the variant causing infection, allowing the most appropriate mAb treatment to be selected. Similarly, alignment of regional treatment guidelines with information about which variants are circulating and at what frequencies will support the effective logistical deployment of the available treatments.

        <p>Viral surveillance and mAb development efforts will benefit greatly from considering not only single epitope mutations, but also non-epitope mutations alongside combinational and synergistic dynamics. These efforts must extend beyond antigenicity to the full range of viral traits, all of which play a role in determining the antigenic mutations that rise to prominence. The data discussed here depict mAb evasion to be dominated by the isolated effect of single mutations at epitope positions, and therefore that single mutational analysis can provide important insights of the mechanisms of mAb evasion for past and future variants. However, the evasive effects of nonepitope mutations and combinations of mutations mean that a complete understanding of mAb dynamics cannot be achieved by analysis of single epitope mutation alone. Rather, neutralisation data should be combined with structural, combinatorial, molecular dynamic and evolutionary studies to allow the preemption of novel future mutations that may have similar effects. With this in mind, public health agencies should continue to routinely survey sequence data generated locally and worldwide to detect viral mutations and variants that might impact adversely on the efficacy of therapeutics (Fig. 4).
