        <p>Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 94 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with breast cancer (BC) risk and 18 associated with ovarian cancer (OC) risk. Several of these are also associated with risk of BC or OC for women who carry a pathogenic mutation in the high-risk BC and OC genes BRCA1 or BRCA2. The combined effects of these variants on BC or OC risk for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers have not yet been assessed while their clinical management could benefit from improved personalized risk estimates. Methods: We constructed polygenic risk scores (PRS) using BC and OC susceptibility SNPs identified through populationbased GWAS: for BC (overall, estrogen receptor [ER]-positive, and ER-negative) and for OC. Using data from 15 252 female BRCA1 and 8211 BRCA2 carriers, the association of each PRS with BC or OC risk was evaluated using a weighted cohort approach, with time to diagnosis as the outcome and estimation of the hazard ratios (HRs) per standard deviation increase in the PRS. Results: The PRS for ER-negative BC displayed the strongest association with BC risk in BRCA1 carriers (HR ¼ 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 1.23 to 1.31, P ¼ 8.2Â10 À53 ). In BRCA2 carriers, the strongest association with BC risk was seen for the overall BC PRS (HR ¼ 1.22, 95% CI ¼ 1.17 to 1.28, P ¼ 7.2Â10 À20 ). The OC PRS was strongly associated with OC risk for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers. These translate to differences in absolute risks (more than 10% in each case) between the top and bottom ARTICLEBackground: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 94 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with breast cancer (BC) risk and 18 associated with ovarian cancer (OC) risk.

        <p>Women who carry a pathogenic mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene are at high risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers. The clinical management of healthy women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation involves a combination of frequent screening, risk-reducing surgeries, and chemoprevention (1). Important decisions include whether or not to undergo preventive mastectomy and the age at which to undergo risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO). These choices are invasive, have substantial side effects, and are associated with adverse psychological effects (2)(3)(4)(5)(6). Improved personalized cancer risk estimates may help to identify women at particularly high risk or with high risk of disease at early ages who may benefit from early intervention as well as women at lower risk who may opt to delay surgery or chemoprevention (7). This could be achieved by incorporating risk-modifying factors into risk prediction.Women who carry a pathogenic mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene are at high risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers.

        <p>Population-based genome-wide association studies have identified 94 common breast and 18 ovarian cancer susceptibility loci (8)(9)(10). While a smaller number of these loci were associated with risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers at stringent statistical significance thresholds, the effect sizes in carriers are generally similar to those in the general population, once differences in the distributions of breast tumor estrogen receptor status in mutation carriers and noncarriers are taken into account (9,11). Individually the identified breast and ovarian cancer riskmodifying variants confer only small to modest increases in risk. However, their effects can be combined into polygenic risk scores (PRSs), which may be associated with much larger relative risks (12,13). Prior to the clinical implementation of these findings, it is important to assess the predictive utility of PRS in terms of discrimination, calibration, and potential for risk stratification (14).Population-based genome-wide association studies have identified 94 common breast and 18 ovarian cancer susceptibility loci (8)(9)(10).

        <p>Because women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are already at high risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers, the combined effects of risk-modifying variants could lead to much larger differences in the absolute risk of developing the disease as compared with the general population (12,13,15,16). Earlier studies investigating the effect of PRS on the absolute risks of breast and ovarian cancer risks of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers demonstrated potential for risk stratification (13,(17)(18)(19). However, these have been based on small numbers of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; &lt;15) and most were restricted to theoretical projections of the PRS association rather than empirical evaluations.Because women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are already at high risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers, the combined effects of risk-modifying variants could lead to much larger differences in the absolute risk of developing the disease as compared with the general population (12,13,15,16).

For these analyses, subjects were categorized into PRS percentile groups.

        <p>This is the first evaluation of the combined effects of all known common breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility loci on cancer risks for women who carry a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. We found strong evidence of association with cancer risks for PRSs constructed using the results of population-based studies. These associations provide strong support for the hypothesis of a polygenic component for breast and ovarian cancer risks, respectively, that is largely shared between the general population and BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. Moreover, the pattern of associations with the breast cancer subtype-specific PRS confirms the importance of tumor ER status (11). The PRS based on SNPs associated with ER-negative disease in the general population displayed a much stronger association with overall breast cancer risk for BRCA1 carriers than the ERpositive PRS, consistent with the observation that the predominant tumor subtype in BRCA1 carriers is ER negative (34,35). In contrast, the majority of tumors in BRCA2 carriers tend to be ER positive. Consistent with this, the ER-positive PRS and the PRS for overall breast cancer constructed from general population data exhibited stronger associations than the ER-negative PRS in BRCA2 carriers.This is the first evaluation of the combined effects of all known common breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility loci on cancer risks for women who carry a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.

Consistent with this, the ER-positive PRS and the PRS for overall breast cancer constructed from general population data exhibited stronger associations than the ER-negative PRS in BRCA2 carriers.</p>
        <p>Using the overall, ER-positive, and ER-negative breast cancer PRSs developed by Mavaddat, the per SD hazard ratio estimates in mutation carriers were smaller than the corresponding per SD odds ratio estimates for breast cancer in the populationbased study (20). These observations suggest that the relative extent by which the SNPs modify breast cancer risks in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers is somewhat smaller than that in the general population, perhaps because a subset of SNPs do not combine multiplicatively with mutation status. Alternatively, these observations may reflect a difference in the design: Under a simple proportional hazards model, the predicted odds ratio is larger than the corresponding rate ratio (HR), but this difference is usually small (36). Moreover, some overestimation cannot be ruled out entirely for the per SD odds ratio estimates from the population-based study because of a winner's curse effect. Interestingly, the hazard ratio estimate for the association of the ovarian cancer PRS with ovarian cancer risk was statistically significantly higher for BRCA2 than for BRCA1 mutation carriers. As a result, this PRS had also a higher discriminatory ability for ovarian cancer for BRCA2 carriers compared with BRCA1 mutation carriers.Using the overall, ER-positive, and ER-negative breast cancer PRSs developed by Mavaddat, the per SD hazard ratio estimates in mutation carriers were smaller than the corresponding per SD odds ratio estimates for breast cancer in the populationbased study (20).

        <p>Each of the most strongly associated PRSs displayed statistically significant interactions with age, with the exception of the ovarian cancer PRS in BRCA2 carriers, such that the hazard ratio per unit PRS decreased with increasing age. One possible explanation for the observed interaction between age and the ERnegative breast cancer PRS in BRCA1 mutation carriers could due to the use of the ER-negative breast cancer PRS from the general HR, log scale population to predict the risk of overall breast cancer risk for BRCA1 mutation carriers. Although the majority of breast cancers in BRCA1 mutation carriers are ER negative, the proportion of ERnegative breast tumors decreases with increasing age at diagnosis (35). If the population-based ER-negative PRSs were also associated primarily with ER-negative breast cancers in BRCA1 mutation carriers, the ER-negative PRS would be more predictive of breast cancer in BRCA1 carriers at younger ages. In contrast, in BRCA2 carriers the proportion of ER-positive disease was found to decrease with increasing age at diagnosis (35). Therefore, the overall PRS from the general population, which is associated primarily with ER-positive breast cancers, may be more predictive of breast cancer in BRCA2 mutation carriers at younger ages. Alternatively, it is possible that genetic risk modification has a stronger effect on developing early-onset breast cancer.Each of the most strongly associated PRSs displayed statistically significant interactions with age, with the exception of the ovarian cancer PRS in BRCA2 carriers, such that the hazard ratio per unit PRS decreased with increasing age.

        <p>A limitation of the present study is our inability to take family history into account because this information was not available for the majority of samples. Although the tests of association remain valid, it was therefore not possible to investigate how the associations vary by family cancer history.A limitation of the present study is our inability to take family history into account because this information was not available for the majority of samples.

        <p>Overall, the discrimination achieved by the PRS investigated in the current study was moderate. The highest discrimination was achieved by the ovarian cancer PRS in BRCA2 carriers. We found the overall breast cancer PRS to have somewhat lower discriminatory ability in mutation carriers compared with the general population (20). However, given the different study designs, ER tumor specificity in mutation carriers, and different measures of relative risk, these model performance estimates may not be directly comparable.Overall, the discrimination achieved by the PRS investigated in the current study was moderate.

        <p>One possible explanation for the differences in the relative risk of the PRS between the mutation carriers and the population-based study is that not all variants identified in population-based studies are actually associated with risk in mutation carriers, perhaps as a result of functional redundancy (9). Conversely, variants that specifically modify risk in mutation carriers, examples of which have already been reported (13,18), would not be included in PRSs derived from populationbased studies, and such variants might improve discrimination. On the other hand, because of the large sample sizes available in population-based studies, the SNP selection and the logOR estimates used as weights for these PRSs are likely to be more reliable than for PRSs based on mutation carriers. We also derived BRCA1-and BRCA2-specific PRSs that include variants discovered by population-based studies but only those showing evidence of association in mutation carriers. This approach makes use of the discovery power of population-based studies while accounting for possible mutation carrier-specific differences in associations. However, the SNP selection and weights were based on results from the same data set as that used in the present analysis. For this reason, we investigated the associations of mutation carrier-specific PRSs without weights to reduce the possible overfitting. An analysis in an independent sample of mutation carriers will be required to assess whether these mutation-specific PRSs outperform population-based PRSs.One possible explanation for the differences in the relative risk of the PRS between the mutation carriers and the population-based study is that not all variants identified in population-based studies are actually associated with risk in mutation carriers, perhaps as a result of functional redundancy (9).

        <p>The present study demonstrates that there are large differences in the absolute cancer risks between BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers with higher vs lower values of the PRS. These differences are much greater than those found in populationbased studies (20,37) because the average risks conferred by BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are already high (17,18). The clinical management of healthy women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation involves a combination of frequent screening, riskreducing surgery, and possibly chemoprevention (1), which can associated with substantial side effects. In particular, RRSO leads to premature menopause, is associated with increased morbidity, and has implications for family planning (38,39). Therefore, the timing of RRSO has to be carefully considered.The present study demonstrates that there are large differences in the absolute cancer risks between BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers with higher vs lower values of the PRS.

        <p>There are no widely accepted risk thresholds for RRSO in mutation carriers: RRSO is recommended to all carriers on the basis of their average risk. 41). However, on the basis of our analyses, the cumulative risk of ovarian cancer for those at the lowest 1% of the PRS by age 40 years is predicted to be 0.7%, and 20% of BRCA1 mutation carriers are predicted to have a risk of ovarian cancer of less than 1.3% by age 40 years. Therefore, the current results may be used to develop risk-based thresholds for RRSO recommendations. One possibility would be to assume that women with BRCA1 mutations would not be offered RRSO until their cumulative risk of ovarian cancer approaches or exceeds 2.8%. A similar rule has recently been recommended for the counseling of women with mutations in moderate-risk genes (42). The ages at which women with BRCA1 mutations would reach a cumulative risk of ovarian cancer of 2.8% are 48 years for those at the 1st percentile of the PRS, and 46, 45, 44, and 43 years for those at the 5th, 10th, 20th, and 30th percentiles of the PRS, respectively. For these women, deferring oophorectomy to these ages as opposed to the recommended age of 35 to 40 years may be preferable for childbearing and to avoid very early menopause. Another option would be to use risk-based thresholds defined for the general population. For example, a 10% lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is often cited as a recommended threshold for RRSO (43). Based on our results, BRCA2 carriers at the 10th percentile of the ovarian cancer PRS have an estimated 6% lifetime risk and approximately 38% of BRCA2 mutation carriers have a lifetime risk of ovarian cancer that is less than 10%. Women at this lower end of the risk spectrum might opt to delay RRSO to near or after natural menopause in order to avoid the harmful longer-term adverse effects of a surgically induced premature menopause, and this also provides a longer period for childbearing. Therefore, the PRS may be informative in guiding women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations on the optimal timing of RRSO and can identify women at lower risk who may opt for less intensive interventions, such as salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy. Decisions in relation to breast cancer prevention could also be influenced by refined risk estimates. For example, the BRCA1 carriers at the 90th percentile of the ER-negative breast cancer PRS had an estimated breast cancer risk of 19% by age 40 years and 39% by age 50 years, compared with 5% by age 40 years and 21% by age 50 years for carriers at the 10th percentile of the PRS. As with RRSO, there are currently no widely accepted risk thresholds for offering risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy (RRBM) for women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. However, studies in nonmutation carriers have shown that the uptake and timing of RRBM is directly related to the magnitude of breast cancer risk (44), and similar arguments may be applicable to mutation carriers. To provide comprehensive risk prediction, the PRS should be combined with other risk factors, including family history. Such a model would form the foundation for the development of risk-based clinical management guidelines for mutation carriers. In parallel, it will be necessary to perform risk communication studies to assess the acceptability of risk stratification in women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.There are no widely accepted risk thresholds for RRSO in mutation carriers: RRSO is recommended to all carriers on the basis of their average risk. 41).

        <p>In conclusion, the results demonstrate that these PRSs could be useful in risk prediction for mutation carriers. Incorporating these PRSs into risk prediction models for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, together with other risk modifiers, may allow for more personalized risks for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers and ultimately facilitate better management of mutation carriers.In conclusion, the results demonstrate that these PRSs could be useful in risk prediction for mutation carriers.
