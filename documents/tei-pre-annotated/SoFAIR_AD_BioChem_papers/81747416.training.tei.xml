        <p>Background: Single-guide RNA (sgRNA) is one of the two key components of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 genome-editing system. The current commonly used sgRNA structure has a shortened duplex compared with the native bacterial CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-transactivating crRNA (tracrRNA) duplex and contains a continuous sequence of thymines, which is the pause signal for RNA polymerase III and thus could potentially reduce transcription efficiency.</p>
        <p>Results: Here, we systematically investigate the effect of these two elements on knockout efficiency and showed that modifying the sgRNA structure by extending the duplex length and mutating the fourth thymine of the continuous sequence of thymines to cytosine or guanine significantly, and sometimes dramatically, improves knockout efficiency in cells. In addition, the optimized sgRNA structure also significantly increases the efficiency of more challenging genome-editing procedures, such as gene deletion, which is important for inducing a loss of function in non-coding genes.</p>
        <p>Conclusions: By a systematic investigation of sgRNA structure we find that extending the duplex by approximately 5 bp combined with mutating the continuous sequence of thymines at position 4 to cytosine or guanine significantly increases gene knockout efficiency in CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing experiments.</p>
        <p>The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system has recently been developed into a powerful genome-editing technology [1][2][3][4][5][6]. This system is composed of two components: the nuclease Cas9 and the guide RNA. After maturation, the native type-II CRISPR guide RNA is composed of a 42-nucleotide CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and an 89-nucleotide transactivating crRNA (tracrRNA) [6] (Figure S1a in Additional file 1). Jinek et al. [6] systematically studied the minimal sequence requirement of the guide RNA in vitro and linked two minimal sequences together to create the short-version single-guide RNA (sgRNA; +48 nucleotides; Figure S1b in Additional file 1). However, a longer version of the sgRNA (+85 nucleotides), which is 37 nucleotides longer at the 5' end (Figure S1c in Additional file 1), was shown to be much more efficient [7][8][9] and is now commonly used. This commonly used sgRNA has a shortened duplex compared with the native guide RNA (Figure S1a, c in Additional file 1). In addition, there is a continuous sequence of Ts, which is the pause signal for RNA polymerase III; this signal could potentially reduce transcription efficiency and knockout efficiency. Hsu et al. [9] showed that changing these two elements did not have a significant effect on knockout efficiency and concluded that the sgRNA (+85 nucleotides) without mutations and duplex extension is the most active sgRNA architecture. However, Chen et al. [10] reported that sgRNAs with a mutated continuous sequence of Ts and extended duplex significantly enhance the imaging efficiency of a dCas9 (a mutated version of Cas9 lacking nickase activity)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein in cells, suggesting that changing these two elements enhances dCas9 binding to target sites and might also increase the knockout efficiency of Cas9. In this study, we systematically investigated the effect of changing these two elements on knockout efficiency and found that, overall, extending the duplex and mutating the continuous sequence of Ts significantly improved knockout efficiency.</p>
        <p>The current most commonly used sgRNA design has the duplex shortened by 10 bp compared with the native crRNA-tracrRNA duplex (Fig. 1a), which does not seem to reduce its functionality in vitro [6]. Hsu et al. [9] also showed that extending the duplex appeared to have no effect on knockout efficiency in cells. However, Chen et al. [10] showed that extending the duplex significantly enhances imaging efficiency of the dCas9-GFP fusion protein in cells. We suspected that extending the duplex might increase knockout efficiency in cells. To test this hypothesis, we extended the duplex in two sgRNAs targeting the CCR5 gene, as shown in Fig. 1a, and determined the knockout efficiency of these mutants in TZM-bl cells. Extending the duplex by 1, 3, 5, 8, or 10 bp significantly increased the knockout efficiency in both sgRNAs tested, and extending the duplex by 5 bp appeared to yield the highest efficiency at the protein level (Fig. 1b; Figure S2 in Additional file 1). The modification rate at the DNA level was also confirmed by deep sequencing of target sites (Additional file 2), and the results correlated well with the results determined at the protein level (Fig. 1b; Figure S2 in Additional file 1). Since measuring the modification rate by deep sequencing is more expensive and labor intensive, we mainly relied on fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to determine the CCR5 disruption rate in this study. When the effect of extending the duplex was tested for another sgRNA (sp2), the results Green indicates the 3' 34 nucleotides, which are not required for sgRNA functionality in vitro but are required in cells; red indicates the extended base pairs. b Extension of the duplex increased knockout efficiency. Constructs harboring sgRNAs targeting the CCR5 gene were co-transfected with a Cas9-expressing plasmid into TZM-bl cells. An sgRNA targeting the HIV genome served as mock control. The GFP-positive cells were sorted out 48 hours after transfection, and the gene modification rates were determined at the protein and DNA levels, respectively. Protein level disruption: the expression of CCR5 was determined by flow cytometry analysis. The raw data are shown in Figure S2 in Additional file 1. DNA level modification rate: the genomic DNA was extracted, and the target sites were amplified and deep-sequenced with a MiSeq sequencer. The raw data are provided in Additional file 2. c The experiment in (b) at the protein level was repeated for another sgRNA, sp2. The difference with (b) is that the cells were not sorted, but the CCR5 disruption rate was measured in GFP-positive cells. The raw data are shown in Figure S2 in Additional file 1. d Mutation of the RNA polymerase (Pol III) pause signal significantly increased knockout efficiency. The mutated nucleotides are shown in bold. The raw data are shown in Figure S3 in Additional file 1. The graphs represent biological repeats from one of three independent experiments with similar results, shown as mean ± standard deviation (n = 3). Significance was calculated using Student's t-test: *P &lt; 0.05; **P &lt; 0.01; ***P &lt; 0.005; ****P &lt; 0.001. O original, M mutant were consistent with those for sp1 (Fig. 1c; Figure S2 in Additional file 1). Thus, extending the duplex appears to increase the knockout efficiency of the CRISPR-Cas9 system.</p>
        <p>Because the continuous sequence of Ts after the guide sequence is the pause signal for RNA polymerase III [11], the effect of its disruption in sgRNAs has been previously studied [9,10]. We suspected that mutating the continuous sequence of Ts might also improve knockout efficiency in cells. Accordingly, we mutated this sequence at different positions and determined the knockout efficiency of the mutants (Fig. 1d; Figure S3 in Additional file 1). The knockout efficiency was increased in all mutants, and the mutation at position 4 had the greatest effect.</p>
        <p>Next, we systematically investigated the effect of extending the duplex while mutating the fourth T in the sequence of Ts (Fig. 2a; Figure S4 in Additional file 1). Consistent with the result shown in Fig. 1b, mutating the fourth T increased the knockout efficiency significantly for all four sgRNAs tested (Fig. 2a). On top of the increase due to mutation, extending the duplex also increased the knockout efficiency, reaching a peak at around 5 bp but then declining with longer extensions, although the pattern appears to be slightly different for different sgRNAs (Fig. 2a), which is consistent with Chen et al.'s results showing that modifying both elements significantly enhances the imaging efficiency of a dCas9-GFP fusion protein in cells [10].</p>
        <p>We previously tested the effect of mutating T→A on knockout efficiency without extending the duplex (Fig. 1c). Next, we also wanted to test the effect of mutating T→A, C, or G while also extending the duplex. Consistent with previous observations, mutations at position 4 generally had the highest knockout efficiency, although mutating T→C at position 1 had a similar effectiveness. In addition, mutating T→C or G generally had higher knockout efficiency than mutating T→A at various positions (Fig. 2b; Figure S5 in Additional file 1). Thus, mutating T→C or G at position 4 yielded the highest knockout efficiency.</p>
        <p>Based on these results, mutating T→G or C at position 4 and extending the duplex by ~5 bp appears to achieve the optimal sgRNA structure, with the highest Fig. 2 Knockout efficiency can be further increased by combining duplex extension with disruption of the continuous sequence of Ts. a The effect of duplex extension when mutating the fourth T to an A in four sgRNAs. The raw data are shown in Figure S4 in Additional file 1. b The effect of mutation of Ts at the indicated positions to A, C, or G when also extending the duplex by 5 bp. The raw data are shown in Figure S5 in Additional file 1. The graphs represent biological repeats from one of three independent experiments with similar results, shown as mean ± standard deviation (n = 3). Significance was calculated using Student's t-test: *P &lt; 0.05; **P &lt; 0.01; ***P &lt; 0.005; ****P &lt; 0.001. M mutant knockout efficiency. Therefore, we compared the knockout efficiency of the original and optimized structures for 16 sgRNAs targeting CCR5. A typical optimized structure had a T→G mutation at position 4 and extended the duplex by 5 bp. In 15 out of 16 sgRNAs, the optimized structure increased the knockout efficiency significantly and for sp10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 did so dramatically (Fig. 3a; Figure S6 in Additional file 1).</p>
        <p>To exclude the possibility that the increase in knockout efficiency using the optimized sgRNA structure is limited to TZM-bl cells or the CCR5 gene, we also tested eight sgRNAs targeting the CD4 gene in Jurkat cells. Consistent with the results observed in TZM-bl cells for the CCR5 gene, the optimized sgRNA design also significantly increased the efficiency of knocking out the CD4 gene in the Jurkat cell line (Fig. 3b; Figure S7 in Additional file 1). Thus, the optimized sgRNA structure appears to generally increase knockout efficiency.</p>
        <p>The beneficial effect of extending the duplex generally reached a peak at around 5 bp of added length (Fig. 2a). To test whether extending the duplex by 5 bp is superior to extending it by 4 bp or 6 bp, we extended the duplex by 4 bp or 6 bp and compared the resulting knockout efficiencies for the 16 sgRNAs in Fig. 3a. As shown in Figure S8 in Additional file 1, extending the duplex by 4 bp or 6 bp appeared to yield similar knockout efficiency as 5 bp in most cases.</p>
        <p>Previously, Chen et al. [10] showed that mutating T→A at position 4 in combination with extending the duplex by 5 bp significantly enhanced the imaging efficiency of the dCas9-GFP fusion protein in cells. Our results showed that extending the duplex by 4-6 bp and mutating T→C or G at position 4 significantly increased knockout efficiency. To compare the effect of two sgRNA designs on increasing the knockout efficiency, we randomly selected ten sgRNAs targeting CCR5 and compared their knockout efficiencies with different mutations. As shown in Fig. 3c, all of the T→C and most (nine out of ten) of the T→G mutations had significantly higher knockout efficiency than the T→A mutation. It is noteworthy that, although in most cases the T→C mutation had a similar level of knockout efficiency as the T→G mutation, it had a significantly higher knockout efficiency in sp11 (+11 %, P = 0.006) and sp19 sgRNAs (+6 %, P = 0.026) (Fig. 3c; Figure S9 in Additional file 1), suggesting that the T→C mutation might be the best choice. Creation of a frame-shift mutation with an sgRNA is generally insufficient to investigate the loss of function of noncoding genes, such as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) or microRNA genes. A better strategy is to excise all or part of the gene of interest, which requires cutting at two positions simultaneously and linking the two breakpoints together. The efficiency of generating this type of deletion mutation is very low with current sgRNA design templates; however, the deletion efficiency was improved dramatically (around tenfold) in all four pairs of sgRNAs tested here (Fig. 4). If the original sgRNA structure, in which the deletion efficiency ranged from 1.6-6.3 % (Fig. 2c), was used to delete target genes, one would have to screen hundreds of colonies to identify the colonies with the deletion, which is a daunting task. Using the optimized sgRNAs, in which the deletion efficiency ranged from 17.7-55.9 % (Fig. 4), the number of colonies that would need to be screened to identify those with the deletion would be within the limits of feasibility. Thus, the optimized sgRNA template would simplify the genome-editing procedure, thereby enhancing its potential utility.</p>
        <p>Mutating the contiguous Ts is likely to increase the production of sgRNAs. Thus, to understand how modifications increase the knockout efficiency, we measured the RNA level of different sgRNA structures. First, we checked the CCR5 knockout efficiency of the sgRNA with the extended duplex or a mutated continuous sequence of Ts or with both. Consistent with our previous study, both modifications individually increased knockout efficiency, and in combination further increased knockout efficiency (Fig. 5a; Figure S10 in Additional file 1). Next, we measured the sgRNA levels in transfected cells. Mutating the continuous sequence of Ts significantly increased the sgRNA level, and it appears that extending the duplex also slightly increased the sgRNA level (Fig. 5b). To ascertain if increased sgRNA production or the sgRNA structure or both is responsible for increased knockout efficacy, we transfected activated CD4+ T cells with Cas9 protein preloaded with in vitro transcribed sgRNAs, which excludes the effect of RNA level change because in this case the amount of sgRNA remains the same. In initial experiments, the results using the in vitro transcribed sgRNAs were highly variable, because these molecules form dimers to variable extents which interfered with their functionality (Fig. 5c). Cas9 can only bind to the monomers but not the dimers, in which the sgRNA structure is not maintained. The ratio of monomers to dimers was not fixed between samples, which led to highly variable results. However, this problem was solved by a heating and quick cooling step (Fig. 5c), as we have previously shown for other small RNAs with duplex structures [12]. With pure monomer sgRNAs, it appeared that Cas9 preloaded with sgRNAs with an extended duplex has higher knockout efficiency (Fig. 5d; Figure S11 in Additional file 1), suggesting that the structural change of extending the duplex can by itself increase Cas9 functionality. Next, we transfected in vitro transcribed sgRNAs into cells stably expressing Cas9 and showed that extending the duplex by itself increases knockout efficiency (Fig. 5e; Figure S11 in Additional file 1), most likely because of the structural change and not because of changes in RNA levels.</p>
        <p>We performed all our experiments with transient plasmid transfection, in which the copy number of the Cas9 3b was transcribed in vitro and preloaded into Cas9. The complex was electroporated into activated primary CD4+ T cells. Knockout efficiency was determined as in Fig. 3b. The raw data are shown in Figure S11 in Additional file 1. e In vitro transcribed sp7 was electroporated into TZM-Cas9 cells. Knockout efficiency was determined as in Fig. 3b. The raw data are shown in Figure S11 in Additional file 1. The graphs represent biological repeats from one of three independent experiments with similar results, shown as mean ± standard deviation (n = 3). Significance was calculated using Student's t-test: *P &lt; 0.05; **P &lt; 0.01 and the sgRNA can vary considerably. Low multiplicity of infection (MOI) of lentivirus vector harboring the Cas9 or the sgRNA should provide relatively consistent copy numbers of Cas9 and sgRNA in infected cells. Therefore, to determine sgRNA functionality more rigorously, we first created cell lines stably expressing Cas9 by infecting TZM-bl or JLTRG-R5 cells with lentivirus harboring a Cas9-expressing cassette and selecting the cells stably expressing Cas9. We then infected these cells with lentivirus harboring sgRNAs with different structures at low MOI. The results were similar to the experiments done with plasmids in both cell lines. In fact, the difference between structures shown for lentiviral infection was even greater than what we observed with plasmids (Fig. 6; Figure S12 in Additional file 1), suggesting that the optimized sgRNAs are indeed superior to commonly used sgRNA (+85 nucleotides). These results also suggest that the optimized sgRNAs would perform better for CRISPR-Cas9-based genome-wide pooled screenings, which use lentivirus to deliver sgRNAs at low MOI [13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20].</p>
        <p>In this study, we systematically investigated the effect of extending the duplex and mutating the continuous sequence of Ts, providing guidance for optimizing sgRNA structure. Our results clearly show that extending the duplex and mutating the continuous sequence of Ts at position 4 to C or G significantly increases knockout efficiency in most cases, and the extent of the improvement in knockout efficiency is striking (Figs. 3 and4). The general optimized sgRNA structure is illustrated in Fig. 7.</p>
        <p>With the optimized structure, most sgRNAs showed high knockout efficiency. Out of a total of 24 sgRNAs with an optimized sgRNA structure tested, 18 showed &gt;50 % knockout efficiency. By contrast, only four sgRNAs showed &gt;50 % knockout efficiency using the original sgRNA structure (Fig. 3a,b). This optimized sgRNA template not only reduces concerns that knockout experiments might not work due to low sgRNA functionality, but also significantly increases the efficiency of more challenging genome-editing procedures, such as gene deletion.</p>
        <p>Previously, Hsu et al. [9] showed that extending the duplex by 10 bp in combination with mutating the continuous sequence of Ts did not increase knockout efficiency. Our results show that extending the duplex can significantly increase knockout efficiency, but after reaching a peak at around 5 bp, the effect declines, which might explain this discrepancy. Our conclusion is supported by Chen et al.'s study [10], in which they showed that extending the duplex and mutating the continuous sequence of Ts significantly enhances the imaging efficiency of the dCas9-GFP fusion protein in cells. The effects of these two modifications appear to be different. Mutating the continuous sequence of Ts significantly increased sgRNA production (Fig. 5b), which is likely to be the result of increased transcription efficiency due to the disrupted pause signal [11]. The results with in vitro transcribed sgRNAs suggest that extending the duplex by itself also increases Cas9 functionality because of the structural change (Fig. 5d,e since any effect of the RNA level was excluded in this experiment. When sgRNA is expressed inside cells, both effects contribute to increase the functionality. It is possible that the modified sgRNA structure might enhance binding to Cas9 or increase its stability. Further work is needed to determine how exactly sgRNA structure increases functionality.</p>
        <p>Extending the duplex by ~5 bp combined with mutating the continuous sequence of Ts at position 4 to C or G significantly increased CRISPR-Cas9 gene knockout efficiency.</p>
