        <p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) has an enormous impact on global disease burden, affecting millions of people worldwide and ranking as a leading cause of disability for almost three decades. Past molecular studies of MDD employed bulk homogenates of post-mortem brain tissue, obscuring gene expression changes within individual cell types. Here, we used singlenucleus transcriptomics to examine ~80,000 nuclei from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of male individuals with MDD (n=17) and healthy controls (n=17). We identified 26 cellular clusters, and over 60% of these showed differential gene expression between groups. We found the greatest dysregulation in deep layer excitatory neurons and immature oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), contributing almost half (47%) of all changes in gene expression. These results highlight the importance of dissecting cell-type specific contributions to the disease, and offer opportunities to identify new avenues of research and novel targets for treatment.</p>
        <p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex and heterogeneous disorder that affects an estimated 300 million people worldwide 1 . Genetic factors underlying the risk for MDD have been investigated using including genome-wide association studies, among other approaches 2 .</p>
        <p>Although some genetic associations have been detected, it remains a challenge to extract causal disease mechanisms from these findings 3 . It has been positing that MDD results from dysregulation of monoaminergic transmission, largely implicating the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems, has dominated the field for several decades. More recently, other factors have been associated with MDD, including glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission 4,5 , glial cell function, including astrocytic and oligodendrocytic contributions [6][7][8] , blood-brain barrier integrity 6 , and inflammation 9 . Given the wide variety of cell types in the brain and their complex interactions, investigative approaches with cell-type specificity are especially needed to gain insight into psychiatric phenotypes including MDD.</p>
        <p>The interpretation of differential gene expression in bulk brain tissue homogenates is complicated by the heterogeneous cellular composition of the sample. Single-cell sequencing approaches have revealed that gene expression patterns in the brain are cell type specific, not only differentiating major classes of cells such as neuronal and glial cells, but even differentiating subtypes of glial cells and neurons 10,11 . Therefore, it is difficult to verify whether subtle molecular differences observed from tissue homogenates are explained by the disease state or by differences in cell type composition between samples 12 Recently developed techniques for high-throughput single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing provide a solution for addressing this inherent drawback to bulk tissue experiments 11,13 .</p>
        <p>High-throughput droplet-based single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) allows the profiling of thousands of nuclear transcriptomes, by utilizing nucleus-specific barcodes and unique molecular identifiers (UMI) to tag individual RNA molecules. snRNA-seq yields comparable, albeit distinct, information 14 from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), while facilitating the analysis of frozen tissues, which are not amenable to the isolation of intact cells. While there has been considerable interest in using scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq datasets to gain insight into the processes underlying complex brain disorders [15][16][17] , very few direct comparisons of single-nucleus human brain gene expression has yet been performed in a psychiatric phenotype using highthroughput technologies.</p>
        <p>Here, we sequenced ~80,000 nuclear transcriptomes from the prefrontal cortex of MDD cases and psychiatrically healthy controls and identified cell type specific differentially expressed genes. These results point to gene expression changes in predominantly two cell types, oligodendrocyte precursor cells and deep layer excitatory neurons. The relationships between and functions of the differentially expressed genes from these two cell clusters suggest impairments to FGF signalling, steroid hormone receptor cycling, immune function, and altered cytoskeletal regulation (related to changes in synaptic plasticity). This approach to snRNA-seq can effectively interrogate subtle phenotypes with improved resolution in archived brain tissue, and provide novel directions for follow-up studies.</p>
        <p>To assess the involvement of individual cell types in the pathophysiology of MDD, we examined nuclei from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), a region implicated in the pathology of major depressive disorder 18 . We used a droplet-based single-nucleus method optimized for use with postmortem brain tissue to assess a large number of nuclei. We measured 78,886 nuclei from 34 brain samples, half from patients who died during an episode of MDD, and the other half from matched psychiatrically healthy individuals (Table 1, Supplementary Tables 123). The experimental design is depicted in Fig. 1. On average, we sequenced to a depth of almost 200 million reads per sample (Supplementary Table 1). Given that glial cells have consistently been found to have fewer transcripts than neuronal cells 10,11 , we used custom filtering criteria based on the distribution of UMIs per nucleus detected to recover a substantial number of glial cells (see Methods, Supplementary Fig. 1a-e, Supplementary Table 4). In an initial subset of 20 subjects, applying our custom filtering increased the total number of cells 1.8-fold but increased the number of non-neuronal cells by almost 6-fold (data not shown). More than 90% of the nuclei passing these filtering criteria had less than 5% reads from mitochondrially encoded genes (Supplementary Fig. 1f). The average gene count across nuclei ranged from 2144 in neurons to 1144 genes in glia (Supplementary Table 5). UMI counts were approximately twice the gene count for all cell types, as expected for this level of sequencing depth (Supplementary Table 5). Between sample groups, there were no significant differences between cases and controls in the median gene count per nucleus (t test p=0.12), median UMI count per nucleus (t test p=0.14), and number of cells detected per individual (t test=0.07) (Supplementary Table 1).</p>
        <p>In order to identify different cell types present in the brain samples, we applied unsupervised graph-based clustering 19 using the first 50 principal components derived from the 2135 most variable genes across individual nuclei (Methods, Supplementary Fig. 2a-b). After stringent quality control (Methods), we identified 26 distinct clusters (Fig. 2a). Each cluster was annotated using a combination of known cell type markers for excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and nonneuronal cells, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), endothelial cells, and microglia (see Methods for full list of markers, Supplementary Table 6, Supplementary Fig. 3a-p). Gene expression patterns specific to cell type clusters were visualised using a 
            <rs type="software">DotPlot</rs> (Fig. 2b), average and median gene expression heatmaps (Supplementary Fig. 4a-b), and violin plots (Fig. 2c-e) to form a consensus for annotation.
        </p>
        <p>The clusters generated from our data are consistent with those previously reported in snRNAseq of human PFC (Supplementary Fig. 5) 11 . Gene expression patterns previously linked to specific cortical layers (see Methods) coincide with our clustering of excitatory cells. In Fig. 2c, the genes are arranged from top to bottom in order of their expression across the cortical layers (first 17 rows, from the layer I/II to layer VI). There is a gradient of expression of these genes across the excitatory clusters. For example, clusters Ex1, Ex4, and Ex7-9 had high expression of TLE4 (layer VI specific). Ex1, Ex8, and Ex9 showed concurrent expression of layer V/VI markers such as TOX. Ex6 and Ex7 additionally showed expression of the layer IV specific gene RORB. HTR2C, which is specific to a subset of layer V neurons, was prominent in Ex1 alone. PCP4, which is also layer V specific, was present in Ex1-3, Ex7, and Ex9. Superficial layer (I-III) markers such as CUX2 and RASGRF2 were mainly seen in the large cluster, Ex10. Likewise, inhibitory cell types demonstrated subtype specific gene expression patterns. For example, In7 was classified as inhibitory-parvalbumin because it expressed GAD1 and PVALB, and lacked VIP and SST (Fig. 2d).</p>
        <p>Multiple astrocytic clusters were also identified, and while the typical sub-classification of astrocytes is based on their morphology within grey or white matter 20 , we used only grey matter for these samples. As such, based on the higher percentage of GFAP expression in Astros_3 (38%) compared to Astros_2 (21%), we suspect that Astros_3 is more likely to represent reactive astrocytes 21 (Supplementary Table 6).</p>
        <p>We identified five distinct cell type clusters that fell into the oligodendrocyte lineage (OL), including two that we classified as OPCs (Fig 2e). OPCs express a characteristic set of markers such as PDGFRA and PCDH15, which decline as these cells mature into oligodendrocytes, whereas other lineage markers like, OLIG2 or SOX10, are present in both mature and immature cells. Given these developmental stage specific markers it was possible to plot a pseudotime trajectory 22 using gene expression for OPC1, OPC2, Oligos1, Oligos2 and Oligos3. Our result indicated that OPC2 were the youngest cells within the dataset followed by OPC1, then Oligos2 and Oligos3, with Oligos1 being the most mature (Fig. 2e, top). The expression of thousands of genes varied according to pseudotime (q&lt;0.01). Approximately half of the genes associated with pseudotime overlapped in cases and controls (Supplementary Fig. 6a). However, among the genes exclusively associated with pseudotime in cases, there was a 2.7-fold enrichment of apoptosis signalling in PANTHER 23 pathway analysis (FDR p&lt;9.01x10 -3 ), while no enrichment was observed in controls. Given that certain stages of oligodendrocyte differentiation are associated with heightened susceptibility to apoptosis, this may indicate differences in OL development between cases and controls 24 . To assess the individual profiles of important developmental gene markers, we plotted their expression across pseudotime (Supplementary Fig. 6b-i), revealing their expected pattern of expression.</p>
        <p>To compare our oligodendrocyte lineage (OL) cells with previously described OL cell types, we performed bioinformatic deconvolution (Fig. 2e, bottom). Our OPC2 gene expression profile was entirely represented by the "OPCs" gene expression profile from Jäkel et al. (2019) 25 . The OPC1 profile also primarily corresponded to the OPCs, but consistent with this cluster being further along the pseudotime trajectory, it showed a small correspondence to the COPs (committed oligodendrocyte precursors). Our oligodendrocyte clusters showed varying degrees of correspondence to the published data, with decreasing overlap to the published "OPCs" expression profile with increasing maturity of the cell type (ranging from 70-11% correspondence). Interestingly, among our oligodendrocytes, Oligos3 showed the highest correspondence to the ImOlGs (immune oligodendroglia), as defined by Jäkel et al 25 . The "immune gene expression" feature of Oligos3 is highlighted in our hierarchical clustering dendrogram (Fig. 1b), in which Oligos3 is located closer to the Micro/Macro cluster compared to the other OL clusters.</p>
        <p>We set out to assess gene expression differences between cases and controls within each cluster. However, one limitation of droplet based single-nucleus technology is the possibility of capturing doublet or multiplet nuclei, which we have estimated to be minimal in our case, as only 5.2% of captured nuclei were doublets or multiplets, based on a species mixing experiment (Supplementary Fig. 1g). This, however, represented a potential confounding factor when assessing differential gene expression between groups. We therefore eliminated doublets and multiplets from the dataset by calculating the correlation of each cell to the median expression value of its assigned cluster (Methods, Supplementary Fig. 7) and cells with low correlation were removed (Supplementary Table 7a-b). We also excluded any genes expressed in less than 10% of the cells in that cluster. Using only these purified clusters and filtered genes (median 5212 per cluster), we performed a differential gene expression analysis (Supplementary Tables 8-31).</p>
        <p>A total of 96 genes (FDR &lt;0.10) were differentially expressed in 16 of the 25 clusters analyzed (Fig. 3a) and 45 of those remained significant at FDR&lt;0.05 (12 of 25 clusters). FDR correction considering all clusters together yields 41 significant genes (FDR &lt; 0.10) in 16 clusters (Supplementary Table 32). This further supports that our statistical analyses are in fact able to detect differences in gene expression between the groups. To retain a larger set of genes in order to better capture functional enrichments within individual cell types, we considered all genes which passed FDR &lt; 0.10, corrected per cluster. The majority, 83% (80 genes), were downregulated in line with findings from previous transcriptomic studies in MDD 3,4 . Differential expression analysis treated each cell as a sample (Supplementary Fig. 8a-f), but per subject contributions were visualized using heatmaps of average gene expression to assess biases in subject contributions. Patterns of gene expression averaged by subject reflected the expected differences between cases and controls (Supplementary Fig. 9a-p). Thirty-nine of the 96 differentially expressed genes were found in excitatory cell clusters and, of those, 34 were downregulated (Fig. 3a, insert). Some neuronal clusters contained both upregulated and downregulated genes, but it was more common for affected neuronal clusters to contain only downregulated genes (8/12, 67%). All but one inhibitory cluster showed altered gene expression and non-neuronal clusters tended to have both up-and downregulated genes (Fig. 3b).</p>
        <p>Of particular interest, two clusters -one composed of immature oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC2) and one composed of deep layer excitatory neurons (Ex7) -accounted for almost half (47%) of the dysregulated genes (Fig. 3c). Finally, two genes were differentially expressed in more than one cluster: PRKAR1B showed decreased expression in excitatory clusters Ex7 (FDR=0.087, FC=0.87) and Ex2 (FDR=0.047, FC=0.82) and TUBB4B in excitatory clusters Ex7 (FDR=0.079, FC=0.87) and Ex6 (FDR=0.073, FC=0.86).</p>
        <p>Three of our DEGs (FADS2, CKB and KAZN) have previously been identified in GWAS of MDD 2,26 .To further compare our DEGs with previously reported findings in MDD we took advantage of publically available databases PsyGeNET 27 and DisGeNET 28 . Using PsyGeNET we found that 26 of our DEGs have previously been linked to mental illness in the literature. The highest number of associations (22/54 associations) were for depressive disorders, followed by associations for schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders (20/54; Fig. 3d). Using DisGeNET we found 15 genes associated with MDD related terms (hypergeometric test, p-value = 0.00029; Fig. 3e). Hypergeometric tests for overlap between DEGs in individual clusters and genes related to depression in DisGeNet revealed a specific enrichment in OPC2 DEGs (p=5.7x10 -4 , Fig. 3e).</p>
        <p>Interestingly, we found that 67% of these genes were contributed by the OPC2 and Ex7 clusters (Fig. 3e). Complete results from PsyGeNET and DisGeNET are presented in Supplementary Table 33-35.</p>
        <p>We used Gene Ontology and Reactome Pathway enrichment analysis to identify the relationship of our 96 DEGs to biological functions. There were strong enrichments of Gene Ontology terms for neuron projection maintenance (84-fold enrichment; FDR=0.011) and negative regulation of long-term synaptic potentiation (75-fold enrichment; FDR=0.012). Both of these terms are hierarchically related with the more general term regulation of synaptic plasticity, also enriched in the set of 96 genes (9-fold enrichment, FDR=0.012). Reactome Pathways enrichments included Kinesins (21.74-fold enrichment; FDR = 6.24x10 -4 ), HSP90 chaperone cycle for steroid hormone receptors (15.79-fold enrichment; FDR = 3.4x10 -2 ), and Innate Immune System (3.01fold enrichment, FDR=3.29x10 -2 ). A full list of all enrichment analyses performed is provided in Supplementary Table 36-41. The majority (excluding three: AC133680.1, MEG3, FAM66C) of the DEGs were protein-coding.</p>
        <p>We used STRING network analysis 29 to plot the interactions between these proteins coding DEGs. This enabled us to identify common pathways and systems, within which these proteins, contributed by different cell types, functionally interact. The overall connectivity between proteins encoded by our DEGs was significantly higher than that expected for a random subset of genes (p-value = 3.64x10 -4 ). While distinct genes were dysregulated in different clusters, common pathways and biological processes dysregulated across clusters included cytoskeletal function, immune system function, and SHR chaperone cycling (Fig. 4a), all of which have been previously implicated in MDD 9,30 .</p>
        <p>Interestingly, certain genes were present in multiple pathways and processes, for example HSP90AA1 (OPC2) links SHR chaperone cycling, immune system functioning and cytoskeletal function (Fig. 4b). Likewise, KIF16B from lower layer neurons (Ex7) and KIF26B and KLC2 in two inhibitory cells types (In2 VIP and In3 SST respectively), belong to both the kinesin pathway and cytoskeletal function (Fig. 4c). Of note, KAZN, a gene previously associated with MDD 26 , interacts with the KIF16B (Ex7), both of which represent some of the few upregulated genes in the dataset.</p>
        <p>In addition to directly measuring gene expression changes between groups, we performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). To circumvent the challenges posed by the sparsity of snRNA-seq data, we performed WGCNA on the average gene expression profile for each subject across all cell types and included the percentage contribution of different cell types as a correlate. Our results indicated that 5 modules were significantly associated with MDD (Supplementary Table 42).</p>
        <p>Four of the 5 modules were also strongly associated with Ex7, representing the highest clusterphenotype overlap. We chose to focus on the largest module (blue), which included 2699 genes and significantly overlapped with our identified DEGs (Fig. 5a, 44%, p-value = 6.04x10 -19 , hypergeometric test for overlap). To identify the most connected genes within the blue module, we performed a hub gene analysis resulting in 285 hub genes (Fig. 5b, see Methods) and plotted the top 50, which included 10 DEGs (Fig. 5c). The top term for a Gene Ontology analysis of the hub gene list was "neurotransmitter secretion" (8.69-fold enrichment, FDR=7.21 x10 -3 ), suggesting a disruption of intercellular communication between neural cells. Furthermore, we found that 26 of the 41 DEGs that overlapped with the blue module were also hub genes (pvalue = 4.95 x 10 -31 , hypergeometric test for overlap).</p>
        <p>We preformed validation of our DEGs using fluorescence-assisted nuclei sorting (FANS) to separate broad cell types followed by high-throughput qPCR. As expected, given that the FANS fractions are much broader than the single cell clusters, with the 26 clusters combined into 4 sorted populations, levels of validation varied in part as a function of the relative representation of the cluster in the sorted fraction (Supplementary Fig. 1011, Supplementary Tables 43444546).</p>
        <p>Next, in order to better understand how cells are interacting, we applied a predictive tool to explore the relationship of ligands of one cluster to the receptors expressed in another cluster.</p>
        <p>We focused our analysis on Ex7 and OPC2, the two clusters showing the most DEGs, and with the greatest overlap of genes associated with phenotype from the literature and from our WGCNA. We found a total of 90 significantly changed ligand-receptor combinations between Ex7 and OPC2 after random permutations (p&lt;0.01). Fifty-eight Ex7 ligand to OPC2 receptor (Fig. 6a left, Supplementary Table 47a) and 32 OPC2 ligand to Ex7 receptor interactions were altered between cases and controls (Fig. 6a right, Supplementary Table 47b). We found significant changes to FGF signalling originating from both cell types. Although these results are exploratory and need to be interpreted with caution, they are consistent with previous literature implicating the FGF system in MDD, and particularly, changes in FGF signalling in OPCs 31,32 leading to depressive phenotypes, and provide an intriguing avenue for future experiments.</p>
        <p>Based on the DEGs found in Ex7 and OPC2, we modeled the potential interaction indicating the class of protein and change in expression of the gene (Fig. 6b). To add support to the model we selected genes to further study with RNAScope® fluorescence in situ hybridization. Given the important change in FGF signalling we chose to investigate FIBP (FGF1 intercellular binding protein), KAZN a potential junction protein and HPS90AA1 a co-chaperone involved in stress hormone receptor cycling. We found FIBP was downregulated, as expected, in deep layer excitatory neurons (Fig. 6c, Unpaired t test, t 217 =2.5, p=0.013, n= 95 nuclei for cases and controls) while KAZN was upregulated in OPCs (Fig. 6d, Unpaired t test, t 188 =2.7, p=0.007, n=100 nuclei for controls, n=119 nuclei for cases) and HSP90AA1 was downregulated, also in OPCs (Fig. 6e, Unpaired t test, t 192 =2.0, p=0.026, n= 107 nuclei for controls, n= 87 nuclei for cases).</p>
        <p>Our examination of single-nucleus transcriptomes from the dlPFC in MDD revealed dysregulation of gene expression in almost 60% of the cell types identified, with a total of 96 differentially expressed genes. There were prominent gene expression changes in immature oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC2) and in deep layer excitatory neurons (Ex7), and a large percentage of their DEGs overlapped with genes previously implicated in MDD.</p>
        <p>Given the complexity of psychiatric disorders such as MDD, disentangling the role of each cell type in the brain is important and requires single cell resolution. For example, the ability to distinguish glial subtypes -including multiple astrocytic, oligodendrocytic, and OPC clustersenabled us to pinpoint changes specific to OPCs, but not oligodendrocytes, and changes selective to only one subset of astrocytic cells.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the target cell types in MDD pathophysiology have expanded from excitatory neurons to include inhibitory interneurons 18 and non-neuronal cells [4][5][6][7][8][9] . Here we found 16 unique cell types showing evidence of differential gene expression in depression, including 4 nonneuronal clusters and 6 clusters of interneurons supporting the complex interplay between multiple cell types in MDD. Previous studies have shown that SST and PVALB interneurons are dysregulated in MDD patients 18 , and here we report several DEGs in 3 interneuron clusters that are defined by the expression of these GABAergic markers (Inhib_3_SST, Inhib_6_SST, and Inhib_8_PVALB). Interestingly, a separate cluster of PVALB interneurons (Inhib_7_PVALB) did not show differential expression, which may indicate that not all PVALB interneurons are equally affected. However, we find differentially expressed genes in non-SST, non-PVALB interneuron clusters (Inhib_2_VIP, Inhib_1, and Inhib_5), which suggests that additional interneuron subtypes could have a role in depression, and should be examined in future research.</p>
        <p>We found 10 different excitatory cell types which were annotated to specific cortical layers based on known markers. Ex10 represented a large cluster of superficial cortical layer cells, whereas there were numerous clusters representing different excitatory cell types from deeper cortical layers. The neuronal cluster with the most change was Ex7, a deep layer cluster characterized primarily by DPP10 expression. DPP10 encodes a dipeptidyl peptidase-related protein that regulates neuronal excitability and has previously been associated with a human-specific, neuron-based regulatory network. Structural variants of this gene have been implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases, including autism, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder 33 .</p>
        <p>OPC2 also showed extensive gene expression changes between cases and controls. OPC2 was the youngest cell type in the OL pseudotime trajectory. The use of cellular deconvolution techniques indicated that OPC1 have some similarity to committed OPCs whereas OPC2 showed no such correspondence, supporting the idea of functional heterogeneity among OPCs 34 .</p>
        <p>Furthermore, compared to OPC1, OPC2 expressed higher levels of certain glutamate and sodium receptors, which are typically lost as the cells mature 34 .</p>
        <p>Evidence suggests that half of the OPCs (NG2 + ) in the brain do not give rise to any other cell type 35 , and exhibit synaptic contact with neurons 36 . As such, OPCs are now thought to be a distinct glial cell type implicated in brain plasticity through roles such as integration of synaptic activity 37 and mediation of long term potentiation 38 . Additionally, there is evidence directly implicating the loss of this cell type with emergence of depressive-like behaviour 31 . The data from this study support a role for OPCS in MDD independent from their role as precursor cells for oligodendrocytes. STRING DB protein network analysis highlighted a number of links including connections between three differentially expressed genes encoding kinesin-related proteins: KIF26B, KLC2 and KIF16B. KIF16B (increased in Ex7) is involved in recycling receptors including the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR). Interestingly, FIBP, encoding acidic FGF1 intracellular-binding protein, was decreased in Ex7. FGFR transport relies, in part, on the interaction between kinesins and Rab GTPases 39 . Notably, we found RAB11B (encoding a Rab GTPase) and KLC2 to be downregulated in In3. Taken together, these finding could point to a disruption of FGFR recycling by kinesins and Rab GTPases, as well as disrupted modulation FGF intercellular signalling by FIBP in neurons in MDD.</p>
        <p>Based on animal models and in cell culture, FGFs (specifically FGF2) and FGFRs seem to be affected by stress and the glucocorticoids 40 . The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) has consistently been implicated in MDD 41 . HSP90AA1 (decreased in OPC2) and FKBP4 (decreased in Ex7), along with its homolog FKPB5, encode cochaperones for the GR and regulate intracellular signalling functions of this receptor 30 . HSP90AA1 codes for the stress inducible isoform HSP90α and interestingly, is known to be secreted in certain stress contexts 42 . These changes may point to a fundamental disruption in GR signaling in deep layer excitatory cells and OPCs, which could further interact with the above described changes in FGF signalling.</p>
        <p>The genes related to chaperone mediated steroid hormone receptor cycling overlapped with genes involved in innate immune function. This is unsurprising given the role of glucocorticoids in modulating inflammation, one of the primary responses of the immune system. Both OPC2 and Ex7 were enriched for the common genes between these pathways. Finally both the FGF and GR system have implications in the plastic properties of excitatory neurons such as projection outgrowth and stability 43,44 .</p>
        <p>Additionally, genes such as PRNP (the prion protein gene) and KAZN (a gene involved in desmosome assembly), were strongly altered in the OPC2 cluster and are associated with mediating synaptic plasticity and cellular communication 45,46 . The absence of Prnp has been associated with an increased number of undifferentiated oligodendrocytes and the delayed expression of differentiation markers 47 . which is intriguing given the evidence implicating a lack of mature adult oligodendrocytes in animal models of depression and anxiety 48 . On the other hand, overexpression of kazrin in keratinocytes profoundly changed cell shape, reduced filamentous actin, and impaired assembly of intercellular junctions 46 . Interestingly, decreased desmosome length has been described in Prnp -/-mice 49 suggesting an interplay between these proteins. Further, a SNP in KAZN showed one of the strongest associations in individuals with treatment resistant depression 26 .</p>
        <p>Based on the information we derived from various bioinformatics strategies we have proposed a putative model for the bidirectional interactions between lower layer excitatory neurons and immature oligodendrocytes. We used RNAScope® to validate some of the key transcriptional changes highlighted by the model. Though these results are interesting, functional follow up studies will be required to determine the role of molecules like FGF, HSP90α and Kazrin in the communication between these two cell types.</p>
        <p>Our study is not without limitations. All individuals included in our study were male, so our results are not necessarily generalizable to women, particularly as previous studies have suggested that brain transcriptomic changes associated with MDD are different in females 50 .</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, this first screen provides important information that may help inform subsequent studies exploring both men and women with MDD. Technical limitations with droplet-based snRNA-seq of human brain have been previously described. We, like others 10,11 , found a much greater proportion of neurons compared to glial cells than would be expected based on histologically determined estimates, pointing to a potential limitation of the methodology for capturing non-neuronal cells. Although droplet-based snRNA-seq does not capture lowly expressed genes, nevertheless, we were able to perform differential gene expression for thousands of genes in precisely defined cell types.</p>
        <p>Lastly, we believe the consistency across dissections was not sufficient for estimating cell type proportions. For example, even a small over-representation of one cortical layer versus another during dissection, can give misleading results regarding the proportion of cell-types. Other groups have attempted to extract nuclei from cryo-sectioned samples to address these inconsistencies 10 .</p>
        <p>Our study has elucidated gene expression changes specific to numerous independent cell types in MDD. We have identified a potentially important link between OPCs and deep layer excitatory neurons, which implicates fundamental pathways including FGF signalling, glucocorticoid receptor regulation and synaptic plasticity in the brains of depressed individuals. The generalizability of these data will rely on independent validation in other MDD cohorts; nonetheless, this work provides an exciting start point for understanding the complex interplay of cells in the brain and a platform for future functional research to assess these potential interactions. Future single-cell studies of MDD should aim to relate cell types with symptomology and severity as has been done in recent papers 16,17 .</p>

The present study used the services of the Molecular and Cellular Microscopy Platform (MCMP) at the Douglas Institute. and showed an enrichment for MDD (Total, all the genes which overlap database for a given disorder; 100% association, the genes positively associated with the disease; 100% no association, the genes negatively associated with the disease; both, mixed findings (positive and negative) for a given gene related to the disease. e) (Left) 15 genes were found to be associated Tables Table 1:</p>

The sample was passed through a 30 μm cell strainer and spun for 5 min at 500 g. This step was repeated for a total of two filtering steps. After pelleting, the nuclei are resuspended in 5-10 mL of wash buffer by pipetting up and down 8-10 times. After 3 washes, the nuclei were resuspended in 1 mL of wash buffer and mixed with 25 % Optiprep™ and layered on a 29 % Optiprep™ cushion and spun for 30 min at 10,000 g. Nuclei were resuspended in wash buffer to achieve a concentration of ~1x10 6 nuclei/mL. Representative images of extracted nuclei are presented in Supplementary Fig. 12.</p>
        <p>We used the 10x Genomics® Chromium™ controller for single cell gene expression to isolate single nuclei for downstream bulk RNA library preparation. We strictly followed the protocol as outlined by the user guide (CG00052_SingleCell3_ReagentKitv2UserGuide_RevE.pdf), with the exception of loading concentration, which we increase by 30% as we assessed the capture of nuclei to be slightly less efficient than cell encapsulation. We aimed to capture ~3000 nuclei per sample. So, for example, if our sample concentration was 390 nuclei/μL (~ 400 nuclei/ μL) according to page 10 of Protocol Step 1 we are required to load 13.1 μL of the stock to capture 3000 cells. But instead, we would recalculate our stock concentration to be 70% of 390 = 273 nuclei/ μL and load 17.4 μL (the recommended amount for 300 nuclei/ μL) instead. This system only allows for a maximum of 8 samples per capture run. As such, we required multiple batches to collect the individual nuclei for all 34 samples (6 batches). Samples 24 and 25 performed poorly, we therefore, carried out the capture on two separate chips and sequenced twice combining the data from both runs for the final analysis.</p>
        <p>A pre-mRNA transcriptome was built using the cellranger mkref (
            <rs type="software">Cellranger</rs> version 
            <rs type="version">2.0.1</rs>) command and default parameters starting with the refdata-cellranger-GRCh38-1.2.0 transcriptome and as per the instructions provided on the 10X Genomics website. Reads were demultiplexed by sample index using the cellranger mkfastq command (
            <rs type="software">Cellranger</rs> v
            <rs type="version">2.1.0</rs>). Fastq files were aligned to the custom transcriptome, cell barcodes were demultiplexed, and UMIs corresponding to genes were counted using the cellranger count command and default parameters.
        </p>
        <p>The unfiltered gene barcode matrices for each sample were loaded into 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> using the Read10X function in the 
            <rs type="software">Seurat</rs>
            <rs type="software">R</rs> package (version 
            <rs type="version">2.2.0</rs>, 2
            <rs type="version">.3.0</rs>) 19 . Cell names were modified such that the subject name, batch, and biological condition were added to them. Seurat objects were created corresponding to each sample using the CreateSeuratObject function with the imported unfiltered gene-barcode matrices provided as the raw data. Individual Seurat objects for each sample were combined into one object using the MergeSeurat function sequentially. No filtering or normalization was performed up to this step. Since this is a single nucleus dataset, all mitochondrial genes that are transcribed from the mitochondrial genome were removed, along with genes not detected in any cell.
        </p>
        <p>Based on the distribution of nGene (total number of genes detected in each cell) for the total dataset (assessed by summary and hist R 52 functions), barcodes that were associated with less than 110 detected genes were removed. Based on the distribution of nUMI (total numbers of UMIs detected in each cell), the top 0.5 % of barcodes were also excluded as most likely being multiplets rather than single nuclei, as there was a very sharp increase of nUMI from 16,393 at the 99.5 th percentile to 102,583 at the maximum.</p>
        <p>Next, the distribution of nUMI for the remaining barcodes was fit with three normal distributions using the normalmixEM function from the 
            <rs type="software">mixtools</rs> 53 package (Supplementary Fig. 1c). The rationale was that, the filtered barcodes contain a population of low quality "noise" barcodes that have a very low nUMI on average, a population of non-neuronal cells that have an intermediate nUMI and a population of neuronal cells that have a high nUMI. Based on the fitting of the normal distributions, only the barcodes with a high probability (&gt; 0.95) of belonging to either the putative "non-neuronal" or putative "neuronal" distributions, and a low probability (&lt;0.05) of belonging to the "noise" distribution were retained for further analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1c-d). 78,886 cells and 30,062 genes were retained.
        </p>
        <p>Our custom filtering (Supplementary Fig. 1a-e, Supplementary Table 4) helped to increase the number of glial cells recovered. With an initial subset of 20 subjects, applying our custom filtering increased the total number of cells 1.8-fold but increased the number of non-neuronal cells by almost 6-fold (data not shown). After custom filtering the minimum numbers of genes and UMIs per nucleus were 254 and 340 respectively.</p>
        <p>Once nuclei were filtered, the percentages of mitochondrial reads associated with the retained barcodes were calculated although for quality control purposes those reads were not used during the filtering or downstream analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1f). Although the percentage of reads mapping to mitochondrially expressed genes is a more pertinent quality control parameter for single-cell rather than single nucleus approaches, contaminating mitochondrial reads often present a problem in single-nucleus protocols (pers. comm., Lake, B.B.). However, our optimized approach was able to minimize this technical issue.</p>
        <p>settings usually correspond to known biological cell types, some clusters may appear to potentially identify entirely new cell types or splinter existing cell types into multiple subtypes.</p>
        <p>Deciding if the clusters really do identify new cell types can be difficult or may even be impossible from available data.</p>
        <p>To address this issue, we used tools in the 
            <rs type="software">Seurat</rs> package to sequentially combine any clusters that were not sufficiently distinct from each other. In particular, after performing initial hierarchical clustering of the graph-based clusters (
            <rs type="software">BuildClusterTree</rs>), we assessed the nodes of the dendrogram using a random forest classifier (
            <rs type="software">AssessNodes</rs>) and then merged together any nodes which were in the bottom 25 % of the dendrogram (using the branching.times function from the 
            <rs type="software">ape</rs>
            <rs type="software">R</rs> package 54 ) and had an out-of-bag-error of more than 5 %. We then repeated this clustering and merging process for the nuclei within each terminal node until none of the remaining nodes fulfilled our cut-off criteria (Supplementary Fig. 2b). The resulting set of 30 clusters were then characterized in terms of known markers genes of all major, well-defined brain cell types (Supplementary Fig. 2c-d). For refining identification of excitatory neuron types, we combined and re-clustered a set of excitatory clusters with highly correlated gene expression profiles (R &gt; 0.95) (Supplementary Fig. 13a-c) using similar parameters for clustering as the whole dataset. This included 7 clusters of ~40,000 cells. Reclustering yielded 33 final clusters for downstream analysis. Finally, the clusters were manually curated to eliminate potential biases;
        </p>
        <p>for example, clusters were removed if mainly one sample contributed to the cells contained within the cluster (Supplementary Tables 48495051, Supplementary Fig. 14a-e).</p>
        <p>Genes used as markers for major cell-types and layer-specificity are listed below. Inhibitory neuron subtypes were annotated based on expression of canonical inhibitory interneuron markers SST, PVALB, and VIP where possible. Excitatory neuron subtypes were annotated with some level of layer specificity based on expression of layer specific markers 11,55,56 . We also characterised clusters in terms of all genes differentially expressed between clusters (FindAllMarkers function, bimodal test, logfc.threshold of log (2), other parameters set to default) (Supplementary Table 6).</p>
        <p>Major cell-type markers (Supplementary Fig. 3a-p)</p>
        <p>For oligodendrocyte developmental trajectory assessment, the data for cells belonging to the five clusters in the oligodendrocyte lineage (Oligos_1, Oligos_2, Oligos_3, OPCs_1, OPCs_2) were used to create a separate Seurat object using the SubsetData function. The most variable genes for these clusters alone were identified using the FindVariableGenes function and the following parameters: x.low.cutoff = 0.003, x.high.cutoff = 3, y.cutoff = 1 (giving a total of 895). The Seurat object was imported into a CDS (CellDataSet) object using the Monocle 22 function importCDS.</p>
        <p>Estimation of size factors and dispersions was performed (using the estimateSizeFactors and estimateDispersions Monocle functions) on the CDS object using default parameters.</p>
        <p>Dimensionality reduction was then performed using reduceDimension, with reduction_method set to DDRTree. The 895 variable genes identified as above were used for ordering the cells into a trajectory with the orderCells function. The pseudotime trajectory was then plotted with plot_cell_trajectory (Fig. 2e), and the change in expression of genes known to be involved in oligodendrocyte development were plotted using plot_genes_in_pseudotime (Supplementary Fig. 6b-i). 
            <rs type="software">differentialGeneTest</rs> was applied separately to oligodendrocyte lineage cells from control subjects and MDD cases with fullModelFormulaStr = "~sm.ns(Pseudotime)". This allows us to model the expression of each gene as a function of pseudotime. All genes detected in at least one cell in the respective group were compared and their changes across pseudotime were assessed. A q-value cut-off of &lt; 0.01 was used to identify genes associated with pseudotime. The overlapping and non-overlapping genes were identified by comparing the lists obtained for the two groups (Supplementary Fig. 6a).
        </p>
        <p>Our doublet removal approach comprised of calculating a median gene expression profile for all our clusters, calculating the correlation of the gene expression of each cell, with the median profile of its cluster (considering only the top 865 genes whose median expression was highly variable, that is had a variance of &gt; 0.25 across the different cluster) and selecting cells with high correlation. This was done by fitting bimodal normal distributions to the total distribution of correlations in the cluster to identify low and high correlation peaks. Cells were retained only if they had a low probability of falling in the low correlation peak (p &lt; 0.25) and a high probability (p &gt; 0.75) of falling in the high correlation peaks (Supplementary Fig. 7).</p>
        <p>Differential expression analysis between the cases and controls was performed using linear mixed models implemented in the 
            <rs type="software">lme4</rs> 57 and 
            <rs type="software">lmerTest</rs> 58 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> packages. Mixed models were necessary in order to account for dependencies between nuclei obtained from the same subject.
        </p>
        <p>Biological condition and number of UMIs were included in models as fixed effects and the subject and batch as random effects. The inclusion of subject as a random effect should account for subject specific effects such as age and PMI as well as technical effects of capture and library preparation which was performed separately for each subject. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1 was used to detect differentially expressed genes within each cell type.</p>
        <p>Average cell-expression for each sample across every cluster was calculated. These average counts were converted to log + 1 counts to reduce dispersion. WGCNA analysis was carried out in 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> with the 
            <rs type="software">WGCNA</rs> package (version 
            <rs type="version">1.68</rs>) by Langfelder and Horvath. Genes with insufficient variance were excluded as well as outlier samples. After some tests, a soft-thresholding power of 7 and a minimum module size of 30 genes were selected for the gene network construction.
        </p>
        <p>Resulting modules were correlated with the phenotype information (MDD vs Control), as well as each sample's respective composition of each of the 26 single-cell type clusters they're composed of.</p>
        <p>We performed hub gene analysis on the blue module, which was the largest module (2699 genes) which was correlated to phenotype. Potential hub genes were identified in the module of interest my selecting genes with a module membership larger than 0.80 and a gene significance larger than 0.20 with a p-value of less than 0.05. The top 50 potential hub genes were extracted alongside any weighted interaction of more than 0.2. The resulting network was visualized in 
            <rs type="software">Cytoscape</rs> (
            <rs type="version">3.7.1</rs>).
        </p>
        <p>Nuclear suspensions were prepared from 80-100 mg of post-mortem brain tissue from BA9 as described previously 59</p>
        <p>RNA was extracted from FANS sorted nuclei population using the Norgen RNA/DNA Purification Kit (Cat. 48700). cDNA was synthesized using a modified SMART-seq procedure as described previously 60 . The Fluidigm Biomark system was used for performing high-throughput qPCR as per manufacturer protocol as previously described 61 . Fludigim Delta Gene™ primer designs were used for the 93 targets (all differentially expressed transcripts excluding AC133680.1) and 3 endogenous controls (GAPDH, POLR2A, UBC).</p>
        <p>To assess cell-cell communication, we calculated predicted ligand-receptor interactions between Ex7 and OPC2 using 
            <rs type="software">CCInx 62</rs> (
            <rs type="url">https://github.com/BaderLab/CCInx)</rs>, in which the connection between each ligand and receptor is quantified as an edge weight. We chose a gene expression threshold of 2.75 and above to limit our research to relatively highly expressed ligands and receptors and for ease of visualization. To test if the edge weights were significantly different between cases and controls, we randomly permuted our subjects into two groups 100 times and formed normal distributions of the edge weight differences between groups for each ligandreceptor pair. We then calculated a p-value for the case-control edge weight difference for each ligand-receptor pair based on its position in the distribution. Edge weight difference p-values &lt;0.01 were considered significant. A sample 
            <rs type="software">script</rs> used for assessing the significance of edges has been provided.
        </p>
        <p>Expression data from (dbGaP:phs000424.v8.p1) 11 was used as reference signatures for annotated cell types. UMI counts for each cell were converted to transcripts per million (TPMs) in order to account for the varying sequencing depth of each cell and sample. Average expression levels were calculated for each cell type-specific cluster defined in the paper.</p>
        <p>Cluster-specific gene expression profiles were obtained by summing the UMI values of all 24301 genes common to our dataset and the reference for each nucleus in each cluster and converting the sums to TPMs. 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> package, 
            <rs type="software">DeconRNASeq</rs> v
            <rs type="version">1.18.0</rs> 63 was used to deconvolute these clusterspecific profiles. Using the data from 11 as reference, we were able to estimate the cell type composition of our clusters.
        </p>
        <p>Average expression from every control samples from the Jäkel et al. dataset were calculated and used as cell signatures for the deconvolution of our oligodendrocytic clusters (average cell gene expression profiles was performed in an unbiased blinded manner. Cluster annotations were assigned after generation of clusters.</p>
        <p>Clusters were excluded from downstream analysis if they did not show even contribution from subjects as these clusters are likely to reflect sample specific artifacts rather than biological variability of interest. Single-nuclei were excluded from cell-type clusters based on their level of correlation to the median expression profile of the cluster (lowly correlated nuclei were removed) as detailed above to ensure that differential gene expression analysis was performed using similar nuclei populations from cases and controls. The exclusion criteria were not preestablished and were chosen based on preliminary analysis of the data.</p>
        <p>Differential expression analysis between the cases and controls in the snRNA-seq data was performed using linear mixed models implemented in the 
            <rs type="software">lme4</rs> 57 and 
            <rs type="software">lmerTest</rs> 58 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> packages with biological condition and number of UMIs as fixed effects, the subject and batch as random effects, and a false discovery rate of 0.1 for significance. All DEGs from this analysis were also significantly differentially expressed between cases and controls when re-tested using twotailed Wilcoxon tests (Supplementary Table 52). For analysis of RNAScope results, two-tailed ttests were performed with a significance threshold of p &lt; 0.05 and data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested. For analysis of high-throughput qPCR data two-tailed t-tests or two-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum (i.e. Mann Whitney U tests) were performed, both at a significance threshold of p &lt;0.05, and depending on data normality as measured by the Shapiro Wilk's test. The results in Supplementary Tables 43-46 are for genes reliably detected in &gt; 9 subjects per group.

        <p>This study was approved by the Douglas Hospital Research Ethics Board, and written informed consent from next-of-kin was obtained for each subject. Postmortem brain samples were provided by the Douglas-Bell Canada Brain Bank (www.douglasbrainbank.ca). Frozen grey matter samples were dissected from Brodmann Area 9 (dlPFC). Brains were dissected by trained neuroanatomists and stored at -80 C. For each individual, the cause of death was determined by the Quebec Coroner's office, and psychological autopsies were performed by proxy-based interviews, as described previously 51 . Cases met criteria for MDD and died by suicide whereas controls were individuals who died suddenly and did not have evidence of any axis I disorders (Table 1). Post mortem interval (PMI) represents the delay between a subject's death and collection and processing of the brain. To assess RNA quality, we measured the RIN obtained for our samples using tissue homogenates. An unpaired, two-tailed, Student's t-test revealed no significant difference (p=0.15) in RIN between cases (mean RIN of 6.74) and controls (mean RIN of 6.16). 17 cases and 17 controls were included in the snRNA-seq experiment and the full cohort of subjects (except 25) was used for follow-up validation of DEGs by FANS and high throughput qPCR. RNAScope experiments were performed on representative subsets of samples using 5 cases and 5 matched controls. Detailed information on experimental design and reagents can also be found in the Life Sciences Reporting Summary.</p>
        <p>50 mg of frozen tissue was dounced in 3 mL of lysis buffer, 10 times with a loose pestle and an additional 5 times with the tight pestle. The lysis buffer contained 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl 2 , and 0.05% (v/v) NP-40 detergent. The sample was left to lyse in a total of 5</p>
        <p>The UMI counts were normalized to 10,000 counts per cell and converted to log scale (Seurat function NormalizeData). The batch, condition, and subject information was added as metadata to the final Seurat object; nUMI and batch were regressed out using the ScaleData function. The Seurat FindVariableGenes function was used with default selections and cut-offs as follows:</p>
        <p>x.low.cutoff = 0.003, x.high.cutoff = 2, y.cutoff = 1. This resulted in a list of 2135 highly variable genes, which excludes lowly expressed genes (below 25 th percentile), very highly expressed genes, and selects only the top 10 % of genes in terms of the scaled dispersion. These highly variable genes were used to calculate 100 principal components. Based on the PC elbow plot of the standard deviation of the PCs (Supplementary Fig. 2a), the first 50 PCs were retained for use in downstream analysis.</p>
        <p>The FindClusters function was applied with a resolution of 2.5 and produced 44 initial clusters.</p>
        <p>The goal of clustering is to sort nuclei by cell type so that all remaining gene expression variation within clusters is not related to cell differentiation processes. Prior to the advent of single nuclei expression profiling, cell types were identified by observing differences in cell morphology, behaviour, and anatomic location. It is fairly straight-forward to sort single nuclei expression profiles into known cell types according to the expression levels of marker genes that differentiate between these cell types. However, it is very unlikely that all cell types have been identified so we must rely on nuclei clustering to uncover as-yet unknown cell types.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the number of clusters obtained from the clustering algorithm is somewhat arbitrary because clustering depends on the settings of several parameters, and there is no consensus on how they should be set. Although clusters obtained using reasonable default expression of every cell in the cluster considered as bulk) using the 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> package 
            <rs type="software">DeconRNASeq</rs> (v 
            <rs type="version">1.26.0</rs>).
        </p>
        <p>Frozen BA9 blocks were cut serially with a cryostat (10µm thickness) on superfrost charged slides and kept at -80 o C until further processed. In situ hybridization was performed using Advanced Cell Diagnostics RNAscope® probes and reagents according to the manufacturer instructions in 5 matched subjects per group. Briefly, sections were first fixed in chilled 10% neutral buffered formalin for 15 mins at 4 o C, dehydrated by increasing gradient of ethanol bathes and left to air dry for 5 minutes. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with hydrogen peroxide reagent for 10 minutes, followed by protease digestion for 30 minutes at room temperature. The following sets of probes were then hybridized for 2 hours at 40 o C in a humidity-controlled oven (HybEZ II, ACDbio): Hs-RXFP1 (cat. no. 422821), Hs-FIBP (cat. no.</p>
        <p>) and Hs-SLC17A7 (cat. no. 415611-C3) to quantify FIBP expression in excitatory (SLC17A7+) layer 5-6 (RXFP1+) neurons; KAZN (cat. no. 569791) and PDGFRA (cat. no. 604481-C3), and HSP90AA1 (cat. no. 477061) to quantify KAZN expression in OPCs (PDGFRA+). Successive addition of amplifiers was performed using the proprietary AMP reagents, and the signal visualized through probe-specific HRP-based detection by tyramide signal amplification with Opal dyes (Opal 520, Opal 570 and Opal 690; Perkin Elmer) diluted 1:300. Slides were then coverslipped with Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI for nuclear staining (Vector Laboratories) and kept at 4 o C until imaging.</p>
        <p>Image acquisitions was performed on a FV1200 laser scanning confocal microscope (FV1200) equipped with a motorized stage. For each experiment and subject, around 10 stack images were taken to capture at least 20 cells of interest per subject: excitatory neurons (SLC17A7+) from cortical layers 5-6 (RXFP1+), and OPCs (PDGFRA+). Images were taken using a x60 objective (NA = 1.42) with a XY pixel width of 0.3µm and Z spacing of 0.4µm. Laser power and detection parameters were kept consistent between subjects for each set of experiment. Because TSA amplification with Opal dyes yields a signal to noise ratio, parameters were set so that autofluorescence from lipofuscin and cellular debris was filtered out of the image. Positivity for cell defining markers was determined by bright clustered puncta-like signal present within the nucleus and cytoplasm of the cells. Expression of genes of interest was quantified using the "Analyze Particles" function in 
            <rs type="software">Fiji</rs>
            <rs type="version">64</rs> . Stacks were first converted to Z-projections, and for each image cell nuclei of cells of interests were manually contoured based on DAPI expression. Single labeled molecules of RNA were automatically counted in each channel using the find maxima function with a noise tolerance of 350 for FIBP and RXFP1, and 400 for KAZN and PDGFRA.
        </p>
        <p>Normalized FIBP and KAZN expression per cell was calculated by dividing FIBP and KAZN raw counts to RXFP1 and PDGFRA raw counts respectively. HSP90AA1 expression was quantified by manually thresholding the signal per image and measuring the percentage of area of the nucleus covered by the resulting mask.</p>
        <p>No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Sample size was determined based on sample sizes used in previous similar studies. Subjects were assigned to groups based on diagnosis and not by random assignment. All subjects were male, and groups were matched for age (18-87 years), post-mortem interval (12-93 hours), and brain pH (6-7.01). Clinicians were blinded for final psychiatry autopsy diagnosis of MDD case or control.
