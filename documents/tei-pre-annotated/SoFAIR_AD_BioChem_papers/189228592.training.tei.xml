        <p>Extracellular vesicles are cell-derived membrane particles ranging from 30 to 5,000 nm in size, including exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies. They are released under physiological conditions, but also upon cellular activation, senescence, and apoptosis. They play an important role in intercellular communication. Their release may also maintain cellular integrity by ridding the cell of damaging substances. This review describes the biogenesis, uptake, and detection of extracellular vesicles in addition to the impact that they have on recipient cells, focusing on mechanisms important in the pathophysiology of kidney diseases, such as thrombosis, angiogenesis, tissue regeneration, immune modulation, and inflammation. In kidney diseases, extracellular vesicles may be utilized as biomarkers, as they are detected in both blood and urine. Furthermore, they may contribute to the pathophysiology of renal disease while also having beneficial effects associated with tissue repair. Because of their role in the promotion of thrombosis, inflammation, and immune-mediated disease, they could be the target of drug therapy, whereas their favorable effects could be utilized therapeutically in acute and chronic kidney injury.Extracellular vesicles are cell-derived membrane particles ranging from 30 to 5,000 nm in size, including exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies.

        <p>Intercellular communication is essential for multicellular organisms and cells communicate by a variety of mechanisms such as direct cell-cell contact, transfer of secreted molecules or intercellular transfer of extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are membrane-bound vesicles released by cells under physiological and pathological conditions. As EVs circulate in the blood, they may act as shuttle vectors or signal transducers both locally and at a distance from their site of origin [1]. Another function of EVs is the removal of unwanted molecular material or cellular waste [2], conceivably as a means of maintaining cellular integrity.Intercellular communication is essential for multicellular organisms and cells communicate by a variety of mechanisms such as direct cell-cell contact, transfer of secreted molecules or intercellular transfer of extracellular vesicles (EVs).

        <p>Extracellular vesicles are subdivided into exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies (Table 1). Exosomes are the smallest vesicles (30-100 nm) released by the fusion of multivesicular bodies containing intraluminal vesicles with the plasma membrane. Microvesicles are vesicular structures (0.1-1.0 μm) shed by outward blebbing of the plasma membrane. The largest EVs (1-5 μm) are apoptotic bodies that are formed during the late stages of apoptosis [5,10]. These subtypes of extracellular vesicles differ in their mechanism of biogenesis, as described below. This review focuses mainly on exosomes and microvesicles. Certain studies have not specifically analyzed the subtype of vesicle, in which case we refer to the general term EVs.Extracellular vesicles are subdivided into exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies (Table 1).

        <p>Although microvesicles and exosomes are structurally similar, they differ in size, lipid composition, content, and cellular origin (Table 1). EVs may be shed, under physiological or pathological conditions, into the extracellular environment either constitutively or upon activation, hypoxia, oxidative stress, senescence or apoptosis [4]. The release of vesicles may be induced by the stimulation of purinergic receptors [11], by shear stress or apoptosis [12,13] and by proinflammatory mediators [14] or thrombin [15]. In addition, bacterial virulence factors, such as Shiga toxin and lipopolysaccharides [16] and uremic toxins [17] induce the release of EVs.Although microvesicles and exosomes are structurally similar, they differ in size, lipid composition, content, and cellular origin (Table 1).

        <p>Microvesicles carry membrane-derived receptors, proteins, including cytokines, chemokines, proteins involved in cellular signaling and/or migration, lipids, carbohydrates, and genetic material including mRNA and microRNAs (miRNAs) [4]. Their contents depend on the parent cell, the microenvironment and on the triggers preceding their release [5,[18][19][20][21]. The transfer of these substances to recipient cells may affect the phenotype of the target cell. EVs transport combinations of multiple mediators and are therefore considered a more powerful means of intercellular communication than the transfer of single molecules. Circulating microvesicles are mainly of platelet, erythrocyte, leukocyte, and endothelial origin [22][23][24][25]. Urinary microvesicles originate mainly from podocytes, tubular cells, and epithelial cells lining the urogenital tract [2].Microvesicles carry membrane-derived receptors, proteins, including cytokines, chemokines, proteins involved in cellular signaling and/or migration, lipids, carbohydrates, and genetic material including mRNA and microRNAs (miRNAs) [4].

        <p>Exosomes are the product of the fusion of a subset of late endosomes, called multivesicular bodies, with the plasma membrane releasing their contents including intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). Once extracellular, these vesicles are termed exosomes (Fig. 1) [3]. ILV formation is regulated via the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT, four protein complexes that guide intracellular cargo) [26], and/or by non-ESCRT-related mechanisms, including tetraspanins [27] and membrane lipids [28].Exosomes are the product of the fusion of a subset of late endosomes, called multivesicular bodies, with the plasma membrane releasing their contents including intraluminal vesicles (ILVs).

        <p>Microvesicles are released from cells under physiological conditions, especially during cell growth [29]. Microvesicle shedding is increased when the cells are activated owing to cell injury, proinflammatory stimulants, hypoxia, oxidative stress or shear stress [30,31]. Microvesicles are formed by outward protrusion or budding of the plasma membrane. This process is initiated by an increase in intracellular cytosolic calcium that activates calpain, a calcium-sensitive protease that detaches membrane proteins from the intracellular cytoskeleton [32], and gelsolin bound to actin filaments [33]. This leads to remodeling of the cytoskeleton, by cleaving the actin protein network, enabling blebbing to occur. Microvesicles are shed from plasma membrane micro-domains known as lipid rafts or caveolae domains [34]. The plasma membrane is composed of a lipid bilayer in which phosphatidylserine is located in the inner leaflet of the resting cell. The enzymes flippase, floppase, and scramblase control phospholipid asymmetry [35]. When the cell is activated, increased cytosolic calcium activates floppase (allowing lipid movement to the outer membrane) and scramblase (enabling bi-directional lipid movement), whereas flippase (allowing lipid movement to the inner membrane) is inactivated, resulting in flopping of negatively charged phosphatidylserine to the outer leaflet of the phospholipid bilayer [20]. This process does not always occur, as some microvesicles do not expose phosphatidylserine on their outer leaflet (Fig. 1) [36]. The presence of phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet is readily detected, as it binds annexin V.Microvesicles are released from cells under physiological conditions, especially during cell growth [29].

        <p>Microvesicles may express a slightly different repertoire of surface receptors or cytoplasmic components compared with the parent cell owing to a selective process during shedding [34]. Similarly, microvesicles released from activated cells do not express the same surface receptors as microvesicles shed during apoptosis [19] or from resting cells. This was demonstrated in vasculitis patients, microvesicles in patient samples taken during the active phase exhibited more CD62E and CD62P than those taken during remission and control samples [37].Microvesicles may express a slightly different repertoire of surface receptors or cytoplasmic components compared with the parent cell owing to a selective process during shedding [34].

        <p>The quantity of EVs in the circulation reflects a balance between their generation and clearance. Microvesicles released into the circulation have a half-life of a couple of minutes to a few hours [38], during which they may be taken up by neighboring or distant cells. In humans undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, transfusion or dobutamine-induced cardiac stress, elevated levels of circulating microvesicles were detected, but these returned to baseline levels within 15 min to ~6 h [39,40]. Interestingly, clearance of microvesicles may depend on the cellular origin of the microvesicles as platelet-derived microvesicles were cleared sooner than microvesicles released from red blood cells [40].The quantity of EVs in the circulation reflects a balance between their generation and clearance.

        <p>There are various mechanisms for the cellular uptake of vesicles depending on the cargo of the vesicle, intercellular communication (e.g. receptor-ligand interactions) and the microenvironment of the cell. The most common mechanism is endocytosis, whereby the extracellular vesicle is engulfed by the recipient cell [38]. There are several mechanisms of endocytosis, such as clathrin-dependent or -independent, caveolinmediated, macropinocytosis, phagocytosis and lipid raftmediated [41]. Uptake of EVs seems to depend on the type of recipient cell, its physiological state, and recognition of ligands or receptors on the recipient cell and EVs [41]. For example, vesicles shed from platelets interact with monocytes [42] and endothelial cells [22], but not with neutrophils [42]. Likewise, exosomes exposing the tetraspanin-integrin complex were selectively taken up by endothelial and pancreatic cells [43].There are various mechanisms for the cellular uptake of vesicles depending on the cargo of the vesicle, intercellular communication (e.g. receptor-ligand interactions) and the microenvironment of the cell.

        <p>Another mechanism for microvesicle uptake is fusion, whereby the microvesicles fuse with the membranes of the recipient cell and the content of the vesicle is released into 1). b Microvesicles are shed directly from the plasma membrane, thereby carrying membrane markers of the parent cell. Microvesicle formation is calcium-dependent and associated with loss of membrane asymmetry and disruption of the cellular cytoskeleton. c Extracellular vesicle uptake by target cells may occur via fusion of the vesicle membrane with the cell membrane or by endocytosis. The vesicle may also transduce an intracellular signal by ligand binding to a receptor on the recipient cell the cell. Platelets expressing P-selectin fuse with tissue-factorrich monocyte-derived microvesicles, increasing the procoagulability of platelets [34]. Fusion efficiency is enhanced in an acidic microenvironment (Fig. 1) [44].Another mechanism for microvesicle uptake is fusion, whereby the microvesicles fuse with the membranes of the recipient cell and the content of the vesicle is released into 1). b Microvesicles are shed directly from the plasma membrane, thereby carrying membrane markers of the parent cell.

Techniques for extracellular vesicle detection are listed in Table 2 and briefly described below.

        <p>Although flow cytometry is widely used to detect microvesicles, it has some limitations. Flow cytometry does not detect the smallest microvesicles as individual events. Multiple microvesicles may be detected collectively as a single event, a phenomenon termed swarm detection (Table 2) [66]. In addition, small microvesicles may have a limited number of antibody binding sites, sterically restricting staining with multiple antibodies [65]. Thus, both the number of small microvesicles and their surface expression may be underestimated.Although flow cytometry is widely used to detect microvesicles, it has some limitations.

        <p>Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) examines EVs in the liquid phase using a laser beam that determines the size and concentration by filming the light scattering when the particles move under Brownian motion [54]. The technique detects vesicles with a size of 0.05-1 μm (modern instruments may lower the detection limit even further). NTA can be used in fluorescent mode, thus detecting labeled vesicles [54].

        <p>Extracellular vesicles expose numerous signaling proteins and lipids on their surface and may thus bind to and stimulate target cells directly. For example, microvesicles from platelets exposing P-selectin were shown to bind to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) on the surface of leukocytes, leading to leukocyte accumulation and aggregation [68]. During morphogenesis of multicellular organisms, shed microvesicles exposing the morphogen protein Bwingless^bind to a family of G protein-coupled receptors called frizzled, thereby forming a gradient necessary for adequate tissue development [69]. Similarly, lymphocyte-derived microvesicles carrying the morphogen Bhedgehog^may bind to its receptor on early hematopoietic stem cells and thereby induce differentiation into megakaryocytes [70].Extracellular vesicles expose numerous signaling proteins and lipids on their surface and may thus bind to and stimulate target cells directly.

        <p>Extracellular vesicles can transfer functional receptors to target cells, allowing cell signaling in cells that originally lacked the receptor or enhancing the number of receptors. For Owing to limitations in detectable size, analysis of exosomes by flow cytometry requires conjugation to beads with a bound specific antibody and can thus not be quantified or detect other exosomes not binding the antibody [63] b Nanoparticle tracking analysis can be used for the quantification of small vesicles such as exosomes, but not for larger vesicles [54] c Photo-bleaching is the process by which a fluorescent antibody fades rapidly Pediatr Nephrol (2019) 34:11-30 example, microvesicles exposing the kinin B1 receptor transferred a functional receptor to endothelial cells and to human embryonic kidney cells [71]. The transfer of adhesion molecules and receptors from platelets to hematopoietic or malignant cells via platelet-derived microvesicles modulated their adhesion capacity and engraftment [72,73]. Furthermore, microvesicles released from aggressive glioma cells transferred the oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to tumor cells causing a propagation of oncogenic activity [74]. The C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) and C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) are important for HIV-1 uptake by cells. Microvesicle-mediated transfer of CCR5 and CXCR4 enabled HIV-1 to be internalized in cells previously not susceptible to the virus [75,76], suggesting that this might be a means of disseminating HIV infection.Extracellular vesicles can transfer functional receptors to target cells, allowing cell signaling in cells that originally lacked the receptor or enhancing the number of receptors.

        <p>Extracellular vesicles transport proteins such as cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors to neighboring or distant cells, resulting in modulation of the target cell. In addition, EVs may transfer functional channels. Exosomes originating in murine kidney-collecting duct cells (mCCDC11) transfer functional aquaporin 2 (AQP2), increasing water transport in recipient cells [77] and can thus potentially be involved in intra-renal signaling downstream in the nephron. Upon release, EVs may shelter proteins that would otherwise be phagocytosed or neutralized in free form in plasma, thus protecting their content from the host response [22]. This mode of transport can also be utilized by bacterial and viral components to evade the host response [22,78]. Bioactive lipids, such as sphingosine 1-phosphate and arachidonic acid, are also transported within microvesicles [79]. Lipids in platelet microvesicles can increase adhesion between endothelial cells and monocytes [80]; hence, microvesicles not only affect recipient cells, but also other cells in their microenvironment.Extracellular vesicles transport proteins such as cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors to neighboring or distant cells, resulting in modulation of the target cell.

        <p>Extracellular vesicles are enriched in mRNA and miRNA, which can be transferred horizontally to and translated in recipient cells, thereby changing the phenotype of the cell. For example, microvesicles shed by endothelial progenitor cells induced activation of quiescent endothelial cells and stimulated angiogenesis by transfer of mRNA [81]. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived EVs transfer mRNAs, inducing transcription and proliferation of tubular epithelial cells after in vivo injury [82]. Exosomes may regulate mRNA levels in recipient cells by delivering functional miRNA, thus blocking translation [83][84][85]. Transfer of miRNA by urinary exosomes to tubular cells modulated their function, as exemplified by diminished ROMK1 potassium channel levels in human collecting duct cells [86]. Exosomal transfer of certain miRNAs between immune cells conferred both a proinflammatory and an anti-inflammatory effect in vitro and in mice following endotoxin administration [87]. Likewise, vesicles derived from endothelial progenitor cells contain mRNAs coding for inhibitors of the complement system and antiapoptotic molecules, thereby inhibiting complement-induced apoptosis and complement deposition on mesangial cells [88]. Interestingly, horizontal transfer of genetic material and the changes seen in the target cells were even demonstrated between cells of different species [89].Extracellular vesicles are enriched in mRNA and miRNA, which can be transferred horizontally to and translated in recipient cells, thereby changing the phenotype of the cell.

        <p>The presence of complement C5b-9 on shed microvesicles may preserve the integrity of the parent cells by elimination of complement and the risk of cytolysis [90]. EVs from healthy individuals contain active caspase-3 that was not found in the parental cells, suggesting that caspase-3 might have been removed from the cells to ensure survival [91]. Inhibition of microvesicle release from viable endothelial cells containing active caspase-3 triggered both apoptosis and detachment of the cells [92]. Intriguingly, dying cells release microvesicles bearing the adaptor protein Crkl during the early stages of apoptosis induced by the caspase 3 cascade. These microvesicles were isolated from glomeruli after injury and were shown to induce compensatory proliferation signaling in recipient cells [93,94]. Taken together, release of microvesicles may rid the cell of toxic substances, but may also induce repair in neighboring cells.The presence of complement C5b-9 on shed microvesicles may preserve the integrity of the parent cells by elimination of complement and the risk of cytolysis [90]. EVs from healthy individuals contain active caspase-3 that was not found in the parental cells, suggesting that caspase-3 might have been removed from the cells to ensure survival [91]. Inhibition of microvesicle release from viable endothelial cells containing active caspase-3 triggered both apoptosis and detachment of the cells [92].

        <p>Extracellular vesicles play an important role in coagulation, platelet aggregation, and thrombosis. Pro-thrombotic properties of microvesicles are primarily associated with exposure of negatively charged phosphatidylserine and tissue factor [95]. Phosphatidylserine on circulating platelet-and monocytederived microvesicles provides binding sites for the assembly of coagulation factors such as factor IXa, Va, Xa, and VIII followed by thrombin generation [96]. Phosphatidylserine is also present on exosomal membranes [9]. It not only facilitates formation of coagulation complexes, but also promotes tissue factor activity [97]. Tissue factor is normally encrypted, but may be exposed on microvesicles released from platelets, monocytes or endothelial cells [16,34,98] and form a complex with factor VII/VIIa, thereby activating the extrinsic pathway of coagulation.Extracellular vesicles play an important role in coagulation, platelet aggregation, and thrombosis.

        <p>Platelet-derived microvesicles have a significantly higher pro-coagulant activity compared with activated platelets most probably because of their higher surface density of phosphatidylserine, factor Xa, P-selectin, and αIIbβ 3 (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa) [99]. At the site of vascular injury, plateletderived microvesicles support thrombus formation by facilitating the adhesion of platelets to endothelial cell matrix components [100]. The interaction between PSGL-1 on monocyte-derived microvesicles and selectins on platelets, endothelial cells or their shed microvesicles provides a basis for thrombus formation [34].Platelet-derived microvesicles have a significantly higher pro-coagulant activity compared with activated platelets most probably because of their higher surface density of phosphatidylserine, factor Xa, P-selectin, and αIIbβ 3 (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa) [99].

        <p>Microvesicles derived from blood and endothelial and tumor cells [101] may possess angiogenic properties, as previously reviewed [102]. The angiogenic effect may be associated with exposure of surface molecules or growth factors within the vesicles. Lymphoid microvesicles induced production of endothelial nitric oxide formation, expression of adhesion molecules, in addition to in vitro angiogenesis and in vivo neovascularization in endothelial cells [103]. Endothelial cellderived microvesicles induced invasion of endothelial cells into basement membranes followed by capillary-like structure formation in vitro [104]. These properties may be of importance during tissue injury, post-ischemic revascularization and regeneration [105], and thus have importance during acute kidney injury (AKI).Microvesicles derived from blood and endothelial and tumor cells [101] may possess angiogenic properties, as previously reviewed [102].

        <p>Activation of the complement system is usually directed against foreign antigens such as bacteria or damaged host cells. Complement activation and deposition of the membrane attack complex on blood cells is followed by the release of complement-coated microvesicles [111,112]. Microvesicles bearing C1q reflect activation of the classical pathway of complement on the parent cell [113], whereas the presence of C3 reflects amplification of all three pathways of the complement via the alternative pathway [111]. Direct activation on vesicles, after shedding, may potentially also occur. Blood cellderived EVs expose complement regulators on their surface such as complement receptor type 1 (C1R), membrane cofactor protein (CD46), decay accelerating factor (DAF/CD55) or CD59 [111,114], thereby inhibiting assembly of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9) and preventing excessive complement activation. In addition, EVs opsonized by C3b are rapidly cleared from the circulation by phagocytes [115].Activation of the complement system is usually directed against foreign antigens such as bacteria or damaged host cells.

        <p>Extracellular vesicles are capable of inducing both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses.

Glomerular endothelial cell-derived microvesicles exposing the kinin B1 receptor and interleukin 8 (IL-8) on their surface attracted neutrophils [127,128].

        <p>Shiga toxin is transported in vivo bound to blood cells and after uptake in these cells released within microvesicles (reviewed in Karpman et al. [221]). Blood cell-derived microvesicles transport Shiga toxin to the kidney, where the toxin, within microvesicles, is taken up in glomerular endothelial cells and peritubular capillary endothelial cells. Within the endothelial cells, the microvesicles either empty their cargo or are transcytosed through the cells, and their corresponding basement membranes, into podocytes or tubular cells, respectively. Eventually the microvesicles empty their cargo, although the signal leading to this release of contents is unknown. Intracellular toxin undergoes retrograde transport, binds to ribosomes and induces cell death thus causing renal failure [22]. HUS is characterized by platelet activation and the formation of microthrombi, hemolysis, and acute renal failure. These studies show that microvesicles are not only biomarkers, but actively contribute to disease-specific processes during STEC-HUS by creating a pro-thrombotic environment, partaking in hemolysis, and transporting Shiga toxin into the kidney to induce renal cell death.Shiga toxin is transported in vivo bound to blood cells and after uptake in these cells released within microvesicles (reviewed in Karpman et al.

They can be detected as biomarkers of disease owing to their excessive numbers and their properties and may also contribute to the development of diseases, including kidney disease, by inducing inflammation, vascular injury, and thrombosis in addition to modulating the immune response. Their contribution to the induction and progression of renal diseases may lead to the development of treatments geared toward temporary reduction of EVs systemically in the circulation, or locally in the kidney and urinary tract. Treatments that reduce the release or uptake of EVs need to take into account the notion that EVs may also be cytoprotective, as their release and the removal of unwanted or damaging substances from their parent cells may maintain cellular integrity. EVs may have potentially beneficial properties associated with tubular regeneration and the induction of angiogenesis. The therapeutic potential and nephroprotective effects of EVs, owing to their capacity to shuttle proteins, lipids, and genetic cargo to recipient cells, are being explored in preclinical studies, which may lead to clinical trials in the future.Extracellular vesicles play an important role in normal intercellular communication.
