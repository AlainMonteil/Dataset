        <p>Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common disease among men worldwide. It is important to know survival outcomes and prognostic factors for this disease. Recruitment for the largest therapeutic randomised controlled trial in PCa-the Systemic Therapy in Advancing or Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Drug Efficacy: A Multi-Stage Multi-Arm Randomised Controlled Trial (STAMPEDE)-includes men with newly diagnosed metastatic PCa who are commencing long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT); the control arm provides valuable data for a prospective cohort. Objective: Describe survival outcomes, along with current treatment standards and factors associated with prognosis, to inform future trial design in this patient group. Design, setting, and participants: STAMPEDE trial control arm comprising men newly diagnosed with M1 disease who were recruited between October 2005 and January 2014.</p>
        <p>Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Overall survival (OS) and failure-free survival (FFS) were reported by primary disease characteristics using Kaplan-Meier methods. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived from multivariate Cox models. Results and limitations: A cohort of 917 men with newly diagnosed M1 disease was recruited to the control arm in the specified interval. Median follow-up was 20 mo. Median age at randomisation was 66 yr (interquartile range [IQR]: 61-71), and median prostate-specific antigen level was 112 ng/ml (IQR: 34-373). Most men (n = 574; 62%) had bone-only metastases, whereas 237 (26%) had both bone and soft tissue metastases; soft tissue metastasis was found mainly in distant lymph nodes. There were 238 deaths, 202 (85%) from PCa. Median FFS was 11 mo; 2-yr FFS was 29% (95% CI, 25-33). Median OS was 42 mo; 2-yr OS was 72% (95% CI, 68-76). Survival time was influenced by</p>
        <p>The Systemic Therapy in Advancing or Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Drug Efficacy: A Multi-Stage Multi-Arm Randomised Controlled Trial (STAMPEDE) started recruiting in October 2005. It recruits men with either newly diagnosed metastatic (M1), high-risk localised, or node-positive (N+) prostate cancer (PCa). The trial tests the addition of further treatments to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), including docetaxel, zoledronic acid, celecoxib, abiraterone, enzalutamide, and (among newly diagnosed M1 patients only) radiotherapy, using a multiarm, multistage design. Research arms have recruited at overlapping times, but the control arm has been consistently ADT alone and recruited throughout [1].</p>
        <p>PCa is the second most common cancer worldwide among men. With newer licensed therapies that prolong survival in patients relapsing with metastatic castrateresistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] and the increasingly widespread use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, men with M1 disease may have lower disease burden at diagnosis than in the past. In this era of PSA testing and effective therapies for patients with mCRPC, there are limited, contemporary, long-term data on the natural history of newly diagnosed patients receiving ADT alone. Data from older studies tend to quote median overall survival (OS) times of 30-36 mo [2,3,[10][11][12] and a median OS of around 18 mo in the castrate-resistant setting. Given recent changes to the management paradigm of mCRPC, it is timely to explore current survival outcomes and treatment standards. Now the largest therapeutic randomised controlled trial in PCa, the STAMPEDE trial's control arm provides valuable data on survival outcomes, prognostic factors, and subsequent treatments for a prospective cohort of men with newly diagnosed M1 disease receiving standard-of-care therapy. This paper aims to describe survival outcomes for such men and considers these in the context of similar groups in older trials. We also investigate factors associated with prognosis and describe subsequent treatments received following disease progression.</p>
        <p>Patients and methods</p>
        <p>Patients were recruited to the STAMPEDE trial from &gt;100 sites across the United Kingdom and Switzerland. To be eligible, patients must have PCa that was either high-risk, newly diagnosed, nonmetastatic, node-negative (N0) disease, newly diagnosed M1 or N+ disease, or disease (previously treated with radical surgery and/or radiotherapy) that was rapidly relapsing at the time of randomisation. There were no age restrictions, and patients had to be fit for chemotherapy and have no significant cardiovascular history.</p>
        <p>For this prospective cohort analysis, we selected all men with newly diagnosed (within 6 mo prior to randomisation) metastatic PCa who were randomised to the control arm of the STAMPEDE trial between October 2005 and January 2014 (Fig. 1). either orchidectomy or luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonists or antagonists, with or without long-term oral antiandrogens. Treatment after disease progression was at the discretion of the consulting clinician.</p>
        <p>Baseline data included patient demographics, metastatic sites, regional lymph node status, primary tumour stage, and diagnosis date. Details of disease progression and subsequent treatments were obtained from progression forms. Details of cardiovascular and acute renal events were obtained from follow-up and serious adverse event forms. The protocol can be found online [13]. The trial was registered both on clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00268476 and on controlled-trials.com as ISRCTN78818544, had the relevant regulatory and ethics approval, and all patients gave written, informed consent.</p>
        <p>The trial's definitive and intermediate primary outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and failure-free survival (FFS) [14]; these outcome measures formed the primary focus of this cohort analysis. Survival was defined as time from randomisation to death from any cause. FFS was defined as time from randomisation to evidence of at least one of the following: biochemical failure; progression either locally, in lymph nodes, or in distant metastases; or death from PCa.</p>
        <p>Biochemical failure was defined as failing at diagnosis (PSA nadir &gt;50% of the last pretreatment PSA level), 50% increase above nadir (PSA nadir at least 50% lower than the last pretreatment PSA level but remaining &gt;4 ng/ml), or either a 50% increase from nadir or PSA level &gt;4 ng/ml (PSA nadir &lt;4 ng/ml). The PSA nadir was taken as the lowest PSA value reported in the first 24 wk after randomisation.</p>
        <p>Cause of death was determined by blinded central review. Death from PCa was taken when classified by the reviewer as definitely or probably PCa. The site investigator's determination was used for deaths not yet reviewed.</p>
        <p>Outcomes were defined according to the following baseline groupings:</p>
        <p>metastases grouping (bone only, soft tissue only, bone and soft tissue); regional lymph node status (N0, N+, NX) and primary tumour stage</p>
        <p>The cohort selection process is shown in Figure 1. Of 5272 eligible patients randomised to the trial from October 2005 to January 2014, 1716 patients were allocated to the control arm. Of these, 917 men had metastatic PCa newly diagnosed within 6 mo before randomisation. These 917 men form the cohort described here and constitute 17% of patients joining the trial. The data set was frozen in January 2014, with median follow-up of 20 mo (interquartile range [IQR]: 6-37) and total follow-up for all patients of 1449.7 yr.</p>
        <p>Table 1 shows the cohort baseline characteristics (split by age group in Supplementary Table 1). Median age at randomisation was 66 yr (IQR: 61-71), with 620 of 917 men (68%) &lt;70 yr old. Median time from PCa diagnosis to randomisation . Two-year estimates for FFS and survival were 29% (95% CI, 25-33), and 72% (95% CI, 68-76), respectively (Fig. 2). Tables 2 and3 show the relative impact of prognostic factors on FFS and OS, respectively. In univariate models, metastases grouping was associated with both FFS and OS, as were primary tumour stage, initial Gleason sum score category, age group, and WHO performance status. Figures 3 and4 present Kaplan-Meier curves by metastases grouping, WHO performance status, initial Gleason sum score category, and age group, for FFS and OS, respectively. Presence of bone metastases was associated with lower 2-yr OS in men with soft tissue metastases, from 85% to 60% (hazard ratio: 3.42; 95% CI, 1.96-5.97). Higher PSA level before starting ADT and higher primary tumour stage showed evidence of worsened FFS. In the subset of patients with bone-only metastases, there was no evidence that regional lymph node involvement affected either FFS or OS. In the landmark analysis of 457 patients with sufficient followup and event free at 26 wk, higher PSA nadir showed evidence of worsened FFS; this was similar for OS in 644 patients with sufficient follow-up and alive at 26 wk.</p>
        <p>In multivariate models, presence of bone metastases regardless of soft tissue metastases, worse WHO performance status, higher or unknown initial Gleason sum score category, and younger age at randomisation showed strong evidence of both worsened FFS and OS after adjusting for the other factors. Worsening primary tumour stage and higher PSA level before starting ADT were both associated with poorer FFS outcomes but not OS.</p>
        <p>Cardiovascular and acute renal events Cardiovascular causes were reported as primary cause of death (COD) for seven patients; none had renal causes reported as primary COD, although it was reported as secondary COD for 11 patients (10 for whom PCa was primary COD). With regard to worse toxicity grade reported up to disease progression, seven patients had G3-4 cardiac disorder and nine patients had G3-4 renal toxicity (Table 4).</p>
        <p>Supplementary Figure 1a shows the most frequent series of subsequent therapies reported at progression (given either in combination or independently over time), which were bisphosphonate, chemotherapy, and abiraterone; no further detail is reported here. Supplementary Figure 1b shows time to subsequent therapy from first FFS event; all crossover/ subsequent treatments after initial treatment failure were given at the investigator's discretion. Of 502 patients relapsing so far, 50% started chemotherapy within 16 mo after an FFS event; other subsequent therapies, including bisphosphonate and abiraterone, were reported starting after a longer time.</p>
        <p>Of 502 patients with an FFS event, 230 died; median follow-up time from FFS event was 22 mo. Median survival from FFS event was also 22 mo, with 46% (95% CI, 40-51) alive 2 yr after the first FFS event.</p>
        <p>Within this cohort of metastatic, newly diagnosed PCa patients, treated only with ADT, we found median FFS to be 11.2 mo for the whole cohort from study entry, whereas median OS was 42.1 mo. For FFS and OS, respectively 29% and 72% of patients were event free at 2 yr. Factors prognostic of worsened outcome included presence of bone metastases with or without soft tissue metastases, worse WHO performance status, higher or unknown initial Gleason sum score category, and younger age at randomisation, for both FFS and OS. Worsening primary tumour stage and higher PSA level before starting ADT were associated with worsened FFS only. PSA nadir at 24 wk was pertinent in the landmark analysis of patients who were still responding to ADT at that time. Subsequent therapies reported soonest on disease progression were largely chemotherapy based. These data suggest a relative improvement in survival outcomes compared to older literature, but survival from presentation with M1 PCa remains disappointing (Fig. 2). The median OS reported here is longer than in the Phase III Randomized Double-Blind Study of Clodronate versus Placebo in Patients with Prostate Cancer Metastatic to Bone Who Are Commencing or Responding to Initial Hormone Therapy (MRC PR05; 28 mo) and SWOG Phase III Trial Experience S8894 (33 mo) [11,12,15], shorter than in the control arms of the Androgen-Deprivation Therapy Alone or with Docetaxel in Noncastrate Metastatic Prostate Cancer Trial (GETUG-15; 54 mo) and SWOG Phase III Trial Experience S9346 (49 mo) [12,16], and similar to the 42 mo presented for the control arm in the ChemoHormonal Therapy versus Androgen Ablation Randomized Trial for Extensive Disease in Prostate Cancer (CHAARTED) [17]. Inclusion criteria were not identical for these trials.</p>
        <p>Data collected within our cohort allowed examination of prognostic factors at presentation. Of particular interest was the lack of detectable effect of regional lymph node positivity as compared to distant node positivity on overall prognosis. In particular, these data underscore the value of y Cox models adjusted for all other variables unless marked as NR (not relevant). § WHO performance status is defined as: 0: normal activity without restriction; 1: strenuous activity restricted, can do light work; 2: up and about &gt;50% of waking hours, capable of self-care. # Analyses for PSA nadir were based on a landmark start time for patients of 6 mo; therefore, 2-yr survival is survival at 18 mo from the landmark.</p>
        <p>[ ( F i g . _ 3 ) T D $ F I G ] soft tissue imaging in patients presenting with a positive bone scan, as concurrent presence of soft tissue metastasis (mainly lymph nodes), in addition to bone metastases, worsened 2-yr OS from 75% to 60%. Although uncommon, soft tissue-only metastases had the most favourable outcome, with 85% 2-yr OS. These effects were similar whether the small proportion with visceral metastases was omitted or included.</p>
        <p>The finding that median OS is more than double the median FFS demonstrates that the mCRPC phase now makes up the majority of the survival time rather than being a short terminal phase with limited treatment options. This is consistent with the growing number of available therapies for mCRPC. Indeed, our prospectively collected data were drawn from men treated in the so-called docetaxel era. Several new agents have been licensed for mCRPC since 2002, including therapies such as docetaxel [2,3], cabazitaxel [4], and abiraterone [5,7]; there are other new agents such as enzalutamide [6], radium-223 [8], and sipuleucel-T [9] with positive results but limited availability so far in this cohort. In addition, there have been improvements in supportive care, particularly for men with bony metastatic PCa, with licensing of zoledronic acid [18,19] and denusomab [20,21]. Attitudes in managing men with mCRPC have shifted from care with palliative intent to active treatment using therapies improving survival and reducing morbidity.</p>
        <p>The cohort of patients presented here should access these new salvage options. Abiraterone has only been widely available since 2011, with a licence extension to the prechemotherapy population in 2013; hence, we would expect to see changes in patterns of abiraterone use as the data mature. With a similar extension of the licence to pre-docetaxel patients pending for enzalutamide, this use is also likely to change. Likewise, although all patients entering the trial were fit for chemotherapy, the reported median time from relapse to chemotherapy is estimated at 16 mo, with time to the upper quartile not yet reached, suggesting a significant proportion of patients will never receive chemotherapy. As drugs such as abiraterone (also an experimental arm in the main trial) move into wider practice, we shall examine the impact of salvage strategies on OS (Supplementary Fig. 1).</p>
        <p>The main strengths of our cohort include patients being from multiple centres with consistent, prospectively collected data and uniform standard-of-care treatment. However, there are limitations. First, our substantive cohort was drawn from the control arm of a clinical trial, inevitably applying eligibility restrictions. This cohort was likely more fit-due to exclusions for cardiovascular disease, men had to be sufficiently fit to potentially receive chemotherapy (to March 2013) and to have no significant cardiovascular history [22] to potentially receive celecoxib (to April 2011 [22,23]-and younger than unselected men with newly diagnosed metastatic PCa (median age was around 10 yr below the median of the PCa population). Use of upfront docetaxel may have deterred older patients from entering the trial and may be one of the explanations for the low median age of this cohort; age is often used inappropriately as a surrogate for fitness. As our cohort may be less likely to die from intercurrent illness, particularly cardiovascular, PCa was the leading cause of death.</p>
        <p>Second, our analyses are timed from randomisation rather than diagnosis, making comparability against other cohorts difficult, particularly single-centre series likely to start from diagnosis. Patients were only eligible for STAMPEDE if they were on ADT for no longer than 12 wk before randomisation; most patients had been exposed to 6-8 wk of ADT before randomisation.</p>
        <p>Third, median follow-up within this cohort is only 20 mo; recruitment was ongoing when this data set was frozen; however, more than one-half of patients reported a FFS event (502 of 917 men). Fourth, there may be underreporting of treatments used after first progression, particularly for treatments given later in the patient pathway.</p>
        <p>The prognostic variables used within the multivariate models were all pre-specified and we feel we used the best disease predictors that we could identify in the data set available. We acknowledge that the multivariate model is likely incomplete. Laboratory values (including haemoglobin, albumin, serum creatinine, and alkaline phosphatase levels) were requested, but the completeness of the necessary data to standardise these variables was lower than we wished to accept and we wanted to avoid imputation of missing values. These are likely important measures, previously identified as prognostic factors in the Halabi nomogram, albeit in CRPC patients [24]. We did not collect data on bone pain [25]. We anticipate that WHO performance status (which we included in our analysis) may already reflect the impact on general health from these other variables.</p>
        <p>Although using data from a trial's control arm has limitations, there is a need for a population-based prospective cohort study in this population to address questions prospectively. No such study has been reported, and construction of one would be at great financial cost while taking many years to provide reliable long-term data. The control arm of a high recruiting trial, such as STAMPEDE, therefore provides high-quality prospective data for patients receiving standard-of-care therapy in a hormone-naı ¨ve setting. It makes efficient use of the wealth of data collected for the trial, incurring no extensive additional costs and simultaneously providing treatment safety and efficacy answers. Also, our eligibility criteria were typical of clinical trials in this therapy area, so these data are particularly relevant to planning future studies in this population.</p>
