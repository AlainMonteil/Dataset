        <p>Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), as a reactive oxygen species, is widely generated in many biological systems. It has been considered as an important signaling molecule that mediates various physiological and biochemical processes in plants. Normal metabolism in plant cells results in H 2 O 2 generation, from a variety of sources. Also, it is now clear that nitric oxide (NO) and calcium (Ca 2+ ) function as signaling molecules in plants. Both H 2 O 2 and NO are involved in plant development and abiotic responses. A wide range of evidences suggest that NO could be generated under similar stress conditions and with similar kinetics as H 2 O 2 . The interplay between H 2 O 2 and NO has important functional implications to modulate transduction processes in plants. Moreover, close interaction also exists between H 2 O 2 and Ca 2+ in response to development and abiotic stresses in plants. Cellular responses to H 2+ 2 O 2 and Ca signaling systems are complex. There is quite a bit of interaction between H 2 O 2 and Ca 2+ signaling in responses to several stimuli. This review aims to introduce these evidences in our understanding of the crosstalk among H 2 O 2 , NO, and Ca 2+ signaling which regulates plant growth and development, and other cellular and physiological responses to abiotic stresses.

        <p>Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), a form of reactive oxygen species, is regarded as a common cellular metabolite. H 2 O 2 is continually synthesized through various sources including enzyme and nonenzyme pathways in plants. To date, it has become accepted that H 2 O 2 plays important roles in plant developmental and physiological processes including seed germination (Barba-Espín et al., 2011), programmed cell death (PCD; Cheng et al., 2015;Vavilala et al., 2015), senescence (Liao et al., 2012b), flowering (Liu et al., 2013), root system development (Liao et al., 2009;Ma et al., 2014;Hernández-Barrera et al., 2015), stomatal aperture regulation (Ge et al., 2015) and many others. It is now clear that H 2 O 2 functions as a signaling molecule which may respond to various stimuli in plant cells. These results suggest that H 2 O 2 may be involved in cellular signaling transduction pathways and gene expression modulations in plants.</p>
        <p>Nitric oxide (NO), as a small signaling molecule, appears to be involved in plant developmental and physiological processes such as seed germination (Wang et al., 2015), ripening and senescence (Shi Y. et al., 2015) as well as stomatal closure (Shi K. et al., 2015) and pollen tube growth (Wang et al., 2009). Meanwhile, NO signaling may have a vital role in the disease resistance (Kovacs et al., 2015) and response to abiotic stresses such as cold (Fan et al., 2015), salt (Liu W. et al., 2015) and drought (Shan et al., 2015). Calcium ion (Ca 2+ ) signaling is also a core regulator of plant physiological process and stress adaption such as cell polarity regulation (Zhou et al., 2014), leaf de-etiolation (Huang et al., 2012), stomatal closure (Zou et al., 2015). Additionally, Ca 2+ signaling is also involved in various responses to abiotic stimuli, including light (Hu et al., 2015) and heavy metal (Li et al., 2016).</p>
        <p>A large amount of research show that H 2 O 2 , NO and Ca 2+ as signaling are involved in plant growth and development as well as response to abiotic stresses. In this review, we focus on H 2 O 2 signaling activities and its cross-talk with Ca 2+ and NO in plants.</p>
        <p>are numerous routes of H 2 O 2 production in plant cells, such as photorespiration, electron transport chains (ETC), and redox reaction.</p>
        <p>There is evidence for H 2 O 2 production in plants through several enzymes includingcell wall peroxidases (Francoz et al., 2015), oxalate (Hu et al., 2003), amine oxidases and flavincontaining enzymes (Cona et al., 2006; Figure 1). Moreover, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases may also increase H 2 O 2 level through generating superoxide which could be converted to H 2 O 2 by superoxide dismutases (SOD; Grivennikova and Vinogradov, 2013;Brewer et al., 2015). Remans et al. (2010) observed that ROS accumulation, especially H 2 O 2 formation, is mostly related with the stimulation of NADPH oxidase in plants under heavy metal stresses. Moreover, H 2 O 2 produced by NADPH oxidases may significantly increase proline accumulation in Arabidopsis thaliana under salt or mannitol stress (Ben Rejeb et al., 2015). Additionally, some other oxidases such as glucose oxidases, glycolate oxidases (Chang and Tang, 2014), and sulfite oxidases (Brychkova et al., 2012) may oxidize their own substrates to produce H 2 O 2 (Figure 1).</p>
        <p>Several non-enzymatic reactions are also known to produce H 2 O 2 . For example, many reactions involved in photosynthesis and respiration are responsible for H 2 O 2 production. It is generated continually via electron transport reactions both in mitochondria and chloroplasts (Figure 1).</p>
        <p>Peroxisome is considered to be the site of photorespiration in plant cell, which needs light-dependent uptake of O 2 and releases CO 2 accompanying with the generation of H 2 O 2 . It is suggested that H 2 O 2 synthesis is associated with the oxidation of glycolate during the photosynthetic carbon oxidation cycle (Foyer and Noctor, 2003; Figure 1).</p>
        <p>Chloroplast is the source of photosynthesis in plants. Chloroplasts are the crucial sites for H 2 O 2 production during photosynthesis. H 2 O 2 generation is associated with oxygen reduction in chloroplast (Figure 1). Mehler (1951) discovered that reduction of O 2 lead to the formation of H 2 O 2 in the presence of light in chloroplast. Moreover, H 2 O 2 production can also be produced by the reduction of O - 2 by photosynthetic electron transport (PET) chain components such as Fe-S centers, reduced thioredoxin (TRX), ferredoxin and reduced plastoquinone in the chloroplast (Dat et al., 2000). In addition, non-enzymatic production of H 2 O 2 in chloroplast may be detected at the manganese-containing, oxygen evolving complex which is the donor site of photosystem II (Figure 1). But this process, in most cases, may probably be ignored under physiological conditions.</p>
        <p>One important source of endogenously produced H 2 O 2 in plant cell is mitochondria (Dickinson and Chang, 2011). H 2 O 2 is generated in mitochondria during aerobic respiration when O - 2 is produced from complexes I and III in the electron transport chain, which is then rapidly converted to H 2 O 2 by the enzyme superoxide dismutase (Figure 1).</p>
        <p>The antioxidant systems that regulate H 2 O 2 levels consist of both non-enzymatic and enzymatic H 2 O 2 scavengers (Figure 1). H 2 O 2 -scavenging enzymes include catalase (CAT; Willekens et al., 1997), peroxidase (POX; Fan and Huang, 2012), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR; Jahan and Anis, 2014). Some studies revealed that APX was found in the cytosol (Begara-Morales et al., 2013), chloroplasts (Asada, 2006), andmitochondria (Navrot et al., 2007). Meanwhile, CAT can decompose H 2 O 2 in peroxisome (Nyathi and Baker, 2006). It is quite clear that these enzymes exist in different organelles and they might decrease H 2 O 2 content efficiently and maintain the stability of membranes.</p>
        <p>Ascorbate (AsA) and glutathione (GSH), as non-enzymatic compounds, are constantly participated in regulating ROS level (Kapoor et al., 2015). AsA, a key antioxidant for elimination of H 2 O 2 , can react with H 2 O 2 directly. GSH is a crucial antioxidant which may be associated with regenerating AsA, and rapidly oxidizes excess H 2 O 2 . Therefore, GSH is also involved in regulating H 2 O 2 level and redox balance in plant cells (Krifka et al., 2012). In fact, H 2 O 2 homeostasis seems to result in some biological effects on plant cells which may be as a signaling sign in signaling transduction pathway.</p>
        <p>Table 1 shows that H 2 O 2 mediates various developmental and physiological processes in plants. These findings indicate that H 2 O 2 may affect different parts of plants by increasing endogenous H 2 O 2 level or by regulating relative gene expression. Also, the change of H 2 O 2 level may impact metabolic and antioxidant enzyme activity in favor of plant growth and development (Barba-Espín et al., 2011;Liu et al., 2013). However, the mechanisms that allow different H 2 O 2 function in plants still require examination.</p>
        <p>Recent studies have demonstrated that H 2 O 2 is a key signaling molecule in the signaling pathway, which associated with abiotic stress response. A number of discussions showed that H 2 O 2 could respond to abiotic stresses such as drought (Hameed and Iqbal, 2014;Ashraf et al., 2015), salinity (Sathiyaraj et al., 2014;Mohamed et al., 2015), cold (Orabi et al., 2015), high temperatures (Wang Y. et al., 2014;Wu et al., 2015), UV radiation (He et al., 2005), ozone (Oksanen et al., 2004), and heavy metal (Wen et al., 2013; Table 2). It is clear from these studies that H 2 O 2 could enhance abiotic stress resistance through protecting organelle structure under abiotic stress conditions. For instance, H 2 O 2 may protect chloroplast ultrastructure to preserve photosynthesis under abiotic stress. Similarly, to improve plant abiotic stress tolerance, H 2 O 2 may modulate the expression of resistance genes and antioxidant enzyme activities during abiotic stress response.</p>
        <p>H 2 O 2 as a Signaling Molecule in Plant Among ROS, H 2 O 2 has comparatively long life span and small size, which permit it to traverse through cellular membranes to different cellular compartments. García-Mata and Lamattina (2013) found that H 2 O 2 may move between cells through aquaporin channels for signaling transduction. Increasing evidences point out that H 2 O 2 signaling may regulate various plant physiological processes. For example, H 2 O 2 as signaling molecule may participate in nitrosative stress-triggered cell death in kimchi cabbage (Brassica rapa var. glabra Regel) seedlings (Kim et al., 2015). Also, Li et al. (2015) suggested that H 2 O 2 is involved in signaling crosstalk between NO and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) to induce thermotolerance in maize seedlings. Moreover, the interaction among H 2 O 2 , NO and Ca 2+ could relieve copper stress in Ulva compressa (González et al., 2012). H 2 O 2 signaling was also demonstrated to play a salient role in brassinosteroid-regulated stomatal movement (Shi C. et al., 2015). As stated above, H 2 O 2 as an important signaling molecule may play a significant role at every stage of plant life and under various abiotic stress conditions. H 2 O 2 signaling appears to crosstalk with many different signaling molecules such as hormones (Shi C. et al., 2015), protein kinase (González et al., 2012) and many other small signaling molecules (Li et al., 2015). H 2 O 2 and these signaling molecules may influence each other through various positive and negative feedback loops. Thus, they co-regulate cell division and differentiation, antioxidant system as well as gene expression involved in plant development and defense.</p>
        <p>NO is a diatomic free radical gas. Previous studies suggested that NO could take part in a wide range of physiological processes such as vasorelaxation, nervous system, defense against pathogens in animals (Mayer and Hemmens, 1998). In mammals, NO is synthesized via three different isoforms of NO synthase (NOS) including inducible NOS (iNOS; Nathan and Hibbs, 1991), endothelial NOS (eNOS) and neuronal NOS (nNOS; Förstermann et al., 1994). In plants, NO could be synthesized through enzymatic and non-enzymatic pathways (Figure 2). The enzymatic pathway includes nitrate reductase (NR; Rockel et al., 2002), nitric oxide-like (NOS-like) synthase (Guo et al., 2003), Nitrite-NO reductase (Ni-NOR;Stöhr et al., 2001) and xanthine oxidase (XOR; Corpas et al., 2004) pathways.</p>
        <p>The non-enzymatic generation of NO includes nitrification or de-nitrification processes (Skiba et al., 1993, Figure 2).</p>
        <p>A plethora of evidences suggest that NO, as a versatile signaling molecule, is involved in regulating every aspect of plant growth and developmental processes such as seed germination (Fan et al., 2013;Wang et al., 2015), flowering (Liu W. W. et al., 2015), root growth and development (Liao et al., 2011;Wu et al., 2014;Xiang et al., 2015), ripening and senescence (Liao et al., 2013;Shi Y. et al., 2015). Meanwhile, as a physiological regulator, NO signaling is involved in mediating stomatal closure (Noelia et al., 2015;Shi K. et al., 2015;Chen et al., 2016), pollen tube growth (Wang et al., 2009). Also, NO plays an essential role in plant disease resistance (Rasul et al., 2012;Kovacs et al., 2015) and responses to various abiotic stresses such as cold (Fan et al., 2015), heat (Yu et al., 2015), salt (Liu W. et al., 2015), drought (Shan et al., 2015), UV-B (Esringu et al., 2015) and heavy metal (Alemayehu et al., 2015;Chen et al., 2015;Kaur et al., 2015).These studies have paved the way to understand the signaling roles of NO which may affect cell metabolism, cellular redox balance and gene expression in plants. The relative target receptor may receive signaling activated by various stimuli. As a result, NO may activate regulatory mechanism to promote developmental and physiological processes and regulate abiotic stress response in plants.</p>
        <p>To date, the interaction between H 2 O 2 and NO has been demonstrated clearly in plants. The signaling crosstalk between H 2 O 2 and NO has been considered to be an essential factor to influence plant developmental and physiological processes such as leaf cell death (Lin et al., 2012), delay senescence (Iakimova and Woltering, 2015), root growth and development (Liao et al., 2010(Liao et al., , 2011)), stomatal closure (Huang et al., 2015;Shi K. et al., 2015), and pollen tube growth (Serrano et al., 2012). (Zhang et al., 2007). Thus, the interaction of H 2 O 2 and NO may trigger a serious of physiological and biological response in plant cells.</p>
        <p>Recently, the roles of H 2 O 2 and NO signaling and their crosstalk in mediating plant response to abiotic stresses have been largely established (Table 4). (Guo et al., 2003), L-Arginine may be catalyzed to NO. In non-enzymatic pathway, N - 2 could be transformed to NO through nitrification and denitrification (Skiba et al., 1993). NO plays an important signaling molecule in plant. It could regulate developmental and physiological processes such as seed germination (Wang et al., 2015), root development (Liao et al., 2011) and stomatal closure (Shi C. et al., 2015). Also, it may be involved in response to abiotic stresses such as cold (Fan et al., 2015), salt (Liu W. et al., 2015) and drought (Shan et al., 2015). (Lu et al., 2009;Liao et al., 2012a). Thus, the interaction between H 2 O 2 and NO may alleviate drought stress through up-regulating antioxidant defense system to protect cell membrane and maintain ion homeostasis in plants.</p>
        <p>The interaction between H 2 O 2 and NO plays an important role in plant tolerance to salt stress (Zhang et al., 2007;Tan et al., 2013). Tanou et al. (2009) suggested that H 2 O 2 and NO pre-treatments could alleviate salinity-induced protein carbonylation in citrus. The authors suggested an interaction between H 2 O 2 and NO during salt stress response. Furthermore, H 2 O 2 -and NO-responsive proteins have been identified which may further reveal a protein interaction network between H 2 O 2 and NO signaling under salt stress (Tanou et al., 2010).</p>
        <p>UV-B, a key environmental signal, initiates diverse responses in plants (Jansen and Bornman, 2012).UV-B radiation can also influence plant growth, development, and productivity. It has been shown that the crosstalk between H 2 O 2 and NO could be involved in the response to UV-B stress. There was an interrelationship among Gα protein, H 2 O 2 , and NO during UV-B-induced stomatal closure in Arabidopsis leaves (He et al., 2013). This study found that there was a significant increase in H 2 O 2 or NO levels which associated with stomatal closure in the wild type by UV-B stress. However, these effects were abolished by double mutants of AtrbohD and AtrbohF or Nia1 mutants. These results strongly suggested that the crosstalk between H 2 O 2 and NO signaling might play an essential role during UV-B-induced stomatal closure in guard cells. Recently, Tossi et al. (2014) also showed a mechanism involving both H 2 O 2 and NO generation in response to UV-B exposure. Therefore, the crosstalk between H 2 O 2 and NO can regulate stomatal movement to reduce UV-B stress damage to plant cells.</p>
        <p>Cold stress adversely influences plant growth and development. Guo et al. (2014) reported that the interaction of H 2 O 2 and NO may affect cold-induced S-adenosylmethionine synthetase and increase cold tolerance through up-regulating polyamine oxidation in Medicago sativa subsp. falcate. Moreover, signaling interplay of H 2 O 2 and NO was essential for cold-induced gene expression of falcata myo-inositol phosphate synthase (MfMIPS), which improved tolerance to cold stress (Tan et al., 2013). Thus, the interaction between H 2 O 2 and NO may initiate different mechanisms to response to cold stresses.</p>
        <p>Recently, many studies have been conducted to investigate the relationship between H 2 O 2 and NO under heat stress. Li et al. (2015) reported that a signaling crosstalk between H 2 O 2 and NO may be involved in inducing thermotolerance in maize seedlings. Moreover, H 2 O 2 may be upstream signaling of NO in the heat shock pathway in Arabidopsis seedlings (Wang L. et al., 2014). In addition, treatment with low level of H 2 O 2 or NO could increase seedling viability under heat resistance (Karpets et al., 2015). These studies support the existence of crosstalk between H 2 O 2 and NO in heat responses in plants.</p>
        <p>Alberto et al. (2012) suggested that the signaling interaction between H 2 O 2 and NO was involved in alleviating copper stress of Ulva compressa through mediating antioxidant enzyme activities and activating relative gene expression. Besides, the interplay of NO and H 2 O 2 in wheat seedlings participated in regulating root growth under zinc stress and alleviated zinc stress through increasing antioxidant system, decreasing lipid peroxidation as well as up-regulating resistance gene expression (Duan et al., 2015). Obviously, the crosstalk of H 2 O 2 and NO has been found under heavy metal stress condition, which may trigger a variety of antioxidant responses in plants.</p>
        <p>As stated above, the physiological effect of H 2 O 2 and NO is similar and synergetic. In different cases, these forms of interaction are various. However, the form of H 2 O 2 and NO crosstalk depend on plant species and environmental stresses. H 2 O 2 and NO could modulate each other through regulating antioxidant enzymes activities and relative gene expression in plants. Meanwhile, H 2 O 2 and NO may synergistically regulate many common target genes which were related to signaling transduction, defense reaction, plant hormone interactions, protein transport and metabolism. Therefore, it has a significant meaning to elaborate the mechanism of the interaction between H 2 O 2 and NO in plant developmental processes and response to abiotic stresses.</p>
        <p>Ca 2+ is a widespread signaling molecule in plants. When plants receive stimuli, the change of intracellular Ca 2+ concentration may transfer signaling to regulate a series of cellular processes in plants (Kong et al., 2015;Tang et al., 2015). There are various types of Ca 2+ receptors and channels in plants such as Ca 2+ -ATPases (Pászty et al., 2015), Ca 2+ -binding sensor protein (Wagner et al., 2015), inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP 3 ;Serrano et al., 2015) and cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR, Gerasimenko et al., 2015). It is well known that Ca 2+ is involved in plant growth and development such as seed germination (Kong et al., 2015), pollen tube growth (Zhou et al., 2014), leaf de-etiolation (Huang et al., 2012), root growth and development (Liao et al., 2012a;Han et al., 2015) and other physiological processes including cell polarity regulation (Zhou et al., 2014;Himschoot et al., 2015), stomatal closure (Zou et al., 2015) and immune response (Seybold et al., 2014). Furthermore, variations in cytosolic free Ca 2+ concentration have been demonstrated to response to a wide range of environmental stresses such as heat shock (Urao et al., 1994), drought (Zou et al., 2015), light (Hu et al., 2015), salt (Tepe and Aydemir, 2015), and heavy metal (Li et al., 2016). Because of Ca 2+ has various receptors and channels in plants, it may receive different upstream signaling molecules quickly and then respond to abiotic stress.</p>
        <p>Crosstalk between H 2 O 2 and Ca 2+ occurs in plant cells (Table 5). For example, exogenous H 2 O 2 caused transiently dose-dependent increase in Ca 2+ influx in Arabidopsis thaliana root epidermis (Demidchik et al., 2007). Two Ca 2+ channels could be regulated by H 2 O 2 level in root elongation zone. Han et al. (2015) demonstrated that H 2 O 2 signaling could induce root elongation by mediating Ca 2+ influx in the plasma membrane of root cells in Arabidopsis seedlings. Richards et al. (2014) also suggested that Annexin 1, a Ca 2+ transport protein, may regulate H 2 O 2 -induced Ca 2+ signature in Arabidopsis thaliana roots to promote root growth and development. Additionally, Ca 2+ signaling was involved in H 2 O 2 -induced adventitious rooting in marigold because removal of Ca 2+ could inhibit H 2 O 2 -induced adventitious root development (Liao et al., 2012a). Interestingly, Wu et al. (2010)'s findings strongly suggested that spermidine oxidase (Spd)-derived H 2 O 2 signaling may mediate Ca 2+ influx. Spd was probably related to downstream induction of H 2 O 2 signaling and then H 2 O 2 activated Ca 2+ -permeable channels during pollen tube growth (Wu et al., 2010). Cross talk between Ca 2+ -Calmodulin (CaM) and H 2 O 2 also played a significant role in antioxidant defense in ABA signaling in maize leaves (Hu et al., 2007;</p>
        <p>Clearly, correlations also exist between H 2 O 2 and Ca 2+ in response to abiotic stresses in plants (Table 6). Shoresh et al. (2011) investigated that supplemental Ca 2+ had a significant effect on H 2 O 2 metabolism and regulating leaves and roots growth in maize under salt stress. The authors indicated that extracellular Ca 2+ may modulate endogenous H 2 O 2 levels through activating polyamine oxidase activity. Also, salt stress may induce H 2 O 2 accumulation in Ca 2+ -dependent salt resistance pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana roots (Li et al., 2011). Moreover, Lu et al. (2013) suggested that exogenous H 2 O 2 and Ca 2+ may mediate root ion fluxes in mangrove species under NaCl stress. Obviously, H 2 O 2 may interact with Ca 2+ under salt stress in plants through mediating root ion balance, increasing antioxidant enzymatic activity and upregulating the expression of related genes. Moreover, H 2 O 2 and Ca 2+ signaling were also involved in ABA responses to drought stress in Arabidopsis thaliana through Ca 2+ -dependent protein kinase8 (CPK8) which could regulate catalase3 (CAT3) activity mediating stomatal movement (Zou et al., 2015). In addition, Qiao et al. (2015) reported that a Ca 2+ -binding protein (rice annexin OsANN1) could enhance heat stress tolerance by modulating H 2 O 2 production. Over production of H 2 O 2 induced by heat stress increased OsANN1 expression and up-regulated the level of SOD and CAT expression, which constructed a signaling mechanism for stress defense in plants (Qiao et al., 2015). Until now, the signaling crosstalk between H 2 O 2 and Ca 2+ may regulate various responses to abiotic stresses in plants. It may be connected with the regulation of antioxidant system. Thus, the interaction between H 2 O 2 and Ca 2+ may increase antioxidant enzyme activities such as APX, SOD, and GR. These antioxidant enzymes may alleviate stress damages in plants. In addition, the crosstalk between H 2 O 2 and Ca 2+ could regulate gene expression level and induce protein interactions.</p>
        <p>It appears that the interrelationship between H 2 O 2 and Ca 2+ may be involved in various aspects of plant growth and development processes and abiotic stress responses. In fact, the change of Ca 2+ concentration is closely related to H 2 O 2 burst in plant cells. The combination of H 2 O 2 and Ca 2+ may play crucial roles in plants. Different plants even different parts of the same plant may have different modulation mechanisms. Thus, relationship between H 2 O 2 and Ca 2+ signaling in plants is very complex. The interplay of H 2 O 2 , Ca 2+ and its mechanism need to be illustrated clearly in the future.</p>
        <p>It has been suggested that there is a connection among H 2 O 2 , NO,and Ca 2+ in plants. H 2 O 2 , NO, and Ca 2+ may act as essential signaling molecules which may form a complex signaling network to regulate different developmental and physiological processes in plants (Figure 3). For instance, during adventitious rooting of mung bean, Ca 2+ signaling played a pivotal role and functioned as a downstream molecule of H 2 O 2 and NO signal pathway (Li and Xue, 2010; Figure 3). Similarly, there is a possible relationship among H 2 O 2, NO and Ca 2+ /CaM during adventitious rooting in marigold explants (Liao et al., 2012a). The authors found that exogenous NO and H 2 O 2 promoted adventitious root development in marigold explants through increasing endogenous Ca 2+ and CaM levels. Moreover, H 2 O 2 , NO and Ca 2+ were also involved in oligochitosan-induced programmed cell death in tobacco suspension cells (Zhang et al., 2012). Pharmacological experiments revealed that Ca 2+ signaling induced NO accumulation through inducing H 2 O 2 generation during stomatal closure in Arabidopsis guard cells (Li et al., 2009). Furthermore, Wang et al. (2011) suggested a functional correlationship among H 2 O 2 , calcium-sensing receptor (CAS) and NO in Ca 2+ -dependent guard cell signaling. It was shown that CAS may transduce Ca 2+ signaling through activating its downstream target NO and H 2 O 2 signaling pathway (Wang et al., 2011). Therefore, it is thus clear that the interplay of H 2 O 2 , NO, and Ca 2+ may have an significant effect on plant growth and physiological processes through promoting cell proliferation, controlling cell metabolism, meanwhile, regulating modes of cell death. Moreover, Vandelle et al. (2006) has reported that NO and H 2 O 2 synthesis could also act upstream to increase cytosolic Ca 2+ concentration during hypersensitive response (HR) through activating plasma membrane-and intracellular membrane-associated Ca 2+ channels. Besides, the interaction among H 2 O 2 , NO, and Ca 2+ signaling may regulate ABA-induced antioxidant defense in maize (Ma et al., 2012). Obviously, the mutual effect among H 2 O 2 , NO and Ca 2+ Furthermore, the interplay among H 2 O 2 , NO, and Ca 2+ also have an effect on abiotic stress response in plants. For example, Lang et al. (2014) reported that NO likely interacted with Ca 2+ and H 2 O 2 in Aegiceras corniculatum to up-regulate Na + /H + antiport system of plasma membrane under salt stress. There were species-specific interactions between H 2 O 2 , Ca 2+ , NO, and ATP in salt-induced reduction of K + efflux (Lang et al., 2014). Moreover, there was a crosstalk among H 2 O 2 , NO, and Ca 2+ when Ulva compressa exposed to copper excess and the interaction had a significant effect on transcriptional activation of target genes (Alberto et al., 2012). The H 2 O 2induced NO generation could be inhibited by Ca 2+ channel blockers, implicating that Ca 2+ may mediate the effect of H 2 O 2 on NO production. Furthermore, Ca 2+ release through different type of Ca 2+ channels was also shown to be activated by NO and H 2 O 2 (Alberto et al., 2012; Figure 3). The interrelationship between H 2 O 2 , NO and Ca 2+ may provide additional layers of responses to abiotic stresses through controlling ion transport, increasing antioxidant enzyme activities and affecting expression of resistance genes, indicating a feedback mechanism between H 2 O 2 , NO and Ca 2+ under abiotic stresses. In a word, the combination of these findings strongly supports the view that there has an interaction among H 2 O 2 , NO, and Ca 2+ signaling pathway in plant growth, development and abiotic stress responses. During signaling transduction, Ca 2+ signaling could be activated by H 2 O 2 and NO; it could also regulate H 2 O 2 and NO signaling. Ca 2+ may act as a point of signaling convergence between H 2 O 2 and NO signaling pathways in plants. However, the network of H 2 O 2 , NO, and Ca 2+ seems to be intricate and multidimensional. Therefore, considerably more work will need to be done to determine the interaction among H 2 O 2 , NO and Ca 2+ signaling in plants.</p>
        <p>H 2 O 2 was once considered as a poisonous molecule in plants. Based on current studies, H 2 O 2 may be a vital signaling molecule which controls plant growth and development. Interestingly, NO and Ca 2+ which also act as the key component of signaling transduction in plants seem to be as upstream or downstream signaling molecules of H 2 O 2 . Meanwhile, H 2 O 2 modulates NO and Ca 2+ signaling pathways. There is a complex interactive network among H 2 O 2 , NO, and Ca 2+ in plants. Moreover, the interplay among them has functional implications for regulating developmental and physiological processes which may increase the possibility of signal reception and transduction in plants. Future work will need to focus on the molecular mechanism of the interplay among H 2 O 2 , NO, and Ca 2+ during signaling transduction in plants.</p>
