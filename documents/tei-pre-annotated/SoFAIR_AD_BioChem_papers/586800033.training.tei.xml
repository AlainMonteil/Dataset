        <p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease worldwide [1,2]. NAFLD ranges from simple steatosis without inflammation to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which, in some cases, can lead to cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma [1,2]. Despite its high prevalence and morbidity, there is currently no approved therapy for NAFLD/NASH.Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease worldwide [1,2].

        <p>Higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes (DMT2) has been documented among NAFLD and NASH patients, while NAFLD also markedly increases the risk of developing DMT2 [3]. NAFLD and DMT2 share common pathophysiologic features, with insulin resistance playing a key pathogenic role [4]. As such, anti-diabetic drugs (e.g., metformin, thiazolidinediones and GLP-1 analogues) have been studied as potential treatments against NAFLD/NASH development and progression [5,6]. Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) represent a new class of anti-diabetic drugs which act mainly through increasing urinary glucose excretion and, thus, improve glucose control independently of insulin secretion [7]. In addition to glucose reduction, SGLT-2i has also been shown to exert certain beneficial cardio-metabolic effects, including weight reduction and cardiovascular disease (CVD) protection [8][9][10].Higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes (DMT2) has been documented among NAFLD and NASH patients, while NAFLD also markedly increases the risk of developing DMT2 [3].

        <p>Recently, a number of randomized and non-randomized clinical trials have reported beneficial effects of SGLT-2i on NAFLD, as assessed either by surrogate biomarkers/indices (e.g., alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT), triglycerides, hepatic insulin sensitivity indices), or by intrahepatic fat content on CT, MRI and proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging [6,11]. Of note, a recent large, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, i.e., the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, further supported these results, showing that empagliflozin treatment for 24 weeks in patients with DMT2 significantly reduced glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) levels (a surrogate biomarker of liver fat) independently of changes in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and body weight [12]. Interestingly, this improvement was more pronounced in the empagliflozin-treated arm compared to glimepiride, suggesting direct empagliflozininduced effects on NAFLD progression, irrespective of glycemic control [12]. The E-LIFT trial also showed that treatment with empagliflozin (10 mg daily) for 20 weeks significantly reduced liver enzymes and liver fat in in 50 patients with DMT2 and NAFLD [13]. Although such data indicate that SGLT-2i may constitute a promising treatment option against NAFLD/NASH, the molecular mechanisms mediating the beneficial effects of SGLT-2i on biochemical and/or histological NAFLD features remain incompletely explored.Recently, a number of randomized and non-randomized clinical trials have reported beneficial effects of SGLT-2i on NAFLD, as assessed either by surrogate biomarkers/indices (e.g., alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT), triglycerides, hepatic insulin sensitivity indices), or by intrahepatic fat content on CT, MRI and proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging [6,11].

        <p>Recently, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy have emerged as important underlying mechanisms in NAFLD/NASH development and progression, both regulating hepatic cell apoptosis [14,15]. Indeed, it is now well-known that both hyperglycaemia and lipid accumulation can cause proteostasis and trigger ER stress in hepatocytes [16]. In turn, an adaptive signalling pathway, i.e., the unfolded protein response (UPR), is activated to restore it [16]. To that effect, UPR enhances ER protein folding and induces clearance of aggregate-prone proteins by promoting autophagy. Subsequently, autophagy stimulates the degradation of intracellular lipid droplets (lipophagy). However, under chronic ER stress the UPR turns from adaptive to terminal, leading to hepatocyte death by increasing inflammation, reducing autophagic processes and activating pro-apoptotic pathways [17].Recently, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy have emerged as important underlying mechanisms in NAFLD/NASH development and progression, both regulating hepatic cell apoptosis [14,15].

        <p>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (Ppar-γ) is a known regulator of de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and its upregulation leads to the consequent lipid droplets deposition within hepatocytes. The Srebp1c plays a central role in controlling expression of genes involved in DNL such as Acaca, Fasn and Scd-1.

Indeed, both ApoE (-/-) mice groups consumed similar amounts of food and gained weight without significant differences between them during the five-week treatment period of our study. This is in accord with previous studies from our group which also showed that canagliflozin and empagliflozin administration for 5 and 10 weeks, respectively, did not promote weight loss in ApoE deficient mice under HFD conditions [9,10]. Interestingly, conflicting results exist in the relevant literature with respect to SGLT-2i effects on body weight in animal models. As such, previous studies have showed that empagliflozin did not affect significantly the body weight of Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats (a type 2 diabetes animal model) at doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, whereas it can decrease the body weight in ApoE (-/-) mice at a dose of 1-3 mg/kg/day for eight weeks [32,33].

        <p>In addition to lowering fasting blood glucose levels, our data further show that in HFD-fed ApoE (-/-) mice empagliflozin can also reduce total cholesterol and triglyceride serum levels over a five-week treatment period. This is in agreement with previous studies from our group and others conducted in various animal models (e.g., ob/ob or wild type mice) and with varying treatment regimens, which showed similar empagliflozin-induced effects on fasting lipid profiles [9,34]. Moreover, in line with our findings, recent studies demonstrated that administration of empagliflozin for 5 and 10 weeks at a dose of 10 mg/jg and 1.5 mg/jg/day, results in significantly reduced serum SGPT levels of HFD-fed male C57BL/6 and ob/ob (-/-) mice, respectively [21,34].In addition to lowering fasting blood glucose levels, our data further show that in HFD-fed ApoE (-/-) mice empagliflozin can also reduce total cholesterol and triglyceride serum levels over a five-week treatment period.

        <p>It must be highlighted that, histological findings in the context of the present study showed a marked reduction of liver steatosis, lobular inflammation, ballooning and hepatocellular degeneration in the empagliflozin-treated group, resulting in significantly improved NAS compared to the control group. Similar improvements in hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis have also been reported in other animal studies with administration of different SGLT-2i, including luseogliflozin, empagliflozin, remogliflozin, ipragliflozin and NGI001 [21,[23][24][25][26][27]. Based on these studies, key mechanisms which appear to mediate these effects involve mainly the regulation of insulin resistance/glucose tolerance and changes in the expression of enzymes implicated in beta-oxidation and hepatic de novo lipogenesis [21,[23][24][25][26][27]. In line with most of these studies, we found a reduction in the expression of six key-enzymes of lipogenesis which was more pronounced for Screbp-1c, Fasn and pck-1.

        <p>The reduction of lipogenesis enzymes following empagliflozin administration could explain-at least in part-the decreased steatosis and fatty droplets area observed within hepatocytes. Accordingly, we found a decreased expression of inflammatory markers, such as Mcp-1 and F4/80, and to a lesser extent TNF-α and IL-6, with empagliflozin treatment. The decrease in the expression of the aforementioned inflammatory indices has been shown to reduce macrophage infiltration and lobar inflammation in liver leading to alleviation of hepatic steatosis and inflammation [21,23,24,26].The reduction of lipogenesis enzymes following empagliflozin administration could explain-at least in part-the decreased steatosis and fatty droplets area observed within hepatocytes.

        <p>Notably, the present study further expanded on the mechanisms underlying such empagliflozin-induced beneficial effects on NAFLD/NASH, focusing on the gene and protein hepatic expression of factors involved in ER stress, autophagy and apoptosis which are crucial processes implicated in NAFLD development and progression [35][36][37][38][39]. Indeed, it is now well-established that under normal (unstressed) conditions, IRE1, PERK and ATF6 are inactivated upon binding to GRP78/BiP, whereas under stress conditions GRP-78/BiP dissociates from the ER stress sensors, thus activating the three arms of the UPR [37]. Here, we found reduced expression of GRP78/BiP in the liver of the empagliflozin-treated ApoE (-/-) mice compared to control. Overall, existing data regarding GRP78/BiP expression in NAFLD are conflicting [35,36]. Of note, Jo et al. [40] showed that tunicamycin, which can induce liver steatosis, increases GRP78/BiP expression. Moreover, dietary-induced obese mice have been shown to express higher hepatic GRP78/BiP levels compared to lean counterparts [41]. It might be expected here that, since GRP78 is a chaperone responsive to glucose, empagliflozin should decrease its expression through reducing glucose levels. However, using liver tissue from obese mice and cultured rat liver cells, Ozcan et al. found that hyperglycemia did not induce GRP78 expression, suggesting that its regulation is not likely related, at least exclusively, to glycemia [41].Notably, the present study further expanded on the mechanisms underlying such empagliflozin-induced beneficial effects on NAFLD/NASH, focusing on the gene and protein hepatic expression of factors involved in ER stress, autophagy and apoptosis which are crucial processes implicated in NAFLD development and progression [35][36][37][38][39].

        <p>Moreover, we showed here that the three branches of the UPR adaptive pathway, i.e., PERK, IRE1a and ATF6, were attenuated in the liver tissues of the empagliflozin-treated group compared to control. Specifically, we noted suppression of the PERK-elf2a-ATF4 arm in the liver, as indicated by the decreased phosphorylation of the elf protein and decreased mRNA expression of the transcription factor ATF4. Notably, this pathway is known to regulate lipogenesis and steatosis with ATF4-deficient mice exhibiting decreased synthesis of fatty acids and lower triglyceride serum levels [14].Moreover, we showed here that the three branches of the UPR adaptive pathway, i.e., PERK, IRE1a and ATF6, were attenuated in the liver tissues of the empagliflozin-treated group compared to control.

        <p>Furthermore, our results revealed suppression of the IRE1a pathway in the empagliflozintreated group, as indicated by the decreased mRNA expression of both IRE1a, and Xbp1 which is the transcription factor activated by IRE1a. The IRE1a pathway is also an important regulator of hepatic lipogenesis. Indeed, Xbp1 ablation has been reported to ameliorate liver steatosis and injury, as well as hyperlipidemia in ApoE (-/-) mice [42]. Lee et al. showed that selective deletion of Xbp1 in the liver led to decreased hepatic production of lipids through down regulation of critical lipogenic genes, such as Scd-1, diacyl glycerol acetyltransferase 2 (Dgat2) and acetyl coA carboxylase 2 (Acc2), and subsequently to marked hypocholesterolemia and hypotriglyceridemia [43]. Recently, it has been shown that activation of UPR-IRE-Xbp-1 can trigger activation of the Srebp-1c signalling pathway, leading to increased liver steatosis [44]. Therefore, the decreased activation of both PERK-elf2a-ATF4 and IRE1a-Xbp1 pathways could substantially contribute to the lower total cholesterol and triglyceride serum levels noted with empagliflozin treatment. Similarly, our findings further show that ATF6 expression is also reduced in the liver of the empagliflozintreated ApoE (-/-) mice compared to control. A recent study by Chen et al. also showed that down-regulation of the ATF6 signalling pathway alleviates the progression of NAFLD by inhibiting ER stress-induced inflammation and apoptosis of liver cells [45].Furthermore, our results revealed suppression of the IRE1a pathway in the empagliflozintreated group, as indicated by the decreased mRNA expression of both IRE1a, and Xbp1 which is the transcription factor activated by IRE1a.

        <p>Interestingly, ATF4, Xbp1 and ATF6 pathways are known to activate UPR target genes implicated in autophagy and apoptosis through regulating CHOP [14]. In our study, the applied five-week empagliflozin treatment resulted in lower mRNA and protein CHOP levels compared to controls. Currently, there are only a few studies exhibiting beneficial effects of SGLT-2i (dapagliflozin and ipragliflozin) on ER stress markers, mostly relating to renal tubular cell inflammation injury in diabetic mice [19,20]. Empagliflozin has also been found to induce a protective effect against diabetic cardiomyopathy by inhibiting IRE1a-Xbp1 and ATF4-CHOP pathways [46], whilst it can also improve β-cell mass in streptozotocin-treated mice through down-regulation of Xbp1, BiP and ATF4 [18]. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one previous study investigating the effects of empagliflozin on ER stress in a diet-induced NAFLD mice model [21]. Indeed, in accord with our findings, Petito da Silva et al. have shown that empagliflozin can mitigate NAFLD development by reducing the expression of genes involved in the elf2α-ATF4-CHOP-GADD45 pathway of UPR activation [21].Interestingly, ATF4, Xbp1 and ATF6 pathways are known to activate UPR target genes implicated in autophagy and apoptosis through regulating CHOP [14].

        <p>As ER stress is a well-established regulator of autophagy via mainly ATF4 and Xbp-1 [17] it is also important to explore autophagic processes in the context of NAFLD. Autophagy breaks down, among others, the intracellular lipids in hepatocytes through a degradation pathway known as lipophagy [20]. Moreover, impaired autophagic flux in the liver is closely related to the development of hepatic steatosis [47]. Overall, the process of autophagosome formation involves three major steps, namely initiation which is mediated by AMPK activation; nucleation with the Beclin-1/class III PI3K complex; and elongation of the isolation membrane with the help of LC3 lipidation [47]. As such, we investigated the effect of empagliflozin on these autophagic processes. Although we noted no significant increase in the mRNA expression of both isoforms of the catalytic subunit of AMPK (AMPKa1 and AMPKa2), our findings demonstrate increased phosphorylation at the N-terminus of the a subunit (Thr172) of AMPK in the liver of empagliflozin-treated ApoE (-/-) mice. The latter is required for full activation of AMPK. In line with our findings, a recent study by Xu et al. reported that administration of empagliflozin for 16 weeks in HFD-induced obese mice increased the phosphorylation of AMPK [48].As ER stress is a well-established regulator of autophagy via mainly ATF4 and Xbp-1 [17] it is also important to explore autophagic processes in the context of NAFLD.

        <p>It is known that activated AMPK promotes autophagy through various mechanisms, including negative regulation of mTORC1 [49]. Interestingly, we found decreased mTOR mRNA expression with empagliflozin treatment, and increased Beclin-1 protein levels which promote the step of nucleation. Furthermore, out data indicate that empagliflozin upregulates the expression of LC3B (both at mRNA and protein level) which is also necessary for the autophagosome formation. In addition, we assessed liver P62/SQSTM1 protein levels which is a selective substrate of autophagy, usually used as an index of impaired autophagic flux [50]. P62/SQSTM1 protein levels were lower in the empagliflozintreated mice of our study, indicating activation of autophagic flux by this SGLT-2i. It could be argued that the effects of empagliflozin can be attributed primarily to the decrease in glucose levels which could activate the energy-sensor AMPK, causing, in turn, the mTOR-mediated inhibition of autophagy. However, the noted glucose level decrease was not to a degree that can trigger this AMPK-induced mechanism, which is mainly activated under starvation conditions [51].It is known that activated AMPK promotes autophagy through various mechanisms, including negative regulation of mTORC1 [49].

        <p>Of note, these findings appear to partly contradict the existing knowledge that decreased ER stress leads to a diminished autophagy [52]. However, it should be noted that SGLT-2i has been found to primarily induce autophagy by a mechanism which has not been fully clarified. Indeed, in the myocardium and immune cells SGLT-2i appear to promote a state that resembles nutrient and oxygen deprivation [53,54]. This state can trigger -among other pathways-AMPK activation which is a main regulator of autophagy [55]. Similarly, compared to control, higher AMPK phosphorylation in the liver of empagliflozin-treated ApoE (-/-) mice was also noted in our study. Additional studies are still required to fully clarify the SGLT-2i-induced effects on autophagy in the liver and other tissues.Of note, these findings appear to partly contradict the existing knowledge that decreased ER stress leads to a diminished autophagy [52].

        <p>Considering that both ER stress and autophagy can eventually regulate apoptosis, here we also investigated the effect of empagliflozin in hepatic apoptosis processes, showing that empagliflozin treatment leads to higher Bcl-2/Bax ratio and inactivated caspase-8 in the liver of HFD-fed ApoE (-/-) mice. The former is a well-known apoptosis switch, with a progressive reduction of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio having been reported during the progression of NAFLD to NASH which correlates to the apoptosis percentage of hepatocytes [56]. Of interest, CHOP, which according to our results was lower with empagliflozin treatment, has been shown to inhibit Bcl-2 and up-regulate Bax, thus triggering the intrinsic apoptotic pathway [57].Considering that both ER stress and autophagy can eventually regulate apoptosis, here we also investigated the effect of empagliflozin in hepatic apoptosis processes, showing that empagliflozin treatment leads to higher Bcl-2/Bax ratio and inactivated caspase-8 in the liver of HFD-fed ApoE (-/-) mice.

        <p>Similarly, the lower hepatic caspase-8 cleavage levels we noted in empagliflozintreated mice compared to control have also important implications for apoptotic pathways, since activated caspase-8 is required for extrinsic apoptosis and plays a crucial role in Free fatty acid (FFA)-mediated apoptosis in hepatocytes [58]. Interestingly, hepatocytespecific caspase-8 knockout mice fed a methionine choline-deficient diet (a frequentlyused nutritional NASH model) have been shown to exhibit decreased apoptosis and inflammatory processes [59].Similarly, the lower hepatic caspase-8 cleavage levels we noted in empagliflozintreated mice compared to control have also important implications for apoptotic pathways, since activated caspase-8 is required for extrinsic apoptosis and plays a crucial role in Free fatty acid (FFA)-mediated apoptosis in hepatocytes [58].

Of note, SQSTM1/p62 is not only an autophagy-specific substrate, but, when is abnormally accumulated, it can also stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activate the DNA damage response [60]. As such, our results suggest that activation of autophagy by empagliflozin could directly inhibit hepatic apoptosis by both decreasing caspase-8 activation and eliminating SQSTM1/p62. However, the diminished ER stress (in particular the atten-uation of PERK-elfa-ATF-4-CHOP pathway) could also mediate the decreased activation of caspase-8 [61]. The relative contribution of each of these pathways remains unclear and requires further study.Autophagy could also inhibit apoptosis via elimination ofp62/SQSTM1, which was found to be lower in the empagliflozin-treated mice of the present study.

        <p>In addition, the reduced ER stress via CHOP could also directly inhibit apoptosis through increasing the Bcl-2/Bax ratio. Thus, it can be hypothesized that a potent autophagic flux due to empagliflozin treatment may attenuate the adaptive HFD-induced ER stress of hepatocytes, in a negative feedback loop. As such, both increased autophagy and reduced ER stress could eliminate hepatic apoptosis and alleviate NAFLD progression. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that autophagy can reduce ER stress, and so it can act protectively by inhibiting apoptosis through caspase inactivation [62]. Of further interest, a study by Zhou et al. in HFD-fed mice showed that inhibition of Scd-1 (a key enzyme in lipid metabolism) enhanced AMPK activity and autophagy (lipophagy), leading to decreased hepatic steatosis [63]. Emphasizing the role of AMPK in hepatic lipogenesis, another recent study documented that AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of insulin-induced gene (Insig) can prevent the activation of Srebp-1c and, consequently, its lipogenic enzymes which regulate triglyceride and fatty acid synthesis, including ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), ACC1 and DGAT2 [64]. It becomes evident that, whether empagliflozin can act directly on AMPK which can initiate autophagy and regulate de novo lipogenesis, or on other molecules upstream of AMPK (e.g., Scd-1) remains to be further explored.In addition, the reduced ER stress via CHOP could also directly inhibit apoptosis through increasing the Bcl-2/Bax ratio.

        <p>Finally, in support of our hypothesis that empagliflozin-triggered increased autophagy can decrease ER stress-induced NAFLD progression, Carloni et al. have demonstrated that rapamycin-induced autophagy inhibits ischemia-induced ER stress, thus protecting against brain injury [65,66]. In this context, administration of 3-methyadenine (an autophagy inhibitor) reversed this beneficial effect and accelerated the ER stress-induced neuronal death [65,66].Finally, in support of our hypothesis that empagliflozin-triggered increased autophagy can decrease ER stress-induced NAFLD progression, Carloni et al. have demonstrated that rapamycin-induced autophagy inhibits ischemia-induced ER stress, thus protecting against brain injury [65,66].

        <p>Whether the effects of empagliflozin on autophagy, ER stress and apoptosis are mediated directly through SGLT-2 inhibition in the liver tissue is a matter of great scientific interest. According to our data, SGLT-2 was low-expressed in half of the liver samples, without differences in the expression between the control group and Empa group. Interestingly, Obara et al. demonstrated the protein expression of SGLT-2 in human hepatocytes and hepatoma cell lines [67]. More interestingly, SGLT-1 was expressed in the total of the liver tissues (both control and intervention group) suggesting its possible role in the attenuation of NAFLD in our model. Of note, empagliflozin can also bind to SGLT-1, albeit with a lower affinity than SGLT-2; strengthening the suggestion that empagliflozin could act, among others, through SGLT-1, dual SGLT-1/SGLT-2 inhibitor phlorizin recently found to ameliorate NAFLD in Type 2 diabetic mice [68]. Nevertheless, the existence of other, unknown yet, protein(s) which could be a direct target of empagliflozin in hepatocytes cannot be excluded.Whether the effects of empagliflozin on autophagy, ER stress and apoptosis are mediated directly through SGLT-2 inhibition in the liver tissue is a matter of great scientific interest.

        <p>Expanding on our previous data [9], we also demonstrated that empagliflozin results in the reduction of pro-atherogenesis markers in aorta, including inflammatory markers (Il-6, Tnf-α), adhesion molecules (Vcam-1) and gelatinolytic activity (Timp-1/Mmp-2 ratio), although no significant effect on atheroma plaque formation is present at the end of this five-week treatment period (Supplementary Data S1). This is in line with results which we have previously shown, where empagliflozin administered for 10 weeks in ApoE (-/-) mice attenuates the progression of atherosclerotic plaque [9]. Notably, the strong bidirectional relationship between NAFLD and CVD is well established. Indeed, Kim et al. recently showed that NAFLD has prognostic value for identifying individuals who are at higher risk for CVD [69].Expanding on our previous data [9], we also demonstrated that empagliflozin results in the reduction of pro-atherogenesis markers in aorta, including inflammatory markers (Il-6, Tnf-α), adhesion molecules (Vcam-1) and gelatinolytic activity (Timp-1/Mmp-2 ratio), although no significant effect on atheroma plaque formation is present at the end of this five-week treatment period (Supplementary Data S1).

        <p>A limitation of our study is the lack of body composition assessments of the studied mice.

At five weeks of age, all mice were switched to a high-fat diet (HFD: 20-23% by weight; 40-45% kcal from fat), containing cholesterol (0.2% total). After five weeks on this HFD, the ApoE (-/-) mice were randomly divided into the following two groups: (1) Empagliflozin group (10 mg/kg/day empagliflozin, n = 8), and (2) control group (same volume of 0.5% hydroxyl ethylcellulose per day, n = 8). Empagliflozin or vehicle was administered orally by gavage daily for a period of five weeks. Empagliflozin was purchased from MCE (Cat.No.HY-15409) and dissolved in 0.5% hydroxyl ethylcellulose. During the five-week study treatment, food intake and body weight were measured once weekly. Blood glucose levels were also measured after 8-10 h fasting via tail puncture at baseline (before empagliflozin/vehicle oral administration), and at the study endpoint.

Briefly, whole protein was extracted from 60 mg of liver tissue using 2× lysis buffer (Cell Signalling Technology, MA, USA) supplemented with PMSF. Samples containing 30 µg of protein were resolved by electrophoresis gels and transferred to a PVDF membrane. After blocking for 1 h with 5% skim milk in TBST, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 • C with antibodies against βactin (MAB1501 Millipore), LC3B (L7543 Sigma), Beclin-1 (G-11 Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p62 (D-3 Santa Cruz Biotechnology), AMPK (#5831 Cell Signalling), phospho-AMPK (#2531 Cell Signaling), CHOP/GADD153 (H5-Santa Cruz Biotechnology), eIF2a (#9722 Cell Signaling), phospho-eIF2a (Ser51) (#9721 Cell Signalling) and cleaved caspase-8 (Asp387) (#8592 Cell Signalling). Membranes were then probed with goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (31430, Thermo Scientific) or with goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP conjugate (12-348, Millipore) secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. An aliquot of pooled standard sample was loaded in one lane of each gel. The pooled sample served as an internal standard to minimize the inter-assay variation for samples run in different gels.
