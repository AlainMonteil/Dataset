        <p>CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, ponesimod was superior to teriflunomide on annualized relapse rate reduction, fatigue, magnetic resonance imaging activity, brain volume loss, and no evidence of disease activity status, but not confirmed disability accumulation. The safety profile was in line with the previous safety observations with ponesimod and the known profile of other S1P receptor modulators.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, ponesimod was superior to teriflunomide on annualized relapse rate reduction, fatigue, magnetic resonance imaging activity, brain volume loss, and no evidence of disease activity status, but not confirmed disability accumulation.

        <p>ultiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, is clinically perceived by relapses and progressive loss of neurological function, primarily attributed to inflammatory attacks leading to demyelination, axonal loss, and gliosis culminating in long-term multifocal sclerotic plaques in the brain and spinal cord. [1][2][3] Oral disease-modifying therapy (DMT) options such as teriflunomide, 4,5 fingolimod, 6 dimethyl fumarate, 7,8 and siponimod 9 have broadened disease management options in MS. Despite significant progress in MS therapy, there is still an unmet need for effective, safe, and convenient treatments that can be used early in the disease course. [10][11][12] Given the number of alternative options of oral treatments, head-to-head comparative trials to inform choices are still lacking. 13 Ponesimod is an orally active, highly selective modulator of the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P 1 ) with no active metabolites and is thus a limited potential for drug-drug interaction. 14 Ponesimod induces a rapid, dose-dependent, and reversible reduction of peripheral blood lymphocyte counts by blocking the egress of lymphocytes from lymphoid organs. 15,16 Rapid elimination of ponesimod and the reversibility of its effects on lymphocyte levels allows the rapid return of normal immune system function, which may be beneficial in terms of safety for pregnancy planning, serious infections, or vaccinations. 17,18 In a randomized, placebo-controlled, dosefinding phase 2 study 19 in patients with relapsing MS (RMS), among doses tested (10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg), the 20-mg dose was found to significantly reduce both the cumulative number of new gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) T1 lesions and new or enlarging T2 lesions compared with placebo.ultiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, is clinically perceived by relapses and progressive loss of neurological function, primarily attributed to inflammatory attacks leading to demyelination, axonal loss, and gliosis culminating in long-term multifocal sclerotic plaques in the brain and spinal cord.

Despite the well-known negative implications on quality of life and the high socioeconomic burden associated with fatigue, 21,[28][29][30] no previous phase 3 study in MS has addressed fatigue prospectively as a key outcome. This may have been partially because of the poor sensitivity and specificity of the currently available patient-reported outcomes used for the assessment of fatigue. In this study, fatigue was assessed using a validated patient-reported outcome measure specifically developed to assess fatigue in patients with RMS, the FSIQ-RMS scale. 21 However, no statistically significant difference was seen in the outcome on the predefined key secondary outcome, 12week CDA. Baseline EDSS scores (mean, 2.6) and the proportion of patients with EDSS scores of 3.5 or less (83.5%) are indicative of a relatively low level of disability, and few 12-week CDA events were observed in both the ponesimod and teriflunomide groups, leading to a limitation in the ability to detect significant differences between treatment groups. This low rate of CDA in both arms and the fact that teriflunomide is the only approved oral DMT for RMS to demonstrate a significant benefit on 12-week confirmed disability progression vs placebo in 2 separate pivotal trials in relapsing-remitting MS 4,5 suggests that OPTIMUM was underpowered to detect a difference within the 2-year treatment period.

In accordance with ponesimod's effects on the individual outcome measures, a higher proportion of patients receiving ponesimod remained free of disease activity, both after applying the 3 established criteria for NEDA-3 (no relapse, no confirmed disease worsening, and no new or enlarging MRI lesions) and after adding the criterion of no brain volume change in excess of the upper limit obtained in healthy controls (NEDA-4). 24,25 Treatment discontinuation rates were similar in the 2 treatment groups. These were at the lower end compared with frequencies reported in other phase 3 studies in relapsing MS. 4,[6][7][8][35][36][37] More patients in the teriflunomide group discontinued treatment because of reasons of efficacy, consistent with the greater benefit of ponesimod observed across multiple efficacy end points, whereas discontinuations attributable to adverse events or tolerability were more frequent in the ponesimod group. Treatment discontinuations attributed to adverse events in the ponesimod group were mainly by protocolmandated, study-specific discontinuation criteria associated with anticipated S1P 1 modulator class effects on the respiratory system and macular edema and protocol-mandated study specific discontinuation criteria.ponesimod on fatigue and the reduction of brain volume loss, shown against a drug with an established effect on brain volume loss, 34 suggests that ponesimod's benefits are not restricted to suppressing relapses and focal lesions reflecting short-term events in the pathogenesis of MS but extend to the prevention of tissue damage accumulation.

None of these day 1 events was reported as serious or leading to treatment discontinuation. The higher proportion of patients meeting cutoff cri-teria for liver abnormalities observed in OPTIMUM, compared with the phase 2 ponesimod study, was likely because of the more conservative definition of ULN, along with more frequent testing.

        <p>In conclusion, OPTIMUM, as the first (to our knowledge) phase 3 study comparing 2 oral DMTs in RMS, showed that ponesimod is superior to teriflunomide, an approved oral DMT, on the primary end point, ARR, and also on 2 of 3 secondary end points: MRI activity and fatigue, a most debilitating MS symptom that until now appears not to have been shown in a prospective phase 3 study to be effectively addressed by other DMTs. Superiority of ponesimod was also shown on the exploratory end points of brain volume loss and NEDA status. Ponesimod was well tolerated, and the safety results were in line with previous observations in its phase 2 dose-finding study 19 and findings on other S1P receptor modulators in controlled studies, 39 including their extensions and postmarketing observations.In conclusion, OPTIMUM, as the first (to our knowledge) phase 3 study comparing 2 oral DMTs in RMS, showed that ponesimod is superior to teriflunomide, an approved oral DMT, on the primary end point, ARR, and also on 2 of 3 secondary end points: MRI activity and fatigue, a most debilitating MS symptom that until now appears not to have been shown in a prospective phase 3 study to be effectively addressed by other DMTs.
