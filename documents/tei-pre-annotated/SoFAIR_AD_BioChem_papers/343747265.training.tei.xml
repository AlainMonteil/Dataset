        <p>The contribution of inflammation to the chronic joint disease osteoarthritis (OA) is unclear, and this lack of clarity is detrimental to efforts to identify therapeutic targets. Here we show that chondrocytes under inflammatory conditions undergo a metabolic shift that is regulated by NF-κB activation, leading to reprogramming of cell metabolism towards glycolysis and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). Inflammation and metabolism can reciprocally modulate each other to regulate cartilage degradation. LDHA binds to NADH and promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce catabolic changes through stabilization of IκB-ζ, a critical pro-inflammatory mediator in chondrocytes. IκB-ζ is regulated bi-modally at the stages of transcription and protein degradation. Overall, this work highlights the function of NF-κB activity in the OA joint as well as a ROS promoting function for LDHA and identifies LDHA as a potential therapeutic target for OA treatment.The contribution of inflammation to the chronic joint disease osteoarthritis (OA) is unclear, and this lack of clarity is detrimental to efforts to identify therapeutic targets.

        <p>O steoarthritis (OA), a degenerative disease of the joint, is the most prevalent musculoskeletal disorder affecting over 50 million in the United States and 200 cases per 100,000 individuals globally, and the leading cause of disability [1][2][3][4] . However, despite its prevalence and severity, there are no curative or effective disease-modifying treatments for OA owing to poor understanding of disease pathogenesis. In healthy joints, mechanical loading and biochemical cues maintain articular homeostasis via a balance between chondrocyte synthesis of anabolic factors like type II collagen and aggrecan, and catabolic factors like matrix metalloprotease 13 (MMP13) and A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) 5,6 . Since extracellular anabolic matrix molecules are extremely stable, reduction of catabolic enzymes may be sufficient to inhibit OA disease progression, especially at early stages of disease 7 . Several studies have shown that both the synovial fluid and serum of OA patients have elevated levels of proinflammatory mediators such as interleukin (IL)-1β [8][9][10] that drive the production of catabolic degradative enzymes in chondrocytes 11,12 . Mechanistically, many inflammatory stimuli converge upon the NF-κB pathway, considered the gatekeeper of the inflammatory response in cells 13,14 . Thus, activation of NF-κB is proposed to play a key role in OA progression by promoting the expression of cartilage degrading genes and chondrocyte dysfunction, though the mechanisms by which pathologic activation of NF-κB induces joint catabolism in OA are obscure.O steoarthritis (OA), a degenerative disease of the joint, is the most prevalent musculoskeletal disorder affecting over 50 million in the United States and 200 cases per 100,000 individuals globally, and the leading cause of disability [1][2][3][4] .

        <p>Energy metabolism is an extremely important mediator of cellular function often altered during disease states, especially under chronic inflammatory conditions. It has been shown that chondrocytes in OA cartilage undergo metabolic changes though the role of these changes in disease pathology is unclear [15][16][17][18][19] . Furthermore, recent work has indicated that chondrocytes can undergo metabolic changes in response to various stimuli 23,25,26 . Chondrocytes in vivo are proposed to rely heavily upon glycolysis, with lower energy production coming from oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) due to the relatively hypoxic environment they reside within 18 . Glycolysis, which is oxygen-independent, generates ATP quickly but inefficiently, while TCA cycle and electron transport chain (ETC) are extremely efficient at energy production through OxPhos when oxygen is available, though most cells during physiological conditions take advantage of a combination of glycolysis and OxPhos 20 . However, stressed cells, such as immune and cancer cells, paradoxically utilize glycolysis and fermentation to generate ATP even in the presence of oxygen, i.e., aerobic glycolysis [21][22][23] . This altered cellular metabolism is not only important for energy homeostasis, but likely critical for altered cellular function and signaling [24][25][26] . We propose that inflammation-driven metabolic reprogramming is important for sustaining and driving inflammatory response pathways in chondrocytes, a paradigm for understanding their co-regulation and relationship to disease.Energy metabolism is an extremely important mediator of cellular function often altered during disease states, especially under chronic inflammatory conditions.

        <p>The inflammatory response is also driven by myriad factors 14,27 . Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are one such player considered as potential OA disease culprits due to their ability to modify proteins and lipids, damage DNA and other adverse effects in cells [28][29][30][31] . While ROS play important signaling functions in physiological states, elevated ROS present significant pathologic risk as mediators of disease progression in OA 32 . Furthermore, the production and elimination of ROS is closely tied to metabolic pathways, with enzymes and substrates playing dual roles in both ROS modulation and metabolic processing 33,34 .The inflammatory response is also driven by myriad factors 14,27 .

        <p>Thus, we proposed that inflammation-mediated metabolic shifts may underlie joint degradation in OA by promoting the production of inflammatory and catabolic proteins through the modulation of ROS in chondrocytes. We display that NF-κB activation in OA drives metabolic reprogramming of chondrocytes towards aerobic glycoylsis. We then show that this metabolic reprogramming causes increased oxidative stress in the cell in an lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA)-mediated manner. Finally, we demonstrate that metabolism-mediated oxidative stress promotes catabolic changes via the expression of IκB-ζ protein stabilization. Our findings highlight a relationship between these various players and offer therapeutic modalities for the treatment of OA.Thus, we proposed that inflammation-mediated metabolic shifts may underlie joint degradation in OA by promoting the production of inflammatory and catabolic proteins through the modulation of ROS in chondrocytes.

        <p>Inflammatory stimulation induces metabolic changes. We initially sought to determine the effect of inflammatory cytokines on chondrocytes in order to identify downstream therapeutic targets. Treatment of primary murine chondrocytes with IL-1β, a pro-inflammatory cytokine implicated in OA 10 , caused acidification of media (Supplementary Fig. 1A), suggesting a shift in cell metabolism akin to increased secretion of lactic acid via lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-mediated fermentation 35 . Primary sternal chondrocytes were utilized immediately upon isolation without any expansion to avoid de-differentiation and altered metabolism. Next, mRNA sequencing showed that IL-1β caused a significant increase in the expression of catabolic and inflammatory genes such as MMPs and Interleukins, while decreasing the expression of chondrocyte anabolic factors such as aggrecan (Fig. 1a (arrows); Supplementary Data 1), among many other differentially regulated genes. Interestingly, when inflammatory and immune pathways were filtered out, RNA-seq analysis revealed a significant difference in several metabolic pathways in the KEGG database 36 . Gene set analysis indicated a decrease in OxPhos and other metabolic pathways (Table 1), that are important for glucose metabolism. We further detected a significant increase in expression of genes involved in glycolysis and fermentation such as Hexokinase-2 and LDHA with a decrease or no change in TCA cycle and ETC genes (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Data 1). Overall, these results suggest a shift in glucose metabolism of chondrocytes towards aerobic glycolysis.Inflammatory stimulation induces metabolic changes.

        <p>We confirmed these findings by detecting elevated levels of extracellular lactic acid in supernatant of IL-1β-treated cell cultures (Supplementary Fig. 1B). Further, consistent with RNAseq data, using Seahorse assay, we detected increased glycolysis and decreased OxPhos in response to IL-1β as measured by cell respiration (Fig. 1c-g). In addition, these cells appeared to have slightly altered, though insignificant, mitochondrial biogenesis upon IL-1β treatment, potentially indicating a compensatory response due to altered metabolic activity (Supplementary Fig. 1c). These cells also displayed lower intracellular ATP levels with inflammatory stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 1D). In accordance with these metabolic and RNA-seq data, GLUT1 and LDHA, the key enzyme involved in fermentation, were increased upon inflammatory stimulation (Fig. 1h-i). In addition, chondrocytes subject to inflammation had increased expression and activity of G6PD2, the rate limiting enzyme involved in the oxidative phase of pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and modulation of NADPH levels (Fig. 1j, k and Supplementary Fig. 1E) with no significant change in expression of TCA cycle enzymes or non-oxidative phase of PPP (Supplementary Fig. 1F-J).We confirmed these findings by detecting elevated levels of extracellular lactic acid in supernatant of IL-1β-treated cell cultures (Supplementary Fig. 1B).

        <p>We then examined if the metabolic shift was mediated by NF-κB activation by IL-1β. Inhibition or deletion of IKK2, the classical NF-κB kinase, was able to reverse the metabolic shifts observed with IL-1β stimulation of chondrocytes (Fig. 1c-j, l; Supplementary Fig. 1B-D, and Supplementary Fig. 1F-J). Furthermore, expression of constitutively active IKK2 (IKK2ca) 51,52 in chondrocytes led to an increase in the expression of genes involved in glycolysis independent of cytokine stimulation, confirming direct NF-κB-mediated effects (Supplementary Fig. 1K-M).We then examined if the metabolic shift was mediated by NF-κB activation by IL-1β.

        <p>Finally, to determine the temporal regulation of metabolic changes in response to inflammation, a time course of IL-1β treatment of chondrocytes displayed that changes in metabolic enzyme gene expression occurred within 6 h of treatment, indicating that the shift in metabolism may occur soon after stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 1N-U). Furthermore, measurement of ECAR at these timepoints indicated that glycolytic activity was elevated at similar timepoints (Supplementary Fig. 1V-W). These results indicate an overall metabolic reprogramming of cellular glucose metabolic processes in response to inflammation.

        <p>We surmised that in human OA patients, initial insults to the joint promote low-grade inflammation and activate NF-κB pathway to initiate disease progression, which is then sustained chronically. We first confirmed activation of NF-κB in the MLI model by performing surgery in 12-week-old transgenic mice expressing luciferase reporter under the control of the NF-κB promoter. In vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) showed that NF-κB activity peaked around 1 week post surgery in the joint, and was significantly higher in MLI compared to sham-operated joints (Fig. 2a,b). NF-κB activation declined progressively in both groups with time, but remained higher in MLI-operated compared to sham-operated joints, suggesting a chronically activated state within the joint space. Micro-computed tomography (μCT) and radiographic analyses showed that mice subjected to MLI developed subchondral bone sclerosis and decreased joint spacing 8 weeks after surgery (Fig. 2c,d; white arrows). These structural changes were associated with loss of proteoglycans and fibrillation of articular cartilage (Fig. 2e, green arrows), which mimic the changes seen in human OA patients 37 . Furthermore, immunohistochemistry performed in joint sections showed increased p-IKK2 expression in articular cartilage (Fig. 2f; arrows). Buttressing the findings that NF-κB is activated in articular cartilage during OA development (Fig. 2f), we show that expression of NF-κB-induced catabolic enzymes is increased in cartilage of MLI joints (Supplementary Fig. 2A-D). We scrutinized the direct role of NF-κB activation in OA pathogenesis via expression of IKK2ca. We and others have reported previously that IKK2ca mimics a chronically activated inflammatory state by activating NF-κB transcriptional machinery in the absence of exogenous inflammatory stimuli 38,39 . We confirmed that treatment of primary chondrocytes with IL-1β or exogenous expression of IKK2ca in these cells both activated NF-κB signaling (Fig. 3a). Expression of IKK2ca increased gene expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and catabolic enzymes such as MMP13 and ADAMTS4 and pro-inflammatory factors such as MCP-1 (Fig. 3b-f). IL-6 and MMP13 are highly implicated in joint breakdown [40][41][42][43] and will be used as surrogates of inflammatory and catabolic gene expression throughout the study.We surmised that in human OA patients, initial insults to the joint promote low-grade inflammation and activate NF-κB pathway to initiate disease progression, which is then sustained chronically.

        <p>Based on the in vivo finding that MLI chronically activates NF-κB in articular cartilage and in vitro data displaying that NF-κB drives catabolic genes involved in OA, we expressed adenoviral IKK2ca in the joint and used LacZ expression as control. We observed that IKK2ca expression in the joint caused a severe joint degradation that resemble joints of end-stage rheumatoid arthritis, with significant inflammatory infiltrate and complete destruction of the femoral and tibial heads (Fig. 3g, arrows). However, this does not resemble the pathology seen in OA, suggesting that the inflammatory response in OA is more cell specific and occurs in a chronic, low-grade manner. Thus, in order to create a more specific model, we genetically expressed IKK2ca in articular chondrocytes in adult mice using the tamoxifen-inducible aggrecan (Acan1)-CreERT2. Histological analysis of joints by safranin-O staining revealed significant evidence of proteoglycan loss in articular cartilage of Acan1 CreER , IKK2ca ki/ki (IKK2ca acan ) mice compared to tamoxifen-treated control mice (Fig. 3h; arrows). Gene expression in articular cartilage of IKK2ca acan mice knee joints displayed increased expression of catabolic genes such as IL-6, MMP13, ADAMSTS4 and MCP-1 compared with wild-type (WT) mice (Fig. 3i-m). Thus, constitutive activation of IKK2/NF-κB in chondrocytes is sufficient to cause OA-like joint damage and resembles OA changes induced by MLI. This does not suggest that chondrocytes are the only source of inflammatory stimuli generated in the joint, as other cells such as synovial cells and macrophages are also contributors, but the inflammatory response of chondrocytes to such stimuli is critical for cartilage degradation.Based on the in vivo finding that MLI chronically activates NF-κB in articular cartilage and in vitro data displaying that NF-κB drives catabolic genes involved in OA, we expressed adenoviral IKK2ca in the joint and used LacZ expression as control.

        <p>NF-κB has many important physiological functions, making chronic or systemic NF-κB inhibition detrimental due to widespread side effects. We instead targeted the metabolic shift using the LDHA inhibitor FX11 44 to inhibit the final step of the aerobic glycolytic pathway and observed significant inhibition of inflammatory response genes such as IL-6 and MMP13 (Fig. 4a,b). Inhibition of LDHA was not toxic to cells and did not affect cell viability (Supplementary Fig. 3A,B). Supporting these findings, LDHA inhibition by FX11 did not significantly decrease cellular ATP levels as expected or change ECAR (Supplementary Fig. 3C,D). It is likely that there is partial inhibition of LDHA, Fig. 1 Inflammation promotes aerobic glycolysis in chondrocytes.

We then tested if LDHA inhibitor directly decreases NF-κB transcriptional activation by utilizing NF-κB-luciferase reporter chondrocytes and observed that surprisingly, LDHA inhibitor (24 h) did not alter NF-κB activation by IL-1β (Supplementary Fig. 3E).NF-κB has many important physiological functions, making chronic or systemic NF-κB inhibition detrimental due to widespread side effects.

We then tested if LDHA inhibitor directly decreases NF-κB transcriptional activation by utilizing NF-κB-luciferase reporter chondrocytes and observed that surprisingly, LDHA inhibitor (24 h) did not alter NF-κB activation by IL-1β (Supplementary Fig. 3E).</p>
        <p>In light of these observations, we hypothesized that NF-κBinduced LDHA activity reciprocally regulates expression of inflammatory response genes via targeting downstream products of NF-κB. A prime candidate was Nfkbiz, one of the most significantly upregulated genes in our RNA-seq dataset upon IL-1β stimulation (Fig. 1a), which encodes IκB-ζ, a proinflammatory protein that has been shown to be important in macrophages for production of a subset of inflammatory response genes 13,46,47 . We identified that gene expression of Nfkbiz was significantly elevated in joint articular cartilage at 4 weeks post MLI (Fig. 4c). Confirming that this finding is inflammationmediated, mRNA expression of Nfkbiz upon treatment of chondrocytes with IL-1β showed a significant and rapid increase, which was NF-κB dependent since IKK2 inhibitor treatment was able to significantly attenuate it (Fig. 4d). Protein levels of IκB-ζ, which is not expressed in untreated cells, were significantly increased upon treatment with IL-1β, while co-treatment with IKK2 inhibitor greatly reduced it, corroborating gene expression findings (Fig. 4e). Genetic deletion of Nfkbiz demonstrated that IκB-ζ is essential for the expression of a subset of inflammatory response genes such as IL-6 and MMP13 in chondrocytes, even when NF-κB signaling is intact (Fig. 4f-g). This highlights IκB-ζ as a critical player in the inflammatory response and OA cartilage degradation.In light of these observations, we hypothesized that NF-κBinduced LDHA activity reciprocally regulates expression of inflammatory response genes via targeting downstream products of NF-κB.

        <p>Based on the findings that FX11 reduced gene expression of catabolic genes independent of NF-κB activity, we proposed that inhibition of LDHA may decrease IκB-ζ expression. FX11 did not decrease gene expression of Nfkbiz induced by IL-1β (Fig. 4h) but significantly decreased IκB-ζ protein level (Fig. 4e). These observations together with our findings that chondrocytes under basal conditions express the Nfkbiz gene but not IκB-ζ protein, and that IL-1β is essential for IκB-ζ protein expression, suggested that IκB-ζ is regulated in a bi-modal manner transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally by IKK2 and LDHA, respectively. Proposing that IκB-ζ is likely regulated post-translationally, we displayed that IκB-ζ is targeted to the proteasome for degradation since use of proteasome inhibitor lead to accumulation of IκB-ζ even in the absence of inflammatory stimuli (Supplementary Fig. 3F; lanes 5, 7).Based on the findings that FX11 reduced gene expression of catabolic genes independent of NF-κB activity, we proposed that inhibition of LDHA may decrease IκB-ζ expression.

        <p>To confirm that inhibition of LDHA was responsible for the decreased expression of catabolic genes, and not due to an off target effect of FX11, LDHA was deleted from primary chondrocytes using LDHA f/f cells. LDHA deficient cells (LDHA -/-) displayed a significant decrease in expression of IL-6 and MMP13, confirming that LDHA supports catabolic gene expression (Fig. 4i-k). In addition, LDHA deletion lead to significant inhibition of IκB-ζ protein expression induced by IL-1β treatment (Fig. 4l). We then performed RNA sequencing to compare gene expression in LDHA and Nfkbiz deficient to wildtype chondrocytes treated with IL-1β. We identified many overlapping genes in LDHA deficient and Nfkbiz deficient chondrocytes, further suggesting that much of LDHA's antiinflammatory properties are IκB-ζ dependent (Fig. 4m-o). Of note, deletion of LDHA or use of FX11 did not significantly reduce lactate secretion (Supplementary Fig. 3G) or viability of chondrocytes, likely due to LDHB compensation. This confirms a previous report that deletion of both LDHA and LDHB is required in some cell types to eliminate lactate production 45,48 . We confirmed this proposition by using the LDH inhibitors GSK2837808A and sodium oxamate, which can act on both LDHA and LDHB. Indeed, both inhibitors were able to effectively reduce lactate production (Supplementary Fig. 3H). Similarly, deletion of LDHA alone was unable to significantly reduce lactic acid secretion (Supplementary Fig. 3I). We also observed that inflammatory stimulation had opposite effects on LDHB gene expression levels, with IL-1β treatment reducing LDHB gene expression (Supplementary Fig. 3J), yet residual activity of this enzyme supported lactate production. This is also supported by the fact that at the protein level, 24 h of IL-1β treatment did not decrease LDHB levels (Supplementary Fig. 3K). Various LDH inhibitors also did not affect protein levels, displaying the availability of LDHB to compensate.To confirm that inhibition of LDHA was responsible for the decreased expression of catabolic genes, and not due to an off target effect of FX11, LDHA was deleted from primary chondrocytes using LDHA f/f cells.

        <p>LDHA-NADH interaction propagates ROS induced by inflammation. Next, to decipher the mechanism by which LDHA modulates the expression of IκB-ζ and the inflammatory response, we first determined that LDHA does not regulate mRNA stability of Nfkbiz, suggesting that IκB-ζ is likely regulated at or beyond the stage of translation (Supplementary Fig. S4A). This is in agreement with previous publications that suggest that IκB-ζ is not regulated at the level of mRNA stability 49 . Since LDHA's primary function is to generate lactate, we examined if lactate levels can affect IκB-ζ stability and/or the inflammatory response. Treatment of chondrocytes with lactate did not affect IL-6 and slightly increased MMP13 gene expression, but had no effect on IκB-ζ protein expression (Supplementary Fig. 4B-D).LDHA-NADH interaction propagates ROS induced by inflammation.

        <p>We also observed that treatment of cells with super-physiological amounts of pyruvate marginally decreased the inflammatory response but not IκB-ζ protein levels (Supplementary Fig. 4E-G). These results rule out lactate and pyruvate as major contributors to IκB-ζ. Next, since LDHA inhibitor FX11 is a partial NADH analog 44,50 , we surmised that the mechanism of action is dependent upon LDHA binding to NADH. Prior publications in cell-free systems showed that LDHA bound to NADH can promote electron donor activity of NADH to generate ROS species, thus creating a ROS chain reaction [51][52][53] . Using the DCFDA fluorescent probe, we show that IL-1β significantly increased intracellular ROS production in an NF-κB-dependent manner (Fig. 5a). More importantly, FX11 treatment abolished ROS production (Fig. 5a).We also observed that treatment of cells with super-physiological amounts of pyruvate marginally decreased the inflammatory response but not IκB-ζ protein levels (Supplementary Fig. 4E-G).

        <p>There are several sources of ROS in the cell, though the most likely sources upon inflammatory stimulation are either the activity of NADPH oxidase (NOX) or mitochondrial activity. NOX activity is dependent upon NADPH, generated via pentose phosphate activity, which we have shown to be increased in chondrocytes treated with IL-1β (Supplementary Fig. 1E). We show that NOX2 and NOX4 are expressed in chondrocytes, with NOX2 expression being upregulated following IL-1β treatment (Fig. 5b,c). Interestingly, DPI, a NOX inhibitor, or 6-ANA, a PPP inhibitor, greatly decreased the IL-1β-induced increase of ROS, indicating that NOX activity is a critical component of IL-1βmediated ROS production (Fig. 5d). These results were further confirmed by the use of Vas2870, a highly specific NOX inhibitor (Supplementary Fig. 4H,I).There are several sources of ROS in the cell, though the most likely sources upon inflammatory stimulation are either the activity of NADPH oxidase (NOX) or mitochondrial activity.

The results of GSH:GSSG measurements suggest PPP activity is likely increased to maintain GSH levels and attempts to balance out the pro-ROS effect of IL-1β (Supplementary Fig. 4J).

        <p>We also measured levels of ROS generated in mitochondria and observed increased mtROS upon IL-1β treatment (Supplementary Fig. 4K), due to mitochondrial dysfunction displayed by the decrease in OxPhos observed in Fig. 1. This dysfunction likely contributes to increased NADH availability, as was previously published 54,55 , further contributing to the propagation of ROS by LDHA. However, use of FX11 did not decrease mtROS production.We also measured levels of ROS generated in mitochondria and observed increased mtROS upon IL-1β treatment (Supplementary Fig. 4K), due to mitochondrial dysfunction displayed by the decrease in OxPhos observed in Fig. 1.

        <p>To confirm that the ROS-propagating function of LDHA is not mediated by its enzymatic activity, but rather through interaction with NADH, we utilized sodium oxamate, a pyruvate-analog LDHA inhibitor, which should not interfere with LDHA-NADH interaction. We show that this inhibitor had no effect on ROS (Supplementary Fig. 4L), though at these concentrations it significantly decreased lactate production (Supplementary Fig. 3H) confirming inhibition of LDHA enzymatic activity. Furthermore, we display that FX11 increased levels of NADH relative to NAD in the cell, supporting our hypothesis that FX11 displaces NADH from LDHA and stops the donation of electrons from NADH to free radicals (Fig. 5E). LDHA deletion also reduced the amount of ROS generated in the cell upon IL-1β stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 4M). Thus, we confirm that blocking the NADH binding site on LDHA is critical for ROS generation compared to the substrate binding site.To confirm that the ROS-propagating function of LDHA is not mediated by its enzymatic activity, but rather through interaction with NADH, we utilized sodium oxamate, a pyruvate-analog LDHA inhibitor, which should not interfere with LDHA-NADH interaction.

We observed that chondrocytes cultured and treated in hypoxia exhibited similar inflammatory responses to IL-1β (Supplementary Fig. 5A-C). However, there was increased expression of LDHA and production of lactate, suggesting a greater reliance upon anaerobic glycolysis as expected under hypoxia. In addition, ROS levels also changed with similar patterns as that observed in normoxic culture conditions, although there was slightly more ROS with IL-1β stimulation, likely due to increased LDHA activity with hypoxia (Supplementary Fig. 5E). FX11 was still highly effective however, highlighting that the effects of inflammation on metabolism and ROS seen are independent of environmental oxygen and originate from a cell intrinsic source.

We then performed IHC in human OA cartilage compared to healthy donors and observed increased staining for IκB-ζ protein in the OA cartilage (Fig. 8g,arrows).</p>
        <p>Next, we validated our results utilizing HAC, treated with IKK2i or FX11 in the presence or absence of IL-1β. Treatment with IL-1β increased gene expression of NFKBIZ, which was significantly reduced with IKK2 inhibitor, but not with FX11 (Fig. 8h), replicating murine data (Fig. 4h). In addition, treatment with IKK2 inhibitor was highly effective at reducing catabolic enzyme and inflammatory cytokine production by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway (Fig. 8i,j). FX11 had a similar inhibitory effect on catabolic gene expression (Fig. 8i,j) as it did in murine chondrocytes by reducing IL-6 and MMP13 expression (Fig. 4a,b), identifying LDHA as a potential therapeutic target in human OA patients as well.Next, we validated our results utilizing HAC, treated with IKK2i or FX11 in the presence or absence of IL-1β.

        <p>This work highlights several findings that have important implications for understanding the intricate relationship between the inflammatory and metabolic responses of OA chondrocytes. We conclude that, (a) Inflammation shifts cell metabolism towards aerobic glycolysis in an NF-κB-mediated manner, (b) LDHA has a pro-ROS forming function in chondrocytes during inflammatory states, (c) Inhibition of LDHA activity has potent anti-inflammatory and anti-catabolic properties via increasing degradation of IκB-ζ by the proteasome.This work highlights several findings that have important implications for understanding the intricate relationship between the inflammatory and metabolic responses of OA chondrocytes.

        <p>Unlike other joint diseases, such as RA, that have a significant pathogenic contribution from immune and other joint synovial cells, OA is primarily driven by the generation of catabolic products from articular chondrocytes in response to biomechanical and inflammatory stimuli. Here, we present definitive data that chronic NF-κB activation is one of the major drivers of pathological changes in OA. NF-κB can be activated in chondrocytes due to insults throughout life such as mechanical stress, injury, and the presence of inflammatory cytokines emanating from aging, metabolic disease and other causes to promote catabolic changes. Cartilage degradation further increases mechanical stress and injury to the joint, exacerbating inflammatory stimuli in the synovial space to perpetuate NF-κB activity and generate a vicious positive feedback cycle.Unlike other joint diseases, such as RA, that have a significant pathogenic contribution from immune and other joint synovial cells, OA is primarily driven by the generation of catabolic products from articular chondrocytes in response to biomechanical and inflammatory stimuli.

        <p>However, chronic systemic inhibition of NF-κB is challenging in humans due to undesired side effects. Similarly, inhibition of individual cytokines, such as IL-1β, using biologics has failed in the past for treating OA since it does not block the myriad of other potential inflammatory stimuli 57 . We instead explored a paradigm by which inflammation and metabolism are reciprocally regulatory. IL-1β treatment caused metabolic reprogramming, mimicking the Warburg effect and expanding upon some previous reports studying chondrocyte metabolism [58][59][60] . Other gene expression sets from articular chondrocytes treated with IL-1β or OA chondrocytes also display similar alterations in metabolic enzyme expression 61,62 , confirming metabolic changes as a conserved aspect of OA. We highlight the metabolic shift is a potential target for treating OA and identify a non-metabolic function of LDHA that is critical for modulating the inflammatory response, independent of its canonical lactate-producing role. Chan et al. showed elegantly that LDHA binding to NADH in a cell-free system can greatly increase the rate of oxidation and free radical generation, causing a chain reaction that was dependent upon superoxide as the initiating factor 52,63,64 . It is likely that the interaction of NADH with the Rossman fold domain of LDHA 65,66 allows for faster electron donation from NADH to oxygen-containing compounds through its catalytic activity, as well as by thermodynamic stabilization of free radical intermediates. A similar finding was reported by another group studying the role of LDHA 67 , validating our own results. However, the impact of this finding in biological systems and its implications for disease has not been well studied. While this work suggests that NADH is a pathological factor, it is likely only so during inflammatory states. During inflammation, elevated glycolysis leads to increased NADH levels, which is not consumed due to the decrease in ETC activity. Overall, this high-energy NADH excess can donate electrons to oxygen-containing compounds in addition to pyruvate. We propose however that this mechanism is only partially responsible for the effect of FX11 on inflammation since prior studies have shown that FX11 can also have some effects on mitochondria 44 , which may explain why deletion of LDHA did not have as dramatic of an effect on ROS as FX11 treatment. More surprisingly, LDHA deletion or inhibition had little effect on chondrocyte viability or lactate levels, demanding further research into the role of other LDH isoforms during inflammatory states. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that IκB-ζ plays an important part in the metabolic-inflammatory axis and is, at least partially, responsible for the pro-inflammatory effects of LDHAinduced ROS. IκB-ζ is an inflammatory mediator that we display is bi-modally regulated by NF-κB and ROS, transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally, respectively. The process begins with transcriptional expression of Nfkbiz by IKK2/NF-κB followed by stabilization of its protein product, IκB-ζ, in ROS-dependent manner. We display that IκB-ζ is redox-sensitive protein essential for the expression of a subset of inflammatory response genes, such as IL-1β, MMP13 and IL-6, which are well established culprits of OA cartilage loss, a finding supported by recent evidence 68 and warrants discovery of direct inhibitors of IκB-ζ activity. One of the limitations of this study was the use of fluorescent probes such as DCFDA to study ROS production. The use of redox sensors would offer much more fine-tuned analysis of ROS species. Further elucidating this redox mechanism through state-of-the-art genetic models and redox measurement techniques will be the focus of future work, especially given the extensive evidence that oxidative stress is a prevalent factor in OA pathogenesis 31,69 . Studies analyzing synovial fluid displayed that OA patients have elevated levels of lactic acid in the absence of sepsis, further supporting the notion that LDHA is likely a pathogenic player in human OA 70 , which we confirmed using human OA tissue samples. Our work has important translational implications given that targeting LDHA may be very safe in humans. Humans who have nonfunctional LDHA mutations are often asymptomatic or have symptoms upon severe exertion 71,72 , suggesting that inhibition of LDHA may not pose a significant detrimental effect to healthy cells. It is possible that with specific targeting of FX11 or NF-κB inhibitors to the joint, the progression of OA can be halted by preventing chondrocyte-mediated inflammatory response.
