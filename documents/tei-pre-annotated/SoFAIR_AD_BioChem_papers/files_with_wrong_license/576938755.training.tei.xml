        <p>Approximately 75% of all breast cancers express the oestrogen and/or progesterone receptors. Endocrine therapy is usually effective in these hormone-receptor-positive tumours, but primary and acquired resistance limits its long-term benefit 1,2 . Here we show that in mouse models of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, periodic fasting or a fasting-mimicking diet 3-5 enhances the activity of the endocrine therapeutics tamoxifen and fulvestrant by lowering circulating IGF1, insulin and leptin and by inhibiting AKT-mTOR signalling via upregulation of EGR1 and PTEN. When fulvestrant is combined with palbociclib (a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor), adding periodic cycles of a fasting-mimicking diet promotes long-lasting tumour regression and reverts acquired resistance to drug treatment. Moreover, both fasting and a fasting-mimicking diet prevent tamoxifen-induced endometrial hyperplasia. In patients with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer receiving oestrogen therapy, cycles of a fasting-mimicking diet cause metabolic changes analogous to those observed in mice, including reduced levels of insulin, leptin and IGF1, with the last two remaining low for extended periods. In mice, these long-lasting effects are associated with long-term anti-cancer activity. These results support further clinical studies of a fasting-mimicking diet as an adjuvant to oestrogen therapy in hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer.</p>
        <p>Growth factor signalling through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) axes enhances oestrogen receptor activity and frequently underlies endocrine resistance in breast tumours 1,2,6 . Water-only fasting or plant-based diets that are simultaneously low in calories, sugar and protein and proportionally high in fat (fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs)) reduce circulating growth factors such as insulin and IGF1 2,6,7 . Therefore, we hypothesized that these dietary interventions could be used to enhance the activity of oestrogen therapy (ET) and delay endocrine resistance.</p>
        <p>Low-serum, low-glucose cell culture conditions designed to mimic the effects of fasting or FMD (referred to as short-term starvation, STS) increased the anti-tumour activities of tamoxifen and fulvestrant in HR + /HER2 -breast cancer (BC) cell lines, and similar results were obtained in mouse xenografts of the same cell lines subjected to weekly cycles of fasting or FMD (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Figs. 1, 2a, b). STS also increased the anti-tumour activity of tamoxifen in tumour organoids from patients with HR + BC 8 , and weekly FMD cycles prevented acquired resistance to tamoxifen in mice (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). Enhancement of ET activity through STS was dependent on the reduction in serum, but not glucose, as adding back glucose to the growth medium did not affect the observed potentiation (Extended Data Fig. 3a).</p>
        <p>In mice, besides increasing β-hydroxybutyrate levels (Extended Data Fig. 3b) and lowering blood glucose (from 6.3 ± 0.6 mmol l -1 to 4.1 ± 0.3 mmol l -1 and 4.0 ± 0.9 mmol l -1 , respectively; n = 4), fasting or FMD modified the levels of circulating growth factors and adipokines</p>
        <p>(Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 3c). Both dietary interventions reduced serum C-peptide (a proxy of endogenous insulin production). They also reduced both circulating insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3, which binds to circulating IGF1, protecting it from rapid degradation 9 ), while increasing IGFBP1 (which inhibits IGF1 action by preventing its binding to IGF receptors 9 ). Thus, fasting or FMD reduced IGF1 levels and bioavailability. Fasting or FMD combined with ET also reduced the levels of leptin (Fig 1b), an adipokine that acts as a growth factor for HR + BC cells and reduces ET efficacy 10,11 . Notably, adiponectin, which exerts anti-tumour effects 10 , was increased when fasting was added to the tamoxifen treatment(Extended Data Fig. 3c).</p>
        <p>Adding back insulin, leptin or IGF1-which we collectively refer to as fasting-reduced factors (FRFs)-in mice bearing MCF7 xenografts that were treated with fulvestrant plus FMD was sufficient to revert the FMD-induced enhancement of fulvestrant activity (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig. 3d). We obtained similar results in cultured MCF7 cells (Extended Data Fig. 3e). In mice, withdrawing FRFs after three cycles of FMD (day 35) restored tumour sensitivity to ET plus FMD, whereas administering FRFs to mice treated with fulvestrant plus FMD stimulated tumour growth and abrogated fulvestrant potentiation via FMD (Fig. 1c). These data are consistent with a previous study demonstrating that insulin reduction enhances PI3K inhibitor activity in various cancer types 12 . That these FRFs have overlapping effects in activating signalling cascades affecting HR + BC sensitivity to ET-such as the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway [10][11][12][13][14][15] -may explain why reducing all three factors maximizes the enhancement of ET anti-tumour activity. Consistent with this notion, tumours isolated from mice from which FRFs were withdrawn showed reduced phosphorylation of AKT and of p70S6K (an mTOR target), whereas tumours from mice that were given FRFs during treatment with fulvestrant plus FMD showed AKT and p70S6K phosphorylation levels comparable to those in mice fed ad libitum (Extended Data Fig. 3f).</p>
        <p>In addition to IGF1, insulin and leptin, fasting or FMD (with or without tamoxifen or fulvestrant) lowered tumour necrosis factor (TNF), which can promote cancer growth by upregulating aromatase in the tumour microenvironment and by enhancing angiogenesis and cell invasion (Extended Data Fig. 3c). By contrast, interleukin 1β (IL-1β), which enhances HR + BC cell migration and metastasis 15,16 , was reduced by combined tamoxifen or fulvestrant and FMD. Because downregulation of insulin, IGF1 and leptin proved essential for FMD-induced potentiation of ET anti-tumour activity, we focused on these FRFs for subsequent mechanistic experiments. However, it is likely that the benefit of adding fasting or FMD to ET involves other mediators, such as TNF and IL-1β.</p>
        <p>STS and the FMD (in experiments with MCF7 xenografts) cooperated with ET to increase the expression of PTEN, a negative regulator of AKT-mTOR signalling 13 , in HR + BC cell lines (in vitro and in vivo) and in HR + /HER2 -BC organoids (Fig. 1d, Extended Data Fig. 4a-d). In line with the previously described reduction of AKT phosphorylation and mTOR activity, these treatment combinations reduced p70S6K and eIF4E phosphorylation; increased the abundance of the translational repressor 4E-BP1, primarily in its unphosphorylated form; and inhibited protein synthesis (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b,e). Among the known</p>
        <p>enhancers of PTEN expression, we focused on the tumour suppressor epidermal growth factor 1 (EGR1), the expression of which is associated with good prognosis in patients with BC 17,18 , and which is upregulated in healthy tissues during fasting 19 and is suppressed by oestrogen receptor activity 20 . EGR1 levels increased in HR + BC cell lines and HR + BC organoids after treatment with ET plus STS/FMD (Fig. 1d, Extended Data Fig. 4a-d). EGR1 silencing reduced the anti-tumour activity of coupled ET and STS/FMD and prevented ET-STS-induced PTEN accumulation and AKT inhibition (Extended Data Fig. 5a-e). BC cell protection from combined ET and STS through EGR1 silencing reflected persistent AKT activity, as the AKT inhibitors GDC0068 and AZD5363 and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 all abolished this protection (Extended Data Fig. 5f). PTEN silencing and expression of a constitutively active AKT (myristoylated (myr)-AKT) also reduced the sensitivity of MCF7 to combined ET and STS/FMD (Extended Data Fig. 5e,g,h). Supplementation with insulin, IGF1 and leptin, or with 17β-oestradiol, prevented increases in EGR1, PTEN and 4E-BP1 in response to combined tamoxifen and STS in MCF7 cancer cells (Extended Data Fig. 5i). Myr-AKT also abolished upregulation of EGR1 and PTEN (Extended Data Fig. 5j,k). Therefore, fasting or FMD and ET appear to cooperate to reduce AKT-mediated inhibition of EGR1 expression. In turn, increased EGR1 raises PTEN levels and strengthens AKT inhibition. AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), which reduces mTOR activity, was also phosphorylated in BC cells exposed to combined ET and STS (Extended Data Fig. 6a). This effect was prevented by silencing of either PTEN or myr-AKT, indicating that AMPK stimulation through coupled ET and STS is secondary to upregulation of PTEN and to reduced AKT activity 21 . Oestrogen receptor activity is essential for the survival and proliferation of HR + BC cells and is enhanced by insulin, IGF1 and leptin signalling at multiple levels 1,7,11,14 . STS reduced oestrogen-receptor-dependent transcription and enhanced fulvestrant-and tamoxifen-mediated oestrogen receptor inhibition in HR + BC cell lines, as indicated by luciferase reporter assays and by the reduced expression of the oestrogen receptor target genes TFF1, PGR and GREB1 (Extended Data Fig. 6b,c). Thus, STS and ET also cooperate to inhibit oestrogen receptor activity.</p>
        <p>Using gene expression microarrays and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we observed a downregulation of cell-cycle-related categories of genes after combined TMX and STS treatment in MCF7 cells (Extended Data Fig. 7a-c). We verified the downregulation of four of these genes-E2F1, E2F2, CCNE1 and CCND1-at the mRNA level (Extended Data Fig. 7d) and the protein level (cyclin D1 (CCND1); Extended Data Fig. 7e,f) after combined treatment. Consistent with their effects on cell cycle regulators, coupled STS and ET reduced levels of phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (RB) in HR + BC cells and induced cell cycle arrest in the G0-G1 phase (Extended Data Figs. 7e,g,8a,b). Silencing of EGR1 and expression of myr-AKT both attenuated the downregulation of CCND1 in response to coupled ET and STS, and myr-AKT protected MCF7 from the cell cycle arrest caused by ET, STS or their combination (Extended Data Fig. 8c,d). Therefore, EGR1 upregulation and AKT inhibition mediate the downregulation of CCND1 by combined ET and STS and the consequent cell cycle arrest.</p>
        <p>We reasoned that the downregulation of CCND1 by combined ET and FMD could be exploited to provide an additional therapeutic effect, by adding a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor such as palbociclib, which is widely used together with ET in patients with HR + BC 1 . In mice bearing orthotopic MCF7 xenografts, FMD cycles or palbociclib postponed the occurrence of fulvestrant resistance to a similar extent (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 8e). However, even the combination of fulvestrant and FMD or fulvestrant and palbociclib could not prevent resistance from arising. Combining fulvestrant, FMD and palbociclib not only prevented tumour growth for more than 160 days, but also led to slow-but steady-tumour shrinkage. Furthermore, administering FMD cycles to mice with tumours that had become resistant to fulvestrant plus palbociclib induced tumour shrinkage even at this advanced stage (Fig. 2b,left). MCF7 cells with acquired resistance to fulvestrant plus palbociclib (Extended Data Fig. 8f,g) were expanded and used to establish new xenografts, and, again, adding the FMD to fulvestrant and palbociclib resulted in significant anti-tumour activity (Fig. 2b,right).</p>
        <p>Necropsies of mice treated with combined tamoxifen and fasting or FMD revealed uteri of smaller size than the enlarged uteri from mice treated with tamoxifen alone. Fasting or FMD prevented the increase in uterus size and weight caused by tamoxifen and attenuated the histological signs of tamoxifen-induced endometrial hyperplasia, such as wide, thick endometrial villi and tufts or blebs budding from the epithelium (Fig. 2c,d, Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). Fasting or FMD with or without tamoxifen reduced the expression of Tff1 and the levels of phosphorylated AKT in mouse uteri, while increasing Egr1 and Pten mRNA (Extended Data Fig. 9c,d). PTEN and EGR1 proteins were also upregulated in the uterus in response to water fasting, whereas FMD resulted in only a trend towards an increase in these proteins (Extended Data Fig. 9d). Therefore, fasting or FMD reduces tamoxifen-induced endometrial hyperplasia, oestrogen receptor activity and AKT activation in the mouse uterus. Finally, fasting or FMD cooperated with tamoxifen to reduce intra-abdominal fat in mice (Fig. 2e, Extended Data Fig. 9e). Because intra-abdominal fat is a major source of adipokines, this reduction could explain the leptin-lowering effect of combined ET and fasting or FMD.</p>
        <p>We tested the combination of periodic FMD and ET in 36 patients with HR + BC enrolled in one of two clinical trials, NCT03595540 (patients 1-24) and NCT03340935 (patients 25-36), designed to assess the safety and feasibility of periodic FMD in patients receiving active cancer treatment (Supplementary Table 1). In the NCT03595540 trial, patients received a five-day FMD (Xentigen) 3,5 every four weeks. They completed an average of 6.8 FMD cycles, with some undergoing up to 14 cycles. Also in this clinical study, the FMD proved to be safe, leading to only grade 1-2 adverse events, most commonly headache (41%) and fatigue (21%) (Supplementary Tables 1,2). Patients from the NCT03340935 study received a similar, albeit more calorie-restricted, five-day FMD regimen every three to four weeks and completed an average of 5.5 cycles with no severe adverse events. Patients from the NCT03595540 trial, who also received dietary recommendations 22 and instructions for daily muscle training for the intervals between FMD cycles, maintained a stable body weight and hand grip (Extended Data Fig. 10a). Their bioimpedance phase angle 23 and fat-free mass increased over time, whereas their fat mass decreased. These findings were confirmed by abdominal or thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan analyses in those patients for whom CT scans were available at baseline and during treatment (Extended Data Fig. 10b). Clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic HR + /HER2 -BC, including those treated with combined ET, palbociclib and FMD (n = 4), are promising (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Table 1). Patients 1, 26 and 27 have been treated in the second-line treatment setting for 32, 20 and 11 months, respectively, receiving a total of 10 (patient 1) and 8 (patients 26 and 27) FMD cycles. Patients 1 and 26</p>
        <p>still have clinically controlled disease, whereas patient 27 progressed after 11 months (median progression-free survival (PFS) in this clinical setting is 9 months) 16,24 . Patient 29 received fourth-line treatment with fulvestrant and palbociclib plus five FMD cycles, ultimately progressing after 11 months. Considering all of the patients with HR + /HER2 -BC who were enrolled in these trials, the FMD lowered blood glucose, serum IGF1, leptin and C-peptide, while increasing circulating ketone bodies (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 10c,d). Levels of leptin and IGF1-but not insulin-were still lower than the baseline values three weeks after the end of the FMD (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 10e).</p>
        <p>Similar findings were obtained in mice (Extended Data Fig. 10f): in response to combined ET and FMD (but not to ET or FMD alone), leptin and IGF1 remained lower than in ad-libitum-fed mice, even with refeeding one week after the end of the FMD. Given that both leptin and IGF1 stimulate BC cell proliferation 11,14,25,26 , we evaluated whether these long-term changes in circulating FRFs, which persisted beyond the FMD period, were associated with anti-cancer effects. A one-month treatment of MCF7-xenograft-bearing mice with ET plus FMD (or fasting), but not with each treatment separately, slowed tumour growth for up to 90 days after treatment withdrawal, and resulted in enhanced mouse survival (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 10g,h). Pre-treating the mice with coupled ET and FMD for one month, followed by MCF7 cell inoculation, reduced tumour engraftment and slowed the growth of those tumours that did engraft (Fig. 3e,f). Pre-treatment with fulvestrant also slowed MCF7 xenograft growth, probably due to the use of a long-acting formulation. However, pre-treatment with combined FMD and fulvestrant was more effective than treatment with fulvestrant alone.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, periodic fasting or FMD increases the anti-cancer activity of tamoxifen and fulvestrant, delays resistance to these agents and, in combination with fulvestrant and palbociclib, causes tumour regression and reverses acquired resistance to these two drugs. A pivotal cause for the enhancement of ET anti-tumour activity by fasting or FMD appears to be the reduction in blood insulin, IGF1 and leptin, with the consequent inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, at least in part through the upregulation of EGR1 and PTEN (Fig. 3g). Notably, fasting or FMD inhibits the AKT-mTOR axis without causing the rebound hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia that are associated with the use of PI3K or mTORC1inhibitors and have been implicated in tumour resistance to these treatments 12,19,27,28 . The leptin-and IGF1-lowering effects of ET plus FMD persist beyond the FMD period and are associated with carry-over anti-cancer activity. Therefore, the observed regression of HR + BC in mice could reflect both an acute and stronger, together with a chronic and milder, reduction of these FRFs. These results also support a potential cancer-preventive effect of FMD cycles. The ability of fasting or FMD to prevent tamoxifen-induced endometrial hyperplasia is another interesting finding, given the prevalence of this side effect of tamoxifen and the limited options for preventing it 1,29 .</p>
        <p>Overall, our results provide the rationale for larger clinical studies of FMDs as a means to improve clinical outcomes in patients with HR + BC receiving ET, but also for the treatment of other cancers that are sensitive to insulin, IGF1 or leptin deprivation.</p>

            <rs type="software">Limma</rs> package. Gene-set enrichment analysis was performed using the 
            <rs type="software">version</rs> implemented in 
            <rs type="software">fgsea</rs> package, performing 10,000 permutations and using as database the REACTOME 
            <rs type="software">Pathways</rs> data set (
            <rs type="url">reactome.db</rs> package). Box plots were generated using the

            <rs type="version">2</rs> package, and to evaluate the differences between the groups, a non-parametric two-sided Wilcoxon test was used. All results were corrected according to the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.
        </p>
        <p>Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed as described elsewhere 31 . Gene-specific primers were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Thermo Fisher and are listed in Supplementary Table 3. Comparisons in gene expression were performed using the 2 -ΔΔCt method.</p>
        <p>Mouse whole blood was collected in Eppendorf tubes. It was allowed to coagulate for 2 h at room temperature, centrifuged 20 min at 4,000 rpm and then stored in aliquots in PCR tubes at -80 °C until subsequent use. Whole blood from patients was collected in Vacuette Serum Clot Tubes, centrifuged 20 min at 2,100 rpm and then aliquoted into small tubes and stored at -80 °C until use. All the ELISA assays to detect mouse and human serum level of IGF1, IGFBP1, IGFBP3, C-peptide, leptin and adiponectin were purchased from R&amp;D System except that for mouse C-peptide, which was purchased from Alpco.</p>
        <p>All mouse experiments were performed in accordance with the relevant laws and institutional guidelines for animal care and use established in the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care (directive 86 /609 /EEC). Animal work was only started upon approval by the Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS). NOD/SCIDγ mice were used in the experiments shown in Fig. 2a,b and Extended Data Fig. 8e-g at the animal facility of IFOM-IEO (Milan, Italy). They were derived from in-house colonies and were kept for a maximum of three generations. Breeders (Charles River Laboratories) and experimental animals were maintained under pathogen-free conditions. 6-8-week-old female athymic Nude-FoxN1 mice (purchased from Envigo) were used in the experiments shown in Figs. 1 and3 d-f and Extended Data Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4c, 7f and 10f-h at the Animal Facility of the IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino. These animals were maintained in air-filtered laminar flow cabinets with a 12-h light cycle and food and water ad libitum. Mice were acclimatized for 1 week. To allow MCF7, T47D and ZR-75-1 xenograft growth, the day before cell injection a 17β-oestradiol-releasing pellet (Innovative Research of America) was inserted in the intra-scapular subcutaneous region under anaesthesia conditions. 5 × 10 6 MCF7, 8 × 10 6 ZR-75-1 or 5 × 10 6 T47D cells were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) into either one or both flanks of the mouse (see Source Data files). Alternatively, 3 × 10 6 MCF7 were injected orthotopically into the fourth abdominal fat pad (experiments shown in Fig. 2c,d and Extended Data Fig. 8e). Treatment was initiated when the tumours appeared as established palpable masses (~2 weeks after cell injection). In each experiment, mice were randomly assigned to one of the following arms: control (ad libitum diet); tamoxifen (45 mg/kg/d in peanut oil, oral gavage [33][34][35] ); fulvestrant (150 mg/kg/once a week, s.c. [35][36][37] ); palbociclib (65 mg/kg, in H 2 O, oral gavage, three times a week on Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays [38][39][40] ); IGF1 (200 μg/kg body weight 41 , s.c., twice a day on the days of FMD); insulin (20 mU/kg body weight 12 , s.c., on the days of FMD); leptin (1 mg/kg body weight 42 , s.c., once a day Monday through Friday, including on the days of FMD); fasting (water only, for 48 h every week 4,43 ); FMD (previously described in refs. 3,4 ; for 48-96 h every week); or combinations of these treatments as indicated. Mice were housed in a clean, new cage to reduce coprophagy and residual chow. Body weight was measured immediately before, during and after fasting/FMD. FMD cycles were repeated every 5 or 7 d in order obtain complete recover of body weight before a new cycle. Tumour volume was calculated using the formula: tumour volume = (w2 × W) x π/6, where "w" and "W" are "minor side" and "major side" (in mm), respectively. The maximal tumour volume that was permitted by our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) was 1,500 mm 3 , and in none of the experiments were these limits exceeded. Tumour masses were always isolated at the end of the last FMD/fasting cycle, weighed, divided in two parts and stored in liquid nitrogen for subsequent RNA extraction, or fixed in formalin for histology. For the resistance acquisition experiments mice were treated with weekly FMD cycles, with a 1-week break every fifth week, until the masses quadrupled their initial volume (or quadrupled the smallest volume ever reached, in Fig. 2b), as this was chosen as the criterion for defining resistance acquisition and disease progression,. In Extended Data 8e (representing mouse progression-free survival), mouse deaths that were unrelated to disease progression are presented as outreach symbol on the survival curves. In the experiments with tamoxifen-induced endometrial hyperplasia, 6-8-week old female BALB/c mice (Envigo) were used. At the end of the experiment, uteri were divided into two parts and stored in liquid nitrogen for subsequent RNA extraction and in formalin for histological examination.</p>
        <p>Sample size estimation was performed using 
            <rs type="software">PS (Power and Sample size calculation)</rs> software (
            <rs type="creator">Vanderbilt University</rs>). By this approach we estimated that the number of mice that was assigned to each treatment group would reach a power of 0.85. The Type I error probability associated with our tests of the null hypothesis was 0.05. Mice were assigned to the different experimental groups in a random fashion. Operators were unblinded, with the exception of the pathologists who analysed the tumour samples isolated from animals in Fig. 2 and in Extended Data Figs. 8 and9 (these pathologists were blinded). Blinding during animal experiments was not possible because mice were subject to a specific diet supply and daily treatment.

        <p>Tissue samples of uterus and breast gland were formalin fixed for 24 h, routinely processed and paraffin embedded. From each paraffin block, 4-μm-thick sections were cut in one session and mounted on Superfrost Plus (Thermo Scientific) microscope slides. Polyclonal antibody for Ki67 (Cell Signaling, D2H10) diluted 1:50 plus Dako EnVision and Dual Link System HRP coupled with DAB detection kit were used for Ki67 staining. After immunostaining slides were counterstained with haematoxylin and coverslipped. All stains and immunostains were evaluated by one expert pathologist (LM) blinded as to the different treatments.</p>
        <p>The NCT03595540 was conducted at the IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino and was approved by the Comitato Etico Regione Liguria. This trial consists of a single-arm phase II clinical study of a FMD (Xentigen, by L-Nutra, Los Angeles, CA) in 60 patients with solid or hematologic tumours undergoing active cancer treatment. Primary study endpoints were the feasibility and safety of monthly cycles of the FMD in patients with solid or hematologic tumours who undergo active treatment. Secondary pre-specified endpoints were: patient nutritional status; quality of life; clinical responses; long-term efficacy (progression-free survival, overall survival); effect of FMD on metabolic parameters (for example, HOMA index, circulating levels of IGF1); and effect of FMD on circulating immune cell subsets. An amendment to the protocol (which included the possibility of using imaging studies that are otherwise routinely prescribed for disease monitoring, for example, CT scans, for body composition evaluation) was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Regione Liguria on 8 April 2019 (#27). The FMD tested was described elsewhere 3,5 . Throughout the clinical study, patients received dietary counselling for the intervals between FMD cycles, aiming at providing an appropriate intake of proteins (primarily from seafood and legumes), essential fatty acids, vitamins and minerals as per international guidelines 22,44 , and were also invited to perform light/moderate daily muscle training (for example, 500-600 kJ/d; as allowed by their medical condition; https://docs. google.com/presentation/d/1szaRW4t-pZQI17o2Pe0747FsUEOVW-WiA6BHja0p8H_0/edit#slide=id.g34ad797184_0_0) to enhance muscle anabolism 45 . Between FMD cycles, patients were prescribed amino acid supplements (Aminotrofic; 30 g essential amino acids two times a day) in the presence of a difficulty in maintaining phase angle values of 5 degrees or greater. Additional information on this trial is available at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03595540. Patient serum for subsequent ELISA assays of circulating growth factors and adipokines was routinely collected before commencement of the first and of the second FMD cycle. In addition, in those patients who lived close to the enrolment site, blood draws were also performed on day 6 of the FMD cycle. Blood glucose and ketone bodies were self-measured by the patients using Glucomen Areo 2k (Menarini). Bioimpedance measurements were done by BIA 101 (Akern, Florence, Italy) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.</p>
        <p>The NCT03340935 clinical trial was conducted at the Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy. It was approved by the Comitato Etico of this Institution. This study aimed to assess the safety of a FMD in patients with cancer treated with different standard anti-tumour therapies (primary study endpoint). Secondary pre-specified endpoints included feasibility of the FMD in patients with cancer; metabolic effects of the FMD; effects of the FMD on blood growth; weight changes during the FMD; changes in blood cell counts; changes in kidney function parameters; and changes in liver parameters. Patients with any malignancy, with the exception of small-cell neuroendocrine tumours, were considered for enrolment in this study. The FMD was administered up to a maximum of 8 consecutive cycles in combination with standard adjuvant treatments or therapies for advanced disease. The FMD used in this study consisted of a 5-d plant-based, low-calorie (600 kcal on day 1, followed by 300 kcal/d on days 2-5), low-protein, low-carbohydrate diet (patent pending). The FMD was repeated every 3 or 4 weeks up to a maximum of 8 consecutive cycles. Additional information on this trial can be obtained at https:// clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03340935.</p>
        <p>Both of these studies complied with all relevant ethical regulations. Informed consent was obtained from all patients in both clinical trials.</p>
        <p>CT scans of patients 1 and 3 were acquired with different CT scanners. Both 1.25-mm and 5-mm slice thickness with standard body kernel were available. The whole body was scanned from the lung apex to the pubic symphysis (patient 1). Reconstructed axial images with both a 1.25-mm and a 5-mm slice thickness were analysed using the software installed on the workstations of the IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino Radiology Department (Suite-Estensa 1.9-Ebit-Esaote Group Company, 2015). The third lumbar vertebra (L3), at the level in which both transverse processes are clearly visible, was the bony landmark for the estimation of total muscle area. If abdominal CT scans were not available and only thoracic CT was done (patient 3), estimation of total muscle area at the level of the Louis angle (manubriosternal joint that lies at the level of the second costal cartilage) at baseline and after repeated FMD cycles were done as described previously 46 .</p>
        <p>Statistical analyses were performed with 
            <rs type="software">GraphPad Prism</rs> software version 
            <rs type="version">5</rs> (

        <p>In the NCT03595540 clinical trial, patients were enrolled and data were collected at the Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Specialties of the University of Genoa (Viale Benedetto XV 6, 16132 Genoa, Italy), Day Service Room 1, between December 2017 and February 2020. In the NCT03340935 clinical trial, patients were enrolled and data were collected at the Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Onco-hematology Department, Medical Oncology 1 Unit, between February 2017 and February 2020.</p>
        <p>In the NCT03595540 clinical trial, primary outcomes were safety and feasibility of the FMD in patients with cancer undergoing active medical or radiotherapy treatment. FMD-emergent adverse events [ Time Frame: 6 months ] were classified according to NCI CTCAE 5.0. Feasibility was measured as the percentage of prescribed diet consumed and intake of any extra food [ Time Frame: 6 months ] It was monitored through the compilation of a food diary or via phone calls during the FMD periods and was defined as the strict adherence to the diet prescribed in all its days with the possibility to admit the consumption of only 50% of the planned diet and / or a maximum consumption of 4-5 Kcal / kg of food not expected in only one of the days -2, -1, +1 of each cycle. Pre-specified secondary outcome measures: &gt; patient nutritional status as monitored by weight, handgrip strength, bio-impedance and serum markers (ferritin, transferrin, cholinesterase). &gt; Quality of life (QLQ-C30) &gt; Clinical responses measured by CT, MRI or by blood chemistry tests, dosing of tumor markers and / or molecular biology tests in the case of prostate tumors or hematologic tumors (e.g. PSA in patients affected by prostate cancer, BCR / Abl mRNA in the case of patients undergoing treatment with kinase inhibitors for CML; CM in the case of patients undergoing treatment for multiple myeloma). &gt; Long-term efficacy (progression-free survival, overall survival). &gt; Effect of FMD on circulating (blood) growth factors and adipokines, glucose, ketone bodies, and other metabolic parameters.</p>
        <p>In the NCT03340935 clinical trial, primary outcome was the safety of the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) in cancer patients (time frame: two years). Safety was assessed by recording each adverse (AE) occurring during the period on diet. All AEs were graded according to the NCI CTCAE v 4. The axis labels state the marker and fluorochrome used (e.g. CD4-FITC).</p>
        <p>The axis scales are clearly visible. Include numbers along axes only for bottom left plot of group (a 'group' is an analysis of identical markers).</p>

        <p>Extended Data Fig. 6 | STS conditions cooperate with ET to activate AMPK and to dampen oestrogen receptor transcriptional activity in BC cells. a, MCF7 cells transduced with a control vector, a PTEN-targeting shRNA or myr-AKT were plated into 6-well plates and cultured with or without STS conditions, TMX (5 μM), FULV (10 μM) or their combinations for 48 h. Afterwards, cells were subjected to protein lysate generation, and total and phosphorylated AMPK (Thr172) were detected by immunoblotting. The loading control for the immunoblots with PTEN-silenced MCF7 cells (vinculin) is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. The loading control for the immunoblots with myr-AKT-expressing MCF7 (GAPDH) is shown in Extended Data Fig. 5j. Both loading controls were run on the same gels that were used to detect total and phosphorylated AMPK. For gel source data, see Supplementary Fig. 1. b, MCF7 cells were plated into 24-well plates and transfected with a pGL3 promoter plasmid or with a pS2/TFF1 reporter vector containing 1.3 kb of the proximal promoter of the oestrogen-responsive gene TFF1 cloned in the pGL3-basic backbone. Afterwards, cells were cultured with or without STS, TMX (5 μM), FULV (10 μM) or their combinations for 48 h. Finally, luciferase reporter activity was measured. c, MCF7, T47D and ZR-75-1 cells were plated in 6-well plates and cultured with or without STS, TMX (5 μM) or their combinations for 48 h. Thereafter, cells were subjected to RNA extraction, and PGR, TFF1 and GREB1 expression was detected by qPCR. In a-c, one representative experiment out of three is presented. In b, c, data are from biological replicates and are presented as mean ± s.d. P values were determined by two-tailed Student's t-test.</p>
        <p>Extended Data Fig. 7 | FMD cooperates with ETs to induce cell cycle arrest in HR + BC. a-c, MCF7 cells were plated in 6-well plates and cultured with or without STS conditions, 5 μM tamoxifen (TMX) or their combination. After 24 h, RNA was isolated and used for gene expression microarray experiments (three biological replicates for each treatment condition were used). GSEA, represented by a heat map (a), was done by performing 10,000 permutations and using the REACTOME Pathways data set. Box plots (b) were generated using the 
            <rs type="software">ggplot2</rs> package; to evaluate the differences between the groups, a non-parametric two-sided Wilcoxon test was used. The box-plot centre lines indicate the median value. c, Enrichment scores for G1-specific transcription genes of STS + TMX versus CTR, STS, or TMX groups. NES: normalized enrichment score. d, MCF7, T47D and ZR-75-1 cells were treated with TMX (5 μM), STS or their combinations. After 48 h, cells were subjected to RNA extraction or protein lysate generation. E2F1, E2F2, CCND1 and CCNE1 mRNA expression was detected by qPCR. e, CCND1, phosphorylated (Ser807/811) and total RB protein and vinculin (on the same gel) were detected by immunoblotting in the MCF7 cells. f, Tumour masses from mice that were treated for 4 weeks with ad libitum diet (n = 5), FULV (n = 4), weekly 48 h FMD (n = 4) or their combination (n = 4) were isolated at the end of the last FMD cycle. CCND1 and vinculin (run on the same gel) were detected by immunoblotting (left). CCND1 levels were quantified and normalized to vinculin (right). n signifies the number of tumours isolated per treatment group. g, T47D and ZR-75-1 cells were cultured in vitro for 48 h with or without TMX (5 μM), STS conditions or their combination, and then used to generate protein lysates. Phosphorylated (Ser807/811) RB protein bands were quantified and normalized to total RB. In d, f (right), g, data are from biological replicates. In g (right), data were obtained through three independent experiments. In d-f (left), one representative experiment out of three (d, e) or out of two (f, left) is presented. In d, f, (right), g, data are presented as mean ± s.d. P values were determined by two-tailed Student's t-test. For gel source data, see Supplementary Fig. 1.

        <p>Extended Data Fig. 8 | Combined FMD and ET downregulate CCND1 via EGR1 upregulation and AKT inhibition and revert acquired resistance to fulvestrant plus palbociclib. a, b, MCF7, T47D and ZR-75-1 cells were plated into 96-well plates and cultured with or without TMX (5 μM) or FULV (10 μM), STS conditions or their combinations for 48 h. They were then subjected to cell cycle analysis by propidium iodide staining of isolated cell nuclei and flow cytometry. c, Upper panel, MCF7 cells were transduced with either a control scrambled shRNA or an EGR1-targeting shRNA (EGR1-shRNA#1); lower panel, MCF7 cells were transduced with a control vector or myr-AKT. Cells were cultured with or without TMX (5 μM) or FULV (10 μM), STS or their combinations for 48 h. Afterwards, cells were subjected to protein lysate generation, and CCND1 and vinculin (on the same gel) levels were detected by immunoblotting. For gel source data, see Supplementary Fig FULV + FMD (n = 6) or TMX + FMD (n = 7) for 2 weeks; 1 week after the end of the last FMD cycle, mice were killed, serum was isolated and serum C-peptide, IGF1 and leptin were measured by ELISA. g, h, MCF7 cells were injected into 6-8-week-old female BALB/c nude mice. Once tumours became palpable, mice were randomly assigned to be treated for 1 month with ad libitum diet (g, n = 9; h, n = 8), TMX (g, n = 9; h, n = 7), FULV (g, h, n = 9), FMD (g, n = 7), TMX + FMD (g, n = 9), FULV + FMD (g, n = 9), 48 h water-only fasting (h, n = 8), TMX + fasting (h, n = 14) or FULV + fasting (h, n = 10), followed by observation. Tumour volume (h) and mouse survival (g, h) were monitored. n, number of mice per treatment group (f, g) or of tumours per treatment group (h). In c-f, data are from biological replicates. In f, data are mean ± s.d. In h (left), data are mean ± s.e.m. In c-e, data were analysed by two-tailed Student's paired t-test. In f, P values were determined by two-tailed Student's t-test. In g, h (right), data were analysed by log-rank test. In h (left), results were analysed by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc test.</p>
