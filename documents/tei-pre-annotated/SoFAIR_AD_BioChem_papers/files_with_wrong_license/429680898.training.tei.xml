        <p>rganoids can be generated by guided differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells, or from cells isolated from adult tissues 1 . Adult stem cell (ASC)-derived organoids are self-organizing structures that recapitulate aspects of cellular composition, three-dimensional (3D) architecture and functionality of the different epithelial tissues from which they originate, while maintaining genomic stability 2,3 . The possibility to derive organoids from genetically modified mouse lines, especially knock-in models, has enabled the generation of engineered mouse organoids that have been used as versatile in vitro tools to answer various biological questions [4][5][6][7][8][9][10] .</p>
        <p>The generation of engineered human ASC-derived organoids requires that efficient strategies for in vitro genome editing are applied after the lines have been established. CRISPR-Cas9 technology has simplified genetic engineering considerably. To date, these approaches were largely limited to the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)-mediated introduction of indels into the endogenous loci of organoids, leading to gene mutations [11][12][13][14] . By harnessing the HDR pathway, a single-base substitution was introduced to correct the CFTR locus in cystic fibrosis intestinal organoids 15 , and a few human ASC-organoid knock-in reporter lines have been generated, but mostly in colon cancer organoids [16][17][18] .</p>
        <p>Knock-in using HDR takes advantage of a mechanism used by cells to repair double-stranded breaks (DSBs). Such breaks can be introduced at specific sites using CRISPR-Cas9. HDR is the most commonly used approach for targeted insertion, but this process is inefficient and requires cells to be in S phase 19,20 . Furthermore, HDR requires that the donor plasmid is cloned, owing to the necessity for the presence of homology arms specific to each gene (Fig. 1a). Recent studies have shown that CRISPR-induced DSBs activate the TP53 damage response and induce a transient cell-cycle arrest in untransformed cells 21 . Permanent or transient inactivation of TP53 increases HDR-mediated knock-in in pluripotent and hematopoietic stem cells 22,23 . Thus, given the demand for novel methods to improve HDR efficiency, inhibition of TP53 was suggested as a potential solution to overcome the low efficiency of HDR-mediated knock-in in untransformed cells 23 .</p>
        <p>NHEJ, another key DNA repair system, is active in all cell cycle phases 20 and, by ligating DNA ends, does not require regions of homology (Fig. 1a). As NHEJ is generally believed to be error prone, it is not widely used for precision transgene insertion. However, it has been suggested that NHEJ can be fundamentally accurate and can religate DNA ends without errors 24,25 . Indeed, a handful of studies have exploited NHEJ to ensure the targeted insertion of exogenous DNA into zebrafish 26 , mouse 27 , immortalized human cell lines 28,29 and embryonic stem cells 30 . Here we leverage NHEJ-mediated knock-in for use in the human organoid field-an approach named CRISPR-HOT-as a versatile, efficient and robust homology-independent method to obtain knock-in human wildtype organoids from different organs.</p>
        <p>CRISPR-HOT is a powerful strategy to efficiently generate knock-in human organoids. We first set out to test (1) the efficiency of the conventional HDR approach, (2) whether NHEJ can be used for precise genome editing and knock-in of exogenous DNA at specific genomic loci and (3) a side-by-side comparison of the two strategies. For HDR, we used donor plasmids containing a fluorescent tag (tdTomato or mNEON) flanked by 0.5 kb homology arms to C-terminally target KRT19 or TUBB in human liver</p>
        <p>ductal organoids and human hepatocyte organoids, respectively. For NHEJ, we utilized a universal targeting plasmid containing a fluorescent protein (mNEON) for C-terminal gene tagging (an overview and schematic representation of all of the targeting plasmids used in this study is provided in Extended Data Fig. 1). This plasmid is cleavable due to the upstream incorporation of a</p>
        <p>non-human sequence that can be recognized by a single guide RNA (sgRNA) and, therefore, mediates linearization of the plasmid by CRISPR-Cas9 (refs. 28,29 ). To promote in-frame knock-in, this nonhuman sequence can be targeted by three different sgRNAs (frame selectors). Each of these frame selectors mediates the cut in one of the three possible frames 28,29 . We tested this in two different-and difficult to transfecthuman organoid systems from the two main epithelial cell types of the liver (human liver ductal cells 31 and hepatocytes 32 ). All cells in liver ductal organoids abundantly express KRT19 (ref. 31 ). To test knock-in efficiencies at the KRT19 locus in human liver ductal organoids, we used a transfection method that we described recently 13 . For HDR, we used the HDR targeting plasmid, a plasmid expressing Cas9 and a fluorescent marker as a transfection readout, and a plasmid expressing a sgRNA inducing a DSB directly upstream of the KRT19 stop codon. For NHEJ, we used the universal NHEJ self-cleaving targeting plasmid, the same KRT19 sgRNA plasmid as described for HDR and the appropriate frame selector, which also expresses Cas9 and a fluorescent marker (mCherry) as a transfection readout. Five days after transfection, we observed some knocked-in cells in the HDR condition (mean ± s.d. = 0.55 ± 0.35%), as measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of knocked-in cells within the transfected population (transfection efficiency ranged from 0.2% to 0.7% in both HDR and NHEJ experiments). By contrast, we found that significantly more knockedin cells appeared when testing NHEJ-mediated gene insertion (mean ± s.d. = 5.53 ± 2.26%; Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 2a-c).</p>
        <p>We next tested the knock-in efficiencies by HDR and NHEJ in human hepatocyte organoids, targeting the TUBB locus. For this organoid system, we adapted a different transfection method, relying on cuvette electroporation. We again observed a considerably higher efficiency of NHEJ (mean ± s.d. = 40.23 ± 2.54%) compared with HDR-mediated knock-in (mean ±s.d. = 4.70 ± 0.15%) within the transfected population (transfection efficiency ranging from 9% to 14%; Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Outgrowing knocked-in organoids from both conditions displayed similar localization of the fluorescent signal, characteristic of TUBB expression patterns (Extended Data Fig. 2e). We named this NHEJ-mediated knock-in approach in organoids CRISPR-HOT.</p>
        <p>Recently, transient TP53 inhibition was shown to improve the efficiency of HDR in human pluripotent stem cells 22 and hematopoietic stem cells 23 . We therefore performed a direct comparison between HDR and CRISPR-HOT in the presence of transient TP53 inhibition by cotransfecting a dominant negative form of TP53 (DN TP53) 22,33 . Although the presence of DN TP53 increased HDR efficiency both in human liver ductal (absolute knock-in efficiency, mean ± s.d. = 1.56 ± 1.13%) and hepatocyte (absolute knock-in efficiency, mean ± s.d. = 8.18 ± 0.93%) organoids by twofold (Fig. 1b,c), it was still much lower than the efficiencies obtained using NHEJ (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Transient TP53 inhibition did not affect NHEJ-mediated knock-in efficiency (Fig. 1b,c). Notably, although absolute knock-in efficiencies between the two organoid systems was variable, relative fold changes between HDR, NHEJ, and the presence or absence of DN TP53 were remarkably similar (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Thus, these results demonstrate that CRISPR-HOT can mediate DNA insertion in human organoids at higher efficiency than previously used methods.</p>
        <p>We next evaluated the frequency at which DNA integration is precise when using CRISPR-HOT. To this end, we targeted two different loci, CDH1 and TUBB, in human hepatocyte organoids. After sorting transfected mCherry + cells using FACS, we quantified the proportion of outgrowing mNEON + and mNEON -organoids from these single cells. We then picked individual clonal organoids and sequenced both knocked-in mNEON + organoids as well as mNEON - organoids (Fig. 2a,b). When targeting CDH1, 33% of the organoids had precise in-frame knock-in; for TUBB, this proportion was 40%, levels that were comparable to our previous observation of knock-in efficiency at this locus (Fig. 2b compared with Fig. 1c), indicating that the vast majority of knocked-in cells also have the ability to grow out as organoids. Analysis of the mNEON -organoids revealed a small percentage of imprecise out-of-frame knock-in events due to the introduction of small indels (CDH1, 10%; TUBB, 3% of the total population), whereas the rest did not have insertions (both CDH1 and TUBB, 56% of the total population; Fig. 2b).</p>
        <p>Next, as the introduction of a Cas9-mediated DSB could generate indels in the allele that was not targeted by the knock-in event, we PCR-amplified and sequenced the DNA region around the cut site. By analysing five different loci that were targeted across two different human organoid systems (liver ductal and hepatocyte), indels were found at only two loci (CDH1, 12.5%; TUBB, 25%; Fig. 2c). Altogether these results show that it is possible to select for the desired genotype on both alleles on the basis of sequencing, and the likelihood to obtain the desired genotype is high. We next constructed a doubleframe selector strategy in which the tag of interest was flanked by two frame-selector cassettes on both the 5′ and 3′ ends such that the reading frame of the remaining 3′ end of the targeted gene can stay intact (Fig. 2d). As a proof of concept, we validated this approach by targeting TUBB with this double-frame plasmid in human hepatocyte organoids. We observed mNEON + organoids, and the sequencing of multiple independent clonal organoids revealed precise in-frame insertions at both the 5′ and 3′ ends of the inserted mNEON tag, therefore leaving the TUBB 3′ untranslated region intact (Fig. 2d). This double-frame selector strategy is an important asset that could also potentially be applied to tag genes at the N terminus. Taken together, CRISPR-HOT can mediate precise in-frame insertions with high efficiency while maintaining the second allele intact.</p>
        <p>We next evaluated whether we could derive clonal organoid lines from human liver ductal cells expressing endogenously tagged KRT19-mNEON. Two days after electroporation, transfected organoids were picked on the basis of transient mCherry expression from the frame-selector plasmid and dissociated into single cells to grow clonal lines 13 (Fig. 3a). Single knocked-in mNEON + organoids were picked and grown out as KRT19::mNEON clonal lines. Correct insertion at the KRT19 locus was validated by sequencing (Fig. 3b,c). As expected, mNEON expression was observed in every cell in KRT19::mNEON organoids. Staining for ZO-1 and actin confirmed that these knock-in organoids showed robust epithelial polarization, which is typical for human liver ductal organoids (Fig. 3c). Cytoplasmic cellular distribution was also in agreement with the expected KRT19 localization by antibody costaining (Fig. 3d).</p>
        <p>Another keratin, KRT18, was targeted as a second locus to validate the robustness of our approach. Again, precise in-frame integration was obtained when targeting this locus (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Expression of KRT18-mNEON was confined to the cytoplasm and high-resolution imaging confirmed labelling of intermediate filaments (Fig. 3e). Together, our data show that hard-to-transfect human liver ductal organoids can be genome-edited to generate clonal knock-in reporter lines using CRISPR-HOT.</p>
        <p>CRISPR-HOT enables labelling of rare intestinal cell types. We next tested whether CRISPR-HOT also works in other human organoid models from other organs. Human intestinal organoids can be induced to contain several differentiated cell types, mirroring the cell types present in the intestine in vivo 34,35 . In contrast to mouse intestinal organoids, differentiation of human intestinal organoids is less efficient 8,35</p>
        <p>sparse compared with mouse intestinal organoids. However, generation of reporter lines to identify and enrich for these human cell types can help studies to understand their functions and regulation.</p>
        <p>We tested CRISPR-HOT in human intestinal organoids by adapting a different transfection method based on cuvette electroporation of small clumps of cells 36 and sorting using FACS after 5-7 d (Fig. 4a). We targeted a broadly and constitutively expressed gene (CDH1) as well as two marker genes expressed in specific and rare cell types (CHGA for enteroendocrine cells and MUC2 for goblet cells). For CDH1, we were able to directly pick clonal knocked-in organoids that grew out after sorting (Fig. 4a). By contrast, for CHGA and MUC2, we used a short differentiation pulse (specific to the desired cell population) 8,37 , which could be reversed by switching the culture conditions back to expansion medium. This approach enables visualization of positive cells within one knocked-in organoid derived from one single cell that was sorted using FACS, which can be picked to establish clonal knock-in organoid lines (Fig. 4a). Accordingly, when we targeted the CDH1 locus, we could already identify knocked-in mNEON + cells within the transfected cells (transfection efficiency ranging from 1.6-2.6%) during FACS analysis (Fig. 4b). By contrast, as expected, we did not observe any mNEON + cells when targeting the CHGA or MUC2 locus (Fig. 4b) as fluorescence can be visualized only after induction of gene expression related to the differentiation into the respective cell type.</p>
        <p>The human intestinal organoids expressing endogenously tagged E-cadherin mNEON (E-CAD-mNEON) (mean ± s.d. = 28.6 ± 0.1% knock-in efficiency) could be picked and readily grown into CDH1::mNEON clonal lines. E-CAD-mNEON showed typical membrane expression in all of the KRT20 + enterocytes (Fig. 4c). For CHGA, we picked single knock-in organoids (mean ± s.d. = 20.2 ± 5.0% knock-in efficiency) on the basis of a short differentiation pulse using previously described enteroendocrine cell enrichment medium 8 , and established CHGA::mNEON clonal organoid lines. After expansion and subsequent differentiation, these organoids contained rare enteroendocrine (CHGA-mNEON + ) cells with fluorescently marked vesicles, i.e., secretory granules (Fig. 4d). These cells stained for CHGA protein, while a proportion also produced the neurotransmitter serotonin (Fig. 4d). For MUC2, we used a similar approach, but</p>
        <p>in this case used a differentiation pulse based on the addition of the Notch inhibitor DAPT 37 . Clonal organoid lines could be established and-after differentiation-contained cells expressing MUC2-mNEON showing the typical morphology of goblet cells (Fig. 4e). For all of the targeted loci, the derived lines showed precise in-frame knock-in, as confirmed by sequencing (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c), altogether validating the robustness of CRISPR-HOT.</p>
        <p>We next evaluated whether we could establish clonal lines from CRISPR-HOT knocked-in human hepatocytes. Organoids were first dissociated into single cells and then transfected using cuvette electroporation (Fig. 5a). We picked the knocked-in organoids that grew after transfection on the basis of fluorescence and established clonal lines. First, we successfully targeted AFP, a gene that is exclusively expressed in hepatocyte organoids by almost all cells 32 , and generated clonal AFP::mNEON lines (Fig. 5b, Extended Data Fig. 3d). These organoids showed typical hepatocyte morphological features, such as the formation of bile canalicular networks, as visualized by MRP2 staining (Fig. 5b). AFP in these organoids had the same pattern of expression visualized by antibody staining, yet the AFP-mNEON signal appeared to have higher signal resolution (Fig. 5b).</p>
        <p>Similar to the intestinal organoids, we were able to derive clonal CDH1::mNEON hepatocyte lines (Fig. 5c). The presence</p>
        <p>of the endogenously tagged CDH1 enabled us to trace cell movement and dynamics. Analyses of time-lapse videos revealed that hepatocytes tend to organize around a central lumen and rotate around it while forming 'rosette structures' in the organoids (Extended Data Fig. 4). We also established clonal TUBB-tagged hepatocyte organoids as a tool for tracing real-time mitotic spindle dynamics of proliferating hepatocytes (Fig. 5d, Extended Data Fig. 3e). Being able to generate lines with simultaneous tagging of more than one locus could be a major advantage for tracking such detailed and shortlived cellular changes. As concomitant visualization of the cell membrane and mitotic spindle would enable a more refined analysis of division events, we sequentially tagged CDH1 with tdTomato in a TUBB::mNEON hepatocyte organoid line (Fig. 5a) and derived double knocked-in TUBB::mNEON; CDH1::tdTomato clonal lines (Fig. 5e, Extended Data Fig. 3f).</p>
        <p>Hepatocytes in the liver are organized in a peculiar manner that reflects features of stratified, as well as monolayered (simple), epithelia 38 . The positioning of mitotic spindle and the establishment of proper polarity and tissue organization are known to be linked, although exactly how this works in the liver is still a matter of debate 39,40 . A recent study underscored that proper tissue architecture ensures correct mitotic spindle behaviour. Two-dimensional (2D) cultures of dissociated epithelial cells display defects in mitotic spindle behaviour as compared with what is observed when the same cells are cultured in a 3D configuration 41 . Human hepatocyte</p>
        <p>organoids retain cellular polarization, with an apical domain defined by the expression of MRP2 and ZO-1 (ref. 32 ), facing the internal bile canaliculus (Fig. 5b). Our lines expressing endogenously tagged TUBB enabled us to analyse the behaviour of mitotic spindle in non-transformed human hepatocytes within a 3D structure. We performed time-lapse analyses (Supplementary Video 1)</p>
        <p>and measured changes in spindle position as defined by the angle of rotation of spindle axis over time from metaphase to telophase (Fig. 6a, Extended Data Fig. 5a). We noticed that the spindle position is not static but, rather, can vary considerably. In particular, we observed that spindles that have a similar position in prometaphase and cytokinesis (arbitrarily defined as a difference of less than a 45°</p>
        <p>angle between the two stages) hardly rotate (Fig. 6b, top). By contrast, spindles that change their axis between prometaphase and cytokinesis tended to rotate considerably over time (Fig. 6b, bottom), possibly trying to reach a specific orientation. Moreover, we measured the spindle position over time relative to the apical domain, which could be visualized by the presence of internal lumina. For this analysis, we defined the spindle axis and considered the angle that it forms with the apical side (Fig. 6c,d). The orientation of the spindle seemed to be random at prometaphase and during the subsequent mitotic stages, before cytokinesis, the orientation of the spindle consistently ended up within an angle between 0° and 45° relative to the apical side (Fig. 6e). Importantly, these conclusions were derived from multiple independent experiments using two donors that displayed similar behaviour. Taken together, these observations suggest that, at telophase, the position of the spindle is not random and that hepatocytes dividing next to a lumen undergo symmetric division with respect to the apicobasal axis, as confirmed by time-lapse analysis of cell division in the CDH1::mNEON line (Fig. 6f).</p>
        <p>The liver is characterized by the presence of polyploid hepatocytes. These cells generally tend to increase in number with age and after injury 42 . Previous studies have suggested that polyploid hepatocytes predominantly originate from incomplete cytokinesis 43,44 . Using our double TUBB::mNEON; CDH1::tdTomato hepatocyte organoid knock-in line, we observed (Supplementary Video 2) that the vast majority of mitotic events (&gt;95%) originated from diploid hepatocyte division (Fig. 6g). In a small percentage of events (2-3%), we observed the formation of a binucleated cell from the division of a mononucleated cell. Interestingly, although the daughter cells appeared to be segregated-as marked by an initial formation of an E-CAD-tdTomato + cell membrane separating the two-this transient border disappeared, resulting in a binucleated cell (Fig. 6g). We observed extremely rare (&lt;1%) mitotic events encompassing the division of binucleated cells through a three-polar spindle. Division resulted in the formation of a mononucleated and binucleated cell (Fig. 6g). In these cases, the formation of the binucleated cell was also preceded by a transient E-CAD-tdTomato + border between two of the daughter cells (Fig. 6g). In addition to rare multipolar spindles, we noted occasional formation of monopolar spindles, but such cells did not complete division and eventually died (Extended Data Fig. 5b-d).</p>
        <p>Loss of TP53 induces aberrant mitotic spindle behaviour in human hepatocytes. TP53 is critical for maintaining genomic stability, and loss of TP53 is associated with increased polyploidy and aneuploidy 45,46 . However, the specific role of TP53 in the behaviour of mitotic spindle is not fully understood. Here we combined CRISPR-HOT with CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene knock-out to study the impact of loss of TP53 in our human hepatocyte lines expressing tagged TUBB (Fig. 7a). TP53-mutated organoids were picked on the basis of resistance to Nutlin-3a, clonally expanded and subsequently sequenced, revealing the presence of frameshift indels (Fig. 7a). When performing time-lapse analyses on these clonal lines, we frequently observed hepatocyte divisions associated with the formation of non-canonical mitotic spindles (Fig. 7b-f, Extended Data Fig. 6, Supplementary Video 3). In particular, we detected an increase in multipolar spindle formation that seemed to result from the division of hepatocytes with increased ploidy (Fig. 7c, Extended Data Fig. 6). In contrast to wild-type hepatocyte organoids, we observed the presence of polyploid hepatocytes with increased nuclei (3-4) per cell in these TP53deficient organoids, which retained the ability to divide (Fig. 7c). Moreover, microtubules frequently appeared to be disorganized, for example, leading to a transient collapse of the mitotic spindle, yet these cells continued to divide (Fig. 7d, Extended Data Fig. 6). We observed these aberrations in multiple clonal TP53 -/-hepatocyte lines expressing tagged TUBB from two different donors. Notably, division of hepatocytes with these non-canonical mitotic spindles was not associated with loss of the internal lumina, neither did the loss of TP53 change proliferation rates (Extended Data Fig. 7a-c). Together, these results imply that TP53 is of critical importance for the integrity of mitotic spindle and its loss is associated with the formation and division of polyploid hepatocytes.</p>
        <p>Here we show that NHEJ can consistently mediate precise gene insertion with high efficiency in human organoids derived from different tissues. The strategy outperforms HDR, even when combined with transient TP53 inhibition. Importantly, as the knock-in efficiencies were assessed in wild-type primary human cells, they probably reflect the activities of these DNA repair pathways in vivo. These results are therefore more representative than the ones obtained in immortalized cell lines with highly divergent genomes. NHEJ-mediated knock-in appeared to be extremely precise, as observed in few studies previously 25 . Furthermore, in the majority of cases the other allele appeared to be intact.</p>
        <p>By exploiting this mechanism of cellular DNA repair, we were able to target different loci in organoids derived from multiple healthy human tissues (Extended Data Fig. 8). This was not restricted to tagging highly expressed genes-we could also tag non-constitutively expressed markers for rare cell types. To further facilitate this, we constructed different targeting plasmids that have a built-in selection strategy under the control of an independent promoter (Extended Data Fig. 1). This could help with the selection of knock-in events at non-constitutively expressed loci, of which expression cannot be induced by transient differentiation as performed in this study for CHGA and MUC2. In principle, such a build-in selection strategy could be important in the case of tagging genes with non-fluorescent tags.</p>
        <p>Previously, there has been attention to analysing the mode of division of hepatocytes to understand how the peculiar hepatocyte polarity in the liver is created and maintained 38 . Our double TUBB::mNEON; CDH1::tdTomato organoid reporter line enabled us to observe the division process in wild-type human hepatocytes in real time, which was previously possible only in immortalized cell lines 39,40 . We observed rare cases of the formation and division of polyploid hepatocytes, which appeared to involve transient formation of a membrane between the daughter cells that precedes a subsequent fusion event. Previous analyses of the division of 2D-cultured primary mouse hepatocytes suggested that polyploid hepatocytes can divide and reduce their ploidy by formation of multipolar spindles, known as reductive mitosis 47,48 . Our observations confirm binucleated hepatocyte division as a rare event but, rather, suggest maintenance of the polyploid state. These discrepancies could be due to differences in 2D versus 3D culturing of the cells that have been shown to induce missegregation 41 or, alternatively, due to differences between mice and humans.</p>
        <p>We also show that CRISPR-HOT can be multiplexed with gene knock-out. It has previously been shown that TP53 is involved in regulating hepatocyte ploidy in homeostasis and after liver damage in mice 49 . We found that loss of TP53 facilitates the division of polyploid cells and promotes abnormal mitotic spindle behaviour, which could result in aneuploidy. Although aneuploidy is frequently associated with cancer, aneuploidy in the liver has been speculated to promote adaptation to liver injury 50 . However, the causal relationship between TP53 mutation and mitotic spindle aberrations suggests that the consequent aneuploidy may be linked to hepatocarcinogenesis.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, CRISPR-HOT is a versatile strategy that can be used to achieve fast and efficient gene knock-in in human wildtype organoids. This approach is applicable to other human cell models, such as organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells. Although successful knock-in has already been achieved in these systems using conventional HDR approaches [51][52][53] , the use of a homology-independent-based strategy may increase the efficiency of knock-in generation.

Isolation, generation and culture of human hepatocytes were performed as described previously 32 . Human liver biopsies were obtained from anonymous healthy liver donors (age and gender not disclosed) at Erasmus MC Rotterdam with informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Dutch law. Isolation, generation and human liver ductal organoids were performed as described previously 31 . Human ileal tissue (male, 37 years) was obtained from UMC Utrecht with informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Dutch law. Biopsies were taken from the normal mucosa of a resected intestinal segment from an ileal neuroendocrine tumour. Human small intestinal crypts were isolated, processed and cultured as described previously 34 .</p>
        <p>Intestinal organoids were cultured in standard culture conditions (ENR medium) 32 . Differentiation was achieved by supplementing ENR medium with γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT (10 μM, Sigma Aldrich; for goblet cell enrichment), or by adding DAPT (10 μM, Sigma Aldrich) and the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 (500 nM; Sigma Aldrich) and withdrawing the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190, the TGF-β inhibitor A83-01, nicotinamide and Wnt-conditioned medium from the ENR (for enteroendocrine cell enrichment), as described previously 8 . The collection of available tissue from patients or healthy donors with informed consent was approved by the Dutch Ethical Medical Councils (UMC Utrecht, Erasmus MC Rotterdam and Leiden University MC).</p>
        <p>For the electroporation of human intestinal, hepatocyte and liver ductal organoids, different plasmids were used. The sgRNAs for the different targeted genes were cloned into the vector pSPgRNA (Addgene plasmid 47108) using a protocol that was described previously 54 . Oligo sequences for each sgRNA were as follows: AFP fwd, 5′-CACCGTGCAGATTTCTCAGGCCTGT-3′; AFP rev, 5′-AAACACAGGCCTGAGAAATCTGCAC-3′; CDH1 fwd, 5′-CACCGAGGCGG CGAGGACGACTAG-3′; CDH1 rev, 5′-AAACCTAGTCGTCCTCGCCGCCTC-3′; CHGA fwd, 5′-CACCGCAGCTGCAGGCACTACGGCG-3′; CHGA rev, 5′-AAAC CGCCGTAGTGCCTGCAGCTGC-3′; KRT18 fwd, 5′-CACCGCCAATGACAC CAAAGTTCTG-3′; KRT18 rev, 5′-AAACCAGAACTTTGGTGTCATTGGC-3′; KRT19 fwd, 5′-CACCGCCCAGAGCCTGCTGCCTCAG-3′; KRT19 rev, 5′-AAA CCTGAGGCAGCAGGCTCTGGGC-3′; MUC2 fwd, 5′-CACCGCATCTGGGG AGCGGGTGAGC-3′; MUC2 rev, 5′-AAACGCTCACCCGCTCCCCAGATGC-3′; TUBB fwd, 5′-CACCGAGGCGGCGAGGACGACTA-3′; TUBB rev, 5′-AAACTA GGCCTCCTCTTCGGCCTC-3′. The frame-selector plasmids containing a sgRNA that linearizes the donortargeting construct, the Cas9 and mCherry for detection of electroporated cells were obtained from Addgene (plasmids 66939, 66940 and 66941). The GFP and mNEON targeting vectors were obtained from V. Hornung 29 . All other targeting constructs (for both HDR and NHEJ) used in this study are shown in Extended Data Fig. 1 and were either designed and cloned in this study. For the HDR targeting constructs, the tags were flanked by homology arms (length, 0.5 kb) for the specific genomic regions. To study the effect of transient TP53 inhibition on knock-in efficiency, a plasmid encoding a dominant negative form of TP53 (DN TP53; Addgene, 41856) was cotransfected with the respective plasmids.</p>
        <p>Organoid transfection and generation of knock-in lines. Transfection of human liver ductal organoids was performed using an electroporation-based protocol that was described previously 13 . In brief, the organoids were co-electroporated with the appropriate sgRNA plasmid, the frame selector plasmid and the targeting plasmid. Then, 2 d after electroporation, the transfected organoids were picked on the basis of mCherry expression (from the frame selector plasmid) and dissociated into single cells with accutase (Life technologies, 00-4555-56) and replated in a BME R (AMSBIO, 3533-005-02) drop. Growing knocked-in organoids (determined on the basis of fluorescence expression) were picked and used to establish clonal knocked-in organoid lines. Wnt-surrogate 55 (0.15 nM, U-Protein Expression) and Rho Kinase inhibitor Y27632 (10 μM, Calbiochem) were added to the medium whenever cells were at the single-cell stage to help recovery. For genotyping, organoids were lysed using a lysis buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 0.2 M NaCl, 0.2% SDS, 0.05 M EDTA, 0.4 mg ml -1 Proteinase K) and DNA was isolated by ethanol precipitation. PCR amplification followed by sequencing was used to confirm proper knock-in at the targeted locus. To analyse knock-in efficiency, cells from the different samples were isolated from the BME R , digested into single cells with accutase and used for FACS analysis (FACS Aria, BD). DAPI was used to identify live cells. 
            <rs type="software">FlowJo</rs> software was used for data analyses.

        <p>Transfection of human hepatocyte organoids was performed by cuvette electroporation. Organoids were collected from 2 wells out of a 12-well plate and were dissociated into single cells/small clumps using accutase. After two washes with PBS, organoids were resuspended in 150 μl of Opti-MEM and supplemented with the plasmids (10 μg total dissolved in 20 μl of PBS) and transferred into a 2 mm cuvette. Electroporation was performed using the following parameters on the NEPA21 electroporator: Poring Pulse (Voltage = 175 V, Pulse Length = 7.5 msec, Pulse Interval = 50 msec, Number of Pulse = 2), Transfer Pulse (Voltage = 20 V, Pulse Length = 50 msec, Pulse Interval = 50 msec, Number of Pulse = 5). Complete medium supplemented with Rho Kinase inhibitor Y27632 (10 μΜ, Calbiochem) was added to the cuvette. The cells were allowed to recover for 30 min, after which they were seeded in BME R . Growing knocked-in organoids (determined on the basis of fluorescence expression) were picked and used to establish clonal human hepatocyte knock-in lines. To generate the TP53-mutant hepatocyte organoid lines, organoids expressing endogenously tagged TUBB were electroporated with a TP53sgRNA-Cas9-GFP plasmid 11 and clonal organoids with inactive TP53 were selected based on Nutlin-3a resistance by adding 10 μΜ Nutlin-3a (Cayman Chemicals, 548472-68-0) to the medium. Clonal lines were established and each line was genotyped to confirm the presence of biallelic TP53 mutations. Three clonal TP53 -/-lines from two hepatocyte lines expressing tagged TUBB originating from two different donors were generated. For knock-in efficiency analysis, hepatocyte organoids were similarly electroporated and, 3 d after electroporation, cells were recovered from the BME R and used for FACS analysis (FACS Aria, BD). DAPI was used to identify live cells. FlowJo was used for data analyses. Alternatively, to determine the preciseness of gene knock-in at the two different loci (CDH1 and TUBB), single transfected cells were sorted using FACS and seeded in BME R to grow out as single clonal organoids. Fluorescence images of entire 24-well plates were acquired and the number of fluorescence-positive and -negative organoids were quantified. Representative positive and negative organoids were picked and screened for their genotype using PCR amplification and subsequent sequencing.</p>
        <p>Transfection of human intestinal organoids was performed by cuvette electroporation of a single well of a 12-well plate as described previously 36 using a NEPA21 electroporator (Nepa Gene). Then, 3-5 d after electroporation, single transfected cells were sorted using FACS (FACS Aria, BD) on the basis of transient expression of mCherry from the frame selector plasmid and seeded in BME R . To generate knock-in lines of constitutively expressed genes, single growing organoids were picked on the basis of fluorescence to establish clonal lines. For the nonconstitutively expressed genes, that is, MUC2 and CHGA, a differentiation pulse of 24 h with the respective differentiation medium (compositions described above) was used. Single organoids showing a few fluorescence-positive induced cells were picked and transferred to expansion (ENR) medium for subsequent clonal line generation. In these clonal lines, differentiation to enrich for the specific differentiated intestinal cell types was performed by a switch from ENR to the respective differentiation medium for 5 d.</p>
        <p>All of the knock-in organoid lines from the different organs were confirmed for their genotype by PCR amplification and subsequent sequencing. The generation of knock-in lines at different loci was repeated multiple times (more than three experiments) from at least two independent donors for human liver ductal and hepatocyte organoids, and one donor for human small intestinal organoids. A protocol to generate knock-in organoids is available at Protocol Exchange 56 .</p>
        <p>Whole-mount immunofluorescence. For whole-mount immunofluorescence staining, organoids were isolated from the BME R using Cell Recovery Solution (Corning), fixed for 30 min to 1 h in 4% PFA, permeabilized, and blocked by incubation in 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5% normal donkey serum (Jackson Laboratories) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Alternatively, staining was performed directly in the culture plate without dissociation of the BME R drop and following the same procedure. Primary antibodies were incubated at 4 °C overnight. The antibodies used in this study were as follows: anti-AFP rabbit polyclonal 1:250 (Thermo Fisher Scientific PA5-16658), anti-chromogranin A rabbit polyclonal 1:200 (Labnet, LN1401487), anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Asp 175) rabbit polyclonal 1:400 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9661L), anti-E-cadherin mouse monoclonal 1:200 (BD Bioscience, 610182), anti-keratin19 mouse monoclonal 1:200 (Cell Signalling, 4558S), anti-keratin20 mouse monoclonal 1:200 (Neomarkers, MS-377-S1), anti-MRP2 mouse monoclonal 1:100 (Abcam, ab3373), anti-serotonin goat polyclonal 1:200 (Abcam, ab66047), anti-ZO-1 rabbit polyclonal 1:200 (Life technology, 402200). After washing with PBS, Alexa Fluorconjugated secondary antibodies 1:1,000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A10037, A10042 and A31573) were added for 1 h at room temperature. Phalloidin-Atto 647N 1:1,000 (Sigma Aldrich, 65906) was used for actin staining. DAPI was used to counterstain nuclei. Organoids were mounted and imaged using an Sp8 confocal microscope (Leica). The images were processed using

            <rs type="version">CS4</rs> or 
            <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs>. Imaris was used for the 3D-reconstruction and visualization of images. Time-lapse imaging. For time-lapse microscopy imaging, organoids were passaged 2 d before imaging and seeded onto glass-bottom plates (Greiner, 662892). All imaging was performed using an Sp8 confocal microscope (Leica), which was continuously held at 37 °C and equipped with a culture chamber for overflow of 5% CO 2 , except for one single experiment, where organoids were imaged using a spinning disk microscope (Nikon). Imaging of the CDH1-, TUBB-, and double CDH1/TUBB-tagged hepatocyte organoids was performed for up to 72 h, with acquisition intervals of 5 min or 15 min and z-stack steps of 4 μm. For fluorescence detection, we used minimal amounts of excitation light. ImageJ was used to assemble the videos and for image analysis. At least two different clonal lines were imaged and four independent imaging experiments were performed. Quantification of mitosis and types of non-canonical mitotic spindles was performed on the imaging of 15 organoids from the 3 different clonal lines

        <p>Imaging analysis. To analyse mitotic spindle, every spindle that was visible at any xy-plane was analysed. The coordinates of both ends of the spindle (spindle poles) were manually tracked over time. The spindle was tracked from the moment that both ends were clearly separated (metaphase) to the moment just before the spindle disappeared (telophase). The 2D orientation of the line segment between both ends was calculated for each time point, ignoring the z coordinate of the ends. For all spindles that were clearly rotating next to an internal lumen, the position on the edge of the lumen closest to the spindle was manually recorded. The rotation of mitotic spindles in the TUBB-tagged organoids was analysed using custom-written Python 
            <rs type="software">scripts</rs> (available from the corresponding author on request). Analysis of modes of cell division in the double CDH1/TUBB-tagged line was performed by tracing single mitotic events using

        </p>
        <p>Cell movement in the CHD1-tagged organoids was traced manually. The position of the cell centroid was determined on the basis of cell membrane labelling and was registered at every time point. The cells were selected such that every part of the organoid had its motion sampled. Arrows were then drawn from the position of a cell centroid at the first time point, pointing to its position at the last time point. For presentation purposes, the arrows indicate their 2D orientation, ignoring the z position of the cells. Absolute average cell rotation degrees were calculated by averaging the movement of single cells within one organoid.</p>
