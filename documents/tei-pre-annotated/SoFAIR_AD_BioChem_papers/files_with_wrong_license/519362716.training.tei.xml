        <p>Phenylketonuria (PKU), caused by variants in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene, is the most common autosomal-recessive Mendelian phenotype of amino acid metabolism. We estimated that globally 0.45 million individuals have PKU, with global prevalence 1:23,930 live births (range 1:4,500 [Italy]-1:125,000 [Japan]). Comparing genotypes and metabolic phenotypes from 16,092 affected subjects revealed differences in disease severity in 51 countries from 17 world regions, with the global phenotype distribution of 62% classic PKU, 22% mild PKU, and 16% mild hyperphenylalaninemia. A gradient in genotype and phenotype distribution exists across Europe, from classic PKU in the east to mild PKU in the southwest and mild hyperphenylalaninemia in the south. The c.1241A&gt;G (p.Tyr414Cys)-associated genotype can be traced from Northern to Western Europe, from Sweden via Norway, to Denmark, to the Netherlands. The frequency of classic PKU increases from Europe (56%) via Middle East (71%) to Australia (80%). Of 758 PAH variants, c.1222C&gt;T (p.Arg408Trp) (22.2%), c.1066À11G&gt;A (IVS10À11G&gt;A) (6.4%), and c.782G&gt;A (p.Arg261Gln) (5.5%) were most common and responsible for two prevalent genotypes: p.[Arg408Trp];[Arg408Trp] (11.4%) and c.[1066À11G&gt;A];[1066À11G&gt;A] (2.6%). Most genotypes (73%) were compound heterozygous, 27% were homozygous, and 55% of 3,659 different genotypes occurred in only a single individual. PAH variants were scored using an allelic phenotype value and correlated with pre-treatment blood phenylalanine concentrations (n ¼ 6,115) and tetrahydrobiopterin loading test results (n ¼ 4,381), enabling prediction of both a genotype-based phenotype (88%) and tetrahydrobiopterin responsiveness (83%). This study shows that large genotype databases enable accurate phenotype prediction, allowing appropriate targeting of therapies to optimize clinical outcome.Phenylketonuria (PKU), caused by variants in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene, is the most common autosomal-recessive Mendelian phenotype of amino acid metabolism.

        <p>More than 1,180 bi-allelic variants in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene located on chromosome 12q22-24.1 have been identified. 1 These autosomal-recessive inherited variants lead to deficiency in the PAH enzyme, which hydroxylates phenylalanine to tyrosine, with the help of a cofactor (tetrahydrobiopterin; BH 4 ), molecular oxygen, and non-heme iron. 2 The metabolic picture is highly heterogenous as it depends on the degree of residual PAH activity and blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations. Lower residual enzyme activity usually results in higher blood Phe concentrations and a more severe clinical phenotype if left untreated. 3 The severity of PKU is defined by daily Phe tolerance. 4 Standard classification is according to the pre-treatment blood Phe concentration and daily dietary Phe tolerance, ranging from the severe classical PKU (cPKU) with pretreatment blood Phe concentrations of &gt;1,200 mmol/L to mild PKU (mPKU) with pre-treatment blood Phe concentrations of 600-1,200 mmol/L and mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP) with pre-treatment Phe blood concentrations of 120-600 mmol/L. 1,5 Untreated PKU generally results in global developmental delay or severe irreversible intellectual disability, as well as growth failure, hypopigmentation, motor deficits, ataxia, and seizures. 1 The population of PKU-affected individuals is heterogeneous in terms of treatment history and diet compliance. 5,6 Early diagnosis and treatment with a low-Phe diet has enabled an almost normal life for the majority of PKU subject. 7 Pharmacological treatment with BH 4 (sapropterin) and enzyme substitution therapy with Phe ammonia lyase (PAL) provide alternative treatment options for some PKU subjects. 8 PKU is one of the most frequent inherited disorders in Europeans, with an incidence of roughly 1:10,000 live births in the USA, 9 although the prevalence of PKU varies significantly among ethnicities and geographic regions worldwide. In Europe, the incidence of PKU ranges from 1:850 in the Karachay-Cherkess Republic (Russia) 10 to only 1:112,000 live births in Finland. 11 PKU occurs less often in Japan, with an incidences of 1:125,000. 12 A large number of PAH variants give rise to a wide scale of residual PAH enzyme activities that correspond to different PKU phenotypes. 13,14 Associations between genotypes and in vitro residual PAH activity have been documented for many PAH variants. 3 Therefore, the molecular genetics of PKU and genotype-based phenotype prediction may be clinically useful, particularly where treatment recommendations are unclear (e.g., due to borderline blood phenylalanine concentrations) or for genetic counseling of patients' families.More than 1,180 bi-allelic variants in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene located on chromosome 12q22-24.1 have been identified. 1 These autosomal-recessive inherited variants lead to deficiency in the PAH enzyme, which hydroxylates phenylalanine to tyrosine, with the help of a cofactor (tetrahydrobiopterin; BH 4 ), molecular oxygen, and non-heme iron. 2 The metabolic picture is highly heterogenous as it depends on the degree of residual PAH activity and blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations.

        <p>The major goal of this study was the analysis of a large database of PKU phenotype and genotype to elucidate the current distribution of PKU worldwide and to create an overview of the severity of PAH variants, genotypes, and the resulting phenotypes, in various geographic regions and respective countries. Furthermore, this work improves the accuracy of genotypic phenotype prediction by the use of the allelic phenotype value (APV) value and the genotypic BH 4 responsiveness prediction.The major goal of this study was the analysis of a large database of PKU phenotype and genotype to elucidate the current distribution of PKU worldwide and to create an overview of the severity of PAH variants, genotypes, and the resulting phenotypes, in various geographic regions and respective countries.

        <p>The BIOPKU database encompasses information about more than 16,900 PKU-affected subjects from 51 countries, providing information on genotypes, corresponding metabolic phenotypes, BH 4 responsiveness (where reported), and highest blood Phe concentrations before starting treatment (where reported). Individual information was collected from the published literature or anonymized records submitted online. Phenotype information was unknown for 690 subjects. Data in the database are anonymized and cannot be traced back to the families. Purpose of the database was to provide an online search tool for reported PAH variants or genotypes, with an output summarizing the number of records, phenotype distribution, BH 4 responsiveness, and regional and counties distribution. As mentioned above, BIOPKU is linked with the PAHvdb, thus providing additional information including allelic phenotype values (APV).

        <p>Since not all countries use the same nomenclature for the severity of PAH deficiency, in this study the following three metabolic phenotype groups were used: classical PKU (cPKU; pre-treatment blood Phe &gt; 1,200 mmol/L); mild PKU (mPKU; pre-treatment blood Phe 600-1,200 mmol/L), and mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP; pre-treatment blood Phe 120-600). Subjects with a moderate PKU (pre-treatment blood Phe 900-1,200 mmol/L) were included in the mPKU group and MHP included MHP-no treatment (blood Phe 120-360 mmol/L) and MHP-gray zone (360-600 mmol/L) categories.

        <p>APV is a value defining the association of a variant with the corresponding metabolic phenotype, thus defining its severity. APV was calculated for variants occurring in a functionally hemizygous constellation (i.e., in a combination with an inactive null allele) in at least five subjects. 15 APVs range between 0 and 10, with following classifying definitions cPKU (APV ¼ 0-2.7), mPKU (APV ¼ 2.8-6.6), and MHP (APVs 6.7-10). 15 The genotypic phenotype value (GPV) was calculated from the APVs of both alleles and was assigned to a higher APV (APV max ). This calculation was based on the fact that the milder variant (with a higher APV) is always dominant over the severe one. 15,16 Possible effects of interallelic complementation and epigenetic factors, which may influence the phenotype, 17,18 were not considered in this study.APV is a value defining the association of a variant with the corresponding metabolic phenotype, thus defining its severity.

A total of 16,196 records with a complete genotype information (variant 1 and 2 known) were analyzed. Two linear discriminant analyses (LDA) were computed: the first LDA was computed to predict the clinical phenotype (cPKU, mPKU, and MHPA) from an individual's GPV, and the second LDA was computed to predicted BH 4 responsiveness by GPV value from untested individuals in BIOPKU.

        <p>Prevalence of PKU Based on the literature search and reports from national screening centers, the prevalence of PKU was estimated for 64 countries. For parts of Africa, Asia, South America, and Caribbean there was no information. The estimated total number of PKU subjects (all phenotypes) from those 64 countries in 2018 was 360,466. For the remaining 257 countries we were unable to find credible PKU prevalence sources; we used the average regional prevalence of 64 countries, multiplied by their populations, resulting in an additional 94,114 PKU-affected individuals (total about 0.45 million PKU subjects).

        <p>Reports from individual regions are summarized in Table 2 and below. Europe Variant p.Arg408Trp was the most common (AF ¼ 63.7%) throughout Europe, followed by c.1066À11G&gt;A (AF ¼ 11%) and p.Arg261Gln (AF ¼ 11%). Eastern Europe had the highest AF for p.Arg408Trp (54.6%), mostly with homozygous genotype p. The distribution of patients with p.Arg408Trp on at least one allele (compound heterozygotes and homozygotes) decreased from 98% in Estonia to 89% in Poland, 76% in Russia, 69% in Slovakia, 65% in Czechia, 40% in Austria, 36% in Germany, 10% in France, 6% in Italy, to only 4% in Spain (Table 3, Figure 5). Genotypes with the c.1066À11G&gt;A splice site variant occurred commonly in The American Journal of Human Genetics 107, 234-250, August 6, 2020 241 Armenia (48%), Turkey (32%), Iran (26%), Israel (21%), Spain (20%), and Italy (19%) (Table 4, Figure 5). The prevalence of p.Arg261Gln was 10%-30% in most countries. PKU phenotypes were more evenly distributed in Southern Europe (39.5% cPKU, 36.6% MHP, 23.9% mPKU), and milder phenotypes were more predominant, e.g., 37% had MHP in Italy. This was consistent with a high frequency of variants with a substantial residual PAH activity, e.g., c.1208C&gt;T (p.Ala403Val; AF ¼ 8.4), c.898G&gt;T (p.Ala300Ser; AF ¼ 3.6), c.734T&gt;C (p.Val245Ala; AF ¼ 2.4), or c.1241A&gt;G (p.Tyr414Cys; AF ¼ 2.4). Variants c.1066À11G&gt;A and p.Arg261Gln, often called the ''Mediterranean mutation,'' accounted for majority of mutant alleles, and the most frequent genotype was c.[1066À11G&gt;A];[1066À11G&gt;A] (GF ¼ 5.2%). In Portugal and Italy, c.1066À11G&gt;A and p.Arg261Gln occurred at similar rates (AF ¼ 16.2% and AF ¼ 10.7%, respectively).

        <p>The aim of this study was to elucidate the prevalence of PKU and distribution of causative PAH variants worldwide and in different countries. We provided a rough estimation of global PKU prevalence by calculating the number of affected patients for countries based on the provided PKU prevalence and the total population in 2018 (see UN World Population Prospects in Web Resources) and an average prevalence for countries not employing newborn screening for PKU. Overall, it appears that there are about 0.45 million PKU-affected individuals worldwide, of whom at least two thirds have PKU that requires treatment (most subjects had a severe, cPKU phenotype). An improvement in early diagnosis via NBS in countries still lacking it should be an urgent priority. With the multiple allelic combinations generated by so many mutations, a full descrip-tion of all genotype/phenotype correlations is impossible in this report. Nevertheless, it is clear that for many allelic combinations, often the most common in a region or country, such correlations are possible as detailed in the final three sections in the Results along with Table 2 and Figure S4. Recognizing these relationships is important for counseling parents now that newborn screening predominates diagnosis of this disorder, particularly in instances when treatment recommendations are unclear (e.g., due to borderline blood Phe levels).The aim of this study was to elucidate the prevalence of PKU and distribution of causative PAH variants worldwide and in different countries.

        <p>Although PKU has been found to be most common in European populations, 9 its similar prevalence in certain Middle Eastern countries (particularly Turkey and Iran) was a remarkable finding. 23,24 A possible contributing factor may be the frequency of consanguinity in Islamic cultures, especially marriages between first cousins, which would favor the autosomal-recessive inheritance of PKU. 25 Prevalence and consanguinity was missing for many countries, making it more difficult to assess this hypothesis. 26 We identified 758 different (previously reported) PKU variants in this study, emphasizing the strong genetic heterogeneity of PKU. Information about 16,000 genotypes and phenotypes from PKU subjects enabled a more detailed study of their distribution across different regions and countries than previously possible. 27,28 Overall, the severe p.Arg408Trp variant was the most common, especially among Eastern European populations, in accordance with previous studies. 29,30 Furthermore, p.Arg408Trp dominates most Central European populations (Poland, Slovakia, Czechia, Austria, or Germany), again supporting previous studies. [31][32][33][34][35] Previous research had suggested that some PKU variants appeared to have been carried by migration, e.g., p.Arg408Trp, c.1066À11G&gt;A, c.1315þ1G&gt;A, or p.Phe299Cys and p.Arg408Gln. 27,36 Our study supports and extends the knowledge on how certain variants appear to have spread within Europe and to different regions and countries worldwide. In particular, the distribution of PKU variants across Europe was consistent with successive waves of historical migration, and Figure 5 summarizes the likely geographical routes of transmission of some variants within Europe. It was previously suggested that the concomitant excess of (unaffected) PKU carriers is at least in part the result of over-dominant selection (''heterozygous advantage''). 37 For example, Germany has occupied a ''crossroads'' location during several migration waves throughout history and displays a broad spectrum of PAH variants, with similarities to some other populations, such as northern European countries (Denmark, Sweden, and Norway). 35 This implies a genetic connection of these regions, possibly during the Germanic settlement of Scandinavia. Norway's most frequent variant, p.Gly46Ser, was not observed in the German population. Furthermore, the occurrence of c.1066À11G&gt;A in Germany was surprisingly high in our analysis, which might be explained by immigration from Turkey. This variant, often described as the ''Mediterranean mutation,'' may be of Italian origin 38 and has been found mainly in Southern European countries or the Middle East. 39,40 Our study showed that c.1066À11G&gt;A has the highest AF in Middle Eastern countries. A typical eastwest gradient can be seen, originating from Western Asia and the Middle East, i.e., from Armenia (48%) via Turkey, Iran, and Israel to Spain. The p.Arg408Trp-associated genotype, the most common variant in people with Slavic roots, followed the east-central-southwest European axis, starting from Estonia and Russia, with the highest number of severe PKU-affected individuals, via Poland, Czechia, Slovakia, Germany, France, and Italy, down to Spain. The high prevalence of cPKU in Russia, and the dominance of the severe variant, p.Arg408Trp, were striking, given that Russia has a diverse ethnic composition, with as many as 160 ethnic groups (see Russian Federation Population Data in Web Resources).Although PKU has been found to be most common in European populations, 9 its similar prevalence in certain Middle Eastern countries (particularly Turkey and Iran) was a remarkable finding. 23,24 A possible contributing factor may be the frequency of consanguinity in Islamic cultures, especially marriages between first cousins, which would favor the autosomal-recessive inheritance of PKU. 25 Prevalence and consanguinity was missing for many countries, making it more difficult to assess this hypothesis. 26 We identified 758 different (previously reported) PKU variants in this study, emphasizing the strong genetic heterogeneity of PKU.

Some variants, e.g., c.1315þ1G&gt;A, seem to have spread within Scandinavian countries at high frequency. The same was true for the p.Glu390Gly-associated genotype concentrating between Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, and Austria. A trend was evident for very mild p.Ala300Ser-associated genotypes, frequent in Turkey and Israel, Italy to Spain. No trends for the distribution of p.Val245Ala and p.Ala403Val across Europe could be seen.</p>
        <p>The influence of migration patterns during history can also be seen in the heterogenous spectrum of PAH variants in Latin America. These countries were strongly marked by immigration of Europeans, especially from Southern Europe, during colonial times. 41 An example is p.Val388Met, which was especially prevalent in Brazil and Chile, once colonies of Portugal and Spain. In Argentina variants frequently occurring in Eastern, Central, and Northern Europe, e.g., p.Arg408Trp, p.Arg261Gln, and c.1066À11G&gt;A, were more prevalent. In contrast to Brazil or Argentina, the Mexican population has a high proportion of indigenous individuals, which could be a reason for the exceptional high AF of the c.60þ5G&gt;T splice variant there. 42 The USA has one of the most multi-racial and ethnic populations in the world. The strongest ancestral influence is European, mainly from Germany, Ireland, England, Italy, and France (see US Census Bureau in Web Resources), which explains a comparable distribution of PKU variants in the USA and Europe. 43 African Americans have a much lower PKU incidence than white Americans. 44 It would be of interest to follow up this study with regard to the different rates of growth of major ethnic groups (Europeans, African American, Hispanic, Asian).The influence of migration patterns during history can also be seen in the heterogenous spectrum of PAH variants in Latin America.

        <p>While the overall PKU prevalence in China was 1:15,924, its distribution across the country varies significantly with higher rates in the north in comparison to the south. 45 In accordance with previous reports, p.Arg234Gln accounts for 23% of all variants in China. 46 Three additional variants p.Arg243Gln, c.611A&gt;G, and p.Arg241Cys (AF &gt; 5%) were also common in Korea and Taiwan, indicating commonalities of migration movements and evolution among those nationalities. Prevalent PKU variants for Europe, Middle East, Latin America, and the USA were uncommon in the Asian populations.While the overall PKU prevalence in China was 1:15,924, its distribution across the country varies significantly with higher rates in the north in comparison to the south. 45 In accordance with previous reports, p.Arg234Gln accounts for 23% of all variants in China. 46 Three additional variants p.Arg243Gln, c.611A&gt;G, and p.Arg241Cys (AF &gt; 5%) were also common in Korea and Taiwan, indicating commonalities of migration movements and evolution among those nationalities.

        <p>Despite immense progress in the diagnosis and treatment of PKU in the last decade, there are still too many areas of the world without adequate access to this care starting with newborn screening. In particular, data from Africa and certain Asian and South American as well as Caribbean countries were missing.Despite immense progress in the diagnosis and treatment of PKU in the last decade, there are still too many areas of the world without adequate access to this care starting with newborn screening.

        <p>Preliminary data indicated the great value of large patient databases with genotype and phenotype information and the introduction of the APV and GPV for the genotypic phenotype prediction. 15 This study extends these previous observations with additional information and has confirmed the power of genotyping in prediction of phenotype and BH 4 responsiveness in PKU, thus offering a powerful tool of personalized medicine for this inherited metabolic disease.Preliminary data indicated the great value of large patient databases with genotype and phenotype information and the introduction of the APV and GPV for the genotypic phenotype prediction. 15 This study extends these previous observations with additional information and has confirmed the power of genotyping in prediction of phenotype and BH 4 responsiveness in PKU, thus offering a powerful tool of personalized medicine for this inherited metabolic disease.</p>
        <p>This study also confirms that functionally mild variants (in a compound heterozygous constellation), with a substantial residual PAH activity are always dominant over inactive severe variants (null alleles) and give rise to a milder phenotype and often potential BH 4 responsiveness. Compared with severe classic PKU variants, milder variants were much rarer in number but determined the milder metabolic phenotype. Interestingly, homozygous mild variants have a higher APV and thus a milder phenotype when occurring in a compound heterozygous state with a null allele. 15 As a rule, two inactive severe variants are never BH 4 responsive, although anecdotal reports sometimes suggest otherwise. 47 In conclusion, this study provides an overview of the current distribution of the most important PAH variants and patient genotypes in various world regions. This information, together with the APV value, helps to predict the metabolic phenotype and the possible treatment options for PKU subjects.This study also confirms that functionally mild variants (in a compound heterozygous constellation), with a substantial residual PAH activity are always dominant over inactive severe variants (null alleles) and give rise to a milder phenotype and often potential BH 4 responsiveness.
