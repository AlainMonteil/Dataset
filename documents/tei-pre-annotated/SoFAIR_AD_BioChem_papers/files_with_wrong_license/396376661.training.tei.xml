        <p>The ability of B. subtilis to switch from a motile to a sessile state has been utilized to study biofilm formation. The undomesticated, ancestral isolate NCIB 3610 is widely studied to explore the three types of well-structured, three-dimensional biofilms that B. subtilis typically forms in vitro: a pellicle biofilm that develops at an air-liquid interface, a colony biofilm that develops at an air-solid interface and a submerged surface-attached biofilm [4][5][6] (Figure 1). B. subtilis also forms biofilms on biotic surfaces, including fungal hyphae 7 and roots 8 and leaves 9 of plants.

        <p>A substantial focus of many research groups has been to identify the regulatory mechanisms that underpin biofilm formation and characterize the properties of the extracellular matrix components of B. subtilis biofilms. Over the past 20 years it has become apparent that a B. subtilis biofilm formed by a single isogenic species is a remarkably heterogeneous community, making it ideal for the study of evolution within biofilm communities. Furthermore, B. subtilis exhibits emerging ecological properties that are dependent on biofilm formation, which affect social behaviours and interactions with hosts, resulting in a shift in the focus of research towards these as yet underappreciated aspects of B. subtilis physiology.A substantial focus of many research groups has been to identify the regulatory mechanisms that underpin biofilm formation and characterize the properties of the extracellular matrix components of B. subtilis biofilms.

        <p>[H3] TapA. TapA is a 253-residue multidomain secreted protein containing a predicted 43amino-acid signal peptide. Tap A has been described as a TasA assembly and anchoring protein 18 . Secreted TapA contains three distinct structural domains with varying levels of intrinsic disorder 19,20 : an N-terminal domain (amino acids 44-75) that is necessary for pellicle and colony biofilm formation, a central stable domain (amino acids 75-191) that forms a βsandwich fold (Protein Data Bank (PDB) identifier (ID) 6HQC and 6QAY) and a C-terminal domain (192-253) that is highly disordered in solution. As only residues 44-57 of TapA are essential for biofilm structure, the central stable domain, which is also the mostly highly conserved region of TapA, currently has no known function 20 . Co-expression of the wild-type tapA allele and a variant with mutations in residues 50-68 (overlapping with the essential region) slowed pellicle formation, although the underlying mechanism is unknown 21 .[H3] TapA.

        <p>In vivo, TapA localizes to foci on the cell surface that are proposed to anchor TasA fibres to the cell wall and accelerate TasA fibre formation 18 . However, TapA is not necessary for TasA fibre formation and does not affect fibre architecture in vitro but does enhance polymerization [21][22][23] . Interestingly, TapA forms β-sheet rich aggregates in isolation and associates with fibril structures in vivo even when TasA is absent 22 . Whether these ∆tasA-fibres consist solely of TapA or whether TapA just has a propensity to associate with fibril structures remains to be clarified. Nonetheless, function of TapA in the matrix is closely tied to that of TasA. Consistent with this, strains lacking TapA have lower levels of matrix-localized TasA, and full function of TasA and TapA in the matrix requires their concomitant expression within the same cells 18 .In vivo, TapA localizes to foci on the cell surface that are proposed to anchor TasA fibres to the cell wall and accelerate TasA fibre formation 18 .

        <p>TasA is a 261 amino acid protein with a 27-residue signal peptide 27 . TasA is found as fibres in the biofilm matrix and is required for the structural integrity of the biofilm 11,23 . TasA-fibres have been isolated directly from biofilms and also produced from recombinant protein. The source of the fibres influences the level of amyloid character that is detected 11,22,28,29 . TasA fibres isolated from B. subtilis pellicles show binding of thioflavin T, Congo red and the amyloid-specific antibody A11, which suggests that these isolated fibres have amyloid properties 11 . Subsequent biophysical and recombinant protein approaches have revealed that both amyloid and non-amyloid TasA fibres exist 22,28,29 .TasA is a 261 amino acid protein with a 27-residue signal peptide 27 .

        <p>Recombinant TasA (which lacks the signal peptide and thus corresponds to the mature secreted protein) forms biologically active fibres that are non-amyloidogenic and have a similar secondary structure to those isolated from biofilms 28 . Unlike curli, the amyloid fibres that are produced by Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria (reviewed elsewhere 23 ), monomeric TasA in B. subtilis is globular in solution and adopts a jelly-roll-like fold with a flexible helix-rich region 29 . At low pH, TasA forms dense gel-like networks that are comparable to colloidal aggregation 30 . Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging of TasA fibres consistently reveals repeating units along the protofilament (smallest diameter fibres) axis that are estimated to be ~5 nm in length 22,28 , similar to the size of the TasA monomer. Like amyloid fibres, biologically active TasA fibres are resistant to proteases but, unlike β-amyloid fibres, TasA fibres are susceptible to the detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate, suggesting key differences in fibre structure. NMR analysis of TasA fibres, after addition to ∆tasA cultures, showed some changes in structure between the monomeric and fibre forms, including increased β-sheet character 29 . By contrast, another study found that the CD spectra of the monomer structure were highly similar to those recombinant fibres and fibres purified from B. subtilis biofilms 28 .Recombinant TasA (which lacks the signal peptide and thus corresponds to the mature secreted protein) forms biologically active fibres that are non-amyloidogenic and have a similar secondary structure to those isolated from biofilms 28 .

        <p>These studies also showed that the N-terminal region of processed TasA is important for polymerization, as addition of a single amino acid to the N-terminus blocks polymerization and locks TasA in a monomeric form.

        <p>TasA additionally affects and has a regulatory role in cell physiology 9,31 . The presence of TasA fibres within the biofilm matrix stimulates expression of motility genes and downregulates matrix expression in subpopulations of cells, and thus contributes to colony spreading on surfaces 31 . Deletion of tasA has other pleiotropic effects, including the down-regulation of genes related to sporulation and an increase in expression of matrix and antimicrobial secondary metabolite-related genes 9 . Moreover, TasA is associated with the detergent-resistant fraction of the cell membrane and influences membrane fluidity. However, most strikingly, tasA deletion leads to a decrease in B. subtilis viability in biofilm-inducing conditions. These functions have been proposed to be separate from TasAfibre forming and structural roles, as a strain producing a biofilm-inactive TasA variant retained wild-type physiological traits 9 .TasA additionally affects and has a regulatory role in cell physiology 9,31 .

        <p>However, the level of the variant TasA produced by this strain was lower than in the wild type, opening the alternative prospect that the level of TasA needed varies with different processes.However, the level of the variant TasA produced by this strain was lower than in the wild type, opening the alternative prospect that the level of TasA needed varies with different processes.</p>
        <p>Looking beyond B. subtilis, TasA orthologues also have multiple roles. For example, in Bacillus cereus, the TasA orthologue CalY acts as a cell-associated adhesion factor during early biofilm formation prior to its release from the cell by the SipW homologue 32 . It is safe to say that despite the many studies conducted to date on TasA and its orthologues, many questions remain about its active structure, biological functions and roles in different strains and species.Looking beyond B. subtilis, TasA orthologues also have multiple roles.

        <p>BslA has two genetically separable functions, being required for both biofilm hydrophobicity and biofilm architecture 13,33 . BslA seems to act synergistically with TasA fibres and exopolysaccharide (EPS) to generate structural complexity in the biofilm, as production of these matrix components is unaltered in mutants lacking BslA but colony biofilm structure is compromised 34 . Whereas bslA is transcribed uniformly in the biofilm population, the protein primarily localizes to the biofilm periphery, forming a hydrophobic coating 12,13 . The crystal structure of BslA provides insight into this aspect of its function, as it reveals an immunoglobin G-like fold with a cap region that can exist in either a cap-in hydrophilic state or a cap-out hydrophobic state 35 (Fig. 2d). The protein forms a 2D lattice in vitro, creating an elastic film at interfaces, which has been studied by biophysical techniques (Box 1) 35 . It is conjectured that at the biofilm-air interface BslA transforms from cap-in to cap-out formation and this transition leads to hydrophobicity of the biofilm surface.BslA has two genetically separable functions, being required for both biofilm hydrophobicity and biofilm architecture 13,33 .

        <p>A C-terminal Cys-x-Cys (CxC) motif is required for BslA oligomerization in the oxygenrich environment of the biofilm surface, and the motif is essential for conferring hydrophobicity to the community, but is not required for the complex architecture of the biofilm 33 . The importance of the CxC motif for hydrophobicity was further demonstrated when YweA, a BslA paralogue lacking the CxC motif, was used in genetic complementation studies. Native YweA was unable to reinstate either hydrophobicity or structural complexity in a bslA-deficient strain, whereas a YweA variant containing the CxC motif fully restored hydrophobicity and partially restored the complex architecture 33 .

Bioinformatic analysis predicts that EpsL is a sugar transferase that possibly transfers the first sugar unit onto a lipid carrier. EpsG is a predicted transmembrane protein of unknown function.

        <p>The composition of EPS and whether it contains N,Nʹ-diacetylbacillosamine is still unclear owing to conflicting findings from multiple studies. One analysis found that EPS contained glucose, N-acetylgalactosamine and galactose (with about 3:2:1 ratio) 49 . Further supporting this finding, the galactose metabolism pathway was found to be important for biofilm formation and regulation of this pathway was interrelated to regulation of the epsA-O operon 49 . By contrast, another study concluded that EPS is predominantly composed of mannose (88%) and glucose (12%) 50 . Furthermore, B. subtilis EPS is cross-reactive with an antibody raised against poly-β-1,6-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (PNAG), a common biofilm exopolysaccharide 45 .

        <p>Another highly anionic polymer of the B. subtilis matrix is poly-𝛾𝛾-glutamic acid (𝛾𝛾-PGA), a linear polymer of L-glutamate and D-glutamate linked at the 𝛾𝛾-carboxyl instead of at the ⍺-carboxyl that is typically used in proteins. The levels of 𝛾𝛾-PGA in the matrix are highly dependent on the strain and growth conditions.

        <p>Biofilm formation and motility are described as mutually exclusive lifestyles, with cells in a bacterial population expressing genes that are necessary either for motility or for biofilm matrix production but not for both 60 . Consistent with this idea, B. subtilis exhibits heterogeneity in gene expression within the cell population (extensively reviewed elsewhere 59 ), and transcription of the genes needed for motility is inversely correlated with that of the genes needed for biofilm matrix production. The transcription factor Spo0A is a critical regulator of B. subtilis biofilm formation 4,5 , with this regulatory pathway serving as an integration 'hub' for many competing and overlapping signals to control the proportion of cells in the biofilm that transcribe genes linked to biofilm matrix production. Initiation of biofilm formation is promoted when moderate levels of phosphorylated Spo0A (Spo0A~P) are reached within a cell.Biofilm formation and motility are described as mutually exclusive lifestyles, with cells in a bacterial population expressing genes that are necessary either for motility or for biofilm matrix production but not for both 60 .

        <p>The first structures of full-length tetrameric SinR and dimeric SinI in solution shed light on how SinR binds to DNA and how SinI inhibits this function 67 . The formation of a flexible SinR homotetramer facilitates bending of the target DNA to enable repression of biofilm genes. SinI inhibits SinR from effectively binding DNA by forming SinR-SinI dimers that disrupt the formation of SinR homotetramers. SlrR is another antagonist of SinR which is induced by threshold levels of phosphor-Spo0A 68 and promotes transcription of the epsA-O and tapA operons, thus enabling the switch from a motile state to biofilm formation 69 . As levels of phospho-Spo0A∼P are not elevated homogeneously in the population, the regulatory network heterogeneously induces expression of matrix genes, creating subpopulations of matrix producer (ON-state) and non-producer (OFF-state) cells [70][71][72] .The first structures of full-length tetrameric SinR and dimeric SinI in solution shed light on how SinR binds to DNA and how SinI inhibits this function 67 .

        <p>Another regulatory factor is the transcription termination factor Rho, an ATPdependent RNA helicase/translocase that represses genome-wide transcription 76,77 . Rho both directly and indirectly regulates motility, biofilm formation and sporulation 78 . In Rho-deficient cells, epsA-O and tapA operons are transcribed at low levels owing to an increase in SinRmediated repression of their promoters triggered by enhanced Spo0A phosphorylation. The Spo0A mediated regulatory pathway is also modulated by the secondary messenger cyclic di-adenylate monophosphate (c-di-AMP). In addition to controlling growth, response to DNA damage and sporulation 79,80 , c-di-AMP also reduces expression of the tapA and epsA-O operons, leading to impaired biofilm formation 81 . While disruption of sinR restores biofilm formation under increased intracellular c-di-AMP concentrations, c-di-AMP accumulation does not affect the intracellular levels of SinR, suggesting that the nucleotide affects the activity of SinR. However, another study found that increased intracellular levels of c-di-AMP led to increased expression of the tapA operon. Furthermore, B. subtilis encodes two putative c-di-AMP transporters that are involved in c-di-AMP secretion and facilitate root colonization. Thus, B. subtilis can sense and respond to extracellular c-di-AMP, uncovering a potential role of this second messenger in inter-bacterial communication 82 . Given the differences in experimental results, it is possible that the effect of intracellular c-di-AMP levels or the ability to secrete c-di-AMP changes in response to environmental conditions. c-di-AMP is not the only secondary messenger molecule that affects cell differentiation in B. subtilis. Cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) signalling directly inhibits motility in B. subtilis through the interaction of the putative c-di-GMP receptor YpfA with the flagellar motor protein MotA 83 .

In B. subtilis, the alternative sigma factor sigma B (σ B ) is activated by stressors, including heat, salt and starvation conditions 90 . Activity of σ B manifests as a series of stochastic pulses within cells in the biofilm, showing maximal expression at the upper surfaces of the community 91 . Stochastic pulsing of σ B appears to provide an adaptation mechanism for cells to either activate σ B or sporulate, thus allowing cells in these different states to coexist in the same zone of the biofilm structure. Heterogeneous expression of biofilm components is linked with changes in biofilm structure and robustness over both space and time 71 . For example, during pellicle formation a substantial increase in biomass robustness is correlated with an increase in epsA-O expression, and with tasA expression being almost universally activated in the cells of the biofilm population 71 . These data also reveal heterogeneity between the transcription profiles from the tapA and epsA-O promoters. The genetically homogeneous population in the pellicle undergoes a phenotypic segregation into three phenotypically distinct subgroups producing different levels of EPS and TasA: matrix non-producers, EPS producers, and generalist cells that produce both major components. This differentiation of the population can be viewed as a 'phenotypic division of labour' where specialization leads to maximum population efficiency 92 .Stress conditions influence biofilm formation in diverse bacteria 89 .

Depending on their concentration, many of these compounds can also affect 'kin' (or conspecific) strains, leading to nuance in interspecific and intraspecific microbial interactions [114][115][116] . Imaging mass spectrometry provides a powerful novel approach to study how specific metabolites and peptides are spatially distributed in the above-mentioned interactions and will contribute to understanding of how interspecific and intraspecific interactions modulate B. subtilis biofilm development.</p>

Intriguingly, repeated cultivation of B. subtilis in shaking planktonic conditions results in rapid genetic differentiation, discernible as derivative isolates with distinct colony morphotypes 140 . The variability in colony biofilm structures was connected to mutation of sinR and the resultant alteration in expression of biofilm-related genes. Similarly, pellicle biofilms formed by B. subtilis can be exploited for studying experimental evolution of B. subtilis biofilms (Figure 5), primarily because of the degree of heterogeneity observed within the otherwise robust biofilm population. B. subtilis can diversify into distinct colony variants that exhibit differences in their biofilm formation abilities and expression of biofilm-related genes 141 .

        <p>From a biophysics perspective, biofilms are a form of soft matter -a material that can easily be deformed by external forces and behaves differently to solid and liquids. Biophysical techniques have been used to probe biofilm properties at both the whole biofilm and macromolecular level, yielding novel insights into their form and properties (comprehensively reviewed elsewhere 153 ).From a biophysics perspective, biofilms are a form of soft matter -a material that can easily be deformed by external forces and behaves differently to solid and liquids.

        <p>Advances in microfluidic setups have enabled the visualization of biofilm formation on the roots of thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana), cotton plants and aspen trees. These studies customized microfluidic chip-based plant cultivation experiments (see the figure) to investigate root-microbe interactions (RMIs) over time. RMI chip systems have been designed to contain an array of isolated growth chambers with individual media inlets and outlets, allowing for a comparison of conditions and replicates in the same microfluidic device 8,111 . Colonization and biofilm dynamics at single-cell resolution can be investigated with RMI chip systems using confocal microscopy, such as investigating Bacillus subtilis preference between different A. thaliana genotypes and the interplay between B. subtilis biofilms and Escherichia coli at the root surface 111 . These experiments are somewhat limited by the small chamber size required for microfluidics, as fast-growing plants such as A. thaliana out-grow the chamber in about 10 days, whereas slower-growing plants such as tree seedlings could be visualized for much longer 8 .Advances in microfluidic setups have enabled the visualization of biofilm formation on the roots of thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana), cotton plants and aspen trees.
