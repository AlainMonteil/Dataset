        <p>Blastocystis is a genetically diverse intestinal protist colonising both human and non-human hosts. By 2013, 17 subtypes had been acknowledged. Since then, nine more subtypes have been proposed. We argue that several recently proposed subtypes are invalid. We also revisit recommendations regarding the requirements for annotating sequences as new subtypes.</p>

        <p>In 2007, an article was published that sought to clarify the nomenclature applied to genetic variants of Blastocystis [1]. This stramenopile is probably the most widespread non-fungal microeukaryote present in the human gastrointestinal tract. Remarkable genetic diversity had been uncovered by numerous groups working independently around the world, each of which had introduced its own naming scheme for the genetic variants detected. A consensus was reached that proposed the existence of nine genetic groups of Blastocystis in humans and named them 'subtypes'. The identifications were based primarily on differences among the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU) gene sequences. It was recognised at that time that most of the nine subtypes were also found in other mammals and birds, but that most Blastocystis from reptiles and amphibia fell outside these groups.</p>
        <p>This subtype system (Box 1) has proven very useful, and has been adopted almost universally among those performing research into this organism. In 2007, the majority of samples analysed had been of human origin. Inevitably, once additional hosts started to be examined in significant numbers, new subtypes were quickly identified. By 2013, no fewer than eight more subtypes had been proposed, and all of them had been identified in non-human hosts [2]. Subsequently, an additional nine have been reported, also in non-human hosts. However, we are concerned that the evidence on which some of the post-2013 subtypes have been based is insufficient and potentially misleading.</p>
        <p>Indeed, we believe that some of the new subtypes are the result of experimental artifacts. The aim of the current review is to evaluate the validity of the seventeen post-2007 subtypes and propose minimum criteria for the future naming of new subtypes.</p>
        <p>Subtype 10 was described in 2009 based on sequences from two nonoverlapping regions of the SSU gene [3]. A complete gene sequence for ST10 (KC148207) was obtained only four years later [2], and subsequently ST10 has gone on to be recognised as a very common subtype in cattle, sheep and other artiodactyls worldwide [3] Subtypes 11 and 12 were detected initially in zoo animals and were based on the sequence of about 60% of the SSU gene [4]. A near-complete sequence of ST12 was actually deposited in GenBank a year later (EU427515), but this was not recognised until recently because of the way that 
            <rs type="software">BLAST</rs> i ranks sequence matches. No complete sequence of ST11 is yet available, to our knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>The absence of a full-length sequence for ST11 is potentially problematic. The 'missing' region of the gene is one that is commonly used for subtype identification, the so-called "barcode region" [5]. A novel barcode sequence might be proposed as representing a new subtype when in fact it is actually the missing region of ST11. This situation is not farfetched, as a similar misidentification happened with ST13. A barcode sequence previously reported as a variant of ST5 [6] actually proved to be the barcode region of ST13 when a full length sequence for the latter was described in 2013 [2].</p>
        <p>ST13 to ST17 are based on almost full-length SSU gene sequences obtained from a variety of non-human hosts [2,7]. So, with the exception of ST11, all the new subtypes reported between 2007 and 2013 are represented by full-or almost full-length SSU gene sequences. Some were derived from sequencing of cloned PCR products, others from direct sequencing of PCR products, but all have now been isolated multiple times, usually in multiple different hosts and by several independent researchers, and they form discrete clades in phylogenetic trees. We have no doubt that ST11 to ST17 are all 'real'.</p>
        <p>Recently, subtypes numbered 18 through 26 have been proposed [8=10]. However, we do not believe that all of these are real and will discuss below the different factors we have considered in reaching our conclusions. In particular, we believe that some of them are actually molecular chimaeras and will briefly describe how these are generated and how to recognise them.</p>
        <p>Chimaeras arise during PCR amplification, usually when there are two distinct subtypes in the DNA sample and when there is incomplete replication of a DNA strand during a cycle. After denaturation in the next cycle, one single-stranded partial product may anneal to a single stranded product derived from a different subtype; this is possible due to the extensive sequence similarity in some regions of the gene. Extension then results in a PCR product combining sequences from the two sources (subtypes, or even different organisms). The conservation of SSU genes means there can be sufficient similarity to allow binding even between products derived from distantly related organisms.</p>
        <p>Chimaeras are generally only detected when the PCR products are cloned before sequencing, although they are also common in sequence data obtained by Next Generation Sequencing. Where a PCR product is sequenced directly using a dideoxynucleotide-based chain termination method, the chimaera sequences present will be 'diluted out' because the sequence obtained is the average of all the products in that reaction, and so the sequence read will be that of the major product of the reaction. Only when single products from that mixture are studied in isolation will chimaeras be detected.</p>
        <p>In the original Blastocystis 'barcoding' publication of Scicluna et al. [5], a sequence was identified in GenBank (AF538348) where the 5' and 3' ends clearly derived from different subtypes. Several of the newly described subtypes also appear to be chimaeras. ST19 [10] is similar to the example above. The 5' half is 99% identical to ST3 sequences while the 3' half is 99% identical to ST1 sequences. In contrast, in the sequence designated ST18 [10], the 3' end shows no similarity to other Blastocystis at all, while the 5' end shows over 90% identity to several Blastocystis subtypes. Similarly, for ST20 [10] the very 5' end (130 bp) does not match any organisms, while the remainder is 96% identical to ST5. For ST22 [10], the 5' end matches ST14 with 95% identity, while the 3' end shows 99% identity to ST10. Each of these 'subtypes' was reported only on one occasion and is represented by only a single sequencethis is as would be expected from an artifact.</p>
        <p>There are other Blastocystis sequences in GenBank that have not been allocated to subtypes but are also chimaeras. For example, MH496651 is partially Blastocystis, partially plant. Other examples include MH489079, which appears to be mostly from a banana, and MH496654, which has a 5' end with a 100% match to ST13 but a 3' end that has no similarity to Blastocystis, and so on.</p>
        <p>In contrast, subtypes 21 and 23-26 have all been isolated multiple times and in most cases by research groups working in different countries (Table 1); this strongly suggests that the sequences are not artifacts. However, all consist of incomplete SSU gene sequences. This raises the question of defining boundaries between subtypes. How different does a sequence need to be before it can be considered a new subtype? With incomplete sequences it is not possible to be prescriptive, because regions of the SSU gene exhibit differing degrees of conservation and therefore differ in the percentage divergence between subtypes. For this reason, we previously recommended designating sequences as new subtypes only if &gt;80% of the SSU gene has been sequenced and if that sequence diverges by more than 4% from previously sequenced complete Blastocystis SSU genes [11]. Intra-subtype variation differs between subtypes but can be up to 3% in, for example, ST1 and ST2, which is why the 4% cut-off was selected. A particular issue is being seen in the cluster of subtypes that includes ST5 and STs 12-14. Several of the proposed new STs are related to sequences in this region of the tree and when their partial sequences are incorporated in the phylogenetic analysis, the established clade structure breaks down.</p>
        <p>Clearly, sequence length and reliability are critical to the process of allocating sequences to subtypes of Blastocystis. In the case of sequences that may represent novel subtypes, near-complete SSU gene sequences should be generated before assigning a number and phylogenetic analyses involving a standard set of reference sequences iii should be used in the investigation.</p>
        <p>Invalid subtypes must be kept to a minimum in order not to undermine the subtype terminology. To this end we recommend that STs 18-20 and ST22 be rejected, while STs 21 and 23-26 need to be investigated further to generate full-length gene sequenceswe acknowledge that the latter five subtypes are likely to be confirmed as new but, at present, it is not clear how these five are related to previously described subtypes.</p>
        <p>While we recommend rejecting STs 18-20 and ST22, we do not believe it is a good idea to reuse these ST numbers in the future, as this will only generate confusion in the literature. We recommend keeping ST21 and STs 23-26 until further data lead to them being confirmed or rejected. The next new subtype should therefore be named ST27 and we recommend to anyone aiming to report a sequence as representing a new subtype that they follow the guidelines in Box1.</p>
        <p>Application of the subtype system for Blastocystis relies on our ability to obtain accurate identification while allowing for a certain amount of variation. The terminology should be sufficiently detailed to permit identification of major groups that may differ in epidemiology, host specificity, and potentially variation in virulence.</p>
        <p>The 10 subtypes known to colonise humans (subtypes 1-9 and 12) are easily differentiated using e.g. barcode sequences [5,12] and querying these against the Blastocystis Subtype (18S) and Sequence Typing (MLST) Databases ii .</p>
        <p>More than 90% of human Blastocystis belongs to subtypes 1, 2, 3, and 4 [13].</p>
        <p>Many hosts still await sampling, so new subtypes and hosts of Blastocystis likely await discovery. Subtype calling of non-human Blastocystis should be carried out with caution and not be based solely on top BLAST hits in the NCBI Database.</p>
        <p>When potentially new subtypes are discovered, we recommend the following:</p>
        <p>New STs should be based on ≥80% of the ca. 1800 bp SSU gene.</p>
        <p>probably valid based on analysis of currently available data.</p>
        <p>New STs should undergo phylogenetic analysis to ensure they do not nest within previously known STs.</p>
        <p>The most recent Blastocystis reference set of ST sequences iii should be used for phylogenetic analyses.</p>
        <p>We encourage researchers to contact the authors (crs@blastocystis.net) before proposing a new subtype. The authors will gladly provide an opinion as to whether they believe it qualifies as a new subtype, indicate the subtype number to be used and add the sequence to the reference set iii . If all proposals adhere to this procedure, there will be very little risk that two different variants will have the same subtype number. It is planned that at the 3rd International Blastocystis Conference (Crete, 2021) a community subtype working group will be established to take on this responsibility going forward.</p>
