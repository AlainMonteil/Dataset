        <p>reatment using pharmaceutical drugs is arguably the most important medical therapy sustaining the health of every human. However, the systemic application of drugs is a compromise between desirable treatment and side effects due to the intrinsic lack of drug selectivity. In addition, the systemic use and overuse of antibiotics are factors leading to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, which will put millions of lives per year at risk due to the increase in drug-resistant bacterial infections by 2050 1 . This can be attenuated or circumvented either by increasing the drug selectivity, for example, by endowing it with auxiliaries that deliver it to a specific target 2 , or by controlling the activation and release of drugs in response to external and internal stimuli. Among the latter, systems addressed by physicochemical stimuli, such as light 3,4 , electromagnetic fields 5 , pH 6 or redox reactions 7 , enable control over the release and activation of therapeutic agents. However, many of these seminal approaches suffer from poor selectivity, low loading capacity, leakage or systemic side effects 8,9 . It is thus desirable to develop new concepts that resolve these complications while offering remote control over local drug activity, regardless of the selected target.</p>
        <p>In the field of photopharmacology 3,4 , spatiotemporal control over drug activity is exerted by illumination with light. Yet this technique is limited by the toxicity of ultraviolet light, photothermal damage to healthy cells or low tissue penetration depths 10 . Concurrently, ultrasound (US) is used in clinical applications as it allows the spatiotemporally controlled release of drugs from carriers such as micelles, liposomes or microbubbles [11][12][13] , or to synergistically increase drug efficacy 14,15 . Although the use of non-invasive US can result in undesired tissue interactions-by acoustic heating, cavitation, radiation pressure, force and torque, and acoustic streaming-it is still useful for biomedical applications, because it combines spatial and temporal dosage with easy regulation of tissue penetration depth by varying frequency and energy through Publisher's note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p>
        <p>exposure time 16 . However, these US procedures lack the ability to address functional molecular motifs selectively.</p>
        <p>Contrarily, polymer mechanochemistry exploits US to control transformations on the molecular level by rearranging or cleaving bonds at predetermined breaking sites [17][18][19] . Generally, this is achieved by applying mechanical force to a macromolecular framework that transduces it to the mechanochemically labile bond of the latent molecular motif (the mechanophore) 20 . Mechanophore breakage can occur in bulk material by exposure to mechanical stress and strain but also in solution via the collapse of US-induced cavitation bubbles generating shear stress 21 . Until now, research in polymer mechanochemistry mainly focused on understanding the force-induced chemical transformations and their impact on material properties. Although recent investigations of the effects of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) 12 on molecular mechanophores 22 and theranostic US 13 highlight the potential of mechanochemically controlled drug activation with tissue penetration depths in the centimetre range, the utilization of mechanochemical bond scission for the activation of drug molecules has remained largely unexplored 23,24 .</p>
        <p>In this Article, we present a broad-scope molecular framework of three approaches for the activation of drugs by US-induced scission of covalent and non-covalent bonds within their respective macromolecular or assembled precursors. The first strategy relies on a disulfide-centred polymer carrying camptothecin (CPT), a monoterpene alkaloid anticancer drug on a carbonate linker in β-position to the disulfide (Fig. 1a). Subsequent irradiation with US transformed the disulfide to thiols 25,26 and spurred an intramolecular 5-exo-trig cyclization 27 liberating and activating the drug from the carbonate. The second strategy relies on the strong binding of RNA aptamers to their targets (Fig. 1b). We synthesized high-molar-mass polyaptamers consisting of nucleic acid aptamer repeat units bound to the antibiotics neomycin B (NeoB) or</p>

Spatial and temporal control over drug activation in response to stimuli is a promising strategy to attenuate and circumvent these problems. Here we use ultrasound to activate drugs from inactive macromolecules or nano-assemblies through the controlled scission of mechanochemically labile covalent bonds and weak non-covalent bonds. We show that a polymer with a disulfide motif at the centre of the main chain releases an alkaloid-based anticancer drug from its β-carbonate linker by a force-induced intramolecular 5-exo-trig cyclization. Second, aminoglycoside antibiotics complexed by a multi-aptamer RNA structure are activated by the mechanochemical opening and scission of the nucleic acid backbone. Lastly, nanoparticlepolymer and nanoparticle-nanoparticle assemblies held together by hydrogen bonds between the peptide antibiotic vancomycin and its complementary peptide target are activated by force-induced scission of hydrogen bonds. This work demonstrates the potential of ultrasound to activate mechanoresponsive prodrug systems.</p>
        <p>NATURe CHeMiSTRy paromomycin (Paromo). Application of US destroyed the non-covalent interactions (such as hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions), led to additional disaggregation and covalent bond scission of the phosphodiester RNA backbone, and subsequently activated the drugs. The third approach relies on latent force-sensitive prodrug assemblies based on the supramolecular binding between vancomycin (Van) with its H-bond-complementary peptide target sequence Cys-Lys-Lys(Ac)-d-Ala-d-Ala (DADA). By incorporating this supramolecular motif between poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (POEGMEMA) polymer chains and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), or between two AuNPs, we fabricated polymer-nanoparticle (PN) and nanoparticle-nanoparticle (NN) architectures (Fig. 1c).</p>
        <p>Activation of drugs from β-carbonate disulfides. We first sought to release CPT, a monoterpene alkaloid anticancer drug that is covalently attached to linear polymer chains through a carbonate linker in the β-position to a disulfide moiety. These polymers were designed such that US-induced central bond scission in aqueous medium would lead to the generation of free thiols 25,26 and, subsequently, a 5-exo-trig cyclization would extrude the target molecule from the carbonate linker (Fig. 1a) 27 . Two poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate) (POEGMEA)-disubstituted and disulfide-centred polymers P UMB (number-average molar mass, M n = 109.5 kDa; molar mass dispersity, Ɖ M = 1.56) and P CPT (M n = 83.7 kDa, Ɖ M = 1.46) were synthesized as detailed in Supplementary Scheme 1 and Supplementary Figs. 1-10. We postulated that anchoring drugs within the centre of the polymer chain would protect them inside the random coil and would effectively decrease their activity. Additionally, placing the disulfide motif in the centre of the chain would enable its efficient mechanochemical scission (Fig. 1a).</p>
        <p>POEGMEA was chosen as a biocompatible PEG-analogue that could be obtained by controlled radical polymerization. P UMB carried the latent fluorophore umbelliferone (UMB) for control experiments and P CPT carried CPT as an anticancer-drug, which inhibits topoisomerase I that is largely insoluble in its pristine state 28 . We verified the activation capability of the system by chemically reducing the disulfides of UMB covalently bound to the small-molecule bifunctional initiator (Supplementary Fig. 11) and to its respective polymer P UMB (Supplementary Fig. 12). This was followed by the 'turn on' fluorescence and absorption changes of UMB upon forming the free phenol from the carbonate. Irradiation of P UMB with US in solution led to 80% UMB formation after 4 h of sonication (Fig. 2a,b). Importantly, the corresponding small-molecule bifunctional initiator did not lead to an increase in fluorescence under the same conditions; this verified the mechanochemical origin of the activation (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 13).</p>
        <p>We then tackled the CPT-functionalized polymer P CPT . We investigated the activity of P CPT in comparison to a series of control molecules in a colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) proliferation assay after treatment of HeLa cells (Fig. 2c). The considerably higher half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) values of P CPT compared with CPT and the CPT initiator clearly demonstrated that shielding the conjugate within the random coil decreased drug activity and rendered the disulfide resistant to thiol exchange or reduction. Moreover, the lack of activity of pristine POEGMEA chains and post-sonication fragments of P CPT , in which activated CPT was dialysed out, highlighted that the delivery platform is not inherently cytotoxic. To investigate the activity of P CPT upon US activation, we subjected samples of P CPT to US irradiation ex situ before dissolving them in cell culture medium and incubating them with HeLa cells because they were not viable under prolonged sonication conditions. The decrease in cell viability with progressing sonication time is visible and indicates the successful sonochemical activation of CPT (Fig. 2d). Due to the lack of fluorescence or absorption changes during ultrasonication (Supplementary Figs. 14 and15), we used ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) to verify that the cell behaviour is a result of successful mechanochemically induced activation of CPT (Fig. 2e).</p>
        <p>Activation of drugs from RNA polyaptamers. For the deactivation of the aminoglycoside antibiotics NeoB and Paromo, we relied on the R23 RNA aptamer. Previously we demonstrated that the R23 RNA aptamer selectively and strongly binds these antibiotics 29 . We postulated that sonication would result in scission of both non-covalent interactions and covalent bonds within the phosphodiester RNA backbone, releasing the antibiotics. As aptamers are oligonucleotide sequences with a comparatively short contour length, they do not respond to US irradiation with bond scission 30 . Consequently, we incorporated the aptamer (APT) as a repeating unit into macromolecular RNA strands (polyaptamers, P APT ) to enable mechanochemical reactivity. These were obtained by rolling circle transcription (RCT) 31 with a template encoding the R23 RNA aptamer (Supplementary Table 1). Experimental details can be found in the Supplementary Information. The circular template was prepared by ligation of 5′-phosphorylated linear DNA with T4 DNA ligase (Fig. 1b) and the successful synthesis was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis with the circularized template exhibiting reduced mobility compared with the linear template (Supplementary Fig. 16). Fabrication of the polyaptamer was verified by gel electrophoresis using a high-molar-mass RNA ladder (Supplementary Fig. 16). Most of the product stayed in the well and did not penetrate the gel, thereby confirming the high molar mass of the RCT product. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was carried out with estimation of the dimensions of possibly coiled or aggregated polyaptamers to 0.1-1 µm (Supplementary Fig. 16).</p>
        <p>To investigate the binding quality of the antibiotics to the polyaptamer, the RCT product was incubated with cyanine 3 (Cy3) fluorophore-labelled paromomycin (Cy3-Paromo) (Supplementary Scheme 2 and Supplementary Figs. 17 and18). Gel electrophoresis shows a perfect overlap of the Cy3-Paromo fluorescence signal with the SYBR Gold-stained nucleic acid bands, which highlights the successful formation of a stable Cy3-Paromo@P APT complex (Fig. 3a). To investigate whether the complex deactivated the antibiotics, agar diffusion tests were performed on paper disks against the growth of Staphylococcus aureus (Fig. 3b) 32 . After overnight incubation, neither paper disks with small-molecule aptamer, its complex with NeoB, nor NeoB@P APT showed apparent inhibition zones compared with pure NeoB, underlining the robust binding and deactivation ability of the aptamer and its RCT polymer (Supplementary Fig. 19) 33 .</p>
        <p>To visualize and quantify the drug activation process using US in solution, Cy3-Paromo was used again and the complex was analysed by gel electrophoresis tracing the remaining quantity of the bound drug over the course of the sonication. The gel images indicate that the molar mass of Cy3-Paromo-containing components decreased with continuous sonication. SYBR Gold-staining reveals that this observation is most likely caused by covalent bond scission and disaggregation along the P APT backbone, because the molar mass of P APT decreased equally (Fig. 3c,d) 30 . This interpretation is corroborated by ultrasonication of the polyaptamer alone without the bound drug (Supplementary Figs. 20 and23). The remaining Cy3-Paromo bound to P APT was quantified by 
            <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> revealing that more than 80% of the antibiotic was cumulatively transformed into its active form after 30 min of ultrasonication (Fig. 3e).
        </p>
        <p>We investigated whether this US-induced gradual drug activation could be used to 'turn on' antibacterial properties by performing minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) tests against S. aureus using the broth dilution method 34 . Note that the sonication experiments involving NeoB@P APT were performed in situ in</p>
        <p>NATURe CHeMiSTRy the presence of the bacteria and that within the observed period the application of US alone had no considerable effect on the viability of S. aureus (Supplementary Figs. 21 and22). Moreover, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirms the structural integrity of the bacterial membrane after sonication (Supplementary Fig. 22). While we recorded a MIC value of 1 µg ml -1 for pristine NeoB, antimicrobial activity could be detected neither when incubated with small-molecule NeoB@APT, with macromolecular NeoB@P APT nor with the sonication-fragmented P APT , once again highlighting strong binding and deactivation of the drug (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 23). However, the MIC of NeoB@ P APT decreased to 8 µg ml -1 after 10 min and reached the MIC of pristine NeoB after 30 min of ultrasonication. Importantly, small-molecule NeoB@APT did not show this behaviour, indicating that these results originate from the mechanochemical scission of non-covalent host-guest interactions and covalent degradation of the nucleic acid backbone. To once more verify this US-triggered drug activation mechanism, we performed bacteria live/dead staining by using a DMAO probe from Biotium Inc. (green, staining all cells) and ethidium homodimer III (EthD-III, red, staining dead cells). While pristine NeoB killed almost all bacteria, NeoB@P APT showed activity only after ultrasonication, but not before (Fig. 3g and Supplementary Fig. 24).</p>
        <p>Our third strategy relied on supramolecular binding between the antibiotic Van and its target motif and H-bonding complementary peptide, DADA. For the successful selective scission of non-covalent bonds in nanoparticle systems decorated with polymers, the Van-DADA mechanophores were localized at the interface of both entities, similar to the method pioneered by Moore and co-workers 35 (Supplementary Scheme 3). We here relied on AuNPs due to their facile functionalizability, the precise control of their size and their potential for multivalent drug binding 36 . Therefore, we synthesized citrate-protected AuNPs (diameter of the Au core, d core = 13 nm), which we then modified with thiol-terminated DADA through ligand exchange 37 and analysed by TEM (Fig. 4a) as well as dynamic light scattering (DLS; Fig. 4b). Additionally, the successful surface functionalization was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF-MS, Supplementary Fig. 25). We then functionalized Van selectively</p>
        <p>with an initiator group for Cu-mediated controlled radical polymerization toward POEGMEMA chains (Supplementary Schemes 4 and 5 and Supplementary Figs. 26-29) 38 . Comparison of the MICs of pristine Van with its POEGMEMA derivatives against S. aureus (Supplementary Fig. 30 and Supplementary Table 2) reveals that increasing the M n of the appended polymer chain increases the MIC considerably. This effect can be explained by the increased screening of the peptide antibiotic with increasing chain lengths of the polymer random coil, which renders binding to the cellular target progressively difficult. Compromising mechanochemical performance and MIC values, we henceforth focused on Van-terminated POEGMEMA chains with M n of 10 and 20 kDa. The respective PN assemblies were obtained by combining DADA-decorated AuNPs with polymer-terminated Van in solution.</p>
        <p>A series of experiments verified the mechanochemical origin of the selective release of Van from inactive PN assemblies. We showed that DADA-decorated AuNPs alone (Au-DADA), capped with small-molecule Van (Au-DADA + Van), and capped with polymer-terminated Van (Au-DADA + P Van ) showed either no considerable antibacterial activity or only at higher concentrations (Fig. 4c). Additionally, ultrasonication of the Au-DADA alone and Au-DADA + Van did not affect their MIC values significantly. However, US applied in situ in the presence of S. aureus successfully lowered the MIC values of PN assemblies prepared from 10 and 20 kDa Van-terminated POEGMEMA chains highlighting the efficient supramolecular bond scission and activation of polymer-terminated Van by mechanical force in solution from PN assemblies (Supplementary Table 3).</p>
        <p>To realize externally triggered antibiotic systems with lower Van concentration, we investigated the mechanochemical activation of NN assemblies composed of small AuNPs decorated with Van (Au-Van, d = 8 nm) and larger AuNPs functionalized with DADA (Au-DADA, d = 55 nm) (Supplementary Scheme 6). Au-DADA were synthesized analogously to above and characterized by TEM, DLS, ultraviolet-visible, and MALDI-ToF-MS (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Figs. 31-36), while the successful decoration of AuNPs with Van was confirmed by TEM, DLS, infrared spectroscopy and binding ability tests (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Figs. 373839).</p>
        <p>We exploited the polyvalent H-bonding mechanophore and formed NN assemblies between Au-DADA and Au-Van. While using an excess of smaller Au-Van yielded core-shell-like assemblies (Fig. 5c,d), overnight incubation resulted in the formation of larger agglomerates with d ≈ 800 nm in solution (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Fig. 40). Alongside the changes in morphology and size (Supplementary Fig. 41), the agglomerated assemblies revealed a considerable bathochromic shift (from ~525 nm to ~650 nm) of their plasmon resonance absorption band (Supplementary Fig. 41). This is consistent with Mie theory and attributed to close interparticle H-bond formation and the non-uniform spatial distribution of the AuNPs 39 . Gel electrophoresis of the NN assemblies also demonstrated the inertness to disassembly upon dilution, highlighting successful Van-DADA binding (Supplementary Fig. 41).</p>
        <p>We performed a series of experiments again to verify the mechanochemical nature of the selective release of Van from inactive NN assemblies. Expectedly, DADA-decorated AuNPs showed minor antibacterial properties against S. aureus (Fig. 5f). Most notably, Van-functionalized small AuNPs exhibited MIC values only negligibly higher than the pristine small-molecule Van 40 , which is in stark contrast and a clear improvement on polymer-terminated Van-P, for which MIC values were found to be more than two orders of magnitude higher. Moreover, the latent Van-DADA mechanophore NN assemblies showed antibacterial behaviour only at high concentrations highlighting their successful deactivation within the NN aggregates (Supplementary Table 4). This most likely stems from the incomplete deactivation of Van within the assemblies due to geometrical constraints of multiple spheres in surface contact.</p>
        <p>Subsequently, the NN assemblies were subjected to ex situ ultrasonication to release Van-decorated small AuNPs as nanodrugs (Fig. 5g). The disassembly of the AuNPs could be easily followed by eye (Fig. 5h) and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. 42), and revealed the depletion of the agglomerates' low-energy plasmonic resonance band in combination with the simultaneous increase in the typical single AuNP high-energy plasmonic resonance bands. In addition, sonication decreased the MIC value of the agglomerate against S. aureus by one order of magnitude, turning 'on' the antibacterial properties approximately identically to free Van-covered AuNPs (Fig. 5f). These results unequivocally demonstrate the force-induced bond scission at the Van-DADA mechanophore site activating the antibacterial properties of Van-decorated AuNPs. AuNP nanodrug activation by US was performed in situ in the presence of S. aureus (Fig. 5i and Supplementary Fig. 43), and the viability of the bacteria was affected negligibly by ultrasonication experiments, indicating that this treatment is biocompatibile with the bacterial culture (Supplementary Figs. 21 and22).</p>
        <p>In summary, we developed three mechanoresponsive prodrug systems that incorporate both mechanochemically labile but stable covalent bonds and mechanochemically labile non-covalent bonds. By US-induced bond scission, drugs were activated from their latent parent macromolecules or nano-assemblies. We employed a purely synthetic disulfide-centred polymer platform that releases β-carbonate-linked cargo molecules, a biomacromolecular RNA aptamer opening and cleaving its backbone, as well as NP and NN assemblies that rely on the scission of supramolecular hydrogen bonds. The mechanochemical origin of the observed effects was confirmed by reference experiments and we obtained systems that allow remote-controlled drug activation. Most importantly, the first two systems allowed the release of pristine small drug molecules bearing no residual functional moieties that would alter their pharmacological properties. This is in contrast to existing mechanochemical molecular motifs, which rely on the formation of acidic protons [41][42][43] , dienes and dienophiles [44][45][46][47] or activated metal ion coordination sites [48][49][50] , none of which have yet been investigated in biological or pharmacological contexts.</p>
        <p>With this approach, we conceived of a potential future pharmacotherapy that might avoid systemic side effects and may be tunable to medical demands and clinically established techniques with spatiotemporal resolution. Although the current forms of mechanochemically useful US can result in undesired tissue interactions when employed in medical therapy, they were proven useful due to their combination of spatial and temporal dosage. With this US method, tissue penetration depth is easily regulated by varying frequency and energy through exposure time 16 . Moreover, medically established HIFU 12 was shown to promote mechanochemistry 22 , again underlining the potential of mechanochemically controlled drug activation with tissue penetration depths in the centimetre range. Although we have used aptamers for US-mediated activation of latent antibiotics in this study, it is known that that large polynucleic acid structures are efficiently taken up by cells 51 , expanding their clinical use beyond bacteria.</p>
        <p>This work might mark the starting point for a new field termed 'sonopharmacology' in analogy to the recently established field of</p>
        <p>NATURe CHeMiSTRy photopharmacology 3,4 . In the future, efforts will be dedicated to achieving selective bond cleavage with lower US power, fewer duty cycles, shorter application times and higher frequencies. Those frequencies should be clinically compatible not only with the power densities of tissue-ablating therapeutic US generators (expressed in W cm -2 units) 52 but also with diagnostic US (expressed in mW cm</p>
        <p>NATURe CHeMiSTRy units) 53 . This will be crucial for the mitigation of possible undesired tissue interactions by acoustic heating, cavitation, radiation pressure, force and torque, and acoustic streaming 53 . Moreover, we will strive to combine our systems with HIFU 12,22 and theranostic US 13 (to achieve tissue penetration depths in the centimetre range) as well as synergistic US techniques such as sonodynamic therapy 15 and sonobactericide 14 .</p>

        <p>Sonication experiments. Sonication experiments on P UMB and P CPT were carried out using a Sonics VCX 500 W ultrasonic processor with a 13 mm solid full-wave probe, 254 mm long, frequency f = 20 kHz and 30% of the maximum amplitude of 125 μm. The input sonication energy E (in joules) was recorded during sonication and used to calculate sonication power P = Et -1 and power intensity I P = P A -1 , where t is effective sonication 'on' time and A is the area of the probe tip. Pulsed sonication (2.0 s on, 1.0 s off) was used, and over the full duration of the sonication this corresponds to t = 9,600 s, E = 202,292 J, P = 21.07 W, A = 1.33 cm 2 and I P = 15.84 W cm -2 . The disulfide polymer was dissolved in MeCN or MeCN:H 2 O (v:v = 2:3) and injected into a cooled Suslick cell immersed in an ice-water bath with a constant flow of N 2 . Then the mixture was exposed to ex situ sonication for a given time and samples for ultraviolet-visible, fluorescence spectroscopy and the MTS proliferation assay were taken during the process. To obtain P CPT fragments without CPT, P CPT was sonicated for 240 min, the resulting solution dried, dissolved in H 2 O and dialysed (membrane MWCO: 10 kDa) to only retain macromolecular fragments, but not CPT.</p>
        <p>Ultrasonication experiments on P APT , PN and NP assemblies were performed in a 1 ml ultrasonication vessel (heavy-walled test tube, 2775/2, Assistant) with a Qsonica Q125 sonicator equipped with a 3-mm-diameter microtip probe (A12628PRB20) at 50% amplitude and f = 20 kHz. The input sonication energy E (in joules) was recorded during sonication and used to calculate sonication power P = E t -1 and power intensity I P = P A -1 , where t is effective sonication 'on' time and A is the area of the probe tip. Pulsed sonication (1.0 s on, 1.0 s off) was used, and over the full duration of the sonication this corresponds to t = 1,800 s, E = 4,551 J, P = 2.53 W, A = 0.07 cm 2 and I P = 36.14 W cm -2 . The vessel was placed in an ice bath to maintain a temperature inside the vessel of 6-9 °C throughout sonication. To investigate the release of antibiotics from their complexes with nucleic acids, Cy3-Paromo was incubated with P APT (8.5 µm) with a ratio of 1:1.5 according to the method described above. The sonication treatments were performed as described above. The 800 µl of complex suspension was filled into a 1.2 ml cylindrical glass tube and the ultrasonic emitter was immersed into the middle of the solution. At defined times, 20 µl of solution were pipetted and taken out for further gel electrophoresis.</p>
        <p>HeLa cells were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of CPT, initiator CPT, P CPT and POEGMEA in addition to the sonicated polymer 2. HeLa cells were cultured in a basal medium consisting of DMEM, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics/antimycotics at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 and 95% humidity. Actual cell viability was monitored by using a tetrazolium compound 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (inner salt, MTS reagent) and a chemical electron acceptor dye (phenazine ethosulfate; PES) in an assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, approximately 5,000 cells in 100 µl of medium were seeded into 96-well microtitre plates. After overnight incubation, the culture medium was removed and exchanged with fresh medium (100 µl) containing different concentrated test compounds. Control cultures were treated with DMSO alone. The final concentration of DMSO in the medium did not exceed 0.5%. After 48 h incubation, the cell culture media was removed and the cells were washed with 100 µl PBS buffer, then 20 µl MTS reagent with 100 µl fresh medium were added to the cells. The mixture of MTS reagent with cell culture media served as a negative control. The resulting suspension was mixed thoroughly and the absorbance was monitored using a microplate spectrophotometer at 490 nm (SpectraMax M3 microplate reader, Molecular Devices). MTS signals after 2 h were used for survival and proliferation determination. All the cultures were performed as triplicates. MIC test. First, S. aureus was allowed to grow in Mueller-Hinton Broth (MHB) for 8-10 h to reach its late log phase. Before use, bacteria were diluted to around 10 6 c.f.u. ml -1 . Then the bacteria were mixed with different amounts of APT/ P APT @NeoB solution to a final volume of 100 µl. At predefined intervals (0, 5, 10, 20 and 30 min) during in situ US treatment, 50 µl of treated solution was taken out and mixed with 50 µl MHB in a 96-well plate with a final concentration of 5×10 5 c.f.u. ml -1 of S. aureus. Then the ultrasonicated bacteria were allowed to grow for 8-10 h at 37 °C to reach their late log phase. Finally, the optical density of bacterial growth was measured by plate reader at a wavelength of 600 nm. Bacteria samples without APT/P APT @NeoB complex were treated in the same way as the control. Cell culturing experiments were performed in triplicates with three independent experiments repeated on different days.</p>
        <p>The antimicrobial activity of as-synthesized nanoparticles and assembled structures was also examined by a MIC assay. First, S. aureus (strain ATCC 6538) cells were cultured in MHB at 37 °C and shaken at 275 r.p.m. until the stationary phase was reached. The cultured bacteria were then collected by centrifugation and washed with 0.85% NaCl solution at least three times. Optical density measurement at 600 nm was used to determine the concentration of the re-suspended bacterial solution. Then, 50 μl of bacteria solution was mixed with another 50 μl compound or nanostructure solutions in a 96-well plate, reaching a final bacterial concentration of 5 × 10 5 c.f.u. ml -1 . Concentration of compound or nanostructures cultured with bacteria varied in half-fold. After overnight incubation, the optical density (OD) value of the MIC endpoint, the lowest concentration of compound at which there is no visible growth, was read and recorded by a plate reader (SpectraMax M3 microplate reader, Molecular Devices). Growth control groups treated with nanostructures were cultured at the same time as the background cut-off for OD measurement.
