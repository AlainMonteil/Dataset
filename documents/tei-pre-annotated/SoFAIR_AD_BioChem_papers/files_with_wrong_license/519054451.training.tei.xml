        <p>In the EUR sample, the SNP-based heritability (h 2 SNP ) (that is, the proportion of variance in liability attributable to all measured SNPs)</p>
        <p>S ch iz ophrenia has a heritability of 60-80% 1 , much of which is attributable to common risk alleles. Here, in a two-stage genome-wide association study of up to 76,755 individuals with schizophrenia and 243,649 control individuals, we report common variant associations at 287 distinct genomic loci. Associations were concentrated in genes that are expressed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the central nervous system, but not in other tissues or cell types. Using fine-mapping and functional genomic data, we identify 120 genes (106 protein-coding) that are likely to underpin associations at some of these loci, including 16 genes with credible causal non-synonymous or untranslated region variation. We also implicate fundamental processes related to neuronal function, including synaptic organization, differentiation and transmission. Fine-mapped candidates were enriched for genes associated with rare disruptive coding variants in people with schizophrenia, including the glutamate receptor subunit GRIN2A and transcription factor SP4, and were also enriched for genes implicated by such variants in neurodevelopmental disorders. We identify biological processes relevant to schizophrenia pathophysiology; show convergence of common and rare variant associations in schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders; and provide a resource of prioritized genes and variants to advance mechanistic studies.</p>
        <p>Schizophrenia typically manifests in late adolescence or early adulthood 1 and is associated with reduced life expectancy, increased risk of suicide 2 , serious physical illnesses 3 and substantial health and social costs. Treatments are at least partially effective in most people, but many have chronic symptoms, and adverse treatment effects are common 4 . There is a need for new therapeutic targets to be discovered, but this process is impeded by our limited understanding of pathophysiology.</p>
        <p>Much of the between-individual variation in risk is genetic, and involves large numbers of common alleles 5 , rare copy number variants (CNVs) 6 and rare coding variants 7,8 . A previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) reported 176 genomic loci containing common alleles associated with schizophrenia 9 but the causal variants that drive these associations and the biological consequences of these variants are largely unknown. To increase our understanding of the contribution of common variants to schizophrenia, we performed what is to our knowledge the largest GWAS of the disorder to date and analysed the findings to prioritize variants, genes and biological processes that contribute to pathogenesis.</p>
        <p>We performed a primary GWAS in 74,776 individuals with schizophrenia (hereafter, cases) and 101,023 control individuals, followed by an extended GWAS, which included additional data for the most significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Methods). In the primary GWAS, we combined by meta-analysis (i) individual genotypes from a core Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) dataset of 90 cohorts of European (EUR) and East Asian (ASN) ancestry from the PGC, totalling 67,390 cases and 94,015 controls; and (ii) summary-level data from 7,386 cases and 7,008 controls from 9 cohorts of African American (AA) and Latino (LAT) ancestry 10 . We analysed up to 7,585,078 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a minor allele frequency (MAF) greater than or equal to 1% in 175,799 individuals of whom 74.3% were EUR, 17.5% ASN, 5.7% AA and 2.5% LAT (see 'Case-control sample descriptions' in the Supplementary Information). This primary GWAS identified 313 independent SNPs (linkage disequilibrium (LD) r 2 &lt; 0.1) that exceeded genome-wide significance (P &lt; 5 × 10 -8 ) (Extended Data Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1), spanning 263 distinct loci.</p>
        <p>In the extended GWAS, we meta-analysed the primary GWAS results with summary statistics from deCODE genetics (1,979 cases, 142,626 controls) for index SNPs with P &lt; 10 -5 and identified 342 linkage-disequilibrium-independent significant SNPs (Supplementary Table 2) located in 287 loci (Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary Figs. 1,2). Comparisons with the 128 associations (108 loci) we reported in 2014 are provided (Supplementary Note); one association (rs3768644; chr2:72.3 Mb) is no longer supported 11 .</p>
        <p>Separate GWASs for male and female individuals had a genetic correlation (r g ) that was statistically indistinguishable from 1 (r g = 0.992, standard error (s.e.) = 0.024). These and other analyses (Supplementary Note) show that common variant genetic liability to schizophrenia is essentially identical in male and female individuals despite reported sex differences in age at onset, symptom profile, course and outcome 12 .</p>
        <p>Of 7,315 Gene Ontology (GO) classifications, 24 were associated with schizophrenia (Supplementary Table 7). All were relevant to neuronal function, including development, differentiation and synaptic transmission, and involved multiple cellular components, including ion channels, synapses and both axon and dendritic annotations. Using the curated ontology of the SynGO consortium 19 , we further examined the synaptic signal and found that conditionally significant annotations were mainly within postsynaptic terms (Supplementary Tables 8,9), although enrichment was also found for genes involved in synaptic organization and signalling.</p>
        <p>To facilitate biological interpretation and laboratory follow-up, we sought to prioritize specific variants and genes that are most likely to explain associations using a combination of fine-mapping, transcriptomic analysis and functional genomic annotations. The initial steps in these procedures were necessarily based on 293 index SNPs (255 loci) that attained significance in the core PGC dataset (Methods, Supplementary Table 10); we then focused on the loci that remained significant in the full extended GWAS to maximize robustness (Fig. 1).</p>
        <p>We performed stepwise analyses (Supplementary Note), conditioning associations in loci on their index SNP (and any subsequent conditionally independent associations) to identify regions that contained independent signals (conditional P &lt; 10 -6 ). This analysis supported the existence of independent associations in around 10% of loci (Supplementary Table 10b).</p>
        <p>We also used the Bayesian fine-mapping method implemented in FINEMAP 20 to infer the most likely number of distinct causal variants driving our GWAS results. FINEMAP was based on 255 regions determined by the linkage disequilibrium clumping procedure (Supplementary Table 11e), after merging clumps if their boundaries physically overlapped and excluding the extended major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region (Methods). For regions predicted to contain three or fewer causal variants (n = 249; Fig. 1, Supplementary Tables 11a, b), we extracted from FINEMAP the posterior probability (PP) of being causal for every SNP across the region, and constructed credible sets of SNPs that cumulatively capture 95% of the regional PP (Supplementary Note).</p>
        <p>For 33 regions, the 95% credible set contained 5 or fewer SNPs (Supplementary Table 11c) and for 9, only a single SNP. We highlight rs4766428 (PP &gt; 0.99) which is the only credible SNP in a locus that contains 25 genes and is located within ATP2A2. Mutations in ATP2A2 2 | Gene set enrichment tests at the genome-wide level and for protein-coding genes that contain FINEMAP credible SNPs. Gene sets tested were retrieved from sequencing studies of schizophrenia 30 , ASD 34 and developmental disorders (DD) 33 . Sets representing genes that are intolerant to loss-of function mutations 41 (LoF-intolerant) and brain-expressed genes 42 are also shown. a, MAGMA gene set enrichment analysis. Dotted line indicates nominal significance (P = 0.05). b, Logistic regression (with Firth's bias reduction method) showing the odds ratio (and 95% CI) for association between protein-coding genes that contain at least 1 credible FINEMAP SNP (n = 418 after excluding genes with no LoF-intolerance data) and genes from the sets indicated. Odds ratios are relative to protein-coding genes within GWAS K ≤ 3.5 loci (1,283 genes; squares) or across the genome excluding the extended MHC 43 21 , which co-segregates with bipolar disorder in several multiplex pedigrees and is associated with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia at a population level 22 . ATP2A2 encodes a sarcoplasmic or endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump, suggesting that its role in schizophrenia pathogenesis may be through regulating neuronal levels of cytoplasmic calcium. The probable relevance of calcium metabolism is also suggested by enrichment for associations in and around voltage-gated calcium channels (Supplementary Tables 3,7).</p>
        <p>We denote as our broad fine-map set 628 genes (435 protein-coding) that contained at least one credible SNP (Fig. 1a). At a genome-wide level, genes that are expressed in the brain, and that are relatively intolerant to loss-of-function mutations, are known to be enriched for schizophrenia associations, and this was confirmed here (Fig. 2a). Protein-coding genes in the broad fine-map set were enriched for these properties compared to the other protein-coding genes within the associated regions (Fig. 2b), consistent with genes in this set having an increased probability of influencing liability to schizophrenia. To identify the most credible causal genes, we prioritized those mapping to the 287 loci that were genome-wide significant in our extended GWAS that also contained (a) at least one non-synonymous or untranslated region (UTR) variant with a PP &gt; 0.1; (b) the entire credible set (Supplementary Tables 13,14). These protein-coding genes had a greater-than-threefold enrichment for loss-of-function intolerance compared with other protein-coding genes within the loci that were not tagged by credible SNPs (Supplementary Table 15, Supplementary Note), supporting our strategy to delimit credible causal genes.</p>
        <p>Among the 70 FINEMAP prioritized genes (64 protein-coding) were 16 genes (protein-coding by definition) based on non-synonymous or UTR variants (Supplementary Table 13). These include SLC39A8, in which rs13107325-previously a moderately high credible SNP 23 -is now strongly supported as causal (PP &gt; 0.99). Other non-synonymous variants with a high PP were found in genes with minimal functional characterization, including THAP8 and WSCD2, and in two genes that encode E3 ubiquitin ligases, PJA1 and CUL9. Missense and UTR variants prioritized interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), and the transcription factor KLF6 was highlighted by three variants in the 3′-UTR. Finally, we identified 61 genes (55 protein-coding) in which the 95% credible set was restricted to a single gene (Supplementary Table 14).</p>
        <p>To detect GWAS associations that are credibly explained by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)-that is, variants that influence gene expression-we used summary-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) 24 to find evidence that GWAS signals co-localize with eQTLs (from adult brain 25 , fetal brain 26 or whole blood 27 ) and the HEIDI test 24 to then reject co-localizations due to linkage disequilibrium between distinct schizophrenia-associated and eQTL variants (Supplementary Table 16). To retain brain relevance, we considered only findings from the blood that were replicated in the brain. After removing duplicates identified in multiple tissues (Supplementary Table 17a-c), we identified 101 SMR-implicated genes (Supplementary Table 17d); the use of alternative methodologies supported the robustness of the SMR findings (Supplementary Note, Supplementary Table 17e).</p>
        <p>We used three approaches to prioritize genes from these 101 candidates (Supplementary Note, Supplementary Tables 17f, g, 18). We identified (i) 32 genes as the single SMR-implicated gene at the locus or through conditional analysis of a locus containing multiple candidates; (ii) 16 genes in which the putatively causal eQTLs captured 50% or more of the FINEMAP posterior probability; and (iii) 29 genes in which chromatin conformation analysis (Hi-C analysis of adult and fetal brain) suggested that a promoter of that gene interacted with a putative regulatory element containing a FINEMAP credible SNP 28 .</p>
        <p>After removing duplicates, 55 genes were prioritized by SMR or SMR-Hi-C (Supplementary Table 12), of which 46 were protein-coding. Genes in which putatively causal eQTLs captured a particularly high FINEMAP PP (greater than 95%) (Supplementary Table 17g) included: ACE, which encodes angiotensin-converting enzyme-the target of a major class of anti-hypertensive drugs (underexpressed in schizophrenia); DCLK3, which encodes a neuroprotective kinase 29 (underexpressed in schizophrenia); and SNAP91 (discussed below; overexpressed in schizophrenia).</p>
        <p>Combining all approaches, FINEMAP and SMR, we prioritized 120 genes, of which 106 are protein-coding (Fig. 1, Extended Data Table 1).</p>
        <p>Following the findings from the genome-wide enrichment tests, we examined prioritized genes in the context of synaptic location and</p>
        <p>function in the SynGO database 19 (Fig. 3). Of the 106 proteins encoded, 15 have synaptic annotations (Supplementary Table 19): 7 postsynaptic, 5 both pre-and postsynaptic, 2 presynaptic, and 1 gene not mapped to any specific compartment. These results are consistent with the genome-wide enrichment tests that point to postsynaptic pathology. However, many prioritized genes had additional locations, suggesting that presynaptic pathology may also be involved. The encoded proteins map to 16 unique biological terms in the hierarchy (Supplementary Table 19), but there are specific themes. Multiple genes encode receptors and ion channels, including voltage-gated calcium and chloride channels (CACNA1C and CLCN3), metabotropic receptors (glutamate (GRM1) and GABA (GABBR2)), and the ligand-gated N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit (GRIN2A). Others encode proteins that have a role in endocytosis (SNAP91), synaptic organization and differentiation (DLGAP2, LRRC4B, GPM6A, PAK6 and PTPRD; this group also includes PTPRD, a receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase presynaptic organizer that trans-synaptically interacts with multiple postsynaptic cell adhesion molecules, for example, IL1RAPL1) and modulation of chemical transmission (MAPK3, DCC, CLCN3 and DLGAP2). The diversity of synaptic proteins identified in this study suggests that multiple functional interactions of schizophrenia risk converge on synapses. It remains to be determined whether these interactions occur at a limited set of specific synapse types, or whether the diversity points to several types in different brain regions.</p>

        <p>The Schizophrenia Exome Sequencing Meta-Analysis (SCHEMA) consortium identified 32 genes with damaging ultra-rare mutations associated with schizophrenia (false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05), including 10 at exome-wide significance 30 . We found that both sets of genes were enriched for common variant associations, as were more weakly associated SCHEMA genes down to uncorrected P &lt; 0.001 (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Tables 20,21). Moreover, within associated loci, protein-coding genes that contained one or more FINEMAP credible SNPs were enriched for SCHEMA genes relative to other protein-coding genes (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Table 21).</p>
        <p>There are rare variant overlaps in liability to schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and developmental disorder 8,31,32 . We found that genes in which rare variants increase risk of ASD and developmental disorder 33,34 are also enriched for schizophrenia common variant associations. Moreover, they are also enriched among genes that contain FINEMAP credible SNPs (Fig. 2, Supplementary Tables 20,21). Convergences between rare variants and fine-mapped GWAS signals have been previously observed in other traits 35,36 , suggesting that genes that are most strongly implicated by fine-mapping and which have additional support from rare variant data are compelling candidates. Of the 10 exome-wide significant genes identified by 
            <rs type="software">SCHEMA</rs> 37 , two were prioritized candidates from fine-mapping: GRIN2A, which encodes a glutamatergic NMDA receptor subunit; and SP4, a transcription factor that is highly expressed in the brain, which is regulated by NMDA transmission and also regulates NMDA receptor abundance 38 . Two other genes supported by 
            <rs type="software">SCHEMA</rs> at FDR &lt; 0.05 had strong support from fine-mapping: STAG1, which is involved in controlling chromosome segregation and regulating gene expression; and FAM120A, which encodes an RNA-binding protein. SNPs mapping to these genes had cumulative FINEMAP PPs of 0.88 and 0.72, respectively (Supplementary Table 11b). The prioritized fine-mapped set also contained four genes implicated in developmental disorder: a transcriptional regulator (BCL11B); the well-known CACNA1C 39 ; and genes mentioned elsewhere in this paper (GRIN2A and SLC39A8). Genes that encode additional transcriptional regulators are also of note; RERE, FOXP1 and MYT1L. RERE was prioritized by SMR and is associated with developmental disorder. FOXP1 and MYT1L are associated with both developmental disorder and ASD and met our fine-mapping prioritization criteria in the core PGC dataset (Supplementary Table 12).
        </p>
        <p>We have performed the largest-to our knowledge-GWAS of schizophrenia so far and in doing so, have identified a substantial increase in the number of associated loci. We show that genes we prioritize within associated loci by fine-mapping are enriched for those with an increased burden of rare deleterious mutations in schizophrenia, and identify GRIN2A, SP4, STAG1 and FAM120A as specific genes in which the convergence of rare and common variant associations strongly supports their pathogenic role in the disorder. Notably, this convergence also implies that the pathogenic relevance of altered function of these genes extends beyond the small proportion of cases that carry rare mutations. We also show that common variant schizophrenia associations are enriched at genes that are implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting that the increasing power of rare variant studies of those disorders could be used to further prioritize genes from GWAS studies. Exploiting this, in addition to GRIN2A we identify BCL11B, CACNA1C, RERE, FOXP1, MYT1L and SLC39A8 as genes with strong support.</p>
        <p>Enrichment of common variant associations was restricted to genes that are expressed in neurons of the central nervous system-both excitatory and inhibitory-and that have roles in fundamental biological processes related to neuronal function. This indicates that neurons are the most important site of pathology in schizophrenia. We also show that genes with high relative specificity for expression in almost all tested brain regions are enriched for genetic association. This suggests that abnormal neuronal function in schizophrenia is not confined to a small number of brain structures, which in turn might explain its diverse psychopathology, association with a broad range of cognitive impairments and lack of regional specificity in neuroimaging measures 1 .</p>
        <p>Disrupted neuronal function in schizophrenia is unlikely to be restricted to the synapse, but the concentration of associations in genes with pre-and postsynaptic locations, and with functions related to synaptic organization, differentiation and transmission, point to the pathophysiological importance of these neuronal compartments and their attendant functions. This is further supported by studies showing substantial effects on schizophrenia risk of CNVs 40 and rare damaging coding variants in genes with similar functions, including some of the same genes 30 . Genomic studies, therefore, converge in highlighting these areas of biology as targets for research that aims for a mechanistic understanding of schizophrenia. The large number of prioritized genes and variants identified here offer an empirically supported resource for that endeavour.</p>

        <p>The study protocols were approved by the institutional review board at each centre involved with recruitment. Informed consent and permission to share the data were obtained from all individuals, in compliance with the guidelines specified by the institutional review boards pf the recruiting centres. Genotyping of samples recruited in mainland China were processed and analysed by Chinese groups on Chinese local servers, to comply with the Human Genetic Resources Administrative Regulations.</p>
        <p>Details of each of the samples (including sample size, ancestry and whether included in the previous publication by the PGC) are given in the 'Case-control sample descriptions' section of the Supplementary Information. The core PGC dataset included 90 cohorts for which we had individual-level genotype data fully processed under a uniform pipeline. This core dataset contains genotypes on 161,405 unrelated individuals; 67,390 cases of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 94,015 control individuals, equivalent in power to 73,189 of each. A parent-proband trio is considered to comprise one case and one control. Approximately half (31,914 cases and 47,176 controls) of the samples were not included in the previous GWAS of the PGC 11 . Around 80% of the probands (53,386 cases and 77,258 controls) were of European (EUR) ancestry, and the remainder (14,004 cases and 16757 controls) were of East Asian (ASN) ancestry 9 . We also included in the primary GWAS summary statistics from 9 cohorts comprising African American (AA; 6,152 cases 3918 controls) and Latino (LAT; 1,234 cases, 3,090 controls) participants; the combined sample is equivalent in power to 6,551 each of cases and controls. A total of 1,249 linkage-disequilibrium-independent (r 2 &gt; 0.1) variants showing evidence for association (P &lt; 1 × 10 -5 ) were further meta-analysed with an additional dataset of 1,979 cases and 142,626 controls of European ancestry obtained from deCODE genetics; thus, the final analysis represents 320,404 diploid genomes.</p>
        <p>Technical quality control of the 90 cohorts that comprise the primary PGC sample. Technical quality control was performed on the core PGC cohorts separately according to standards developed by the PGC 44 including SNP missingness &lt; 0.05 (before sample removal); subject missingness &lt; 0.02; autosomal heterozygosity deviation (|F het | &lt; 0.2); SNP missingness &lt; 0.02 (after sample removal); difference in SNP missingness between cases and controls &lt; 0.02; and SNP Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE: P &gt; 10 -6 in controls or P &gt; 10 -10 in cases). For family-based cohorts we excluded individuals with more than 10,000 Mendelian errors and SNPs with more than 4 Mendelian errors. For X-chromosomal genotypes we applied an additional round of the above quality control to the male and female subgroups separately.</p>
        <p>Genomic quality control, principal component analysis and relatedness checking in the core PGC dataset. We performed principal component analysis (PCA) for all 90 cohorts separately using SNPs with high imputation quality (INFO &gt; 0.8), low missingness (&lt;1%), MAF &gt; 0.05 and in relative linkage equilibrium (LD) after 2 iterations of LD pruning (r 2 &lt; 0.2, 200 SNP windows). We removed well known long-range-LD areas (MHC and chr8 inversion). Thus, we retained between 57,000 and 95,000 autosomal SNPs in each cohort. SNPs present in all 90 cohorts (n = 7,561) were used for robust relatedness testing using 
            <rs type="software">PLINK</rs> v.
            <rs type="version">1.9 45</rs> ; pairs of subjects with PIHAT &gt; 0.2 were identified and one member of each pair removed at random, preferentially retaining cases and trio members over case-control members.
        </p>
        <p>To control for false positive associations due to inflated test statistics we evaluated the effectiveness of the primary technical and genomic quality control parameters on the genome-wide inflation of test statistics using the lambda GC (median) 46 and as necessary made the quality control parameters more stringent until this value was between 1.0 and 1.4 (before inclusion of principal components as covariates) and/or between 1.0 and 1.15 after inclusion of PCA covariates. In addition, we applied loose PCA filters for strongly stratified datasets even if we did not observe strong inflation of test statistics so as to retrieve reliable test statistics (see Supplementary Fig. 4). As the core PGC cohorts came from many distinct centres, countries and continents, various measures (for example, tightening of the technical quality control parameters and/or genomic quality control) had to be taken in an iterative process to achieve this goal.</p>
        <p>Supplementary Table 22 lists detailed per-cohort exclusion numbers for individuals in the non-Asian samples. The Asian cohorts were sufficiently homogeneous as they did not show marked population structure in PCAs. The exclusion numbers for individuals during technical quality control are in most cohorts low. For six cohorts (marked in yellow in Supplementary Table 22) it was necessary to exclude more than 100 cases during genomic quality control so that Lambda GC fell within the window mentioned above. Supplementary Figure 4 gives details about this process and explains why the excluded cases could not be used with the presently available control cohorts for this manuscript.</p>
        <p>Imputation of the core PGC dataset. Genotype imputation of case control cohorts was performed using the pre phasing/imputation stepwise approach implemented in 
            <rs type="software">EAGLE 2</rs> (ref. 47 ) or 
            <rs type="software">MINIMAC3</rs> (ref. 48 ) (with 132 genomic windows of variable size and default parameters). The imputation reference consisted of 54,330 phased haplotypes with 36,678,882 variants from the publicly available HRC reference, release 1.1 49 Chromosome X imputation was conducted using individuals who passed quality control for the autosomal analysis. Chromosome X imputation and association analysis was performed separately for male and female individuals. For trio-based cohorts, families with multiple (N) affected offspring were split into N parent offspring trios, duplicating the parental genotype information. Trios were phased with SHAPEIT 3 (ref. 50 ). We created pseudo-controls based on the non-transmitted alleles from the parents. Phased case-pseudo-control genotypes were then taken forward to the IMPUTE4 algorithm 51 into the above HRC reference panel.
        </p>
        <p>Association and meta-analysis. In each individual cohort, association testing was based on an additive logistic regression model using 
            <rs type="software">PLINK</rs> 52 . As covariates we used a subset of the first 20 principal components (PCA), derived within each cohort. By default, we included the first four PCAs and thereafter every PCA that was nominally significantly associated (P &lt; 0.05) to case-control status. PCAs in trios were only used to remove extreme ancestry outliers. We conducted a meta-analysis of the results (including the nine cohorts comprising African American and Latino participants) using a standard error inverse-weighted fixed effects model. For chromosome X, gene dosages in male individuals were scored 0 or 2; in female individuals, 0/1/2. We summarized the associations as number of independently associated index SNPs. Index SNPs were LD-independent and had r 2 &lt; 0.1 within 3-Mb windows. We recorded the left and rightmost variant with r 2 &lt; 0.1 to an index SNP to define an associated clump. To define loci, we added a 50-kb window on each side of the LD clump and combined overlapping LD clumps into a single locus.
        </p>
        <p>Owing to the strong signal and high linkage disequilibrium in the MHC, only one SNP was kept from the extended MHC region (chr6: 25-35 Mb).</p>
        <p>We additionally examined the X chromosome for evidence of heterogeneity between the sexes and X chromosome dosage compensation using methods described previously 53 (Supplementary Note). To minimize possible confounding effects of ancestry on effect sizes by sex, we restricted this analysis to those of European ancestry.

        <p>We obtained summary association results from deCODE genetics for 1,228 index SNPs (P &lt; 1 × 10 -5 ) based on 1,979 cases and 142,626 control individual of European ancestry. Genotyping was carried out at deCODE Genetics. We used this sample to establish that SNP associations from the primary GWAS replicated en masse in an independent sample (see Supplementary Note) by showing that the directions of effect of index SNPs differed from the null hypothesis of randomly oriented effects and also comparing the expected number of same direction effects with those if all associations were true, taking into account the discovery magnitude of effect and the replication effect estimate precision (Supplementary Note).</p>
        <p>The summary statistics from deCODE were combined with those from our primary GWAS dataset using an inverse variance-weighted fixed effects model. In a similar manner to the discovery meta-analysis (see above), we merged overlapping LD clumps to a total of 287 distinct genomic regions (5 on the X chromosome) with at least one genome-wide significant signal.</p>
        <p>We estimated the cumulative contribution of SNPs to polygenic risk of schizophrenia using a series of leave-one-out polygenic prediction analyses based on LD clumping and P-value thresholding (P + T) 5 (also known as C + T) using 
            <rs type="software">PLINK</rs> 52 . For calculating polygenic scores, we included the most significant SNP for any pair of SNPs within &lt;500 kb and with LD r 2 &gt; 0.1. We included only those with MAF &gt; 1%. We considered a range of P-value thresholds; 5 × 10 -8 , 1 × 10 -6 , 1 × 10 -4 , 1 × 10 -3 , 1 × 10 -2 , 5 × 10 -2 , 1 × 10 -1 , 2 × 10 -1 , 5 × 10 -1 and 1.0. We performed logistic regression analysis within each case-control sample, to assess the relationship between case status and PRS (P + T) quantiles. The same principal components used for each GWAS were used as covariates for this analysis. Whenever the number of controls at a quantile was less than five times the number of covariates 54 , or if the higher bound for the PRS odds ratio (OR) became infinity, Firth's penalized likelihood method was used to compute regression statistics, as implemented in the 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> package '
            <rs type="software">logistf</rs>' 55 . ORs from these calculations were then meta-analysed using a fixed-effects model in the 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> package '
            <rs type="software">metafor</rs>' 56 . To ensure stability of the estimates, meta-analysis was conservatively restricted to casecontrol samples that contained more than 10 individuals in the top 1% PRS, with at least one of them being a control. Analogous analyses were conducted to assess the ORs between individuals at the top and bottom quantiles. To assess the performance of PRS as a predictor of schizophrenia case status, we calculated liability R 2 , Nagelkerke's R 2 following a previous report 57 and a combined AUROC. Both liability R 2 and Nagelkerke's R 2 included any principal components marginally associated with the outcome within each cohort, in the baseline model. AUROC was estimated using the non-parametric meta-analysis implemented in the 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> package '
            <rs type="software">nsROC</rs>' 58 . Polygenic score analysis of the African American and Latino cohorts were conducted by the authors of the study reporting those datasets 10 .
        </p>
        <p>Some of the secondary analyses (gene set enrichments, conditional SNP association analyses, fine-mapping) necessitate access to individual-level data and require identical quality control and imputation procedures and/or an accurate linkage disequilibrium reference panel, meaning that these analyses could only be reliably performed in a subset of the dataset. The following analyses focused on the core PGC dataset, for which these conditions are met.</p>
        <p>Tissue and cell types. We collected bulk RNA-seq data across 53 human tissues (GTEx v.8, median across samples) 14 ; from a study of 19,550 nuclei from frozen adult human post-mortem hippocampus and prefrontal cortex representing 16 different cell types 17 ; from a study of around 10,000 single cells from 5 mouse brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, midbrain and striatum, in addition to specific enrichments for oligodendrocytes, dopaminergic neurons, serotonergic neurons and cortical parvalbuminergic interneurons) that identified 24 cell types 16 ; and from a study of around 500,000 single cells from the mouse nervous system (19 regions) that identified 265 cell types 18 .</p>
        <p>Datasets were processed uniformly 59 . First, we calculated the mean expression for each gene for each type of data if these statistics were not provided by the authors. We used the pre-computed median expression (transcripts per million (TPM)) across individuals for the GTEx tissues (v.8). For the GTEx dataset, we excluded tissues with fewer than 100 samples, merged tissues by organ (with the exception of brain tissues) and excluded non-natural tissues (for example, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphocytes) and testis (outlier in hierarchical clustering), resulting in 37 tissues. Genes without unique names and genes not expressed in any cell types were excluded. We scaled the expression data to 1 million unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) or TPM for each cell type (or tissue). After scaling, we excluded non-protein-coding genes, and, for mouse datasets, genes that had no expert curated 1:1 orthologues between mouse and human (Mouse Genome Informatics, The Jackson Laboratory, version 22 November 2016). We then calculated a metric of gene expression specificity by dividing the expression of each gene in each cell type (or tissue) by the total expression of that gene in all cell types (or tissues), leading to values ranging from 0 to 1 for each gene (0 meaning that the gene is not expressed in that cell type (or tissue); 1 meaning that 100% of the expression of that gene is performed in that cell type (or tissue)). We selected the 10% most-specific genes per cell type (or tissue) with an expression level of at least 1 TPM, or 1 UMI per million, for downstream analyses and used 
            <rs type="software">MAGMA</rs> v.
            <rs type="version">1.08</rs> 60 to test whether they were enriched for genetic associations. We performed a one-sided test as we were only interested in enrichments for genetic associations (in contrast with depletions). We also applied partitioned linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) as described 61 to the top 10% genes for each cell type for heritability enrichment. We selected the one-sided coefficient z-score P value as a measure of the association of the cell type/tissue with schizophrenia.
        </p>
        <p>Ontology gene sets. Gene set analyses were performed using 
            <rs type="software">MAG-MA</rs> v.
            <rs type="version">1.08 60</rs> . Gene boundaries were retrieved from 
            <rs type="software">Ensembl</rs> release 
            <rs type="version">92 (</rs>GRCh37) using the '
            <rs type="software">biomaRt</rs>' 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> package 62 and expanded by 35 kb upstream and 10 kb downstream to include probable regulatory regions 63 . Gene-wide P values were calculated from European and Asian summary statistics separately using the SNP-wise 'mean' Imhof method, and meta-analysed within the software. Linkage disequilibrium reference data files were from the European and East Asian populations of the HRC 64 . Within each gene set analysis, P values were corrected for multiple testing using the Bonferroni procedure Specifically, we tested the following gene sets. (i) Gene Ontology: 7,315 sets extracted from the GO database (http://geneontology.org/, accession date: 09 November 2020) curated to include only annotations with experimental or phylogenetic supporting evidence. (ii) 
            <rs type="software">SynGO</rs> ontology: described elsewhere 19 , this collection was analysed as two subsets; 'biological process' (135 gene sets) and 'cellular component' (60 gene sets). We controlled for a set of 10,360 genes with detectable expression in brain tissue measured as fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) 65 to detect synaptic signals above signals simply reflecting the property of brain expression. Exploiting the hierarchical structure of 
            <rs type="software">SynGO</rs>, gene sets were reconstructed using a 'roll-up' method, in which parent categories contained all genes annotated to child categories. For stepwise conditional testing 23 , we prioritized the most-specific child annotations 66 (that is, the lowest possible level) as regression covariates.
        </p>
        <p>We performed stepwise conditional analyses of 248 loci that were genome-wide significant in the core PGC dataset looking for independent associations. We performed association testing and meta-analysis across each locus, adding the allele dosages of the index SNP as a covariate. Where a second SNP had a conditional P value of less than 1 × 10 -6 , we considered this as evidence for a second signal and repeated the process adding this as an additional covariate. We repeated this until no additional SNPs in the region achieved P &lt; 1 × 10 -6 . We also searched for long range dependencies. Here we tested all the pairs of independent signals for conditional independence (Supplementary Note).</p>
        <p>We used FINEMAP 20 to fine-map regions defined by LD clumps (r 2 &gt; 0.1), excluding the MHC locus owing to its complex LD structure. Clumps that overlapped (without adding the additional 50 kb used to define physically distinct loci) were combined. As fine-mapping requires data from all markers in the region 67 we only performed fine-mapping on regions that attained genome-wide significance in the core PGC GWAS. In total, we attempted to fine-map 255 non-overlapping regions (Supplementary Table 11e). Further details about the fine-mapping process are provided in the Supplementary Note.</p>
        <p>We used SMR 24 as our primary method to identify SNPs that might mediate association with schizophrenia through effects on gene expression. The significance for SMR is set at the Bonferroni-corrected threshold of 0.05/M, in which M is the number of genes with significant eQTLs tested for a given tissue. Significant SMR associations imply co-localization of the schizophrenia associations with eQTL. We applied the HEIDI test 24 to filter out SMR associations (P HEIDI &lt; 0.01) due to linkage disequilibrium between schizophrenia-associated variants and eQTLs. cis-eQTL summary data were from three studies: fetal brain (n = 120) 26 , adult brain (n = around 1,500) 25 and blood (n = around 32,000) 68 . Linkage disequilibrium data required for the HEIDI test 24 were estimated from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) 69 (n = 8,557). We included only genes with at least one cis-eQTL at P eQTL &lt; 5 × 10 -8 , excluding those in MHC regions because of the complexity of this region. For blood, we included only genes with eQTLs in brain. This left 7,803 genes in blood, 10,890 genes in prefrontal cortex and 754 genes in fetal brain for analysis (see Supplementary Note for further details). SMR was performed using data from the primary GWAS. The results were then filtered to exclude significant SMR implicated genes in which the eQTLs did not map within our definition of an associated locus in the extended GWAS meta-analysis of our primary GWAS dataset and the dataset provided by deCODE genetics.</p>
        <p>For genomic regions in which there were multiple genes that showed significant SMR associations, we attempted to resolve these with conditional analysis using GCTA-COJO 70,71 . We selected the top-associated cis-eQTL for one gene (or a set of genes sharing the same cis-eQTL) ran a COJO analysis in the schizophrenia GWAS data and the eQTL data for each of the other genes conditioning on the selected top cis-eQTL. We then reran the SMR and HEIDI analyses using these conditional GWAS and eQTL results.</p>
        <p>We used FUSION 72 and 
            <rs type="software">EpiXcan</rs> 73 as tests of robustness of the SMR results. Details are supplied in the Supplementary Note as are our approaches to prioritizing SMR-associated genes.
