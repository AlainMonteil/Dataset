        <p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to human health worldwide, and the rapid detection and quantification of resistance, combined with antimicrobial stewardship, are key interventions to combat the spread and emergence of AMR . Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) systems are the collective set of diagnostic processes that facilitate the phenotypic and genotypic assessment of AMR and antibiotic susceptibility. Over the past 30 years, only a few high-throughput AST methods have been developed and widely implemented. By contrast, several studies have established proof of principle for various innovative AST methods, including both molecular-based and genome-based methods, which await clinical trials and regulatory review. In this Review , we discuss the current state of AST systems in the broadest technical, translational and implementation-related scope.Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to human health worldwide, and the rapid detection and quantification of resistance, combined with antimicrobial stewardship, are key interventions to combat the spread and emergence of AMR .

        <p>Over the past few decades, the emergence of anti microbial resistance (AMR) has outpaced the develop ment and market entry of new antimicrobial agents 1 , and we need to encourage interventions to preserve the currently available antimicrobials 2 . Antimicrobial sus ceptibility testing (AST) systems can play a major role in achieving this goal. These diagnostic tests inform about drug susceptibility for a particular pathogen and detect possible drug resistance, thus guiding the appropriate use of antimicrobials. The main problem with current AST methods is speed, for in most cases conduct ing AST requires overnight incubation, and it may require 48-72 h to complete, depending on the drugorganism combination. There are many opinions as to what constitutes 'rapid AST' , but most clinical micro biologists define rapid testing as being feasible during a single working shift -that is, within 8 h or less. Rapid AST provides antibiotic susceptibility profiles that can support and facilitate antimicrobial stewardship as well as epidemiological surveillance 3 . How best to manage infectious diseases by combining stewardship, optimized rapid AST and AMR data collection is an important objective for investigation 4 .Over the past few decades, the emergence of anti microbial resistance (AMR) has outpaced the develop ment and market entry of new antimicrobial agents 1 , and we need to encourage interventions to preserve the currently available antimicrobials 2 .

        <p>For the purpose of this Review, we define phenotypic AST as a microbiological procedure whereby a pure culture of a single organism is grown (in solid or liquid media) in the presence or absence of an antimicrobial agent. Microbial growth or inhibition is observed longi tudinally. Phenotypic AST methods provide a direct indication of the susceptibility of a given microorgan ism to an antimicrobial agent at defined concentrations, and in some cases such methods provide a quantitative assessment of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the antibiotic. By contrast, the term ' AMR detection methods' is used to describe methods that detect (pre existing) proteomic or genomic signatures that predict antimicrobial resistance (Fig. 1).For the purpose of this Review, we define phenotypic AST as a microbiological procedure whereby a pure culture of a single organism is grown (in solid or liquid media) in the presence or absence of an antimicrobial agent.

        <p>Although most commercially available and frequently used AST methods have been shown to be reliable and reproducible 5 , the systems are complex and have several limitations, and one of the main limitations is speed, as we mentioned above. The early stage of microbial growth (lag phase) is one time limiting factor 6 . Monitoring cell density in suspension is different from (visually) ana lysing cell division and requires different technological approaches. Density can be monitored by relatively sim ple spectral means, whereas visualization of cells requires sophisticated microscopy. Moreover, growth rate (net cel lular doubling time), the concentration of growth mark ers to be detected, intrinsic natural genetic mutability, fitness decrease following the acquisition of antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation and the ability to transduce, transform or conjugate all need to be taken into account when assessing antimicrobial susceptibility or resistance by AST methods 7 . Antimicrobial susceptibility may dif fer between individual cells, leading to heterogeneous populations; the adequate detection of heterogeneity is clinically important but is difficult with current AST methods 8 . Some bacterial species exhibit mechanisms that drive the emergence of de novo resistance or gene mutations, enabling the rapid adaptation to anti biotics, which may not be detected with current methods 9 . AST usually identifies individual cells that remain alive or in a state of suspended animation in the presence of antimicrobials (tolerance) 10,11 . Distinguishing reversibly growth inhibited as opposed to dead microbial cells may be more difficult but is relevant, as reversal of the inhi bition may increase infection risk once more. Although sensitivity is often limited, some protocols that reliably distinguish growth inhibited from dead cells have been reported 12 . In addition, AMR is also increasing in anaer obes 13 , and specialized infrastructure and laboratory equipment is required in order to conduct AST in the absence of oxygen, which might not be generally availa ble 14 . A number of the compromising aspects of pheno typic tests are unlikely to be improved, as these are of an intrinsic biological nature, such as the duration of the lag or growth phase. The development of new AST methods is slow, costly, logistically complex and riddled with regu latory issues 15 . Current key issues include the needs for improved speed, cost control and platforms that cover as many microorganism-drug combinations as possible. In addition, to enable routine use in clinical microbiology laboratories, the system platform should have a small footprint -since laboratory space is very costly -have low maintenance needs and provide high throughput.Although most commercially available and frequently used AST methods have been shown to be reliable and reproducible 5 , the systems are complex and have several limitations, and one of the main limitations is speed, as we mentioned above.

        <p>Newer AST methods might not directly measure phenotypic cell viability, but rather detect surrogates of viability, such as the modulation of proteins, metabolites, DNA and/or mRNA, or changes in proteomes, metabo lomes, genomes and/or transcriptomes, to provide indi rect evidence of antibiotic susceptibility or resistance 16 . Such tests include proteomic, lipidomic or genotypic methods, which characterize proteins, lipids and fatty acids, or nucleic acids, respectively. A notable limitation is that the correlation between these newer, marker directed methods and classic phenotypic methods may vary across specific combinations of organisms and anti microbial agents 17,18 . For these newer methods to be used in clinical decision making, they need to be calibrated and referenced back to standard phenotypic methods that have been used for many decades. Moreover, pheno typic methods are generally known to predict suscep tibility or resistance more accurately. They can also generate MICs of various antimicrobial agents, even though this usually requires extended incubation and a large inoculum (10 4 -10 6 cells per unit volume) (Box 1). In light of the many reviews on AST that have been pub lished recently [19][20][21][22] , in this Review we aim to assess new technologies in terms of developmental phase, regu latory review and commercialization. First we briefly discuss the routinely used AST methods, and then we explore current efforts to improve phenotypic AST sys tems, including new emerging technologies, as well as genomic and gene based AMR detection methods. We conclude by highlighting the challenges and opportu nities for new rapid AST systems at both the academic and company levels.Newer AST methods might not directly measure phenotypic cell viability, but rather detect surrogates of viability, such as the modulation of proteins, metabolites, DNA and/or mRNA, or changes in proteomes, metabo lomes, genomes and/or transcriptomes, to provide indi rect evidence of antibiotic susceptibility or resistance 16 .

        <p>'Traditional' AST methods include disc diffusion and broth dilution assays, which are used to compare the visible growth of microorganisms in the presence of specific concentrations of antimicrobials under defined test conditions (Supplementary Fig. 1). Analysis is based either on decreased or no visible growth within the zone of inhibition on solid agar, or on the lack of visible turbidity in broth after appropriate incubation. Traditional methods help define the MICs, which are the current reference standard in measuring antibiotic activ ity. These two key AST formats have been automated: during disc diffusion assays, inhibition zones can be read automatically 23 , and several formats of automated broth dilution assays are commercially available 24 .'Traditional' AST methods include disc diffusion and broth dilution assays, which are used to compare the visible growth of microorganisms in the presence of specific concentrations of antimicrobials under defined test conditions (Supplementary Fig. 1).

        <p>The first automated AST instrument was the Autobac1, which was presented as a prototype in 1971 (reF. 25 ). Most of the current automated systems enable high throughput and extensive testing of many microorganism-antibiotic combinations, but they vary in terms of accuracy or time to result. Four automated instruments are currently cleared by the FDA for in vitro diagnostics (IVD): VITEK2 (bioMérieux), MicroScan WalkAway (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics), BD Phoenix (BD Diagnostics) and Sensititre ARIS 2X (Trek Diagnostic Systems). Three of these systems generate rapid (3.5-16 h) results, whereas the fourth (Sensititre ARIS 2X) takes longer on average to report end points.

        <p>All methods that enable to distinguish living cells from dead cells ('omics' formats) Fig. 1 | Schematic overview of antimicrobial susceptibility testing and antimicrobial resistance detection methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) detection methods detect basic features of bacterial variation that result from ecological adaptation, resistance acquisition and evolutionary selection. Phenotypic AST, including the use of selective chromogenic culture media, mostly detects the arrest of growth in the presence of different concentrations of different antimicrobial agents 157 . There is a need for quantifying the cells, however, as inoculum effects may substantially affect determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration 158 . Rapid evolution of phenotypes may occur, and the new methods especially are focused towards circumventing such possible changes, by providing a more definite live-dead distinction 159 . Molecular AMR detection attempts to specify resistance genes, as well as mutations in and expression of these genes or their genomic signature, using molecular-based (both DNA and RNA) methods. This is surrogate AST and has to be validated against phenotypic data to be useful 101,106 . For this method, extensive resistance marker databases and innovative bioinformatics methodologies are mandatory requirements.All methods that enable to distinguish living cells from dead cells ('omics' formats) Fig. 1 | Schematic overview of antimicrobial susceptibility testing and antimicrobial resistance detection methods.

The MicroScan WalkAway is a large incubator and reader that utilizes microdilution trays that are inoculated man ually, incubated and examined for growth. Susceptibility test panels for Gram negative bacteria contain fluoro genic substrates and can be read in 3.5-7 h.

The VITEK2 system uses compact plastic reagent cards that contain small quantities of antimicrobial agents and test media in a 64well format and is based on tur bidimetric monitoring of growth.

        <p>Automating result interpretation for traditional pheno typic analyses. Recently, laboratory automation has become increasingly prominent, and automation is being eagerly adopted in the clinical-diagnostic setting. Information technology is an important aspect of all automation related activities. With Total Laboratory Automation (TLA), instrumentation is utilized to bar code and inoculate culture media, streak culture plates and move the plates to specialized incubators with high resolution cameras that are then used to image the culture plates during the incubation process 33 . The next phases of microbiology laboratory automation include enhancements such as automated disc dispensing and interpretation of disc zone sizes. With the consistent incubation temperature and atmosphere that is provided by the automation system, there is more rapid growth of microorganisms and recovery of fastidious organisms 34 . Thus, it is likely that disc diffusion testing will be able to be read and interpreted earlier, and thus the reference method of disc diffusion will likely be able to provide results more rapidly than current methods when used in the context of laboratory automation 23 . The European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) has already developed standardized rapid lecture protocol cultures for inhibition zones, permit ting disc diffusion testing in 4, 6 and 8 h directly from positive blood.Automating result interpretation for traditional pheno typic analyses.

Still, these methods are rarely incorporated into routine lab oratory use. Analytical methods have been developed to assist clinicians with the interpretation of AST data. AntibiogramJ is a user friendly, free, open source, platform independent tool that uses images of disc dif fusion tests for more reliable interpretation of the size of the inhibition zone 36 . The data are 87% concordant with those generated by an experienced microbiologist. Mobile phone photos can be used for data sharing and independent verification at a distance.

Both are resistant isolates according to all available breakpoints, but many would consider it reasonable to try meropenem in the first but not the second case. Dosing would be adjusted, and meropenem would be given in combination with another agent, but differences in the expression of meropenem resistance markers are worth considering, as the number of effective antimicrobials available for resistant bacteria decreases. such important phenotypic differences may not be reliably detectable using current molecular methods, as the relationship between molecular antimicrobial susceptibility testing systems, quantitative differences in gene copy numbers and the differential expression of genes has not yet been defined in much detail.Emerging methods.

        <p>if bacteria are grown as layers on solid growth media and an antibiotic stops the bacteria from growing or kills them, there will be an area around the place where the antibiotic has been positioned (usually in a well or on a paper disc) where the bacteria have not grown enough to be visible. The radius of such a region of growth inhibition is correlated with the level of antibiotic susceptibility of the strain being tested. This is a highly dynamic area of research and development, with companies being launched and disappearing; hence, this table provides a snapshot rather than a comprehensive list. The companies listed are mostly small or medium sized, with a focus on the translation of academic proof-of-concept or proof-of-principle findings into clinical applications, including dedicated instruments and case-specific assays for as many organism-drug combinations as possible. The diversity shown in the table reflects the fact that the gold standard genomic technology (next-generation sequencing in combination with the bioinformatics pipeline) has certainly not been defined yet, and that it is quite unlikely that this gap will be resolved within the next 5 years. A brief description of efforts to develop genomic tests, often in combination with classic PCR-based methods, is provided.

To enhance the sensitivity of chromo genic media, fluorescent substrates can be added to the media to facilitate the detection of microcolonies after a short incubation 39 . In addition, methods that enable the iden tification of microscopic changes in cell morphology 40 have improved the detection of drug susceptibility, including cumbersome resistance traits such as, for example, polymyxin resistance 41 . These procedures can be directly implemented in microbiology labora tories, without the requirement of new equipment or increased workload. Recently, it was shown that sur face labelling of bacteria substantially shortened the microscopic analysis of AST results in 96well formats using only a standard microplate reader 42 . To improve the current systems, various prototype AST methods with different approaches have been reported, includ ing the use of mobile phones 37 , laser scatter technol ogy 43 , sensing of bacterial vibrations using phase noise measurements on resonant piezo electric substrates 44 , protein adsorbed magnetic nanoparticle mediated proto cols 45 , field effect enzymatic detection 46 , microfluid ics [47][48][49] , glucose metabolization 50 , optical screening and diffusometry 51 , nanometre scale bacterial deformation measurement 52 , mass spectrometry 53 , nanowire sen sors 54 , electrochemical sensing 55 , real time laser scatter ing 56 , atomic force microscopy 57 , fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) 58 , Raman and infrared spectroscopy at the single cell level 59,60 , nanotube assisted micro wave electroporation 61 , hydrodynamic trapping 62 and video microscopy 63 . In this Review, we do not describe these methods in detail, due to the vast differences in the protocols. Figure 2 summarizes some of the newer test principles. It is noteworthy that these methods all require upscaling and transition from experimental to diagnostic laboratories. Furthermore, extensive clinical and outcome studies will be needed to prove their value in the clinical decision making process. One emerging method that is more advanced uses matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time offlight mass spectroscopy (MALDI TOFMS), a technique that is already being used in clinical laboratories for bacte rial identification. MALDI TOFMS is a relatively new technology, and implementation of the technique for the rapid identification of causative bacterial organisms has been shown to be effective. For positive blood cultures, MALDI TOFMS can quickly identify bacterial growth, which accelerates the overall process of AST reporting 64 . Note that the MS applications mentioned above do not change the AST strategy as such. Very recently, a micro dropletbased MALDI TOFMS approach that enables rapid AST was presented 65 . However, clinical trials that can demonstrate direct detection of resistance factors via MALDI TOFMS are still lacking 66 .if bacteria are grown as layers on solid growth media and an antibiotic stops the bacteria from growing or kills them, there will be an area around the place where the antibiotic has been positioned (usually in a well or on a paper disc) where the bacteria have not grown enough to be visible. The radius of such a region of growth inhibition is correlated with the level of antibiotic susceptibility of the strain being tested. This is a highly dynamic area of research and development, with companies being launched and disappearing; hence, this table provides a snapshot rather than a comprehensive list. The companies listed are mostly small or medium sized, with a focus on the translation of academic proof-of-concept or proof-of-principle findings into clinical applications, including dedicated instruments and case-specific assays for as many organism-drug combinations as possible. The diversity shown in the table reflects the fact that the gold standard genomic technology (next-generation sequencing in combination with the bioinformatics pipeline) has certainly not been defined yet, and that it is quite unlikely that this gap will be resolved within the next 5 years. A brief description of efforts to develop genomic tests, often in combination with classic PCR-based methods, is provided.

To enhance the sensitivity of chromo genic media, fluorescent substrates can be added to the media to facilitate the detection of microcolonies after a short incubation 39 .

        <p>Phenotypic AST for mixed bacterial populations. Some AST methods have been developed that can identify resistance in complex mixtures of bacterial species 67,68 . Recently it was shown that the dynamics of kanamycin resistance could be monitored using Raman spectros copy in artificial mixtures of different microbial strains 69 . The fraction of cells that exhibit changes in their individ ual Raman spectrum increases with increasing antibiotic concentrations 59 . This type of AST, sometimes referred to as 'phenotypic resistomics' , would potentially enable many resistance markers in complex microbial popula tions to be catalogued.

        <p>Not all molecu lar methods for the detection of resistance are nucleic acidbased. Several AST methods that involve the direct detection of protein markers of resistance (such as β lactamases) have been described -for example, those using specific protein arrays 71 . These AST methods often involve using antibodies to capture and enrich proteins. Either the antibodies or the proteins can be labelled with fluorescent tags for visualization. The interaction between the antibodies and resistance enzymes requires optimization, but several lateral flow assays (LFAs) have been developed for the detection of β lactamases 72 . An LFA specific to New Delhi metallo βlactamase (NDM) 1 was 100% sensitive and specific in a collection of 350 isolates from Myanmar 73 . Similar performance was established for a combined LFA that detected OXA48, IMP, NDM and VIM enzymes 74 .

        <p>Various non phenotypic methods have recently been reported, which include niche applications of nucleic acid probe array mediated detection of specific resistance genes, for example 79 , and PCR tests for similar targets 80 . Very recently, LAMP, an isothermal molecular amplification method, was used for the detection of AMR defining genes or mutations, leading to detection of AMR in Escherichia coli directly from urine 81 . Molecular detec tion of resistance genes can also benefit from high resolution melting analyses of amplicons after classic PCR. A recent study described a method that combines species identification and AST based on melting curves and machine learning 82 . Despite the technological innovation and rapidity of these methods, more data are needed to evaluate the value they add, and although the first data are being presented, formal publications of the results are still largely missing. The assays descri bed above usually detect a single gene target, or at the most a few targets. These include the methicillin resis tance markers mecA and mecC, the vancomycin resistance markers vanA and vanB, and the genes encod ing extended spectrum β lactamases (ESBLs). Many resistance gene targeting tests, usually PCR based, have entered the market. It would be beyond the scope of this Review to summarize all currently available tests, and the reader is referred to the existing literature 83 .

        <p>Molecular AST assays based on nucleicacid mediated amplification of specific resistance markers have the added the potential for fast TATs to hasten the administration of empiric patient treatment or to allow early adjustment of targeted therapy 85 (Fig. 3). Here we consider all those methods that detect resistance genes to be molecular AMR detection tests, and we note that these methods are essentially indirect surro gates for classic AST methods. The molecular methods currently available have minimal handson time, often use a 'sampletoanswer' approach and are rapid. One of the first systems on the market, the IDIMRSA assay (Infectio Diagnostic), used in combination with the Smart Cycler II rapid DNA amplification system (Cepheid), was used for methicillinresistant Staphyl ococcus aureus (MRSA) screening 86 . Aside from screen ing for MRSA in nasal swabs 87 , tests for the most common vancomycin resistance markers, vanA and vanB 88 , and a screening method for the carbapenem resistance genes bla KPC , bla NDM , bla VIM , bla OXA48 and bla IMP in rectal swabs have been released 89 , and more such tests will be released in the future. However, most of these assays were intended for surveillance rather than for guid ing treatment in the setting of infection. The positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of a specific test will vary depending on local resistance prevalence. New multiplex amplification assays have recently become available for 'syndromic infectious disease' testing, whereby, in addition to organism identification, the detection of resistance genes can be considered another advantage. The BioFire FilmArray BCID panel (TAT ≈ 1 h) identifies 24 common causes of bacteraemia and 3 resistance genes -mecA, vanA/B and bla KPC -from blood cul tures 90 . The Curetis Unyvero system can be used for the diagnosis of pneumonia, implant and tissue infec tion, blood culture infection and intra abdominal infec tion, and includes more comprehensive resistance panels with 19, 17, 16 and 22 resistance markers per test, respectively 91,92 . The Nanosphere VERIGENE sys tem (recently acquired by Luminex) is a blood culture identification system with two panels: Gram positive bacteria and Gram negative bacteria. This system also includes a few resistance markers (mecA, vanA, vanB, bla CTX M , bla IMP , bla KPC , bla NDM , bla OXA and bla VIM ) 93 .

        <p>A trend towards the use of genomic rather than gene based methods for the combined identification of bacterial species and antibiotic resistance is emerging in the diagnostic market. Applying whole genome sequencing (WGS) enables essentially all genes involved in AMR to be traced. In principle, this would facilitate comprehensive genomic cataloguing of all resistance factors present in a given bacterial cell. This tech nique is not yet without pitfalls (see below). The switch towards WGS is being fuelled by the need for more accurate and rapid infection prevention measures 96 . In fact, once an organism has been isolated by culture, bacterial identification and antibiotic resistance gene detection via bioinformatic analysis (for example, using the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) and 
            <rs type="software">ResFinder</rs>) are surprisingly easy to per form. In many cases, these pipelines have the poten tial to be fully automated 97 . Still, currently there is no convincing evidence that WGS outperforms multiplex PCR, despite the limitation on the number of genes that can be screened by PCR.

        <p>The most impactful and timely diagnostic innova tions developed recently have used 'omics' approaches 98 , and the current third generation or fourth generation protocols and methods may soon be available to the diag nostic community, with the first clinically validated and FDA approved genomic tests for cystic fibrosis already being used 99 . EUCAST has created a subcommittee on AST by WGS. The WGS strategy requires data bases that include sequences for all resistance genes and resistance associated mutations, as well as sequencing instruments that are currently being sold for less than US$20,000. When a complete bacterial genome is subsequently analysed for overlap with the entries in such databases, an isolatespecific 'resistome' can be mapped 100 . Clinical microbiologists should not use these software packages without understanding how gene sequence matching occurs. There is a danger in relying on default values and presuming that all antibiotic resistance genes within a sample will be found using these. A review of the soft ware packages and databases that are available can be found in Box 2. Some studies have reported an approach that is partly species independent, is compatible with MIC determination 101 and details resistance traits against families of antimicrobials 102 . In addition to genome based resistome analyses, RNA mediated transcrip tomic approaches have been described 103,104 .

        <p>Note that the use of different bioinformatic pipelines in combination with different databases may result in different outcomes 107 . The biggest barriers to routine application of species independent approaches are the need for cheaper sequencing platforms and the urgent need for user friendly 'sample in, data out' bio informatic solutions.

This technique is rela tively easy to use, and the bioinformatic interface has progressed substantially 108 . The sequences gener ated by this technology are long, enable easier assembly of complete genomes and can identify plasmids and large scale genomic re arrangements. However, the accuracy of ONT sequencing is still lagging behind that of other sequencing technologies. New mathematical methods (for example, machine learning) may cor rect these deficiencies. It has already been shown that WGS substantially enhances the quality of genotype tophenotype transitions 109,110 . This will require conti nuous phenotypic and genotypic screening for new resistance mechanisms and markers, database matura tion and the development of smart software and visual ization tools.

        <p>The major issues restricting the successful implemen tation of new AST methods are the need for substantial biomass, prolonged time to result, competition in the market and complexities of the developmental process.

        <p>In addition, time and cost pose further challenges to the development and implementation of a new AST method. Fortunately, a pipeline is emerging for the new methods that have been described [118][119][120] . Typically, the innovation process involves a novel scientific dis covery (that is, defining the methodology that will be used to distinguish living from dead bacterial cells) and a veri fication period to improve the technolog ical aspects of the assay, usually by limiting trials to few bacterial species and one or two key antimicrobial Box 2 | The importance of genomic databases well-known resistance factor databases include resistoMap (also suited to microbiome research 129 ), the Canadian antibiotic resistance Database (CarD) 130 , antibiotic resistance Gene annotation (arG-aNNOt) 131 ,

Finally, clinical validation studies have been performed for large collections of bacterial strains that belong to clinically relevant species. these species include, among many others, M. tuberculosis 18,140,141 , Staphylococcus aureus 142 , Klebsiella pneumoniae 143,144 , Neisseria gonorrhoeae 35,145 , Escherichia coli 146 , Shigella sonnei 147 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [148][149][150] .

Faecal resistome analysis has helped quantify the dynamics of the microbiota before, during and after antibiotic treatment and has shown that the microbiota of young adults restores well after antibiotic use. the use of machine learning has already shown that in certain cases dynamic changes of the microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract in the presence of antibiotics can be predicted. thus, metagenomics can help in the development of personalized antibiotic treatment regimens 156 . Generating complete inventories of resistance genes in clinical specimens will be helpful in defining which antibiotics will have no effect. Longitudinal followup studies of patients can lead to the early detection of emerging resistance during treatment and thus to changes in treatment protocols. However, one remaining issue is the accurate association of a resistance gene with a particular species (phasing).Most data have been generated using faecal specimens, and studies on the recovery of the gastrointestinal microbiota after antibiotic treatment have been a productive area of research 155 .

Generating complete inventories of resistance genes in clinical specimens will be helpful in defining which antibiotics will have no effect. Longitudinal followup studies of patients can lead to the early detection of emerging resistance during treatment and thus to changes in treatment protocols. However, one remaining issue is the accurate association of a resistance gene with a particular species (phasing).</p>
        <p>Nature reviews | Microbiology R e v i e w s agents (usually of the bactericidal variety). If the proof of concept is successful, a scientific publication ensues, and potential patents are secured. At this point, one big barrier is finding a corporate partner capable of devel oping the test and that is willing to invest substantial resources for further improvements. The decision of whether to invest is usually based on due diligence assessment, business development discussions and the perceived competitiveness of the new AST method 15 . It is relatively easy to get to the proof ofprinciple stage, but a full blown validation of new AST technology for all possible combinations of bacterial species and anti biotics is daunting and beyond the financial capabilities of start up companies. Defining the microbial panel width and global robustness of a new test requires huge investments. Many new methods fail to mature, since getting validation projects financed without a guarantee of success is problematic 121 .Nature reviews | Microbiology R e v i e w s agents (usually of the bactericidal variety).

        <p>When discussing the performance of various AST technologies, it is mandatory that a non biased approach be developed. This is not an easy task, owing to the diversity of the reported protocols, of the antibiotics to be analysed and of the species of microorganisms to be evaluated. In this context, important criteria for comparing different methods include microbiologi cal and diagnostic value (that is, resistance mecha nism versus phenotypic testing), as well as TAT 15 . Current TATs range from 20 min, for rapid PCR based gene profiling, to days, for cell divisionbased assays and genome sequencing 122,123 , although the TAT for genome sequencing is likely to become shorter in the future. A second comparative approach evaluates the commercial landscape, to provide a sense of how new diagnostics will fit in the market and what com petition already exists in that space. This approach is limited, since it tends to magnify the shortcomings rather than the strengths of new technologies. These two approaches can be used in combination, which is probably more realistic for predicting success. There is a tendency to overestimate the capabilities of regulatory approved methods and to undervalue the use of new technologies.When discussing the performance of various AST technologies, it is mandatory that a non biased approach be developed.

        <p>AST is constantly evolving, with many alternative methods being ready for implementation either now or in the near future 120 . In this context, it is important to spend less time on small, incremental improvements to existing technology, but rather to strive for substantial advances so that new tests with superior performance characteristics can be approved and marketed as soon as possible. This will require the community of AST developers, manufacturers and end users to recognize and leave the limitations of traditional AST behind. For example, debate is still ongoing regarding the actual number of bacterial colonies that should be tested for phenotypic or genotypic resistance 124 . New AST techno logies may identify all of the resistance pheno types and/or genotypes present within a clinical sam ple, but without isolation and species identification, the significance of the identified resistance mecha nisms may not be obvious or important 125 . Perhaps it can be concluded that many options for AST could be 'mixed and matched' in a clinical laboratory, depend ing on the diversity of the patient population or work flow, but it seems impossible to recommend which could be the best combination or combinations. It is unlikely that a single method will completely replace the existing automated high throughput methods. It is more likely that new methods will be supplemen tal, for the time being. For instance, most new AST formats test positive blood cultures -which means that a method should be capable of identifying species or be closely coupled to classic or MALDI TOFMS mediated identification. Obviously, the need to identify a clinical isolate at the species level slows the diagnos tic process. Additionally, EUCAST, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and the FDA should be integral parts of the development process and should recommend clinical MIC breakpoints to be used in diagnostic laboratories 126 . New technologies will also require optimizations of both pre analytics (clinical sample and strain handling) and post analytic follow up at the clinical level. Finally, patient health management and cost are of pivotal importance. Costly tests or tests for which the clinical and financial return on investment has not been made clear will fail to be implemented 127 . Bringing the issues surrounding AMR and AST to broader public attention is a must. This will require promoting a better understanding of antimi crobial usage (steward ship) and clear explanations to the general public about drug selection and the devel opment of multidrug resistance from overuse of anti microbial agents 128AST is constantly evolving, with many alternative methods being ready for implementation either now or in the near future 120 .
