        <p>Industrialization increases use of dyes due to its high demand in paper, cosmetic, textile, leather and food industries. This in turn would increase wastewater generation from dye industrial activities. Various dyes and its structural compounds present in dye industrial wastewater have harmful effects on plants, animals and humans. Synthetic dyes are more resistant than natural dyes to physical and chemical methods for remediation which makes them more difficult to get decolorize. Microbial degradation has been researched and reviewed largely for quicker dye degradation. Genetically engineered microorganisms (GEMs) play important role in achieving complete dye degradation. This paper provides scientific and technical information about dyes &amp; dye intermediates and biodegradation of azo dye. It also compiles information about factors affecting dye(s) biodegradation, role of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in process of dye(s) degradation and perspectives in this field of research.Industrialization increases use of dyes due to its high demand in paper, cosmetic, textile, leather and food industries.

        <p>Dyes are an important source in various industries such as textile, leather, paint, food, cosmetic and paper industries. There are approximately twenty-five types of dye groups available based on their chemical structure of chromophore (Sudha et al., 2014;Benkhaya et al., 2020). More than thousand dyes have been classified as textile dyes which are used to color variety of fabrics (Sponza, 2006;Abe et al., 2019). Dye intermediates are precursors of dyes. They can be obtained from raw constituents, such as naphthalene and benzene, with an aid of various chemical reactions (Gregory, 2009;Guo et al., 2018).Dyes are an important source in various industries such as textile, leather, paint, food, cosmetic and paper industries.

        <p>Disposal of municipal-and other industrial-effluents into water bodies cause water pollution (Kunz et al., 2002;Varjani and Upasani, 2017b). Environment is adversely affected by pollution which may cause indirect or direct health risks to all life forms on the earth (Varjani, 2017;Bencheqroun et al., 2019). Dyes can be classified on the base of their structure and application. Dyes have a great solubilizing capability in water, which makes it difficult to be removed by traditional methods (Dong et al., 2019;Lellis et al., 2019). Textile dye contains colors, which causes artistic damage as well as stops diffusion of light in the water which leads to decrease in dissolved oxygen level and affects photosynthesis rate of aquatic life (Ajaz et al., 2020).Disposal of municipal-and other industrial-effluents into water bodies cause water pollution (Kunz et al., 2002;Varjani and Upasani, 2017b).

        <p>Various methods can be used to remove dyes and other pollutants from industrial effluent such as physico-chemical, biological, chemical and physical (Xu et al., 2007;Cao et al., 2019;Varjani and Upasani, 2019b). Biological treatment has various advantages such as, it is a simple, cheap, environmental friendly process. Also large number of microorganisms are available which are easy to maintain and also require low preparation (Crini et al., 2019). Apart from these dye degradation techniques periphyton biofilm or periphytic biofilm system can be also used for degradation of dyes (Li and Treatment of dye wastewater can be performed using pure culture or mixed microbial culture. Majorly mixed microbial culture has been reported to achieve efficient dye degradation due to synergistic metabolic actions (Kalyani et al., 2009;Mandal et al., 2010).Various methods can be used to remove dyes and other pollutants from industrial effluent such as physico-chemical, biological, chemical and physical (Xu et al., 2007;Cao et al., 2019;Varjani and Upasani, 2019b).

Maximum azo dyes are synthesized by diazotization of an aromatic primary amine and followed by coupling with one or more electron rich nucleophiles (hydroxy and amino). Several other methods are also available for synthesis of azo dyes such as oxidation of primary amines by lead tetra-acetate or permanganate potassium, reduction of nitroso compounds by AlLiH4, condonation of quinone and hydrazine, etc. (Benkhaya et al., 2020). These dyes are recorded for industrial applications and only azo dye contains 60% ratio as compared to all other types of dyes (Shah, 2014;Iark et al., 2019). Azo dyes make up group of food and drug administration (FDA) certified colorants which make them safe for use in foods, cosmetics and drugs (Chung, 2016).

        <p>Anthraquinone dyes -Second most widely used dyes after azo dyes are anthraquinone dyes due to their good dyeing performance, easy accessibility and low price but it is highly toxic to humans and microorganisms than azo dyes. Anthraquinone dyes contain anthraquinone chromophore groups which includes benzene ring with two carbonyl group on both sides. They contain both stable as well as complex structure. Color of the dye may be influenced by different effects of substituents such as electron accepting and electron donating substituents. Common natural red colorants comprise presence of anthraquinones which are highly used in textile industries (Shahid et al., 2019).Anthraquinone dyes -Second most widely used dyes after azo dyes are anthraquinone dyes due to their good dyeing performance, easy accessibility and low price but it is highly toxic to humans and microorganisms than azo dyes.

        <p>Anthraquinone dye has been reported as the oldest dyes because they have been found thousands years back and were used in wrapping mummies (Gurses et al., 2016). Naturally occurring anthraquinone establish the major group of natural quinoids. Several scale insects and plant roots are responsible for production of natural anthraquinones. Plants such as chai root, madder and Indian mulberry (from Rubiaceae family) and scale insects like lac, kermes and cochineal produce beautiful color palettes of red hues on different types of fibre. Color of palette is dependent on the metallic salt used for the mordant with limited color range of purple, brown and orange. Anthraquenone dyes have been divided into four categories: i) Heterocyclic Anthraquinone dyes, ii) Heterocyclic anthrone dyes, iii) Anthraquinone derivations, vi) Fused ring anthrone dyes (Li et al., 2019)Anthraquinone dye has been reported as the oldest dyes because they have been found thousands years back and were used in wrapping mummies (Gurses et al., 2016).

        <p>industrial activity negatively affects human health and environmental condition through large amount of waste discharged into open water sources (Chung, 2016; Bencheqroun et al., 2019). Use of azo dye shows undesirable effect in soil microbial populations and affects plant growth and germination (Lellis et al., 2019). De Jong et al. (2016), have used Hydra attenuata as a model to study ecotoxicological impact of mix pollutants in marine environment. They have reported that presence of Disperse Red 1 into fresh water affects biological functions, morphology, neurotransmitter distribution and feeding behavior of Hydra attenuata. Hydra attenuata contain antioxidant defense mechanism but at high concentration of dye morphological healthy appearance of this organism was affected, as result asexual reproduction was reduced and feeding behavior was also inhibited (De Jong et al., 2016).

Physico-chemical treatment is the process in which physical changes are constantly present, while chemical changes in the process at different phases may or may not take place (Karimifard and Alavi Moghaddam, 2018). In this process chemicals such as Lime, Ferric chloride (FeCl3), Ferrous sulphate (FeSO4.7H2O) and Alum ((Al2SO4)3.18H2O) are widely used to alter physical state of dye molecules (Ayed et al., 2020).

Reports have demonstrated importance of enzyme in degradation of dyes such as, azoreductase, laccase, peroxidase and exo-enzymes. E. gallinarum and Streptomyces S27 has been reported for degradation of azo dyes with use of azoreductase enzyme (Bafana et al., 2009; Dong et al., 2019). Laccase have great degradation potential for many aromatic compounds (Bhatia et al., 2017). Shanmugam et al.

This is due to existence of pollutant(s) like 4-amino biphenyl and 2-4, diaminoazo-benzene, which have been reported as carcinogens (Dewan et al., 1988; Ali, 2010; Bencheqroun et al., 2019). aminobenzoicacid, Ethylenedibromide, Pyrene, P-nitrophenol, etc. are commonly used in dye manufacturing and highly present in dye industry wastewater and affects growth of bacteria during wastewater treatment (Awad et al., 2019). The factors affecting dye degradation are mainly divided into two categories. i) Environmental factors, ii) Nutritional factors. 2017b). Faster rate in degradation of dye can be achieved by giving bacterial culture an optimum temperature which is generally reported as 30-40 o C for most bacteria. Das and Mishra (2017), have used bacterial consortium of Bacillus pumilus HKG212 and Zobellella taiwanensis AT 1-3 for degradation of reactive green 19 and reported highest degradation at 32.04 o C. However, few thermophilic bacteria are reported for degradation of azo dye at high temperature. Gursahani and Gupta (2011), reported 75% degradation of effluent at 60 o C by using Anoxybacillus rupiensis. It has been reported that decolorization rate decreases as temperature increases (Imran et al., 2015). to use of high salt concentration in dying process which can be detected using conductivity meter. To increase ionic strength and development of dye fixation on fabrics salts like Na2SO4, NaCl and NaNO3 are usually added in the dye bath. Hence, with release of dye pollutants, salts are also released in industrial wastewater. Dyes containing high salt concentration may decrease biodegradation rate by reducing biological movement (Basutkar and Shivannavar, 2019). 6.2.2. Carbon and nitrogen supplements -Microorganisms require nutrient supplements for quick degradation of pollutants (Varjani and Upasani, 2019a).. This is due to existence of pollutant(s) like 4-amino biphenyl and 2-4, diaminoazo-benzene, which have been reported as carcinogens (Dewan et al., 1988; Ali, 2010; Bencheqroun et al., 2019). aminobenzoicacid, Ethylenedibromide, Pyrene, P-nitrophenol, etc. are commonly used in dye manufacturing and highly present in dye industry wastewater and affects growth of bacteria during wastewater treatment (Awad et al., 2019). The factors affecting dye degradation are mainly divided into two categories. i) Environmental factors, ii) Nutritional factors. 2017b). Faster rate in degradation of dye can be achieved by giving bacterial culture an optimum temperature which is generally reported as 30-40 o C for most bacteria. Das and Mishra (2017), have used bacterial consortium of Bacillus pumilus HKG212 and Zobellella taiwanensis AT 1-3 for degradation of reactive green 19 and reported highest degradation at 32.04 o C. However, few thermophilic bacteria are reported for degradation of azo dye at high temperature. Gursahani and Gupta (2011), reported 75% degradation of effluent at 60 o C by using Anoxybacillus rupiensis. It has been reported that decolorization rate decreases as temperature increases (Imran et al., 2015). to use of high salt concentration in dying process which can be detected using conductivity meter.
