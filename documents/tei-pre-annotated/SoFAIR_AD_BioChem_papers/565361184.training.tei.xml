We quantify the gain in studying non-European ancestries and provide evidence to support expanding recruitment into new ancestries even with relatively smaller sample sizes. We find that increasing diversity rather than studying additional European ancestry individuals results in substantial improvements in fine-mapping functional variants and portability of polygenic prediction (evaluated in N~295,000 from 6 ancestries), with modest gains in the number of discovered loci and ancestry-specific variants.

        <p>The Global Lipids Genetics Consortium aggregated GWAS results from 1,654,960 individuals from 201 primary studies representing five genetic ancestry groups: Admixed African or African (AdmAFR, N=99.4k, 6.0% of sample), East Asian (EAS, N=146.5k, 8.9%), European (EUR, N=1.32m, 79.8%), Hispanic (HIS, N=48.1k, 2.9%), and South Asian (SAS, N=41.0k, 2.5%) (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Figure 1). We performed GWAS for five blood lipid traits: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (nonHDL-C). Of the 91 million variants imputed from the Haplotype Reference Consortium or 1000 Genomes Phase 3 that successfully passed variant-level QC, 52 million variants were present in at least two cohorts and had sufficient minor allele counts (&gt; 30 in the meta-analysis) to be evaluated as a potential index variant.The Global Lipids Genetics Consortium aggregated GWAS results from 1,654,960 individuals from 201 primary studies representing five genetic ancestry groups: Admixed African or African (AdmAFR, N=99.4k, 6.0% of sample), East Asian (EAS, N=146.5k, 8.9%), European (EUR, N=1.32m, 79.8%), Hispanic (HIS, N=48.1k, 2.9%), and South Asian (SAS, N=41.0k, 2.5%) (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Figure 1).

        <p>We first quantified the number of genome-wide significant loci identified in at least one of the five ancestry-specific meta-analyses. We found 773 lipid-associated genomic regions containing 1,765 distinct index variants that reached genome-wide significance (p-value &lt; 5x10 -8 , ±500 kb, Supplementary Tables 23, Supplementary Figures 23) for at least one ancestry group and lipid trait. Of these regions, 237 were novel based on the most-significant index variant in each region being &gt;500 kb from variants previously reported as associated with any of the five lipid traits [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23]27 . Of these loci, 76% were identified only in the European ancestry-specific analyses (N~1.3m, 80% of sample). Of the non-European ancestries, the African ancestry GWAS (N~99k, primarily African American) identified more ancestry-specific loci (15 unique to AdmAFR) than any other non-European ancestry group (six loci unique to EAS, six to HIS, one to SAS). The difference is likely attributable to allele frequencies being most different between African and European ancestry populations (Figure 1a-d) and to African populations having greater genetic diversity 28 .We first quantified the number of genome-wide significant loci identified in at least one of the five ancestry-specific meta-analyses.

        <p>We next performed trans-ancestry meta-analyses using the meta-regression approach implemented in MR-MEGA 30 to account for heterogeneity in variant effect sizes on lipids between ancestry groups. A total of 1,750 index variants at 923 loci (±500 kb regions) reached genome-wide significance for at least one lipid trait. These included 168 regions not identified by ancestry-specific analysis, 120 (71%) of which were novel (Supplementary Tables 45, Supplementary Figure 4, Extended Data Figure 1). Almost all (98%) index variants from the ancestry-specific analysis remained significant (p-value&lt;5x10 -8 ) after meta-analysis across all ancestry groups, although fifteen AdmAFR, nine EAS, three HIS, and one SAS index variants from ancestry-specific analysis did not (trans-ancestry p-value 7.7x10 -6 to 5.9x10 -8 , Supplementary Figure 5, Supplementary Note). In total, we identified 941 lipid-associated loci including 355 novel loci from either single-or trans-ancestry analyses.We next performed trans-ancestry meta-analyses using the meta-regression approach implemented in MR-MEGA 30 to account for heterogeneity in variant effect sizes on lipids between ancestry groups.

        <p>Next, we compared the number of loci identified per 100,000 participants in each ancestry group and the combined dataset (Figure 1e). African and Hispanic ancestry-specific analyses identified the most loci per genotyped individual, perhaps due to African ancestry and/or increased genetic diversity. European and trans-ancestry analyses identified slightly fewer loci per 100,000 individuals, likely reflecting a slight reduction in the benefit from new samples added to very large sample sizes (&gt;1m). For the genome-wide significant variants discovered in each ancestry, we estimated the proportion of ancestry-enriched variants by enumerating the number of other ancestries with sufficient power to detect association (range 0 to 4). We estimated the power for discovery of each variant by assuming an equivalent discovery sample size in the other ancestries, fixed effect size, and observed allele frequencies from the other ancestries (Figure 1f). To allow for comparison at similar sample sizes across ancestry groups, we selected European ancestry index variants identified from a meta-analysis of ~100,000 individuals subsampled from the present study. African ancestry index-variants were most ancestry-enriched, with only 61% of index variants demonstrating sufficient power in at least one other ancestry group (equal N, power&gt;80% to reach alpha=5x10 -8 ), likely due to population-enriched allele frequencies. In comparison, 88% of South Asian index variants had estimated power &gt;80% in at least one other ancestry.Next, we compared the number of loci identified per 100,000 participants in each ancestry group and the combined dataset (Figure 1e).

        <p>Finally, we found that both the number of identified variants and the mean observed chi-squared values from genome-wide lipid association tests were approximately linearly related to meta-analysis sample size across ancestries (Supplementary Table 6, Extended Data Figure 2). However, in the European ancestry group the incremental increase in either the number of loci or chi-squared value was slightly attenuated at the largest sample sizes. Taken together, these results suggest that once sufficiently well-powered GWAS sample sizes are reached within a given ancestry group, assembling large sample sizes of other under-represented groups will modestly enhance variant discovery relative to increasing the sample size of the dominant ancestry.Finally, we found that both the number of identified variants and the mean observed chi-squared values from genome-wide lipid association tests were approximately linearly related to meta-analysis sample size across ancestries (Supplementary Table 6, Extended Data Figure 2).

        <p>Differences in association signals across ancestries despite similar sample sizes could be due to variation in allele frequencies and/or effect sizes. This could reflect differing patterns of LD with the underlying causal variant or an interaction with an environmental risk factor whose prevalence varies by ancestry and/or geography. We found that effect size estimates of individual variants were largely similar based on pairwise comparison between ancestries (r 2 =0.93 for variants with p-value&lt;5x10 -8 ) (Extended Data Figure 3, Supplementary Table 7, Supplementary Figure 6). We additionally tested for genomelevel differences in effect size correlation between East Asian, European, and South Asian ancestry groups using Popcorn 29 , which were not significantly different from 1 (p-value&gt;0.05, Supplementary Figures 7 and8). We tested for differences in genetic correlation between Admixed African and European ancestries in the UK Biobank and Million Veteran Program (MVP) using bivariate GREML 30,31 as the Popcorn method does not account for long-range LD in admixed populations. Genetic correlation between Admixed African and European ancestries for HDL-C (r=0.84) was not significantly different from 1 in the UK Biobank (possibly due to relatively small numbers of African ancestry individuals), while correlations for the other traits ranged from 0.52-0.60 in UK Biobank and 0.47-0.69 in MVP (Supplementary Table 8). These results indicate moderately high correlation in lipid effect sizes across ancestry groups when considering all genome-wide variants.Differences in association signals across ancestries despite similar sample sizes could be due to variation in allele frequencies and/or effect sizes.

        <p>Of the 2,286 variants that reached genome-wide significance in the trans-ancestry metaanalysis across all five lipid traits, 159 (7%) showed significant heterogeneity of effect size due to ancestry (p-value&lt;2.2x10 -5 ; Bonferroni correction for 2,286 variants, Supplementary Table 5). Of these 159, 31 showed the largest effect in African ancestry analyses, 24 in East Asian, 67 in European, 20 in Hispanic, and 17 in South Asian. Only 49 (2%) of these variants from trans-ancestry meta-analysis showed significant residual heterogeneity not due to ancestry, which may be attributable to differences in ascertainment or analysis strategy between cohorts (Supplementary Table 5), suggesting cohort-related factors are a less important driver of heterogeneity than genetic ancestry.Of the 2,286 variants that reached genome-wide significance in the trans-ancestry metaanalysis across all five lipid traits, 159 (7%) showed significant heterogeneity of effect size due to ancestry (p-value&lt;2.2x10 -5 ; Bonferroni correction for 2,286 variants, Supplementary Table 5).

        <p>We next assessed whether trans-ancestry fine-mapping narrowed the set of likely causal variants at each of the independent trans-ancestry association signals (LD r 2 &lt;0.7), assuming one shared causal variant per ±500 kb region (Supplementary Table 9). 19% of the association signals had only one variant in the 99% credible set and 55% (816/1,486) had ≤10. In contrast, 5% (73/1486) had &gt;100. Of the 407 variants with &gt;90% posterior probability of being the causal variant at a locus in the trans-ancestry meta-analysis, 56 (14%) were missense variants, 7 (2%) were splice-region variants, and 4 (1%) were stopgain variants (CD36, HBB, ANGPTL8, PDE3B). (Supplementary Tables 101112).We next assessed whether trans-ancestry fine-mapping narrowed the set of likely causal variants at each of the independent trans-ancestry association signals (LD r 2 &lt;0.7), assuming one shared causal variant per ±500 kb region (Supplementary Table 9). 19% of the association signals had only one variant in the 99% credible set and 55% (816/1,486) had ≤10.

(Supplementary Tables 101112).</p>
        <p>The median number of variants in 99% credible sets from European ancestry analysis was 13; this was reduced to 8 in the trans-ancestry analysis. Of 1,486 association signals, 825 (56%) had reduced credible set size in the trans-ancestry analysis. At these 825 loci, the number of variants in the trans-ancestry credible sets were reduced by 40% relative to the minimum credible set size in either Admixed African (the most genetically diverse group) or European ancestry analyses (Extended Data Figure 4). We estimate that increasing the sample size of European ancestry samples to that of the trans-ancestry analysis would yield a 20% reduction in credible set size, approximately half of the 40% reduction observed in trans-ancestry analysis. This suggests that sample size differences alone do not explain the reduction, rather differences in LD patterns and effect sizes across ancestries likely contribute to the improved fine-mapping (Supplementary Note). For example, rs900776, an intronic variant in the DMTN region with many high LD variants in the European ancestry group, has a posterior probability of being causal of 0.86 in the African ancestry derived credible sets, &gt;0.99 in the trans-ancestry analysis, but only 0.51 in the European ancestry-specific analysis (Figure 2).The median number of variants in 99% credible sets from European ancestry analysis was 13; this was reduced to 8 in the trans-ancestry analysis.

        <p>We evaluated the potential of polygenic risk scores (PRS, sometimes also called polygenic scores or PGS) to predict elevated LDL-C, a major causal risk factor of CAD, in diverse ancestry groups. We created three non-overlapping datasets to separately: i) perform ancestry-specific or trans-ancestry GWAS to estimate variant effect sizes, ii) optimize risk score parameters, and iii) evaluate the utility of the resulting scores. For each ancestryspecific or trans-ancestry GWAS we created multiple polygenic score weights --either genome-wide with PRS-CS 32 or using pruning and thresholding to select independent variants. We tested each score in the optimizing dataset, which was matched for ancestry to the GWAS (AdmAFR, EAS, EUR, SAS, ALL from UK biobank or HIS from Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI), Extended Data Figures 5 and6, Supplementary Tables 131415). The top-performing score from each GWAS was selected: PRS-CS for East Asian ancestry, European ancestry, and European ancestry 2010 scores from a previous GLGC GWAS 4 , and an optimized pruning and threshold-based score for all others. We then evaluated the polygenic scores in 8 cohorts of individuals (N=295,577, Supplementary Table 16), not included in the discovery GWAS, from 6 ancestral groups: East Asian (146,477), European American (85,571), African American (21,730), African (2,452 East Africa, 4,972 South Africa, 7,309 West Africa), South Asian (15,242), Hispanic American (7,669), and Asian American (4,155).We evaluated the potential of polygenic risk scores (PRS, sometimes also called polygenic scores or PGS) to predict elevated LDL-C, a major causal risk factor of CAD, in diverse ancestry groups.

        <p>The polygenic score developed from trans-ancestry meta-analysis consistently showed the best or near-best performance in each group tested, with improved or comparable prediction relative to ancestry-matched scores (adjusted R 2 ~ 0.10-0.16, Figure 3, Supplementary Table 17, Extended Data Figure 7). This observation was especially evident for ancestries with smaller GWAS sample sizes, as was the case for HIS and SAS. For African Americans in MGI and MVP, polygenic prediction was similar for individuals with different levels of recent African ancestry admixture (Extended Data Figure 8) and reached the level of prediction observed for European ancestry individuals from the same dataset. The increase in LDL-C per each standard deviation increase in the polygenic score was also similar between ancestry groups in MVP: 13.2±0.22 mg/dL for African American, 8.9±0.47 mg/dL for Asian (EAS/SAS), 10.5±0.10 mg/dL for European, and 10.6±0.32 mg/dL for Hispanic ancestry individuals. We repeated the evaluation of trans-ancestry vs single-ancestry polygenic scores with a set GWAS with sample size of ~100k individuals and with fixed methodology; results were consistent with those from the full dataset (Figure 3b, Supplementary Figure 9). Thus, polygenic prediction for LDL-C in all ancestries appears to benefit the most from adding samples of diverse ancestries once relatively large numbers of European ancestry individuals have already been included. Additional studies are needed to determine if this applies to other phenotypes with different genetic architectures and heritabilities.The polygenic score developed from trans-ancestry meta-analysis consistently showed the best or near-best performance in each group tested, with improved or comparable prediction relative to ancestry-matched scores (adjusted R 2 ~ 0.10-0.16, Figure 3, Supplementary Table 17, Extended Data Figure 7).

        <p>Genome-wide discovery for blood lipid traits based on ~1.65 million individuals from five ancestry groups confirmed that the contributions of common genetic variation to blood lipids are largely similar across diverse populations. First, we found that the number of significant loci relative to sample size was similar within each ancestry group, and approximately linearly related to sample size, with a small increase in ancestry-specific variants observed in African ancestry cohorts relative to the others. Second, we demonstrated that inclusion of additional ancestries through trans-ancestry fine-mapping reduces the set of candidate causal variants in credible sets and does so more rapidly than in single-ancestry analysis. Trans-ancestry GWAS should therefore facilitate identification of effector genes at GWAS loci and allow for accelerated biological insight and identification of potential drug targets. Third, we found that a polygenic score derived from ~88k African ancestry and ~830k European ancestry individuals was correlated with observed lipid levels among individuals with admixed African ancestry as well as among individuals with European ancestry. We hypothesize that the inclusion of African ancestry individuals in the GWAS yields improvement in polygenic prediction performance through the general fine-mapping of loci and the improved prioritization of trans-ancestry causal variants. Fourth, and perhaps most important, the trans-ancestry score was generally most informative across all major population groups examined. This provides useful information for other genetic discovery efforts and investigations of the utility of the polygenic scores in diverse populations.Genome-wide discovery for blood lipid traits based on ~1.65 million individuals from five ancestry groups confirmed that the contributions of common genetic variation to blood lipids are largely similar across diverse populations.

        <p>Generalizability of these findings regarding portability of polygenic scores from the transancestry meta-analysis to other traits may depend on the heritability, degree of polygenicity, level of genetic correlation, allele frequencies of causal variants across ancestry groups, gene-environment interactions, and representation of diverse populations in the GWAS 33,34 . While many traits show a high degree of shared genetic correlation across ancestries 31,35,36 others have distinct genetic variants with large effects that are more common in specific ancestry groups 33 which may limit the utility of trans-ancestry polygenic scores for particular phenotypes in some ancestries.Generalizability of these findings regarding portability of polygenic scores from the transancestry meta-analysis to other traits may depend on the heritability, degree of polygenicity, level of genetic correlation, allele frequencies of causal variants across ancestry groups, gene-environment interactions, and representation of diverse populations in the GWAS 33,34 .

        <p>The benefits from genetic discovery efforts as GWAS sample sizes increase will likely not be measured just by the number of loci discovered. Rather, the focus will increasingly turn to improving our understanding of the biology at established loci, identifying potential therapeutic targets, and efficiently identifying individuals at high-risk of adverse health outcomes across population groups without exacerbating existing health disparities. Considering the results presented here, and those of related studies [37][38][39] , we believe future genetic studies will benefit substantially from meta-analysis across participants of diverse ancestries. Further gains in the depth and number of sequenced individuals of diverse ancestries 40,41 may additionally improve discovery of novel variants and loci in diverse cohorts, particularly variants absent from arrays and imputation reference panels. Our results suggest that diversifying the populations under study, rather than simply increasing the sample size, is now the single most efficient approach to achieving these goals, at least for blood lipids and likely for tightly related downstream adverse health outcomes such as cardiovascular disease. However, if costs for recruitment of diverse populations are higher than recruitment of individuals from previously studied ancestry groups, and total number of genome-wide significant index variants is the goal, then continued low-cost recruitment of majority ancestry groups is expected to still provide some benefit. Taken together, our results also strongly support ongoing and future large-scale recruitment efforts targeted at the enrollment and DNA collection of non-European ancestry participants. Geneticists and those responsible for cohort development must continue diversifying genetic discovery datasets, while increasing sample size in a cost-effective manner, to ensure genetic studies reduce rather than exacerbate existing health inequities across race, ancestry, geographic region, and nationality.The benefits from genetic discovery efforts as GWAS sample sizes increase will likely not be measured just by the number of loci discovered.

        <p>Each cohort contributed GWAS summary statistics for HDL-C, LDL-C, nonHDL-C, TC and TG, imputation quality statistics, and analysis metrics for quality control (QC), following a detailed analysis plan (Supplementary File 1). Briefly, we requested that each cohort perform imputation to 1000 Genomes Phase 3 (1KGP3), with European ancestry cohorts additionally imputing with the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) panel using the 
            <rs type="software">Michigan Imputation Server</rs> (
            <rs type="url">https://imputationserver.sph.umich.edu/index.html#!)</rs> which uses 
            <rs type="software">Minimac</rs> software 42 . Detailed pre-imputation QC guidelines were provided; these included removing samples with call rate &lt; 95%, samples with heterozygosity &gt; median + 3(interquartile range), ancestry outliers from principal component analysis within each ancestry group, and variants deviating from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p-value &lt; 10 -6 ) or with variant call rate &lt; 98%. Analyses were carried out separately by ancestry group and were additionally stratified by cases and controls where appropriate (i.e. for a diseasefocused cohort such as CAD). Residuals were generated separately in males and females adjusting for age, age 2 , principal components of ancestry, and any necessary study-specific covariates. Triglyceride levels were natural-log transformed before generating residuals. Inverse normalization was then done on the residual values. Individuals on cholesterol lowering medication had their pre-medication levels 43 approximated by dividing the LDL-C value by 0.7 and the TC value by 0.8. Association analysis of the residuals for the majority of cohorts was carried out using a linear mixed-model approach in rvtests or with other similar software including 
            <rs type="software">BOLT-LMM</rs> 44 , 
            <rs type="software">SAIGE</rs> 45 , or 
            <rs type="software">deCode association software</rs>.
        </p>
        <p>Each input file was assessed for quality control using the 
            <rs type="software">EasyQC</rs> software 46 (
            <rs type="url">www.genepiregensburg.de/easyqc</rs>). We generated QQ plots by minor allele frequency (MAF) bins, assessed trends in standard errors relative to sample size for each cohort, and checked MAF of submitted variants relative to their expected value based on the imputation reference panel. In addition, we checked that each cohort reproduced the expected direction of effect at most known loci relative to the cohort sample size. Cohorts identified to have issues with the submitted files were contacted and corrected files were submitted or the cohort was excluded from meta-analysis. Results from either sex-stratified analysis or sex-combined analysis with sex as a covariate were used. During the QC process, within each cohort we removed poorly imputed variants (info score or r 2 &lt; 0.3), variants deviating from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE p-value &lt; 10 -8 , except for MVP which used HWE p-value &lt; 10 -20 ), and variants with minor allele count &lt; 3. An imputation info score threshold of 0.3 was selected to balance the inclusion of variants across diverse studies while removing poorly imputed variants. Summary statistics were then genomic-control (GC) corrected using the λ GC value calculated from the median p-value of variants with MAF &gt; 0.5%. To capture as many variants as possible, summary statistics from cohorts that had submitted both HRC and 1KGP3 imputed files were joined, selecting variants imputed from HRC where both imputed versions of a variant existed. For variants imputed by both panels, we observed that variants imputed from the HRC panel resulted in a higher imputation info score for 94% of variants when compared to the imputation info score from 1KGP3.
        </p>
        <p>Ancestry-specific meta-analysis was performed using 
            <rs type="software">RAREMETAL</rs> 47 (
            <rs type="url">https://github.com/ SailajaVeda/raremetal</rs>). Trans-ancestry meta-analysis was performed using MR-MEGA 48 with 5 principal components of ancestry. The choice of 5 principal components was made after comparing the λ GC values across minor allele frequency bins from meta-analysis of HDL-C with MR-MEGA using from 2 up to 10 principal components. In addition, fixedeffects meta-analysis was carried out with 
            <rs type="software">METAL</rs> 49 to calculate effect sizes for use in the creation of polygenic scores. Study-level principal components were plotted for each cohort by ancestry group to verify that the reported ancestry for each cohort was as expected. Following meta-analysis, we identified loci based on a genome-wide significance threshold of 5x10 -8 after GC correction using the λ GC value calculated from the median p-value of variants with MAF &gt; 0.5%. The choice of double-GC correction was made to be most conservative and to minimize potential false-positive findings. Observed λ GC values were within the expected range for similarly sized studies and are included in Supplementary Tables 2 and4. Variants with a cumulative minor allele count ≤ 30 and those found in a single study were excluded from index variant selection. Index variants were identified following an iterative procedure starting with the most significant variant and grouping the surrounding region into a locus based on the larger of either ± 500 kb or ± 0.25 cM. cM positions were interpolated using the genetic map distributed with Eagle v2.3.2 (genetic_map_hg19_withX.txt) 50 . Variants were annotated using WGSA 51 including the summary of each variant from 
            <rs type="software">SnpEff</rs> 52 and the closest genes for intergenic variants from 
            <rs type="software">ANNOVAR</rs> 53 . Annotation of variants as known or novel was done based on manual review of previously published variants and with variants reported in the GWAS catalog 27 for any of the studied lipid traits (accessed May 2020, provided as Supplementary Table 18). For comparison between ancestries and lipid traits, index variants were grouped into genomic regions starting with the most significantly associated variant and grouping all surrounding index variants within ± 500 kb into a single region.
        </p>
        <p>Power to detect association within each ancestry was determined using the effect size and sample size of the variant within the original discovery ancestry group and the observed allele frequency from the other ancestry groups with alpha set to 5x10 -8 . We excluded variants that were only successfully imputed in a single ancestry group to account for imputation panel differences between groups (ie. Haplotype Reference Consortium for European ancestry individuals and 1000 Genomes for other ancestries). Variants that were successfully imputed in 2 or more ancestries were assumed to have zero power in any other ancestry where the variant was not successfully imputed. The proportion of variance explained by each variant was estimated as 2β 2 (1-f)f where β is the effect size from METAL and f is the effect allele frequency (Supplementary Table 19). The proportion of variance explained within each ancestry was estimated using the trans-ancestry effect size from METAL with the ancestry-specific allele frequency. Coverage of the genome by associated genetic regions was calculated using 
            <rs type="software">BEDTools</rs> 54 for the regions defined by the minimum and maximum position within each locus having p-value &lt; 5x10 -8 .
        </p>
        <p>Approximate conditional analysis was performed using rareGWAMA 55 to identify index variants that were shadows of nearby, more significant associations. LD reference populations were taken from UK Biobank specific to Admixed African, European (subset of 40,000), or South Asian ancestry individuals or from the 1000 Genomes project (1KGP3) for East Asian or Hispanic ancestry individuals. Conditional analysis was carried out using the individual cohort level summary statistics as was done for meta-analysis with 
            <rs type="software">RAREMETAL</rs>. 
            <rs type="software">rareGWAMA</rs> requires imputation quality scores which were set to 1 for all variants that had previously passed quality control (pre-filtered at imputation info/r 2 &gt; 0.3). The European ancestry subset of UK Biobank was used as the reference population for the conditional analysis of the trans-ancestry meta-analysis (~80% European ancestry).
        </p>
        <p>Stepwise conditional analysis was performed sequentially for the index variants within each chromosome ranked by most to least significant. Index variants were then flagged as not independent from other more significant variants if the absolute value of the ratio of the original effect size to the effect size after conditional analysis was greater than the 95 th percentile of all values (Supplementary Figure 10). This threshold was selected to remove variants whose effects were driven by nearby, more strongly associated variants in LD. This corresponded to a ratio of original to conditional effect size of 1.6 for ancestry-specific conditional analysis and a ratio of 1.7 for the trans-ancestry conditional analysis. The effect sizes from meta-analysis with 
            <rs type="software">METAL</rs> were used for comparison with the trans-ancestry conditional analysis results. Variants flagged as non-independent were excluded from the summary results in the manuscript and are flagged as non-independent in Supplementary Tables 3 and5.

        <p>Popcorn 29 was used to assess the degree of correlation in effect sizes between ancestry groups for each of the lipid traits with 1000 Genomes phase 3 as the reference LD panel. Only variants with MAF &gt; 0.01 in each ancestry individually were included in the comparison. Both the genetic effect and genetic impact models were tested. Bivariate GREML from GCTA was used to calculate the genetic correlation between unrelated Admixed Africans and a subset of white British individuals in the UK Biobank following the method of Guo et al 30,31 . HapMap3 variants with MAF &gt; 0.01 in each ancestry were used to construct the genetic relationship matrix (GRM) with the allele frequencies standardized in each population. Individuals with genetic relatedness &gt; 0.05 were removed. A total of up to 5,575 AdmAfr and 38,668 white British individuals from UK Biobank were included in the analysis of each trait after removal of related individuals. The measured lipid traits were corrected for medication use and were inverse-normalized after correction for age, sex, and batch. Principal components 1-20 constructed from the GRM were included as covariates in the calculation of genetic correlation. Analysis within the Million Veteran Program included 24,502 European ancestry and 21,950 African American unrelated individuals. Maximum measured values were used for LDL-C, TC, and triglycerides and minimum values for HDL-C.

        <p>Credible sets for the trans-ancestry meta-analysis were generated using the Bayes factors as output by MR-MEGA. The credible sets within each region were generated by ranking all variants by Bayes factor and calculating the number of variants required to reach a cumulative probability of 99%. In addition, we calculated credible sets in the same manner using the European ancestry and trans-ancestry meta-analysis results but including only the set of variants present in the AdmAFR meta-analysis. To summarize the size of the credible sets across the 5 lipid traits examined, we identified the set of independent index variants from the trans-ancestry meta-analysis after grouping variants based on LD. For each ± 500kb region centered around the most-significantly associated index variant for any trait, we determined the pairwise LD between all index variants in this region using LDpair 58 with all reference populations (1000 Genomes AFR, AMR, EAS, EUR, and SAS) included. We considered variants to be independent if they were outside of this region, had LD r 2 &lt; 0.7, or were not available in the LDpair reference populations. Variants within the credible sets were annotated with SnpEff 52 using WGSA 51 and with VEP 59 . The number of variants in LD with an index variant was determined using LDproxy 58 (Supplementary Table 20). Protein numbering was taken from dbSNP 60 . eQTL colocalization was performed using

            <rs type="version">3.4.3</rs> using the default parameters. Results from GTEx V8 62 were compared with the GWAS signals in the region defined by the larger of ±0.25cM or ±500kb surrounding each index variant. The eQTL and GWAS signals (based on p-values from MR-MEGA) were considered to be colocalized if PP3 + PP4 ≥ 0.8 and if PP4/(PP3+PP4) &gt; 0.9, where PP3 is the probability of two independent causal variants while PP4 is the probability of a single, shared causal variant.

        <p>We generated polygenic score weights using both: i) significant variants only (at a variety of p-value thresholds) and ii) using genome-wide methods. Meta-analysis results were first filtered to variants present in UK Biobank, MGI, and MVP with imputation info score &gt; 0.3. Pruning and thresholding was performed in 
            <rs type="software">PLINK</rs> 63 with ancestry-matched subsets of UK Biobank individuals (AdmAFR N=7,324, EUR N=40,000, SAS N=7,193, trans-ancestry: N=10,000 (80% EUR, 15% AdmAFR, 5% SAS)) or 1KGP3 (HIS N=347 , EAS N=504) used for LD reference. We additionally tested 1000 Genomes phase 3 with all populations included as the LD reference panel for the trans-ancestry score (results not shown), which gave very similar results to those of the UK Biobank trans-ancestry reference set originally selected for its larger sample size. P-value thresholds (after GC correction) of 5x10 -10 , 5x10 -9 , 5x10 -8 , 5x10 -7 , 5x10 -6 , 5x10 -5 , 5x10 -4 , 5x10 -3 , and 5x10 -2 were tested with distance thresholds of 250 and 500 kb and LD r 2 thresholds of 0.1 and 0.2. Polygenic score weights were also generated using PRS-CS 32 with the LD reference panels for African, East Asian, and European ancestry populations from 1000 Genomes provided by the developers. PRS-CS LD reference panels for the other ancestries were generated using 1000 Genomes following the same protocol as provided by the PRS-CS authors 32 . This included removing variants with MAF ≤ 0.01, ambiguous A/T or G/C variants, and restricting to variants included in HapMap3. Pairwise LD matrices within pre-defined LD blocks 64 (using European LDetect blocks for Hispanic and trans-ancestry LD calculations and Asian blocks for South Asian) were then calculated using 
            <rs type="software">PLINK</rs> and converted to HDF5 format.
        </p>
        <p>For each individual in the testing cohorts, polygenic scores were calculated as the sum of the dosages multiplied by the given weight at each variant. UK Biobank individuals not present in datasets used to generate the summary statistics (either Admixed African, white British, both Admixed African and white British, East Asian, South Asian, or all individuals excluding South Asian) were used to select the best performing Admixed African, European, Admixed African+European, East Asian, South Asian, and trans-ancestry polygenic scores, respectively. UK Biobank South Asian ancestry individuals were included in the transancestry risk score weights but excluded from the UK Biobank trans-ancestry testing set due to an initial focus on comparing predictions among European and African ancestry individuals. Sample sizes of the ancestry groups in UK Biobank used to test PRS performance included: AdmAFR N=6,863; EAS N=1,441; EUR N=389,158; SAS N=6,814; ALL=461,918. The best performing Hispanic ancestry polygenic score weights were selected based on performance in Hispanic ancestry individuals in the Michigan Genomics Initiative dataset. Model fit was assessed by the adjusted R 2 of a linear model for LDL-C value at initial assessment adjusted for cholesterol medication (divided by 0.7 to estimate pre-medication levels) with sex, batch, age at initial assessment, and PCs1-4 as covariates (Supplementary Tables 212223).

Association results for all index variants are given in Supplementary Table Polygenic scores were calculated separately in each ancestry group or in all ancestries combined using either pruning and thresholding or PRS-CS. The polygenic scores were then taken forward for testing in ancestry-matched participants followed by validation in independent data sets. By comparison to the gold-standard performance of the trans-ancestry-derived PRS in African Americans (adjusted R 2 = 0.12), a European ancestry derived score capture only 47% of the variance explained by the trans-ancestry PRS. When LD and association information from the target population is used to optimize the list of variants for inclusion in the PRS, but with ancestry-mismatched weights from European ancestry GWAS, the variance explained reaches 71% of the gold standard. If the PRS variant list selected in European ancestry individuals were genotyped in the target population, and PRS weights were updated using a GWAS from the target population, the variance explained reached 87% of the gold standard. Finally, deriving both the marker list and weights from the target population (single-ancestry GWAS) explained 94% of the variance relative to the gold-standard trans-ancestry PRS. 1. The mean effect size of Admixed African ancestry identified index variants is larger than from European ancestry analysis, reflecting the difference in power to detect an association within each group as a result of the &gt;10-fold difference in sample size. e) Number of loci identified within each ancestry group, normalized to a constant sample size of 100,000 individuals and averaged across lipid traits. At currently available sample sizes, trans-ancestry and European ancestry analyses identify a lower proportion of loci relative to the number of individuals than analyses of other ancestry groups. However, the larger sample size of European or trans-ancestry analyses leads to a greater relative proportion of novel loci and a higher proportion of loci significant only in European ancestry analyses. f) Proportion of index variants identified from each ancestry-specific meta-analysis that would be well-powered to detect an association of the same effect size but with ancestry-specific frequencies in the other ancestry groups. Dark blue regions indicate variants likely to be detected at an equivalent sample size only in the original ancestry group (i.e. ancestry-specific). Additional comparisons of allele frequencies and effect sizes across ancestries are provided in Supplementary Figure 3.
