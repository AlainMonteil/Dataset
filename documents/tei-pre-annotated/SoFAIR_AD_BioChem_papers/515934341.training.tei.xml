        <p>only the best local alignment between each pair (Methods). As an example, we illustrate the alignment between two 5 kb fragments originating from the D8Z2 centromeric HOR array. Here, a target fragmenti and a query fragmentj are aligned to each other, generating multiple potential alignments. The highestscoring alignment occurs between those with the most similar sequence and structure, and this guarantees registry among HORs wherever possible. Sequence identity is calculated from the highestscoring alignment between each pair (Methods) and stored in an N × N matrix, while the others are discarded. Sequence identities between each pair are plotted as data points in R using ggplot2 such that the highest identities are dark red and the lowest identities are dark purple. Since the N × N matrix has identical information on each side of the diagonal, only one half of the matrix is presented. andd) macaque chromosome 8 centromeric regions with PacBio 
            <rs type="software">HiFi</rs> and ONT data generated from the same genome reveals largely uniform coverage. The increase in coverage on the edges of the macaque centromeric region is due to the inability to resolve the two haplotypes flanking the centromeric satellite array. Our results suggest that there are too few allelic differences to distinguish the flanking haplotypes. The macaque α-satellite dimer array, however, is fully resolved and does not show any signs of sequence collapse. All assemblies are to scale. H1, haplotype 1; H2, haplotype 2.

Centromeric α-satellite HORs evolve in the center of the array via unequal crossing over and homogenization, pushing older, more ancient HORs to the edges, consistent with hypotheses previously put forth [6][7][8] . The centromeric mutation rate is estimated to be at least 4.8-8.4 x 10 -8 mutations per base pair per generation, which is 2.2-to 3.8-fold higher than the mean basal mutation rate.of the α-satellite in each clade is indicated in Panel b. b) Location of α-satellite from each clade from Panel a.

        <p>Supplementary Figure 8. Mappability of short reads within the D8Z2 α-satellite HOR array. To determine the mappability of short reads within the chromosome 8 centromeric HOR array, we performed a simulation where we generated 150 base fragments from five 416 kb regions across the HOR array and mapped them back to the D8Z2 α-satellite HOR array using a) 
            <rs type="software">BWA-MEM</rs> or b) our kmer-based mapping approach (Methods). We find that the fragments mapped preferentially to the regions from which they originated. Importantly, we find that these fragments do not preferentially map to the hypomethylated region, where CENP-A is predicted to be located (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 8), indicating that mapping biases are not at an appreciable level in this region.
