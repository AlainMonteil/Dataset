        <p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing threat to human and animal health.Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing threat to human and animal health.</p>
        <p>Progress in molecular biology has revealed new and significant challenges for AMR mitigation given the immense diversity of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), the complexity of ARG transfer, and the broad range of omnipresent factors contributing to AMR. Municipal, hospital and abattoir wastewater are collected and treated in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), where the presence of diverse selection pressures together with a highly concentrated consortium of pathogenic/commensal microbes create favourable conditions for the transfer of ARGs and proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARBs). The recent emergence ARBs and ARGs as well as their potential health effects have re-defined the role of WWTPs as a focal point in the fight against AMR. By reviewing the occurrence of ARGs in wastewater and sludge and the current technologies used to quantify ARGs and identify antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB), this paper provides a research roadmap to address existing challenges in AMR control via wastewater treatment. Wastewater treatment is a double-edged sword that can act as either a pathway for AMR spread or as a barrier to reduce the environmental release of anthropogenic AMR. State of the art ARB identification technologies, such as metagenomic sequencing and fluorescence-activated cell sorting, have enriched ARG/ARB databases, unveiled keystone species in AMR networks, and improved the resolution of AMR dissemination models. Data and information provided in this review highlight significant knowledge gaps. These include inconsistencies in ARG reporting units, lack of ARG/ARB monitoring surrogates, lack of a standardised protocol for determining ARG removal via wastewater treatments, and the inability to support appropriate risk assessment. This is due to a lack of standard monitoring targets and agreed threshold values, and paucity of information on the ARG-pathogen host relationship and potential risk evolution. These research gaps need to be addressed and research findings need to be transformed into practical guidance for WWTP operators to enable effective progress towards mitigating the evolution and spread of AMR.Progress in molecular biology has revealed new and significant challenges for AMR mitigation given the immense diversity of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), the complexity of ARG transfer, and the broad range of omnipresent factors contributing to AMR.

        <p>Municipal wastewater treatment is essential for the protection of public health and the aquatic environment. A typical wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) integrates multiple engineering processes, including physical, chemical, and biological treatment steps. Biological treatment involves the use of microorganisms to remove wastewater contaminants (i.e. organic carbon, nutrients, and micropollutants). The microorganisms performing this service are extremely diverse, and the microbial community structure of each treatment system is unique and evolves over time.Municipal wastewater treatment is essential for the protection of public health and the aquatic environment.

        <p>One of the primary objectives of wastewater treatment is to reduce the transmission of waterborne diseases. Wastewater treatment also plays a critical role in controlling the release of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) to the environment. Multiple chemical factors including disinfectants, metals (e.g. copper and zinc), various pharmaceuticals (e.g. antibiotics), and other organic compounds exist within a WWTP. Chemical factors are among diverse selection pressures that influence the transmission, expression and mobilisation of ARGs and drive the emergence, persistence, and proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) (Guo et al., 2015;Li et al., 2019;Zhang et al., 2017b). Wastewater (sewage) also provides a continuous input of ARGs, ARB, and highly diverse commensal and pathogenic bacteria from human and animal microbiomes into WWTPs. ARGs often assemble in close proximity to one another on mobile genetic elements (MGEs) generating complex resistance regions (CRRs). In such cases, the acquisition of a single plasmid (a type of MGE) can confer a multiple drug resistance (MDR) phenotype to the host bacterium that acquires it. This is particularly problematic when it occurs on plasmids that carry important virulence gene cargo (Venturini et al., 2010;Venturini et al., 2013;Mangat et al., 2017). There are examples in the literature where Escherichia coli with a commensal phylogroup (phylogroup B1) have caused serious human disease (urosepsis), as evidenced by their isolation from multiple body fluids. Subsequent genomic analysis shows the acquisition of a virulence plasmid with a CRR is likely to have precipitated these pathological events (McKinnon et al., 2018). Together, conditions found in WWTPs create an ideal environment for the evolution of new and more complex CRRs as well as their horizontal gene transfer (HGT) to new hosts. Infections caused by ARB, especially those with MDR phenotype, are hard to treat due to reduced antibiotic efficacy, and result in higher medical costs due to prolonged hospital stays and increased morbidity and mortality (World Health Organization, 2020).One of the primary objectives of wastewater treatment is to reduce the transmission of waterborne diseases.

        <p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a cross-cutting, complex, and growing threat to global health. Not surprisingly, dedicated reviews have appeared on this topic, with many focussing exclusively on antibiotic resistance, the fate and distribution of ARGs/ARB during wastewater treatment (Pazda et al., 2019;Rizzo et al., 2013;Sharma et al., 2016), or on the proliferation of ARGs in the environment (Martínez et al., 2015;Partridge et al., 2018;Rice et al., 2020). Unlike these previous reviews, our work aims to provide a new perspective that focuses on the interface between wastewater treatment and microbial genetics. By coupling interdisciplinary perspectives in wastewater treatment with genetic and genomic epidemiology, this review defines a research roadmap to mitigate the evolution and transmission of AMR and to provide new insights to AMR characterization, surveillance and monitoring, and risk modelling and assessment during various stages of wastewater treatment. Discussion and literature data summarised in this review may guide the water industry to play an active role in addressing the threat of AMR to global health. This review aims to be critical rather than exhaustive and descriptive. It first examines pertinent challenges in quantifying AMR in wastewater and key mechanisms of ARG proliferation. State of the art technologies that demonstrated the capacity to quantify ARGs and identify their hosts (especially pathogenic hosts) are presented, and the risks associated with ARG and ARB in wastewater are discussed. Factors governing ARG removal and transfer are also examined. Data and information compiled for this review are critically analysed to identify key challenges in the monitoring and control of ARGs during wastewater treament and to suggest a roadmap for future research.Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a cross-cutting, complex, and growing threat to global health.

        <p>Numerous ARGs including types and subtypes of almost all common antibiotics have been detected in wastewater influent, effluent and biosolids or sludge. Examples of these ARGs are available in Table 1. The antibiotic classes included in Table 1 cover the most commonly prescribed and consumed antibiotics in the health care, veterinary, and livestock sectors (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2019; Pazda et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2020). Table 1 provides a snapshot from the recent literature; a more comprehensive list of ARGs in WWTP compartments is available in previous reviews (Pazda et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2020). The occurrence of ARGs in treated effluent and wastewater sludge may pose a risk because these ARGs can potentially be acquired by new bacteria in downstream environments through HGT (Cantón et al., 2012;Perry and Wright, 2013). A major objective of wastewater treatment is to inactivate pathogens prior to effluent discharge. But this remit needs to be reconsidered in the context of AMR because commensal, non-pathogenic bacteria can also be important reservoirs for plasmids and other mobile genetic elements (MGEs) carrying ARGs.Numerous ARGs including types and subtypes of almost all common antibiotics have been detected in wastewater influent, effluent and biosolids or sludge.

        <p>WWTPs could provide unparalleled opportunities to control the proliferation of ARGs. The potential role of wastewater treatment as a barrier against AMR is further discussed in Section 4.5.2. would require a common unit for ARG concentration that can be used consistently across samples to establish a dose-response relationship for risk assessment.WWTPs could provide unparalleled opportunities to control the proliferation of ARGs.

        <p>A bacterial host cell can acquire antibiotic resistance through three different routes: Plasmids and class 1 integrons linked to the proliferation of ARGs through HGT have been detected in all compartments of a typical WWTP (Figure 2). Of particular note is the significantly higher abundance and diversity of plasmids and Class 1 integrons in activated sludge and anaerobically digested sludge compared to primary (raw) sludge and tertiary The current lack of data on the occurrence and fate of plasmids and class 1 integrons in wastewater treatment can also be attributed to technical difficulties in detecting and quantifying these MGEs due to their variable nature (e.g., frequent recombination and ancestral versions).A bacterial host cell can acquire antibiotic resistance through three different routes: Plasmids and class 1 integrons linked to the proliferation of ARGs through HGT have been detected in all compartments of a typical WWTP (Figure 2).

        <p>A major challenge in ARG management is the identification of ARG-hosts (ARB), of which human pathogens present the greatest risk. Host-identification is necessary to understand how ARGs might spread to pathogensboth existing and emerging. This section will discuss the context in which ARGs in wastewater microorganisms can become problematic, provide an overview of current technologies that can be used to elucidate ARG and host relationships, and summarise relevant findings revealed using these technologies to date.A major challenge in ARG management is the identification of ARG-hosts (ARB), of which human pathogens present the greatest risk.

        <p>ARGs in WWTPs can pose human health risks through several routes (Figure 3). WWTPs can act as a reservoir of ARGs and facilitate ARG exchange via HGT. Indeed, non-ARG hosts in WWTP influents can potentially acquire ARGs while passing through the wastewater treatment process (Hultman et al., 2018). This premise is supported by Jacquiod etARGs in WWTPs can pose human health risks through several routes (Figure 3). WWTPs can act as a reservoir of ARGs and facilitate ARG exchange via HGT.

        <p>It is noteworthy that not all ARGs pose the same risk level to human health. A The risk associated with a particular ARB depends on multiple factors in addition to its classification as reservoir, carrier, vector, or pathogen. These factors include the frequency of exposure to a human body (Johnson et al., 2016), modes of transmission and portal of entry, the infectious dose (the number of cells required to colonize or infect humans), the capacity to acquire and disseminate ARGs to the host microbiome, and the types and diversity of ARGs it harbors (Manaia, 2017). A pathogen with a low infectious dose, residing in an environmental compartment with high exposure to humans, conferring resistance to last-resort antibiotics or multiple antibiotics, will be classified at the top level of risk. It is important to note that bacteria can occur in high-density aggregates (i.e. biofilm) where they can reach clinically relevant infectious doses, even if their average abundance in the environmental is below the infectious dose (Manaia, 2017). Similarly, it may also be possible to selectively target plasmids and separate them from chromosomal DNA. qPCR has also been used to estimate plasmid transfer frequency in bacterial communities since 2010 (Bonot and Merlin, 2010). Several tools in Table 2 can be used to identify ARG-hosts. Further discussion of these tools for ARG-host identification and findings from their recent applications are discussed below.It is noteworthy that not all ARGs pose the same risk level to human health.

        <p>Potential ARG-hosts can be inferred from the correlation between ARG abundance (obtained using qPCR) and bacterial species abundance (obtained using 16S rRNA sequencing). This method assumes that a positive correlation indicates co-occurrence between an ARG and a taxon, and a stronger correlation means a higher likelihood of the taxon to be the ARG-host.

        <p>Similar to epicPCR, the genomic cross-linking method also relies on the fusion of ARGs and 16S rRNA genes to create hybrid products for sequencing (Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009). However, the hybrid product was created using proximity ligation cross-linking and restriction enzymes rather than PCR (Schmitt et al., 2016). Stalder et al. (2019) reported using this method to identify 12 taxa as ARG-hosts, among which Aeromonadaceae was considered a keystone taxon in wastewater. This taxon is linked to at least 18 ARGs in two WWTPs, conferring resistance to eight antibiotic classes. The broadest host range in wastewater was observed for IncQ plasmids and class 1 integrons, while several narrow-host-range plasmids were almost exclusively linked to Enterobacteriaceae.Similar to epicPCR, the genomic cross-linking method also relies on the fusion of ARGs and 16S rRNA genes to create hybrid products for sequencing (Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009).

        <p>Many studies investigating ARG-hosts have not identified whether these hosts are reservoirs, carriers, vectors, or pathogens. Thus, there is still a gap in the literature regarding the relationship between ARGs and pathogenic species. For example, pathogens were detected in activated sludge, swine wastewater, and the receiving water, but there was no information on whether they are ARB or not (Jia et al., 2017;Yadav and Kapley, 2019). This is due to the existence of multiple strains within a species (with different ARG carriage) as well as the limitations of ARG-host identification technologies (discussed in Section 4.2) in resolving the host down to strain, and sometimes species level in complex microbial communities found inMany studies investigating ARG-hosts have not identified whether these hosts are reservoirs, carriers, vectors, or pathogens.

        <p>Previous studies have revealed some common ARB detected in WWTPs (Section 4.2, Supplementary Information). At the phylum level, Proteobacteria harbour the highest number of identified ARB, followed by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes (Liu et al., 2019). At the order level, Bacteroidales, Clostridiales, Burkholderiales and Enterobacterales are notable ARGhosts. These are also the most common taxa in wastewater. Liu et al. (2019) reported that activated sludge samples of Taiwanese WWTPs contained Proteobacteria harbouring a diverse range of ARGs (88 were identified), while Burkholderiaceae were hosts to 50 different ARGs.Previous studies have revealed some common ARB detected in WWTPs (Section 4.2, Supplementary Information).

        <p>The order Burkholderiales contains environmental saprophytic organisms, human and animal pathogens, which therefore pose a risk of spreading AMR.

        <p>It is possible that the frequently detected taxa above act as ARG transfer hubs and form a "core permissive fraction" (Jacquiod et al., 2017;Li et al., 2018b). This core fraction of keystone taxa possesses high plasmid permissiveness (i.e. the capability to transfer an exogenous plasmid within a microbial community) (Musovic et al., 2010). Plasmid To further support the "core permissive fraction" theory, it has been proposed that specific microbial taxa carry specific ARGs. Liu et al. (2019) reported that among the 159 ARGs detected in activated sludge samples, only seven ARGs were shared by the primary ARG-carrying phyla. A significant number of ARGs (62.3%) were carried by unique host phyla (Liu et al., 2019). This phenomenon can be linked to the capability of specific species to host specific plasmids (Qiu et al., 2018;Redondo-Salvo et al., 2020). Thus, developing a database of ARGs and their associated hosts is crucial in managing and mitigating ARG dissemination in general, and in identifying suitable ARB and ARG surrogates in particular.It is possible that the frequently detected taxa above act as ARG transfer hubs and form a "core permissive fraction" (Jacquiod et al., 2017;Li et al., 2018b).

        <p>Faecal coliforms, P. aeruginosa, Enterococci, and Enterobacteria have been considered as ARB surrogates (Hiller et al., 2019). They are omnipresent in the wastewater ecosystem and frequently detected as active ARG carriers and vectors. In addition, their abundances are highly quantifiable, as they have already been used as faecal contamination indicators. Thus, these bacteria appear to be ideal ARB surrogates, and in fact, ESBL-producing E. coli has been chosen as the target for a pilot surveillance program initiated by WHO, the EU, and several Asia and Africa countries (Jorge Matheu, 2017). Other representative Gram-positive and Gram-negative indicator bacteria are also worthy of consideration.Faecal coliforms, P. aeruginosa, Enterococci, and Enterobacteria have been considered as ARB surrogates (Hiller et al., 2019).

        <p>An ARG surrogate should allow for direct confirmation of the existence of antibiotic resistance. Similar to the requirements for suitable ARB surrogates, ARG surrogates should ideally be ubiquitous in wastewater, and easily and accurately quantified using current technology. Frequently detected ARGs conferring resistance to broad-spectrum antibiotics such as sulphonamide (sul1 and sul2) and tetracycline (tetA, tetB, tetO and tetW) are likely to be useful surrogates for the evaluation of treatment efficiencies (Hiller et al., 2019) Frequently detected ARGs (Table 1) exhibited higher non-random co-occurrence events in wastewater samples than random events (Jia et al., 2017). Their co-occurrence expands the possibility of identifying suitable ARG surrogates. For example, Li et al. (2015) revealed that tetM and aminoglycoside resistance protein were the main hubs of an ARG co-occurrence network built from 50 environmental samples using metagenomics and network analysis. These ARGs could be useful surrogates to quantitatively estimate the abundance of 23 other co-occurring ARG subtypes by power functions. Besides correlation and network analysis, modelling and machine learning approaches can be applied to identify ARG surrogates and develop ARG-predictive models for routine monitoring (Ishii, 2020;Li et al., 2018a). MGEs should also be taken into consideration; for example, the class 1 integron integrase gene can serve as an excellent indicator of MDR bacteria and anthropogenic pollution (Gillings et al., 2015;Leverstein-van Hall et al., 2003). It is also suggested that data on associated environmental variables (e.g. temperature, water turbidity, faecal indicator, and pathogen levels) should be collated for the determination of potential ARG indicators.An ARG surrogate should allow for direct confirmation of the existence of antibiotic resistance.

MGEs should also be taken into consideration; for example, the class 1 integron integrase gene can serve as an excellent indicator of MDR bacteria and anthropogenic pollution (Gillings et al., 2015;Leverstein-van Hall et al., 2003). It is also suggested that data on associated environmental variables (e.g. temperature, water turbidity, faecal indicator, and pathogen levels) should be collated for the determination of potential ARG indicators.</p>
        <p>An important aspect of AMR dissemination is the interplay among the various factors that can affect ARG removal and transfer (Figure 5).

        <p>Stress-inducing conditions such as exposure to antimicrobials, heavy metals, and disinfectants at low doses, can stimulate ARG development and dissemination. These stressors share a common stimulating mechanism through multiple alterations in bacterial gene expression. Stressors increase the expression of the SOS response system, which in turn increases genetic instability, promoting DNA mutations (Händel et al., 2014). The reactive oxygen species generated in response to stress can also damage bacterial membranes, resulting in enhanced cell permeability and facilitating HGT events. In addition, stressors can alter the expression of conjugation-relevant genes, e.g. inducing more sex pili on cell surfaces. These act as pathways for ARG transfer (Guo et al., 2015), and reduce the activity of regulatory genes.Stress-inducing conditions such as exposure to antimicrobials, heavy metals, and disinfectants at low doses, can stimulate ARG development and dissemination.

        <p>Exposure to antibiotics accelerates the transfer rate of ARGs in environmental samples. This arises from an antibiotic's ability to exert pressure on exposed microorganisms/bacteria thus inducing resistance to itself, and/or stimulate the transfer of MGEs responsible for the dissemination of resistance determinants (Depardieu et al., 2007). Exposure to the antibiotic trimethoprim significantly increased the rate of HGT in an activated sludge bacterial community (Li et al., 2019). Triclosan exposure at concentrations frequently detected in wastewater (0.02-20 μg/L) could stimulate HGT of plasmid-encoded MDR genes within and across genera (Lu et al., 2018). Even at a low concentration of tetracycline (10 μg/L which is 150 times below the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the ARG recipient), HGT of ARG determinants in WWTP activated sludge and effluent could still be stimulated (Jutkina et al., 2016;Kim et al., 2014). This may explain the higher ARG abundance and diversity in sludge from pharmaceutical wastewater treatment compared to municipal WWTP sludge (Tao et al., 2016). Efforts in antimicrobial stewardship (i.e. strategies to improve appropriate use and minimise adverse effects of antibiotics) within hospitals and communities could contribute significantly to the mitigation of ARG occurrence in wastewater. These stewardship programs have proven to effectively reduce antibiotic dosages and resistance (Nathwani et 2012) revealed a similar increase in HGT frequency under the presence of nanomaterials (e.g. nanoalumina). Copper nanoparticles and copper ions have also been reported to stimulate the HGT of MDR genes at environmentally-relevant and sub-inhibitory concentrations (i.e. 1-100 μmol/L) (Zhang et al., 2019c). Notably, metal stress can increase the plasmid permissiveness of the microbial community by more than 1000-fold (Klümper et al., 2017). These findings highlight the vital importance of source control to decrease the release of metals, nanoparticles and organic contaminants into wastewater and the wider environment.Exposure to antibiotics accelerates the transfer rate of ARGs in environmental samples.

        <p>Besides the aforementioned stimulators, other conditions such as wastewater disinfection, oxygen level, and the spatial distribution of bacteria can also accelerate ARG dissemination. Several studies have demonstrated that sub-inhibitory (0.1-1 mg Cl2/L) or low doses of chlorine (&lt; 40 mg Cl2 min/L) led to the increases in intra-genera and inter-genera HGT of ARGs by 2 to 7.5-fold (Guo et al., 2015;Zhang et al., 2017b). Meanwhile, oxygen level can affect bacterial community composition and in turn affect ARG profileration. For example, aerobic sludge reportedly has a higher proportion of Proteobacteria (27%) than anaerobic sludge (21%), thus allowing for two times higher plasmid abundance (Tao et al., 2016). Furthermore, bacterial biofilms, particularly at the air-liquid interface (i.e. higher oxygen level), are potential hotspots for plasmid-mediated ARG transfer due to the high densities of plasmid donor and recipient cells (Król et al., 2011).Besides the aforementioned stimulators, other conditions such as wastewater disinfection, oxygen level, and the spatial distribution of bacteria can also accelerate ARG dissemination.

        <p>The type of wastewater treatment processes can impact the removal of ARG and ARB. Fenton oxidation offers complete reduction (5-log decrease) of ARB to below the detection limit with relatively short treatment time (20 minutes) and lower energy (0.98 kJ/L) compared to other solar driven AOPs (i.e. H2O2/sunlight, TiO2/sunlight, H2O2/TiO2/sunlight) (Ferro et al., 2015). A sufficiently high dose of chlorine (&gt;80 mg Cl2 min/L) applied within a short contact time (~30 min) can inactivate ARB and mitigate their regrowth or reactivation (Guo et al., 2015), thus decreasing ARG abundance (Guo et al., 2015;Pei et al., 2019). Zhang et al. (2017b) also observed that exposure to chlorine, chloramine and hydrogen peroxide concentrations higher than MICs significantly suppressed conjugative transfer within E. coli strains and across genera from E. coli to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Similarly, high UV doses (&gt;10 mJ/cm 2 ) can exhibit lethal effects on bacterial communities, thus reducing the number of ARB to below 10 4 CFU/mL, and suppressing the conjugative transfer of ARGcarrying plasmids (i.e. HGT) (Guo et al., 2015).The type of wastewater treatment processes can impact the removal of ARG and ARB.

        <p>Although disinfection demonstrates high efficacy in ARG removal, it is also necessary to recognise their limitations and disadvantages. For example, UV treatment processes at WWTPs are less efficient than in simulated laboratory experiments partly due to the high doses required (Chen and Zhang, 2013;Zhang et al., 2017a). High doses of chlorine (&gt;80 mg Cl2 min/L) needed for efficient ARB inactivation are also not practical due to high corrosion risk, toxicity and harmful chemical byproducts, thus requires increased dechlorination and safety regulations. Ozonation process offers greater reduction of ARB, pB10 plasmids, and pB10 plasmid transfer rate compared to chlorination (Pak et al., 2016). However, an excessive ozone dose (&gt;0.55 g O3 g DOC -1 ) can result in harmful by-products (e.g. nitrosamines or bromate) (Czekalski et al., 2016). Disinfectants might also result in the selection of more resistant strains that can regrow during and subsequent treatment (Huang et al., 2011;Xi et al., 2009).Although disinfection demonstrates high efficacy in ARG removal, it is also necessary to recognise their limitations and disadvantages.

        <p>Similar to disinfectants, exposure to metal stressors at high doses (mainly at the influent e.g. A targeted treatment method using phage therapy or engineered phage lysin to control high-risk ARB was suggested by Rice et al. (2020). Phage/phage lysin can kill specific bacteria with high effectiveness and specificity with minimal disruption of the normal microbial community (Jassim et al., 2016;Yang et al., 2014). Phages are self-replicating and selflimiting, and phage therapy has shown promising results in controlling foaming bacteria in CAS process. Keystone taxa in the ARG-transfer network (Section 4.4.1) could be regarded as "Achilles heels" to be targeted using phage therapy (Pinilla-Redondo et al., 2018). However, bacteria can develop mechanisms to prevent phage infection such as the restrictionmodification system (i.e. CRISPR/Cas system) and modification to their cell wall receptors (Jore et al., 2012). Phage can also contribute to bacterial virulence and HGT of ARG through transduction (lysogenic cycle) or release of ARG during cell lysis (lytic cycle) that can be uptaken by other bacteria via transformation (Section 3). Besides, successful phage therapy requires a comprehensive understanding of the target bacteria in the microbial population, phage-host interactions, dose optimization, and other chemical and physical factors (Jassim et al., 2016).

        <p>The presence of ARGs in any environment is a natural phenomenon. ARGs have been detected in pristine environments not affected by anthropogenic activities (e.g. Antarctic marine water) (Brown and Balkwill, 2008;De Souza et al., 2006;Van Goethem et al., 2018). ARGs should not be merely quantified and reported but need to be interpreted based on the significance of their presence and how it is related to rapid evolution and spread of MDR bacteria (Zhang et al., 2019a). The identification of critical risk thresholds for ARB and ARG exposures that influence human health is also important in developing mitigation strategies (Pruden et al., 2018). However, ARG quality thresholds or standards have not been established even in wastewater and sludge. Several studies have attempted to use ARG concentration in pristine environments (i.e. river's source water) as the natural "resistance background" level or reference to determine the magnitude of the ARG problem in urban stream, hospital effluent, and animal husbandry wastewater (Ouyang et al., 2015;Rowe et al., 2017). This approach appears impractical since the "background" concentration would be different for each geographical location and require re-assessment. A potential solution is to establish a set of threshold values and standardised conditions to serve as the ARG reference, such as those developed by the European Commission for endocrine-disrupting compounds (European Commission, 2011).The presence of ARGs in any environment is a natural phenomenon.

        <p>ARG quantity in a sample is usually reported in terms of relative or absolute abundance using various units such as one ARG read per one million reads (denoted as ppm), copies of ARG per copies of 16S rRNA gene, or copies of ARG per mL. The difference in methods used for ARG quantification is the underlying reason for these different units. Standardization of an ARG unit is necessary to allow for comparisons between results and effective management of the ARG issue. Ideally, ARGs should be reported in terms of concentration (copies per mL) or relative abundance (copies per bacteria cell) for consistency with the WWTP context and removal calculation. The method for unit conversion was introduced recently, through normalization of ARG abundance by the absolute copy number of 16S rRNA (which can be obtained reliably using qPCR), or by the number of bacterial cells per litre (which can be estimated from 16S rRNA copy number) (Ouyang et al., 2015;Su et al., 2017). However, the current unit conversion method has limitations when applied to microbial communities with very different copy numbers of 16S rRNA.

        <p>The removal efficiency of ARGs by WWTPs is often considered by the difference between the total abundance of ARGs in the influent (i.e input) and effluent (i.e. output) (Section 4.5.2). In some studies, the performance of individual treatment stages (e.g. primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment) on ARG removal within the overall WWTP workflow has been reported. This process of reporting neglects the behaviour of ARGs and ARB within each treatment processes (Cheng and Hong, 2017;Du et al., 2015;Kappell et al., 2018;Liang et al., 2021;Lin et al., 2021). In the context of ARGs in WWTP, apart from the ARG input in the influent, other contributing factors such as bacterial growth and decay, ARG transfer due to VGT and HGT, and ARG loss from a host (segregation) must all be assessed. Many of these factors have not been mathematically described and fully understood to assess the performance of WWTP in the literature. Thus, an insignificant difference between the ARG abundance/richness in the influent and the effluent does not necessarily imply a poor performance of WWTP process.The removal efficiency of ARGs by WWTPs is often considered by the difference between the total abundance of ARGs in the influent (i.e input) and effluent (i.e. output) (Section 4.5.2).

        <p>Currently, it is difficult to quantify the exact risk associated with the occurrence of ARGs in wastewater. Detection of ARGs in WWTPs is currently reported in units that cannot be directly used for assessing health consequences and risk. In wastewater treatment, chemical contaminants are commonly expressed in µg/L of wastewater or µg/kg of sludge. Likewise, pathogens are quantified in CFU/g of sludge or CFU/mL (CFU stands for colony forming unit) (World Health Organization, 2020). These units (i.e. µg/L, µg/kg, CFU/g and CFU/mL) can be directly linked to relevant guidelines or standards to evaluate the associated risk via a doseresponse relationship. In other words, there are defined threshold concentrations of chemical contaminants or pathogens to trigger regulatory responses. By contrast, ARG in water samples are expressed in ppm (one ARG per million reads), copies/mL or normalized by 16S copies to account for sequencing depth (Al-Jassim et al., 2015; Christgen et al., 2015; Ferro et al., 2016). Unlike the units of chemical contaminants and pathogens, these ARG concentration or abundance units are not comparable and can only be indirectly converted to one another with some uncertainties.
