        <p>All-atom Monte Carlo Simulations.</p>
        <p>All Monte Carlo simulations were performed using the 
            <rs type="software">CAMPARI</rs> simulation engine and ABSINTH implicit solvent model (abs_3.2_opls.prm) using the monovalent ion parameters derived by Mao et al. 4 . All simulations were performed at 330 K and at 15 mM NaCl, as have been used previously in various systems [5][6][7][8] . The base keyfile used for all Monte Carlo simulations can be found at https://github.com/holehouse-lab/supportingdata/.
        </p>
        <p>Simulation analysis was performed with 
            <rs type="software">MDTraj</rs> and 
            <rs type="software">camparitraj</rs> (
            <rs type="url">http://ctraj.com/)</rs> 9 . For IDR only simulations, all degrees of freedom were fully sampled (backbone and sidechain dihedral angles and rigid-body positions) as is standard in 
            <rs type="software">CAMPARI</rs> Monte Carlo simulations 10 . For simulations of IDRs in the context of folded domains, the backbone dihedral angles of the folded domains were held fixed, while all sidechains were fully sampled, as were backbone dihedral angles for the disordered regions, as applied previously 11 . The folded state starting structures were obtained from PDB structures obtained from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (see below for more details).
        </p>
        <p>For IDR-only simulations, 30-40 independent simulations were run generating final ensembles of 40-60 K conformations. For simulations of IDRs in the context of folded domains, the number of independent simulations and the length of the simulation varied. For the NTD-RBD simulations 400 independent simulations were run using an initial molecular dynamics based sampling approach to obtain starting states for the folded domain, with 2 independent simulations per starting seed from MD simulations (see methods below) leading to a final ensemble of ~400 K conformations (24 M steps per simulation). For the RBD-LINK-dimerization construct, thirty-five independent simulations were run for a final ensemble of 32 K conformers (66 M steps per simulation). For the dimerization-CTD construct 200 independent simulations were run providing a final ensemble of 40 K conformations (66 M steps per simulation). For a complete description of simulation details see Table S5, and Table S7 for a list of sequences.</p>
        <p>For both the NTD-RBD construct and the DIM-CTD construct, we used a sequential sampling approach in which long timescale MD simulations of the RBD in isolation performed on the 
            <rs type="software">Folding@home</rs> distributed computing platform were first used to generate hundreds of starting conformations 12 . Those RBD conformations were then used as starting structures for independent all-atom Monte Carlo simulations. Monte Carlo simulations were performed with the ABSINTH forcefield in which the RBD backbone dihedral angles are held fixed but the NTD is fully sampled, as are RBD sidechains. For simulations of the monomeric dimerization domain we discovered that as a monomer, the first 21 residues of the dimerization domain appear disordered, in agreement with sequence predictions (Fig. 1A) but in contrast to their behavior in the dimeric structure (Fig. 1C). As a result, we choose to also model these residues as fully disordered.
        </p>
        <p>The RBD starting structure used was taken as the first chain extracted from the 6VYO PDB crystal structure, which is structurally almost identical to many of the 6YI3 NMR model shown in Fig. 1A. At the time that our work on this project began the 6VYO structure was the only available structure of the RBD. Irrespective, the extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulation run prior to our Monte Carlo simulations are such that any small difference in starting structure are negated by many microseconds of simulation sampling.</p>
        <p>To generate the monomeric starting structure of the dimerization domain, we first built a homology model of the SARS-CoV-2 dimerization dimer from the NMR structure of the SARS dimerization structure (PDB: 2JW8) using SWISS-MODEL 13,14 . We chose this strategy because at the time, no dimerization structure existed, a situation that has since resolved itself 15,16 .</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the SARS and SARS-CoV-2 dimerization domains are essentially identical, such that this is a minor detail. As with the RBD, the application of extensive MD simulations prior to Monte Carlo simulations negates any differences in starting structure.</p>
        <p>For RBD-link-dimerization domain simulations (316 residue systems), we opted to use a single starting seed structure for the folded domains based on the NMR and crystal-structure conformations for the RBD and dimerization domains, respectively. During these simulations, a subset of the trajectories became stuck due to long-lived interactions between the RBD and the dimerization domain, an effect likely that rose from exposed hydrophobic residues in the dimerization domain being exposed as 'folded' residues. To mitigate the impact of these unphysiological sub-ensembles, we identified trajectories in which we found contiguous simulation frames in which 25% or more of the total simulation ensemble showed unvarying interdye distance. This diagnostic identified 3 of the 31 independent replicas as being problematic, and these were discarded from our analysis. The remaining ensemble consists of 29 independent trajectories. Excluded volume (EV) simulations were performed using the same setup, but with a modified Hamiltonian under which solvation, attractive Lennard-Jones, and polar (charge) interactions are scaled to zero, as described previously 17 .</p>
        <p>All molecular dynamics simulations of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein were performed with Gromacs 2019 using the 
            <rs type="software">AMBER</rs>
            <rs type="version">03</rs> force field with explicit TIP3P solvent [18][19][20] . Simulations were prepared by placing the starting structure in a dodecahedron box that extends 1.0 Å beyond the protein in any dimension. The system was then solvated, and energy minimized with a steepest descents algorithm until the maximum force fell below 100 kJ/mol/nm using a step size of 0.01 nm and a cutoff distance of 1.2 nm for the neighbor list, Coulomb interactions, and van der Waals interactions. For production runs, all bonds were constrained with the LINCS algorithm and virtual sites were used to allow a 4 fs time step 21,22 . Cutoffs of 1.1 nm were used for the neighbor list with 0.9 for Coulomb and van der Waals interactions. The Verlet cutoff scheme was used for the neighbor list. The stochastic velocity rescaling (v-rescale) thermostat was used to hold the temperature at 300 K 23 . Conformations were stored every 20 ps.
        </p>
        <p>The FAST algorithm was used to enhance conformational sampling and quickly explore the dominant motions of nucleoprotein 24,25 . FAST-pocket simulations were run for 6 rounds, with 10 simulations per round, where each simulation was 40 ns in length (2.4 μs aggregate simulation).</p>
        <p>The FAST-pocket ranking function favored restarting simulations from states with large pocket openings. Additionally, a similarity penalty was added to the ranking to promote conformational diversity in starting structures, as has been described previously 26 . The FAST dataset was clustered using a k-centers algorithm based on RMSD between frames using backbone heavy atoms (C, Cα, Cβ, N, O) to generate 1421 discrete states, which were then launched on the distributed computing platform 
            <rs type="software">Folding@home</rs> 12 .
        </p>
        <p>To generate large-scale ensembles of the folded domains, extensive simulations on the Folding@home platform were used. For the RBD, folding@home produced 500 μs of aggregate simulation data. For a monomeric version of dimerization domain, Folding@home produced 2.12 ms of aggregate simulation data. For each of these datasets, a final k-centers clustering was performed with the combined Folding@home and FAST data using 
            <rs type="software">Enspara</rs> (
            <rs type="url">https://github.com/bowman-lab/enspara)</rs> 27 . This clustering was performed the same as described above and generated 200 discrete states that capture maximal diversity in the conformational ensemble of the two folded domains. These states were then used as the starting seeds for the folded domain conformations in CAMPARI simulations.
        </p>
        <p>The NTD and RBD combined are 173 residues of folded and disordered protein, while the dimerization domain and CTD combined are almost exactly the same size at 172 residues.</p>
        <p>Systems of this size raises a significant challenge for all-atom sampling. To address this we leveraged a novel approach in which we first ran long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of folded domains alone using the 
            <rs type="software">Folding@Home</rs> platform and the FAST approach for enhanced conformational sampling 12,25 . From each of the trajectories of the RBD or dimerization domain, we then identified 200 conformationally distinct states based on these simulations which we used as "seeds'' for the starting structures of the folded domains in our Monte Carlo simulations. Using these seeds, we reconstructed the previously missing disordered regions (NTD and CTD, respectively) and ran all-atom Monte Carlo simulations in which the disordered regions are fully sampled, the folded domain sidechains are fully sampled, but the folded domains backbone dihedral angles are held fixed. For the NTD-RBD construct we ran two replicas of each starting conformation were run, with 400 independent simulations generating a total ensemble of ~400 K conformations. For the dimerization domain we did not run independent replicas from the same starting configuration, such that 200 independent simulations were run that generated an ensemble of 200 K conformations. In parallel, we also ran simulations of the NTD and CTD in isolation, enabling an assessment of the impact of the folded domain.
        </p>
        <p>Coarse-grained simulations were performed using the 
            <rs type="software">PIMMS</rs> software package 
            <rs type="version">5</rs>,28 . 
            <rs type="software">PIMMS</rs> is a Monte Carlo lattice-based simulation engine in which each bead engages in anisotropic interactions with every adjacent lattice site. Moves used here were cluster translation/rotation moves and single-bead perturbation moves. Specifically, every simulation step, each bead in the system is sampled to move to adjacent sites in random order 50 3 of times multiplied by a factor that reflects the length of the chain. Every 100 moves (on average) a cluster of chains is randomly selected and translated or rotated, where a cluster reflects a collection of two or more chains in direct contact. This moveset provides changes to the system that reflect physical movements expected in a dynamical system, allowing us to -for equivalently sized systemscompare the apparent dynamics of assembly, as has been done previously [29][30][31][32] . We repeated the simulations presented using a range of different movesets and, while convergence varied from set-to-set, we always observed analogous results.
        </p>
        <p>All simulations were performed in a 70 x 70 x 70 lattice-site box using period boundary conditions. The results reported are averaged over the final 20% of the simulation to give average values after equivalent numbers of MC steps. The "polymer" is represented as a 61-residue polymer with either a central high-affinity binding site or not. The binder is a 2-bead species. Every simulation was run for 20 x 10 9 Monte Carlo steps, with four independent replicas. Simulations were run with 1,2,3,4 or 5 polymers and 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 400 binders.</p>
        <p>To further explore the physical basis for single-chain polymer condensates we ran additional extended simulations for 60 x 10 9 Monte Carlo with a moveset that includes the ability for clusters to move. Simulations were run using the same conditions for other simulations, with ten independent simulations for condition (Fig. S18).</p>
        <p>For simulations of homopolymeric polymers as shown in Fig. 6C,D the balance of chain-compaction and phase separation is determined in part through chain length and binder K d . In our system the polymer is largely unbound in the one-phase regime (suggesting the concentration of ligand in the one-phase space is below the K d ) but entirely coated in the two-phase regime, consistent with highly-cooperative binding behavior. In the limit of long, multivalent polymers with multivalent binders, the sharpness of the coil-to-globule transition is such that an effective two-state description of the chain emerges, in which the chain is either expanded (non-phase separation-competent) OR compact (coated with binders, phase separation competent).</p>
        <p>An alternative framework for understanding our simulations of single-polymer condensates comes from the idea of two distinct concentration (phase) boundaries -one for binder:high affinity site interaction (c 1 ), and a second boundary for "nonspecific" binder:polymer interactions (c 2 ) at a higher concentration. c 2 reflects the boundary observed in Fig. 6C that delineated the one and two-phase regimes. At global concentrations below c 2 , (but above c 1 ) the clustering of binders at a high affinity site raises the apparent local concentration of binders above c 2 , from the perspective of other beads on the chain. In this way, a local high affinity binding site can drive "local" phase separation of a single polymer. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the His 9 -SARS-CoV2 Nucleocapsid pGEX vector to create the N protein constructs (Table S1). All cloning and site-directed mutagenesis steps were performed by Genewiz and sequences were verified using sanger sequencing.</p>
        <p>Both GST-His 9 -SARS-CoV2 NTD FL and LINK FL Nucleocapsid variants were expressed recombinantly in BL21 Codon-plus pRIL cells (Agilent). 4L cultures were grown in LB medium containing carbenicillin (100 ug/mL) to OD 600 ~0.6 and induced with 0.2 mM IPTG for 12 hours at 16ºC. Harvested cells were lysed with sonication at 4ºC in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mg/mL lysozyme, 5 mM BME, cOmplete™ EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), DNAse I (NEB), RNAse H (NEB)). The supernatant was cleared by centrifugation (140,000 x g for 1 hr) and bound to an HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare) in buffer A (50 mM Tris pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mM imidazole, 5 mM BME).</p>
        <p>GST-His 9 -N protein fusion was eluted with buffer B (buffer A + 500 mM imidazole) and dialyzed into cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 50 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT) with HRV 3C protease, thus cleaving the GST-His 9 -N fusion yielding FL N protein with two additional N-term residues (GlyPro). FL N protein was then bound to an SP sepharose FF column (GE Healthcare) and eluted using a gradient of 0-100% buffer B (buffer A: 50 mM Tris pH 8, 50 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM BME, buffer B: buffer A + 1 M NaCl) over 100 min. Purified N protein variants were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and verified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Concentrations were determined spectroscopically in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol using an extinction coefficient = 42530 M -1 cm -1 GST-His 9 -SARS-CoV2 wild-type, RBD-FL, LINK-ΔDimer, NTD-RBD, and CTD-FL Nucleocapsid variants were expressed recombinantly in Gold BL21(DE3) cells (Agilent). 4 L cultures were grown in LB medium with carbenicillin (100 ug/mL) to OD 600 ~0.6 and induced with 0.2 mM IPTG for 3 hours at 37ºC. Harvested cells were lysed with sonication at 4ºC in lysis buffer (listed above). The supernatant was cleared by centrifugation (140,000 x g for 1 hr) and the pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Tris pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 6 M Urea, 5 mM BME and incubated at 4ºC for one hour. The resuspension was cleared by centrifugation (140,000 x g for 1 hr) and the GST-His 9 -N protein in the supernatant was bound to a FF HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) in buffer A (50 mM Tris pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mM imidazole, 5 mM BME) containing 6 M Urea. The column was then washed with buffer A allowing the protein to refold on the column. The GST-His 9 -N protein fusion was then eluted with buffer B (buffer A containing 500 mM imidazole) and dialyzed into cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris pH8, 50 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT) containing HRV 3C protease. FL N protein was then bound to an SP sepharose FF column (GE Healthcare) and eluted using a gradient of 0-100% buffer B (buffer A: 50 mM Tris pH 8, 50 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM BME, buffer B: buffer A + 1 M NaCl) over 100 min. Purified N protein variants were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and/or verified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Protein concentrations of stock solutions were determined spectroscopically in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 200-500 mMNaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol using extinction coefficients of 42530 M -1 cm -1 (FL) , 26400M -1 cm -1 (LINK-ΔDimer), and 25200M -1 cm -1 (NTD-RBD).</p>
        <p>GST-His9-SARS-CoV2 CTD Nucleocapsid was expressed recombinantly in Gold BL21(DE3) cells (Agilent). 4 L cultures were grown in LB medium with carbenicillin (100 ug/mL) to OD600 0.6 and induced with 0. NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM BME, buffer B: buffer A + 1 M NaCl) over 100 min. Purified N protein was analyzed using SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations of stock solutions were determined spectroscopically in 50 mM MES (pH 6.0), 300 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol using an extinction coefficient = 120M -1 cm -1</p>
        <p>The choice of the labeling positions has been obtained as a compromise between flanking the regions of interest and a series of different criteria that regards the biophysics of disordered proteins, the structural properties of the protein, and the physicochemical properties of the fluorophores. In particular, we have attempted to obtain an optimal spacing of the fluorophores to ensure we could make use of the whole FRET dynamic range. A separation between 60 to 70 amino acids is expected to provide a transfer efficiency of about 0.5 for a disordered region with scaling exponent close to 0.5 and 0.8-0.9 for a folded or collapsed state with a scaling exponent of 0.33 33 . We have attempted to avoid altering amino acids that are clearly involved in structurally relevant interactions based on inspection of known structures of the folded domains.</p>
        <p>When looking for labeling positions in a folded domain, we have aimed for surface exposed residues to maximize the accessibility of the cysteine residues during labeling. We have avoided placing fluorophores adjacent to charged residues to avoid possible interactions with the charges of the fluorophores. Finally, we have attempted to limit the effects of quenching between fluorophores and aromatic residues 34,35 . Regarding this point, tryptophan residues have been identified as major quenchers of Alexa 488 and 594 and a spacing of twenty or more residues would be optimal 34,35 . Following these criteria, we have preferred not to label the NTD construct in position 50 due to the close proximity with a tryptophan residue and opted for a residue within the structured RBD. Similarly, we have opted to insert the labels within the LINKER such that mutations were not altering the net charge of the LINK sequence. Finally, for the CTD we have opted for spacing the labeling position far apart from the tryptophan residue within the folded dimerization domain, though this may not have been sufficient based on the ns-FCS observations of the CTD-FL.</p>
        <p>All Nucleocapsid variants were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 maleimide (Molecular Probes) under denaturing conditions in buffer A (50 mM Tris pH8, 50 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 6M Urea, 1 mM DTT) at a dye/protein molar ratio of 0.7/1 for 2 hrs at room temperature. Single labeled protein was isolated via ion-exchange chromatography (Mono S 5/50 GL, GE Healthcareprotein bound in buffer A and eluted with 0-100% buffer B (buffer A + 1 M NaCl) gradient over 100 min) and UV-Vis spectroscopic analysis to identify fractions with 1:1 dye:protein labeling.</p>
        <p>Single labeled Alexa Fluor 488 maleimide labeled N protein was then subsequently labeled with Alexa Fluor 594 maleimide at a dye/protein molar ratio of 1.3/1 for 2 hrs at room temperature.</p>
        <p>Double labeled (488:594) protein was then further purified via ion-exchange chromatography (Mono S 5/50 GL, GE Healthcare -see above).</p>
        <p>Single-molecule fluorescence measurements were performed with a Picoquant MT200 instrument (Picoquant, Germany). FRET experiments were performed by exciting the donor dye with a laser power of 100 μW (measured at the back aperture of the objective). For pulsed interleaved excitation experiments, the power used for exciting the acceptor dye was adjusted to match a total emission intensity after acceptor excitation to the one observed upon donor excitation (between 50 and 70 mW).</p>
        <p>Single-molecule FRET efficiency histograms were acquired from samples with protein concentrations between 50 pM and 100 pM. Trigger times for excitation pulses (repetition rate 20 MHz) and photon detection events were stored with 16 ps resolution.</p>
        <p>For fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) experiments, acceptor-donor labeled samples with a concentration of 100 pM were excited by either the 485 nm diode laser or the supercontinuum laser at the powers indicated above. However, in the experiments on protein oligomerization, due to an increase in the fluorescence background upon addition of unlabeled protein above 1 µM, only the correlations corresponding to direct acceptor excitation (582 nm)</p>
        <p>have been considered reliable for the analysis.</p>
        <p>For nsFCS, FRET samples of acceptor-donor labeled protein with a concentration of approximately 100 pM were excited by the same diode laser but in continuum wavelength mode.</p>
        <p>All measurements were performed in 50 mM Tris pH 7.32, 143 mM β-mercaptoethanol (for photoprotection), 0.001% Tween 20 (for surface passivation) and GdmCl at the reported concentrations. A residual concentration of 0.05-0.06 M GdmCl is present from dilution of the protein from the stock denatured sample. All measurements were performed in uncoated polymer coverslip cuvettes (Ibidi, Wisconsin, USA) and custom-made glass cuvette coated with PEG (see PEGylation section below). Both materials outperform normal glass cuvette and contribute to reduced sticking of the protein to the surface. At low salt we observed improved protection from sticking when using the PEG coated cuvette.</p>
        <p>Each sample was measured for at least 30 min at room temperature (295 ± 0.5 K).</p>
        <p>Glass cuvettes were assembled using 8 mm glass cloning cylinders (Hilgenberg) and 25mm circular coverslips (Deckglaser) glued together with optical adhesive 61 (Norland). Then, glass cuvettes were washed with 2% Contrad, rinsed with double distilled water, dried, and immediately filled with 100% methanol (Sigma-Aldrich). Methanol was replaced with an amino-modifying solution (methanol, acetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), amino silane (UCT Specialties LLC)) and the solution was incubated for 10 min, followed by a one-minute sonication. After sonication, the solution was incubated for further 10 minutes and then rinsed with 100% methanol followed by a second wash with double distilled water and dried. Immediately after, the cuvettes were filled with a solution containing PEG (0.1M sodium bicarbonate(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), mPEG-SVA (Laysan Bio)). Cuvettes were placed in a glass petri dish, covered, and stored in a dark humid environment at 4C overnight. The following morning the cuvettes were rinsed well with double distilled water, dried, vacuum sealed, and stored at -20C.</p>
        <p>Fluorescence bursts from individual molecules were identified by time-binning photons in bins of 1 ms and retaining the burst if the total number of photons detected after donor excitation was larger than at least 20. The exact threshold was selected based on the background contribution identified in the photon counting histograms with 1 ms binning. Transfer efficiencies for each burst were calculated according to E=nA/(nA+nD), where nD and nA are the numbers of donor and acceptor photons, respectively. Corrections for background, acceptor direct excitation, channel crosstalk, differences in detector efficiencies, and quantum yields of the dyes were applied 37 . The labeling stoichiometry ratio was computed accordingly to 𝑆 where and represents the total intensities observed after donor and</p>
        <p>acceptor excitation and provides a correction factor to account for differences in the γ 𝑃𝐼𝐸 detection efficiency and laser intensities. Bursts with stoichiometry corresponding to 1:1 donor:acceptor labeling (in contrast to donor and acceptor only populations) were selected and finally from the selected bursts a histogram of transfer efficiencies is constructed. Variations in the selection criteria for the stoichiometry ratio do not impact significantly the observed mean transfer efficiency (within experimental errors).</p>
        <p>To estimate the mean transfer efficiency and deconvolve multiple populations (e.g for the NTD construct) from the transfer efficiency histograms, each population was approximated with a Gaussian peak function. For fitting more than one peak, the histogram was analyzed with a sum of Gaussian peak functions. Under these assumptions the mean transfer efficiency is computed as an average quantity across hundreds of independent molecules freely diffusing in the confocal volume. For the conversion of transfer efficiency to distances, we used the value of the Förster radius for Alexa488 and Alexa594 previously determined and reported in literature, R 0 = 5.4 nm 38 . We further correct the value accounting for the dependence of the Förster radius on the solution refractive index. To this end, we quantified the change in refractive index for each sample, which enables us to strongly reduce the source of error due to possible pipetting mistakes and properly determined concentrations of denaturant and salt. The changes in refractive index caused by increasing concentrations of GdmCl or KCl were measured with an Abbe refractometer (Bausch &amp; Lomb, USA).</p>
        <p>We estimated a systematic error on transfer efficiency of ± 0.03, based on the variation of transfer efficiency of the same reference samples after different calibrations of the instrument over the last two years, a number in line with previously reported systematic errors for analogous instrumentation and calibration 34,39 . Standard deviation of the transfer efficiency for multiple replicates of the same experimental conditions commonly results in a standard deviation equal or less than ± 0.01. Since we aim for a comparison with simulations, here we consider the systematic error as the largest source of error and we propagate the corresponding effect on all the calculated distances.</p>
        <p>Each point in the denaturant titration is obtained from independently prepared samples.</p>
        <p>Reproducibility of the mean transfer efficiency results have been confirmed by independent replicates of measurements in aqueous buffer and at various concentrations of the denaturation curve. For the NTD FL construct, we performed two independent sample preparation and measurements for 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 2.3, 4.5, and 6 M GdmCl as well as 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 M Urea. The corresponding standard deviation for each of the measurements is equal to or smaller than 0.01. For the NTD-RBD, we have performed duplicates at 0 and 6 M GdmCl (with standard deviation equal or less than 0.01) and we have found a remarkable agreement of the measured transfer efficiencies across all denaturant concentrations with the NTD-FL. For the LINK-FL, reproducibility has been confirmed by 2 independent replicates at 0, 1, 2, 4 M GdmCl as well as 50 and 150 mM KCl. Standard deviation of independent replicates is less than 0.01.</p>
        <p>Measurements of coexistent populations below 0.15 M GdmCl provides a further indication of the small deviations across independent measurements reporting about the same distance distribution. Reproducibility of experimental is further corroborated by overlapping of data points with the independent preparation measuring the LINK-ΔDimer construct in high denaturant where both constructs converge to equal transfer efficiencies. Regarding the LINK-ΔDimer construct, besides the overlap of transfer efficiencies in high denaturant, we additionally performed duplicates at 0, 0.5, 0.75 M GdmCl and at 1, 2, 3, 4 M Urea. For the CTD FL, we tested reproducibility by performing duplicates at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, and 6 M GdmCl, as well as at 300 and 500 mM KCl. While all these measurements results in a standard deviation equal or smaller than 0.01, repeated measurements in aqueous buffer (4 measurements) and in 1 and 2 M Urea (2 measurements each) revealed larger standard deviations comparable or smaller than 0.03. We attribute these observations to the specificity of the CTD (and possibly DIMER domain) and its larger propensity to interact with the surface. This effect is not observed at higher GdmCl or salt concentrations that 0.15 M, but seems to persist in Urea, suggesting a possible contribution of electrostatic interactions. Finally, we confirmed reproducibility of the results for the CTD fragment by performing independent duplicates of 1, 1.5, 2, 2.75 M GdmCl as well as 4 independent measurements of the sample in aqueous buffer. Each set of measurements report a standard deviation less than 0.01, suggesting that the peculiarity of the CTD FL sample is connected to the presence of the DIMER domain. Reproducibility is further corroborated by the overlapping of data points with the measurement of the CTD FL. Overall, testing reproducibility of the samples across multiple experimental conditions revealed deviations not exceeding the systematic error that is intrinsic to the instrument calibrations.</p>
        <p>A quantitative interpretation of this transfer efficiency in terms of distance distribution requires the investigation of protein dynamics. A first method to assess whether the transfer efficiency reports about a rigid distance (e.g. structure formation or persistent interaction with the RBD) or is the result of a dynamic average across multiple conformations is the comparison of transfer efficiency and fluorescence lifetime.The interdependence of these two factors is expected to be linear if the protein conformations are identical on both timescales (nanoseconds as detected by the fluorescence lifetime, milliseconds as computed from the number of photons in each burst).</p>
        <p>Alternatively, protein dynamics give rise to a departure from the linear relation and an analytical limit can be computed for configurations rearranging much faster than the burst duration (see SI). The dependence of the fluorescence lifetimes on transfer efficiencies determined for each burst was compared with the behavior expected for fixed distances and for a chain sampling a broad distribution of distances. For a fixed distance, R, the mean donor lifetime in the presence of acceptor is given by , where is the lifetime in the absence of 𝑡 Multiparameter detection allows also excluding possible artifacts, such as insufficient rotational averaging of the fluorophores or quenching of the dyes. Subpopulation-specific anisotropies were determined for both donor and acceptor of all three constructs for NTD, LINK, and CTD, and values were found to vary between 0.1 and 0.2 for the donor and between 0.1 and 0.2 for the acceptor, sufficiently low to assume as a good approximation for the orientational factor κ 2 = 2/3.</p>
        <p>In order to determine changes in the hydrodynamic radius (R h ) of the protein, FCS correlations were analyzed assuming 3D diffusion of the molecule across a three-dimensional Gaussian profile of the confocal volume 41 . For 1 diffusing species, and in the absence of photophysical transitions in the time scale of the lag times analyzed, this formalism amounts to the following time autocorrelation function , where N is the Additionally, in order to account for contributions of the photophysics of the fluorophore to the correlation observed in the µs timescale, we added two triplet terms multiplying the diffusion correlation term (see for example work by Krichevsky 42 ). The overall equation that we fit to the</p>
        <p>Autocorrelation curves of acceptor and donor channels and cross-correlation curves between acceptor and donor channels were calculated with the methods described previously 43,44 . All samples have been measured at a concentration of 100 pM and bursts with a transfer efficiency between 0.3 and 0.8 have been selected to eliminate the contribution of donor only to the correlation amplitude. Finally, the correlation was computed over a time window of 5 μs and characteristics timescales were extracted according to:</p>
        <p>where N is the mean number of molecules in the confocal volume and and indicate the type 𝑖 𝑗 of signal (either from the Acceptor or Donor channels). The three multiplicative terms describe the contribution to amplitude and timescale of photon antibunching (AB), chain dynamics (CD), and triplet blinking of the dyes (T). is then converted in the reconfiguration time of the τ 𝐶𝐷 interdye distance correcting for the filtering effect of FRET as described previously 45 . An τ 𝑟 additional multiplicative CD term has been added only for the donor-donor correlations to describe the fast decay observed at very short time. Such a decay is not found in the correlations of other disordered proteins measured on the instrument and we associate the fast decay with the rotational motion of the overall protein. A fit to this fast decay is about 2 ns. To test reproducibility, we perform multiple independent measurements: 3 for the NTD-FL, 4 for the LINK-FL, and 6 for the CTD-FL.</p>
        <p>Conversion of mean transfer efficiencies for fast rearranging ensembles requires the assumption of a distribution of distances. Here, we compared the results of two distinct polymer models: the Gaussian model and a Self-Avoiding Walk (SAW) model that accounts for changes in the excluded volume 46 . This second model has been shown to provide a better description of chain distribution and scaling exponent when compared to distance distributions from MD simulations 47 . Importantly, both models rely only on one single fitting parameter, the root mean square interdye distance for the Gaussian chain and the scaling exponent 𝝂 for the 𝑟 = ⟨𝑅</p>
        <p>The Gaussian chain distribution is given by: Eq. S4 𝑃 𝐹𝐽𝐶 (𝑅, 𝑟) = 4π𝑅</p>
        <p>Gamma Function, b 0 = 0.55 nm is an empirical prefactor 47 , N is the number of residues between the fluorophores, and 𝝂 is the scaling exponent.</p>
        <p>Finally, when converting the distance from transfer efficiencies, to account for the length of dye linkers and compare the experimental data with simulations, the root-mean-squared interdye distance r was rescaled according to r m,n = |m-n| 0.5 / dye |m-n+2 / dye | 0.5 with / dye = 4.5 39,48 . Finally, the persistence length is computed using the Gaussian conversion As in previous works [50][51][52] , we model the chain expansion with the denaturant in terms of a simple binding model:</p>
        <p>Where is the mean square interdye distance at zero denaturant, is a term the captures the 𝑟 Folding of RBD Domain.</p>
        <p>While characterizing the NTD denaturant dependence, we discovered a plateau at transfer efficiencies between 1 and 2 M GdmCl, which we interpret as the contribution of the coexistence of folding and unfolding conformations (Eq. S7). To test whether this corresponds to the actual range of the folding transition, we designed, expressed, and labeled a construct with dyes in position 68 and 172, which directly monitors the folding of this domain. Single-molecule FRET measurements reveal up to three distinct populations (Fig. S6). One is abundant at high GdmCl concentration and disappears at low GdmCl concentrations and therefore we assign it as an unfolded state. Another one is only transiently populated between 1 and 2 M GdmCl and we assign it as an intermediate folding state. A third one, with a higher transfer efficiency compatible with the distance expected from the known RBD structure, is stabilized below 2 M GdmCl and, therefore, is assigned as the folded configuration. In absence of evident differences in brightness between these three species, the relative area of each state represents the fraction of the corresponding population. We use a three-state model where the fraction of each state can be computed from the partition function of the system, leading to: Eq. S10</p>
        <p>Fitted values to the model are reported in Table S2. Importantly, the observed values confirm in large measure the inferred stability measured via the NTD. The small discrepancy in the overall stability observed (Fig. S9) can either be assigned to the complicated decoupling of folding and chain expansion when observing the transition from the perspective of the NTD or by the "local" nature of the RBD unfolding probed by the NTD.</p>
        <p>In addition to studying the conformations under native buffer conditions, we investigate how salt affects the conformations of the three disordered regions. We started by testing the effects of electrostatic interactions on the NTD conformational ensemble. Moving from buffer conditions and increasing concentration of KCl, we observed a small but noticeable shift toward lower transfer efficiencies, which represents an expansion of the NTD due to screening of electrostatic interactions. This can be rationalized in terms of the polyampholyte theory of Higgs and Joanny 50,53 (see Table S3), where the increasing concentration of ions screens the interaction between oppositely charged residues (see Fig. S11).</p>
        <p>We then analyzed for comparison the LINK FL construct. Interestingly, we find a negligible effect of salt screening on the root mean square distance of the low transfer efficiency population as measured by FRET (see Fig. S11). Predictions of the Higgs &amp; Joanny theory (see SI) for the content of negative and positive charges within the LINK construct indicates a variation of interdye distance dimension that is comparable with the measurement error. It has to be noted that in this case the excluded volume term in the Higgs and Joanny theory will empirically account not only for the excluded volume of the amino acids in the chain, but also for the excluded volume occupied by the two folded domains.</p>
        <p>To better understand the weak dependence on salt (and denaturant) of the dimensions LINK FL and the occurrence of two populations at low salt screening, we further investigated a truncated version of the same protein, the LINK-ΔDimer construct. First of all, we observe a sharp collapse as a function of GdmCl (Fig. S8), which starkly contrasts with the weak change of the LINK-FL. This strongly implies an effect of the two domains in modulating the dimensions of the LINK. We then asked whether such modulation in a low denaturant regime contains a strong electrostatic component. To separate the effect of structural destabilization and electrostatic attraction in disordered proteins, we chose to use Urea. When comparing the conformation in the two denaturants, we clearly observed that Urea maintains the LINK-ΔDimer in a more compact configuration and by addition of 0.5 M KCl we can recover the expansion observed in GdmCl (Fig. S10). For comparison no change is observed when studying the NTD FL under the same conditions (Fig. S10). These observations for the LINK-ΔDimer mimic what was previously observed in the case of the Cold Shock Protein from Thermotoga Maritima 50 and confirms a strong electrostatic contribution in controlling the dimensions of the LINK region in absence of DIMER and CTD domains. It is reasonable to assume that similar electrostatic interactions are at play also in the full-length protein and are at the origin of the coexistence of two populations in low ionic strength solutions.</p>
        <p>Finally, we test if the addition of salt can provide similar effects than those obtained by GdmCl on the conformations of the CTD: interestingly, we do not observe any significant variation either in transfer efficiency (Fig. S11), suggesting that the broadening of the population observed for the CTD does not originate exclusively from electrostatic interactions. However, when comparing the denaturing effect of GdmCl and Urea on the CTD-FL we observe more compact conformations of the chain in GdmCl.</p>

        <p>NativePAGE experiments were performed to verify that purified recombinantly expressed SARS-CoV-2 N protein is capable of forming dimers and oligomers, in analogy to SARS-CoV N protein, and as shown in more recent work for SARS-CoV-2 13,54,55 . Indeed, NativePAGE experiments reveal the existence of multiple bands (Fig. S14 C-D). However, since the lowest band in the NativePAGE corresponds to an apparent molecular weight of ~70-80 kDa, we wanted to verify the oligomeric state of this band.</p>
        <p>To test whether the apparent mass is due to a slow mobility of the protein because of its high positive charge, we performed crosslinking experiments. These experiments confirm the formation of dimers, tetramers, and high oligomeric species, as a function of protein concentration above 500 nM (Fig. S14 E-F We finally turned to Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) to test whether labeled protein can form dimers. We measured the CTD construct that carries one labeling position at the end of the oligomerization domain. When increasing the concentration of unlabeled protein, we observe a systematic increase in the hydrodynamic radius when compared to the hydrodynamic radius under native conditions (Fig S14 A-B). This suggests that the labeled protein can form higher oligomeric species in a concentration regime comparable to the one</p>

S12 γ(𝑥) = Supporting Tables structural context, and report substantially larger average distances than the ABSINTH simulations, as expected given the absence of any attractive intramolecular interactions. The distances reported from the EV simulations are also slightly more expanded than under fully denatured conditions, consistent with systems studied previously (see previous work 7,59 ). Our simulations in Fig. 6 reveal single-polymer condensates in the presence of a high-affinity binding site, whereas multi-chain droplets assemble in the absence of a high-affinity binding site. To further explore the origin of single-polymer condensates we ran extensive Monte Carlo simulations using an approximate kinetics scheme (that includes cluster translation moves) to examine the pseudo-kinetics of assembly. Black lines in each panel correspond to individual simulation trajectories, while red lines report on the average behavior over ten independent simulations. n reflects the number of binder chains in each simulation, and for each 5 separate polymers are present. To assess the apparent kinetics of assembly, we asked what fraction of the total number of polymers are found in the largest cluster. Under conditions in which a single droplet forms 100% of the polymer chains will be found in the largest cluster. Panels a,b,c,d,e report on behavior for polymers without a high affinity binding site. In all cases within 10 9 Monte Carlo steps every independent simulation has converged on a single multichain droplet that represents the thermodynamic minimum expected for a two-phase equilibrium. Panels f,g,h,i,j report on identical simulations performed with a single high affinity binding site. While these simulations trend towards or reach a single multichain condensate, the presence of a high-affinity binding site substantially retards the assembly kinetics, revealing a large regime over which single-polymer condensates are metastable. 60 . This analysis correctly identifies helices H4, H5 and H6, but fails to identify those H1, H2 and H3. Helix H3, H4 and H6 have been similarly identified by NMR and/or hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectroscopy 16,61,62 . These results demonstrate that our simulations are able to identify predicted helices but, furthermore, find helices that conventional structural bioinformatics software fails to correctly identify.</p>
