        <p>In the current model of mitochondrial trafficking, Miro1 and Miro2 Rho-GTPases regulate mitochondrial transport along microtubules by linking mitochondria to kinesin and dynein motors. By generating Miro1/2 double-knockout mouse embryos and single-and double-knockout embryonic fibroblasts, we demonstrate the essential and non-redundant roles of Miro proteins for embryonic development and subcellular mitochondrial distribution. Unexpectedly, the TRAK1 and TRAK2 motor protein adaptors can still localise to the outer mitochondrial membrane to drive anterograde mitochondrial motility in Miro1/2 double-knockout cells. In contrast, we show that TRAK2-mediated retrograde mitochondrial transport is Miro1-dependent. Interestingly, we find that Miro is critical for recruiting and stabilising the mitochondrial myosin Myo19 on the mitochondria for coupling mitochondria to the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, Miro depletion during PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy can also drive a loss of mitochondrial Myo19 upon mitochondrial damage. Finally, aberrant positioning of mitochondria in Miro1/2 double-knockout cells leads to disruption of correct mitochondrial segregation during mitosis. Thus, Miro proteins can fine-tune actin-and tubulin-dependent mitochondrial motility and positioning, to regulate key cellular functions such as cell proliferation.In the current model of mitochondrial trafficking, Miro1 and Miro2 Rho-GTPases regulate mitochondrial transport along microtubules by linking mitochondria to kinesin and dynein motors.

        <p>Mitochondria are critical for ATP provision and play other essential roles in cells such as buffering calcium and lipid synthesis (MacAskill &amp; Kittler, 2010;Sheng &amp; Cai, 2012;Mishra &amp; Chan, 2014). The tight regulation of mitochondrial transport and distribution is therefore crucial as it enables mitochondria to be delivered and localised to areas where they are needed. In order for mitochondria to move around the cell, they need to be coupled to motor proteins. Long-range mitochondrial transport is primarily mediated by the coupling of mitochondria to microtubule motors (kinesins and dynein), whereas the actin cytoskeleton and its associated myosin motors, notably , can mediate shorterrange mitochondrial movement and actin-dependent mitochondrial anchoring (Morris &amp; Hollenbeck, 1995;Chada &amp; Hollenbeck, 2003;Hirokawa &amp; Takemura, 2005;Quintero et al, 2009). However, the regulatory overlap between the pathways of microtubule-and actindependent mitochondrial trafficking and positioning and its impact on key cellular functions remain poorly understood.Mitochondria are critical for ATP provision and play other essential roles in cells such as buffering calcium and lipid synthesis (MacAskill &amp; Kittler, 2010;Sheng &amp; Cai, 2012;Mishra &amp; Chan, 2014).

        <p>The outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) Miro (mitochondrial Rho) GTPases and the TRAK motor adaptors have emerged as key regulators of mitochondrial trafficking and distribution by coupling mitochondria to the kinesin-and dynein-dependent microtubule transport pathways (Stowers et al, 2002;Fransson et al, 2006;Birsa et al, 2013;van Spronsen et al, 2013). Miro proteins have a C-terminal transmembrane domain for OMM targeting and two GTPase domains flanking two Ca 2+ -sensing EF-hand domains (Birsa et al, 2013;Devine et al, 2016). The prevailing model proposes that Miro proteins regulate trafficking by acting as the essential receptors for mitochondrial recruitment of the TRAK adaptors to drive kinesinand dynein-mediated movements (MacAskill &amp; Kittler, 2010;Saxton &amp; Hollenbeck, 2012;Schwarz, 2013;Maeder et al, 2014;Mishra &amp; Chan, 2014;Sheng, 2014). Miro proteins are also important targets of Parkinson's disease associated mitophagy pathway, driven by the kinase PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1) and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, which work together to degrade damaged mitochondria (Youle &amp; Narendra, 2011;Covill-Cooke et al, 2017). Upon mitochondrial damage, Miro is rapidly ubiquitinated and depleted to block the microtubule-dependent transport of damaged mitochondria (Wang et al, 2011;Birsa et al, 2014). In mammals, two Miro family members exist, Miro1 and Miro2, with 60% sequence similarity, but little is known regarding their specific roles in regulating mitochondrial dynamics. Moreover, whether Miro proteins are additionally involved in coordinating myosin motors and actindependent positioning of healthy or damaged mitochondria remains unclear.The outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) Miro (mitochondrial Rho) GTPases and the TRAK motor adaptors have emerged as key regulators of mitochondrial trafficking and distribution by coupling mitochondria to the kinesin-and dynein-dependent microtubule transport pathways (Stowers et al, 2002;Fransson et al, 2006;Birsa et al, 2013;van Spronsen et al, 2013).

        <p>Correct mitochondrial positioning within cells has emerged as critical for many key cellular processes including cell division, migration, signalling and survival (Youle &amp; van der Bliek, 2012;Mishra &amp; Chan, 2014;Morlino et al, 2014). The symmetric partitioning of mitochondria through both actin-and microtubule-dependent processes has recently been shown to be important for cell division (Rohn et al, 2014;Chung et al, 2016). Through the microtubule binding protein CENPF, Miro1 can promote mitochondrial redistribution following cell division (Kanfer et al, 2015). However, the role of Miro proteins for symmetric partitioning of mitochondria to daughter cells remains unclear.Correct mitochondrial positioning within cells has emerged as critical for many key cellular processes including cell division, migration, signalling and survival (Youle &amp; van der Bliek, 2012;Mishra &amp; Chan, 2014;Morlino et al, 2014).

        <p>Here, we use mouse knockout (KO) approaches to generate Miro KO embryos and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) for Miro1, Miro2 or both proteins, allowing a detailed characterisation of their roles in regulating mitochondrial trafficking and motor adaptor recruitment. Using micropatterned substrates to normalise cell size, we dissect the different roles of Miro1 and Miro2 in mediating mitochondrial distribution. Unexpectedly, we find TRAK proteins can still localise to mitochondria in the complete absence of Miro, while Myo19 is critically dependent on Miro for its stability on the OMM. In addition, loss of both Miro proteins in Miro double-knockout (Miro DKO ) cells leads to defects in mitosis and mitochondrial segregation to daughter cells. Our work supports a revised model for Miro function in regulating both microtubuleand actin-dependent mitochondrial positioning to regulate key cellular functions.Here, we use mouse knockout (KO) approaches to generate Miro KO embryos and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) for Miro1, Miro2 or both proteins, allowing a detailed characterisation of their roles in regulating mitochondrial trafficking and motor adaptor recruitment.

        <p>We recently showed that Miro1 knockout (Miro1 KO ) animals die perinatally while Miro2 knockout (Miro2 KO ) animals were found to develop normally (Fig EV1A) and be viable until adulthood (Lopez-Domenech et al, 2016). Due to the high homology between Miro1 and Miro2 (Fransson et al, 2003), it is conceivable that both proteins show some degree of compensation, and thus, we wanted to investigate the consequences of deleting both Miro proteins on embryonic development. To this end, we crossed animals that were heterozygous for both genes (Miro1 +/À ; Miro2 +/À × Miro1 +/À ; Miro2 +/À ) and analysed the litters at different stages (Table EV1). We observed that embryos harbouring only one copy of Miro2 (Miro1 KO /Miro2 het ) were present until P0 but were not viable beyond this stage (Table EV1), like Miro1 KO animals (Nguyen et al, 2014;Lopez-Domenech et al, 2016). In contrast, embryos with only one allele of Miro1 (Miro1 het /Miro2 KO ) were only found to be viable until E12.5, indicating that only one copy of Miro1 is not enough to compensate the lack of Miro2 beyond E12.5 . Importantly, Miro DKO embryos were only found up to embryonic stage 10.5 (E10.5) and presented reduced size and developmental defects such as uncompleted neural tube closure (Fig 1D). Interestingly, yolk sac capillaries were absent, suggesting that the development of Miro DKO embryos stopped at a stage prior to vascularisation (Fig 1E). Indeed, Miro DKO embryos at an earlier stage (E8.5) were indistinguishable from their littermates (Table EV1).We recently showed that Miro1 knockout (Miro1 KO ) animals die perinatally while Miro2 knockout (Miro2 KO ) animals were found to develop normally (Fig EV1A) and be viable until adulthood (Lopez-Domenech et al, 2016).

        <p>Thus, Miro1 function seems to be critical in late development, probably allowing the inflation of the lungs in neonates, a function that cannot be compensated by Miro2 (Nguyen et al, 2014;Lopez-Domenech et al, 2016). Conversely, two copies of Miro1 are necessary to overcome early stages of development by compensating a function of Miro2 that seems critical at early stages, around E12.5 (Fig 1A -C). Consistent with this view, we observed an increase in Miro1 protein levels in Miro2 KO embryos at E10.5, suggesting that high levels of Miro1 protein may compensate the lack of Miro2 at this stage (Figs 1F and EV1B). Interestingly, no compensatory mechanisms seem to be in place at a later time point (E12.5) where Miro1 and Miro2 protein levels closely correlate with genetic dose (Figs 1G and EV1C).Thus, Miro1 function seems to be critical in late development, probably allowing the inflation of the lungs in neonates, a function that cannot be compensated by Miro2 (Nguyen et al, 2014;Lopez-Domenech et al, 2016).

        <p>To study the specific roles of Miro1 and Miro2 for mitochondrial morphology and distribution, we generated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines from E8.5 embryos of all the different genetic outcomes of Miro1 +/À ; Miro2 +/À × Miro1 +/À ; Miro2 +/À crosses. The genotype of the different cell lines (confirmed by PCR amplification; Fig EV2A) correlated with the protein levels of Miro1 and Miro2 (Fig EV2B). No major change in protein content was observed across these cell lines in Western blots against actin, btubulin, the mitochondrial markers Tom20 or COX IV or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker protein disulphide isomerase (PDI;Fig EV2B). To determine the impact on mitochondrial morphology of Miro1, Miro2 or Miro1/2 deletion, we imaged MitoTrackerlabelled mitochondria in the different cell lines. We observed that Miro1 KO and Miro2 KO cells showed indistinguishable mitochondrial morphologies from those found in WT cells, whereas Miro DKO cells showed an increase in the fraction of cells with short and rounded mitochondria and a decrease in the fraction of cells with long, tubular and interconnected mitochondria (Fig 2A and B). Despite an impact on mitochondrial morphology, the maximal respiratory capacity of the electron transfer system (ETS), the normalised respiration flux (R/E) and the maximum capacity of complex IV (C-IV) were not significantly different among all genotypes either using glucose as a substrate (Fig EV2C) or with a non-glycolytic substrate (Fig EV2D), suggesting that Miro proteins are not critical in regulating respiration rate or overall energetic metabolic state of the cell.To study the specific roles of Miro1 and Miro2 for mitochondrial morphology and distribution, we generated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines from E8.5 embryos of all the different genetic outcomes of Miro1 +/À ; Miro2 +/À × Miro1 +/À ; Miro2 +/À crosses.

        <p>We noted that mitochondria in Miro1 KO cells were accumulated near the nucleus and seemed unable to reach distal regions when compared to their WT controls in accordance with previous reports (Nguyen et al, 2014), an effect that was greatly accentuated in Miro DKO cells. To determine mitochondrial distribution in the different MEF lines with high accuracy, we controlled cell size and shape using printed micropattern adhesive cell substrates (see Materials and Methods;Fig EV3A). This allows quantification of cellular parameters over many cells with an identical size and shape, greatly reducing the large inherent variability of MEF cell morphology and, hence, mitochondrial distribution (Chevrollier et al, 2012;Fig 2C)We noted that mitochondria in Miro1 KO cells were accumulated near the nucleus and seemed unable to reach distal regions when compared to their WT controls in accordance with previous reports (Nguyen et al, 2014), an effect that was greatly accentuated in Miro DKO cells.

        <p>Miro1 is a key regulator of mitochondrial trafficking in neurons (Macaskill et al, 2009;Wang &amp; Schwarz, 2009;Lopez-Domenech et al, 2016) and other cell types (Saotome et al, 2008;Morlino et al, 2014;Stephen et al, 2015;Schuler et al, 2017). The prevailing model of Miro function is that it acts as the essential receptor for recruiting the motor/adaptor complexes to the mitochondria to drive mitochondrial transport along the microtubule tracks (MacAskill &amp; Kittler, 2010;Saxton &amp; Hollenbeck, 2012;Schwarz, 2013;Maeder et al, 2014;Sheng, 2014). However, whether Miro1 and Miro2 have overlapping or complementary functions and A-C Miro1 het /Miro2 KO embryos (with only one copy of Miro1) are not viable beyond day E12.5 of gestation as opposed to Miro2 KO embryos (with two copies of Miro1). At E16.5 (A) and E14.5 (B), all embryos that were identified post hoc as heterozygotes for Miro1 and knock out for Miro2 were found in advanced state of reabsorption. At E12.5 (C), half of the embryos of this genotype were found to be indistinguishable from WT control animals. A viable embryo was selected as a control animal for comparison. See also Table EV1. D, E Miro DKO embryos were found to be not viable from E10. Mitochondria in mammalian cells can move using the actin cytoskeleton for short-range displacements and the microtubule cytoskeleton for longer range movements (Morris &amp; Hollenbeck, 1995). Surprisingly, mitochondria could still often be found aligned with microtubule filaments in Miro DKO cells (Appendix Fig S1C), suggesting that association of mitochondria to microtubule tracks can occur even in the complete absence of any Miro. We quantified the number of fast tubulin-dependent mitochondrial transport events in our movies, characterised as directional displacements of mitochondria that covered at least 5 lm in distance and moved faster than 0.15 lm/s. We observed that the number of microtubule-dependent mitochondrial trafficking events was significantly reduced in Miro1 KO cells but was unaltered in Miro2 KO cells (Fig 3C). Unexpectedly, in Miro DKO cells, a small number of directed mitochondrial movements could still be detected (Fig 3C and D,and Movie EV3). They were found to be greatly decreased compared to WT cells but, interestingly, not different compared to Miro1 KO The unexpected observation that some Miro-independent transport of mitochondria along microtubules remains in Miro DKO cells prompted us to further investigate whether Miro proteins are obligate adaptors for motor protein recruitment to the mitochondrial membrane. To test this, we performed mitochondrial fractionation (Frezza et al, 2007) studies in our different cell lines followed by Western blotting with antibodies to Kinesin-1 and dynein/dynactin motor proteins and their TRAK adaptors (Fig 3E). Surprisingly, all the microtubule motors tested, the molecular adaptor TRAK1, and to a lesser extent, TRAK2, could still be found in the mitochondrial fraction (confirmed with specific mitochondrial and cytoplasmic markers) at similar levels in all the different genotypes (Fig 3F). In agreement with this, GFP-tagged versions of both TRAK1 and TRAK2 could also be found targeted to mitochondria when expressed in Miro DKO cells (Fig 3G), suggesting the presence of other TRAK acceptors on the mitochondrial membrane in Miro DKO cells. Indeed, proximity ligation assays (PLA) revealed that the interaction between TRAK1 and mitofusin1 [Mfn1; a previously reported TRAK interactor (Lee et al, 2017;Misko et al, 2010)] is preserved in Miro DKO cells, while the interaction between TRAK2 and Mfn1 appeared enhanced (Fig EV4). Thus, recruitment of TRAK1 and TRAK2 to the mitochondrial outer membrane in the absence of Miro can happen through other adaptors such as the mitofusins.Miro1 is a key regulator of mitochondrial trafficking in neurons (Macaskill et al, 2009;Wang &amp; Schwarz, 2009;Lopez-Domenech et al, 2016) and other cell types (Saotome et al, 2008;Morlino et al, 2014;Stephen et al, 2015;Schuler et al, 2017).

        <p>To further test the functionality of the TRAK/motor complexes upon loss of Miro, we used cell micropatterning techniques and mitochondrial Sholl analysis. GFP transfection had no effect on the MPM or Mito 95 values when compared with untransfected cells for either WT or Miro DKO cells (Appendix Fig S2A andB), indicating that mitochondrial distribution is not altered by transfection. In contrast, when we expressed TRAK1GFP in WT MEFs, we observed a subtle mitochondrial redistribution towards the cell periphery away from the perinuclear region with a trend towards a rightward shift in the MPM compared to untransfected cells (Fig 4A, C andE), suggesting that targeting more TRAK1 to mitochondria can enhance kinesin-mediated transport. In agreement with this, while expression of the kinesin-1 motor KIF5C alone had no effect on mitochondrial distribution (Appendix Fig S2C and D), co-expression of KIF5C with TRAK1 dramatically enhanced the redistribution of mitochondria to the cell periphery in a similar way as previously observed for TRAK2 and KIF5C in COS-7 cells (Smith et al, 2006), leading to a shift to the right in the MPM and a significant increase in the Mito 95 value (Fig 4A , C andE). Surprisingly, when we performed the same analysis in the absence of Miro proteins, we found that expression of TRAK1GFP in Miro DKO cells could still induce a significant redistribution of mitochondria towards the most distal regions of the cells, as observed by a shift to the right in the MPM and a significant increase in the Mito 95 value. This effect was further enhanced upon co-expression of TRAK1 (or TRAK2) and KIF5C (Fig 4B andF-H) while KIF5C expression alone had no effect (Appendix Fig S2C and D), confirming that expression of TRAK1/2 can recruit more KIF to the mitochondria, even in the absence of Miro proteins.To further test the functionality of the TRAK/motor complexes upon loss of Miro, we used cell micropatterning techniques and mitochondrial Sholl analysis.

        <p>Thus, in the absence of both Miro proteins, TRAK proteins can not only still be targeted to the mitochondrial membrane but are functional in terms of driving kinesin-mediated anterograde mitochondrial transport to the cell periphery.Thus, in the absence of both Miro proteins, TRAK proteins can not only still be targeted to the mitochondrial membrane but are functional in terms of driving kinesin-mediated anterograde mitochondrial transport to the cell periphery.</p>
        <p>In contrast to what we observed for TRAK1, expression of TRAK2 alone in WT MEFs led to the accumulation of mitochondria in the perinuclear region, shown by a leftward shift in the MPM and a significant decrease in the Mito 95 value (Fig 4A , D andE). This suggests that TRAK2 expression may favour dynein-directed retrograde mitochondrial transport as previously proposed (van Spronsen et al, 2013). Unlike in WT cells, TRAK2 expression in Miro DKO cells could not drive significant retrograde redistribution of mitochondria (Fig 4B,G and H). This could be because TRAK2dependent retrograde mitochondrial transport is occluded in Miro DKO MEFs, where mitochondria are already significantly clustered perinuclearly, or because Miro proteins are permissive for dynein-dependent regulation of mitochondrial distribution, as it has been previously suggested in fly neurons (Babic et al, 2015;Melkov et al, 2016). In agreement with the latter hypothesis, the perinuclear clustering of mitochondria observed in Miro DKO cells is reminiscent of mitochondrial distribution upon dynein inhibition (Varadi et al, 2004). In addition, we noted that when expressed with KIF5C, TRAK2 was very effective at driving anterograde mitochondrial transport in Miro DKO MEFs but not in WT MEFs (Fig 4D , E, G andH), suggesting that the absence of Miro proteins may preferentially favour kinesin-dependent anterograde mitochondrial transport by TRAK2, perhaps because dynein activity is not available to oppose this.In contrast to what we observed for TRAK1, expression of TRAK2 alone in WT MEFs led to the accumulation of mitochondria in the perinuclear region, shown by a leftward shift in the MPM and a significant decrease in the Mito 95 value (Fig 4A , D andE).

        <p>To reveal potential Miro1-and Miro2-specific roles in regulating motor-dependent mitochondrial positioning, we performed a similar series of experiments in Miro1 or Miro2 knockout MEF lines. TRAK1 overexpression in either Miro1 KO or Miro2 KO cells could drive mitochondria to the cell periphery, an effect that was greatly enhanced upon co-expression of KIF5C (Fig 5A -C, E, F andH), similar to our observations in Miro DKO cells. In contrast, overexpression of TRAK2 in cells depleted of Miro1 no longer induced the perinuclear redistribution of mitochondria seen in either WT or Miro2 KO cells (Fig 5D, E, G andH) but rather had the opposite effect, moving mitochondria to the periphery. This suggests that Miro1 (but not Miro2) may facilitate TRAK2-dependent retrograde redistribution of mitochondria.To reveal potential Miro1-and Miro2-specific roles in regulating motor-dependent mitochondrial positioning, we performed a similar series of experiments in Miro1 or Miro2 knockout MEF lines.

        <p>The fact that compared to Miro1 KO , Miro DKO cells showed an enhanced disruption of mitochondrial displacement but not tubulinmediated long-range directional movements suggests that other transport mechanisms may also be altered upon loss of both Miro proteins. The actin cytoskeleton serves as a substrate to allow mitochondrial movement, docking and distribution (Morris &amp; Hollenbeck, 1995;Chada &amp; Hollenbeck, 2004). Several myosins confirming the specificity of the stabilisation of mitochondrial Myo19 levels (Fig EV5A andB). In light of the reduced levels of Myo19 in the mitochondrial fraction, we hypothesised that Miro proteins could act as receptors of Myo19 to the mitochondria, thereby protecting it from cytoplasmic degradation.The fact that compared to Miro1 KO , Miro DKO cells showed an enhanced disruption of mitochondrial displacement but not tubulinmediated long-range directional movements suggests that other transport mechanisms may also be altered upon loss of both Miro proteins.

        <p>To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed a GFP-tagged version of Myo19 (GFPMyo19) in our MEF lines. GFPMyo19 localised predominantly in the mitochondrial compartment in WT cells with only a small amount localising in the cytoplasm (Fig 6G). This localisation was altered in Miro1 KO and Miro2 KO cells which showed a clear increase in the cytoplasmic fraction of GFPMyo19 which was further enhanced in Miro DKO cells (Fig 6G). To analyse this balance, we calculated the ratio of mitochondrial versus cytoplasmic signal. As expected, the mitochondrial enrichment of GFPMyo19 localisation in WT cells was significantly decreased in Miro1 KO and Miro2 KO cell lines and even further in Miro DKO cells (Fig 6H ), supporting that both Miro proteins are implicated in the mitochondrial localisation of Myo19. As expected, co-expression of either Miro1myc or Miro2myc completely rescued the mitochondrial enrichment of GFPMyo19 in Miro DKO cells (Fig 6I and J,and EV5C). In contrast, Miro1 and Miro2 lacking the mitochondrial targeting signal (Miro1DTMmyc and Miro2DTMmyc) and which therefore localise in the cytoplasm (Fransson et al, 2006) were not able to recruit GFPMyo19 to the mitochondria of Miro DKO cells (Fig 6I andJ, and EV5C). Instead, cytoplasmic Miro1DTMmyc and Miro2DTMmyc, when co-expressed in WT cells, could recruit GFPMyo19 to the cytoplasm altering its mitochondrial localisation to levels similar to Miro DKO cells (Fig 6K and L,and EV5C). These results strongly support a role for Miro1 and Miro2 as mitochondrial receptors with the ability to recruit Myo19 to the mitochondria. In agreement with this, we found that when co-expressed in COS-7 cells, GFPMyo19 could readily co-precipitate either Miro1myc or Miro2myc, The dramatic loss of mitochondrial Myo19 upon genetic deletion of Miro suggested that Myo19 may be a highly labile protein and that Miro proteins play a critical role in Myo19 stabilisation at the mitochondria. To test this hypothesis, we performed time-course experiments using cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, to test the stability of Myo19 in the presence or absence of the E). These results indicate that the cytoplasmic pool of Myo19 is prone to degradation and suggest that when localised on the mitochondria, Myo19 is protected from degradation and thus stabilised. Furthermore, we tested the impact on Myo19 levels upon rapid Parkin-mediated Miro depletion upon mitochondrial damage. Using a SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line stably overexpressing Parkin, mitochondrial damage induced by the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP (Birsa et al, 2014) led to a dramatic decrease of Miro1 within 1 h of treatment and almost complete loss at later time points as previously reported (Wang et al, 2011;Birsa et al, 2014). Interestingly, we also noted a dramatic loss of Myo19 levels at the later time points of 3 and 6 h of FCCP treatment closely following the loss of Miro, although with apparently slower kinetics (Fig 7F and G).To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed a GFP-tagged version of Myo19 (GFPMyo19) in our MEF lines. GFPMyo19 localised predominantly in the mitochondrial compartment in WT cells with only a small amount localising in the cytoplasm (Fig 6G).

        <p>Our results support a critical role for Miro proteins as key adaptors for Myo19 mitochondrial recruitment and stabilisation to regulate Myo19 levels on the mitochondrion and moreover, demonstrate that Myo19 levels can be dynamically regulated along with Miro during mitochondrial damage.Our results support a critical role for Miro proteins as key adaptors for Myo19 mitochondrial recruitment and stabilisation to regulate Myo19 levels on the mitochondrion and moreover, demonstrate that Myo19 levels can be dynamically regulated along with Miro during mitochondrial damage.</p>
        <p>Myo19 has been proposed to regulate an equal segregation of mitochondria to daughter cells during mitosis (Rohn et al, 2014). The observation that Miro DKO cells have dramatically reduced levels of Myo19 prompted us to investigate whether mitochondrial segregation is affected by Miro deletion in our MEF lines. First, we noted that in Miro DKO MEFs mitochondrial content appeared to be more heterogeneous compared to wild-type control cells (Fig 8A). We compared the mitochondrial content per cell through a ratio of Tom20-stained area (mitochondria) to a GFP cell fill area which revealed that Miro DKO cells had a significantly higher variance in mitochondrial content in comparison with WT cells (Fig 8B; P = 0.0100, F-test). These differences in basal mitochondrial content would be in accordance with a disrupted segregation of mitochondria during mitosis. To investigate this possibility, we performed long-term live cell imaging over several hours, allowing us to follow mitochondrial content and distribution (revealed by Su9GFP overexpression) to daughter cells through a round of cell division. In dividing WT cells, we would most commonly observe a clear equal segregation of mitochondrial content following cytokinesis (Fig 8C). In contrast, in Miro DKO cells, mitochondrial content could often be seen to be highly variable between daughter cells with one cell receiving a much larger proportion of the mitochondrial network (Fig 8C and D,and Movie EV4). In addition, we also report an unequal mitochondrial segregation happening in Miro2 KO MEFs undergoing mitosis, although in a considerably smaller proportion of cells compared to the Miro DKO MEFs (Fig 8D ) which correlates with the levels of Myo19 observed in both cell lines (Fig 6A). Interestingly, we noticed that this unequal segregation of mitochondria correlated with a mitochondrial distribution in the original cells that were radially asymmetric and highly polarised (Fig 8C and Movie EV4).Myo19 has been proposed to regulate an equal segregation of mitochondria to daughter cells during mitosis (Rohn et al, 2014).

        <p>Possibly as a consequence of an unequal segregation of mitochondria, Miro DKO cells underwent significantly fewer mitotic events in comparison with WT cells (Fig 8E). Similarly, we noted a small but significant increase in the number of cells that detached from the substrate and died during the course of our movies (Appendix Fig S3A) although it is unclear whether these cells died as a consequence of a failed mitotic event. To test whether defects in mitochondrial segregation are due to the loss of Myo19 in Miro DKO cells, we repeated our long-term imaging experiments with cells overexpressing exogenous GFPMyo19. We observed that GFPMyo19 overexpression partially rescued the unequal segregation of mitochondria during mitosis in Miro DKO cells while having no effect on WT cells (Fig 8F). Interestingly, both the rate of mitotic events and the rate of cell death of Miro DKO cells were unchanged when GFPMyo19 was overexpressed (Fig 8G and Appendix Fig S3B), suggesting that Myo19 in the mitochondria is necessary but not sufficient to ensure correct segregation of mitochondria during mitosis. Altogether, our results suggest that Miro proteins are still necessary to ensure correct mitochondrial segregation, either by further regulating Myo19 activity in the mitochondria or by coordinating Myo19 function with the microtubule transport pathway through regulation of kinesin and dynein motor complexes.Possibly as a consequence of an unequal segregation of mitochondria, Miro DKO cells underwent significantly fewer mitotic events in comparison with WT cells (Fig 8E).

        <p>Thus, Miro proteins accomplish a critical role in coordinating the intracellular distribution of mitochondria by both microtubule and actin motors. This coordination is necessary to maintain a homogeneous distribution of mitochondria within cells, which is critical to ensure an equal segregation of mitochondria during mitosis.Thus, Miro proteins accomplish a critical role in coordinating the intracellular distribution of mitochondria by both microtubule and actin motors.

        <p>Constitutive knockout of Miro1 results in early postnatal lethality (Nguyen et al, 2014;Lopez-Domenech et al, 2016) whereas Miro2 KO animals are viable into adulthood and fertile (Lopez-Domenech et al, 2016). In contrast, the impact of compound Miro DKO had not been explored prior to this study. By generating embryos from Miro1/2 heterozygous crosses, we report here that complete loss of Miro1 and Miro2 leads to a failure in early embryonic development, with Miro DKO embryos unable to survive beyond E8.5. The earlier lethality observed in the Miro DKO embryos confirms that Miro1 and Miro2 have essential and non-redundant roles during key early developmental stages. Similar developmental abnormalities, resulting in death during early embryogenesis, have also been observed in mice lacking other genes encoding critical regulators of mitochondrial dynamics such as mitochondrial fusion proteins Mfn1 and Mfn2, knockout of which leads to developmental arrest at E8.5 and reabsorption by E10.5-E11.5 (Chen et al, 2003).

        <p>The EMBO Journal e96380 | 2018 embryos suggests that one copy of Miro1 is sufficient to allow development to continue for a further 4 days (compared to the Miro DKO ) but cannot compensate for all Miro functions at this stage. Remarkably, lethality in the Miro1 het /Miro2 KO animals occurs at a similar stage to Drp1 knockout embryos, which die between E10.5 and E12.5 due to developmental abnormalities including altered forebrain development (Ishihara et al, 2009;Wakabayashi et al, 2009). Miro proteins are, therefore, critical for the normal patterning and growth during early embryonic development, probably via their core conserved functions in regulating mitochondrial positioning and downstream functions such as cell division in addition to later roles in neuronal development and plasticity (Lopez-Domenech et al, 2016;Vaccaro et al, 2017).The EMBO Journal e96380 | 2018 embryos suggests that one copy of Miro1 is sufficient to allow development to continue for a further 4 days (compared to the Miro DKO ) but cannot compensate for all Miro functions at this stage.

        <p>Generating MEF lines from the different genotypes of Miro KO embryos allowed us to explore the involvement of Miro proteins in actin-and microtubule-dependent mitochondrial trafficking and positioning. Using substrate micropatterning, we generated a quantitative "reference" distribution map of positioning of the mitochondrial network upon knockout of Miro1, Miro2 or both Miro proteins. Although knocking out Miro1 led to a depletion of mitochondria from the cell periphery, this was greatly enhanced upon removal of both Miro proteins which led to a substantial perinuclear collapse of the mitochondrial network. While knocking out Miro2 had no effect on the Mito 95 value, the additive effect of Miro DKO suggests that both Miro proteins cooperate to control mitochondrial distribution in the proximal-distal axis within the cell and that Miro1 may be more effective at compensating for the loss of Miro2 while the reverse is not true. In addition, our live cell imaging experiments also revealed that knockout of either Miro protein could contribute to a significant reduction of mitochondrial displacements within the cell. However, Miro1 appeared to be the primary mediator of longrange mitochondrial trafficking along microtubules, suggesting that Miro2 may be more important for other forms of trafficking. The shorter mitochondria observed in a population of Miro DKO cells upon deletion of both Miros is likely a consequence of the dramatically disrupted mitochondrial trafficking, which would likely reduce the number of mitochondrial encounters, and hence the number of fusion events. Our demonstration of a greater impact of Miro1 versus Miro2 knockout for long-range mitochondrial movements agrees with recent work in neurons where Miro1, rather than Miro2, was found to be the primary regulator of long-range mitochondrial transport in axons and dendrites (Lopez-Domenech et al, 2016).Generating MEF lines from the different genotypes of Miro KO embryos allowed us to explore the involvement of Miro proteins in actin-and microtubule-dependent mitochondrial trafficking and positioning.

        <p>A remarkable observation of our experiments is that although long-range transport is considerably disrupted in the absence of all Miro, about 30% of microtubule-dependent runs were preserved in these cells. Our fractionation and imaging experiments show that the kinesin and dynein motors, and the adaptors TRAK1 and TRAK2, can still localise to the mitochondrial membrane in Miro DKO cells despite a complete lack of Miro. Moreover, anterograde transport of mitochondria could still be enhanced by TRAK/KIF5 overexpression in Miro DKO MEFs, presumably due to the ability of TRAK proteins localised at the OMM to still recruit kinesin motors. However, given the significant disruption of long-range microtubule transport in Miro DKO MEFs, TRAK/Kinesin complexes may not be fully functional and may require Miro function to be properly coordinated. These unexpected results challenge the prevailing model that Miro proteins are the obligate acceptor sites on the OMM for the TRAK adaptor proteins (MacAskill &amp; Kittler, 2010;Saxton &amp; Hollenbeck, 2012;Schwarz, 2013;Maeder et al, 2014;Mishra &amp; Chan, 2014;Sheng, 2014) and reopens the question about the mechanism by which these cytoplasmic proteins, TRAK1 and TRAK2, localise to the mitochondria to regulate their transport. Our experiments show that at least Mfn1 is one OMM protein with the ability to interact with TRAK1 and TRAK2 on the mitochondria in the complete absence of Miro. This observation is supported by recent work reporting an interaction between TRAK1 and both mitofusins (Lee et al, 2017). We cannot rule out that other candidates like Mfn2, DISC1, syntaphilin or the Armcx family of proteins (Misko et al, 2010;Lopez-Domenech et al, 2012;Chen &amp; Sheng, 2013;Cartoni et al, 2016;Norkett et al, 2016), all of them shown to regulate mitochondrial transport, may also be able to interact with and recruit TRAK proteins in the absence of Miro.A remarkable observation of our experiments is that although long-range transport is considerably disrupted in the absence of all Miro, about 30% of microtubule-dependent runs were preserved in these cells.

        <p>Our results also support a model whereby TRAK2-mediated retrograde transport is primarily facilitated by Miro1. TRAK2 preferentially binds to dynein/dynactin to mediate the targeting of mitochondria to the dendritic compartment in neurons (van Spronsen et al, 2013). In our experiments, TRAK2 can favour retrograde transport (and oppose kinesin-mediated anterograde transport) when Miro1 is present. Indeed, in the absence of Miro1, the TRAK2 effect switches to favour anterograde trafficking, suggesting a regulatory role for Miro1 in the coordination of the balance between dynein and kinesin activities.Our results also support a model whereby TRAK2-mediated retrograde transport is primarily facilitated by Miro1.

        <p>Mitochondria can also be trafficked along actin filaments through the unconventional myosin motor Myo19 (Quintero et al, 2009), which may be important in mediating short-range movements and for anchoring mitochondria to the actin cytoskeleton. Interestingly, we found that Miro proteins interact with Myo19 and that Miro depletion leads to an almost complete loss of Myo19 from mitochondria in Miro DKO cells. Myo19 can localise to the mitochondria through its positively charged MyMOMA domain (Hawthorne et al, 2016) and we show that this mitochondrial targeting is not affected by the lack of Miro as exogenous GFPMyo19 can still be localised in Miro DKO mitochondria. However, our data demonstrate that Miro proteins are critical for regulating Myo19 recruitment and stability on the OMM. The almost complete loss of Myo19 in the absence of Miro suggests that Myo19 is highly labile and a target for rapid proteosomal degradation. We also noted that the single knockout for Miro2 had a stronger effect than knockout for Miro1 on endogenous Myo19 mitochondrial stability as shown by the reduced levels of Myo19 in Miro2 KO cells, suggesting that Miro2 is more efficient in protecting Myo19 from degradation. This may explain why Miro2 KO cells show a reduction in mitochondrial displacements and contribute to a compound effect of Miro DKO on mitochondrial trafficking and distribution (presumably through Myo19-mediated movements) even though Miro1 is the primary mediator of longer range microtubule-dependent transport.Mitochondria can also be trafficked along actin filaments through the unconventional myosin motor Myo19 (Quintero et al, 2009), which may be important in mediating short-range movements and for anchoring mitochondria to the actin cytoskeleton.

        <p>Our findings also provide new insights regarding altered mitochondrial trafficking and cytoskeletal anchoring during mitochondrial quality control. Upon mitochondrial damage, Miro proteins are rapidly ubiquitinated by the PINK1/Parkin mitophagy pathway (Wang et al, 2011;Birsa et al, 2014) to arrest mitochondrial transport. Since Miro proteins are critical for stabilising Myo19 levels on the mitochondria, Miro loss upon mitochondrial damage leads to a rapid loss of Myo19 from the outer mitochondrial membrane. These results suggest that an important consequence of PINK1/Parkinmediated Miro degradation is the uncoupling of mitochondria from an actin-dependent trafficking and/or anchorage via Myo19 degradation. Thus, uncoupling mitochondria from the actin cytoskeleton via myosin degradation may be an important step in early stages of the mitophagic process.Our findings also provide new insights regarding altered mitochondrial trafficking and cytoskeletal anchoring during mitochondrial quality control.

        <p>Interestingly, we also observed that the collapse of mitochondria upon complete Miro loss of function greatly impairs the balanced segregation of the mitochondrial population to daughter cells during cell division, which correlates with a significantly reduced cell division rate and with a slightly increased death rate in Miro DKO MEFs. As we demonstrate in this study, Miro DKO MEFs are also loss of function for mitochondrial Myo19. Our results are in agreement with the recent demonstration that Myo19 is important for correct mitochondrial segregation during cell division (Rohn et al, 2014). Given the dynamic nature of Myo19 stability on the mitochondrial membrane, it will be interesting in the future to determine whether Myo19 expression levels can be rapidly regulated during the cell cycle and whether this may also be due to Miro regulation. Indeed, Miro proteins may play a central coordinating role in this process through fine-tuning the balance of actin-and microtubule-dependent mitochondrial positioning for correct mitochondrial segregation, a process known to be dependent on Myo19 and in the shedding of microtubule motors from the mitochondria (Rohn et al, 2014;Chung et al, 2016). The fact that exogenous Myo19 can partially rescue mitochondrial segregation supports this view and indicates that Miro proteins may be necessary to coordinate both Myo19 stabilisation and activity with microtubule-dependent mitochondrial positioning ª 2018 The AuthorsInterestingly, we also observed that the collapse of mitochondria upon complete Miro loss of function greatly impairs the balanced segregation of the mitochondrial population to daughter cells during cell division, which correlates with a significantly reduced cell division rate and with a slightly increased death rate in Miro DKO MEFs.

        <p>or motility. This central coordinating role is supported by our studies of embryonic development. Early stages of development are characterised by a high proliferative rate. The altered mitochondrial segregation to daughter cells and associated slower mitosis rate may in part contribute to the observed embryonic lethality in Miro1 het / Miro2 KO at E12.5 and in Miro DKO embryos at E10.5. Our work suggests Miro proteins play a central role in coordinating microtubule-and actin-dependent forces on positioning of mitochondria in cells. By coupling to Myo19 in addition to kinesin and dynein, Miro proteins regulate mitochondrial distribution within the cell using both the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. Whereas both Miro proteins can act to coordinate microtubule-dependent and actin-dependent mitochondrial trafficking, Miro1 preferentially acts to control microtubule-dependent trafficking through kinesin and dynein, while Miro2 plays a more prominent role in coordinating mitochondrial interactions with the actin cytoskeleton through a more efficient recruitment and stability of endogenous Myo19 in the mitochondrial membrane. This fine balance of mitochondrial positioning, mediated by the concerted action of Miro proteins, plays a central role in embryonic development and key cellular processes such as cell division.or motility.

        <p>Generation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) E8.5 embryos were harvested on ice-cold dissection buffer. Yolk sacs were collected and used for genotyping. The heads and viscera were removed from the embryos, and the remaining tissue was gently triturated by pipetting repeatedly (5-10 strokes) in DMEM complete medium. Cells were then plated on 24-well plates. After several days in culture, cells were immortalised by transfection of the simian virus 40 (SV40) T antigen. After 5-7 passages at low density, the cultures presented a homogeneous cell population and started to grow steadily. Transformed cell lines were then genotyped to confirm genetic background. All experiments were carried out after at least eight passages from the immortalisation process.Generation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) E8.5 embryos were harvested on ice-cold dissection buffer.

        <p>We followed a previously published protocol with minor modifications (Frezza et al, 2007). Briefly, MEF cells were grown in 15-cm-diameter culture dishes until 95% confluent. Cells were obtained by trypsinisation, washed twice in sterile PBS and resuspended in isolation buffer (IBc: 10 mM Tris/MOPS; 1 mM EGTA/Tris; 0.2 M glucose; pH 7.4). Cell suspension was homogenised using a Teflon Potter Elvehjem and precipitated twice by centrifugation at 600 g for 5 min to remove unbroken cells. Supernatant was subjected to another centrifugation at 7,000 g for 10 min to obtain the mitochondrial fraction. Supernatant was further cleared and kept as cytoplasmic fraction.We followed a previously published protocol with minor modifications (Frezza et al, 2007).

        <p>Mitochondrial distribution analysis Cells growing on "Y"-shaped micropatterned substrates were selected on the basis of shape (visualised with phalloidin or a reporter fill) and nuclei (visualised with DAPI) to ensure that only single cells properly attached to the micropatterns were used. The mitochondrial channel (visualised with MitoTracker) was not used to select cells before the acquisition. The mitochondrial area was thresholded, and Sholl analysis of mitochondrial distribution was performed using a custom-made 
            <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> plugin (Lopez-Domenech et al, 2016). Mitochondrial signal was quantified within shells radiating out from the soma at 1-lm intervals and the cumulative distribution of mitochondrial signal or Mitochondrial Probability Map (MPM) was plotted per genotype. The distance at which 50, 90 and 95% of the total mitochondrial mass is found (Mito 50 , Mito 90 and Mito 95 values, respectively) was calculated per each cell by interpolation. One average, Mito 95 value was calculated per genotype per experiment and used to quantify a final Mito 95 value (n = experiments) in figures. In case of overexpression experiments, total number of cells was used as the n (n = cells).
