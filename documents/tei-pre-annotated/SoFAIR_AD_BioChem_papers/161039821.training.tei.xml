        <p>Hydrogen sulfide signaling involves persulfide formation at specific protein Cys residues. However, overcoming current methodological challenges in persulfide detection and elucidation of Cys regeneration mechanisms from persulfides are prerequisites for constructing a bona fide signaling model. We here establish a novel, highly specific protein persulfide detection protocol, ProPerDP, with which we quantify 1.52 ± 0.6 and 11.6 ± 6.9 mg/mg protein steady-state protein persulfide concentrations in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and mouse liver, respectively. Upon treatment with polysulfides, HEK293 and A549 cells exhibited increased protein persulfidation. Deletion of the sulfideproducing cystathionine-g-lyase or cystathionine-b-synthase enzymes in yeast diminished protein persulfide levels, thereby corroborating their involvement in protein persulfidation processes. We here establish that thioredoxin (Trx) and glutathione (GSH) systems can independently catalyze reductions of inorganic polysulfides and protein persulfides. Increased endogenous persulfide levels and protein persulfidation following polysulfide treatment in thioredoxin reductase-1 (TrxR1) or thioredoxin-related protein of 14 kDa (TRP14) knockdown HEK293 cells indicated that these enzymes constitute a potent regeneration system of Cys residues from persulfides in a cellular context. Furthermore, TrxR1-deficient cells were less viable upon treatment with toxic amounts of polysulfides compared to control cells. Emphasizing the dominant role of cytosolic disulfide reduction systems in maintaining sulfane sulfur homeostasis in vivo, protein persulfide levels were markedly elevated in mouse livers where hepatocytes lack both TrxR1 and glutathione reductase (TR/GR-null). The different persulfide patterns observed in wild-type, GR-null, and TR/GR-null livers suggest distinct roles for the Trx and GSH systems in regulating subsets of protein persulfides and thereby fine-tuning sulfide signaling pathways.Hydrogen sulfide signaling involves persulfide formation at specific protein Cys residues.

        <p>Since the neuromodulator function of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) was discovered about 20 years ago (1), extensive research has revealed master regulator properties of H 2 S in a wide array of physiological processes in almost all forms of life (2). In addition to being vital for normal human physiology, H 2 S also plays central roles in many pathophysiological events, substantiating sulfide-mediated signaling as a drug target (3,4). However, the understanding of the molecular mechanisms for H 2 S signaling remains very limited (5). Enzyme and protein regulation via persulfidation, that is, formation of persulfide (-SSH) moieties (a process also known as protein S-sulfhydration), at regulatory cysteine (Cys) residues is widely suggested as a major pathway (5,6). Furthermore, sulfane sulfur species (a collective name for compounds containing forms of sulfide with an oxidation state of 0) are now recognized as mediators in redox biology (7,8) and nitric oxide signaling (9)(10)(11)(12). Thus, increasing attention in the field of redox signaling and sulfur biology has been diverted to the biological roles of inorganic polysulfides (HS x -) (13) and protein persulfides (7,14).Since the neuromodulator function of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) was discovered about 20 years ago (1), extensive research has revealed master regulator properties of H 2 S in a wide array of physiological processes in almost all forms of life (2).

        <p>Despite a rapid evolution of fluorescent probes (15) and several protein persulfide detection methods (16), there remains a very limited understanding of the role of sulfane sulfur species in signaling pathways and cellular redox homeostasis (17). For example, recently reported relatively high cellular persulfide levels of up to 0.1 mM (7) were argued to be in contrast with the notion of a highly reducing environment in the cytosol that would counteract their formation (18), thus highlighting the need of optimized and more specific persulfide detection methods. In this context, it should also be noted that although persulfide formation pathways have been rather extensively studied, the reducing mechanisms that can regenerate native forms of Cys residues from persulfide species remain largely elusive. Two recent reports have suggested the involvement of thioredoxin (Trx) in metabolism of Cys persulfides (19,20), but there remains a lack of thorough mechanistic studies of such activities.Despite a rapid evolution of fluorescent probes (15) and several protein persulfide detection methods (16), there remains a very limited understanding of the role of sulfane sulfur species in signaling pathways and cellular redox homeostasis (17).

        <p>Here, we report the development and validation of a novel, easyto-use, and highly specific Protein Persulfide Detection Protocol (ProPerDP), which can be used with intact cells and tissue samples. We report the capacities of thioredoxin reductase-1 (TrxR1), Trx1, and the alternative TrxR1-dependent redox active thioredoxin-related protein of 14 kDa (TRP14) (21) to reduce polysulfides and protein persulfide species and, utilizing ProPerDP, we demonstrate their impacts on cellular protein persulfide levels. Apart from its recently recognized nitrosothiol-and cystine-reducing properties (22), our results reveal that TRP14 is highly efficient in catalyzing protein persulfide and HS x -reduction. In addition, our results indicate that cells with a compromised Trx system exhibit decreased viability in the presence of toxic amounts of inorganic polysulfides. Furthermore, we show that the glutaredoxin (Grx)/glutathione reductase (GR)/glutathione (GSH) machinery can also catalytically reduce polysulfides and protein persulfides. Finally, using ProPerDP on mouse liver samples lacking GR and/or TrxR1 in hepatocytes, we demonstrate the physiological significance of the Trx and GSH systems to maintain sulfane sulfur homeostasis and suggest their involvement in sulfide signaling.Here, we report the development and validation of a novel, easyto-use, and highly specific Protein Persulfide Detection Protocol (ProPerDP), which can be used with intact cells and tissue samples.

        <p>ProPerDP: A novel protein persulfide detection protocol We here developed an easy, convenient, and reliable protein persulfide detection protocol (ProPerDP), which we found to yield high specificity (Fig. 1). In the initial step, protein Cys thiol (-SH) and persulfide (-SSH) functional groups are alkylated using the biotin-labeled alkylating agent EZ-Link Iodoacetyl-PEG 2 -Biotin (IAB) (Fig. 1, Sample 1) and can thereafter be pulled down from a protein mixture using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. Other oxidized Cys derivatives, such as disulfides, are not alkylated under the conditions of ProPerDP and remain in the supernatant (Fig. 1, Sample 2). Cys sulfenic acids (-SOH) or nitrosothiols (-SNO) may become alkylated to some extent, but such reactions would generate thioethers (-SR) just as with the free thiols and hence will not appear as false positives in the final persulfide fraction (Sample 3). Derivatized persulfides are separated from the original thiol groups in a reduction step, where the thioethers (the thiol alkylation products) will remain bound to the beads. However, the dialkyl disulfides derived from the protein persulfides that were present in the original sample are selectively cleaved off and can thus be quantified and subsequently visualized on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Fig. 1, Sample 3). The thioether-containing proteins can also be detected by SDS-PAGE upon their release from the beads by boiling in SDScontaining sample buffer (Fig. 1, Sample 4).ProPerDP: A novel protein persulfide detection protocol We here developed an easy, convenient, and reliable protein persulfide detection protocol (ProPerDP), which we found to yield high specificity (Fig. 1).

        <p>Human serum albumin (HSA) contains a single, freely accessible Cys residue (Cys 34 ) that can provide a site of protein persulfidation and was used as a model protein to validate the ProPerDP method. HSA persulfide (HSA-SSH) was generated by reacting HSA with HS x -. HSA-SSH formation was confirmed by our previously reported indirect measurement of protein-associated sulfane sulfur in concentrated solutions of purified protein samples (23). This protocol is based on the quantification of sulfide that is liberated upon reduction of desalted protein persulfide samples by a modified monobromobimane method (24). 10.2 ± 1.4 mM H 2 S ( mean ± SD from n = 5 experiments) was liberated from 10 mM purified, polysulfide-treated HSA, suggesting that most of the free Cys 34 can be persulfidated/polysulfidated by excess HS x -. With these HSA-SSH samples, we validated that ProPerDP indeed detects protein persulfides in a specific manner, with no background signal seen if the persulfides were reduced before alkylation {S3 lanes in the ±TCEP [tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine] samples in Fig. 2A}. A decline in persulfide content was observed upon incubation of HSA-SSH in the presence of added sulfide before the alkylation step in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A′ and fig. S1), confirming our previous observation that persulfidation is an equilibrium process that can be shifted by the addition of either product or reactant species (25). However, depending on the nature of the persulfidated Cys residues, such equilibrium (reaction 1) can be largely shifted either to the left, as is the case with phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) (23), or to the right, as with TNB (2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic acid) that was derived from DTNB [5,5′-Human serum albumin (HSA) contains a single, freely accessible Cys residue (Cys 34 ) that can provide a site of protein persulfidation and was used as a model protein to validate the ProPerDP method.

        <p>Using Coomassie staining and Western blot analyses, ProPerDP also allowed visualization of HSA-SSH formation in HS x --treated plasma samples in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2, B andC). Endogenous HSA-SSH was not detectable, and in contrast to previous suggestions (26,27), sulfide treatment of plasma samples could not generate substantial amounts of HSA-SSH in our hands (Fig. 2C′). Although HSA Fig. 1. Protein Persulfide Detection Protocol. Thiol and persulfide functional groups are alkylated by IAB to form the corresponding thioether and dialkyl disulfide derivatives, respectively (-R denotes the electrophile moiety of the alkylating agent). Oxidized Cys residues of proteins in the original sample (Sample 1) will not be derivatized by IAB. Affinity purification of alkylated proteins is achieved by pulldown with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, leaving proteins only containing oxidized Cys residues in the supernatant (Sample 2). Resuspension of purified beads in a reducing buffer selectively cleaves the original persulfides off as thiols, which can be analyzed after separation with recovery from the beads, thus allowing the determination of protein persulfides (Sample 3). Note that some sulfenic acid (-SOH) or nitrosothiol (-SNO) derivatives might become alkylated in Sample 1, but these reactions give thioethers such as free thiols and hence do not appear as false positives in Sample 3.

        <p>-by the Trx system Persulfidation is inhibitory for most thiol enzyme functions (5), but the effect of selenopersulfide (-SeSH) formation, to our knowledge, has not been tested for any functional selenocysteine (Sec)-containing enzyme. The Trx-reducing activities of mammalian TrxRs depend on a conserved solvent-exposed and highly reactive C-terminal Sec residue (28,29). Therefore, we investigated how HS x -exposure affects the activity of TrxR1. Instead of enzyme inhibition, we found that in the presence of its natural electron donor NADPH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), TrxR1 catalytically reduces HS x -in a polysulfide concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Both the zero-order character of the observed kinetic traces (reflecting efficient enzyme-catalyzed reactions) and the fact that substrate saturation could not be achieved using HS x -concentrations as high as 1 mM (Fig. 3B) indicated that HS x -are good substrates for TrxR1. To test a potential selenopersulfide formation-induced (or competitive inhibition-mediated) decline in TrxR1 activity in turnover with selenite as another low-molecular weight substrate of the enzyme (30), we added 50 mM selenite to the NADPH/TrxR1/polysulfide mixtures. No enzyme inhibition was detected; rather, an additive effect was observed in NADPH consumption rates (Fig. 3C and fig. S2), suggesting that the enzyme is not saturated under these conditions. These experiments clearly showed that polysulfides are substrates and not inhibitors of TrxR1. We next assessed whether polysulfide reduction by TrxR1 was Secdependent using mutant variants of the enzyme. A Sec-to-Ser mutant was inactive (Fig. 3D), whereas a Sec-to-Cys mutant displayed about 5 to 10% turnover (fig. S3A) compared to the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3A). Two other mutated variants of truncated TrxR1 lacking the Sec residue were also inactive (fig. S3, B andC), indicating that polysulfide reduction by the enzyme was dependent on its proper C-terminal active-site motif -GCUG and displayed at least 10-fold higher activity in the form of the native selenoprotein compared to a Sec-to-Cys substituted variant of the enzyme.

        <p>HS x -reduction rates were further increased upon addition of physiological concentrations of either Trx1 (5 mM) or TRP14 (2 mM) by 1.7and 2.6-fold, respectively (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, addition of HS x -did not inhibit reduction of the alternative Trx1 substrate insulin (Fig. 3F) or the TRP14 substrate cystine (Fig. 3G); instead, similar additive effects were observed as in the selenite assay for TrxR1.

        <p>Protein persulfide reduction by the Trx system Next, we investigated whether protein persulfides can be reduced by the Trx system, first using bovine serum albumin persulfide (BSA-SSH) as a model substrate. BSA-SSH was produced and detected with ProPerDP as described for HSA (see fig. S4). TrxR1 alone as well as in a concerted manner with Trx1 and TRP14 could indeed reduce BSA-SSH. BSA-SSH was rapidly reduced using 50 nM TrxR1 and either 5 mM Trx1 or 2 mM TRP14 (Fig. 3H). Control experiments verified that the observed activities were not due to residual HS x -(used to generate BSA-SSH) remaining in the protein samples (fig. S5A) and that the catalytic reduction proceeded in a BSA-SSH concentration-dependent manner (fig. S5, B andC). With 5 mM Trx1 or 2 mM TRP14 accelerating the BSA-SSH reduction rates 1.7-and 2.4-fold, respectively, compared to TrxR1 alone, the protein persulfide reduction (just like for HS x -, see above) was most favorable via the TRP14-catalyzed pathway (Fig. 3H).Protein persulfide reduction by the Trx system Next, we investigated whether protein persulfides can be reduced by the Trx system, first using bovine serum albumin persulfide (BSA-SSH) as a model substrate.

        <p>To assess the impact of the Trx system on protein persulfide levels in a cellular context, we first validated ProPerDP for analyses of protein persulfides in cell lysates. For this, we generated a protein persulfide pool by treating lysates of A549 human lung carcinoma cells with HS x -, which revealed that a number of protein persulfide species could be detected upon polysulfide treatment that were below detection level in nontreated samples (Fig. 4A). The protein persulfide species present in the S3 sample again disappeared if the sample was treated with TCEP before the alkylation step (indicating no background signals even in cell lysates). To prevent artificial oxidation upon cell lysis, rapid alkylation of reactive thiol and persulfide groups in intact cells is necessary if protein persulfide analyses are to be done with live cells. This is enabled with ProPerDP because the biotin-tagged alkylating agent (IAB) readily crosses through cell membranes, demonstrated by the large amounts of proteins removed by the streptavidin-coated beads when the alkylating agent was used on intact cells and washed away in the cell culture before the cells were lysed (Fig. 4B, compare lanes S1 and S2). Most of these proteins could not be reduced off the beads using TCEP or dithiothreitol (DTT) (Fig. 4B, lane S4), thus representing proteins with free thiols and other Cys derivatives that could generate thioether bonds with the alkylating agent inside the cell (also see Fig. 1). The results shown in Fig. 4B also indicated that ProPerDP could be used to identify a small subset of proteins that formed persulfides upon HS x -treatment in intact cells (Fig. 4B, lane S3). Mass spectrometry-based identification of some of these proteins (Fig. 4, B andC, bands 1 to 4) gave closely overlapping results with proteins being previously reported as persulfidated by Ida et al. (7) and Mustafa et al. (31). However, considerably lower levels of endogenous protein persulfides were detected compared to those in HS x --treated samples. Even if silver staining was used with highly concentrated samples, the protein persulfides were only scarcely detectable in the untreated cell sample (Fig. 4D).To assess the impact of the Trx system on protein persulfide levels in a cellular context, we first validated ProPerDP for analyses of protein persulfides in cell lysates.

Most of these proteins could not be reduced off the beads using TCEP or dithiothreitol (DTT) (Fig. 4B, lane S4), thus representing proteins with free thiols and other Cys derivatives that could generate thioether bonds with the alkylating agent inside the cell (also see Fig. 1). The results shown in Fig. 4B also indicated that ProPerDP could be used to identify a small subset of proteins that formed persulfides upon HS x -treatment in intact cells (Fig. 4B, lane S3). Mass spectrometry-based identification of some of these proteins (Fig. 4, B andC, bands 1 to 4) gave closely overlapping results with proteins being previously reported as persulfidated by Ida et al. (7) and Mustafa et al. (31). However, considerably lower levels of endogenous protein persulfides were detected compared to those in HS x --treated samples. Even if silver staining was used with highly concentrated samples, the protein persulfides were only scarcely detectable in the untreated cell sample (Fig. 4D).</p>
        <p>Using ProPerDP, we could also detect protein persulfides in yeast. Thereby, we were able to test the impacts of the two known sulfidegenerating enzymes (32), which were also proposed to directly generate persulfide species, cystathionine-b-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-glyase (CSE) (7), on in vivo levels of protein persulfides. The observed lower levels of persulfidation in CBS-or CSE-deleted yeast strains compared to the wild-type mother cell line (Fig. 4E) were consistent with the known activities of these enzymes in generating intracellular H 2 S, thereby providing another level of method validation.Using ProPerDP, we could also detect protein persulfides in yeast.

        <p>To assess whether the protein persulfide and/or HS x -reduction by the Trx system might have an impact on persulfide levels in a cellular context, we constructed stable TrxR1 and TRP14 knockdown human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell lines (Fig. 5A). Using ProPerDP, we found that HEK293 cells contained 1.52 ± 0.55 mg of endogenous basal levels of protein persulfides per milligram of protein, suggesting that 0.15 ± 0.06% (from n = 3 experiments) of the total proteins are persulfidated. ProPerDP detected 25 ± 9% and 29 ± 11% (mean ± SD from n = 4 experiments reaching statistical significance with P &lt; 0.05; see Fig. 5, B andC) more total persulfidated proteins in the TrxR1-and TRP14-deficient HEK293 cells, respectively, compared to control cells [HEK293 cells transfected with a plasmid transcribing a scramble shRNA (short hairpin RNA)]. Control experiments verified that this was not due to less efficient alkylation or pulldown by the beads (fig. S6) and should thereby likely be explained by the lower reduction capacity of persulfide moieties in the cells deficient in TrxR1 or TRP14. In addition, HS x -treatment induced more protein persulfide formation in the deficient cells compared to control cells (Fig. 5D). We estimate that the level of protein persulfides in the polysulfide-treated control cells is &gt;3 mg/mg total protein, which is ~2.7-and ~3.7-fold larger in the TrxR1 and TRP14 knockdown cells, respectively, based on Fig. 5D. Dose-dependent treatment of intact cells with toxic amounts of HS x for 2 hours resulted in significantly lowered viability of TrxR1-deficient cells compared to control cells at 24 hours after treatment (Fig. 5E). These observations collectively show that the Trx system is involved in intracellular reduction of protein persulfide species and in the maintenance of cellular sulfane sulfur homeostasis.To assess whether the protein persulfide and/or HS x -reduction by the Trx system might have an impact on persulfide levels in a cellular context, we constructed stable TrxR1 and TRP14 knockdown human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell lines (Fig. 5A).

        <p>Working hand in hand with the Trx system, the GSH system serves as the other major disulfide-reducing machinery in vivo (33). Therefore, we also investigated its potential to reduce polysulfide and protein persulfide species. Using NADPH and GSH, GR catalyzed the reduction of HS x -in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). Inclusion of Grx in the enzyme kinetic assay further increased catalytic power (Fig. 6B). Up to 1 mM HS x -, linear concentration dependencies were observed for the catalyzed reduction rates in both assays, suggesting that polysulfides are good substrates for these enzyme systems (Fig. 6C). Similar to the Trx system, using BSA-SSH, we found that, in the presence of NADPH, GR together with GSH has the potential to catalytically reduce protein persulfide species, with substantially increased reduction rates in the coupled assay with Grx (Fig. 6D). As above, control experiments verified that the observed activities were not due to residual HS x -(which were used to generate BSA-SSH) remaining in the protein samples (fig. S7).Working hand in hand with the Trx system, the GSH system serves as the other major disulfide-reducing machinery in vivo (33).

        <p>To investigate the in vivo significance of the persulfide-and HS x -reducing potentials of the Trx and GSH machineries, we further developed ProPerDP to detect protein persulfides in tissue samples (see Materials and Methods for details). Using an analogous protein quantification protocol to the one used for the cellular systems, ProPerDP measured 11.6 ± 6.9 mg of protein persulfides per milligram of total protein in the liver of 8-to 10-week-old wild-type male mice (n = 8 different animals). We observed different protein persulfidation patterns in mouse livers engineered (34) to lack GR (GR-null) or to lack both TrxR1 and GR (TR/GR-null) in hepatocytes as compared to matching wild-type livers (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, significantly (P = 0.02) elevated persulfide levels, 20.2 ± 9.0 mg/mg of total protein, were observed in TR/GR-null liver samples compared to wild type (Fig. 7B).

        <p>Here, we presented a novel method, ProPerDP, for analysis of protein persulfide species. We characterized catalytic reduction of such entities by the Trx system, and we used ProPerDP to show that TrxR1 and TRP14 expression have an impact on protein persulfide accumulation in cells. TrxR1 knockdown cells were less viable in the presence of toxic amounts of HS x -, providing corroborating evidence for the physiological importance of an intact Trx system to maintain intracellular sulfane sulfur homeostasis. The Grx/GR/GSH system was also found to be capable of catalytically reducing polysulfide and protein persulfide species.

        <p>Since the discovery by Snyder's group that protein persulfidation, also called sulfhydration, is a major pathway in sulfide signaling (31), a number of elegant studies have shown that protein Cys persulfide formation can have regulatory functions. Examples include (i) antiapoptotic transcriptional activity triggered by persulfide-mediated binding of ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3) to nuclear factor kappa-light-chainenhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) (35), (ii) extracellular signalregulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) translocation into the nucleus facilitated by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK1) persulfide formationinduced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) activation leading to DNA damage repair (36), (iii) adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive channel activation upon persulfide-induced inhibition of ATP binding (37), and (iv) potent inhibition of PTEN (23) or of protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) (20) activities by persulfidation of their active-site Cys residues. In addition, a thiol protein-protecting effect by persulfidation was recently suggested, because persulfide moieties are in theory reducible oxidative modifications as opposed to irreversible oxidation of Cys thiols (7,14,23). Our results suggest not only that both Trx and GSH systems participate in the regeneration of such protective modifications but also that these reducing machineries may thereby be involved in the regulation of a subset of many key proteins that are regulated by persulfide formation. Additional studies are required to assess such regulations in a proteinspecific manner, but a general discussion of potential models is already possible at this stage (see below).Since the discovery by Snyder's group that protein persulfidation, also called sulfhydration, is a major pathway in sulfide signaling (31), a number of elegant studies have shown that protein Cys persulfide formation can have regulatory functions.

        <p>One important question with regard to protein persulfide modifications as regulatory mechanisms for cell function is how common such modifications are and at what levels protein persulfides accumulate in cells. Although a few persulfide assays were published recently, detection and quantification of intracellular protein persulfidation have remained problematic. The most extensively used assays thus far have been the modified biotin switch (31) and the recently published tag-switch (7,38) methods. The modified biotin switch method is based on the assumption that methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) selectively blocks thiols over persulfides, which, however, has been questioned a number of times on chemical grounds (38,39). In fact, at pH 7, many persulfides were suggested to be even better nucleophiles than the corresponding thiol moieties ( 14) and would hence be expected to react faster with alkylating agents (such as MMTS). In the tag-switch assay, methylsulfonyl benzothiazole (MSBT) (the alkylating agent) is not permeable for cell membranes, which excludes the possibility of persulfide detection in intact live cells. Furthermore, in the "switching" step, methyl cyanoacetate was suggested to selectively cleave MSBT-labeled dialkyl disulfides (generated by alkylation of persulfide species) over protein disulfide moieties. However, selectivity was only assessed on the N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl derivatized cystine and on glutathionylated bovine serum albumin (BSA), not taking into account the presence of activated functional disulfides in cellular systems, which exhibit orders of magnitude larger reactivities (40). For example, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) persulfidation could potentially represent a false-positive hit in the tagswitch assay, because this oxidoreductase uses an activated disulfide moiety in its active site to introduce disulfide bonds in newly synthesized polypeptides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (40). On the other hand, that reactivity of the PDI disulfide could also potentially be responsible for its persulfidation by a direct reaction with sulfide in the ER (25). These examples and uncertainties demonstrate that a new method to determine intracellular persulfide formation has been highly desired, which was the basis for our development of ProPerDP. It should be noted that in A549 cells, we identified a limited number of proteins that were prominently persulfidated upon treatment with HS x -that all contain a redox-sensitive Cys residue, and most of these proteins were also picked up by the tag-switch or by the modified biotin switch assays (7,31). In light of the estimated 20 mM total intracellular Cys concentration (41,42) and the fact that most mammalian proteins have at least one Cys residue (43), the quantified ~0.1 to 1% persulfidation of the total protein pool in cells (1.52 ± 0.55 mg/mg total protein in HEK293 cells) and liver tissue (11.6 ± 6.9 mg/mg total protein in mice), respectively, correlates very well with the ~10 to 100 mM smallmolecule persulfide (mostly GSH persulfide) concentrations in A549 cells and mouse liver, respectively, that were measured by Ida et al. (7).One important question with regard to protein persulfide modifications as regulatory mechanisms for cell function is how common such modifications are and at what levels protein persulfides accumulate in cells.

        <p>We need to point out that the ProPerDP method is not without caveats either. Some proteins have more than one surface-exposed thiol residue, some of which might form persulfides more preferentially than others. Proteins in which a free thiol is alkylated at the same time as a persulfide group is present at another site may be lost in our assay (Fig. 8A). Another caveat with our method is that it could potentially detect disulfide-linked proteins in which an extra surface-exposed nonpersulfidated free Cys residue (in the absence of denaturation) also becomes alkylated (Fig. 8B). However, the fact that the levels of most of the detected endogenous persulfidated proteins increased in A549 or HEK293 cells (see fig. S8) upon HS x -treatment suggests that only a small proportion (if at all) of the observed bands are due to such falsepositive hits. In addition, using two-dimensional (2D) diagonal gel electrophoresis (with a nonreducing and a reducing dimension), we could not detect significant differences in the intermolecular disulfide pools of the S1 and S2 fractions (fig. S9; see Fig. 1 for an explanation of fractions), corroborating that false-positive hits by ProPerDP via the above mechanism (Fig. 8B) are likely minor. Furthermore, the fact that reduced protein persulfide levels were observed in CBS-or CSE-deleted yeast cells compared to the wild-type mother strain verifies that ProPerDP indeed detects protein persulfide species. However, it has to be noted that, in its current form, ProPerDP cannot distinguish between protein persulfides and protein polysulfide species. Therefore, we advise investigators to be cognizant of the abovementioned limitations when running the assay. A potential methodological improvement using mass spectrometrybased detection to overcome the abovementioned caveats (as argued above, with the false-negative hits being more relevant) is proposed in Fig. 8C. This includes trypsinization before the affinity purification step, because on the peptide level, situations outlined in Fig. 8 (A andB) would become highly unlikely. 1). (C) A potential way to overcome the abovementioned caveats is to digest the alkylated proteins before the pulldown step because it is highly unlikely that both the free and persulfidated Cys [for (A)] or the disulfide and the free Cys moieties [for (B)] will end up in the same peptide using this method. With this approach, the alkylated peptide persulfides could be detected by mass spectrometry after they are cleaved off the beads by the reducing agent. This method improvement is under development in our laboratory. Possible mechanisms of protein persulfide formation via sulfide or Cys thiol oxidation processes (5) as well as enzymatic pathways (7,32) are being extensively studied. By contrast, counteracting pathways for reduction of protein persulfide species are much less well understood. Recent reports from Kimura's and Tonks' laboratories have suggested that 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase and PTP1B persulfides are likely to be reduced by Trx1, on the basis of their observed faster reduction rates compared to DTT, GSH, or dihomo-g-linoleic acid, using purified enzymes and cell lysate experiments (19,20). However, to the best of our knowledge, no mechanistic studies or analyses have been conducted to date with regard to reduction pathways for either protein persulfides or polysulfides (HS x -) in intact cells or tissue samples. Here, we used enzyme kinetic studies to demonstrate that TrxR1 catalyzes the direct reduction of HS x -as well as protein persulfide moieties via its Sec residue. Further catalytic power is introduced in the presence of physiological concentrations of Trx1 or TRP14. In contrast to most thiol proteins (see above), the fact that HS x -did not inhibit the activities of either TrxR1, Trx1, or TRP14 suggests that any TrxR1 selenopersulfide and Trx1 or TRP14 persulfide intermediate species (that should form during the reduction process; fig. S10) are rapidly reduced by the resolving Cys residues in the active sites of TrxR1, Trx1, or TRP14.We need to point out that the ProPerDP method is not without caveats either.

        <p>Perhaps our most important finding with regard to the reduction of protein persulfides by the Trx system is that TRP14 is an efficient catalyst. TRP14 is a newly discovered member of the Trx protein family that lacks activity with typical Trx substrates such as ribonucleotide reductase, insulin, or peroxiredoxins (21). The protein was, however, recently found to support cystine and nitrosothiol reduction (22) and can also reactivate oxidized PTP1B (44). The latter property of TRP14 becomes even more interesting in light of our findings that TRP14 is a prominent protein persulfide reductase, because PTP1B has also been found to be regulated by persulfidation (20). Hence, TRP14 is emerging as a very efficient substrate of TrxR1 (22) that may be specifically tailored for redox signaling purposes. Indeed, particularly under increasingly oxidizing or proliferating growth conditions, during which Trx would be heavily engaged in turning over the peroxiredoxin system (45) or providing electrons for ribonucleotide reductase (46), TRP14 is likely to be the major regulator of protein persulfide levels because its activity is not affected by the presence of protein disulfide substrates that are reduced by Trx1 but not by TRP14 (22).Perhaps our most important finding with regard to the reduction of protein persulfides by the Trx system is that TRP14 is an efficient catalyst.

        <p>Demonstrating the physiological importance of the Trx system for protein persulfide reduction, the ProPerDP method here allowed us to measure increased endogenous protein persulfide levels in intact HEK293 cells upon knockdown of TrxR1 or TRP14. Furthermore, polysulfide treatment induced accumulation of higher protein persulfide levels in deficient cells, and TrxR1 knockdown cells were significantly more susceptible to toxic amounts of HS x -compared to control cells. These observations highlight that TrxR1 and TRP14 should indeed be considered major players in the cellular pathways that maintain sulfane sulfur homeostasis.Demonstrating the physiological importance of the Trx system for protein persulfide reduction, the ProPerDP method here allowed us to measure increased endogenous protein persulfide levels in intact HEK293 cells upon knockdown of TrxR1 or TRP14.

        <p>In addition to roles for the various components of the Trx system in modulating protein persulfidation, we here report that the GSH system can also reduce inorganic HS x -and protein persulfides. This activity is enzymatically enhanced by inclusion of Grx and represents an independent mechanism of modulating the cellular persulfide milieu via an NADPHdependent reductase system. Although this might represent yet another physiological process wherein the Trx and GSH systems robustly overlap with each other, some of our data suggest that the two systems might act independently to fine-tune the protein persulfide response. Thus, we found that a distinct subset of proteins are targets for persulfide accumula-tion in wild-type, GR-null, or TR/GR-null liver samples, suggesting that the persulfide-reducing capacities of the Trx and GSH systems might be protein persulfide-specific and potentially involved in different signaling pathways. Further studies will be required to understand the detailed molecular mechanisms by which such systems mediate H 2 S signaling functions and the respective roles of the Trx and GSH systems in these processes. The significantly increased and altered levels of protein persulfides observed in the TR/GR-null mouse liver samples emphasize the orchestrating role of the Trx and GSH systems in reducing protein Cys persulfides in vivo.In addition to roles for the various components of the Trx system in modulating protein persulfidation, we here report that the GSH system can also reduce inorganic HS x -and protein persulfides.

Selection was continued until enough cells were available for generation of freezing stocks. The knockdown was verified in all clones by Western blot using antibodies against TrxR1 (sc-58444) and TRP14 (R&amp;D Systems MAB3504), and GAPDH was used as a loading control (sc-25778). Upon validation, Hygromycin B was removed from the growth medium, which did not affect the knockdown of the proteins over several passages. HEK293 cells were free of mycoplasma contamination tested by the MycoSensor QPCR Assay Kit (Agilent Technologies).Generation of stably transfected HEK293 cells HEK293 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (ATCC), complemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (PAA Laboratories), penicillin, (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml) (Biochrom AG). Cells were kept in logarithmic growth phase at 37°C in humidified air containing 5% CO 2 . Knockdown of TRP14 and TrxR1 was performed using shRNA-bearing plasmids [from Qiagen, KH19389H (human TXNDC17, encoding TRP14) and KH02104H (human TXNRD1)] for the respective proteins as described earlier (22). A negative control shRNA plasmid was included as a control. For stable knockdown, HEK293 cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 4 × 10 5 cells per well 24 hours before transfection. All plasmids were transfected using TurboFect (Thermo Scientific) as transfection reagent with 0.6 mg DNA and 1.2 ml TurboFect per well.

        <p>Sulforhodamine B assay for cytotoxicity screening Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay was performed as described by Vichai et al. (55). HEK293 (control and TrxR1 knockdown) cells (5 × 10 3 ) were seeded to 96-well cell culture plates per well and incubated for 24 hours at 37°C in 5% CO 2 atmosphere. After 24 hours, 0.2 to 3 mM HS x -was added in HBSS and cells were incubated for 2 hours. After the exposure period with polysulfide, HBSS was replaced by complete cell growth medium and SRB assay was performed after 24 hours. Before fixation, cells were rinsed with HBSS. Cells were fixed by adding 100 ml of 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid to each well, incubated at 4°C for 1 hour, and then washed with distilled water. Fifty microliters of SRB stain (0.4% in 1% acetic acid) was added to each well and incubated for 15 min at RT. The plates were rinsed four times with 1% acetic acid and 200 ml of 10 mM tris base solution (pH 10.5) was added to each well, and the plates were shaken for 5 min to solubilize the protein-bound dye. Absorbance was read on a plate reader (BioTek) at 570 nm. Cell survival was measured as absorbance (optical density) of the mean of the 12 replicate wells compared to the control (no polysulfide-treated wells). Paired t test was performed using the

        <p>There was a slight difference in the proliferation of the untreated wildtype and TrxR1 knockout cells after 24 hours. Control cells had about 12% higher proliferation rate; however, this was statistically not significant (t test, P = 0.14). Nonetheless, to correct for this difference, results obtained from the SRB assay are presented as % of control cell growth ¼ mean OD sample 24 hoursmean OD sample 2 hours mean OD neg control 24 hoursmean OD neg control 2 hours Â100There was a slight difference in the proliferation of the untreated wildtype and TrxR1 knockout cells after 24 hours.

        <p>After destaining of QC Colloidal Coomassie Blue (Bio-Rad)-stained SDS-PAGE gels with H 2 O:CH 3 OH:CH 3 COOH (5:4:1), the indicated bands were cut out, reduced with DTT, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and then digested with trypsin from porcine pancreas (dimethylated, proteomics grade, Sigma) as suggested by the UCSF (University of California, San Francisco) Mass Spectrometry Core Facility (56,57). Before liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry measurements, the digested samples were cleaned with C18 ZipTip pipette tips (Millipore). Tryptic peptides were separated by reversed-phase chromatography with a nanoflow high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Easy nLC II, Thermo Fisher Scientific) system on an EASY-column (10 cm, 75 mm, C18) using gradient elution [developed from 5% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid to 90% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water over 40 min at a flow rate of 300 nl/min]. The nanoflow HPLC system was coupled to an LTQ XL ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for peptide analyses that was conducted in triple play positive ion mode in a mass range between 400 and 1500 m/z (mass/ charge ratio). All tandem mass spectrometry samples were analyzed using
