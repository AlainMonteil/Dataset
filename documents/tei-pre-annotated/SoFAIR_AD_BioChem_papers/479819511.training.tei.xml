        <p>Transcriptome analysis enables the study of gene expression in human tissues and is a valuable tool to characterise liver function and gene expression dynamics during liver disease, as well as to identify prognostic markers or signatures, and to facilitate discovery of new therapeutic targets. In contrast to whole tissue RNA sequencing analysis, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics enables the study of transcriptional activity at the single cell or spatial level. ScRNA-seq has paved the way for the discovery of previously unknown cell types and subtypes in normal and diseased liver, facilitating the study of rare cells (such as liver progenitor cells) and the functional roles of nonparenchymal cells in chronic liver disease and cancer. By adding spatial information to scRNA-seq data, spatial transcriptomics has transformed our understanding of tissue functional organisation and cell-to-cell interactions in situ. These approaches have recently been applied to investigate liver regeneration, organisation and function of hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells, and to profile the single cell landscape of chronic liver diseases and cancer. Herein, we review the principles and technologies behind scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic approaches, highlighting the recent discoveries and novel insights these methodologies have yielded in both liver physiology and disease biology.Transcriptome analysis enables the study of gene expression in human tissues and is a valuable tool to characterise liver function and gene expression dynamics during liver disease, as well as to identify prognostic markers or signatures, and to facilitate discovery of new therapeutic targets.

        <p>Sequencing technologies are increasingly used to study phenotypes and drivers of liver disease. Whole tissue RNA sequencing has primarily been used to identify major differences in gene expression between normal and diseased conditions. Advanced computational analyses have established gene signatures to predict patients' prognosis and classify primary liver cancers, 1,2 but these tools have yet to be fully integrated into clinical practice. Whole tissue RNA sequencing provides an average readout of the RNA content of a sample, which represents mixed RNA signals from the different cells present within the tissue and is thus significantly influenced by cell type prevalence. This approach cannot be used to study rare cell populations, cellular heterogeneity (i.e. cell subsets among major cell types), specific pathogenic cell subpopulations, or to dissect cancer clonal evolution and microenvironment. In the era of immunotherapy and precision medicine, higher resolution sequencing data are required to characterise heterogeneous tissues and complex diseases such as chronic liver disease and cancer.Sequencing technologies are increasingly used to study phenotypes and drivers of liver disease.

        <p>Recent technological advances enabled genome-wide RNA profiling in individual cells, a technique termed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). [3][4][5][6] In scRNA-seq, liver tissue is dissociated, single cells captured, and RNA sequencing is performed using several workflows (Fig. 1,2). ScRNA-seq generates very large datasets of thousands of gene transcripts per cell. These datasets are usually represented in a compressed 2D space, e.g. t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) map, 7 where each cell is a dot and the distance between cells is a function of their similarity (Fig. 1A). In this 2D space, cells can be clustered according to their similarity and single or multiple genes can be plotted on separate t-SNE maps. ScRNA-seq enables the discovery, identification and/or study of rare cell types, cell subtypes, disease-specific cell types and cell-to-cell interactions via ligand-receptor expression analysis (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, computational analyses, such as pseudo-time diffusion mapping 8 or RNA velocity, 9 allow in silico lineage tracing and analysis of developmental trajectories between cell types (e.g. from progenitor cells to differentiated hepatocytes) or among cell subtypes (e.g. from cytotoxic to exhausted T cells) (Fig. 1B).Recent technological advances enabled genome-wide RNA profiling in individual cells, a technique termed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).

        <p>A major challenge of scRNA-seq data is to match the RNA profile of a cell with its position within a tissue (i.e. spatial information). This is particularly important in liver biology because the liver is spatially organised in functional lobules and acini. 10 To address this need, spatially resolved RNA sequencing, paired-cell sequencing, complex computational algorithms and direct spatial transcriptomic techniquesin which scRNA-seq is performed on tissue sections using spatially organised RNA capture probeshave recently been developed.A major challenge of scRNA-seq data is to match the RNA profile of a cell with its position within a tissue (i.e. spatial information).

        <p>The initial steps in a scRNA-seq experiment involve tissue dissociation and isolation of single cells which can be obtained by a variety of methods, such as FACS, magnetic separation using specific antibodies, chip-based or microdroplet-based microfluidic technologies, micromanipulation using an inverted microscope and a motorised micromanipulation platform or laser microdissection. 11 FACS is one of the most widely used techniques and allows the selection of specific cell populations from heterogeneous tissues. Highthroughput microdroplet-based microfluidic technologies (e.g. 10X Chromium) are increasingly used because of high capture efficiency and low costs. Microfluidic technologies are based on the dispersion of single cells into water-in-oil droplets, containing uniquely barcoded beads and primers, using a continuous oil flow as depicted in Fig. 2. The choice of single-cell capture method greatly depends on the cell types of interest, their prevalence in the tissue, and costs.The initial steps in a scRNA-seq experiment involve tissue dissociation and isolation of single cells which can be obtained by a variety of methods, such as FACS, magnetic separation using specific antibodies, chip-based or microdroplet-based microfluidic technologies, micromanipulation using an inverted microscope and a motorised micromanipulation platform or laser microdissection. 11 FACS is one of the most widely used techniques and allows the selection of specific cell populations from heterogeneous tissues.

        <p>After cell isolation, scRNA-seq libraries are generated by cell lysis, reverse transcription into complementary DNA (cDNA), second-strand synthesis and cDNA amplification by PCR or in vitro transcription followed by deep sequencing. These steps vary across the different scRNA-seq protocols (Fig. 2). Smart-seq2 is a protocol which uses template-switching technologies for the reverse transcription and PCR technologies for the amplification, enabling the sequencing of full-length transcripts and the study of splicing events and allele-specific expression. 6,12,13 Smart-seq2 is limited by high costs, so different protocols have evolved to allow for adequate RNA coverage and reduced costs. These protocols involve the capture of the RNA poly(A) tail with the insertion into the cDNA of random unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and pre-specified cellular barcodes (Fig. 2). The presence of both cellular barcodes and UMIs in each single cDNA enables pooling of cDNAs from different cells for the amplification and sequencing steps, significantly reducing the costs per run. The cell of origin is inferred using the cellular barcodes and gene expression is quantified by counting and normalising UMIs per single cells. In terms of performance, Smart-seq2 and CEL-seq2 showed the highest sensitivity, while Drop-seq is less expensive but has lower capture efficiency and resolution. 3 Among the different microdroplet-based microfluidic technologies, 10X Chromium results in higher sensitivity and less technical noise. 14After cell isolation, scRNA-seq libraries are generated by cell lysis, reverse transcription into complementary DNA (cDNA), second-strand synthesis and cDNA amplification by PCR or in vitro transcription followed by deep sequencing.

        <p>The liver is a highly organised tissue, and the porto-central axis of the acinus is a fundamental functional unit during homeostasis and disease development. Hepatocyte function varies along this axis, with hepatocytes classically divided into 3 zones. A major challenge in the use of scRNA-seq for the study of liver physiology is the integration of individual cell RNA data with spatial information. To overcome this hurdle, specific sequencing strategies and bioinformatic analyses have been developed (Table 1), allowing new insights into liver zonation (Fig. 3). Halpern et al. studied liver zonation in mice by combining scRNA-seq with single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridisation (smRNA-FISH) to perform spatially resolved RNA-sequencing. 16 At first, they used smRNA-FISH to assess, at high-resolution, the spatial distribution of known zonated landmark genes, allowing their fine porto-central profiling. Then scRNA-seq of mouse hepatocytes was performed and the porto-central profile of landmark genes was used to assign a porto-central position to each single cell (for review see 17The liver is a highly organised tissue, and the porto-central axis of the acinus is a fundamental functional unit during homeostasis and disease development.

        <p>data from the mouse liver demonstrated that i) major determinants of liver zonation were not only oxygen gradient and WNT signalling, 18 but also RAS signalling, which activates periportal genes, and pituitary signals, which inhibit periportal genes (Fig. 3B); ii) zonation is not always monotonic and some genes, e.g. Hamp encoding for hepcidin, have the highest expression in the mid-layers of the lobule (Fig. 3A); iii) genes encoding for enzymes involved in bile acid metabolism are differently expressed along the porto-central axis, suggesting the spatial zonation of entire metabolic processes; iv) metabolites produced in periportal areas are taken up by pericentral hepatocytes in a process called spatial recycling.data from the mouse liver demonstrated that i) major determinants of liver zonation were not only oxygen gradient and WNT signalling, 18 but also RAS signalling, which activates periportal genes, and pituitary signals, which inhibit periportal genes (Fig. 3B); ii) zonation is not always monotonic and some genes, e.g. Hamp encoding for hepcidin, have the highest expression in the mid-layers of the lobule (Fig. 3A); iii) genes encoding for enzymes involved in bile acid metabolism are differently expressed along the porto-central axis, suggesting the spatial zonation of entire metabolic processes; iv) metabolites produced in periportal areas are taken up by pericentral hepatocytes in a process called spatial recycling.</p>
        <p>Once the spatial transcript data of a certain cell type is known, paired-cell sequencing is an elegant technique to infer the zonation of other cell types and to identify strong cell-to-cell interactions (for review see 17 ).

More than 60% of LSEC genes were found to be zonated: periportal LSECs were enriched in genes involved in hormone signalling and metabolism (e.g. incretin and angiotensinogen metabolism) while central/mid LSECs were enriched in genes involved in platelet activation, immunity regulation and scavenger functions. Interestingly, scavenger and platelet activation genes were also enriched in central/ mid-zone hepatocytes, suggesting a functional co-zonation of hepatocytes and LSECs (Fig. 3C,D).Computational analysis can also help with inference of spatial information from scRNA-seq data when spatial organisation is the main source of heterogeneity in a tissue (Table 1).

They observed considerable heterogeneity within the EPCAM + compartment, which comprises an EPCAM + TROP2 int CK19 low progenitor cell with the potential to form bipotent organoids and to commit to either a hepatocyte or cholangiocyte fate 21,33 (Fig. 5). This previously unknown adult liver progenitor cell is located in the canals of Hering and represents the equivalent of the foetal HHyP and the oval cell described in mice. 31 In the normal liver, progenitor cells are usually quiescent and the mechanisms underlying their commitment and activation following liver injury are still unclear. In animal models, liver injury can be induced in a reproducible fashion with several strategies mimicking different liver pathologies. ScRNA-seq has been successfully applied to mouse models of liver injury to study drivers of liver regeneration, revealing YAP target genes as a major source of the heterogeneity in the EPCAM + compartment. 34 This YAP target gene signature represents a dynamic inducible state that is upregulated during liver injury, promoting and sustaining progenitor proliferation and liver regeneration (Fig. 5). 34 In summary, scRNA-seq has facilitated the discovery of a bipotent progenitor cell in the EPCAM + compartment in both foetal and normal adult liver, whose activation is associated with an upregulation of YAP target genes. To accurately characterise drivers of liver regeneration in human disease, further analyses focused on progenitor cell populations in human livers after chronic and acute injury are required.Aizarani and colleagues used scRNA-seq to analyse the heterogeneity across EPCAM + cells in healthy human livers to understand whether the adult liver has a cell type analogous to the HHyP.

        <p>A single-cell study of NPCs in healthy mice and mice with diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)amylin [AMLN] model 41 focused on the characterisation of the NPC secretome and cellto-cell interactions. 42 LSECs were found to secrete angiocrine factors and express several genes involved in cell-to-cell interactions. Ligands were expressed by cholangiocytes, HSCs and LSECs, suggesting extensive interactions with other NPCs as well as autocrine signalling. In NASH livers, LSECs upregulated the expression of genes implicated in lipid metabolism, chemokine release and antigen presentation, whilst genes involved in vascular homeostasis and vascular development were downregulated, inducing a significant disruption of sinusoid capillaries. 42 LSECs are the port of entry of monocyte and other bone marrow-derived cells in the liver lobule. LSEC-to-monocyte interactions are crucial in determining the fate of circulating monocytes and their differentiation into liver macrophages. 43 Livers of Kupffer cell (KC)-depleted mice are rapidly repopulated by circulating monocytes which acquire a KC-like phenotype. LSECs express DLL4 (delta like canonical Notch ligand 4) and TGFb1 (transforming growth factor b1) that interact, respectively, with NOTCH and TGFb/ BMP receptors on monocytes, downregulating monocyte-specific genes. Single-cell analysis of mouse models demonstrated the expansion of monocyte-derived macrophages, with a unique inflammatory phenotype, in NASH livers. 44 Whether dysregulated NASH LSECs determine the phenotype of the NASH monocyte-derived macrophages is still unknown and further studies are needed to elucidate LSEC-to-monocyte interactions in the context of NASH pathogenesis.A single-cell study of NPCs in healthy mice and mice with diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)amylin [AMLN] model 41 focused on the characterisation of the NPC secretome and cellto-cell interactions. 42 LSECs were found to secrete angiocrine factors and express several genes involved in cell-to-cell interactions.

        <p>Hepatic stellate cells are spatially and functionally zonated and are hubs of autocrine and paracrine signalling HSCs had previously been thought to represent a functionally homogeneous population. Dobie et al. used scRNA-seq to deconvolve the hepatic mesenchyme in both healthy and fibrotic mouse liver, uncovering spatial zonation of HSCs across the hepatic lobule. 45 HSCs partition into topographically diametric lobule regions, designated portal vein-associated HSCs (PaHSCs) and central vein-associated HSCs (CaHSCs). HSCs display functional zonation, with CaHSCs representing the dominant pathogenic collagen-producing cells in a mouse model of carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 )-induced centrilobular fibrosis. Furthermore, lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPAR1) was identified as a therapeutic target on collagenproducing HSCs, and inhibition of LPAR1 resulted in decreased contractility in human HSCs in vitro and reduced liver fibrosis in a choline-deficient high-fat diet rodent model of NASH. 45 ScRNA-seq from mouse livers has also shown that HSCs specifically secrete cytokines that act on LSECs, macrophages and cholangiocytes to regulate fibrotic pathways, cytokine expression, vasoactive hormone signalling and HSC apoptosis via secretion of nerve growth factor. 42 HSCs express both Il-11ra1, a receptor belonging to the interleukin (IL)-6 family, and its ligand Il-11, constituting a previously unknown autocrine signal which stimulates the activation of STAT3 and ERK, as well as cytokine secretion. 42 Analysis of HSC gene expression also revealed potential extrahepatic modulation of this cell type. HSCs express vasoactive hormoneresponsive receptors mediating both contraction and relaxation, and specifically the effect of calcitonin gene-related peptide, parathyroid hormone and vasoactive intestinal peptide, which are not expressed by any liver cell type. In the classical view of liver fibrosis pathogenesis, HSCs are the final effector and the last step of the NPC activation cascade. Single-cell analysis of HSCs in NASH showed that they upregulate both IL-11 and cytokines, as well as modulating the function of LSECs and macrophages, suggesting a more complex bidirectional interaction. Altogether, single-cell profiling of HSCs has further extended the concept that this cell type acts as a central hub in the paracrine/autocrine network of liver NPCs in both normal and diseased liver.Hepatic stellate cells are spatially and functionally zonated and are hubs of autocrine and paracrine signalling HSCs had previously been thought to represent a functionally homogeneous population.

SAMF were marked by the expression of TREM2 and CD9, and were able to activate HSCs. Selforganising maps and pseudotime analysis at the single-cell level revealed that SAMF are derived from blood monocytes.

        <p>ScRNA-seq is a revolutionary technique which has already been successfully applied to study the biology of healthy and diseased liver at unprecedented resolution, capturing the heterogeneity of cell types and states, as well as characterising cell-to-cell interactions. The choice of scRNA-seq approach relies on study design, endpoints and costs, and often entails a compromise between costs and gene coverage. Computational algorithms, direct spatial transcriptomics and combinations of scRNA-seq and spatial techniques enable the study of single-cell gene expression in complex, highly spatially organised tissues.ScRNA-seq is a revolutionary technique which has already been successfully applied to study the biology of healthy and diseased liver at unprecedented resolution, capturing the heterogeneity of cell types and states, as well as characterising cell-to-cell interactions.

        <p>ScRNA-seq has already delivered transformative new discoveries in the understanding of liver zonation, regeneration, and the biology of chronic liver disease and cancer. Liver disease biology involves multiple cell types and complex cell-to-cell interactions, and scRNA-seq allows detailed investigation of these multicellular microenvironments. The challenge now is to fully harness and translate this new knowledge into effective novel therapeutic approaches that address the major clinical challenges in hepatology.ScRNA-seq has already delivered transformative new discoveries in the understanding of liver zonation, regeneration, and the biology of chronic liver disease and cancer.
