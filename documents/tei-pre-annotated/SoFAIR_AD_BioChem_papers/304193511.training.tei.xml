        <p>Aging is the main risk factor for vascular disease and ensuing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, the leading causes of death worldwide. In a progressively aging population, it is essential to develop early-life biomarkers that efficiently identify individuals who are at high risk of developing accelerated vascular damage, with the ultimate goal of improving primary prevention and reducing the health care and socioeconomic impact of age-related cardiovascular disease. Studies in experimental models and humans have identified 9 highly interconnected hallmark processes driving mammalian aging. However, strategies to extend health span and life span require understanding of interindividual differences in age-dependent functional decline, known as biological aging. This review summarizes the current knowledge on biological age biomarkers, factors influencing biological aging, and antiaging interventions, with a focus on vascular aspects of the aging process and its cardiovascular disease related manifestations.Aging is the main risk factor for vascular disease and ensuing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, the leading causes of death worldwide.

        <p>MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOMARKERS.

        <p>Telomeres consist of repetitive DNA sequences bound by specific nucleoproteins that protect chromosome ends (6). Telomeres shorten with each cell division, and this attrition can cause cell senescence when telomeres shorten beyond a critical length (6). Agedependent telomere shortening is associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) and predicts both allcause and CVD-related mortality; however, it remains uncertain whether telomere attrition promotes CVD (4,6,7). DNA methylation is a major epigenetic mechanism regulating gene expression. Various studies have identified specific CpG sites undergoing age-related changes in methylation (8,9). Hannum et al. (10) and Horvath (11) described 2 widely used DNA methylation age predictors (DNAmAges, also called epigenetic clocks) based on 71 and 353 CpGs, respectively. DNAmAge seems to be a good predictor of allcause and CVD mortality and, to a lesser extent, incident CVD (12,13).Telomeres consist of repetitive DNA sequences bound by specific nucleoproteins that protect chromosome ends (6).

        <p>During aging, somatic cells accumulate mutations in their DNA, and these mutations can provide a competitive advantage, particularly to highly proliferative cells, thus leading to expansion of mutant clones and mosaicism (14). Somatic mutation-related expansion of hematopoietic cells (clonal hematopoiesis) has typically been linked to cancer; however, recent findings demonstrated an association with increased CVD risk suggesting a potential role as a major driver of atherosclerosis, thus identifying clonal hematopoiesis as a possible novel biomarker of vascular aging (14).During aging, somatic cells accumulate mutations in their DNA, and these mutations can provide a competitive advantage, particularly to highly proliferative cells, thus leading to expansion of mutant clones and mosaicism (14).

        <p>Another characteristic of aging is chronic low-grade inflammation (inflammaging), which can be assessed by measuring circulating levels of proinflammatory molecules, such as elevated C-reactive protein and interleukin 6 (15). Inflammaging, a risk factor for many chronic diseases, including CVD, is partially driven by increased gut permeability and altered microbiota composition. Gut dysbiosis also has the potential to become a biological age estimator because it has been linked to longevity and disease (16).Another characteristic of aging is chronic low-grade inflammation (inflammaging), which can be assessed by measuring circulating levels of proinflammatory molecules, such as elevated C-reactive protein and interleukin 6 (15).

        <p>Aging affects the levels of proteins, metabolites, and other biomolecules in body fluids. Higher morbidity and mortality rates have been linked to changes in individual molecules, such as insulin-like growth factor-1, growth hormone, and low-density lipoproteins (17,18). Because single molecule biomarkers tend to be oversimplistic, various highthroughput approaches have been used to analyze age-related changes in the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome to search for a more comprehensive omics-based "blueprint" of aging, such as GlycanAge (GlycanAge Ltd., London, United Kingdom) or Metabolic Age scores (4). most extensively validated and standardized measure; however, brachial-ankle and heart-ankle PVW are also popular in the clinic (20,21). PWV correlates with chronological age, and a high PWV increases the risk of CVD and all-cause mortality (22,23). Arterial stiffening typically precedes and promotes hypertension, but hypertension can also accelerate arterial stiffening, indicating the existence of a positive feedback loop (24). Blood pressure also increases during aging and is associated with cardiovascular events and mortality (25).Aging affects the levels of proteins, metabolites, and other biomolecules in body fluids.

        <p>Another common feature of vascular aging is atherosclerosis, which consists of lipid-rich plaque buildup in the intima that can lead to acute myocardial infarction or stroke. Endothelial dysfunction, a major driver of atherogenesis, can be measured by ultrasound as flow-mediated dilation (26), and flowmediated dilation decreases during aging and is an independent predictor of CVD outcomes (26,27).Another common feature of vascular aging is atherosclerosis, which consists of lipid-rich plaque buildup in the intima that can lead to acute myocardial infarction or stroke.

        <p>Vascular ultrasound is also frequently used to measure intima-media thickness (IMT) as an estimate of subclinical atherosclerosis burden in large arteries (28,29). Carotid IMT increases with age (30) and is associated with both the prevalence and the incidence of CVD morbidity and mortality (31). However, increased IMT can also reflect nonatherosclerotic processes (30,32). More advanced atherosclerosis stages can be evaluated by quantifying various carotid plaque parameters, such as plaque presence, number, thickness, area, and volume (33), which outperform carotid IMT as a predictor of future CAD events (32).Vascular ultrasound is also frequently used to measure intima-media thickness (IMT) as an estimate of subclinical atherosclerosis burden in large arteries (28,29).

Composite biomarkers vary from combinations of a few biomarkers to highly complex scores developed using machine learning/ artificial intelligence tools that cover multiple aspects of aging. For instance, CVD prediction is improved by the integration of carotid IMT with aortic PWV into the Vascular Aging Index (43). Likewise, Frailty Index 34, composed of 34 measures of health and function in diverse body systems, including the vasculature, outperforms DNAmAge at predicting mortality (44).In normally aging individuals, chronological age equates to biological age.

        <p>The biological age of the vasculature can be estimated using molecular and cellular biomarkers (in blood, urine, or feces), functional and structural vascular parameters and diseases featuring a premature onset of aging.

        <p>Accordingly, women have longer telomeres (4), lower DNAmAges (4,10,12), and lower CACSs (38) than agematched men. This sex-dependent effect can be partially attributed to the vasculoprotective role of estrogen (47). There is also a possible adverse impact of testosterone on aging because eunuchs were reported to live longer than noncastrated men of the same socioeconomic status (48). Yet, the impact of testosterone on cardiovascular health remains controversial (49).Accordingly, women have longer telomeres (4), lower DNAmAges (4,10,12), and lower CACSs (38) than agematched men.

        <p>Health span and longevity are also crucially influenced by inheritable factors, mostly genetic and epigenetic. For example, family CVD history increases future CVD risk from 40% to 75% depending on the degree of relatedness (50). Moreover, many genetic variants are associated with an exceptionally long life span (51), and offspring of centenarians show signs of low epigenetic age in blood cells (52). There are also ethnic differences in various measures of biological age and CVD morbidity and mortality (38,53). Nevertheless, a meta-analysis of twin studies revealed that genetics accounts for only 20% to 30% of the life span variation (54), indicating that aging and longevity are significantly modulated by other factors, such as environment and lifestyle.Health span and longevity are also crucially influenced by inheritable factors, mostly genetic and epigenetic.

During postnatal life, the pace of biological aging can be affected by a wide range of environmental and lifestyle factors. Physical inactivity is a major mortality risk factor, and even small amounts of exercise reduce CVD and all-cause mortality (60,61). Another key modulator of vascular Changes in dietary composition can also have a strong modulatory effect on aging and vascular disease. For example, the Mediterranean and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diets reduce longterm weight gain and are associated with a lower risk of adverse clinical events (62). Likewise, high vegetable and fruit intake is associated with improved endothelial function and decreased arterial stiffness and blood pressure (63,82). Arterial function can be improved and CVD risk reduced by the consumption of cocoa, tea, coffee, fermented dairy products, fish, nuts, seeds, whole grains, legumes, and olive oil (63). Furthermore, dietary sodium restriction lowers blood pressure and reduces arterial stiffness (82).Autopsy studies have detected atherosclerotic lesions in arteries of fetuses and neonates of smoker or hypercholesterolemic mothers (57,58), possibly reflecting epigenetic alterations (59).
