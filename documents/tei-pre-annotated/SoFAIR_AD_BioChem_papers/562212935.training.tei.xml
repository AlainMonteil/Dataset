        <p>Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease characterized by coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, variable airflow limitation and airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) 1 to environmental specific (allergens such as house dust mite (HDM), pollen and animal dander) and nonspecific (eg tobacco smoke, air pollution) stimuli. Asthma is a heterogeneous disease with a complex aetiology. Allergen-induced asthma is the most common form, with atopy and allergic sensitization being identified as major risk factors. 2 Other risk factors include increased viral infections during early childhood, exposure to tobacco smoke and air pollution. 3 InAsthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease characterized by coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, variable airflow limitation and airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) 1 to environmental specific (allergens such as house dust mite (HDM), pollen and animal dander) and nonspecific (eg tobacco smoke, air pollution) stimuli.

        <p>addition to elevated serum IgE, features of atopic asthma include chronic eosinophilic airway inflammation and airway remodelling with increased smooth muscle mass, subepithelial fibrosis, epithelial desquamation and goblet cell hyperplasia. Type-2T-helper (Th2) lymphocytes are key players in the eosinophilic airway inflammatory response of allergen-sensitized individuals, giving rise to the pathological changes and clinical symptoms of asthma. 4 Other asthma endotypes include nonallergic eosinophilic asthma, which may be driven by type-2 innate lymphocytes, mixed-granulocytic asthma, type-1 and type-17-mediated neutrophilic asthma, and paucigranulocytic asthma, without apparent neutrophilia and eosinophilia. 5 Susceptibility to asthma has a strong genetic component. Many asthma susceptibility genes are expressed in the airway epithelium (eg IL1RL1, IL33, TSLP, CDHR3, PCDH1, MUC5AC, KIF3A, EFHC1 and GSDMB, as outlined below), highlighting the importance of the airway epithelium in the development of asthma. Allergens, viruses and other inhaled environmental insults are in first contact with the airway epithelial barrier, which forms a continuous lining of the respiratory system from the nose to the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles and finally the alveoli. The upper airway epithelium has a different developmental origin than the epithelia of the lower airway and alveolar epithelium. The nature of the epithelium changes in the specific regions, being a pseudostratified columnar epithelium in the nose, trachea and bronchi, transitioning into cuboidal cells in the bronchioles and forming a single-cell thick alveolar epithelium. The alveolar epithelium is highly vascularized and responsible for gas exchange. The alveoli receive air from the conducting airways, starting in the trachea, bifurcating into the bronchi and bronchioles and ending in the terminal bronchioles, which divide into the alveolar ducts from which the alveoli arise. The transitional region between terminal bronchioles and alveoli is referred to as the bronchioalveolar duct junction. Alveolar cells can be subdivided into alveolar type 1 (AT1) epithelial cells, flat-shaped epithelial cells that accommodate the transfer of oxygen into the blood stream and cuboidal-shaped AT2 cells that serve as progenitor cells for AT1 cells, contribute to alveolar tissue regeneration upon injury and produce surfactants to reduce the surface tension. The pseudostratified epithelial layer of the conducting airways is separated from the underlying mesenchyme by the basement membrane and consists of different epithelial cell types: basal, club, goblet and ciliated cells being the major ones. Basal cells serve as progenitors, being able to differentiate into secretory club cells, which can further differentiate into mucus producing goblet cells or mucus clearing ciliated cells. 6 Club cells are able to self-renew and generate ciliated cells after injury, repopulating damaged airway tissue. Secretory cells also have the capacity to dedifferentiate into basal cells when these cells are ablated by diphteria toxin, underscoring the remarkable plasticity of the airway epithelium. 7 While some studies have shown that ciliated cells are terminally differentiated, 8 others have shown that ciliated cells can undergo dynamic changes in cell shape and gene expression to re-differentiate into columnar cells upon naphthalene induced injury. 9 In the presence of IL-13, ciliated cells also undergo transdifferentiation into goblet cells. 10 In addition to the physical barrier function and mucociliary clearance of foreign particles, the airway epithelium acts as chemical barrier against environmental insults by secreting, for example antimicrobial peptides, anti-proteases and antioxidants, and is part of the innate immune • Single-cell RNA-sequencing studies may lead to elucidating the cellular changes and causal gene regulatory networks underlying the different asthma endotypes.addition to elevated serum IgE, features of atopic asthma include chronic eosinophilic airway inflammation and airway remodelling with increased smooth muscle mass, subepithelial fibrosis, epithelial desquamation and goblet cell hyperplasia.

        <p>One of the key features of epithelial remodelling in asthma is the loss of cell-cell contact proteins, which mechanically connect adjacent epithelial cells, thereby keeping the barrier intact. These intercellular junctions are mainly comprised of tight junctions (TJs), which are located most apically, adherens junctions (AJs) and (hemi)desmosomes, which are located basolaterally (Figure 2). Desmosomes form adhesive bonds with the filament cytoskeleton between adjacent cells or between cells and the lamina propria by nonclassical cadherins. 22 The major constituent of AJs is transmembrane protein E-cadherin. Its extracellular domain binds homotypically to neighbouring cells, while the intracellular domain is linked to the actin cytoskeleton by a microtubule network of p120-catenin, β-catenin and α-catenin proteins, providing mechanical support and intracellular signalling. E-cadherin is thought to be crucial for formation of all other junctions, and its disruption results in delocalization of TJ proteins. 23,24 TJs are composed of the transmembrane proteins zona occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin, claudins and junction adhesion molecules (JAMs) and are the main regulators of epithelial permeability. 25 Disrupted expression of E-cadherin, β-catenin, ZO-1 and occludin has been observed in airway epithelium of asthma patients, 20,26,27 leading to impaired barrier function. 19,28 In murine studies, it has been demonstrated that the junctional proteins Zo-1, Tjp2, Occludin and Claudins-5,-8,-18 and -23 are decreased in all the three chronic HDM models of eosinophilic, neutrophilic and mixed granulocyte experimental asthma. 29 Animal models have also demonstrated that lung epithelial-specific deficiency of E-cadherin results in epithelial denudation with specific loss of ciliated cells 30 and that loss of E-cadherin in club cells induces their proliferation while inhibiting differentiation, impairing epithelial repair upon injury. 31 Expression of E-cadherin may not only be critical for the formation of a functionally intact epithelial layer, as downregulation of E-cadherin is also crucial for epithelial plasticity, where cells lose their epithelial phenotype and gain mesenchymal characteristics, termed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). 32 Loss of E-cadherin releases β-catenin into the cytoplasm, where it is normally proteolytically degraded by a destruction complex including glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β. Inactivation of GSK-3β, for example by active WNT signalling or TGF-β, prevents the degradation of β-catenin, resulting in nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation. Active β-catenin, especially when bound to co-activator CREB-binding protein (CBP), promotes the expression of E-cadherin repressors such as Snail and Slug as well as various mesenchymal genes, including fibronectin, EGF receptor (EGFR) and VEGF, which may contribute to airway wall remodelling. 22 The initial induction of a mesenchymal phenotype enables epithelial repair, promoting cell migration and proliferation.One of the key features of epithelial remodelling in asthma is the loss of cell-cell contact proteins, which mechanically connect adjacent epithelial cells, thereby keeping the barrier intact.

        <p>In asthma, this repair process may be disturbed, which is supported by the observed increase in basal cell markers (eg cytokeratin 5 and p63) 22 and repair markers (eg TGF-β and EGFR) in the airway epithelium, representing a more proliferative, less differentiated phenotype. 22 HDM facilitates TGF-β-induced EMT in airway epithelial cells in vitro 33 and induces EMT-like features in the airway epithelium of mice. 34 In asthma, epithelial cells are more susceptible to undergo TGF-β-induced EMT. 35 The Notch signalling pathway also plays a crucial role in controlling the fate of airway epithelial cells upon injury. Although the mechanisms by which Notch signalling modulates epithelial homeostasis and responses to environmental insults are incompletely understood, various Notch (target) genes are differently expressed in healthy and asthmatic airway epithelium. 36,37 The inability to reconstitute epithelial barrier function may have important pathophysiological consequences, not only resulting in increased permeability to allergens, but also propagating pro-inflammatory and abnormal repair responses in the airways, leading to airway hyper-responsiveness and airway remodelling 16 (Figure 3). Accordingly, airway epithelial damage has been shown to correlate with the severity of AHR. 38 Furthermore, the knock-down of E-cadherin in vitro resulted in EGFR activation and pro-inflammatory responses. 32 Upon loss of E-cadherin in vivo, the loss of ciliated cells was accompanied by spontaneous goblet cell metaplasia and infiltration of eosinophils and dendritic cells. 22 These features may at least in part be mediated by activation of β-catenin, as inhibition of β-catenin downstream activity attenuated airway inflammation, smooth muscle thickness, supepithelial fibrosis, hyper-responsiveness and F I G U R E 2 Schematic representation of the basic structural components of epithelial junctions.

        <p>As described above, the development of asthma results from the interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Various in vitro studies have shown that allergens can disrupt the airway epithelial barrier. 41 Exposure of cultured airway epithelial cells to proteolytically active allergens from house dust mites (eg Der p1), ragweed, white birch, grass and pollen can lead to the cleavage of the junctional proteins. 22 Furthermore, house dust mite (HDM), cockroach, fungi and mould extracts have been shown to disrupt epithelial junctions via activation of PAR-2 and downstream signalling. 42 Accordingly, exposure of human airway epithelial cells to HDM induces rapid, transient reduction in epithelial barrier function, 33 concomitant with delocalization of junctional proteins (Figure 3). Submerged cultures of airway epithelial cells from mild/moderate asthma patients were more susceptible to HDM-induced barrier dysfunction than healthy subject-derived cultures. Surprisingly, this was independent of serine and cysteine proteases. 43,44 Yet to be identified PRRs coupled to Ca 2+ /calpaindependent disruption of epithelial junctions may be involved. 43 In addition to direct effects of allergens, allergic sensitization may F I G U R E 3 Proposed model of house dust mite (HDM)-induced airway epithelium barrier dysfunction. Allergens including HDM can directly cleave epithelial junctions proteolytically or act on various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including PAR-2, C-type lectins (CLR) and purinergic receptors. Their activation can induce degradation and/or delocalization of junctional proteins, including E-cadherin, in which intracellular Ca 2+ signalling and subsequent activation of calpain may be involved and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. 161 EGFR can activate ADAM10, a sheddase of E-cadherin as well as CCL20. 40 In addition, EGFR signalling can induce secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as CCL20, CCL17 and GM-CSF that attract and/or activate dendritic cells (DCs), Th2 cells and eosinophils (EOS). 22 When epithelial repair and re-differentiation is impaired, persistent loss of E-cadherin can result in activation of β-catenin-mediated programs that cause further loss of epithelial characteristics, induction of a more basal/mesenchymal phenotype as well as goblet cell hyperplasia, with loss of ciliated cells, as is also characteristic of the epithelial phenotype in asthma lead to epithelial barrier dysfunction as consequence of type-2 mediated airway inflammation associated with atopic asthma.As described above, the development of asthma results from the interaction between genetic and environmental factors.

        <p>Both Th2 cells and ILC2 may contribute to the compromised epithelial barrier function through IL-13 secretion, which induces many features of the airway epithelium in asthma, including mucus production, and has been reported to disrupt airway epithelial barrier function in vitro. 45,46 In fact, Th2-derived IL-13 and IL-4 and type-2 driving cytokine TSLP 47 have been shown to decrease barrier integrity in air-liquid interface (ALI) cultured primary airway epithelial cells from healthy subjects, with delocalization of TJ proteins. 48 This was not observed in cultures derived from asthma subjects, in which barrier function was already compromised at baseline. 48 This may reflect cell-intrinsic loss of airway epithelial cells in asthma to re-differentiate and form an effective barrier upon ALI culture in vitro, as proposed previously. 2 In addition to allergens, early-life sensitization to lower respiratory viral infections is an important environmental risk factor for developing asthma in childhood, with the highest risk for progression to persistent asthma when these environmental exposures coincide. 49 Two major respiratory viruses, rhinovirus (RV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), bind to specific receptors on the airway epithelium, for example cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) and ICAM-1 for RV 50 and CX3CR1 for RSV. 51 Upon internalization, uncoating and replication, the virus is recognized by TLR3 and RIG-I like helicase, inducing production of anti-viral type-I interferons (IFNs), which eradicate pathogens and promote pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Impaired epithelial barrier function is accompanied by compromised IFN responses in asthma, resulting in increased viral replication upon rhinovirus infection compared to nonasthma-derived epithelial cultures. 52 Exposure of airway epithelial cells to double-stranded RNA or infection with RV or RSV in vitro induces upregulation of TSLP 53,54 and may thus support type-2 mediated inflammation. This may further impair epithelial barrier function in a vicious circle, viral exposure causing disruption of epithelial cell-cell contacts. 55,56 RV has been shown to disrupt TJ integrity in human bronchial epithelial cell lines and ALI-differentiated primary cultures via loss of ZO-1 from TJs and airway epithelial cells cultures from healthy and asthmatic children, with more pronounced and sustained effects in asthmatic-derived cultures. 57 Other environmental factors that may impact on epithelial integrity are those associated with nonatopic forms of asthma, for example noneosinophilic, neutrophilic asthma. Besides viral infections, these include smoking 58 and bacterial colonization. 21 Smoke exposure is well known to cause airway epithelial barrier dysfunction by disruption epithelial junctions. 59 Indirectly, smoking-induced Th17-mediated inflammation can reduce epithelial barrier function through Th17 cytokine IL-17. 58 As colonization of the respiratory tract with bacteria, for example Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis, may increase the risk of asthma, it is of relevance that also bacteria can cause epithelial barrier dysfunction, as demonstrated for infection with S pneumonia in a bronchial epithelial cell line. 60 Finally, environmental pollutants such as particulate matter and ozone as well as household cleaning products may contribute to the development and/or worsening of asthma 61 and can disrupt the epithelial barrier. Particulate matter has been shown to attenuate ciliary beat frequency in bronchial epithelial cells and degrade TJ proteins in lung epithelial cells. 62 Diesel exhaust particles decreased the expression of TJ proteins and epithelial resistance in primary nasal epithelial cells. 63 Ozone was reported to cause rapid disruption of the epithelial barrier with increased permeability and diminished expression of TJ and AJ proteins in the absence of IL-33. 64 Of interest, also laundry detergents were recently shown to compromise human bronchial epithelial integrity by disruption of tight junctions and may thus contribute to the development of asthma. 65Both Th2 cells and ILC2 may contribute to the compromised epithelial barrier function through IL-13 secretion, which induces many features of the airway epithelium in asthma, including mucus production, and has been reported to disrupt airway epithelial barrier function in vitro. 45,46 In fact, Th2-derived IL-13 and IL-4 and type-2 driving cytokine TSLP 47 have been shown to decrease barrier integrity in air-liquid interface (ALI) cultured primary airway epithelial cells from healthy subjects, with delocalization of TJ proteins. 48 This was not observed in cultures derived from asthma subjects, in which barrier function was already compromised at baseline. 48 This may reflect cell-intrinsic loss of airway epithelial cells in asthma to re-differentiate and form an effective barrier upon ALI culture in vitro, as proposed previously. 2 In addition to allergens, early-life sensitization to lower respiratory viral infections is an important environmental risk factor for developing asthma in childhood, with the highest risk for progression to persistent asthma when these environmental exposures coincide. 49 Two major respiratory viruses, rhinovirus (RV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), bind to specific receptors on the airway epithelium, for example cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) and ICAM-1 for RV 50 and CX3CR1 for RSV. 51 Upon internalization, uncoating and replication, the virus is recognized by TLR3 and RIG-I like helicase, inducing production of anti-viral type-I interferons (IFNs), which eradicate pathogens and promote pro-inflammatory cytokine release.

Besides viral infections, these include smoking 58 and bacterial colonization. 21 Smoke exposure is well known to cause airway epithelial barrier dysfunction by disruption epithelial junctions. 59 Indirectly, smoking-induced Th17-mediated inflammation can reduce epithelial barrier function through Th17 cytokine IL-17. 58 As colonization of the respiratory tract with bacteria, for example Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis, may increase the risk of asthma, it is of relevance that also bacteria can cause epithelial barrier dysfunction, as demonstrated for infection with S pneumonia in a bronchial epithelial cell line. 60 Finally, environmental pollutants such as particulate matter and ozone as well as household cleaning products may contribute to the development and/or worsening of asthma 61 and can disrupt the epithelial barrier. Particulate matter has been shown to attenuate ciliary beat frequency in bronchial epithelial cells and degrade TJ proteins in lung epithelial cells. 62 Diesel exhaust particles decreased the expression of TJ proteins and epithelial resistance in primary nasal epithelial cells. 63 Ozone was reported to cause rapid disruption of the epithelial barrier with increased permeability and diminished expression of TJ and AJ proteins in the absence of IL-33. 64 Of interest, also laundry detergents were recently shown to compromise human bronchial epithelial integrity by disruption of tight junctions and may thus contribute to the development of asthma. 65</p>
        <p>As mentioned above, in addition to environmental factors, a heredity component contributes to disease risk, with 35%-95% of susceptibility thought to involve genetic factors. Positional cloning and more recently genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been highly successful in identifying risk alleles and loci for asthma and related phenotypes. 66 Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies in human bronchial epithelial cells and bronchial alveolar lavage identified that risk alleles regulate highly relevant genes involved in epithelial function, for example IL1RL1, IL33, TSLP, HLA-DQB1, CDHR3, ZTB10, Corf30, DEX1 and GSDMB levels. 67 Similarly, Luo and colleagues combined asthma GWAS results and small and large airway epithelial eQTL data to demonstrate enrichment of airway epithelial eQTLs. 68 This supports the barrier hypothesis, where genetic alterations influence the ability of the skin and epithelial tissues to form a protective barrier from, for example pathogens and allergens. 1 The finding that the majority of genetic variants associated with risk of developing asthma is shared risk factors for the development of atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis 69 further underlines this. Selected genes identified through asthma genetic studies and implicated in epithelial cell function are outlined in Table 1. Genetic changes in the epithelium may thus be important in mediating several aspects of relevance to asthma, including the inflammatory environment, for example IL33, TSLP, IL1RL1, responses to pathogens, for example CDHR3, mucociliary clearance, for example MUC5AC, KIF3A, EFHC1 and cell homeostasis and epithelial integrity, including proliferation, migration, cell-cell adhesion, apoptosis and repair, for example PCDH1, SMAD3, GSDMB, ORMDL3 and PLAUR.As mentioned above, in addition to environmental factors, a heredity component contributes to disease risk, with 35%-95% of susceptibility thought to involve genetic factors.

        <p>KIF3A is thought to function as a molecular motor transporting molecules along microtubules and has also been implicated in ciliary function in epithelial cells. Interestingly, mice deficient in KIF3A in the epithelium is more susceptible to allergen-induced inflammation and epithelial cell apoptosis in an allergic airway model. 71 Mutations within EFHC1 have been associated with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy via a role in motile cilia and in regulating calcium channels. 72,73 Importantly, EFHC1 may be of relevance in cilia function in the airways, being expressed in the tracheal epithelium in mice. Therefore, KIF3A and EFHC1 may in part contribute to poor allergen and mucus clearance from the airways. Recently, in a GWAS of moderate-severe asthma, a signal on chromosome 11 was identified that regulates expression of MUC5AC, 74 the main mucin found in the airways and linked to severe asthma, 75 emphasizing abnormal mucociliary clearance. In a GWAS of asthma with exacerbation, polymorphisms spanning CDHR3 were identified, including coding change Cys529Tyr. 76 CDHR3 is involved in epithelial polarity and cell-cell interactions. As described above, recent data suggest that CDHR3 is the receptor for RV-C and the Cys529Tyr mediates this interaction providing a putative mechanism. Interestingly, CDHR3 knock-down also influences transepithelial resistance. 77 The PCDH1 gene also encodes an adhesion molecule localizes to cell-cell junctions especially in differentiated airway epithelial. 78,79 PCDH1 has a dual function, supporting epithelial barrier function 79 and regulating TGF-β/SMAD3 signalling. 80 Hence, PCDH1 may serve as cellular switch between TGF-β driven EMT and epithelial repair vs epithelial differentiation and barrier formation. The gene ORMDL3 regulates cytosolic Ca 2+ entry by the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca 2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump, which we previously showed to be involved in HDM-induced epithelial barrier dysfunction. 43 Moreover, the ORMDL3 gene product was recently shown to support RV replication in epithelia cells. 81 Finally, GSDMB encodes gasdermin B, which is a member of the gasdermin-domain containing protein family linked to epithelial apoptosis. Recently, it has been shown that GSDMB is elevated in the airway epithelium in asthma. In mice, increased expression led to spontaneous airway hyper-responsiveness, 82 and the GSDMB protein induces pyroptotic cell death in airway epithelium. 83 Although several asthma genes have been shown to act on airway epithelial function, a clear endotype of asthma driven by the loss of epithelial barrier specifically due to these asthma-associated polymorphisms has not been identified.

        <p>As outlined, asthma-associated polymorphisms can directly alter a gene's coding sequences, thereby altering protein function and, consequently, the biology of the airway epithelium. More frequently, however, asthma-associated SNPs have a regulatory effect on gene expression, acting as eQTLs. A recent study shows that almost 59% of the asthma-associated SNPs identified by the Trans-National Asthma Genetic Consortium (TAGC) study is an eQTL in nasal epithelium and that in almost 90% of these cases, this effect is mediated by CpG methylation. 87 Clearly, epigenetic regulation of gene expression is highly relevant to the translation of disease susceptibility into altered biology of the airway epithelium. Epigenetic marks are highly responsive to environmental exposures relevant to asthma inception or exacerbations, further underscoring the relevance of epigenetics for understanding asthma pathophysiology. [88][89][90][91] Three main types of epigenetic marks can be distinguished: CpG methylation, histone modifications and small, noncoding RNAs.As outlined, asthma-associated polymorphisms can directly alter a gene's coding sequences, thereby altering protein function and, consequently, the biology of the airway epithelium.

        <p>Differences in DNA methylation patterns between asthma patients and healthy controls have been studied in (epi)genome-wide analyses (EWAS). As CpG methylation patterns are also highly celltype dependent, cell-type composition of the biological sample is an important cofounder of EWAS analyses. 92 Therefore, we here focus on the studies in upper (nasal) airway brushes, that mainly consist of epithelial cells, 93 and which were shown to have the best correlation to the DNA methylation patterns in bronchial epithelial cells. 94 In four studies reported to date, [95][96][97][98] methylation of the GJA4 gene, encoding Connexin37, a protein capable of forming heterotypic gap junctions, was consistently found to be reduced, although an association with altered gene expression levels was not detected. 97 Other genes relevant to epithelial barrier function (CDH26, CDHR3) were also found differentially methylated. 95,97 In addition to CDHR3, another genes selectively expressed in ciliated epithelial cells, ZMYND10 91 was found to be differentially methylated, which is consistent with an altered airway epithelial composition in asthma. Only one study to date analysed CpG methylation in bronchial biopsies from asthma patients and healthy controls, but this analysis was focussed on methylation patterns associated with remission of asthma. 99 Several studies have looked specifically into DNA methylation changes induced by relevant environmental factors, which affect epigenetic regulation of asthma genes. [100][101][102] RV infection-induced DNA methylation patterns differed between nasal epithelial cells from asthmatic children and healthy controls, with enrichment for loci carrying genes involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. 100 Similarly, RV infection-induced DNA methylation patterns differed between nasal epithelial cells from asthmatic adults and healthy controls. 102 In children who had early-life rhinovirus-induced wheezing, specific DNA methylation patterns associated with asthma later in life were identified, including increased methylation at the SMAD3 locus. 101 Finally, one elegant study analysed the effects of diesel exhaust particle exposure and (segmental) allergen challenge on DNA methylation patterns in airway epithelial cells obtained by bronchial brushing both 48 hours after exposure and after 4 weeks. 103 While both allergen challenge and diesel exhaust particle exposure induced DNA methylation changes in airway epithelial cells, the most pronounced effects were observed in individuals who received an allergen challenge 4 weeks prior to exhaust particles exposure, with genes annotated to cell adhesion being most enriched in the differentially methylated regions. 103 These data clearly indicate the relevance of environmental exposures for epigenetic regulation of gene expression in the airway epithelium and therefore for asthma. As the epigenetic signature of the airway epithelium integrates genetic susceptibility with the life history of relevant environmental exposures, it can be expected to be a strong biomarker for asthma development or even treatment response. 98 In addition to DNA methylation, epithelial gene expression can be modulated by miRNAs, which are small noncoding RNAs of about 21-25 nucleotides that can bind to target mRNAs, leading to mRNA degradation or translational repression. Altered miRNA profiles have been observed in airway epithelium of asthma patients compared to healthy controls. 104,105 Several of the differentially expressed miRNAs modulate the expression of genes implicated in epithelial barrier function, repair, proliferation or apoptosis. For example, miR-744, miR-19a, miR-221, miR-27a, miR-128 and miR-34/449 are differentially expressed in bronchial epithelial cells from asthma patients compared to controls and have been described to modulate cell proliferation, apoptosis and ciliogenesis by targeting TGF-β1, TGF-βR2, SIRT1, SMAD2 (target of both miR-27a and miR-128) and Cp110, respectively (Figure 4). [106][107][108][109][110][111] Of interest, the discussed miRNAs were not all identified in patients with the same disease severity. The differential expression of miR-744, miR-221 and miR-19 was shown in HBEC from severe asthma patients with an atopic and eosinophilic phenotype, [106][107][108] whereas miR-34/449 was identified in mild atopic asthma. 105 While miR-19 was higher in severe atopic eosinophilic asthma, its expression in mild asthma was similar as in healthy controls. 108 compared to healthy controls. 106 These observations suggest that the impact of the miRNAs on the epithelium can differ with disease severity; however, this requires further investigation. It is also unknown whether miRNAs that affect epithelial barrier in asthma modify the treatment response, but for miR-34/449, miR-19 and miR-223, there were no correlations between miRNA expression and treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. 105,108,112 Furthermore, miR-155 and miR-223 have been implicated in EMT by altering mesenchymal markers, 112,113 although their exact role in asthma airway epithelial cells is unknown.Differences in DNA methylation patterns between asthma patients and healthy controls have been studied in (epi)genome-wide analyses (EWAS).

        <p>Also, differential expression of miR-3162, miR-125b, miR-223 and miR-330 in blood or sputum from asthma patients, possibly transported in extracellular vesicles (EVs), can affect the epithelial barrier function by influencing the expression of, for example β-catenin, vimentin and mucins 112,[114][115][116][117] (Figure 4). Moreover, airway epithelium itself can communicate by secreting EVs. Epithelial-derived EVs play a role in airway homeostasis and airway epithelial remodelling by inducing amongst others mucin hypersecretion. 117 The miRNA signature in epithelial-derived EVs is altered upon stimulation with IL-13 compared to EVs obtained from untreated bronchial epithelial cells. 118 However, it is unclear whether similar changes can be observed in the miRNA profile of epithelial-derived EVs from asthma patients and whether those changes in miRNA expression affect the epithelial barrier. In asthma murine models, lower miR-448-5p and higher miR-106a levels were expressed in lung tissue compared to control mice. 111,119 In vitro up-or downregulation of these miRNAs resulted in altered protein levels of E-cadherin, fibronectin, collagen IV and vimentin in bronchial epithelial cells after TGF-β1 stimulation. 111,119 Together, the interaction between genetic factors and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms may contribute to abnormalities in the airway epithelium and the development of asthma. Understanding these mechanisms may lead to identification of novel targets in airway epithelium for asthma intervention. Using these technologies to study lung tissue, the ionocyte has recently been discovered as novel airway epithelial cell. 6,121 The pulmonary ionocyte is a relatively rare cell type, characterized by expression of ion transporters including V-ATPase and the cystic fibrosis CFTR gene, indicating a role in regulation of ion and fluid transport across the airway epithelium as well as pH of the mucosal surface. While the application of these technologies to identify all cell types of the healthy human body, including lung, as pursued by the Human Cell Atlas consortium 122,123 are exciting, these novel techniques also hold great potential to increase our understanding of disease pathogenesis.Also, differential expression of miR-3162, miR-125b, miR-223 and miR-330 in blood or sputum from asthma patients, possibly transported in extracellular vesicles (EVs), can affect the epithelial barrier function by influencing the expression of, for example β-catenin, vimentin and mucins 112,[114][115][116][117] (Figure 4).

        <p>A first description of the cellular landscape of healthy airway wall and the changes thereof in patients with childhood-onset allergic asthma identified a unique disease-associated airway epithelial cell state, as well as a remarkable shift in cell-cell communication. 93 Various known changes in the asthmatic airway wall were recapitulated by scRNA-Seq analysis, such as increased numbers of airway smooth muscle cells, goblet cells and mast cells, underscoring the validity of the approach (Figure 5). The study identified a subset of ciliated epithelial cells in asthma that was characterized by expression of MUC5AC and other goblet-cell genes, a molecular phenotype of ciliated cells that was not observed in healthy airway walls. 93 This so-called mucous ciliated cell type was mapped to the ciliated differentiation trajectory.A first description of the cellular landscape of healthy airway wall and the changes thereof in patients with childhood-onset allergic asthma identified a unique disease-associated airway epithelial cell state, as well as a remarkable shift in cell-cell communication. 93 Various known changes in the asthmatic airway wall were recapitulated by scRNA-Seq analysis, such as increased numbers of airway smooth muscle cells, goblet cells and mast cells, underscoring the validity of the approach (Figure 5).

        <p>Interestingly, these mucous ciliated cells as well as the goblet cells in asthma lacked expression of Notch target genes, but instead expressed a signature of IL4/IL13-induced genes, which was in contrast to the (few) goblet cells present in airway wall from healthy donors.Interestingly, these mucous ciliated cells as well as the goblet cells in asthma lacked expression of Notch target genes, but instead expressed a signature of IL4/IL13-induced genes, which was in contrast to the (few) goblet cells present in airway wall from healthy donors.</p>
        <p>Therefore, mucous ciliated cells were proposed to represent a transitional cell state in the ciliated lineage-induced by IL-4/IL-13 signalling-leading to a mucous cell phenotype that contributes to mucous cell metaplasia in asthma. 93 As these pathogenic Th2 effector cells were exclusively observed in asthmatic airway walls, and the mucous ciliated cells showed evidence of IL-13-induced gene transcription, it seems likely that Th2 cytokines are responsible for these cell state changes in the asthmatic airway epithelium. Indeed, Th2 effector cells were found to dominate the predicted airway wall cell-cell interactome in asthma. 93 We previously reported that Th2 cytokine production was suppressed by primary bronchial epithelial cells, a regulatory mechanism that seems to be attenuated in asthma. 124 The airway wall cellular interactome analysis also identified cell-cell communication between epithelial cells and other structural or tissue-resident cells, characterized by growth factor signalling. This interaction was present in healthy airway wall, but lost in asthma. 93 Therefore, it will be of great interest to study which cell-cell interactions observed in healthy airway wall maintain the barrier function of airway epithelium, and how these can be restored in the asthmatic condition. Future studies in larger cohorts of patients and controls, as well as in a larger variety of asthma subphenotypes also hold the promise of charting the cellular changes and causal gene regulatory networks underlying a wider variety of asthma endotypes.

        <p>The majority of patients respond well to a combination of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and bronchodilators. Whether or not ICS have direct beneficial effects on epithelial health or barrier function is unclear. Although corticosteroids failed to prevent the TGF-β-induced downregulation of E-cadherin in a bronchial epithelial cell line, 128 findings in primary bronchial epithelial cells indicate that ICS protect against oxidative stress-induced epithelial barrier dysfunction. 129 However, asthma epithelium was found less responsive to ICS. 129 Oxidative stress as well as IL-17 may lead to ICS unresponsiveness by PI3K-dependent post-translational histone deacetylase (HDAC)2 modifications and proteasomal HDAC2 degradation. 130,131 Strategies to restore ICS sensitivity could be beneficial in improving epithelialThe majority of patients respond well to a combination of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and bronchodilators.

        <p>The shared genetic origin of asthma, rhinitis and eczema was recently analysed in detail.133 This approach revealed a striking overlap in risk SNPs between these three allergic disorders, with limited disease-specific polymorphisms. The study identified a total of 132 plausible target genes, which were enriched for expression in blood and lung tissue.133 These results clearly indicate that susceptibility to allergic diseases is mediated by at least in part shared biological mechanisms. Loss of epithelial barrier function has indeed been postulated as a central mechanism in allergic rhinitis134 and eczema135 as well, with loss of function variants in epidermal protein filaggrin being identified as major predisposing factor of atopic dermatitis.136 In addition, GWAS studies have identified epithelial junction protein Desmoglein 1 as susceptibility gene for eosinophilic esophagitis.137The shared genetic origin of asthma, rhinitis and eczema was recently analysed in detail.133 This approach revealed a striking overlap in risk SNPs between these three allergic disorders, with limited disease-specific polymorphisms.

        <p>The airway epithelial phenotype induced by the interaction of genotype and environment plays a central role in the pathogenesis of asthma. Accumulating evidence indicates that multiple genetic variants associated with the risk of developing asthma in response to environmental factors regulate proteins of relevance to airway epithelial function, including roles in barrier function, inflammation, mucociliary clearance and homeostasis. In addition, alterations in epigenetic regulation contribute to abnormalities in the biology of the airway epithelium in asthma. Further insight into these regulatory mechanisms, for example by the use of scRNA-seq, holds promise for identifying patients likely to benefit from epithelialfocused therapies and the identification of targets for novel therapies strategies aimed at correcting dysfunctional epithelial barrier.The airway epithelial phenotype induced by the interaction of genotype and environment plays a central role in the pathogenesis of asthma.
