        <p>The bacterial phylum Bacteroidetes, characterized by a distinct gliding motility, occurs in a broad variety of ecosystems, habitats, life styles, and physiologies. Accordingly, taxonomic classification of the phylum, based on a limited number of features, proved difficult and controversial in the past, for example, when decisions were based on unresolved phylogenetic trees of the 16S rRNA gene sequence. Here we use a large collection of type-strain genomes from Bacteroidetes and closely related phyla for assessing their taxonomy based on the principles of phylogenetic classification and trees inferred from genome-scale data. No significant conflict between 16S rRNA gene and whole-genome phylogenetic analysis is found, whereas many but not all of the involved taxa are supported as monophyletic groups, particularly in the genome-scale trees. Phenotypic and phylogenomic features support the separation of Balneolaceae as new phylum Balneolaeota from Rhodothermaeota and of Saprospiraceae as new class Saprospiria from Chitinophagia. Epilithonimonas is nested within the older genus Chryseobacterium and without significant phenotypic differences; thus merging the two genera is proposed. Similarly, Vitellibacter is proposed to be included in Aequorivita. Flexibacter is confirmed as being heterogeneous and dissected, yielding six distinct genera. Hallella seregens is a later heterotypic synonym of Prevotella dentalis. Compared to values directly calculated from genome sequences, the G+C content mentioned in many species descriptions is too imprecise; moreover, corrected G+C content values have a significantly better fit to the phylogeny. Corresponding emendations of species descriptions are provided where necessary. Whereas most observed conflict with the current classification of Bacteroidetes is already visible in 16S rRNA gene trees, as expected whole-genome phylogenies are much better resolved.The bacterial phylum Bacteroidetes, characterized by a distinct gliding motility, occurs in a broad variety of ecosystems, habitats, life styles, and physiologies.

        <p>Bacteroidetes comprise bacteria widespread in the biosphere and isolated from many distinct habitats, including temperate, tropical and polar ecosystems (Krieg et al., 2010;Thomas et al., 2011). Bacteroides are anaerobic and mostly found in the gastrointestinal tract of animals and humans and, besides Firmicutes, even dominates the gut microflora of mammals (Smith et al., 2006;Ley et al., 2009;Thomas et al., 2011). Several Cytophagia were cultured from marine habitats, whereas Cytophaga was found in soils and Cyclobacteriaceae in (hyper-)saline environments only (Krieg et al., 2010). Flavobacteriaceae have colonized many different ecosystems such as soils, sediment, freshwater, brackish water, and seawater in temperate, tropical, and polar ecosystems (Bernardet, 2011). Some Flavobacteriaceae are even pathogenic for humans, other mammals, freshwater fish or marine fish. However, Blattabacteriaceae are endosymbiotic bacteria (e.g., in termites and cockroaches), whereas Cryomorphaceae mostly live in cold, marine environments (Bowman et al., 2003). The wide variety of habitats reflects the importance of Bacteroidetes in biogeochemical processes. For instance, aquatic, terrestrial and gut Bacteroidetes are well known for their functional specialization on the decomposition of peptides and polysaccharides (Kirchman, 2002;Bowman, 2006;Thomas et al., 2011;Fernández-Gómez et al., 2013). This feature is accompanied by a great number and diversity of carbohydrateactive enzymes (Cantarel et al., 2009) in Bacteroidetes genomes (Fernández-Gómez et al., 2013). The corresponding genes cluster together with TonB-dependent transporters in polysaccharideutilization loci (Martens et al., 2009;Sonnenburg et al., 2010;Fernández-Gómez et al., 2013). Genome sequences are expected to support investigating the evolutionary relationship of gut Bacteroidetes and the diet of their hosts, facilitated by lateral gene (carbohydrate-active enzymes) and gene cluster (polysaccharide utilization loci) transfer between environmental and gut Bacteroidetes (Thomas et al., 2011).Bacteroidetes comprise bacteria widespread in the biosphere and isolated from many distinct habitats, including temperate, tropical and polar ecosystems (Krieg et al., 2010;Thomas et al., 2011).

        <p>Bacteroidetes are Gram-stain-negative, chemo-organotrophic rods that do not form endospores and are either non-motile or motile by gliding (Woese, 1987;Paster et al., 1994). Before the phylum was called Bacteroidetes (Krieg et al., 2010), it had been referred to as Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides (Paster et al., 1994;Woese, 1987). The phylum comprises the classes Bacteroidia, Cytophagia, Flavobacteriia, and Sphingobacteriia (Krieg et al., 2010). Recently, the name Bacteroidaeota was proposed for this phylum by including the rank phylum in the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (Oren et al., 2015). As Cytophaga, Flexibacter, and Flavobacterium have many phenotypic characteristics in common, their differentiation used to be based on the presence or absence of gliding motility (Bernardet et al., 1996). However, gliding motility is a common feature of many Bacteroidetes genera (McBride and Zhu, 2013). Cytophaga and Flexibacter were also delineated based on cell morphology, the G+C content as well as the habitats they were isolated from Reichenbach (1989c). The anaerobic Bacteroidia used to be considered separate from the aerobic groups such as Flavobacteriia and Cytophagia, but 16S rRNA gene sequencing clarified their interconnections (Paster et al., 1985;Weisburg et al., 1985;Woese, 1987). Despite its usefulness in resolving such taxonomic questions, the 16S rRNA gene contains only a limited number of characters and thus usually yields only partially resolved phylogenies, i.e., trees with many statistically unsupported branches (Klenk and Göker, 2010;Breider et al., 2014). Recently, Munoz et al. (2016) revised the phylogeny of Bacteroidetes and removed the incertae sedis taxa from the Balneola group and Rhodothermaceae (Bacteroidetes Order II.Bacteroidetes are Gram-stain-negative, chemo-organotrophic rods that do not form endospores and are either non-motile or motile by gliding (Woese, 1987;Paster et al., 1994).

        <p>Indeed, only monophyletic taxa can be accepted in a taxonomic classification because its purpose is to summarize the phylogeny of the classified organisms (Hennig, 1965;Wiley and Lieberman, 2011), and genome-scale data are more promising than single genes, or multi-locus sequence analysis restricted to a low number of genes, to identify monophyletic and nonmonophyletic groups with high confidence (Klenk and Göker, 2010). The phenomenal increase in the number of publicly available whole-genome sequences further demands a genomebased classification system in today's genomic era.Indeed, only monophyletic taxa can be accepted in a taxonomic classification because its purpose is to summarize the phylogeny of the classified organisms (Hennig, 1965;Wiley and Lieberman, 2011), and genome-scale data are more promising than single genes, or multi-locus sequence analysis restricted to a low number of genes, to identify monophyletic and nonmonophyletic groups with high confidence (Klenk and Göker, 2010).

        <p>The genomic G+C content, i.e., the proportion of cytosines and guanines among all nucleotides in the genome, is one of the most frequently used taxonomic markers in microbiology (Mesbah et al., 1989;Rosselló-Mora and Amann, 2001). Within Bacteroidetes, it is strongly recommended to include the G+C content especially when describing every species of Flavobacteriaceae (Bernardet et al., 2002). The rapid progress in sequencing technology (Liu et al., 2012;Mavromatis et al., 2012) allows not only for inferring genome-scale phylogenies (Klenk and Göker, 2010;Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2014a) but also for replacing traditional methods that indirectly determine the G+C content (Mesbah et al., 1989;Moreira et al., 2011) by calculating it directly from highly accurate genome sequences. For this reason, literature claims that the variation of the G+C content within bacterial species is at most 3 mol% (Mesbah et al., 1989) or even up to 5 mol% (Rosselló-Mora and Amann, 2001) can be attributed to the imprecision of traditional methods (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2014c). On the other hand, withinspecies variation is at most 1% when both species boundaries (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2013a) and G+C contents are determined from genome sequences (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2014c). These inconsistencies call for correcting species descriptions that include a conventionally determined G+C content value that differs by more than 1% from the value calculated from the genome sequence of the type strain (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2014c;Riedel et al., 2014). Apparently the same holds if a range of G+C values was provided whose lower or upper bound deviates by more than 1% from the directly calculated G+C value, but a species description should also be restricted if a range of G+C values was provided that, unrealistically, exceeds 1%. Taxa of higher rank should accordingly be emended if their presumed range of G+C values turns out to be in conflict with the information from genome sequences (Scheuner et al., 2014).The genomic G+C content, i.e., the proportion of cytosines and guanines among all nucleotides in the genome, is one of the most frequently used taxonomic markers in microbiology (Mesbah et al., 1989;Rosselló-Mora and Amann, 2001).

        <p>The Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea (GEBA) pilot phase as well as the One Thousand Microbial Genomes phase 1 (KMG-1) projects (Kyrpides et al., 2014) are ideal data sources for genome-scale taxonomic reasoning because these projects aimed at filling the genomic gaps in the bacterial and archaeal branches of the tree of life (Göker and Klenk, 2013) and included only type strains with a certified origin from a culture collection and thus a verifiable history. Using the Bacteroidetes genome sequences from these projects, we here address the following questions: (i) What is the relationship between the phylogenomic trees and the proposed taxonomic classifications or the 16S rRNA gene phylogenies? (ii) Which taxa need to be revised because they are evidently non-monophyletic? (iii) Which taxon descriptions that lack G+C values should be augmented with information from genome sequences? (iv) Which taxon descriptions deviate from G+C content values calculated from genome sequences and should now be emended accordingly?

        <p>The Bacteroidetes (ingroup), Chlorobi, Planctomycetes, and Verrucomicrobia (outgroup) type-strain genomes originating from the GEBA pilot phase and the KMG-1 (Kyrpides et al., 2014) project were downloaded from IMG (Markowitz et al., 2009) and augmented with additional type-strain genomes of taxonomic interest deposited in INSDC. The complete list is found in Supplementary Table 1. Genome-scale phylogenies were inferred from whole proteomes using the high-throughput version (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2014a) of the 
            <rs type="software">Genome BLAST</rs> Distance 
            <rs type="software">Phylogeny</rs> (GBDP) approach (Henz et al., 2005;Auch et al., 2006). 
            <rs type="software">BLAST+</rs> (v
            <rs type="version">2.2.30</rs>) (Camacho et al., 2009) was run in 
            <rs type="software">BLASTP</rs> mode with default parameters except for an e-value filter of 10 -8 (Meier- Kolthoff et al., 2014a). The greedy-with-trimming algorithm, which conducts a correction for non-orthologous hits, was applied in conjunction with formula d 5 , which relates the (weighted) number of identities within 
            <rs type="software">BLAST</rs> hits (high-scoring segment pairs) to the overall length of these hits and thus is unaffected by incomplete genome sequencing, and subjected to 100 pseudo-bootstrap replicates (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2013a, 2014a). Phylogenetic trees were inferred from the original and pseudo-bootstrapped intergenomic distance matrices using 
            <rs type="software">FastME</rs> (Lefort et al., 2015), and tree and support values visualized using ITOL (Letunic and Bork, 2011). Where species affiliations had to be clarified, digital DNA:DNA hybridization was conducted with the recommended settings of the 
            <rs type="software">Genome-To-Genome Distance Calculator (GGDC)</rs> version 
            <rs type="version">2.1</rs> (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2013a).
        </p>
        <p>Comprehensive, aligned, near full-length 16S rRNA gene data for Bacteroidetes and the outgroup phyla were taken from version s123 of the All-Species Living Tree Project (LTP) (Yarza et al., 2008). Sequences of species of interest missing from LTP s123 (see Supplementary File 2) were added to the alignment using POA (Lee et al., 2002). Trees were inferred from the alignment with 
            <rs type="software">RAxML</rs> (Stamatakis, 2014) under the maximumlikelihood (ML) criterion in conjunction with the GTR-CAT model, fast bootstrapping, bootstopping (Pattengale et al., 2010) and subsequent search for the best tree, and with TNT (Goloboff et al., 2008) under the maximum-parsimony criterion (MP); here, new-technology search for the best tree was conducted as well as 1000 bootstrapping replicates in conjunction with tree-bisectionand-reconnection branch swapping and one random sequence addition replicate per bootstrap replicate. Further ML and MP trees were inferred in the same way but using the branches of the GBDP tree with ≥95% support as backbone constraint. Finally, 16S rRNA gene trees reduced to genome-sequenced strains were inferred.
        </p>
        <p>All trees were compared to the current classification used in LTP version s123, which was cleaned from inconsistencies, such as mismatches between species and genus names, and subsequently modified manually in the case of taxonomic arrangements that could not be confirmed in the literature, of validly published synonyms that were in better agreement to the phylogenies, and of missing taxa such as the family for Saccharicrinis (Yang et al., 2014). The full list of changes is described in Supplementary File 2. Whether taxa were monophyletic, paraphyletic or polyphyletic (Farris, 1974;Wood, 1994) was determined using program code developed at DSMZ, which reports, in the case of taxa appearing non-monophyletic in a phylogeny, the highest support of all branches that conflict with the monophyly of that taxon as support against it (that can be displayed as negative support). In a rooted tree, these conflicting branches are the ones connected to subtrees that contain some but not all representatives of the taxon, as well as representatives of other taxa.All trees were compared to the current classification used in LTP version s123, which was cleaned from inconsistencies, such as mismatches between species and genus names, and subsequently modified manually in the case of taxonomic arrangements that could not be confirmed in the literature, of validly published synonyms that were in better agreement to the phylogenies, and of missing taxa such as the family for Saccharicrinis (Yang et al., 2014).

        <p>The (trivial) calculation of the G+C content from genome sequences was done as in a previous study (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2014c) and by the 
            <rs type="software">GGDC</rs> server version 
            <rs type="version">2.1</rs>. The changes in the fit between phylogeny and G+C content data when switching from conventionally calculated values to G+C counts from genome sequences was assessed by calculating their MP score with TNT (Goloboff et al., 2008), which allows for treating continuous characters as such (Goloboff et al., 2006). The data were rescaled to fit in the range between 0 and 65 as necessary for TNT and exported using the 
            <rs type="software">opm</rs> package (Vaas et al., 2013) for 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> (
            <rs type="creator">R Development Core Team</rs>, 2015); species without a literature G+C value were deactivated. To address phylogenetic uncertainty, the difference was re-calculated for each pseudobootstrap tree, and the resulting set of differences tested for its difference from zero using a t-test and Wilcoxon signed rank test as implemented in 
            <rs type="software">R</rs>. Because some G+C contents are given as ranges in the literature, we alternatively assessed minima, averages and maxima of the ranges, combined with the single G+C values from the other sources. For each species, only the most recent emendation that included a G+C content value was considered. Visualization was done with 
            <rs type="software">ggplot</rs>
            <rs type="version">2</rs> (Wickham, 2009). We further investigated the effect of incomplete genome sequencing on the calculation of G+C content values using the simulation techniques from our earlier study (Auch et al., 2010); details are provided in Supplementary File 3.
        </p>
        <p>Figure 1A shows the relationship between conventionally determined G+C content values and those calculated from the genome sequences; Supplementary Table 1 contains all collected data. A total of 161 species descriptions could be confirmed regarding the G+C content, for 45 it was obvious that they should be restricted because the provided G+C content range was unrealistically broad, 119 deviated by more than 1% from the genome sequence, and 24 lacked a G+C content range or value altogether. The MP scores of the conventionally determined and genome-sequence based G+C contents are shown in the Figure 1B. As confirmed by all tests conducted (α &lt; 0.001), it was obvious that the corrected G+C content values display a significantly better fit to the phylogeny than the original ones, and that this progress can be detected even though a large number of the G+C content values needed no correction. The results are in agreement with the simulations to assess the affect of incomplete genome sequencing on the calculation of the G+C content, which showed that the expected deviation from the real value is significantly below 0.1% for the given sequencing quality (Supplementary File 3).Figure 1A shows the relationship between conventionally determined G+C content values and those calculated from the genome sequences; Supplementary Table 1 contains all collected data.

        <p>The underlying GDBP tree is shown in Figures 2-4 together with branch support values, taxonomic annotations and genomic G+C content indicators. Figure 5 compares the positive or negative support values for each taxon implicit in the GBDP (average support over all branches, 92.00%), 16S rRNA gene ML (69.47%), and 16S rRNA gene MP (67.25%) trees. The whole-genome tree supports more taxa than the 16S rRNA gene but also yields conflict in few cases where the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny is inconclusive, whereas several taxa are strongly supported as non-monophyletic by all approaches. However, in contrast to the classification, no well-supported (Taylor and Piel, 2004) discrepancies between the GBDP tree and the 16S rRNA gene trees were detected, as evident from the empty upper left and lower right corners in Figure 5. The unconstrained comprehensive 16S rRNA gene ML and MP trees (UCT) as well as the backbone-constrained ones (CCT) are included in Supplementary File 4. Whereas the majority of taxa appeared monophyletic in our analyses, a couple of discrepancies between the phylogenomic tree and the classification were observed, which we report herein in decreasing order of taxonomic rank involved, along with according suggestions for reclassifications.The underlying GDBP tree is shown in Figures 2-4 together with branch support values, taxonomic annotations and genomic G+C content indicators.

The whole-genome tree supports more taxa than the 16S rRNA gene but also yields conflict in few cases where the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny is inconclusive, whereas several taxa are strongly supported as non-monophyletic by all approaches. However, in contrast to the classification, no well-supported (Taylor and Piel, 2004) discrepancies between the GBDP tree and the 16S rRNA gene trees were detected, as evident from the empty upper left and lower right corners in Figure 5. The unconstrained comprehensive 16S rRNA gene ML and MP trees (UCT) as well as the backbone-constrained ones (CCT) are included in Supplementary File 4.

        <p>All phyla appeared as monophyletic in the GBDP tree (Figure 2). Given their separation from Bacteroidetes, the Balneolia and Rhodothermia could be assigned to a single phylum, Rhodothermaeota (Munoz et al., 2016). However, the 16S rRNA gene alone provides no support for their sistergroup relationship (albeit no significant conflict), and the two groups strongly differ in their genomic G+C content (Figure 2), as previously noted (Urios et al., 2006); none of the remaining phyla show a comparable discrepancy in G+C values. Exactly the same reasons argue against an inclusion of the two groups in the phylum Chlorobi (Figure 2). Moreover, there are considerable phenotypic and habitat differences between the Balneolia and Rhodothermia (Table 1). The Balneolia are mesophilic, whereas Rhodothermia are mostly either strongly thermophilic (Alfredsson et al., 1988) or extremely halophilic (Antón et al., 2002). Carotenoids were only reported from Rhodothermia (Makhdoumi-Kakhki et al., 2012) but not from the Balneolia. For these reasons, the Balneolia and Rhodothermia should not only be removed from Bacteroidetes but also classified in two separate phyla, Rhodothermaeota (Munoz et al., 2016) and Balneolaeota (this study), based on the priority of the respective genus names. A comparable situation has been solved recently for the Ignavibacteriaceae (Iino et al., 2010) and Melioribacteraceae (Podosokorskaya et al., 2013). These taxa have been separated from the Chlorobi as a new phylum Ignavibacteria (Podosokorskaya et al., 2013) based on their physiological distinction and their large phylogenetic distance to Chlorobi.All phyla appeared as monophyletic in the GBDP tree (Figure 2).

        <p>The Balneolaeota (Munoz et al., 2016) and Rhodothermaeota (as suggested here) differ from Bacteroidetes by a considerable number of phenotypic characters. The large amount of phospholipids [diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and phosphatidylcholine (PC)] found in Rhodothermus (and its relatives) is unusual for aerobic Bacteroidetes (Nolan et al., 2009). Polar lipids of Bacteroides comprise largely PE and small amounts of PG and phosphatidylserine (Wardle et al., 1996), whereas polar lipids of the phylum Bacteroidetes usually comprise significant amounts of amide-linked lipids (aminolipids) rather than ester-linked polar lipids (Bernardet, 2010). The most significant difference between the Balneolaeota and Rhodothermaeota on the one hand and Bacteroidetes on the other hand can be attributed to the composition of fatty acids. Characteristic fatty acids of Bacteroidetes are 2-hydroxy and 3-hydroxy fatty acids, predominantly iso-C 17:0 3-OH, iso-C 15:0 3-OH and iso-C 16:0 3-OH (Mayberry, 1980;Krieg et al., 2010), whereas strains of the Balneolaeota and Rhodothermaeota do not possess 2-hydroxy and 3-hydroxy fatty acids (Table 1). Flagella in conjunction with motility were observed in Balneola vulgaris (Urios et al., 2006) and Salinibacter ruber (Antón et al., 2002) but are unusual in Bacteroidetes; conversely, neither gliding motility nor flexirubin, a pigment common in Bacteroidetes (Krieg et al., 2010), were reported for the Balneolaeota and Rhodothermaeota. We suggest according emendations of taxon descriptions.The Balneolaeota (Munoz et al., 2016) and Rhodothermaeota (as suggested here) differ from Bacteroidetes by a considerable number of phenotypic characters.

        <p>With the Balneolaeota and Rhodothermaeota removed from Bacteroidetes, the classes and orders of Bacteroidetes appeared as monophyletic in the GBDP phylogeny (Figure 2) with the sole exception of Chitinophagia and Chitinophagales, which were shown as paraphyletic due to the early branching of Haliscomenobacter, Phaeodactylibacter, and Lewinella (Saprospiraceae). Three branches with weak to moderate (79, 92, and 66%) support, respectively, would need to be wrong to obtain monophyletic Chitinophagia and Chitinophagales. The UCT and CCT show a distinct picture with a monophyletic Chitinophagia and Chitinophagales with 94-99% support under ML and &lt;60-79% support under MP. Thus, regarding the monophyly criterion, it might or might not be adequate to place Saprospiraceae in Chitinophagales according to our analyses. The monophyly of the family itself, including the type genus Saprospira, is supported by the 16S rRNA gene trees with 95-100%. Thus, given its uncertain position relative to the remaining Chitinophagia and Chitinophagales, the taxonomic placement of Saprospiraceae should be reconsidered.With the Balneolaeota and Rhodothermaeota removed from Bacteroidetes, the classes and orders of Bacteroidetes appeared as monophyletic in the GBDP phylogeny (Figure 2) with the sole exception of Chitinophagia and Chitinophagales, which were shown as paraphyletic due to the early branching of Haliscomenobacter, Phaeodactylibacter, and Lewinella (Saprospiraceae).

        <p>The family Saprospiraceae has been proposed first in Bergey's manual (Garrity and Holt, 2001) and was suggested to represent a sister lineage, without confirmatory evidence, to the family Sphingobacteriaceae. Saprospiraceae was later on placed in Chitinophagales but without relevant branch support (Munoz et al., 2016). In contrast to both Sphingobacteriaceae and Chitinophagaceae, Saprospiraceae are long rods (up to 5 µm) that form long filaments (up to 500 µm) and do not possess sphingophospholipids. Moreover, the 16S rRNA gene trees indicate that the group comprising both Saprospiraceae and Chitinophagaceae (which is not even monophyletic in Figure 2) is quite divergent. Based on these results, we propose to classify the family Saprospiraceae into the new order Saprospirales, of the new class Saprospiria. Moreover, some noticeable phenotypical characteristics in agreement with the branching order (Figure 2, Supplementary File 4) call for a split of the family Saprospiraceae into three families (Saprospiraceae, Lewinellaceae, and Haliscomenobacteraceae). Lewinella, Saprospira and Aureispira exhibit gliding motility, but All data are from the original descriptions (Alfredsson et al., 1988;Antón et al., 2002;Choi et al., 2009;Vaisman and Oren, 2009;Marteinsson et al., 2010;Park et al., 2011Park et al., , 2013;;Urios et al., 2006Urios et al., , 2008;;Makhdoumi-Kakhki et al., 2012;Wang et al., 2012Wang et al., , 2013a,b;,b;Cho et al., 2013) except for the polar lipids of Salinibacter ruber (Corcelli et al., 2004) and Salisaeta longa (Baronio et al., 2010).

        <p>A noticeable feature of the current classification of Bacteroidetes is that each class contains only a single order and thus the classification into orders provides no additional information.

        <p>The recently revised (Munoz et al., 2016) Rhodothermales families appeared as monophyletic (Figure 2) but turned out to differ significantly by some key physiological characteristics. Rhodothermus (Rhodothermaceae) tolerates up to 6% NaCl and 70 • C (Table 1). In contrast, Salinibacter and Salisaeta (Salinibacteraceae) thrive in salt lakes and crystallizer ponds and grow at maximum temperatures of 50 • C in medium with at least 5% NaCl and up to saturation (Table 1). Additionally, the polar lipids of Rhodothermus comprise mainly DPG and PE whereas Salinibacter, Salinivenus, and Salisaeta additionally contain PC, glycolipids and halocapnines, while Rubricoccus and Rubrivirga (Rubricoccaceae) contain PG, but no glycolipids (Table 1). Rhodothermus mainly displays saturated fatty acids, whereas Salinibacter, Salinivenus, and Salisaeta contain unsaturated and C 18 fatty acids (Table 1).

        <p>The families within Sphingobacteriales appeared monophyletic throughout with maximum support in the GBDP tree (Figure 2). Within Cytophagales, the situation seems more complex. Cytophagaceae were not shown as monophyletic, since strong conflicting support was present regarding the positioning of Flexibacter and Microscilla, which are currently placed in that family (Nakagawa, 2011b) but here Flexibacter appeared problematic per se and thus is discussed below in more detail.The families within Sphingobacteriales appeared monophyletic throughout with maximum support in the GBDP tree (Figure 2).

        <p>Flexithrix is placed apart from the remaining Flammeovirgaceae (Marivirga, Roseivirga) with 99% support in the GBDP analysis. Flexithrix and Rapidithrix formed a clade with reasonable bootstrap support (always &gt;90%) in the UCT and CCT. Marivirga and Roseivirga did not form a clade either, with a conflicting branch supported by 94% in the GBDP tree. Because of their overall lower resolution, the 16S rRNA gene trees do not indicate in which of these three distinct groups of Flammeovirgaceae its type genus, Flammeovirga, is placed. For this reason, further revisions of Flammeovirgaceae have to be postponed until more genome sequences are available. Based on phylogenetic results (Nakagawa et al., 2002) and a polyphasic approach (Nedashkovskaya et al., 2010), the genus Marivirga was proposed to comprise of M. sericea and M. tractuosa (Nedashkovskaya et al., 2010). However, the physiological differentiation in that study only included Flammeovirgaceae genera (Fabibacter, Fulvivirga, Marinoscillum, Reichenbachiella, Roseivirga), and Thermonema lapsum (Flammeovirgaceae) was used as an outgroup for the 16S rRNA gene sequence-based phylogeny. A similar set of strains was investigated in the description of the two other Marivirga species, M. lumbricoides (Xu et al., 2015) and M. atlantica (Lin C.-Y. et al., 2015). Thus, the strain samplings in those earlier studies did not allow for detecting a closer affiliation of Marivirga to another family, which might explain the conflicting result obtained here.Flexithrix is placed apart from the remaining Flammeovirgaceae (Marivirga, Roseivirga) with 99% support in the GBDP analysis.

A revision of the family is currently already conducted (Hugenholtz, pers. comm.), hence no taxonomic consequences will be undertaken in our study.Within Bacteroidia, Porphyromonadaceae appeared paraphyletic with maximum support against their monophyly in the GBDP analysis (Figure 3), as all other genera were placed in clades distinct from the one harboring Porphyromonas.

        <p>The recent removal of Butyricimonas and Odoribacter from Porphyromonadaceae to place them in the new family Odoribacteraceae (Munoz et al., 2016) also requires some attention.

Butyricimonas and Odoribacter differ from Falsiporphyromonas and Porphyromonas by their fermentative metabolism (Sakamoto et al., 2009) and partially by their lack of pigments (Nagai et al., 2010).

The UCT and CCT also showed Pedobacter distributed over several clades but without significant support against its monophyly.

        <p>Flexibacter (Cytophagaceae) appeared paraphyletic with high confidence in the phylogenomic tree because the clade comprising F. litoralis and F. roseolus (separated by long branches) occurred in clades with 77 and 99% support together with other genera, to the exclusion of F. elegans, which formed the sister group of Microscilla marina with maximum support (Figure 2). A paraphyletic Flexibacter also occurred in the UCT and CCT, with strong support against its monophyly, as F. elegans was also highly supported as sister group of Microscilla marina. F. ruber formed the sister group of that clade without significant support, whereas Flexibacter flexilis Soriano 1945, the type species of the genus (Nakagawa, 2011c), was indeed placed within the Cytophagaceae, with Arcicella, Flectobacillus, and Pseudarcicella as most closely related genera, without much support. Flexibacter litoralis, F. polymorphus, and F. roseolus formed a clade with reasonable bootstrap support (&gt;90% in the CCT), which was placed in an uncertain position. Apart from tree topology, the branch lengths in the whole-genome and 16S rRNA gene tree indicated that the Flexibacter species are too divergent to be placed in a single genus.

        <p>Since its description, eleven of 17 originally supposed Flexibacter species were reclassified into a variety of genera (Chitinophaga, Flavobacterium, Marivirga, Solitalea, and Tenacibaculum), but it was emphasized that Flexibacter is still heterogeneous and should be subdivided based on additional molecular taxonomic data (Nakagawa, 2011c). Furthermore, this author mentioned that the type species, Flecibacter flexilis, is isolated from all other species of the genus and that Flexibacter should be restricted to it. The current sole distinction between the definitions of Microscilla and Flexibacter is their habitat (marine vs. terrestrial) (Reichenbach, 1989a), whereas F. elegans showed the same morphology and physiology as M. marina in previous studies (Lewin, 1969); F. roseolus differed from M. marina regarding its pigmentation and F. ruber by its ability to digest starch. F. flexilis differs from M. marina and F. elegans regarding cell length and H 2 S production, whereas the other species differ from F. flexilis regarding pigmentation, cell length and in the case of F. roseolus also H 2 S production. Thus, the Flexibacter species are approximately equidistant from each other regarding morphology and physiology. This also holds for Flexibacter litoralis and F. polymorphus; whereas they form sister groups with high support, their level of divergence is higher than between many other pairs of genera, as obvious from the branch lengths in the trees (Figures 2,3; Supplementary File 4), and their morphology and physiology also differs (Lewin, 1969(Lewin, , 1974)). Thus, based on phylogenetic position (Supplementary File 4) and phenotype, we propose to classify F. elegans, F. litoralis, F. polymorphus, F. roseolus, and F. ruber into the new genera Eisenibacter, Bernardetia, Garritya, Hugenholtzia, and Thermoflexibacter, respectively. Further, we propose the new family Microscillaceae to accomodate Bernardetia and Eisenibacter as well as the new family Bernardetiaceae to accommodate Bernardetia, Hugenholtzia and tentatively also Garritya.Since its description, eleven of 17 originally supposed Flexibacter species were reclassified into a variety of genera (Chitinophaga, Flavobacterium, Marivirga, Solitalea, and Tenacibaculum), but it was emphasized that Flexibacter is still heterogeneous and should be subdivided based on additional molecular taxonomic data (Nakagawa, 2011c). Furthermore, this author mentioned that the type species, Flecibacter flexilis, is isolated from all other species of the genus and that Flexibacter should be restricted to it. The current sole distinction between the definitions of Microscilla and Flexibacter is their habitat (marine vs. terrestrial) (Reichenbach, 1989a), whereas F. elegans showed the same morphology and physiology as M. marina in previous studies (Lewin, 1969); F. roseolus differed from M. marina regarding its pigmentation and F. ruber by its ability to digest starch. F. flexilis differs from M. marina and F. elegans regarding cell length and H 2 S production, whereas the other species differ from F. flexilis regarding pigmentation, cell length and in the case of F. roseolus also H 2 S production. Thus, the Flexibacter species are approximately equidistant from each other regarding morphology and physiology. This also holds for Flexibacter litoralis and F. polymorphus; whereas they form sister groups with high support, their level of divergence is higher than between many other pairs of genera, as obvious from the branch lengths in the trees (Figures 2,3; Supplementary File 4), and their morphology and physiology also differs (Lewin, 1969(Lewin, , 1974)).

        <p>Within Prevotellaceae, Prevotella (Shah and Collins, 1990;Willems and Collins, 1995a;Sakamoto and Ohkuma, 2012) appeared paraphyletic because Hallella seregens (Moore and Moore, 1994) was included within, placed as sister group of P. dentalis with strong support (Figure 3). This problem was also obvious in 16S rRNA gene data and was indeed noted two decades ago (Willems and Collins, 1995a). These authors refrained from taxonomic consequences, however, because they observed a 16S rRNA gene similarity of 99.8% between the type strains of H. seregens and P. dentalis; hence it could not be excluded that the two species are heterotypic synonyms (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2013b). Furthermore, the G+C values calculated from the genomes of H. seregens and P. dentalis are almost identical, with 56.0 and 55.9%, respectively, even though this is not currently reflected in the species descriptions. Digital DNA:DNA hybridization between the genome sequences of H. seregens ATCC 51272 T and P. dentalis DSM 3688 T conducted with the recommended settings of the GGDC yielded 87.40 ± 2.36% DDH similarity and thus indicated identical species, even identical subspecies (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2014b). We conclude that H. seregens is a later heterotypic synonym of P. dentalis.Within Prevotellaceae, Prevotella (Shah and Collins, 1990;Willems and Collins, 1995a;Sakamoto and Ohkuma, 2012) appeared paraphyletic because Hallella seregens (Moore and Moore, 1994) was included within, placed as sister group of P. dentalis with strong support (Figure 3).

        <p>Within Flavobacteriaceae, Chryseobacterium appeared paraphyletic because Epilithonimonas tenax was clearly nested within a well-supported branch of 21 Chryseobacterium species (Figure 4). Whereas support was maximal in the phylogenomic analysis, the UCT and CCT showed Epilithonimonas nested within a paraphyletic Chryseobacterium, too, but without any branch support. In the original description of Epilithonimonas (O' Sullivan et al., 2006) only 75% bootstrap support was obtained for the separation of Epilithonimonas from Chryseobacterium, based on a simplistic evolutionary model (Felsenstein, 2004). The most recent description of an Epilithonimonas species (Ge et al., 2015), still based on that model, showed moderate support for Epilithonimonas monophyly but none for Chryseobacterium monophyly; hence 16S rRNA gene analyses did not rule out that Epilithonimonas is nested within Chryseobacterium, as revealed by phylogenomic analysis. As evident from Figure 4, retaining Epilithonimonas by including certain Chryseobacterium species would require the establishment of a third genus for at least the upper branch including six Chryseobacterium species (C. koreense, C. antarcticum, C. solincola, C. palustre, C. jeonii, C. bovis) to obtain monophyletic groups. The solution to merge the two genera is thus more conservative. Moreover, the overall divergence of the clade comprising the two genera is lower than the divergence of other clades comprising only a single genus (Figures 234). Chryseobacterium has priority over Epilithonimonas (Vandamme et al., 1994). Chryseobacterium was recently emended because some summed features of MIDIsystem fatty-acids profiles appeared to have frequently been misinterpreted in the literature, and a specific pattern of polar lipids remained mostly unnoticed (Montero-Calasanz et al., 2014). In detail, iso-C 15:0 2-OH is present in Chryseobacterium as part of summed feature 3 or 4 instead of C 16:1 ω7t, C 16:1 ω6c and C 16:1 ω7c; iso-C 17:1 ω7c is present instead of iso-C 17:1 ω9c; and the major polar lipids contain three common unknown lipids and two common unknown aminolipids.Within Flavobacteriaceae, Chryseobacterium appeared paraphyletic because Epilithonimonas tenax was clearly nested within a well-supported branch of 21 Chryseobacterium species (Figure 4).

        <p>Thus, the question arises whether the reported differences regarding the lipid profiles between Epilithonimonas and the description of Chryseobacterium can be traced back to misidentified fatty acids or were real differences. Table 2 shows the potentially conflicting phenotypic features. The only real difference in fatty-acid profiles appeared to be the presence of iso-C 16:0 3-OH, which was not explicitly mentioned for the genus Chryseobacterium (Montero-Calasanz et al., 2014). However, it was reported for a variety of Chryseobacterium species (Hugo et al., 2003;Kämpfer et al., 2003Kämpfer et al., , 2011;;Li et al., 2003;Kim et al., 2005;Shen et al., 2005;Young et al., 2005;Park et al., 2006;Behrendt et al., 2007Behrendt et al., , 2008;;Hantsis-Zacharov and Halpern, 2007;Quan et al., 2007;Vaneechoutte et al., 2007;Szoboszlay et al., 2008;Ilardi et al., 2009;Benmalek et al., 2010;Pires et al., 2010;Wu et al., 2013) in concentrations up to 9% and thus does not constitute a real difference either. Additionally, anteiso-C 15:0 as reported for Epilithonimonas is not mentioned in the description of Chryseobacterium but known to occur in the genus from traces to up to 8.2% (Montero-Calasanz et al., 2014). The polar-lipid patterns of Epilithonimonas also fit very well to that revision of Chryseobacterium (Table 2); the sole exception is E. psychrophila, for which only phosphatidylethanolamine and a single unknown lipid were reported; given its well-supported position within a core group of four Epilithonimonas species and the general faintness of the published thin-layer chromatogram (Ge et al., 2015), this can hardly be regarded as an argument against the unification of the genera. Moreover, the two genera have overlapping habitats and other interesting features in common, such as the production of indole-3-acetic acid for promoting plant growth (Montero-Calasanz et al., 2014;Hoang et al., 2015). Thus, the three physiological features that conflict between the original description of Chryseobacterium (Vandamme et al., 1994) and some or all of the Epilithonimonas species rather call for an emendation of Chryseobacterium.Thus, the question arises whether the reported differences regarding the lipid profiles between Epilithonimonas and the description of Chryseobacterium can be traced back to misidentified fatty acids or were real differences.

        <p>Our phylogenetic analysis revealed much agreement between genome-scale data and the current classification of Bacteroidetes, particularly due to the most recent revision (Munoz et al., 2016), but also a number of instances which still call for reclassifications or emendations of taxon descriptions. Prokaryotic taxonomy is not "written by taxonomists for taxonomists" (Cowan, 1971) but directly influences all microbiological disciplines. In microbial ecology, the name of a given taxon gets linked to observed characteristics of its described representatives and, further, to its inferred function in the environment. For example, in the Bacteroidetes-Chlorobi "superphylum, " Chlorobi (Garrity and Holt, 2001), now Chlorobaeota (Oren et al., 2015), are known as the obligate anaerobic green sulfur bacteria, whereas Bacteroidetes, now Bacteroidaeota (Oren et al., 2015), are known as polymer-decomposing microorganisms in the environment and the intestinal tract (Thomas et al., 2011). Currently Halomonadaceae, some Bacteroidetes (Rhodothermaceae, Salinibacter) and Chlostridia are considered as halotolerant or halophilic Bacteria (Oren, 2002(Oren, , 2008;;Bakermans, 2015). The reclassifications of the Rhodothermia and the Balneolia into separated phyla suggest that some Bacteroidetes remain thermotolerant (e.g., Schleiferia and Thermonema, growth at 30-60 In other areas such as medicine and industry, the risk classification of a prokaryotic species to cause infectious diseases is based on its taxonomic classification (ABAS, 2015;ABSA, 2016). Given the peculiar ecological preferences of particularly Rhodothermaeota and Balneolaeota, but also of other groups reclassified here, it is likely that ecological studies using metagenomic binning or similar techniques will benefit from the further improved classification. Studies that do not distinguish between Rhodothermaeota, Balneolaeota, and Bacteroidetes may insufficiently describe microbial compositions of environmental habitats and perhaps make misleading assumptions on environmental conditions (Tsiamis et al., 2008;Baati et al., 2010;Çınar and Mutlu, 2016). A more profound effect of the proposed reclassifications might be on a potentially misleading proposal of an origin for horizontal-gene-transfer (Nelson-Sathi et al., 2015). In contrast, the CARD-FISH probes CF968 (Acinas et al., 2015) and CFB319 (Manz et al., 1996) will not hybridize with 16S rRNA gene sequences of Rhodothermaeota and the Balneolaeota (both probes have two mismatches), and thus environmental studies using this probe are not influenced by the mentioned reclassifications.Our phylogenetic analysis revealed much agreement between genome-scale data and the current classification of Bacteroidetes, particularly due to the most recent revision (Munoz et al., 2016), but also a number of instances which still call for reclassifications or emendations of taxon descriptions.

        <p>Our analysis has shown that a large proportion of G+C content values in Bacteroidetes species descriptions needs to be corrected. The according emendations proposed below are numerous but by no means excessive. Indeed, we do not propose to correct all G+C content values whose precision or accuracy could be improved but only those that are too imprecise or inaccurate given that the within-species deviation in G+C content is at most 1% (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2014c). G+C content values provided in species descriptions that deviate more than 1% from the value calculated from the genome sequence, or display a range of more than 1%, obscure species affiliations and should be corrected (Riedel et al., 2014). Emendations of higher taxa regarding their G+C content have also been conducted (Scheuner et al., 2014) but we abstain from accordingly redefining Bacteroidetes genera here because we opine that more type-strain genome sequences per genus would be needed. Moreover, the emendation of Flavobacterium suncheonense has recently been conducted (Panschin et al., 2016) and needs not be considered here. For the emendations conducted below we round all G+C content values to a single decimal place to accommodate for incompletely sequenced genomes (see Supplementary File 3 for details).Our analysis has shown that a large proportion of G+C content values in Bacteroidetes species descriptions needs to be corrected.

        <p>Whereas conflict with the monophyly of several taxa was obvious in our genome-scale analysis, cases where a taxon was strongly supported in the proteome tree and strongly in conflict with the 16S rRNA gene, or vice versa, were not observed (Figure 5). This is crucial since the promise of phylogenomics is to yield more strongly resolved trees (which fully succeeded in this study), but this might in theory also increase the topological conflict between analyses based on distinct large sets of characters or distinct phylogenetic methods (Jeffroy et al., 2006;Klenk and Göker, 2010). For instance, horizontal gene transfer is known as a cause of topological conflict between analyses of single genes and has even been be used to argue against hierarchical classification (Bapteste and Boucher, 2009;Klenk and Göker, 2010). However, adding more genes, up to virtually all genes available in a genome, increases support in phylogenomic analyses (Breider et al., 2014), indicating that there is a strong hierarchical signal. In contrast, selection of few genes (or any number of characters not on the same order of magnitude as the overall number of genomic characters) can hardly be called genome-scale and also depends on assumptions about the relative suitability of genes for the analysis (Lienau and DeSalle, 2009;Klenk and Göker, 2010). Whole-genome methods such as GBDP avoid this issue and have the potential to yield a truly genomebased classification, but then the question arises how to avoid overestimating phylogenetic confidence (Taylor and Piel, 2004). Bootstrapping entire genes instead of single alignment positions was suggested to reduce conflict and provide more realistic support values in phylogenomic analysis (Siddall, 2010). GBDP pseudo-bootstrapping in conjunction with the greedy-withtrimming algorithm (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2014a) is indeed conceptually closer to this partition bootstrap than to standard bootstrapping. Compared to analyses of concatenated alignments of orthologs, GBDP yielded the same topology but slightly lower support values (Riley et al., 2016). This might explain why we did not identify significant conflict with the 16S rRNA gene in this study.Whereas conflict with the monophyly of several taxa was obvious in our genome-scale analysis, cases where a taxon was strongly supported in the proteome tree and strongly in conflict with the 16S rRNA gene, or vice versa, were not observed (Figure 5).

        <p>We neither identified any significant conflict between phenotypic information and reclassifications suggested by genome-scale trees; rather, these called for a distinct interpretation of the available information, or highlighted known problems that just had not yet been taxonomically fixed. Many of the taxonomic problems had also been visible in the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis in the past, provided a sufficient taxon sampling had been used. For instance, sampling Chlorobi was also necessary in previous (Munoz et al., 2016) and the current phylogenetic analyses to fully recognize the problematic placement of the Balneola clade and Rhodothermaceae. In other cases, missing genomes did not hinder recognizing taxonomic problems. For instance, whereas the genome sequence of the type strain of the type species of Flexibacter was not available to us, the need to split the genus into several genera is already visible in the unconstrained 16S rRNA gene analysis. Moreover, applying a backbone constraint is a valuable means for augmenting comprehensible sampled single-gene data with information from analyses of more genes but fewer organisms (Liu et al., 2015).We neither identified any significant conflict between phenotypic information and reclassifications suggested by genome-scale trees; rather, these called for a distinct interpretation of the available information, or highlighted known problems that just had not yet been taxonomically fixed. Many of the taxonomic problems had also been visible in the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis in the past, provided a sufficient taxon sampling had been used. For instance, sampling Chlorobi was also necessary in previous (Munoz et al., 2016) and the current phylogenetic analyses to fully recognize the problematic placement of the Balneola clade and Rhodothermaceae.

        <p>The high resolution provided by whole-genome phylogenies and the apparent lack of conflicts with data from other sources renders genome-based approaches quite promising for shaping the future of Bacteroidetes taxonomy. This holds even though the present study led to a number of changes in taxonomic opinion, listed below in the order of decreasing Linnaean ranks and with proposed names first, followed by the emendations. We additionally propose to rephrase the "Bacteroidetes-Chlorobi superphylum" to "Bacteroidaeota-Rhodothermaeota-Balneolaeota-Chlorobaeota (BRBC) superphylum, " considering the recent proposal to include the phylum rank in taxonomy (Oren et al., 2015), and considering the new phyla Rhodothermaeota and Balneolaeota as part of the former "Bacteroidetes-Chlorobi superphylum" (Figure 2).The high resolution provided by whole-genome phylogenies and the apparent lack of conflicts with data from other sources renders genome-based approaches quite promising for shaping the future of Bacteroidetes taxonomy.
