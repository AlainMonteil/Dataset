        <p>Significance: Oxidative stress is thought to account for aberrant redox homeostasis and contribute to aging and disease. However, more often than not, administration of antioxidants is ineffective, suggesting that our current understanding of the underlying regulatory processes is incomplete. Recent Advances: Similar to reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species, reactive sulfur species are now emerging as important signaling molecules, targeting regulatory cysteine redox switches in proteins, affecting gene regulation, ion transport, intermediary metabolism, and mitochondrial function. To rationalize the complexity of chemical interactions of reactive species with themselves and their targets and help define their role in systemic metabolic control, we here introduce a novel integrative concept defined as the reactive species interactome (RSI). The RSI is a primeval multilevel redox regulatory system whose architecture, together with the physicochemical characteristics of its constituents, allows efficient sensing and rapid adaptation to environmental changes and various other stressors to enhance fitness and resilience at the local and whole-organism level. Critical Issues: To better characterize the RSI-related processes that determine fluxes through specific pathways and enable integration, it is necessary to disentangle the chemical biology and activity of reactive species (including precursors and reaction products), their targets, communication systems, and effects on cellular, organ, and whole-organism bioenergetics using system-level/network analyses.

        <p>-Albert Szent-Gyo ¨rgyi W e are witnessing an unprecedented paradigmatic change in the practice of medicine whereby the concept of intervention is evolving from treating diseases in a one-organ/ one-symptom manner to a systems-based approach that considers a patient's pathophysiological condition, including his/ her individual genetic blueprint, microbiome, disease history, and lifestyle. Indeed, diseases presenting with similar clinical phenotypes are often heterogeneous conditions of multifactorial origin, involving a multitude of molecular, cellular, and organ systems. Their multilevel nature and complexity pose a formidable challenge to identifying the molecular causes; finding the most suitable therapy for each specific case demands a thorough understanding of the fundamental principles of biological regulation and a refined interdisciplinary systems approach encompassing medicine, pharmacology, biology, chemistry, and physics.

        <p>A limited number of risk factors (such as poor quality nutrition or physical inactivity) and chronic conditions (including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity, asthma, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and certain forms of cancer) account for the majority of the global burden of disease (114), overall life expectancy, and all-cause mortality (203). A common feature of many of these conditions is oxidative stress (176), and some have been redefined as redox diseases (26,206). The term oxidative stress was originally described as an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants in favor of the oxidants, leading to a disruption of redox signaling and control and/or molecular damage (91,174); it was initially considered to be triggered by an inflammatory process or mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the use of selective antioxidants for redox diseases has not had the effect anticipated, suggesting that our current understanding of the underlying pathophysiological processes is incomplete (26,176).A limited number of risk factors (such as poor quality nutrition or physical inactivity) and chronic conditions (including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity, asthma, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and certain forms of cancer) account for the majority of the global burden of disease (114), overall life expectancy, and all-cause mortality (203).

        <p>Recently, Jones and Sies proposed that besides the Genetic Code, allowing reproduction and defining heredity, there exists a Redox Code i that identifies the regulatory elements and defines the principles through which biological function is enabled and protected (94). Within this concept, the en-dogenous production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a highly regulated enzymatic process, which serves the purpose of signaling and can lead to modification of cysteine redox switches. Modification of these switches leads to modulation of their functional state, which would result in alterations of protein structure, enzymatic activity, or gene transcription. Modifying responses to match a changed environment creates the opportunity for adaptive changes that enhance an organism's fitness for purpose.Recently, Jones and Sies proposed that besides the Genetic Code, allowing reproduction and defining heredity, there exists a Redox Code i that identifies the regulatory elements and defines the principles through which biological function is enabled and protected (94).

        <p>However, there is more to this redox network than ROS. Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical, which is produced endogenously by NO synthases (NOS) and acts as an effector and messenger, regulating a variety of physiological processes. Chemical interactions of NO with ROS form reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and constitute the basis for the formation of a multitude of additional oxidative signaling elements (65), including the highly reactive and potentially damaging peroxynitrite (ONOO -). Both ROS and RNS may target cysteine thiols leading to oxidative modifications (including formation of sulfinic acid, sulfenic acids, thiyl radicals, and sulfane sulfur-containing molecules, such as persulfides and polysulfides) (131,132,140). By analogy to ROS and RNS, these compounds are identified as reactive sulfur species (RSS) (67). Similar to ROS and RNS, RSS were first considered to be produced only under pathological conditions and not recognized as being involved in signaling functions. More recently, hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) and its sulfane sulfur derivatives have been shown to participate in fundamental biochemical pathways that control cellular redox homeostasis, signaling, metabolism, and mitochondrial function (145,204); this is perhaps most intriguingly illustrated by the phenomenon of suspended animation observed after H 2 S inhalation in small rodents (11). These observations have led to a renewed interest in sulfide chemistry and biology (37,38,104,126,187) and RSS, together with ROS and RNS, to be considered as important physiological signaling molecules.However, there is more to this redox network than ROS.

        <p>In this review, we provide an integrative biology concept of redox regulation (Fig. 1). We here define the chemical interaction of RSS, RNS, and ROS among themselves and with downstream biological targets as the reactive species interactome (RSI) (Box 1; Table 1). We propose that the RSI serves an integrative function to sense multiple stressors and adjust bioenergetic/metabolic needs accordingly by activating downstream effector pathways to ensure the organism is able to respond to environmental change and stay fit for purpose (Box 2 and Fig. 1). Within this model, H 2 S along with other thiols is considered an important source of RSS, which have a critical role in enabling and supporting this complex cell signaling network.In this review, we provide an integrative biology concept of redox regulation (Fig. 1).

Intracellular, extracellular, and interorgan/systemic role of the RSI. Precursors of the RSI are organic and inorganic substrates and cofactors, including amino acids (e.g., arginine, methionine), vitamins (B6, B12, C), and xanthine, as well as oxygen, nitrite, polysulfides, thiosulfate, and sulfate, which are transformed by mitochondrial or cytoplasmic enzymes into ROS, RNS, and RSS. The chemical interactions among ROS, RNS, and RSS lead to formation of a number of products with different reactivities, stabilities, half-lives, and therefore different lifetimes defined by their physicochemical properties, covering a wide range of maximal travel distances. A common target of the RSI are cysteine thiols in proteins, acting as redox switches, able to fine-tune activity of signaling molecules, and leading to short-term responses (e.g., protein kinases and phosphatases inducing changes in signaling and glucose metabolism) or long-term adaptation (by modifying redox switches responsible for gene expression regulation, such as the HIF, NFkB, and Keap1/Nrf2 pathways). The RSI serves also as a local and systemic heterocellular communication system mediated by actions of longer-lasting products of the RSI (e.g., nitrite, polysulfides) and circulating thiols.

        <p>Two decades ago, a case was made that NO production by simple life forms may have provided a crucial survival mechanism against ROS at the time of emergence of aerobic life, offering an opportunity for its further utilization as an early signaling molecule (56). Intriguingly, the story of reactive species may have started much earlier. Indeed, more recently, H 2 S has been implicated in the origin of life (139). The following section places emphasis on the role of sulfur in the evolution of redox metabolic systems; how, at a later stage, O 2 replaced some of the roles of sulfur as donor and acceptor of electrons for energy metabolism and signaling; and how reactive species may have contributed to the evolution of life by enabling environmental sensing, metabolic plasticity, and cellcell communication. Comparisons with other life origin theories, for example, the hydrogen hypothesis, the RNA world, and panspermia, are beyond the scope of this article. For a more comprehensive treatise of how the emerging field of systems chemistry has shaped our understanding of the origin of life and that of metabolism and the fundamentals of biochemical adaptation, the reader is referred elsewhere (20,80,149).Two decades ago, a case was made that NO production by simple life forms may have provided a crucial survival mechanism against ROS at the time of emergence of aerobic life, offering an opportunity for its further utilization as an early signaling molecule (56).

        <p>Life requires a set of essential molecular building blocks from which to assemble more complex structures, enzymes to direct these processes, membranes to partition simultaneously occurring events, and energy to overcome inherent entropies (Box 3).

These were proposed to be derived from (i) intense electrical discharge in a primordial soup containing basic elements, such as carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen (125); (ii) atmospheric photochemical reactions (158); (iii) through volcanic activity and hydrothermal fissures in the Earth's crust; and (iv) extraterrestrial sources ranging from collisions with massive objects (22,147) to the fine interstellar dust, which continues to add a large amount of organic compounds to Earth on a daily basis (9).

        <p>The Earth's earliest atmosphere must have contained large amounts of H 2 S (198). Sulfide is an efficient reductant and its chemical nature was fundamental for driving protometabolic reactions with N 2 and CO 2 to form RNA, amino acids, and lipid precursors (142). Our planet has been likened to a primordial reaction cell (148) where energy in the form of reducing equivalents, namely ferrous iron (Fe 2+ ) and sulfide (H 2 S, HS -, S 2-), traversed the Earth's crust through pores (hydrothermal vents) at a steady and therefore dependable rate. Many of these hydrothermal vents sit on massive sulfide deposits called sulfide lenses (168,169), where the magmatic flow heats the water to over 400°C. The combination of heat, water, and high pressure drives organic synthesis not possible under other conditions, and as the water rises and cools, the products become stable.The Earth's earliest atmosphere must have contained large amounts of H 2 S (198).

        <p>An argument can be made for the primacy of sulfide in the origin of life: in combination with transition metals, especially iron, copper, zinc, molybdenum, and tungsten, allowing oneand two-electron transitions, sulfides formed a variety of catalysts that were prototypical enzymes for organic synthesis and created a platform upon which synthesis could occur (33,163,200,201). These metal sulfide minerals formed primordial membranes, allowing compartmentalization of parallel chemical reactions (122). Then, the constant flux of reducing equivalents into the comparatively oxidizing environment of seawater provided a continually renewed and reliable energy source. In addition, some oxidized sulfur coming from the vents gave rise to the formation of defined redox zones.An argument can be made for the primacy of sulfide in the origin of life: in combination with transition metals, especially iron, copper, zinc, molybdenum, and tungsten, allowing oneand two-electron transitions, sulfides formed a variety of catalysts that were prototypical enzymes for organic synthesis and created a platform upon which synthesis could occur (33,163,200,201).

        <p>Influenced by Claude Bernard's concept of the milieu interieure and Walter Cannon's notion of homeostasis, the term stress was coined by Hans Selye in the middle of the last century; using experimental animal models, Selye also observed that persistent stress could lead to the development of various diseases (166). Mechanisms enabling to cope with stress are crucial checkpoints for resilience. Adaptation to (perceived or real) environmental, nutritional, lifestyle-related, or mental stresses serves the purpose to improve the fitness of a biological organism to deal with those stresses in the future. The concept of hormesis describes the ability of small stresses to confer protection via activation of the cellular stress response (121), a universal defense reaction of cells to damage to cellular macromolecules (107).Influenced by Claude Bernard's concept of the milieu interieure and Walter Cannon's notion of homeostasis, the term stress was coined by Hans Selye in the middle of the last century; using experimental animal models, Selye also observed that persistent stress could lead to the development of various diseases (166).

The concept of hormesis describes the ability of small stresses to confer protection via activation of the cellular stress response (121), a universal defense reaction of cells to damage to cellular macromolecules (107).</p>
        <p>Providing biological flexibility requires energy, which is derived from the release of chemical energy in food to produce heat, readily available forms of energy (e.g., ATP, creatine phosphate), and reducing equivalents [NAD(P)H]; reacting to specific shortages in energy supply requires metabolic plasticity; and adjusting metabolism appropriate to the prevailing conditions requires a sensing and adaptation system. Resilience against stress also demands coupling of the sensing elements to appropriate protection and repair systems that provide a first line of defense (in the form of e.g., antioxidants/ antioxidant enzymes) and a system that can identify, repair, or excise damage to biomolecules or tissues caused by endogenous reactive species or exogenous toxicants. Thus, effective buffering against potentially harmful conditions and/ or environmental threats requires all four: sensing, adaptation, defense, and repair systems working in concert to confer protection, offer stability, and offset damage. The RSI is involved in sensing/utilizing available energy resources as efficiently as possible by coordinating a system of complex interwoven pathways that ensure smooth operation while allocating sufficient energy for protection and repair of damage to DNA and other critical cell constituents by environmental stressors. Compromised bioenergetic status comes at the price of increased vulnerability to environmental threats.Providing biological flexibility requires energy, which is derived from the release of chemical energy in food to produce heat, readily available forms of energy (e.g., ATP, creatine phosphate), and reducing equivalents [NAD(P)H]; reacting to specific shortages in energy supply requires metabolic plasticity; and adjusting metabolism appropriate to the prevailing conditions requires a sensing and adaptation system.

        <p>Oxygenic photosynthesis likely first appeared in cyanobacteria around 3 bya (Fig. 2). This ultimately led to the great oxidation event around 2.3 bya when atmospheric O 2 is thought to have risen to 1%-2%, which is 5%-10% of present atmospheric levels (45,164). However, apart from small oxygen oases in the shallows, the oceans remained anoxic. Although limited, atmospheric O 2 slowly oxidized exposed elemental sulfur and dissolved H 2 S/HS -to sulfate, which was then carried to the oceans, reduced to H 2 S by the pervasive Fe 2+ , and within a hundred million years, vast areas of ocean became euxinic (anoxic and sulfidic). It was in this environment that endosymbiosis, in which a sulfur-reducing Archaea engulfed a sulfide-oxidizing a-protobacterium, produced the mitochondrion around 1.5 bya (111,165). These early eukaryotes would later incorporate cyanobacteria and thus become the ancestors of modern-day plants. Combined oxygen production by cyanobacteria and primitive plants eventually oxidized all the oceanic iron and sulfide, and around 600 million years ago, atmospheric O 2 began to increase to present-day levels (Fig. 2).

        <p>Like ROS, RSS could have had dire consequences: organisms either had to acquire detoxification capability for coping with RSS or die. These capabilities would have to be different from those found in anaerobic organisms, which could escape the oxygen by retreating to anoxic niches. For organisms carrying out anoxygenic photosynthesis, retreating to asulfidic niches was not an option as these did not exist. Therefore, safe disposing of RSS, or their use for signaling or further metabolism, must have enabled the acquisition of appropriate metabolic pathways long before oxygen became prevalent. This would explain why antioxidant systems, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) (catalyzing reduction of O 2 -), catalase and glutathione peroxidase (catalyzing reduction of H 2 O 2 ), and redox systems governed by thioredoxins, peroxiredoxins, and glutaredoxins, all appeared with the advent of anoxygenic photosynthesis more than 2 bya before they would be called on to deal with ROS (21,103,124,137,221). Therefore, we suggest that-contrary to common belief (8)-these systems evolved to detoxify RSS and/or to shuttle reducing equivalents for energy utilization or signaling. With the advent of O 2 , it would have been a relatively trivial matter to switch from dealing with RSS to ROS as their biological chemistries present more similarities than differences. The use of multiple reactive species is in alignment with the need to keep the composition of the internal environment (Claude Bernard's milieu interieure) relatively constant (83).Like ROS, RSS could have had dire consequences: organisms either had to acquire detoxification capability for coping with RSS or die.

        <p>The ready availability of energy in a usable form is a fundamental requirement for survival and reproductive success. In addition to defense and repair systems suitable to cope with harsh environmental conditions, in a world of finite resources, organisms require metabolic flexibility to respond and adapt to changes in environmental conditions (Box 2). The capability of early life forms to adjust their energetic needs and metabolic capability to effectively respond to a variable availability of nutrients/precursors requires an ability to sense and respond to those changes. This would involve the capability to ''sniff out'' the prevailing conditions in the extracellular environment and adjust metabolic pathways accordingly. The metabolic plasticity required for this responsiveness in living organisms presumes the ability to securely cope with reactive species. Reactive species are formed mainly as enzymatic products from specific organic and inorganic substrates, including amino acids, nitrite, polysulfides, sulfite, sulfate, and O 2 (as discussed in detail in the RSI Precursors in the Context of Intermediary Metabolism and Nutrition section). The RSI captures the interaction at the interface between internal and external milieu that enabled metabolic plasticity of early, unicellular life forms and persists in regulating the intersection of co-metabolism and pathogenesis in response to bacterial infection today (155).The ready availability of energy in a usable form is a fundamental requirement for survival and reproductive success.

As discussed for NO earlier (Box 4) (56), longer-lived RSI metabolites may later have participated in cell-cell communication and enabled co-metabolic negotiations. As levels of regulatory complexity within those multicellular life forms increased, so did the need for communication. Yet, without appropriate protection, these symbiotic life forms were still vulnerable to threats and dependent on opportunities provided by their local environment. Gaining independence and resilience against external stressors required formation of cell assemblies allowing robust growth and movement. This may have been a driver for the development of larger multicellular organisms with distributed critical functions and enhanced resilience. With redox processes at the heart of global regulation, all organisms larger than perhaps a few hundred cells would require an internal system to communicate metabolic activity status and perceived threat level throughout the entire system, allowing bioenergetic prioritization to survive and reproduce; in other words, an interorgan communication system (see the Interorgan Redox Communication Systems section for further details).The development of intercellular communication and the emergence of symbiotic arrangements provided new collaborative opportunities to cope with environmental and infectious threats as well as nutritional shortages.

Regardless, the generation and predominant chemical properties of the RNS and RSS are also listed in Table 2. It is especially noteworthy that the interaction between ROS, RNS, and RSS can lead to products with distinct (and even opposite) chemistry from that of the precursors. For example, the reaction of NO with O 2 -to make peroxynitrite (ONOO -) takes two poor oxidants (NO and O 2 -) and generates the potentially potent oxidant, ONOO -. As shown in Table 2, ROS, RNS, and RSS taken together cover a wide array of chemical properties ranging from highly reducing (RSSH, O 2 -) to highly oxidizing (HO , NO 2 ), from highly electrophilic (RSOH, H 2 O 2 , HNO) to highly nucleophilic (RSSH), and from good hydrogen atom donors (HNO, RSSH) to potent hydrogen atom abstractors (HO , NO 2 ). This chemical diversity allows Nature to take advantage of widely varying interactive chemistries provided by a limited number of biochemical precursors (namely O 2 , NO, H 2 S, and derived species).

        <p>NO was the first among the reactive species to be proposed to have played a key role in intercellular communication and development of Life on Earth (56) well before the need to deal with the adverse consequences of rising atmospheric O 2 levels in the form of unintentional cellular ROS generation (56). We do not know with any certainty where, when and how Life on Earth began -similarly little is known about the onset of biogenic NO formation. Geochemically, NO/NOx would have been formed as a result of lightning and volcanic activity. Since contemporary eukaryotic NO synthases require O 2 to generate NO from L-arginine this process would not have worked reliably under hypoxic conditions; biological NO production must therefore have originated from simpler prokaryotic processes such as denitrification (the process of nitrate reduction to dinitrogen) and/or ammonia oxidation (56) where both NO 2 -and NO are reaction intermediates. There is an astonishing redundancy and abundance of nitrite reductases in contemporary cells of all kingdoms. One characteristic of eukaryotic nitrite reductases is their susceptibility to inhibition by O 2 (55). It is possible that multiple NO producing systems coexisted side-by-side, depending on whether the environment was reducing or oxidizing in nature, what substrates were available and what other biochemical processes this could be linked to. Several atypical NO synthases have meanwhile been discovered in fungi and bacteria (44), and it is likely that other non-classical NO producing enzymes will be identified in other life forms in the future. The nitrogen cycle is probably of similar antiquity as the sulfur cycle since both N and S are essential for Life. Nitrogenase is arguably the most important enzyme in the process of nitrogen fixation by allowing the reduction of N 2 to NH 3 , a key step that enables the incorporation of nitrogen into amino acids, nucleotides and other essential biomolecules. Nitrogenase is produced by cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), green sulfur bacteria and several symbiotic bacteria such as those living on the roots of leguminous plants. The enzyme is oxygen-sensitive and comprises an iron-containing protein that supplies electrons to the FeMo protein, which uses those electrons to reduce N 2 to NH 3 , forming H 2 as a by-product. The FeMO protein contains a 4Fe-4S and a Mo-3Fe-3S cluster held in place by a cysteine and a histidine on either end. The presence of iron, molybdenum and sulfur suggests a hydrothermal heritage (135). Thus, there is precedence for early interaction between sulfur and nitrogen metabolism long before the emergence of oxygen. sensing/signaling purposes, the biochemical syntheses of ROS, RNS, and RSS must be tightly controlled kinetically, temporally, and spatially. For example, NO biosynthesis can occur via three primary pathways involving NOS enzymes that are distinct with regard to their regulation and location (40,58). The generation of NO 2 from NO is kinetically second order in NO and first order in O 2 , indicating that significant NO 2 levels (at least made via NO/O 2 chemistry) can only be produced in compartments possessing high levels of both precursors such as lipid membranes (115). Of note, nitrogen oxide-modified lipids (containing nitrated fatty acids) possess potent biological activities (156). Moreover, significant generation of ONOO -requires that both NO and O 2 -be made at the same place, rate, and time (96). This requirement makes ONOO -generation rather difficult, possibly protecting cells from inadvertent formation and narrowing its action radius.NO was the first among the reactive species to be proposed to have played a key role in intercellular communication and development of Life on Earth (56) well before the need to deal with the adverse consequences of rising atmospheric O 2 levels in the form of unintentional cellular ROS generation (56). We do not know with any certainty where, when and how Life on Earth began -similarly little is known about the onset of biogenic NO formation. Geochemically, NO/NOx would have been formed as a result of lightning and volcanic activity. Since contemporary eukaryotic NO synthases require O 2 to generate NO from L-arginine this process would not have worked reliably under hypoxic conditions; biological NO production must therefore have originated from simpler prokaryotic processes such as denitrification (the process of nitrate reduction to dinitrogen) and/or ammonia oxidation (56) where both NO 2 -and NO are reaction intermediates. There is an astonishing redundancy and abundance of nitrite reductases in contemporary cells of all kingdoms. One characteristic of eukaryotic nitrite reductases is their susceptibility to inhibition by O 2 (55). It is possible that multiple NO producing systems coexisted side-by-side, depending on whether the environment was reducing or oxidizing in nature, what substrates were available and what other biochemical processes this could be linked to. Several atypical NO synthases have meanwhile been discovered in fungi and bacteria (44), and it is likely that other non-classical NO producing enzymes will be identified in other life forms in the future.

        <p>S-nitrosothiol formation can occur in several ways (37,65). One possibility is the reaction of a free thiol with a nitrosating species, that is, an entity that donates the equivalent of NO + such as N 2 O 3 . Another possibility is the reaction of a thiyl radical with NO. Importantly, N 2 O 3 generation is kinetically restricted (214) (for similar reasons as NO 2 generation); as a one-electron oxidant, thiyl radical is very reactive and its formation can only take place under very specific conditions, such as at the active site of enzymes such as ribonucleotide reductase (184). These strict chemical requirements offer a selective advantage by limiting the generation of unwanted reactive and/or deleterious species, which ensures that they are only formed under specific conditions for a particular purpose. By contrast, inadvertent or aberrant generation of any ROS, RNS, or RSS carries the risk of pathophysiological consequences.S-nitrosothiol formation can occur in several ways (37,65).

        <p>Finally, RSS receiving considerable recent attention are hydropersulfides (RSSH). Generation of hydropersulfides from the corresponding thiol represents an oxidation (an RSSH species is at the same oxidation state as a disulfide, RSSR) and can be mediated by several of the oxidants listed in Table 2 (e.g., H 2 O 2 in the presence of H 2 S). Interestingly, a hydropersulfide is a superior reductant compared with the corresponding thiol. Thus, an extremely potent reductant (RSSH) is made primarily under oxidizing conditions, a fact that seems to have been taken advantage of in nature as it has been proposed that RSSH formation can be protective against oxidative stress (140).Finally, RSS receiving considerable recent attention are hydropersulfides (RSSH).

        <p>In comparison with RSH, RSSH is both more nucleophilic and reducing. The greater nucleophilicity of RSSH can be explained by (i) the a-affect, in which the electrons of the internal sulfur atom repel those of the external sulfur atom, thus enhancing nucleophilic reactivity-a characteristic lacking in RSH, and (ii) the pK a of RSSH typically being 1-2 units lower than analogous RSH species, making the anionic RSS -present in greater concentrations than RS -at physiological pH.In comparison with RSH, RSSH is both more nucleophilic and reducing.

        <p>Last and perhaps most intriguing, RSSH are also electrophilic species, whereas RSH are not. Consideration of the oxidation state of sulfur atoms in RSSH reveals that both are in a -1 oxidation state.

In this light, RSSH are similar to RSSR (in which both sulfur atoms are also in the -1 oxidation state) and thus are also able to act as an electrophile. Indeed, the electrophilic ability of RSSH is expected to be a function of pH as the deprotonated RSS -species is considered to be less electrophilic (and more nucleophilic) than the protonated RSSH. Electrophilic reactivity of RSSH can yield H 2 S (via nucleophilic attack on the internal sulfur) or result in a transsulfuration process (via nucleophilic attack at the terminal sulfane sulfur), yielding another RSSH species (Eq. 6) or inorganic polysulfides (i.e., HSSH; Eq. 7).Last and perhaps most intriguing, RSSH are also electrophilic species, whereas RSH are not.

        <p>Although several groups have investigated the interaction of RSH and nitrogen oxides, specifically NO, mechanisms for the formation of resulting species in biological systems are still controversial. Therefore, the possible reactions of RSH and other related species with NO will be discussed here from a chemical standpoint and implications for biological relevance will be given based on this. As alluded to above, Snitrosothiols have been reported to have important biological function and serve as biological signaling molecules (17,59,179). However, no direct reaction between RSH and NO should be expected to produce such RSNO species because NO has an unpaired electron that occupies an NO antibonding orbital, preventing nucleophilic attack by RSH.

        <p>Like RSH, RSSH is not expected to react directly with NO. Although one-electron oxidation of RSSH and coworkers to RSS might be expected to yield the corresponding alkyl-Snitrosopersulfide (RSSNO) via reaction with NO, recent studies indicate this either does not occur to any great extent (10) or the product has a short lifetime (2). For this reason, RSSNO may not be expected to serve as a biological signaling molecule or NO transporter. Curiously (and unlike thiyl radicals), RSS is rather stable even in the presence of O 2 (10), offering potential opportunities for electron transfer reactions under aerobic conditions (see the Intracellular Redox Regulation, Bioenergetics, and Intermediary Metabolism section).Like RSH, RSSH is not expected to react directly with NO.

Chemical Biology and Functional Significance of the Reactive Species Interactome ROS were initially viewed as mere by-products of redox reactions, especially mitochondrial respiration and certain pathological conditions, leading to oxidative damage of biological targets (protein, lipids, DNA). Furthermore, oxidative reactions were believed to be mediated by RNS, mainly produced by the oxidation of NO. Similarly, cysteine oxidative modification and formation of RSS were first considered only as a consequence of pathological conditions (67). Today, reactive species are considered part of a complex redox signaling network that interacts with protein thiol targets, which act as redox switches to control protein structure and function in dependence of local and global redox and environmental/ nutritional status. The analysis of the chemical biology of H 2 S and related sulfane sulfur species and their interaction with NO and ROS indicate that the RSI is a tightly intertwined redox network that enables rapid sensing and adaptation of the internal cellular milieu to a changing environment. As indicated in Box 1, it is noteworthy that this redox metabolic network appears to have evolved in a world dominated by sulfur and only later incorporating the wider range of options involving nitrogen and oxygen species. This is exactly the opposite order as to how these species were discovered and discussed as contributors to redox biology in the literature. The basis of the interactions among the reactive species in the RSI is defined by the fundamental chemistries of their atomic constituents. However, to be able to operate effectively and enable regulatory control, the system also requires an ability to sense, respond, and adapt to the prevailing state.

The lines indicate the outcome of protein cysteine modifications induced by RNS (blue), ROS (red), or RSS (orange).</p>
        <p>production involves a variety of different enzymes and organelles utilizing oxygen, but the relationship is not straightforward; counterintuitively, more mitochondrial O 2 -is produced in hypoxia than under normoxia (207). O 2 is also the substrate of various NADPH oxidases producing either O 2 -or H 2 O 2 (16,199). Other sources include xanthine oxidoreductase, 5-lipoxygenase, and cytochrome P 450 . Nonenzymatic ROS production may also be generated in an unregulated manner through the metal-driven Haber-Weiss reaction leading to the formation of OH . Enzymatic generation of NO requires both a source of N and O, specifically in the form of arginine (and possibly homoarginine) and O 2 (72,127,167), whereas NOS-independent reactions leading to NO formation include nitrite/nitrate reduction (43,90,116,172,192). NOS activity is also dependent on tetrahydrobiopterin and reducing equivalents in the form of NADPH (72,185). RSS production relies on the availability of methionine, homocysteine, and cysteine serving as substrates in the methionine recycling and transsulfuration pathway. The enzymes of the transsulfuration pathway are responsible for the formation of cysteine from the essential amino acid methionine and serine. Cysteine is crucial for defining protein structure (disulfide bonds), function (e.g., enzymatic activity), redox signaling (e.g., by acting as redox switches, see The RSI: Sensing and Transducing Elements section), and as a building block for glutathione (GSH) production. The tripeptide GSH (Glu-Cys-Gly) is less toxic for cells than cysteine itself, is present in millimolar concentrations intracellularly, and buffers the cellular antioxidant network, together with ascorbate (vitamin C), ubiquinol (coenzyme Q), and a-tocopherol (vitamin E) (175).

        <p>Cofactors such as folate, choline, vitamin B 6 (pyridoxal phosphate), and B 12 (cobalamin) are critically important for adequate methionine recycling. Interestingly, several metabolic aberrations in the tetrahydrofolate cycle, the methionine recycling capacity, or flux through the transsulfuration pathway are associated with elevated homocysteine concentrations in blood. The latter marks metabolic imbalance and/or inadequate nutrient availability and hence is a marker of risk for cardiovascular disease (95,138). The transsulfuration pathway enzymes, cysteine-b-synthase (CBS), cysteine-c-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptosulfotransferase (MST), are also responsible for the endogenous production of H 2 S (144) as well as organic persulfides (CBS) (86) and polysulfides (3-MST) (101,102). CBS is functionally regulated by NO, its expression enhanced by oxidative stress, and gene transcription hormonally regulated in response to fuel supply (182). These pathways therefore can be considered to be a central hub for intermediary metabolism and a point of intersection for the production of proteins (as building block for tRNA and ribosomal protein synthesis), lipids (via S-adenosylmethionine and choline), and FIG. 4. Metabolic pathways fueling the RSI. In mammals, L-arginine is formed from citrulline, derived either from dietary glutamine or proline via ornithine and carbamoylphosphate in the mitochondria or from bicarbonate (HCO 3 -) and ammonia (NH 3 ) via the hepatic urea cycle. Citrulline is then transported via the blood to the kidney where it is converted into arginine. Arginine used for protein formation and (O 2 -dependent) NO synthesis can be recycled via the arginine/citrulline cycle. NOS activity is inhibited by different methylated arginine residues released by proteolysis (e.g., ADMA). A key interaction between nitrogen and sulfur metabolism is the methylation of arginine using SAM-dependent methyltransferases. SAM is a cofactor produced from methionine and used for methylation of a large number of biomolecules; in the methionine recycling pathway, the removal of one methyl group (-CH 3 ) results in the formation of homocysteine. Depending on the availability of methionine, homocysteine is either recycled to methionine with the help of vitamin B12 and folic acid or is degraded to cystathionine and cysteine. While the latter also serves as precursor of cellular glutathione production, both compounds can generate H 2 S in the transsulfuration pathway.

The RSI also regulates the expression and activity of enzymes belonging to intermediary metabolism and stress response, highlighting the interactions between catabolism, bioenergetics, and redox status. The reciprocal nature of these relationships indicates that the RSI serves as a central hub that integrates intermediary metabolism and stress signaling (Fig. 1). In addition, tissue/organ functions need to be coordinated and integrated for the sake of optimal fitness of the entire organism; this is achieved via a central communication system, that is, blood, transporting gases, nutrients, and waste products, as well as erythrocytes, immune cells and platelets.

Extracellular fluids such as interstitial fluid, lymph, and blood are especially well suited as the connecting medium (36). We propose that the entirety of protein thiols serves as an important redox buffer and that extracellular thiol status helps to mark the global redox state in health and disease.</p>
        <p>In vitro, oxidative stress is typically assessed by determining the concentration of reduced/oxidized glutathione, antioxidant enzyme (SOD, catalase, glutathione peroxidase) activity, and/or the levels of (anti)oxidants and the potential for free radical scavenging using fluorescent molecules, with all their limitations (205) including their lack of specificity for ROS versus RSS (47). More often than not, little distinction is made between assessing capacity to cope with an oxidant burden, determining the magnitude of exposure to an oxidant, and the balance between exposure and antioxidant capacity. Earlier attempts at quantifying oxidative stress in vivo by measuring levels of select products of lipid, protein, or DNA oxidation (e.g., 8-isoprostanes, malondialdehyde, protein carbonyls, 8-hydroxyguanosine) often met with disappointment, in that all these biomarkers showed distinct profile scaling with oxidative stress burden, but considerable temporal heterogeneity. The reason for this divergence is not immediately apparent and is likely due to the fact that some markers are only bystanders of oxidative damage, while others are actual regulatory nodes of the antioxidant network. Insights into the systems architecture of the redox network and its modus operandi are required to interpret this information. Valuable insight might be derived from information about metabolic fluxes (the direction of travel within metabolic pathways), which can be achieved by either applying stable isotope labeling methodology or monitoring natural isotopic fractionation using high-sensitivity, high-resolution mass spectrometry (fluxomics).In vitro, oxidative stress is typically assessed by determining the concentration of reduced/oxidized glutathione, antioxidant enzyme (SOD, catalase, glutathione peroxidase) activity, and/or the levels of (anti)oxidants and the potential for free radical scavenging using fluorescent molecules, with all their limitations (205) including their lack of specificity for ROS versus RSS (47).

        <p>Based upon the assumption that thiols play a determinant role in redox regulation, measuring the ratio of reduced over oxidized forms of small aminothiols such as cysteine or glutathione is potentially more powerful than measuring levels of individual oxidation products inasmuch as it informs us about the status of a dynamic system that serves to shuttle nutrients between cells/organs and electrons between the intracellular and extracellular milieu. Often misunderstood, it is not the electrochemical redox potentials (of e.g., GSH/ GSSG) that drive the biology; those concentration ratios are simply the outcome of fast enzymatic processes related to thiol transport, degradation, and regeneration (57). The ratios of reduced/oxidized thiols show diurnal variation (12) and decrease with age, but the redox couples of cysteine and glutathione, for example, are not in equilibrium (92). This indicates that ratios are maintained at defined levels, which might be presumed to confer benefits that are as yet unclear. However, even those measurements reflect only a small part of the overall thiol redox network as it fails to capture the large protein-bound thiol pool (196) and kinetically controlled exchange reactions with free thiols in the intra-and extracellular compartments (Fig. 5). While the overall complexity of this system has been appreciated already some time ago (196), little is known about central regulatory nodes governing these equilibria.Based upon the assumption that thiols play a determinant role in redox regulation, measuring the ratio of reduced over oxidized forms of small aminothiols such as cysteine or glutathione is potentially more powerful than measuring levels of individual oxidation products inasmuch as it informs us about the status of a dynamic system that serves to shuttle nutrients between cells/organs and electrons between the intracellular and extracellular milieu.

        <p>A recent report suggests that cysteine and glutathione redox status are associated with mortality from coronary artery disease (143). Another highly significant association was found between total free thiol status in serum and clinical outcome in unrelated clinical conditions (61,105). Given the overall complexity of the extracellular antioxidant network and its link to intracellular redox status, the latter was utterly unexpected. A simplistic view of total free thiol levels in a given compartment could be interpreted as a direct reflection of the balance between oxidants and antioxidant capacity (or overall redox poise). Indeed, a decrease of reduced thiols or an increase of oxidized thiols has been found in patients with blood disorders, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, inflammatory disease, kidney disease, metabolic disease, neurological disease, skin disease, and thyroid disease (3,108,110,123,133,180,220). Thiol oxidation has also been associated with risk factors, including aging, smoking, obesity, and alcohol abuse (69). Both within cells (75) and in blood (195), proteins constitute by far the largest pool of redox-active thiols. Approximately 60% of the total thiol groups in serum/plasma are accounted for by the single free cysteine (Cys 34 ) of albumin (195). Thus, when instead of the ratio of free and oxidized thiols only free thiols are measured, adjustment for total serum protein can be seen as an indirect way of accounting for total thiol content.A recent report suggests that cysteine and glutathione redox status are associated with mortality from coronary artery disease (143).

        <p>In renal transplant recipients, protein-adjusted serum-free thiols were found to predict graft failure and patient survival (61,105). In a small cohort of stable chronic heart failure patients, there was a positive association between proteinadjusted serum-free thiols and a favorable disease outcome (61,105). Interestingly, a study evaluating the concentration of serum protein thiols in a wide range of species concluded that free thiol levels are positively associated with life span, suggesting that control of redox status has retained its importance from evolution to modern-day (patho)physiology (146).In renal transplant recipients, protein-adjusted serum-free thiols were found to predict graft failure and patient survival (61,105).

        <p>Studies relating serum-free thiol levels to other components of the redox network are lacking. In this context, disentangling the relationship between overall thiol redox status (free reduced and oxidized, as well as protein-bound thiols), which is likely affected by cellular uptake and reduction processes, and production/metabolism of both NO and H 2 S/ sulfide would seem to be important. We here propose that protein thiols in the extracellular fluid play a fundamental role in communication between different body compartments, acting as sentinels of distant danger, transporters of specific substrates, and as dynamic entities that reflect a readout of global thiol redox status. Rather than relying on the integrity of a single protein to fulfill this important function, there is greater security with greater buffering capability, and in nature, the entire protein thiol pool may play a role for this purpose. Nevertheless, albumin is likely to play a more important role quantitatively simply based on its abundance in the extracellular compartment (195) and the extent to which it transports small aminothiols. While mixed disulfide formation can occur nonenzymatically via attack of reactive protein thiolates (e.g., Cys 34 of albumin) at the disulfide bond of oxidized thiols, the reverse process that would regenerate the free thiol is very slow. This implies that a significant portion of these reactions must be controlled through the activity of specific thiol oxidoreductases such as glutaredoxin, protein disulfide isomerase, and thioredoxin/ thioredoxin reductase (70). Besides mixed disulfide formation (S-thiolation), other sulfhydryl modifications, including S-nitrosylation, S-sulfuration (sulfhydration), S-oxidation, and S-acylation (e.g., S-palmitoylation), may also reversibly decrease free thiol availability, but information on the practical relevance of these processes is limited. This may be particularly relevant for cysteinylation and persulfidation of protein thiols as micromolar concentrations of per/polysulfides were detected in biological tissues (86) and therefore have the potential to affect the measurement of total free thiols.Studies relating serum-free thiol levels to other components of the redox network are lacking.

        <p>The same fundamental regulatory principles that operate in the extracellular compartment likely apply to intracellular redox state (Fig. 5). Much emphasis has been devoted to the process of S-cysteinylation and S-glutathionylation (46,66), although other post-translational modifications may be of similar importance. Crosstalk between cell compartments of widely different redox status (nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, and mitochondria) is of significance in this context (30,51,161) since the same reactive species that modulate mitochondrial activity and dynamics (130,211) may also link overall redox poise to intracellular signaling, metabolic control, and bioenergetic status (188).

        <p>These regulatory principles would provide the opportunity to prioritize options for metabolic adjustments in individual cells in relation to the overall redox status of the organism, which might be achieved as a consequence of exchange of redox information across cell membranes (Fig. 5). Although the cystine/glutamate antiporter has been implicated (34), the elements connecting intra-and extracellular spaces to exchange this information are currently unknown. An effective communication across cell membranes requires moieties that reliably operate under widely different redox conditions, that is, under oxidative as well as reductive stress. There are limited choices chemically that fulfill the need of electron exchange under those extremes, but one interesting possibility may involve the persulfide/perthiyl radical couple (10).These regulatory principles would provide the opportunity to prioritize options for metabolic adjustments in individual cells in relation to the overall redox status of the organism, which might be achieved as a consequence of exchange of redox information across cell membranes (Fig. 5).

        <p>Redox status is also linked to cell survival (193,222). Effective repair of damage is cardinal to survival and resilience. DNA repair mechanisms have been studied most extensively, not least because the survival of organisms depends on faithful transmission of genetic information from one cell to the next (and across generations), from the level of DNA replication over chromosomal distribution to the repair of damage incurred. This involves surveillance systems for FIG. 5. Thiol transport between cell organelles and exchange between the intra-and extracellular compartments. In human plasma, aminothiols such as cysteine, homocysteine, and glutathione exist in free (reduced and oxidized) and proteinbound form, but little is known about the dynamics of their regulation and relationship with each other. As documented for cysteine and glutathione, aminothiols are transported across cell membranes and exchanged between cell organelles, with specific transporters such as the cystine (CysSSCys)/glutamate (Glu) antiporter (Xc), which plays an important role in the regulation of cell surface redox. Continuous arrows indicate known relationships, interrupted arrows represent unknown relationships. In both the intracellular and extracellular compartments, protein thiols represent the main pool of sulfhydryl (-SH) groups. (Note that different font sizes in the figure denote relative concentrations and that mixed disulfides of low-molecular-weight thiols and posttranslational thiol modifications are omitted here for the sake of simplicity.) The cytosol is considerably more reduced compared with the extracellular space or the endoplasmic reticulum (where proper protein folding requires more oxidizing conditions). The redox couples, cysteine/cystine, GSH/GSSG, and protein-bound thiols, are not in equilibrium with each other, which suggests the involvement of specific enzyme systems that determine the steady-state levels of these species. Maintaining disequilibria requires energy, and energy tends to be allocated according to criteria that confer robustness of organisms along the evolutionary selection process. First steps into the direction of decoding what determines ATP utilization hierarchies at a systems level are being taken, but the mechanisms of regulation of systemic thiol/disulfide status remain largely obscure. Considering the inverse association of free thiols with risk of death, a further assessment of these relationships and their significance for the cellular stress responses, DNA repair processes, and other hard clinical endpoints seems to be justified. However, no number of observational studies will ever be able to establish causality; this will require prospective and interventional studies.Redox status is also linked to cell survival (193,222).

Several DNA repair enzymes, including poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, are under redox control (3), which may provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed association between plasma-free thiols and active disease. Similar processes are at work under conditions of strong emotional stresses, which are known to be associated with oxidative stress, poor immune function and health, lower telomerase activity, and telomere shortening (52). These observations are akin to what happens during normal aging, just at a higher pace. Thus, life stresses of any sort, perceived or real, seem to lead to accelerated (premature) aging. Since parallel monitoring of multiple stresses is energetically costly, integrated stress sensing will be a preferred option; bacteria realize this through distributed sensing of metabolic fluxes (106). A sizable portion of an organism's energy is spent processing sensory information (162), which enables stress tolerance; as the ability of cells to generate adequate levels of energy declines, housekeeping and acute repair processes are compromised and physiological function starts failing.structural monitoring and orchestration of the sophisticated repair processes during normal functioning (31).

        <p>The regulatory concepts outlined above, as viewed from the perspective of systems biology, may provide useful guidance in any search for prevention and treatment approaches in the emerging area of redox medicine. Based upon the notion that (i) a set of factors plays a dominant role in sensing environmental changes (O 2 , amino acid substrates around the arginine-methionine metabolome, and its cofactors), (ii) another set of factors acts as transducing elements (cysteine-based redox relays and the dynamic interplay of free reduced and oxidized, and protein-bound thiols), and that (iii) there are stable end products of the RSI (S,N,O-based stable metabolites), it is possible to create a conceptual framework, which places the complexities of these interactions into context and allows to interrogate the quality and quantity of the balance of forces among different components. The specificity of this approach will be guided not by predefined levels of normality of particular readouts (as commonly practiced in current medicine), but rather by understanding what determines the metabolic fluxes through these pathways (Fig. 6). Due to the interacting nature of the pattern and direction of flow through many pathways within a complex system, the nature and outcome of these interactions will differ depending upon context and circumstance from individual to individual. This underlies the basis of personalized medicine and indicates the diagnostic basis needed to develop rational therapeutic interventions that adequately meet the individual situation (Box 7). In the following, we will present our understanding of redox regulation in the context of health and disease and suggest methods to interrogate the activity status of its components and how to utilize these insights for the benefit of a personalized medicine approach.The regulatory concepts outlined above, as viewed from the perspective of systems biology, may provide useful guidance in any search for prevention and treatment approaches in the emerging area of redox medicine.

        <p>What defines health? Contemporary medicine still uses the same organ-based classification system physicians developed centuries ago to define disease symptoms. We have become better and better at treating diseases, but not necessarily at identifying the root cause of illness or just ''feeling sick'' (166). More often than not, disease itself is equated with dysfunction. The converse is our limited ability to define and measure what constitutes health. In medical diagnostic terms, it often means staying within perceived limits of the distribution of variations in simple physiological readouts (such as blood pressure, heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, and white blood count) and the absence of overt signs of organ/tissue damage. Systems biology has taught us much about the emergence of unpredicted states arising from the complex interaction of multiple, nonlinear interconnected systems and these lessons are now being incorporated into what constitutes systems medicine. To this end, good health is not merely a state defined by the absence of overt symptoms of disease, but includes overall mental and physical well-being and resilience to stress. Biomarkers of good health are in short supply and limited to a few markers of nutritional adequacy (e.g., amino acid, protein, and micronutrient status) and perceived levels of normality of markers associated with inflammation, oxidative stress cell aging (telomere length), and DNA methylation. However, the latter two tend to differ markedly between individuals and ethnicities and provide limited information about the origin of the problem or the reserve capacity of the regulatory systems affected. From a systems perspective, as long as an organism is alive, one can consider its subsystems to be functioning; however, perturbations may force them to deviate from their normal equilibria and setpoints. If severe enough, these perturbations may become obvious and observable as disease phenotype (e.g., elevated blood pressure, hyperglycemia), which may be interpreted as the price paid by the organism to stay fully operational. To this end, accelerated aging (and aging per se) may be viewed as a process that leads to a compromised capacity for repair and/or adaptive change, eventually culminating in system failure and death (217).What defines health?

        <p>Personalized medicine aims at providing individually tailored prevention and treatment strategies for patients. One important driver for this development is the realization that generic treatment approaches are not optimally addressing patients' needs. With an aging population and ever-rising healthcare costs, the idea is to provide tailored solutions matched to specific deviations from the desired equilibrium with the aim to improve population health. In the words of the Horizon2020 Advisory Group, personalized medicine is a medical model using characterization of individuals' phenotypes and genotypes (e.g., molecular profiling, medical imaging, and lifestyle data) for tailoring the right therapeutic strategy for the right person at the right time and/or to determine the predisposition to disease and/or to deliver timely and targeted prevention (see https://ec.europa.eu/research/ health/index.cfm?pg=policy&amp;policyname=personalised). The fascination with this concept transcends medicine as it goes well beyond the treatment with medical products to include a better understanding of how particular biological mechanisms and interactions of our body with environmental, nutritional, and infectious stresses [known as the exposome (210)] affect health and disease along the life course.

        <p>Targeted redox metabolomics for understanding disease processes Great methodological strides have been made in recent years to capture the entirety of genetic and transcriptomic events in an affordable manner. Beyond the use of multiple omics techniques for deep phenotyping, however, a sound understanding of the key drivers and mechanisms underlying disease processes and resilience is required. Importantly, the mere integration of genomics, transcriptomics, and pro-teomics does not provide any information about enzyme function/activity and metabolic pathways. Metabolomics, that is, the analysis of stable products of metabolic pathways, may offer a deeper level of information about the state of an organ or the entire organism and may therefore be a key enabling technique for personal/precision medicine (6). Much of the recent success of metabolomic approaches is linked to the rapid advancement in mass spectrometry-based techniques over the last two decades, but many technical obstacles are still to be overcome to extend the level of coverage typical of genomic approaches to metabolic events. Measuring the entire metabolome of every patient may remain beyond reach for some time, but a targeted approach covering key aspects appears realistic even today. FIG. 6. Simplified scheme visualizing the consequences of a reduced redox buffering capacity (redox reserve) due to bioenergetic limitations. Under normal physiological conditions, extracellular redox poise is subject to diurnal variations, fluctuating between more reducing (-) and more oxidizing (+) conditions (12). The capacity of a cell/organism to deal with changes in reductive and oxidative load is intimately linked to mitochondrial function. Enhanced mitochondrial activity is associated with higher oxidative stress, which affects the redox status of the local tissue microenvironment, while the activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain itself and mitochondrial intermediary metabolism are modulated by the local and global redox status (upper cartoon). An adequate bioenergetic reserve capacity allows redox stresses (oxidative stress induced by, for example, strenuous physical activity or reductive stress due to chronic overfeeding) into either direction to be comfortably accommodated without incurring damage to cellular constituents (upper panels); physiological redox fluctuations experienced in daily life situations are well within the normal buffering capacity. Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to impaired cellular bioenergetics, resulting in narrowing of a cell's or an organism's ability to buffer redox stresses, inflicting damage and/or compromising adaptive capacities (middle panels), which can result in severe impairment of redox regulatory events upon further bioenergetic challenge (lower panels). Under these conditions, significant damage may be inflicted (shaded areas), demanding the allocation of additional energy to cellular repair processes. According to these relationships, chronic stress triggers a vicious cycle that can lead to a condition associated with severely limited redox reserve capacity, compromising cellular surveillance and repair mechanisms and inviting cascading network failures. This notion is consistent with the links of AMP-activated protein kinase and aberrant mitochondrial gene expression with cellular stress, aging/degenerative processes and immune processes (186), molecular system energetics (159,160) in general, and the emerging concept of bioenergetic health, where redox biology controls the interface between bioenergetics, autophagy, and circadian control of metabolism (29,209). See also Box 7. Despite the advancements in untargeted metabolomics to identify and analyze complex patterns of metabolites, some of the low-abundance, polar, or volatile metabolites still pose analytical challenges; in particular, many of the highly reactive species of fleeting existence, for example, H 2 S and its per-and polysulfides belonging to the RSI, are currently only reliably quantifiable after chemical trapping, providing more stable derivatives (86,99). A disadvantage of such approaches is that they tend to perturb natural equilibria, not only complicating the interpretation of changes recorded but also introducing bias as their disappearance can elicit adaptive reactions not normally seen under physiological conditions.Targeted redox metabolomics for understanding disease processes Great methodological strides have been made in recent years to capture the entirety of genetic and transcriptomic events in an affordable manner. Beyond the use of multiple omics techniques for deep phenotyping, however, a sound understanding of the key drivers and mechanisms underlying disease processes and resilience is required. Importantly, the mere integration of genomics, transcriptomics, and pro-teomics does not provide any information about enzyme function/activity and metabolic pathways. Metabolomics, that is, the analysis of stable products of metabolic pathways, may offer a deeper level of information about the state of an organ or the entire organism and may therefore be a key enabling technique for personal/precision medicine (6). Much of the recent success of metabolomic approaches is linked to the rapid advancement in mass spectrometry-based techniques over the last two decades, but many technical obstacles are still to be overcome to extend the level of coverage typical of genomic approaches to metabolic events. Measuring the entire metabolome of every patient may remain beyond reach for some time, but a targeted approach covering key aspects appears realistic even today. FIG. 6. Simplified scheme visualizing the consequences of a reduced redox buffering capacity (redox reserve) due to bioenergetic limitations. Under normal physiological conditions, extracellular redox poise is subject to diurnal variations, fluctuating between more reducing (-) and more oxidizing (+) conditions (12). The capacity of a cell/organism to deal with changes in reductive and oxidative load is intimately linked to mitochondrial function. Enhanced mitochondrial activity is associated with higher oxidative stress, which affects the redox status of the local tissue microenvironment, while the activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain itself and mitochondrial intermediary metabolism are modulated by the local and global redox status (upper cartoon). An adequate bioenergetic reserve capacity allows redox stresses (oxidative stress induced by, for example, strenuous physical activity or reductive stress due to chronic overfeeding) into either direction to be comfortably accommodated without incurring damage to cellular constituents (upper panels); physiological redox fluctuations experienced in daily life situations are well within the normal buffering capacity.

        <p>What to measure where and how?What to measure where and how?</p>
        <p>To adequately capture the substrates utilized by the RSI for sensing and transduction processes, we propose to concentrate on those parts of intermediary metabolism that are central to the regulation of redox status and production of essential building blocks of life such as DNA/RNA, vitamins, amino acids/proteins, and fatty acids/lipids. Emphasis should be placed on integrative biomarkers faithfully reporting on multiple mechanisms operating in synchrony. Circulating homocysteine concentrations are a pertinent example as they represent a combined readout of methionine and vitamin B 6/12 availability, one-carbon metabolism (methionine recycling and tetrahydrofolate pathways), and flux through the transsulfuration pathway, an ancient pathway established almost 4 bya (208); there may well be many more among the markers we routinely assess today. Thus, besides capturing as many species as possible around these pathways to monitor bodily sulfur/SAA handling and H 2 S production, the arginine metabolome will be another sensible target to capture as it provides insight into nitrogen handling and NO-related processes. To describe the dynamics of the thiol regulatory system, we suggest quantifying the entirety of free and protein-bound thiols; differences in concentration of stable end products of the RSI in different compartments may serve as readouts of the sensing and adaptation system in operation. For sulfur hydrosulfide, per-and polysulfides, thiosulfate, and sulfate would seem to be useful readouts, complemented by ammonium, urea, nitrite, nitrate, nitroso, and nitrosyl species for the nitrogen products. Relevant clinically accessible compartments to analyze include blood (plasma and cellular components), saliva, sweat, urine, and exhaled breath.To adequately capture the substrates utilized by the RSI for sensing and transduction processes, we propose to concentrate on those parts of intermediary metabolism that are central to the regulation of redox status and production of essential building blocks of life such as DNA/RNA, vitamins, amino acids/proteins, and fatty acids/lipids.

        <p>To gain insight into the regulation of the entire system, whole-body responses to various stressors ought to be explored first in healthy individuals subjected to, for example, exercise versus rest, hypoxia versus normoxia, heat versus cold, fasting versus controlled feeding, and exposure to frequently prescribed or over-the-counter drugs such as antiinflammatories. This will form the basis for subsequent interrogations in diseased individuals and patients on specific drug regimens and allow disentangling the underlying redox network architecture using specific patient cohorts. Once we understand how the system is structured, organized, and able to sense in a way that enables control and regulation, The challenge of developing a dynamic map of redox interactions is related to placing the fundamental chemistry within a given physiological process or disease mechanism into spatial and temporal context. Although the RSI concept begins disentangling the fundamental interplay between the different reactive species and their biological targets, before their use in personalized medicine, specific mechanism-based biomarker panels need to be developed. To this end, the evolutionary origin of redox regulation, based fundamentally on the handling of various sulfur species, may provide a useful pointer since ''Nature does not waste a good chemical reaction''.To gain insight into the regulation of the entire system, whole-body responses to various stressors ought to be explored first in healthy individuals subjected to, for example, exercise versus rest, hypoxia versus normoxia, heat versus cold, fasting versus controlled feeding, and exposure to frequently prescribed or over-the-counter drugs such as antiinflammatories.

        <p>A case in point is nitrogen fixation and nitrate/nitrite reduction to make NO. Bacteria can produce NO either via ammonia oxidation (e.g., Nitrosomonas) or denitrification (e.g., Pseudomonas), giving rise to NO emanations from soil; plants use NO to stimulate cyclic GMP. Nitrite reductase is a P 450 -like enzyme that evolved into a NO synthase (NOS) using another source that connects important proliferative and immune responses to arginine metabolism. This evolution helps today's mammalian organisms regulate host defense mechanisms via modulation of mitochondrial respiration and intermediary metabolism (affecting bioenergetics and immunometabolism).A case in point is nitrogen fixation and nitrate/nitrite reduction to make NO.

        <p>The ultimate thermodynamic equation that connects evolution with precision medicine is that describing Gibbs free energy: DG = DH -TDS, where the fundamental reactions of small molecules depend mostly on DH or the energy of covalent bond making. However, in the biological context, DS means there are ever-increasing differentiated states/niches defined by the process of evolution. Precision medicine is by definition where DH meets DS. To get there involves a series of approximations: first, the DH of the fundamental chemical reactions (The RSI: Sensing and Transducing Elements section); second, interaction of the reactive species metabolome with macromolecules; third, cellular compartmentalization; fourth, tissue interactions; fifth, systemic physiological and inflammatory reactions; sixth, the genomic and epigenetic interaction with these processes; and seventh, the interaction between macroorganisms and microbiome, virome, and exposome (210).The ultimate thermodynamic equation that connects evolution with precision medicine is that describing Gibbs free energy: DG = DH -TDS, where the fundamental reactions of small molecules depend mostly on DH or the energy of covalent bond making.

        <p>Thermodynamics can tell us into which direction redox reactions may proceed, but it cannot tell us anything about their speed or indeed whether those reactions can ever be fast enough to be of biological significance. Overcoming energetic barriers by using substrate-specific enzymatic catalysis is an important first step, but just the beginning. Redox tunes systems through reaction rates (affecting concentrations), timing, and location-these factors provide precise targets that in nature are exploited to improve biological fitness. The challenge is to unveil how this chemical redox biology operates in health and disease using multibiomarker analysis (via omics) and imaging tools to determine location and timing. Such redox mapping will hold the key to novel therapeutics.Thermodynamics can tell us into which direction redox reactions may proceed, but it cannot tell us anything about their speed or indeed whether those reactions can ever be fast enough to be of biological significance.

        <p>The interactions between individual constituents of the RSI and key biological targets of the antioxidant network are complex. Hoping to disentangle the in vivo relationships for the benefit of defining treatment opportunities for redox medicine will require quantifying stable decomposition products and downstream metabolites of RSS, RNS, and ROS interaction, along with their substrates, in multiple biofluids, in health, and disease. Since we are not dealing with on/off reactions, it would be naive to expect that measuring a few biomarkers in health and comparing them with levels one observes in overt disease would suffice. The perils of oversimplification are nowhere more apparent than in the interpretation of circulating homocysteine concentrations (197). To capture the dynamics of regulation, we ought to measure the same set of readouts in healthy individuals of different sex/age under varying levels of physiological perturbation, (sedentary/exercise, normoxia/hypoxia, starved/ fed, etc.) and compare their steady-state levels under these conditions with concentrations in sex/age-matched patients suffering from specific diseases. By carefully matching the physiologic/ metabolic phenotypes to the profile of biochemical markers, we should be able to learn enough to decode the underlying network architecture. In turn, this will enable us to identify new avenues for targeted therapeutic modulation of redox signaling. Besides guiding pharmacological treatments, those insights may also aid in risk-stratifying patients before undergoing major surgery, improve recovery from critical illness or major trauma, and inform nutritional priorities for healthy aging.The interactions between individual constituents of the RSI and key biological targets of the antioxidant network are complex.
