        <p>Diffuse gliomas represent 80% of malignant brain tumors (Schwartzbaum et al., 2006). Adult diffuse gliomas are classified and graded according to histological criteria (oligodendroglioma, oligoastrocytoma, astrocytoma, and glioblastoma; grade II to IV). Although histopathologic classification is well established and is the basis of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of CNS tumors (Louis et al., 2007), it suffers from high intra-and inter-observer variability, particularly among grade II-III tumors (van den Bent, 2010). Recent molecular characterization studies have benefited from the availability of the datasets generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (Brennan et al., 2013;Eckel-Passow et al., 2015;Frattini et al., 2013;Kim et al., 2015;Suzuki et al., 2015;Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2015) and have related genetic, gene expression, and DNA methylation signatures with prognosis (Noushmehr et al., 2010;Sturm et al., 2012;Verhaak et al., 2010). For example, mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase genes 1 and 2 (IDH1/IDH2) define a distinct subset of glioblastoma (GBM) with a hypermethylation phenotype (G-CIMP) with favorable outcome (Noushmehr et al., 2010;Yan et al., 2009). Conversely, the absence of IDH mutations in LGG marks a distinct IDH-wild-type subgroup characterized by poor, GBM-like prognosis (Eckel-Passow et al., 2015;Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2015). Recent work by us and others has proposed classification of glioma into IDH wild-type cases, IDH mutant group additionally carrying codeletion of chromosome arm 1p and 19q (IDH mutant-codel) and samples with euploid 1p/19q (IDH mutant-non-codel), regardless of grade and histology (Eckel-Passow et al., 2015;Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2015). Mutation of the TERT promoter, which has been reported with high frequency across glioma, may be an additional defining feature. Current analyses have not yet clarified the relationships between LGGs and GBMs that share common genetic hallmarks like IDH mutation or TERT promoter mutation status. An improved understanding of these relationships will be necessary as we evolve toward an objective genome-based clinical classification.Diffuse gliomas represent 80% of malignant brain tumors (Schwartzbaum et al., 2006).

        <p>To address the above issues, we assembled a dataset comprising all TCGA newly diagnosed diffuse glioma consisting of 1,122 patients and comprehensively analyzed using sequencing and array-based molecular profiling approaches. We have addressed crucial technical challenges in analyzing this comprehensive dataset, including the integration of multiple platforms and data sources (e.g., multiple methylation and gene expression platforms). We identified new diffuse glioma subgroups with distinct molecular and clinical features and shed light on the mechanisms driving progression of lower grade glioma (LGG) (WHO grades II and III) into full-blown GBM (WHO grade IV).To address the above issues, we assembled a dataset comprising all TCGA newly diagnosed diffuse glioma consisting of 1,122 patients and comprehensively analyzed using sequencing and array-based molecular profiling approaches.

        <p>The TCGA LGG and GBM cohorts consist of 516 and 606 patients, respectively. Independent analysis of the GBM dataset was previously described, as was analysis of 290 LGG samples (Brennan et al., 2013;Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2015). 226 LGG samples were added to our current cohort (Table 1). Clinical data, including age, tumor grade, tumor histology, and survival, were available for 93% (1,046/1,122) of cases (Table S1). The majority of samples were grade IV tumors (n = 590, 56%), whereas 216 (21%) and 241 (23%) were grade II and III tumors, respectively. Similarly, 590 (56%) samples were classified as GBM, 174 (17%) as oligodendroglioma, 169 (16%) as astrocytoma, and 114 (11%) as oligoastrocytoma.The TCGA LGG and GBM cohorts consist of 516 and 606 patients, respectively.

        <p>LGG and 307 GBM using the Mutect, Indelocator, Varscan2, and RADIA algorithms and considered all mutations identified by at least two callers. Significantly mutated genes (SMGs) were determined using MutSigCV. This led to the identification of 75 SMGs, 10 of which had been previously reported in GBM (Brennan et al., 2013), 12 of which had been reported in LGG (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2015), and 8 of which had been identified in both GBM and LGG studies. 45 SMGs have not been previously associated with glioma and ranged in mutation frequency from 0.5% to 2.6% (Table S2A). We used GISTIC2 to analyze the DNA copy number profiles of 1,084 samples, including 513 LGG and 571 GBM, and identified 162 significantly altered DNA copy number segments (Table S2B). We employed PRADA and deFuse to detect 1,144 gene fusion events in the RNA-seq profiles available for 154 GBM and 513 LGG samples, of which 37 in-frame fusions involved receptor tyrosine kinases (Table S2C). Collectively, these analyses recovered all known glioma driving events, including in IDH1 (n = 457), TP53 (n = 328), ATRX (n = 220), EGFR (n = 314), PTEN (n = 168), CIC (n = 80), and FUBP1 (n = 45). Notable newly predicted glioma drivers relative to the earlier TCGA analyses were genes associated with chromatin organization such as SETD2 (n = 24), ARID2 (n = 20), DNMT3A (n = 11), and the KRAS/NRAS oncogenes (n = 25 and n = 5, respectively).LGG and 307 GBM using the Mutect, Indelocator, Varscan2, and RADIA algorithms and considered all mutations identified by at least two callers.

        <p>We overlapped copy number, mutation (n = 793), and fusion transcript (n = 649) profiles and confirmed the convergence of genetic drivers of glioma into pathways, including the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK, p53/apoptosis, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, chromatin modification, and cell cycle pathways. The Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling cascade showed alterations in 106 of 119 members detected across 578 cases (73%), mostly occurring in IDH-wildtype samples (n = 327 of 357, 92%). Conversely, we found that a set of 36 genes involved in chromatin modification was targeted by genetic alterations in 423 tumors (54%, n = 36 genes), most of which belonged to the IDH mutant-non-codel group (n = 230, 87%).We overlapped copy number, mutation (n = 793), and fusion transcript (n = 649) profiles and confirmed the convergence of genetic drivers of glioma into pathways, including the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK, p53/apoptosis, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, chromatin modification, and cell cycle pathways.

        <p>In order to identify new somatically altered glioma genes, we used MutComFocal to nominate candidates altered by mutation, as well as copy number alteration. Prominent among these genes was NIPBL, a crucial adherin subunit that is essential for loading cohesins on chromatin (Table S2D) (Peters and Nish-iyama, 2012). The cohesin complex is responsible for the adhesion of sister chromatids following DNA replication and is essential to prevent premature chromatid separation and faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis (Peters and Nishiyama, 2012). Alterations in the cohesin pathway have been reported in 12% of acute myeloid leukemias (Kon et al., 2013). Mutations of the cohesin complex gene STAG2 had been previously reported in GBM (Brennan et al., 2013). Taken together, 16% of the LGG/ GBM showed mutations and/or CNAs in multiple genes involved in the cohesin complex, thus nominating this process as a prominent pathway involved in gliomagenesis. Telomere Length Is Positively Correlated with ATRX, but Not TERT Promoter Mutations Mutations in the TERT promoter (TERTp) have been reported in 80% of GBM (Killela et al., 2013). We used TERTp mutation calls from targeted sequencing (n = 287) and complemented them with TERTp mutations inferred from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data (n = 42). TERTp mutations are nearly mutually exclusive with mutations in ATRX (Eckel-Passow et al., 2015), which was confirmed in our cohort. Overall, 85% of diffuse gliomas harbored mutations of TERTp (n = 157, 48%) or ATRX (n = 120, 37%). TERTp mutations activate TERT mRNA expression through the creation of a de novo E26 transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factor-binding site (Horn et al., 2013), and we observed significant TERT upregulation in TERTp mutant cases (p value &lt; 0.0001, Figure S1A). TERT expression measured by RNA-seq was a highly sensitive (91%) and specific (95%) surrogate for the presence of TERTp mutation (Figure S1B). We correlated TERTp status with glioma driving alterations and observed that nearly all IDH-wild-type cases with chromosome 7 gain and chromosome 10 loss harbored TERTp mutations or upregulated TERT expression (n = 52/53 and n = 134/147, respectively; Figure 1A). Conversely, only 45% of IDH-wild-type samples lacking chromosome 7/chromosome 10 events showed TERTp mutations or elevated TERT expression (n = 15/33 and n = 43/82, respectively). Thus, TERTp mutations may precede the chr 7/chr 10 alterations that have been implicated in glioma initiation (Ozawa et al., 2014). 1B) and tumor samples (Figure S1C). Glioma samples harboring ATRX mutations showed significantly longer telomeres compared to TERTp mutant samples (t test p value &lt; 0.0001; Figure 1C). Among TERTp mutation gliomas, there was no difference in telomere length between samples with and without additional IDH1/IDH2 mutations, despite a difference in age. ATRX forms a complex with DAXX and H3.3, and the genes encoding these proteins are frequently mutated in pediatric gliomas (Sturm et al., 2012). Mutations in DAXX and H3F3A were identified in only two samples in our WGS dataset. The ATRX-DAXX-H3.3 complex is associated with the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) and our observations confirm previously hypothesized fundamental differences between the telomere control exerted by telomerase and ALT (Sturm et al., 2014).In order to identify new somatically altered glioma genes, we used MutComFocal to nominate candidates altered by mutation, as well as copy number alteration.

        <p>As demonstrated by the identification of TERTp mutations, somatic variants affecting regulatory regions may play a role in gliomagenesis. Using 67 matched whole-genome and RNA-seq expression pairs, we similarly sought to identify mutations located within 2 kb upstream of transcription start sites and associated with a gene expression change. Using strict filtering methods, we identified 12 promoter regions with mutations in at least 6 samples. Three of 12 regions related to a significant difference in the expression of the associated gene expression, suggesting possible functional consequences. Other than TERT (n = 37), promoter mutations of the ubiquitin ligase TRIM28 (n = 8) and the calcium channel gamma subunit CACNG6 (n = 7) correlated with respectively upregulation and downregulation of these genes, respectively (Table S2E). TRIM28 has been reported to mediate the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) leading to activation of mTOR signaling and hypersensitization to AMPK agonists, such as metformin (Pineda et al., 2015).As demonstrated by the identification of TERTp mutations, somatic variants affecting regulatory regions may play a role in gliomagenesis.

        <p>To segregate the DNA methylation subtypes across the pan-glioma dataset, we analyzed 932 glioma samples profiled on the HumanMethylation450 platform ( 516LGG and 129 GBM) and the HumanMethylation27 platform (287 GBM). In order to incorporate the maximum number of samples, we merged datasets from both methylation platforms yielding a core set of 25,978 CpG probes. To reduce computational requirements to cluster this large dataset, we eliminated sites that were methylated (mean b value R 0.3) in non-tumor brain tissues and selected 1,300 tumor-specific methylated probes (1,300/25,978, 5%) to perform unsupervised k-means consensus clustering. This identified six distinct clusters, labeled LGm1-6 (Figure 2A and Tables S1 andS3A). Next, we sought to determine pan-glioma expression subtypes through unsupervised clustering analysis of 667 RNA-seq profiles (513 LGG and 154 GBM), which resulted in four main clusters labeled LGr1-4 (Figure 2B and Tables S1 andS3A). An additional 378 GBM samples with Affymetrix HT-HG-U133A profiles (but lacking RNA-seq data) were classified into the four clusters using a k-nearest neighbor classification procedure. IDH mutation status was the primary driver of methylome and transcriptome clustering and separated the cohort into two macro-groups. The LGm1/LGm2/LGm3 DNA methylation macro-group carried IDH1 or IDH2 mutations (449 of 450, 99%) and was enriched for LGG (421/454, 93%) while LGm4/To segregate the DNA methylation subtypes across the pan-glioma dataset, we analyzed 932 glioma samples profiled on the HumanMethylation450 platform ( 516LGG and 129 GBM) and the HumanMethylation27 platform (287 GBM).

        <p>LGm5/LGm6 were IDH-wild-type (429/430, 99%) and enriched for GBM (383/478, 80%). LGm1-3 showed genome-wide hypermethylation compared to LGm4-6 clusters (Figure S2A), documenting the association between IDH mutation and increased DNA methylation (Noushmehr et al., 2010;Turcan et al., 2012). Principal component analysis using 19,520 probes yielded similar results, thus emphasizing that our probe selection method did not introduce unwanted bias (Figure S2B). The gene expression clusters LGr1-3 harbored IDH1 or IDH2 mutations (438 of 533, 82%) and were enriched for LGG (436/563, 77%), while the LGr4 was exclusively IDH-wild-type (376 of 387, 97%) and enriched for GBM (399/476, 84%).LGm5/LGm6 were IDH-wild-type (429/430, 99%) and enriched for GBM (383/478, 80%).

        <p>We extended our analysis using Tumor Map (Supplemental Experimental Procedures) to perform integrated co-clustering analysis of the combined gene expression (n = 1,196) and DNA methylation (n = 867) profiles. An interactive Tumor Map version is publicly available at http://tumormap.ucsc.edu/?p=ynewton. gliomas-paper. Tumor Map assigns samples to a hexagon in a grid so that nearby samples are likely to have similar genomic profiles and allows visualizing complex relationships between heterogeneous genomic data samples and their clinical or phenotypical associations. Thus, clusters in the map indicate groups of samples with high similarity of integrated gene expression and DNA methylation profiles (Figure 2C). The map confirms clustering by IDH status and additionally shows islands of samples that share previously reported GBM cluster memberships (Noushmehr et al., 2010;Verhaak et al., 2010). To assess clustering sensitivity to pre-processing, we tried complementary methods and obtained similar results (Figure S2C).We extended our analysis using Tumor Map (Supplemental Experimental Procedures) to perform integrated co-clustering analysis of the combined gene expression (n = 1,196) and DNA methylation (n = 867) profiles. An interactive Tumor Map version is publicly available at http://tumormap.ucsc.edu/?p=ynewton. gliomas-paper. Tumor Map assigns samples to a hexagon in a grid so that nearby samples are likely to have similar genomic profiles and allows visualizing complex relationships between heterogeneous genomic data samples and their clinical or phenotypical associations. Thus, clusters in the map indicate groups of samples with high similarity of integrated gene expression and DNA methylation profiles (Figure 2C).

        <p>To identify genes whose copy number changes are associated with concordant changes in gene expression, we combined expression and copy number profiles from 659 samples to define a signature of 57 genes with strong functional copy number (fCN) change (Table S3B). The fCN signature clustered gliomas into three macro-clusters, LGfc1-3, strongly associated with IDH and 1p/19q status (Figure S2D). The fCN analysis revealed the functional activation of a cluster of HOXA genes in the IDHwild-type LGfc2 cluster, which were previously associated with glioma stem cell maintenance (Kurscheid et al., 2015).To identify genes whose copy number changes are associated with concordant changes in gene expression, we combined expression and copy number profiles from 659 samples to define a signature of 57 genes with strong functional copy number (fCN) change (Table S3B).

        <p>Finally, we clustered reverse phase protein array profiles, consisting of 196 antibodies on 473 samples. Two macro clusters were observed, and in contrast to the transcriptome/methylome/fCNV clustering, the primary discriminator was based on glioma grade (LGG versus GBM) rather than IDH status (Figure S2E). Compared to the LGG-like cluster, the GBM-like cluster had elevated expression of IGFBP2, fibronectin, PAI1, HSP70, EGFR, phosphoEGFR, phosphoAKT, Cyclin B1, Caveolin, Collagen VI, Annexin1, and ASNS, whereas the LGG class showed increased activity of PKC (alpha, beta, and delta), PTEN, BRAF, and phosphoP70S6K.Finally, we clustered reverse phase protein array profiles, consisting of 196 antibodies on 473 samples.

        <p>The above results confirm IDH status as the major determinant of the molecular footprints of diffuse glioma. To further elucidate the subtypes of diffuse glioma, we performed unsupervised clustering within each of the two IDH-driven macroclusters. We used 1,308 tumor-specific CpG probes defined among the IDH mutation cohort (n = 450) and identified three IDH mutant-specific DNA methylation clusters (Figure S3A). Using 914 tumor-specific CpG probes in the IDH-wild-type cohort (n = 430), we uncovered three IDH-wild-type-specific clusters (Figure S4A). The sets of CpG probes used to cluster each of the two IDH-driven datasets overlapped significantly with the 1,300 probes that defined the pan-glioma DNA methylation clustering (1162/1,300, 89% and 853/1,300, 66%, for IDH mutant and IDH-wild-type, respectively). The clusters identified by separating IDH mutant and IDH-wild-type gliomas showed strong overall concordance with pan-glioma DNA methylation subtypes (Table S3A). Similarly, unsupervised clustering of 426 IDH mutant RNA-seq profiles resulted in three subtypes (Figure S3A), and analysis of the 234 IDH-wild-type samples led to four mixed LGG/GBM clusters that showed enrichment for previously identified GBM expression subtypes (Figure S4C) (Verhaak et al., 2010).The above results confirm IDH status as the major determinant of the molecular footprints of diffuse glioma.

        <p>LGG and GBM with Unfavorable Clinical Outcome The three epigenetic subtypes defined by clustering IDH mutant glioma separated samples harboring the 1p/19q co-deletion into a single cluster and non-codel glioma into two clusters (Figure S3A). Conversely, non-codel glioma grouped nearly exclusively into a single expression cluster, and codels were split in two separated expression clusters (Figure S3A). A distinct subgroup of samples within the IDH mutant-non-codel DNA methylation clusters manifested relatively reduced DNA methylation (Figure S3B). The unsupervised clustering of IDH mutant glioma was unable to segregate the lower methylated non-codel subgroup as the 1,308 probes selected for unsupervised clustering included only 19 of the 131 differentially methylated probes characteristic for this subgroup (FDR &lt; 10 À15 , difference in mean methylation beta value &gt; 0.27). The low-methylation subgroup consisted of both G-CIMP GBM (13/25) and LGGs (12/25) and was confirmed using a non-TCGA dataset (Figure S3C). The tumors with higher methylation in the split cluster were very similar to those grouped in the second non-codel cluster, and a supervised comparison identified only 12 probes as differentially DNA methylated (Figures 3A and3B). We concluded that IDH mutant glioma is composed of three coherent subgroups: (1) the Codel group, consisting of IDH mutant-codel LGGs; (2) the G-CIMPlow group, including IDH mutant-non-codel glioma (LGG and GBM) manifesting relatively low genome-wide DNA methylation; and (3) the G-CIMP-high group, including IDH mutant-non-codel glioma (LGG and GBM) with higher global levels of DNA methylation. The newly identified G-CIMP-low group of glioma was associated with significantly worse survival as compared to the G-CIMP-high and Codel groups (Figure S3D). The clinical outcome of the tumors classified as G-CIMP-high was as favorable as that of Codel tumors, the subgroup generally thought to have the best prognosis among glioma patients (Figures 3C andS3D). We compared the frequencies of glioma driver gene alterations between the three types of IDH mutant glioma and found that 15 of 18 G-CIMP-low cases carried abnormalities in cell cycle pathway genes such as CDK4 and CDKN2A, relative to 36/241 and 2/172 for G-CIMP-high and Codels, respectively (Figure 3D). Supervised analysis between gene expression of G-CIMP-low and G-CIMP-high resulted in 943 differentially expressed genes. We mapped the 943 deregulated genes to 767 nearest CpG probes (max distance 1 kb) and found the majority of the CpG probes (486/767, 63%) to show a significant methylation difference (FDR &lt; 0.05, difference in mean methylation beta value &gt; 0.01) between G-CIMP-low and G-CIMP-high, suggesting a mechanistic relation between loss of methylation and increased transcript levels.LGG and GBM with Unfavorable Clinical Outcome The three epigenetic subtypes defined by clustering IDH mutant glioma separated samples harboring the 1p/19q co-deletion into a single cluster and non-codel glioma into two clusters (Figure S3A).

        <p>Recent analysis of epigenetic profiles derived from colon cancers showed that transcription factors may bind to regions of demethylated DNA (Berman et al., 2012). Therefore, we asked whether transcription factors may be recruited to the DNA regions differentially methylated between G-CIMP-low samples and G-CIMP-high samples from the same methylation cluster, using 450K methylation profiles (n = 39). Globally, we detected 643 differentially methylated probes between 27 G-CIMP-low and 12 G-CIMP-high samples (absolute diff-mean difference R 0.25, FDR % 5%). Most of these probes (69%) were located outside of any known CpG island but positioned within intergenic regions known as open seas (Figure 3E). This represents a 2.5-fold open sea enrichment compared to the expected genome-wide distribution of 450K CpG probes (chisquare p value &lt; 2.2 3 10 À16 ). We also observed a 3.4-fold depletion within CpG islands (chi-square p value &lt; 2.2 3 10 À16 ).Recent analysis of epigenetic profiles derived from colon cancers showed that transcription factors may bind to regions of demethylated DNA (Berman et al., 2012).

        <p>Using this set of intergenic CpG probes, we asked whether a DNA motif signature associated with distal regulatory elements. Such a pattern would point to candidate transcription factors involved in tumorigenesis of the G-CIMP-low group. A de novo motif scan and known motif scan identified a distinct motif signature TGTT (geometric test p value = 10 À11 , fold enrichment = 1.8), known to be associated with the OLIG2 and SOX transcription factor families (Figure 3E) (Lodato et al., 2013). This observation was corroborated by the higher expression levels of SOX2, as well as 17 out of 20 other known SOX family members in G-CIMP-low compared to G-CIMP-high (fold difference &gt; 2). The primary function of SOX2 in the nervous system is to promote self-renewal of neural stem cells and, within brain tumors, the glioma stem cell state (Graham et al., 2003). Interestingly, SOX2 and OLIG2 have been described as neurodevelopmental transcription factors being essential for GBM propagation (Suva èt al., 2014). Supervised gene expression pathway analysis of the genes activated in the G-CIMP-low group as opposed to G-CIMP-high group revealed activation of genes involved in cell cycle and cell division consistent with the role of SOX in promoting cell proliferation (Figure S3E). The enrichment in cell cycle gene expression provides additional support to the notion that development of the G-CIMP-low subtype is associated with activation of cell cycle progression and may be mediated by a loss of CpG methylation and binding of SOX factors to candidate genomic enhancer elements.Using this set of intergenic CpG probes, we asked whether a DNA motif signature associated with distal regulatory elements.

        <p>To validate the G-CIMP-low, G-CIMP-high, and Codel IDH mutant subtypes, we compiled a validation cohort from published studies, including 324 adult and pediatric gliomas (Lambert et al., 2013;Mur et al., 2013;Sturm et al., 2012;Turcan et al., 2012). The CpG probe methylation signatures used to classify the validation set are provided on the publication portal accompanying this publication (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/ docs/publications/lgggbm_2015/). Among them, 103 were identified as IDH mutant on the basis of their genome-wide DNA methylation profile. We classified samples in the validation set using the probes that defined the IDH mutant-specific DNA methylation cluster analysis integrated in a supervised random forest method. The analysis recapitulated the clusters generated from the TCGA collection (Figure S3C). In order to determine epigenetically regulated (EReg) genes that may be characteristic of the biology of the IDH mutant diffuse glioma subtypes, we compared 450k methylation DNA methylation profiles and gene expression levels between 636 IDH mutant and IDH-wildtype gliomas and 110 non-tumor samples from 11 different tissue types. From the list of epigenetically regulated genes, we extracted 263 genes that were grouped into EReg gene signatures, which showed differential signals among the three IDH mutant subtypes (Figure 3F).

        <p>We investigated the possibility that the G-CIMP-high group is a predecessor to the G-CIMP-low group by comparing the DNA methylation profiles from ten IDH mutant-non-codel LGG and GBM primary-recurrent cases with the TCGA cohort.

Four out of ten IDHmut-non-codel cases showed a demethylation pattern after disease recurrence, while partial demethylation was demonstrated in the remaining six recurrences, supporting the notion of a progression from G-CIMPhigh to G-CIMP-low phenotype (Figure 3H).We investigated the possibility that the G-CIMP-high group is a predecessor to the G-CIMP-low group by comparing the DNA methylation profiles from ten IDH mutant-non-codel LGG and GBM primary-recurrent cases with the TCGA cohort.

The frequency of mutations, fusions, and amplifications in eight PA-associated genes (BRAF, NF1, NTRK1, NTRK2, FGFR1, and FGFR2) rated from 11% (n = 12/113) of Classic-like, 13% (n = 21/158) of Mesenchymal-like IDH-wild-type tumors to 32% (n = 7/22) of LGm6-GBM and 52% (n = 13/25) of PA-like LGG (Fisher's exact test [FET] p value &lt; 0.0001; Figure 4C). Conversely, only 2 of 25 (8%) PA-like LGG tumors showed TERT expression, compared to 5 of 12 LGm6-GBM (43%), 60 of 65 Classic-like (92%), and 82 of 98 Mesenchymal-like (84%, FET p value &lt; 0.0001). The PA-like group was characterized by relatively low frequency of typical GBM alterations in genes such as EGFR, CDKN2A/B, and PTEN and displayed euploid DNA copy number profiles (Figure S4E). To ascertain that the histologies of the PA-like subgroup had been appropriately classified, we conducted an independent re-review. This analysis confirmed the presence of the histologic features of diffuse glioma (grade II or grade III) in 23 of the 26 cases in the cluster. The remaining three cases were re-named as PA (grade I). An independent review of the magnetic resonance diagnostic images from 13 cases showed a similar pattern, with the majority of tumors showing behavior consistent with grade II or grade III glioma.

        <p>Through comparison of the methylation profiles of 636 glioma and 110 non-neoplastic normal samples from different tissue types, we defined EReg signatures consisting of 27 genes that showed differential signals among IDH-wild-type subtypes in the TCGA (Figure 4D) and the validation set (Figure 4E). EReg4 comprised a group of 15 genes hypermethylated and downregulated in particularly Classic-like. EReg5 was defined as a group of 12 genes associated with hypomethylation in LGm6/PA-like compared to all other LGm clusters. These ERegs aided in characterizing the biological importance of IDH-wild-type subtypes and were subsequently used to evaluate the prognostic importance of the IDH-wild-type clusters.Through comparison of the methylation profiles of 636 glioma and 110 non-neoplastic normal samples from different tissue types, we defined EReg signatures consisting of 27 genes that showed differential signals among IDH-wild-type subtypes in the TCGA (Figure 4D) and the validation set (Figure 4E).

        <p>In order to assess whether the DNA methylation-based subtypes we identified carry prognostically relevant information independent of known overall survival predictors, we constructed a series of survival regression models. To find the optimal model for survival prediction, we studied covariates individually and in combination with other covariates. Age at diagnosis, histology, IDH/codel subtype, TERT expression, and epigenetic subtype all contribute to survival in single-predictor analysis (log-rank p value &lt; 0.05, Table S4). As expected, age was a highly significant predictor (p &lt; 0.0001, C-Index 0.78) and was included in all subsequent multi-predictor models. We found that histology and grade are highly correlated. Histology provided only marginal improvement to a model that includes grade (likelihood ratio test [LRT] p value = 0.08) and was therefore not included in further analyses. Conversely, grade markedly impacted a histol-ogy-based predictor model (LRT p value = 0.0005, Table S4) and was retained in the subsequent models. In contrast to previous reports (Eckel-Passow et al., 2015), we failed to observe a statistically significant and independent survival association with TERT expression (LRT p value = 0.82, Table S4) or TERTp mutations after accounting for age and grade (LRT p value = 0.85, data not shown). Thus, the optimal survival prediction model includes age, grade, and epigenetic subtype (LRT p value &lt; 0.0001, C-Index 0.836; Table 2).In order to assess whether the DNA methylation-based subtypes we identified carry prognostically relevant information independent of known overall survival predictors, we constructed a series of survival regression models.

        <p>We observed that, in spite of morphological differences between LGG and GBM, such as high cell density and microvascular proliferation, clustering of gene expression profiles frequently grouped LGG and GBM together within the same subtype. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of the genes activated in G-CIMP GBM as opposed to the IDH mutant-non-codel within LGr3 (Figure 2B) revealed four major groups, including cell cycle and hyperproliferation, DNA metabolic processes, response to stress, and angiogenesis (Figure S5A and Table S5). These biological functions are consistent with the criteria based on mitotic index used by pathologists to discriminate lower and high-grade glioma and the significance of activated microglia for tumor aggressiveness (Roggendorf et al., 1996).

        <p>This study represents the largest multi-platform genomic analysis performed to date of adult diffuse glioma (WHO grades II, III, and IV). A simplified graphical summary of the identified groups and their main clinical and biological characteristics is reported in Figure 5. The clustering of all diffuse glioma classes and grades within similarly shaped methylation-based and expression-based groups has allowed us to pinpoint specific molecular signatures with clinical relevance. The DNA methylation classification proposed should be considered as a basis and it is likely that future studies involving significantly larger cohorts and more refined profiling methods will be able to further reduce intra-subtype heterogeneity. The dissection of the IDH mutant non-codel G-CIMP LGG and GBM into two separate subgroups (G-CIMP-low and G-CIMP-high) based on the extent of genome-wide DNA methylation has crucial biological and clinical relevance. In particular, the identification of the G-CIMP-low subset, characterized by activation of cell cycle genes mediated by SOX binding at hypomethylated functional genomic elements and unfavorable clinical outcome, is an important finding that will guide more accurate segregation and therapeutic assessment in a group of patients in which correlations of conventional grading with outcome are modest (Olar et al., 2015;Reuss et al., 2015). The finding that G-CIMP-high tumors can emerge as G-CIMPlow glioma at recurrence identifies variations in DNA methylation as crucial determinants for glioma progression and provides a clue to the mechanisms driving evolution of glioma. Our results unify previous observations that linked the cell cycle pathway to malignant progression of low-grade glioma (Mazor et al., 2015). Future updates of the TCGA glioma clinical annotation and independent validation of our findings may be able to consider additionally important clinical confounders such as extent of resection and performance status to further optimize the weights of the currently known prognostic variables and their association to the molecular subtypes we identified.This study represents the largest multi-platform genomic analysis performed to date of adult diffuse glioma (WHO grades II, III, and IV).

        <p>Integrative analysis of 1,122 adult gliomas resulted in 7 different subtypes with distinct biological and clinical characteristics. The groups extend across six DNA methylation subtypes of which the LGm6 cluster was further separated by tumor grade into PA-like and LGm6-GBM.

        <p>MuTect (Cibulskis et al., 2013) was used to call somatic mutations on 89 matched primary tumornormal pairs. We required a minimum coverage of 14 in the tumor sample and 8 in the normal sample. Variants known to dbSNP v132 and unknown to COSMIC v54 were filtered resulting in 714,305 variants. Using these samples we used overlapping RNA-seq expression data to form an integrated dataset of 67 pairs (29 GBM,38 LGG). In order to identify potential promoter sites we used the GENCODE v19 transcript annotation (n= 196,520 transcripts) and used a subset of 24,001 transcripts that have an exact UniProt database match and has been curated according to known clinically relevant protein changes (Ramos et al., 2015). We then reduced the transcripts down to one transcript per gene (n=17,722 transcripts). For each remaining transcript we then took a region spanning from 2,000 bp upstream of the transcription start site and 200 bp into the coding region.MuTect (Cibulskis et al., 2013) was used to call somatic mutations on 89 matched primary tumornormal pairs.

We removed regions with hits from less than 7 unique samples, removed regions which were upstream of genes lacking RNA-seq counts or counts that were lacking any variability, removed regions in which the variants had a median of read count of 1 or more alternate reads in the matching normal. This filtering resulted in 141 mutations across 12 putative promoter regions (Table S2E). For each of the remaining gene promoter regions we then performed a t-test and a mann-whitney-U test comparing the log2 normalized gene expression counts in mutant cases to wild type cases. When we subsequently filtered out promoter regions with a Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted gene expression correlation Q-value &lt; 0.05 only three promoter regions remained including TERT, TRIM28 and CACNG6.

        <p>Tumor and normal samples were profiled on Affymetrix SNP6.0 GeneChip arrays and subsequently processed into genome segmentation files (McCarroll et al., 2008). The tool 
            <rs type="software">GISTIC</rs>
            <rs type="version">2.0</rs> was then used to identify significantly reoccurring focal and broad copy number changes (Mermel et al., 2011). Events with a Q-value &lt; 0.10 were considered significant. In order to identify low-frequent subtype specific events, we ran GISTIC both across the entire cohort (n=1084) and smaller subsets within DNA methylation clusters (n=6 groups), RNA expression clusters (n=4 groups) and IDH-codel subtypes (n=3 groups). For each statistically significant peak, GISTIC 2.0 indicates a narrow focal peak and a wider surrounding peak. We intersected all overlapping focal peaks across all GISTIC run and identified 57 disjoint amplified regions and 105 deleted regions. Using this method, while drastically limiting the number of genes compared to using the wide peak boundaries, we were still about to find 80% of genes that were considered as potential tumor drivers in previous studies.

In order to further narrow down the list of genes per peak and to identify potential tumor drivers, we sought to correlate copy number change to gene expression and prioritized genes in which we found significant mutations. Using this method, we were able find evidence for several new tumor drivers including GIGYF2 loss, ERRFI1 loss, ARID2 loss and FGFR2 gain.

        <p>By considering both copy number and somatic mutation data of LGG/GBM samples, we applied the algorithm of MutComFocal (Trifonov et al., 2013). Particularly, focality score and recurrence score were calculated based on samples with at least 10 and at most 1,000 copy number segments. The focality score assigns equal weight to all genes participating in a genomic alteration inversely proportional to the size of that alteration, while recurrence score assigns equal weight to all genes altered in a sample inversely proportional to the total number of gene altered in the sample (Frattini et al., 2013;Trifonov et al., 2013).By considering both copy number and somatic mutation data of LGG/GBM samples, we applied the algorithm of MutComFocal (Trifonov et al., 2013).

The union of the two matrices was then normalized using within-lane normalization to adjust for GC-content effect on read counts and upper-quantile between-lane normalization for distributional differences between lanes applying the TCGAanalyze_Normalization() function encompassing EDASeq protocol. Gene selected for clustering were chosen by applying two filters, the first was aimed a reducing the batch effect between the two tumor cohorts. We computed differentially expressed genes with

We then applied variability filters that select genes having a sufficiently high variation (100%) between the mean of top 5% and the mean of the bottom 5% values and having these means respectively above and below the overall median value of the data matrix. The filtering steps resulted in 2,275 genes that were used for the consensus clustering.

        <p>We utilized the ComBat batch effect removal method (Johnson et al., 2007) in order to combine mRNA expression data from the GBM RNA-seq (n=154), GBM Agilent (n=525), LGG RNA-seq (n=513), and LGG Agilent (n=27) datasets. We chose to use data generated using Agilent microarray platform over those generated using

We combined the 4 datasets and ran ComBat. We flagged 4 batches, one for each dataset, to be removed by the ComBat method. One hundred and forty nine GBM samples were analyzed using both Agilent and RNA-seq platforms. Twenty seven LGG samples were analyzed using both Agilent and RNA-seq platforms. We utilized these matched samples as biological covariates in the ComBat method. Upon completion of the data transformation, we removed all redundant samples analyzed using the Agilent platform whenever the sample was also analyzed using RNA-seq. This combined mRNA expression dataset (n=1043) was used for Tumor Map analysis.

        <p>We used Spearman rank correlation (Spearman, 1904) on these continuous variable data (mRNA and methylation). To build maps based on a single data type, for each sample the closest neighborhood of 10 samples is selected. The Tumor Map method represents these local neighborhoods as a graph. The edge weight in this graph is proportional to the magnitude of the similarity metric. Then spring-embedded graph layout (Golbeck and Mutton, 2005) algorithm is applied to the constructed graph. The spring-embedded layout algorithm treats edges as springs and allows the springs to oscillate for a fixed amount of time with the energy inversely proportional to the edge weights. Under these conditions, springs with large weights do not oscillate much, causing those vertices to stay together. However, springs with small weights oscillate more and end up farther away from each other. The method then projects the positions of all the vertices in the resulting graph layout onto a two-dimensional grid. Each cell in the grid allows only one vertex to be placed into it. If multiple vertices contest for the same grid cell, a random vertex selection is made and placed into the cell; and the other competing vertices are placed into the nearest empty cell, snapping around the original cell in a spiral-like manner. Thus, dense clumps of samples are separated so that they can be viewed at approximately the same scale as the distances that separate them. After computing pairwise sample similarities in the gene expression and DNA methylation space separately, the two similarity spaces are combined after standardizing each space was standardized.We used Spearman rank correlation (Spearman, 1904) on these continuous variable data (mRNA and methylation).

        <p>We computed sample pairwise similarities for each data type separately, producing a square samples-by-samples similarity matrix. For each of the similarity matrices, we perform bivariate standardization by transforming each value to be an arithmetic mean of the z-scores of this value within both the row and the column empirical distributions. This method is an adaptation of the approach by Faith et. al (2007). Once each of the similarity matrices is transformed into a z-score space, we combine each available z-scores (from N platforms) for each pair of samples by taking a weighted average of the z-scores, where the weights indicate the importance of each of the N platforms being combined. When genomic data for a given platform is not available for at least one of the samples from the pair, a pairwise similarity for this pair will not be available for this platform.We computed sample pairwise similarities for each data type separately, producing a square samples-by-samples similarity matrix.

        <p>We used mRNA expression for samples available through RNA-seq platform only and the CNV data to transform the data into inferred pathway activity levels using PARADIGM (Vaske et al., 2010). We then considered a number of dichotomies, such as LGm1 GBM vs. LGG (see Table S5). Some of the dichotomies we considered have significantly different numbers of samples in each class (see Table S5). In order to make statistically strong inferences about pathway activities we only considered those dichotomies in which both classes are well represented by their members and the variance within the classes is much smaller than the variance between the classes. In other words, we selected those dichotomies where sample scatter is small within the classes and classes are separable in the pathway space. Based on the PARADIGM IPLs (Inferred Pathway Levels) we computed pair-wise Spearman rank correlation for each pair of samples. We then computed withinclass and between-class variance of the correlations, first for the first class and then for the second class. We then computed the F-statistic for each of the classes in the dichotomy and the p-value based on the F-distribution. We aggregated the p-value for the dichotomy by computing the mean pvalue. We selected those dichotomies that had an aggregated p-value of &lt;= 0.05. Table S5 shows final dichotomies analyzed for the differential pathway activities. For each dichotomy selected, we computed differential activity levels using the linear models for microarrays and RNA-seq data (LIMMA) method (Smyth, 2005). We then applied Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al., 2005) to the HUGO members of the full differential vector. We extracted only those pathways that had FDR-adjusted q-value of &lt;= 0.1. At the same time, we extracted statistically significant differentials (multiple hypothesis adjusted p-value &lt;= 0.05). We ran 
            <rs type="software">PATHMARK</rs> (
            <rs type="creator">Cancer Genome Atlas Research</rs>, 2013) on the statistically significant differential activities obtained from 
            <rs type="software">LIMMA</rs> to extract connected components of the global PARADIGM regulatory network. An additional filter of 3 standard deviations was applied to the PATHMARK method. This means only those activities that fall outside 3 standard deviations of the empirical distribution of the statistically significant differentials pass through the filter. A network connection is extracted if both vertices connected by that connection pass the filter. For each pathway gene set that passed the GSEA q-value of 0.1 we computed the overlap of the pathway genes and those that survived the PATHMARK filter as well as the over-representation hypergeometric p-value. We then extracted those pathways that passed with the p-value of &lt;= 0.05. Figure S5E shows an overview of the process for extracting significantly active pathway from the glioma data. Figures S5C-D show pathway views of the significant IPLs from Table S5 in which IPLs representing families, complexes, phopho-events and redundant complexes were removed for better visualization. The training set was used to train an Empirical Bayes (Johnson et al., 2007) based model, which was then applied to the testing set. The testing set was used to figure out which genes didn't merge well by using a t-test to find the genes with the most differences between the platforms. The process was repeated 1000 times by using a bootstrapping approach for the training set. The top 3000 genes that were consistently found to be the most variable in the testing set were removed from the data set. The resulting model was then applied to the validation set, after removing those 3000 genes, to evaluate the algorithm. The evaluations showed that all 43 of the replicate pairs in the validation set clustered in matched pairs. The median of Pearson's correlations between the matched pairs was 0.23 before adjustment and 0.93 after adjustment, indicating very successful merging. We then applied the model to the full GBM and LGG dataset to perform overall merging, and then removed duplicates by randomly keeping one sample from the pairs. The final dataset had 1032 samples and 12,717 genes.

            <rs type="software">Ingenuity Pathway Analysis</rs> (IPA) was used to generate downstream networks for the top ranking transcription factors. Rank of the transcription factor is defined based on fold change between the two groups and the number of transcription factor binding sites in the promoter region of the target genes. Twelve transcription factor families were found to have log fold change of &gt;1 between the IDH mut and IDHwt groups. The ones with the highest number of target genes are NKX2-5, PAX8, ETV7, CEBPD, ETV4, ELF4, and NFE2L3. Several of these TFs have been shown to be important for carcinogenesis. For example, Pax8 has been shown to be minimally expressed in LGG and normal brain but highly expressed in glioblastoma (Hung et al., 2014) and plays a role in telomerase regulation (Chen et al., 2008). Similarly, enrichment of the pro-proliferative TF ETV4 in 1p/19q codeleted gliomas has been demonstrated (Gleize et al., 2015).

        <p>Methods to capture tumor-specific DNA methylation probes were used as recently described (Cancer Genome Atlas Research, 2014b) and is provided here as reference, with slight modifications to the total numbers. We used the Level 3 DNA methylation data contained in the packages listed above for analyses. We first removed probes which had any "NA"-masked data points and probes that were designed for sequences on X and Y chromosomes. We selected CpG sites that are located in high CpG density regions (top 25% of the sites with the highest observed/expected CpG ratio around their 3kb regions spanning from 1,500 bp upstream to 1,500 bp downstream of the transcription start sites) and CpGs associated with CpG islands extracted from the 
            <rs type="software">UCSC Genome Browser</rs> (
            <rs type="url">http://genome.ucsc.edu)</rs>. To capture cancer-specific DNA hypermethylation events, we further eliminated sites that were methylated (mean β-value ≥0.3) in histologically non-tumor brain tissues (Guintivano et al., 2013). This selection method reduced the initial 25,978 probes to 1,300 glioma-specific CpG probes, which corresponded to 6.5% of the full available data. However, a clustering analysis can be strongly confounded by the purity of tumor samples. To alleviate the potential influence of variable levels of tumor purity in our sample set on our clustering result, we dichotomized the data using a β-value of &gt;0.3 as a threshold for positive DNA methylation. We then performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering on 1,300 CpG sites with this threshold that are methylated in at least 10% of the tumors using a binary distance metric for clustering and Ward's method for linkage. The cluster assignments were generated by cutting the resulting dendrogram. The probes are arranged based on the order of unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the dichotomous data using a binary distance metric and Ward's linkage method. We identified six groups (LGm1-LGm6) shown in Figure 2A generated based on the original β-values to visualize 1,300 CpG sites used in the clustering.

        <p>To increase our statistical power, we decided to evaluate epigenetically regulated genes using the Pan-glioma subtypes, which allowed us to use the entire TCGA glioma cohort. We selected tumor samples that have both DNA methylation and RNA-sequencing based gene expression data to do this analysis, resulting in 636 samples ( 513LGG and 123 GBM). We also randomly selected 110 non-tumor TCGA samples from 11 different tissues (https://tcgadata.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/lgggbm_2015/), profiled using the same platforms. Each DNA methylation probe was mapped to the nearest UCSC gene, and after merging the DNA methylation and gene expression data, we retained a total of 19,530 pairs of DNA methylation and gene expression probes. We organized the tumor samples as either methylated (β &gt;= 0.3) or unmethylated (β &lt; 0.3) for each probe. We selected the pair of DNA methylation and gene expression probes for which the mean expression in the methylated group was lower than 1.28 standard deviation (bottom 10%) of the mean expression in the unmethylated group, and in which &gt;80% of the samples in the methylated group have expression levels lower than the mean expression in the unmethylated group. We labeled each tumor sample as epigenetically silenced for a specific probe/gene pair if: it belonged to the methylated group and the gene expression level was lower than the mean of the unmethylated group silenced (Cancer Genome Atlas Research, 2014a), resulting in 3,806 probes/genes identified as epigenetically regulated. A Fisher test was used to detect if these 3,806 pairs were enriched in a DNA methylation cluster. For each probe, tumor samples labeled as methylated and downregulated by cluster, while non-tumor samples labeled as unmethylated and upregulated, were counted and arranged into a contingency table for a Fisher test, using 50% as a cutoff. p-value was calculated for each probe/gene pair and then was adjusted for multiple testing using the BH method for false discovery rate estimation (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).

        <p>To generate DNA methylation calls for each sample per gene per overlapping platforms (HM27, HM450), we began by first collapsing multiple CpGs to one representative gene. Using the associated gene expression data (organized as one gene -one expression value per sample), we merged the samples and CpG probes with gene expression data for each platform. We next calculated the spearman correlation (ρ) across all samples for all CpG probes for each gene to one gene expression value. For multiple CpGs for each annotated gene promoter, we selected one CpG probe with the lowest correlation rho value to the associated gene expression profile to capture the most biologically representative event (epigenetic silencing). This effectively reduced the number of CpG probes from N:1 to 1:1.

        <p>De novo Motif discovery was performed using HOMER (script v4.4 (8-25-2014)), an algorithm previously described (Heinz et al., 2010). Briefly, differentially methylated probes were classified according to genomic location into CpG island, CpG shores, and open seas as follow: CpG islands were defined based on UCSC annotation and as per the criteria previously described (Gardiner-Garden and Frommer, 1987;Takai and Jones, 2002). Coverage of CpG island regions was further enhanced by including the 2 kb regions flanking CpG island, referred to here as CpG shores. CpGs isolated in the genome were defined as open seas. Probes mapped to each region were used to performed de novo motif analysis using HOMER (HOMER perl 
            <rs type="software">script</rs> '
            <rs type="software">findMotifsGenome.pl</rs>'). To increase sensitivity of the method, up to two mismatches were allowed in each oligonucleotide sequence and distributions of CpG content in 'target' and 'background' sequences were selectively weighted to equalize the distributions of CpG content in both sets. Raw outputs from HOMER can be found at https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/lgggbm_2015/ .

Lysis buffer was used to lyse frozen tumors by Precellys homogenization. Tumor lysates were adjusted to 1 µg/µL concentration as assessed by bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) and boiled with 1% SDS. Tumor lysates were manually serial diluted in two-fold of 5 dilutions with lysis buffer. An Aushon Biosystems 2470 arrayer (Burlington, MA) printed 1,056 samples on nitrocellulose-coated slides (Grace Bio-Labs). Slides were probed with 196 validated primary antibodies (Cancer Genome Atlas Research, 2015) followed by corresponding secondary antibodies (Goat anti-Rabbit IgG, Goat anti-Mouse IgG or Rabbit anti-Goat IgG). Signal was captured using a DakoCytomation-catalyzed system and DAB colorimetric reaction. Slides were scanned in a CanoScan 9000F. Spot intensities were analyzed and quantified using 
            <rs type="software">Array-Pro Analyzer</rs> (
            <rs type="creator">Media Cybernetics</rs> Washington DC) to generate spot signal intensities (Level 1 data). The software

            <rs type="url">http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/Software/supercurve/</rs>, was used to estimate the EC50 values of the proteins in each dilution series (in log2 scale). Briefly, a fitted curve ("supercurve") was plotted with the signal intensities on the Y-axis and the relative log2 concentration of each protein on the Xaxis using the non-parametric, monotone increasing B-spline model (Tibes et al., 2006). During the process, the raw spot intensity data were adjusted to correct spatial bias before model fitting. A QC metric (Coombes, 2011) was returned for each slide to help determine the quality of the slide: if the score is less than 0.8 on a 0-1 scale, the slide was dropped. In most cases, the staining was repeated to obtain a high quality score. If more than one slide was stained for an antibody, the slide with the highest QC score was used for analysis (Level 2 data). Protein measurements were corrected for loading as described (Coombes, 2011;Gonzalez-Angulo et al., 2011;Hu et al., 2007) using median centering across antibodies (level 3 data). In total, 196 antibodies and 473 samples were used. Final selection of antibodies was also driven by the availability of high quality antibodies that consistently pass a strict validation process as previously described (Hennessy et al., 2010).

        <p>We performed median centering across all the antibodies for each sample to correct for sample loading differences. Those differences arise because protein concentrations are not uniformly distributed per unit volume. That may be due to several factors, such as differences in protein concentrations of large and small cells, differences in the amount of proteins per cell, or heterogeneity of the cells comprising the samples. By observing the expression levels across many different proteins in a sample, we can estimate differences in the total amount of protein in that sample vs. other samples. Subtracting the median protein expression level forces the median value to become zero, allowing us to compare protein expressions across samples.We performed median centering across all the antibodies for each sample to correct for sample loading differences.

        <p>There were additive and multiplicative effects in the data that could not be accounted by biological or sample loading differences. We observed similar effects when we compared the two batches of GBM and LGG tumor protein expression data. A new algorithm, replicates-based normalization (RBN), was therefore developed using replicate samples run across multiple batches to adjust the data for batch effects. The underlying hypothesis is that any observed variation between replicates in different batches is primarily due to linear batch effects plus a component due to random noise.There were additive and multiplicative effects in the data that could not be accounted by biological or sample loading differences.

        <p>Given a sufficiently large number of replicates, the random noise is expected to cancel out (mean=zero by definition). Remaining differences are treated as systematic batch effects. We can compute those effects for each antibody and subtract them out. Many samples were run in both batches. One batch was arbitrarily designated the "anchor" batch and was to remain unchanged. We then computed the means and standard deviations of the common samples in the anchor batch, as well as the other batch. The difference between the means of each antibody in the two batches and the ratio of the standard deviations provided an estimate of the systematic effects between the batches for that antibody (both location-wise and scale-wise). Each data point in the non-anchor batch was adjusted by subtracting the difference in means and multiplying by the inverse ratio of the standard deviations to cancel out those systematic differences. Our normalization procedure significantly reduced technical effects, thereby allowing us to merge the datasets from different batches.Given a sufficiently large number of replicates, the random noise is expected to cancel out (mean=zero by definition).

A total of 473 samples and 196 antibodies were used in the analysis. Two clusters were observed that largely corresponded with tumor type (Figure S3E), however, there were a few notable exceptions. Whereas only one GBM sample clustered with the LGG samples, twenty-six LGG samples were found to cluster with the GBM samples. Seventeen of those twenty-six samples had no mutations in IDH1/2, similar to the GBM samples. Furthermore, compared to the LGG-like cluster, the GBM-like cluster had elevated expression of IGFBP2, fibronectin, PAI1, HSP70, EGFR, phosphoEGFR, phosphoAKT, Cyclin B1, Caveolin, Collagen VI, Annexin1 and ASNS, whereas it had low expression of PKC (alpha, beta and delta), PTEN, BRAF, and phosphoP70S6K.We used consensus clustering to cluster the samples in an unsupervised way, with Pearson correlation as the distance metric and Ward as the linkage algorithm.

Exploring potentially interesting genomic relationships have been of interest to researchers previously [2].

            <rs type="software">Regulome Explorer</rs> web application, which is designed to enable researchers to explore associations among multiple data types in cancer genomics. Prior to loading, a p-value threshold was chosen specific to each pair of data types in such a way as to strike a balance between making potentially interesting associations available to queries by the tool, while still allowing the tool to be responsive, since the number of loaded graph edges (each corresponding to a statistically significant relationship) is in the millions. All identified pairwise relationships, including those described in this manuscript can be found at http://explorer.cancerregulome.org.
