        <p>Background: Numerous publicly available biomedical databases derive data by curating from literatures. The curated data can be useful as training examples for information extraction, but curated data usually lack the exact mentions and their locations in the text required for supervised machine learning. This paper describes a general approach to information extraction using curated data as training examples. The idea is to formulate the problem as cost-sensitive learning from noisy labels, where the cost is estimated by a committee of weak classifiers that consider both curated data and the text. Results: We test the idea on two information extraction tasks of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). The first task is to extract target phenotypes (diseases or traits) of a study and the second is to extract ethnicity backgrounds of study subjects for different stages (initial or replication). Experimental results show that our approach can achieve 87 % of Precision-at-2 (P@2) for disease/trait extraction, and 0.83 of F1-Score for stage-ethnicity extraction, both outperforming their cost-insensitive baseline counterparts.Background: Numerous publicly available biomedical databases derive data by curating from literatures.

        <p>Text mining from the scientific literature has been considered promising for creating and updating structured databases of biomedical knowledge [1] but it often falls short and, currently, manual curation by experts is still the standard practice for this task [2][3][4][5].

        <p>Machine learning has shown its potential in biomedical NLP and text mining [14][15][16][17]. However, supervised statistical learning algorithms require a large number of annotated training examples. Annotation and curation are fundamentally different processes. An annotation is a label applied to a span of text. Hence, an annotation appears verbatim in the source text. Annotated databases are rather labor-intensive albeit ideal for text mining applications. On the other hand, curated databases are prepared by domain experts who use a common terminology to describe entities in text. Curated databases require in-depth domain knowledge to produce but the result often requires post-processing before being useful as training examples.Machine learning has shown its potential in biomedical NLP and text mining [14][15][16][17].

        <p>Numerous biomedical databases are available in the public domain. Many of them contain data derived directly from published literature either by curation by teams of experts or submitted by authors or other scientists. A survey estimated that in 2013, a total of 290 papers on biomedical databases that were published that also provided open URL links to access the data. Among these 290 databases, 77.59 % of them collected data from the literature and contained citations as supportive information [18]. However, these data cannot be readily used as training examples because the curated data rarely provide any information of where and how the data were derived from the text.Numerous biomedical databases are available in the public domain.

        <p>Consider the Catalog of Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) [19,20], an online database developed by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) by a curation team of experts. On a weekly basis, epidemiologists from NHGRI and more recently from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) manually curate study-level fields of information from published GWAS and add them to the catalog. As of May 21, 2015, the Catalog of GWAS has been inserted with approximately 29,000 entries extracted from nearly 2200 distinct articles.Consider the Catalog of Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) [19,20], an online database developed by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) by a curation team of experts.

        <p>Figure 1 (upper panel) shows an example entry in the Catalog of GWAS.

The entry also specifies that the observation was validated with a replication sample, given in Replication Sample Size. Other data fields include information of where the genetic variant resides in the genome and statistical strength of the observation.Figure 1 (upper panel) shows an example entry in the Catalog of GWAS.

        <p>Figure 1 (lower panel) shows the matching result of the entry in the Catalog of GWAS with the actual passages in the text of the article for three data fields. This example illustrates why curated data can be both useful and not useful as training examples. They are useful because matching the data to the text will create training examples. They are not useful because the matching is not trivial. As shown in Fig. 1, matching between the data and text requires background knowledge. In fact, curated data rarely provide verbatim copies of what is mentioned in the source article. For the purposes of easy searching, categorization, summarization, and data integration, curators usually adopt to a standardized terminology different from the text. Also, human curated data inevitably contain typos and inconsistencies in following standards. Even when an exact match with curated data is found, the passage might be about a review of previous results but not the correct location from which the data should be extracted. To sum up, curated data are useful but imperfect as training examples.Figure 1 (lower panel) shows the matching result of the entry in the Catalog of GWAS with the actual passages in the text of the article for three data fields.

        <p>This paper describes a general approach to using curated data from existing biomedical databases as training examples for information extraction from full-text research articles. Our approach is based on results of research in agnostic learning from data with noisy labels [21][22][23][24][25][26][27]. Among the results that fit our need here is importance reweighting [21], where training examples are weighted according to the reliability of their labels, which, however, is unknown in practice and must be estimated. Our solution is to employ a committee of weak classifiers that match candidate passages in the input text with curated data and then apply the EM algorithm to estimate the reliability of the labels. Then we can use a cost-sensitive learning algorithm that learns from training examples weighted by their misclassification costs derived according to the estimated reliability to develop accurate information extractors.This paper describes a general approach to using curated data from existing biomedical databases as training examples for information extraction from full-text research articles.

        <p>The applicability of this approach is not limited to the Catalog of GWAS. A large number of biomedical databases are available in the public domain, and many contain data derived directly from published literature either through manual curation by teams of experts or structured information submitted by authors or researchers. We intend for our approach to be generalizable across these databases as well.The applicability of this approach is not limited to the Catalog of GWAS.

        <p>The problem of learning from imperfect training examples is closely related to entity normalization, where the training examples available are normalized entity names rather than annotations in the text. For example, the gene normalization task in the BioCreative II and III initiative [28][29][30][31][32] aiming at extracting standardized gene IDs mentioned in an input article provided only the standardized gene IDs for each article as the training examples. The problem is also related to learning from data with noisy labels and learning from crowds [23,[33][34][35], where crowd inputs are considered noisy.The problem of learning from imperfect training examples is closely related to entity normalization, where the training examples available are normalized entity names rather than annotations in the text.

        <p>We implement the approach and apply it to two problems of information extraction from the full-text research reports of GWAS. Task 1 is to identify target phenotypes (disease/trait) examined in a GWAS study. This task is different from well-studied disease mention tagging and normalization [36][37][38] in that not all mentions but only the study targets need to be identified and that GWAS targets include not only diseases but a wide range of traits like eye color, response to ximelagatran treatment, sleeping habits, reading and spelling ability, education attainment, political ideology, etc. Usually, a GWAS targets a single phenotype, but a study may examine more than one phenotype. This is often the case when the study target is a complex disease, such as obesity, for which scientists may seek genetic associations with related traits such as body mass index, waist-height ratio, waist circumference, etc., in addition to direct association with obesity.We implement the approach and apply it to two problems of information extraction from the full-text research reports of GWAS.

        <p>Task 2 is to extract stage ("initial" or "replication") and ethnic group of the study samples. A GWAS involves study samples drawn from one or more ethnicity groups. Task 2 is concerned with the problem of extracting these ethnicity groups that the experiment pertains to. There are conventionally two stages in the study: initial and replication, and each of these can be associated with several distinct sample populations. However, many articles may not specified all information clearly in the text. Figure 2 illustrates some examples for this task. The first row gives an ideal case for information extraction, where both stages and their corresponding ethnicity information are specified in a single sentence, though it is still nontrivial to normalize terms in the sentence to a common terminology (i.e., mapping "screening" to "initial" and "France", "Italy", and "Sweden" to "European", the top-level ethnicity group, according to the curation guideline [39]). Figure 2 also contains examples of sentences where an ethnicity mention is not explicitly linked to either stage, or is specified for one stage and must be inferred for the other. This can be exacerbated when these mentions are far apart in a full text.Task 2 is to extract stage ("initial" or "replication") and ethnic group of the study samples.

        <p>Task 1 is an entity recognition problem while Task 2 requires jointly extracting different attribute types and identifying linkage between them. For both tasks we develop information extractors by applying the same general approach to learning from the curated data in the Catalog of GWAS as the training examples. We are able to achieve 87 % of extraction in Precision-at-2 (P@2) for the Task 1 and 0.83 in F1-Score for the Task 2. Both outperform their baseline, cost-insensitive counterparts. The remainder of this paper describes the method and the results in details.Task 1 is an entity recognition problem while Task 2 requires jointly extracting different attribute types and identifying linkage between them.

        <p>Step (B) pairs each passage with a piece of matched curated data and creates a feature vector for the pair as the input to the committee classifiers. For example, we pair passage 2 in Fig. 1 (lower panel) to data item "1683 Indonesian Individuals" from the Catalog of GWAS, because passage 2 is likely from where the data item was derived. Again, the matching should be inclusive to contain all potential pairs.Step (B) pairs each passage with a piece of matched curated data and creates a feature vector for the pair as the input to the committee classifiers.

        <p>Step (C) then sends the feature vectors to a committee of classifiers (diamonds on top of Fig. 3). Each classifier classifies each pair into positive, if the passage is deemed to contain the information given in the curated data, or negative otherwise. The classifiers can be as "weak" as simple decision rules, like "whether the passage contains a substring that exactly matches the curated data". Therefore, each committee member classifier provides noisy positive-negative labels of the passages extracted from the text. Combining the classification results of all committee members for all extracted passages creates a a large matrix Fig. 3 System architecture. Our proposed system architecture summarizing the steps (a-e) in the machine learning training process of yes-or-no votes, where each element (i, j) contains the vote from classifier i for candidate passage j.Step (C) then sends the feature vectors to a committee of classifiers (diamonds on top of Fig. 3).

        <p>With the estimated probability of each candidate passage, we can assign it a cost, and train a cost-sensitive learner [40][41][42] using the candidate passages as the costweighted training examples to learn to select correct passages that contain the desired information as Step (E). The cost that we use here is derived according to Lemma 1 in [21], where the problem of classification with noisy labels is solved by importance reweighting. They show that an error bound can be achieved if the misclassification cost of a training example (x, y) is set to p(y|x)/p ρ (y|x), where ρ denotes sampling from a noise-perturbed distribution. Though neither p(y|x) nor p ρ (y|x) are known, we can approximate p(y ="+"|x) by p from the EM algorithm above and p ρ (y ="+"|x) by p(p(y ="+"|x) &gt; 0.5) for a training example estimated as positive and analogously for a negative one. That is, let y i = round( pi ). If y i = 1 then the cost of misclassifying the i-th passage as negative is c i = pi i y i /I , else c i = pi 1-i y i /I . We note that this cost-sensitive classifier may use a completely different set of features to characterize a passage.With the estimated probability of each candidate passage, we can assign it a cost, and train a cost-sensitive learner [40][41][42] using the candidate passages as the costweighted training examples to learn to select correct passages that contain the desired information as Step (E).

        <p>The curated GWAS target phenotype data are in the form of a spreadsheet dated May 2014 available for download at [43]. Each row in the spreadsheet contains a column DISEASETRAIT, reporting a phenotype term chosen by curators as the study target of the paper with its ID given in column PUBMEDID. As we discuss earlier, these phenotype terms do not always exactly match what is mentioned in the text. Column EFOTRAIT contains the phenotype term mapped to a concept defined in Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) [44], the standard terminology of diseases and traits for the Catalog of GWAS. EFO classifies concepts into 17 high-level categories as given in column PARENT. For example, DISEASETRAIT for the paper of PubMed ID 18849991 is "Male-pattern baldness". The corresponding EFOTRAIT and PARENT are "androgenetic alopecia" and "Other disease", respectively.

        <p>• Title or Abstract: Whether disease/trait mention occurs in the title or abstract of the paper; this is a simple yet strong indicator of a disease mentioned being the actual target of the paper. • Exact match : Whether disease/trait mention exactly matches the target given by human curator. • Sub-string match : Whether disease/trait mention partially matches the target given by the human curator (e.g., a mention of "Diabetes" would be classified as positive, if the human curator determines the disease as "Type-2 Diabetes"). • Synonym: Whether disease/trait mention is an exact or partial match of a synonym of the target determined by the human curator. The synonyms are collected from UMLS [49]; for a given disease or trait mention, all UMLS concepts that shared the same CONCEPT-ID are considered to be synonymous. To reduce noise, we only keep the synonyms which are in English and are preferred terms (i.e., the IS-PREF flag set to Y in UMLS). • Compound token: Whether the mention has multiple tokens separated by a space or hyphen (e.g., "Parkinson's disease" would be classified as positive because it consists of compound tokens separated by a space).• Title or Abstract: Whether disease/trait mention occurs in the title or abstract of the paper; this is a simple yet strong indicator of a disease mentioned being the actual target of the paper. • Exact match : Whether disease/trait mention exactly matches the target given by human curator. • Sub-string match : Whether disease/trait mention partially matches the target given by the human curator (e.g., a mention of "Diabetes" would be classified as positive, if the human curator determines the disease as "Type-2 Diabetes"). • Synonym: Whether disease/trait mention is an exact or partial match of a synonym of the target determined by the human curator.

However, our cost-sensitive classifier may predict only part of them to be positive. This is reasonable because even though two sentences mention the same phenotype, it is not always the case that both are stating that the phenotype is the study target.

        <p>We construct the dictionary of ethnicity mappings as follows. A multitude of terms can refer to the ethnicity of an individual, including the country of origin (e.g., "Germany"), the specific ethnicity group (e.g., "European"), an adjectival for the country (e.g., "German"), a demonym for the country (e.g., "Germans"), and similar sets of terms for cities and other regions.

These countries are then mapped to the corresponding ethnicity group (or discarded if no mapping exists).• Country/region name: Not every mention of a region, say, a country, maps to a specific ethnicity term.

        <p>• Token-based features: A set of binary features each of which turn on for a specific ethnicity entity (e.g., a feature will be 1 for "East Asian"). • Context-based features: These include normalized term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) representations of unigrams and bigrams of 10 words in either direction of the ethnicity mention, as long as the words are within the same sentence. The words are stemmed using the Porter 
            <rs type="software">stemmer</rs> [51]. • Position-based features: These include features like section title (also in TF-IDF form), the distance (normalized) of the ethnicity mention from the start of the article, or from the start of the section. • Additional features: These include features that do not fit into the above categories, such as the number of times the ethnicity entity was observed (tagged) in the same article.

        <p>This results in sparse feature vectors of approximately 80,000 dimensions. The features are normalized by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance across the values of each feature, or dimension of feature vector. As the feature set is mostly composed of various TF-IDF vectors, truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), or Latent Semantic Analysis, was explored as a feature selection technique to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors. However, this did not affect the performance significantly (and in fact degraded performance slightly) and hence the complete feature vectors were retained.

        <p>The results from each fold are then collected to obtain stage, ethnicity tuples for all the articles in the dataset. These results are compared against the curated data and the F1 score calculated in the standard way:The results from each fold are then collected to obtain stage, ethnicity tuples for all the articles in the dataset. These results are compared against the curated data and the F1 score calculated in the standard way:</p>
        <p>• If a stage, ethnicity tuple in the result for a specific article is present in curated data for that article, it is considered a true positive (TP); otherwise, it is considered a false positive (FP). • If a stage, ethnicity tuple in the curated data for a specific article does not have a counterpart in the extracted results, it is considered a false negative (FN).• If a stage, ethnicity tuple in the result for a specific article is present in curated data for that article, it is considered a true positive (TP); otherwise, it is considered a false positive (FP). • If a stage, ethnicity tuple in the curated data for a specific article does not have a counterpart in the extracted results, it is considered a false negative (FN).</p>
        <p>Using this, we calculate the precision, recall and the Macro F1 score for each method on 1,311 articles comprising 2,357 stage, ethnicity tuples from approximately 35,000 mentions of ethnicity-related terms.Using this, we calculate the precision, recall and the Macro F1 score for each method on 1,311 articles comprising 2,357 stage, ethnicity tuples from approximately 35,000 mentions of ethnicity-related terms.</p>
        <p>The resultant values are tabulated in Table 2. Table 3 presents the macro precision, recall and the F1 score for the methods. The precision and recall are calculated as above, but for each article individually, and then averaged to obtain the macro precision and recall. The 2 and3 indicate that the costsensitive approach is able to significantly outperform the similar but cost-insensitive approach, which performs only close to a brute-force baseline. Not only is the costsensitive approach able to achieve a much higher degree of recall, but the improvement is accompanied by an increase in overall precision as well.The resultant values are tabulated in Table 2.

        <p>As the recall gets closer to the limit, the results also indicate that further improvements to the method will be gained by focusing not on extracting relevant ethnicity groups, but on eliminating the ones that are irrelevant to the article.As the recall gets closer to the limit, the results also indicate that further improvements to the method will be gained by focusing not on extracting relevant ethnicity groups, but on eliminating the ones that are irrelevant to the article.</p>
        <p>The results show that a cost-sensitive committee learning approach reliably outperforms a similar, cost-insensitive approach. This holds true even when the additional committee members are weak classifiers that encode realworld domain knowledge and patterns as rules, which can compensate to some extent for the lack of data, as it is not presumable that all patterns are present in the data in significant quantity as to be learned by a model. Some of the challenges faced in the task of extracting ethnicity groups of sample populations from the Catalog of GWAS are described below.The results show that a cost-sensitive committee learning approach reliably outperforms a similar, cost-insensitive approach.

        <p>• Entity normalization: There are various ways of representing the same entity, and it is necessary to normalize these representations to a single representative entity. However, there exist degrees of difficulty with respect to normalization; for example, it is relatively easy to equate "African American" to "African-American", but much harder to equate the two represntations with "American citizen of African origin". • Studies with several target entities to extract: Many GWAS in the U.S. use a highly ethnically diversified study sample with, for example, "52 % Caucasian, 24 % Latino, 11 % African, 9 % Eastern Asian and 4 % Indigenous Americans", and studies may also divide into more than two stages. How to flexibly identify and deal with these situations is challenging. • Varying concept granularity: Mentions of ethnicity terms might not be correctly tagged in an article as the authors may report ethnicities in specific terms such as names of tribes and indigenous people, etc., which may not map perfectly to a top-level ethnicity group. This introduces ambiguity which can be an issue for ethnicity background identification. • Inadequate reporting of ethnicity data: Often, the importance of a study to a specific population or application only becomes apparent after the article is published. Hence, the text in the article may never refer to the specific ethnicity group that their experimental sample was drawn from, but simply describe it in terms of the city, state or region, or even the hospital that the population was recruited at. This is doubly challenging as it requires an indefinite expansion of the dictionary of ethnicity-related terms, and also a standardized mapping from each such term to a top-level ethnicity group.• Entity normalization: There are various ways of representing the same entity, and it is necessary to normalize these representations to a single representative entity.

        <p>The large number of curated biomedical databases available in the public domain provides an unprecedented opportunity to train NLP systems to comprehend biomedical publications. In this paper, we present an approach to take advantage of this opportunity. The approach applied methods from learning from noisy-label and committee classifiers to assign costs to train cost-sensitive classifiers. We tested our approach for two challenging biomedical information extraction tasks. The results show that our approach is effective and outperforms alternative approaches. We will continue to investigate if it is possible to define standard passage extractors and weak learners applicable to extract biomedical entities, attributes and relations of common interest to enable rapid development and portability between domains for biomedical literature mining.The large number of curated biomedical databases available in the public domain provides an unprecedented opportunity to train NLP systems to comprehend biomedical publications.
