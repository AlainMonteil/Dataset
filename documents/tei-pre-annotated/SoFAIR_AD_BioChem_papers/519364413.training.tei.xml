        <p>The primary outcome was the composite of an episode of worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death. This outcome was analyzed by baseline diabetes status and, in patients without diabetes, by glycated hemoglobin level less than 5.7% vs greater than or equal to 5.7%. RESULTS Among 4744 patients randomized (mean age, 66 years; 1109 [23%] women; 2605 [55%] without diabetes), 4742 completed the trial.

        <p>nhibitors of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), initially developed as a treatment for individuals with type 2 diabetes, prevent reabsorption of filtered glucose and lower blood glucose levels by increasing urinary excretion. [1][2][3] In trials of participants with type 2 diabetes, these drugs led to a reduction in incident heart failure, which occurred early after randomization and appeared to be independent of baseline and time-dependent changes in glycated hemoglobin, suggesting this benefit may not necessarily be due to glucose lowering and might also be found in individuals without diabetes. [4][5][6][7][8] In parallel, experimental evidence emerged suggesting that SGLT2 inhibitors may have cardioprotective actions independent of blood glucose level. [9][10][11] The Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure (DAPA-HF) trial included patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction with and without type 2 diabetes. Dapagliflozin reduced the risk of worsening heart failure events and cardiovascular death and improved symptoms. 12,13 The key question arising from the DAPA-HF trial is how the effects of dapagliflozin compared in patients with and without diabetes, and whether the findings of this trial support the hypothesis that SGLT2 inhibition might be an effective treatment for patients with heart failure, including those without diabetes. In this exploratory analysis, the efficacy of dapagliflozin, along with metabolic and hemodynamic changes and adverse events, were analyzed in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with and without diabetes and across the range of baseline glycated hemoglobin levels in DAPA-HF.nhibitors of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), initially developed as a treatment for individuals with type 2 diabetes, prevent reabsorption of filtered glucose and lower blood glucose levels by increasing urinary excretion.

        <p>Investigators recorded whether patients had a history of diabetes at the enrollment visit (visit 1). Patients also underwent measurement of their glycated hemoglobin level in a central laboratory at visit 1 and again at the randomization visit (visit 2), which occurred 14 (±7) days later. For this prespecified subgroup analysis, patients were categorized as having diabetes if they had a history of diabetes or their glycated hemoglobin was at least 6.5% (≥48 mmol/mol) at visits 1 and 2. Patients with a glycated hemoglobin level less than 5.7% (&lt;39 mmol/mL) at visits 1 and 2 were considered to have a normal glycated hemoglobin.

        <p>The primary outcome for the trial was the composite of a first episode of worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death. An episode of worsening heart failure was defined as an unplanned hospital admission because of worsening heart failure or an urgent hospital visit requiring treatment for worsening heart failure with intravenous therapy. 16 The first of the secondary outcomes was the composite of hospital admission for worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death. The additional secondary outcomes were the total number of hospital admissions for heart failure (including repeat admissions) and cardiovascular deaths; change from baseline to 8 months in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) total symptom score (range, 0-100; higher scores indicate fewer symptoms; ≥5-point change considered clinically meaningful) 17 ; the incidence of a composite worsening kidney function outcome, consisting of a 50% or greater sustained (ie, ≥28 days) decline in eGFR, kidney failure (defined as a sustained [ie, ≥28 days] eGFR &lt;15 mL/min/1.73m 2 , sustained dialysis treatment, or kidney transplant) or kidney-related death; and death from any cause. 12,13 The clinical outcomes described were adjudicated by a blinded end point committee. 16 Diabetes status at baseline was one of the prespecified exploratory analysis subgroups. The SAP stated that the primary outcome, the cardiovascular death component of this composite, and the first secondary outcome would be analyzed in the prespecified subgroups (Supplement 2).

Furthermore, among the individuals without diabetes, the reduction in the primary outcome with dapagliflozin was consistent in those with a glycated hemoglobin greater than or equal to 5.7% and less than 5.7% (ie, in those with prediabetes and those with a normal glycated hemoglobin). 20,21 These data provide evidence that the benefits of SGLT2 inhibition are not limited to people with diabetes or prediabetes and are applicable to patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, irrespective of glycemic status. Dapagliflozin reduced glycated hemoglobin in patients with type 2 diabetes but had no effect on this measure in patients without diabetes. However, the effects of dapagliflozin on weight, blood pressure, hematocrit, eGFR, and NT-proBNP were directionally similar in those with and without diabetes, although significantly more pronounced in the former group for hematocrit.The key finding from these exploratory analyses of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction was that the effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on the primary and principal secondary outcome did not differ in individuals with and without diabetes.

Other diuresis-independent actions, including effects on ion transporters, fibrosis, adipokines, sympathetic nervous system activity, and vascular function, have also been proposed, although clinical evidence supporting these is sparse. 3,10,30,31 SGLT2 inhibitors may reduce left ventricular mass and an effect on cardiac remodeling could explain the decrease in NT-proBNP observed with dapagliflozin. 3,9,10,32 Prevention of decline in kidney function is also likely to be beneficial in heart failure.</p>
        <p>The rate of adverse events related to volume depletion was low and not significantly different between participants with and without diabetes. Other prespecified adverse events were infrequent in both groups of patients, and discontinuation of study drug was also uncommon in the 2 groups. Neither major hypoglycemia nor diabetic ketoacidosis occurred in any patient without diabetes. Although there was no statistically significant effect on the prespecified kidney outcome, this occurred in few patients treated with dapagliflozin. However, doubling of serum creatinine (a prespecified exploratory outcome) was less common in patients who received dapagliflozin, both in patients with and without diabetes.The rate of adverse events related to volume depletion was low and not significantly different between participants with and without diabetes.

        <p>This study has several limitations. First, although this analysis was prespecified, the results reported in this study are based on subgroup analysis. Second, some analyses were post hoc, including those that evaluated outcomes according to glycated hemoglobin levels by tertiles in patients without diabetes and as a continuous variable in all patients and those that evaluated changes in hematocrit levels. Third, additional information that might have helped explain the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in heart failure was not collected. Fourth, the diagnosis of previously unknown diabetes was based on 2 consecutively elevated glycated hemoglobin levels (≥6.5%), and an alternative diagnostic approach (eg, an oral glucose tolerance test and fasting plasma glucose measurement) might have recategorized some patients. 18,19 Fifth, to fit with the scheduled assessments in the trial, "prediabetes" was pragmatically defined as 1 glycated hemoglobin level measurement of at least 5.7% at visit 1 or visit 2 (ie, not having 2 consecutively normal levels [&lt;5.7%] or having known or previously undiagnosed diabetes).This study has several limitations.

        <p>In this exploratory analysis of a randomized clinical trial of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, dapagliflozin compared with placebo, when added to recommended therapy, significantly reduced the risk of worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death independently of diabetes status.In this exploratory analysis of a randomized clinical trial of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, dapagliflozin compared with placebo, when added to recommended therapy, significantly reduced the risk of worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death independently of diabetes status.</p>
