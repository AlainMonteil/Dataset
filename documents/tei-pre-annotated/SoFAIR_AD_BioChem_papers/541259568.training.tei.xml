        <p>The Concise Guide to PHARMACOLOGY 2021/22 is the fifth in this series of biennial publications. The Concise Guide provides concise overviews, mostly in tabular format, of the key properties of nearly 1900 human drug targets with an emphasis on selective pharmacology (where available), plus links to the open access knowledgebase source of drug targets and their ligands (www.guidetopharmacology.org), which provides more detailed views of target and ligand properties. Although the Concise Guide constitutes over 500 pages, the material presented is substantially reduced compared to information and links presented on the website. It provides a permanent, citable, point-in-time record that will survive database updates. The full contents of this section can be found at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/ doi/bph.15538. G protein-coupled receptors are one of the six major pharmacological targets into which the Guide is divided, with the others being: ion channels, nuclear hormone receptors, catalytic receptors, enzymes and transporters. These are presented with nomenclature guidance and summary information on the best available pharmacological tools, alongside key references and suggestions for further reading. The landscape format of the Concise Guide is designed to facilitate comparison of related targets from material contemporary to mid-2021, and supersedes data presented in the 2019/20, 2017/18, 2015/16 and 2013/14 Concise Guides and previous Guides to Receptors and Channels. It is produced in close conjunction with the Nomenclature and Standards Committee of the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (NC-IUPHAR), therefore, providing official IUPHAR classification and nomenclature for human drug targets, where appropriate.The Concise Guide to PHARMACOLOGY 2021/22 is the fifth in this series of biennial publications.

        <p>Overview: This receptor family comprises a group of receptors for the calcitonin/CGRP family of peptides. The calcitonin (CT), amylin (AMY), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and adrenomedullin (AM) receptors (nomenclature as agreed by the NC-IUPHAR Subcommittee on CGRP, AM, AMY, and CT receptors [891,893,1901]) are generated by the genes CALCR (which codes for the CT receptor) and CALCRL (which codes for the calcitonin receptor-like receptor, CLR, previously known as CRLR). Their function and pharmacology are altered in the presence of RAMPs (receptor activity-modifying proteins), which are single TM domain proteins of ca. 150 amino acids, identified as a family of three members; RAMP1, RAMP2 and RAMP3. There are splice variants of the CT receptor; these in turn produce variants of the AMY receptor [1901], some of which can be potently activated by CGRP. The endogenous agonists are the peptides calcitonin (CALCA, P01258), α-CGRP (CALCA, P06881) (formerly known as CGRP-I), β-CGRP (CALCB, P10092) (formerly known as CGRP-II), amylin (IAPP, P10997) (occasionally called islet-amyloid polypeptide, diabetes-associated polypeptide), adrenomedullin (ADM, P35318) and adrenomedullin 2/intermedin (ADM2, Q7Z4H4). There are species differences in peptide sequences, particularly for the CTs. CTR-stimulating peptide {Pig} (CRSP) is another member of the family with selectivity for the CT receptor but it is not expressed in humans [1125]. CLR (calcitonin receptor-like receptor) by itself binds no known endogenous ligand, but in the presence of RAMPs it gives receptors for CGRP, adrenomedullin and adrenomedullin 2/intermedin. There are several approved drugs that target this receptor family, such as pramlintide, erenumab, and the "gepant" class of CGRP receptor antagonists.Overview: This receptor family comprises a group of receptors for the calcitonin/CGRP family of peptides.

        <p>The calcium-sensing receptor (CaS, provisional nomenclature as recommended by NC-IUPHAR [652] and subsequently updated [1323]) responds to multiple endogenous ligands, including extracellular calcium and other divalent/trivalent cations, polyamines and polycationic peptides, L-amino acids (particularly L-Trp and L-Phe), glutathione and various peptide analogues, ionic strength and extracellular pH (reviewed in [1325]). While divalent/trivalent cations, polyamines and polycations are CaS receptor agonists [269,1927], L-amino acids, glutamyl peptides, ionic strength and pH are allosteric modulators of agonist function [438,652,950,1925,1926]. Indeed, L-amino acids have been identified as "co-agonists", with both concomitant calcium and L-amino acid binding required for full receptor activation [730,2657].

Additional hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic roles have been identified for many chemokines in the areas of embryonic development, immune cell proliferation, activation and death, viral infection, and as antibiotics, among others. Chemokine receptors can be divided by function into two main groups: G protein-coupled chemokine receptors, which mediate leukocyte trafficking, and "Atypical chemokine receptors", which may signal through non-G protein-coupled mechanisms and act as chemokine scavengers to downregulate inflammation or shape chemokine gradients [97].Kennedy AJ et al.

        <p>Chemokines in turn can be divided by structure into four subclasses by the number and arrangement of conserved cysteines. CC (also known as β-chemokines; n= 28), CXC (also known as α-chemokines; n= 17) and CX3C (n= 1) chemokines all have four conserved cysteines, with zero, one and three amino acids separating the first two cysteines respectively. C chemokines (n= 2) have only the second and fourth cysteines found in other chemokines. Chemokines can also be classified by function into homeostatic and inflammatory subgroups. Most chemokine receptors are able to bind multiple high-affinity chemokine ligands, but the ligands for a given receptor are almost always restricted to the same structural subclass. Most chemokines bind to more than one receptor subtype. Receptors for inflammatory chemokines are typically highly promiscuous with regard to ligand specificity, and may lack a selective endogenous ligand. G protein-coupled chemokine receptors are named acccording to the class of chemokines bound, whereas ACKR is the root acronym for atypical chemokine receptors [98]. There can be substantial cross-species differences in the sequences of both chemokines and chemokine receptors, and in the pharmacology and biology of chemokine receptors. Endogenous and microbial non-chemokine ligands have also been identified for chemokine receptors. Many chemokine receptors function as HIV co-receptors, but CCR5 is the only one demonstrated to play an essential role in HIV/AIDS pathogenesis. The tables include both standard chemokine receptor names [2691] and aliases. [372], as well as for β-catenin-dependent [279] and -independent [280,1168] signalling. The pattern of cell signalling is complicated by the presence of additional ligands, which can enhance or inhibit FZD signalling (secreted Frizzled-related proteins (sFRP), Wnt-inhibitory factor (WIF1, Q9Y5W5) (WIF), sclerostin (SOST, Q9BQB4) or Dickkopf (DKK)), as well as modulatory (co)-receptors with Ryk, ROR1, ROR2 and Kremen, which may also function as independent signalling proteins.Chemokines in turn can be divided by structure into four subclasses by the number and arrangement of conserved cysteines.

Many chemokine receptors function as HIV co-receptors, but CCR5 is the only one demonstrated to play an essential role in HIV/AIDS pathogenesis. The tables include both standard chemokine receptor names [2691] and aliases. [372], as well as for β-catenin-dependent [279] and -independent [280,1168] signalling. The pattern of cell signalling is complicated by the presence of additional ligands, which can enhance or inhibit FZD signalling (secreted Frizzled-related proteins (sFRP), Wnt-inhibitory factor (WIF1, Q9Y5W5) (WIF), sclerostin (SOST, Q9BQB4) or Dickkopf (DKK)), as well as modulatory (co)-receptors with Ryk, ROR1, ROR2 and Kremen, which may also function as independent signalling proteins.</p>

There is also a scarcity of information on basic pharmacological characteristics of FZDs, such as binding constants, ligand specificity or concentration-response relationships [1162]. However, progress in understanding WNT-FZD interactions has been initiated with generation of eGFP-tagged WNT-3A [2292,2527]. Development of pharmacological tools [1241] for SMO has been faciliated by successful determination of several SMO structures [296,520,994,1920,1921,2480,2481,2511,2671].

The crystal structure for agonist bound FFA1 has been described [2227]. [229,1875]) are formed from the heterodimerization of two similar 7TM subunits termed GABA B1 and GABA B2 [229,596,1874,1875,2396]. GABA B receptors are widespread in the CNS and regulate both pre-and postsynaptic activity. The GABA B1 subunit, when expressed alone, binds both antagonists and agonists, but the affinity of the latter is generally 10-100-fold less than for the native receptor. Co-expression of GABA B1 and GABA B2 subunits allows transport of GABA B1 to the cell surface and generates a functional receptor that can couple to signal transduction pathways such as high-voltage-activated Ca 2+ channels (Ca v 2.1, Ca v 2.2), or inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir3) [171,229,230]. The GABA B1 subunit harbours the GABA (orthosteric)-binding site within an extracellular domain (ECD) venus flytrap module (VTM), whereas the GABA B2 subunit mediates G protein-coupled signalling [229,729,731,1874]. The cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human full-length GABA B1 -GABA B2 heterodimer have been solved in the inactive apo state, two intermediate agonist-bound forms and an active state in which the heterodimer is bound to an agonist and a positive allosteric modulator [2141]. The positive allosteric modulator binds to the transmembrane dimerization interface and stabilizes the active state. Recent evidence indicates that higher order assemblies of GABA B receptor comprising dimers of heterodimers occur in recombinant expression systems and in vivo and that such complexes exhibit negative functional cooperativity between heterodimers [435,1872]. Adding further complexity, KCTD (potassium channel tetramerization proteins) 8, 12, 12b and 16 associate as tetramers with the carboxy terminus of the GABA B2 subunit to impart altered signalling kinetics and agonist potency to the receptor complex [127,2104,2383] and are reviewed by [1876]. The molecular complexity of GABA B receptors is further increased through association with trafficking and effector proteins [2105] and reviewed by [1871]. The predominant GABA B1a and GABA B1b isoforms, which are most prevalent in neonatal and adult brain tissue respectively, differ in their ECD sequences as a result of the use of alternative transcription initiation sites. GABA B1a -containing heterodimers localise to distal axons and mediate inhibition of glutamate release in the CA3-CA1 terminals, and GABA release onto the layer 5 pyramidal neurons, whereas GABA B1b -containing receptors occur within dendritic spines and mediate slow postsynaptic inhibition [1849,2442]. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and soluble APP (sAPP) bind to the N-terminal sushi domain of the GABA B1a isoform to regulate axonal trafficking of GABA B receptors and release of neurotransmitters [1982]. ρ1 receptors, with potencies in the low micromolar range [677].G protein-coupled receptors → Free fatty acid receptors Overview: Free fatty acid receptors (FFA, nomenclature as agreed by the NC-IUPHAR Subcommittee on free fatty acid receptors [485,2243]) are activated by free fatty acids.

GABA B1a -containing heterodimers localise to distal axons and mediate inhibition of glutamate release in the CA3-CA1 terminals, and GABA release onto the layer 5 pyramidal neurons, whereas GABA B1b -containing receptors occur within dendritic spines and mediate slow postsynaptic inhibition [1849,2442]. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and soluble APP (sAPP) bind to the N-terminal sushi domain of the GABA B1a isoform to regulate axonal trafficking of GABA B receptors and release of neurotransmitters [1982]. ρ1 receptors, with potencies in the low micromolar range [677].</p>

        <p>Overview: Galanin receptors (provisional nomenclature as recommended by NC-IUPHAR [652]) are activated by the endogenous peptides galanin (GAL, P22466) and galanin-like peptide (GALP, Q9UBC7). Human galanin (GAL, P22466) is a 30 amino-acid non-amidated peptide [618]; in other species, it is 29 amino acids long and C-terminally amidated. Amino acids 1-14 of galanin are highly conserved in mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibia and fish. Shorter peptide species (e.g. human galanin-1-19 [167] and porcine galanin-5-29 [2170]) and N-terminally extended forms (e.g. N-terminally seven and nine residue elongated forms of porcine galanin [168,2170]) have been reported. More recently, the newly-identified peptide, spexin (SPX), has been reported to activate human GAL2 and GAL3 (but not GAL1) receptors in heterologous expression systems; and to alter GAL2/3 receptor-related behaviours in animals [1167]. Additional galanin receptor subtypes are also suggested from studies with chimeric peptides (e.g. M15, M35 and M40), which act as antagonists in functional assays in the cardiovascular system [2394], spinal cord [2542], locus coeruleus, hippocampus [125] and hypothalamus [126,1349], but exhibit agonist activity at some peripheral sites [126,813].

        <p>Overview: The ghrelin receptor (nomenclature as agreed by the NC-IUPHAR Subcommittee for the Ghrelin receptor [486]) is activated by a 28 amino-acid peptide originally isolated from rat stomach, where it is cleaved from a 117 amino-acid precursor (GHRL, Q9UBU3). The human gene encoding the precursor peptide has 83% sequence homology to rat prepro-ghrelin, although the mature peptides from rat and human differ by only two amino acids [1528]. Alternative splicing results in the formation of a second peptide, [des-Gln 14 ]ghrelin (GHRL, Q9UBU3) with equipotent biological activity [974]. A unique post-translational modification (octanoylation of Ser 3 , catalysed by ghrelin O-acyltransferase (MBOAT4, Q96T53) [2613] occurs in both peptides, essential for full activity in binding to ghrelin receptors in the hypothalamus and pituitary, and for the release of growth hormone from the pituitary [1220]. Structure activity studies showed the first five N-terminal amino acids to be the minimum required for binding [142], and receptor mutagenesis has indicated overlap of the ghrelin binding site with those for small molecule agonists and allosteric modulators of ghrelin (GHRL, Q9UBU3) function [964].Overview: The ghrelin receptor (nomenclature as agreed by the NC-IUPHAR Subcommittee for the Ghrelin receptor [486]) is activated by a 28 amino-acid peptide originally isolated from rat stomach, where it is cleaved from a 117 amino-acid precursor (GHRL, Q9UBU3).

        <p>G protein-coupled receptors → Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone receptors Overview: GnRH 1 and GnRH 2 receptors (provisonal nomenclature [652], also called Type I and Type II GnRH receptor, respectively [1589]) have been cloned from numerous species, most of which express two or three types of GnRH receptor [1588,1589,2172]. GnRH I (GNRH1, P01148) (p-Glu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro-Gly-NH2) is a hypothalamic decapeptide also known as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, gonadoliberin, luliberin, gonadorelin or simply as GnRH. It is a member of a family of similar peptides found in many species [1588,1589,2172] including GnRH II (GNRH2, O43555) (pGlu-His-Trp-Ser-His-Gly-Trp-Tyr-Pro-Gly-NH 2 (which is also known as chicken GnRH-II). Receptors for three forms of GnRH exist in some species but only GnRH I and GnRH II and their cognate receptors have been found in mammals [1588,1589,2172]. GnRH 1 receptors are expressed by pituitary gonadotrophs, where they mediate the effects of GnRH on gonadotropin hormone synthesis and secretion that underpin central control of mammalian reproduction. GnRH analogues are used in assisted reproduction and to treat steroid hormone-dependent conditions [1160]. Notably, agonists cause desensitization of GnRH-stimulated gonadotropin secretion and the consequent reduction in circulating sex steroids is exploited to treat hormone-dependent cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate [1160]. GnRH 1 receptors are selectively activated by GnRH I and all lack the COOH-terminal tails found in other GPCRs. GnRH 2 receptors do have COOH-terminal tails and (where tested) are selective for GnRH II over GnRH I. GnRH 2 receptors are expressed by some primates but not by humans [1639]. Phylogenetic classifications divide GnRH receptors into three [1589] or five groups [2546] and highlight examples of gene loss through evolution, with humans retaining only one ancient gene.

        <p>Desaulniers AT et al. (2017) [807] but coupling to G s and G i is evident in some systems [1252,1273]. GnRH 2 receptors may also mediate (heterotrimeric) G protein-independent signalling to protein kinases [331]. There is increasing evidence for expression of GnRH receptors on hormone-dependent cancer cells where they can exert antiproliferative and/or proapoptotic effects and mediate effects of cytotoxins conjugated to GnRH analogues [377,873,1395,2078]. In some human cancer cell models GnRH II (GNRH2, O43555) is more potent than GnRH I (GNRH1, P01148), implying mediation by GnRH 2 receptors [810], but GnRH 2 receptors are not expressed by humans because the human GNRHR2 gene contains a frame shift and internal stop codon [1639]. The possibility remains that this gene generates GnRH 2 receptor-related proteins (other than the full-length receptor) that mediate responses to GnRH II (GNRH2, O43555) (see [1708]). Alternatively, evidence for multiple active GnRH receptor conformations [331,332,638,1536,1589] raises the possibility that GnRH 1 receptor-mediated proliferation inhibition in hormone-dependent cancer cells is dependent upon a conformation that couples to G i rather than G q/11 proteins as in pituitary cells [332,1536]. Loss-of-function mutations in the GnRH 1 receptor and deficiency of GnRH I (GNRH1, P01148) are associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism although some 'loss of function' mutations may actually prevent trafficking of 'functional' GnRH 1 receptors to the cell surface, as evidenced by recovery of function by nonpeptide antagonists [1327]. Human GnRH 1 receptors are poorly expressed at the cell surface because of failure to meet structural quality control criteria for endoplasmic reticulum exit [639,1327], and this increases susceptibility to point mutations that further impair trafficking [639,1327].

        <p>G protein-coupled receptors → Leukotriene receptors Overview: The leukotriene receptors (nomenclature as agreed by the NC-IUPHAR subcommittee on Leukotriene Receptors [99, 100]) are activated by the endogenous ligands leukotrienes (LT), synthesized from lipoxygenase metabolism of arachidonic acid. The human BLT 1 receptor is the high affinity LTB 4 receptor whereas the BLT 2 receptor in to being a low-affinity LTB 4 receptor also binds several other lipoxygenase-products, such as 12S-HETE, 12S-HPETE, 15S-HETE, and the thromboxane synthase product 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid. The BLT receptors mediate chemotaxis and immunomodulation in several leukocyte populations and are in addition expressed on non-myeloid cells, such as vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells. In addition to BLT receptors, LTB 4 has been reported to bind to the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) α [1400] and the vanilloid TRPV1 ligand-gated nonselective cation channel [1550]. The receptors for the cysteinyl-leukotrienes (i.e. LTC 4 , LTD 4 and LTE 4 ) are termed CysLT 1 and CysLT 2 and exhibit distinct expression patterns in human tissues, mediating for example smooth muscle cell contraction, regulation of vascular permeability, and leukocyte activation. There is also evidence in the literature for additional CysLT receptor subtypes, derived from functional in vitro studies, radioligand binding and in mice lacking both CysLT 1 and CysLT 2 receptors [100]. Cysteinyl-leukotrienes have also been suggested to signal through the P2Y 12 receptor [668,1749,1818], GPR17 [419] and GPR99 [1113].

The human BLT 1 receptor is the high affinity LTB 4 receptor whereas the BLT 2 receptor in to being a low-affinity LTB 4 receptor also binds several other lipoxygenase-products, such as 12S-HETE, 12S-HPETE, 15S-HETE, and the thromboxane synthase product 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid. The BLT receptors mediate chemotaxis and immunomodulation in several leukocyte populations and are in addition expressed on non-myeloid cells, such as vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells. In addition to BLT receptors, LTB 4 has been reported to bind to the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) α [1400] and the vanilloid TRPV1 ligand-gated nonselective cation channel [1550]. The receptors for the cysteinyl-leukotrienes (i.e. LTC 4 , LTD 4 and LTE 4 ) are termed CysLT 1 and CysLT 2 and exhibit distinct expression patterns in human tissues, mediating for example smooth muscle cell contraction, regulation of vascular permeability, and leukocyte activation.

The crystal structure of LPA1 is solved and indicates that LPA accesses the extracellular binding pocket, consistent with its proposed delivery via autotaxin [402]. These studies have also implicated cross-talk with endocannabinoids via phosphorylated intermediates that can also activate these receptors. The binding affinities to LPA 1 of unlabeled, natural LPA and anandamide phosphate (AEAp) were measured using backscattering interferometry (pK d = 9) [1604,1956]. Utilization of this method indicated affinities that were 77-fold lower than when measured using radioactivity-based protocols [2609]. Targeted deletion of LPA receptors has clarified signalling pathways and identified physiological and pathophysiological roles. Multiple groups have independently published validation of all six LPA receptors described in these tables, and further validation was achieved using a distinct read-out via a novel TGFα "shedding* assay [1021]. LPA has been proposed to be a ligand for GPR35 [1776], supported by a study revealing that LPA modulates macrophage function through GPR35 [1137]. However chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 17 (CXCL17 (CXCL17, Q6UXB2)) is reported to be a ligand for GPR35/CXCR8 [1503]. Moreover, LPA has also been described as an agonist for the transient receptor potential (Trp) ion channels TRPV1 [1733] and TRPA1 [1198].

There are also reports of a distinct metabotropic glutamate receptor coupled to phospholipase D in rat brain, which does not readily fit into the current classification [1199,1837] A related class C receptor composed of two distinct subunits, T1R1 + T1R3 is also activated by glutamate and is responsible for umami taste detection.</p>

        <p>G protein-coupled receptors → Motilin receptor Overview: Motilin receptors (provisional nomenclature) are activated by motilin (MLN, P12872), a 22 amino-acid peptide derived from a precursor (MLN, P12872), which may also generate a motilin-associated peptide (MLN, P12872). There are significant species differences in the structure of motilin and its receptor. In humans and large mammals such as dog, activation of these receptors by motilin released from endocrine cells in the duodenal mucosa during fasting, induces propulsive phase III movements. This activity is associated with promoting hunger in humans. Drugs and other non-peptide compounds which activate the motilin receptor may generate a more long-lasting ability to increase cholinergic activity within the upper gut, to promote gastrointestinal motility; this activity is suggested to be responsible for the gastrointestinal prokinetic effects of certain macrolide antibiotics (often called motilides; e.g. erythromycin, azithromycin), although for many of these molecules the evidence is sparse. Relatively high doses may induce vomiting and in humans, nausea. Agonists alemcinal [2338], erythromycin [626,2338], azithromycin [259] Selective agonists camicinal [124,2055] Comments: In terms of structure, the motilin receptor has closest homology with the ghrelin receptor. Thus, the human motilin receptor shares 52% overall amino acid identity with the human ghrelin receptor and 86% in the transmembrane regions [897,2297,2338]. However, differences between the N-terminus regions of these receptors means that their cognate peptide ligands do not readily activate each other [478,2055]. Where studied the motilin receptor does not appear to have constitutive activity [962]. Although not proven, the existence of biased agonism at the receptor has been suggested [1531,1597,2052]. A truncated 5-transmembrane structure has been identified but this is without activity when transfected into a host cell [5]. Receptor dimerisation has not been reported. It must be noted that for the complex macrolide structures, selectivity of action has often not been rigorously examined and other actions are possible (e.g. P2X inhibition by erythromycin; [2674]). Small molecule and selective motilin receptor agonists are now described [1371,2055,2528]. Significant species-dependent variations exist. Among mammals, the gene encoding the motilin percursor is absent in laboratory rodents, while the receptor appears to be a pseudogene [897,2053]. Functions of motilin are not usually detected in rodents, although brain and other responses to motilin and the macrolide alemcinal have been reported and the mechanism of these actions is obscure [1553,1734]. In some non-laboratory rodents (e.g. North American kangaroo rat (Dipodomys) and mouse (Microdipodops) a functional form of motilin may exist but the motilin receptor is non-functional [1371]. Marked differences in ligand affinities for the motilin receptor in dogs and humans may be explained by significant differences in receptor structure [2054]. Among birds, chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) motilin differs from human motilin at positions 4, 7-10, and 12, and contracts avian upper gastrointestinal tissues more potently than human motilin; in rabbit duodenum, the reverse is apparent [1195]. Chicken motilin receptor has 59% sequence homology with the human motilin receptor [2598]. In chicken, motilin does not mediate phase III activity of the MMC but initiates rhythmic oscillating complexes in the small intestine [2000]. Among reptiles, caiman/alligator motilin is similar to avian motilin, but markedly different forms of motilin exist in turtles, anole/lizard and snake. Their activities have not been examined in reptiles. Among amphibians, a motilin-like peptide has been identified in newts, with a structure differing from mammalian motilin. There may be some diversity among the anuran, urodelal and gymnophional species. In the upper gastrointestinal tract of frogs, human motilin but not erythromycin caused contraction [2666]. Among teleost fish, sequences for motilin peptide and motilin receptor have been identified (zebrafish, ballan wrasse, spotted sea bass) but the motilin peptides are short and the structure of motilin receptor differs from that of mammals. [652]) are activated by the endogenous 25 amino acid peptide neuromedin U (neuromedin U-25 (NMU, P48645), NmU-25), a peptide originally isolated from pig spinal cord [1593]. In humans, NmU-25 appears to be the sole product of a precursor gene (NMU, P48645) showing a broad tissue distribution, but which is expressed at highest levels in the upper gastrointestinal tract, CNS, bone marrow and fetal liver. Much shorter versions of NmU are found in some species, but not in human, and are derived at least in some instances from the proteolytic cleavage of the longer NmU. Despite species differences in NmU structure, the C-terminal region (particularly the C-terminal pentapeptide) is highly conserved and contains biological activity. Neuromedin S (neuromedin S-33 (NMS, Q5H8A3)) has also been identified as an endogenous agonist [1640]. NmS-33 is, as its name suggests, a 33 amino-acid product of a precursor protein derived from a single gene and contains an amidated C-terminal heptapeptide identical to NmU. NmS-33 appears to activate NMU receptors with equivalent potency to NmU-25. Comments: Multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and several splice variants have been identified in the human NPS receptor. The most interesting of these is an Asn-Ile exchange at position 107 (Asn 107 Ile). The human NPS receptor Asn 107 Ile displayed similar binding affinity but higher NPS potency (by approx. 10-fold) than human NPS receptor Asn107 [1967]. Several epidemiological studies reported an association between Asn 107 Ile receptor variant and susceptibility to panic disorders [545,549,1779,1931]. The SNP Asn 107 Ile has also been linked to sleep behavior [780], inflammatory bowel disease [468], )) [681,2153]. C-terminally extended forms of the peptides (neuropeptide W-30 (NPW, Q8N729) and neuropeptide B-29 (NPB, Q8NG41)) also activate NPBW1 [250]. Unique to both forms of neuropeptide B is the N-terminal bromination of the first tryptophan residue, and it is from this post-translational modification that the nomenclature NPB is derived. These peptides were first identified from bovine hypothalamus and therefore are classed as neuropeptides. Endogenous variants of the peptides without the N-terminal bromination, des-Br-neuropeptide B-23 (NPB, Q8NG41) and des-Br-neuropeptide B-29 (NPB, Q8NG41), were not found to be major components of bovine hypothalamic tissue extracts. The NPBW2 receptor is activated by the short and C-terminal extended forms of neuropeptide W and neuropeptide B [250]. Comments: Potency measurements were conducted with heterologously-expressed receptors with a range of 0. The y6 receptor is a functional gene product in mouse, absent in rat, but contains a frame-shift mutation in primates producing a truncated non-functional gene [796]. Many of the agonists exhibit differing degrees of selectivity dependent on the species examined. For example, the potency of PP is greater at the rat Y 4 receptor than at the human receptor [605]. [652]) are activated by the endogenous tridecapeptide neurotensin (pGlu-Leu-Tyr-Glu-Asn-Lys-Pro-Arg-Arg-Pro-Tyr-Ile-Leu) derived from a precursor (NTS, 30990), which also generates neuromedin N, an agonist at the NTS 2 receptor. [ 3 H]neurotensin mouse, rat) and [ 125 I]neurotensin (human, mouse, rat) may be used to label NTS 1 and NTS 2 receptors at 0.1-0.3 and 3-5 nM respectively. [158], and has been implicated in hormone trafficking and/or neurotensin uptake. A splice variant of the NTS 2 receptor bearing 5 transmembrane domains has been identified in mouse [225] and later in rat [1853]. endomorphin-1 and endomorphin-2 are also potential endogenous peptides. The Greek letter nomenclature for the opioid receptors, μ, δ and κ, is well established, and NC-IUPHAR considers this nomenclature appropriate, along with the symbols spelled out (mu, delta, and kappa), and the acronyms, MOP, DOP, and KOP. [455,523,652]. The human N/OFQ receptor, NOP, is considered 'opioid-related' rather than opioid because, while it exhibits a high degree of structural homology with the conventional opioid receptors [1616], it displays a distinct pharmacology. Currently there are numerous clinically used drugs, such as morphine and many other opioid analgesics, as well as antagonists such as naloxone, however only for the μ receptor. endomorphin-1 and endomorphin-2 have been identified as highly selective, putative endogenous agonists for the μ-opioid receptor. At present, however, the mechanisms for endomorphin synthesis in vivo have not been established, and there is no gene identified that encodes for either. Thus, the status of these peptides as endogenous ligands remains unproven.G protein-coupled receptors → Motilin receptor Overview: Motilin receptors (provisional nomenclature) are activated by motilin (MLN, P12872), a 22 amino-acid peptide derived from a precursor (MLN, P12872), which may also generate a motilin-associated peptide (MLN, P12872).

        <p>The richness of opioid receptor pharmacology has been enhanced with the recent discovery of allosteric modulators of μ and δ receptors, notably the positive allosteric modulators and silent allosteric "antagonists" outlined in [284,285]. Negative allosteric modulation of opioid receptors has been previously suggested [1126], whether all compounds are acting at a similar site remains to be established. [652]) are activated by the endogenous polypeptides orexin-A (HCRT, O43612) and orexin-B (HCRT, O43612) (also known as hypocretin-1 and -2; 33 and 28 aa) derived from a common precursor, preproorexin or orexin precursor, by proteolytic cleavage and some typical peptide modifications [2043]. Currently the only orexin receptor ligands in clinical use are suvorexant and lemborexant, which are used as hypnotics. Orexin receptor crystal structures have been solved [968,2271,2631,2633]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms of the P2YR 1 gene have been associated with different platelet reactivity to ADP [927]. Three frequent nonsynonymous P2Y 2 receptor polymorphisms have been identified, one of which was significantly more common in cystic fibrosis patients. This polymorphism is linked to increases in Ca 2+ influx in transfected cells, and might therefore play a role in disease development [290]. Although uridine triphosphate (UTP) was also shown to be a biased agonist at P2Y 11 , this is still under debate [1652,2532]. A group of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the P2Y 12 gene, forming the so called P2Y 12 H2 haplotype, has been associated with increased platelet responsiveness to ADP, increased risk of peripheral arterial disease and with coronary artery disease [333]. The platelet-type bleeding disorder due to P2Y 12 receptor defects is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by mild to moderate mucocutaneous bleeding and excessive bleeding after surgery or trauma. The defect is due to the inability of ADP to induce platelet aggregation [329]. The P2Y 13 receptor Met-158-Thr polymorphism, which is in linkage disequilibrium with the P2Y 12 locus, is not associated with acute myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus or related risk factors [50]. The P2Y 14 receptor was previously considered to exclusively bind sugar nucleotides such as UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose [344]. However, more recent evidence with several cell lines has demonstrated that uridine diphosphate (UDP) is 5-fold more potent than UDP-glucose [322]. UDP was also shown to competitively antagonise the UDP-glucose response at the human recombinant P2Y and is also known as P518 or 26RFa. RFRP is an RF amide-related peptide [940] derived from a FMRFamide-related peptide precursor (NPVF, Q9HCQ7), which is cleaved to generate neuropeptide SF (NPFF, O15130), neuropeptide RFRP-1 (NPVF, Q9HCQ7), neuropeptide RFRP-2 (NPVF, Q9HCQ7) and neuropeptide RFRP-3 (NPVF, Q9HCQ7) (neuropeptide NPVF).

        <p>G protein-coupled receptors → Proteinase-activated receptors Overview: Proteinase-activated receptors (PARs, nomenclature as agreed by the NC-IUPHAR Subcommittee on Proteinase-activated Receptors [959]) are unique members of the GPCR superfamily activated by proteolytic cleavage of their amino terminal exodomains. Agonist proteinase-induced hydrolysis unmasks a tethered ligand (TL) at the exposed amino terminus, which acts intramolecularly at the binding site in the body of the receptor to effect transmembrane signalling. TL sequences at human PAR1-4 are SFLLRN-NH 2 , SLIGKV-NH 2 , TFRGAP-NH 2 and GYPGQV-NH 2 , respectively. With the exception of PAR3, synthetic peptides with these sequences (as carboxyl terminal amides) are able to act as agonists at their respective receptors. Several proteinases, including neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G and chymotrypsin can have inhibitory effects at PAR1 and PAR2 such that they cleave the exodomain of the receptor without inducing activation of Gαq-coupled calcium signalling, thereby preventing activation by activating proteinases but not by agonist peptides. Neutrophil elastase (NE) cleavage of PAR1 and PAR2 can however activate MAP kinase signaling by exposing a TL that is different from the one revealed by trypsin [1939]. PAR2 activation by NE regulates inflammation and pain responses [1663,2676] and triggers mucin secretion from airway epithelial cells [2681]. Comments: Relaxin (RLN2, P04090) is the cognate peptide ligand for RXFP1 and is a potential treatment for heart failure [562]. Relaxin has vasodilatory, anti-fibrotic, angiogenic, anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects. A small molecule allosteric agonist ML290 has been developed [2143,2586], that displays anti-fibrotic properties [1103], and a relaxin B-chain mimetic peptide B7-33 has been developed which has cell specific signaling properties [979]. The antifibrotic actions of relaxin are dependent on the angiotensin receptor AT 2 [401] and are blocked by either AT 1 or AT 2 receptor antagonists. INSL3 (INSL3, P51460) is the cognate peptide for RXFP2 and is a circulating hormone that in males is essential for testicular descent in utero [1704] and in females has important roles in ovarian follicle function [1035]. In adults, INSL3 has potential roles in testicular function [1036] and the musculo-skeletal system [504]. RXFP2 is also present in brain, associated with cortico-thalamic motor circuits [2114]. cAMP elevation is the major signalling pathway for both RXFP1 and RXFP2 [989,990], but RXFP1 also activates MAP kinases, nitric oxide signalling, and tyrosine kinase phosphorylation; and relaxin can interact with glucocorticoid receptors [844]. RXFP1 displays ultra-sensitive responses to sub picomolar levels of relaxin [422].G protein-coupled receptors → Proteinase-activated receptors Overview: Proteinase-activated receptors (PARs, nomenclature as agreed by the NC-IUPHAR Subcommittee on Proteinase-activated Receptors [959]) are unique members of the GPCR superfamily activated by proteolytic cleavage of their amino terminal exodomains. Agonist proteinase-induced hydrolysis unmasks a tethered ligand (TL) at the exposed amino terminus, which acts intramolecularly at the binding site in the body of the receptor to effect transmembrane signalling. TL sequences at human PAR1-4 are SFLLRN-NH 2 , SLIGKV-NH 2 , TFRGAP-NH 2 and GYPGQV-NH 2 , respectively. With the exception of PAR3, synthetic peptides with these sequences (as carboxyl terminal amides) are able to act as agonists at their respective receptors.

        <p>Receptor expression profiles suggest that RXFP3 is a brain neuropeptide receptor [1457, 1458, 2195] and RXFP4 a gut hormone receptor [699]. The brain relaxin-3/RXFP3 system modulates feeding [698,699,883,2131,2194] via effects in hypothalamus [495,698,1116,1117], anxiety [1520,2031,2035,2656], reward and motivated, goal-directed behaviours [973,2031,2467], and spatial and social memory [37,836,837]. Of the other relaxin peptides, relaxin-3 (RLN3, Q8WXF3) is an agonist at RXFP3 and RXFP4 whereas INSL5 (INSL5, Q9Y5Q6) is an agonist at RXFP4 and a weak antagonist at RXFP3. Single chain peptide agonists and antagonists have been developed for RXFP3 [882,1336] and a small molecular weight agonist active at RXFP3 and RXFP4 [510]. INSL5 (INSL5, Q9Y5Q6) is secreted from enteroendocrine L cells and the INSL5/RXFP4 system affects food intake [806], colon motility [540]Receptor expression profiles suggest that RXFP3 is a brain neuropeptide receptor [1457, 1458, 2195] and RXFP4 a gut hormone receptor [699].

        <p>G protein-coupled receptors → Tachykinin receptors Overview: Tachykinin receptors (provisional nomenclature as recommended by NC-IUPHAR [652]) are activated by the endogenous peptides substance P (TAC1, P20366) (SP), neurokinin A (TAC1, P20366) (NKA; previously known as substance K, neurokinin α, neuromedin L), neurokinin B (TAC3, Q9UHF0) (NKB; previously known as neurokinin β, neuromedin K), neuropeptide K (TAC1, P20366) and neuropeptide γ (TAC1, P20366) (N-terminally extended forms of neurokinin A). The neurokinins (A and B) are mammalian members of the tachykinin family, which includes peptides of mammalian and nonmammalian origin containing the consensus sequence: Phe-x-Gly-Leu-Met. Marked species differences in in vitro pharmacology exist for all three receptors, in the context of nonpeptide ligands. Antagonists such as aprepitant and fosaprepitant were approved by FDA and EMA, in combination with other antiemetic agents, for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. β-phenylethylamine and octopamine in addition to the classical amine dopamine [219]. Emerging evidence suggests that TA 1 is a modulator of monoaminergic activity in the brain [2588] with TA 1 and dopamine D 2 receptors shown to form constitutive heterodimers when co-expressed [611]. In addition to trace amines, receptors can be activated by amphetamine-like psychostimulants, and endogenous thyronamines. Antagonists EPPTB (Inverse agonist) (pIC 50 5.1) [236] Labelled ligands [ 3 H]tyramine (Agonist) [219] Comments: In addition to TA 1 , in man there are up to 5 functional TAAR genes (TAAR2, 5,6,8,9). See [219] for detailed discussion. The product of the gene TAAR2 (also known as GPR58) appears to respond to β-phenylethylamine &gt; tyramine and to couple through G s [219].G protein-coupled receptors → Tachykinin receptors Overview: Tachykinin receptors (provisional nomenclature as recommended by NC-IUPHAR [652]) are activated by the endogenous peptides substance P (TAC1, P20366) (SP), neurokinin A (TAC1, P20366) (NKA; previously known as substance K, neurokinin α, neuromedin L), neurokinin B (TAC3, Q9UHF0) (NKB; previously known as neurokinin β, neuromedin K), neuropeptide K (TAC1, P20366) and neuropeptide γ (TAC1, P20366) (N-terminally extended forms of neurokinin A).

        <p>TAAR3, in some individuals, and TAAR4 are pseudogenes in man, although functional in rodents. The signalling characteristics and pharmacology of TAAR 5 (PNR, Putative Neurotransmitter Receptor: TAAR5, O14804), TAAR 6 (Trace amine receptor 4, TaR-4: TAAR6, 96RI8), TAAR 8 (Trace amine receptor 5, GPR102: TAAR8, Q969N4 ) and TAAR 9 (trace amine associated receptor 9: TAAR9, 96RI9) are lacking. The thyronamines, endogenous derivatives of thyroid hormone, have affinity for rodent cloned trace amine receptors, including TA 1 [2073]. An antagonist EPPTB has recently been described with a pK i of 9.1 at the mouse TA 1 but &gt;5. ) is activated by the endogenous dodecapeptide urotensin-II (UTS2, O95399), originally isolated from the urophysis, the endocrine organ of the caudal neurosecretory system of teleost fish [163,2436]. Several structural forms of U-II exist in fish and amphibians [2437]. The goby orthologue was used to identify U-II as the cognate ligand for the predicted receptor encoded by the rat gene gpr14 [49,452,1418,1641,1753]. Human urotensin-II (UTS2, O95399), an 11-amino-acid peptide [452], retains the cyclohexapeptide sequence of goby U-II that is thought to be important in ligand binding [258,1187,1360]. This sequence is also conserved in the deduced amino-acid sequence of rat urotensin-II {Rat} (14 amino-acids) and mouse urotensin-II {Mouse} (14 amino-acids), although the N-terminal is more divergent from the human sequence [451]. A second endogenous ligand for the UT has been discovered in rat [2260]. This is the urotensin II-related peptide (UTS2B, Q765I0), an octapeptide that is derived from a different gene, but shares the C-terminal sequence (CFWKYCV) common to U-II from other species. Identical sequences to rat urotensin II-related peptide (UTS2B, Q765I0) are predicted for the mature mouse and human peptides [563]. UT exhibits relatively high sequence identity with somatostatin, opioid and galanin receptors [2437]. Comments: Vasopressin and oxytocin receptors have a characteristic and sometimes overlapping distribution in a number of tissues including brain. There are phylogenetic, ontogenetic and sex-specific differences in the levels and distribution of these receptors, particularly in the brain.

        <p>G protein-coupled receptors → Metabotropic glutamate receptors Overview: Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors (nomenclature as agreed by the NC-IUPHAR Subcommittee on Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors [2091]) are a family of G protein-coupled receptors activated by the neurotransmitter glutamate. The mGlu family is composed of eight members (named mGlu1 to mGlu 8 ) which are divided in three groups based on similarities of agonist pharmacology, primary sequence and G protein coupling to effector: Group-I (mGlu 1 and mGlu 5 ), Group-II (mGlu 2 and mGlu 3 ) and Group-III (mGlu 4 , mGlu 6 , mGlu 7 and mGlu 8 ) (see Further reading).G protein-coupled receptors → Metabotropic glutamate receptors Overview: Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors (nomenclature as agreed by the NC-IUPHAR Subcommittee on Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors [2091]) are a family of G protein-coupled receptors activated by the neurotransmitter glutamate.

        <p>Structurally, mGlu are composed of three juxtaposed domains: a core G protein-activating seven-transmembrane domain (TM), common to all GPCRs, is linked via a rigid cysteine-rich domain (CRD) to the Venus Flytrap domain (VFTD), a large bi-lobed extracellular domain where glutamate binds. mGlu form constitutive dimers, cross-linked by a disulfide bridge. The structures of the VFTD of mGlu 1 , mGlu 2 , mGlu 3 , mGlu 5 and mGlu 7 have been solved [1272,1622,1680,2378]. The structure of the 7 transmembrane (TM) domains of both mGlu1 and mGlu5 have been solved, and confirm a general helical organization similar to that of other GPCRs, although the helices appear more compacted [407,554,2571]. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have provided structures of full-length mGlu receptor dimers [1211]. Studies have revealed the possible formation of heterodimers between either group-I receptors, or within and between group-II and -III receptors [557]. First well characterized in transfected cells, co-localization and specific pharmacological properties also suggest the existence of such heterodimers in the brain [1634]. [830,1745,2634]. Beyond heteromerization with other mGlu receptor subtypes, increasing evidence suggests mGlu receptors form heteromers and larger order complexes with class A GPCRs (reviewed in [798]).Structurally, mGlu are composed of three juxtaposed domains: a core G protein-activating seven-transmembrane domain (TM), common to all GPCRs, is linked via a rigid cysteine-rich domain (CRD) to the Venus Flytrap domain (VFTD), a large bi-lobed extracellular domain where glutamate binds. mGlu form constitutive dimers, cross-linked by a disulfide bridge.

        <p>The endogenous ligands of mGlu are L-glutamic acid, L-serine-O-phosphate, N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) and L-cysteine sulphinic acid. Group-I mGlu receptors may be activated by 3,5-DHPG and (S)-3HPG [235] and antagonized by (S)-hexylhomoibotenic acid [1467]. Group-II mGlu receptors may be activated by LY389795 [1623], LY379268 [1623], eglumegad [2092,2574], DCG-IV and (2R,3R)-APDC [2093], and antagonised by eGlu [1055] and LY307452 [610,2523]. Group-III mGlu receptors may be activated by L-AP4 and (R,S)-4-PPG [713]. An example of an antagonist selective for mGlu receptors is LY341495, which blocks mGlu 2 and mGlu 3 at low nanomolar concentrations, mGlu 8 at high nanomolar concentrations, and mGlu 4 , mGlu 5 , and mGlu 7 in the micromolar range [1185]. In addition to orthosteric ligands that directly interact with the glutamate recognition site, allosteric modulators that bind within the TM domain have been described. Negative allosteric modulators are listed separately. The positive allosteric modulators most often act as 'potentiators' of an orthosteric agonist response, without significantly activating the receptor in the absence of agonist.The endogenous ligands of mGlu are L-glutamic acid, L-serine-O-phosphate, N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) and L-cysteine sulphinic acid.

The PAF receptor (provisional nomenclature recommended by NC-IUPHAR [652]) is activated by PAF and other suggested endogenous ligands are oxidized phosphatidylcholine [1502] and lysophosphatidylcholine [1765].

        <p>G protein-coupled receptors → Succinate receptor Overview: Nomenclature as recommended by NC-IUPHAR [485]. The Succinate receptor was identified as being activated by physiological levels of the Kreb's cycle intermediate succinate and other dicarboxylic acids such as maleate in 2004. Since its pairing with its endogenous ligand, the receptor has been the focus of intensive research and its role has been evidenced in various (patho)physiological processes such as regulation of renin production, retinal angiogenesis, inflammation or the immune response.G protein-coupled receptors → Succinate receptor Overview: Nomenclature as recommended by NC-IUPHAR [485].

        <p>The NK 1 receptor has also been described to couple to G proteins other than G q/11 [2015]. The crystal structure of the human NK 1 receptor in complex with antagonists has been determined [2095,2632]. The hexapeptide agonist septide appears to bind to an overlapping but non-identical site to substance P (TAC1, P20366) on the NK 1 receptor. There are additional subtypes of tachykinin receptor; an orphan receptor (SwissProt P30098) with structural similarities to the NK 3 receptor was found to respond to NKB when expressed in Xenopus oocytes or Chinese hamster ovary cells [547,1244].

VPAC 1 and VPAC 2 receptors display comparable affinity for the PACAP peptides, PACAP-27 (ADCYAP1, P18509) and PACAP-38 (ADCYAP1, P18509), and VIP (VIP, P01282), whereas PACAP-27 (ADCYAP1, P18509) and PACAP-38 (ADCYAP1, P18509) are &gt;100 fold more potent than VIP (VIP, P01282) as agonists of most isoforms of the PAC 1 receptor. However, one splice variant of the human PAC 1 receptor has been reported to respond to PACAP-38 (ADCYAP1, P18509), PACAP-27 (ADCYAP1, P18509) and VIP (VIP, P01282) with comparable affinity [482]. PG 99-465 [1633] has been used as a selective VPAC 2 receptor antagonist in a number of physiological studies, but has been reported to have significant activity at VPAC 1 and PAC 1 receptors [530]. The selective PAC 1 receptor agonist maxadilan, was extracted from the salivary glands of sand flies (Lutzomyia longipalpis) and has no sequence homology to VIP (VIP, P01282) or the PACAP peptides [1647].
