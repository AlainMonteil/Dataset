        <p>Gastrointestinal microbiota and immune cells interact closely and display regional specificity, but little is known about how these communities differ with location. Here, we simultaneously assess microbiota and single immune cells across the healthy, adult human colon, with paired characterisation of immune cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes, to delineate colonic immune niches at steady-state. We describe distinct T helper cell activation and migration profiles along the colon and characterise the transcriptional adaptation trajectory of T regulatory cells between lymphoid tissue and colon. Finally, we show increasing B cell accumulation, clonal expansion and mutational frequency from caecum to sigmoid colon, and link this to the increasing number of reactive bacterial species.Gastrointestinal microbiota and immune cells interact closely and display regional specificity, but little is known about how these communities differ with location.

        <p>The colon, as a barrier tissue, represents a unique immune environment where immune cells display tolerance towards a diverse community of microbescollectively known as the microbiome. The microbiome is critical for many aspects of health and an imbalance of commensals and pathogenic microbes is linked with many disease states 1 . Thus, understanding what constitutes a healthy, homeostatic relationship between host immune cells and the microbiome of the human colon is of critical importance. At a coarse-grained level, intestinal microbiota and immunity have been studied extensively. Here, we provide an in-depth map of proximal-todistal changes in the colonic microbiome and host immune cells.The colon, as a barrier tissue, represents a unique immune environment where immune cells display tolerance towards a diverse community of microbescollectively known as the microbiome.

        <p>The composition of the microbiota at any location in the intestines is determined by the availability of nutrients, oxygen and the transit rate of luminal content, and as such, is spatially distinct 2 . Regional differences are most evident when comparing the small intestine and distal colon in humans or other mammals 3,4 . Within the colon, early studies identified changes from proximal (including the caecum, ascending and transverse colon) to distal colon (comprising the descending and sigmoid colon connecting to the rectum). Changes were evident with respect to the growth rates and activities of some bacteria species, which were dependent on nutrient availability 4 . A proximal-to-distal gradient of bacterial diversity in which the number of operational taxonomic units (OTU) increases has been reported 5 . The intestinal immune system has a symbiotic relationship with the microbiome and is central to the maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity. The lamina propria and associated lymphoid tissues contain one of the largest and most diverse communities of immune cells -including both lymphocytes and myeloid cells 6 . There is marked regional variation in immune cells along the gastrointestinal tract, with T helper (Th) 17 cells decreasing in number from duodenum to colon, and T regulatory (Treg) cells being highest in the colon 7 . Whether there is further complexity, with distinct immunological niches, within the colon remains to be elucidated. Immune cells can respond to environmental cues including the microbiota. Mouse studies have demonstrated that specific bacterial species can fine-tune intestinal immune responses, including Th17 8,9 , Treg 10 , or Th1 11 polarisation and function 8,12 and B cell activation 13 . However, the extent to which there is regional variation in the mucosal microbiome within an individual, and how this might influence local immune cell niches along the colon, has not been investigated to date.The composition of the microbiota at any location in the intestines is determined by the availability of nutrients, oxygen and the transit rate of luminal content, and as such, is spatially distinct 2 .

        <p>Here, we catalogued the mucosal microbiome in different regions of the human colon, a gastrointestinal organ with the most diverse and dense microbiome content and region-restricted disease states 14 . In parallel, we applied single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to make a census of steady-state immune cell populations in the adjacent tissue and in draining mesenteric lymph nodes (mLN), available at www.gutcellatlas.org. We demonstrate previously unappreciated changes in the proportions and activation status of T and B cells in distinct regions of the healthy human colon from proximal to distal, and relate these differences to the changing microbiota.Here, we catalogued the mucosal microbiome in different regions of the human colon, a gastrointestinal organ with the most diverse and dense microbiome content and region-restricted disease states 14 .

        <p>To create a map of bacterial composition at the mucosal surface of the colon, we performed 16S ribosomal sequencing of swabs from the mucosa surface of the caecum, transverse colon and sigmoid colon of twelve disease-free Caucasian deceased transplant donors (Figure 1a &amp; Supp Table 1). The major gut phyla -Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, were present throughout the gut of each donor (Figure 1b &amp; Supp Table 2). While diversity of OTUs was consistent across the colon, and significant variability existed between donor as previously reported 15 (Supp Figure 1a), we did observe changes in the composition of the microbiome. Most notably at the level of phyla, Bacteroidetes was more prevalent in sigmoid colon (Figure 1c &amp; Supp Figure 1b). This was mostly attributable to an increase in Bacteroides, which dominates the colonic microbiome of individuals on high protein and fat diets typical in Western countries 16 (Figure 1c and Supp Figure 1a). Additionally, Enterococcus was more prevalent in the proximal colon, and Coprobacillus and Shigella, typically pathogenic, were more abundant in the distal colon, although these proportions varied considerably between donors (Figure 1b &amp; 1c &amp; Supp Figure 1c).To create a map of bacterial composition at the mucosal surface of the colon, we performed 16S ribosomal sequencing of swabs from the mucosa surface of the caecum, transverse colon and sigmoid colon of twelve disease-free Caucasian deceased transplant donors (Figure 1a &amp; Supp Table 1).

        <p>Past studies characterising the colonic microbiome typically rely on stool samples, which do not accurately recapitulate the composition of bacteria at the mucosal surface 17 . Our catalog of mucosal bacteria throughout the colon demonstrates heterogeneity in the microbiome at the mucosal surface from proximal to distal colon, and reveals specific genera with preference for colonising certain colon regions.Past studies characterising the colonic microbiome typically rely on stool samples, which do not accurately recapitulate the composition of bacteria at the mucosal surface 17 .

        <p>Next, we sought to determine whether the heterogeneity we observed in the colonic microbiome was accompanied by differences in the adjacent host immune cells. To this end, we generated high-quality transcriptional data from over 41,000 single immune cells from the mLN and lamina propria of caecum, transverse colon and sigmoid colon (Figure 1a). We acquired tissue biopsies from five deceased transplant donors (Supp Table 1). Samples were dissociated to release cells from the mLN and lamina propria of colonic tissue. Immune cells were enriched either by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of CD4 + T cells (live CD45 + CD3 + CD4 + ) and other immune cells (live CD45 + CD3 -CD4 -), or by CD45 + magnetic bead selection or Ficoll gradient. Each fraction was then subjected to scRNA-seq (see Methods; Figure 1a &amp; Supp. Figure 1d). Despite the enrichment for immune cells, we captured epithelial cells and fibroblasts and these were computationally removed from further analysis (see Methods).Next, we sought to determine whether the heterogeneity we observed in the colonic microbiome was accompanied by differences in the adjacent host immune cells.

        <p>Projection (UMAP) of all four tissues from all donors revealed distinct clusters in the lymphoid and colonic tissues (Figure 1d &amp; Supp Figure 1e). We identified 25 cell types and states in the intestinal lamina propria and mLN (Figure 1d &amp; Supp Table 3 &amp; Supp Table 4), consistent with the immune populations described in recent reports 18 . Among these were follicular and memory B cells, IgA + and IgG + plasma cells, effector and memory CD4 + T cells, T regulatory (Treg) cells, CD8 + T cells, γδ T cells, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), natural killer (NK) cells, mast cells and myeloid cells (Figure 1d). Sub-clustering of myeloid cells showed two distinct populations of conventional dendritic cells: cDC1 expressing XCR1, CADM1, CLEC9A, BATF3 and IDO1, and cDC2 expressing CLEC10A and CD86 (Figure 1d &amp; 1e). In addition, we identified monocytes expressing CD14 and CD68, macrophages expressing FCGR3A (gene encoding CD16), LYVE1 macrophages 19 and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) expressing IRF4 and SELL. B cells, DCs and γδ T cells had MKI67 + cycling populations suggesting higher rates of proliferation compared to other colonic immune cell populations (Figure 1d &amp; 1e).Projection (UMAP) of all four tissues from all donors revealed distinct clusters in the lymphoid and colonic tissues (Figure 1d &amp; Supp Figure 1e).

        <p>To determine how immune cells differ along the colon from proximal to distal regions, we investigated the relative proportions of cell types within mLN and colon regions (Figure 1f &amp; 1g). Since CD4 + T cells and all other immune cells were sorted separately during initial tissue processing, our analyses here were also kept separate. As noted from our visual inspection of the UMAP plot (Figure 1d), there were major differences in the cell types present between mLN and the colon. In particular, there were marked differences in the activation and memory status of T and B cells between the colon and lymph nodes, suggesting that these cell types are moulded by their environment (Figure 1f &amp; 1g). In the mLN, CD4 + T cells were typically CXCR5 + , ICOS hi follicular helper cells, and SELL + (encodes CD62L), CCR7 + central memory cells (Figure 1e and1f). In contrast, colonic CD4 + T cells had a more effector phenotype, expressing high levels of the tissue residency marker CD69 20 , falling into the Th17 (CCR6 + , IL22 + ) or Th1 (CXCR3 + , IFNG + ) subtypes. There was an inverted gradient in the relative proportion of Th17 and Th1 cells, with the caecum dominated by Th17 cells that reduced in frequency in the transverse colon, and still further in the sigmoid colon, and Th1 cells following the opposite trend, being more abundant in the sigmoid colon (Figure 1f). This distinct distribution of colonic Th1 and Th17 cells is concordant with spatial variation of the microbiome, hinting at a relationship between the two populations. B cells in the mLN were predominantly CD19 + , MS4A1 + (encodes CD20), CD40 + , TNFRSF13B + (encodes TACI), CD38 -memory or CXCR5 + , TCL1A + , FCER2 + (encodes CD23) follicular B cells (Figure 1e and1g). In contrast, in the three regions of the colon, the main population of B cells were SDC1 + (encodes CD138), CD38 + , plasma cells. Curiously, plasma cells were enriched in the sigmoid colon relative to both the caecum and transverse colon, whilst the proportion of memory B cells was lower in the sigmoid colon (Figure 1g). This suggests that conditions in the sigmoid colon may favour the generation of plasma cells rather than memory B cells from germinal centre responses in this region, or that the tissue contains more plasma cell niches.To determine how immune cells differ along the colon from proximal to distal regions, we investigated the relative proportions of cell types within mLN and colon regions (Figure 1f &amp; 1g).

        <p>We next investigated CD4 + T effector cells across the colon. Correlation analysis of Th1 and Th17 cells between different colon tissues revealed high transcriptional similarity between these effector cell subtypes (Figure 2a), with mLN versus peripheral tissue signature accounting for the greatest amount of variability (Spearman's corr = 0.88). Within the effector T cells of the colon, transverse colon and caecum cells cluster by T helper subtype. Surprisingly, Th1 and Th17 cells of the sigmoid colon did not cluster with their respective effector subtypes from other regions. Differential gene expression analysis between the effector cells in the sigmoid colon versus those in caecum and transverse colon revealed higher expression of activation-related molecules including TANK (TRAF family member associated NF-kB activator) (adjusted P &lt; 10 -10 ), CD83 (adjusted P &lt; 10 -10 ) and PIM3 (adjusted P &lt; 10 -8 ) (Figure 2b). Expression of CCL20, encoding the ligand for CCR6 that is expressed by epithelial and myeloid cells more highly in small intestines than colon 21 , was also slightly increased by T helper cells of the proximal colon (Figure 2b), although this is likely due to higher abundance of CCL20 + Th17 cells at this site (Figure 1f &amp; Supp Figure 2a). Conversely, sigmoid colon effector T cells showed higher expression of KLF2 (adjusted P &lt; 10 -14 ) (Figure 2b) that encodes a transcriptional factor that transactivates the promoter for Sphingosine-1phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) and is critical for T cell recirculation through peripheral lymphoid tissue 22 , LMNA (adjusted P &lt; 10 -47 ) that is reported to promote Th1 differentiation 23 and EEF1G (adjusted P &lt; 10 -13 ), a driver of protein synthesis 24 .We next investigated CD4 + T effector cells across the colon.

        <p>Next, we looked into the clonal relationships between T helper cells. We performed plate-based Smartseq2 on TCRα/β + FACS-sorted cells from colon regions and mLN of a sixth donor to capture paired gene expression and TCR sequences from individual T cells. Clonal groups were shared between Th1 and Th17 subtypes, supporting the notion that effector fate of CD4 + T cells is determined after their initial activation 25 . Additionally, clonal expansion was observed by Th1 cells of the sigmoid colon (Figure 2C), in line with greater abundance in this tissue. Likewise, clonal expansion of Th17 cells was greatest in the caecum matching accumulation seen with the droplet-based scRNA-seq analysis. Several Th1 and Th17 clonal sisters were shared between clonal sites (Figure 2C), evidence that Th clones disseminate to distant regions of the colon.Next, we looked into the clonal relationships between T helper cells.

        <p>Together these data demonstrate region-specific transcriptional differences relating to activation and tissue migration in Th1 and Th17 cells of the proximal and sigmoid colon. Identification of clonal sharing between these colon regions supports the idea that these observed transcriptional differences are due to cell-extrinsic rather than intrinsic factors.Together these data demonstrate region-specific transcriptional differences relating to activation and tissue migration in Th1 and Th17 cells of the proximal and sigmoid colon.

        <p>Treg cells are known to play a role in balancing the immune activity of other CD4 T cell subsets. Documented Treg cell activation by Clostridium spp. 10 and previous descriptions of tissue-specific transcriptional profiles 26 inspired us to interrogate these cells in greater detail. Firstly, we noted that the relative proportion of Treg cells did not change significantly from proximal to distal colon (Figure 1f). We then investigated whether the transcriptional profiles of Tregs from different compartments indicated distinct activation states or functionalities.Treg cells are known to play a role in balancing the immune activity of other CD4 T cell subsets.

        <p>Central Tregs were defined by highest expression of SELL, while effector Tregs were characterised by genes associated with the TNFRSF-NF-κB pathway (TNFRSF9 and TNF) (Supp Figure 3a). In addition, we observed a population, previously termed non-lymphoid tissue-like Tregs (NLT-like Treg). These have characteristics of nonlymphoid tissue Treg cells, including high expression of FOXP3, PRDM1, RORA, IL2RG, IL2RA and CTLA4 (Figure 3a &amp; Supp Figure 3a). A fourth population, termed Treg-like cells, lacked the conventional markers of Treg cells -FOXP3 and IL2RAbut clustered more closely with Treg cells than conventional T cells (Figure 3a and Supp Figure 3a). These expressed the highest levels of PDCD1 (gene encoding PD-1) among Treg populations and, uniquely, the transmembrane protein MS4A6A (Supp Figure 3a). This population of Treg-like cells could represent a Treg population that transiently loses FOXP3 expression 27 .Central Tregs were defined by highest expression of SELL, while effector Tregs were characterised by genes associated with the TNFRSF-NF-κB pathway (TNFRSF9 and TNF) (Supp Figure 3a).

        <p>In the colon, Tregs clustered into three populations as previously described in mouse (Figure 3a) 26 . KLRB1 + (also known as CD161) Treg cells were characterised by expression of LAG3, IL2RA, CTLA4, KLRB1, ICOS and FOXP3 (Supp Figure 3a) suggesting a robust regulatory function, analogous to the peripherally-derived induced Treg cells described in mouse 28 and similar to CD161 + Tregs described in human colon tissue 20,29 . Non-lymphoid tissue Treg (NLT Treg) cells express IKZF2, GATA3 and DUSP4 (Supp Figure 3a) consistent with the profile of thymic-derived Tregs 30 . The third population exhibited a profile reminiscent of lymphoid tissue Tregs with expression of SELL, CCR7, TCR7, CXCR5 and RGS2, and were termed Lymphoid Tissue-like Treg (LT-like Treg) cells (Supp Figure 3a). LT-like Treg cells are likely newly arrived in the colon tissue from mLN. A small number of Ki67 + Treg cells were also identified in the colon and mLN (Figure 3a &amp; Supp Table 3). The proportions of these subsets varied by donor, but were mostly consistent between colon regions (Figure 3b).In the colon, Tregs clustered into three populations as previously described in mouse (Figure 3a) 26 .

        <p>The presence of NLT-like Treg cells in the mLN and LT-like Treg cells in the colon, both with profiles suggesting migration, led us to recreate this migration pathway in silico. We ordered all Tregs along "pseudo-space" using Monocle2. This gave rise to a smooth pseudo-space trajectory from resting central Tregs in the mLN to highly suppressive Tregs in the colon (Figure 3c). As seen in the mouse 26 , NLT-like Tregs and LT-like Tregs blended in the middle of the trajectory, in accordance with these cells representing transitioning and migratory populations between lymphoid and peripheral tissues. In order to understand which gene signatures drive the migration and tissue adaptation of Tregs in human tissues, we determined the genes changing along the previously calculated 'pseudo-space' (Figure 3c). Genes expressed at the beginning of pseudo-space included SELL, CCR7 and CXCR4, permitting entry into lymph nodes (Figure 3c). At the end of pseudo-space, the most highly expressed genes were FOXP3, IL2RA, CTLA4, IL10 and LAG3. These largely suppressive genes were co-expressed with TNF receptors (TNFRSF4, TNFRSF14, TNFRSF18, TNFRSF1B) indicating a reliance on the TNFRSF-NF-κB axis. Chemokine receptors CXCR3, CXCR6, CCR6 and CCR4 were also expressed by Tregs cells in the periphery, matching previous reports of Th1/Th17-like Tregs cells in the colon (Figure 3c) 26 .The presence of NLT-like Treg cells in the mLN and LT-like Treg cells in the colon, both with profiles suggesting migration, led us to recreate this migration pathway in silico. We ordered all Tregs along "pseudo-space" using Monocle2. This gave rise to a smooth pseudo-space trajectory from resting central Tregs in the mLN to highly suppressive Tregs in the colon (Figure 3c). As seen in the mouse 26 , NLT-like Tregs and LT-like Tregs blended in the middle of the trajectory, in accordance with these cells representing transitioning and migratory populations between lymphoid and peripheral tissues.

        <p>Together, these results highlight heterogeneity in Treg cell states in mLN and colon, and reveal a possible Foxp3-transiently absent population. We also infer a continuous activation trajectory of these Treg cell states between draining lymph nodes and colon, and highlight genes regulating Treg cell migration between tissues and their adoption of Th-like profiles.Together, these results highlight heterogeneity in Treg cell states in mLN and colon, and reveal a possible Foxp3-transiently absent population.

        <p>Following from our observations in CD4 + T cells across the colon, we next focused on humoral responses by performing a more in-depth analysis of B cells in different colon regions. We compared transcriptional profiles of plasma cells between different colonic regions. This analysis revealed CCL3 and CCL4 as highly enriched in caecal plasma cells (log fold change of 0.61 and 0.70 and adjusted P &lt;10 -28 and &lt;10 -9 respectively) (Figure 4a). These chemokines are secreted by B cells in response to BCR activation 31 and result in the migration of CCR5-expressing cells such as T cells 32,33 and monocytes 34 to the tissue microenvironment. This suggests that BCR cross-linking and signalling may be more prominent in the proximal colon. Caecal plasma B cells were also enriched for CXCR4 (log fold change of 0.44, adjusted P &lt; 10 -10 ) (Figure 4a), a chemokine receptor highly expressed by germinal centre (GC) B cells and important for the movement of plasmablasts to the GC-T zone interface post-GC responses 35 .Following from our observations in CD4 + T cells across the colon, we next focused on humoral responses by performing a more in-depth analysis of B cells in different colon regions.

        <p>Amongst the genes more highly expressed by plasma cells in the sigmoid colon was CD27 (Figure 4a; log fold change of 0.24; adjusted P &lt;10 -40 ), a member of the TNF receptor family that is expressed by memory B cells and even more highly by plasma cells 36 . We confirmed differential expression of CD27 at the protein level and additionally observed a proximal-to-distal gradient of increasing CD27 expression by plasma cells in the colon (Figure 4b). Targeted homing of B cells from their site of activation in lymphoid tissues to the colonic lamina propria relies on signalling through CCR10 and its cognate ligand, CCL28, and integrin α4β7 37,38,39 . CCR10 (log fold change of 0.24; adjusted P &lt; 10 -16 ), ITGA4 (log fold change of 0.58; adjusted P &lt; 10 -24 ) and ITGB4 (log fold change 0.57; adjusted P &lt; 10 -108 ) were also more highly expressed by sigmoid colon IgA + plasma cells (Figure 4a).Amongst the genes more highly expressed by plasma cells in the sigmoid colon was CD27 (Figure 4a; log fold change of 0.24; adjusted P &lt;10 -40 ), a member of the TNF receptor family that is expressed by memory B cells and even more highly by plasma cells 36 .

        <p>To determine whether the B cell clonal repertoire changes across the colon, we took advantage of the paired single-cell VDJ-sequencing data available from two donors for which scRNA-seq libraries were generated using 10x Genomics 5' chemistry. We confirmed the expression of IgM and IgD isotypes by follicular B cells, IgG1 and IgG2 by IgG + plasma cells, IgA1 and IgM expression by memory cells in the mLN and predominantly IgA2 expression by plasma cells of the colon (Figure 4c). The mutation frequency of the heavy chain variable region was greatest in the plasma cells followed by memory B cells, indicating more somatic hypermutation by these cell types compared to the naive follicular B cells (Figure 4d). Additionally, while mutational frequency was consistent across colon regions and mLN for memory and follicular B cells, it was significantly increased in IgA + plasma cell of the sigmoid colon compared to the other colon regions (Figure 4e). IgG + plasma cells also showed a trend towards increased mutational frequency in the sigmoid colon, however their numbers were limiting (Figure 4e).To determine whether the B cell clonal repertoire changes across the colon, we took advantage of the paired single-cell VDJ-sequencing data available from two donors for which scRNA-seq libraries were generated using 10x Genomics 5' chemistry.

        <p>We then identified clonally-related B cells and plasma cells examine clonal expansion dynamics of different cellular populations throughout the gut. Clonal expansion was evident in memory B cells, IgA + plasma cells and IgG + plasma cells (Figure 4f). While the relative abundance of clonal groups did not differ across the colon regions of memory B cells and IgG + plasma cells, again this was greatest for IgA + plasma cells in the sigmoid colon (Figure 4f). This was supported by bootstrapped VDJ sequence diversity analysis of clonally-related IgA + plasma cells, which showed that the diversity of BCR sequences was consistent between donors and that there was a trend for decreased diversity (consistent with higher rates of clonal expansion) of IgA + plasma cells in the sigmoid colon (Supp Figure 4a &amp;4b).We then identified clonally-related B cells and plasma cells examine clonal expansion dynamics of different cellular populations throughout the gut.

        <p>While some clones were shared between B cell types (i.e. memory and IgA + plasma), indicating that alternate B cell fates can derive from a single precursor cell, most expanded clones within the gut were of the same cell type (Supp Figure 4c). Finally, we found many examples of B cell clones shared between all three colonic regions, and to a lesser extent the mLN, for both donors (Figure 4g), indicating dissemination of B cells throughout the colon as previously reported 40 . Our observation of B cell dissemination throughout the colon was replicated with bulk BCR sequencing from whole tissue (Figure 4h) 41 . Interestingly, increased clonal variability of sigmoid colon B cells was reflected in a greater spread of BCR variable chains expressed compared with caecum and transverse colon (Supp. Figure 4d), altogether suggesting a more active response in the distal versus proximal colon.While some clones were shared between B cell types (i.e. memory and IgA + plasma), indicating that alternate B cell fates can derive from a single precursor cell, most expanded clones within the gut were of the same cell type (Supp Figure 4c).

        <p>Reports by Macpherson et al. have shown that IgA is secreted by plasma cells in response to the presence of specific bacteria species, rather than as a general response to the microbiome 42 . In light of this, we wondered whether the increased plasma cell activation we observed in the sigmoid colon was linked to the differences in reactive bacteria species. To this end, we assessed IgA-opsonisation of bacteria from the donor microbiome samples (Figure 5a). Surprisingly, a greater proportion of bacteria from the sigmoid colon was positive for IgA-binding compared with bacteria of the caecum and transverse colon (Figure 5b). Furthermore, shotgun sequencing of IgA-opsonised bacteria revealed a richer community of species in the sigmoid colon (Figure 5c &amp; Supp Table 5). Interestingly, diversity of IgA-bound bacteria, which considers relative abundance of each species, was lower in the sigmoid colon compared to caecum (Figure 5d). These data suggest that, compared with the caecum, IgA + plasma cells of the sigmoid colon respond to a rich and unevenly represented community of bacterial species, likely contributing to their increased activation status, strong homing to the colon and trend towards greater clonal diversity (Figure 5e).Reports by Macpherson et al. have shown that IgA is secreted by plasma cells in response to the presence of specific bacteria species, rather than as a general response to the microbiome 42 .

        <p>In contrast to conventional T cells, Treg cells are evenly represented across the colon. Treg cell subpopulations within the mLN and colon tissue are analogous to those we have recently described in mouse 26 . We also identify an additional population, termed Treg-like cells, reminiscent of a CD25 -FOXP3 lo PD1 hi Treg population in the peripheral blood, although the latter was described to also express Ki67 44 . This population could represent uncommitted Treg cells experiencing transient loss of FOXP3 while retaining regulatory potential 27 or permanent loss FOXP3 and adoption of a more pro-inflammatory phenotype after repeated stimulation 45 . Our pseudo-space analysis of Treg cells suggests a continuum of activation states from resting cells in the lymphoid tissue through to highly suppressive cells in the periphery. We identify genes underlying this transition including chemokine receptors that are strongly expressed on arrival in the intestine that enable interaction with, and suppression of, Th1 and Th17 cells 46 . Similarly to mouse, pseudospace from lymphoid to peripheral tissue correlates with transcriptional markers of migratory potential and suppression of effector cells.In contrast to conventional T cells, Treg cells are evenly represented across the colon.

        <p>Sigmoid colon plasma cells, in particular, exhibit greater mutational abundance and clonal expansion. Previous work has shown the mutational frequency of B cells is consistently high between duodenum and colon and are primarily driven by dietary and microbiome antigens respectively 49 . Thus, we suggest that enhanced plasma cell accumulation, mutation and expansion in the sigmoid colon is in response to continued stimulation from the local microbiome. This may happen through increased engagement of sigmoid colon plasma cells in T cell-mediated germinal centre reactions in gut-associated lymphoid structures or in T cell-independent somatic hypermutation in local isolated lymphoid follicles 50 followed by local expansion. Yet the exact mechanisms require further study.Sigmoid colon plasma cells, in particular, exhibit greater mutational abundance and clonal expansion.

        <p>Finally, we show greater IgA binding to the microbiome in the sigmoid colon compared to proximal sites (Figure 5b). One possible explanation for this observation is the accumulation of upstream secreted IgA and IgA-bound bacteria in the sigmoid colon. However, our simultaneous observation of enhanced plasma cell responses in the sigmoid colon suggests that IgA is locally produced as a result of immune poising. Possible scenarios contributing to a richer immune-reactive microbiome in the sigmoid colon are bacteria derived externally via the rectum. Alternatively, environmental pressures (i.e. lower water and nutrient levels 4 ) could restrict outgrowth of dominant gastrointestinal species of the proximal colon, providing space for smaller communities of opportunistic species. The IgA response in the colon is antigen-specific rather than a general response to the presence of bacteria 51,42 . Thus, the overall increased number of unique species recognised by host IgA antibodies in the sigmoid colon is fitting with the enhanced clonal expansion and mutation of plasma cells at this site.Finally, we show greater IgA binding to the microbiome in the sigmoid colon compared to proximal sites (Figure 5b).

In short, the counts were normalised to 10,000 reads per cell (sc.pp.normalise_per_cell) and log transformed (sc.pp.log1p) to be comparable amongst the cells. The number of UMIs and percentage of mitochondrial genes were regressed out (sc.pp.regress_out) and genes were scaled (sc.pp.scale) to unit variance. The normalised counts were used to detect highly variable genes (sc.pp.highly_variable_genes). Batch correction between the donors was performed using bbknn method 57 on 50 PCs and trim parameter set to 100. Clusters were then identified using Leiden graph-based clustering (resolution set to 1). Cell identity was assigned using known markers shown in Figure 1E and the top differentially expressed genes identified using Wilcoxon rank-sum test (sc.tl.rank_genes_groups function, Supplementary Table 4). CD4 T cells, myeloid cells, B cells were subclustered for identification of subsets within each cluster.
