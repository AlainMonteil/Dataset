        <p>Backgro und: Increasing evidence connects the gut microbiota and the onset and/or phenotype of Parkinson's disease (PD). Differences in the abundances of specific bacterial taxa have been reported in PD patients. It is, however, unknown whether these differences can be observed in individuals at high risk, for example, with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, a prodromal condition of a-synuclein aggregation disorders including PD. Objectives: To compare microbiota in carefully preserved nasal wash and stool samples of subjects with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, manifest PD, and healthy individuals. Methods: Microbiota of flash-frozen stool and nasal wash samples from 76 PD patients, 21 idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder patients, and 78 healthy controls were assessed by 16S and 18S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing. Seventy variables, related to demographics, clinical parameters including nonmotor symptoms, and sample processing, were analyzed in relation to microbiome variability and controlled differential analyses were performed.Backgro und: Increasing evidence connects the gut microbiota and the onset and/or phenotype of Parkinson's disease (PD).

        <p>Results: Differentially abundant gut microbes, such as Akkermansia, were observed in PD, but no strong differences in nasal microbiota. Eighty percent of the differential gut microbes in PD versus healthy controls showed similar trends in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, for example, Anaerotruncus and several Bacteroides spp., and correlated with nonmotor symptoms. Metagenomic sequencing of select samples enabled the reconstruction of genomes of so far uncharacterized differentially abundant organisms. C on c lus i o n: Our study reveals differential abundances of gut microbial taxa in PD and its prodrome idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder in comparison to the healthy controls, and highlights the potential of metagenomics to identify and characterize microbial taxa, which are enriched or depleted in PD and/or idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder.

        <p>The classical pathological hallmarks of PD are Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites comprised of aggregations of the protein a-synuclein (aSyn). The latter are considered to lead to neuronal loss in the dopaminergic SN of the central nervous system (CNS). Relatively recently, aSyn aggregation has also been observed in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). [1][2][3][4][5] aSyn aggregation in the autonomic plexus of the intestine is even hypothesized to represent a main source of the disease. [1][2][3][4][5][6] In an epidemiological study, a decreased risk for subsequent Parkinson's disease (PD) was shown after complete (but not selective) truncal vagotomy. 7 This suggests that the vagal nerve may be critically involved in the aSyn pathology of PD apparently ascending from the PNS to the CNS. 8 Furthermore, inflammation and increased permeability of the mucosal lining of the colon have been shown in PD. 1,9 Both conditions are associated with the function of the gut microbiota, whose members might therefore play the roles of "drivers, perpetuators and mediators" of PD. 10 The olfactory bulb is also affected by aSyn pathology in very early stages, reflected by hyposmia. 6,8 Based on these observations, it has been suggested that a currently unknown infectious or otherwise transmissible agent may enter the brain through the nasal cavity and/or gastrointestinal tract and initiate the ascending pathological process to the CNS as postulated in the "dual-hit hypothesis." 11 In animal models, toxins can reach the CNS from the olfactory bulb 12 and aSyn aggregation triggered by toxins or bacterial amyloid proteins in the enteric nervous system can spread to the CNS. 13,14 Several recent studies have reported PD-related changes in bacterial populations in the gut, [15][16][17][18][19][20][21] but different sample handling and preservation procedures as well as confounding factors 19 may account for inconsistency 22 between the reports. Also, less is known about the microbiome of the nasal cavity. 23 Individuals likely to develop PD, who may already display differences in the periphery, have not been studied so far. Increasing evidence points toward a long prodromal phase of PD, that is marked by nonmotor symptoms 1,9,24 and may start 20 to 30 years before the diagnosis of motor PD. Longitudinal follow-up of subjects with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) has shown a high specificity for later development of an aSyn aggregation disorder, including PD, with a high conversion rate. [24][25][26] Comparisons of PD patients to individuals with iRBD may therefore be informative on the timing of changes, which may influence future research on the role of these microbiota in PD development and progression.The classical pathological hallmarks of PD are Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites comprised of aggregations of the protein a-synuclein (aSyn).

        <p>The two analyzed body sites exhibited obvious differences in the density of microbial colonization (Fig. 1A), the number of different taxa in the community (Fig. 1B), and community structures (Fig. 1C). At all analyzed taxonomic levels (phylum, class, order, family, genus, and OTU level), variation within the community structures was greater in the nasal samples than in the gastrointestinal samples (multivariate homogeneity of group dispersions P value 5 0.0001; Fig. 1D). In addition, the nasal data set was sparser, that is, it contained less OTUs common to samples of different individuals, with only a single OTU (of the genus Corynebacterium) present in all samples. Paired nasal and gastrointestinal microbiota structures of individuals (n 5 56) showed no significant dependence or correlation of both microbiota, indicating that the factors shaping both communities differ.The two analyzed body sites exhibited obvious differences in the density of microbial colonization (Fig. 1A), the number of different taxa in the community (Fig. 1B), and community structures (Fig. 1C).

        <p>Differentially Abundant Taxa in RBD versus HC and Comparison to PD Differential analysis (with subjects having comorbid diabetes as covariate, like above) identified 41 differentially abundant OTUs in iRBD subjects compared to HCs (FDR-adjusted P values &lt; 0.05 and jlog 2 fold changej &gt; 1; n HC 5 38, n RBD 5 20; Fig. 2B). Of these 41 OTUs, nine were also among the 48 differentially abundant OTUs in PD patients' gut microbiota compared to HCs and changed in the same direction compared to HCs (Supplementary Information). Thirty other differentially abundant OTUs in RBD versus HC or in PD versus HCs showed the same directions of change in the comparisons to HCs. Therefore, more than 75% of the differentially abundant OTUs in the comparisons of PD or iRBD versus HCs showed qualitatively similar changes compared to HCs. For example, common patterns in PD and iRBD were observed for Anaerotruncus spp., Clostridium XIVb, several Bacteroidetes, and an unclassified bacterium OTU_469.Differentially Abundant Taxa in RBD versus HC and Comparison to PD Differential analysis (with subjects having comorbid diabetes as covariate, like above) identified 41 differentially abundant OTUs in iRBD subjects compared to HCs (FDR-adjusted P values &lt; 0.05 and jlog 2 fold changej &gt; 1; n HC 5 38, n RBD 5 20; Fig. 2B).

        <p>Two of the OTUs that were significantly higher abundant in PD compared to HCs (Akkermansia sp. and Prevotella sp.) were also significantly more highly abundant in PD patients with RBD by PSG compared to PD patients without RBD, despite the fact that these OTUs were not significantly differential in subjects with iRBD compared to PD.Two of the OTUs that were significantly higher abundant in PD compared to HCs (Akkermansia sp. and Prevotella sp.) were also significantly more highly abundant in PD patients with RBD by PSG compared to PD patients without RBD, despite the fact that these OTUs were not significantly differential in subjects with iRBD compared to PD.</p>
        <p>The relative abundances of three of the differentially abundant gastrointestinal OTUs in PD were significantly related to motor symptoms (by MDS-UPDRS part III) within the PD cohort, namely OTUs of Anaerotruncus spp., Clostridium XIVa, and Lachnospiraceae (Fig. 2B). Six OTUs, including from the genera Anaerotruncus, Akkermansia, and several unclassified Bacteria, were significantly related to nonmotor symptoms according to MDS-UPDRS part I in the gut microbiota of PD patients (Fig. 2B). More specifically, the presence of depression (as evaluated by the MADRS) and anxiety (by MDS-UPDRS I.4) were significant grouping factors independently of the study group for the prokaryotic (both unadjusted P values 5 0.02), but not the eukaryotic, microbiota and differed significantly in the PD and iRBD patients versus HCs. OTUs that were significantly differentially abundant and related to depression in the PD cohort included Anaerotruncus spp. No effect of cognition (by MMSE and/or MoCa), sleepiness (ESS), or pain (MDS-UPDRS I.9) on the gastrointestinal microbial community structures was observed.The relative abundances of three of the differentially abundant gastrointestinal OTUs in PD were significantly related to motor symptoms (by MDS-UPDRS part III) within the PD cohort, namely OTUs of Anaerotruncus spp., Clostridium XIVa, and Lachnospiraceae (Fig. 2B).

        <p>Because we observed 10 OTUs without taxonomic classification with significantly different abundances in the patient cohorts versus HCs, we aimed to characterize their genomes and their functional potential. Only three of these differentially abundant OTUs were found at relative abundances above 1% (OTU_171, OTU_469, and OTU_332), potentially allowing recovery of the genomes by whole metagenome shotgun sequencing. Metagenomic sequencing data (20 Gb) were obtained from two samples (of an HC and an iRBD subject) with high levels of two of these OTUs. One reconstructed genome each was linked to OTU_469 and OTU_171 using the 16S genes predicted in the metagenomic data (Fig. 3; see Supplementary Information for the method). OTU_469 was classified as an a-proteobacterium. Assessment of the functions encoded in the genome reconstruction pointed to a fermentatitve lifestyle, auxotrophy for most vitamins, and motility. Interestingly, the genome encoded an endoglucanase with a synuclein-like domain. OTU_171 was found to have 98.9% identity to a genome reconstruction of the cyanobacterium Melainabacterium MelB1, 57 and these two shared traits such as a fermentative metabolism, flagellation, and B vitamin synthesis. No cyanobacterial toxin genes [58][59][60] were found (see Supplementary Tables).Because we observed 10 OTUs without taxonomic classification with significantly different abundances in the patient cohorts versus HCs, we aimed to characterize their genomes and their functional potential.

        <p>In this study, the community structures of nasal and gut microbiomes of 76 PD patients and 78 matched healthy individuals were analyzed and compared with 21 subjects with iRBD, the most specific prodrome of PD. 25 Specific effort was taken to preserve the microbiota by flash-freezing of nasal fluid and stool, to avoid any technical confounders. 39,61 This approach was chosen because the nasal cavity and gastrointestinal tract have been suggested to constitute the two ports of entry for a possible pathogenic agent and from where PD-related aggregated aSyn spreads to the CNS. So far, microbiome-based analyses in relation to PD have focused either on the gastrointestinal tract 15- 17,19 or not systematically compared both sites. 15,23 OTUs common to the nasal and gastrointestinal microbiota were found, likely attributed to nasal discharge being swallowed. 62 However, none of these OTUs were found to differ significantly between PD patients and HCs, indicating that distinct signatures of PD are potentially present in the gut and nasal microbiota. The nasal microbiota displayed higher variation over the different individuals and most OTUs were only sparsely detected, in accord with earlier observations. 23,[63][64][65] The strongest grouping factor observedIn this study, the community structures of nasal and gut microbiomes of 76 PD patients and 78 matched healthy individuals were analyzed and compared with 21 subjects with iRBD, the most specific prodrome of PD. 25 Specific effort was taken to preserve the microbiota by flash-freezing of nasal fluid and stool, to avoid any technical confounders. 39,61 This approach was chosen because the nasal cavity and gastrointestinal tract have been suggested to constitute the two ports of entry for a possible pathogenic agent and from where PD-related aggregated aSyn spreads to the CNS.

        <p>In contrast to the results obtained for the nasal cavity, we found significant grouping of the gastrointestinal microbial community structures according to the three study groups (PD patients, iRBD subjects, and HCs). The same analysis revealed influences of medication of oral antidiabetics, which has previously been observed. 66 Controlling for this factor in the differential analysis, we confirmed one previous observation 16,17,19,20 of differences in microbial abundances in PD, namely the enrichment of Akkermansia sp. in individuals with PD. Enrichment in Akkermansia muciniphila is known to be related to longer gastrointestinal passage times. 67,68 However, we did not find Akkermansia abundances to be related to self-reported constipation. Akkermansia spp. is usually considered to be beneficial for human physiology, 69 attributed to strengthening of gastrointestinal barrier function and anti-inflammatory immune stimulation, [70][71][72] but depletion of the mucus layer by enriched Akkermansia sp. has been linked to higher susceptibility to a pathogen in an animal model. 73 Butyrate-producing bacteria have also been associated with opposing effects in PD, including a protective role attributed to the observed decrease in PD patients 16 and a causative role attributed to the induction of microglia activation and motor symptoms through short-chain fatty acids in a mouse model. 74 In the present study, no depletion of butyrate producers was observed, and predictions of the coding potential of the microbiota based on the classified OTUs indicated no significant differences in any butyrate-producing enzymes (see Supplementary Information). These differences to earlier studies 16,17,19 indicate the necessity of further studies with direct measurements of short-chain fatty acid levels in stool 17 or in situ as well as in larger cohorts. Such studies would also enable the identification of microbiota associated with nonmotor phenotypes. 75 Our results, in line with observations in human cohorts 76,77 and animal models, 78,79 point to a relationship between the microbiome and depression, independently of antidepressive medication.In contrast to the results obtained for the nasal cavity, we found significant grouping of the gastrointestinal microbial community structures according to the three study groups (PD patients, iRBD subjects, and HCs).

        <p>An overlap of differential taxa was observed in iRBD and PD compared to HCs. However, the gastrointestinal microbial signatures of RBD were distinct from those in PD, showing, among others, a decrease in Prevotellaceae, similar to observations in a recent study with newly diagnosed PD patients. 20 Longitudinal observations of RBD patients who are likely to progress to an aSyn aggregation disorder will be important to characterize the changes afflicted before and close to the onset of motor disease and to validate the predictive potential of these changes for the risk of developing PD. Several recent studies have relied on predictions of functional consequences from microbial abundances, 16,19 but elucidation of the actual coding potential of the microbial communities 20 is indispensable, because the predictions do not account for microbes without sequenced genomes, which make up approximately 40% of the gut microbiome. 80 One of the novel OTUs (OTU_171) that we observed to be depleted in PD patients was from the family of Melainabacteria 57 of the phylum Cyanobacteria. Free-living cyanobacteria are known to produce a range of neurotoxins, such as Anatoxin and Saxitoxin and the neurotoxin b-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), 81 which has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases. [82][83][84] Although the enzymes required for the biosynthesis of BMAA are not yet known, 85 no known enzymes for the production of neurotoxins are encoded in the presented genome reconstruction. This observation, together with the depletion in individuals with PD, argues against a role of the OTU as a producer of neurotoxins. This particular strain may, in fact, have a protective role, potentially outcompeting related toxin-producing strains from the same species as widely observed for enteric pathogens. 86 Another noteworthy group of proteins are those with similarity to aSyn, of which we found a gene in the metagenomic reconstruction of the so far undescribed OTU_469 that was depleted in PD and iRBD patients and may therefore also exert a protective effect.An overlap of differential taxa was observed in iRBD and PD compared to HCs.

        <p>In summary, our analysis revealed and confirmed differential abundances of gut, but not nasal, microbial taxa in PD patients and also revealed overlaps between PD and iRBD microbiota. We point out that standardized sample collection and preservation, whole metagenomic analyses in combination with functional omics, and metabolite detection are necessary to pinpoint microbial functions that may interact with the human body during the development of PD and to derive concrete hypotheses about how the microbiome may be involved in the different dimensions of this heterogeneous disease.In summary, our analysis revealed and confirmed differential abundances of gut, but not nasal, microbial taxa in PD patients and also revealed overlaps between PD and iRBD microbiota.
