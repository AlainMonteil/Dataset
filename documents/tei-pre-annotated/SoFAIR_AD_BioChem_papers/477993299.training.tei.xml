        <p>Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method of studying the causal effects of modifiable exposures (i.e. potential risk factors) on health, social and economic outcomes using genetic variants associated with the specific exposures of interested. MR provides a more robust understanding of the influence of these exposures on outcomes since germline genetic variants are randomly inherited from parents to offspring and, as a result, should not be related to potential confounding factors that influence exposure-outcome associations. The genetic variant can therefore be used as a tool to link the proposed risk factor and outcome, and to estimate this effect with less confounding and bias than conventional epidemiological approaches. We describe the scope of Mendelian randomization, highlighting the range of applications being made possible as genetic datasets and resources become larger and more freely available. We outline the Mendelian randomization approach in detail, covering concepts, assumptions and estimation methods. We cover some common misconceptions, provide strategies for overcoming violation of assumptions, and discuss future prospects for extending the clinical applicability, methodological innovations, robustness and generalizability of MR findings.Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method of studying the causal effects of modifiable exposures (i.e. potential risk factors) on health, social and economic outcomes using genetic variants associated with the specific exposures of interested.

        <p>Mendelian randomization (MR) was developed as a method to help provide a robust understanding of environmentally modifiable influences on disease [1]. It was proposed to offer a more reliable strategy than conventional observational epidemiological studies which have traditionally been plagued by issues such as confounding (where a common cause of an exposure X and outcome Y may distort the association between X and Y), reverse causation (where Y -or the disease process leading to Yinfluences X) and other forms of bias, thus resulting in potentially misleading causal inference [2]. The clearest examples are shown through observational epidemiological studies which have indicated an apparent causal effect that has later failed to be confirmed in large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [3]. The proposed protective effects of vitamin and antioxidant supplements on cardiovascular disease [4,5], beta carotene on lung cancer [6,7], and selenium on prostate cancer [8,9] are noteworthy examples. Such spurious findings from observational studies have had negative consequences, including the launch of expensive trials based on inadequate evidence, and increased uptake of nutritional supplements in the general population, some of which have subsequently been found to have adverse effects [7,9]. MR utilizes genetic variants robustly associated with exposures to strengthen inference regarding their potential causal influence on a particular outcome [1,10]. The online "MR Dictionary" [11] offers a full description and definitions of terminology specific to MR which will be useful to refer to as we elaborate on the concepts and scope of the approach in this paper.Mendelian randomization (MR) was developed as a method to help provide a robust understanding of environmentally modifiable influences on disease [1].

        <p>The MR approach draws on Mendel's laws of segregation and independent assortment, whereby genetic variants are allocated independently of environment and other genetic factors (except those in close physical proximity to the variant of interest, which tend to be inherited together through linkage disequilibrium (LD)) [3]. Based on the premise that the random inheritance of genetic variants from parents to offspring is reflected at a population level, genetic variants can identify groups that differ, on average, by a modifiable exposure. Here, group membership should not be associated with a range of behavioral, social and physiological factors that may confound observational associations [12]. By design, genetic associations should therefore be largely free from confounding and so any difference in outcomes between genetically defined groups can be directly attributed to the exposure.The MR approach draws on Mendel's laws of segregation and independent assortment, whereby genetic variants are allocated independently of environment and other genetic factors (except those in close physical proximity to the variant of interest, which tend to be inherited together through linkage disequilibrium (LD)) [3].

        <p>The association between an outcome and a genetic variant known to proxy a particular risk factor mimics the link between the outcome and the proposed risk factor, and can be used to estimate this relationship with less confounding and bias than conventional epidemiological approaches. Other qualities of (germline) genetic variants which make them useful in causal inference analysis are that they: can be robustly associated with modifiable exposures (i.e. can serve as strong genetic proxies); are fixed at conception and not influenced by disease processes (i.e. are less susceptible to reverse causation); are subject to relatively little measurement error and typically have long-term effects (i.e. are less liable to the underestimation of the exposure-outcome association, referred to as regression dilution bias) [13].The association between an outcome and a genetic variant known to proxy a particular risk factor mimics the link between the outcome and the proposed risk factor, and can be used to estimate this relationship with less confounding and bias than conventional epidemiological approaches.

        <p>Exposures of interest are typically modifiable and so evidence of causality can -in principle -be used to infer that intervening on an exposure will lead to a change in the outcome under investigation. Making such inference depends upon considering it reasonable to accept the principle of gene-environment equivalence: that perturbation of a phenotype by either a (hypothetical) change in genotype or by environmental change would produce the same downstream effect on an outcome [14][15][16][17]. For example, under this assumption, we would anticipate genotypic influence on circulating cholesterol level would lead to the same effect on coronary heart disease (CHD) as would a similar change in cholesterol level induced by dietary influences. While many exposures can be closely proxied by genetic variation, for others it is unlikely that genetic variation will mimic environment exactly, for example in capturing aspects of social deprivation and income [18]. Gene-environment equivalence is a fundamental principle in MR which also brings to the fore the issue of the time-depth of the exposure that is being examined, since genetic variants that influence a phenotype will do so over an extended period. We will come back to the issue of time, discussed at length in the MR literature since its inception [1,13,19].Exposures of interest are typically modifiable and so evidence of causality can -in principle -be used to infer that intervening on an exposure will lead to a change in the outcome under investigation.

        <p>Within a causal inference framework, MR can be implemented as a form of instrumental variable (IV) analysis where the genetic variants serve as proxies or IVs for the modifiable factors of interest (Figure 1) [20]. If we suppose X and Y are the exposure and outcome of interest, C is a set of variables that affects X and Y (i.e. potential confounding factors), and U is a further set of variables that affect Y, we can use a further variable G (the genetic variant of interest) as an IV in order to establish the causal effect of X on Y if it satisfies the following assumptions [21]: 1) G is robustly associated with X ("relevance");Within a causal inference framework, MR can be implemented as a form of instrumental variable (IV) analysis where the genetic variants serve as proxies or IVs for the modifiable factors of interest (Figure 1) [20].

        <p>When the basic principles of MR were initially formalized there were few examples of genetic variants which had robust associations with potentially modifiable exposures, and it was recognized that the future potential of MR would depend upon identifying such associations [1]. There has been very substantial progress in this area. Improvements and cost reductions in array-based genotyping techniques, complemented by DNA sequencing and imputation of information from human genome reference sets, have led to a dramatic increase in our understanding of the genetic contribution to disease risk. Such improvements have also permitted the widespread use of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) which have been successful at detecting replicable associations between common genetic variants and a host of traits in a hypothesis-free approach.When the basic principles of MR were initially formalized there were few examples of genetic variants which had robust associations with potentially modifiable exposures, and it was recognized that the future potential of MR would depend upon identifying such associations [1].

        <p>The establishment of genome-wide association study consortia, each focused on investigating different complex traits and diseases, has encouraged numerous population-based studies to contribute genetic data for meta-analysis (Table 2). This has in turn increased sample sizes for the discovery and robust replication of GWAS findings. Many of these consortia have also made their GWAS summary data publicly available which, aided by data resources hosting such summary data [22], has catalyzed the development of summary data-based MR studies (described in more detail in "MR Methods").The establishment of genome-wide association study consortia, each focused on investigating different complex traits and diseases, has encouraged numerous population-based studies to contribute genetic data for meta-analysis (Table 2).

        <p>The recent availability of massive genotyped and phenotyped datasets, including biobank resources (Table 2), has added considerably to GWAS efforts. GWAS of phenotypic data from these resources are increasingly performed in an automated fashion, with summary statistics made freely available online (Figure 2).

        <p>The key assumption of MR is that of gene-environment equivalence, as discussed above. When using the properties of germline genetic variants to strengthen causal inference, the confidence that a particular modifiable exposure is implicated in the causation of a disease can be enhanced by identifying the direction and magnitude of the effect. This can be estimated through IV analysis. The large majority of MR studies are now implemented within an IV framework, and therefore the IV assumptions are central to MR analysis.The key assumption of MR is that of gene-environment equivalence, as discussed above.

        <p>Relevance assumption: The genetic variant must be robustly associated with the exposure The most common method of deriving genetic instruments in recent MR studies is via GWAS, whereby single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which pass genome-wide significance (p&lt;5 x 10 -8 ) are typically considered for inclusion. However, it is important that the strength of the instrument is tested separately to appraise the relevance assumption, which is often done by means of the proportion of variance explained (r 2 ) and the related F-statistic, which additionally takes into account the size of the sample under investigation. Increasingly, multiple genetic variants are found to be independently associated with traits investigated in GWAS and these may be combined in genetic risk scores or through meta-analysis approaches to explain more variation in the trait [23]. This in turn can be used to increase power, obtain more precise causal estimates and minimize risk of weak instrument bias (i.e. uncertainty in the SNP-exposure association which can bias causal estimates) [24].Relevance assumption: The genetic variant must be robustly associated with the exposure The most common method of deriving genetic instruments in recent MR studies is via GWAS, whereby single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which pass genome-wide significance (p&lt;5 x 10 -8 ) are typically considered for inclusion.

        <p>2) Independence/exchangeability assumption: There are no confounders of the association between the genetic variant and outcome Since genetic variants are randomized at conception, they should be allocated independent of environmental and other genetic variants excluding those in LD. This means that at a family level, genetic associations should be largely free from conventional confounding. While MR was explicitly introduced in 2003 within a parent-offspring design, data availability did not generally allow use of such designs at the time. It was suggested, however, that population-based studies with appropriate control for population stratification could approximate the parent-offspring design [1,3]. Concerns about potential violation of this assumption at a population level relate to confounding by ancestry or population stratification, which can influence variation in both allele frequency and disease risk in population(s) being investigated (Figure 3). Approaches to limit spurious associations generated because of population groups include use of genetic associations derived from homogeneous populations or with adequate control for population structure e.g. through principal components analysis or linear mixed models [25]. However, the independence assumption can also be violated by dynastic effects (when parental genotypes directly affect offspring phenotypes), or by assortative mating (when individuals select a partner based on a particular phenotype). These biases will likely differ depending on the exposure(s), outcome(s) and population(s) under study.2) Independence/exchangeability assumption: There are no confounders of the association between the genetic variant and outcome Since genetic variants are randomized at conception, they should be allocated independent of environmental and other genetic variants excluding those in LD.

        <p>It is impossible to fully prove the independence assumption in an MR study because, while attempts can be made to account for ancestry and examine how genetic variants relate to measured confounders, associations with unknown confounders cannot be demonstrated. In addition, while previous recommendations have been to assess associations between the genetic instrument and a wide range of potential confounders of the exposure-outcome association [12], where associations are observed, this is unlikely to be due to a direct effect of the confounders on the genotypes and instead could indicate confounding by ancestry (Figure 3) or horizontal pleiotropy, as described below (Figure 4).It is impossible to fully prove the independence assumption in an MR study because, while attempts can be made to account for ancestry and examine how genetic variants relate to measured confounders, associations with unknown confounders cannot be demonstrated.

        <p>3) Exclusion restriction assumption: The genetic variant should only influence the outcome of interest via the exposure Biological pleiotropy is the phenomenon whereby a genetic variant influences multiple traits and is a major threat to the exclusion restriction assumption. However, it is important to make the distinction between vertical and horizontal pleiotropy [10,26]. Vertical (or mediated) pleiotropy occurs where the genetic variant (G) is associated with the outcome (Y) because G affects Y through the exposure (X). This fulfils the exclusion restriction assumption and is the essence of the MR approach. Horizontal (unmediated or biological) pleiotropy occurs when G affects both X and Y but through different pathways. This will often yield biased estimates in MR if a genetic instrument influences the outcome via a mechanism other than the exposure of interest [27]. Such pleiotropy can be direct, as in the path from G to Y (uncorrelated pleiotropy), or can be indirect, e.g. when G affects X and Y through a shared confounder, U (correlated pleiotropy) [28] (Figure 4). The latter may occur in cases of mis-specifying the primary phenotype, such as when a genetic variant is used to proxy for a trait secondary to the trait with which it is directly associated.3) Exclusion restriction assumption: The genetic variant should only influence the outcome of interest via the exposure Biological pleiotropy is the phenomenon whereby a genetic variant influences multiple traits and is a major threat to the exclusion restriction assumption.

        <p>One method of ensuring that the genetic variant is unlikely to influence the outcome via another pathway is to use a SNP which has known biological function or is located in a gene which directly codes for the exposure of interest.

        <p>For a detailed description of these scenarios and applied examples see Holmes et al [19]. While functional SNP analyses may therefore appear plausible, they can have their drawbacks and many of the sensitivity analyses used for evaluating pleiotropy cannot be applied with a single SNP (see "Methods for assessing and accounting for horizontal pleiotropy"). Instead, it is recommended that associations between the SNP and a wide range of traits are investigated, as described below.For a detailed description of these scenarios and applied examples see Holmes et al [19].

        <p>The presence of associations between genetic variants and other factors may reveal violations to the independence and/or exclusion restriction assumption. A common approach to appraise this is to assess whether the genetic variants used to instrument the exposure (and those variants in LD with the genetic instrument) have been associated with other phenotypes in genome-wide association studies, for example by searching 
            <rs type="software">PhenoScanner</rs> [33]. While this may highlight genetic variants with horizontal pleiotropy, it can also pick up vertical pleiotropy (e.g. a SNP related to body mass index (BMI) may appear in a GWAS of blood pressure via its influence on BMI). In addition, truly horizontal pleiotropic SNPs may not be detected by this method if the GWAS of the phenotype on the pleiotropic path is absent or underpowered. As such, it is not sufficient to simply exclude the variants which appear in other GWAS as a way to assess the exclusion restriction assumption.
        </p>
        <p>In some instances, conducting a stratified analysis can provide evidence against the possibility of horizontal pleiotropy. When a genetic variant is not related to the exposure of interest in a particular subgroup of the population, this variant should also not be associated with the outcome of interest in this subgroup (given an absence of the association with the exposure). For example, ALDH2, coding for aldehyde dehydrogenase 2, is a common polymorphism in East Asian populations which has been used as a genetic instrument for alcohol consumption [32,34,35]. In East Asian populations, where women are much less likely drink to alcohol than men, this polymorphism is not strongly associated with alcohol intake among women [34]. This approach has been used to assess the presence of pleiotropy and evaluate a causal relationship between alcohol consumption and increased blood pressure [34] and risk of vascular disease [35]. For example, if the effects of alcohol consumption on blood pressure and vascular disease are causal, we would expect to find evidence of association between variation in ALDH2 and the outcomes in East Asian men, but not East Asian women. Any association observed between ALDH2 and the outcomes in East Asian women, in the absence of alcohol intake, would indicate pleiotropy. Such an approach can be considered a negative control design [36] and additional models build on this approach to detect and adjust for the pleiotropic effects and provide valid estimates in such instances [37,38] (see "Methods for assessing and accounting for horizontal pleiotropy").In some instances, conducting a stratified analysis can provide evidence against the possibility of horizontal pleiotropy.

Such an approach can be considered a negative control design [36] and additional models build on this approach to detect and adjust for the pleiotropic effects and provide valid estimates in such instances [37,38] (see "Methods for assessing and accounting for horizontal pleiotropy").</p>
        <p>However, genetic variants which are not associated with the exposure in a subgroup of a population may be difficult to identify, and so such direct assessment of pleiotropy is often not as straightforward.However, genetic variants which are not associated with the exposure in a subgroup of a population may be difficult to identify, and so such direct assessment of pleiotropy is often not as straightforward.</p>
        <p>While it may seem intuitive to assess whether statistical adjustment for the exposure leads to attenuation of the gene-outcome relationship, this is not a recommended approach for testing the exclusion restriction assumption. This is because adjusting for the exposure may induce collider bias, where another factor which causes the exposure becomes correlated with the genetic instrument by conditioning on the exposure in this manner [39] (Figure 5). It is also worth emphasizing that the stratification approach used in the alcohol consumption example above may also lead to a similar bias if genotypes are not randomly distributed within the strata of exposure. While stratifying by sex is not problematic in this context, since biological sex is not caused by other factors, it is a potential problem in instances where genetic effects are investigated within other subsets of the population, for example if we were to stratify on alcohol drinker status itself [40]. Further to this, bias induced through adjustment for the exposure may be magnified by potential measurement error in the exposure [41].While it may seem intuitive to assess whether statistical adjustment for the exposure leads to attenuation of the gene-outcome relationship, this is not a recommended approach for testing the exclusion restriction assumption.

        <p>In the pre-GWAS era, most examples of applied MR were conducted using known polymorphisms assayed within one dataset, i.e. where genetic variants, exposure and outcomes of interest obtained from individuals in the same sample (Figure 6A). In such a scenario, the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome can typically be estimated using 2-stage least-squares (2SLS) regression [42]. In the first stage, the exposure is regressed on the genetic instrument and in the second stage the outcome is regressed against the predicted values from the first stage. The effect estimate can then be interpreted as the change in the outcome per unit increase in the exposure. The genetic instrument used in onesample analysis can be a single SNP, multiple SNPs, or a genetic risk score i.e. a summation of risk alleles for each individual which can be unweighted or weighted to give those genetic variants with the strongest effect on the exposure more weight [23].In the pre-GWAS era, most examples of applied MR were conducted using known polymorphisms assayed within one dataset, i.e. where genetic variants, exposure and outcomes of interest obtained from individuals in the same sample (Figure 6A).

        <p>The simplest approach for using summary-level data in an MR framework is to derive a Wald ratio for a single SNP. This is the effect estimate for the SNP-outcome association (from sample 2) divided by the coefficient of the SNP-exposure association (from sample 1), with the standard error of the Wald ratio often approximated by the delta method [48]. In the presence of multiple genetic instruments, a metaanalysis approach (usually inverse-weighted meta-analysis (IVW)) may be used to combine Wald ratio estimates of the causal effect obtained from different SNPs [23]. The point estimates from an IVW MR are equivalent to a weighted linear regression of the SNP-outcome associations on SNP-exposure associations when the intercept is constrained to zero. The effect estimates obtained should also be equivalent to the effect estimated in 2SLS when sample sizes are large, SNPs independent and there is limited heterogeneity in the Wald ratios.The simplest approach for using summary-level data in an MR framework is to derive a Wald ratio for a single SNP.

        <p>If the estimate obtained for a causal effect is of a consistent magnitude across multiple independent variants, then pleiotropy is less likely to be a concern. However, often effect estimates are not consistent across independent instruments, with some "outlying" variants having an observed association with the outcome which is substantially different to that expected given their association with the exposure. If the instrument is valid, it should have an effect on the outcome which is proportional to the effect on exposure.

        <p>While random variation could result in different effects estimated by the individual variants, the presence of heterogeneity in the causal effect estimated by individual SNPs could also indicate horizontal pleiotropy. The simplest method of accounting for this is with the use of a random effects IVW meta-analysis model [23]. However, this approach can only be used where horizontal pleiotropy is balanced (i.e. where the random effects have zero weighted mean) [26]. The first method developed for assessing and counteracting the extent of unbalanced or directional pleiotropy was the application of the Egger regression technique to MR analysis [56]. This approach, first introduced in the context of small study bias within meta-analysis, allows the intercept of the weighted linear regression line of the SNP-outcome on the SNP-exposure association to vary freely (Figure 8). Directional pleiotropy can be tested by assessing the extent to which the intercept deviates when it is not constrained to the origin (as in IVW), and the gradient of the line can be used to provide a causal estimate in the presence of directional pleiotropy using the MR Egger approach. It is important to report both estimates.While random variation could result in different effects estimated by the individual variants, the presence of heterogeneity in the causal effect estimated by individual SNPs could also indicate horizontal pleiotropy.

        <p>For example, if investigating the effect of body mass index on cardiovascular disease (CVD), we would assume that a kg/m 2 increase in BMI would elevate risk of CVD irrespective of the person's gender or age. The homogeneity assumption can also be replaced by imposing monotonicity, which assumes that an increase in the number of risk alleles will never lower the likelihood of exposure [73] (e.g. a BMI genetic risk score should not increase BMI for some individuals and decrease it for others). This allows for an estimation of a local average treatment effect (LATE) among those individuals whose exposure level is affected by their genotype. Such assumptions must be made in order for the effect estimate obtained from any MR analysis to be interpreted as the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome. While they cannot be explicitly tested, the assumptions can be interrogated through various means. One possibility is to estimate causal effects in different subpopulations and to evaluate whether the estimated effects differ. Alternatively, as non-homogeneity in the genetic variant -exposure association would lead to non-homogeneity in the genetic variant -outcome association, evaluating the variance of exposure and outcome groups by genotype would provide a test for the presence and degree of violation of this assumption [74]. Large GWAS allow variance to be characterized well, and so may be interrogated to investigate this [75].For example, if investigating the effect of body mass index on cardiovascular disease (CVD), we would assume that a kg/m 2 increase in BMI would elevate risk of CVD irrespective of the person's gender or age.

        <p>An instance where it is difficult to obtain relevant treatment effects from MR estimates is in the presence of binary exposures [76]. As the assumptions of homogeneity and monotonicity are less likely to hold when interpreting causal estimates with binary exposures using MR, it is often simpler to report on the existence and direction (rather than the magnitude) of the causal effect [76]. If these assumptions can be made, there are options for causal estimation with a binary exposure which allow estimates to be converted onto a more clinically meaningful scale. In one-sample data with timed events, it is possible to estimate the causal effect of a binary exposure. However, when conducting twosample MR, the causal effect estimates should be interpreted as reflecting the effects of the genetic liability to the exposure, rather than the exposure itself [77].An instance where it is difficult to obtain relevant treatment effects from MR estimates is in the presence of binary exposures [76].

While it is empirically possible to calculate causal estimates in a similar manner to continuous variables, for example with use of the log odds scale, the MR effect estimate may only be approximate in the case of a binary outcome [79]. This is because the "non-collapsibility" of odds ratios means that these estimates may not be constant across strata, and so cannot be used to obtain a precise causal effect [80]. Alternatively, analyses can be conducted on the risk difference scale, which reduces the risk of bias due to noncollapsibility.Interpretation of causal effects on binary outcomes is also challenging [78].

        <p>As mentioned, while sensitivity analyses may relax some of the core IV assumptions, e.g. exclusion restriction in the case of pleiotropy-robust methods, they impose their own set of (albeit weaker) assumptions (Table 5). Two-sample MR also imposes additional assumptions to the one-sample MR approach, including exchangeability of the two samples (i.e. whether they are both drawn from the same underlying population), as well as the assumption that the two samples are non-overlapping [81].As mentioned, while sensitivity analyses may relax some of the core IV assumptions, e.g. exclusion restriction in the case of pleiotropy-robust methods, they impose their own set of (albeit weaker) assumptions (Table 5).

        <p>In particular, it is this random allocation of genetic variants from parents to offspring which can be viewed as analogous to an RCT [3]. Often this analogy is useful, particularly when it is possible to scale causal effect estimates to that of interventions, for example in the case of (retrospectively) predicting the null effect of selenium on risk of prostate cancer using MR (RR 1.01 (95% CI 0.89, 1.13) per 114 ug/L in MR vs RR 1.04 (95% CI 0.91, 1.19) per 114 ug/L in RCT) [83]. However, the analogy is not perfect since RCTs typically involve interventions of short duration, whereas an individuals' genotype could reflect lifelong exposures, time-dependent or critical period effects, as well as potential developmental compensation that may arise over time [1,84]. Causal estimates obtained from MR analyses may therefore differ in magnitude to those seen or anticipated in an RCT, although can also be useful in providing added value regarding lifecourse effects, for example of knowledge that cholesterol lowering in earlier life is likely to be important for preventing cardiovascular disease [85]. In addition, in MR analysis conducted at a population-rather than family-level, the analogy is only approximate, as described below.In particular, it is this random allocation of genetic variants from parents to offspring which can be viewed as analogous to an RCT [3].

        <p>"Genetic variants are not influenced by confounding factors" Under Mendel's laws of segregation and independent assortment, it is assumed that genetic variants should be inherited independently of other genetic and environmental factors. While population-level genetic variants are typically much less associated with many potential confounders than directly measured exposures [12], the random inheritance of genetic variants from parents to offspring does not guarantee that genetic variants and confounders will be independent in samples of unrelated individuals. For example, an obvious violation of this is created due to population stratification which can introduce confounding of genotype-disease associations by factors related to subpopulation group membership within the overall population. This might occur even within groups of relatively homogeneous ancestry, due to underlying substructure [86,87], or also at the family level, for example due to assortative mating [88]. One potential violation of the second IV assumption is that of "dynastic" or "genetic nurture" effects, where parental genotypes affect the offspring via the environment that parents create for their offspring by affecting the parental phenotype [89]. As a result, a genetic instrument in the offspring will be correlated with the environment created by the parents. One solution to this problem is to perform MR analysis between siblings who have a shared family background and whose genotype differences will not be confounded by parental or family factors (within-family MR) [89,90]. In the initial presentation of MR it was suggested that the most robust form would be within families [1] and with increasing sources of data for family-based studies, this approach offers potential for elucidating causal effects for those traits which are most likely to be influenced by dynastic effects (e.g. socio-economic factors)."Genetic variants are not influenced by confounding factors" Under Mendel's laws of segregation and independent assortment, it is assumed that genetic variants should be inherited independently of other genetic and environmental factors.

        <p>Since germline genotypes are fixed at conception, they cannot be influenced by reverse causation, and therefore it is often claimed that reverse causation is not an issue for MR. While this is true, a scenario where reverse causation might pose a problem for MR is where there are bidirectional effects between two traits (X and Y) and where the genetic instruments GX and GY are not well characterized [10] (Table 4). If trait X influences trait Y, then a GWAS with adequate statistical power will identify a genetic variant with its primary influence of trait X as being associated with trait Y (for example the CHRNA5 variant related to smoking intensity has been identified at genome-wide significance in relation to lung cancer [98]). This will lead to spurious conclusions if this variant were then used as a genetic instrument for trait Y (e.g. that lung cancer causes smoking), i.e. by mis-specifying the primary phenotype. One way to minimize this problem is to ensure that the two instruments are independent of each other by excluding the genetic variants which they have in common. However, this may also increase the risk of type II error if variants are excluded from the genetic instruments which reflect vertical pleiotropy (e.g. if the CHRNA5 variant were removed from both the smoking and lung cancer instruments). Alternatively, for a two-sample MR analysis with a binary outcome, it may be possible to investigate the number of "cases" of the outcome in the sample used to run the exposure GWAS. Here a low prevalence of the outcome in the exposure sample would minimize risk of such a reverse signal. Another approach which can be used in this context is the Steiger method applied to MR [99]. This has been developed to investigate whether the genetic variants being used to instrument trait X are more strongly correlated with trait Y than X, in which case they will be excluded from the instrument for X.Since germline genotypes are fixed at conception, they cannot be influenced by reverse causation, and therefore it is often claimed that reverse causation is not an issue for MR.

        <p>One way in which this kind of reverse causation can be leveraged within an MR study is with the notion of "reverse MR" [100]. Here a disease-associated genetic risk score would be expected to associate with causes of the disease e.g. a genetic risk score for lung cancer would be associated with smoking because the CHRNA5 variant is included in the score. If the outcome of interest cannot plausibly cause the exposure being considered (for example in a subgroup where the outcome is not prevalent, e.g. among young study participants in the case of lung cancer), then this situation can be used to confirm causal exposures. This principle has been applied to investigate perturbations in proteins and metabolites in relation to later cardiometabolic disease risk [101,102]. However, alternative scenarios such as pleiotropy, a causal effect of disease liability, or early stages of disease which influence the exposure (e.g. pre-diagnostic cholesterol lowering in cancer [103]) also need to be considered.One way in which this kind of reverse causation can be leveraged within an MR study is with the notion of "reverse MR" [100].

        <p>The use of genetic variants may sometimes lead to counterintuitive results. For example, while it would be expected that longer term IL-6 levels would elevate the risk of CHD [104], genetic variation in the IL-6 receptor which increases circulating IL-6 levels has actually been found to decrease risk of CHD [31]. This can be explained since carriers of this polymorphism exhibiting higher circulating IL-6 levels but reduced membrane-bound IL-6, with reduced IL-6 signaling, which in turn reduces risk of CHD [31]. Similarly, if genetic polymorphisms are associated with multiple aspects of a single trait, for example variation in CHRNA5 which is associated with different dimensions of smoking behavior (e.g. number of puffs per cigarette, depth of inhalation) [105], this can also lead to problems of the interpretation of causal effects for any particular dimension of the trait.The use of genetic variants may sometimes lead to counterintuitive results.

        <p>A further limitation posed by a lack of understanding of genetic variants poses is that of "contamination" of the instrument by variants associated with traits "upstream" of the trait of interest, leading to misspecification of the primary phenotype. This is a particular concern as GWAS sample sizes increase, since it increases the power to detect genetic variants which act indirectly on the trait of interest. For example, genetic variants with a primary influence on BMI appear among the top hits in GWAS of Creactive protein [106], but should not be used as instruments for CRP levels. This has already been discussed within the context of a bidirectional relationship, where genetic variants which influence the exposure through reverse cause may be picked up. In addition, it may re-introduce confounding if confounders are picked up as genetic variants for the exposure. For example, genetic variants identified in relation to drinking behavior have been found to be strongly related to socio-economic factors [107].A further limitation posed by a lack of understanding of genetic variants poses is that of "contamination" of the instrument by variants associated with traits "upstream" of the trait of interest, leading to misspecification of the primary phenotype.

        <p>This may lead to confounding in MR studies if the genetic variants used to instrument the exposure (here drinking behavior) are primarily associated with factors upstream of the exposure (e.g. educational attainment) and may explain the opposite genetic correlations observed between alcohol quantity and intake frequency (which are differentially associated with educational attainment) in relation to various health outcomes in a recent study [108]. Multivariable MR can be used in this instance to estimate the "true" effect of the phenotype being investigated, for example accounting for educational attainment to estimate direct effects of drinking behaviour, but this requires knowing the structure of the underlying phenotypes.This may lead to confounding in MR studies if the genetic variants used to instrument the exposure (here drinking behavior) are primarily associated with factors upstream of the exposure (e.g. educational attainment) and may explain the opposite genetic correlations observed between alcohol quantity and intake frequency (which are differentially associated with educational attainment) in relation to various health outcomes in a recent study [108].

        <p>While it is not necessary that a genetic variant used to instrument a modifiable exposure of interest in MR should be the causal variant for that trait, it is important to assess whether multiple SNPs used in the instrument are likely to be tagging the same causal variant. This is because including correlated variants will typically lead to erroneous precision in the causal estimate obtained. LD-based clumping or pruning can be used to exclude variants in strong LD, which can ensure independence of the instruments. Another approach is to use a weighted generalized linear regression method which takes into account correlation of multiple non-independent SNPs [111]. This approach is particularly useful when assessing causality of molecular phenotypes (e.g. DNA methylation, gene expression, protein levels), which are often characterized by few independent instruments in cis (genetic variants located close to the target locus/gene). A method which is often utilized in conjunction with MR when there is, for example, one independent variant to instrument a molecular trait in cis, is the approach of genetic colocalization mentioned previously.

        <p>The notion of canalization or developmental compensation is a potential limitation of MR for which there is no simple empirical assessment [1]. It refers to the buffering of genetic effects during development which may bias MR estimates and vitiate gene-environment equivalence, i.e. that perturbations caused by genotype have the same downstream effects as if they were caused by modifiable exposures. Canalization is a widespread phenomenon in gene knockout studies [1], although it is currently unclear whether the generally small phenotypic differences induced by common functional polymorphisms are sufficient to induce compensatory responses. A related consideration is the oftenstated assumption that genetic variants have lifelong effects, which has been used previously to explain large point estimates obtained from MR compared with other epidemiological approaches [120]. There are clear examples of MR where exposures are time limited, and where canalization is therefore less likely to be an issue. For example, when assessing causal effects of exposures in utero, the maternal genetic variants being used as instruments will only have an effect on the offspring via mechanisms during the intrauterine period [115], and when assessing causal effects of exposures which occur predominantly in adulthood (e.g. alcohol consumption, childbearing), the genetic variants will only have an effect after the developmental stage where canalization is most likely to occur.The notion of canalization or developmental compensation is a potential limitation of MR for which there is no simple empirical assessment [1].

New GWAS studies have started to reveal genetic variants with distinct timing effects [122], which may be leveraged to investigate timing-varying effects in an MR context. For example, a recent multivariable MR study used genetic variants with distinct effects on body size in childhood and adulthood to separate the causal effects of this trait at more than one stage of the lifecourse on risk of chronic disease [123].While it is often difficult to model such time-varying effects in MR, they can bias causal estimates [121] and may have implications for determining optimal timing of interventions.

        <p>To date, the majority of GWAS have sought to identify genetic variants associated with risk of disease occurrence. Such variants are informative for disease prevention, but not necessarily for treatment aimed at influencing disease progression since the same genetic factors will not necessarily influence both disease onset and progression of the disease [124,125]. In 2017, just 8% of genetic association hits in the GWAS Catalog had attempted to identify variants associated with disease progression or severity, and most with modest sample size [125]. Nonetheless, an increasing number of progression GWAS are being carried out, in studies such as the Genetics and Subsequent Coronary Heart Disease consortium (GENIUS-CHD; coronary heart disease, n&gt;270k cases) [126], the Breast Cancer Association Consortium insights into the timing of drug initiation [120,129]. However, this typically requires the availability of prospective datasets of target populations with genetic data available [130].To date, the majority of GWAS have sought to identify genetic variants associated with risk of disease occurrence.

        <p>A novel application of MR has recently been proposed which may enhance the value of feasibility studies of interventions [142]. This approaches uses MR to predict causal effect of these interventions on long-term clinical outcomes via short-term intermediate biomarkers. Feasibility trials are small-scale studies which aim to assess the practicality and acceptability of implementing an intervention in a clinical setting. These are not usually powered to evaluate effects on clinical outcomes and are not typically followed up for enough time to assess long-term outcomes. However, intermediate measures may be collected which can serve as surrogate endpoints in such studies. These measures may lie on the causal pathway to clinical outcomes and MR can be used in this context to appraise the causal effect of those intermediate measures altered by the intervention on long-term outcomes, using a larger study base to the feasibility study in question to bolster power. While these intermediate biomarkers serve as surrogate endpoints, which are well known to have limitations [143], the advantage of using MR in this context is that it is possible to explore both expected and unanticipated effects of manipulating an intermediate trait on a range of outcomes, including relatively rare ones, and with larger sample sizes. Furthermore, the approach may be used to uncover other causal intermediates which could validate choice of surrogate markers for use in future feasibility studies.A novel application of MR has recently been proposed which may enhance the value of feasibility studies of interventions [142].

        <p>Building on the success of GWAS and the availability of cost-effective and robust technologies is the scaling up of other 'omic technologies within population health. This is largely concerned with understanding how gene regulatory mechanisms or gene products influence health-related outcomes and is useful for investigating the molecular pathways that may underpin causal effects. In particular, such 'omic measures are influenced by many environmental and endogenous factors and so can be considered as intermediate phenotypes through which causal effects may be investigated [10].Building on the success of GWAS and the availability of cost-effective and robust technologies is the scaling up of other 'omic technologies within population health.

        <p>Of particular utility are large-scale 'omic scans for formulating novel hypotheses on biological processes underpinning complex traits and diseases. However, in contrast to germline genetic variation, 'omic signatures are largely phenotypic, and are therefore subject to the same potential problems of confounding and reverse causation which afflict conventional epidemiology [144]. MR is being increasingly applied to elucidate causality for a range of molecular data, including epigenetics, transcriptomics, gene expression, metabolomics and proteomics [145]. For this, approaches such as two-step, network and multivariable MR are of particular utility for determining whether these markers lie on the causal pathway between risk factors and disease (Table 4). Such approaches are being applied in increasingly complex and innovative ways, to consider the causal nature of a large number of molecular markers [146], integrating several types of 'omics data to evaluate molecular pathways [147], as well as considering the tissue-specific nature of causal effects [148].Of particular utility are large-scale 'omic scans for formulating novel hypotheses on biological processes underpinning complex traits and diseases.

        <p>Approximately two thirds of all previous GWAS have been performed in individuals of European ancestry [149]. Differences in allele frequencies and LD patterns between populations threaten the validity of identified genetic variants and therefore transferability of MR findings to other populations [149,150]. While restricting GWAS and MR analysis to more homogeneous ancestries can help to reduce the threat of population stratification, other approaches such as Bayesian mixture model analysis can be taken to overcome this limitation while ensuring greater diversity in genetic studies [25]. Greater diversity is important as it allows for improved causal inference of risk factors and the clinical translation of genetic findings in other ethnic groups. Furthermore, allowing for diversity in MR studies can help to identify genetic variants which are typically rare in Europeans, where more common variation in other ethnic groups can bolster power in MR for determining causal effects [35,151]. Some large-scale non-European biobanks are available for genetic analysis (Table 2), with a recent GWAS of ~200,000 individuals in Biobank Japan identifying a number of novel loci important for elucidating biology in the East Asian population [152].Approximately two thirds of all previous GWAS have been performed in individuals of European ancestry [149].

        <p>A number of methodological extensions of the original MR approach have been discussed throughout this review and an increasing number are being developed. In particular, several recently developed whole-genome based approaches, including Genetic Instrumental Variable regression (GIV) [153] and Causal Analysis Using Summary Effect estimates (CAUSE) [28], are seemingly less vulnerable to environmental confounders that are correlated with genes than many of the methods already described (Figures 3 and4). While the previously outlined methods are specifically designed to account for horizontal pleiotropy of the genetic instruments, GIV and CAUSE make use of full GWAS data to also account for other sources of bias. For example, if the primary phenotype has been mis-specified, the Instrument Strength Independent of Direct Effect (InSIDE) assumption of the MR Egger sensitivity analysis is likely to be violated, and so the CAUSE method may be used as an additional test to determine the presence of correlated pleiotropy in this instance.A number of methodological extensions of the original MR approach have been discussed throughout this review and an increasing number are being developed.

        <p>While the range of methods now available allows for rigorous analysis and robust causal inference to be made, it can be difficult to navigate the various approaches and appraise their relative strengths and limitations. However, it has been emphasized that the best choice of method can often be context specific [154]. More generally, applying a number of approaches each with orthogonal biases can be helpful in "triangulating" evidence if the estimates obtained from the approaches converge on a similar causal estimate [109].While the range of methods now available allows for rigorous analysis and robust causal inference to be made, it can be difficult to navigate the various approaches and appraise their relative strengths and limitations.

        <p>The development of bioinformatic platforms and software supports the systematic application of MR [22,47]. There is scope to automate MR analyses in order to evaluate a multitude of causal relationships in a time-efficient manner. This can aid in the accelerated identification, prioritization and evaluation of intervention targets, for example through phenome-wide association studies (MR-PhEWAS) [155,156], and the examination of causality in increasingly complex networks with the integration of molecular data [157]. However, limitations of these agnostic approaches include the multiple testing burden imposed as well as the possibility of false positives, which require careful follow-up in terms of evaluating patterns of bias and ensuring robustness of findings to the various assumptions. While machine learning and Bayesian model algorithms have been developed to help select the most appropriate model for evaluation [23,110,[157][158][159], users should be careful that the use of automation and data repositories do not trivialize the analysis being conducted and interpretation of results [160].The development of bioinformatic platforms and software supports the systematic application of MR [22,47].

        <p>The relative ease at which MR analysis can now be performed can also threaten the design, conduct and reporting of the approach. This may lead to spurious and/or non-reproducible results and may encourage data fishing or the selective cherry-picking of findings, which can lead to study bias in the literature. Guidelines which describe and emphasize the importance of analytical choice considerations and appraise the transparency of MR reporting should help to maintain and improve the quality of MR studies being performed [70,161,162].

In particular, when a group of participants are selected based on certain characteristics (e.g. presence of disease), this will introduce a spurious association between independent risk factors influencing selection which will then distort the relationships between each factor and disease progression (Figure 5).

        <p>While RCTs remain the gold standard approach for testing the efficacy and safety of a new drug, RCTs can be complemented by MR in terms of prioritizing drug targets, predicting the outcome of trials and optimizing trial design [129,130]. Human genetic evidence is a strong predictor of drug success [131] and MR studies of proteins and metabolites are becoming fundamental in drug discovery and development [129,130,132,133]. In particular, cis-acting variants may serve as genetic proxies for protein drug targets, and selection of such variants may be optimized to evaluate the potential causal relationships between those drug targets and a range of diseases [134][135][136]. A promising application of MR is in the prioritization of targets for disease prevention, for example revealing the role of PCKS9 inhibitors for reducing LDL cholesterol [137], as well as de-prioritizing interventions based on null results from MR, for example showing that CRP concentration is unlikely to be a causal factor in CHD [138]. MR can also indicate potential side effects of drugs, including the elevated risk of type 2 diabetes among some lipid-lowering drugs [137], which has also been shown in the case of statin trials [139]. It has also been used to identify potential re-purposing opportunities of existing drugs [140]. Most recently, genetic variation in IL6R has been associated with lower risk of hospitalization from COVID-19, which is in line with findings from IL6-receptor therapeutic inhibition trials [141].

        <p>This paper provides an overarching summary of the Mendelian randomization approach, which uses genetic variants reliably related to modifiable exposures to provide a more robust understanding of the influence of these exposures on disease-relevant outcomes. The development of computational tools and availability of large GWAS datasets has enabled the automation of MR analyses for evaluating a multitude of causal relationships in a time-efficient manner, predominantly via the two-sample MR approach. This has led to the rapid expansion of MR publications and accelerating the identification, prioritization and evaluation of intervention targets, the detection of novel causal relationships and the integration of molecular data to examine causality in increasingly complex networks. However, as MR is increasingly easy to implement, it may lead to the proliferation of poorly thought-out and conducted studies. It is therefore important that anyone applying the approach is well versed in its assumptions and limitations. We have discussed the current state of the field, highlighting current best practice methodology, methods of assessing the MR assumptions, attempts to overcome potential pitfalls, and some exciting future prospects. Several of the other papers in this collection elaborate on some of the novel methodological approaches, including multivariable MR and the use of MR for assessing mediation [163], polygenic MR methods for assessing pleiotropy [23], as well as within-family MR methods [69].This paper provides an overarching summary of the Mendelian randomization approach, which uses genetic variants reliably related to modifiable exposures to provide a more robust understanding of the influence of these exposures on disease-relevant outcomes.
