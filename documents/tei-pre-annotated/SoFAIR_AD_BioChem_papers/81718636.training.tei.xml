        <p>We examined expression levels of lncRNA CRNDE and miR-181a-5p in 64 cases of CRC tissues and cell lines by qRT-PCR. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays were performed to examine the effect of CRNDE and miR-181a-5p on proliferation and chemoresistance of CRC cells. Using fluorescence reporter and western blot assays, we also explored the possible mechanisms of CRNDE in CRC cells. Results: In this study, we found that the expression levels of the CRNDE were upregulated in CRC clinical tissue samples. We identified microRNA miR-181a-5p as an inhibitory target of CRNDE. Both CRNDE knockdown and miR-181a-5p overexpression in CRC cell lines led to inhibited cell proliferation and reduced chemoresistance. We also determined that β-catenin and TCF4 were inhibitory targets of miR-181a-5p, and that Wnt/β-catenin signaling was inhibited by both CRNDE knockdown and miR-181a-5p overexpression. Significantly, we found that the repression of cell proliferation, the reduction of chemoresistance, and the inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling induced by CRNDE knockdown would require the increased expression of miR-181a-5p.We examined expression levels of lncRNA CRNDE and miR-181a-5p in 64 cases of CRC tissues and cell lines by qRT-PCR.

        <p>With more than 600,000 mortalities each year, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed type of cancer worldwide [1,2]. Like many other cancer types, the development of CRC is a process characterized by multiple stages and involves accumulation of both genetic and epigenetic changes [3]. An extensive body of recent research has revealed that the initiation and progression of CRC are regulated by a number of cellular signaling pathways, including the TGFβ/SMAD pathway, the p53 pathway, the EGFR/MAPK pathway, the PI3K-Akt pathway, and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway [4]. Recently, mechanisms involving noncoding RNAs have also been implicated in the development of CRC [5][6][7][8].With more than 600,000 mortalities each year, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed type of cancer worldwide [1,2].

        <p>Based on size, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) can be categorized into small ncRNAs (&lt;200 nt) and long ncRNAs (&gt;200 nt). Small ncRNAs, including microRNAs, have been demonstrated to function primarily via regulating gene expression, including modulating mRNA stability and repressing protein translation [9]. A number of microRNAs were found to act as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes by previous reports [10][11][12]. Characterized by lack of cross species conservation [13,14], the mechanism of action for long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) is poorly understood. However, rapidly accumulating evidence has consistently indicated that lncRNAs play essential roles in a variety of cellular processes, and therefore may contribute to the development of cancer and other human diseases [15,16].Based on size, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) can be categorized into small ncRNAs (&lt;200 nt) and long ncRNAs (&gt;200 nt).

        <p>The lncRNA Colorectal Neoplasia Differentially Expressed (CRNDE) is transcribed from chromosome 16 on the strand opposite to the adjacent IRX5 gene [17]. The expression levels of CRNDE were originally found to be increased in CRC [17], and were also upregulated in a number of solid and hematopoietic cancer types, including liver [18], pancreatic [19], ovarian [20], kidney cancer [21], glioma [22], and leukemia [23]. Besides cancer progression, the CRNDE gene also participated in the regulation of neuronal differentiation, gametogenesis and other developmental processes [24]. In addition, the mouse ortholog of CRDNE was demonstrated to be involved in the maintenance of cellular pluripotency [25]. Although there was some preliminary evidence that CRNDE could interact with chromatin-modifying complexes to affect epigenetic regulation of gene expression [26], the mechanism by which CRNDE plays its role, particularly in the development of CRC, has not yet been elucidated.The lncRNA Colorectal Neoplasia Differentially Expressed (CRNDE) is transcribed from chromosome 16 on the strand opposite to the adjacent IRX5 gene [17].

        <p>In the present study, we found that the expression levels of the lncRNA CRNDE were upregulated in CRC clinical tissue samples. We identified microRNA miR-181a-5p as a target for CRNDE. The expression of miR-181a-5p was inhibited by CRNDE. Knockdown of CRNDE and overexpression of miR-181a-5p in CRC cell lines both led to inhibited cell proliferation and reduced chemoresistance. We also determined that β-catenin and TCF4 were inhibitory targets of miR-181a-5p, and that Wnt/β-catenin signaling was inhibited by both CRNDE knockdown and miR-181a-5p overexpression. Significantly, we found that the repression of cell proliferation, the reduction of chemoresistance, and the inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CRC cells induced by CRNDE knockdown all required the activity of miR-181a-5p.

        <p>In order to investigate the relevance of lncRNA CRNDE in CRC development, we first sought to determine the levels of CRNDE expression form TCGA database. As shown in Fig. 1a, expression of CRNDE was significantly upregulated in CRC tissues (P &lt; 0.001). We also complied gene expression data from the GSO/GDS4385 database, and confirmed that the expression levels of CRNDE were increased in CRC tissue (Fig. 1b, P &lt; 0.001). Next, CRNDE expression was examined by qRT-PCR on samples from 64 clinical CRC patients compared to adjacent normal tissue and elevated CRNDE expression was observed (Fig. 1c, P &lt; 0.001). We then performed qRT-PCR to analyze CRNDE expression in six CRC cell lines (Caco2, HT29, HCT15, HCT116, SW620 and SW480). As compared to 3 normal CRC sample, overexpressed levels of CRNDE expression was seen in all CRC cell line (Fig. 1d). Furthermore, we performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of the association between CRNDE expression and the survival in 64 clinical CRC patients. As shown in Fig. 1e, high expression of CRNDE significantly shorterned CRC patient survival time. We next detected CRNDE location by RNA FISH assays and found nuclear location of CRNDE in CRC cells (Additional file 1). These results were consistent with previous findings in another cohort of patients [17], and suggested that CRNDE might be involved in the regulation of CRC development.In order to investigate the relevance of lncRNA CRNDE in CRC development, we first sought to determine the levels of CRNDE expression form TCGA database.

        <p>To determine the mechanism of action for CRNDE in CRC development, we identified miR-181a-5p as a potential target of CRNDE with LncBase Predicted v.2 of 
            <rs type="software">DIANA</rs> tools. There are two putative binding sites of CRNDE at the regions of 43-35 and 578-583 on miR-181a-5p (Fig. 2a). We generated wild type CRNDE luciferase plasmids containing potential miR-181a-5p binding sites and their mutant of each site. These plasmids was co-transfected with miR-181a-5p into HEK293T cells, respectively, and then luciferase assays were performed. As shown in Fig. 2b, miR-181a-5p could reduce wild type and mutant-2 CRNDE luciferase activity. But it can't affect mutant-1 activity. The results indicated that miR-181a-5p binds transcript position (43-50) of CRNDE. In tissue samples from 64 clinical CRC patients, we determined that the expression levels of miR-181a-5p were significantly downregulated (Fig. 2c), a trend opposite to that of CRNDE. To examine whether miR-181a-5p was indeed a target of CRNDE, we first knocked down CRNDE expression in two independent CRC cell lines, HCT116 and SW480 cells, by siRNA transfection. The efficacy of knockdown was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2d). In both CRNDE knockdown cell lines, we observed elevated expression levels of miR-181a-5p (Fig. 2e). We next increased wild type and mutant CRNDE expression in CRC cell lines (Fig. 2f ), we found that the expression levels of miR-181a-5p were significantly inhibited by wild type CRNDE but not by mutant (Fig. 2g). Importantly, overexpression (Additional file 2a) or knockdown (Additional file 2b) of miR-181a-5p did not cause any change in the expression levels of CRNDE (Additional file 2c and d), indicating that miR-181a-5p was downstream of CRNDE. To further investigate whether CRNDE and miR-181a-5p binding together, we performed pull-down assays. As shown in Fig. 2h, CRNDE was confirmed binding with miR-181a-5p and this binding was inhibited by miR-181a-5p inhibitor. Mutation of CRNDE binding sequence with miR-181a-5p inhibited miR-181a-5p precipitation. The inhibitory regulation of miR-181a-5p by CRNDE was further corroborated by the analysis of clinical samples. We also observed inverse correlation between the expression levels of CRNDE and miR-181a-5p in CRC tissue samples (Fig. 2i, r = -0.632, P &lt; 0.001). Taken together, our data supported that miR-181a-5p was an inhibitory target of CRNDE in both CRC cells and tissue samples.

        <p>To investigate the function of CRNDE on CRC cell proliferation, we first knocked down the expression of CRNDE in two CRC cell lines, HCT116 and SW480 cells. We then performed MTT cell proliferation assay on these cells. We found that knockdown of CRNDE in both cell lines significantly inhibited cell proliferation (Fig. 3a). Significantly, overexpression of miR-181a-5p in both HCT116 and SW480 cells was able to recapitulate the inhibitory effects on cell proliferation conferred by CRNDE knockdown (Fig. 3b). In contrast, CRNDE overexpression and miR-181a-5p knockdown both led to increased cell proliferation in CRC cells (Additional file 3a and b). We also performed additional assays to confirm the regulation of cell proliferation by CRNDE and miR-181a-5p. In crystal violet staining assay, colony formation of CRC cells was inhibited by knockdown of CRNDE (Fig. 3c) and by overexpression of miR-181a-5p (Fig. 3d). Consistently, we observed significantly less actively divided cells in BrdU assay with CRNDE knockdown (Fig. 3e) and miR-181a-5p overexpression (Fig. 3f ). These data collectively indicated that CRNDE promoted CRC cell proliferation.To investigate the function of CRNDE on CRC cell proliferation, we first knocked down the expression of CRNDE in two CRC cell lines, HCT116 and SW480 cells.

        <p>As previous research demonstrated that noncoding RNAs are involved in the chemoresistance of cancer cells [28], we hypothesized that CRNDE and miR-181a-5p could also regulate the chemoresistance of CRC cells. To test this hypothesis, we treated CRNDE knockdown or miR-181a-5p overexpressing CRC cells with an increasing serial of concentrations of 5-Fu. As expected, 5-Fu led to cell growth inhibition in a dose-dependent manner. We found that CRNDE knockdown (Fig. 4a) and miR-181a-5p overexpression (Fig. 4b) appeared to increase the sensitivity of CRC cells to 5-Fu treatment and therefore further inhibited cell growth. Conversely, CRNDE overexpression (Additional file 4a) and miR-181a-5p knockdown (Additional file 4b) resulted in decreased 5-Fu sensitivity, and partially alleviate the growth inhibition of CRC cells induced by 5-Fu treatment. These results were further confirmed by the treatment of another chemotherapy drug Oxa. Consistently, CRNDE knockdown (Fig. 4c) and miR-181a-5p overexpression (Fig. 4d) led to increased sensitivity of CRC cells to Oxa treatment, and CRNDE overexpression (Additional file 4c) and miR-181a-5p knockdown (Additional file 4d) led to decreased Oxa sensitivity of CRC cells.

        <p>We next used publicly available algorithms (
            <rs type="software">DIANA</rs> TOOLS and microRNA.org) to identify potential targets of miR-181a-5p. From TarBase v7.0 of DIANA TOOLS [29], we noticed that intracellular signal transducer βcatenin and transcriptional factor TCF4 in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway were downregulated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) after miR-181a-5p transfection (Fig. 5a). We then sought to confirm this prediction in the context of CRC cells. Based on the predicted binding sites of miR-181a-5p, we generated βcatenin and TCF4 3′-UTR wild type (WT) and mutant (MUT) luciferase reporter plasmids (Fig. 5b). We then performed luciferase reporter assays by co-transfecting luciferase reporter plasmids with miR-181a-5p. We found that the overexpression of miR-181a-5p decreased the luciferase activity driven by the wild type 3′-UTRs of both β-catenin and TCF4, but caused no change in the luciferase activity driven by the mutant 3′-UTRs of both βcatenin and TCF4 (Fig. 5c). In contrast, knockdown of miR-181a-5p increased the luciferase activity driven by the wild type 3′-UTRs of both β-catenin and TCF4, but not by the mutant 3′-UTRs of both β-catenin and TCF4 (Additional file 5a). Furthermore, the protein levels of both β-catenin and TCF4 in CRC cells were reduced by miR-181a-5p overexpression (Fig. 5d), and were increased by miR-181a-5p knockdown (Additional file 5b). The inhibition of β-catenin and TCF4 by miR-181a-5p was also confirmed in clinical samples. In 64 CRC tissue samples, we were able to establish inverse correlation between the expression levels of miR-181a-5p and β-catenin (r = -0.562, P &lt; 0.001), and between those of miR-181a-5p and TCF4 (r = -0.518, P &lt; 0.001) (Fig. 5e). Since β-catenin and TCF4 are important components the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, we next sought to determine whether miR-181a-5p could affect the activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. With TOP/FOP luciferase activity assay, we found that overexpression of miR-181a-5p significantly inhibited the activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Fig. 5f), and that knockdown of miR-181a-5p stimulated the activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Additional file 5c). Finally, we found that the levels of downstream target genes of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, including Cyclin D1 and Axin2, were substantially decreased by miR-181a-5p overexpression in CRC cells (Fig. 5g).

        <p>Our previous results demonstrated that CRNDE knockdown and miR-181a-5p overexpression led to inhibition of CRC cell proliferation and chemoresistance. Since CRNDE inhibited miR-181a-5p expression, and miR-181a-5p inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling, it is possible that the inhibition of CRC cell proliferation and chemoresistance induced by CRNDE knockdown was due to increased miR-181a-5p expression and consequent inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. To test this Fig. 5 MiR-181a-5p targets β-catenin/TCF4 and inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling. a Expression levels of β-catenin and TCF4 shown as downregulated in HUVEC overexpressing miR-181a-5p from TarBase v7.0 database of DIANA TOOLS. b Schematic illustration of the predicted miR-181a-5p binding sites with the 3′-UTR of β-catenin and TCF4. c Luciferase activity assay performed in HEK293 cells co-transfected with miR-181a-5p and luciferase reporter plasmids driven by either wild type (WT) or mutant (MUT) 3′-UTR of β-catenin and TCF4 that was devoid of miR-181a-5p binding activity. d The protein levels of βcatenin and TCF4 as determined by Western blot analysis in HCT116 and SW480 cells transfected with miR-181a-5p or miR-control. e Inverse correlation between the expression levels of miR-181a-5p and those of β-catenin (r = -0.562, P &lt; 0.001), and between the expression levels of miR-181a-5p and those of TCF4 (r = -0.518, P &lt; 0.001) in 64 CRC samples. f TOP/FOP luciferase activity in HCT116 and SW480 cells transfected with miR-181a-5p or a miR-control. g The protein levels of Cyclin D1 and Axin2 as determined by Western blot analysis in HCT116 and SW480 cells transfected with miR-181a-5p or miR-control. *P &lt; 0.05 we knocked down β-catenin or TCF4, respectively, and performed MTT cell proliferation assays in the presence of 5-Fu or Oxa. As showed in Additional file 6, inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling resulted in CRC cell chemoresistance. We next concomitantly knocked down the expression of miR-181a-5p in CRNDE knockdown CRC cells. Significantly, while CRNDE knockdown led to significantly inhibited CRC cell proliferation, simultaneous miR-181a-5p knockdown completely reversed the inhibition of cell proliferation (Fig. 6a), indicating that the increased levels of miR-181a-5p expression were essential for the cell proliferation inhibition induced by CRNDE knockdown.Our previous results demonstrated that CRNDE knockdown and miR-181a-5p overexpression led to inhibition of CRC cell proliferation and chemoresistance.

To test this Fig. 5 MiR-181a-5p targets β-catenin/TCF4 and inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling. a Expression levels of β-catenin and TCF4 shown as downregulated in HUVEC overexpressing miR-181a-5p from TarBase v7.0 database of DIANA TOOLS. b Schematic illustration of the predicted miR-181a-5p binding sites with the 3′-UTR of β-catenin and TCF4. c Luciferase activity assay performed in HEK293 cells co-transfected with miR-181a-5p and luciferase reporter plasmids driven by either wild type (WT) or mutant (MUT) 3′-UTR of β-catenin and TCF4 that was devoid of miR-181a-5p binding activity. d The protein levels of βcatenin and TCF4 as determined by Western blot analysis in HCT116 and SW480 cells transfected with miR-181a-5p or miR-control. e Inverse correlation between the expression levels of miR-181a-5p and those of β-catenin (r = -0.562, P &lt; 0.001), and between the expression levels of miR-181a-5p and those of TCF4 (r = -0.518, P &lt; 0.001) in 64 CRC samples. f TOP/FOP luciferase activity in HCT116 and SW480 cells transfected with miR-181a-5p or a miR-control. g The protein levels of Cyclin D1 and Axin2 as determined by Western blot analysis in HCT116 and SW480 cells transfected with miR-181a-5p or miR-control. *P &lt; 0.05 we knocked down β-catenin or TCF4, respectively, and performed MTT cell proliferation assays in the presence of 5-Fu or Oxa.

        <p>Consistently, miR-181a-5p knockdown also completely reversed the inhibition of colony formation of CRC cells caused by CRNDE knockdown (Fig. 6b). These phenotypes were not only observed in HCT116 cells, but also in SW480 cells (Additional file 7a and b). With regard to the regulation of CRC cell chemoresistance by CRNDE, we found that the increased sensitivity of CRC cells to both 5-Fu (Fig. 6c and Additional file 7c) and Oxa (Fig. 6d and Additional file 7d) treatment induced by CRNDE knockdown was completely abolished by simultaneous miR-181a-5p knockdown, indicating that the increased levels of miR-181a-5p expression were also essential for the increased sensitivity of CRC cells to Importantly, we also sought to determine whether CRNDE regulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CRC cells, and whether this regulation was dependent on miR-181a-5p. As expected, knockdown of CRNDE led to decreased protein levels of both for β-catenin and TCF4, presumably via upregulation of miR-181a-5p. However, simultaneous knockdown of miR-181a-5p was able to reverse the repression of β-catenin and TCF4 expression (Fig. 6e and Additional file 7e). In addition, CRNDE knockdown inhibited the activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, as evidenced by TOP/FOP luciferase activity, but this inhibition was abolished by simultaneous miR-181a-5p knockdown (Fig. 6f and Additional file 7f ), suggesting that CRNDE regulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CRC cells via modulating the expression of miR-181a-5p. Collectively, these data strongly support the hypothesis that CRNDE promotes CRC cell proliferation and chemoresistance via miR-181a-5p mediated regulation of Wnt/βcatenin signaling (Fig. 7).Consistently, miR-181a-5p knockdown also completely reversed the inhibition of colony formation of CRC cells caused by CRNDE knockdown (Fig. 6b).

We found significant increase in CRNDE expression in CRC samples, and this result was also corroborated by the analysis of available data in the TCGA database. In fact, CRNDE has been shown to be upregulated in numerous types of cancers [18][19][20][21][22][23], but the molecular mechanism of CRNDE in the regulation of cancer progression was not clear.In this study, we focused our research on the regulation of CRC progression and chemoresistance by the lncRNA CRNDE.

The inverse correlation between the expression levels of CRNDE and miR-181a-5p in both clinical samples and the TCGA database further validated the target relation between the two non-coding RNAs.

This design would ensure that any result in our study would not be restricted to a single line of cells. We found that knockdown of CRNDE led to repressed cell proliferation and reduced chemoresistance, which was consistent with the oncogenic roles of CRNDE revealed by previous studies. Also, the fact that loss of endogenous CRNDE had inhibitory effects on CRC cell proliferation suggested that the presence of CRNDE would be required for the progression of CRC at physiological levels. Importantly, we also found that overexpression of miR-181a-5p induced the same phenotypes as CRNDE knockdown, which was once again consistent with the inhibitory regulation of miR-181a-5p by CRNDE.We identified miR-181a-5p as a target of CRNDE by bioinformatics prediction based on sequence complementarity.

        <p>The involvement of miR-181a-5p in cancer development has been studied by many groups, and the results were controversial. MiR-181a-5p was found to be up-regulated in pancreatic cancer and breast cancer [30,31], and other miR-181 family members were up-regulated in hepatocellular cancer stem cells [32,33]. However, other studies demonstrated that miR-181a was down-regulated in gliomas [34] and aggressive chronic lymphocytic leukemia [35]. Even in CRC development, miR-181a could function as both oncogene and tumor suppressor. MiR-181a was found to be associated with poor prognosis of colorectal cancer [36,37]. MiR-181a also promoted tumor growth and liver metastasis in colorectal cancer by targeting the tumor suppressor WIF-1 [38]. In contrast, the expression levels of miR-181a were shown to increase during the progression from non-neoplasia to dysplasia in inflammatory bowel disease-associated CRC, whereas decrease when dysplasia develops into cancer [39]. Our study appears to support a tumor suppressor role for miR-181a-5p, in terms of cell proliferation and chemoresistance. The mechanism of action of miR-181a-5p was initially investigated via target prediction. We identified β-catenin and TCF4 as inhibitory targets of miR-181a-5p. This prediction was confirmed by multiple lines of evidence. First, miR-181a-5p was able to inhibit the wild type 3′-UTR activities of β-catenin and TCF4 in a luciferase assay, but had no effect in the same assay on the activities of the mutant 3′-UTR devoid of miR-181a-5p binding ability. Second, miR-181a-5p overexpression reduced the expression of endogenous β-catenin and TCF4, and thereby inihibited the activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.The involvement of miR-181a-5p in cancer development has been studied by many groups, and the results were controversial.

        <p>Although our study did not provide direct evidence whether the changes in Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity were required for the regulation of CRC cell proliferation and chemoresistance by CRNDE and miR-181a-5p, numerous previous studies have implicated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the regulation of cell proliferation and chemoresistance (summarized in [40]). In this context, it is reasonable for us to conclude that CRNDE promotes CRC cell proliferation and chemoresistance via miR-181a-5p mediated regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. From clinical characteristics analysis, high CRNDE leads to more Lymph node metastasis. Further investigation for CRNDE relative to CRC metastasis is needed.Although our study did not provide direct evidence whether the changes in Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity were required for the regulation of CRC cell proliferation and chemoresistance by CRNDE and miR-181a-5p, numerous previous studies have implicated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the regulation of cell proliferation and chemoresistance (summarized in [40]).

        <p>In our investigation, we have established a signaling cascade involving CRNDE and miR-181a-5p in the regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, cell proliferation and the chemoresistance of CRC cells. We postulated that if restoration of increased miR-181a-5p expression levels by a miRNA inhibitor could abolish the phenotypes induced by CRNDE knockdown, it would indicate that miR-181a-5p was required for CRNDE to regulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling, CRC cell proliferation and chemoresistance. Our study maybe provide an efficient therapeutic approach for CRC treatments.In our investigation, we have established a signaling cascade involving CRNDE and miR-181a-5p in the regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, cell proliferation and the chemoresistance of CRC cells.
