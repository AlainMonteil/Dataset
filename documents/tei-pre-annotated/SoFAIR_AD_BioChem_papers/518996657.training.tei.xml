        <p>Heart failure is a pressing worldwide public-health problem with millions of patients having worsening heart failure. Despite all the available therapies, the condition carries a very poor prognosis. Existing therapies provide symptomatic and clinical benefit, but do not fully address molecular abnormalities that occur in cardiomyocytes. This shortcoming is particularly important given that most patients with heart failure have viable dysfunctional myocardium, in which an improvement or normalization of function might be possible. Although the pathophysiology of heart failure is complex, mitochondrial dysfunction seems to be an important target for therapy to improve cardiac function directly. Mitochondrial abnormalities include impaired mitochondrial electron transport chain activity, increased formation of reactive oxygen species, shifted metabolic substrate utilization, aberrant mitochondrial dynamics, and altered ion homeostasis. In this Consensus Statement, insights into the mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction in heart failure are presented, along with an overview of emerging treatments with the potential to improve the function of the failing heart by targeting mitochondria.Heart failure is a pressing worldwide public-health problem with millions of patients having worsening heart failure.

        <p>Heart failure (HF) is associated with substantial clinical burden and economic costs worldwide. The disease is particularly prevalent in elderly individuals, in whom the incidence and associated costs are projected to double over the next 20 years 1,2 . Economic costs associated with the management of patients with HF is estimated at &gt;US$30 billion annually in the USA alone, and accounts for roughly 2-3% of total healthcare spending globally 3,4 . Despite these enormous costs, mortality from HF remains high. Death from HF within 5 years of diagnosis is common despite current optimal medical therapy. Mortality and rehospitalization within 60-90 days after discharge from hospital can be as high as 15% and 35%, respectively 5 . These event rates have largely not changed over the past 15 years, despite implementation of evidence-based therapy 5 . HF rehospitalization rates also remain high, with care typically focused on symptomatic relief. Patients with HF are often designated as having either reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Patients with HFpEF also have poor prognosis after the first diagnosis 6 . Regardless of the HF aetiology, novel treatments that improve intrinsic cardiac function remain elusive.Heart failure (HF) is associated with substantial clinical burden and economic costs worldwide.

        <p>Advances in the treatment of ischaemic and valvular heart disease have clearly improved patient survival. The residual cardiac dysfunction and associated comorbid ities, however, have led, in the long-term, to the development of HF with attendant poor quality of life. Commonly prescribed HF medications, although bene ficial in promoting some symptom relief, often do not fully address the underlying causes of progressive left ventricu lar dysfunction 7 . Most standard-of-care pharmaco logical approaches to HF act by reducing workload on the failing heart and, in doing so, attempt to rebalance energy supply and energy demand, albeit to a lower level (FIG. 1). Hallmarks of current therapies include modulation of neuro hormonal abnormalities, unloading the heart (that is, vasodilatation), and/or reducing the heart rate -all important determinants of reducing myo cardial oxygen consumption 8 . β-Blockers, ivabradine, and antago nism of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system all act in concert to reduce myocardial energy requirements and attenuate or prevent further adverse cardiac remodel ling. Although these therapies have improved survival in patients with chronic ambulatory HFrEF over the past 2-3 decades, death and poor quality of life continue to adversely affect this ever-increasing patient population. This unmet need is probably not going to be met by drugs that modulate neurohormonal abnormalities and lower heart rates, because further intervention along these axes is likely to be counterproductive as hypotension and bradycardia become limiting factors. The search for more effective and complementary therapy for this patient population must be focused on improving the intrinsic function of the viable, but dysfunctional, cardiac unit -the cardiomyocytes 3,9 . The novel therapy must be haemodynamically neutral (no decrease in blood pressure or heart rate) and must target the myocardium as the centrepiece of the therapeutic intervention 10 .Advances in the treatment of ischaemic and valvular heart disease have clearly improved patient survival.

        <p>The vast majority of phase III trials in patients with HF conducted in the past decade have been negative, arguably for the same reasons discussed above 11,12 . Furthermore, a relative underinvestment in cardiovascular drug development, as well as strategic abandonment by pharmaceutical companies of new therapies for which the risks are perceived to be higher than the rewards, have also contributed to slow development of drugs for HF 13 . Moreover, the development of effective therapies for HFpEF is imperative to treat this patient population, but the variability in HFpEF phenotypes (such as age, and the presence of diabetes mellitus or hypertension), and the difficulty in establishing reliable preclinical models of HFpEF, also hinder progress. Despite these obstacles, ample opportunity exists to improve HF treatments, prov ided the focus is directed towards cardiomyocytes and their intrinsic function.The vast majority of phase III trials in patients with HF conducted in the past decade have been negative, arguably for the same reasons discussed above 11,12 .

        <p>A roundtable meeting was held in Stresa, Italy on 23 October 2015 to discuss the multifaceted problem of insufficient energy production in HF, and the role it has in progressive left ventricular dysfunction. This meeting was attended by academics, clinicians, and representatives from the pharmaceutical industry. The meeting focused on mitochondrial dysfunction as the source of energy deprivation in HF, and how correction of mitochondrial dysfunction using emerging novel therapies might lead to functional improvement of the HF phenotype. This Consensus Statement summarizes the findings from that roundtable discussion.A roundtable meeting was held in Stresa, Italy on 23 October 2015 to discuss the multifaceted problem of insufficient energy production in HF, and the role it has in progressive left ventricular dysfunction.

        <p>Aristotle considered the heart to be the body's furnace, radiating energy in the form of heat 14 . Given the astounding energetic cost of cardiac function, this concept is not so far from the truth. Humans produce and consume roughly their body weight in ATP (about 65 kg) every single day 15 . The heart accounts for only ~0.5% of body weight, but is responsible for roughly 8% of ATP consumption. This high energy flux is dynamic: the heart stores only enough energy to support pumping for a few heart beats, turning over the entire metabolite pool approximately every 10 s even at resting heart rates 16 . As the most metabolically active organ in the body, the heart possesses the highest content of mitochondria of any tissue. Mitochondria comprise 25-30% of cell volume across mammalian species 17,18 , with only the myofilaments being more densely packed within cardiac myocytes. The high mitochondrial content of cardiomyocytes is needed to meet the enormous energy requirement for contraction and relaxation (which is also an active process). About 90% of cellular ATP is util ized to support the contraction-relaxation cycle within the myocardium 19 . ATP-dependent release of actin from myosin is required for both contraction (as myosin heads cycle through cross-bridges with actin) and relaxation. Cellular sequestration of calcium back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum during diastole also requires a tremendous amount of ATP. Cells sustain the energy requirements necessary to support cardiac function through remarkable metabolic supply-demand matching 20,21 (FIG. 1). Bioenergetic homeostasis is accomplished almost exclusively through an 'energy grid' comprised of a mitochondrial network and their associated phosphate-transfer couples. Cardiac mitochondria must operate at high efficiency levels to respond instantaneously to the energetic needs of contractile units, a demand that is ever-changing and necessitated by the body's dynamic requirements for oxygen-bearing blood.Aristotle considered the heart to be the body's furnace, radiating energy in the form of heat 14 .

        <p>Myocardial energy requirements are more pronounced during physical activity, when demands for energy increase to maintain cardiac function commensurate with the needs of the body. However, other mitochondrial abnormalities besides energy deprivation during physical activity can contribute to the pathologies seen in patients with HF. Mitochondrial abnormalities in HF are not only a question of reduced capacity to generate ATP (even though that capacity is reduced at rest in HF compared with resting normal), but can also be directly linked to cardiomyocyte injury and death and, therefore, to disease progression. Abnormal mitochondria are a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which can induce cellular damage. Abnormal mitochondria can promote programmed cell death through the release of cytochrome c into the cytosolic compartment and activation of caspases. Therefore, mitochondria directly influence ongoing cell injury and death. Mitochondrial abnormalities have also been implicated in aberrant cellular calcium homeostasis, vascular smooth muscle pathology, myofibrillar disruption, and altered cell differentiation, all important issues in cardiovascular disease, including HF.Myocardial energy requirements are more pronounced during physical activity, when demands for energy increase to maintain cardiac function commensurate with the needs of the body.

        <p>Mitochondria are primarily located within subsarcolemmal, perinuclear, and intrafibrillar regions of the cardio myocyte. Although they are symbiotic partners with the other cellular compartments, mitochondria are in many ways discrete entities. Mitochondrial dynamics in the form of fission, fusion, and autophagy are highly regulated processes that are essential for energy production and structural integrity of the organelles [22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29] . Altered mitochondrial biogenesis, fragmentation, and hyperplasia have been observed in studies of human 30 and animal models 31,32 of HF. These effects seem to be caused by altered expression of proteins that regulate mitochondrial dynamics 33 . As many of these factors are 'master regulators' of mitochondrial metabolism, these changes might be directly related to the decreased capacity to oxidize fatty acid substrates often seen in HF 34,35 .Mitochondria are primarily located within subsarcolemmal, perinuclear, and intrafibrillar regions of the cardio myocyte.

        <p>Mitochondria have their own DNA (mtDNA) and a genetic code that is distinct from the host-cell nuclear DNA. mtDNA is circular in shape, analogous to DNA found in lower organisms, and a primitive fingerprint leftover from bacterial origin. Evolutionary selection pressures have led to mitochondria 'outsourcing' almost all their protein-making needs to their cellular hosts. The overwhelming majority (&gt;99%) of mitochondrial proteins come from nuclear-encoded DNA. These proteins are synthesized via cellular protein synthesis machinery, and are actively imported into mitochondria through mitochondrial membrane transporters 36 . mtDNA encodes 13 protein subunits found within three of the electron transport protein complexes, and a handful of ribosomal and transfer RNAs 37 . These proteins are 38 . Many inherited familial cardiomyopathies (both adult and paediatric) are associated with mtDNA mutations 39 . In humans, mitochondria are maternally inherited 40 , owing to high mitochondrial density in the egg and the active degradation of mitochondria in the sperm during fertilization 41 . The proximity of mtDNA to sites of mitochondrial ROS generation, poor repair mechanisms, and a lack of protective histones combine to make mtDNA particularly susceptible to oxidative injury and mutation.Mitochondria have their own DNA (mtDNA) and a genetic code that is distinct from the host-cell nuclear DNA. mtDNA is circular in shape, analogous to DNA found in lower organisms, and a primitive fingerprint leftover from bacterial origin.

        <p>Mitochondrial genetics contribute to cardiomyopathies by expressing mutant proteins that influence energy homeostasis. With 1,000-10,000 genes per mitochondria (polyploidy), mitochondrial genetics operate on population-based (instead of Mendelian) principles 37 . Mutated mtDNA is found alongside nonmutated copies, leading to mitochondrial 'heteroplasmy' . The extent of heteroplasmy in mutated mtDNA influences the susceptibility to inherited mitochondrial disease 42 . Mutated mtDNA can be found in 1 in 200 individuals, a frequency that is 20-fold higher than the incidence of mitochondrial disease. This mismatch indicates that healthy individ uals often harbour mutated mtDNA that has no observable phenotypic consequences until a certain mutation threshold is reached 37 . Although very early in preclinical development, various innovative approaches to reduce the extent of heteroplasmy using genome editing might ultimately lead to effective therapy for HF caused by genetic mitochondrial disease [43][44][45] . Given that mitochondrial abnormalities, such as increased ROS production, altered mitochondrial energetics, and impaired mitochondrial ion homeostasis, are observed in genetic mitochondrial diseases as well as HF, innovative approaches that target mitochondrial dysfunction might share efficacy across these diseases.Mitochondrial genetics contribute to cardiomyopathies by expressing mutant proteins that influence energy homeostasis.

        <p>The 'myocardial power grid' consists of mitochondrial ATP supply that transfers energy throughout the cell along intracellular phosphotransfer buffering systems (FIG. 2). Mitochondria utilize carbon sources from food substrates, which are catabolized and passed through the Krebs cycle and are then channelled through a series of redox reactions along the inner mitochondrial membrane. The oxidation of these substrates creates a proton electrochemical gradient, predominantly in the form of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ m ) 46 . Protons that re-enter the mitochondrial matrix through complex V (mitochondrial ATP synthase) liberate energy that phosphorylates ADP, regenerating ATP. Newly synthesized ATP is rapidly transferred out of mitochondria and energy is subsequently distributed throughout the cell via reversible phosphate exchange networks, primarily catalysed by creatine kinase and adenylate kinase-associated reactions 16,47 .The 'myocardial power grid' consists of mitochondrial ATP supply that transfers energy throughout the cell along intracellular phosphotransfer buffering systems (FIG. 2).

        <p>The evidence that HF involves impaired cellular energy production and transfer is considerable (TABLE 1). Among studies that have directly examined energetics in human HF, all but three noted some form of bioenergetic impairment in the failing heart. This decrement in bioenergetics is reflected by a decrease in cellular ATP, phosphocreatine (PCr), or the PCr/ATP ratio. Impaired bioenergetics affect patients with HFrEF and those with HFpEF (TABLE 1).The evidence that HF involves impaired cellular energy production and transfer is considerable (TABLE 1).

        <p>Although it is difficult to tell from the heterogeneous patient population included in TABLE 1, the progression to HF is likely to be associated with a gradual decline in bioenergetic reserve capacity that ultimately reaches a critical threshold, after which endogenous mechanisms can no longer compensate for faltering energy supply 48 . Attempts to improve bioenergetics in HF tend to focus on mitochondrial energy production as a target, because direct augmentation of myocardial creatine with oral creatine supplementation is thwarted by a decreased capacity to transport creatine into the failing cardiomyocytes 49 . Skeletal muscles also show mitochondrial dysfunction in HF, contributing to the exercise intolerance that characterizes the HF state 50 . Abnormal mitochondrial function has also been reported in patients with renal insufficiency 51 , and in patients with insulin resistance 52 . Given that patients with HF often manifest both renal insufficiency and insulin resistance, treating Several interventions are currently being tested in clinical trials to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis in HF. These include epicatechin and resveratrol, which are naturally-occurring polyphenols found in foods such as red wine, green tea, and dark chocolate. Preclinical HF models suggest that these molecules are biologically active [53][54][55] , and some success in improving cardiac function has been reported in small trials of patients with myocardial infarction 56 . Larger trials in patients with HF are required.Although it is difficult to tell from the heterogeneous patient population included in TABLE 1, the progression to HF is likely to be associated with a gradual decline in bioenergetic reserve capacity that ultimately reaches a critical threshold, after which endogenous mechanisms can no longer compensate for faltering energy supply 48 .

        <p>Substrate utilization in the failing heart has been extensively reviewed previously [57][58][59][60] . Overall, altered substrate metabolism seems to be centrally involved in HF, although the direction of the metabolic alterations is complex and is likely to depend on the particular stage of HF progression and differences in the availability of substrate (whether the heart is in a 'fed' or 'fasted' state) 58,59 .Substrate utilization in the failing heart has been extensively reviewed previously [57][58][59][60] .

        <p>The heart utilizes different substrates simultaneously to produce energy. Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is the predominate substrate used in the healthy adult human heart, being responsible for 60-80% of cardiac ATP production, followed by lesser contributions from glucose, lactate, and ketone bodies 61 . However, the heart can shift the relative contribution of these substrates in an effort to adapt to varying physiological conditions. Under conditions of low oxygen content, such as ischaemia and HF, ATP content is thought to decrease by as much as 40% 3 . In HF, fatty acid oxidation and the oxidative capacity of the mitochondria decline, and can no longer maintain sufficient levels of ATP, especially during conditions of increased cardiac workload such as exercise.The heart utilizes different substrates simultaneously to produce energy.

        <p>The failing heart shifts its predominant fuel source from mitochondrial FAO toward glycolytic pathways. This switch is most apparent in late and end-stage HF 57 , and is 30% more energetically efficient in the failing heart, because more ATP is produced per mole of oxygen during carbohydrate oxidation 62 . Numerous studies investigating FAO, glucose oxidation, and (to a lesser extent) ketone body oxidation have aimed to establish a metabolic pheno type, underlying molecular mechanisms, and potential therapeutic targets of the failing heart. The reduction in fatty acid uptake and FAO that occurs during HF might be owing to dysregulated molecu lar mechanisms responsible for fatty acid metabolism. For example, the level of peroxisome prolifer atoractivated receptor-α (PPARα), a transcription factor highly expressed in the heart and responsible for fatty acid transport into the mitochondria and peroxisomes, has been reported to be downregulated in both animal models and humans with HF 63,64 . Similarly, tissue from animals and humans with HF has reduced activity of the transcription factor responsible for mitochondrial biogenesis, PPAR-γ co-activator (PGC)-1α 64,65 . Because these transcription factors have a critical role in the regulation of cardiac mitochondrial energy production, these data suggest that decreased PPARα and PGC-1α activity might be an important precursor leading to impaired FAO during HF. Therefore, further inhibition of FAO to increase glycolytic flux via PPARα and/or PGC-1α is a plausible therapeutic target. Small-molecule regulators of PGC-1α are needed, and animal models overexpressing the transcription factor are inherently problematic, ostensibly owing to increased mitochondrial biogenesis-induced cardiomyopathy 66 . Similarly, PPARα antagonists in animal models of HF have yielded inconclusive data 67 , whereas clinical PPARα ligands are reportedly safe, but their efficacy in a HF population is currently unknown 61 . Although the safety of PPARα ligands is promising, further evidence demonstrating their efficacy in both animal models and humans with HF is needed.The failing heart shifts its predominant fuel source from mitochondrial FAO toward glycolytic pathways.

        <p>Levels of circulating free fatty acids might be higher in the failing heart than under healthy conditions owing to hormonal stimulation.

As a result, reducing the availability of circulating free fatty acids via transient adrenergic antagonists might be a viable therapy to inhibit FAO and increase glycolytic ATP prod uction. Traditionally, β-adrenergic receptor antagonists are used in HF owing to their negative ionotropic effects that reduce cardiac workload and spare oxygen by decreasing sympathetic activity 68 .

        <p>Malonyl-CoA endogenously regulates fatty acid concentrations by controlling the activity of carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase (CPT) 1, a rate-limiting enzyme in mitochondrial fatty acid uptake 68 . When intracellular levels of malonyl-CoA are increased, CPT1 is inhibited and mitochondrial fatty acid uptake is stopped 70 . The intracellular concentration of malonyl-CoA is dependent on the balance between its synthesis via acetyl-CoA carboxylase and degradation via malonyl-CoA decarboxylase. Therefore, the upregulation of acetyl-CoA carboxyl ase or inhibition of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase would increase intracellular malonyl-CoA levels, and prevent mitochondrial uptake of free fatty acids to reduce FAO. As expected, inhibiting malonyl-CoA decarboxylase in animal models has reportedly improved cardiac function after ischaemia, reduced cardiac FAO, and increased glyco lytic flux 71,72 .

        <p>Several approaches are being developed to improve the efficiency of the ETC in HF. The coenzyme Q (ubiquinol/ubiquinone CoQ) pool comprises a redoxcycling coenzyme found in the ETC. CoQ is typically synthesized de novo and undergoes a two-electron reduction from substrates fed into complexes I and II, and is then oxidized as it donates electrons into complex III. As a redox cycler, the ubiquinol/ubiquinone couple can both accept and donate electrons, depending on the redox potential 135 . Incomplete, one-electron reduction of CoQ produces semiquinone, itself a highly reactive radical. A reduced CoQ pool could potentially feed electrons 'backwards' towards complex I, which results in reverse electron transfer and ROS generation 136 . Decreased circulating CoQ has been observed in patients with HF 137,138 , with an inverse correlation observed between plasma CoQ and mortality 139 . In the Q-SYMBIO trial 140 , the efficacy of CoQ was tested in a small (n = 420), double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with HF and showed a reduction in mortality after 2 years of treatment. Although the Q-SYMBIO trial was fairly small, the promising findings triggered interest in the development of other CoQ analogues that more effectively target mitochondria. New quinone conjugates that are tethered to lipophilic, cationic triphenylphosphonium moieties, such as MitoQ, SkQ, and other plastoquinones, might improve the delivery of CoQ to mitochondria [141][142][143] , and have shown some promise in preclinical models of HF 144 . A potential problem with the use of these compounds is that they are self-limiting, in that they can depolarize mitochondria and inhibit mitochondrial respiration at high concentrations 145 .

Although the opening of the MPTP has historically been thought of as a pathological event leading to cell death, studies now suggest that transient MPTP opening might be a physiological 'reset' mechanism to prevent mitochondrial calcium overload.

Small, brief MPTP openings were found to be more frequent in HF cardiomyocytes, and were associated with transient mitochondrial depolarization and mitochondrial calcium release.

        <p>Impaired cellular calcium handling that leads to decrements in excitation-contraction coupling is noted across HF aetiologies, and contributes to poor cardiac mechanics and to arrhythmogenesis [197][198][199][200] . Mitochondria can directly influence cellular calcium dynamics, because many of the membrane-bound pumps required for cytosolic calcium release and removal are energy-dependent and ROS-dependent. Altered calcium handling has been implicated in HFpEF, in which abnormal calcium dynamics impair relaxation. Short-term administration of ivabra dine to slow the heart rate led to modest benefits in patients with HFpEF, ostensibly by providing more time for calcium-dependent relaxation 201 . The vast majority of calcium resequestration into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, obligatory for diastolic relaxation, occurs through SERCA2a, which has been shown to be downregulated in HF [202][203][204] . Overexpressing SERCA2a has shown promise in animal models of HF 205,206 , although several barriers (such as the development of neutralizing antibodies) still exist before gene transfer realizes its full translational potential 207 . Furthermore, increased ROS can oxidize proteins associated with the ryanodine receptor calciumrelease channel, which can lead to calcium leaking out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum during diastole 208 . Increased intracellular sodium levels in HF [209][210][211][212] also contribute to poor calcium handling through mechanisms involving sodium-calcium exchange. Given that calcium is central to maintaining bioenergetic supply-demand matching 21,213 , sodium overload alters cellular and mitochondrial calcium fluxes and impairs bioenergetic supply-demand matching in HF 214 . Although very early in development, inhibitors of the mitochondrial sodiumcalcium-(lithium) exchanger 215 , such as CGP-37157, have been shown to improve cardiac function in preclinical models of HF 216,217 . Inhibiting the sarcolemmal sodiumcalcium exchanger might also be a promising approach, as demonstrated in a preclinical model of HFpEF 218 .Impaired cellular calcium handling that leads to decrements in excitation-contraction coupling is noted across HF aetiologies, and contributes to poor cardiac mechanics and to arrhythmogenesis [197][198][199][200] .

        <p>Another compound in clinical development to improve cardiac efficiency in HF is omecamtiv mecarbil (CK-1827452). This drug increases the calcium sensitivity of the myofilaments 219 , which prolongs the duration of systole in animal models and in human HF [220][221][222] . Two substantial phase IIb, double-blind, randomized studies comparing omecamtiv mecarbil and placebo have been conducted. In the ATOMIC-HF trial 223 , omecamtiv mecarbil was administered for 48 h intra venously to patients with acute HF. Overall, the study was neutral (with some evidence of a symptomatic benefit at higher doses), but suggested omecamtiv mecarbil was safe. In the COSMIC-HF trial 224 , an oral formulation of omecam tiv mecarbil was associated with improvements in cardiac function over 20 weeks, with an effect that persisted for 4 weeks after stopping the drug, suggesting that improved function had produced favourable structural remodelling. Despite the promise of omecamtiv mecarbil, concerns about elevated levels of serum troponin 225 , metabolic inefficiency 226 , and impaired cardiac relaxation 227 must be assuaged by larger clinical trials to understand fully whether this approach can improve prognosis in HF.Another compound in clinical development to improve cardiac efficiency in HF is omecamtiv mecarbil (CK-1827452).

        <p>The vast majority of HF trials over the past decade have been neutral, and event rates remain unacceptably high. Perhaps most alarming, no proven therapies exist for patients with worsening chronic HF or HFpEF -populations that collectively comprise the majority of the total HF population. Moreover, although systemic blockade of maladaptive neurohormonal responses has improved outcomes in HFrEF, these agents also lower blood pressure and/or heart rate, and development of new haemodynamically active drugs for stepwise addition to existing therapies raises safety and tolerability concerns. Therefore, an ideal novel therapy would be haemodynamically neutral and target the myocardium as the centrepiece of the therapeutic mechanism. In this context, overwhelming evidence from both preclinical and clinical studies indicates bioenergetic insufficiency in HF. Studies using preclinical models of the disease continue to advance our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that contribute to poor bio energetics of the failing heart. Considerable potential exists to fill this unmet need, mitigate the economic burdens, and reduce symptoms in patients with HF by focusing on the development of new therapeutic modalities that target mitochondrial abnormalities in HF.The vast majority of HF trials over the past decade have been neutral, and event rates remain unacceptably high.
