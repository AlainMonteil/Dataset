        <p>The macrophage, one of the several key immune cell types, is believed to be involved in tumorigenesis. However, the mechanism of macrophages promoting tumor progression is largely unknown. Methods: The differentially secreted proteins of M1 and M2 macrophages were analyzed by mass spectrometry. We performed GST pull-down assay for the identification of cell-membrane receptors that interact with chitinase 3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) protein. The mouse model was used to validate the function of CHI3L1 in cancer metastasis in vivo. Protein phosphorylation and gene expression were performed to study the signaling pathway activation of cancer cells after CHI3L1 treatment.The macrophage, one of the several key immune cell types, is believed to be involved in tumorigenesis.

        <p>Results: M2 macrophage-secreted CHI3L1 promoted the metastasis of gastric and breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The CHI3L1 protein functioned by interacting with interleukin-13 receptor α2 chain (IL-13Rα2) molecules on the plasma membranes of cancer cells. Activation of IL-13Rα2 by CHI3L1 triggered the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, leading to the upregulated expression of matrix metalloproteinase genes, which promoted tumor metastasis. The results of this study indicated that the level of CHI3L1 protein in the sera of patients with gastric or breast cancer was significantly elevated compared with those of healthy donors.Results: M2 macrophage-secreted CHI3L1 promoted the metastasis of gastric and breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.

        <p>Cell migration is an essential process for the development and maintenance of multicellular organisms and is defined as the orchestrated movement of cells in a particular direction to a specific location [1]. To migrate, a cell must modify its shape to be able to interact with the surrounding tissue structures. Therefore, the extracellular matrix (ECM) serves as a substrate as well as a barrier for an advancing cell body [2]. Cell migration is an integrated, multistep process that contributes to tissue repair and regeneration, orchestrates embryonic morphogenesis and drives disease progression. During cell migration, the moving cell first becomes polarized and elongated. A pseudopod is then formed, which attaches to the ECM substrate. Subsequently, regions of the leading edge contract, thereby generating a traction force that leads to the gradual forward gliding of the cell body and its trailing edge. Metastasis, which involves the migration of cancer cells from the primary tumor to a distant organ or tissue, is the most frequent cause of death for patients with cancer. Cancer cells utilize cell migration mechanisms that are similar to those exhibited by non-neoplastic cells during physiological processes [2]. The steps of metastasis include tumor cell adhesion to and invasion of basement membranes and the surrounding tissue, intravasation into blood vessels, survival in the bloodstream, extravasation, and growth at different organ sites [2]. Only a small proportion of tumor cells invade and disseminate. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying metastasis are still poorly understood because of their apparent complexity.Cell migration is an essential process for the development and maintenance of multicellular organisms and is defined as the orchestrated movement of cells in a particular direction to a specific location [1].

        <p>Tumor progression is controlled by crosstalk between cancer cells and other cell types within the tumor microenvironment. The tumor microenvironment includes proliferating tumor cells, blood vessels, the tumor stroma, inflammatory cells, and a variety of associated tissue-type cells. This unique environment forms over the course of tumor progression due to the interactions of tumor cells with the host. This microenvironment is shaped and dominated by the tumor, which orchestrates molecular and cellular events occurring in the surrounding tissues. Although various immune effector cells are recruited to the tumor site, their anti-tumor functions are downregulated, largely in response to tumor-derived signals. Immune effector cells in the tumor microenvironment not only fail to perform anti-tumor functions but are co-opted to promote tumor growth [3]. Macrophages are a key component of the tumor microenvironment that act as facilitators of tumor cell migration and invasion, matrix degradation, and angiogenesis. The density of macrophages in the tumor microenvironment has been found to be a prognostic marker of poor outcome for a variety of carcinomas. Evidence from clinical and experimental studies has indicated that tumorassociated macrophages (TAMs) promote solid-tumor metastasis by releasing a variety of cytokines, including chemokines, inflammatory factors, and growth factors [4][5][6]. For example, macrophages can promote angiogenesis by secreting IL-1, VEGF, and MMP-2 [7]. Growth factors and proteases produced by macrophages can initiate tumorigenesis and enhance tumor progression [8]. However, many cytokines that are produced by cancer cells themselves also contribute to carcinogenesis [9]. Elevated cytokine expression may be a diagnostic cancer marker. Currently, TAM cytokine profiles are largely unknown. It is unclear whether there are some exclusively TAM-derived cytokines that are functionally essential to tumor progression.Tumor progression is controlled by crosstalk between cancer cells and other cell types within the tumor microenvironment.

        <p>There are different types of macrophages, such as M1 and M2 macrophages [10]. Phagocytosis mediated by macrophages (M1 macrophages) is essential to the immune response of animals, as revealed in our previous studies [11][12][13][14]. M2 macrophages can suppress inflammatory responses as well as promote angiogenesis and tissue remodeling and repair [10]. Our previous studies indicated that inhibition of microRNA-100 triggered apoptosis of breast and cancer cells by inhibiting ubiquitinationmediated p53 degradation [15,16], revealing a vital role of microRNAs in tumor progression. To further explore the role of macrophages in tumor progression, the proteins secreted by macrophages were characterized in this study. The results indicated that M2 macrophages are recruited by tumor cells. The M2-secreted chitinase 3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) promoted the metastasis of gastric and breast cancer cells by triggering the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Therefore, our study revealed a novel macrophage-mediated mechanism that underlies cancer cell metastasis.There are different types of macrophages, such as M1 and M2 macrophages [10].

        <p>The breast cancer metastasis assay was conducted in mice. All the experiments using animals were performed in accordance with a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Female nude mice of between 5 and 6 weeks old were used in this study. Breast cancer cells (i.e., 2 × 10 5 MDA-MB-231 cells or 8 × 10 5 MDA-MB-435 cells) stably expressing the firefly luciferase reporter were mixed with 100 μl of PBS, and the mixture was intravenously injected into the mice. 3 days later, either recombinant CHI3L1 protein (rCHI3L1) or PBS (as the control) was injected into the mice via the tail vain at a dosage of 100 μg/kg of body weight. rCHI3L1 or PBS was injected twice a week over a 7-week (MDA-MB-231) or 11-week period (MDA-MB-435). For in vivo imaging, the mice were given the substrate D-luciferin by intraperitoneal injection at a dosage of 150 mg/kg in PBS, after which lung metastasis was quantified every 2 weeks by bioluminescence imaging using an IVIS Spectrum Imaging System (Perkin Elmer).

        <p>To characterize the types of macrophages that participate in tumorigenesis, solid tumors from patients with gastric cancer were immunohistochemically analyzed by staining for human leukocyte antigen-DRα (HLA-DRα, an M1 macrophage marker) and CD206 (an M2 macrophage marker). The results showed that more CD206-positive macrophages than HLA-DRα-positive macrophages were present in the cancerous tissues (Fig. 1a,b). These findings indicated that cancer cells recruited M2 macrophages (i.e., tumor-associated macrophages) into the tumor microenvironment.To characterize the types of macrophages that participate in tumorigenesis, solid tumors from patients with gastric cancer were immunohistochemically analyzed by staining for human leukocyte antigen-DRα (HLA-DRα, an M1 macrophage marker) and CD206 (an M2 macrophage marker).

        <p>To explore the effects of M2 macrophages on cancer cell metastasis, THP-1 monocytes were polarized into M1 and M2 macrophages. After this polarization, the macrophages were co-cultured with tumor cells. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that monocytes could be polarized into M1 or M2 macrophages (Fig. 2a). The gene expression profiles that were determined revealed that the expression levels of M1-associated genes (i.e., HLA-DRα, TNFα, IL-6, and iNOS) were significantly upregulated in M1 macrophages, whereas those of the M2associated genes, including CD204, CD206, CD301, and Arginase-1, were significantly upregulated in M2 macrophages (Fig. 2b), indicating the successful polarization of monocytes. The M2 macrophages were co-cultured with gastric cancer cells (MKN-45, AGS, MGC-803, and HGC-27), breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, and MDA-MB-468), or melanoma cells (A375). The results of the Boyden chamber assays revealed that the number of migrated MKN-45, AGS, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, or MDA-MB-468 cells was significantly increased when these cells were co-cultured with M2 macrophages (Fig. 2c andd), whereas co-culturing MGC-803, HGC-27, or A375 cells with M2 macrophages did not affect the number of the cancer cells that migrated compared with those observed in the treatment medium-only group (Fig. 2c-e). However, co-culturing M1 macrophages with cancer cells did not affect the number of cancer cells that migrated (Fig. 2c-e), suggesting that M2 macrophages play an important role in gastric and breast cancer cell metastasis. To assess whether the effect of M2 macrophages on cancer cell metastasis was due to M2 macrophage secretions, the M2 macrophage culture supernatant was added to cultured cancer cells. The results indicated that the M2 macrophage culture supernatant significantly promoted the migration of gastric cancer cells (MKN-45 and AGS) and breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, and MDA-MB-468) (Fig. 2c,d), suggesting that M2 macrophage-derived secretions stimulated the metastasis of these cancer cells. MKN-45 or AGS cells exhibited a stretched and elongated morphology after co-culturing with M2 macrophages or with the M2 culture supernatant, whereas co-cultures with this cell type or the supernatant did not affect the morphology of MGC-803 and HGC-27 cells (Fig. 2f ). These results suggested that the morphological changes of MKN-45 and AGS cells facilitated cancer cell metastasis mediated by M2 macrophages or by the M2 culture supernatant.To explore the effects of M2 macrophages on cancer cell metastasis, THP-1 monocytes were polarized into M1 and M2 macrophages.

The results indicated that co-culturing isolated M2 macrophages and gastric cancer cells (MKN-45 and AGS) or breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, and MDA-MB-468) led to a significant increase in the number of migrated cancer cells compared with the control (i.e., medium alone) (Fig. 2g).

        <p>To determine which proteins secreted by M2 macrophages promote cancer cell metastasis including cancer cell migration, adhesion, and invasion, M1 and M2 macrophage culture supernatants were collected and were resolved on an SDS-PAGE denaturing gel.

        <p>To reveal the mechanism underlying CHI3L1-activated gastric and breast cancer cell metastasis, cancer cell membrane receptors were screened using GST pull-down assays with recombinant GST-CHI3L1 protein. A specific protein band was observed in the resulting pull-down product (Fig. 4a). Mass spectrometry was used to identify the protein band as interleukin (IL)-13 receptor α2 chain (IL-13Rα2). When cancer cells were incubated with the recombinant CHI3L1 protein (rCHI3L1), the CHI3L1 protein bound IL-13Rα2 (Fig. 4b, bottom panel), indicating an interaction between the two proteins. Moreover, the data revealed that CHI3L1 protein had no effect on IL-13Rα2 expression (Fig. 4b, top panel). Confocal microscopy analysis demonstrated that CHI3L1 protein was co-localized with IL-13Rα2 on the plasma membrane of cancer cells (Fig. 4c).

However, the CHI3L1-IL-13Rα2 interaction was not observed in MGC-803 and HGC-27 gastric cancer cells or A375 melanoma cells due to the lack of IL-13Rα2 on their plasma membranes (data not shown). This phenomenon was consistent with the CHI3L1-activated cancer cell metastasis described above (Figs. 2 and3).

        <p>Previous studies have revealed that the activation of IL-13Rα2 by IL-13 triggers the MAPK signaling pathway by phosphorylating extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in pancreatic and ovarian cancers and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway by phosphorylating Src and AKT in colorectal cancer [17][18][19]. As shown in Fig. 4d, adding CHI3L1 protein to gastric cancer cell (MKN-45 and AGS) and breast cancer cell (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, and MDA-MB-468) cultures promoted the phosphorylation of ERK and JNK but not Src and AKT, which was abolished by IL-13Rα2 gene silencing in cancer cells. These results indicated that the activation of IL-13Rα2 by CHI3L1 triggered only the MAPK signaling pathway in gastric and breast cancers.Previous studies have revealed that the activation of IL-13Rα2 by IL-13 triggers the MAPK signaling pathway by phosphorylating extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in pancreatic and ovarian cancers and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway by phosphorylating Src and AKT in colorectal cancer [17][18][19].

        <p>In the MAPK signaling pathway, the phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 and JNK activates the AP (activator protein)-1 transcription factor family, including c-Fos and c-Jun, and thus promotes the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in cancer cells [19][20][21]. The luciferase reporter assays showed that AP-1 transcriptional activity in cancer cells was significantly increased by the addition of rCHI3L1 protein compared with the control (Fig. 4e), indicating that AP-1 transcriptional activity was activated by CHI3L1 protein. Western blots showed that the presence of CHI3L1 dramatically elevated the levels of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins in cancer cell nuclei (Fig. 4f), confirming the activation of the AP-1 family by CHI3L1. Further data indicated that the activation of the AP-1 family by CHI3L1 significantly upregulated the levels of MMP expression in cancer cells (Fig. 4g). However, different MMPs were upregulated by CHI3L1 in different cancer cell types. The results showed that knockdown of IL-13Rα2 gene expression in cancer cells significantly reduced the CHI3L1-induced activation of AP-1 transcription factors and upregulation of MMP gene expression in cancer cells (Fig. 4e-g).In the MAPK signaling pathway, the phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 and JNK activates the AP (activator protein)-1 transcription factor family, including c-Fos and c-Jun, and thus promotes the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in cancer cells [19][20][21].

        <p>To further explore the role of CHI3L1 protein in the CHI3L1-AP-1-MMP pathway, cancer cells were treated with ERK inhibitor (U0126) or JNK inhibitor (SP600125), followed by the addition of CHI3L1 protein in MKN-45 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The data presented that ERK inhibitor or/and JNK inhibitor resulted in decreased aggregation of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins in the nuclei of cancer cells compared with the control (Fig. 4h). At the same time, CHI3L1induced upregulation of MMP genes in MKN-45 and MDA-MB-231 cancer cells was eliminated when treated with inhibitors (Fig. 4i).To further explore the role of CHI3L1 protein in the CHI3L1-AP-1-MMP pathway, cancer cells were treated with ERK inhibitor (U0126) or JNK inhibitor (SP600125), followed by the addition of CHI3L1 protein in MKN-45 and MDA-MB-231 cells.

        <p>Taken together, these findings demonstrated that the IL-13Rα2 receptor activated the MAPK signaling pathway following CHI3L1 stimulation, thus promoting cancer cell metastasis.Taken together, these findings demonstrated that the IL-13Rα2 receptor activated the MAPK signaling pathway following CHI3L1 stimulation, thus promoting cancer cell metastasis.</p>
        <p>To investigate the effect of CHI3L1 on breast cancer metastasis in vivo, MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-435 cells with a stably integrated luciferase reporter were intravenously injected into nude mice. These mice were then evaluated for cancer metastasis to the lungs (Fig. 5a). The quantitative bioluminescence imaging analysis showed that the metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells to the lung could be detected 1 week after the injection, whereas MDA-MB-435 cell metastasis was detected 3 weeks after the injection (Fig. 5b). The mice injected with the CHI3L1 protein exhibited much higher lung metastasis luciferase signals than the control (i.e., mice injected with only PBS) (Fig. 5b,c), indicating that CHI3L1 protein promoted cancer metastasis in vivo.To investigate the effect of CHI3L1 on breast cancer metastasis in vivo, MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-435 cells with a stably integrated luciferase reporter were intravenously injected into nude mice.

        <p>To evaluate whether in vivo cancer metastasis resulted from the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway by the CHI3L1-IL-13Rα2 interaction, the MAPK pathway in the metastatic tumors of mouse lungs was examined. All the mice treated with rCHI3L1 presented remarkably increased levels of phosphorylation of ERK and JNK but not Src and AKT compared with the controls (i.e., mice treated with PBS alone) (Fig. 5d); these results corresponded with those obtained using the cancer cell lines (Fig. 4f). Additionally, the c-Fos and c-Jun expression levels in the nuclei of metastatic tumors of mouse lungs were significantly upregulated in response to rCHI3L1 treatment (Fig. 5e); these results were also consistent with those obtained using the cancer cell lines (Fig. 4h). The MMP gene expression profiles in the metastatic tumors of all the mice treated with rCHI3L1 (Fig. 5f) were similar to those of the cancer cell lines (Fig. 4i). Based on the data obtained in our study, a diagram of the signaling cascades involved in CHI3L1-induced cancer cell metastasis was constructed and is shown in Fig. 5g.To evaluate whether in vivo cancer metastasis resulted from the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway by the CHI3L1-IL-13Rα2 interaction, the MAPK pathway in the metastatic tumors of mouse lungs was examined.

        <p>To assess whether CHI3L1 protein secreted into the sera of patients with cancer, the levels of CHI3L1 in the sera of healthy donors and metastatic cancer patients were determined. Western blots showed that CHI3L1 protein was present in the sera of gastric and breast cancer patients but not in the sera of healthy donors (Fig. 6a). These data indicated that because CHI3L1 protein could be detected in serum samples, this protein could serve as a marker of metastatic gastric and breast cancer.To assess whether CHI3L1 protein secreted into the sera of patients with cancer, the levels of CHI3L1 in the sera of healthy donors and metastatic cancer patients were determined.

        <p>Metastasis represents a continuum that begins with cancer cell invasion through the basement membrane into the surrounding stroma, which is followed by extravasation into the circulatory system and the establishment of neoplastic cell colonies at distant sites [22]. There is increasing evidence that macrophages play important roles in modulating the tumor metastatic capacity [23]. Macrophages originate from blood monocytes and differentiate into distinct macrophage types, which are typically identified as M1 (classically activated) and M2 (alternatively activated) macrophages. M1 macrophages are efficient immune effector cells that kill invading microorganisms and tumor cells, present antigens and produce high levels of T-cell stimulatory cytokines. M2 macrophages, however, have poor antigen-presenting capabilities [24]. These cells produce factors that suppress T-cell proliferation and activity and are generally better adapted to promoting angiogenesis and tissue remodeling and repair. Increasing amounts of data have shown that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are polarized M2 macrophages [24]. Genetic studies in mice have indicated that decreased numbers of macrophages in tumors are associated with notably reduced cancer metastasis rates [25]. Although it is known that cytokines secreted by TAMs facilitate cancer cell migration, few TAM cytokines have been investigated. It has been reported that the levels of TAM-derived tumor growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), epidermal growth factor (EGF), chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 18 (CCL18), interleukin (IL)-18, IL-1β, and IL-8 are correlated with tumor progression [6,[26][27][28][29][30]. Paracrine loops of colony- The CHI3L1 protein in the sera of healthy donors and metastatic gastric or breast cancer patients (n = 5/group) was immunoprecipitated using anti-CHI3L1. Then, the immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to western blot analysis using anti-CHI3L1. b CHI3L1 expression levels in gastric cancer tissues. CHI3L1 expression levels in the normal and cancerous tissues of the same patients were analyzed using both the Oncomine and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. c CHI3L1 expression levels in the normal and cancerous tissues of patients with breast cancer were also evaluated using the Oncomine and GEO databases stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1)/EGF and granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)/CCL18 between carcinoma cells and macrophages have been shown to lead to increased carcinoma cell invasion [31]. However, little is known about the role of the proteins secreted by TAMs in cancer metastasis. The results of this study demonstrated that CHI3L1, which is secreted by M2 macrophages, promoted cancer metastasis by activating the IL-13 receptors of cancer cells. Our study revealed the existence of not only a novel M2-secreted oncogenic protein (not a cytokine) but also a novel mechanism underlying cancer metastasis.Metastasis represents a continuum that begins with cancer cell invasion through the basement membrane into the surrounding stroma, which is followed by extravasation into the circulatory system and the establishment of neoplastic cell colonies at distant sites [22].

        <p>CHI3L1, a glycoprotein, is highly expressed in human tumors [32]. The administration of CHI3L1 has been shown to promote endothelial cell migration and tube formation in vitro but fails to protect cervical cancer cells against apoptosis induced by γ-irradiation [33]. However, the effect of M2 macrophage-derived CHI3L1 on cancer metastasis is not previously addressed. The findings of this study revealed that CHI3L1 specifically bound to the interleukin (IL)-13 receptor α2 chain (IL-13Rα2) of gastric and breast cancer cells, thus promoting cancer metastasis. These findings were consistent with previously reported data [34]. As a binding partner of IL-13Rα2, transmembrane protein 219 (TMEM219) plays a critical role in IL-13Rα2-mediated pulmonary melanoma metastasis [35]. CHI3L1 stimulation leads to TGF-β1 production during lung metastasis [35]. In our study, the results showed that the activation of IL-13Rα2 triggered the downstream MAPK signaling pathway through the phosphorylation of ERK 1/ 2 and JNK. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK led to the recruitment of activator protein (AP)-1 family members (transcription factors) in the nuclei [19,21] and thus promoted AP-1 target gene expression [36]. The AP-1 target genes are a family of MMPs [19,[36][37][38]. In the stroma of invasive carcinomas, tumor cells produce a variety of proteases, including various MMPs, to degrade the basement membrane and the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), which leads to fibronectin being exposed to the tumor cells [39]. Therefore, CHI3L1 could promote the regional or distal metastasis of cancer.
