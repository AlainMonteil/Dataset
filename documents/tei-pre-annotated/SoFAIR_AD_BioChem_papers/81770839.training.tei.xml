        <p>In the middle of 2015, 261 cancer registries submitted reports on new cancer cases and deaths occurred in 2012. Qualified data from 193 registries were used for analysis after evaluation. Crude rates, number of cases, and age-standardized rates stratified by area (urban/rural), sex, age group, and cancer type were calculated according to the national population in 2012.In the middle of 2015, 261 cancer registries submitted reports on new cancer cases and deaths occurred in 2012. Qualified data from 193 registries were used for analysis after evaluation.

        <p>The covered population were 198,060,406 from 193 qualified cancer registries (74 urban and 119 rural registries). The major indicators of quality control, percentage of cases morphologically verified (MV%), death certificateonly cases (DCO%), and the mortality to incidence (M/I) ratio, were 69.13%, 2.38%, and 0.62, respectively. It was estimated that there were 3,586,200 new cancer cases and 2,186,600 cancer deaths in 2012 in China with an incidence of 264.85/100,000 [age-standardized rate of incidence by the Chinese standard population (ASRIC) of 191.89/100,000] and a mortality of 161.49/100,000 [age-standardized rate of mortality by the Chinese standard population (ASRMC) of 112.34/100,000]. The ten most common cancer sites were the lung, stomach, liver, colorectum, esophagus, female breast, thyroid, cervix, brain, and pancreas, accounting for approximately 77.4% of all new cancer cases. The ten leading causes of cancer death were lung cancer, liver cancer, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, female breast cancer, brain tumor, leukemia, and lymphoma, accounting for 84.5% of all cancer deaths.The covered population were 198,060,406 from 193 qualified cancer registries (74 urban and 119 rural registries).

        <p>Conclusions: Continuous cancer registry data provides basic information in cancer control programs. The cancer burden in China is gradually increasing, both in urban and rural areas, in males and females. Efficient cancer prevention and control, such as health education, tobacco control, and cancer screening, should be paid attention by the health sector and the whole society of China.Conclusions: Continuous cancer registry data provides basic information in cancer control programs.

        <p>There were 261 cancer registries, located in 32 provinces, autonomous regions, or municipalities, submitted cancer data in 2012. All data were checked and evaluated according to the criteria of data quality from NCCR, and 193 registries' data were qualified and accepted for this updated cancer statistics in China in 2012. Cancer registries collected information on new cancer cases from hospitals, community health centers, medical insurance agents, and the Vital Statistics System (for cases only identified by death certification). Registries obtained information on cancer deaths from the death surveillance system, which collects death information from hospitals and the Civil Administration Bureau with available cremation records. Population information was collected from local statistical bureau or household register department in local public security bureau. Proportion of morphological verification (MV%), percentage of cancer cases identified with death certification only (DCO%), mortality to incidence (M/I) ratio, percentage of uncertified cancer (UB%), and percentage of cancer with undefined or unknown primary site (secondary) (O&amp;U%) were used to evaluate the completeness, validity, and reliability of cancer statistics. Pooled data were stratified by area (urban/rural), sex, age group, and cancer site. Cancer incident cases and deaths were estimated using agespecific rates, which were stratified by area (urban/rural), sex (male/female), and age (grouped by 0, 1-4, 5-9,…, 80-84, 85-year old and above). The Chinese population census in 2000 and the Segi's population were used for age-standardized rates (ASR) of incidence/mortality. The national incidences and mortalities were estimated using stratified rates and modelled national population in 2012.There were 261 cancer registries, located in 32 provinces, autonomous regions, or municipalities, submitted cancer data in 2012.
