        <p>Given the tissue-specific nature of epigenetic processes, the assessment of disease-relevant tissue is an important consideration for epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). Little is known about whether easily accessible tissues such as whole blood can be used to address questions about inter-individual epigenomic variation in inaccessible tissues such as the brain. We quantified DNA methylation in matched DNA samples isolated from whole blood and four brain regions (prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, superior temporal gyrus and cerebellum) from 122 individuals. We explored covariation between tissues and the extent to which methylomic variation in blood is predictive of inter-individual variation identified in the brain. For the majority of DNA methylation sites, inter-individual variation in whole blood is not a strong predictor of inter-individual variation in the brain, although the relationship with cortical regions is stronger than with the cerebellum. Variation at a subset of probes is strongly correlated across tissues, even in instances when the actual level of DNA methylation is significantly different between them. A substantial proportion of this covariation, however, is likely to result from genetic influences. Our data suggest that for the majority of the genome, a blood-based EWAS for disorders where brain is presumed to be the primary tissue of interest will give limited information relating to underlying pathological processes. These results do not, however, discount the utility of using a blood-based EWAS to identify biomarkers of disease phenotypyes manifest in the brain. We have generated a searchable database for the interpretation of data from blood-based EWAS analyses (http://epigenetics.iop.kcl.ac.uk/bloodbrain).Given the tissue-specific nature of epigenetic processes, the assessment of disease-relevant tissue is an important consideration for epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS).

        <p>There is increasing interest in the role of epigenetic processes in health and disease, with the primary focus of most epigenetic epidemiological studies to date being DNA methylation. 1 Platforms such as the Illumina 450K Human Methylation microarray (450K array) have enabled the economical, high-throughput profiling of methylomic variation across large numbers of samples and epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), which aim to identify DNA methylation differences associated with environmental exposure and disease, are now underway for many types of pathology including cancer, 2-4 autoimmune disorders, 5,6 psychiatric phenotypes, 7 neurodevelopmental disorders 8,9 and dementia. 10,11 Despite the recent successes in identifying disease-associated epigenetic variation, the design, analysis and interpretation of EWAS requires careful attention; there are a number of critical issues that need to be considered in epigenetic epidemiology that preclude a simple re-analysis of DNA samples collected for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). 9,[12][13][14] Of particular importance is the fact that, unlike germline genetic variation, epigenetic signatures are tissue-specific; therefore the selection of tissue type for epigenetic epidemiology is potentially critical. The ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap projects, [15][16][17] for example, have recently characterized the distinct epigenetic profiles defining human cell-types, highlighting how these reflect the developmental relationships between them. It is clear that intra-individual epigenetic differences (i.e. between tissues within a single person) greatly outweigh inter-individual differences within a specific tissuetype. [18][19][20][21][22][23] Although many clinical and epidemiological studies are examining epigenetic variation in easily accessible cells obtained from tissues such as whole blood, the extent to which these can be used to address questions about inter-individual epigenomic variation in inaccessible tissues such as the brain has not yet been systematically explored. Addressing this issue will be critical given the paucity of high-quality brain tissue from clinically wellphenotyped patients and controls, especially if EWAS analyses require sample sizes approaching those necessary to identify genetic associations with complex disease phenotypes. Because the brain and blood originate from different developmental cell lineages and are epigenetically distinct, 23 it is clearly inappropriate to use blood as a proxy measure for actual brain DNA methylation profiles. Despite this, epidemiological studies using accessible peripheral tissues may still be informative in an epidemiological context if interindividual variation is correlated across tissues.There is increasing interest in the role of epigenetic processes in health and disease, with the primary focus of most epigenetic epidemiological studies to date being DNA methylation. 1 Platforms such as the Illumina 450K Human Methylation microarray (450K array) have enabled the economical, high-throughput profiling of methylomic variation across large numbers of samples and epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), which aim to identify DNA methylation differences associated with environmental exposure and disease, are now underway for many types of pathology including cancer, 2-4 autoimmune disorders, 5,6 psychiatric phenotypes, 7 neurodevelopmental disorders 8,9 and dementia. 10,11 Despite the recent successes in identifying disease-associated epigenetic variation, the design, analysis and interpretation of EWAS requires careful attention; there are a number of critical issues that need to be considered in epigenetic epidemiology that preclude a simple re-analysis of DNA samples collected for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). 9,[12][13][14] Of particular importance is the fact that, unlike germline genetic variation, epigenetic signatures are tissue-specific; therefore the selection of tissue type for epigenetic epidemiology is potentially critical.

        <p>In this study we quantified DNA methylation using the 450K array in a unique collection of matched DNA samples isolated from pre-mortem whole blood and four post-mortem brain regions (prefrontal cortex (PFC), entorhinal cortex (EC), superior temporal gyrus (STG) and cerebellum (CER)) dissected at autopsy from 122 individuals. We describe patterns of covariation across tissues and identify sites where estimates of DNA methylation in whole blood are predictive of inter-individual variation in DNA methylation across the four brain regions. Our data are available in an online searchable database (http://epigenetics.iop.kcl.ac.uk/bloodbrain) to enable the research community to explore the relationship between whole blood and brain DNA methylation patterns at specific locations across the genome.In this study we quantified DNA methylation using the 450K array in a unique collection of matched DNA samples isolated from pre-mortem whole blood and four post-mortem brain regions (prefrontal cortex (PFC), entorhinal cortex (EC), superior temporal gyrus (STG) and cerebellum (CER)) dissected at autopsy from 122 individuals.

        <p>We used the Illumina 450K array to quantify DNA methylation in four dissected brain regions (PFC: n = 114, EC: n = 108, STG: n = 117 and CER: n = 112) and matched pre-mortem whole blood samples (n = 80) from an overlapping set of 122 individuals (Supplementary Table 1). Following pre-processing, normalization and stringent quality control (see Materials and Methods), principal component (PC) analysis was performed across the full dataset (comprising 531 individual DNA samples and data for a pruned set of 427,018 high-quality probes). The first PC, explaining 51.4% of the variance, clearly distinguishes between whole blood, cerebellum, and the three cortical regions (Supplementary Figure 1). A similar separation of these tissues is observed with the second PC which explains 29.4% of the variance. This observation concurs with previous studies comparing whole blood and brain samples based on smaller samples and using alternative technologies for assessing DNA methylation. [23][24][25] These differences between tissues are reflected in gene expression data, 26,27 which confirms the cerebellum as being clearly distinguishable from cortical brain regions. The three cortical regions have strikingly similar DNA methylation profiles; although examination of further PCs, none of which explain more than 5% of the variance, starts to tease apart these regions, none of the top 20 PCs does this definitively (Supplementary Figure 1).We used the Illumina 450K array to quantify DNA methylation in four dissected brain regions (PFC: n = 114, EC: n = 108, STG: n = 117 and CER: n = 112) and matched pre-mortem whole blood samples (n = 80) from an overlapping set of 122 individuals (Supplementary Table 1).

        <p>We used linear regression models to calculate the proportion of variance in DNA methylation explained by tissue, individual and sex. Across autosomal probes, tissue is the strongest predictor of DNA methylation (Supplementary Figure 2), although there is a subset of probes for which individual predicts more of the variance (5.39% of all probes) than tissue type (see Supplementary Table 2). Across all autosomal probes passing stringent QC (n = 416,872), tissue explains &gt; 50% of the variance in DNA methylation at 193,333 (46.4%) sites, compared to individual differences which explain &gt; 50% of the variance at 4,669 (1.12%) sites (Figure 1A). These percentages increase to 66.2% and 1.61% respectively when limited to probes classified as being "blood variable" (n = 185,060) (see Materials and Methods). As expected, sex makes a strong contribution to variation observed at probes on chromosomes X and Y (n = 10,146), explaining &gt;50% of the variance at 5,920 (58.3%) of these positions compared to tissue which explains &gt;50% of the variance at only 1,359 (1.34%) sites. In contrast, sex makes a very small contribution to autosomal variation, explaining &gt;50% of the variance at only 18 (4.32x10 -3 %) of autosomal probes (Supplementary Figure 3).We used linear regression models to calculate the proportion of variance in DNA methylation explained by tissue, individual and sex.

        <p>Although patterns of DNA methylation are clearly distinct across different brain regions and blood, driven by highly significant mean differences in DNA methylation at multiple sites across the genome, 23 we were interested in exploring the extent to which inter-individual variation detected in blood reflects inter-individual variation in the three cortical regions and cerebellum. Focusing on autosomal DNA methylation sites characterized as being variable in whole blood (n = 185,060, see Materials and Methods), correlation coefficients across all individuals were calculated between DNA methylation in whole blood and each of the four brain regions. Randomly selecting pairs of 'matched' samples to derive the null distribution, we found a modest but highly-significant positive shift in the distribution of correlations for each of the four brain regions (PFC: Wilcoxon test P &lt; 2.2x10 -308 , EC: P &lt; 2.2x10 -308 , STG: P &lt; 2.2x10 -308 , CER: P &lt; 2.2x10 -308 ), with a small peak highlighting a number of probes characterized by a near perfect correlation (Figure 1B-E). For the majority of probes, however, inter-individual variation in DNA methylation in whole blood explains only a small amount of the variation seen in any of the brain regions (Figure 2). For example, DNA methylation in whole blood is strongly correlated with levels in cerebellum (i.e. explaining &gt;50% of the variance) for only 1.19% of "blood variable" probes, and moderately correlated (i.e. explaining &gt;20% of the variance) with 3.68% of "blood variable" probes. Of note, the extent of inter-individual correlation is significantly higher (P &lt; 1.0 -308 ) between whole blood and each of the three cortical regions than with the cerebellum, although the proportion of correlated probes is still low (Supplementary Table 3).

        <p>The extent to which inter-individual variation in whole blood is correlated with that in the brain is similar across the four brain regions (Supplementary Figure 6), with a highly significant correlation of probe-wise correlations. Of note, the three cortical regions are more similar to each other in this regard than the cerebellum, indicating that there is a subset of probes where variation in whole blood predicts variation in the cortex and not the cerebellum, and vice versa (for example see Supplementary Figure 7). This suggests that the extent of covariation between pairs of tissues can differ depending upon the tissues in question, and establishing a correlation between any two tissues does not imply a correlation between all tissues. Of additional interest are sites where there is a significant, but negative, correlation between blood and brain (see Supplementary Figure 8 for specific examples), a phenomenon that has been reported previously for certain loci. 25 This phenomenon is relatively rare, and most notable between DNA methylation in whole blood and cerebellum (Supplementary Table 4).The extent to which inter-individual variation in whole blood is correlated with that in the brain is similar across the four brain regions (Supplementary Figure 6), with a highly significant correlation of probe-wise correlations.

        <p>It is a common misconception that a similar average level of DNA methylation between two tissues at a given locus is sufficient to establish that one of these tissues may be used as a proxy for the other. 31 In fact, for epidemiological studies that use peripheral tissues as a proxy, it is actually more important that the two tissues covary, regardless of their absolute DNA methylation levels. To demonstrate this point, Supplementary Table 6 lists 887 sites characterized by similar levels of DNA methylation between tissues (paired t-test P &gt; 0.1) but no evidence for inter-individual covariation (r 2 &lt; 0.05), with specific examples shown in Supplementary Figure 9.

        <p>One potential caveat to performing an EWAS of a neurological/psychiatric phenotype using a peripheral tissue as a proxy is that a proportion of sites are characterized by limited interindividual variation in whole blood but high levels of inter-individual variation in the brain, and vice versa.

Figure 5A shows that there are 2,505 sites characterized by high inter-individual variation in whole blood but not in the cortex (STG) (see Supplementary Figure 11 and Supplementary Table 8 for corresponding data for the other cortical regions) and 6,909 sites that vary in whole blood but not in the cerebellum. Whether these sites are omitted from analyses (for example to reduce multiple testing burden) depends upon the ultimate aim of the study being undertaken; while they may not be able to inform directly about mechanistic processes in disease they could still represent useful biomarkers.

        <p>Our data suggest that across the majority of the genome, an EWAS using whole blood for disorders where brain is the presumed to be the primary tissue of interest will give limited information relating to underlying pathological processes. However, there are a proportion of sites where inter-individual variation is correlated between whole blood and brain, and these results do not discount the utility of using a blood-based EWAS to identify potential biomarkers of psychiatric disease phenotypes. We have developed a searcheable online database (http://epigenetics.iop.kcl.ac.uk/bloodbrain/) to enable researchers to investigate the relationship between blood and brain for any probes on the Illumina 450K Beadchip array to aid in the interpretation of EWAS analyses of brain disorders.Our data suggest that across the majority of the genome, an EWAS using whole blood for disorders where brain is the presumed to be the primary tissue of interest will give limited information relating to underlying pathological processes.

        <p>We obtained entorhinal cortex (EC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), superior temporal gyrus (STG), and cerebellum (CER) tissue from 117 individuals archived in the MRC London Neurodegenerative Disease Brain Bank (http://www.kcl.ac.uk/iop/depts/cn/research/MRC-London-Neurodegenerative-Diseases-Brain-Bank/MRC-London-Neurodegenerative-Diseases-Brain-Bank.aspx). Ethical approval for the study was provided by the NHS South East London REC 3. All samples were dissected by trained specialists, snap-frozen and stored at -80 °C. Matched whole blood samples collected before death were available for 80 samples (Supplementary Table 1) as part of the Alzheimer's Research UK funded study "Biomarkers of AD Neurodegeneration", with informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki (1991). Genomic DNA was isolated from ~100 mg of each dissected brain region or ~10ml whole blood stored in EDTA collection tubes using a standard phenol-chloroform extraction method, and tested for degradation and purity before analysis.We obtained entorhinal cortex (EC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), superior temporal gyrus (STG), and cerebellum (CER) tissue from 117 individuals archived in the MRC London Neurodegenerative Disease Brain Bank (http://www.kcl.ac.uk/iop/depts/cn/research/MRC-London-Neurodegenerative-Diseases-Brain-Bank/MRC-London-Neurodegenerative-Diseases-Brain-Bank.aspx).

        <p>500ng DNA from each sample was sodium bisulfite-treated using the Zymo EZ 96 DNA methylation kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer's standard protocol. DNA methylation was quantified using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450K BeadChip (Illumina) using a Illumina HiScan System (Illumina). All samples were assigned a unique code for the purpose of the experiment and grouped by tissue and randomized with respect to other variables status to avoid batch effects, and processed in batches of four BeadChips.500ng DNA from each sample was sodium bisulfite-treated using the Zymo EZ 96 DNA methylation kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer's standard protocol.

        <p>A subset of "blood variable" probes was identified by calculating the DNA methylation difference between the 10 th and 90 th percentile across all samples, and selecting sites where this was &gt; 5% (all chromosomes n = 194,426; autosomes n = 185,060). Sites characterized by overall differential DNA methylation between blood and each brain region were identified by a paired t-test of matched samples. Pairwise correlation coefficients were calculated between DNA methylation values from whole blood and each of the four brain regions across matched samples from linear regression models; the values were squared and multiplied by 100 to obtain the percentage of variance explained for each probe. Samples were permuted and correlations between DNA methylation in whole blood and brain were recalculated across unmatched pairs to establish the distribution in the scenario where there is no relationship between DNA methylation in blood and brain. The density curve of these simulated correlations was added to the histograms of the true correlation coefficients to represent the null distribution (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 4). The annotation file provided by Illumina for all probes on the array was used to classify DNA methylation sites into genomic feature and CpG island feature categories; any site with no UCSC gene annotation was classed as "intergenic". Enrichment was calculated from a 2x2 Fisher's Exact test, comparing the number of probes with blood-brain correlation r 2 &gt; 0.5 annotated to each feature category to the background of all probes.A subset of "blood variable" probes was identified by calculating the DNA methylation difference between the 10 th and 90 th percentile across all samples, and selecting sites where this was &gt; 5% (all chromosomes n = 194,426; autosomes n = 185,060).

B) to E) histograms showing the distribution of correlation coefficients between DNA methylation in whole blood and the four brain regions (PFC, EC, STG and CER). For all four brain regions the distribution of correlation coefficients is significantly skewed to the right, with stronger correlations seen between whole blood and cortical regions than between whole blood and cerebellum. 3: DNA methylation in whole blood significantly covaries with that in the brain at some genomic loci.
