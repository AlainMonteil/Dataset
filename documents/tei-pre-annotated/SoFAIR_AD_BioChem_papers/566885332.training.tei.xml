        <p>Observational epidemiology often examines the associations between exposures and health outcomes. However, such associations reported in epidemiological studies are often not reliable estimates of causal effects, and can be produced by confounding (that is, by another factor that affects both the outcome and exposure) [1][2][3] or by other forms of bias. For example, alcohol consumption might be related to many potential confounding factors, including smoking, an unhealthy diet, and limited exercise. In turn, ill health could be related to a reduction or cessation of alcohol consumption, introducing potential bias due to reverse causality, when interest is in studying the effect of alcohol consumption on subsequent health. 4 5 Several approaches have been developed with the aim of mitigating such biases. 6 For example, instrumental variable methods rely on an external factor that determines the exposure of interest but is not associated with the outcome other than through its effect on the exposure. 6 7 Over the past decade, advances in genetic technologies have enabled the identification of thousands of reproducible associations between genetic variation and relevant exposures, traits, and health outcomes. These genetic variations can be used as instrumental variables to analyse the effect of modifiable exposures on diseases through a study method termed mendelian randomisation (MR). 8 MR studies use genetic variants robustly related to modifiable exposures to understand the influence of the exposure on various health, social, and economic outcomes. Genetic variation is essentially randomly inherited from parents to offspring at conception, and consequently, many factors that confound the association between the exposure and outcome cannot affect the genetic variants. Similarly, genetic variants are generally not influenced by the outcome and therefore, by reverse causation. MR thus provides an opportunity to study the association between exposures and outcomes while reducing potential bias from confounding and reverse causation. 9 These features make genetic variants suitable candidates as instrumental variables, which can help estimate the causal effects of modifiable exposures on outcomes. 7 For example, the rs1229984 variant in the alcohol dehydrogenase 1B gene (ADH1B) has been used as an instrument to investigate the causal role of alcohol in cardiovascular disease. 10 Given these advantages, MR studies have increased in popularity and have begun to inform understanding of disease doi: 10.1136/bmj.n2233 | BMJ 2021;375:n2233 | the bmj causation. MR is not limited to studies using genetic variants to generate instrumental variable estimates (box 1, table 1); however, these studies dominate the literature.

        <p>Despite the growth in MR applications and methods and the increasing relevance of MR findings, little consensus exists around the reporting of MR studies. As a result, the quality of reporting of these studies has been inconsistent. Empirical evidence [22][23][24] indicates that many reports of MR studies do not clearly state or examine the various assumptions of MR methods and report insufficient details on the data sources, which makes the quality and reliability of the results difficult to evaluate.Despite the growth in MR applications and methods and the increasing relevance of MR findings, little consensus exists around the reporting of MR studies.

Some STROBE items are either too general or do not apply to MR studies, while other items relevant to MR studies are missing. To improve reporting MR studies, we developed a separate checklist of items motivated by the STROBE guidelines but explicitly focused on the MR study design, resulting in the STROBE-MR statement (strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology using mendelian randomisation 27 ; table 3).

        <p>While MR generally uses genetic variation as the instrumental variable, MR is not limited to such studies. Indeed, the term "mendelian randomisation" was introduced in 1991 for investigations of bone marrow transplantation in the treatment of childhood malignancies. 11 12 The basic notion was that if a child had an HLA compatible sibling, that child was more likely to receive a bone marrow transplant than a child with no compatible sibling. Analysing outcomes according to whether the child has such a sibling (optimally taking the number of siblings into account) is analogous to an intention-to-treat analysis in a randomised clinical trial. 11 12 Having an HLA compatible sibling (as a matter of chance) could also serve as a genetic instrument for bone marrow transplantation, and so might be used to infer effects of transplantation on cancer outcomes. This approach has continued to be used. [13][14][15] Initially, MR was defined as the use of germline genetic variation to strengthen causal inference for the influence of modifiable exposures on risk of disease or other outcomes. 16 This wider definition includes, for example, studies of gene-bycovariate interaction (often with environment as the covariate), for which the interaction cannot be viewed as an instrument for the exposure of interest. 17 18 Other study designs, such as twin studies, also use the basic principles of mendelian genetics and so can be considered a form of MR. One such example used a male co-twin as an indicator of (on average) higher antenatal testosterone to appraise the effect of testosterone on neurodevelopmental traits. 19 MR studies range from a simple test of an association between single nucleotide polymorphisms and outcome, which can provide evidence as to whether an exposure affects a disease, to a specific effect estimate from an instrumental variable analysis.While MR generally uses genetic variation as the instrumental variable, MR is not limited to such studies.

        <p>The STROBE-MR (strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology using mendelian randomisation) guidelines are aimed at the (currently) large majority of MR studies that are implemented within an instrumental variable framework.

In a one sample MR study, the associations between the genetic variant and exposure and between the genetic variant and outcome are both measured in the same sample. In a two sample MR study, these two associations are measured in separate samples. MR studies can also use either individual level or summary level data to derive or apply the weights for each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Two sample MR studies are most commonly conducted with summary level data, where the weights are derived from the first sample, which are then applied in the second sample to estimate the gene-outcome association. Summary sample weights for the association of genetic variants with an exposure can also be used in an individual level data analysis of the association of these variants with the outcome.

Examples of quality reporting for each checklist item have been identified from published MR studies. This document should be considered as a reference for authors to understand better what is meant by each item in the accompanying checklist. The examples do not necessarily represent the ideal statement for each checklist item. Rather, they highlight the intended issue meant to be covered in each item in the checklist.

Because evidence supports a role for increased BMI in MS pathogenesis, at least part of the observed link between pubertal timing and MS might be explained by BMI.

        <p>As in STROBE, 26 presenting critical elements of study design early in the article allows readers to orient themselves on the study basics. Authors should clarify whether the MR study used individual level participant data or SNP level summary data, and whether it uses a one sample or two sample MR design. In a two sample MR study, one stage can use summary data and another stage can use individual level data. Some MR studies draw on multiple sources of data (eg, different sources for the ascertainment of the association between the genetic variant and exposure, and for the association between the genetic variant and outcome). Furthermore, sources of data could be from metaanalyses of multiple samples. The general design and data sources should therefore be made clear.As in STROBE, 26 presenting critical elements of study design early in the article allows readers to orient themselves on the study basics.

For example, when multiple genetic variants are used, MR Egger regression, 55 weighted median, 56 or weighted mode 57 are often used as supplementary estimators.

        <p>Some falsification strategies assess assumptions jointly. When using multiple genetic variants as proposed instruments, it is possible to test whether heterogeneity exists across the separate effect estimates (see Test for difference, table 2). Although this test is often interpreted as an assessment of the exclusion restriction, it is jointly testing the exclusion restriction, independence, and homogeneity assumptions. Another relatively straightforward joint test of all assumptions comes from comparing the effect estimate with that obtained by use of a more traditional confounding-adjustment approach. 73 Assuming that the traditional approach is biased owing to unmeasured confounding, and that the direction of that confounding is suspected, the examination of whether the MR effect estimate aligns with the suspected direction of confounding can support the joint validity of the assumptions underlying the MR effect estimate.Some falsification strategies assess assumptions jointly.

        <p>Because several of the estimators using multiple genetic variants rely on different versions of relaxing or adapting the instrumental variable assumptions (eg, MR Egger, median based, or modal based estimators), a comparison of estimates obtained using each of these approaches can help understand the sensitivity of effect estimates to the non-overlapping assumptions of each. 74 Researchers might also compare MR effect estimates with non-MR estimates, depending on the assumptions underlying alternative methods. Independent replication of MR findings in an independent dataset or with a different study design (eg, one sample v two sample MR) is typically advocated to assess the findings' robustness. Many of the traditional bias analytical techniques in epidemiology can be adapted for MR readily, including the calculations from formulas for understanding the magnitude and direction of confounding bias 59 67-69 75 or for violations of the exclusion restriction. 5976 When selection bias is a concern, researchers also frequently conduct simulations to understand the plausible size and direction of bias. 64 Simulations might also help understand the plausible size and direction of bias induced by assortative mating, 62 dynastic effects, 9 63 and time varying effects, 77 To investigate the degree of bias in the initial causal estimates due to pleiotropic effects, we used two sensitivity analyses (mendelian randomisation-Egger and weighted median mendelian randomisation) . . .

Aside from mRNA expression, differences in protein expression or function are the most proximal consequence of natural genetic variation. This has two consequences: frequently, variants located in and around the encoding gene can be identified with a very substantial effect on protein expression in comparison to other traits; moreover such instruments may also be less prone to violating the 'no horizontal pleiotropy' assumption than variants located elsewhere in the genome . . . In the case of MR analysis of proteins, Crick's 'Central Dogma' imposes an order on the direction of information flow from gene to mRNA to encoded protein, which does not extend beyond this to other biological traits that lie more distally in the causal chain that connects genetic variation to disease risk. Finally, cis-MR of a protein risk factor greatly reduces the risk of reverse causation, because Crick's dogma indicates that the pathway gene → encoded protein → disease would always be favoured over the pathway gene → disease → encoded protein, especially given that the gene → encoded protein association is typically derived from population-based (disease-free) samples. Thus, from an MR perspective, proteins are in a privileged position compared with other categories of risk factor and the use of cis-MR represents an optimal approach to instrument their causal effect for disease." 85

        <p>Two sample MR analyses assume that the SNPexposure associations are similar in the two samples. For example, the analysis assumes that the two samples are drawn from the same underlying population. However, characteristics such as ethnic origin are not the only relevant factors. Similarity of the two samples can also be violated if, for example, genetic associations were estimated in premenopausal versus post-menopausal women, or in a population based sample versus a high risk sample. Where this assumption cannot be made, it should be evaluated by comparing the SNPs' association with the exposure and the outcome in the two samples, whenever the data are available.

        <p>A common reason why MR estimates do not have a straightforward causal interpretation is because it is unclear whether the gene-environment equivalence assumption (table 2) is plausible (this assumption being that differences in the exposure between genetically defined subgroups of the population are equivalent to differences in the exposure due to an interventionthat is, the MR form of the consistency assumption). 110 Effects of genetic variants can influence outcomes from conception onwards and in a manner that can be variable and complex. Various components of growth and development could be influenced by the variants, whilst their identification through genetic association studies is often from association with phenotype measured at one time point. The often lifelong influence of genetic variants can be different from the environmental influences investigated in conventional epidemiological studies that are generally experienced at defined stages of later life. Differing effects over the life course do not lessen the potential use of MR estimates. For example, it is possible to separate the effects of body mass index in childhood and adulthood on a variety of health outcomes using different instruments for the two exposure periods. 111 Conversely, the long term effect of lowered low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol can be estimated from early life onwards by MR and is double the effect estimate derived from randomised trials. This difference probably reflects MR providing an estimate of lifelong effects, whereas trials provide an effect estimate for period of randomisation, which lasts just a few years in cholesterol lowering randomised clinical trials. This difference seen between estimates relating to lifetime differences and shorter term cholesterol lowering is anticipated from the known cumulative effect of lipids on atherosclerotic coronary disease. 112 The fact that similar estimates are seen in this regard for a wide variety of non-overlapping sets of instruments constructed to match pharmaceutical agents for LDL cholesterol lowering adds robustness to the interpretation. 112 Time dependency of the effects of instruments is an important issue that should be considered when interpreting MR findings, and is well served by viewing this in the context of geneenvironment equivalence.A common reason why MR estimates do not have a straightforward causal interpretation is because it is unclear whether the gene-environment equivalence assumption (table 2) is plausible (this assumption being that differences in the exposure between genetically defined subgroups of the population are equivalent to differences in the exposure due to an interventionthat is, the MR form of the consistency assumption). 110 Effects of genetic variants can influence outcomes from conception onwards and in a manner that can be variable and complex.

Likewise, if the effect of an exposure on an outcome is cumulative over many years, MR can overestimate the effect when compared to short term interventions. 60 119 Also, MR estimates are directly calculated only for the exposure range caused by differences in alleles. Applying MR results, therefore, might not generalise to a wider exposure range. Further, if the MR estimate was derived from a population subgroup, it might not be generalisable beyond that subgroup.</p>

        <p>The source of research funding can lead to bias or perceptions of bias in the design, conduct, or interpretation of research. 121 122 This bias is of special concern when research is funded by an entity that has an interest in outcomes that are favourable to its own commercial, academic, or other interests. 123 Authors should disclose all funding sources and provide detailed information about the role of funders Box 4: Interpretation of causal effect estimates Various considerations are needed when interpreting causal estimates. If the homogeneity assumption is plausible, along with the other assumptions (box 2), then the causal estimate will represent the average causal effect of the exposure on the outcome in the studied population. If the homogeneity assumption cannot be made, but the monotonicity assumption is plausible, then the causal estimate can be used to represent the local average treatment effect. 86 Caution is especially warranted when interpreting effect estimates with a binary exposure. 114 In this instance, the homogeneity and monotonicity assumptions are less likely to be plausible. Also, if the exposure is a dichotomisation of a continuous risk factor, this poses a further threat to the violation of the exclusion restriction assumption. 114 An additional consideration, which is particularly pertinent to the two sample MR setting, is whether the causal effect can truly be attributed to the binary exposure. For example, when two sample MR studies are carried out in exposure samples that contain only a small number of participants who have experienced the exposure in question, it would be misleading to interpret the effects as being those of the exposure itself. Instead, the causal effect estimate should be interpreted as reflecting the effects of the genetic liability to the exposure. 115 116 Finally, an important component of interpretation is defining the time period. 60 Usually MR studies are interpreted as a so-called lifetime effect of the exposure, but some settings (eg, MR studies in pregnant women to study prenatal exposures) lend themselves to studies of period effects. in developing the research question, collecting data, analysing data, selecting investigators, reviewing results, preparing the manuscript, or approving the manuscript for submission or publication. Other sources of influence can include employers, political appointees, and government researchers. Describing the source of funding allows readers to evaluate the work's credibility and trustworthiness in the light of any potential influence from funders. Authors should disclose funding sources for biobanks or other repositories or databases used in their study because these entities also have commercial interests that might influence research integrity. 124 125 Data and data sharing (item 19) Provide the data used to perform all analyses or report where and how the data can be accessed, and reference these sources in the article.

        <p>The STROBE-MR reporting guideline proposes a minimum set of items supporting authors to clearly communicate what was planned, what was done, and what was found in an MR study. Similar to the STROBE guidelines 25 26 for the classical epidemiological study designs-cohort, case-control, and cross sectional studies-the goal is not to be prescriptive of study conduct or limit creativity in the field. Rather, the STROBE-MR guideline is intended to facilitate clear and comprehensive reporting to enable an appraisal of a study's quality, limitations, and generalisability of findings. The checklist is not intended as a formal tool for assessing the methodological or reporting quality of MR studies, and should not be transformed into a quality scale. 130 131 STROBE-MR should also not be seen as a formal guideline to design and conduct MR studies. However, some items and text might be useful when designing or conducting an MR study, We invite readers to comment on STROBE-MR and suggest improvements to the checklist, explanations, and examples. The checklist and E&amp;E document are living documents that we intend to keep up to date on a dedicated website (https://www.strobe-mr.org/). We encourage journals to endorse these guidelines using clear language regarding what they expect from authors and include this information in their instructions to authors.
