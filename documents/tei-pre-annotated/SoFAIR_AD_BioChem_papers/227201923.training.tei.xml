        <p>Across a variety of Mendelian disorders, B50-75% of patients do not receive a genetic diagnosis by exome sequencing indicating disease-causing variants in non-coding regions. Although genome sequencing in principle reveals all genetic variants, their sizeable number and poorer annotation make prioritization challenging. Here, we demonstrate the power of transcriptome sequencing to molecularly diagnose 10% (5 of 48) of mitochondriopathy patients and identify candidate genes for the remainder. We find a median of one aberrantly expressed gene, five aberrant splicing events and six mono-allelically expressed rare variants in patient-derived fibroblasts and establish disease-causing roles for each kind. Private exons often arise from cryptic splice sites providing an important clue for variant prioritization. One such event is found in the complex I assembly factor TIMMDC1 establishing a novel disease-associated gene. In conclusion, our study expands the diagnostic tools for detecting non-exonic variants and provides examples of intronic loss-of-function variants with pathological relevance.Across a variety of Mendelian disorders, B50-75% of patients do not receive a genetic diagnosis by exome sequencing indicating disease-causing variants in non-coding regions.

        <p>espite the revolutionizing impact of whole-exome sequencing (WES) on the molecular genetics of Mendelian disorders, B50-75% of the patients do not receive a genetic diagnosis after WES 1 . The disease-causing variants might be detected by WES but remain as variants of unknown significance (VUS, Methods section) or they are missed due to the inability to prioritize them. Many of these VUS are synonymous or non-coding variants that may affect RNA abundance or isoform but cannot be prioritized due to the poor understanding of regulatory sequence to date compared to coding sequence. Furthermore, WES covers only the 2% exonic regions of the genome. Accordingly, it is mostly blind to regulatory variants in non-coding regions that could affect RNA sequence and abundance. While the limitation of genome coverage is overcome by whole genome sequencing (WGS), prioritization and interpretation of variants identified by WGS is in turn limited by their amount [2][3][4] .espite the revolutionizing impact of whole-exome sequencing (WES) on the molecular genetics of Mendelian disorders, B50-75% of the patients do not receive a genetic diagnosis after WES 1 .

        <p>With RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), limitations of the sole genetic information can be complemented by directly probing variations in RNA abundance and in RNA sequence, including allele-specific expression and splice isoforms. At least three extreme situations can be directly interpreted to prioritize candidate disease-causing genes for a rare disorder. First, the expression level of a gene can lie outside its physiological range. Genes with expression outside their physical range can be identified as expression outliers, often using a stringent cutoff on expression variations, for instance using the Z-score 5 or statistics at the level of whole gene sets 6,7 . The genetic causes of such aberrant expression includes rare variants in the promoter 8 and enhancer but also in coding or intronic regions 5 . Second, RNA-seq can reveal extreme cases of allele-specific expression (mono-allelic expression (MAE)), whereby one allele is silenced, leaving only the other allele expressed. When assuming a recessive mode of inheritance, genes with a single heterozygous rare coding variant identified by WES or WGS analysis are not prioritized. However, MAE of such variants fits the recessive mode of inheritance assumption. Detection of MAE can thus help re-prioritizing heterozygous rare variants. Reasons for MAE can be genetic. A pilot study validated compound heterozygous variants within one gene as cause of TAR syndrome, where one allele is deleted and the other harbours a non-coding variant that reduces expression 9 . MAE can also have epigenetic causes such as X-chromosome inactivation or imprinting on autosomal genes, possibly by random choice 10,11 . Third, splicing of a gene can be affected. Aberrant splicing has long been recognized as a major cause of Mendelian disorders (reviewed in refs 12-14). However, the prediction of splicing defects from genetic sequence is difficult because splicing involves a complex set of cis-regulatory elements that are not yet fully understood. Some of them can be deeply located in intronic sequences 15 and are thus not covered by WES. Hence, direct probing of splice isoforms by RNA-seq is important, and has led to the discovery of multiple splicing defects based on single gene studies: skipping of multiple exons (exon 45-55) 16 and creation of a new exon by a deep intronic variant in DMD 17 , intron retention in LMNA caused by a 5 0 splice site variant 18 , and skipping of exon 7 in SMN1 caused by a variant in a splicing factor binding site 19 . Altogether, RNA-seq promises to be an important complementary tool to facilitate molecular diagnosis of rare genetic disorders. However, no systematic study to date has been conducted to assess its power.With RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), limitations of the sole genetic information can be complemented by directly probing variations in RNA abundance and in RNA sequence, including allele-specific expression and splice isoforms.

        <p>We considered investigating the power of RNA-sequencing for molecular diagnosis with a panel of patients diagnosed with a mitochondrial disorder for three reasons. First, mitochondrial diseases collectively represent one of the most frequent inborn errors of metabolism affecting 2 in 10,000 individuals 20 . Second, the broad range of unspecific clinical symptoms and the genetic diversity in mitochondrial diseases makes molecular diagnosis difficult and WES often results in VUS. As a consequence of the bi-genomic control of the energy-generating oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system, mitochondrial diseases may result from pathogenic mutations of the mitochondrial DNA or nuclear genome. More than 1,500 different nuclear genes encode mitochondrial proteins 21 and causal defects have been identified in B300 genes and presumably more additional disease-associated genes still awaiting identification 22 . Third, since the diagnosis often relies on biochemical testing of a tissue sample, fibroblast cell lines are usually available from those patients. Moreover, for many patients, the disease mechanisms can be assayed in epidermal fibroblast cell lines even though the disease may manifest in different tissues 23 . This allows rapid demonstration of the necessary and sufficient role of candidate variants by perturbation and complementation assays 24 . This also indicates that disease-causing expression defects, if any, should be detectable in these cell lines.We considered investigating the power of RNA-sequencing for molecular diagnosis with a panel of patients diagnosed with a mitochondrial disorder for three reasons.

        <p>Here, we establish an analysis pipeline to systematically detect RNA defects to complement genome-based molecular diagnosis. We find a median of one aberrantly expressed gene, five aberrant splicing events and six mono-allelically expressed rare variants in patient-derived fibroblasts and establish disease-causing roles for each kind. This leads to the molecular diagnosis of 10% of undiagnosed mitochondriopathy patients (5 out of 48) and yields candidate genes for 36 other patients. Systematic analysis of private exons shows that these often occur at locations where splicing is detectable at basal level in the population, providing an important clue for variant prioritization. Altogether, our study expands the tools for interpreting non-exonic variants and accelerating the genetic diagnosis of rare disorders.Here, we establish an analysis pipeline to systematically detect RNA defects to complement genome-based molecular diagnosis.

        <p>RNA sequencing on patient-derived fibroblasts. We performed RNA-seq on 105 fibroblast cell lines from patients with a suspected mitochondrial disease including 48 patients for which WES based variant prioritization did not yield a genetic diagnosis (Fig. 1, Methods section, Supplementary Table 1). After discarding lowly expressed genes, RNA-seq identified 12,680 transcribed genes (at least 10 reads in 5% of all samples, Methods section, Supplementary Data 1). We systematically prioritized genes with the following three strategies: (i) genes with aberrant expression level [6][7][8] , (ii) genes with aberrant splicing 17,25 and (iii) MAE of rare variants 9 (Fig. 1) to estimate their disease association. All strategies are based on the comparison of one patient against the rest. We assumed the causal defects to differ between patients, which is reasonable for mitochondrial disorders with a diversity of B300 known disease-causing genes (Supplementary Data 2). Therefore, the patients serve as good controls for each other.RNA sequencing on patient-derived fibroblasts.

        <p>Once normalized for technical biases, sex and biopsy site (Supplementary Method 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1), the samples typically presented few aberrantly expressed genes (median of 1, 90% of the samples with o10, Fig. 2a, Supplementary Data 3) with a large effect (|Z-score|43) and significant differential expression (Hochberg adjusted P valueo0.05). Among the most aberrantly expressed genes across all samples, we found 2 genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, MGST1 (one case) and TIMMDC1 (two cases) to be significantly down-regulated (Fig. 2b-d and Supplementary Fig. 2). For both genes, WES did not identify any variants in the respective patients, no variant is reported to be disease-associated and no case of potential bi-allelic rare variant is listed in our in-house database comprising more than 1,200 whole-exomes from mitochondrial patients and more than 15,000 whole-exomes available to us from different ongoing research projects. To evaluate the consequences of diminished RNA expression at the protein level, we performed quantitative proteomics in a total of 31 fibroblast cell lines (including these three patients, and further 17 undiagnosed and 11 diagnosed patients, Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Data 4 and 5, Supplementary Methods 2-5) from a second aliquot of cells taken at the same time as the RNA-seq aliquot. Normalized RNA and protein expression levels showed a median rank correlation of 0.59, comparable to what has been previously reported 26,27 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Patient #73804 showed B2% of control MGST1 level whilst the lack of detection of TIMMDC1 in both patients (#35791 and #66744) confirmed an even stronger effect on protein expression, indicating loss of function (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 4). MGST1, a microsomal glutathione S-transferase, is involved in the oxidative stress defense 28 . Consequently, the loss of expression of MGST1 is not only a likely cause of the disease of this patient, who suffers from an infantile-onset neurodegenerative disorder similar to a recently published case with another defect in the reactive oxygen species defense system (Supplementary Fig. 4, Supplementary Note 1) 29 , but also suggests a treatment with antioxidants. Both TIMMDC1 patients presented with muscular hypotonia, developmental delay and neurological deterioration, which led to death in the first 3 years of life (Supplementary Note 1). Consistent with the described function of TIMMDC1 as a respiratory chain complex I assembly factor 30,31 , we found isolated complex I deficiency in muscle (Supplementary Fig. 2), and globally decreased levels of complex I subunits in fibroblasts by quantitative proteomics (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 2) and western blot (Fig. 2f, Supplementary Fig. 10). Re-expression of TIMMDC1 in these cells increased complex I subunit levels (Fig. 2f). These results not only validate TIMMDC1-deficiency as disease causing but also provide compelling evidence for an important function of TIMMDC1 in complex I assembly.Once normalized for technical biases, sex and biopsy site (Supplementary Method 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1), the samples typically presented few aberrantly expressed genes (median of 1, 90% of the samples with o10, Fig. 2a, Supplementary Data 3) with a large effect (|Z-score|43) and significant differential expression (Hochberg adjusted P valueo0.05).

        <p>Aberrant splicing. We identified aberrant splicing events by testing for differential splicing in each patient against the others, using an annotation-free algorithm able to detect splice sites de novo (Methods section, median of 5 abnormal events per sample, 90% with o16, Fig. 3a). Among the 175 aberrant spliced genes detected in the undiagnosed patients, the most abundant events were, apart from differential expression of isoforms, exon skipping followed by the creation of new exons (Fig. 3b). Two genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, TIMMDC1 and CLPP, which were among the 20 most significant genes, caught our attention (Supplementary Data 6). Out of 136 exon-junction reads overlapping the acceptor site of CLPP exon 6 for patient #58955, 82 (per cent spliced in ref. 32, C ¼ 60%) skipped exon 5, and 14 (C ¼ 10%) showed a 3 0 -truncated exon 5, in striking contrast to other samples (Fig. 3c). The likely genetic cause of these two splice defects is a rare homozygous variant in exon 5 of CLPP affecting the last nucleotide of exon 5 (c.661G4A, p.Glu221Lys 1.2 Â 10 À 5 frequency in the ExAC database 33 , Supplementary Fig. 5).

The approach we followed started with RNA-seq of fibroblasts from unsolved WES patients. Three strategies to facilitate diagnosis were pursued: Detection of aberrant expression (for example, depletion), aberrant splicing (for example, exon creation) and MAE of the alternative allele (for example, A as alternative allele). Candidates were validated by proteomic measurements, lentiviral transduction of the wild-type (wt) allele or, in particular cases, by specific metabolic supplementation.No genetic diagnosis after exome sequencing Figure 1 | Strategy for genetic diagnosis using RNA-seq.

Our WES variant filtering reported this variant as a VUS and classified CLPP as one among 30 other potentially bi-allelic affected candidate genes (Supplementary Data 7). Since the variant was of unknown significance, the patient remained without genetic diagnosis. The loss of function found by RNA-seq and confirmed by western blotting now highlights clinical relevance of the variant within CLPP. CLPP encodes a mitochondrial ATP-dependent endopeptidase 34 and CLPP-deficiency causes Perrault syndrome 35,36 (OMIM #601119) which is overlapping with the clinical presentation of the patient investigated here including microcephaly, deafness and severe psychomotor retardation (Supplementary Note 1).

        <p>Split read distribution indicated that both TIMMDC1-deficient patients expressed almost exclusively a TIMMDC1 isoform with a new exon in intron 5 (Fig. 3d). This new exon introduces a frameshift yielding a premature stop codon (p.Gly199_Thr200ins5*, Fig. 3e). Moreover, this new exon contained a rare variant (c.596 þ 2146A4G) not listed in the 1,000 Genomes Project 2,3 (validated by Sanger sequencing, Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Method 6). WGS demonstrated that this variant is homozygous in both patients (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Method 7), the only rare variant in this intron and close to the splice site ( þ 6 of the new exon). We could not identify any rare variant in the promoter region or in any intron-exon boundary of TIMMDC1. Additionally, when testing six prediction tools for splicing events, this deep intronic rare variant is predicted by

            <rs type="software">SplicePort</rs> 39 (Feature generation algorithm score 0.112 and 1.308, respectively) this emphasizes the influence of this variant in the creation of the new exon. Besides, the four other tools predicted no significant change in splicing [40][41][42][43] .

In this family three affected siblings presented with similar clinical symptoms although without a diagnosis of a mitochondrial disorder (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. 2). Two siblings died before the age of 10. A younger brother (#96687), now 6 years of age, presented with muscle hypotonia, failure to thrive and neurological impairment (Supplementary Note 1), similar to the patients described above.

        <p>In almost all non-TIMMDC1-deficiency samples, we noticed a few split reads supporting inclusion of the new exon (Fig. 3d), consistent with an earlier report that many cryptic splice sites are not entirely repressed but active at low levels 44 . We set out to quantify this phenomenon and to interrogate the frequency of private exons originating from weakly spliced exons, independent of their possible association with disease. Consequently, we modelled the distribution of C for the 1,603,042 splicing events detected genome-wide in 105 samples as a mixture of three components. The model classified splicing frequencies per splice site as strong (20%, with C45.3%), weak (16%, with 0.16%oCo5.3%), or background (64%, with Co0.16%, Methods section, Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 6). Strikingly, the majority (70%, 4.4-fold more than by chance) of the 17 discovered private exons originated from weak splice sites (Fig. 3f,bottom). These data confirm that weakly spliced cryptic exons are loci more susceptible to turn into strongly spliced sites than other intronic regions. These weak splicing events are usually dismissed as 'noise' since they are only supported by few reads in a given sample. Our analysis shows that they can be detected as accumulation points across multiple individuals. Hence, these results suggest that the prioritization of deep intronic VUSs gained through WGS could be improved by annotating weak splice sites and their resulting cryptic exons.In almost all non-TIMMDC1-deficiency samples, we noticed a few split reads supporting inclusion of the new exon (Fig. 3d), consistent with an earlier report that many cryptic splice sites are not entirely repressed but active at low levels 44 .

In median per sample, 35,521 heterozygous SNVs were detected by WES, of which 7,622 were sufficiently covered by RNA-seq to call MAE (more than 10 reads), 20 showed MAE (Hochberg adjusted P valueo0.05, allele frequency Z0.8), of which 6 were rare variants (minor allele frequencyo0.001, Methods section, Fig. 4a, 90% of the samples had o12 MAE of rare variants). Amongst the 18 rare mono-allelic expressed variants in patient #80256 was a VUS in ALDH18A1 (c.1864C4T, p.Arg622Trp, Fig. 4b), encoding an enzyme involved in mitochondrial proline metabolism 45 . This VUS had been seen in WES compound heterozygous with a nonsense variant (c.1988C4A, p.Ser663*, Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 7). Variants in ALDH18A1 had been reported to be associated with cutis laxa III (OMIM #138250) 46,47 , yet the patient did not present cutis laxa. Because of this inconsistent phenotype and the unknown significance of the non-synonymous variant, the variants in ALDH18A1 were not regarded as disease causing. However, RNA-seq-based aberrant expression (Supplementary Fig. 7) and MAE analysis prioritized ALDH18A1 again. Validation by quantitative proteomics revealed severe reduction down to B2% ALDH18A1 (Fig. 4c), indicating that the rare MAE variant affects translation or protein stability. Metabolomics profile of blood plasma was in accordance with a defect in proline metabolism (Fig. 4d, Supplementary Method 8) and the following changes in urea cycle. Patient fibroblasts showed a growth defect that was rescued by supplementation of proline, validating impaired proline metabolism as the underlying molecular cause (Fig. 4e). Our experimental evidence strongly suggests that the two observed variants are pathogenic. Finally, a recent report 48 on ALDH18A1 patients extended the phenotypic spectrum to spastic paraplegia without cutis laxa (OMIM #138250). Spastic paraplegia resembles the symptoms of our patient (Supplementary Note 1), which validates these ALDH18A1 mutations as disease-causing.Mono-allelic expression.

        <p>In another patient (#62346) we found borderline non-significant low expression of MCOLN1 with 10 out of 11 reads expressing an intronic VUS (c.681-19A4C, Fig. 4f). This intronic variant was detected as part of a retained intron, which introduced a nonsense codon (p. Lys227_Leu228ins16*, Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 8). When looking at the WES data we could additionally identify a heterozygous nonsense variant (c.832C4T, p.Gln278*). The allele with the exonic nonsense mutation was not expressed, most likely due to nonsense-mediated decay. Mutations in MCOLN1 are associated with mucolipidosis (OMIM #605248). The symptoms of the patient were initially suggestive for mucolipidosis, but none of the enzymatic tests available for mucolipidosis types 1, 2 and 3 revealed an enzyme deficiency in blood leucocytes (Supplementary Note 1). Moreover, MCOLN1 was missed by our WES variant filter since the intronic variant was not prioritized. Hence, the WES data could not be conclusive about MCOLN1. In contrast, the RNA-seq data demonstrated two loss-of-function alleles in MCOLN1 and therefore established the genetic diagnosis.In another patient (#62346) we found borderline non-significant low expression of MCOLN1 with 10 out of 11 reads expressing an intronic VUS (c.681-19A4C, Fig. 4f).

        <p>RNA defects in exome-diagnosed patients. Here, we included genetically diagnosed patients in our RNA-seq analysis pipeline to increase the power for the detection of aberrant expression and aberrant splicing in fibroblast cell lines. However, when evaluating the results for 40 diagnosed cases with WES and RNA-seq available (Supplementary Table 1), aberrant splicing detected 7 out of 8 cases with a causal splicing variant, MAE recovered 3 out of 6 patients with heterozygous missense variants compound with a stop or frameshift variant, and aberrant expression recovered 3 out of 4 homozygous stop variants. Counter-intuitively, only one of the 9 frame-shift variants did lead to a detectable RNA defect, that is, MAE of a near splice site intronic variant within a retained intron. The partial recovery of stop and frameshift variants may reflect incomplete nonsense mediated decay. For none of the 14 genes where missense variants were disease causing, a RNA defect could be detected with our pipeline. This is expected, since missense variants more likely affect protein function rather than RNA expression (Supplementary Table 2).RNA defects in exome-diagnosed patients.

        <p>Altogether, our study demonstrates the utility of RNA-seq in combination with bioinformatics filtering criteria for molecular diagnosis by (i) discovering a new disease-associated gene, (ii) providing a diagnosis for 10% (5 of 48) of undiagnosed cases and (iii) identifying a limited number of strong candidates. We established a pipeline for the detection of aberrant expression, aberrant splicing and MAE of rare variants, that is able to detect significant outliers, with a median of 1, 5 and 6, respectively. Overall, for 36 patients our pipeline provides a strong candidate gene, that is, a known disease-causing or mitochondrial proteinencoding gene, like MGST1 (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Data 7). This manageable amount, similar to the median number of 16 genes with rare potentially bi-allelic variants detected by WES, allows manual inspection and validation by disease experts. While filtering by frequency is highly efficient when focusing on the coding region, frequency filtering is not as effective for intronic or intergenic variants identified by WGS. The loss-of-function character observed on RNA level thus improved interpretation of VUS identified by genotyping.Altogether, our study demonstrates the utility of RNA-seq in combination with bioinformatics filtering criteria for molecular diagnosis by (i) discovering a new disease-associated gene, (ii) providing a diagnosis for 10% (5 of 48) of undiagnosed cases and (iii) identifying a limited number of strong candidates.

        <p>We focused our analysis on one sample preparation pipeline, which has several advantages. Based on our experience, expression outliers can only reliably be detected after extensive normalization process. This needs information about all technical details starting from the biopsy, growth of the cells, to the RNA extraction and library preparation. Usually not all this information is available in published data sets. For detecting aberrant splicing such as new exons, we would recommend not to mix different tissues because splicing can be tissue-specific. MAE is the most robust of all criteria in this respect because it only relies on read counts within a sample. Overall, we recommend not relying on a single sample being compared to public RNA-seq data sets. Instead, RNA-seq should be included in the pipeline of diagnostic centres to generate matching controls over time. The situation is similar for whole exome and WGS, where the control for platform-specific biases is important.We focused our analysis on one sample preparation pipeline, which has several advantages.

        <p>To our surprise, many newly diagnosed cases were caused by a defective splicing event, which caused loss of function (Fig. 5b), confirming the increasing recognition of the role of splicing defects in both Mendelian 49,50 and common disorders 25 . In the case of TIMMDC1, the causal variant was intronic, and thus not covered by WES. Even when detected by WGS, such deep intronic variants are difficult to prioritize from the sequence information alone. Here, we showed that RNA-seq of large cohorts can provide important information about intronic positions that are particularly susceptible to affect splicing when mutated. We showed that private exons often arise from loci with weak splicing of B1%. This suggests that rare variants affecting such cryptic splice sites are more likely to affect splicing and that these can be detected as positions with low yet consistent splicing. We reason that analysis of a RNA-seq compendium of healthy donors across multiple tissues such as GTEx (ref. 51) could provide tissue-specific maps of cryptic splice sites useful for prioritizing intronic variants.To our surprise, many newly diagnosed cases were caused by a defective splicing event, which caused loss of function (Fig. 5b), confirming the increasing recognition of the role of splicing defects in both Mendelian 49,50 and common disorders 25 .

        <p>Genetic disorders typically show specificity to some tissues, some of which might not be easily accessible for RNA-sequencing. It is therefore natural to question whether transcriptome sequencing of an unaffected tissue can help diagnosis. Here, we performed RNA-seq on patient derived dermal fibroblast cell lines. The fibroblast cell lines are the byproducts of muscle biopsies routinely undertaken in the clinic to biochemically diagnose mitochondrial disorders with enzymatic assays. By using fibroblast cell lines we overcome the limited accessibility of the affected tissues, which in the case of mitochondrial disorders are often high energy demanding tissues like brain, heart, skeletal muscle or liver. It turns out that many genes with a mitochondrial function are expressed in most tissues 52 , including fibroblasts. Hence, extreme regulatory defects such as loss of expression or aberrant splicing of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins can be detected in fibroblasts, even though the physiological consequence on fibroblasts might be negligible. This property might be true for other diseases: the tissue-specific physiological consequence of a variant does not necessarily stem from tissue-specific expression of the gene harbouring the variant. In many cases, tissue-specificity might be due to environmental or cellular context, or from tissue-specific expression of further genes. Hence, tissue-specificity does not preclude RNA-seq of unaffected tissues from revealing the causative defect for a large number of patients. Moreover, non-affected tissues have the advantage that the regulatory consequences on other genes are limited and therefore the causal defects are more likely to stand out as outliers 53 .Genetic disorders typically show specificity to some tissues, some of which might not be easily accessible for RNA-sequencing.

        <p>Despite a few differences in the approach (expression outliers were not looked for, only samples of the affected tissues were considered and using samples of healthy donors as controls), the results are in line with ours whereby aberrant splicing also turns out to be a frequent disease-causing event. The success rate was even higher (35%), possibly because the diagnostic rate of primary muscle disorders is higher than for mitochondrial disorders. Also, in this case the affected tissue was always accessible and could be profiled. Therefore the chances were higher that the affected gene is expressed. Altogether, this complementary study confirms the relevance of using RNA-seq for diagnosis of Mendelian disorders.Despite a few differences in the approach (expression outliers were not looked for, only samples of the affected tissues were considered and using samples of healthy donors as controls), the results are in line with ours whereby aberrant splicing also turns out to be a frequent disease-causing event.

The significant splice events (Hochberg adjusted P valueo0.05) detected in the undiagnosed patients were visually classified as exon skipping, exon truncation, exon elongation, new exon, complex splicing (any other splicing event or a combination of the aforementioned ones) and false positives (n ¼ 73, Fig. 3b). However, due to LeafCutter's restriction to split reads it is difficult to detect intron retention events, since no split-read is present in a perfect intron-retention scenario.

        <p>For further analysis, only reads spanning a splice junction, so called split reads, were extracted with a mapping quality of 410 to reduce the false-positive rate due to mapping issues. Each splice site was annotated as belonging to the start or end of a known exon or to be entirely new. For the reference exon annotation the GENCODE release 24 based on GRCh37 was used 67 . The per cent spliced in (C) values 32 for the 3 0 and 5 0 sites were calculated as:For further analysis, only reads spanning a splice junction, so called split reads, were extracted with a mapping quality of 410 to reduce the false-positive rate due to mapping issues.

        <p>Classification of splice sites into background, weak and strong was done by modelling the distribution of the C 5 and C 3 -values with three components. Identifiability of the three components was facilitated by considering three groups of junctions depending on previous annotation of splice sites: 'no side is annotated', 'one side is annotated' and 'both sides are annotated'. Specifically, the number of split reads n(D, A) of a junction conditioned on the total number of reads N(D, A) ¼ S A 0 n (D, A 0 ), for C 5 , and N (D, A) ¼ S D 0 n (D 0 , A), for C 3 , was modelled as:Classification of splice sites into background, weak and strong was done by modelling the distribution of the C 5 and C 3 -values with three components.

Hence, the components were modelled to have the same parameters a c , b c in all three groups but their mixing proportions p s,c to be group-specific. Fitting was performed using the expectation-maximization algorithm. For the initial step, the data points were classified as background (Co0.001), weak spliced (Co0.1) and canonical (C4 ¼ 0.1). After convergence of the clustering the obtained parameters were used to estimate the probability for each junction side to belong to a given class.where c is the component index, s the number of annotated sites and BetaBin the beta-binomial distribution.

        <p>Detection of mono-allelic expression. For MAE analysis only heterozygous single-nucleotide variants with only one alternative allele detected from exome sequencing data were used. The same quality filters were used as mentioned in the exome sequencing part, but no frequency filter was applied. To get allele counts from RNA-seq for the remaining variants the function pileLettersAt from the

            <rs type="software">Bioconductor</rs> package 
            <rs type="software">GenomicAlignments</rs> 62 was used. The data were further filtered for variants with coverage of at least 10 reads on the transcriptome. The 
            <rs type="software">DESeq2</rs> package 63,64 was applied on the final variant set to estimate the significance of the allele-specific expression. Allele-specific expression was estimated on each heterozygous variant independently of others (that is, without phasing the variants). For each sample, a generalized linear model was fitted with the contrast of the coverage of one allele against the coverage of the other alleles. Specifically, we modelled K i,j the number of reads of variant i in sample j as:
        </p>
        <p>Where NB is the negative binomial distribution; the dispersion parameter a was fixed for all variants to a ¼ 0.05, which is approximately the average dispersion over all samples based on the gene-wise analysis; s j is the size factor of each condition; b 0 i is the intercept parameter for variant i. The value of x allele i;j is 1 for the alternative alleles and 0 otherwise. The resulting b allele i represents the log 2 -fold changes for the alternative allele against the reference allele. The independent filtering by 
            <rs type="software">DESeq2</rs> was disabled (independentFiltering ¼ FALSE) to keep the coverage outliers among the results. To classify a variant as mono-allelically expressed a cutoff of b condition i ! 2 was used, which corresponds to an allele frequency Z0.8, and we filtered Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P values to be o0.05.
