        <p>Klebsiella pneumoniae is a growing cause of healthcare-associated infections for which multi-drug resistance is a concern. Its polysaccharide capsule is a major virulence determinant and epidemiological marker. However, little is known about capsule epidemiology since serological typing is not widely accessible and many isolates are serologically non-typeable. Molecular typing techniques provide useful insights, but existing methods fail to take full advantage of the information in whole genome sequences. We investigated the diversity of the capsule synthesis loci (K-loci) among 2503 K. pneumoniae genomes. We incorporated analyses of full-length K-locus nucleotide sequences and also clustered protein-encoding sequences to identify, annotate and compare K-locus structures. We propose a standardized nomenclature for K-loci and present a curated reference database. A total of 134 distinct K-loci were identified, including 31 novel types. Comparative analyses indicated 508 unique protein-encoding gene clusters that appear to reassort via homologous recombination. Extensive intra-and inter-locus nucleotide diversity was detected among the wzi and wzc genes, indicating that current molecular typing schemes based on these genes are inadequate. As a solution, we introduce 
            <rs type="software">Kaptive</rs>, a novel software tool that automates the process of identifying K-loci based on full locus information extracted from whole genome sequences (
            <rs type="url">https:// github.com/katholt/Kaptive)</rs>. This work highlights the extensive diversity of Klebsiella K-loci and the proteins that they encode. The nomenclature, reference database and novel typing method presented here will become essential resources for genomic surveillance and epidemiological investigations of this pathogen.

        <p>Klebsiella pneumoniae and its close relatives, Klebsiella variicola and Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, are opportunistic pathogens recognized as a significant threat to global health. Antimicrobial resistance, particularly multi-drug resistance and resistance to the carbapenems, is a major concern. Notably, there are a number of globally distributed, multidrug resistant clones that cause outbreaks of healthcareassociated infections (Munoz-Price et al., 2013;The et al., 2015).Klebsiella pneumoniae and its close relatives, Klebsiella variicola and Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, are opportunistic pathogens recognized as a significant threat to global health.

        <p>In order to control the emerging threat of K. pneumoniae sensu stricto, K. variicola and K. quasipneumoniae (hereafter collectively called Kp), there is an urgent requirement for genome-based surveillance. Recent advances in understanding population structure (Bialek-Davenet et al., 2014;Holt et al., 2015) highlight immense genomic diversity and provide a framework for tracking this pathogen. Useful strategies involve analyses of lineages or multi-locus sequence types in combination with resistance and virulence gene characterization (Bialek-Davenet et al., 2014), or phylogenetic analysis for outbreak investigation (Snitkin et al., 2012;The et al., 2015). However, reliable methods for tracking Kp capsular variation are currently lacking.In order to control the emerging threat of K. pneumoniae sensu stricto, K. variicola and K. quasipneumoniae (hereafter collectively called Kp), there is an urgent requirement for genome-based surveillance.

        <p>The polysaccharide capsule is the outermost layer of the Kp cell, protecting the bacterium from desiccation, phage and protist predation (March et al., 2013;Whitfield, 2006). The capsule is also a key virulence determinant. In contrast to capsulated strains, isogenic non-capsulated strains are unable to cause disease in murine infection models (Cortés et al., 2002;Lawlor et al., 2005). In addition, the capsule has been shown to suppress the host inflammatory response (Yoshida et al., 2000), provide resistance to antimicrobial immune-peptides (Campos et al., 2004), complementmediated killing (Merino et al., 1992) and phagocytosis (Evrard et al., 2010;Lee et al., 2014;March et al., 2013). There are 77 immunologically distinct Klebsiella capsule types (K-types) defined by serology (Edmunds, 1954;Edwards &amp; Fife, 1952;Ørskov &amp; Fife-Asbury, 1977). However, serological typing requires specialist techniques and reagents not available to most microbiology laboratories, so is very rarely applied. Furthermore, 10-70 % of Kp isolates are serologically non-typeable, because either they express a novel capsule (common for clinical isolates) or they are non-capsulated (Cryz et al., 1986;Jenney et al., 2006;Tsay et al., 2002).The polysaccharide capsule is the outermost layer of the Kp cell, protecting the bacterium from desiccation, phage and protist predation (March et al., 2013;Whitfield, 2006).

        <p>Kp employ a Wzy-dependent capsule synthesis process (Rahn et al., 1999;Whitfield, 2006) for which the associated genes are in the capsule synthesis locus (K-locus), which is 10-30 kbp in length (Arakawa et al., 1995;Chuang et al., 2006;Fevre et al., 2011;Pan et al., 2008Pan et al., , 2015;;Shu et al., 2009). The K-locus includes a set of common genes in the terminal regions that encode the core capsule biosynthesis machinery (e.g. galF, wzi, wza, wzb, wzc, gnd and ugd). The central region is highly variable, encoding the capsule-specific sugar synthesis, processing and export proteins, plus the core assembly components Wzx (flippase) and Wzy (capsule repeat unit polymerase) (Pan et al., 2015). K-locus nucleotide sequences and annotations are now available for a large number of Kp isolates, including the 77 K-type reference strains (Chuang et al., 2006;Deleo et al., 2014;Follador et al., 2016;Pan et al., 2008Pan et al., , 2015;;Shu et al., 2009;The et al., 2015;Wyres et al., 2015). Serological Ktypes are generally defined by distinct sets of protein-encoding genes in the variable central region of the K-locus; however, two types (K22 and K37) are distinguished by a point mutation resulting in a premature stop codon that affects acetyltransferase function (Pan et al., 2015).Kp employ a Wzy-dependent capsule synthesis process (Rahn et al., 1999;Whitfield, 2006) for which the associated genes are in the capsule synthesis locus (K-locus), which is 10-30 kbp in length (Arakawa et al., 1995;Chuang et al., 2006;Fevre et al., 2011;Pan et al., 2008Pan et al., , 2015;;Shu et al., 2009).

        <p>Existing high-quality K-locus reference sequences.

A total of 12 additional K-locus sequences had been published prior to the K-type references (Chen et al., 2014;Deleo et al., 2014;The et al., 2015;Wyres et al., 2015); we have compared these loci to those of the 77 K-type references (Arakawa et al., 1995;Chuang et al., 2006;Fevre et al., 2011;Pan et al., 2008Pan et al., , 2015;;Shu et al., 2009) and identified 7 that were novel.

        <p>Identification of novel K-loci. In order to identify novel K-loci, we first classified each genome by similarity to previously known loci. 
            <rs type="software">BLASTN</rs> (Camacho et al., 2009) was used to search each genome assembly for sequences with similarity to those of annotated K-locus coding sequences (CDSs) usually located between galF and ugd inclusive (minimum coverage 80 %, minimum identity 50 %). Transposase CDSs present in the published K-locus reference sequences were excluded from this analysis since they are not K-locus specific. Up to three missing CDSs were tolerated for K-locus assignment, to allow for assembly problems and insertion sequence (IS) insertions (see the Supplementary Methods and Fig. S1). This approach successfully distinguished the 77 K-type reference loci (with the exception of K22 and K37).
        </p>
        <p>Genomes that could not be assigned a K-locus were investigated further: 
            <rs type="software">BLASTN</rs> was used to identify the galF and ugd genes within the assembly, and single contig loci were extracted. The assembly graph viewer 
            <rs type="software">Bandage</rs> (Wick et al., 2015) was used to identify K-loci that did not assemble on a single contig or where galF and/or ugd where missing. Loci were clustered, with identity and coverage thresholds of 90 %, using CD-HIT-EST (Fu et al., 2012;Li &amp; Godzik, 2006). A representative sequence from each cluster was annotated with PROKKA (Seemann, 2014), using all proteins in the 77 reference K-type loci as the primary annotation database. Novel K-locus sequences were deposited in GenBank (accession numbers LT603702-LT603735; also included in the Kaptive database at https://github.com/katholt/Kaptive/). Recombination in K-loci was investigated by aligning nucleotide sequences for the eight common genes (extracted from the reference annotations) using 
            <rs type="software">MUSCLE</rs> (Edgar, 2004). This generated a 9944 bp concatenated gene alignment that was used as input for maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic inference with 
            <rs type="software">RAxML</rs> (Stamatakis, 2006) (best scoring tree from five runs each of 1000 bootstrap replicates with gamma model of rate heterogeneity), and recombination analysis using 
            <rs type="software">ClonalFrameML</rs> (Didelot &amp; Wilson, 2015) (run for 1000 simulations and using the ML phylogeny as the starting tree). protein clusters present in three or more K-loci each (excluding the common proteins and the initiating glycosyltransferases, WbaP and WcaJ, n=115 clusters for analysis): pairwise Jaccard similarity scores were calculated as J (A, B) =A T B/A S B and were used to draw a weighted edge graph with the

A further 918 genomes were assigned to 1 of 25 previously published K-loci that are distinct from the K-type reference loci. Among the remaining 213 genomes, 106 were assigned to 29 novel K-loci, bringing the total to 132 (Table S1). Nine genomes harboured deletion or IS variants of known or novel loci (see below). For 93 genomes (3.7 %), no K-locus could be determined; however, we found three or more K-locus-associated genes in all such genomes and hypothesize the lack of assignment was attributable to low read depth and/or fragmented genome assembly rather than complete Klocus deletion.A total of 1371 genomes could be putatively assigned to 63 of the 77 K-type reference loci by the BLAST screening approach.

In comparison to that for the full genome set, the non-redundant curve better represents the true diversity of the Kp population. Note that neither reached the total number of known K-loci, since 13 of the serologically defined Kloci (Pan et al., 2015) were not represented in our 2503 genomes. The rarefaction curves for each of the three Klebsiella species within the non-redundant dataset were similar to one another, indicating comparable levels of capsule diversity within each species (Fig. 1).We estimated the extent to which we had captured the repertoire of K-locus diversity in the Kp population (Fig. 1).

Each distinct K-locus was designated as KL (K-locus) and a unique number. The K-type reference K-loci were assigned the same number as the corresponding K-type, e.g. K1 is encoded by the KL1 locus.

        <p>The genome collection studied here does not represent a systematic sample and, thus, is not appropriate for detailed exploration of epidemiological questions. However, it is of interest to note the following three points. (i) Among the non-redundant genome set (n=1081), 90 % of K-loci identified were represented by just 67 distinct types, suggesting that many K-loci are rare in the Kp population, while others are more common. The five most common K-loci accounted for 20 % of those identified (KL2 5 %, KL1 4 %, KL21 4 %, KL17 4 %, KL30 3 %; see Table S1). (ii) There is evidence that K-types are shared across environmental and source populations. Twenty-eight K-loci were identified among isolates from retail meats (chicken, pork and turkey) for which genomes were originally published by Davis et al. (2015), and we found all (100 %) of these K-loci among human infection isolates in our data set. A total of 37 distinct K-loci were identified for 51 isolates from bovine hosts in the Kp global diversity study (Holt et al., 2015), and we found 35 (94.6 %) of these among human isolates and 12 (32.4 %) among the retail meat isolates. (iii) Our data set included 644 genomes from the globally distributed, multidrug resistant clonal group 258, which was previously shown to contain extensive K-locus diversity (Bowers et al., 2015;Wyres et al., 2015). We identified a total of 32 distinct K-loci, plus 1 IS and 1 deletion variant amongst clonal group 258 genomes (Table S1). The most common K-loci were KL106 (n=125, 19.4 %) and KL107 (n=437, 67.9 %), which match the loci previously cited in the literature in association with wzi alleles 29 and 154, respectively (Bowers et al., 2015;Deleo et al., 2014;Wyres et al., 2015).The genome collection studied here does not represent a systematic sample and, thus, is not appropriate for detailed exploration of epidemiological questions.

        <p>The novel K-loci identified in this study conformed to the common structure described elsewhere (Fig. S3) (Pan et al., 2015;Rahn et al., 1999;Shu et al., 2009). We also identified six deletion variants: KL5-D1, KL20-D1, KL30-D1, KL62-D1, KL106-D1 and KL107-D1. Each of these was missing several common genes, but the remaining regions were homologous to existing K-loci represented in our genome collection. We suggest that the latter K-loci represent the ancestral forms that have subsequently lost one or more regions through deletion events; thus, generating the variants described here. Isolate NCTC10004 (recorded as serotype K11 in the UK National Collection of Type Cultures) and four other genomes carried K-loci that were nearly identical to the previously published K11 reference sequence (Pan et al., 2015). However, the latter lacked the essential wzx gene plus two other neighbouring genes, and was not identified among any other genomes. We assume the NCTC10004 locus represents the full length KL11 locus and designate the original K11 reference as KL11-D1 (it is unclear whether the original sequenced reference isolate had retained the ability to produce a capsule, since the serological typing was performed decades earlier) (Pan et al., 2015).The novel K-loci identified in this study conformed to the common structure described elsewhere (Fig. S3) (Pan et al., 2015;Rahn et al., 1999;Shu et al., 2009).

        <p>Of the other IS-related variants, KL157-1 contained an IS903 family IS without an obvious deletion. In addition, we identified two novel IS variants of K-type reference loci (KL15-1 and KL22-1) and five IS-free variants of K-type reference loci (KL3, KL6, KL38, KL57 and KL81), plus one other previously published K-locus (KL103). The KL22-1 locus included a translocation of part of the nearby lipopolysaccharide (LPS) locus to the centre of the K-locus, plus an inversion of the 3 ¢ K-locus region (Fig. 2). The translocated and inverted regions were bound at each end by a copy of ISKpn26.Of the other IS-related variants, KL157-1 contained an IS903 family IS without an obvious deletion.

        <p>We used 
            <rs type="software">ClonalFrameML</rs> (Didelot &amp; Wilson, 2015) to identify putative recombination events within the common K-locus genes. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences from each of the 134 reference K-loci identified a high number of such events (n=382), which were not distributed equally across the nucleotide alignment (Fig. 3a); rather the genes closest to the central variable region were affected by a greater number of recombination events compared to those at the ends of the locus.

        <p>A total of 2675 predicted proteins from 134 complete K-loci were clustered using CD-HIT (Fu et al., 2012;Li &amp; Godzik, 2006). As the identity threshold was reduced, the number of clusters continued to fall (from 1496 at 90 % identity to 508 at 40 % identity) and showed no signs of stabilizing (Fig. S4). At 40 % identity, which we believe is the lower bound for sensible comparison, the core capsule assembly proteins GalF, Wzi, Wza, Wzb, Gnd and Ugd each formed a single cluster and were present in nearly all loci (Fig. 3b). The Wzc sequences clustered into two groups and each locus encoded one Wzc protein (except KL50). In contrast, Wzx (flippase) clustered into 42 groups and Wzy (capsule repeat unit polymerase) clustered into 83 groups, highlighting the extreme diversity of these proteins compared to other core capsule assembly machinery proteins (Fig. 3c,d).A total of 2675 predicted proteins from 134 complete K-loci were clustered using CD-HIT (Fu et al., 2012;Li &amp; Godzik, 2006).

        <p>There were 374 clusters among the remaining proteins, most of which were associated with sugar synthesis and processing (Fig. 3). The initiating sugar transferase proteins, WbaP and WcaJ, were grouped into two clusters. These proteins are considered essential for capsule synthesis. Concordantly, each locus encoded a single protein from one of these two clusters. RmlB, RmlA, RmlD and RmlC, which are associated with rhamnose and typically encoded together in a single operon, were each represented by a single cluster. Similarly, the mannose synthesis and processing proteins, ManC and ManB, were grouped into a single cluster each. The associated operons rmlBADC and manCB were present in 55 and 73 K-loci, respectively (14 contained both operons; Fig. 3). In contrast, 360 of the remaining 366 protein clusters were present in fewer than ten K-loci each (Fig. 3e). Co-occurrence analysis identified 18 correlated groups of K-locus proteins, each comprising two to five protein clusters (pairwise Jaccard similarity !0.61 for all pairs in the group; Fig. 4, Table S5). One group included the four Rml protein clusters; interestingly, this group also included a WcaA glycosyltransferase, which was present in 67.3 % of rmlBADC-containing K-loci and no rmlBADC-negative loci ( 2 =70.09, P value &lt;2.2Â10 À16 , two-sided proportion test).There were 374 clusters among the remaining proteins, most of which were associated with sugar synthesis and processing (Fig. 3).

We confidently assigned wzi alleles to 2461 Kp genomes, including 390 distinct alleles, 218 of which were novel. Median pairwise nucleotide divergence was 7 %. Among the non-redundant genome set, there were 54 wzi alleles represented by at least five genomes, and of these 15 (28 %) were associated with more than one K-locus (Table S1).

This suggests that the K-locus is subject to strong diversifying selection. Given that these bacteria are not obligate pathogens and are ubiquitous in non-host-associated environments (Bagley, 1985;Podschun &amp; Ullmann, 1998), the factors driving selection may not be host immune pressures but may include phage and/or protist predation.The number of distinct Klebsiella K-loci (now 134) is striking and exceeds that described for K-loci in other bacterial species, such as A. baumannii and Streptococcus pneumoniae.

        <p>Two novel K-loci, plus the KL66 and KL74 loci, were identified from K. oxytoca, a close relative of Kp. Little is known about K. oxytoca capsules, but one previous report also identified several Kp-associated capsules among K. oxytoca isolates (Ishihara et al., 2012). These findings indicate that K. oxytoca is able to exchange genetic material with Kp and, thus, represents a potential reservoir of virulence and other genes.Two novel K-loci, plus the KL66 and KL74 loci, were identified from K. oxytoca, a close relative of Kp.

        <p>Our analysis confirms there are strong constraints on the structure of K-loci (Fig. 3). However, our data also reveal the extensive diversity of proteins encoded in the variable central region. The associated genes ranged in frequency from 0.7 to 54.7 % of the K-loci. Among those represented in at least three loci, approximately half co-occurred in groups ranging from two to five genes. molecular evolution driving K-locus diversification is not well understood, but likely includes a combination of point mutation, IS-mediated rearrangements and homologous recombination within the locus. In A. baumannii (Holt et al., 2016;Schultz et al., 2016) and S. pneumoniae (Wyres et al., 2013), it has been shown that recombination within the K-locus can drive capsule exchange between distinct clones. We recently speculated that this may also be true for Kp (Wyres et al., 2015) and the recombination analysis presented here supports this theory. The genes closest to the central variable region of the K-locus (i.e. wzb, wzc and gnd) showed evidence of the greatest number of recombination events, consistent with the hypothesis that they act as regions of homology for recombination events that shuffle the central region of the locus.Our analysis confirms there are strong constraints on the structure of K-loci (Fig. 3).

        <p>Prediction of capsule phenotypes from genome data is complex, as capsule expression is highly regulated and involves genes outside the K-locus region (Hsu et al., 2011). However, it is likely that K-loci encoding distinct sets of proteins are associated with distinct phenotypes, as is the case for the vast majority of K-type reference strains (Pan et al., 2015). Therefore, our data suggest that there are at least 134 distinct Klebsiella K-types. This is a lower bound estimate, particularly because our analysis did not capture differences that may arise from point mutations and small-scale insertions or deletions [e.g. in the case of K22 and K37, described by Pan et al. (2015)]. Furthermore, while we did not attempt to thoroughly characterize IS variants, several were apparent. The potential functional impacts of IS insertions likely depend on their location in the locus, but may include up-regulation, loss of capsule production or more subtle changes in sugar structures (Bentley et al., 2006;Hsu et al., 2016;Salter et al., 2012;Uria et al., 2008).Prediction of capsule phenotypes from genome data is complex, as capsule expression is highly regulated and involves genes outside the K-locus region (Hsu et al., 2011).

        <p>Serological typing of Klebsiella isolates is notoriously difficult and rarely performed. We were able to compare genotypes (whole-locus typing using Kaptive, as well as wzi and wzc typing schemes) with phenotypes for just 86 isolates for which both sequences and serotypes were available. Of the 19 discordant genotype versus phenotype results, 2 were due to deletion variants and were resolved by running Kaptive with the K-locus variants database. Interestingly, one of Downloaded from www.microbiologyresearch.org by IP: 194.80.229.244 On: Sun, 03 Jun 2018 16:53:41 these isolates was non-typeable by serology, wzi or wzc typing, but recognized as a specific K-locus deletion variant by Kaptive. This highlights a benefit of our whole-locus typing approach; it provides epidemiologically relevant information even when the K-locus is interrupted. Another isolate was serologically typed as K54 but genotyped by Kaptive as KL113, which has sequence homology with KL54 (&gt;84 % nucleotide identity over 76 % of the locus) and may encode a serologically similar or cross-reacting capsule. The other cases of discordance had no obvious explanation and may result from serological typing errors or from mutations arising during subculture (as identified for the K11 reference isolate above), neither of which we were able to check. Some discordance may also be due to unpredictable serological cross-reactions.Serological typing of Klebsiella isolates is notoriously difficult and rarely performed.

        <p>Given the problems with serotyping and the comparative robustness and widespread access to genome sequencing, we anticipate that genotyping will remain the preferred method for tracking capsular diversity in Klebsiella. Due to the extensive diversity and potential for ongoing evolution, we strongly advocate for classification based on complete, or near complete K-locus sequences, rather than single genes such as wzi or wzc, which can be misleading due to substitutions and horizontal gene transfer such as that described in this work. Kaptive analyses the full-length K-locus nucleotide sequence and assesses the presence of all K-locus-associated genes by protein 
            <rs type="software">BLAST</rs> search; thus, the approach is resilient to spurious results that may arise due to sequence divergence. Furthermore, the information provided allows users to determine confidence in the results and to identify putative novel K-loci or variants of known loci if desired. Along with the curated reference databases, this new tool will greatly facilitate evolutionary investigations and genomic surveillance efforts for Kp and other bacterial pathogens.

            <rs type="software">KAPTIVE</rs> Fig. 7. Summary of the Kaptive analysis procedure. 
            <rs type="software">Kaptive</rs> takes as input a set of annotated reference K-loci in GenBank format and one or more genome assemblies, each as a single FASTA file of contigs. 
            <rs type="software">Kaptive</rs> performs a series of 
            <rs type="software">BLAST</rs> searches to identify the best-match K-locus in the query genome and assess the presence of genes annotated in the best-match locus (expected genes) and those annotated in other loci (unexpected genes) both within and outside the putative K-locus region of the query assembly. The output is a FASTA file containing the nucleotide sequence(s) of the K-locus region(s) for each query assembly and a table summarizing the best-match locus, gene content and potential problems with the match (e.g. the assembly K-locus region is fragmented, expected genes are missing from the Klocus region or at low identity, or unexpected genes are present) for each query assembly. For the user's convenience, 
            <rs type="software">Kaptive</rs> will also use 
            <rs type="software">BLASTN</rs> to find and report the best match wzi and wzc allele sequences, as defined in the Kp BIGSdb (not shown in schematic).
