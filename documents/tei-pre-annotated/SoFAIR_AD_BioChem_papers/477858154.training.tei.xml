        <p>To date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and analyses of Metabochip and exome arrays have identified more than 120 loci associated with glycemic traits in individuals without diabetes [7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] . However, despite considerable differences in the prevalence of T2D risk factors across ancestries [16][17][18] , most GWAS of glycemic traits have insufficient representation of individuals of non-European ancestry. Additionally, they have limited resolution for fine-mapping of causal variants and for the identification of effector transcripts. Here we present large-scale trans-ancestry meta-analyses of GWAS for four glycemic traits in individuals without diabetes. We aimed to identify additional glycemic-trait-associated loci; investigate the portability of loci and genetic scores across ancestries; leverage differences in effect allele frequency (EAF), effect size and linkage disequilibrium (LD) across diverse populations to conduct fine-mapping and aid the identification of causal variants and/or effector transcripts; and compare the genetic architecture of glycemic traits to further identify the cell types and target tissues that are influenced the most by the traits that inform T2D pathophysiology.To date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and analyses of Metabochip and exome arrays have identified more than 120 loci associated with glycemic traits in individuals without diabetes [7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] .

        <p>Study design and definitions. To identify loci associated with glycemic traits (FG, 2hGlu, FI and HbA1c), we aggregated GWAS in up to 281,416 individuals without diabetes, approximately 30% of whom were of non-European ancestry (13% East Asian, 7% Hispanic, 6% African American, 3% South Asian and 2% sub-Saharan African (Ugandan data were only available for HbA1c)). Each cohort imputed data to the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel 19 (phase 1 v.3, March 2012 or later; Methods, Supplementary Table 1, Extended Data Fig. 1, Supplementary Note). Up to around 49.3 million variants were directly genotyped or imputed, with between 38.6 million (2hGlu) and 43.5 million variants (HbA1c) available for analysis after exclusions based on minor allele count (MAC) &lt; 3 and imputation quality (imputation r 2 or INFO score &lt; 0.40) in each cohort. FG, 2hGlu and FI analyses were adjusted for body-mass index (BMI) 15 but for simplicity they are abbreviated as FG, 2hGlu and FI (Methods).Study design and definitions.

        <p>We first performed trait-specific fixed-effect meta-analyses within each ancestry using METAL 20 (Methods). We defined 'single-ancestry lead' variants as the strongest trait-associated variants (P &lt; 5 × 10 -8 ) within a 1 Mb region in an ancestry (Table 1). Within each ancestry and each autosome, we used approximate conditional analyses in genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA) 21,22 to identify 'single-ancestry index variants' (P &lt; 5 × 10 -8 ) that exert conditionally distinct effects on the trait (Table 1, Methods, Supplementary Note). This approach identified 124 FG, 15 2hGlu, 48 FI and 139 HbA1c variants that were significant in at least one ancestry (Supplementary Table 2).We first performed trait-specific fixed-effect meta-analyses within each ancestry using METAL 20 (Methods).

        <p>Causal variants are expected to affect related glycemic traits and may be shared across ancestries. Therefore, we combined all single-ancestry lead variants, single-ancestry index variants and/or trans-ancestry lead variants (for any trait) mapping within 500 kb of each other into a single 'trans-ancestry locus' bounded by 500 kb flanking sequences (Table 1, Extended Data Fig. 2).

In addition, we identified seven 'single-ancestry loci' that did not contain any trans-ancestry lead variants (Table 1, Supplementary Table 2).

        <p>Glycemic traits are used to diagnose and monitor type 2 diabetes and cardiometabolic health. To date, most genetic studies of glycemic traits have focused on individuals of European ancestry. Here we aggregated genome-wide association studies comprising up to 281,416 individuals without diabetes (30% non-European ancestry) for whom fasting glucose, 2-h glucose after an oral glucose challenge, glycated hemoglobin and fasting insulin data were available. Trans-ancestry and single-ancestry meta-analyses identified 242 loci (99 novel; P &lt; 5 × 10 -8 ), 80% of which had no significant evidence of between-ancestry heterogeneity. Analyses restricted to individuals of European ancestry with equivalent sample size would have led to 24 fewer new loci. Compared with single-ancestry analyses, equivalent-sized trans-ancestry fine-mapping reduced the number of estimated variants in 99% credible sets by a median of 37.5%. Genomic-feature, gene-expression and gene-set analyses revealed distinct biological signatures for each trait, highlighting different underlying biological pathways. Our results increase our understanding of diabetes pathophysiology by using trans-ancestry studies for improved power and resolution.Glycemic traits are used to diagnose and monitor type 2 diabetes and cardiometabolic health.

However, based on recent East Asian and trans-ancestry T2D GWAS meta-analyses [23][24][25][26][27] , the lead variants at 27 of the 99 novel glycemic trait loci have strong evidence of association with T2D (P &lt; 10 -4 ; 13 loci with P &lt; 5 × 10 -8 ), suggesting that they are also important in T2D pathophysiology (Supplementary Tables 2 and4).the time of analysis (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary Note).

        <p>Of the six single-ancestry novel loci, three were unique to individuals of non-European ancestry (Supplementary Table 3). An association with individuals of African American ancestry for FI (lead variant rs12056334) near LOC100128993 (an uncharacterized RNA gene; Supplementary Note), an association with individuals of African American ancestry for FG (lead variant rs61909476) near ETS1 and an association with individuals of Hispanic descent for FG (lead variant rs12315677) within PIK3C2G (Supplementary Table 3) were found. Despite broadly similar EAFs across ancestries, rs61909476 was significantly associated with FG only in individuals of African American descent (EAF ≈ 7%, β = 0.0812 mmol l -1 , s.e. = 0.01 mmol l -1 , P = 3.9 × 10 -8 compared with EAF = 10-17%, β = 0-0.002 mmol l -1 , s.e. = 0.003-0.017 mmol l -1 , P = 0.44-0.95 in all other ancestries; Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Note). The nearest protein-coding gene, ETS1, encodes a transcription factor that is expressed in mouse pancreatic β-cells, and its overexpression decreases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in mouse islets 28 . Located within the PIK3C2G gene, rs12315677 has an 84% EAF in individuals of Hispanic descent (70-94% in other ancestries) and is significantly associated with FG in this ancestry alone (β = 0.0387 mmol l -1 , s.e. = 0.0075 mmol l -1 , P = 4.0 × 10 -8 compared with β = -0.0128-0.010 mmol l -1 , s.e. = 0.003-0.018 mmol l -1 , P = 0.14-0.76 in all other ancestries; Supplementary Note). In mice, deletion of Pik3c2g leads to a phenotype characterized by reduced glycogen storage in the liver, hyperlipidemia, adiposity and insulin resistance with increasing age or after a high-fat diet 29 . Instances of similar EAFs but differing effect sizes between populations could be due to genotype-by-environment or other epistatic effects. Alternatively, lower imputation accuracy in smaller sample sizes could deflate effect sizes, although the imputation quality for these variants was good (average r 2 = 0.81). Finally, the variants detected here may be in LD with ancestry-specific causal variants that were not investigated here that differ in frequency across ancestries. However, we could not find evidence of rarer alleles in the cognate populations from the 1000 Genomes Project (Supplementary Table 5). The final three single-ancestry loci were identified in individuals of European ancestry (Supplementary Note).Of the six single-ancestry novel loci, three were unique to individuals of non-European ancestry (Supplementary Table 3).

        <p>Next, by rescaling the standard errors of allelic effect sizes to artificially boost the sample size of the European meta-analysis to match that of trans-ancestry meta-analysis, we determined that 21 of the novel trans-ancestry loci would not have been discovered with an equivalent sample size that consisted exclusively of individuals of European ancestry (Supplementary Note). Their discovery was due to the higher EAF and/or larger effect size in populations of non-European ancestry. In particular, two loci (near LINC00885 and MIR4278) contain single-ancestry lead variants associated with East Asian and African American ancestry, respectively, suggesting that these specific ancestries may be driving the trans-ancestry discovery (Supplementary Tables 2,3). Combined with the three single-ancestry non-European loci described above, our results show that 24% (24 out of 99) of the novel loci were discovered due to the contribution of participants of non-European ancestry, strengthening the argument for expanding genetic studies in diverse populations. 2), with considerable overlap across traits (Extended Data Fig. 3). We also detected (P &lt; 0.05 or log 10 [BF] &gt; 0) most (around 90%) of the previously established glycemic signals, 70-88% of which attained genome-wide significance (Supplementary Note, Supplementary Table 6). Given that analyses for FG, FI and 2hGlu were performed adjusted for BMI, we confirmed that collider bias did not influence more than 98% of discovered signals 30 (Supplementary Note). As expected, given the greater power due to increased sample sizes, x locus is mapped to the corresponding chromosome (outer segment). each set of rows shows the results from the trans-ancestry analysis (orange) and each of the ancestries: european (purple), African American (tan), east Asian (gray), South Asian (green), Hispanic (yellow), ugandan (pink).

        <p>To better understand the transferability of trans-ancestry lead variants across ancestries, we investigated the pairwise EAF correlation and the pairwise summarized heterogeneity of effect sizes between ancestries 31 (Methods, Supplementary Note). Consistent with population history and evolution, these results demonstrated considerable EAF correlation (ρ 2 &gt; 0.70) between populations of European and Hispanic, European and South Asian, and Hispanic and South Asian ancestry, which was consistent across all four traits, and between individuals of African American and Ugandan descent for HbA1c (Extended Data Fig. 5). Despite high EAF correlations, some pairwise comparisons exhibited strong evidence for effect size heterogeneity between ancestries that was less consistent between traits (Extended Data Fig. 5). However, sensitivity analyses demonstrated that, across all comparisons, the evidence for heterogeneity is driven by a small number of variants, with between 81.5% (for HbA1c) and 85.7% (for FG) of trans-ancestry lead variants showing no evidence for trans-ancestry heterogeneity (P &gt; 0.05) (Supplementary Note).To better understand the transferability of trans-ancestry lead variants across ancestries, we investigated the pairwise EAF correlation and the pairwise summarized heterogeneity of effect sizes between ancestries 31 (Methods, Supplementary Note).

        <p>Trait variance explained by associated loci. The trait variance explained by genome-wide significant loci was assessed using only the single-ancestry variants or a combination of single-ancestry and trans-ancestry variants (Supplementary Table 7) with β values extracted from the relevant single-ancestry meta-analysis results (Methods). The variance explained was assessed by linear regression in a subset of the contributing cohorts (Methods, Supplementary Tables 891011). In general, the approach that explained the most variance was one in which trans-ancestry lead variants that had P &lt; 0.1 in the relevant single-ancestry meta-analysis were combined with single-ancestry variants that were not in LD with the trans-ancestry variants (LD r 2 &lt; 0.1) (Fig. 2, list C in Supplementary Tables 891011). With this approach, the mean variance in the trait distribution explained was between 0.7% (2hGlu in European ancestry) and 6% (HbA1c in African American ancestry). The European-based estimates explained more variance relative to previous estimates of 2.8% for FG and 1.7% for HbA1c 32 (Supplementary Note).Trait variance explained by associated loci.

        <p>To investigate the transferability of polygenic scores across ancestries we used the 
            <rs type="software">PRS-CSauto</rs> software 33 to first build polygenic scores (PGSs) for each glycemic trait based on the data from individuals of European ancestry. However, the training set for 2hGlu was too small; therefore, this trait was excluded. To build the PGSs, for each trait we first removed five of the largest European cohorts from the European ancestry meta-analysis. These five cohorts were meta-analyzed and used as our European ancestry test dataset, for each trait. The remaining European ancestry cohorts were also meta-analyzed and used as the training dataset, from which we derived a PGS for each trait (Methods). We used PRS-CSauto to revise the effect size estimates for the variants in the score (obtained from the training European datasets) based on the LD of the test population. PRS-CSauto does not have LD reference panels for South Asian or Hispanic ancestry and as such we were unable to test the transferability of the PGS to those populations. The '
            <rs type="software">gtx</rs>' package 34 (Methods) was used to obtain the R 2 for each test population (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 12). Consistent with other complex traits 35 , the European-ancestry-derived PGS had greater predictive power for test data of individuals of European ancestry than for data from other ancestry groups.

        <p>Fine-mapping. We fine-mapped, 231 trans-ancestry and six single-ancestry autosomal loci (Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Note). Using FINEMAP with ancestry-specific LD and an average LD matrix across ancestries, we conducted fine-mapping both within (161 loci with single-ancestry lead variants) and across ancestries (231 loci) for each trait (Methods). Because 59 of the 231 trans-ancestry loci were associated with more than one trait, we conducted trans-ancestry fine-mapping for a total of 305 locus-trait associations. Of these 305 locus-trait combinations, FINEMAP estimated the presence of a single causal variant at 186 loci (61%), whereas multiple distinct causal variants were implicated at 126 loci (39%), for a total of 464 causal variants (Fig. 4a).Fine-mapping.

Previous studies confirm for both loci that these variants affect transcriptional activity [36][37][38] (Supplementary Note). At a locus near PFKM associated with HbA1c, trans-ancestry fine-mapping identified rs12819124 (PPA &gt; 0.999) as the likely causal variant.

        <p>At an additional 156 locus-trait associations, trans-ancestry fine-mapping identified 99% CSs with 50 or fewer variants (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Table 13). Consistent with the potential for more than 1 causal variant in a locus, 74 locus-trait associations contained 88 variants with PPA &gt; 0.90 that were strong candidate causal variants (Supplementary Table 14).

        <p>Finally, we evaluated the resolution obtained in the trans-ancestry versus single-ancestry fine-mapping (Methods, Supplementary Note). We compared the number of variants in 99% CS across 98 locus-trait associations that-as suggested by FINEMAP-had a single causal variant in both trans-ancestry and single-ancestry analyses. Fine-mapping within and across ancestries was conducted using the same set of variants. At 8 out of 98 locus-trait associations, single-ancestry fine-mapping identified a single variant in the CSs. In addition, at 72 of the 98 locus-trait associations, the number of variants in the 99% CSs was smaller in the trans-ancestry fine-mapping (Fig. 4c), which likely reflects the larger sample size and differences in LD structure, EAFs and effect sizes across diverse populations. To quantify the estimated improvement in fine-mapping resolution that is attributable to the multi-ancestry GWAS, we then compared 99% CS sizes from the trans-ancestry fine-mapping to single-ancestry-specific data emulating the same total sample size by rescaling the standard errors (Methods). Of the 72 locus-trait associations with estimated improved fine-mapping in trans-ancestry analysis, resolution at 38 (53%) was improved because of the larger sample size in the trans-ancestry fine-mapping analysis (Fig. 4c), and this estimated improved resolution would likely have been obtained in a European-only fine-mapping effort with equivalent sample size. However, at 34 (47%) loci, the inclusion of samples from multiple diverse populations yielded the estimated improved resolution. On average, ancestry differences led to a reduction in the median number of variants in the 99% CSs from (c). The box plots show the maximum, first quartile, median, third quartile and minimum of trait variance explained when using a genetic score with single-ancestry lead and index variants (european (euR), African American (AA), east Asian (eAS), Hispanic (HISP) and Southeast Asian (SAS) ancestry) or a combination of trans-ancestry (TA) lead variants for individual traits and single-ancestry lead and index variants (TA + euR, TA + AA, TA + eAS, TA + HISP and TA + SAS). Variance explained in each ancestry is in different colors. Data points represent the variance explained in individual cohorts used in this analysis. Adjusted R 2 was estimated in 1-11 cohorts with sample sizes ranging from 489 to 9,758 (Supplementary Tables 891011).Finally, we evaluated the resolution obtained in the trans-ancestry versus single-ancestry fine-mapping (Methods, Supplementary Note).

        <p>HbA1c signal classification. HbA1c-associated variants can exert their effects on HbA1c levels through both glycemic and non-glycemic pathways 7,51 and their correct classification can affect T2D diagnostic accuracy 7,52 . Using previous association results for other glycemic, RBC and iron traits, as well as a fuzzy clustering approach, we classified variants into their most likely mode of action (Methods, Supplementary Note). Of the 218 HbA1c-associated variants, 27 (12%) could not be characterized due to missing data and 23 (11%) could not be classified into a 'known' class (Supplementary Note). The remaining signals were classified as principally: (1) glycemic (n = 53; 24%); (2) affecting iron levels and/or iron metabolism (n = 12; 6%); or (3) RBC traits (n = 103; 47%). A genetic risk score (GRS) composed of all HbA1c-associated signals was strongly associated with T2D risk (odds ratio (OR) = 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.3-2.5, P = 2.7 × 10 -298 ). However, when using partitioned GRSs composed of these different classes of variants (Methods), we found that the T2D association was mainly driven by variants that influenced HbA1c through glycemic pathways (OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 2.5-2.8, P = 2.3 × 10 -250 ), with weaker evidence of an association (despite the larger number of variants in the GRS) and a more modest risk (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.2-1.7, P = 4.7 × 10 -4 ) imparted by signals in the mature RBC cluster that were not glycemic (that is, for which those specific variants had P &gt; 0.05 for FI, 2hGlu and FG) (Extended Data Fig. 6, Supplementary Note). This is in contrast with our previous finding in which we found no significant association between a risk score of non-glycemic variants and T2D 7 . Our current results could be partly driven by cases of T2D being diagnosed on the basis of HbA1c levels that may be influenced by the non-glycemic signals, or by glycemic effects that are not captured by FI, 2hGlu or FG measures.HbA1c signal classification.

        <p>Biological signatures of glycemic-trait-associated loci. To better understand distinct and shared biological signatures underlying variant-trait associations, we conducted genomic feature enrichment, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) co-localization, and tissue and gene-set enrichment analyses across all four traits. Epigenomic landscape of trait-associated variants. We explored the genomic context that underlies glycemic trait loci by computing overlap enrichment for 'static' annotations such as coding regions, conserved regions and super enhancers merged across multiple cell types [53][54][55] using the GREGOR tool 56 .

Previously, stretch enhancers (StrE; enhancer chromatin states that are ≥3 kb in length) in pancreatic islets were shown to be highly cell-specific and strongly enriched with T2D risk signals 57 . Considering StrEs across 31 cell types 38 , FG and 2hGlu signals showed the highest enrichment in islets (FG, fold enrichment = 4.70, P = 2.7 × 10 -24 ; 2hGlu, fold enrichment = 5.51, P = 3.6 × 10 -4 ; Fig. 5a, Supplementary Table 16), highlighting the importance of islets for these traits. FI signals were enriched in skeletal muscle (fold enrichment = 3.17, P = 7.8 × 10 -6 ) and adipose StrEs (fold enrichment = 3.27, P = 1.8 × 10 -7 ), consistent with the idea that these tissues are targets of insulin action (Fig. 5a).

Trans-ancestry and single-ancestry fine-mapping analyses were based on the same set of variants. After removing eight locus-trait associations with one variant in the 99% CSs in both trans-ancestry and single-ancestry analyses, there were 18 locus-trait associations (gray) for which trans-ancestry fine-mapping did not improve the resolution of fine-mapping results (that is, the number of variants in the 99% CS did not decrease). Of the 72 locus-trait associations with improved trans-ancestry fine-mapping resolution (blue and red) further analyses in european fine-mapping emulating the total sample size in trans-ancestry fine-mapping demonstrated that 34 locus-trait associations (red) were improved because of both total sample size and differences across ancestries, whereas 38 locus-trait associations (in blue) were improved because of only the increased sample size in the original trans-ancestry fine-mapping analysis.We then considered epigenomic landscapes defined in individual cell and/or tissue types.

        <p>Co-localization of GWAS and eQTLs. Among the 99 novel glycemic trait loci, we identified co-localized eQTLs at 34 loci in blood, pancreatic islets, subcutaneous or visceral adipose, skeletal muscle or liver, providing suggestive evidence of causal genes (Supplementary Table 19). The co-localized eQTLs include several genes that have previously been reported at glycemic trait loci [60][61][62] : ADCY5, CAMK1D, IRS1, JAZF1 and KLF14. For some additional loci, the co-localized genes have previous evidence for a role in glycemic regulation. For example, the lead trans-ancestry variant and likely causal variant-rs1799815 (PPA = 0.993)-that is associated with FI is the strongest variant associated with expression of INSR, which encodes the insulin receptor, in subcutaneous adipose from METSIM (P = 2 × 10 -9 ) and GTEx (P = 5 × 10 -6 ) datasets. The A allele at rs1799815 is associated with higher FI and lower expression of INSR, which is consistent with the relationship between insulin resistance and reduced INSR function 63 . In a second example, rs841572, which is the trans-ancestry lead variant associated with FG, has the highest PPA (PPA = 0.535) among the 20 variants in the 99% CS and is in strong LD (r 2 = 0.87) with the lead eQTL variant (rs841576, also in the 99% CS) associated with SLC2A1 expression in blood (eQTLGen, P = 1 × 10 -8 ). SLC2A1 (which is also known as GLUT1) encodes the major glucose transporter in brain, placenta and erythrocytes, and is responsible for glucose entry into the brain 64 . rs841572-A is associated with lower FG and lower SLC2A1 expression. Although rare missense variants in SLC2A1 are an established cause of seizures and epilepsy 65 , our data suggest that SLC2A1 variants also affect plasma glucose levels within a population. These co-localized signals provide possible regulatory mechanisms for variant effects on genes that influence glycemic traits.Co-localization of GWAS and eQTLs. Among the 99 novel glycemic trait loci, we identified co-localized eQTLs at 34 loci in blood, pancreatic islets, subcutaneous or visceral adipose, skeletal muscle or liver, providing suggestive evidence of causal genes (Supplementary Table 19). The co-localized eQTLs include several genes that have previously been reported at glycemic trait loci [60][61][62] : ADCY5, CAMK1D, IRS1, JAZF1 and KLF14.

In a second example, rs841572, which is the trans-ancestry lead variant associated with FG, has the highest PPA (PPA = 0.535) among the 20 variants in the 99% CS and is in strong LD (r 2 = 0.87) with the lead eQTL variant (rs841576, also in the 99% CS) associated with SLC2A1 expression in blood (eQTLGen, P = 1 × 10 -8 ). SLC2A1 (which is also known as GLUT1) encodes the major glucose transporter in brain, placenta and erythrocytes, and is responsible for glucose entry into the brain 64 . rs841572-A is associated with lower FG and lower SLC2A1 expression. Although rare missense variants in SLC2A1 are an established cause of seizures and epilepsy 65 , our data suggest that SLC2A1 variants also affect plasma glucose levels within a population. These co-localized signals provide possible regulatory mechanisms for variant effects on genes that influence glycemic traits.</p>
        <p>The co-localized eQTLs also provide insights into the mechanisms of action of glycemic trait loci. For example, rs9884482 (in the 99% CS) is associated with FI and TET2 expression in subcutaneous adipose (P = 2 × 10 -20 ); rs9884482 is in high LD (r 2 = 0.96 in individuals of European ancestry) with the lead TET2 eQTL variant (rs974801). TET2 encodes a DNA demethylase that can affect transcriptional repression 66 . Tet2 expression in adipose is reduced after diet-induced insulin resistance in mice 67 , and knockdown of Tet2 blocked adipogenesis 67,68 . Furthermore, in human adipose tissue, rs9884482-C was associated with lower TET2 expression and higher FI. In a second example, rs617948 is associated with HbA1c (in the 99% CS) and is the lead variant associated with C2CD2L expression in blood (eQTLGen, P = 3 × 10 -96 ). C2CD2L (which is also known as TMEM24) encodes a protein that regulates pulsatile insulin secretion and facilitates release of insulin pool reserves 69,70 . rs617948-G was associated with higher HbA1c and lower C2CD2L, providing evidence for a role for this insulin secretion protein in glucose homeostasis. Our HbA1c 'soft' clustering assigned this signal to both the 'unknown' (0.51 probability) and 'reticulocyte' (0.42 probability) clusters. rs617948 is strongly associated with HbA1c (P &lt; 6.8 × 10 -8 ), but not with FG, FI or 2hGlu (P &gt; 0.05; Supplementary Table 20, Supplementary Note). This suggests that there is an effect of this variant on reticulocyte biology and on insulin secretion, potentially influencing HbA1c levels through different tissues and providing a plausible explanation for the classification as 'unknown' . Tissue expression. Consistent with effector transcript expression analysis using GTEx data 50 , we found considerable differences in tissue expression across the glycemic trait signals. FG signals were enriched for genes expressed in the pancreas (false-discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05), whereas there was an insufficient number of significant associations in 2hGlu to identify enrichment for any tissue or cell type at a threshold of FDR &lt; 0.2. FI signals were enriched in connective tissue and cells (which includes adipose tissue), endocrine glands, blood cells and muscles (FDR &lt; 0.2) and HbA1c signals were significantly enriched in genes expressed in the pancreas, hemic and immune system (FDR &lt; 0.05) (Fig. 6, Supplementary Table 21). Consistent with previous analysis 50 , FI enrichment in connective tissue was driven by adipose tissue (subcutaneous and visceral), whereas the newly described enrichment in endocrine glands was driven by the adrenal glands and cortex (Supplementary Table 21). In addition to enrichment in genes expressed in glycemic-related tissues, HbA1c signals were enriched in genes expressed in the blood, consistent with the role of RBCs in this trait and our previous results 50 .The co-localized eQTLs also provide insights into the mechanisms of action of glycemic trait loci.

        <p>The association between FI signals and genes expressed in adrenal glands is notable, suggesting a possible direct role for these genes in insulin resistance. These genes could influence cortisol levels, which may contribute to insulin resistance and FI levels through impaired insulin receptor signaling in peripheral tissues, as well as influencing the distribution of body fat, stimulating lipolysis and affecting other indirect mechanisms 71,72 .The association between FI signals and genes expressed in adrenal glands is notable, suggesting a possible direct role for these genes in insulin resistance.

        <p>Here we describe a large glycemic-trait meta-analysis of GWAS in which 30% of the population was composed of participants of East Asian, Hispanic, African American, South Asian and sub-Saharan African ancestry. This effort identified 242 loci (235 trans-ancestry and seven single-ancestry), which jointly explained between 0.7% (2hGlu in individuals of European ancestry) and 6% (HbA1c in individuals of African American ancestry) of the variance in glycemic traits in any given ancestry. Although 114 out of 242 loci are associated with T2D (P &lt; 10 -4 ; 83 loci with P &lt; 5 × 10 -8 ; Supplementary Table 4), the absence of strong evidence of association for the remaining loci (P ≥ 10 -4 ) suggests that for alleles with a frequency above 5% we can exclude T2D-associated OR ≥ 1.07 with 80% power (ɑ = 5 × 10 -8 ; and OR ≥ 1.05 for ɑ = 10 -4 ) given a current study of 228,499 cases of T2D and 1,178,783 control individuals 27 . We identified 486 signals that were associated with glycemic traits, of which eight have minor allele frequency (MAF) &lt; 1% and 45 have 1% ≤ MAF &lt; 5% in all ancestries, highlighting that 89% of signals identified are common in at least one ancestry studied.Here we describe a large glycemic-trait meta-analysis of GWAS in which 30% of the population was composed of participants of East Asian, Hispanic, African American, South Asian and sub-Saharan African ancestry.

        <p>A key aim of our study was to evaluate the added advantage of including population diversity in genetic discovery and fine-mapping efforts. In addition to the larger sample size included in the trans-ancestry meta-analysis, we were able to estimate the contribution of data from individuals of non-European ancestry in locus discovery and fine-mapping resolution. We found that 24 of the 99 newly discovered loci owe their discovery to the inclusion of data from participants of East Asian, Hispanic, African American, South Asian and sub-Saharan African ancestry, due to differences in EAF and effect sizes across ancestries.A key aim of our study was to evaluate the added advantage of including population diversity in genetic discovery and fine-mapping efforts.

        <p>Comparison of 295 trans-ancestry lead variants (315 locustrait associations) across ancestries demonstrated that between 81.5% (HbA1c) and 85.7% (FG) of the trans-ancestry lead variants showed no evidence of trans-ancestry heterogeneity in allelic effects (P &gt; 0.05).Comparison of 295 trans-ancestry lead variants (315 locustrait associations) across ancestries demonstrated that between 81.5% (HbA1c) and 85.7% (FG) of the trans-ancestry lead variants showed no evidence of trans-ancestry heterogeneity in allelic effects (P &gt; 0.05).</p>
        <p>Given sample size and power limitations, genome-wide significant trait-associated variants in a single-ancestry analysis explain only a modest proportion of trait variance in that ancestry (Fig. 2). We demonstrate that trans-ancestry lead variants explain more trait variance than the ancestry-specific variants (Fig. 2). This shows that even though some trans-ancestry lead variants are not genome-wide significant in all ancestries, they contribute to the genetic architecture of the trait in most ancestries.Given sample size and power limitations, genome-wide significant trait-associated variants in a single-ancestry analysis explain only a modest proportion of trait variance in that ancestry (Fig. 2).

        <p>We evaluated the transferability of glycemic-trait PGSs derived from data from individuals of European ancestry to other ancestries. In agreement with other traits 35,77,78 , we confirm that PGS derived from data from participants of European ancestry perform much worse when the test dataset is from a different ancestry. Each trait-specific PGS improves trait variance explained by between 3.5-fold (HbA1c) and 6-fold (FG) in the European dataset (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 12) compared with a score built from only trans-ancestry lead variants and European index variants (Fig. 2, Supplementary Tables 9101112).We evaluated the transferability of glycemic-trait PGSs derived from data from individuals of European ancestry to other ancestries.

However, the current software lacks appropriate reference panels for many ancestries, precluding its broad application.

        <p>We show that fine-mapping resolution is improved in trans-ancestry, compared with single-ancestry fine-mapping efforts. In around 50% of our loci, we showed that the improvement was due to differences in EAF, effect size or LD structure between ancestries, and not only due to the overall increased sample size that was available for trans-ancestry fine-mapping. By performing trans-ancestry fine-mapping, and co-localizing GWAS signals with eQTL signals and coding variants, we identified new candidate causal genes. Taken together, these results motivate continued expansion of genetic and genomic efforts in diverse populations to improve our understanding of these traits in groups that are disproportionally affected by T2D.We show that fine-mapping resolution is improved in trans-ancestry, compared with single-ancestry fine-mapping efforts.

        <p>Given data on four different glycemic traits and their use in the diagnosis and monitoring of T2D and metabolic health, we also sought to characterize biological features underlying these traits. We show that despite considerable sharing of loci across the four traits, each trait is also characterized by unique features based on StrE, gene expression and gene-set signatures. Combining genetic data from these traits with T2D data will further elucidate pathways that drive normal physiology and pathophysiology, and help to further develop useful predictive scores for disease classification and management 4,5 .Given data on four different glycemic traits and their use in the diagnosis and monitoring of T2D and metabolic health, we also sought to characterize biological features underlying these traits.

        <p>To identify distinct association index variants across each chromosome within each ancestry (Table 1), we performed approximate conditional analyses implemented in GCTA 21 using the --cojo-slct option (autosomes) and distance-based clumping (X chromosome). LD correlations for GCTA were estimated from a representative cohort from each ancestry: Women's Genome Health Study (European); China Health and Nutrition Survey (East Asian); Singapore Indian Eye Study (South Asian); BioMe (African American); Study of Latinos (Hispanic) and Uganda (for itself). The results from the GCTA were comparable when using alternative cohorts as the LD reference. For any index variant with a QC flag that caused reason for concern, we performed manual inspection of forest plots to decide whether the signal was likely to be real (Supplementary Note). Among 335 single-ancestry index variants across all traits, this manual inspection was done for 40 signals of which 32 passed and 8 failed after inspection. Thus, a total of 327 single-ancestry index variants passed and 8 failed.To identify distinct association index variants across each chromosome within each ancestry (Table 1), we performed approximate conditional analyses implemented in GCTA 21 using the --cojo-slct option (autosomes) and distance-based clumping (X chromosome).

        <p>For each pair of ancestries, we calculated Pearson's correlations in EAFs for each trans-ancestry lead variant. The pairwise summarized heterogeneity of effect sizes between ancestries was then tested using a joint F-test of heterogeneity 31 .

Under the null hypothesis, the statistics follows a χ 2 distribution with n degrees of freedom, where n is the number of the trans-ancestry lead variants.For each pair of ancestries, we calculated Pearson's correlations in EAFs for each trans-ancestry lead variant.

        <p>LD-pruned variant lists. Several downstream analyses (for example, genomic feature enrichment, genetic scores and estimation of variance explained by associated variants) require independent LD-pruned variants (r 2 &lt; 0.1) to avoid double-counting variants that might otherwise be in LD with each other and that do not provide additional 'independent' evidence. Therefore, for these analyses we generated different lists of either trans-ancestry or single-ancestry LD-pruned (r 2 &lt; 0.1) variants, retaining-in each case-the variant with the strongest evidence of association (Supplementary Table 7). Subsequently, we combined trans-ancestry and single-ancestry variant lists and conducted further LD pruning. For some analyses, we took the trans-ancestry-pruned variant list and added single-ancestry signals if the LD r 2 &lt; 0.1, whereas for others we started with the single-ancestry pruned lists and supplemented with trans-ancestry lead variants if the LD r 2 &lt; 0.1. One exception was the list used for eQTL co-localizations, which included all single-ancestry European signals (without LD pruning) and supplemented with any additional trans-ancestry lead variants (starting from the variants with the most significant P values) with LD r 2 &lt; 0.1 for data from individuals of European ancestry with any of the variants already in list, and that reached at least P &lt; 1 × 10 -5 in the meta-analysis of individuals of European ancestry.LD-pruned variant lists.

        <p>Trait variance explained by associated loci. To determine how much of the phenotypic variance of each trait could be explained by the corresponding trait-associated loci, variants were combined in a series of weighted genetic scores. The analysis was performed in a subset of the cohorts included in the discovery GWAS (with representation from each ancestry) and in a smaller number of independent cohorts (European ancestry only). Up to three different genetic scores were derived per trait (and for each ancestry) to evaluate the potential for the trans-ancestry meta-GWAS-identified loci to provide additional information above and beyond that contributed by the ancestry-specific meta-analysis results. These genetic scores comprised: list A, single-ancestry signals; list B, single-ancestry signals plus trans-ancestry signals; and list C, trans-ancestry signals plus single-ancestry signals (Supplementary Table 7). In the case of the cohorts of individuals of European ancestry that contributed to the GWAS, we used a previously published method 32 to adjust the effect sizes (β values) from the GWAS for the contribution of that cohort, providing sets of cohort-specific effect sizes that were then used to generate the genetic scores.

        <p>Transferability of PGSs across ancestries. We used the 
            <rs type="software">PRS-CSauto</rs> 33 software to first build PGSs derived from data from individuals of European ancestry for each glycemic trait (FG, FI, 2hGlu and HbA1c) on the basis of the summary statistics. However, PRS-CSauto does not perform well when the training dataset is relatively small and the genetic architecture is sparse 33 . As a consequence, 2hGlu was excluded from this analysis. For each trait, to obtain training and test datasets for populations of European ancestry, we first removed all cohorts only genotyped on the Metabochip that were not included in this analysis. From the remaining cohorts we then removed five of the largest cohorts of European ancestry that contributed to the respective meta-analysis of data of populations of European ancestry. For each trait, these five cohorts were meta-analyzed and used as the test dataset of individuals of European ancestry. Subsequently, the remaining cohorts comprising individuals of European ancestry were also meta-analyzed and used as the training dataset of individuals of European ancestry. For each of the other ancestries, cohorts only genotyped on the Metabochip were also removed, and the remaining cohorts were meta-analyzed, and used as the test datasets of populations of non-European ancestry. Variants that had MAF &lt; 0.05 or that were missing in over half of the individuals in the training dataset were removed 33,88 . The PGS for each trait was built using

In both analyses, only data from cohorts genotyped on GWAS arrays were used, and analyses were limited to trans-ancestry lead variants and other single-ancestry lead variants that were present in at least 90% of the samples for each trait. For the single-ancestry fine-mapping, FINEMAP estimates the number of causal variants in a region up to a maximum number, which we set to be two plus the number of distinct signals identified from the GCTA signal selection. FINEMAP uses single-ancestry and trait-specific z-scores from the fixed-effect meta-analysis in METAL 20 and an ancestry-specific LD reference, which we created from a subset of cohorts (combined sample size of more than 30% of the sample size for that ancestry), weighting each cohort by sample size. In the trans-ancestry fine-mapping analysis, FINEMAP was similarly used to estimate the number of causal variants starting with two, and trait-specific z-scores and LD maps were generated from the sample-size-weighted average of those used in the single-ancestry fine-mapping. The maximum number of causal variants was iteratively increased by one until it was larger than the number of causal variants supported by data (Bayes factor), which was the estimated maximum number of causal variants used in the final run of the fine-mapping analysis.We performed both single-ancestry and trans-ancestry fine-mapping.

        <p>To compare fine-mapping results obtained from the single-ancestry and trans-ancestry efforts, analyses were limited to fine-mapping regions with evidence for a single likely causal variant in both, enabling a straightforward comparison of CSs (Supplementary Note). To ensure any difference in the fine-mapping results was not driven by different sets of variants being present in the different analyses, we repeated the single-ancestry fine-mapping limited to the same set of variants used in the trans-ancestry fine-mapping. The fine-mapping resolution was assessed on the basis of comparisons of the 99% CSs in terms of the number of variants included in the set and length of the region. To assess whether the improvement in the trans-ancestry fine-mapping was due to differences in LD, increased sample size or both, we repeated the trans-ancestry fine-mapping mimicking the sample size present in the single-ancestry fine-mapping by dividing the standard errors by the square root of the sample size ratio and compared the results with those from the single-ancestry fine-mapping.To compare fine-mapping results obtained from the single-ancestry and trans-ancestry efforts, analyses were limited to fine-mapping regions with evidence for a single likely causal variant in both, enabling a straightforward comparison of CSs (Supplementary Note).

We constructed GRSs for each cluster of HbA1c-associated signals (based on hard clustering) and tested the association of each cluster with T2D risk using samples from the UK Biobank. Pairs of HbA1c signals in LD (European r 2 &gt; 0.10) were LD-pruned by removing the signal with the less-significant P value of association with HbA1c. The GRS for each cluster was calculated on the basis of the logarithm of the ORs from the latest T2D study summary statistics 94 and UK Biobank genotypes imputed in the Haplotype Reference Consortium 19 . From 487,409 UK Biobank samples (age between 46 and 82 years; 55% female), we excluded participants for the following reasons: 373 with mismatched sex; 9 not used in the kinship calculation; 78,365 individuals of non-European ancestry; and 138,504 with missing T2D status, age or sex information. We further removed 26,896 related participants (kinship &gt; 0.088, preferentially removing individuals with the largest number of relatives and control individuals for whom a case of T2D was related to that control individual). Individuals with T2D were defined as: (1) a history of diabetes without metformin or insulin treatment; (2) self-reported diagnosis of T2D; or (3) diagnosis of T2D in a national registry (n = 17,022; age between 47 and 79 years; 36% female). Control individuals were participants without a history of T2D (n = 226,240; age between 46 and 82 years; 56% female). We tested for associations between each GRS and T2D using logistic regression including covariates for age, sex and the first five principal components. The significance of the associations was evaluated by a bootstrap approach to incorporate the variance of each HbA1c-associated signal in the T2D summary data. To do this, we generated the GRS of each cluster 200 times by resampling the logarithm of the OR of each signal with T2D. For each non-glycemic class that had a GRS that was significantly associated with T2D, we performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate whether the association was driven by variants that also belonged to a glycemic cluster when using a soft clustering approach (the signals were classified as also glycemic in the soft clustering or had an association P ≤ 0.05 with any of the three glycemic traits).HbA1c GRSs and T2D risk.

        <p>Chromatin states. To identify genetic variants within association signals that overlapped predicted chromatin states, we used a previously published, 13-chromatin-state model that included 31 diverse tissues, including pancreatic islets, skeletal muscle, adipose and liver 38 . In brief, this model was generated from cell and tissue chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing data for H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3, and input control from a diverse set of publicly available data 53,57,95,96 using the 
            <rs type="software">ChromHMM</rs> program 97 . As reported previously 38 , StrEs were defined as contiguous enhancer chromatin state (active enhancer 1 and 2, genic enhancer and weak enhancer) segments that were longer than 3 kb (ref. 57 ).

To calculate the enrichment of glycemic-trait-associated variants in these annotations, we used the filtered list of trait-associated variants as described above (Supplementary Table 7) as input. To calculate the enrichment of sub-classified HbA1c variants, we included the list of loci characterized as glycemic, another list of loci characterized as reticulocyte or mature RBC-which collectively represented the RBC fraction-along with lists of iron-related or unclassified loci (Supplementary Table 17). We used the following parameters in GREGOR enrichment analyses: European r 2 threshold (for inclusion of variants in LD with the lead variant) = 0.8, LD window size = 1 Mb, and minimum neighbour number = 500.

            <rs type="software">fGWAS</rs> parameters for enrichment analyses for individual annotations for each trait. For each annotation, the model provided the natural logarithm of the maximum likelihood estimate of the enrichment parameter.

We used the effective number of annotations for each trait to obtain Bonferroni-corrected significance thresholds for enrichment of each trait. eQTL analyses. To aid in the identification of candidate casual genes associated with the European-only and trans-ancestry association signals, we examined whether any of the lead variants associated with glycemic traits (Supplementary Table 7) were also associated with the expression level (FDR &lt; 5%) of nearby transcripts located within 1 Mb using existing eQTL datasets of blood, subcutaneous adipose, visceral adipose, skeletal muscle and pancreatic islet samples 60,61,[98][99][100][101] . The LD was estimated from the collected cohort pairwise LD information, where available, and otherwise from the samples of individuals of European ancestry from 1000 Genomes Project phase 3. GWAS and eQTL signals likely co-localize when the GWAS variant and the variant most strongly associated with the expression level of the corresponding transcript (eSNP) exhibit high pairwise LD (r 2 &gt; 0.8; 1000 Genomes Project phase 3, European ancestry). For these signals, we conducted reciprocal conditional analyses to test associations between the GWAS variant and transcript level when the eSNP was also included in the model, and vice versa. We report GWAS and eQTL signals as co-localized if the association for the eSNP was not significant (FDR ≥ 5%) when conditioned on the GWAS variant; we also report signals from the eQTLGen whole-blood meta-analysis data that meet only the LD threshold because conditional analysis was not possible. Tissue and gene-set analysis. We performed enrichment analysis using 
            <rs type="software">DEPICT</rs> v.
            <rs type="version">3</rs>, which was specifically developed for the imputed meta-analysis data of the 1000 Genomes Project 102 to identify cell types and tissues in which genes of trait-associated variants were strongly expressed, and to detect enrichment of gene sets or pathways. DEPICT data included human gene-expression data for 19,987 genes in 10,968 reconstituted gene sets, and 209 tissues and/or cell types. Because gene-expression data in DEPICT is based on samples of individuals of European ancestry and LD, we selected trait-associated variants with P &lt; 10 -5 in the meta-analysis of data of individuals of European ancestry and tested for enrichment of signals in each reconstituted gene set, and each tissue or cell type. Enrichment results with FDR &lt; 0.05 were considered to be significant. We ran DEPICT on the basis of the association results for all traits among: (1) cohorts with genome-wide data; or (2) all cohorts (genome-wide and Metabochip cohorts). Because results were broadly consistent between the two approaches, we present results from the analysis that contained all cohorts as it had greater statistical power.

        <p>Statistics and reproducibility. Sample size. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. We aimed to bring together the largest possible sample size with GWAS data from individuals of diverse ancestries (European, Hispanic, African American, East Asian, South Asian and sub-Saharan African) without diabetes and with data for one or more of the following traits: FG, FI, 2hGlu and HbA1c. The sample sizes were 281,416 (FG), 213,650 (FI), 215,977 (HbA1c) and 85,916 (2hGlu) (Supplementary Table 1). Our sample size was sufficiently powered to detect common variant associations for each of the glycemic traits and was able to detect associations at 242 loci. Randomization and blinding. This is a study of continuous traits and there were therefore no experiments to randomize and no 'outcome' to which investigators needed to be blinded to. Data exclusions. Before conducting this study, we identified reasons for which data should be excluded from the analysis at either the cohort or summary level; these exclusions are as follows. Sample QC checks included removing samples with low call rate less than 95%, extreme heterozygosity, sex mismatch with X chromosome variants, duplicates, first-or second-degree relatives (unless by design) or ancestry outliers. Following sample QC, cohorts applied variant QC thresholds for call rate (less than 95%), Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium P &lt; 1 × 10 -6 and MAF. Full details of QC thresholds and exclusions by participating cohorts are available in Supplementary Table 1. Each contributing cohort shared their summary statistic results with the central analysis group, who performed additional QC using EasyQC. Allele-frequency estimates were compared with estimates from the 1000 Genomes Project phase 1 reference panel, and variants were excluded from downstream analyses if there was a MAF difference of more than 0.2 for populations of African American, European, Hispanic and East Asian ancestry compared with populations of African, European, Mexican and Asian ancestry from 1000 Genomes Project phase 1, respectively, or a MAF difference of more than 0.4 for individuals of South Asian ancestry compared with populations of European ancestry. At this stage, additional variants were excluded from each cohort file if they met one of the following criteria: were tri-allelic; had a MAC &lt; 3; demonstrated a standard error of the effect size ≥ 10; imputation r 2 &lt; 0.4 or INFO score &lt; 0.4; or were missing an effect estimate, standard error or imputation quality.Statistics and reproducibility.
