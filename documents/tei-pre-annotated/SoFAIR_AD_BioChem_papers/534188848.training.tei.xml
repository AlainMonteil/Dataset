        <p>Chitin, and especially its deacetylated variant chitosan, has many applications, e.g. as carrier material for pharmaceutical drugs or as a flocculant in wastewater treatment. Despite its versatility and accessibility, chitin, the second most abundant polysaccharide on Earth, has so far been commercially extracted only from crustaceans and to a minor extent from fungi. Insects are a viable alternative source of chitin, but they have not been exploited in the past due to limited availability. Today however, for the sustainable production of animal feed, insect farming is being developed substantially. The availability of large quantities of insect biomass and chitin-rich side products such as exuviae and exoskeletons has been increasing. This review provides an overview of recently published studies of chitin extraction from insects, its subsequent conversion into chitosan and the primary analytical methods used to characterize insect-based chitin and chitosan. We have discovered a large number of research articles published over the past 20 years, confirming the increased attention being received by chitin and chitosan production from insects. Despite numerous publications, we identified several knowledge gaps, such as a lack of data concerning chitin purification degree and chitosan yield. Furthermore, analytical methods used to obtain physicochemical characteristics, structural information and chemical composition meet basic qualitative requirements but do not satisfy the need for a more quantitative evaluation. Despite the current shortcomings that need to be overcome, this review presents encouraging data on the use of insects as an alternative source of chitin and chitosan in the future.Chitin, and especially its deacetylated variant chitosan, has many applications, e.g. as carrier material for pharmaceutical drugs or as a flocculant in wastewater treatment.

        <p>Chitin is an important structural component of the cell wall of fungi and yeasts and the main carbohydrate component of arthropod exoskeletons. 1 After cellulose, it is the second most abundant biopolymer present in nature. 2 The production of chitin in the biosphere is estimated to be around 1000 billion (10 11 ) tons per year. 3 Chitin was isolated for the first time in 1799 from the shells of mollusks. 4 Chitosan, the deacetylated derivative of chitin, was obtained by Rouget in 1859 by heating chitin in alkaline medium; however, its chemical structure was determined only in 1950. 5 Despite this early discovery, the industrial production and commercialization of chitin and chitosan initially started in the 1970s. 6 Chitin is a hard, inelastic, N-acetylated aminopolysaccharide (Fig. 1(a)) with high hydrophobicity, making it insoluble in water and most organic solvents. 7,8 Fungi and invertebrates use these properties and incorporate chitin microfibrils to protect and strengthen their cell matrix or as components of mechanically resilient structures such as shells, cuticles, bones (in cuttlefish) and scaffolds (in sponges). 9,10 Based on various orientations of its microfibrils, chitin exists in nature in three crystalline allomorphic forms: ⊍-, ⊎and γ-chitin (Fig. 1(b)). ⊍-Chitin has antiparallel chains. It is responsible for the rigidity of the polymer and is the most abundant form. 11 ⊎-Chitin consists of parallel chains, producing monoclinic crystals with intramolecular interactions (hydrogen bonds) in addition to intermolecular ones. 12 ⊎-Chitin is found in the spines of diatoms, squid pens and pogonophoran tubes. γ-Chitin is a mixture of parallel and antiparallel chains combining the properties of both ⊍-form and ⊎-form 13 ; it is present in fungi, yeasts and insect cocoons. [14][15][16][17][18] After being isolated from natural sources, direct application of chitin is limited to a few applications, such as the production of scaffolds to support tissue regeneration 19 or for biological control of plant pathogens in agriculture, 20 which is due to its insolubility.Chitin is an important structural component of the cell wall of fungi and yeasts and the main carbohydrate component of arthropod exoskeletons. 1 After cellulose, it is the second most abundant biopolymer present in nature. 2 The production of chitin in the biosphere is estimated to be around 1000 billion (10 11 ) tons per year. 3 Chitin was isolated for the first time in 1799 from the shells of mollusks. 4 Chitosan, the deacetylated derivative of chitin, was obtained by Rouget in 1859 by heating chitin in alkaline medium; however, its chemical structure was determined only in 1950. 5 Despite this early discovery, the industrial production and commercialization of chitin and chitosan initially started in the 1970s. 6 Chitin is a hard, inelastic, N-acetylated aminopolysaccharide (Fig. 1(a)) with high hydrophobicity, making it insoluble in water and most organic solvents. 7,8 Fungi and invertebrates use these properties and incorporate chitin microfibrils to protect and strengthen their cell matrix or as components of mechanically resilient structures such as shells, cuticles, bones (in cuttlefish) and scaffolds (in sponges). 9,10 Based on various orientations of its microfibrils, chitin exists in nature in three crystalline allomorphic forms: ⊍-, ⊎and γ-chitin (Fig. 1(b)). ⊍-Chitin has antiparallel chains.

        <p>To widen its range of applications, chitin needs to be converted to more water-soluble derivatives with useful properties, primarily chitosan. Chitosan (Fig. 1(a)) is a cationic polysaccharide obtained from chitin by alkaline hydrolysis of the acetamido groups (deacetylation process). Due to an increased number of free primary amine groups, and partially due to a lower molecular weight, chitosan is soluble in slightly acidic solutions. To define and distinguish between chitin and chitosan, several researchers have set the threshold value of degree of acetylation to 50%: when the N-acetyl group content of the polysaccharide exceeds 50%, the polymer is defined as chitin; for values below 50%, it is called chitosan. 21,22 The physicochemical properties of chitin and chitosan may vary among samples, being affected by many factors such as the source of chitin and parameters of the purification process. Molecular weight is an important characteristic to consider as it affects chitosan viscosity 23 that is crucial to many of its applications and other important features such as antibacterial activity. 24 Native chitin from crustacean sources has a molecular weight exceeding 1000 kDa, while the molecular weight of crustacean-based chitosan ranges from 100 to 1000 kDa. 25,26 Due to its useful properties, such as biodegradability, biocompatibility, nontoxicity, adsorption capacity and antimicrobial activity, 1,17 chitosan is attracting great attention for many applications within the agricultural, industrial, biotechnological and biomedical fields and in wastewater treatment. 1,8,[27][28][29][30][31] The antimicrobial activity of chitosan is one of its most exploited properties. Chitosan can inhibit the growth of human pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, 32,33 Staphylococcus aureus, 34,35 Pseudomonas aeruginosa 36 and Aspergillus niger. 37 Its antimicrobial activity makes chitosan suitable to be used not only in biomedical applications but also as a natural biopolymer coating material to preserve the quality and to extend the shelf-life of fresh food. 38 Chitosan-based active films against contamination and microbial spoilage have been successfully used in fruit, vegetable, egg and meat packaging. 39,40 Chitosan has also shown excellent potential for wound dressing. The potential of chitosan as a hemostatic topical dressing for animal tissues has previously been demonstrated: chitosan adheres to red blood cells, thus retrieving platelets for hemagglutination. 41 In cosmetics, chitosan finds application in the production of creams and lotions. It is used as a moisturizing and UVprotective agent for the skin. 42 A further application for chitosan is in wastewater treatment, where it is used as a flocculating agent owing to its ability to chelate cations and adsorb waste molecules from water, such as heavy metals. 31,43 Recently, chitosan has been proposed as an ecological finishing agent in the textile industry. It is used in working fabrics for hospitals or biological laboratories and for making sutures, threads and fibers in medical textiles. 44,45 Chitosan is also used for antistatic finishing in work wear for employees of the electronic sector. 46 Three main chitin sources are available Currently, the main commercial source of chitin and chitosan comprises waste streams from the marine food industrymainly exoskeletons of crustaceans. 47 Annual world production of crustaceans for human consumption was an estimated 8 million tons in 2016, 48 of which 40% comprised waste exoskeletons 49 with a chitin content of 15-40%. 50 However, the availability of fishery waste is highly seasonal, as commercial crustacean fishing starts in spring, after the spawning season. 51 Moreover, the sustainability of crustacean farming is currently under debate. 49 The global market for chitin and chitosan is expected to reach a volume of $4.2 billion by 2021, with a compound annual growth rate of 15.4%, 52 intensifying the need for a search of other sources to satisfy the growing market.To widen its range of applications, chitin needs to be converted to more water-soluble derivatives with useful properties, primarily chitosan.

        <p>Fungi are the second main source of chitin after crustaceans. Several research activities have focused on fungi and their commercial value as they have attracted attention as an alternative and vegan source of chitin and chitosan. 53 Chitin makes up between 1 and 15% of fungal cell wall mass 54 and its structure is comparable to that in crustaceans. 55 Even though not all fungi contain chitin, it is widely distributed in various fungal phyla such as Basidiomycota, Ascomycota and Zygomycota. 55 Similar to crustacean chitin, severe conditions are required to obtain chitosan from fungal chitin. In contrast, chitosan can be directly isolated from the cell wall of some fungal species without requiring the cleavage of the acetyl groups. Among them, the most investigated species for direct chitosan production include Absidia spp. (zygomycetes), A. niger (ascomycetes), Mucor rouxii (zygomycetes), Rhizophus oryzae (zygomycetes) and Lentinus edodes (basidiomycetes). [56][57][58][59] Nevertheless, the production of fungal chitin and chitosan has not yet been scaled up to the industrial level. 53 In addition to crustaceans and fungi, insects are another promising and sustainable source of chitin and chitosan, although they have not received much attention previously. Insects present some advantages compared to crustaceans, as they are not subject to seasonality, and can be easily bred owing to their high fertility and reproductive rate; moreover, insect rearing facilities are being launched worldwide. 60 Notably, as bioconvertersreared for organic waste management and animal feed productioninsects can be exploited as a valid alternative to crustaceans as a source for chitin and chitosan for greater ecological and economic sustainability. 61 Arthropods, including centipedes 62,63 and woodlice, 64,65 have been investigated as sources of chitin. Notably, the body segments of large centipedes are suitable for the production of three-dimensional chitin rings. 62 In addition, chitin has been extracted from poriferans, 66 bryozoans 67 and tardigrades 68 and from guano of insectivorous bats. 69 Quo vadis insect chitin? Economic value linked to beneficial insects has been known to humans for a long time. The commercial production of silk from Bombyx mori originated in China during the Neolithic period. 70 Humans have learned to farm several insect species and exploit them for specific applications with the course of time. Production of biocontrol insects started in the middle of the 20th century. For example, mass production of Cochliomyia hominivorax for biocontrol started in Florida during the late 1950s. 71 Organized, largescale production of insects for human and animal nutrition has been more recent: Protix, a Dutch company, launched the first facility in 2015.Fungi are the second main source of chitin after crustaceans.

        <p>Some industries in the domain of beneficial insect breeding are witnessing rapid growth. For example, the market for edible insects is estimated to exceed $522 million in 2023. 72 According to a report published in 2016, globally, more than 120 registered companies are involved in the business of farming and processing and/or marketing insects for animal and human nutrition. 73 In 2019, approximately 6kt of insect protein meal was produced in Europe 74 to be used for animal nutrition, from the black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens), the yellow mealworm (Tenebrio molitor) and, to a smaller extent, the lesser mealworm (Alphitobius diaperinus). 75 In particular, the black soldier fly is processed by around 80% of all EU insect-producing companies. 75 H. illucens could be grown on a wide range of organic side streams and contributes to a circular economy. 76,77 Exoskeletons from H. illucens larvae contain up to 35% chitin, 78 which means that it is one of the main compounds that could be isolated from the byproducts of the insect farming industry. 73 Thus, chitin-rich byproducts from insect farming present a new and sustainable source of commercial chitin. Given the sustainability aspect and the expected rise in insect production, byproducts from insect farming present a very interesting source of chitin for the future.Some industries in the domain of beneficial insect breeding are witnessing rapid growth.

        <p>The inner soft tissues of insects are covered by a hard, protective layer called the exoskeleton. The exoskeleton has several functions in insect bodies, including but not limited to: (i) as a protective covering and (ii) as a facilitator of metamorphosis. The exoskeleton is rich in chitin and is shed from the body during metamorphosis. 79 Chitin is contained in the procuticle, the innermost layer of the cuticle, which is in turn the outermost layer of the arthropod exoskeleton. 80,81 In its native form, chitin is arranged into microfibers embedded in a protein matrix. 82 To extract chitin from the arthropod cuticle, the purification process remove proteins, lipids, minerals, pigments and catechols contained therein. 83 Whole insects generally contain 30-60% protein, 84 10-25% lipid, 84 5-25% chitin, 50,78,85 5-10% catechols 85 and 2-10% minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, potassium and magnesium salts. 84,86 To date, little has been reported on the extraction methods for insect chitin and its physicochemical properties. Here, a total of 52 papers reporting chitin purification and chitosan production from 58 insect species were collected, summarized and analyzed (Tables 1 and2).The inner soft tissues of insects are covered by a hard, protective layer called the exoskeleton.

        <p>Various types of chitin purification processes can be performed, such as physical, biotechnological and chemical methods and a combination of these. Physical techniques such as crushing and stirring are used in parallel with chemicals or catalysts. Biotechnological extraction and deacetylation of chitin has been gaining interest as an environmentally friendly alternative to chemical processes. The biotechnological methods are mainly based on the use of microbial proteases or whole microorganisms for the removal of proteins and the application of deacetylases for the deacetylation of chitin. However, the biotechnological processes developed so far produce lower yields, are time-consuming and result in products of lower purity. 83,134 Notably, enzymatic deacetylation of chitin using deacetylases has proven to be unsuitable for chitosan production. 135,136 Chemical processes, utilizing acidic and alkaline solutions, are currently the most applied on an industrial scale to produce large amounts of chitin and chitosan from crustacean shells 134,137 (Fig. 2). Typically, chemical treatment provides pure chitin and chitosan, although it produces large volumes of waste due to the high concentrations of chemicals used. 134,137,138 The literature reviewed here describes only chemical methods for chitin and chitosan production from insects.Various types of chitin purification processes can be performed, such as physical, biotechnological and chemical methods and a combination of these.

        <p>Chemical methods for extracting chitin from insect exoskeletons are similar to those used for marine sources and consist of two steps: demineralization and removal of proteins. In the first step, minerals contained in the cuticle are removed with diluted acids. Various mineral acids (e.g. hydrochloric acid) or organic acids (e.g. acetic acid) can be used for this purpose. The removal of proteins is carried out with alkaline treatments, mainly applying diluted sodium hydroxide solution. Deproteinization treatment can simultaneously extract part of the dyes and soluble lipids contained in the exoskeleton. For prawn shells, two-step purification can be performed in reverse order without affecting the properties of chitin. 83 An additional step of bleaching can be performed to remove residual pigments and improve the color of purified chitin, using reagents such as sodium hypochlorite, acetone and hydrogen peroxide.Chemical methods for extracting chitin from insect exoskeletons are similar to those used for marine sources and consist of two steps: demineralization and removal of proteins.

        <p>Prior to the chitin purification process, insect samples are generally pretreated. Pretreatments include cleaning by washing with water and detergent, drying in an oven or at ambient temperature and grinding into powder to increase accessibility to the chemical agents. Solvent penetration into the particles and thus purification efficiency are greatly affected by corn size. Kim et al. 110 obtained a higher demineralization efficiency and chitosan with a higher degree of deacetylation using ground insect samples instead of non-ground ones. A particle size lower than 200-250 μm is suitable for chitin purification. 90,116,117,132 A fat removal step may be required, especially for those insect samples rich in lipids, such as whole larvae. Larvae can be boiled and passed through an extruder or an oil press to separate unpurified chitin from the liquid fraction, containing mainly lipids and some proteins. 93,109 Demineralization Crustacean shells contain a substantial amount of minerals, which can be up to 50% in crab and shrimp shells. 50 In contrast, insects have a much lower mineral content, generally ranging between 2 and 10% for whole insects. However, this value varies depending on the species and the stage of development. 84,86 The demineralization of insect samples comprises the decomposition of minerals into their respective water-soluble salts. The solubilized salts can be separated from chitin by filtration and washing of the solid phase. Acidic treatment also releases catechol compounds and leads to a slight discoloration of biomass. 115 The demineralization process can be affected by the type and concentration of acid used, treatment time and temperature, particle size of the sample and the solute-to-solvent ratio. 139 Hydrochloric acid is the most preferred reagent used for the demineralization of insect exoskeletons (Table 1). Hydrochloric acid has also been one of the most widely used acids for the demineralization of crustacean shells on an industrial scale. 134 Because of its high environmental impact, hydrochloric acid has been substituted in many cases by organic acids. Furthermore, hydrochloric acid can have detrimental effects on the structure and chemical composition of chitin, 140 as has been confirmed by investigations of Percot et al., 141 who reported a lower molecular weight and a lower degree of acetylation of chitin after demineralization. As a rule of thumb, the harsher the demineralization treatmentin terms of pH, duration and temperaturethe higher is the degree of hydrolysis and the worse are the aforementioned effects on chitin. 142 In contrast to the frequently used hydrochloric acid, only four investigations have reported the use of organic acids for the demineralization of insect biomass. Ibitoye et al. 94 and Song et al. 124 used oxalic acid and Badawy and Mohamed 88 and Hahn et al. 92 used acetic acid and formic acid, respectively.Prior to the chitin purification process, insect samples are generally pretreated.

Kim et al. 110 obtained a higher demineralization efficiency and chitosan with a higher degree of deacetylation using ground insect samples instead of non-ground ones. A particle size lower than 200-250 μm is suitable for chitin purification. 90,116,117,132 A fat removal step may be required, especially for those insect samples rich in lipids, such as whole larvae. Larvae can be boiled and passed through an extruder or an oil press to separate unpurified chitin from the liquid fraction, containing mainly lipids and some proteins. 93,109 Demineralization Crustacean shells contain a substantial amount of minerals, which can be up to 50% in crab and shrimp shells. 50 In contrast, insects have a much lower mineral content, generally ranging between 2 and 10% for whole insects. However, this value varies depending on the species and the stage of development. 84,86 The demineralization of insect samples comprises the decomposition of minerals into their respective water-soluble salts. The solubilized salts can be separated from chitin by filtration and washing of the solid phase. Acidic treatment also releases catechol compounds and leads to a slight discoloration of biomass. 115 The demineralization process can be affected by the type and concentration of acid used, treatment time and temperature, particle size of the sample and the solute-to-solvent ratio. 139 Hydrochloric acid is the most preferred reagent used for the demineralization of insect exoskeletons (Table 1). Hydrochloric acid has also been one of the most widely used acids for the demineralization of crustacean shells on an industrial scale. 134 Because of its high environmental impact, hydrochloric acid has been substituted in many cases by organic acids. Furthermore, hydrochloric acid can have detrimental effects on the structure and chemical composition of chitin, 140 as has been confirmed by investigations of Percot et al., 141 who reported a lower molecular weight and a lower degree of acetylation of chitin after demineralization. As a rule of thumb, the harsher the demineralization treatmentin terms of pH, duration and temperaturethe higher is the degree of hydrolysis and the worse are the aforementioned effects on chitin. 142 In contrast to the frequently used hydrochloric acid, only four investigations have reported the use of organic acids for the demineralization of insect biomass. Ibitoye et al. 94 and Song et al. 124 used oxalic acid and Badawy and Mohamed 88 and Hahn et al. 92 used acetic acid and formic acid, respectively.</p>
        <p>In most cases, the concentration of the acidic solution used for demineralization is 1-2 mol L -1 . Few papers have reported the application of a higher concentration of 4 mol L -1 . 13,64,98 The solute-to-solvent ratio depends on the acid concentration, as it needs two molecules of hydrochloric acid to convert one molecule of calcium carbonate, the main mineral component of the insect exoskeleton, into calcium chloride, carbon dioxide and water. 143 The time taken for demineralization treatment is usually short. Most protocols have reported an incubation time between 30 min and 3 h. In a few cases, the treatment lasted for up to 6 h, 99,103 12 h 114 and 24 h. 101,123,144 The range of temperature used for demineralization varies widely from room temperature to 100 °C. High temperatures are used for very short periods (20-30 min), as reported by Kaya et al. 100 and Monter-Miranda et al. 119 In contrast, longer treatment periods (12-24 h) are applied for incubations done at room temperature. 106,114,123 High temperatures promote the penetration of the solvent into the chitin matrix 145 ; however, they can cause polymer degradation. 25 The efficiency of demineralization (DME) can be evaluated by assessing the mineral content of insect samples before (MC BT ) and after treatment (MC AT ) according to the following equation:In most cases, the concentration of the acidic solution used for demineralization is 1-2 mol L -1 .

        <p>From the scanty data available in the literature on the efficiency of the demineralization of insect biomass, we can observe that the highest efficiency (86-98%) was achieved by Zhou et al., 133 using natural deep eutectic solvents on H. illucens prepupae (Table 1). Of the organic acids used, oxalic acid, used by Ibitoye et al., 94 resulted in a higher degree of demineralization compared to that reported by Kim et al. 110,111 with hydrochloric acid, although a lower concentration of oxalic acid had been used. Demineralization efficiency for the H. illucens larval exoskeleton, reported by Hahn et al., 92 was similar to that obtained by Ibitoye et al., 94 using formic acid. However, additional data on the efficiency of insect demineralization are not available. Thus, future studies should focus on assessing the suitability and optimization of the current methods. Precise evaluation of the efficiency of various acids will enable choosing acids with a lower environmental impact but guarantee good demineralization. For instance, Mahmoud et al. 140 and Ameh et al. 146 have reported that the efficiency of demineralization of shrimp shells using lactic or acetic acids is comparable to that obtained using hydrochloric acid. Values of demineralization efficiency for shrimp shells, using either hydrochloric acid or acetic and lactic acid, as reported by Mahmoud et al., 140 are similar to those obtained by Ibitoye et al. 94 with oxalic acid using insect samples. Organic acids, namely lactic, acetic and oxalic acids, can therefore be a valid alternative to hydrochloric acid for the demineralization of insect biomass. The utilization of organic acids also provides other benefits as they are less harmful to the environment, can preserve the characteristics of purified chitin, can be produced from low-cost biomass and the extracted organic salts can be used for other applications. 140 Once the minerals have been solubilized and removed, the insect biomass is washed with distilled water until its pH is restored to neutral. After the neutralization step, insect samples are subjected to deproteinization.From the scanty data available in the literature on the efficiency of the demineralization of insect biomass, we can observe that the highest efficiency (86-98%) was achieved by Zhou et al., 133 using natural deep eutectic solvents on H. illucens prepupae (Table 1).

        <p>Deproteinization of insect biomass is commonly achieved using alkaline solutions. A wide range of chemicals has been tested as deproteinization reagents with crustacean samples, including sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, calcium hydroxide, sodium sulfite, sodium bisulfite, trisodium phosphate and sodium sulfide. 139 As well as for demineralization, the efficiency of deproteinization depends on the concentration of the alkali, solid-tosolvent ratio and time and temperature of the treatment. 147 Although high temperatures are crucial for deproteinization efficiency, they can cause undesirable side reactions if combined with very long incubation times. These include partial deacetylation of chitin, hydrolysis of the biopolymer (lowering its molecular weight) and change of characteristics. 139,148 Sodium hydroxide is the most widely used base for deproteinization of crustacean biomass for the industrial production of chitin. 149 It has also been widely used for chitin purification from insects (Table 1). Badawy and Mohamed 88 are the only researchers to have used potassium hydroxide to deproteinize insect samples. The use of potassium hydroxide has also been suggested by Fu et al. 150 and Castillo et al. 151 as a more ecofriendly alternative to sodium hydroxide for shrimp deproteinization, as the liquid waste generated using potassium hydroxide is suitable for use as a fertilizer, owing to its high phosphorus, potassium and nitrogen content. 150 However, major deproteinization processes of insect samples have been performed using sodium hydroxide in low concentrations (0.5-2 mol L -1 ). In a few cases, a concentration of 4 mol L -1 has been used. 13,64,97 The incubation time required for the deproteinization of insect biomass varies greatly from a few hours to a few days; however, the treatment typically lasts for 16-20 h (Table 1). Using the same working conditions, long deproteinization times applied to crustacean biomass have been reported to lead to a higher loss of proteins compared to shorter treatments. 152 The deproteinization reaction is generally performed at 80-100 °C, with a few exceptions being 40 °C88 or 175 °C. 98 As well as for demineralization, the efficiency of deproteinization (DPE) can be evaluated by measuring the protein content of insect samples before (PC BD ) and after deproteinization (PC AD ), according to the following equation:Deproteinization of insect biomass is commonly achieved using alkaline solutions.

        <p>Deproteinization efficiency of insect biomass has been mentioned only by Kim et al. 110,111 In both cases a maximum efficiency of 86-87% was achieved by applying 1.25 mol L -1 sodium hydroxide for 3 h at 95 °C on adult specimens of M. domestica 110 and G. bimaculatus. 111 These values are similar to those obtained by Zhou et al., 133 who used natural deep eutectic solvents to remove proteins from H. illucens prepupae. The deproteinization efficiency of sodium hydroxide on crustacean shells at both high and room temperature was 71-76%. 149 Results from chitin purification Information is lacking on the results obtained from chemical demineralization and deproteinization of insect samples. Most papers have reported only chitin yield as the end result of the purification process (Table 1). Chitin yield is measured as the percentage ratio of dry weight of chitin and dry weight of the source material. Chitin yield from insect biomass varied from a minimum of approximately 2%obtained from Vespa crabro larvae, 103 G. bimaculatus adults, 111 Apis mellifera adults 116 and B. mori larvae 122 to a maximum of 36% obtained from A. mellifera adults 120 and cicada sloughs. 11 However, most authors have reported a chitin yield of between 5 and 15% (Table 1). Yields of chitin extracted from shells of crustaceans, mainly shrimps, prawns and crabs, varied from 5 to 32%. 26,64,121,147,[153][154][155][156] Chitin content can vary widely depending on the species, developmental stage and body part of the crustacean. 91,103,153,156 For example, Thirunavukkarasu and Shanmugam 156 reported that the yield of chitin was higher from the cuticle of crab legs than from its carapace and claws. These findings are in accordance with the results of Kaya et al. 99 who found a higher chitin content in the legs than in other body parts of honeybees. Thus, the chitin content of a body part correlates with the mechanical load on that body part. Only Huet et al. 93 and Kaya et al. 103 have measured the degree of purification for chitin extracted from Bombyx eri larvae and three developmental stages of V. crabro, respectively (Table 1). Using various times and temperatures for both demineralization and deproteinization treatments, they obtained similar results, that is, between 93 and 97%. Using natural deep eutectic solvents, Zhou et al. 133 achieved a slightly lower degree of purification (74-91%) from H. illucens prepupae.

For commercial purposes, the color of chitin and chitosan is required to be as white as possible. Thus, an additional step of bleaching is used to remove residual pigments and improve chitin, and thus chitosan, color.Bleaching as the final step Many kinds of pigments and structural colors are involved in the coloration of insect cuticle.

        <p>Industrial methods for purifying chitin from crustacean waste include the use of sodium hypochlorite or hydrogen peroxide as bleaching agents. 158,159 A few papers have reported the use of hydrogen peroxide combined with hydrochloric acid for bleaching insect samples. 115,120 Sometimes sodium hypochlorite 11,94,106,124 or ammonium peroxidisulfate 89 are used, but insect decolorization is performed using a mixture of methanol-chloroform 91,108,109,118,127 or alcohol-chloroform. 64,97 Treatment with potassium permanganate and oxalic acid is also done frequently. 87, 90, 112-114, 117, 128 Even though they are often used, the approaches using organic solvents have no or marginal bleaching efficiency, as they do not break the bonds between chitin and tannins or catecholamines.Industrial methods for purifying chitin from crustacean waste include the use of sodium hypochlorite or hydrogen peroxide as bleaching agents. 158,159 A few papers have reported the use of hydrogen peroxide combined with hydrochloric acid for bleaching insect samples. 115,120 Sometimes sodium hypochlorite 11,94,106,124 or ammonium peroxidisulfate 89 are used, but insect decolorization is performed using a mixture of methanol-chloroform 91,108,109,118,127 or alcohol-chloroform. 64,97 Treatment with potassium permanganate and oxalic acid is also done frequently. 87, 90, 112-114, 117, 128 Even though they are often used, the approaches using organic solvents have no or marginal bleaching efficiency, as they do not break the bonds between chitin and tannins or catecholamines.</p>
        <p>Bleaching treatment of insect samples is performed at room temperature for a short duration (40-90 min). 99,103,106,118 Higher temperatures were applied by Chae et al. 89 (50 °C for 30 min with ammonium peroxidisulfate) and Nemtsev et al. 120 (75 °C for 1 h with hydrogen peroxide). A combination of potassium permanganate and oxalic acid has also been used, where the bleaching step was split into two steps: treatment with potassium permanganate at room temperature and with oxalic acid at high temperatures (60-70 °C). 90,114 Evaluation of the success of the bleaching step using various reagents has not been provided. The bleaching effect of a decolorization treatment can be quantitatively evaluated by measuring the L*, a* and b* values of a sample using a colorimeter, according to the CIELab color system. CIELab is a color space that expresses colors as three values: L* for lightness, a* from green to red and b* from blue to yellow.

The yield of chitosan derived from non-bleached chitin (20-30%) was slightly higher than that of chitosan produced from bleached chitin (16-25%); the degree of deacetylation of the two types of chitosan was similar. 120 Furthermore, chitin bleaching can greatly affect the viscosity of solubilized chitosan. 120,159 After the bleaching treatment is complete, chitin is dried, and characterized to investigate its suitability for a desired application.

        <p>Chitosan is obtained from the deacetylation of chitin (i.e. the removal of acetyl groups from the chitin polymer). The resultant chitosan has a high degree of free amino groups ( NH 2 ) that provides active sites for many chemical reactions, thus making chitosan a versatile polymer that is suitable for several modifications and applications. 159 Furthermore, chitosan has a much higher solubility than chitin and can be dissolved in slightly acidic solutions, while chitin solubilization requires strong and highly concentrated mineral acids 159 or solutions of lithium chloride and organic solvents such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. 161 Chitin can be converted to chitosan by chemical deacetylation. Alternatively, enzymatic deacetylation using deacetylases has also been attempted. The enzymatic activity of various deacetylases towards chitin has been established; however, they are not efficient in converting chitin to chitosan because of the crystallinity of chitin. 135,136,162 Pretreatment of chitin, such as heating, grinding and treating with an alkaline solution, can lead to a higher, yet insufficient, enzymatic activity. 136 Due to this limitation, on an industrial scale, chemical deacetylation is the most commonly used method for chitosan preparation from crustacean waste because of the low cost and suitability for mass production. 139 Deacetylation is performed by incubating chitin in a concentrated solution of sodium hydroxide. Chitin deacetylation can be performed either heterogeneously or homogeneously. In the heterogeneous method, chitin is usually treated with a hot concentrated solution of sodium hydroxide for a few hours. Within the frame of the homogeneous method, chitin is incubated in a concentrated sodium hydroxide solution at room temperature for a few hours, followed by dissolution in crushed ice at 0 °C. 92,139 Heterogeneous conditions result in an irregular distribution of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D-glucosamine units and a blockwise distribution of acetyl groups along the chitosan chain. In contrast, chitosan obtained under homogeneous conditions has a random distribution of acetyl groups along the chain. Hence, chitosans produced using these two methods can have different physicochemical properties. 163 Almost solely chemical heterogeneous deacetylation has been reported for chitosan production from insects with sodium hydroxide being used as the deacetylating agent. In a few cases, sodium hydroxide was combined with sodium borohydride as a 'protecting reagent'. 119,122,132 For heterogeneous deacetylation of insect biomass, the sodium hydroxide concentration ranges from 40 to 60% (i.e. about 15-22 mol L -1 ) (Table 2). In most cases, the deacetylation step lasts from 1 to 9 h, with a few exceptions of longer incubation times of up to 2 days. 104,126 Temperatures of heterogeneous deacetylation of insect samples range from 90 to 150 °C (Table 2). Ideally, deacetylation should result in nondegraded chitosan with a high degree of deacetylation, enabling its solubilization in dilute acidic solutions. 159 The degree of deacetylation is defined as the proportion of glucosamine monomer residues in the chitosan chain and it can affect the solubility and performance of chitosan in many of its applications. 164 Deacetylation can be optimized and adjusted according to need by adjusting various factors, including temperature, time, alkali concentration, solid-to-solvent ratio and particle size.Chitosan is obtained from the deacetylation of chitin (i.e. the removal of acetyl groups from the chitin polymer).

Ideally, deacetylation should result in nondegraded chitosan with a high degree of deacetylation, enabling its solubilization in dilute acidic solutions. 159 The degree of deacetylation is defined as the proportion of glucosamine monomer residues in the chitosan chain and it can affect the solubility and performance of chitosan in many of its applications. 164 Deacetylation can be optimized and adjusted according to need by adjusting various factors, including temperature, time, alkali concentration, solid-to-solvent ratio and particle size.</p>
        <p>Results obtained for chemical heterogeneous deacetylation of insect samples, in terms of chitosan yield, degree of deacetylation and molecular weight, are reported in Table 2. Chitosan yield was calculated from the dry biomass of the original insect biomass or the dry weight of chitin. Chitosan yields measured from the original biomass ranged from 2 to 8%. The highest values (26-28%) were obtained by Song et al. 124 from Chrysomya megacephala larvae and by Luo et al. 113 from cicada sloughs. Chitosan yield calculated from the respective chitin dry weight ranged from 60 to 83% (Table 2). Only Hahn et al. 92 have performed both heterogeneous and homogeneous deacetylation of the H. illucens larval exoskeleton, obtaining more than double the yield of chitosan with the heterogeneous method compared to the homogeneous method. Yields of chitosan produced from crustaceans with heterogeneous deacetylation varied from 4 to 15% (related to the initial dry biomass). 26,113,121,153,156,165 These values are slightly higher than those obtained from insects. The primary reason for that is the presence of larger amounts of protein and fat in insect samples. 166 However, as with chitin, chitosan yield can be affected not only by the purification process, but also by the species and harvest time. 163 Considering the reported data, a unique definition of 'yield' for both chitin and chitosan is needed to make the methods of measurement uniform.Results obtained for chemical heterogeneous deacetylation of insect samples, in terms of chitosan yield, degree of deacetylation and molecular weight, are reported in Table 2.

        <p>The degree of deacetylation of chitosan produced from insects with heterogeneous deacetylation varied between 62 and 98% (Table 2). A lower value has been reported only by Monter-Miranda et al. 119 who obtained 57% deacetylated chitosan from Brachystola magna adults. The degree of deacetylation of chitosan extracted from crustaceans with the heterogeneous method normally ranges from 56 to 98%, 167 while the average degree of deacetylation obtained with homogeneous treatment is 48-55%. 139 At least 80-85% deacetylation is necessary for the good solubility of chitosan. 167 The degree of deacetylation can be increased or decreased by changing temperature, time and sodium hydroxide concentration. 159 Moreover, there is a correlation between temperature and rate of deacetylation: high temperatures can increase deacetylation, whereas long residence times can improve deacetylation but only up to a certain point. For instance, alkali treatment using 50% sodium hydroxide at 100 °C beyond 2 h does not deacetylate crustacean-based chitin further significantly; rather it can degrade the polymer chain. 159 Chitosan is a biopolymer of high molecular weight, which varies depending on the source and deacetylation treatment applied. The molecular weight of crustacean-based chitosan ranges from 100 to 1000 kDa. 25,26 Chitosan produced from insects has a molecular weight ranging from 26 to 300 kDa (Table 2). Very low values (3 and 7 kDa) have been reported, too. 91,96,127 High reaction temperatures (150 °C) combined with long incubation times (4-6 h) may have caused polymer degradation. The use of standard chitosans with known molecular weights can be useful to assess the validity of the applied analysis method. However, differences in chitosan molecular weights can also be related to the insect species, as shown by Kim et al., 111 who applied the same deacetylation conditions as Kaya et al. 96 and obtained a chitosan with a much higher molecular weight (308 kDa from adult crickets versus approximately 3 kDa from both adults and larvae of the Colorado potato beetle). A very high molecular weight (3290-5900 kDa) has been reported by Paulino et al. 122 for chitosan produced from silkworm using 40% sodium hydroxide and sodium borohydride at 100 °C. This could be because sodium borohydride prevents oxidative cleavage of glycosidic bonds during deacetylation.The degree of deacetylation of chitosan produced from insects with heterogeneous deacetylation varied between 62 and 98% (Table 2).

        <p>Deacetylation treatment conditions can affect chitosan molecular weight and thus its physicochemical properties or bioactivity. Notably, molecular weight has a great influence on the biological activity of chitosan: chitosan with low molecular weight (i.e. lower than 150 kDa) has good antibacterial properties. 168,169 Studies carried out on bacteria potentially pathogenic to humans, such as Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus and E. coli, have confirmed that low-molecular-weight chitosan has a greater effect on reducing microorganism growth and multiplication. 168,169 Small chitosan chains have higher mobility, attraction and ionic interaction than long chains, facilitating an effective binding of chitosan to the membrane surfaces of bacteria. 168 To evaluate the suitability of chitin and chitosan for desired applications, they need to be characterized. Several metrics can be used to assess chitin and chitosan characteristics and properties, such as degree of deacetylation, molecular weight, viscosity, morphology and solubility.

        <p>Infrared spectroscopy is the most frequently applied method to examine insect-based chitin and chitosan; especially to determine the degree of deacetylation of the polysaccharides. The technique, which exploits infrared light to obtain data from excited vibrational states of the functional groups in a sample, enables rapid analysis. According to the functional groups contained in the molecules, the most significant bands of insect-based chitin and chitosan occur at wavenumbers of 1310-1320 cm -1 (CN stretching, amide III), 1550-1560 cm -1 (NH bending, amide II), 1590-1600 cm -1 (NH 2 bending), 1650-1655 cm -1 (CO stretching, amide I), 3100-3110 cm -1 (NH symmetric stretching), 3255-3270 cm -1 (NH asymmetric stretching) and 3430-3450 cm -1 (OH stretching) 170,171 (Fig. 3).

        <p>The most practical application of this method has been for determining the degree of acetylation of investigated samples by calculating and comparing the absorption values measured at specific wavelengths. 89 Accurate quantification is challenging 172 ; comparability and significance are minor due to the different bands applied for calculating the degree of acetylation by different researchers. Further sources of errors can be individualspecific or due to inappropriate baseline settings within the spectra and impurities in the sample, e.g. the presence of proteins can lead to an overlap of the characteristic chitin and chitosan peaks in the infrared spectrum and thus to wrong values. 22,173 In the authors' opinion, infrared spectra used to obtain valid information or even quantitative values from insect-based chitin and chitosan are of limited conclusiveness.

        <p>X-ray diffraction measurements of insect-based chitin revealed strong significant peaks at 9-11°and 19-20°, in addition to minor peaks at 12-13°, ∼21°, ∼23°and ∼26°. 91,112,126,128,131 These peaks are valid for the highly symmetric orthorhombic crystal structure of insect chitin, representing the ⊍-polymorphic form. However, there are exceptions: Chitin from the cocoons of a moth (Orgyia dubia) is in the γ-form, exhibiting an X-ray diffraction pattern with high homology to the diffractogram obtained for ⊍-chitin, differing from each other mainly in the peak at 12.9°. 144 γ-Chitin and ⊎-chitin are polymorphs with a lower degree of order than ⊍-chitin, making these polymorphs more reactive. For example, ⊎-chitin is more accessible to swelling and for enzymatic and chemical reactions than the ⊍-form, 14 and therefore more readily undergoes crystal disintegration. Thus, the conversion of ⊎-chitin results in chitosan with lower crystallinity compared to chitosan obtained by deacetylation of ⊍-chitin. 175 Previous studies have confirmed that chitosan exists as two crystalline polymorphs, either as a hydrated polysaccharide ('tendon' form) 176 or as an anhydrous form ('annealed' chitosan). 177 The presence of crystallites or crystalline regions in the amorphous regions of chitosan could be due to the unreacted chitin. 178 The position of the X-ray peaks in the diffractogram is similar for insect-based chitosan and chitin and comparable to peak positions determined for commercially available chitosan. 89 Main peaks for the chitosan crystal structure can be identified at 2⊔ of ∼10°and ∼20°. 91,113,116 The crystallinity index for chitin and chitosan is commonly calculated using the relation of the peak intensities measured at 16°(I am ), which is attributable to the amorphous content of the sample, and at 20°(I 110 ) according to the equation of Segal et al. 179 :X-ray diffraction measurements of insect-based chitin revealed strong significant peaks at 9-11°and 19-20°, in addition to minor peaks at 12-13°, ∼21°, ∼23°and ∼26°. 91,112,126,128,131 These peaks are valid for the highly symmetric orthorhombic crystal structure of insect chitin, representing the ⊍-polymorphic form.

        <p>The reported crystallinity values for chitin vary greatly and cover a wide range (40-90%) but are mainly between 60 and 80%. 91,93,94,126,132 The broad range of values reported is due to the varied sources, different purification methods used and is a function of the drying, storage or preprocessing conditions. 128 Grinding of chitin is, for example, an effective method for decreasing its crystallinity, disturbing the overall structure of the polysaccharide. 178 Hence, there is a clear need to independently determine all significant factors that affect the crystallinity of insect-based chitin and chitosan using X-ray-based investigations. The authors believe that low crystallinity values achieved for insect-based chitin and chitosan are of major importance and are highly relevant for most applications. For instance, lower crystallinity of chitosan facilitates its solubility in acidic solutions, increases its sorption ability and increases the accessibility of the primary free amino groups of chitosan. 180,181 Thermogravimetric analysis Similar to X-ray diffraction analysis, thermogravimetric analysis has also been used to determine the polymorphic form of insect-based chitin. Additionally, the temperature at which chitin and chitosan completely decompose can be measured by thermogravimetric analysis. The method records mass loss of a sample over time as temperature increases and is visualized in a thermogram. For insect chitin, thermograms exhibit two decomposition steps.

        <p>A second peak at 300-400 °C is caused by the dehydration of the saccharide backbone, polymerization of the degradation products and decomposition of the acetyl function. 122 The amount of mass lost during this second decomposition step ranges from 50 to 95%. 102,103,105,128 The maximal thermal degradation temperature (DTG max ), which corresponds to the temperature at which the highest mass loss is determined, is in a more narrow temperature range: DTG max values for chitin from different body parts of Z. morio, Melolontha sp., A. pandora or H. illucens have been evaluated to be 350-390 °C, indicating the presence of the ⊍-form. 98,100,103,126 DTG max values obtained for ⊍-chitin isolated from marine fishery waste are in the same range. 11,93 Typically, ⊍-chitin has a higher second decomposition temperature than ⊎-chitin, 102 which is attributed to the lower crystallinity of the latter. 182 Sometimes, a third decomposition peak at temperatures above 700 °C has been reported which is attributed to residual minerals not removed during demineralization. 11 The thermograms of insect-based chitin do not reveal large deviations to the chitosan produced.

Although complementary to several other methods, the determination of degree of acetylation (DA) of insect-based chitin and degree of deacetylation (DD) of insect-based chitosan via elemental analysis is of high practical relevance, 184,185 and is calculated using the following equations 186,187 :</p>
        <p>Theoretically, fully acetylated chitin contains 6.9% nitrogen and fully deacetylated chitosan contains 8.7% nitrogen. 188 Assuming 100% purity of samples, the higher the nitrogen content the lower is the degree of acetylation and vice versa. Typically, the measured nitrogen content for insect-based chitin is lower than the theoretical value, resulting in an overestimationaccording to Eqn (4)of the degree of acetylation. For example, Erdogan and Kaya 91 used elemental analysis to determine the nitrogen content of chitin from D. maroccanus adults and nymphs at 4.6 and 5.7%, resulting in degrees of acetylation of 232 and 187%, respectively. Degrees of acetylation exceeding 100% have been determined for chitin extracted from D. maroccanus and species such as O. asellus (169%) and V. crabro (127%). 64,103,109,115 The validity of the conclusions is hence severely limited. It can be assumed that these overestimations result from nitrogen-free impurities, such as lipids and sugars, in samples, which make up to 43% of edible insects such as A. domesticus and T. molitor. 189 The overestimation of the degree of acetylation pertains to chitin from insects. It is different for insect-based chitosan and the determination of its degree of deacetylation via elemental analysis. The degree of deacetylation for chitosan obtained from the conversion of chitin from Z. morio and B. mori ranges from 52 to 95%, 126,132 which are reasonable values. It can be assumed that the validity of these values is due to a higher degree of purification of chitosan, in contrast to the insect-based chitin samples containing a significant amount of impurities. The conversion steps from chitin to chitosan involve severe conditions such as use of high temperature and sodium hydroxide concentration, followed by selective precipitation of chitosan from solution by pH neutralization. These steps provide additional purification, resulting in valid calculations of degrees of deacetylation for insect-based chitosan using elemental analysis.Theoretically, fully acetylated chitin contains 6.9% nitrogen and fully deacetylated chitosan contains 8.7% nitrogen. 188 Assuming 100% purity of samples, the higher the nitrogen content the lower is the degree of acetylation and vice versa.

        <p>However, the presence of impurities in both chitin and chitosan cannot be excluded. As already mentioned in the chitin purification and deacetylation section of this review, purity can be determined only for a minority of chitins and chitosans produced from insects. For accurate degree of acetylation of chitin or degree of deacetylation of chitosan, pre-quantification of impurities is mandatory. Nevertheless, a thorough and effective purification is crucial to provide unimpeded characterization of insect-based chitin and chitosan using various methods.However, the presence of impurities in both chitin and chitosan cannot be excluded.

        <p>The so-called viscosity-average molecular weight of insect-based chitosan can be determined by measuring the intrinsic viscosity of a solution using an Ubbelohde viscometer. Molecular weight determination is based on the fact that the viscosity of the solution, in addition to the degree of deacetylation, depends on the molar mass of chitosan. Previous studies have reported a value for insect chitosan viscosity-average molecular weight in the range of 426-450 kDa. 87,114 Other authors have determined much lower values (&lt;10 kDa) for D. maroccanus and L. decemlineata chitosan. 91,96 Odote et al. 121 investigated the viscosityaverage molecular weight of lobster, prawn and crab chitosan in comparison to that of chitosan from blowfly larvae and found similar values for all chitosans, which is potentially due to their similar chitin conversion conditions. The same authors also stated that the viscosity-average molecular weight of insect chitosan decreases with higher deacetylation temperature and incubation time, confirming that the applied conversion parameters are more significant than the origin of chitin used for deacetylation. Another application for viscometry is to record the progress of chitosan hydrolysis: Nemtsev et al. 120 reported a decrease of honeybee-derived chitosan viscosity-average molecular weight during enzymatic hydrolysis in slightly acidic solution from 257 to 21 kDa.The so-called viscosity-average molecular weight of insect-based chitosan can be determined by measuring the intrinsic viscosity of a solution using an Ubbelohde viscometer.

        <p>In contrast to chitosan, chitin solubility is limited to a few solvents. Nevertheless, Draczynski reported that the solubilization of honeybee chitin in dimethylacetamide-LiCl results in a viscosity-average molecular weight of 426-738 kDa that depends on the time of deproteinization. 90 More sophisticated methods and instruments are required, instead of the standard laboratory Ubbelohde viscometer, for measuring weight-average and number-average molecular weights and polydispersity or molecular weight distribution of chitin and chitosan. For example, gel permeation chromatography measurements with a multi-angle laser light scattering detector revealed a molecular weight for insect-based chitosan of approximately 308 kDa and a polydispersity index of 1.2. 111 However, viscosity-average molecular weight as an outcome is important as it affects many other physicochemical or application-specific investigations, such as bioactivity, adhesion force and gelation properties.In contrast to chitosan, chitin solubility is limited to a few solvents.

        <p>Various surface morphologies have been described for insectbased chitin: rough or smooth surfaces with or without pores and/or fibrils. 116 The range of diversity of various chitin surfaces derived from insects is shown in Fig. 4. However, most chitin surfaces extracted from insects exhibit a rough fibrillary structure with pores. The diameter of the fibrils ranges from 10 to 50 nm, 64,91,101,108 and the chitin fibrils are surrounded by a protein matrix. 190 The pore diameters range from 100 to 500 nm. The highly porous structure increases the accessible surface area and thus the adsorption capacity of the material.Various surface morphologies have been described for insectbased chitin: rough or smooth surfaces with or without pores and/or fibrils. 116 The range of diversity of various chitin surfaces derived from insects is shown in Fig. 4.

        <p>Scanning electron microscopy imaging of insect-based chitosan has been performed in only a small number of studies. Kaya et al. 101 reported chitosan with a surface morphology similar to that of the chitin from which it was derived, which suggests that the chitin structure is preserved in chitosan. The surface morphology of chitin also depends on other factors. It can be influenced by characteristics inherent to the natural source, such as species, 95,118 sex 13 or body part, 99 and by process conditions, such as the selected pretreatment procedure. Moreover, chitin content, degree of purification and washing procedure can play a major role as the surrounding matrix and matrix constituents on the surface not removed during purification mask the chitin. Due to this, the validity of this method for investigating chitin and chitosan is limited. However, knowledge of the surface structure of chitin and chitosan is important for processes in which surface architecture greatly affects functionality.Scanning electron microscopy imaging of insect-based chitosan has been performed in only a small number of studies.

        <p>The methods described are the most frequently mentioned analytical techniques applied for the investigation of insect-based chitin and chitosan. The major conclusion from screening the analysis results is that there is a high structural and chemical homology between chitin and chitosan derived from insects and marine animals. However, despite the large amount of available data, knowledge gaps exist that need to be filled in prospective studies to assess the potential of insect-based chitin and chitosan. What has already been said for chitin yield and degree of purification also holds true here: there is a lack of valid data and/or the results were not properly evaluated or discussed to accelerate research on this topic. For example, many infrared spectra from chitins and chitosans from different sources are available, which are nearly the same as each other and provide no additional information. Similarly, thermogravimetric analysis data have limited validity as the DTG max values reported are in the same temperature range. In contrast, X-ray data show strongly varying crystallinity values for chitin and chitosan. Thus, it is unclear if the data presented are a result of processing conditions, life cycle stage or body part of the insect.The methods described are the most frequently mentioned analytical techniques applied for the investigation of insect-based chitin and chitosan.

        <p>Hence, the authors suggest firstly performing comprehensive studies to identify parameters that contribute significantly to the properties of insect-based chitin and chitosan. Secondly, the authors strongly believe that spectroscopic and chromatographic data would be more valid if they were related to the degree of purification of the chitin and chitosan investigated. Therefore, it is necessary to first determine the purity of polysaccharides after extraction and deacetylation since contaminations can disrupt accurate measurements of degree of deacetylation. Elemental analysis is a tool which could be applied to, at least, estimate the degree of purification and to evaluate if the measurements performed are valid. Thirdly, there is a need to standardize the calculation methods and equations; for example, to agree on specific bands and peaks used for calculation when determining crystallinity via X-ray spectroscopy. Fourthly, we recommend using statistical software to evaluate the results and to increase the information content of a presented data set. In our opinion, infrared spectroscopy can reveal degrees of deacetylation and impurity content accurately if evaluated using multivariate data analysis or similar methods. Lastly, techniques such as titrationbased methods can be applied for higher sensitivity in determining degree of deacetylation. Although revealing a precise determination method, titration is time-consuming. Another highly accurate and automatable tool, to determine the degree of deacetylation of chitin and chitosan in solid state or solubilized, is NMR spectroscopy. Several studies exhibited the potential of 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and 15 N NMR spectroscopy to determine the degree of deacetylation, the distribution of acetyl groups and the cross-linkages of the chitin and chitosan. [191][192][193] Possibly due to the need for enhanced equipment and specific expertise, comprehensive studies concerning insect-based chitin and chitosan are lacking. We further recommend performing application-based investigations, such as measurement of viscosity, adhesion, film formation and adsorption capacity. For successful commercialization of insect-based chitin and chitosan, such detailed knowledge is mandatory.Hence, the authors suggest firstly performing comprehensive studies to identify parameters that contribute significantly to the properties of insect-based chitin and chitosan.

        <p>Chitin and especially chitosan are natural polymers with many useful properties and are widely used in a broad range of applications. Presently, the main commercial source of chitin and chitosan comprises waste streams from the marine fishery industry; however, their availability is limited by geography and season. The recent increase in demand for chitin and chitosan in the global market has drawn attention to alternative sources independent of marine fishery waste. Insect breeding farms, which are used for waste management through insect-mediated bioconversion or for producing proteins and fats from larval stages, are being launched worldwide. In addition to the production of valuable compounds, insect breeding generates several side streams (dead adults, exuviae, exoskeletons, frass and residual feed) that have not yet been valorized. These side streams provide a cheap source of chitin, which is abundantly available and not regionally or seasonally limited. Furthermore, the chitin content of exuviae and exoskeletons exceeds 23%, 78 suggesting favorable conditions for chitin and chitosan production in the future.Chitin and especially chitosan are natural polymers with many useful properties and are widely used in a broad range of applications.

        <p>In contrast, the chitin content of whole insects is generally lower. 78,85 Due to the moderate content, insect breeding only for chitin isolation is not economically feasible without cascade usage of other compounds derived from the insect breeding.In contrast, the chitin content of whole insects is generally lower. 78,85 Due to the moderate content, insect breeding only for chitin isolation is not economically feasible without cascade usage of other compounds derived from the insect breeding.</p>
        <p>The chitin content in insects is a function of species, type of feed and of life cycle stage. Moreover, the life cycle stage determines the complexity of the matrix in which chitin is embedded. Insects undergo sclerotization during metamorphosis to the adult stage. Sclerotization comprises cross-linkage of the insect cuticle with catecholic compounds. This makes necessary a more sophisticated purification process and at least one additional bleaching step to isolate pure chitin from insect biomass. On the contrary, decolorization is not mandatory for chitin purification from marine fishery waste. The need for bleaching arises because the chitin isolated from dead adult insects and exuviae contains these sclerotized structures with dark colour. Chitin production can be more economically feasible from side streams of insects bred for a different purpose.The chitin content in insects is a function of species, type of feed and of life cycle stage.

        <p>The purification of chitin begins earlier in the process and comprises fractionating the chitin-containing compounds from those with no or low chitin. Although insect breeding, for the isolation of protein and fat, is a highly automated and controlled operating process, a mechanical process for separating chitinrich substances needs to be developed to eliminate the current practice of manual collection. Similarly, manual collection of chitin-rich material is opposed to the prospective application of insect-based chitosan in medicine and requires good manufacturing practice or laboratory-like controlled conditions. Furthermore, the raw materials used for insect breeding vary according to availability (e.g. vegetable waste from agri-food chain, cereal straw, distillers' grains and cereal meals). Although insect-mediated bioconversion is a flexible and robust process and leads to a high-quality fat and protein fraction almost independent of the varying quality of the side streams, it is challenging for an automated process to lead to chitin and chitosan with a consistent composition.The purification of chitin begins earlier in the process and comprises fractionating the chitin-containing compounds from those with no or low chitin.

        <p>Currently, chitin purification from insect biomass is an area of focus for researchers and is mainly performed on a laboratory scale using the same methods applied for purification from crustacean shells. Most available literature on chitin and chitosan production from insects is limited to a description of the chitin extraction process and its subsequent deacetylation into chitosan. Information on the quantitative evaluation of extraction, purification, deacetylation and bleaching efficiency, and the degree of purification of products is missing. In the case of insects, it is especially important to assess the bleaching process, as insect exuviae undergo sclerotization by catecholamine linkage, which leads to dark coloration. 85,194 These factors hinder accurate assessment of the economic potential of chitin and chitosan production from insects and comparison with the process chain of chitin isolation from crab shells.Currently, chitin purification from insect biomass is an area of focus for researchers and is mainly performed on a laboratory scale using the same methods applied for purification from crustacean shells.

Alternatives to traditional chemical purification methods should also be considered to make the process more environmentally friendly.
