        <p>Cellular circular RNAs (circRNAs) are generated by head-totail splicing and are present in all multicellular organisms studied so far. Recently, circRNAs have emerged as a large class of RNA which can function as post-transcriptional regulators. It has also been shown that many circRNAs are tissueand stage-specifically expressed. Moreover, the unusual stability and expression specificity make circRNAs important candidates for clinical biomarker research. Here, we present a circRNA expression resource of 20 human tissues highly relevant to disease-related research: vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), human umbilical vein cells (HUVECs), artery endothelial cells (HUAECs), atrium, vena cava, neutrophils, platelets, cerebral cortex, placenta, and samples from mesenchymal stem cell differentiation. In eight different samples from a single donor, we found highly tissue-specific circRNA expression. Circular-to-linear RNA ratios revealed that many circRNAs were expressed higher than their linear host transcripts. Among the 71 validated circRNAs, we noticed potential biomarkers. In adenosine deaminase-deficient, severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID) patients and in Wiskott-Aldrich-Syndrome (WAS) patients' samples, we found evidence for differential circRNA expression of genes that are involved in the molecular pathogenesis of both phenotypes. Our findings underscore the need to assess circRNAs in mechanisms of human disease.Cellular circular RNAs (circRNAs) are generated by head-totail splicing and are present in all multicellular organisms studied so far.

        <p>Cellular circular RNAs (circRNAs) represent a class of singlestranded, unusually stable RNAs originating from 5′-to-3′ transcription of coding gene exons or long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that produce covalently closed head-to-tail (or backspliced) circularized transcripts [1][2][3][4]. Many circRNAs are tissueand developmental stage-specifically expressed [2,4]. The circRNA co-transcriptional splicing can compete with linear splicing events and can depend on the binding of the RNA-binding proteins, MBNL1 or QKI, in intronic sequences [5,6]. Intronic complementary sequences, inter alia repetitive elements, and the RNA-editing protein, ADAR1, were linked to the circularization of exons [7,8]. Earlier, the circRNAs CDR1as (ciRS-7) and circSRY were shown to exhibit important functions in sponging miRNAs and thereby functioning as post-transcriptional regulators [2,9,10]. circRNAs are resistant to the exonuclease RNase R that solely digests linear transcripts. This feature can be used to validate circRNA candidates by comparing their abundance in the RNase R-treated and untreated samples [11]. circRNAs found in clinical specimens, like blood, reveal that these abundant transcripts could serve as biomarkers [12]. Here, we present a circRNA resource catalog to supplement existing databases with new circRNA transcripts in human cell types. By identifying and validating selected circRNAs in these human tissues relevant to clinical research, we provide multiple examples of abundant and highly tissue-specific circRNA expression in host genes that have been associated with pathogenesis of human disease.Cellular circular RNAs (circRNAs) represent a class of singlestranded, unusually stable RNAs originating from 5′-to-3′ transcription of coding gene exons or long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that produce covalently closed head-to-tail (or backspliced) circularized transcripts [1][2][3][4].

        <p>Adipose tissue was extracted during lipo-aspiration of MSCs from upper abdominal fat. The tissue was rinsed with PBS on Teflon fleece to wash out erythrocytes. Fat spheres were subsequently frozen in liquid nitrogen. Neutrophils were extracted from peripheral whole blood that was supplemented with 30% of dextran. Cells settled down in a syringe after 30 min. The upper phase was under-laid with histopaque 1083. After centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 1200 rpm, speed was slowed down to 1050 rpm after 15 min for another 15 min. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 10 ml water for water lysis. For neutralization, 3.33 ml of 3.6% NaCl was added for 10 min. After 10 min centrifugation at 1050 rpm, pelleted neutrophils were resuspended in TRIzol® Reagent (Ambion). Plasma, serum, and platelets were prepared using the Vacutainer system. Whole blood in serum tubes was left undisturbed for clot formation. After 15-30 min, the clot was centrifuged at 1000×g for 10 min and the supernatant serum was immediately frozen at -80 °C. Plasma was prepared from whole blood in EDTA tubes. After a centrifugation at 2000×g for 10 min, the supernatant was frozen. Citrate tubes were used to obtain platelets. The whole blood was centrifuged for 15 min at 100×g without rotor break, preventing platelets' activation. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were extracted from umbilical cord blood and expanded in vitro using the Lonza EGM™-2 kit. Human umbilical vein cells (HUVECs) were freshly prepared using standard techniques from umbilical cord and cultivated until passage four in EGM medium (Lonza).

        <p>RNA preparation for RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analysis of selected circRNA candidates RNA was prepared using TRIzol® Reagent (Ambion) and phenol/chloroform precipitation. For Illumina sequencing, rRNA depletion was done with the RiboMinus™ eukaryote kit according to manufacturer's recommendation (Life Technologies). Bioanalyzer measurement validated the successful rRNA depletion. The Illumina TruSeq sample preparation kit (v2) was used to generate the libraries for sequencing. For qRT-PCR, total RNA of the identical samples that were used for RNA-seq was digested with RNase R (3 U/μg RNA, Epicenter Technologies) and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with following inactivation for 3 min at 95 °C. To reach similarly effective RNase R treatment, all samples were treated simultaneously in one approach. Then, the RNA was spiked with 10% of Caenorhabditis elegans total RNA. After phenol/chloroform precipitation, the RNA was reverse transcribed using RevertAid first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas) or Maxima RT kit (ThermoFisher Scientific), and SYBR-green quantification (Roche) was performed according to standard protocols on ABI 7500 or StepOnePlus (ThermoScientific). Oligonucleotides flanking the circRNA head-to-tail junctions were designed in Primer3 (v. 0.4.0). RNase R assays were normalized to C. elegans eif3d spiked-in RNA and to human GAPDH or Vinculin. For experiments on WAS and ADA-SCID samples, ΔCt was calculated compared to 28S rRNA. In general, expression was quantified applying the ΔΔCt method. qRT-PCR products were analyzed for amplicon size, specificity, and integrity on 3% agarose gels; concatemers were not taken into account. Sanger sequencing of qRT-PCR products was performed using the Big Dye® Terminator Cycle Sequencing on the 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (ABI) using

Peptides were separated on an in-house prepared nano-LC column (0.074 mm × 250 mm, 3 μm Reprosil C 18 , Dr. Maisch GmbH).

        <p>We generated a circRNA resource catalog for various research interests by sequencing ribosomal RNA-depleted total RNA (Supplemental Table S1). The head-to-tail splice junction identification and the sequence analysis were done according to previously published protocols (Supplemental Fig. S1), [2,24]. The circRNA catalog can be retrieved in Supplemental S2 or circBase, http://www.circbase.org/ [24]. We selected circRNA candidates for validation according to either of the following criteria: (i) the candidate originated from disease or developmental genes (Table 1); (ii) the linear host transcripts have been proposed as biomarkers; (iii) the circRNA was not present in circBase; (iv) the circRNA was encoded from a lncRNA; or (v) the circRNA showed extraordinary genomic length or expression determined via the read count. In total, we selected 112 candidates, of which we validated 71 circRNAs by RNase R assays (validation rate 63.4%, see BMethods^, Supplemental Fig. S2a-b p).

        <p>First, we analyzed circRNA expression during MSC differentiation. MSCs were differentiated into proliferating chondrocytes, osteocytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Flow cytometry revealed CD105 + , CD90 + , CD73 + , HLA-ABC + , CD31 -, CD34 -, CD45 -, and HLA-DR -cells and the multi-lineage potential validated MSC properties [46,48]. In MSCs, we detected 55 circRNAs, in contrast to 148 in MSC-derived chondrocytes, 104 in osteocytes, or 137 in VSMCs. In chondrocytes, we validated a circRNA deriving from PLOD2, a gene which forms collagen crosslinks and was differentially expressed in a model of osteoarthritis-related synovial fibrosis [25]. During the abdominal fat aspiration to obtain MSCs, we additionally harvested adipose tissue that harbors the MSC niches [49]. In the abdominal fat of the same MSC donor, we identified 507 circRNAs. We confirmed a circRNA in SORBS1, a gene inhibiting the induction of glucose transport by insulin, and two circRNAs in PLIN4, a gene stimulating lipolysis in adipocytes (Supplemental Fig. S2a-d) [50,51]. When comparing different MSC-derived tissues, we commonly observed different circRNA isoforms spliced from the same host genes in different MSC-derived cells. Solely eight circRNAs overlapped between adipose tissue, MSCs, and their derived cells (Supplemental Table S2). In eight different tissues of one healthy donor, we excluded interindividual differences and found tissue-restricted expression patterns (Fig. 1a). The absence of circRNA housekeeper and direct comparisons of circRNA expressions between different tissues are controversially discussed endeavors. Thus, we selected the top 10% circRNA candidates within MSCs and MSCderived cells and clustered 31 circRNAs candidates based on their expression levels: Bnot detected,^Bdetected^with at least two reads, or Bhighly expressed^when detected within the top 10% of the candidates (Fig. 1c). We observed ubiquitous expression for some circRNAs and differential expression regarding the MSC-derived cells. We validated selected circRNA candidates within the cluster analysis showing RNase R resistance and confirmed the results of clustering (Fig. 1d and Supplemental Fig. 2q).

Of the 211 circRNAs in HUAECs, only two overlapped with the other tissues. EFEMP1, an angiogenesis promoter, poor prognostic marker in ovarian cancer, and potential therapeutic target in glioblastoma treatment, harbored a circRNA in HUVECs (22 circRNAs) [26,52]. As previously described, we analyzed the top 10% of the circRNA candidates. A pool of 43 circRNAs showed differential expression and we validated two circRNAs (Fig. 2a, b and Supplemental Fig. 2q).Next, we compared physiologically neighboring tissues: umbilical cord, endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), HUVECs, and HUAECs. Of the 211 circRNAs in HUAECs, only two overlapped with the other tissues. EFEMP1, an angiogenesis promoter, poor prognostic marker in ovarian cancer, and potential therapeutic target in glioblastoma treatment, harbored a circRNA in HUVECs (22 circRNAs) [26,52].

        <p>In cerebral cortex (339 circRNAs), we validated circRNAs spliced from important cerebral genes. ERC2 is involved in neurotransmitter release and expresses a circRNA [53]. Five circRNA isoforms were found in ATRNL1, a gene regulating the energy homeostasis by melanocortins in the hippocampus [54]. Another circRNA is hosted by NTRK2, a gene that was associated with synaptic dysfunction in Huntington's disease and neuronal differentiation and plasticity in hippocampus [27][28][29]. We validated a circRNA in RTN4, a gene inhibiting axonal sprouting and modulating Alzheimer's disease progression in a mouse model and one of two predicted circRNAs in HOMER1, a gene that is involved in synaptic activity and various neurological disorders [30][31][32]. Three circRNAs were expressed in ATXN10 that maintains the survival of neurons, studied in the spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (Supplemental Fig. S2g) [33].In cerebral cortex (339 circRNAs), we validated circRNAs spliced from important cerebral genes.

        <p>In placenta, we detected 63 circRNAs, in comparison to 173 in decidua; 15 circRNAs overlapped. We confirmed a circRNA in PSG5, a gene encoding a pregnancy-specific glycoprotein. Low levels indicate pregnancy complications [34]. Severe early onset preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and HELLP syndrome were associated with high expression of PAPPA2 that encoded two circRNAs [35][36][37][38]. ALPP, less expressed and active in hyperglycemic and diabetic placentas of pregnant women infected with or without Trypanosoma cruzi, harbored a circRNA (Supplemental Fig. S2h) [39].In placenta, we detected 63 circRNAs, in comparison to 173 in decidua; 15 circRNAs overlapped.

        <p>We also obtained right atrial tissue and vena cava from two children with multiple cardiac defects. Atrium (340 circRNAs) and vena cava (702) had an intersection of 115 circRNAs; 51 overlapped with calf muscle. In atrium, we validated a circRNA in NPPA, a gene that was associated with development of type 2 diabetes [40]. NPPA is reactivated in response to cardiovascular disorders and converted to its active form by CORIN, which harbored four circRNAs (validated in atrium and vena cava) and could be potential biomarkers for heart failure [41,42]. Atrial fibrillation was linked to the dysfunction of RYR2, which also produces seven circRNA isoforms in atrium and ten in vena cava [43]. Mutations in myosin heavy chains cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathies [44]. In myosin MYH6, we validated one circRNA. QKI is involved in circRNA biogenesis [6], is responsible for cardiovascular development, and encodes two circRNAs in atrium and vena cava [55]. Alterations in the regulation and expression of SLC8A1 (two circRNAs in atrium) contribute to various cardiovascular symptoms (Supplemental Fig. S2i-k) [45].We also obtained right atrial tissue and vena cava from two children with multiple cardiac defects.

        <p>Platelets expressed 3324 circRNAs. Platelets derive from bone marrow megakaryocytes, lack nuclei and highly abundant mRNA reservoirs, although translational capabilities are intact [56][57][58][59]. Previously, high circRNA expression and circRNA properties were described in platelets and this enrichment was associated with transcriptome degradation [60]. We found in our data that platelets harbored much more abundantly expressed circRNAs than any other tissue. For example, circRNA expression in ACVR2A and SMARCA5 was extremely high compared to mRNA (Supplemental Fig. S3). We validated circRNAs in the phosphodiesterases PDE3A, PDE4D, and PDE5A. PDEs hydrolyze cAMP and cGMP to control blood vessel relaxation, cardiac contractility, and inhibition of platelet aggregation [61][62][63][64]. PDE3A was previously associated with Mendelian hypertension [46,65]. Moreover, the guanylate cyclase GUCY1B3 converting GTP into cGMP expressed a circRNA (Supplemental Fig. 2l-o) [66].Platelets expressed 3324 circRNAs.

        <p>CircRNA expression in plasma (57), serum (39), suggested that circRNAs could be secreted, as it was shown earlier for micro-and other RNAs, and indicated by circRNAs identified in cell culture or serum exosomes [67][68][69][70][71].CircRNA expression in plasma (57), serum (39), suggested that circRNAs could be secreted, as it was shown earlier for micro-and other RNAs, and indicated by circRNAs identified in cell culture or serum exosomes [67][68][69][70][71].</p>
        <p>In neutrophils (274 circRNAs), TLR6 functions in the innate immune response and harbored a circRNA [72]. Another key component in the immune system expressing a circRNA in neutrophils is MYO1F, a class I myosin regulating the host defense against infection [73]. No overlap between plasma, serum, neutrophils, and platelets facilitates the idea of tissuerestricted circRNA expression. For clustering, we used all plasma and serum circRNAs, the top 10% of neutrophils and the top 5% of platelets and validated four candidates (Fig. 2c,d and Supplemental Fig. 2q).In neutrophils (274 circRNAs), TLR6 functions in the innate immune response and harbored a circRNA [72].

        <p>Due to the lack of nuclei and the highly abundant circRNAs in platelets, we hypothesized that circRNAs could serve as templates for translation as recently shown for few circRNA examples in human and fly [74,75]. Thus, we used RNase R-treated whole platelet RNA to perform in vitro translation experiments followed by highly sensitive mass spectrometry. We derived putative open reading frames (ORF) that span head-to-tail junctions of our circRNA candidates. These predictions were compared to mass-spectrometrically detected peptides. Controls were reticulocyte lysate of the in vitro translation kit, non-RNase R-treated whole platelet RNA, and total protein of the same platelet-donor. Although we detected peptides in the RNase R-treated translated sample and in the cell lysate matching circRNAs in platelets, those candidates did not overlap with head-to-tail junctions (Supplemental Table S3).Due to the lack of nuclei and the highly abundant circRNAs in platelets, we hypothesized that circRNAs could serve as templates for translation as recently shown for few circRNA examples in human and fly [74,75].

        <p>We also investigated circRNA isoforms, since we observed around 100 genes hosting more than five different circRNA isoforms. For example, we detected 18 circRNA isoforms derived either from PTPN12 or TTN in platelets, atrium, and vena cava (Supplemental Fig. S4). We compared circRNA expression directly to linear transcript expression, by counting linearly spliced and head-to-tail spliced reads. The number of reads overlapping with the head-to-tail splice junctions was divided by the number of linear splicing events with identical splice sites (Supplemental Table S2). The calculated value was plotted against the transcript copies per million transcripts (TPM) to describe circRNA expression as circular-to-linear ratio (Fig. 2e). Collectively, we detected high circular-tolinear expression ratios in tissues with abundant circRNA expression, e.g., a platelet circRNA in SMARCA5 had a circularto-linear ratio of 151:1 (Supplemental Fig. S3b).We also investigated circRNA isoforms, since we observed around 100 genes hosting more than five different circRNA isoforms.

        <p>circRNAs are differentially expressed in disease-relevant genes Finally, we demonstrate differential circRNA expression in ADA-SCID and WAS, two primary immunodeficiencies which are caused by mutations in ADA or WAS, respectively [76][77][78]. First, we compared linear transcripts from one patient compared to a non-affected control. We detected significantly differential expression (p ≤ 0.05) of 79 mRNAs in ADA-SCID and 19 mRNAs in WAS lymphoblastoid cells (LCLs) (Supplemental Table S4 and Supplemental Fig. S5a,b). The results were consistent with the molecular pathogenesis of both disease phenotypes. For example, upregulated BANK1 (p = 2.30 × 10 -3 , log2-fold change (lfc) = 3.8) or PBXIP1 (p = 3.53 × 10 -2 , lfc = 2.4) mRNAs in ADA-SCID were associated with impaired B cell receptor-induced calcium mobilization or early blocking of B cell development in the bone marrow (Supplemental Table S4) [79,80].circRNAs are differentially expressed in disease-relevant genes Finally, we demonstrate differential circRNA expression in ADA-SCID and WAS, two primary immunodeficiencies which are caused by mutations in ADA or WAS, respectively [76][77][78].

        <p>We next asked whether these differentially expressed linear transcripts harbor also circRNAs with differential expression between patients and controls. We found a circRNA in ROBO1, a gene upregulated in ADA-SCID (mRNA: p = 9.76 × 10 -6 , lfc = 5.3) and WAS (mRNA: p = 3.68 × 10 -4 , lfc = 8.31, Supplemental Table S4). Moreover, CDC42BPA expressed an upregulated circRNA in ADA-SCID (mRNA: p = 3.46 × 10 -3 , lfc = 4.7) and WAS (mRNA: p = 1.93 × 10 -3 , lfc = 7.4). Notably, ROBO1 and CDC42 are linked to the pathogenesis of WAS. Slit-2 and Robo-1 complexes have been described to inhibit the CXCR4/CXCL12-mediated chemotaxis of T cells [81]. Moreover, ROBO1 and ROBO4 bind WAS to induce filopodia formation [82,83]. Cdc42-dependent WAS activation was also reported [84,85]. CDC42 is a major regulator of podosome formation and remodels actin during B cell signaling [86,87], whereas CDC42BPA is a downstream effector of CDC42 [88]. B cell signaling is impaired both in ADA-SCID [79,80] and WAS [89,90]. In ADA-SCID, we found a circRNA in TNFRSF11A (mRNA: p = 8.28 × 10 -3 , lfc = 3.3) TNF receptors participate in several pathways altered in ADA-SCID [14]. We first validated the circRNAs in ROBO1, CDC42BPA, and TNFRSF11A (Fig. 2f and Supplemental S6a) and tested next their differential expression in three WAS and four ADA-SCID samples, compared to four non-affected LCL samples (Fig. 2g). circRNA expression of phenotypically relevant genes was higher in the disease samples (Fig. 2g).We next asked whether these differentially expressed linear transcripts harbor also circRNAs with differential expression between patients and controls.

        <p>Collectively, we provide a circRNA catalog of human tissues relevant to various fields of clinical research. We provide evidence that circRNAs could serve as biomarkers and that circRNA expression profiles could be directly linked to clinically apparent phenotypes. We focused on detecting circRNAs in various single samples. For further analyzing the proposed circRNA candidates as suitable biomarkers, broader studies addressing tissue specificity vs. donor specificity are needed. Our data corroborate recent findings that circRNA expression is highly tissue-specific [2,16,91]. We did not find evidence that platelet circRNAs were translated; however, our result does not provide conclusive evidence that circRNAs are not translated, as it highly depends on mass-spec sensitivity. As previously suggested [60], a resistance to RNA degradation can explain the high abundance of circRNAs in platelets. In the absence of transcription, the detected circRNAs could function independently of transcriptional regulation.Collectively, we provide a circRNA catalog of human tissues relevant to various fields of clinical research.

        <p>As discussed previously [2], circRNAs uncovered in this study could contribute to regulatory networks governing coding gene expression by acting as miRNA target decoys, RNAbinding protein (RBP) sponges, scaffolding molecules, and transcriptional regulators. A circRNA function is further supported by the conserved nature of circRNA expression and the tissue-specific and regulated abundance [16]. Although we can only speculate that currently disclosed circRNAs influence the functions of their linear counterparts, these new isoforms need to be considered when investigating diseaserelevant genes. Since circRNA biogenesis can compete with pre-mRNA splicing, this opens up the possibility that the mRNA output from those, oftentimes well studied genes, is controlled by the hitherto unknown circRNA [5].As discussed previously [2], circRNAs uncovered in this study could contribute to regulatory networks governing coding gene expression by acting as miRNA target decoys, RNAbinding protein (RBP) sponges, scaffolding molecules, and transcriptional regulators.
