        <p>The anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV) are multisystem disorders involving inflammation of the small blood vessels and include granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, Churg-Strauss) (1). GPA is characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation involving the ears, nose, and upper and lower respiratory tracts, and necrotizing vasculitis affecting predominantly small-to medium-sized vessels, often including necrotizing glomerulonephritis (1).The anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV) are multisystem disorders involving inflammation of the small blood vessels and include granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, Churg-Strauss) (1).

        <p>Unlike diagnostic criteria, the purpose of classification criteria is to ensure that a homogenous population is selected for inclusion into clinical trials and other research studies of GPA. In 1990, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) published criteria for the classification of GPA (then named Wegener's granulomatosis) (2)(3)(4). The 1990 criteria were effective and widely accepted, facilitating coordinated approaches to international, randomized controlled trials (5,6). In 2011 it was proposed to change the name "Wegener's granulomatosis" to "granulomatosis with polyangiitis" with subsequent wide adoption of the new terminology (7)(8)(9). The 1994 and 2012 publications of the international Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) Nomenclature of Vasculitis clarified and standardized the nomenclature of the systemic vasculitides (10) (1). The CHCC is a nomenclature system based on expert consensus rather than a classification system (1).Unlike diagnostic criteria, the purpose of classification criteria is to ensure that a homogenous population is selected for inclusion into clinical trials and other research studies of GPA.

        <p>There are several important reasons for the development of revised classification criteria for the vasculitides, including: i) a decline in the sensitivity of the 1990 ACR Classification Criteria, particularly for AAV (11); ii) a consensus that any such criteria must now incorporate testing for ANCA; iii) increased and widespread use, since 1990, of cross-sectional diagnostic imaging tools, including magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography (12,13); and iv) the introduction and adoption of classifying patients with microscopic polyangiitis, a term not in use in the 1990 ACR Classification Criteria.There are several important reasons for the development of revised classification criteria for the vasculitides, including: i) a decline in the sensitivity of the 1990 ACR Classification Criteria, particularly for AAV (11); ii) a consensus that any such criteria must now incorporate testing for ANCA; iii) increased and widespread use, since 1990, of cross-sectional diagnostic imaging tools, including magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography (12,13); and iv) the introduction and adoption of classifying patients with microscopic polyangiitis, a term not in use in the 1990 ACR Classification Criteria.</p>
        <p>There have been methodological advances in the derivation of classification criteria, moving from the "number of criteria" rule, as used in the ACR 1990 criteria (3), towards weighted criteria with threshold scores, as demonstrated in the 2010 Classification Criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (14). Weighted criteria improve measurement properties of classification criteria because certain items within a criteria list may be more discriminative. The previous 1990 criteria for vasculitis collected retrospective data from patient files, without specification between items relevant at time of diagnosis compared to those important later in the disease process. Criteria based on prospectively-collected data sets of newly-diagnosed patients should have higher face validity as inclusion criteria for future clinical trials of early-stage disease. This paper outlines the development and validation of the revised ACR-EULAR-endorsed classification criteria for GPA.There have been methodological advances in the derivation of classification criteria, moving from the "number of criteria" rule, as used in the ACR 1990 criteria (3), towards weighted criteria with threshold scores, as demonstrated in the 2010 Classification Criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (14).

        <p>Briefly, an international Steering Committee comprised of clinician investigators with expertise in vasculitis, statisticians, and data managers was established to oversee the overall Diagnostic and Classification Criteria in Vasculitis (DCVAS) project (15). The Steering Committee established a five-stage plan using data-driven and consensus methodology to develop the criteria for each of the six forms of vasculitis: In sensitivity analyses, the final classification criteria were applied to an unselected population of cases and comparators from the DCVAS dataset based on the submitting-physician diagnosis.Briefly, an international Steering Committee comprised of clinician investigators with expertise in vasculitis, statisticians, and data managers was established to oversee the overall Diagnostic and Classification Criteria in Vasculitis (DCVAS) project (15).

        <p>The classification criteria for GPA were applied to 2511 patients randomly selected from the DCVAS database using the original physician-submitted diagnosis (GPA=483; comparators=2028). Using the same cut-off point of ≥5 points for the classification for GPA, there was a similar specificity of 94.6% but a lower sensitivity of 83.8%. This upheld the a priori hypothesis that specificity would remain unchanged but sensitivity would be reduced in a population with fewer clear-cut diagnoses of GPA (i.e., cases that did not pass expert review).The classification criteria for GPA were applied to 2511 patients randomly selected from the DCVAS database using the original physician-submitted diagnosis (GPA=483; comparators=2028).

        <p>When the 1990 ACR Classification Criteria for GPA were applied to the DCVAS dataset, the criteria performed poorly due to low sensitivity (69.3%), and moderate specificity (75.8%), with an AUC of 0.73 (95%CI 0.70-0.75).When the 1990 ACR Classification Criteria for GPA were applied to the DCVAS dataset, the criteria performed poorly due to low sensitivity (69.3%), and moderate specificity (75.8%), with an AUC of 0.73 (95%CI 0.70-0.75).</p>
        <p>Presented here are the final 2020 ACR-EULAR GPA Classification Criteria. A five-stage approach has been used, underpinned by data from the multinational prospective DCVAS study and informed by expert review and consensus at each stage. The comparator group for developing and validating the criteria were other forms of AAV and other small-and medium-vessel vasculitides, the clinical entities where discrimination from GPA is difficult, but important. The new criteria for GPA have excellent sensitivity and specificity and incorporate ANCA testing and modern imaging techniques. The criteria were designed to have face and content validity for use in clinical trials and other research studies.Presented here are the final 2020 ACR-EULAR GPA Classification Criteria.

        <p>These criteria are validated and intended for the purpose of classification of vasculitis and are not appropriate for using in establishing a diagnosis of vasculitis.

        <p>Therefore, the criteria should only be applied when a diagnosis of small-or medium-vasculitis has been made and all potential "vasculitis mimics" have been excluded. The exclusion of mimics is a key aspect of many classification criteria including those for Sjögren's syndrome (16) and rheumatoid arthritis (14). The 1990 ACR Classification Criteria for vasculitis perform poorly when used for diagnosis (i.e., when used to differentiate between cases of vasculitis versus mimics without vasculitis) (17) and it is expected that the 2020 criteria would also perform poorly if used inappropriately as diagnostic criteria in people whom alternative diagnoses, such as infection or other non-vasculitis inflammatory diseases, are still being considered. The relatively low weighting assigned to glomerulonephritis in these classification criteria highlight the distinction between classification and diagnostic criteria. While detection of kidney disease is important to diagnose GPA, glomerulonephritis is common among patients with either GPA or MPA and thus does not function as a strong classifier between these conditions.Therefore, the criteria should only be applied when a diagnosis of small-or medium-vasculitis has been made and all potential "vasculitis mimics" have been excluded.

        <p>These criteria differ from the previous 1990 ACR Criteria in that they have been developed using cases presenting prospectively at the start of their disease process. This approach is different from the methods used to generate the 1990 ACR Criteria in which prevalent case records were utilized, potentially including items related to irreversible damage accrued over time. Inclusion of newly-diagnosed cases in these criteria should improve their accuracy within the context of early intervention trials as well as refractory disease. The comparators used for these new criteria are also more appropriate and closer mimics of GPA; for example, comparators with predominantly small-vessel vasculitis rather than predominantly GCA were included. The new criteria perform better than previous criteria within this dataset (11). ANCA is a major discriminator within these criteria, although patients can be classified as GPA without having a positive test for ANCA if they have a sufficient number of other features. These new criteria were validated in an independent dataset and are weighted with threshold scores (14,16) to maximize predictive ability.These criteria differ from the previous 1990 ACR Criteria in that they have been developed using cases presenting prospectively at the start of their disease process.

        <p>There are some study limitations to consider. Although this was the largest, international study every conducted in vasculitis, most patients were recruited from Europe, Asia, and North America. The performance characteristics of the criteria should be further tested in African and South American populations, which may have different clinical presentations of vasculitis. The scope of the criteria is intentionally narrow and apply only to patients who have been diagnosed with vasculitis. Diagnostic criteria are not specified. The criteria are intended to identify homogenous populations of disease and, therefore, may not be appropriate for studies focused on the full spectrum of clinical heterogeneity in these conditions. To maximize relevance and face validity of the new criteria, study sites and expert reviewers were recruited from a broad range of countries and different medical specialties. Nonetheless, the majority of patients were recruited from academic rheumatology or nephrology units which could have introduced referral bias.There are some study limitations to consider.

        <p>A key strength of this study is the use of an independent expert review process to confirm cases of GPA and comparators to avoid the circularity of using pre-defined criteria to define the gold standard. Approximately a quarter of cases were excluded via this process either due to lack of consensus on exact diagnosis, or insufficient data available to make the diagnosis. A limitation of this approach, however, could be the exclusion of true, but less clear-cut cases submitted by the original physicians. It is important that cases are classified accurately for inclusion in clinical trials; therefore, some loss of sensitivity may be appropriate. Importantly, this study also demonstrated that applying the new criteria for GPA to the whole unselected DCVAS dataset resulted in a reduction in sensitivity while maintaining specificity. Thus, the criteria should also be useful in a more generalized, "real-world" population.A key strength of this study is the use of an independent expert review process to confirm cases of GPA and comparators to avoid the circularity of using pre-defined criteria to define the gold standard.

        <p>Following a data-driven and expert consensus process, 91 items from the DCVAS CRF were retained for regression analysis including 45 clinical (14 composite), 18 laboratory (2 composite), 12 imaging (all composite) and 16 biopsy (1 composite) items. Some clinical items were removed in favor of similar but more specific pathophysiological descriptors. Supplementary Materials 6 lists the final candidate items used for the derivation of the classification criteria for GPA, MPA and EGPA.Following a data-driven and expert consensus process, 91 items from the DCVAS CRF were retained for regression analysis including 45 clinical (14 composite), 18 laboratory (2 composite), 12 imaging (all composite) and 16 biopsy (1 composite) items.

        <p>Fifty-five independent experts reviewed vignettes derived from the CRFs of 2871 cases submitted with a diagnosis of either small-vessel vasculitis (90% of CRFs), another type of vasculitis, or a mimic of vasculitis (10% of CRFs). The characteristics of the expert reviewers are shown in Supplementary Materials 7. Results of the expert review process is shown in Supplementary Materials 8. A total of 2072 (72%) cases passed the process and were designated as cases of vasculitis; these cases were used for the Stage Five analyses. After expert review, 724/843 cases retained a reference diagnosis of GPA. There were 813 comparators randomly selected for analysis.
