        <p>Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians (Fortnum et al. 2001;Morton and Nance 2006). Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries, a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e., not associated with other phenotypes (Marazita et al. 1993). Non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) mimics are syndromic forms of hearing loss that present as NSHL early in life with syndromic features developing later. Type 1 Usher syndrome, for example, is an NSHL mimic presenting as congenital profound hearing loss with delayed motor milestones. The associated progressive vision loss begins in late childhood (Smith et al. 1994).Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans.

        <p>Genetic diagnosis of NSHL and NSHL mimics is valuable. It provides prognostic information on possible progression of hearing loss, permits meaningful genetic counseling, and impacts treatment decisions (Kimberling et al. 2010). A positive diagnosis also saves healthcare dollars by directing the clinical evaluation and obviating unnecessary testing such as the routine use of imaging. The challenge, however, is in providing comprehensive genetic testing. Hearing loss is extremely heterogeneous, with over 90 genes causally implicated in NSHL (Van Camp and Smith 2015). Although Abstract Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans, affecting 1 in 500 newborns. Due to its genetic heterogeneity, comprehensive diagnostic testing has not previously been completed in a large multiethnic cohort. To determine the aggregate contribution inheritance makes to non-syndromic hearing loss, we performed comprehensive clinical genetic testing with targeted genomic enrichment and massively parallel sequencing on 1119 sequentially accrued patients. No patient was excluded based on phenotype, inheritance or previous testing. Testing resulted in identification of the underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 patients (39 %). Pathogenic variants were found in 49 genes and included missense variants (49 %), large copy number changes (18 %), small insertions and deletions (18 %), nonsense variants (8 %), splice-site alterations (6 %), and promoter variants (&lt;1 %). The diagnostic rate varied considerably based on Hum Genet (2016) 135:441-450 1 3 historically this heterogeneity restricted genetic testing to just a few genes (Hilgert et al. 2009), the advent of targeted genomic enrichment and massively parallel sequencing (TGE + MPS) has revolutionized the clinical care of the patient with hearing loss by making comprehensive genetic testing possible (Shearer and Smith 2015).Genetic diagnosis of NSHL and NSHL mimics is valuable.

        <p>TGE + MPS have been used in several small cohorts with positive diagnostic rates that range from 10 to 83 % [reviewed in (Shearer and Smith 2015)]. This variability reflects selection bias (i.e., including only a select ethnicity or only patients with a positive family history for hearing loss), platform bias (i.e., including only a limited number of genes), and analytic bias (i.e., neglecting to consider copy number variations in the analysis) (Hoppman et al. 2013;Ji et al. 2014;Shearer et al. 2013Shearer et al. , 2014b)). Herein, we report the analysis of the largest patient cohort to date that has undergone comprehensive clinical genetic testing for hearing loss. Of the 1119 patients presenting for testing in our clinical diagnostic laboratory, we were able to diagnose a genetic cause of deafness in 440 persons (39 %). We show that the diagnostic rate reflects ethnicity and clinical phenotype, and ranges from 1 % in patients with unilateral hearing loss to 72 % in patients of Middle Eastern ethnicity. These results provide a foundation from which to make appropriate recommendations for the use of comprehensive genetic testing in the evaluation of patients with hearing loss.TGE + MPS have been used in several small cohorts with positive diagnostic rates that range from 10 to 83 % [reviewed in (Shearer and Smith 2015)].

        <p>Patients included in this study were sequentially referred to the Molecular Otolaryngology and Renal Research Laboratories (MORL) for clinical genetic testing from January 2012 to September 2014. All genetic screenings were done on a custom-designed TGE + MPS panel called Oto-SCOPE Â® (Shearer et al. 2010). Relatives of patients were not included in this analysis (each nuclear and/or extended family was represented by only the proband), but no exclusions were otherwise made based upon age, age of onset, phenotype or previous testing. All available phenotype, family history, and ethnicity data were recorded. Abnormal physical exam features were classified as described in Table S1. The Institutional Review Board of the University of Iowa approved this study, and the described research was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.Patients included in this study were sequentially referred to the Molecular Otolaryngology and Renal Research Laboratories (MORL) for clinical genetic testing from January 2012 to September 2014.

        <p>TGE + MPS were completed on DNA prepared from whole blood using a Sciclone NGS workstation (Perki-nElmer, Waltham, MA) for sample preparation. The testing platform was either OtoSCOPE Â® v4 (408 individuals) or v5 (711 individuals) which targets 66 or 89 deafness-associated genes, respectively (Table S2) using custom-designed SureDesign capture technology (Agilent 
            <rs type="creator">Technologies</rs>, Santa Clara, CA). Each platform included all known NSHL and NSHL mimic genes at the time of design (May 2011 andNovember 2012, respectively). Samples were analyzed in pools of 48 samples sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) flow cell using 100bp paired-end reads. If pre-determined quality control values were not met, the sample was rerun, as previously described (Shearer et al. 2014b).

        <p>On a patient-by-patient basis, all variants were discussed in the context of phenotypic data at a weekly interdisciplinary Hearing Group Meeting that included clinicians, scientists, geneticists, genetic counselors, and bioinformaticians. Each variant's interpretation included consideration of quality/coverage depth (QD â¥ 5), minor allele frequency (MAF) from 1000 Genomes Project Database and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Exome Sequencing Project Exome Variant Server [thresholds for recessive and dominant NSHL were &lt;0.005 (excluding GJB2 variants) and &lt;0.0005, respectively] (Shearer et al. 2014a) conservation (GERP and

In the case of positive results [variant(s) reported as 'pathogenic' or 'likely pathogenic' based on criteria defined by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and further refined by the MORL for NSHL] (Richards et al. 2015;Shearer et al. 2014a), clinical correlation and segregation analysis were recommended. Positive results were confirmed via Sanger sequencing prior to reporting. The majority of rare variants deemed unlikely to cause hearing loss and not previously reported to be pathogenic were categorized as Variants of Unknown Significance (VUSs).

Of the 711 patients analyzed on v5, 11 patients carried causative variants in genes not included in v4, thus increasing the diagnostic rate by 2 % in all patients screened with V5 and accounting for 4 % of all positive diagnoses (11 of 263 positive diagnoses). Read metrics for V4 and V5 are shown in Table S5.

Following a collaborative diagnostic meeting (Hearing Group) at which identified genetic variants in each patient were discussed in the context of the patient-specific phenotype, a genetic cause of hearing loss was identified in 440 patients (39 %) (Table S3). Several smaller studies have reported similar diagnostic rates (Shearer and Smith 2015).</p>
        <p>Our data show that a focused history and physical examination can guide the expected outcome when genetic testing is ordered. The phenotypic correlations that improve or decrease the diagnostic utility of genetic testing are intuitive and logical. For example, we found that a family history positive for hearing loss improved diagnosis (44 % for dominant or recessive family history compared to 37 % for no family history).Our data show that a focused history and physical examination can guide the expected outcome when genetic testing is ordered.

        <p>Symmetry of hearing loss also impacted diagnosis. In patients with an otherwise normal physical exam, if the hearing loss was symmetric, the diagnostic rate was 48 %. However, a genetic cause was never identified in patients with 'presumed' unilateral NSHL suggesting that this condition does not exist (Figs. 1,2). In fact, the only instance of a positive genetic diagnosis associated with unilateral hearing loss was in a patient with a family history of BOR syndrome caused by a truncating variant in EYA1, a wellrecognized phenotype-genotype association (Chang et al. 2004;Chen et al. 1995).Symmetry of hearing loss also impacted diagnosis.

        <p>Ethnicity impacted diagnostic rate. Nearly half (49 %) of the patients in this study self-identified as Caucasian and had a diagnostic rate of 38 %. In patients of Middle Eastern ethnicity, the diagnostic rate was higher (72 %), an increase that reflects the higher coefficient of inbreeding in this population (Najmabadi and Kahrizi 2014 Afican American (Pemberton and Rosenberg 2014). That the diagnostic rate was lowest in African Americans and the 'Other' group (which included patients of African, Bahaman or Native American heritage) suggests that there is a 'discovery gap' to fill in these ethnic groups (Gasmelseed et al. 2004;Shan et al. 2010). Nevertheless, in all ethnic groups, a relatively large number of less frequently implicated genes accounted for 10-15 % of diagnoses (Fig. 3), implying that across populations a similar proportion of hearing loss is due to multiple, rare, ethnicspecific variants that arise randomly and independently.Ethnicity impacted diagnostic rate.

        <p>In many of the world's populations, variants in GJB2 are the predominant cause of congenital severe-to-profound ARNSHL (Kenneson et al. 2002). In this study, they accounted for 22 % of all diagnoses and 26 % of diagnoses in the congenital severe-to-profound ARNSHL cohort. The ethnic-specific breakdown of GJB2-related hearing loss in Caucasian, Hispanic, African American, Asian, and Middle Eastern patients was 20,14,0,36 and 17 %,respectively (Fig. 3,S2). When corrected for GJB2 pre-screening, the percentages increased slightly (22, 16, 0, 45, and 17 %, respectively), which is in agreement with other reports (Bazazzadegan et al. 2012;Dai et al. 2009;Du et al. 2014;Pandya et al. 2003;Usami et al. 2012).In many of the world's populations, variants in GJB2 are the predominant cause of congenital severe-to-profound ARNSHL (Kenneson et al. 2002).

        <p>STRC causative variants accounted for 30 % of diagnoses in patients with mild-moderate hearing loss, providing the most common diagnosis among those with this degree of hearing loss. In aggregate, 16 % of diagnoses implicated STRC. It is noteworthy that the majority of causative mutations in STRC involved large CNVs (99 %), underscoring the requirement that all comprehensive genetic testing panels for hearing loss include CNV detection.STRC causative variants accounted for 30 % of diagnoses in patients with mild-moderate hearing loss, providing the most common diagnosis among those with this degree of hearing loss.

        <p>Of variants with a MAF of &lt;0.01, the largest majority were of unknown significance (VUSs, Fig. S1). In addition, however, we identified several known or likely pathogenic variants associated with ARNSHL in genes without a second causal variant. For example, 151 of the 679 patients, in whom a genetic diagnosis was not made, carried reported ARNSHL-causal variants without having a second variant in the coding sequence of that gene. This carrier rate of 22 % is roughly 8 times higher than that reported in hearing control populations and suggests that many of these patients have yet-to-be-identified non-coding mutations (Green et al. 1999).Of variants with a MAF of &lt;0.01, the largest majority were of unknown significance (VUSs, Fig. S1).

        <p>Variant annotation is a dynamic process. Interpretation of variants as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, VUS, likely benign and benign is continuously refined based on increasingly robust data. The Deafness Variation Database (deafnessvariationdatabase.org) captures this area of active study in an open-source, continuously updated, interpretational database that we maintain on all variant positions interrogated on the OtoSCOPE platform.Variant annotation is a dynamic process.

        <p>In summary, we believe that comprehensive genetic testing is a foundational diagnostic test that allows healthcare providers to make evidence-based decisions in the evaluation of hearing loss thereby providing better and more cost-effective patient care (Fig. 4, Table S8). While only 10 genes accounted for 72 % of diagnoses, 49 genes were identified as causative and 20 % of diagnoses involved at least one CNV (Table 2 andShearer et al. (2014b)), mandating comprehensive TGE + MPS and thorough data analysis. While whole exome sequencing (WES) is becoming cheaper and for many indications more practical, a focused deafness-specific panel continues to offer the advantages of better coverage of targeted regions, greater facility to detect multiple variant types (including CNVs and complicated genomic rearrangements), substantially lower costs, higher throughput, simpler bioinformatics analysis, and focused testing, obviating the need to deal with secondary/incidental findings that otherwise inevitably arise with WES.
