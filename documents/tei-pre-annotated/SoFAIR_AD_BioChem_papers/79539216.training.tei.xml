        <p>We generated a global genetic interaction network for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, constructing over 23 million double mutants, identifying ~550,000 negative and ~350,000 positive genetic interactions. This comprehensive network maps genetic interactions for essential gene pairs, highlighting essential genes as densely connected hubs. Genetic interaction profiles enabled assembly of a hierarchical model of cell function, including modules corresponding to protein complexes and pathways, biological processes, and cellular compartments. Negative interactions connected functionally related genes, mapped core bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic genes, whereas positive interactions often mapped general regulatory connections among gene pairs, rather than shared functionality. The global network illustrates how coherent sets of genetic interactions connect protein complex and pathway modules to map a functional wiring diagram of the cell.We generated a global genetic interaction network for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, constructing over 23 million double mutants, identifying ~550,000 negative and ~350,000 positive genetic interactions.

        <p>Genetic interaction networks highlight mechanistic connections between genes and their corresponding pathways (1). Genetic interactions can also determine the relationship between genotype and phenotype (2) and may contribute to the "missing heritability", or the lack of identified genetic determinants underlying a phenotypic trait, in current genome-wide association studies (3,4). To explore the general principles of genetic networks, we took a systematic approach to map genetic interactions among gene pairs in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis automates the combinatorial construction of defined mutants and enables the quantitative analysis of genetic interactions (1,5). A positive genetic interaction describes a double mutant that exhibits a fitness that is greater than expected based on the combination of the two corresponding single mutants. Conversely, a negative or synthetic lethal/sick genetic interaction is identified when a double mutant displays a fitness defect that is more extreme than expected (1). Synthetic lethal interactions are of particular interest as they can be harnessed to identify new antibiotic or cancer therapeutic targets (6,7). In this study, we both expand upon our previous analysis of genetic interactions associated with nonessential genes (1) and also characterized genetic interactions involving the majority of essential genes to generate a global yeast genetic interaction network.Genetic interaction networks highlight mechanistic connections between genes and their corresponding pathways (1).

        <p>To map genetic interactions between nonessential yeast genes (8), we generated a genome-scale library of natMX-marked deletion mutant query strains and crossed them to an array composed of the corresponding kanMX-marked deletion mutant collection (9,10). We also systematically examined genetic interactions between pairs of the well-defined set of essential genes (9). To do so, we generated temperature sensitive (TS) mutant alleles, carrying mutations that typically alter coding regions. Our essential gene mutant collection consists of 2,001 array and/or query strains harboring TS alleles corresponding to 868 unique essential genes including strains for ~140 essential genes that were not represented in previous strain collections (11,12). TS mutants were screened at a semi-permissive temperature where cells were viable but partially compromised for gene function and associated with a reduced growth rate (8). We also constructed a set of essential gene query strains carrying Decreased Abundance of mRNA (DAmP) alleles, which can lead to reduced transcript levels (13); however, only a fraction of DAmP alleles (25%) compromised gene function enough to impact cellular fitness (&gt; 5% fitness defect) and, consequently, most DAmP alleles exhibited fewer interactions compared to TS alleles of essential genes (fig. S1). Thus, TS alleles mediated the majority of the essential gene genetic interactions in our network and the analyses described exclude DAmP alleles, unless otherwise noted.To map genetic interactions between nonessential yeast genes (8), we generated a genome-scale library of natMX-marked deletion mutant query strains and crossed them to an array composed of the corresponding kanMX-marked deletion mutant collection (9,10).

        <p>We constructed three different genetic interaction maps. First, the collection of nonessential deletion mutant query strains was screened against the nonessential deletion mutant array to generate a nonessential x nonessential (NxN) network. Second, query strains carrying TS alleles of essential genes were also screened against the nonessential deletion mutant array to generate an essential x nonessential (ExN) network. Finally, both nonessential deletion mutant and TS query mutant strains were crossed to an array of TS strains of essential genes to generate an expanded ExN network and the first large-scale essential x essential (ExE) genetic network.We constructed three different genetic interaction maps.

        <p>Negative and positive genetic interactions were quantified and false negative/positive rates and data reproducibility were determined at defined confidence thresholds (1) from analysis of biological replicates and comparison of interactions for a subset of gene pairs represented on both mutant arrays (fig. S2) (8). A global genetic interaction network resulting from the combination of the NxN, ExN, and ExE networks was generated from analysis of ~23 million double mutants encompassing 5,416 different genes. In total, we identified nearly 1 million genetic interactions, corresponding to ~550,000 negative and ~350,000 positive genetic interactions, including ~120,000 novel interactions between pairs of essential genes (fig. S3). The current global network involves ~90% of all yeast genes as query and/or array mutants and is accessible from http://thecellmap.org/costanzo2016/. We note that experiments and analyses described here were from a representative subset (&gt; 80%) of the complete dataset (Files S1-S3), unless otherwise noted.Negative and positive genetic interactions were quantified and false negative/positive rates and data reproducibility were determined at defined confidence thresholds (1) from analysis of biological replicates and comparison of interactions for a subset of gene pairs represented on both mutant arrays (fig.

        <p>The genetic interaction profile of a particular gene is composed of its specific set of negative and positive genetic interactions. Genes belonging to similar biological processes tend to share common genetic interactions, and genes encoding proteins that function together within the same pathway or complex display similar genetic interaction profiles (fig. S4) (1). Thus, genetic interaction profiles provide a quantitative measurement of functional similarity, and global similarity networks created from correlated genetic interaction profiles organize genes into clusters that highlight biological processes (1). We visualized networks of genetic profile similarity (Data File S3) between essential genes (Fig. 1A, Essential Similarity Network), nonessential genes (Fig. 1B, Nonessential Similarity Network), and a global similarity network (Fig. 1C, Global Similarity Network). Nodes in the similarity networks represent genes whereas edges connect gene pairs that share similar genetic interaction profiles (8).The genetic interaction profile of a particular gene is composed of its specific set of negative and positive genetic interactions.

        <p>When evaluated at the same Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) threshold, the essential gene similarity network (Fig. 1A) was more than 25-fold more densely connected compared to the corresponding nonessential network (Fig. 1B). For example, at PCC &gt; 0.2, 3.12% of all tested gene pairs were connected in the ExE similarity network, whereas 0.12% of all tested gene pairs were connected in the NxN similarity network. Moreover, genes on the essential gene similarity network often showed a stronger functional relationship, because genes that encode members of the same essential protein complex exhibited significantly higher interaction profile similarity than gene pairs belonging to the same nonessential complex (fig. S5). By evaluating the predictive power of both essential and nonessential genetic interaction profiles (8), we found that essential gene interaction profiles provided higher accuracy gene function predictions across a diverse set of biological processes (14), and this increased accuracy was correlated with the fraction of essential genes annotated to specific bioprocesses (fig. S6; Data File S4). Nevertheless, interactions involving either essential or nonessential genes can predict function. For example, interactions involving nonessential genes were more predictive of vacuolar transport, peroxisome, and mitochondrial function, whereas interactions involving essential genes were more informative for predicting chromosome segregation, mRNA splicing, and proteolysis functions. Interestingly, functional predictions for essential genes could also be derived from interactions with nonessential genes and vice versa.

        <p>To functionally annotate the global genetic profile similarity maps (Fig. 1A-C), we applied Spatial Analysis of Functional Enrichment (SAFE), which identifies dense network regions associated with specific functional attributes (15). Implementing SAFE with 4373 biological process terms from Gene Ontology (GO) (14), we detected gene clusters in each similarity network that were enriched for unique sets of related GO terms (Fig. 1D-F; Data File S5). Gene clusters enriched for GO terms related to cell polarity, protein degradation, and rRNA processing, were specifically detected in the essential gene similarity network (Fig. 1D), whereas the nonessential gene similarity network identified clusters enriched for mitochondrial and peroxisomal functions (Fig. 1E). The global similarity network provided a more organized and functionally comprehensive view of cellular function, emphasizing the importance of mapping genetic interactions that involve both nonessential and essential genes (Fig. 1F). SAFE identified 487 significantly enriched GO bioprocess terms that mapped to 17 unique network regions and covered 1343 genes on the global network (Fig. 1F). The subsets of enriched GO bioprocess terms associated with each densely connected network region in turn revealed genes involved in core cellular functions and defined an informative subset of GO bioprocess terms associated with these functions (Data File S5).To functionally annotate the global genetic profile similarity maps (Fig. 1A-C), we applied Spatial Analysis of Functional Enrichment (SAFE), which identifies dense network regions associated with specific functional attributes (15).

        <p>The relative positioning of biological process clusters appeared to reflect shared functionality because distinct, but related processes such as DNA replication &amp; repair and Mitosis, were positioned next to each other in the global similarity network (Fig. 1F). To explore this functional organization more rigorously, we considered only those genes with at least one highly similar gene partner, resulting in a set of 515 nonessential and 421 essential array mutants (8). We then applied an unsupervised clustering approach to construct a genetic interaction-based hierarchy for this subset of genes. The base of the resultant hierarchy was composed of numerous, small clusters of genes with highly similar genetic interaction profiles, whereas the top of the hierarchy was composed of a small set of larger clusters of genes with lower profile similarity (Figs. 2A, S7; Data File S6).The relative positioning of biological process clusters appeared to reflect shared functionality because distinct, but related processes such as DNA replication &amp; repair and Mitosis, were positioned next to each other in the global similarity network (Fig. 1F).

        <p>To examine functional relationships between clusters identified at different hierarchical levels, we assessed whether distinct "sibling" clusters, resolved at one level of the hierarchy and combined together at a higher level to generate a unique and larger "parent" cluster, shared enrichment for the same annotations from a particular functional standard (8). Indeed, sibling clusters identified at a relatively high level of profile similarity (e.g. PCC &gt; 0.4), which often corresponded to distinct protein complexes, shared enrichment for the same GO biological process annotations (Data File S6). For example, five sibling clusters with distinct pathway/complex annotations, including the homologous DNA repair pathway and the ORC (Origin Recognition Complex), combined together into a single parent cluster, and all these siblings are enriched for GO biological process terms such as "DNA repair", "DNA metabolic process", and "Response to DNA damage stimulus", which reflects a general role shared by the collective gene set in the regulation of DNA synthesis and repair (Data File S6). However, sibling clusters detected at an intermediate range of profile similarity (0.2 &lt; PCC &lt; 0.4), which combined into a relatively smaller set of larger parent clusters at a lower range of profile similarity (0.05 &lt; PCC &lt; 0.2), did not share enrichment for the same GO biological process, pathways or protein complex annotations. Instead, these clusters were enriched for genes whose products function in the same cell compartment (Figs. 2A, S7; Data File S6). For example, one of the ten parent clusters formed near the top of the hierarchy was comprised of six sibling clusters, and, although each individual sibling cluster was enriched for unique GO biological process terms including "Chromosome Segregation", "Transcription from RNA Polymerase II Promoter" or "DNA Repair", none of the sibling clusters were enriched for the same GO biological process terms. Instead, all ten sibling clusters were enriched for gene products that exhibit nuclear localization patterns (Data File S6). As observed previously (16), this indicates that novel functional organization is embedded within large-scale, unbiased datasets, which may not be captured completely by functional standards, including GO as it is currently organized (14). Thus, a global genetic interaction network, created on the basis of a single fitness phenotype, quantifies functional relatedness to organize genes into modules corresponding to protein complexes and pathways, which combine to define specific biological processes which, in turn, group together into larger modules representing specific cellular compartments, thereby revealing a hierarchical model of cell function.To examine functional relationships between clusters identified at different hierarchical levels, we assessed whether distinct "sibling" clusters, resolved at one level of the hierarchy and combined together at a higher level to generate a unique and larger "parent" cluster, shared enrichment for the same annotations from a particular functional standard (8).

        <p>The functional hierarchy revealed by genetic interaction profiles can also be visualized on the global similarity network (Fig. 2B). Applying SAFE with a protein localization standard (17), we detected 14 network regions enriched for genes whose products localize to 11 different subcellular compartments (Fig. 2B, Cell Compartments; Data File S5). For example, bioprocess clusters such as DNA synthesis, Mitosis, Nuclear Transport and Transcription (Fig. 2B, Bioprocesses; Data File S5) combined into a single module encompassing genes localized to the cell nucleus (Fig. 2B, Cell Compartments). At a higher level of functional resolution, SAFE identified 28 gene clusters corresponding to 123 specific protein complexes (Fig 2B, Complexes/Pathways; Data File S5). Genetic relationships between protein complexes were also resolved in greater detail by extracting biological process-enriched clusters from the global network and visualizing them in isolation (Fig. 3; Data File S5).The functional hierarchy revealed by genetic interaction profiles can also be visualized on the global similarity network (Fig. 2B).

        <p>The ability of an organism to tolerate environmental and genetic variation may be dependent on phenotypic capacitors, a class of genes whose inactivation may increase phenotypic variation among genetically diverse individuals in a population (18). Hsp90, the canonical capacitor, is a molecular chaperone controlling numerous signaling pathways and thus is considered a multi-functional or pleiotropic gene (18). Identifying other pleiotropic genes may uncover novel capacitors and provide insight into the genetic basis of phenotypic robustness.The ability of an organism to tolerate environmental and genetic variation may be dependent on phenotypic capacitors, a class of genes whose inactivation may increase phenotypic variation among genetically diverse individuals in a population (18).

        <p>We expect that a pleiotropic gene involved in diverse functions should show a genetic interaction profile that partially overlaps with genes representative of its functional spectrum. To quantify pleiotropy, we focused on genes with a high degree of negative genetic interactions and developed a pleiotropy score that measured the functional breadth of genetic interaction profiles associated with these genes (8). Genes encoding Hsp90 (hsc82Δ hsp82-5001 TS double mutant query strain; Data File S1), IRA2, a negative regulator of RAS signaling, and RSP5, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, ranked among the most highly pleiotropic genes observed (Data File S7). Other highly pleiotropic genes (top 30% pleiotropy scores) included those with proteostasis or signaling roles, as well as select genes with roles in fundamental cellular functions, such as translation, RNA processing, vesicle trafficking, lipid metabolism, and coenzyme-A biosynthesis (Fig. 4A). Because they share genetic interactions with many functionally diverse genes, high pleiotropy genes tended not to belong to densely connected network clusters, but rather were more often positioned outside the functionally enriched clusters, scattered in the sparser regions of the global network (Fig. 4A). In contrast, high degree but low pleiotropy genes (lowest 30% pleiotropy scores), which are functionally specific, overlapped more often with densely connected regions of the global similarity network (P &lt; 10 -5 ;

        <p>The location of numerous previously uncharacterized genes either within or in close proximity to functionally enriched regions of the genetic profile similarity network allows us to predict functions for these genes (Fig. 4B) (8). Notably, while most essential genes are relatively well studied, our network uncovered a role for a previously uncharacterized essential gene, YJR141W, which we named IPA1 (Important for cleavage and PolyAdenylation), in the highly conserved process of mRNA 3'-end processing and polyadenylation. IPA1 shares many genetic interactions in common with genes encoding members of the Cleavage/Polyadenylation factor (CPF) and Cleavage Factor IA (CF IA) protein complexes (Fig. 4B,C), which along with HRP1, are essential for mRNA 3' end processing (19). We also found that Ipa1 physically interacted with CPF complex members, Mpe1 and Ysh1 (Data File S8)(8) further supporting a role for IPA1 in this process. Indeed, as shown previously for TS mutants in components of CF IA and CPF complexes (20), such as pcf11 and cft2 TS mutants, an ipa1 TS mutant was impaired for in vitro mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation (fig. S8) and showed widespread defects in mRNA processing accuracy and efficiency with a significant bias towards the use of downstream polyadenylation sites (P &lt; 2 x 10 -16 , Wilcoxon rank sum; Figs. 4D; S8) (8).The location of numerous previously uncharacterized genes either within or in close proximity to functionally enriched regions of the genetic profile similarity network allows us to predict functions for these genes (Fig. 4B) (8).

        <p>Six poorly characterized genes, MTC2, MTC4, MTC6, CSF1, DLT1, and YPR153W localized in the vicinity of the cell polarity and morphogenesis cluster on the global network (Fig. 4B) and displayed highly similar genetic interaction profiles suggesting that they work together as a novel functional module (Fig. 4E). Interestingly, all of these genes were identified as important for growth in high-pressure and cold environments (21). Thus, we called this module the MTC pathway and named YPR153w as MAY24 (genetic interaction profile similarity to MTC Annotated Yeast genes MTC2 and MTC4). MTC2, MTC4, and MTC6 mutants were previously shown to enhance the mutant phenotype associated with perturbation of CDC13, which controls the maintenance of telomere capping (22). MTC pathway genes showed strong negative interactions with protein trafficking genes, as well as aromatic amino acid biosynthesis genes, ARO1 and ARO2 (Figs. 4F,S9). Because pathway components often share phenotypes with their target genes, a genetic interaction profile that contains members of a particular pathway may also identify potential targets of the same pathway. For example, the ARO1 genetic interaction profile revealed strong negative interactions with genes involved in amino acid metabolism, the entire MTC pathway and the aromatic amino acid transporters, BAP2 and TAT1 (Figs. 4G, S9), suggesting that the MTC pathway may control amino acid metabolism or affect trafficking of Bap2 and Tat1 permeases. Indeed, mutations of MTC pathway genes resulted in Bap2 mislocalization (Figs. 4H,S9) and defective phenylalanine uptake, resembling that of strains deleted for genes encoding amino acid transporters, including BAP2, TAT1, and GAP1 (Fig. 4I) (8). Furthermore, unbiased metabolomics analysis revealed that the MTC pathway mutants exhibited elevated levels of kyurenine biosynthetic pathway metabolites, including NAD+ (Fig. 4J) (8). Previous studies showed that defects in kyurenine biosynthesis suppressed cdc13-1 TS mutants, suggesting that elevated NAD+ levels inhibit telomere capping (23). Thus, the global genetic interaction network traced novel functional connections whereby defects in MTC pathway-dependent protein trafficking alter aromatic amino acid homeostasis, which appears to modulate steady state levels of kyurenine biosynthetic pathway metabolites, linking cell polarity to telomere capping through altered NAD+ levels.Six poorly characterized genes, MTC2, MTC4, MTC6, CSF1, DLT1, and YPR153W localized in the vicinity of the cell polarity and morphogenesis cluster on the global network (Fig. 4B) and displayed highly similar genetic interaction profiles suggesting that they work together as a novel functional module (Fig. 4E).

For example, the ARO1 genetic interaction profile revealed strong negative interactions with genes involved in amino acid metabolism, the entire MTC pathway and the aromatic amino acid transporters, BAP2 and TAT1 (Figs. 4G, S9), suggesting that the MTC pathway may control amino acid metabolism or affect trafficking of Bap2 and Tat1 permeases. Indeed, mutations of MTC pathway genes resulted in Bap2 mislocalization (Figs. 4H,S9) and defective phenylalanine uptake, resembling that of strains deleted for genes encoding amino acid transporters, including BAP2, TAT1, and GAP1 (Fig. 4I) (8). Furthermore, unbiased metabolomics analysis revealed that the MTC pathway mutants exhibited elevated levels of kyurenine biosynthetic pathway metabolites, including NAD+ (Fig. 4J) (8). Previous studies showed that defects in kyurenine biosynthesis suppressed cdc13-1 TS mutants, suggesting that elevated NAD+ levels inhibit telomere capping (23). Thus, the global genetic interaction network traced novel functional connections whereby defects in MTC pathway-dependent protein trafficking alter aromatic amino acid homeostasis, which appears to modulate steady state levels of kyurenine biosynthetic pathway metabolites, linking cell polarity to telomere capping through altered NAD+ levels.</p>
        <p>Genetic interaction profiles connect a particular gene to other genes through both negative and positive interactions. Although the average gene participated in ~100 negative interactions (2% of genes tested) and ~65 positive interactions (1% of genes tested), when assessed at an intermediate confidence threshold (8), a wide range of connectivity exists in the genetic interaction network (fig. S10; Data File S9). For example, the 10% most connected genes (i.e. high interaction degree genes or hub genes) in the genetic interaction network participated in 3.5-fold more genetic interactions than the average gene. More specifically, negative interaction hubs had an average degree of 340 negative interactions and the average positive interaction hub displayed 200 positive interactions. In general, essential genes participated in ~5-fold more negative and positive interactions than nonessential genes, confirming previous estimates (Fig. 5A) (24).Genetic interaction profiles connect a particular gene to other genes through both negative and positive interactions.

        <p>As observed previously (1), fitness defects associated with both deletion alleles of nonessential genes and TS alleles of essential genes were highly correlated with the degree of genetic interaction (figs. S11-S12; Table S1; Data File S10). In the global network, genetic interaction hubs participated in numerous chemical-genetic interactions and tended to encode conserved, multifunctional, highly expressed and abundant proteins that exhibit many physical interactions (Data File S9; Table S1). Genes encoding proteins involved in specific biochemical functions, or those that contain specific functional domains, such as an SH3 (SRC Homology 3) protein-protein interaction domain, were also associated with a higher number of genetic interactions (figs. S13, S14). In the nonessential genetic interaction network (NxN), negative and positive interaction hubs were enriched for biological processes including chromatin organization, transcription and vesicle trafficking (Data File S11). In the essential genetic network (ExE), negative interaction hubs were relatively uniformly distributed across all bioprocesses, whereas positive interaction hubs were specifically enriched for proteostasisrelated bioprocesses (Data File S11).As observed previously (1), fitness defects associated with both deletion alleles of nonessential genes and TS alleles of essential genes were highly correlated with the degree of genetic interaction (figs.

        <p>Genes that exhibited relatively few genetic interactions were also associated with specific features (figs. S11-S14; Table S2; Data File S10). For example, ABC transporters, which belong to functionally redundant gene families and thus are extensively buffered, exhibited fewer genetic interactions (figs. S11-S14; Table S2). Interestingly, genes with lowest interaction degree (lowest 20%; Data File S9) were often associated with more deleterious single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), exhibited a higher dN/dS ratio, and displayed high expression variance across different genetic backgrounds and environments. This suggests that these genes are under reduced evolutionary constraints and subject to condition-specific regulation (Table S2; figs. S11-S12). Approximately 1000 genes displayed few genetic interactions and had profiles that generally displayed a relatively low level of functional information, suggesting that the rich connectivity of some genes will only be revealed under different environmental or genetic conditions. The functional, physiological and evolutionary properties associated with genetic interaction frequency should predict genetic network connectivity and candidate genes that may serve as important genetic modifiers in other organisms, including humans (25).Genes that exhibited relatively few genetic interactions were also associated with specific features (figs.

        <p>The global genetic interaction network, encompassing the majority of both nonessential and essential genes, enabled a comprehensive comparative analysis with other functional information (8). Both nonessential and essential genetic interactions were predictive of functionally related gene pairs (Figs. 5B,C,S15). In particular, negative interactions among essential genes showed a striking overlap with protein-protein interactions (Figs. 5C, S15). For example, 50% of essential gene pairs whose products physically interact also share a negative interaction, representing a ~10-fold enrichment for negative interactions among essential genes displaying protein-protein interactions. Similarly, 63% of gene pairs annotated to the same essential protein complex were connected by a negative genetic interaction, representing a ~15fold enrichment for negative interactions among co-complexed essential gene pairs. In fact, individual negative interactions were as informative as genetic interaction profile similarity for predicting membership to the same essential pathway or complex, a property that does not hold for nonessential genes (fig. S16). This observation highlights the reduced ability of a cell to tolerate multiple mutations in the same essential pathway or complex (Figs. 5C,S15).The global genetic interaction network, encompassing the majority of both nonessential and essential genes, enabled a comprehensive comparative analysis with other functional information (8).

        <p>Consistent with previous observations (1), positive genetic interactions between nonessential genes also overlapped with protein-protein interactions, albeit to a lesser extent (0.5%, 3.7-fold enrichment; Figs. 5C,S15). This reflects that simultaneous perturbation of two genes encoding members of the same nonessential protein complex often show a fitness defect resembling the corresponding single mutants. In contrast, we did not detect any overlap between essential gene positive interactions and other molecular or functional relationships, including physical interactions (Figs. 5B,C,S15). The lack of a functional signal could not be explained by differences in data quality because replicate analysis confirmed that SGA-derived positive and negative interactions showed similar levels of reproducibility (fig. S2). Furthermore, members of the same essential protein complex or different alleles of the same essential gene often showed similar positive interaction profiles (fig. S17). Thus, while negative interactions identified clear functional relationships between genes, positive interactions among essential genes represent a different type of relationship that is not captured by other large-scale datasets or functional standards.Consistent with previous observations (1), positive genetic interactions between nonessential genes also overlapped with protein-protein interactions, albeit to a lesser extent (0.5%, 3.7-fold enrichment; Figs. 5C,S15).

        <p>We further examined the functional distribution of genetic interactions, through the enrichment for negative and positive interactions within and between biological processes (Fig. 1F; Data File S6) (8). Negative genetic interactions were significantly enriched (P &lt; 0.05, hypergeometric) among genes belonging to the same biological process in both the nonessential (NxN) and essential (ExE) genetic interaction networks (Fig. 5D, on-diagonal). Negative interactions were also enriched between deletion alleles of nonessential genes in different biological processes (Fig. 5D, off-diagonal). In contrast, negative interactions between TS alleles of essential genes, despite higher abundance (Fig. 5A), were biased towards gene pairs in the same biological processes (Fig. 5D, on-diagonal) and were rarely enriched between genes involved in different biological processes (Fig. 5D, off-diagonal). Although these trends could reflect the different genetic perturbations used to interrogate nonessential and essential genes, negative interactions among essential genes highlight a core set of cellular bioprocesses and nonessential genes appear to mediate connections between these bioprocesses.We further examined the functional distribution of genetic interactions, through the enrichment for negative and positive interactions within and between biological processes (Fig. 1F; Data File S6) (8).

        <p>While nonessential genes involved in the same biological process were modestly enriched for positive interactions, we failed to observe a similar enrichment for positive interactions among functionally related essential genes (Fig. 5D, on diagonal). Instead, positive interactions tended to connect essential genes with roles in highly distinct biological processes. In particular, we observed significant enrichment for positive interactions that connected essential genes with nuclear-related functions to essential genes required for vesicle trafficdependent functions (Figs. 5D,S17).While nonessential genes involved in the same biological process were modestly enriched for positive interactions, we failed to observe a similar enrichment for positive interactions among functionally related essential genes (Fig. 5D, on diagonal).

        <p>To explore the functional distribution of genetic interactions in more detail, we examined where genetic interactions occurred within the genetic network hierarchy of gene function derived from profile similarities. Specifically, we assessed how frequently negative interactions connected a pair of genes belonging to the same cluster within the hierarchy of genetic interaction profiles (Fig. 2A), and we examined clusters corresponding to either a cellular compartment, biological process or pathway/complex (Fig. 6A) (8). The frequency of negative interactions, among genes in both the nonessential (NxN) and essential (ExE) genetic interaction networks, increased with the functional specificity of a given cluster. Accordingly, genes within a cluster enriched for specific pathways or complexes were connected by negative interactions more often than genes in the same biological process-enriched cluster, which in turn, were more frequently connected by negative interactions than genes belonging to a cluster enriched for a specific cell compartment (Fig. 6B). For example, essential genes that fall into a cluster within the set that was enriched for complexes/pathways (PCC 0.4-0.8) were connected by a negative interaction with a relatively high frequency (60-90%), but they were rarely connected by a positive interaction. In total, 43% of nonessential and 56% of essential genes pairs connected by negative interactions shared some degree of functional relatedness (Fig. 6C).To explore the functional distribution of genetic interactions in more detail, we examined where genetic interactions occurred within the genetic network hierarchy of gene function derived from profile similarities.

        <p>The magnitude of a given negative interaction was also associated with the extent of functional similarity shared between genes (Fig. 6D). For both nonessential and essential genetic interactions, stronger interactions tended to connect genes with closer functional relationships (Fig. 6D). Thus, on the basis of the strength of negative genetic interaction, we can predict if two genes share an intimate relationship and possibly function in the same pathway or complex. For example, members of the conserved ER Membrane protein Complex, including EMC1, EMC2, and EMC6, which play a role in phospholipid transfer from the ER to mitochondria to facilitate phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis (26), showed strong negative genetic interactions (genetic interaction score &lt; -0.65) with a previously uncharacterized essential gene, YNL181w, suggesting a role for this gene in lipid metabolism. Indeed, YNL181w encodes a putative oxidoreductase that localizes to the ER ( 27) and, consistent with defective membrane function, ynl181w hypomorphic mutants showed altered sensitivities to numerous bioactive compounds (fig. S18) (8). We named this gene PBR1 (Potentiates Bioactive compound Response) to highlight its role in xenobiotic sensitivity.The magnitude of a given negative interaction was also associated with the extent of functional similarity shared between genes (Fig. 6D).

        <p>Positive interactions among nonessential genes exhibited similar albeit weaker trends, where the frequency of interactions increased gradually with the functional specificity of hierarchy-derived clusters (Fig. 6B) and the magnitude of nonessential positive interactions was predictive of nonessential pathway or complex membership (Fig. 6D).

In fact, the most distantly related essential gene pairs were more frequently connected by positive interactions than gene pairs mapping to the same biological process-level clusters (Fig. 6B). The majority of positive interacting gene pairs in both the essential (ExE, 78%) and nonessential (NxN, 75%) genetic interaction networks occurred between distantly connected genes whose products appeared to function in different cell compartments (Fig. 6C).

        <p>Consistent with previous findings (1,5,28,29), we found that protein complexes exhibited highly organized patterns of genetic interactions. For example, many protein complexes tested (60/141, 43%) were enriched (P &lt; 0.01, hypergeometric) for genetic interactions among complex genes and were biased for a single type of interaction, either negative or positive, highlighting the coherent nature of genetic interactions shared among genes encoding members of the same complex.

        <p>The genetic interactions occurring within protein complexes can even resolve the structural organization of large, multi-subunit complexes. For example, while proteasome genes tend to be connected by negative genetic interactions, genes encoding components of the same subunit (e.g. within 19S or within 20S) interact more frequently with one another than genes belonging to different subunits (between 19S and 20S; fig. S19). Phenotypic differences between proteasome subunits were also supported by chemical-genetic interactions observed in yeast (fig.

        <p>Extracting all genetic interactions for specific protein complexes generated functional wiring diagrams revealing the set of genes, pathways, and bioprocesses modulated by mutation of a particular complex (Fig. 8A,B). For example, coherent sets of negative interactions involving the ORC, which specifies sites of initiation of DNA replication throughout the genome (31), linked functionally related complexes, including the MCM (Mini-Chromosome Maintenance) and the GINS (Go, Ichi, Ni, San) complexes (Fig. 8A), both of which participate in the initiation of DNA replication (32,33). In another example, negative interactions associated with the 19S proteasome highlighted diverse functions that are particularly important when proteasome activity is compromised (Fig. 8B), including interactions with genes encoding the APC (Anaphase Promoting Complex), which targets cell cycle proteins for degradation to promote exit from mitosis (34). Interestingly, essential genes that showed negative interactions with the proteasome were enriched for multidomain proteins, suggesting that TS alleles may perturb folding of more complex proteins resulting in a greater dependence on proteasome activity in mutants (fig.

        <p>Protein complexes involved in proteostasis, including several chaperones and the proteasome, exhibited among the strongest enrichment for positive genetic interactions, especially in the essential gene network (Figs. 8C, S22; Data File S15). Positive genetic interactions connected the proteasome and other proteostasis-related complexes to genes involved in various functions, including vesicle trafficking and transcription (Figs. 5D, 8B, S23). Because the proteasome plays a direct role in controlling protein turnover, we hypothesized that a subset of its positive interactions may reflect genetic suppression through the stabilization of a mutant protein (35). Indeed, we further tested a subset of these positive interactions (8) and, based on this analysis, we estimated that ~30% of proteasome positive interactions represent genetic suppression, where a fitness defect associated with a hypomorphic TS allele of an essential gene is suppressed by a second mutation in a proteasome encoding gene (Table S3; fig. S24; Data File S16). In total, 16% of positive interactions with essential genes appear to be associated with proteostasis. In a similar regulatory relationship, positive interactions were also enriched between genes involved in mRNA decay and essential gene DAmP alleles (13), which affect mRNA stability via disruption of their 3' UTR (fig.

        <p>Interestingly, a subset of protein complexes, in addition to being enriched for positive interactions (Fig. 8C), also exhibited more positive interactions compared to negative interactions with essential genes (Fig. 8D; Data File S15). The positive interactions of these biased complexes, were also more functionally diverse compared to their negative interactions. For example, ORC subunits were connected by coherent sets of positive interactions to genes with roles in several different functions including members of the ER-associated Translocon complex (Fig. 8A). The ORC-Translocon connection reflects enrichment for cross-compartment positive interactions observed between genes encoding essential, nuclear and vesicle trafficdependent functions (Fig. 5D).Interestingly, a subset of protein complexes, in addition to being enriched for positive interactions (Fig. 8C), also exhibited more positive interactions compared to negative interactions with essential genes (Fig. 8D; Data File S15).

        <p>Protein complexes with a positive interaction bias tend to be involved in cell cycle progression and their disruption often leads to a cell cycle delay or arrest phenotype (Figs. 8D, S22). A cell cycle delay may result when a mutation activates a checkpoint pathway which slows cell cycle progression, allowing the cell to correct an otherwise rate-limiting defect to mask the phenotypic effect normally associated with a second mutation (36). Thus, an ORC-dependent Sphase cell cycle delay may mask growth defects associated with perturbation of genes required for polarized secretion during budding, thereby resulting in positive interactions. Protein complexes biased for positive interactions with essential genes also exhibited many negative interactions with checkpoint genes (P &lt; 4x10 -56 , Fisher's exact test; fig. S22), suggesting that cell viability depends on an active checkpoint response in the absence of these complexes. Genes with cell cycle progression-related roles accounted for 30% of essential gene positive interactions, which combined with genes involved in proteostasis, explain 46% of the positive interaction among essential genes.Protein complexes with a positive interaction bias tend to be involved in cell cycle progression and their disruption often leads to a cell cycle delay or arrest phenotype (Figs. 8D, S22). A cell cycle delay may result when a mutation activates a checkpoint pathway which slows cell cycle progression, allowing the cell to correct an otherwise rate-limiting defect to mask the phenotypic effect normally associated with a second mutation (36).

        <p>Our comprehensive analysis of genetic interactions among essential genes revealed several interesting principles. First, consistent with the results of our previous smaller scale surveys (1,24), essential genes are major hubs and form the basic scaffold of the global genetic interaction network. Second, the extreme negative or synthetic lethal interactions among essential genes often occur between genes within the same protein complex, or between genes in different protein complexes but within the same biological process or subcellular compartment, properties that may prove useful for predicting genetic interactions in other systems. Third, positive genetic interactions between two essential genes typically do not reflect shared function, but rather often occur between genes in distant cellular compartments and reflect more general regulatory connections associated with a cell cycle delay or proteostasis.Our comprehensive analysis of genetic interactions among essential genes revealed several interesting principles.

        <p>An important property associated with the global network is the potential for digenic interactions to compound the phenotypes associated with single gene mutations. While only ~1000 genes in the yeast genome are individually essential in standard growth conditions and cause lethality when mutated (9, 10), we showed that as many as ~550,000 mutant gene pair combinations result in a negative interaction in the global genetic interaction network, including an extreme set of ~10, 000 synthetic lethal interactions between nonessential gene pairs (8). In other words, we discovered a genetic background in which an additional ~3, 300 genes are essential for viability (8). Despite the power of this approach for uncovering growth dependencies, ~1000 of the 5,400 yeast genes on the global genetic interaction network showed relatively few genetic interactions and remain sparsely connected. Our global genetic network was mapped under a particular condition in a specific genetic background, and we anticipate that changing these two key factors may reveal new interactions for many of the sparsely connected genes (37). Ultimately, broad mapping of both core and condition-specific genetic interactions promises to accelerate the field of synthetic biology, providing a rational understanding of the requirements for the design of minimal genomes (38).An important property associated with the global network is the potential for digenic interactions to compound the phenotypes associated with single gene mutations.

        <p>It is also important to consider other types of genetic interactions, beyond those associated with loss-of-function mutations in haploid cells. Our analysis revealed that relatively severe deletion alleles of nonessential genes or TS alleles of essential genes often show extensive digenic interaction profiles. However, it is possible that the more subtle mutations associated with natural genetic variation may require higher order combinations, involving more than two genes, to modulate phenotype and influence heritability extensively (39). One interesting case involves duplicated genes with overlapping function, which often are buffered more extensively, such that more complex triple mutant analysis will be required to reveal their genetic interaction profiles (1,40). We must also understand the general principles associated with genetic networks involving gain-of-function alleles and more complex genetic interactions that can occur in diploid and polyploid organisms (41), across a variety of different cell types, within whole animals (42)(43)(44), or between hosts and their symbiotic organisms (45).It is also important to consider other types of genetic interactions, beyond those associated with loss-of-function mutations in haploid cells.

        <p>Because negative genetic interactions are highly ordered and often occur as coherent sets that connect genes in protein complexes and biological pathways, many different pairs of mutations may lead to same terminal synthetic lethal/sick phenotype. This network topology is important when considering the genotype to phenotype problem in human genetics. Since biological systems are built upon sets of conserved genes whose products participate in functional modules, it is reasonable to expect that the general topology of genetic networks will also be conserved (25). As observed for the complex-complex connections on the global yeast genetic network, mutations in many different pairs of genes may lead to the same phenotype, such as a disease state, in humans. This property of genetic networks means that scanning disease cohorts for genetic variation that corresponds to coherent sets of mutations that connect genes within or between protein complexes and pathways may reveal genetic networks underlying diseases.Because negative genetic interactions are highly ordered and often occur as coherent sets that connect genes in protein complexes and biological pathways, many different pairs of mutations may lead to same terminal synthetic lethal/sick phenotype.

        <p>The regulatory mechanisms associated with positive genetic interactions among essential genes, which include genetic suppression interactions, are also potentially relevant to human genetics because they may inspire novel therapeutic approaches and elucidate mechanisms of heritability (46)(47)(48). Notably, mutations that compromise the cellular proteostasis network often suppressed TS alleles of essential genes (Table S3; Data File S16). It is possible that, similar to yeast, certain variants of the human proteasome also suppress the detrimental effects of genetic variation associated with numerous other genes, and their corresponding complexes and pathways, within the human genome.The regulatory mechanisms associated with positive genetic interactions among essential genes, which include genetic suppression interactions, are also potentially relevant to human genetics because they may inspire novel therapeutic approaches and elucidate mechanisms of heritability (46)(47)(48).

        <p>It is clear that the digenic interactions we have mapped in yeast can be conserved in different yeast species over hundreds of millions of years of evolution (49,50). Likewise, conservation of genetic interactions from yeast to human cells has been observed (51,52), particularly within fundamental bioprocesses like DNA synthesis and repair and chromosome segregation (53). However, the general extent and breadth of network conservation remains largely unexplored. Importantly, genome-scale application of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing approaches offer the potential to map global genetic interaction networks in human cells (54)(55)(56). We suspect that the general principles of the global yeast genetic network described here will be highly relevant for both the efficient mapping and interpretation of analogous networks in a variety of different cells and organisms. The essential similarity network was constructed by computing Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) for genetic interaction profiles (edges) of all pairs of genes (nodes) in the essential genetic interaction matrix (ExE). Gene pairs whose profile similarity exceeded a PCC &gt; 0.2 were connected and graphed using a spring-embedded layout algorithm. Genes sharing similar genetic interactions profiles map proximal to each other, whereas genes with less similar genetic interaction profiles are positioned further apart.
