        <p>Each scan was analysed at least twice to ensure consistency, a third measurement was conducted if the LVM varied by &gt;5%. And the final measurement was taken as the average of the two closest measurements. By recording the mean LVM in each case, this process lead to improved confidence that the actual LVM values (and changes) were correct and representative of genuine change -i.e. not just measurement error. From these paired baseline measurements of LVM we calculated the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) to be 0.99 and we obtained an intra-observer test-retest root-mean-square coefficient of variation (RMS CoV) of 1.91%.Each scan was analysed at least twice to ensure consistency, a third measurement was conducted if the LVM varied by &gt;5%.

        <p>Scout images were acquired in order to localise the full structure of the abdomen in the sagittal, coronal and transverse planes, and a 3D dual-echo Dixon Volume Interpolated Breath hold Examination (Dixon VIBE) sequence was subsequently applied. The sequence was applied twice in the axial orientation covering the entire abdomen via two overlapping 3D blocks. The pulse sequence imaging parameters were TR 3.67ms, TE 1.23 and 2.46ms, flip-angle (FA) 9 o and bandwidth 1040 Hz/pixel. A total of 166-192 slices (matrix size 169x320) were acquired over a field of view of 390x480 mm, and each slice was 3mm thick.Scout images were acquired in order to localise the full structure of the abdomen in the sagittal, coronal and transverse planes, and a 3D dual-echo Dixon Volume Interpolated Breath hold Examination (Dixon VIBE) sequence was subsequently applied.

        <p>Following the acquisition, the 'fat-only' images were visually inspected and any overlapping slices between the two 3D datasets were removed. The remaining images were then combined to form a single dataset using 
            <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> (
            <rs type="creator">U. S. National Institutes of Health</rs>, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) and the resulting file was exported for analysis using 
            <rs type="software">Analyze</rs> (Version 
            <rs type="version">12.0</rs>, 
            <rs type="creator">Mayo Clinic</rs>, Rochester, MN). The analysis was performed by another blinded observer. This was done in three steps, namely (i) application of baseline regions of interest (ROI) to define sub-cutaneous adipose tissue structures (SCAT) and visceral adipose tissue structures (VAT) using a manually chosen signal-intensity threshold; (ii) selection of anterior and posterior segmentation boundaries -ranging from the top of the diaphragm to the tip of the femoral heads; and (iii) manual removal of 'non-abdomen' structures (such as the arms) together with other non-visceral structures such as bone marrow, renal cortex and similar soft-tissues. Care was taken to ensure that the slice ranges were as consistent as possible for the baseline and final datasets. Our chosen rule was to ensure that on a perpatient basis the slice ranges at each of the time-points were consistent to within 3 slices (9mm).

        <p> In n=7 of the largest participants, it was not possible to include the entire SCAT volume within the 480mm FOV. In n=2 of these cases the omitted SCAT regions were deemed large enough to render the volumes as potentially unreliable. In the remaining n=5 cases, the omitted SCAT regions were extremely small (estimated to be &lt;5% of the total SCAT volume) and visually consistent across the two time-points. In n=7 of the largest participants, it was not possible to include the entire SCAT volume within the 480mm FOV.
