        <p>Although two-dose mRNA vaccination provides excellent protection against SARS-CoV-2, there is little information about vaccine efficacy against variants of concern (VOC) in individuals above eighty years of age 1 . Here we analysed immune responses following vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine 2 in elderly participants and younger healthcare workers. Serum neutralization and levels of binding IgG or IgA after the first vaccine dose were lower in older individuals, with a marked drop in participants over eighty years old. Sera from participants above eighty showed lower neutralization potency against the B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta) and P.1. (Gamma) VOC than against the wild-type virus and were more likely to lack any neutralization against VOC following the first dose. However, following the second dose, neutralization against VOC was detectable regardless of age. The frequency of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific memory B cells was higher in elderly responders (whose serum showed neutralization activity) than in non-responders after the first dose. Elderly participants showed a clear reduction in somatic hypermutation of class-switched cells. The production of interferon-γ and interleukin-2 by SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific T cells was lower in older participants, and both cytokines were secreted primarily by CD4 T cells. We conclude that the elderly are a high-risk population and that specific measures to boost vaccine responses in this population are warranted, particularly where variants of concern are circulating.Although two-dose mRNA vaccination provides excellent protection against SARS-CoV-2, there is little information about vaccine efficacy against variants of concern (VOC) in individuals above eighty years of age 1 .

        <p>Vaccines designed to elicit protective immune responses remain the key hope for containing the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. In particular, mRNA vaccines have shown excellent efficacy when administered as two doses separated by a three-or four-week gap 2,3 . There is increasing evidence that neutralizing responses are a correlate of protection [4][5][6] . Few trial data on neutralizing responses or vaccine efficacy in individuals above the age of 80 are available 1 . This is even more pertinent for settings in which a dosing interval of 12-16 weeks or more has been implemented to maximize the administration of first doses 7 . In addition, the emergence of new variants with increased transmissibility 8 and reduced sensitivity to vaccine-elicited antibodies 9 , and for which vaccines are less able to prevent infection 10 , has raised fears for vulnerable groups in whom the magnitude and quality of immune responses may be suboptimal.Vaccines designed to elicit protective immune responses remain the key hope for containing the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2.

        <p>We studied 140 participants who had received at least one vaccination (median age 72 years (interquartile range (IQR) 44-83), 51% female; Extended Data Fig. 1). We first validated the use of a pseudotyped virus (PV) system to investigate neutralization, by comparing geometric mean titres (GMTs) between PVs expressing the Wuhan-1 D614G spike (referred to here as wild-type) and a B.1 lineage live virus isolate, using sera isolated from thirteen individuals after two vaccine doses (Extended Data Fig. 2). We observed a high correlation between the two approaches, consistent with other findings 11 , and proceeded with the PV system.We studied 140 participants who had received at least one vaccination (median age 72 years (interquartile range (IQR) 44-83), 51% female; Extended Data Fig. 1).

        <p>We explored the association between age and ability to neutralize virus by plotting the proportion of individuals whose sera produced detectable virus neutralization after the first dose at a given age. This Article the age of 80 years (Fig. 1a). Given this nonlinear change in a correlate of protection, we performed selected subsequent analyses with age both as a continuous variable and as a categorical variable. When individuals aged 80 years or more were tested between 3 and 12 weeks after their first dose, around half showed no evidence of neutralization (Extended Data Fig. 2). Geometric mean neutralization titre (GMT) was lower in participants aged 80 years or more than in younger individuals (48.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 34.6-67.1) versus 104.1 (95% CI 69.7-155.2), P = 0.004; Extended Data Table 1, Fig. 1b). GMT showed evidence of an inverse association with age (Extended Data Fig. 2). The GMT following the second dose was significantly higher in individuals for whom there had been a 12-week interval between doses compared with a 3-week interval between doses (Extended Data Fig. 2). A clinically accredited assay for N antibodies 9 showed evidence that five individuals in each group had previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Extended Data Table 1), and we adjusted for this in multivariable analyses (Extended Data Tables 2,3). Neutralizing titres for sera from vaccinated individuals were higher after the second dose than after the first dose, regardless of age (Fig. 1b). In participants who had suboptimal or no neutralization after dose 1, and who subsequently received the second dose within the study period (Fig. 1c), all but two elderly participants responded with an increase in neutralization activity (Extended Data Table 1, Fig. 1b).We explored the association between age and ability to neutralize virus by plotting the proportion of individuals whose sera produced detectable virus neutralization after the first dose at a given age.

        <p>Given our observation that participants aged 80 years or more had lower neutralization responses following the first dose than younger individuals, we hypothesized that this could lead to sub-protective neutralizing responses against the B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 VOCs, which were first identified in the UK, South Africa and Brazil, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 2). We therefore examined serum neutralization by age group against PVs bearing the wild-type spike protein or spike proteins from the three VOCs (Fig. 1d,e). There was a clear reduction in neutralizing titres against VOCs (Fig. 1d), and titres were lower for individuals over 80 years old than for younger individuals. The proportions of individuals with detectable neutralization showed a similar pattern (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Tables 2,3). Following the second dose, although there were differences in GMT for the VOCs between the age groups (Fig. 1f), nearly all participants across age groups had detectable neutralization responses across the VOCs tested (Fig. 1g).Given our observation that participants aged 80 years or more had lower neutralization responses following the first dose than younger individuals, we hypothesized that this could lead to sub-protective neutralizing responses against the B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 VOCs, which were first identified in the UK, South Africa and Brazil, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 2).

        <p>We measured binding antibody responses to the full-length wild-type (Wuhan-1) spike protein 9 . Levels of IgG and all IgG subclasses against spike protein increased between vaccine doses (Fig. 2a), and were similar after the second dose to those observed following natural infection. Like the neutralization titres, levels of IgG against spike declined with age (Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 3). IgG and its subclasses correlated with serum neutralization (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 3). The concentrations of total and subclass anti-spike IgGs were significantly lower in participants aged 80 or older than in the younger group (Fig. 2d). IgA responses also increased between the two doses and correlated with neutralization after dose 1 (Extended Data Fig. 3). In addition, phenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by flow cytometry showed that neutralization in the over-80 age group was associated with a higher proportion of spike-specific IgG + IgM -CD19 + memory B cells (Fig. 3e). Notably, the proportion of these cells did not differentiate neutralizers from non-neutralizers in the under-80 group (Fig. 3e, Extended Data Fig. 4). We performed B cell repertoire sequencing on bulk PBMCs to assess isotype and variable gene usage, somatic hypermutation and diversity of the repertoire between the two age groups and in relation to neutralization. There were no differences in isotype proportions between the two age groups (Extended Data Fig. 5), or by neutralization (Fig. 3a). We found an increase in usage of the immunoglobulin heavy variable 4 (IGHV4) family in the older age group, with an increased proportion of IGHV4.34, IGHV4.39, IGHV4.59 and IGHV4.61, whereas in the younger age group there was an increase in usage of the IGHV1 family, with increases in IGHV1.18 and IGHV1.69D (Fig. 3b). We did not find any significant differences in V gene usage associated with neutralization (Extended Data Fig. 5).We measured binding antibody responses to the full-length wild-type (Wuhan-1) spike protein 9 .

We did not find any significant differences in V gene usage associated with neutralization (Extended Data Fig. 5).</p>
        <p>Differences in somatic hypermutation could affect neutralization through antibody affinity maturation. We found that participants aged 80 years or more had a lower level of somatic hypermutation in class-switched B cell receptors (BCRs) than the younger group, and that the difference was driven by the IgA1/2 isotype (Fig. 3c). We also did not find any relationship between measures of diversity and neutralization potency or age group (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 5). We next examined the B cell repertoire for public clones known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. We explored the convergence between BCR clones in our study and the CoV-AbDab database 12 and found that participants under 80 years of age had a higher frequency of convergent clones, in keeping with increased neutralization, when compared with the older group (Fig. 3e).Differences in somatic hypermutation could affect neutralization through antibody affinity maturation.

        <p>Although it is increasingly recognized that neutralizing antibodies dominate protection against initial infection 4,13 , T cells might limit disease progression 5 when neutralizing antibody titres are low 14 . We therefore determined the T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in vaccinated individuals by stimulating PBMCs with overlapping peptide pools to the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike, using an interferon-γ (IFNγ) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) FluoroSpot assay to count spike-specific T cells. When we plotted IFNγ-spike specific T cell responses against age as a continuous variable, there was a negative correlation with a drop-off at around 80 years (Fig. 4a). A similar effect, albeit less pronounced, was seen for IL-2 (Fig. 4b). However, there did not appear to be a relationship between cytokine production by PBMCs and neutralization titre after the first dose (Extended Data Fig. 6).Although it is increasingly recognized that neutralizing antibodies dominate protection against initial infection 4,13 , T cells might limit disease progression 5 when neutralizing antibody titres are low 14 .

        <p>Following the first dose of vaccine, the frequency of IFNγ-secreting T cells against a CEF+ peptide pool that included cytomegalovirus (CMV)-, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-and influenza-specific peptides did not differ by age category and was similar to healthy SARS-CoV-2 unexposed controls (Extended Data Fig. 6). This indicates that differences in observed responses were likely to be vaccine-specific rather than resulting from generalized suboptimal T cell responses or immune paresis. However, IFNγ spike-specific T cell responses were significantly larger in immunized individuals below 80 years of age than in an unexposed population of the same age (Fig. 4c). However, in participants aged 80 years or more, the IFNγ spike-specific T cell response following the first dose did not differ from that of unexposed controls (Fig. 4c).

Notably, although spike-specific IFNγ and IL-2 responses in PBMCs after the first dose of vaccine were similar to those found after natural infection (Extended Data Fig. 6), the second dose did not appear to increase these responses, either overall (Extended Data Fig. 6) or within age categories (Fig. 4e,f). Following depletion of CD4 or CD8 T cells, the majority of IFNγ and IL-2 production was from CD4 + T cells in vaccinated individuals (Fig. 4g,h).

        <p>CMV serostatus has been associated with poorer responses to vaccination and infections 15,16 . The rate of CMV IgG positivity was higher in the older age group (Extended Data Fig. 6); unexpectedly, though, CMV-positive individuals in this group had significantly higher IFNγ, but not IL-2, responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides than CMV-negative individuals in the same age group (Extended Data Fig. 6).CMV serostatus has been associated with poorer responses to vaccination and infections 15,16 .

        <p>Finally, we investigated the possibility of interactions between senescence and mRNA vaccine responses. Autoantibodies and inflammatory cytokines or chemokines are associated with immune senescence 17 . We first measured a panel of autoantibodies in the sera of 101 participants following the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Eight participants had autoantibodies against myeloperoxidase (anti-MPO), two against fibrillarin and one against cardiolipin (Extended Data Fig. 7). As expected, all but one of the participants with anti-MPO autoantibodies were over the age of 80 years (Extended Data Fig. 7). There was a trend towards reduced anti-spike IgG levels and serum neutralization against the wild-type and B.1.17 spike proteins in participants with autoantibodies, although this did not reach statistical significance (probably owing to the small sample size; Extended Data Fig. 7). Next, we explored the association between serum cytokines or chemokines and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 PV, as well as their association with age. PIDF, a known senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) molecule, was the only molecule that was enriched in sera from participants aged over 80 years, and there was no association between any of these molecules and the ability of sera to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 PVs (Extended Data Fig. 7).Finally, we investigated the possibility of interactions between senescence and mRNA vaccine responses.

        <p>Neutralizing antibodies are a likely correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, as suggested by vaccine efficacy studies, preclinical studies in mice and non-human primates, and data from the early use of convalescent plasma in elderly patients 4,5,10,13,14,18,23 . There is a lack of data on neutralizing antibody immune responses following mRNA vaccination in the elderly, and no data, to our knowledge, on variants of concern in this group. In a clinical study that specifically looked at older adults vaccinated with BNT162b2, the GMT after the first dose was 12 in a set of 12 subjects between ages of 65 and 85 years, rising to 149 seven days after the second dose 1 . Furthermore, in a study of the Moderna 1273 mRNA vaccine in individuals above 55 years of age, neutralization was detectable only after the second dose, whereas binding antibodies were detectable after both doses 19 . In a randomized phase I study on BNT162b1 in younger (18-55 years) and older adults (65-85 years), virus neutralization was lower in the older age group 22 days after the first dose 20 . These data reflect the finding that responses to the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (AZD-1222) vaccine were lower in older than in younger mice, and the difference was overcome by booster dosing 21 .Neutralizing antibodies are a likely correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, as suggested by vaccine efficacy studies, preclinical studies in mice and non-human primates, and data from the early use of convalescent plasma in elderly patients 4,5,10,13,14,18,23 .

        <p>Here, in a cohort of 140 individuals, we have shown not only an inverse relationship between age and neutralizing responses following the first dose of BNT162b2, but also a more precipitous decline around the age of 80 years. Individuals aged 80 or more were prioritized for vaccination in the UK and elsewhere, as they represented the group at greatest risk of severe COVID-19 22 . We found that around half of those above the age of 80 have a suboptimal neutralizing antibody response after the first dose of BNT162b2, accompanied by lower T cell responses compared to younger individuals. Individuals over 80 years of age differed from the younger group in four main respects that could explain poorer neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. First, serum IgG levels were lower, accompanied by a lower proportion of peripheral spike-specific IgG + IgM -CD19 + memory B cells. Second, the elderly displayed lower somatic hypermutation in the BCR gene. Third, the elderly had lower enrichment for public BCR clonotypes that are associated with neutralization. And fourth, the older group displayed a marked reduction in IL-2-producing spike-reactive CD4 + T cells. Therefore, possible explanations for their poorer neutralizing responses include lower concentrations of antibodies (quantity) and/or lower-affinity antibodies (quality) resulting from B cell selection, reduced CD4 + T cell help, or a combination of both.

        <p>Critically, we show that elderly individuals are likely to be at greater risk from VOCs, as a greater proportion of individuals in the over-80 age group showed no neutralizing activity to P.1 and B.1.1.7 after the first dose. Reassuringly, we observed neutralizing responses across all age groups after the second dose, although further work is needed to understand the effect of age on the durability of immune responses following vaccination.Critically, we show that elderly individuals are likely to be at greater risk from VOCs, as a greater proportion of individuals in the over-80 age group showed no neutralizing activity to P.1 and B.1.1.7 after the first dose.

        <p>Community participants or healthcare workers who received their first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine between 14 December 2020 and 10 February 2021 were consecutively recruited at Addenbrooke's Hospital into the COVID-19 cohort of the NIHR Bioresource. Participants were followed up for up to 3 weeks after receiving their second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. They provided blood samples 3 to 12 weeks after their first dose and again 3 weeks after the second dose of the vaccine. Consecutive participants were eligible without exclusion. The exposure of interest was age, categorized into two exposure levels (&lt;80 and ≥80 years). The outcome of interest was inadequate vaccine-elicited serum antibody neutralization activity at least 3 weeks after the first dose. This was measured as the dilution of serum required to inhibit infection by 50% (ID50) in an in vitro neutralization assay. An ID50 of 20 or below was deemed inadequate neutralization. Binding antibody responses to the spike, receptor-binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid were measured by multiplex particle-based flow cytometry and spike-specific T cell responses were measured by IFNγ and IL-2 FluoroSpot assays. Measurement of serum autoantibodies and characterization of the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire following the first vaccine dose were exploratory outcomes.Community participants or healthcare workers who received their first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine between 14 December 2020 and 10 February 2021 were consecutively recruited at Addenbrooke's Hospital into the COVID-19 cohort of the NIHR Bioresource.

        <p>Descriptive analyses of demographic and clinical data are presented as median and IQR when continuous and as frequency and proportion (%) when categorical. Differences between continuous and categorical data were tested using Wilcoxon rank sum and Chi-square tests, respectively. Logistic regression was used to model the association between age group and neutralization by vaccine-elicited antibodies after the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. The effects of sex and time interval from vaccination to sampling as confounders were adjusted for. Linear regression was also used to explore the association between age as a continuous variable and log-transformed ID50, binding antibody levels, antibody subclass levels and T cell response after dose 1 and dose 2 of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Bonferroni adjustment was made for multiple comparisons in the linear correlation analyses between binding antibody levels, ID50, age and T cell responses. The Pearson's normally distributed correlation coefficient for linear data and Spearman's non-normally distributed correlation for nonlinear data were reported. Statistical analyses were done using

        <p>Spike pseudotype assays have been shown to have similar characteristics as neutralization testing using fully infectious wild-type SARS-CoV-2 11 . Virus neutralization assays were performed on 293T cells transiently transfected with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 using SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus expressing luciferase 24 . Pseudotyped virus was incubated with serial dilutions of heat-inactivated human serum samples or sera from vaccinated individuals in duplicate for 1 h at 37 °C. Virus and cell-only controls were also included. Then, freshly trypsinized 293T ACE2/TMPRSS2-expressing cells were added to each well. Following 48 h incubation with 5% CO 2 at 37 °C, luminescence was measured using the Steady-Glo Luciferase assay system (Promega). Neutralization was calculated relative to virus-only controls. Dilution curves were presented as a mean neutralization with s.e.m. ID50 values were calculated in

        <p>A549-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells were seeded at a cell density of 2.4 × 10 4 per well in a 96-well plate 24 h before inoculation. Serum was titrated starting at a final dilution of 1:50 with live B.1 virus PHE2 (EPI_ISL_407073) isolate being added at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. The mixture was then incubated for 1 h before being added to the cells. Seventy-two hours after infection, the plates were fixed with 8% formaldehyde and then stained with Coomassie blue for 30 min. The plates were washed and dried overnight before using a Celigo Imaging Cytometer (Nexcelom) to measure the staining intensity.

        <p>Logistic regression was used to model the association between age group and neutralisation by vaccine-elicited antibodies after the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. The effect of sex and time interval from vaccination to sampling as confounders were adjusted for. Linear regression was also used to explore the association between age as a continuous variable and log transformed ID50, binding antibody levels, antibody subclass levels and T cell response after dose 1 and dose 2 of the BNT162b2 vaccine.Logistic regression was used to model the association between age group and neutralisation by vaccine-elicited antibodies after the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine.
