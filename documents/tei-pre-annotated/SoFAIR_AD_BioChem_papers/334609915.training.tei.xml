        <p>Microbial taxa within complex ecological networks can be classified by their universal roles based on their level of connectivity with other taxa. Highly connected taxa within an ecological network (kinless hubs) are theoretically expected to support higher levels of ecosystem functions than less connected taxa (peripherals). Empirical evidence of the role of kinless hubs in regulating the functional potential of soil microbial communities, however, is largely unexplored and poorly understood in agricultural ecosystems. Here, we built a correlation network of fungal and bacterial taxa using a large-scale survey consisting of 243 soil samples across functionally and economically important agricultural ecosystems (wheat and maize); and found that the relative abundance of taxa classified as kinless hubs within the ecological network are positively and significantly correlated with the abundance of functional genes including genes for C fixation, C degradation, C methanol, N cycling, P cycling and S cycling. Structural equation modeling of multiple soil properties further indicated that kinless hubs, but not provincial, connector or peripheral taxa, had direct significant and positive relationships with the abundance of multiple functional genes. Our findings provide novel evidence that the relative abundance of soil taxa classified as kinless hubs within microbial networks are associated with high functional potential, with implications for understanding and managing (through manipulating microbial key species) agricultural ecosystems at a large spatial scale.Microbial taxa within complex ecological networks can be classified by their universal roles based on their level of connectivity with other taxa.

        <p>Soil microbial taxa live together within ecological networks, forming ecological clusters of taxa strongly co-occurring with each other (Toju et al., 2018a). Taxa within these ecological clusters are important ecological units that share environmental preferences (e.g. Faust et al., 2015) but may differ with other taxa in their level of connectivity within and across ecological clusters. To put it simply, some taxa are highly connected within an ecological cluster (provincial hubs) or within and between ecological clusters (kinless hubs). Other taxa, however, support a much lower number of connections within the network (e.g. peripheral and connector nodes (Guimera and Amaral, 2005;Poudel et al., 2016). Kinless hubs, unlike other nodes, strongly support the structure of ecological networks (Faust et al., 2015;Shade and Handelsman, 2012;Toju et al., 2018b), and are expected to create niche for other taxa (Toju et al., 2018a). The importance of ecological networks for investigating the role of microbial communities have been recently highlighted in natural ecosystems (Wagg et al., 2019;Delgado-Baquerizo et al., 2020), however, very little is known about whether ecological networks can also provide useful information to maintain ecosystem functions in agricultural environments. This knowledge is essential to increase plant production to support a continuously growing human population worldwide.Soil microbial taxa live together within ecological networks, forming ecological clusters of taxa strongly co-occurring with each other (Toju et al., 2018a).

        <p>The importance of the relative abundance of kinless hubs for https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105869 Received 12 February 2020; Received in revised form 22 April 2020; Accepted 16 May 2020 ecosystem functioning has been reported for plant communities (Rey et al., 2016;Soliveres et al., 2012;Cavieres et al., 2014). The relative abundance of microbial kinless hubs may similarly comprise a higher abundance of important functional attributes of nutrient cycling and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) fixation. These hubs have been previously defined as keystone species for plant communities, where they play important roles in the fluxes of energy and materials and provide some amount of production in terrestrial ecosystems (Toju et al., 2018b;Ellison et al., 2005;Rooney et al., 2006). Probably, these species also represent organisms with limited inherent function which rely upon functions performed by ecological clusters with which they associate (Kokou et al., 2019). Empirical evidence supporting the importance of the relative abundance of kinless hubs within microbial networks, however, is lacking. Identifying the environmental preferences and functional importance of microbial taxa in kinless hubs is essential to better understand the soil processes supported by microbial communities in terrestrial ecosystems. Similar to what has been reported for plants (Rey et al., 2016;Cavieres et al., 2014), we hypothesize that highly connected microbial taxa within and across ecological clusters (kinless hubs) might also be positively associated with abundances of functional genes involved multiple ecosystem processes including cycling of C, N, phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S). All these functions are fundamental for maintaining plant production. Because of this, we hypothesized that the abundance of kinless hubs might be of paramount importance to maintain productivity in human-managed ecosystems.The importance of the relative abundance of kinless hubs for https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105869 Received 12 February 2020; Received in revised form 22 April 2020; Accepted 16 May 2020 ecosystem functioning has been reported for plant communities (Rey et al., 2016;Soliveres et al., 2012;Cavieres et al., 2014).

        <p>To test this hypothesis, we analyzed 243 soil samples on a large scale (&gt; 1000 km) across the North China Plain, which is probably the most intensive agricultural ecosystem worldwide (Han et al., 2018). This region has been intensively managed over the last century under functionally and economically important wheat-maize double cropping rotations, accounting for &gt; 50% of the total cereal production in China (Jeong et al., 2014). Most recent studies suggest that agricultural productivity and sustainability could be largely improved by managing soil microbes (Toju et al., 2018a), because multiple soil ecological processes (e.g. nutrition cycling) critical for cropping are driven by the functional traits of soil microbes (Martiny et al., 2015). The importance of microbial taxa within ecological networks for maintaining potential functioning in these ecosystems, however, remains unclear. We performed qPCR analyses to estimate the abundances of the functional genes involved in C, N. P and S cycling and sequenced amplicons of 16Sr RNA and ITS to obtain information on the diversity and community composition of bacteria and fungi.To test this hypothesis, we analyzed 243 soil samples on a large scale (&gt; 1000 km) across the North China Plain, which is probably the most intensive agricultural ecosystem worldwide (Han et al., 2018).

        <p>We collected 243 soil samples from 27 sites from 20 November to 30 November 2014 (Fig. S1A) to survey the patterns of soil microbial communities across the North China Plain. The rotation system is winter wheat and summer corn in this region (Shi et al., 2019a,b). All the sampling soils in our studying area were identified as Ochric Aquic Cambosols (Chinese soil taxonomy). Briefly, nine plots were selected at each site (100 km 2 ), with 3.3 km between any two plots (Fig. S1B). We collected 12 cores in each plot to a depth of 15 cm, which were mixed to form one sample per plot, and all 243 samples were stored in ice boxes and immediately shipped to the laboratory. Soil DNA was extracted and soil variability was measured as described by Shi et al. (2018). The information of sampling sites and soil characteristics were also described in Tables S1 andS2 2.2. Data analysis High-throughput bacterial DNA analysis has been well described (Shi et al., 2018;Caporaso et al., 2012). Briefly, using a common primer set (515F, 5′-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3′; 806R, 5′-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3′) combined with adapter sequences and barcode sequences, the bacterial 16Sr RNA V4 hyper-variable regions were amplified (Caporaso et al., 2011). The fungal ITS1 region was amplified using a common primer set (ITS1-F: CTTGGTCATTTAG AGGAAGTAA, ITS2-R: GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC) combined with adapter and barcode sequences (Caporaso et al., 2011). Triplicates of each sample were amplified in a 50-μl reaction under the following conditions: 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 54 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 1 min with a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The triplicate PCR products for each sample were pooled for both the bacteria and fungi, purified using a QIA quick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and then quantified using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA). Equimolar ratios of PCR products were mixed in a single tube and sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq platform (Caporaso et al., 2012). A total of 243 DNA samples were analyzed by high-throughput qPCR for 71 functional genes (e.g. C, N and P cycling) on a Wafergen Smart Chip Real-Time qPCR platform as described by Wang et al. (2014) and Zhu et al. (2016). Each DNA sample was amplified by PCR in triplicate at a threshold cycle of 31 as the detection limit. The same gene was regarded as only a single unique functional gene when targeted by multiple primer sets. The relative abundances (gene copies normalized to the 16S rRNA gene) of functional genes for each sample were calculated as described by Pfaffl (2001). The high-throughput fungal data were processed and analyzed using QIIME 1.9.1, with the workflow available at http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/biocore/ qiime/blob/1.9.1/examples/ipynb/illumina_overview_tutorial.ipynb, following the method described by Caporaso et al. (2012). Each bacterial phylotype was taxonomically identified using the Ribosomal Database Project classifier (Wang et al., 2007) trained on the Greengenes 13_8 16S rRNA database (McDonald et al., 2012). Each fungal OTU was taxonomically identified using the UNITE/QIIME ITS reference OTU database (Koljalg et al., 2013). For resampling, 20 005 bacterial sequences and 11 076 fungal sequences were randomly selected to ensure that all data sets were equally sampled.We collected 243 soil samples from 27 sites from 20 November to 30 November 2014 (Fig. S1A) to survey the patterns of soil microbial communities across the North China Plain.

        <p>Co-occurrence network analyses were conducted based on a SparCC correlation matrix using the 
            <rs type="software">WGCNA</rs> package in 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> (Langfelder and Horvath, 2012). The OTU table was filtered with two constraints to improve the reliability of the network: only OTUs in &gt; 30% of all samples and only OTUs with average relative abundances &gt; 0.01% were retained. A total of 4473 bacterial OTUs and 685 fungal OTUs were thereby retained and used to construct the co-occurrence network. False discovery rates were corrected to adjust the P value of the correlation network. Before constructing the network, the reliability of the association was tested using the method described by Cougoul et al (2019). Network properties were calculated using the 
            <rs type="software">R igraph</rs> package (Csardi and Nepusz, 2006). Network images were generated using 
            <rs type="software">Gephi</rs> (
            <rs type="url">http://gephi.github.io/)</rs>. Random networks with the same numbers of nodes and edges as the empirical network were generated, and topological indices were summarized by 999 iterations based on the Erdös-Réyni model (Erdős 1960) to determine if the network properties were prone to errors. The entire network contained 1239 nodes and 37 203 edges (Table S3). Our correlation network contained eight modules (Fig. S2). The microbial community which is structured into microbial modules indicate the different groups of organisms which had distinct associations (de Menezes et al., 2015).

        <p>In our study, the calculations of z-score and c-score were according to the methods described by Guimera and Amaral (2005). Here, in order to vividly describe the role of hubs, kinless hubs (z-score &gt; 2.5; c-score &gt; 0.62), provincial hubs (z-score &gt; 2.5; c-score ≤ 0.62), connectors (z-score ≤ 2.5; c-score &gt; 0.62) and peripherals (zscore ≤ 2.5; c-score ≤ 0.62) were defined according to their withinmodule degree (z-score) and participation coefficient (c-score) threshold value (Poudel et al., 2016). The kinless hubs mean the nodes were highly connected both within and between modules, these taxa are expected to mediate interactions species within and between modules and might be very important for functioning by allowing the exchange of energy and matter within and between modules; the provincial hubs mean the nodes were highly connected within a module, these taxa are expected to mediate interactions species within modules and might be very important for functioning by allowing the exchange of energy and matter within modules; the connectors were highly connected between modules, these taxa are expected to mediate interactions species between modules and might be very important for functioning by allowing the exchange of energy and matter between modules; and the peripherals mean the node had few or no links with other nodes (Guimera and Amaral, 2005;Toju et al., 2018b).In our study, the calculations of z-score and c-score were according to the methods described by Guimera and Amaral (2005).

        <p>We conducted reduced major axis regression to determine the relationships between network hubs, soil properties and the functional genes and used a structural equation model (SEM) based on AMOS to infer the direct and indirect effects of soil variables, kinless hubs, connectors, provincial hubs and peripherals on the soil functions. Functional potential in the SEM was calculated using the average standardized abundance of all functional genes. Kinless hubs were identified using the average standardized abundance of the kinless -hub OTUs. Similarly, connector hubs, provincial hubs and peripherals were identified as above. The families with relative abundance &gt; 0.5% were chosen to perform the heat maps. Z-score ((i-m)/s, i is the abundance of an OTU in each site, m is the mean value of the abundance of the OUT across the whole sites, s is the standard deviation of the abundance of the OUT across the whole sites) was calculated for each family in order to eliminate the disequilibrium of sequences among families.

        <p>Briefly, in total 75 179 bacterial operational taxonomic units (97% similarity) were identified from 15 184 073 high-quality sequences across 243 soil samples. Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Chloroflexi were the dominant at the phyla or class level, which were accounting for &gt; 75% of total sequences. In this study, the dominant bacterial families (relative abundance &gt; 0.5%) were shown in the heatmap and Acidobacteriaceae had the highest relative abundance in LB (Fig. S3). For the bacterial community composition, it showed strong correlation with soil pH. Using Illumina next-generation sequencing technologies, we obtained 11 076 fungal quality sequences for 243 soils and identified 5 068 operational taxonomic units (97% similarity). At the phyla level, Ascomycota (~85.3%), Basidiomycota (~6.0%) and Zygomycota (~5.1%) were dominant, accounting for &gt; 96% of total sequences (Fig. S4, Table S5). According to the heatmap, Sordariaceae, Herportrichiellaceae and Microascaceae belonging to Ascomycota had the highest relative abundance in SZ, LB and ZX (Fig. S5). Using Mantel test, we found that the soil fungal community composition significantly correlated with soil pH, soil moisture, TN and TP (Table S6), with soil pH having the strongest influence on fungal community. Fungal alpha diversity indexes such as Simpson, Shannon, Chao1 and observed species, significantly decreased with increasing soil DOC, TN and AP (Table S7). From the 27 North China Plain sites that were sampled in nine plots, we detected a total of 71 different functional genes involved in Carbon (fixation, methanol, degradation), nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur cycling. The relative abundance of these genes across the site were well described in Table S4. The heatmap showed that most of the functional genes had high abundance in site LQ, YJ, MJ and DM (Fig S6 .). Using Mantel test, we found that the soil functional community significantly correlated with soil pH, TP and TK (Table S8). Most of functional genes showed significantly positive correlations with soil pH and TK and negative correlations with DTN and DON (Table S9).Briefly, in total 75 179 bacterial operational taxonomic units (97% similarity) were identified from 15 184 073 high-quality sequences across 243 soil samples.

        <p>We identified eight ecological clusters within our correlation network. Most microbial species (nodes) within our ecological network (94%) were classified as peripherals, 3% as connector hubs, 3% as provincial hubs and only 0.2% as kinless hubs (Fig. 1A). These network roles were not evenly distributed over the identified ecological clusters. All kinless (two phylotypes) hubs were in module 7 (Fig. 1B) and were classified as bacterial taxa. These two relatively rare kinless hubs accounted for 0.17% of all reads for soil bacteria. Kinless hubs included phylotypes from the classes Gemmatimonadetes and Phycisphaerae. Most connectors were in modules 6 and 8. Connector hubs included the phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Zygomycota and Ascomycota. Provincial hubs were in modules 11, 2 and 4. The community composition of each ecological cluster is shown in Fig. S7 and S8, and Table S10. The taxonomy for the provincial and connector hubs is presented in Table S11.We identified eight ecological clusters within our correlation network.

        <p>Our study provided empirical evidence that the relative abundance of taxa classified as kinless hubs within the ecological network were positively and significantly correlated with the abundance of functional genes involved in C, N, P and S cycling (Fig. 2, Table 1). The relative abundances of taxa classified as connector hubs were weakly positively correlated with the abundances of the soil functional genes (Fig. S9, Table S12). In contrast, the relative abundances of taxa classified as module hubs and peripherals were negatively correlated with the abundances of these functional genes (Fig. S10 and S11, Table S12).Our study provided empirical evidence that the relative abundance of taxa classified as kinless hubs within the ecological network were positively and significantly correlated with the abundance of functional genes involved in C, N, P and S cycling (Fig. 2, Table 1).

        <p>In order to confirm the links between the relative abundances of hubs and functional genes, we fitted structure equation models (SEM) after accounting for multiple soil variables (Table 1, Figs. S12-S15, Table S13). The SEM results confirmed the positive association between the relative abundance of kinless hubs and the abundances of multiple functional genes (β = 0.32, standardized regression weights) (Fig. 3A, Table S14), and negative association between provincial hubs, peripherals and functional genes (β = -0.27 and -0.26, standardized regression weights, respectively) (Fig. 3B andD). The relative abundance of connector hubs was weakly correlated with soil functions (β = 0.01, standardized regression weights) (Fig. 3C). The relative abundance of taxa within different network roles was associated with different soil properties. For example, pH, TP, TK, Ca and Cd positively and directly affected the kinless hubs (Fig. 3A). Soil AP and Mg strongly and positively affected the provincial hubs (Fig. 3B), and the abundance of taxa within the connector hubs was positively correlated with soil pH and Cu (Fig. 3C). Almost none of the factors positively affected the peripherals (Fig. 3D, Table S15). The soil variables had different effects on the hubs and functional genes, but pH directly affected all hubs and functional genes, e.g. positive effects on kinless and connector hubs and functional genes, and negative effects on provincial and peripheral hubs.In order to confirm the links between the relative abundances of hubs and functional genes, we fitted structure equation models (SEM) after accounting for multiple soil variables (Table 1, Figs.

        <p>Our study provides evidence that the relative abundance of taxa classified as kinless-hub microbes within ecological networks are associated with high levels of functional potential, similar to plant communities. The relative abundance of taxa classified as connector hubs was also important for maintaining multiple functional genes within the network, but the relative abundances of taxa classified as peripheral and provincial were negatively correlated with the abundance of functional genes involved in C, N, P and S cycling. These results remained valid even after accounting for multiple soil properties. Our study indicated that relatively rare but highly connected taxa within a correlation network played an important role in driving the abundance of functionally important genes. These results remained valid after considering the influence of multiple soil properties simultaneously using an SEM, i.e. locations with a high abundance of kinless taxa were positively associated with high levels of functional potential. Our results provide evidence that taxa playing different roles within the ecological network differentially influence the abundance of functional genes across environmental gradients.Our study provides evidence that the relative abundance of taxa classified as kinless-hub microbes within ecological networks are associated with high levels of functional potential, similar to plant communities.

        <p>We quantified the abundance of 71 functional genes involved in C, N, S and P cycling (Table S4) across 27 sites on the North China Plain. More than 90% of the functional genes were positively correlated with the relative abundance of two identified kinless hubs, and about 70% of these genes were positively correlated with the relative abundance of taxa classified as connector hubs (Table S16). The importance of kinless and connector hubs as regulators of functional potential may thus be associated with their topological role within the network. Kinless and connector hubs were correlated with other taxa within and between ecological clusters (C scores &gt; 0.62), suggesting that these taxa can play multiple roles in maintaining multiple ecosystem processes by promoting nutrient exchange and resource availability. Our results highlight the importance of these taxa for multiple functional genes involved in the regulation of multiple ecosystem functions, including C and N fixation, P mineralization and litter decomposition. The relative abundance of taxa classified as provincial and peripheral was negatively associated with the abundance of functional genes, unlike kinless and connector taxa, supporting the results of a long-term field-scale experiment where provincial hubs were negatively correlated with Ccycling genes (Deng et al., 2015). Provincial hubs were highly correlated with taxa within a module, and they had almost no links with other modules (Deng et al., 2015). Therefore, high abundance of them probably displayed fierce competition with members in other modules. This may be not helpful in forming the ecological networks entirely. Because the whole ecological network contains multiple modules and carry out various functions, some high abundance of phyla in a module may be harmful to the stability of ecological network. This might be the reason why we found that some high abundance of phyla in the module had negative correlation with the functional genes. Analogically, high abundance of peripherals may also influence the whole ecological network performing multifunction.We quantified the abundance of 71 functional genes involved in C, N, S and P cycling (Table S4) across 27 sites on the North China Plain.

        <p>The strong positive and significant associations between the abundance of key functional genes and the relative abundance of rare but highly connected kinless and connector hubs suggest that these species depend on its position in the microbial network and are independent of their abundance (Banerjee et al., 2018). This means they may play fundamental roles in monitoring the functioning of multiple ecosystem processes in economically important agricultural ecosystems, including wheat and maize cropping. For example, the strongest positive correlation between exoPG (pectinase), pmoA (methane/ammonia monooxygenase subunit A) and kinless hubs may indicate a strong ability to Fig. 2.

Zeng et al., found that Gemmatimonadetes contained chlorophyll-based phototrophic species (Zeng et al., 2014), suggesting a strong ability to support fundamental biological processes (Hohmann-Marriott and Blankenship, 2011). These studies support the idea that although the species are rare, they are likely to provide complementary or unique metabolic pathways to service the ecosystem (Jousset et al., 2017). In addition, taxa as keystone species might be context dependent, and they have large influence on the ecosystem under certain conditions (Jiao et al., 2017;Banerjee et al., 2018). Taxa within the Gemmatimonadetes phylum can adapt to dry conditions (Drees et al., 2006). The North China Plain is generally arid (Jeong et al., 2014), further suggesting that this taxon can be functionally important in globally dominant ecosystems, such as those in drylands (Girvan et al., 2005). For example, Gemmatimonadetes were identified as keystone species in tobacco soils in North China (Chen et al., 2019).

Moreover, Planctomycetes have often been associated with the rhizospheres of plants (Mendes et al., 2013), such as cotton (Qiao et al., 2017), wild beet (Zachow et al., 2014) and winter wheat (Mahoney et al., 2017). Rhizospheres are loci of nutrient exchange and elemental cycling (Kwak et al., 2018) and harbor millions of microbes (Xu et al., 2018) that improve nutrient cycling or suppress pathogens most likely to be recruited (Berendsen et al., 2012). Planctomycetes may therefore indirectly promote plant growth by being involved in multiple ecological processes. Future studies should aim to culture these two microbial taxa and test their potential applicability to promote ecosystem function in cropland ecosystems under controlled conditions. We also observed some significant and positive associations between the relative abundance of taxa classified as connector hubs and the absolute abundance of functional genes across soil samples. Connector taxa included both bacterial and fungal taxa, unlike kinless taxa. A connector belonging to Sordariomycetes, a class of Ascomycota, were positively correlated with most of the genes (Table S17). Sordariomycetes is prevalent in various soil habitats and has been widely reported as a decomposer of leaf litter and wood (Lutzoni et al., 2004;Spatafora and Blackwell, 1993). Another Verrucomicrobia connector was significantly positively correlated with most of the genes (Table S17, the representative sequences can be found in Table S18). The abundance of Verrucomicrobia has been positively correlated with a variety of genes associated with C cycling (Fierer et al., 2013). It's clear that the untested species in our study such as archaea (Shi et al., 2019a,b) or eukaryotic microbes (Xiong et al., 2020) could play critical role in the soil functions, and they may have keystone species in agricultural soils (Banerjee et al., 2018). In addition, the role of plant in keystone species was not considered, because only buck soils were collected in our study. Our results provide a direct link between the abundance of highly connected taxa within a microbial network and soil functional genes, suggesting that studying the abundance of these hub-related species would provide baseline information on monitoring or improving ecosystem functions in agricultural ecosystem.Heatmap of the strength of the correlations between kinless hubs, connectors, provincial hubs, peripherals and soil factors.
