        <p>The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Task Force on Nosology and Definitions proposes a framework for classification and definitions of epilepsy syndromes with onset in the neonatal period and infancy. This group includes infants from birth, whether premature or term, up to 2 years of age. The Task Force proposes definitions for well-established electroclinically defined epilepsy syndromes. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of epilepsy syndromes determined primarily by etiology. This group includes syndromes for which there is a specific etiology for the epilepsy that is associated with a clearly defined, relatively uniform, and distinct clinical phenotype in most affected individuals as well as consistent electroencephalography (EEG), neuroimaging, and/or cations following randomized controlled trials and the development of precision, gene-related therapies are two of the drivers defining the electroclinical phenotypes of syndromes with onset in infancy. The principal aim of this proposal, consistent with the 2017 ILAE Classification of the Epilepsies, is to support epilepsy diagnosis and emphasize the importance of classifying epilepsy in an individual both by syndrome and etiology. For each syndrome, we report epidemiology, clinical course, seizure types, electroencephalography (EEG), neuroimaging, genetics, and differential diagnosis. Syndromes are separated into self-limited syndromes, where there is likely to be spontaneous remission and developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, diseases where there is developmental impairment related to both the underlying etiology independent of epileptiform activity and the epileptic encephalopathy. The emerging class of etiology-specific epilepsy syndromes, where there is a specific etiology for the epilepsy that is associated with a clearly defined, relatively uniform, and distinct clinical phenotype in most affected individuals as well as consistent EEG, neuroimaging, and/or genetic correlates, is presented. The number of etiology-defined syndromes will continue to increase, and these newly described syndromes will in time be incorporated into this classification. The tables summarize mandatory features, cautionary alerts, and exclusionary features for the common syndromes. Guidance is given on the criteria for syndrome diagnosis in resource-limited regions where laboratory confirmation, including EEG, MRI, and genetic testing, might not be available.The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Task Force on Nosology and Definitions proposes a framework for classification and definitions of epilepsy syndromes with onset in the neonatal period and infancy.

        <p>A pure biological classification of the epilepsies is not possible given current levels of scientific knowledge; however, broadening the definition of epilepsy syndromes to include etiology reflects the current reality of clinical epilepsy diagnosis and management. Precision therapies for genetically determined epilepsies, which may not only attenuate or stop seizures but also address many of the associated comorbidities, are in development. The concepts presented in this proposal build on the work of many ILAE Commissions and Task Forces over several decades and further develop the 2017 ILAE Framework for Classification of the Epilepsies and the 2021 modification for seizures in the neonate, where etiology is considered at all levels of classification from seizure type, to epilepsy type, and epilepsy syndrome. 2,3 The Task Force proposes the new classification and definitions of epilepsy syndromes as a hybrid combining electroclinical features with etiology. There is a complex relationship between etiology and clinical features in individuals with epilepsy, where one etiology may relate to several different epilepsy syndromes and where one syndrome may be associated with different etiologies. More rarely, specific etiologies are associated with a unique electroclinical syndrome in most affected individuals. This requires that, in any individual with epilepsy, both the electroclinical syndrome and the etiology are considered together when developing a management plan. In resource-limited regions where such an approach is challenging due to limited access to specialized investigations, carefully defining the epilepsy syndrome can often suggest the etiology and guide optimal treatment. International collaborations through global networks and the ILAE may enhance equity of care.A pure biological classification of the epilepsies is not possible given current levels of scientific knowledge; however, broadening the definition of epilepsy syndromes to include etiology reflects the current reality of clinical epilepsy diagnosis and management.

        <p>The Proposal for Classification of Epilepsies and Epileptic Syndromes, published by the ILAE in 1985, defined an epilepsy syndrome as "an epileptic disorder characterized by a cluster of signs and symptoms, customarily occurring together". 4 The most recent Classification of the Epilepsies retained this definition, describing an epilepsy syndrome as a cluster of features incorporating typical seizure types, EEG, and imaging features that tend to occur together, often with age-dependent features such as age at onset and remission (where applicable), seizure triggers, diurnal variation, sometimes prognosis, and distinctive comorbidities such as intellectual and psychiatric dysfunction. 2 It was noted that syndromes may have etiological, prognostic, and treatment implications.The Proposal for Classification of Epilepsies and Epileptic Syndromes, published by the ILAE in 1985, defined an epilepsy syndrome as "an epileptic disorder characterized by a cluster of signs and symptoms, customarily occurring together". 4 The most recent Classification of the Epilepsies retained this definition, describing an epilepsy syndrome as a cluster of features incorporating typical seizure types, EEG, and imaging features that tend to occur together, often with age-dependent features such as age at onset and remission (where applicable), seizure triggers, diurnal variation, sometimes prognosis, and distinctive comorbidities such as intellectual and psychiatric dysfunction. 2 It was noted that syndromes may have etiological, prognostic, and treatment implications.</p>

        <p>The methodology of syndrome classification and definition by our Task Force is described in a separate paper "Methodology for classification and definition of epilepsy syndromes with list of syndromes: report of the ILAE Task Force on Nosology and Definitions." 1 The Task Force met face-to-face at ILAE meetings and had online discussions between 2018 and 2021. A working group consisting of Task Force members with expertise in pediatrics was convened. One member of the group was assigned to draft a template for each proposed syndrome, using data from a literature review through to July 2019, with the most recent edition of "Epileptic Syndromes of Infancy, Childhood and Adolescence" 27 and current criteria listed on www.epile psydi agnos is.org. The definitions presented here were based on an iterative process within the Task Force based on further input and clinical experience of Task Force members, together with additional literature searches. 1 A Delphi process incorporating two rounds of comments and involving additional expert clinicians outside the authorship group helped build consensus for any areas of disagreement.

        <p>We have divided epilepsy syndromes with onset in neonates and infants into two major groups: self-limited epilepsy syndromes, where there is likely to be spontaneous remission; and the developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), diseases where there is developmental impairment related to both the underlying etiology independent of epileptiform activity and the epileptic encephalopathy (Figure 1). Most etiology-specific syndromes that begin in the neonatal or infantile period are DEEs. Within the group of self-limited epilepsies, there are syndromes in which both de novo and inherited pathogenic variants produce broadly similar electroclinical features in familial and nonfamilial cases. We have, therefore, assigned a name for the syndrome and the inheritance as a secondary descriptor. The reasons for replacing the term "benign" in the epilepsy lexicon with "self-limited" have been described previously. 2,28 In the self-limited epilepsy syndromes beginning under 2 years of age, the seizures are typically drug responsive and the syndromes are associated with normal cognition or minor cognitive impairment.We have divided epilepsy syndromes with onset in neonates and infants into two major groups: self-limited epilepsy syndromes, where there is likely to be spontaneous remission; and the developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), diseases where there is developmental impairment related to both the underlying etiology independent of epileptiform activity and the epileptic encephalopathy (Figure 1).

        <p>The concept of the "developmental and epileptic encephalopathy" (or DEE) recognizes that in infants presenting with severe early-onset epilepsy, neurodevelopmental comorbidity may be attributable to both the underlying cause and to the adverse effects of uncontrolled epileptic activity. 2 We have divided the DEEs into Early Infantile DEE (EIDEE), with exclusive onset under 3 months of age, and other syndromes that present usually after 3 months of age or have a spectrum of age of onset that includes early and late infantile periods. We discuss the typical age of presentation for each syndrome. We have not sub-divided EIDEE into neonatal onset and later onset conditions, as presentation can occur at any time from birth to a few months of age.The concept of the "developmental and epileptic encephalopathy" (or DEE) recognizes that in infants presenting with severe early-onset epilepsy, neurodevelopmental comorbidity may be attributable to both the underlying cause and to the adverse effects of uncontrolled epileptic activity. 2 We have divided the DEEs into Early Infantile DEE (EIDEE), with exclusive onset under 3 months of age, and other syndromes that present usually after 3 months of age or have a spectrum of age of onset that includes early and late infantile periods.

        <p>Autosomal dominant inheritance patterns are seen within families (sometimes with incomplete penetrance). SeLNE may be due to de novo pathogenic variants in the same genes, KCNQ2 and KCNQ3, as self-limited familial neonatal epilepsy. The KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes code for potassium channel subunits, which come together to form a heterotetrameric potassium ion channel (the M channel). [38][39][40] A family history of SeLNE is required for self-limited familial neonatal epilepsy. There is often variability in the duration of the epilepsy in affected family members. In more than 90% of families, a pathogenic variant is identified. 30 Pathogenic variants in KCNQ2 are the most common cause of the syndrome, being present in over 80%, and include stop codons, deletions, and frameshift mutations resulting in haploinsufficiency, as well as certain missense variants that cause mild to moderate loss of channel function. 41,42 KCNQ3 and SCN2A pathogenic variants are much less frequent.Autosomal dominant inheritance patterns are seen within families (sometimes with incomplete penetrance).

        <p>Interictal: The background is abnormal and may show burst-suppression, multifocal spikes/spike waves/sharp waves with or without slowing, discontinuity and/or diffuse slowing (Figure 5). The background abnormalities may be scarce very early in the course in rare patients but will deteriorate quickly with increasing seizure frequency. The burst-suppression pattern consists of high-voltage bursts (150-300uV) of mixed spikes, and sharp and slow waves lasting 1-5 s, alternating with periods of marked suppression (&lt;5 μV) lasting 3-10 s; however, the duration might be influenced by concomitant medications. It is usually seen both in wakefulness and sleep and is unresponsive to stimulation. A burst-suppression pattern is usually bilateral but can be asymmetric, asynchronous, or even unilateral. Random focal attenuation can sometimes be seen. In some children, an abnormal EEG background pattern may be seen prior to seizures with the burstsuppression pattern becoming obvious only postictally. The burst-suppression pattern may disappear with age, but the EEG will remain abnormal. For infants who evolve to IESS, hypsarrhythmia may appear with age. If the etiology is treatable (metabolic or structural lesion amenable to surgery), the EEG may improve or even normalize.Interictal: The background is abnormal and may show burst-suppression, multifocal spikes/spike waves/sharp waves with or without slowing, discontinuity and/or diffuse slowing (Figure 5).

        <p>Ictal: The pattern depends on seizure type. In the neonatal period, ictal patterns are focal or asymmetric. With tonic seizures the burst-suppression pattern attenuates with the emergence of low-voltage, high-frequency fast activity. Myoclonus may have a spike/sharp wave correlate. Erratic/fragmented myoclonus may not have an ictal correlate. Focal seizures are associated with a focal ictal recruiting rhythm. The ictal pattern in a sequential seizure will change through the seizure as the clinical manifestations change. Epileptic spasms are accompanied by a high-voltage generalized or focal sharp or slow wave followed by low-amplitude fast activity and attenuation. Furthermore, ictal EEG patterns may be seen with or without clinical seizures.Ictal: The pattern depends on seizure type. In the neonatal period, ictal patterns are focal or asymmetric.

        <p>IESS is a term proposed to encompass both West syndrome as well as infants presenting with epileptic spasms who do not fulfil all the criteria for West syndrome (Table 7). West syndrome classically referred to the triad of epileptic spasms, hypsarrhythmia, and developmental stagnation or regression. 121 However, infants with IESS often lack one of these three criteria. For example, the developmental impact may not be apparent or typical hypsarrhythmia may not be present. This concern was previously identified by the West Delphi group, who proposed the term Infantile Spasms syndrome for all cases of infantile spasms, regardless of EEG findings, and retained the term West syndrome for cases in which hypsarrhythmia was associated, regardless of developmental regression. 122 This change emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and therapy because shorter lag time to treatment is associated with a better outcome. 123 The addition of the term "epileptic" to the name of the syndrome was done upon the request of many pediatric neurology/epilepsy experts in order to avoid any confusion with nonepileptic spasms and to emphasize the epileptic nature of this syndrome. IESS is characterized by the onset of epileptic spasms between 1 and 24 (peak 3 and 12) months of age, although later onset may occur. Infants may have no antecedent history, or the antecedent history may reflect the underlying cause, for example, acquired structural brain or genetic abnormality. In some cases, infants with EIDEE or other early onset epilepsies (usually with focal seizures) may evolve to have clinical and EEG features of IESS after 3-4 months of age. 124 Epidemiology:IESS is a term proposed to encompass both West syndrome as well as infants presenting with epileptic spasms who do not fulfil all the criteria for West syndrome (Table 7).

        <p>IESS has onset between 3 and 12 months, with a range of 1-24 months. If onset occurs prior to 3 months, other early-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathies should be considered. Prior to the onset of IESS the development can be normal, but there is often a history of preceding clear or suspected abnormal development. Developmental slowing, arrest, or regression is seen with the onset of spasms, although it may not be apparent very early in the course. Parents may report isolated regression in visual attention or altered social responsiveness in the days or weeks preceding the onset of spasms. Developmental plateauing and regression usually worsen without urgent and effective treatment. Although head size and examination may be normal, careful neurological examination may provide clues to the etiology, including abnormal head size or neurological exam findings. In addition, dermatological exam (for stigmata suggestive of a neurocutaneous disorder such as tuberous sclerosis complex), ophthalmologic assessment, and examination for dysmorphic features are important as they can suggest an underlying cause.IESS has onset between 3 and 12 months, with a range of 1-24 months.

        <p>Course of illness: IESS frequently evolves to other epilepsy types or syndromes, especially Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, or drug-resistant focal epilepsies. Although there are no precise data, it has been suggested that about 30% of patients with IESS may evolve to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. [128][129][130][131][132][133][134][135][136] Some infants may begin with focal epilepsy that evolves to IESS, and then, as the child ages or in response to therapy, revert back to focal epilepsy. In such cases, focal features are often seen on EEG and typical hypsarrhythmia may be absent. Coexisting focal seizures, asymmetric epileptic spasms, and consistent focal features on EEG should also raise the possibility of a structural brain abnormality.Course of illness: IESS frequently evolves to other epilepsy types or syndromes, especially Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, or drug-resistant focal epilepsies.

        <p>Developmentally, many infants are left with poor developmental outcome, regardless of seizure outcome. The severity of developmental delay relates predominantly to etiology and promptness of treatment. Prognosis is more favorable for infants with preceding normal development, no known cause, and prompt initiation of syndromespecific treatment. 123,125 Seizures: Epileptic spasms are mandatory for the diagnosis of IESS, and consist of brief tonic contractions of axial muscles, each typically lasting &lt;3 s, which may be flexor, extensor, or mixed. These usually occur in series or clusters, with increasing prominence of the motor features through the cluster, often over a period of minutes (although clusters may last 30 min or longer) and are often seen on awakening. These may be symmetric or asymmetric and may be subtle, with minor head nods, or eye or chin movements.Developmentally, many infants are left with poor developmental outcome, regardless of seizure outcome.

        <p>Focal seizures may also be seen and may co-occur in an infant with spasms, particularly in the setting of a structural etiology, for example, tuberous sclerosis or focal cortical dysplasia. Focal seizures may occur either independently of spasms or may precede, occur during, or follow a cluster of epileptic spasms, or even occur throughout the series of epileptic spasms. Tonic seizures at onset are atypical and should raise concern for another early onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy.Focal seizures may also be seen and may co-occur in an infant with spasms, particularly in the setting of a structural etiology, for example, tuberous sclerosis or focal cortical dysplasia.

        <p>EEG: Interictally, hypsarrhythmia (chaotic, high amplitude, excessive slowing, multifocal epileptiform discharges) is often seen and the yield of detection is greatest if non-REM (rapid eye movement) sleep is recorded (Figure 7A). Some infants may have a very active multifocal epileptiform EEG without the chaotic background that typifies hypsarrhythmia. A consistent focal epileptiform discharge or focal fast activity should suggest an underlying structural abnormality. Very early in the course, or in older children, hypsarrhythmia may also be absent. Clinicians should not withhold standard therapy for children with IESS who do not have hypsarrhythmia.EEG: Interictally, hypsarrhythmia (chaotic, high amplitude, excessive slowing, multifocal epileptiform discharges) is often seen and the yield of detection is greatest if non-REM (rapid eye movement) sleep is recorded (Figure 7A).

EMG helps to distinguish epileptic spasms from myoclonic seizures and tonic seizures (see Figure 8). 137 A burst-suppression pattern on EEG is suggestive of EIDEE.The ictal recording of an epileptic spasm is characterized by a high amplitude, generalized, sharp or slow wave followed by low amplitude, fast activity, which may appear as a brief electrodecrement (Figure 7B).

        <p>Neuroimaging:Neuroimaging:</p>
        <p>Neuroimaging is strongly recommended to clarify the etiology, which may impact treatment decision-making. Brain MRI is abnormal in one half to two thirds of children with IESS, 9,[138][139][140][141][142] and can show either acquired or congenital lesions that are focal, multifocal, or diffuse. Early imaging should be repeated after 2 years of age when myelination is likely to be complete, if there is a suspicion of a focal structural lesion, or in infants with refractory infantile spasms of unknown etiology. Optimized imaging and analysis for the detection of subtle focal cortical dysplasia may be necessary, and modalities such as fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography or arterial spin labeling can be useful to detect focal structural anomalies in the presence of an apparently normal MRI. 143,144 Such children should be referred early for epilepsy surgical assessment. In addition, MRI abnormalities may point to specific metabolic disorders.Neuroimaging is strongly recommended to clarify the etiology, which may impact treatment decision-making.

The severity of the phenotype seems to be correlated with the age of epilepsy onset. 22,201 Epidemiology: Data on incidence are limited but one study reports an estimated incidence of 1/42 000 live births. 41 Large cohorts of females with seizure clusters triggered by fever show rates of PCDH19 pathogenic variants ranging from 2% to 20%. 22 Clinical context: Seizure onset is typically before 1 year of age, with a mean age of 10 months (1.5-60 months in females). 21,202 Development and neurological examination are normal at seizure onset. Head circumference is normal.</p>
        <p>Course of illness: Seizures occur in clusters, which are triggered by fever and often drug resistant. After the first decade, a decrease in the frequency of the seizure clusters generally occurs regardless of the treatment, and remission of seizures may occur in at least one quarter, usually in adolescence to mid-adulthood. 21,22,[202][203][204] Signs of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, affecting up to 70%, emerge during the second year of life and often become the most relevant symptoms after the first decade. Behavioral disorders, with prominent hyperactivity and possible psychosis in up to 25% of women, are often problematic in adolescence and adults. 205 Seizures: At onset, seizures are focal impaired aware with tonic extension of the upper arms, deviation of head and eyes, pallor of the face, expression of fear, and screaming reported in half of the patients. 21,202 Atypical absences may also be seen. 202 Seizures occur in clusters, often related to fever, and status epilepticus has been reported. 206 EEG:Course of illness: Seizures occur in clusters, which are triggered by fever and often drug resistant.

In half of cases, seizures appear focal but are not well lateralized or localized on EEG. 21 Neuroimaging: MRI is typically normal at seizure onset.

        <p>Infants may present with many different seizure types but generalized-onset seizures are more common than focal. 211,214 In any child presenting with epilepsy and a movement disorder Glut1DS should be considered. 215 A history of seizures associated with fasting or in the early morning may be present. Other clues to diagnosis include eye-head gaze saccades (consisting of rapid, multidirectional eye movements, accompanied by head movements in the same direction) in early infancy and microcephaly (present in 50% of cases) or deceleration of head growth. 209,213,216 Diagnosis is confirmed by lumbar puncture identifying low CSF glucose with normal or low CSF lactate after a 4-6 hour fast in the context of a normal blood glucose. 217 In Glut1DS, CSF glucose fifth percentile values range from 1.8-2.9 mmol/L, and CSF/plasma glucose ratio fifth percentile values range from 0.41-0.510. In the presence of a highly typical phenotype with a pathogenic SLC2A1 variant, a lumbar puncture may not be necessary. 213 In later-onset associated with GLUT1DS, CSF glucose levels may not be as low. 218 Course of illness: Seizures vary in frequency from multiple per day to only a few per year and are resistant to antiseizure medications. Seizure frequency tends to decline later in childhood and adult life, where intellectual disability, movement disorders, and migraine may be the predominant features. 213,219 Ketogenic diet with adequate ketosis may completely control seizures. Although this therapy may ameliorate further cognitive decline, many patients are still left with variable degrees of intellectual disability.Infants may present with many different seizure types but generalized-onset seizures are more common than focal. 211,214 In any child presenting with epilepsy and a movement disorder Glut1DS should be considered. 215 A history of seizures associated with fasting or in the early morning may be present.

        <p>We propose using transparent terms that describe the clinical condition, such as IESS. By defining the syndrome by the characteristic seizure type, our aim is to enable early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Many infants do not fulfill the full triad of West syndrome, as they may lack hypsarrhythmia or regression-thus we propose the term IESS. There is electroclinical overlap between Ohtahara syndrome and Early Myoclonic Encephalopathy, with both syndromes sharing genetic and structural etiologies. In addition, many infants do not meet criteria for either syndrome, highlighting the broad spectrum of presentations within EIDEE. Thus, our Task Force merged both entities into one syndrome called EIDEE.We propose using transparent terms that describe the clinical condition, such as IESS.

        <p>We aligned our nomenclature with previous classification efforts. 2 Syndrome names that contained terminology such as severe (severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy), malignant (malignant migrating partial seizures in infancy), and benign (benign neonatal seizures) were changed to align with the most recent Classification. 2 Similarly, the term "partial seizures" was replaced by "focal seizures." To avoid any confusion between seizure types and epilepsy syndrome, we replaced the term "convulsions" with "epilepsies" in some syndromes such as Self-Limited Neonatal Epilepsy. Furthermore, because only family history differentiates between Familial and Non-familial SeLNE and SeLIE, we merged these together using the term "Selflimited (Familial) Neonatal Epilepsy" and "Self-limited (Familial) Infantile Epilepsy," which allows the term "familial" to be used where appropriate.We aligned our nomenclature with previous classification efforts. 2 Syndrome names that contained terminology such as severe (severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy), malignant (malignant migrating partial seizures in infancy), and benign (benign neonatal seizures) were changed to align with the most recent Classification. 2 Similarly, the term "partial seizures" was replaced by "focal seizures."

        <p>Finally, we introduce the concept of Etiology-Specific Syndromes for certain genetic and structural etiologies. Gene discoveries have allowed delineation of new electroclinical syndromes, such as PCDH19 Clustering Epilepsy and CDKL5-DEE. Etiology-specific syndromes inform rapid diagnosis and optimization of medical care, and they ensure readiness for precision medicine trials. Given the devastating consequences of many infantile epilepsies, prompt etiological diagnosis offers the hope that novel precision therapies will improve long-term prognosis. Progress in this area relies not only on advances in genetics, imaging, and immunology, but also requires clinicians to carefully phenotype electroclinical and developmental features and long-term outcome in children with early-life epilepsies.Finally, we introduce the concept of Etiology-Specific Syndromes for certain genetic and structural etiologies.
