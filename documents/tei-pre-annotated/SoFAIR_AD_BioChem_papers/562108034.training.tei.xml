While genomes and transcriptomes can be explored at the single-cell level, single-cell profiling of proteomes is not yet established. Here we describe new single-molecule protein sequencing and identification technologies alongside innovations in mass spectrometry that will eventually enable broad sequence coverage in single-cell profiling.

        <p>T he emergence of next-generation sequencing and single-molecule DNA sequencing technologies has revolutionized genomics and, consequently, has profoundly altered precision medicine diagnostics. Proteomics awaits similar transformative waves of protein sequencing techniques that will allow for the examination of proteins at the single-cell and ultimately single-molecule level, even with low-abundance proteins. The proteome is not a direct reflection of the transcriptome, and the way that RNA abundance relates to protein abundance varies from transcript to transcript. Further, the post-translationally modified proteome is inaccessible from the transcriptome. Therefore, whole-proteome sequencing and profiling of the vast repertoire of cell types is expected to fundamentally enhance understanding of all living systems. This necessitates analysis of the proteome with ultra-high resolution, complementing today's single-cell RNA sequencing studies.T he emergence of next-generation sequencing and single-molecule DNA sequencing technologies has revolutionized genomics and, consequently, has profoundly altered precision medicine diagnostics.

        <p>DNA sequencing technologies are routinely used for whole-genome and whole-transcriptome profiling with extensive read depths and high sequence coverage. In the absence of an amplification method similar to those available with DNA, conventional bottom-up mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics assays fall short of providing the same breadth of view for proteins (Box 1). Analysis of complex protein mixtures is particularly challenging because the more than 20,000 genes in the human genome 1 are translated into a diversity of proteoforms that may include millions of variants as a result of post-translational modifications, alternative splicing and germline variants 2 . In cancer, for example, the proteoform landscape can be aberrant with many new protein variants resulting from non-canonical splicing, mutations, fusions and post-translational modifications. Characterization of such proteoforms is likely to benefit from improvements in current protein sequencing techniques and the emergence of new methods.DNA sequencing technologies are routinely used for whole-genome and whole-transcriptome profiling with extensive read depths and high sequence coverage.

        <p>Massively parallel Edman degradation. Edman degradation 7 was the first method to determine the amino acid sequence of a purified peptide. The method entails chemical modification of the N-terminal amino acid, cleavage of this amino acid from the peptide and determination of the identity of the cleaved labeled amino acid using high-performance liquid chromatography. Until recently, conducting sequencing of this sort in a massively parallel fashion was not feasible because the method requires highly purified peptides. However, recent multiplex strategies that use peptide arrays and either sequence chemically labeled peptides ('fluorosequencing') or successively detect the N-terminal amino acid are making breakthroughs.Massively parallel Edman degradation.

        <p>The last decade saw the maturation of MS use in global proteomics. The typical proteomics workflow is 'bottom-up' in nature and involves digesting a protein sample using a protease and characterizing the resulting peptides by MS 114 . Two types of measurements are typically made in succession: (1) MS 1 spectra survey the masses of a set of peptides present in the mass spectrometer at a given moment and (2) MS 2 spectra probe the structures of peptide ion species identified in the MS 1 survey by isolating, fragmenting and measuring the fragment masses of one or a few of them. Peptides identified from the MS 2 spectra are then mapped back to proteins to infer overall protein abundance.The last decade saw the maturation of MS use in global proteomics.

        <p>Current mass spectrometers have drawbacks in terms of their dynamic range, the read length (peptide length) of 'sequenced' peptides and biases in detectability arising from the ionization mechanism, transmission and the mass analyzer used. Consequently, although 'top-down' proteomics methods capable of analyzing intact proteins exist 115 , most state-of-the-art proteomics approaches characterize the proteome with high numbers of proteins but on average characterize proteins with low sequence coverage and low sequencing depth. Different sample preparation strategies, instruments and elution profiles can improve the numbers and average sequence coverage of the proteins identified in an experiment. Summarizing the best single-sample run from 47 experiments (a summary of over 1,000 distinct samples) in ProteomicsDB 116 revealed that, even with complex sample preparation, the mean sequence coverage (the average percentage of amino acids covered in an identified protein) for a single sample reaches just 33%. The resulting challenge in proteoform inference is demonstrated in studies evaluating the sensitivity of detection for various cancer aberrations in proteomics datasets. For example, in a study of over 30 sample process replicates, only about 10% of germline and somatic single-nucleotide variants detected at both the DNA and RNA level were detectable as peptides, and an even smaller proportion of peptides corresponding to novel splice junctions were detected that had been observed with RNA sequencing 117 . 8 . This method allows for millions of distinct peptide molecules to be sequenced in parallel, identified and digitally quantified on a zeptomole scale 9 . Specific amino acids are covalently labeled with spectrally distinguishable fluorophores, and the peptide fingerprint comes from measuring the decrease in fluorescence of peptides following Edman degradation 9 . Much as in MS, the partial sequence is mapped back to a reference proteome within a probabilistic framework.Current mass spectrometers have drawbacks in terms of their dynamic range, the read length (peptide length) of 'sequenced' peptides and biases in detectability arising from the ionization mechanism, transmission and the mass analyzer used.

        <p>The technology is not without challenges, as the reagents used for Edman degradation chemistry lead to increased rates of fluorescent dye destruction, which in turn limits the read length. These reagents include slightly basic structures such as pyridine, strong acids such as trifluoroacetic acid and the electrophile phenyl isothiocyanate. Furthermore, the reliance on chemical labeling leads to partial sequencing of the peptide, with the unidentified remainder inferred by comparison to a reference proteome. In addition, inefficient labeling can lead to errors that must be modeled into the reference proteome comparison, spurring the development of new protocols to increase yields 10 . Exciting new proposals could add the dimension of protonation-based sequencing. The pK a of the N-terminal amino acid could be used for identification by observing and interpreting the protonation-deprotonation signal of the peptide at fixed pH through the Edman degradation process 11 . Much like fluorosequencing, the signal observed would be for the whole peptide and the decay pattern would be interpreted to derive a pK a for each N-terminal amino acid.The technology is not without challenges, as the reagents used for Edman degradation chemistry lead to increased rates of fluorescent dye destruction, which in turn limits the read length.

        <p>With each cycle, another amino acid is revealed in the sequence of the peptide. However, further directed evolution and engineering of NAAB probes is required to meet the stringent affinity, selectivity and stability requirements for error-free sequencing applications. In addition, such probes would need to discriminate among all amino acids, including the same amino acid in alternative positions in the peptide sequence. Probes that bind a class of N-terminal amino acids (for example, short aliphatic residues) could also be useful but would introduce ambiguity in the sequencing process. Different probes could also be designed to recognize short N-terminal k-mers, which would increase the number of probes needed but reduce the ambiguity in the resulting sequencing information. To circumvent this limitation, it may be possible to sequence the N-terminal amino acid by selective recognition using a plurality of probes in each cycle of Edman degradation 13,14 (Fig. 2b).With each cycle, another amino acid is revealed in the sequence of the peptide.

        <p>Single-molecule mass spectrometry. MS is a century-old method that measures the mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio of ions, in particular, charged peptides/proteins and their assemblies. Single-ion detection has been possible since the 1990s, for example, in Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance instruments 15 . Charge detection MS (CDMS) is a single-ion method where the charge assignment of each individual ion is determined directly, enabling conversion of the mass-to-charge ratio into the neutral mass domain. This approach has focused on the analysis of large biomolecular complexes, especially viruses in the range of 1-100 MDa 16 . While previously CDMS was limited to specialized instrumentation, the past year has seen breakthroughs built on early work producing mass spectra of single ions in Orbitrap mass analyzers [17][18][19] . Today, these mass analyzers can be used to directly derive the charge states of single proteins and even their fragment ions 20 . Orbitrap instruments are particularly useful because the readout of individual ions can be multiplexed by 100-to 1,000-fold in Orbitrap-based CDMS 20 . Individual ion MS has already shown resolution of mixtures with approximately 1,000 proteoforms that provided no data using standard MS 20,21 . This has greatly expanded the top-down approach to confirm DNA-inferred sequences of whole proteins, including localization of their post-translational modifications [20][21][22] . Without extensive alteration, Orbitrap mass analyzers can therefore measure tens of thousands of proteins in a matter of minutes. With these rapidly evolving technologies, charting the full human proteoform atlas has already begun 23 , making strides toward a comprehensive human proteoform project. However, ionization is a critical requirement for MS of proteins and peptides, and not all peptides are efficiently ionized and transmitted through the mass spectrometer. This might restrict some of the proteoform mapping efforts, providing a niche for the other technologies in Fig. 1.Single-molecule mass spectrometry.

        <p>For higher-molecular-weight species, the ionization of proteins and complexes yields a mixture of macro ions with variable charge states, resulting in a net reduction of sensitivity as the signal distributes over multiple peaks in the mass-to-charge dimension. Moreover, charge state distributions may overlap above a certain mass or in the case of mixtures, creating challenges in species identification. Since their inception 24 , nanomechanical mass sensors have made tremendous progress toward protein characterization 25 . Such devices, which take the shape of cantilevers or beams with lateral dimensions in the range of hundreds of nanometers, can detect individual particles accreting onto their active surface through changes in vibration frequency. Importantly, as the inertial mass of a particle is determined directly from the frequency change, these devices are insensitive to charge states 26 . This realization prompted the development of new MS instrument designs devoid of ion guides, which no longer depend on electromagnetic fields to collect and transmit analytes (Fig. 2c).

        <p>The dream of extending MS-based proteomics to the single-cell level has eluded researchers for decades. Even as the sensitivity of MS instrumentation has improved to provide single-cell-compatible detection limits, in practice, samples comprising at least thousands of cells have been required to obtain an in-depth proteome profile. Two recent advances have made single-cell proteomics a reality. Miniaturized sample processing workflows such as nanodroplet processing in one pot for trace samples (nanoPOTS) 118 have dramatically increased the efficiency of single-cell sample preparation. NanoPOTS utilizes a robotic nanopipettor to interface with a microfabricated nanowell plate. The reduced surface contact and increased protein concentrations within the nanoliter-sized droplets dramatically enhance digestion kinetics and increase sample recovery for single cells and other trace samples. Concurrently, multiplexed strategies (for example, single-cell proteomics by mass spectrometry, SCoPE-MS) 119 have been developed in which proteins from single cells are labeled with unique isobaric tags and several cells are analyzed together in the presence of a larger carrier sample. The single cells and carrier provide a combined MS signal for each protein, and unique reporter ions released upon fragmentation enable protein quantification for each cell. While nanoPOTS and SCoPE-MS originally enabled quantification of hundreds of proteins 119,120 , the combination of these two techniques, as well as advances in miniaturized liquid chromatography and gas-phase separation, now enables more than 1,000 proteins to be quantified from single mammalian cells 121 . 27 . Outside of proteomics, a resolution of 1 Da has been demonstrated with carbon nanotubes 28 . Moreover, recent reports suggest the possibility of determining other physical parameters such as the stiffness or shape of the analyte by monitoring multiple vibrational modes 29,30 . These previously inaccessible metrics may open new avenues to discriminate peptides, proteins and their complexes.

        <p>Individual amino acids must be cleaved from the protein molecule as it transits the nanopore, which could potentially be accomplished with photodissociation 35 or chemical digestion methods. The 100-MHz bandwidth of the channeltron single-ion detectors used in this setup is also sufficient to resolve the arrival order of the ions. The high mass resolution makes this technique promising for identifying post-translational modifications, which change the masses of particular amino acids by predictable amounts. One challenge on the path for this technology will be achieving high throughput, which might require a strategy for parallelizing mass analysis.Individual amino acids must be cleaved from the protein molecule as it transits the nanopore, which could potentially be accomplished with photodissociation 35 or chemical digestion methods.

        <p>Tunneling conductance measurements. The appearance of the scanning tunneling microscope in the 1980s introduced a new way to analyze molecules. Small organic molecules can be transiently trapped between two metal electrodes with sub-nanometer separation, with the tunneling currents between the electrodes reporting on the molecular signature of the analyte. Recently, several technical advances have been made to move toward single-molecule amino acid and protein analysis. Extracting insightful information from electron tunneling is complicated by the noise resulting from water and contaminants reaching the electrode surfaces. To overcome this problem, recognition tunneling has been developed in which the electrodes are covalently modified with adaptor molecules that form transient but well-defined links to the target molecule 36 . The rapidly fluctuating tunnel current signals are processed using machine learning algorithms, which makes it possible to distinguish individual amino acids and small peptides 37 . Moreover, smaller electrode gaps have been introduced to obtain distinct signals from different amino acids and post-translational modifications 38 . Further development of the technology will depend on a reliable source of tunnel junctions with a defined gap to replace the cumbersome scanning tunneling microscopy, but it is clear that both the sequence and post-translational modifications of small peptides can be determined 37 . Currently, tunneling conductance is a proof-of-concept technology for fully sequencing short peptides that could one day be used for the analysis of protein digests and expanded to analysis of post-translational modifications (Fig. 1).Tunneling conductance measurements.

Currently, tunneling conductance is a proof-of-concept technology for fully sequencing short peptides that could one day be used for the analysis of protein digests and expanded to analysis of post-translational modifications (Fig. 1).</p>
        <p>Recently, it was discovered that electrical charges can be transmitted through a protein if the electrodes are bridged by a protein via formation of chemical bonds or ligand binding 39 . Specifically, changes in protein conformation upon nucleotide addition could be followed in real time from the direct currents passing through a DNA polymerase 40 . Although the observation was preliminary, the electronic signatures were distinctive when the polymerase was associated with different DNA sequences, enabling a new approach to label-free single-molecule DNA sequencing. A similar approach could potentially be used for protein sequencing with enzymes such as proteases or glycopeptidases that process substrates sequentially.Recently, it was discovered that electrical charges can be transmitted through a protein if the electrodes are bridged by a protein via formation of chemical bonds or ligand binding 39 .

        <p>The recent development of DNA-PAINT has allowed discrete molecular imaging (DMI) of individual molecular targets with spatial resolution below 5 nm 43 . Therefore, protein identification by fingerprinting of amino acids along an extended protein backbone is a possibility. DMI was achieved by combining a systematic analysis and optimization of the DNA-PAINT super-resolution workflow and a high-accuracy (&lt;1 nm) drift correction method. To effectively unfold and extend the protein backbone, N-and C-terminal-specific modifications should be used to attach surface and microbead anchors. The protein can then be subjected to mechanical or electromagnetic extension force (Fig. 3c). Proposals to combine protein extension methods with high-resolution DMI 45 indicate that, with lysine labeling alone and 5-nm effective imaging resolution, more than 50% of the human proteome could be uniquely identified, even with up to 20% amino acid imaging error. Labeling lysine and cysteine would allow coverage of the proteome to increase to more than 75%.The recent development of DNA-PAINT has allowed discrete molecular imaging (DMI) of individual molecular targets with spatial resolution below 5 nm 43 .

        <p>An alternative method for DNA-based protein identification attaches DNA probes to specific amino acids on a protein and uses enzymatic DNA amplification between nearby probes to generate DNA 'records' that vary in length and abundance according to pairwise distances within a protein 46 , as exemplified by autocycling proximity recording (APR) 47 (Fig. 3d). The distribution of the lengths of these molecular records is then analyzed to decode the pairwise distance between two DNA tags. It is possible to use unique molecular identifier (UMI) barcoding and repetitive enzymatic recording, such that each lysine and cysteine residue can be studied and used to construct a pairwise distance map, allowing for single-molecule protein identification 48,49 . DNA proximity recording takes advantage of high-throughput next-generation DNA sequencing methods for efficient protein fingerprinting analysis and will be useful for the analysis of both purified proteins and complex protein mixtures. First, the blinking kinetics (on and off rates) can be tuned over a wide range, by altering the length and sequence of the imager strands or buffer conditions, making the method compatible with different sample conditions. Second, repetitive binding with different imager strands makes the target 'non-bleachable' , allowing for the collection of a large number of high-quality and high-precision blinking events and for high-sensitivity imaging on single-molecule targets with discrete molecular resolution (&lt;5 nm). Finally, in combination with orthogonal sequence labels, DNA-PAINT can be multiplexed by imaging with up to dozens of molecular species (Exchange-PAINT). 50 . The current state of the art for single-molecule FRET analysis allows only one or two FRET pairs to be probed at a time 51 , and new high-resolution FRET using transient binding between DNA tags allows for one FRET pair to be probed at a time while many probes are collectively present on a single protein 50 . Similarly to the approaches described above, specific amino acids (for example, lysine, cysteine, etc.) required for fingerprinting have to be labeled with a set of different DNA docking strands. Furthermore, a fixed position on the protein (either the N or C terminus) is labeled with the acceptor fluorophore. Only a single FRET pair forms at a time using DNA strands that are complementary to only a single docking strand. Measurements are then repeated to probe the remaining docking strands and thus the amino acids. The output of this approach is a FRET histogram containing information on the position (referred to as FRET fingerprint) of each detected amino acid relative to one of the reference points. This information is compared to a database consisting of predicted FRET fingerprints, allowing for identification of the protein species (Fig. 3e). The proposed high-resolution FRET approach (named FRET using DNA eXchange, or FRET X) benefits from the immobilization of protein molecules, allowing users to probe each protein multiple times to obtain fingerprints with high resolution. FRET X is a particularly promising tool for targeted proteomics or proteoform analysis as it is able to distinguish small structural changes.An alternative method for DNA-based protein identification attaches DNA probes to specific amino acids on a protein and uses enzymatic DNA amplification between nearby probes to generate DNA 'records' that vary in length and abundance according to pairwise distances within a protein 46 , as exemplified by autocycling proximity recording (APR) 47 (Fig. 3d).

Many of the nanopore sequencing applications thus far have materialized using an ultra-small device 54 that features vast arrays of biological nanopores, each coupled to its own current amplifier, allowing readout of hundreds of DNA strands simultaneously. Owing primarily to the long read lengths and portability capabilities of this technology, nanopore-based DNA and direct RNA sequencing have become key players in the sequencing field. Nanopore sensing involves drawing biomolecules through the nanopore in a single-file manner. During their passage, the analytes partially block the flow of the ionic current through the pore, leading to time-dependent and sequence-specific electrical signals. Over the past two decades, a variety of synthetic nanopore biosensors have shown substantial progress and are currently used in diverse applications beyond sequencing, including the detection of epigenetic variations and ultra-sensitive detection of mRNA expression 55 , among many others. Just like gel electrophoresis, nanopores may serve as a generic tool to analyze biomolecules. Therefore, as nanopore-based DNA sequencing continues to advance, this technique is poised to extend to proteins, metabolites and other analytes. But despite the remarkable advances in DNA and RNA sequencing, nanopore-based protein sensing is still in its infancy, facing challenges unique to proteins and proteomics. In particular, proteins span a large range of sizes and have a stable three-dimensional folded structure. In contrast to nucleic acids, the backbones of peptides are not naturally charged, complicating the possibility of single-file electrokinetic threading into nanopores. In addition, proteins are composed of combinations of 20 different amino acids instead of 4 nucleobases, further complicating the task of relating the ionic current signals to the amino acid sequence.Since its first demonstration as a single-biomolecule sensor 52 , nanopore sensing has dramatically advanced, ultimately achieving the goal of single-molecule DNA sequencing 53 .

        <p>An essential step in the development of nanopore-based DNA sequencing came with the application of an enzymatic stepping motor (for example, a helicase) that facilitated nucleotide-by-nucleotide progression of the DNA through the nanopore. A similar system is being pursued for single-molecule protein sequencing: molecular motors of the type II secretion system (SecY) 64 and the AAA family (ClpX) 65 are known to unfold and pull protein substrates through pores in an ATP-dependent manner. Nivala et al. 66,67 used ClpXP (or ClpX alone) to unfold and translocate a multidomain fusion protein through the α-hemolysin pore using energy derived from ATP hydrolysis. In this approach, the motor is at the exit of the nanopore and the step size of translocation is therefore dependent on stable structural motifs that resist translocation, rather than being controlled by the enzyme. This approach is currently being expanded by several groups who conjugated ClpXP covalently to α-hemolysin at the entrance of the nanopore to form a combination sensor and substrate delivery machine. The Maglia laboratory genetically introduced a nanopore directly into an archaeal proteasome and found that assisted transport across the nanopore was not influenced by the unfolding of the protein. These nanoscale constructs would also allow a 'chop-and-drop' approach in which single proteins are recognized by their pattern of peptide fragments as they are sequentially cleaved by the peptidase above the nanopore 68 .

        <p>Labeling efficiency and stability. The challenges in labeling efficiency and stability are well characterized in fluorosequencing, which uses harsh conditions (including neat trifluoroacetic acid) that can lead to reversal of maleimide labeling of cysteine residues. To circumvent this reversal, fluorosequencing instead uses iodoacetamide chemistry, which generates a more stable bond. Another point of complexity is that full conversion is dictated by the solvent accessibility of the targeted amino acid side chains, which can influence labeling efficiency. However, modeling suggests that labeling efficiencies and stabilities substantially below 100% can be compensated for computationally, at least to some degree, during the reference database matching process 8 .Labeling efficiency and stability.

Additionally, the phenol ring of tyrosine can be labeled using benzyl diazo groups 122 ; however, the attachment of fluorescent molecules generally requires a two-step labeling procedure owing to the cross-reactivity with fluorescent molecules. Another robust bioconjugation method to selectively target tyrosine side chains is an ene-like reaction with cyclic diazodicaboxamides in aqueous buffer 123 . Carboxylic acids have also been labeled on peptides, but, owing to the similar reactivities of aspartate, glutamate and the C terminus, this has primarily been used on synthetic peptides. The method makes use of a standard technique (EDC coupling) for binding amines covalently to carboxylic acids, forming an amide bond. In a recently reported promising bioconjugation approach, light-activated 2,5-disubstituted tetrazoles have been shown to be able to convert glutamate and aspartate residues with high yield 124 .

These simulations predict that even partial labeling of proteins would be sufficient to achieve a high degree of accurate whole-proteome identification, owing to the ability of AI functions to correctly recognize partial protein patterns. This identification method involves the incorporation of sub-wavelength light localization in the proximity of the nanopore using plasmonic nanostructures 82 .

Ohayon et al. recently showed computationally that more than 95% of the proteins in the human proteome can be identified with high confidence when labeling three amino acids (lysine, cysteine and methionine) and threading them linearly through a solid-state nanopore 77 . These simulations predict that even partial labeling of proteins would be sufficient to achieve a high degree of accurate whole-proteome identification, owing to the ability of AI functions to correctly recognize partial protein patterns. This identification method involves the incorporation of sub-wavelength light localization in the proximity of the nanopore using plasmonic nanostructures 82 . The work in this field benefits from recent advances in nanofabrication and nanopatterning technologies allowing for the formation of complex metallic nanostructures to localize fluorescence through plasmon resonance 83 .</p>
        <p>Characterization and identification of folded proteins. Thus far, nanopores have successfully to detect specific sets of folded proteins and protein oligomers 84 (Fig. 4c) such as large globular proteins, various cytokines and even low-molecular-weight proteins such as ubiquitin. Holding proteins in their folded state inside the nanopore for sufficiently long periods of time is a key requirement. Early studies have shown that globular proteins in the molecular weight range of roughly 5 to 50 kDa can only be detected for a few tens of microseconds or less 85 , which is too short for characterization. Several approaches to overcome this challenge have been devised. A lipid bilayer coating of a solid-state nanopore can be used to tether the proteins for extended periods of time 86 . Lipid-tethered proteins 86 and, more recently, freely diffusing proteins (using a higher-bandwidth sensing system) 87 have been characterized with respect to their size, shape, charge, dipole and rotational diffusion coefficient 88 . Various strategies are being pursued to 'trap' proteins in a nanopore. One such strategy is to use plasmonics to hold a protein in a nanopore for seconds or even minutes 89,90 . More recently, single proteins have been held at the nanopore's most sensitive region for minutes to hours using the nanopore electro-osmotic trap (NEOtrap), which exploits strong electro-osmotic water flows created in situ by a charged, permeable object, such as a DNA origami structure 91 . Another approach for slowing down the translocation of proteins involves the use of nanopores smaller than those in earlier studies to increase the hydrodynamic drag, thus resulting in longer translocation dwell times that are easier to measure 92,93 . In addition, high-bandwidth measurements can resolve differential size and conformational flexibility between and within folded proteins [92][93][94][95][96] . Biological nanopores with a diameter of 5.5 or 10 nm 97 can also be used to measure folded proteins, including protein conformations 98 and post-translational modifications 99 such as ubiquitination. Lastly, Aramesh et al. 100 used a combination of atomic-force microscopy and nanopore technology to carry out the first steps of nanopore sensing directly inside cells. Altogether, the detection, identification and sequencing of proteins using single-nanopore approaches has become a highly active, thriving research field, with great potential to revolutionize proteomics, medical diagnostics and also the fundamental biosciences.Characterization and identification of folded proteins.

        <p>Protein glycosylation can be complex, featuring many different types of monomeric units bound in possibly branching polymer structures. Full structural characterization often requires derivatization and is done on glycans that are released from the protein. Therefore, schemes for understanding site-specific and simple glycosylation events should be the current focus. N-glycan-anchoring asparagine residues can be converted to aspartate by glycan removal with PNGase F for practically all protein sequencing approaches, reducing complexity in the detection of this modification. Another possibility to introduce site-selective labels is the incorporation of azide-tagged glycans, achieved by adding modified carbohydrates to the cell medium 136 .

There are a large number of methods to label amino acids; however, some chemistries do not provide sufficiently stable bonds for some single-molecule sequencing approaches.

        <p>Challenges for next-generation protein sequencing. Two grand challenges await technological innovations and need to be addressed to enable the high-throughput sequencing of complex protein mixtures. First, there is no method to amplify the copy number of proteins similar to the methods used for nucleic acids. New techniques focus on characterizing individual proteins. The aim is to sequence proteomes starting from a low number of cells or minute samples that often contain just a few or single copies of specific proteins. This presents a second problem: a single eukaryotic cell contains billions of proteins. While the presented methods may enable single-molecule protein identification, they must reach an extremely high sensing throughput to profile all proteins in the cell and permit whole-cell analysis on a reasonable timescale. These two seemingly contractionary requirements (single-protein molecule sensitivity and extremely high throughput) present one of the main challenges to the field, and striking an optimal balance between them will be key for all the technologies discussed. Of the orthogonal methods presented, nanopores, fluorosequencing and protein linear barcoding using DNA-PAINT, to name a few, stand a chance to eventually measure billions of proteins within a few hours.Challenges for next-generation protein sequencing.
