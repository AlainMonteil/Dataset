        <p>In May 2019, the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) convened a panel of nutritionists, physiologists and microbiologists to review the definition and scope of synbiotics. The panel updated the definition of a synbiotic to "a mixture comprising live microorganisms and substrate(s) selectively utilized by host microorganisms that confers a health benefit on the host". The panel concluded that defining synbiotics as simply a mixture of probiotics and prebiotics could suppress the innovation of synbiotics that are designed to function cooperatively. Requiring that each component must meet the evidence and dose requirements for probiotics and prebiotics individually could also present an obstacle. Rather, the panel clarified that a complementary synbiotic, which has not been designed so that its component parts function cooperatively, must be composed of a probiotic plus a prebiotic, whereas a synergistic synbiotic does not need to be so. A synergistic synbiotic is a synbiotic for which the substrate is designed to be selectively utilized by the co-administered microorganisms. This Consensus Statement further explores the levels of evidence (existing and required), safety, effects upon targets and implications for stakeholders of the synbiotic concept.In May 2019, the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) convened a panel of nutritionists, physiologists and microbiologists to review the definition and scope of synbiotics.

        <p>Notable properties of the gut microbiota include its functionality and resilience 1 . A stable gut community protects the host against invading microorganisms and helps maintain homeostasis, including immune regulation. Nonetheless, disruptions occur owing to dietary shifts, antibiotic use, age or infection, leading to a gut microbiota that can contribute to a range of inflammatory, pathogenic and metabolic conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases, colorectal cancer, metabolic syndrome and atopy 2 . Several strategies have been proposed to modulate the composition and/or function of the gut microbiota, including faecal microbiota transplants, the application of probiotics and other live microorganisms, and the use of non-digestible dietary substrates such as prebiotics 3,4 .Notable properties of the gut microbiota include its functionality and resilience 1 .

        <p>When the synbiotic concept was first described 25 years ago, the notion that selectively fermentable non-digestible food ingredients (prebiotics) could be combined with probiotics was envisioned 5 . Thus, synbiotics were loosely defined as mixtures of "probiotics and prebiotics that beneficially affect the host" 5 . The term itself was formed from the Greek prefix 'syn' , meaning 'together' and the suffix 'biotic' , meaning 'pertaining to life' . Despite the availability of similarly worded definitions, confusion exists among stakeholders, including scientists, about what constitutes a synbiotic [6][7][8][9] . A general misunderstanding might have been, in part, because the original definition itself -that is, "mixtures of probiotics and prebiotics that beneficially affect the host by improving the survival and implantation of live microbial dietary supplements in the gastrointestinal tract, by selectively stimulating the growth and/or by activating the metabolism of one or a limited number of health-promoting bacteria, thus improving host welfare" -was too wordy and lacked precision 5 . In addition, the expansion of the entire '-biotics' category, including terms such as postbiotic 10 and pharmabiotic 11 , almost certainly further contributes to confusion. To provide clarity and guidance regarding appropriate use of the term 'synbiotic' , in May 2019, the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) convened an expert panel of academic scientists to address the current status of synbiotics, including its definition. The outcomes of that meeting and subsequent discussions comprise this Consensus Statement. A summary of key conclusions is shown in Box 1. Herein, we consider applicable efficacy and mechanistic evidence on combination probiotic plus prebiotic products, we recommend the research needed to establish a 'synbiotic' formulation, discuss the safety considerations, and reflect on implications for stakeholders of the synbiotic concept.When the synbiotic concept was first described 25 years ago, the notion that selectively fermentable non-digestible food ingredients (prebiotics) could be combined with probiotics was envisioned 5 .

        <p>ISAPP is a non-profit collaboration of scientists dedicated to advancing scientific excellence and providing objective, science-based information on probiotics and prebiotics. The organization's activities are funded by companies involved in the sale of probiotics and prebiotics, but ISAPP is guided by an international, all-volunteer academic board that functions independently. This ISAPP-organized panel was composed of experts in microbiology, nutrition and gastrointestinal physiology, including many who were involved in the latest updates of the probiotic 12 and prebiotic 13 definitions according to ISAPP. Panellists were charged with accomplishing the following goals: consider what a synbiotic is and provide a clear, concise and testable definition; suggest the appropriate experimental conditions necessary to establish synbiotic activity; describe the evidence required to demonstrate the health benefits and establish safety; and provide guidance for stakeholders, including researchers, industry, public health professionals and regulatory agencies.ISAPP is a non-profit collaboration of scientists dedicated to advancing scientific excellence and providing objective, science-based information on probiotics and prebiotics.

        <p>The panel updated the definition of a synbiotic to "a mixture comprising live microorganisms and substrate(s) selectively utilized by host microorganisms that confers a health benefit on the host". 'Host' microorganisms in this context include both autochthonous microorganisms (resident or colonizing the host) and allochthonous microorganisms (externally applied, such as probiotics), which, even if transiently present, do constitute a component of the host microbiota.The panel updated the definition of a synbiotic to "a mixture comprising live microorganisms and substrate(s) selectively utilized by host microorganisms that confers a health benefit on the host".

        <p>The panel considered defining synbiotics as simply a mixture of probiotics and prebiotics. Common to the definition of both probiotics and prebiotics is the requirement that each independently provides a health benefit and the dose of each must be adequate to independently achieve those benefit(s). However, the panel recognized the possibility that a functional synbiotic could be formulated at doses below those at which the probiotic or prebiotic could independently exert health benefits. Alternatively, a particular microorganism might lack probiotic functions even at high dosages owing to competition or other ecological effects but, in the presence of a suitable substrate, could provide a health benefit. Likewise, a novel substrate, again even at high doses, might not by itself provide benefits but could do so when combined with a selected live microorganism(s) that it can enhance. Such formulations comprise a live microorganism and a substrate that depend on the presence of one another and function in concert. Simply put, the microbial component does not necessarily have to be a standalone probiotic and the non-digestible substrate does not necessarily have to be a standalone prebiotic, but, if together they provide a health benefit, then the mixture can be called a synbiotic. This proposed definition of a synbiotic should encourage innovation in formulations by not requiring that component parts meet the strict definitions of either a probiotic or a prebiotic.The panel considered defining synbiotics as simply a mixture of probiotics and prebiotics.

        <p>However, the panel also recognized that a current common usage of the term synbiotic includes products that combine a probiotic and a prebiotic. Such a combination product might not have any evidence of co-dependent function but is instead designed for the components to work independently to promote an observed health benefit(s). The panel agreed that such a formulation could be considered a synbiotic, provided that components meet the respective probiotic 12 and prebiotic 13 definitions (Fig. 1). Thus, the probiotic strain(s) is chosen based on the benefits that it provides to the host, while the prebiotic is designed to promote the growth and activities of beneficial members of the indigenous microbiota and provide a health benefit 14 . Furthermore, a combination of probiotic plus prebiotic must be tested to confirm that a health benefit is conferred by the combined formulation compared with a placebo. Otherwise, the product should not be labelled a synbiotic. Based on these qualifiers, the panel retained the definition that a combination of a probiotic and a prebiotic be denoted as a complementary synbiotic (discussed later) 14 .However, the panel also recognized that a current common usage of the term synbiotic includes products that combine a probiotic and a prebiotic.

        <p>The other type of synbiotic previously envisioned is a synergistic synbiotic, which is a synbiotic in which the substrate is designed to be selectively utilized by the co-administered microorganisms. To be a synergistic synbiotic, the live microorganism is selected based on its ability to provide a health benefit and the substrate is chosen to primarily support the growth or activity of that selected microorganism 14 . Although the substrate might also enrich other beneficial members of the gastrointestinal microbiota, its main target is the ingested microorganism.The other type of synbiotic previously envisioned is a synergistic synbiotic, which is a synbiotic in which the substrate is designed to be selectively utilized by the co-administered microorganisms.

        <p>Designing and demonstrating the efficacy of a synergistic synbiotic is experimentally challenging. To our knowledge, nearly all synbiotics used in published clinical trials or available commercially are of the complementary form 15 , irrespective of whether they have been deliberately designed or named as such. Approaches to designing complementary and synergistic synbiotics are shown in Fig. 2.Designing and demonstrating the efficacy of a synergistic synbiotic is experimentally challenging.

        <p>It is important to clarify that, although synbiotics can be formulated to provide synergistic activities, the 'syn' prefix in the word 'synbiotic' is not intended to imply synergy; it means 'together' . Of note, the term 'symbiotic' is often misused in this context and is not the same as synbiotic. Symbiotic, as used in biology 16 , refers to an ecological relationship in which one organism (the symbiont) lives in a long-term relationship in a natural ecosystem with another organism (the host), that is, in symbiosis.It is important to clarify that, although synbiotics can be formulated to provide synergistic activities, the 'syn' prefix in the word 'synbiotic' is not intended to imply synergy; it means 'together' .

        <p>A synbiotic should be characterized to the extent needed to ensure safety and a consistent performance. Live microbial component(s) of the synbiotic should have a publicly available genome sequence and annotation, be assessed for any genes of safety concern (for example, toxin production or transferrable antibiotic resistance), named using current taxonomic nomenclature and carry a traceable strain designation. The strain(s) should also be deposited into a recognized international culture collection that permits access by scientists to conduct research. In short, the safety, identity, purity and potency of the live microorganism should be clearly and accurately described according to the best available methods that meet applicable regulatory standards for the product category.A synbiotic should be characterized to the extent needed to ensure safety and a consistent performance.

        <p>The structure and purity of the substrate should be stated and characterized by appropriate chemical analyses. This process includes testing for microbial and other contaminants as per regulatory standards for the country of sale. The level of purity required will depend on what is needed to ensure a consistent performance and safety of the product. The level of active substrate in commercial preparations of prebiotics available worldwide ranges considerably, often from 35% to 99% [17][18][19] . The monosaccharides and disaccharides carried over from the production process that are present in prebiotic preparations are typically digested and absorbed by the host in the upper gastrointestinal tract after oral ingestion. A relevant issue is whether the material used in the formulation is sufficient to deliver a consistent dose of the active component and result in reproducible selective utilization by microorganisms and beneficial health effect(s) in the target host. This issue highlights that studies should communicate the content of the active ingredient being tested in addition to the quantity of the overall product. For example, a 6 g dosage of 50% pure galacto-oligosaccharides would provide 3 g of the active substrate and should be reported as such.The structure and purity of the substrate should be stated and characterized by appropriate chemical analyses.

        <p>The active ingredients of a synbiotic must be sufficiently stable. Ensuring stability of the live microbial component of a synbiotic can be challenging 20 . When live microorganisms are combined with a substrate(s) in a matrix (for example, liquid, dried or ointment), the burden is on manufacturers to ensure that the dosage of the live microorganism required to confer the stated health benefit is delivered throughout the shelf-life. Live microorganism viability is highly dependent on the matrix, storage temperature, pH and oxygen level of the product: for liquid products, the shelf-life might be as short as 1-2 weeks, for lyophilized or encapsulated products, the shelf-life might be as long as 2 years. Packaging and storage conditions must control critical factors, such as water activity and temperature, through production to distribution and usage. Furthermore, a synbiotic must undergo assessment of safety for the intended use, as described later.The active ingredients of a synbiotic must be sufficiently stable.

        <p>Across studies, species from the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus are the most commonly used live microorganisms within the formulations tested. The substrate components are usually galactooligosaccharides, inulin or fructo-oligosaccharides but doses vary considerably, from as low as 100 mg to as much as 10-15 g per day. For example, in a double-blind RCT, twice daily consumption of a synbiotic composed of Lactobacillus acidophilus 10 (10 9 CFU), Lactobacillus rhamnosus HS111 (10 9 CFU), Lactobacillus casei 10 (10 9 CFU), Bifidobacterium bifidum (10 9 CFU) and fructo-oligosaccharides (100 mg) 4 days before and 10 days after surgery for periampullary neoplasms resulted in a lower number of postoperative infections, a shorter duration of antibiotic therapy, fewer non-infectious complications, shorter length of hospital stay and reduced mortality than in patients receiving a placebo (sucrose) 45 . Although such low doses would not be expected to provide a prebiotic effect in complementary synbiotics, they could, in theory, be sufficient to stimulate a cognate microorganism in a synergistic synbiotic formulation. In one RCT 46 of 225 adults with overweight and obesity, a combination of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 420 and polydextrose (12 g per day) resulted in a relative reduction in body fat mass of 4.5%, whereas the individual treatments had no effect. However, selective utilization was not established in this study. Thus, by itself, this study does not provide sufficient evidence that the tested combination was either a complementary or a synergistic synbiotic.Across studies, species from the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus are the most commonly used live microorganisms within the formulations tested.

        <p>Ideally, the health benefit of a synbiotic would be superadditive, that is, it would exceed the benefit observed for the sum of the individual components. However, owing to the difficulties in demonstrating different levels of health benefit in an efficacy trial, the panel did not insist upon this aspect. Instead, we advocate requiring a measurable, confirmed health benefit of the synbiotic, which is conferred, at least in part, through selective utilization of the substrate(s) provided in the synbiotic. Although in vitro and animal models are used frequently to test the effects of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics [50][51][52][53] , it is our position that these have not been fully validated as predictive and that definitive tests of these interventions must be performed in the target host. Of course, model experiments can add mechanistic insights, in particular in cases for which available samples from studies in the target host have limited usefulness (for example, faeces, which are not reflective of upstream intestinal microbial or metabolic activities).Ideally, the health benefit of a synbiotic would be superadditive, that is, it would exceed the benefit observed for the sum of the individual components.

        <p>As noted, it is required that the health benefit of the synbiotic mixture be confirmed, even when established probiotic(s) and prebiotic(s) (that is, ones that meet criteria stipulated in respective definitions and are used at efficacious doses) are used to formulate components of the synbiotic. This requirement would account for any potential antagonistic effect of the combination that might diminish the health benefits of each component independently. Although unlikely, such antagonism is theoretically possible, as shown in in vitro studies whereby some carbohydrate substrates increased the production of antimicrobial compounds by probiotics 54 . Depending on which microorganism is able to utilize the substrate, which antimicrobial factors are produced, and which taxa are neutralized or killed by them, such a scenario could lead to positive or negative outcomes. Therefore, in the absence of evidence that the combination product provides a health benefit, a product should simply be labelled as "contains probiotics and prebiotics". Sanders et al. 55 provide a perspective on determining whether evidence from studies using one formulation (for example, a prebiotic or a probiotic alone) can be extrapolated to different formulations (for example, when combining a prebiotic and a probiotic).As noted, it is required that the health benefit of the synbiotic mixture be confirmed, even when established probiotic(s) and prebiotic(s) (that is, ones that meet criteria stipulated in respective definitions and are used at efficacious doses) are used to formulate components of the synbiotic.

        <p>Design. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is recommended for synbiotic research. The study should be registered with accepted protocol and results systems such as ClinicalTrials.gov. Study quality factors include, but are not limited to, appropriate blinding, randomization, the allocation concealment mechanism, reporting of inclusion and/or exclusion criteria and adverse events (AEs), completion of intention-to-treat analyses, and adequate statistical power. Crossover designs might be preferred to account for the individualized nature of the gut microbiota. The wash-out period length should be based on the primary outcome with consideration for secondary outcomes; a 2-week wash-out between conditions is generally adequate for gut microbiota outcomes, although longer times might be necessary for some populations (for example, the elderly or for those with constipation or functional bowel disorders). Parallel-arm designs might be required for long-term outcomes (such as weight loss or glycaemia). The number of study groups required depends on whether the researchers intend to demonstrate synergism (TaBle 2). Health outcomes and selective utilization of the substrate by host microbiota must be demonstrated in the same study. When experimental trials are not feasible or ethical, observational trials, including prospective longitudinal studies, are useful; these studies must accurately capture synbiotic exposure and control for relevant confounders (such as diet or antibiotics).Design.

The test strain had been obtained by an in vivo selection strategy intended to select for strains that would be expected to provide synergistic outcomes. In addition to the synbiotic, GoS, B. adolescentis IvS-1 and placebo (lactose) controls were also included.

To assess intestinal permeability, non-metabolizable sugars were measured in urine following the consumption of a sugar mixture. Although the results showed that all three treatments (GoS only, B. adolescentis IvS-1 only and the combination) markedly improved gut barrier function, there was no statistically significant difference among the three groups. The B. adolescentis IvS-1 group was significantly enriched but the addition of GoS as a synbiotic did not further increase strain abundance. likewise, all three treatments significantly increased the absolute abundance of faecal bifidobacteria compared to baseline, but there was no statistically significant difference among the three groups.

Pre-specified subgroup analyses should be considered based on the relevant clinical factors (such as sex and age), baseline gut microbiota factors, dietary factors (such as typical dietary fibre intake) or other relevant factors (such as responder analysis). The number of experimental groups or 'study arms' required to prove efficacy and support mechanistic understanding will depend on the existing level of evidence for the component live microorganism(s) and selectively utilized substrate(s) as well as the researchers' intent to determine whether components of the test mixture are complementary or acting as synergistic synbiotics (TaBle 2).There are multiple ways to design a synbiotic trial intended to examine health effects in the target host.

        <p>Responders and non-responders among study participants in intervention studies with probiotics and prebiotics are commonly observed, which could justify including the probability of a positive response as a study end point. In the context of synbiotics, non-responders include individuals for whom little or no change in gut microbiota composition and/or clinical end point occurs compared with placebo. Various reasons for the non-responder phenotype include limited available niches for desired gut microorganisms (either native or introduced as probiotics) 47 , limited substrates to support microbial growth 62 , host immune system expressing intolerance for specific microorganisms 63 or a lack of specific microorganisms in the host microbiota 3 . Although many scenarios of formulations for synbiotics can be conceived, we provide both actual and hypothetical examples to illustrate the concept (Box 2).Responders and non-responders among study participants in intervention studies with probiotics and prebiotics are commonly observed, which could justify including the probability of a positive response as a study end point.

        <p>Trials for synergistic synbiotics. Studies on a synergistic synbiotic that compare the synbiotic to the control can provide supportive evidence but do not constitute the primary evidence needed to confirm a synergistic synbiotic. Instead, a study including the combination, the substrate alone, the live microorganisms alone and a control should be conducted. Using an appropriate statistical model, the aim is to demonstrate that the combined effect is better than the estimated effects of each component separately. Evidence of selective utilization of the substrate by the co-administered live microorganism must be obtained from the same trial demonstrating the health benefit.Trials for synergistic synbiotics.

        <p>Measurement of selective utilization. Measurement of selective utilization by the microbiota might involve different approaches, including both in vitro model systems and in vivo studies in the target host. For example, selective utilization of a substrate could be demonstrated experimentally using well-established in vitro gut models 64 that include measurement of substrates and products during a prescribed time course. Ultimately, however, studies must be done in the target host to show that specific microorganisms or taxa had been enriched or their activity enhanced by a particular substrate. For synergistic synbiotics, methods that quantify the live microorganism should be used to show that the target strain has indeed been enriched 21 and other suitable methods can be used to show that its function has been enhanced. Microbiota features that are useful to measure can include characterization of the overall gut microbial community and microbiota diversity 65 , abundance and/or activity of specific taxa 66 , microorganismmicroorganism or microorganism-host proximity 67 , the presence and/or abundance of specific microbial genes or gene clusters of interest, and/or metabolite concentrations 68 .Measurement of selective utilization.

        <p>Thorough safety assessment of a synergistic synbiotic requires consideration that the added microorganism will express enhanced functionality in the presence of a targeted substrate such as improved growth or altered metabolic or physiological activity in vivo. This aspect suggests that safety assessments conducted on the live microorganism in isolation might not be sufficient to enable a conclusion about its safety when paired with a substrate that alters physiology or might in effect alter the dose delivered in vivo. Implications of such an interaction should be considered when assessing the safety of synergistic synbiotics.Thorough safety assessment of a synergistic synbiotic requires consideration that the added microorganism will express enhanced functionality in the presence of a targeted substrate such as improved growth or altered metabolic or physiological activity in vivo.

        <p>Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. A prebiotic is a substrate that is selectively utilized by host microorganisms conferring a health benefit.

A complementary synbiotic is a mixture of a probiotic plus a prebiotic. A synergistic synbiotic is a synbiotic in which the substrate is designed to be selectively utilized by the co-administered microorganisms. A synbiotic must meet the evidence required for either complementary or synergistic synbiotics. All substances should be made available to the scientific community for validation of research findings. a The intent of a synergistic synbiotic is for the substrate to support the growth and/or activity of the co-administered live microorganisms but selective utilization by the resident microbiota is not a disqualifier.

        <p>One regulatory consequence of probiotic and prebiotic definitions is that the European Union has determined that labelling a food product as such amounts to an implied health claim 90 . As health claims in the European Union must be approved, the use of 'probiotic' or 'prebiotic' on a food label is subject to a health claim approval process. Despite controversy surrounding this situation, we can expect that the European Union might adopt a similar position for the use of the term 'synbiotic' because it also requires evidence of a health benefit.

        <p>Media. The media (TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, websites and social media) have an increasingly central role in communicating science. These efforts require commitment and skill to craft clear, simple messages that are true to the science. Too often, scientists or their institutions do not effectively translate complex research findings so that they can be understood by the lay public. At times, overextended or inflated representations of research findings can be communicated through official academic or journal press releases. Communicators are therefore encouraged to distinguish between association studies and those presenting causal evidence, to describe single studies in the context of the totality of evidence, to avoid overgeneralizing results (for example, from model organisms such as mice) and to note study limitations. This requirement is true for null studies as well as those suggesting benefits from the interventions being tested.

        <p>This Consensus Statement provides a new definition for a 'synbiotic' based on review by a panel of experts. To summarize (Box 1), a synbiotic is a mixture comprising live microorganisms and substrate(s) selectively utilized by host microorganisms that confers a health benefit on the host. Two categories of synbiotics are recognized. A complementary synbiotic is composed of a probiotic and a prebiotic that together confer one or more health benefits but do not require co-dependent function; the components must be used at doses that have been shown to be effective for the components alone. A synergistic synbiotic contains a substrate that is selectively utilized by the co-administered live microorganism(s). Synbiotic products are not confined to human applications but could also include companion animals and livestock. They might also be directed to specific subpopulations (age, sex, health status) of the target species. The definition can also be applied to intestinal or extra-intestinal microbial ecosystems. The hope is that, going forward, this updated definition will be utilized and that it will aid in advancing synbiotic research, improve stakeholder understanding and enable better communication to consumers.This Consensus Statement provides a new definition for a 'synbiotic' based on review by a panel of experts.
