        <p>Results: Higher waist circumference was associated with lower antibody (Ab) titres (R = -0.324, p = 0.004); smokers had lower levels compared to non-smokers [1099 (1350) vs. 1921 (1375), p = 0.007], as well as hypertensive versus normotensive [650 ± 1192 vs. 1911 (1364), p = 0.001] and dyslipideamic compared to those with normal serum lipids [534 (972) vs 1872 (1406), p = 0.005]. Multivariate analysis showed that higher waist circumference, smoking, hypertension, and longer time elapsed since second vaccine inoculation were associated with lower Ab titres, independent of BMI, age. and gender. Conclusions: Central obesity, hypertension, and smoking are associated with lower Ab titres following COVID-19 vaccination. Although it is currently impossible to determine whether lower SARS-CoV-2 Abs lead to higher likelihood of developing COVID-19, it is well-established that neutralizing antibodies Mikiko Watanabe, Angela Balena, and Dario Tuccinardi contributed equally to this study.Results: Higher waist circumference was associated with lower antibody (Ab) titres (R = -0.324, p = 0.004); smokers had lower levels compared to non-smokers [1099 (1350) vs. 1921 (1375), p = 0.007], as well as hypertensive versus normotensive [650 ± 1192 vs. 1911 (1364), p = 0.001] and dyslipideamic compared to those with normal serum lipids [534 (972) vs 1872 (1406), p = 0.005].

        <p>Since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was described in 2019, the world has faced an unprecedented pandemic causing millions of deaths. Obesity and excess visceral fat were shown to be major risk factors for the development of complications following COVID-19 infection, [1][2][3][4] and, even before vaccines were made available, concerns regarding the possibility that obesity may blunt their efficacy were raised. 5 In December 2021, Polack et al. 6 reported promising results regarding an mRNA vaccine against COVID-19, BNT162b2 (Pfizer, Inc., and BioNTech), which conferred 95% protection against COVID-19 in adult subjects. The trial enrolled approximately 44,000 subjects, and there were 8 and 162 COVID-19 cases, respectively, following the two doses of vaccine or placebo. Despite the population comprising 35% of patients with a BMI of more than 30, and the good efficacy data reported towards COVID-19 infection, evidence regarding the ability to protect against severe COVID-19 is less certain for subpopulations, and long-term data are lacking. Moreover, obesity is not defined by BMI, but by the presence of fat excess, 7 BMI often mistakenly including subjects with fat excess in the normal weight category and vice versa. Body fat measured through bioimpedentiometry (BIA) or dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) may represent an alternative, but cut-off values have never been validated, and the necessary equipment may not be promptly available in many clinical practices. The use of waist circumference as a measure of central obesity is, conversely, well established, and the European Association for the Study of Obesity, recommends to screen for obesity complications not only those with a BMI ≥ 25, but also those with central obesity (waist circumference ≥80 cm for women and ≥94 cm for men). To the best of our knowledge, no studies are available to date investigating the real-life immunogenicity following BNT162b2 vaccine in relation to body composition and body fat distribution. In Italy, the BNT162b2 Pfizer BioNtech vaccine has been selected to be administered to healthcare professionals since December 2020.Since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was described in 2019, the world has faced an unprecedented pandemic causing millions of deaths.

        <p>Subjects included in this single-centre observational study were enrolled among healthcare workers of Policlinico Umberto I of Rome voluntarily undergoing a Pfizer BioNtech COVID-19 vaccine in January and February 2021. All subjects had undergone repeat nasoand oro-pharyngeal swabs as per hospital policy throughout the pandemic, and no previous infection had been recorded. Before enrolment, all subjects underwent a venous blood draw in order to confirm absence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Those who had a positive serology were excluded from the study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: age over 18 years old, stable body weight (less than 5 kg self-reported change during the preceding 3 months); absence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, absence of contraindications to the vaccine, willingness to undergo voluntary vaccination, absence of immunodepression, no use of medications known to impact the immune system, and no ongoing pregnancy. Data about demographic characteristics were collected with the means of a structured interview. The study was approved by the local IRB (prot. CE 6228), conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants before enrolment.Subjects included in this single-centre observational study were enrolled among healthcare workers of Policlinico Umberto I of Rome voluntarily undergoing a Pfizer BioNtech COVID-19 vaccine in January and February 2021.

        <p>Anthropometric parameters were measured at baseline. Body weight was measured using a balance-beam scale (Seca GmbH &amp; Co). Height was rounded to the closest 0.5 cm. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by squared height in metres (kg/m 2 ). Waist circumference was measured midway between the lower rib and the iliac crest, hip circumference at the level of the widest circumference over the great trochanters to the closest 1.0 cm. The measurements were performed with the means of an anelastic tape by trained professionals. Body composition was measured through DXA (Hologic 4500) as previously reported. 9Anthropometric parameters were measured at baseline.

Normality was assessed with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. To build a multivariate linear regression model with Ab titres as the dependent variable, we used an enter method approach (all the independent variables included in the same regression equation) and investigated the following variables/models: ( ]. For the analysis, a p-IN = 0.05 and a p-OUT = 0.10 were used. The effect estimate is reported as the coefficient of determination R 2 , which informs on how much the model explains the variance of the dependent variable. Variance inflation factor (VIF) values were lower than 4.0, suggesting the absence of multicollinearity between included variables. 10 The results were considered statistically significant when p &lt; 0.05.

        <p>Patients with higher waist circumference had significantly lower SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres (R = -0.324, p = 0.004; Figure 1A). Interestingly, obesity identified as a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 was not associated with a lower SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres (p = 0.524; data not shown). Furthermore, subjects with a smoking habit had lower Ab levels compared to those who were not current smokers [1099 Regression analysis showed that the presence of central obesity (as waist circumference measurement or waist-to-hip ratio) was associated with lower antibody concentration following the vaccine, as were hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and smoking habit (Table 2).Patients with higher waist circumference had significantly lower SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres (R = -0.324, p = 0.004; Figure 1A).

        <p>Moreover, the time since the second vaccine inoculation at which the Ab titres were evaluated was significantly associated with a decline in serum SARS-CoV-2 Ab (Table 2).

        <p>Herein, we report that central obesity, independent of BMI is associated with lower Ab titres following a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. This could be due to a number of reasons, one of which is the metabolic derangements that often come with visceral adiposity, together with the immune dysfunction that has been reported in patients with obesity. 12,13 In fact, strong evidence supports the fact that obesity is also associated with poor seroconversion upon some vaccine administration, 14 together with increased risk of infection even when the seroconversion seems robust. 15 A recent study has shown that higher BMI is associated with lower Ab titres in response to COVID-19 vaccine in Italian healthcare workers. 16 Although pointing in the same direction, our findings slightly differ from this study, as we could not find any significant association between BMI and SARS-CoV-2 Ab titres following vaccination. This could be due to a narrower distribution in terms of BMI in our cohort, but it should also be highlighted that the kits to detect Ab titres were different, as was the timing of the Ab measurement (1 week). It is worth noting that Ab titres tend to rapidly decline following the vaccine with a kinetics not entirely elucidated yet and potentially different in some subpopulations. 17 Moreover, it is acknowledged that BMI poorly describes actual body fat excess, which is the definition of obesity according to the World Health Organization, 7 and a simple parameter such as waist circumference is shown to be even more associated to chronic low-grade inflammation and cardiovascular disease, morbidity, and mortality as opposed to BMI. 18 Indeed, we have recently shown that visceral fat is the strongest predictor of the need of intubation following COVID-19 infection, 1 suggesting that the same trend might apply to the vaccine response, where an accumulation in central fat may impact Ab levels, possibly hindering the response of these patients against an eventual subsequent infection. It is, therefore, of utmost importance to determine in future studies whether cell mediated immunity is maintained even when Ab titres decline in this population. It is worth noting that that when including DXA measured body fat as covariate in a multivariate analysis, the significant association between waist circumference and lower Ab titres was lost, suggesting that body fat may underlie the link. However, given that the effect size was only marginally improved by this addition, a definitive conclusion cannot be drawn.Herein, we report that central obesity, independent of BMI is associated with lower Ab titres following a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine.

        <p>It has been recently reported that elderly patients and those with cancer also develop lower Ab titres following the same mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. 24,25 These findings suggest that some, more vulnerable, subpopulations may respond in a different way to this vaccine. Whether this is linked to its nucleic acid nature or to the virus itself is yet to be elucidated, and studies comparing different types of vaccines are necessary.It has been recently reported that elderly patients and those with cancer also develop lower Ab titres following the same mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. 24,25 These findings suggest that some, more vulnerable, subpopulations may respond in a different way to this vaccine.

        <p>Our study has several limitations. First, the time of evaluation ranged between 1 and 4 weeks following the second vaccine inoculation, introducing time as a possible bias. However, when the evaluations were controlled for this factor, they still yielded the same results. Second, the sample size of our study population was relatively small, and patients with multiple comorbidities were underrepresented, possibly hindering some of the results. The primary aim of the present study was to investigate the link between the serological response following COVID-19 vaccination and adiposity parameters, with the assessment of a possible link with other cardiometabolic conditions and risk factors as a secondary aim.Our study has several limitations.

        <p>Further, the BMI range distribution was relatively narrow, although reflecting the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the general Italian population. 26 This could have hampered possible significant results regarding BMI differences. However, we collected other relevant adiposity parameters, such as DXA-derived body fat and waist and hip circumference, which showed a wide distribution within our study population. Due to the relatively young age and healthy lifestyle of our cohort of healthcare workers, DXA diagnosed sarcopenia was not a feature adequately represented to allow for investigation. It is however well established that sarcopenia represents a significant risk for higher morbidity and mortality, 27 against infection. However, neutralizing Ab titres correlate with protection against several viruses including SARS-CoV-2, 28,29 and the finding that central obesity, hypertension, and smoking are associated with lower Ab concentration shortly after the vaccination warrants further attention, as this may mean that these subjects respond in a different way to the same vaccination and may require different vaccine booster schedules over time.Further, the BMI range distribution was relatively narrow, although reflecting the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the general Italian population. 26 This could have hampered possible significant results regarding BMI differences.

        <p>Healthcare professionals were the first being vaccinated across all countries, so these are the earliest real-life findings becoming available. Waist circumference as a marker of central obesity does not require additional instrumental tests, it is cheap and easy to collect, and it therefore possesses a possible immediate clinical applicability. Clinical history was acquired with the means of a standardized structured interview allowing for a thorough and complete collection, and the adverse events were reported 3 days after the two vaccine inoculations, limiting the risk of recall bias.Healthcare professionals were the first being vaccinated across all countries, so these are the earliest real-life findings becoming available.

        <p>With the general population now being vaccinated, more and more subjects with central and general obesity will receive the vaccine, and very soon booster schedules will need to be planned. The fact that the Ab response is lower in certain subjects shortly after the second inoculation must lead to a highly vigilant approach, as medium and long-term data will become available only when the schedule will have been necessarily set already.With the general population now being vaccinated, more and more subjects with central and general obesity will receive the vaccine, and very soon booster schedules will need to be planned.
