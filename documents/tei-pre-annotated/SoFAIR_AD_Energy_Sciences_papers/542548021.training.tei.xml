        <p>Due to limited fossil fuel resources, a growing increase in energy demand and the need to maintain positive environmental effects, concentrating solar power (CSP) plant as a promising technology has driven the world to find new sustainable and competitive methods for energy production. The scheduling capability of a CSP plant equipped with thermal energy storage (TES) surpasses a photovoltaic (PV) unit and augments the sustainability of energy system performance. However, restricting CSP plant application compared to a PV plant due to its high investment is a challenging issue. This paper presents a model to assemble a combined heat and power (CHP) with a CSP plant for enhancing heat utilization and reduce the overall cost of the plant, thus, the CSP benefits proved by researches can be implemented more economically. Moreover, the compressed air energy storage (CAES) is used with a CSP-TES-CHP plant in order that the thermoelectric decoupling of the CHP be facilitated. Therefore, the virtual power plant (VPP) created is a suitable design for large power grids, which can trade heat and electricity in response to the market without restraint by thermoelectric constraint. Furthermore, the day-ahead offering strategy of the VPP is modeled as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem with the goal of maximizing the profit in the market. The simulation results prove the efficiency of the proposed model. The proposed VPP has a 2% increase in profit and a maximum 6% increase in the market electricity price per day compared to the system without CAES.Due to limited fossil fuel resources, a growing increase in energy demand and the need to maintain positive environmental effects, concentrating solar power (CSP) plant as a promising technology has driven the world to find new sustainable and competitive methods for energy production.

        <p>A significant percentage of electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels [1]. Due to the limited amount and high cost of fossil fuels, the need to reduce greenhouse gases emissions from fossil fuels burning and climate change, the intensified energy crisis, the increased energy consumption as a result of industrialization, urbanization and economic development in developing countries such as China in recent years, as well as rising electricity prices, investing in renewable energy is an option to ensure a secure and sustainable energy supply. Therefore, the attention of scientists around the world has been attracted to improving energy conversion techniques and increasing the efficiency and flexibility (using hybrid storage) of renewable production [2] steam (with an intermediate fluid such as molten salt) and drive the turbo generator [7]. The CSP power generation process, with an efficiency of about 40.5% [8], also generates exhaust steam with a low or medium temperature range. In addition, CSP stores fuel and thus eliminates environmental pollutant emissions. CSP is more efficient and less expensive than fuel consuming units such as diesel generator [9]. Also, compared to PV, their output power is smoother due to higher inertia and a 87% reduction in CO 2 emissions allows CSP to participate in the CO 2 emissions market and have minor impact on the environment. Unlike PV, CSP technology does not have the overheating problem and the complexity of its solutions, and therefore their use increases especially in hot areas. Since solar power has an inherent periodicity, it can be combined with other strategies to form a hybrid system, deal with the periodic nature and provide reliable energy, especially in island mode. These strategies include different energy storages such as batteries, compressed air energy storage (CAES), pump storage, thermal-compressed supercritical carbon dioxide storage, thermal storage, fuel cell vehicle, as well as phase change material (PCM) [10,11]. Due to the conversion of solar energy into thermal energy in CSP technology, storing energy as heat is the most common method in the application of this technology [1]. By integrating with CSP, thermal storage system (TES) enables it to produce full power capacity even in some hours without solar power, which provides flexible scheduling characteristics for CSP plant [12]. TES improves thermal comfort, reduces battery storage especially in island mode and makes smoother the heat load profiles by providing the ability of flexible supplement of electrical and thermal loads [13]. By adding combined heat and power (CHP) to CSP-TES, the strategy of generating electricity and heat simultaneously via the waste heat in exhaust steam, improves the energy resource utilization and thus make CSP investment profitable, given high initial investment cost of CSP [14,15]. As a result, improving the use of CSP as an energy resource help implement the CSP-TES-CHP energy system and exploit the CSP advantages proved in the previous relevant researches. Heat supply in addition to electricity using CSP-TES-CHP reduces the need for equipment such as gas boiler and thus decreases fuel consumption and air pollution. Moreover, by providing heat load (including temperature and hot water), the need for power-to-heat converter equipment that reduces process efficiency is eliminated [16]. Because high-efficiency CHP technology allows for the reduction of primary energy consumption and CO 2 emissions, the 2004/8/EC directive [17] has supported the use of CHP in European countries. Due to the intermittency and probability of CSP output, the system needs more flexibility to penetrate CSP energy. Systematic integration of hybrid power and heating systems to achieve their coordinated planning and performance concurrently, increases flexibility [18] and allows more CSP energy to penetrate [1]. CSP equipped with TES, alongside the CHP, forms a single complex called the virtual power plant (VPP). A VPP is like a power plant connected to the transmission system that consists of several distributed energy resources (DERs) and creates a single operational profile by combining the parameters of these DERs. VPP profile (similar to traditional power plants) is defined by a set of characteristics including scheduled generated power, constraints such as power rates, cost characteristics, as well as reserve. In addition to DERs, VPP can coordinate controllable loads using tools such as demand elasticity and electrical load recovery strategies to form a more flexible profile. Using this profile, the individual power plant can communicate directly with any market participant to make purchase/sale contracts, offer services (e.g. power balancing and ancillary services including frequency and voltage regulation) and decentralize the system management. The separate performance of each DER does not provide sufficient capacity and flexible controls to make an optimal system management and minimum cost in market participation, as well as feasible performance with respect to technical constraints [19], while these problems have been fixed by VPP. Because of the CSP output power with heterogeneous spatial distribution and daily intermittency and increased cost in the event of unforeseen changes in power [20], the optimal planning and performance scheduling of the integrated system is important to improve robustness and high-efficiency performance. For optimal performance scheduling in a VPP, an internal VPP energy management strategy that addresses the appropriate offering in the market [21] and also improves the cost of the VPP is essential. However, the thermoelectric constraint resulting from the high correlation between the electrical power and the heating steam volume of the CHP limits the electrical and thermal power of the VPP and reduces its profit in market participation [22]. As a result, how to improve system flexibility through thermoelectric decoupling is a necessity. CAES is based on the use of cheap electricity (during offpeak hours such as night or during high electricity generation hours) to compress air and store it in large tanks, then release compressed air at times of higher electricity demand to turn the turbine for electricity generation. The efficiency of the CAES storage process is up to about 54% (which is lower compared to pump storage) and has a long life (more than 20 years) [23]. Due to the need for huge amounts of air and as a result of economic constraints, only natural reservoirs (e.g. salt caves and limestone mines) are currently economical [23].A significant percentage of electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels [1].

        <p>There is a valuable literature in the field of using CSP technology and its participation in the competitive market, each of which has tried to reduce the effect of its power uncertainty, using exhaust steam, decouple thermoelectric constraint of electrical/thermal power generated or provide optimal offers in the market. The paper presented in [25] improves the performance of systems including solar sources in the presence of the probabilities of these sources and shows that the probabilities are effective in the performance and cost of the system. Due to the error in predicting solar radiation as a result of air pollution, Ref. [26] presents an modified ASHRAE model. In this model, the values of air temperature, humidity rate, air quality and relative humidity are specified as improving parameters. The results demonstrate that this model compared to the traditional ASHRAE model, improves the Nash sutcliffe equation by 27.17% and reduces the root mean square error by 55.99%. The results of the investigation in [27] prove that storing the surplus electricity can provide 100% renewable generation (including solar), increase energy security, reduce the power curtailment and increase the flexibility. Also, pump storage and fuel cell [28] joint with solar plants, has been proven for suppressing the solar plants variability. Furthermore, the integration of PV plants with wind turbine reduces the effects of solar power intermittence [29]. The addition of thermal power plants to the solar-wind complex has also improved this trend [30]. Similarly, Huang et al. [31] have proven that integrating hydropower with PV-wind improves their power uncertainties. Jurasz et al. [32] have demonstrated the use of hydropower in improving PV uncertainties, and the integrated set as a price taker in the market, makes more profit during market participation. But Refs. [31,32] do not consider the heating network and technologies of CSP, CHP, as well as CAES. The effect of integration of batteries, electric vehicles bidirectional charging station and commercial buildings with PV units has been investigated to decrease the impact of PV power probabilities and system costs in the framework presented in [33]. Moreover, the real-time control ability in this framework increases resilience to unpredictable conditions and electric vehicles owners participation. However, in the study conducted in Ref. [33], the high-efficiency technologies of CSP, CHP as well as the heating network are not considered. Yan et al. [1] examine the feasibility of using a TES for an island-based PV-wind turbine-electrical storage system in Hong Kong and suggests a new PCM with a Ba(OH) 2 .8H 2 O structure used to manage the system thermal power. But, CSP and CHP technologies as well as offering strategies in the market are not included in this model. The scheduling model proposed in Ref. [18] minimizes the cost of a PV-wind turbine-CHP system in which, due to the PV and wind turbine probabilities, the probabilistic spinning reserve is presented in the form of a chanceconstrained. The proposed model reduces the curtailment of PV and wind turbine resources, which are the result of the traditional heat-set modes of CHP, by improving the operation flexibility. Thermal comfort and buildings inertia are also included in thermal load modeling. Cocco et al. [34] prove that the combination of PV and TES with CSP plants can guarantee the provision of a constant value for the output power of the hybrid system over a longer period despite the uncertainties in solar power. In addition, the efficiency and capacity of CSP is increased. This strategy also eliminates the need for expensive battery banks by storing the thermal energy type to store solar power fluctuation. The techno-economic impact of TES and natural gas integrated into CSP for reducing the CSP output power probabilities effect is also investigated in [35]. Siqueira and Filho [36] present an innovative integrated system containing a landfill gas powered gas turbine and a solar thermal unit, which enhances the system power rating more than two times compared to a single gas turbine. Also, using the waste incineration and the syngas from waste gasification areas, overcomes the problem of high dependency of power production with the ratio between landfill area and solar radiation. However, CAES technology, thermoelectric decoupling and market are not modeled in this study. Keyif et al. [37] propose an optimization model to investigate the risk of investment costs of CSP plants in new market conditions (without governmental secure tariffs and subsidy for CSP plant life). This model uses the operational flexibility of invested CSP, TES and wind turbine, as well as economies of scale to minimum the investment cost. The results of [37] show that through new market conditions, due to the optimal configuration and more flexible performance of CSP, the net present value of CSP is augmented. But this model does not consider the technology of CHP and CAES, as well as the thermoelectric decoupling concept. The CSP-TES-electric heater system coordinated with a wind farm in [38], copes with the variability and studies self-scheduling for maximizing the profit of the ancillary services market participation. Also, the authors in [39], integrate an electric heater into a CSP-TESwind unit to save the power of wind unit in TES (to save energy in thermal type). This model reduces the generation plan deviation and wind curtailment by 15.75% and 100%. Ref. [15] use a CHP (BT) unit integrated with CSP-TES to increase system efficiency by waste heat utilization. The presented combined heat and power scheduling provides both electrical and thermal loads simultaneously. To consider the uncertainties in performance scheduling, the information decision gap theory is involved in this model. The authors in [14] use a BT unit to exploit the waste heat of a CSP-TES system, while an energy storage buildings equipped with PCMs is used into facilitate thermoelectric decoupling. The heating and cooling storage quantity of PCMs enhances the conventional thermal power plants operational economy and heat generation units. This mode of operation is used in isolated CSP-CHP plants (commonly used in remote areas) and leads to lower cost and improved potential, however, it has not paid attention to market participation and large scale systems. Due to the importance of PCMs, Ref. [11] increases the heat absorption efficiency of PCM by constructing heat transfer networks mimicking leaf veins. Thus, the heat absorption efficiency is increased to 196.67% compared to metal foam enhanced PCM plate. In addition to providing thermal load, the waste heat in exhaust steam generated in CSP technology can also feed desalination units in a combined CSP-wind turbinedesalination system [9] to produce fresh water and improve the use of energy resources. As a result, in addition to improving overall energy utilization, part of the electricity demand for desalination is effectively transferred to the thermal load and the electricity demand is reduced. However, this method does not use high-efficiency CHP technology for using the exhaust steam. VPP is researched in [19] to determine its ability to improve the performance of aggregated DERs in both system management and market participation. This paper presents decentralized energy management frameworks and market participation of DERs using the aggregation of DERs in a VPP to demonstrate the impact of its key features on the optimal management of DERs. Also, risk management and qualifying the capabilities of aggregated DERs for optimizing their operating costs are shown. The model presented in [40] provides day-ahead scheduling and optimal bidding strategies for a CSP participating in the day-ahead market. Furthermore, the probabilities of price market and CSP power are taken account. A molten salt thermal storage is used for providing electricity production even during hours without solar radiation to increase CSP penetration. However, it has not used CHP for using the waste heat, thus, the maximum overall energy utilization is not achieved. In addition to modeling CSP-TES offering strategy in the energy market, its participation in the ancillary services market (including the reserve and regulation market) is also considered in [41]. In Ref. [42], the authors present a bi-level model for energy management of DERs, in which at the lower level the DERs optimal decentralized dispatch are specified and at the upper level, the electricity surplus/shortage of each section is sent to a central unit. But these references do not pay attention to CSP technology. The model presented in Ref. [43] provides the ability of optimal dayahead scheduling for multi-energy DERs of VPP and optimal offering for purchasing/selling in the energy market, however, CSP technology is not paid attention. The authors in [44] have shown that the storage flexibility used in an integrated set participating in a competitive market allows for better offering. But in this paper, the heating network is not considered. In addition to not paying attention to the market clearing price process, the technologies of CSP, CHP and CAES, as well as the VPP concept have not been studied. Zeynali et al. [45] propose a bi-level offering strategy for an integrated system containing plugin hybrid electric vehicles and wind units in the day-ahead wholesale market, which decreases the cost and pollutants emissions up to 4.4% and 40%, respectively. In the upper level, which minimizes the integrated system cost/emissions, the plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are aggregated into the distinct fleets using k-means clustering. Also, the uncertainties of drivers behaviors and wind power are modeled using a scenario-based method and a robust method, respectively. The lower level implements the market clearing process, while the social welfare is maximized. However, the technologies of CSP, CHP and CAES as well as thermoelectric decoupling are not investigated. The hybrid energy storage system, including thermochemical technology (using Cobalt monoxide) and CAES in Ref. [46], increases round-trip efficiency and total exergy efficiency to 56.4% and 75.6%, respectively. Despite the many advantages of CAES in storage applications, only two high power CAESs are currently exploited: (1) McIntosh (with the capacity of 110 MW) installed in Alabama, USA, as well as (2) Huntorf (with the capacity of 321 MW) installed in Germany [24].There is a valuable literature in the field of using CSP technology and its participation in the competitive market, each of which has tried to reduce the effect of its power uncertainty, using exhaust steam, decouple thermoelectric constraint of electrical/thermal power generated or provide optimal offers in the market.

        <p>Fig. 1 illustrates the CSP-CHP plant schematic. The CSP-CHP plant is made of a CSP, TES, thermal cycling system and back pressure combined heat and power turbine (BT). The molten salt is mainly used to transfer energy in the CSP plant. The heat transfer fluid guarantees energy transfer in the above subsystems. The heat transfer medium absorbs the energy from the solar field and its temperature rises to 520 • C-560 • C. During the molten salt transfer process, the CSP-CHP plant operator stores some of the heat in the TES and transfer the rest of heat to the thermal cycling unit (Eq. ( 1)). This second part of heat is for producing superheated steam through a 3 stage heat exchange in order to increase the efficiency of heat transfer from molten salt to water for producing steam. After the heat exchange, the molten salt temperature drops to 280 • C-320 • C and the molten salt returns to the solar field. The steam at a temperature of 535 • C is transferred to the BT for generating electricity at the determined BT efficiency (Eq. ( 1)). Concurrently, the high-temperature exhaust steam generated by BT can be used for supplying the heat demand of industrial part or providing heating for residential part (in the steam-water heat exchanger). Therefore, by optimal use of energy resources, industrial and domestic use of energy is supplied economically. Even the superfluous thermal energy is used by the absorption refrigeration systems for the cooling supply, if there is no thermal load in summer. The steam also returns to the thermal cycling system after losing heat in the BT and passing through the condenser to reach the preset temperature, and the cycle continues.Fig. 1 illustrates the CSP-CHP plant schematic.

        <p>There is a highly correlation between the CSP-CHP plant power generation and the heating steam volume, which can be solved effectively by implementing CAES alongside the CSP-CHP plant. CAES is an emerging "Bulk Energy Storage" technology where typically generated energy is stored during off-peak periods and dispatched to the electric grid during peak demand periods. CAES is used to separate electricity and heat produced by CSP-CHP and reducing the interaction between the electricity-thermal market, while maximizing electric and heat profit of the VPP. Therefore, CAES is operable in two modes, (a) Charging, in which air undergoes compression through the use of power from the CSP-CHP or the electricity market, (b) Discharging, in which the air that has been stored in the earlier mode (charging) is utilized for powering the gas turbine and selling it to the electricity market. At the same time, CAES can purchase electricity from the electricity market when the electricity price is relatively low and sell it when electricity price is relatively high. CAES is a receiver of power for air compression in underground salt cavities. It utilizes the compressed air as an air expander for generating electricity. Although CAES, like TES, can improve power supply during hours without solar radiation, it should be noted that the purpose of using CAES is to decouple the thermoelectric constraint of electricity and heat output of CSP-TES-CHP (which are interdependent with a thermoelectric ratio). As a result, electricity and heat at the VPP output can be changed independently, and the VPP operator determines their value based on the price of electricity and heat. While the molten salt TES used in the CSP-TES-CHP, is not able to decouple the thermoelectric constraint. The CSP-CHP plant and CAES complex can be considered as a single VPP. Based on the European project FENIX [47], the quantity of DERs capacity can be aggregated by VPP. Then, an operating power profile from combining the parameters corresponding to each DER is created and VPP can consider the network effect on aggregated DER power. The VPP internal power and thermal flow is shown in Fig. 2. Determining the optimal bidding strategy in the market (in the form of a proposal with a dual parameter of price and amount of energy) is necessary for the VPP operator to maximize VPP profit through participating in the markets. A bi-level optimization model is proposed for the day-ahead offering strategy of the VPP, which aims at profit maximization (Eqs. ( 33)-( 40)). Furthermore, the VPP operator must pay attention to the VPP constraints that result from the combination of constraints of the CSP-CHP plant and CAES (Eqs. ( 23)-( 32)). Fig. 2 shows that part of the CSP-CHP plant power (𝑃 BT,net 𝑡 ) is sold directly to the market by the VPP operator and part of (𝑃 BT,CAES 𝑡 ) is stored in the VPP's internal CAES (Eq.

        <p>In order to consider both the profit of a VPP and the clearing of the electricity market, a bi-level optimization model has been elaborated in order to optimally offer strategies for the VPP, as shown in Fig. 3. Here, it is assumed that in all power plants participating in the market, the proposed model from the point of view of VPP i (the VPP under study) deals via optimal bidding in the market to maximize its profit. The input data of the proposed model is the value of the parameters related to the CSP, TES, BT unit, CAES and other plants and loads (Tables 23). The upper level takes the VPP's profit maximization as the optimization goal (Eq. ( 33)), while considering the VPP operation constraints (Eqs. ( 23)-( 32)). In addition, the bidding strategy of the VPP participating in the electricity and heat market is determined (including the price and amount of energy offered to ISO), then passed to the lower level. The lower level receives the VPP i bidding for each time-step of the next day. Moreover, it receives bidding of other power plants and loads. The lower level is used as the constraint of the upper level, and the market focuses on maximizing social welfare, as an objective function (Eq. ( 34)). Furthermore, the constraints existing in the market clearing (Eqs. ( 35)-( 40)) must be met. The lower level has an impact on the operating schedule of the upper level by returning the clearing price of the market to the upper level. The day before market clearing price is the dual variable of the node power balance equation in the lower layer problem.

Fig. 4 shows the VPP i whose profit is maximized at the upper level of the proposed model, is associated with both the electricity and heat markets, and its internal structure is as shown in Fig. 2. To consider the uncertainty of probabilistic parameters including solar radiation and electrical and thermal loads, the backward scenario reduction algorithm is applied to the values of previous years of solar radiation (extracted form [54]) and electrical and thermal loads [14]. The result of this algorithm is four scenarios for spring (S1), summer (S2), autumn (s3), as well as winter (S4), which are shown in Figs. 5 and6. The backward scenario reduction algorithm [55] also maintains the effect of the deleted scenarios, and as a result, the proposed model considers the risk of probabilistic parameters for each of the possible network conditions during the year and obtains the optimal result for each of these conditions. Moreover, reducing the number of scenarios with this algorithm increases the computing speed and also reduces the required computing volume. As mentioned, the amount of CSP output power in each scenario is as illustrated in Fig. 5. Also, the installed CSP capacity is 100 MW. The electrical and thermal loads in each of the scenarios are shown in Fig. 6 (the thermal load is the same in the spring and autumn scenarios). The electrical and thermal load for each of the other market participants shown in Fig. 4, is assumed to be similar to Fig. 6. It is assumed that each participant in the competitive market can offer a price between 0 to 200 $/MWh. Moreover, the low/up limit of power offering for generators and loads participating in the market (as shown in Fig. 4) is 0 and 150 MW, respectively. In addition to generating power, the considered VPP that the upper level is implemented from its stand point, also has power consumption.The power system used in this study includes twelve different rival generations and twelve load consumptions.

        <p>A MILP solver (
            <rs type="software">CPLEX</rs>) is used in this paper for solving the VPP dayahead scheduling. The scheduling cycle is 1 day, and each time-step is selected 1 h.
        </p>
        <p>In order to present the superiority of the VPP composed of CSP-CHP and CAES, two modes of energy supply are considered, as shown in Table 4. In mode 1, the CSP-CHP plant and CAES as a single VPP is participated in the electricity market, moreover, the heat production of CSP-CHP plant is participated in the heat market. Besides, in mode 2 there is only the CSP-CHP plant, which participates in the electricity and heat market at the same time. Therefore, thermoelectric decoupling of CSP-CHP plant output power is not performed. In mode 1 compared to mode 2, the VPP operator optimizes the power and profit of the entire CSP-CHP plant and CAES suite, while in mode 2, only the CSP-CHP plant power scheduling is performed.In order to present the superiority of the VPP composed of CSP-CHP and CAES, two modes of energy supply are considered, as shown in Table 4.

        <p>Fig. 7 shows the results of the VPP optimal strategy in next 24 h for a typical winter day. It is noted that the power generation of the VPP has a great correlation with the system marginal electricity price, which is shown by the black curve in Fig. 10. At high electricity prices (e.g. 06:00-10:00 and 17:00-22:00), the VPP tends to sell more electricity and maximize its own profit, while at lower electricity prices (e.g. 00:00-05:00, 15:00-17:00, and 23:00-24:00), the VPP tends to generate less electricity or even buy electricity from the electricity market. The stored electrical energy in CAES is used to resell to the market during peak electricity prices. As a result, the price difference between electricity purchased and sold to the market increases the VPP operator profit. It should be noted that in this power exchange, the VPP load (marked in yellow in Fig. 7) must be fully supplied. Therefore, the power scheduling of the VPP in the upper level of the proposed model (Section 2.3), after determining the power and its price for the VPP in the lower level, leads to the powers of Fig. 7 for the internal In terms of heat generation, the CAES part in the VPP can decouple electricity and heat of the CSP-CHP plant as much as possible. For example, Fig. 7 shows at 16:00, the electrical power generation of the VPP is zero, but the heat generation is still high, indicating that electrical power generation of CSP-CHP plant is received by CAES.Fig. 7 shows the results of the VPP optimal strategy in next 24 h for a typical winter day.

        <p>The resulting CSP-CHP plant optimal strategy in mode 2 in the next 24 h is illustrated in Fig. 9. In mode 2, power generation does not exactly change with the electricity price (Fig. 10), as in mode 1 (Fig. 7). In addition, the relationship between heat and electricity generation in Fig. 9 has always been the thermoelectricity ratio of BT, due to the lack of CAES in mode 2. The reason being that the electricity and heat of the CSP-CHP plant is strongly coupled, and the optimal scheduling of CSP-CHP plant must consider both electricity and heat prices. Moreover, it is not possible to schedule the electrical power in a completely coordinated manner with the price of electricity. As a result, the freedom to schedule the power of the component in this mode is less and, therefore, its profit is less compared to the VPP (which uses CAES for thermoelectric decoupling), as shown in Table 5. The powers of Fig. 9, like Fig. 7, are determined in the upper level after the power and price of the CSP-CHP plant are determined in lower level (Section 2.3). Fig. 8 shows the TES energy changes. During the period of 06:00-10:00, when the electricity price is high and as a result, the CSP-TES-CHP generation is high, the energy stores in CAES is reduced. But during hours such as 15:00-17:00 when the electricity price and CSP-TES-CHP generation is low and the production of solar field increases at the same time, the energy level of TES increases. TES stores the energy when the loads amount is low and the solar radiation is high to supply loads during the hours without solar radiation. Thus, it augments the sustainability of energy system. As shown in Fig. 8, in Mode 2, the TES energy level is lower in the middle of the day, because of generating more power by CSP-TES-CHP (its power changes are not optimal and are also affected by the price of heat) and lacking CAES to provide some of power consumption.The resulting CSP-CHP plant optimal strategy in mode 2 in the next 24 h is illustrated in Fig. 9.

        <p>Due to the similarity of the results in each of the different scenarios (although the numbers vary in different scenarios of the year, but the results obtained by comparing them are similar) and also to avoid the complexity of the figures, only the winter scenario results are shown. Because in winter, there is the least solar radiation (Fig. 5) and the highest thermal load (Fig. 6) and it is the most critical scenario. Other weather-related conditions, such as cloudy weather with less solar radiation, can also be considered. The proposed model, due to the fact that the CSP-TES-CHP unit is connected to the electricity and heat market, can balance the power even for this case. But due to the lower CSP power generation, more power will be purchased from the market and the ability of CSP-TES-CHP to offer power in the market will be less. As a result, the profit of CSP-TES-CHP will be less compared to Table 5.Due to the similarity of the results in each of the different scenarios (although the numbers vary in different scenarios of the year, but the results obtained by comparing them are similar) and also to avoid the complexity of the figures, only the winter scenario results are shown.

        <p>Since electricity and heat can be decoupled in mode 1, the electricity price of the VPP is higher than mode 2, as shown in Fig. 10. Consequently, the VPP is making more profit than mode 2, which has not used CAES (Table 5). In both modes, the heat price remains the same but the electricity price is different indicating that in mode 1, the charge and discharge of CAES is used to control the electricity generated by the VPP to obtain a higher electricity price.Since electricity and heat can be decoupled in mode 1, the electricity price of the VPP is higher than mode 2, as shown in Fig. 10.

        <p>In mode 2, the price of electricity is lower than mode 1 (Fig. 10), due to the limitation in power scheduling as a result of coupled electricity and heat generation, which is mentioned in part A of Section 4.3.In mode 2, the price of electricity is lower than mode 1 (Fig. 10), due to the limitation in power scheduling as a result of coupled electricity and heat generation, which is mentioned in part A of Section 4.3.</p>
        <p>As shown in Table 5, the profit gain in mode 1 is higher than mode 2, indicating that mode 1 proposed in this paper has better economies of scale and schedulability. Since better scheduling capability makes the power of component inside the VPP according to the market electricity price, and with an aim of maximizing the VPP profit. But in mode 2, in addition to the electricity price, the heat price has also impacts on the component power. It is a constraint, which provides a lower profit maximization than mode 1 (part A in Section 4.3). Therefore, according to Fig. 7 and Table 5, CAES used in VPP makes an innovative system which creates this ability for the proposed model to use the energy sources more economically, while their technical constraints are also considered. As a result, the proposed model shows that implementation of VPP based on CAES has economical advantages, while it has also environmental advantages which are achieved using CSP and CHP, as it is explained in Section 1.1.As shown in Table 5, the profit gain in mode 1 is higher than mode 2, indicating that mode 1 proposed in this paper has better economies of scale and schedulability.
