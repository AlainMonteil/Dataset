        <p>It is surely clear that such analysis must be based on a dynamic approach to the economics of public policy, set in a complex and uncertain world. Policies focused on change are of the essence; and the analysis must be grounded in and reflect a world where there are many market imperfections, where there are increasing returns to scale, where risk is central, and where the distribution of income and welfare is a crucial issue. And where time is of the essence; urgency is intense. This is an economics of public policy which is rather different from the bulk of work in economics in this area, but it is, in my view, an economics forced by the logic of the problem.It is surely clear that such analysis must be based on a dynamic approach to the economics of public policy, set in a complex and uncertain world.

There is so much in the richness of our subject that we can and must put to work. But there is more that we must create. The task requires expertise ranging across the entirety of our subject and, indeed, collaboration with other disciplines. And an engagement by our profession in a way beyond what we have seen so far.

        <p>We must start with the science. 1 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been in existence since 1988 and has produced a series of assessment reports, published every few years, about the current state of knowledge on climate change. Each one of those assessments has been more worrying than the last. The first one, published in 1990, was extremely worrying, but the outlook has only worsened as the evidence has become ever stronger of effects coming through more quickly and with greater intensity than we expected. The latest report (the Sixth Assessment Report) published in August 2021 has demonstrated even more clearly that we are under intense time pressure if we are to be able to hold temperatures at levels which manage the most extreme risks (IPCC, 2021).We must start with the science. 1 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been in existence since 1988 and has produced a series of assessment reports, published every few years, about the current state of knowledge on climate change.

        <p>Global mean surface temperature is already 1.1 • C above that of the end of the nineteenth century, our usual benchmark. This puts us on the edge of the temperature of the Holocene epoch; the benign period starting 10,000-12,000 years ago, during which our current civilisations emerged, following the end of the last ice age. It was during this period of fairly stable climate and temperature that many human cultures transitioned to a lifestyle based on sedentary agriculture. This is when we turned grasses into grains and stayed in one place as we nurtured crops until harvests; we built villages; we generated surpluses and used storage, thus creating opportunities for activities and services outside agriculture. With 1.1 • C of temperature rise, on the borderline of the temperatures of that period, we are already seeing very intense effects: fires associated with heat and drought; severe flooding; hurricanes and typhoons; storm surges; sea level rises; local temperatures at levels dangerous to human life, and so on. In the summer of 2021, northern California and western Canada experienced temperatures close to 50 • C, unprecedented and causing extensive loss of life and severe wildfires. And flooding, on a scale never previously experienced, occurred from Germany to China. There could be much worse to come. Our current emissions pathway implies that we are headed for temperature increases of more than 3 • C (UNEP, 2020). 2 The science is clear that such temperatures could carry grave risks to humankind and the planet as a whole. As a world, we have not seen 3 • C or more for around 3 million years, and at that time sea levels were 10 to 20 metres higher than now. The range of extreme climate impacts from sea levels to droughts to hurricanes/cyclones to floods to intense heat and beyond would radically change lives and livelihoods across the globe. Many parts of the world could become uninhabitable. Under a business-as-usual scenario, one of the most densely populated regions in the world, the North China Plain, would likely experience deadly heatwaves later this century with 'wet-bulb' temperature exceeding the threshold defining what people can tolerate while working outdoors ( Kang and Eltahir, 2018). Similar heatwaves could also occur in other densely populated parts of the world, such as north India. Hundreds of millions, possibly billions, would have to move, 3 likely resulting in severe and extended conflict. It is quite possible on current paths that we could see 4 or 5 • C of temperature rise 150 years or so from now; temperatures which the world has not seen for tens of millions of years. That would be absolutely devastating. The stakes we are playing for are immense.Global mean surface temperature is already 1.1 • C above that of the end of the nineteenth century, our usual benchmark.

        <p>So, what do we have to do? To stabilise temperatures, we have to stabilise the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. 4 To stabilise the concentrations of greenhouse gases, the flow of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere must be net zero. The earlier we stabilise the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, that is, the earlier we go to net zero, the lower the temperature at which we stabilise. One can fine-tune the climate science, and the path to net zero matters, but that is the underlying, basic physics and the logic of the net zero target. If we want to stabilise at 1.5 • C (see below), we have to go to net zero CO 2 by mid-century. Figure 1 shows the emissions pathways (in terms of CO 2 equivalent, where the warming effect 2 Following plans and commitments associated with UNFCCC COP26 in Glasgow, November 2021, we may be, if they are delivered, headed in a direction of a little above 2 • C of warming.

        <p>3 Empirical estimates range substantially, from 50 million to 1 billion migrants associated with the effects of climate change during this century (Ferris, 2020). We should remember that we have been forced consistently over the last few decades to bring forward in time our estimates of when serious impacts can occur and revise estimates of their magnitudes upwards. And most models do not embody the tipping points that we think may occur at higher temperature which could generate dangerous feedback loans (e.g., collapse of Amazon forest, thawing of permafrost, melting of polar ice sheets). Thus the numbers having to move could be badly underestimated in these analyses. 4 Greenhouse gases are those whose molecules oscillate at a frequency that interferes with the infra-red energy reflected from the earth's surface, thus preventing its escape and causing warming.

        <p>It is important to note that the NDC scenarios (unconditional and conditional) shown in Figure 1 estimate the levels of GHG emissions projected as a result of the implementation of the mitigation actions pledged by countries in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) (UNEP, 2020).

        <p>The differences between 1.5 • C and 2 • C are major. For example, the percentage of the global population exposed to severe heat at least once every 5 years would be 14% with 1.5 • C of temperature rise, but 37% with 2 • C of temperature rise (Dosio et al., 2018). That is, the risk of being exposed to extreme heat every 5 years would be more than double for 2 • C versus 1.5 • C. Thus, when we consider the risks in a consequentialist way, the 2 • C which we had earlier seen as dangerous to exceed, now itself seems very dangerous. That was the key lesson of the powerful and important IPCC report on 1.5 • C of 2018, showing that the risks and dangers are still more serious than estimated previously. An examination of the risks in terms of potential consequences for humans and the planet as a whole suggests that it makes a lot of sense to try to hold the temperature rise down to 1.5 • C. And it is an achievable goal if we move strongly and quickly. Further, we will argue that such a path can carry many 'co-benefits' beyond the reduced risks from climate change. It can be a much more attractive form of development.The differences between 1.5 • C and 2 • C are major.

        <p>We can think of setting a temperature target as a 'guard-rail' approach to extreme risk. That approach is a standard, indeed widely and understandably regarded as sensible, approach to great risks, particularly around human life. It is clearly a consequentialist approach, although not necessarily one arising from simple, indeed simplistic, optimisation of some standard welfare function from an underlying model. In my view, the risks, including the possibility of the loss of 2022] a time for change in economics 1263 life of billions, extended and severe conflict, destroyed biodiversity, and profound loss of quality of life, livelihoods and well-being, are not well captured in narrow utility-based approaches. Neither the standard objective functions in economics, nor indeed the underlying models, capture the challenges at issue. Here, the governments and the people of the world, after thinking it through, and taking account of the feasibility, costs and attractiveness of paths that could achieve different targets, came to the targets in the Paris agreement at COP21 of the UNFCCC in December 2015, of holding temperature increases 'well below 2 • C', with best efforts to 1.5 • C. The IPCC report of 2018 on 1.5 • C further underlined the importance of that target and pointed still more strongly towards a target of 1.5 • C. We should see the 1.5 • C target as a balanced and consequentialist approach to immense risk. We can, of course, rig up expected utility models that give that conclusion but, in my view, they do not add significantly to the argument, particularly since such models are so sensitive to specification of structure, functional forms and parameters. Fairly modest model tweaks can give rather different results. I will expand on the flaws of these models in Subsection 6.2.We can think of setting a temperature target as a 'guard-rail' approach to extreme risk.

        <p>In a world of 4 or 5 • C temperature rise, we risk loss of life in the hundreds of millions or billions, because we do not know what the 'carrying capacity' of that world might be. It could be much lower than the 9-10 billion or so expected towards the end of the century. It is hard to understand or put numbers on the potential devastation and agony around the process of loss of life that could be involved. It is difficult, in particular, to argue that an expected utility approach captures the issues at stake in a plausible way. In my view, a direct risk assessment looking across possible consequences and a guard-rail approach is more thoughtful, reasoned, broad-ranging and robust. And it is clearly seen as a reasonable and rational approach by large parts of the body-politic.In a world of 4 or 5 • C temperature rise, we risk loss of life in the hundreds of millions or billions, because we do not know what the 'carrying capacity' of that world might be.

        <p>We know what kind of emissions paths we have to follow to achieve our target, i.e., holding warming to 1.5 • C. But emissions are currently way off track for such paths. Global greenhouse gas emissions rose in 2019 for the third consecutive year, reaching a record high of 59.1 GtCO 2 e (including land use change) (UNEP, 2020). Although annual emissions decreased sharply in 2020 due to the global response to the COVID pandemic, global energy-related CO 2 emissions are projected to rebound and grow by 4.8% in 2021 (IEA, 2021a). Returning to Figure 1, we can see that, for 1.5 • C, world emissions must start turning down now and continue to drop sharply. To get from current levels of close to 60 GtCO 2 e a year, down to net zero by mid-century, we have to change fundamentally the way we do things. And we have to do that everywhere, across all sectors, across all countries. We cannot be confident that there will be net negatives in large quantities,5 so we must strive for net zero across the board.We know what kind of emissions paths we have to follow to achieve our target, i.e., holding warming to 1.5 • C.

        <p>The next decade is critical. Choices made on infrastructure and capital now will either lock us in to high emissions, or set us on a low-carbon growth path which can be sustainable and inclusive. In the next 15-20 years infrastructure will roughly double; in the next 20-25 years the world economy will probably double; and in the next 40 years the urban population will likely double. If that new infrastructure, the new world economy, or the towns and cities we build look anything like the old, we will have no hope of meeting the objectives of the Paris Agreement.The next decade is critical.

        <p>The necessary rapid change across the whole system, just described, can be a story of growth, indeed the only sustainable story of growth. In the shorter term, the necessary investments can boost demand in a world where planned savings exceed planned investments (with sluggish demand and low real interest rates). In the short and medium term it is an approach full of innovation, investment, discovery and new ways of doing things. It can be more efficient and much cleaner. It can create cities where we can move and breathe, and ecosystems which are robust and fruitful. It is potentially a very attractive, different way of doing things, relative to past dirty models, with so many gains across the different dimensions of well-being. But that does not mean that it is easy. It does mean that it is sensible, it does mean that it is attractive, and it is within our grasp. We have to change radically and, particularly, invest and innovate strongly to get there. That is the challenge. But there can be a real payoff in terms of a much better form of growth. We must also remember that there is unlikely to be a long-run growth story that is high carbon; it would likely create, the IPCC reports show, a physical environment so hostile as to derail growth and undermine living standards across the board.The necessary rapid change across the whole system, just described, can be a story of growth, indeed the only sustainable story of growth.

        <p>Can it be done? The answer is 'yes' and in particular there are four forces at this current moment which are particularly favourable to moving quickly and on scale: low interest rates, rapid technological change (see Subsection 2.4), international understandings coming together (including the UNFCCC, COP21, the Paris Agreement of 2015 and more than 100 countries covering 61% of emissions committing to net zero by mid-century; Black et al., 2021), and pressure from the young people of the world to change (for example, Fridays for the Future and strong activity in the universities of the world). Further, at COP26 in Glasgow in November 2021, we saw further progress, particularly around new targets set for themselves by private financial institutions, agreements on technologies, and new strategies from key countries (including India, South Africa and Vietnam).Can it be done?

        <p>Technology has changed very rapidly over the last 15 years or so. A whole range of low-emission technologies, that are already competitive with fossil fuel-based technologies without subsidy or a carbon price, have emerged. Capital costs for renewable electricity continue to fall much faster than those for conventional technologies and many electric vehicle technologies are now close to cost-competitive with their fossil fuel counterparts (see Figures 2 and3). Electric vehicles are expected to reach sticker price parity with internal combustion engine vehicles by 2024, as lithium-ion battery prices continue to fall (ETC, 2021), and they have big relative advantages on running and operating costs.Technology has changed very rapidly over the last 15 years or so. A whole range of low-emission technologies, that are already competitive with fossil fuel-based technologies without subsidy or a carbon price, have emerged.

        <p>The pace of these advances in technology and reductions in cost has been much faster than expected. For example, since 2001, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has consistently underestimated the rate at which the cost of solar photovoltaic (PV) would subsequently fall, in its World Energy Output (WEO) reports (Ives et al., 2021) new technologies in the power sector have already passed tipping points and others seem to be approaching them (Systemiq, 2021).The pace of these advances in technology and reductions in cost has been much faster than expected.

        <p>With falling costs of clean technologies, estimates of the 'cost' of the transition to net zero have been consistently reduced. The United Kingdom's Climate Change Committee (CCC) has been producing estimates of the investments, costs and resource savings associated with the United Kingdom's pathway to net zero. Their 2020 analysis suggests that the annualised resource cost6 of reducing GHG emissions to net zero would be approximately 0.5% of GDP in 2050 (CCC, 2020). This is lower than the estimate the CCC produced in 2019, which put the annual cost of meeting the net zero by 2050 target at 1-2% of GDP in 2050. Further, the estimate they produced in 2008 put the annual cost of meeting a much weaker target, reducing emissions by 80% by 2050 (relative to 1990), at a similar 1-2% of GDP in 2050 (CCC, 2019). At the time of the Stern Review (Stern 2006) we estimated costs of 1-2% GDP per annum for reducing emissions (globally) by 80% (comparing 1990 and 2050). It has been argued that, even with that target, the last few percent would be particularly costly; that is embodied, indeed forced by assumption, in the modelling of many integrated assessment models (IAMs). Now we have estimates (in the case of the United Kingdom) below 1% of GDP for going to net zero emissions by 2050. The changes in estimates reflect real changes in costs and fairly modest assumptions (in relation to experience) of future cost changes-technical progress continues rapidly. There are strong economies of scale in production and discovery, which, with clarity in policy direction, will drive change; that observation is crucial because many IAMs have diminishing returns and increasing marginal costs to climate action, and that assumption is key to many of their results.With falling costs of clean technologies, estimates of the 'cost' of the transition to net zero have been consistently reduced.

        <p>We should note that the averaging of costs can conceal the strong upfront nature of the necessary investment. At the same time, we should also observe that the language of investment is in some ways a better description than the narrow term 'cost'. 'Investment' reflects a more dynamic approach. Many of these investments will have powerful returns in productivity and efficiency, 2022] a time for change in economics 1267 reduction of air pollution and so on as well as emissions reductions. We should nevertheless be clear that such investments will be substantial. Low-carbon technologies are already competitive with fossil fuel-based alternatives in the power sector without carbon price or subsidy. In 2020, solar/wind was the cheapest form of new power generation 7 in countries representing over 70% of world GDP (Systemiq, 2020). And renewable energy technologies are expected to continue to decline in cost. Reductions in upfront capital costs will be driven by innovations around efficiency and new methods, more competitive global supply chains and economies of scale, while reductions in total levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) generation will be driven by increasing capacity factors and declining operational and financing costs (ETC, 2021). Low-carbon solutions could scale rapidly, become competitive, and push down emissions in sectors accounting for 90% of emissions by 2030 (Systemiq, 2021). This analysis indicates the possibility of tipping points in the adoption of new technologies, where the rise of the new technology is accelerating and moving in the direction of dominance. These possibilities were at the core of the Glasgow Breakthrough agreements on technology at COP26.We should note that the averaging of costs can conceal the strong upfront nature of the necessary investment.

        <p>In the building sector, for example, reversible heat pumps are already at cost parity with a gas boiler plus air conditioning in some geographies. If the falling cost of this technology is coupled with incentives, it could achieve cost parity with the fossil fuel alternative by 2025 (Systemiq, 2021). In the food and agriculture sector, it is estimated that plant-based 'meats' could reach price parity with existing proteins between 2023and 2025and cultured meat by 2030-2 (CE Delft, 2021;Morach et al., 2021).

        <p>Further, there are immense benefits beyond the fundamental contribution of radically reducing the risks of climate change. As we have noted, these include cities where we can move and breathe and be more productive, and ecosystems which are robust and fruitful. We can find, and are finding, great advances in resource (including energy) efficiency. And, crucially, we can strongly reduce deaths and damage to health from air and other pollution-around 15% of world deaths in 2018 were linked to air pollution associated with the burning of fossil fuels (Vohra et al., 2021).Further, there are immense benefits beyond the fundamental contribution of radically reducing the risks of climate change.

        <p>We are at a very special moment in history, facing two crises: the COVID crisis that we are experiencing right now (December 2021) and the climate crisis, which embodies risks and challenges that are bigger, deeper and longer lasting even than the tragic COVID crisis.

        <p>The COVID crisis has underlined the dangers, weaknesses and fragilities that had been building in the world economy. Broadly speaking, the economic and social conditions across the world during the decade before the COVID pandemic were troubling. Growth rates and investment rates plunged across the world during the global financial crisis (2007-9) and, for the most part, had not, in the second decade of this century up to COVID, recovered to the levels of 2000.8 This pattern of lower investment rates (see Figure 5) and lower growth (see Figure 6) was important background to the challenges of social cohesion and populism (Tabellini, 2019), which emerged during the 2010s. There was also some faltering, particularly under President Trump, of internationalism. This was in addition to rising emissions and severe loss of biodiversity (Dasgupta, 2021). Despite these challenges in the decade prior to COVID, there was growing momentum towards a more sustainable economy. There had been major advances in international commitment and agreement (e.g., the Paris Agreement and adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015); improved understanding of a new sustainable, inclusive and resilient approach to growth and development (Stern, 2015;NCE, 2018;OECD, 2018); growing commitment to net zero emissions by the private sector (Black et al., 2021); and engagement by economic policymakers (e.g., via the Network on Greening the Financial System-central banks-and the Coalition of Finance Ministers on Climate Action).The COVID crisis has underlined the dangers, weaknesses and fragilities that had been building in the world economy.

        <p>Tackling the two crises-COVID and climate change-requires a new and shared understanding of how to reconstruct our economies and societies and the meaning of 'build back better'. Rebuilding in a different way will involve substantial investment and innovation; and the global nature of the challenges demands international collaboration. There have always been arguments for internationalism; in our current circumstances they are extraordinarily powerful. The returns to collaboration in current circumstances can be expressed in terms of four wins. The first is that we have seen sluggish demand in many countries of the world over the last decade. From a macro perspective, planned saving exceeds planned investments and we have very low real interest rates. We need to expand world demand. Expanding demand in countries simultaneously has a much more powerful effect than expanding demand in just one country, because increasing demand in one country spills over to boost demand and employment in others. Second, we have to reset expectations, not only for growth but also for a different kind of growth. If we reset those expectations together around the world, then investors will know that the investments they are considering are of a kind that are going to be in harmony with the movement of demand around the world. A third win is that if there is a shared understanding of the direction of new technologies then we will create increasing returns to scale in production and discovery. We have already seen (see Section 2) that very powerfully in the way in which costs of solar and wind power have been driven down; the same is happening now with batteries; and electric vehicle costs are going to fall very quickly. The overall scale of technology deployment, achieved by acting together, can generate big returns. The fourth win comes from climate and biodiversity being global public goods. If we emit less greenhouse gases in one country, then all other countries gain from that drop in emissions: similarly protecting and regenerating biodiversity benefits us all. Working together is, therefore, of fundamental importance, perhaps now more than any time in history (Stern and Bhattacharya, 2020). The private sector, the multilateral development banks and international financial institutions, and the ministries of finance and the central banks all have central roles.Tackling the two crises-COVID and climate change-requires a new and shared understanding of how to reconstruct our economies and societies and the meaning of 'build back better'.

        <p>In Section 3, I explained why strong, internationally coordinated investment should be at centre stage, right through from recovery from the COVID pandemic to transformational growth and the drive to a net zero economy. What kind of orders of magnitude of investment do we need to make? To bring through the new ways of doing things and the new technologies required, we have to increase investment by around 2-3 percentage points of GDP across the world, relative to the previous decade-more in some places, less in others-as well as change the composition of investment (in China, however, it is not a question of raising investment rates but changing the composition of investment). Many of these new technologies involve pulling capital increases forward, along with investing in different ways. Renewable electricity, for example, requires upfront investment whereas fuel cost savings are realised once the renewable technologies are operational. Importantly, these investments should not be seen narrowly in terms of extra costs from going 'clean'; many of them have substantial returns in terms of greater efficiency, cleaner air, better health and more. But an increase in the investment rate by 2-3 percentage points of GDP is needed to realise these gains, to recover sustainability and to put us on a new path. This estimate of the magnitude of the necessary boost to global investment can be arrived at from a number of different perspectives. First, for the world excluding China, it would take us back to the level of investment seen three or so decades ago (Figure 5; see also IMF, 2021) and help to restore growth rates and productivity improvements. Second, there has been a persistent gap in infrastructure spending in both developed and developing economies, in terms of what is necessary to support growth and development, that has been estimated at 2-3% of global GDP (NCE, 2016;Bhattacharya et al., 2019). Third, we can examine the specifics of the needs and significant opportunities for scaling up the sustainable investments necessary to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy, and restore natural capital. These investments are examined and quantified in a number of recent reports (ETC, 2021;IEA, 2021b;Stern, 2021). These three approaches are not additive, they are different ways of looking at the issue, but they all point to numbers in a similar range.In Section 3, I explained why strong, internationally coordinated investment should be at centre stage, right through from recovery from the COVID pandemic to transformational growth and the drive to a net zero economy.

        <p>At the country level, the necessary increase in investment will vary according to level of development and circumstances. For the G7 countries, a 2 percentage point step up in investment, relative to the past decade, would partly reverse earlier declines, driven in part by cuts in public investment. More detail on an investment programme for green recovery and transformational growth, that can be driven by G7 countries, is provided in Stern (2021). For many emerging market and developing countries (EMDEs), the necessary increase in investment will likely be higher than 2 percentage points, given the range of investments, particularly around infrastructure, required to meet development goals. More detail on the magnitude and types of investment needed in EMDEs other than China, and a strategy for financing those investments, is provided in Bhattacharya (2022). For China, as noted, the main challenge will be to change the composition rather than the level of investment.At the country level, the necessary increase in investment will vary according to level of development and circumstances.

        <p>Such an investment programme could overcome the secular stagnation that has been experienced around the world over the last decade or so. From a basic Keynesian macro perspective, this was associated with planned investment being too small in relation to planned saving. The obvious solution, then, is to increase planned investment, in the light of the urgent requirements we have described. From this perspective, we can overcome secular stagnation by investing in 2022] a time for change in economics 1271 new, and environmentally necessary, ways of doing things, thereby not only restoring demand but also charting a much more attractive form of growth.Such an investment programme could overcome the secular stagnation that has been experienced around the world over the last decade or so.

        <p>These increases in investment will require strong policy and a positive investment climate, including the functioning of relevant governmental institutions. Further, the many relevant market failures (see Section 7) and the urgency of change indicate the necessity of a whole range of policy instruments. Carbon pricing will be important, but alone it will not be enough. Complementary policies, including city design, regulation and standards, and investments in R&amp;D, will also be needed.These increases in investment will require strong policy and a positive investment climate, including the functioning of relevant governmental institutions.

        <p>Investment seeks returns over the medium and long term and requires clear and credible signals. However, circumstances change and learning occurs, and that means policy will be revised; but it should occur in ways that are 'predictably flexible'. Thus, policy revisions, as lessons are learned, systems change and technologies advance, must be carried through in ways that people understand, and which can be anticipated. For example, it can be announced that an emerging technology will be supported initially but as it moves out, or 'diffuses', into the productive world, or as the cost of the new technology falls, its supporting subsidy will be reduced. Predictable flexibility has been a principle of monetary policy for some time, but it should be applied across the board; otherwise confidence in policy is undermined, policy risk is seen as pervasive, and investment is discouraged. Government-induced policy risk is one of the major deterrents to investment worldwide, particularly around infrastructure (World Bank, 2004;WEF, 2014;Baker et al., 2015;OECD, 2015;World Bank, 2020;World Bank, 2021).Investment seeks returns over the medium and long term and requires clear and credible signals.

        <p>Investment and innovation inevitably involve a certain amount of risk. Strong and rapid increases in investment might be seen as particularly risky, especially around infrastructure where early stage risk can be severe and the reliability of long-term revenue streams can be problematic. The necessary investment can be realised only with the right kind and cost of finance, on the right scale, in the right place, at the right time, which can help reduce, share and manage risk. Across the world there is great investment potential and aggregate savings are strong. But there are important difficulties in turning opportunities into real investment programmes; good policies and social institutions are of basic importance.Investment and innovation inevitably involve a certain amount of risk.

        <p>In the light of the policy analyses and arguments set out above, it is interesting to ask how issues and understanding have moved on since the publication of The Economics of Climate Change: The Stern Review (Stern, 2006) in October 2006. Fifteen years on, the review's core finding-that the costs of inaction on climate change are much greater than the costs of action-which was compelling then, in my view, is now still stronger. First, the science is ever more worrying. Greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise. There is evidence that the impacts of climate change are happening faster and with greater intensity than expected. We can see ever more clearly that there are significant risks of major areas in the world, with currently large populations, becoming unliveable; thus the risks of mass migration and conflict look increasingly severe. Each IPCC report over the last three decades has looked more worrying. The IPCC 2018 report showed how much more dangerous 2 • C of warming would be than 1. Third, the politics, have sometimes moved forward strongly (e.g., UNFCCC, COP21, Paris Agreement in 2015) and sometimes backwards (e.g., the election of Presidents Trump and Bolsonaro). The global financial crises of 2008 and 2010 reduced 'bandwidth' for climate change. More recently there have been strong positives politically, for example, China's commitment to carbon neutrality by 2060, the intensification of action in the European Union and in the United States following the election of President Biden. The private sector has started to engage strongly. And COP26 in Glasgow in November 2021 was a significant step forward.In the light of the policy analyses and arguments set out above, it is interesting to ask how issues and understanding have moved on since the publication of The Economics of Climate Change: The Stern Review (Stern, 2006) in October 2006.

        <p>Fourth, analytically our understanding and focus have moved to emphasise still more strongly the dynamics of change (Acemoglu et al., 2012;Aghion et al., 2016;Van der Meijden and Smulders, 2017;Systemiq, 2020;Ives et al., 2021). We can now point to new and much more attractive paths or models of development than were followed in the past. We can look to a new story of growth, indeed the drive to net zero can be the sustainable, inclusive and resilient growth story of the twenty-first century. The deeper understanding of the problem, in terms of dynamics of development and of the nature and breadth of potential benefits, implies that we have to deepen our economic analysis.

        <p>A natural starting point is the important set of insights of economists Alfred Marshall and Arthur Pigou. At the end of the nineteenth century, Marshall (Marshall, 1890) drew attention to the potential difference between marginal private cost and marginal social cost. Thirty years later, Pigou (Pigou, 1920) argued for a tax, equal to the difference between the marginal private cost and the marginal social cost, to correct for an externality, where that is the source of the difference. 10Around 60 or 70 years ago, Ronald Coase began considering these concepts in a different way, emphasising institutional arrangements (Coase, 1960). He spoke of allocating property rights and establishing markets so that there could be trade in externalities. James Meade-his work Trade and Welfare (Meade, 1955) was a landmark-also wrote very insightfully about the theory of externalities, including integrating externalities into the theory of reform, bringing in distributional issues and looking at general equilibrium in multi-good models. Coming forward further, and looking at applications 30 or so years ago, David Pearce, for example, was writing Blueprint for a Green Economy, emphasising how the Pigouvian idea could be implemented (Pearce et al., 1989). This is all a very important and valuable part of our intellectual history in economics. Then climate change came along with an explicit and very large problem. The IPCC was established, as a result of initiatives from scientists, in 1988, and climate change started to become a more active subject in discussions of policy. There was growing recognition that climate change could be disruptive, but at that time the common belief was that our emissions of greenhouse gases would cause only small perturbations at some point in the future. The modelling of climate change began with Bill Nordhaus's important and admirable paper 'To Slow or Not to Slow?', published in the Economic Journal in 1991 (Nordhaus, 1991) and Bill Cline published his book The Economics of Global Warming in 1992 (Cline, 1992). Nordhaus's question, recognising that there could be potential dangers from climate change and that emissions arose from activities around producing and consuming, was 'should we grow a little less fast than we might have envisaged before we thought about climate change?'. He proceeded in a sensible way, taking an emerging problem and applying the standard tools of economics: first the Pigouvian story of marginal social costs, marginal private costs, and taxing for the externality; second on growth, he used the framework of a standard exogenous growth model and considered the impact of climate change largely in terms of small perturbations around the underlying growth path(s). That was a sensible and valuable early contribution for the economics of climate change.A natural starting point is the important set of insights of economists Alfred Marshall and Arthur Pigou.

        <p>Over the following 10-15 years, it became more and more clear that climate change is not a marginal problem. We are dealing with a challenge involving huge potential disruptions. Further, rising to that challenge requires very radical changes in our production systems and ways of consuming. This challenge cannot sensibly be examined by simply picking up a fairly standard underlying model of exogenous growth and, within that model, portraying climate change in terms the economic journal [may of marginal damages of just a few percent of GDP. Nordhaus's DICE model (dynamic integrated model of climate and the economy) launched a major literature on integrated assessment models (IAMs), which integrate economy and climate with similar approaches to that of DICE. Their scope has been expanded, but the basic underlying features of optimisation of explicit, calibrated social welfare functions, of underlying exogenous growth and of aggregation (usually to one good) impose severe limitation on their ability to illuminate two basic questions. The first is how to approach analytically the challenge of managing immense risk, which could involve loss of life on a massive scale. The second is how to chart and guide a response to this challenge which will involve fundamental structural change across a whole complex economy. These two issues are at the core of economic policy on climate. The basic structure of IAMs, I shall argue, even with the many advances and mutations that have been offered, is not of a form which can tackle these two questions in any satisfactory way.Over the following 10-15 years, it became more and more clear that climate change is not a marginal problem.

        <p>There is a problem in the profession, which goes beyond the way IAMs are structured and specified, associated with an inability or unwillingness to move much beyond the static Pigouvian or twentieth-century approach to externalities in analysing the challenges of climate change. Many discussions of policy suggest that 'economic theory says' that policy should be overwhelmingly about a carbon price. A carbon price should indeed be at centre stage, but we need so much more in terms of policy and perspectives, and understanding of the issues. However, we must be clear that the suggestion that 'theory says' that the carbon price is the most effective route is simply wrong and involves a number of mistakes.There is a problem in the profession, which goes beyond the way IAMs are structured and specified, associated with an inability or unwillingness to move much beyond the static Pigouvian or twentieth-century approach to externalities in analysing the challenges of climate change.

        <p>The first mistake is the failure to incorporate a whole collection of market failures and market absences which are of great relevance and are beyond the greenhouse gas externality (see Section 7). The second is that under the temperature target or guard-rail approach (see Subsection 2.1), the choice of carbon prices is focused on its role, in combination with other policies, in incentivising paths which achieve the overall target (such as net zero emissions by mid-century to fit with the temperature target) with as much economic advantage as possible. Such prices are not simply the marginal social cost as in Pigou (see discussion of Stern-Stiglitz Commission below, this section). Third, where the risks of moving too slowly are potentially very large and there are increasing returns to scale, fixed costs and uncertainties in key industries, then standards and regulations can help reduce uncertainty and bring down costs (e.g., Weitzman, 1974). Fourth, many consumers, producers, cities, and countries, recognise the obligation to act, and are not blinkered, narrow optimisers with a view of utility focused only on their own consumption. Fifth, much of the challenge of action is how to promote collaboration and act together. This poses a whole set of important questions around institutions and actions for mutual support. Putting all this together constitutes a major analytical and practical challenge concerning risk, values, dynamics and collaboration, and the narrow Pigouvian model of the one greenhouse gases (GHG) market failure, useful though it is, is very far from the whole story.The first mistake is the failure to incorporate a whole collection of market failures and market absences which are of great relevance and are beyond the greenhouse gas externality (see Section 7).

        <p>To explain my argument concerning the failures of IAMs in relation to the two basic questions highlighted above, I will set out, in broad terms, some of the basic structure and specifications in standard IAMs. There is an underlying one-good growth model where emissions depend on output, where accumulated emissions cause temperature increase and climate change, and where emissions can be reduced by incurring costs.

        <p>a time for change in economics 1275 against strong action, because climate damage specifications are implausibly low and costs of action both implausibly high and subject to diminishing returns. For example, a recent version of the DICE model estimates losses of 8.5% of current GDP at a global temperature rise of 6 • C (Nordhaus, 2017). If this were plausible, there would be little cause for concern about climate change because 6 • C of warming will not be reached, even with bad luck, probably for over 100 years, by which point, with a modest amount of economic growth, losing less than 10 percentage points of GDP would be of minor significance in relation to GDP which had more than doubled (at say an underlying growth rate of 1% per annum). But a 6 • C temperature rise would likely be deeply dangerous, indeed existential for hundreds of millions, or billions, of people. It could be a world that could support a far lower population, and we could see deaths on a huge scale, migration of billions of people, and severe conflicts around the world, as large areas, many densely populated currently, became more or less uninhabitable as a result of submersion, desertification, storm surge and extreme weather events, or because the heat was so intense for extended periods that humans could not survive outdoors. It is profoundly implausible that numbers around 10% of GDP offer a sensible description of the kind of disruption and catastrophe that 6 • C of warming could cause. We cannot be sure of the probabilities of different scales of catastrophe, but it would seem deeply unwise, indeed reckless, to assume that catastrophe of immense proportions would not be associated with temperature increases of this magnitude. Most standard IAMs also embody diminishing returns to scale and increasing marginal costs of action to reduce emissions, plus modest rates of technical progress (relative to those experienced in the last decade or so). These features are very problematic because we have already seen how important increasing returns to scale and very rapid change in technology are in this context. Costs of solar power and LEDs have plummeted as the world has scaled up investment and innovation in cleaner technologies (as we saw in Section 2). The same is happening with batteries and electric vehicles, and is likely to happen with hydrogen. By embodying diminishing returns and modest technical progress, the IAMs systematically overstate the costs of climate action. Further, they distort the theory of policy which is much more complex when we have increasing returns to scale; particularly in the context of risk. Standard optimising policy models which focus on 'marginal cost equals marginal benefit' are far more tractable with diminishing returns and increasing marginal costs to action. By choosing model assumptions primarily for tractability and convenience, and which badly distort, or indeed omit, the key issues, we risk severely undermining the ability of the policy analysis to make a relevant contribution to the discussion at issue. Some of the flaws and biases described above and embodied in the standard IAMs can be mitigated with different assumptions, and there have been some valuable and relevant contributions in the literature. This is not the place for a literature review but some relevant and useful references to elaborations of IAMs are given in the footnote. 11 11 Dietz and Stern (2015) show that if the DICE model is modified to take more strongly into account three essential elements of the climate problem-the endogeneity of growth, the convexity of damage and climate risk-optimal policy comprises strong controls. Hänsel et al. (2020) show that adjusting the parameters of DICE, to reflect the latest findings on economic damage functions, some of the latest climate science and a broad range of expert recommendations on the pure rate of time preference and the elasticity of marginal utility, as elicited by Drupp et al. (2018), brings the economically 'optimal' climate policy path in line with UN climate goals. Schumacher (2018) has demonstrated how equity weighting can lead to significantly higher global damages from climate change than those reported by unmodified IAMs Moore and Diaz (2015) show that implementing temperature effects on GDP growth rates in DICE results in optimal climate policy that stabilises global temperature change below 2 • C. Explicit modelling of adaptation in IAMs shows that joint implementation of mitigation and adaptation is welfare improving (De Bruin et al., 2009;Bosello et al., 2010). Work by Carleton and Hsiang (2016), Ciscar et al. (2019) and others feed into better calibration of damage functions. Climate and the economic journal [may However, and this point is crucial, there are deep problems with the general approach of maximising a social welfare function, in particular based on expected utility, in the presence of extreme risk; problems which cannot plausibly be corrected by adjusting functions and parameters within that framework. The stakes we are playing for with respect to climate change are absolutely immense. The challenges of immense risk to life itself for many, point towards the need for alternative strategies for building theories and models. Impacts which can involve deaths of billions are not easily captured in the standard social welfare functions, which are used in most IAMs (and more broadly), involving aggregation of individual utility functions. Indeed, as Weitzman argued (Weitzman, 2009(Weitzman, , 2012) ) standard approaches quickly run into problems of utility functions going to minus infinity. There can be arbitrary 'fixes', for example, by putting bounds on utility. But model outcomes would be extremely sensitive to such bounds, for which the empirical and ethical foundations would be very shaky.

        <p>Just as with the social welfare function aspect of IAMs, there is a set of deep questions on the production side of the modelling. The policy challenge, as we have seen, involves generating rapid and major change in key complex systems, including energy, transport, cities and land, over a very short period. Simple 'cost' functions for emissions reductions, even if made more realistic, do not get to grips with the real policy challenges of how to make these changes. IAMs generally embody simple equilibrium on the production side. The problems of rapid change, dislocation, increasing returns, system change, and rapid innovation that are of the essence here are therefore very hard to capture in standard IAMs. We cannot expect one simplistic equilibrium framework to get to grips with the range of issues at the core of the challenges of transformation. We are likely to need a collection of modelling approaches and analyses. The IAMs could be one of these, but they should not be the central method for all the reasons advanced in this paper.Just as with the social welfare function aspect of IAMs, there is a set of deep questions on the production side of the modelling.

In that paper, our criticisms of IAMs are presented under three categories:</p>

        <p>These failures of the standard approach embodied in IAMs led us to argue, see Subsection 2.1, that the sensible, consequentialist approach to such immense risk and the need for radical change is to put in place targets or guard rails (e.g., temperature increase of 1.5 • C) and then examine how best to manage the transitions necessary to keep within them.

Instead, as it became clear, and broadly accepted, that with temperature rise over 2 • C there was a significant probability of extremely bad outcomes, and that those outcomes could be avoided at moderate costs, there emerged consensus that we should act strongly to try to avoid them. The collective understanding that significant reductions in the immense potential risk can be achieved if temperature rise is kept well below 2 • C, and in particular below 1.5 • C, is based on findings from the physical science of climate change (e.g., IPCC, 2018).

        <p>A further challenge for the economics of climate change, that is not just an issue for the IAMs, but which arises as a key question in formulating approaches to major, intertemporal problems, is discounting. The discussion of discounting around climate change has been, in my view, somewhat weak and often not well founded in basic theory. It is important to focus on discounting, which concerns the relative valuation of future costs, benefits and lives, relative to now. Unfortunately, economists (and others) leap too quickly to 'discount rates', which constitute a derived concept within discounting rather than the central notion.A further challenge for the economics of climate change, that is not just an issue for the IAMs, but which arises as a key question in formulating approaches to major, intertemporal problems, is discounting.

        <p>In this context, the important concept to consider in discounting is the social discount factor. To keep things simple let us suppose that we have chosen a unit of account and that we define the social discount factor, λ, as the relative social evaluation of an extra unit of account (e.g., consumption) in the future, relative to an extra unit now. In economics we generally use relative prices, here shadow prices, to guide choices, decisions or trade-offs. The social discount factor corresponds to this idea. The proportional rate of fall of the social discount factor is the social discount rate.In this context, the important concept to consider in discounting is the social discount factor.

        <p>Other than the possibility of extinction (for example, from an asteroid crashing into the earth), which is something that you can, at least in principle, build directly into the analysis, there is no serious ethical argument in favour of pure-time discounting (see Stern, 2015, chs 5 and 6, for an extended discussion of the issues and key references; also the pair of articles in the Journal of Economics and Philosophy, Stern, 2014a,b). 15,16 It is the social discount factor, λ, the relative shadow price, that is the important concept to focus on. The essence of intertemporal valuation is embodied, on the margin, by this relative shadow price. Under most, or many at least, systems of value, how much you judge the value of units of consumption or income in the future, relative to now, depends on how well off you think those in the future will be then. That is endogenous because how well off they will be depends on what we do now. This relative shadow price depends on our decisions and is not exogenous to them. This is of particular importance in this context, because if we act recklessly on climate change, future generations could be much poorer than ours.Other than the possibility of extinction (for example, from an asteroid crashing into the earth), which is something that you can, at least in principle, build directly into the analysis, there is no serious ethical argument in favour of pure-time discounting (see Stern, 2015, chs 5 and 6, for an extended discussion of the issues and key references; also the pair of articles in the Journal of Economics and Philosophy, Stern, 2014a,b). 15,16 It is the social discount factor, λ, the relative shadow price, that is the important concept to focus on.

        <p>Finally, on discounting, we must note that there is little point in looking for ethical values relevant to social discounting in capital markets, because capital markets: (i) do not reflect ethical social decisions; (ii) they embody expectations and views about risk that are hard to identify; and (iii) they involve many imperfections. Nevertheless, one often seems to hear the mistaken argument that social preferences can be derived from these markets.Finally, on discounting, we must note that there is little point in looking for ethical values relevant to social discounting in capital markets, because capital markets: (i) do not reflect ethical social decisions; (ii) they embody expectations and views about risk that are hard to identify; and (iii) they involve many imperfections.

        <p>These considerations underlie the rationale for the climate change legislation and the carbon budgets in the United Kingdom. The Climate Change Act and the Climate Change Committee, with its carbon budgets, 18 are good examples of where the law and institutions can play a valuable role. Indeed, the law is beginning to play a strong role in other countries too. In April 2021, Germany's Constitutional Court upheld a claim challenging the constitutionality of certain provisions of the German Climate Protection Act, in the sense that the measures in the Act were too weak. The court ruled that Germany's legal requirement to meet the overall goals of the Paris Agreement, together with insufficiently strict 2030 emissions reduction targets, imply a rate of emissions reductions after 2030 that places an unreasonable burden on future generations (Setzer and Higham, 2021). This decision prompted the German Cabinet to approve a bill that raises the ambition of the emissions reduction targets enshrined in the Climate Protection Act ( Boldis and Lütkehaus, 2021). And in the Netherlands, the District Court of The Hague ruled in May 2021 that Royal Dutch Shell must cut its global carbon emissions by 45% compared to 2019 levels by 2030, due to an 'unwritten standard of care' that Shell owes to Dutch residents under the Dutch civil code (Grimmitt, 2021).These considerations underlie the rationale for the climate change legislation and the carbon budgets in the United Kingdom.

        <p>The GHG failure is top of our list of market failures. And carbon pricing has a critical role to play in tackling that market failure. However, we can see, from thinking about different aspects of market and government failures, that the policy question is much richer and more complex in substance than can be handled by carbon pricing alone. If we consider the very real circumstances of increasing returns to scale on mitigation action, strong risk, and worries about what government might do, we could argue that regulatory policies, such as the phase out of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, have a strong role to play. The British government has set a date of 2030 the economic journal [may (and the EU 2035), beyond which ICE vehicles can no longer be sold. That provides a very clear and strong signal, which gives car firms the confidence to pursue the major fixed costs around the development of alternative technologies and moving to scale. The banning of incandescent light bulbs is a powerful example of how new and much better technologies can be developed and driven to low cost by regulation, and how the move to scale of new technologies can be fostered by the clarity regulation can bring. This regulation did not specify technologies to replace the incandescent bulbs, but required their phase out because they were so wasteful. Before long the far superior LED system came through and costs were driven down. Thus, in the case of incandescent lightbulbs and ICE vehicles, the policy does not pick winners; it is about regulating out the harmful. These policies should also be subject to periodic evaluation, but that evaluation would need to be broader than standard marginal cost-benefit analysis.The GHG failure is top of our list of market failures.

        <p>In these circumstances of increasing returns and risk, alongside other market failures, such regulatory policies, alongside carbon pricing, could be more efficient and effective than carbon pricing alone. It is surprising therefore that some economists assert that economics says that the most efficient policy instrument is carbon pricing, and that we pursue others simply because this may be politically difficult. That is a theoretical mistake of real practical significance.In these circumstances of increasing returns and risk, alongside other market failures, such regulatory policies, alongside carbon pricing, could be more efficient and effective than carbon pricing alone.

        <p>Much of structural change will be around the functioning of major systems, including: energy, cities, transport, land. Clean power is at the centre of the transition to net zero emissions. A number of estimates suggest that the global electricity supply will need to quadruple over the next three decades, given the likely dependence of much of transport and heating/cooling on electricity (ETC, 2021; IEA, 2021b), if we are to achieve net zero emissions by mid-century.

These systems are currently dysfunctional along key dimensions, so we have much to gain from managing them better as we work to cut emissions. Indeed, in all too many cases, the structure of incentives embodied in agricultural policies and subsidies lead to land degradation, the poisoning of rivers and oceans, and the destruction of forests. Further, often the financial or other returns to such policies are captured by richer enterprises and individuals.A recent estimate has suggested that transformation to reduce the current 'hidden costs' of food and land use systems across the world could generate economic gains to society of $5.7 trillion annually by 2030 and $10.5 trillion annually by 2050 (FOLU, 2019).

I have emphasised throughout this paper that managing climate change requires fundamental transformation of our economies: and it requires conceptual and evidential frameworks that can guide the policies and actions that can shape such transformations. A collection of conceptual, theoretical, empirical and modelling approaches, and not just a single grand model, will be needed; there are several important questions to answer. These include the following: What instruments should we utilise? If we use prices as guidance, what could be, and how do we understand, the social cost of carbon, and what prices might guide the production side to net zero emissions by mid-century? What are the key large structural and systemic changes that will be required as part of the green transition? How should we foster innovation and R&amp;D? A model, or analytical approach, designed to help answer one of these questions may be less helpful in answering others. It will be necessary to assemble microeconomic, structural, technological, and macroeconomic analyses of change for countries and communities across the world. Suitably improved IAMs may play a role on the more aggregative end of the spectrum in this collection of analyses and models. My arguments here are not that they have no role to play but that we should be clear that it should not be the dominant role, because of their inherent limitations on the key challenges of risk and change.have to make or advise on policy, but it applies particularly sharply here where both urgency and rapid change are of the essence.

        <p>Changes in the behaviours and values of consumers, workers, shareholders, managers and voters are key to driving change in business and policy decisions, while business and policy decisions can also have a powerful influence on consumer behaviours. Understanding the political economy, and associated instabilities, constraints and opportunities, shaping the transition to net zero emissions will be important both for creating effective policy frameworks to decarbonise at pace and to accelerate the deployment of clean technologies across the economy. There has been a huge amount of progress in the literature in economics on behaviour, institutions and political economy over the last 20-30 years. This includes fruitful collaboration with other social sciences, for example, research at the intersection of economics and political science relating to polycentric governance of public goods (e.g., Ostrom et al., 1999). Interesting work on changing values in the context of climate is emerging (see e.g., Besley and Persson, 2019). 19 Important areas for continued research include: behaviour change in the face of adjustment costs and missing information; and incentives and nudges.Changes in the behaviours and values of consumers, workers, shareholders, managers and voters are key to driving change in business and policy decisions, while business and policy decisions can also have a powerful influence on consumer behaviours.

        <p>The necessary transformation of the economy relies critically on changing key systems: energy, cities, transport, land use. These large and complex systems cannot be changed by fiddling with the economic journal [may just one parameter; a whole set of policies will be required to foster change. For example, you would not sensibly attempt to redesign a city to reduce congestion and pollution via only a carbon price, even though a carbon price would be of great relevance. Understanding how to foster change at the system level will be vital. Part of that will be around sequencing. For example, much of transport and heating will depend on electricity so that, if they are to be decarbonised, then electricity will have to be expanded quickly and itself be decarbonised. The interactions of systems (including energy, transport, cities) and of systemic regulation (grids, buildings and land use, transport) will be crucial issues. So, too, the systemic management of change. This is a 'whole economy' transition and the economy-wide story requires strong central coordination from those ministries-prime ministers and finance ministries especiallywhich cover the whole economy. Implementation which relies only on line ministries would likely run into major difficulties.The necessary transformation of the economy relies critically on changing key systems: energy, cities, transport, land use.

        <p>We are going to need to understand innovation in a much deeper and stronger way, because it is at the heart of the transition to net zero. The necessary innovation will go far beyond one particular technology, in one particular industry; it will be innovation across the whole range of ways of doing things. Thus, more work is needed to understand the complementarities between different features of the innovation system, as well as between different types of innovation (Stern and Valero, 2020). It would be good to look still more deeply into how new technologies enter a market and how they can accelerate towards and beyond market tipping points, to eventually become the dominant technology. And in the spirit of Schumpeter, we can expect these technologies, in time, to be themselves disrupted.We are going to need to understand innovation in a much deeper and stronger way, because it is at the heart of the transition to net zero.

        <p>These processes, always of central interest to growth and development, are vital to the fundamental transformation required in the next two or three decades. Thirty or so years ago the economics profession would, on the whole, have emphasised an approach which left the directions of investment and innovation largely to the market. The market will still be at the heart of action and the big majority of innovation and investment will be private. But we now have a story which is different in two key respects: a clear environment and climate purpose; great urgency.These processes, always of central interest to growth and development, are vital to the fundamental transformation required in the next two or three decades.

        <p>Efficiency is something we will have to scrutinise much more carefully than we have done in the past. The simplistic perspective that 'all that exists is efficient because if it is not efficient it would not exist' is less than convincing at the best of times, but is thoroughly unconvincing in this case. There are all kinds of inefficiencies that exist in our economies and we must try to understand their nature and origins and how to overcome them. Energy efficiency is, of course, central, but the challenges of better resource use go way beyond that. Ideas around the circular economy, and resource efficiency more generally, will be of fundamental importance.Efficiency is something we will have to scrutinise much more carefully than we have done in the past.

        <p>The integration of 'nature-based solutions' into climate policy provides real opportunities both for carbon removal and for promoting biodiversity. We should seek 'nature-based solutions' that can promote diverse, intact natural ecosystems for preserving forest carbon sinks in the face of climate change (Sakschewski et al., 2016) and supporting human adaptation to climate change (Lavorel et al., 2015). At the same time, we should avoid monocultures (Hulvey et al., 2013;Seddon et al., 2019) which may be problematic both for biodiversity and long-term carbon storage. There is great potential in restoring degraded land which can be good for all of mitigation, adaptation and development. There is important research needed here on how to examine the mix of policies and the role of institutions that would help us to tackle these interrelated challenges and realise the great potential in enhancing our natural capital.

        <p>The strategic challenge is to move to a net zero carbon economy within a few decades. The economics of action must be focused on the achievement of fundamental economic change at real pace, where time matters (Stern, 2018). That will involve, as I have stressed, looking at, inter alia, innovation, behaviour change, political economy, and the dynamics of all those elements. And we will need all of our economics to take on these problems: international, industrial, labour, health, education, environment, energy, economic history and more. We should not be narrowly focused on a sub-discipline within economics if we are going to take on big problems of this kind; we should be economists. And we must work with other social scientists, scientists and engineers. For example, designing the policies and institutions that can tackle the interrelated challenges of biodiversity loss and climate change will require economists to work together with ecologists, while understanding the nature and magnitude of the investments required to create a zero-carbon power system and developing strategies to finance these investments will require economists to work together with engineers. Though we may have our specialities, we have to recognise that most elements of economics come into the challenge of climate change. There has never been anything more important, there has never been anything more fascinating, and we have so much to offer from our existing set of ideas and tools if we put them to use. And we must develop new analyses and perspectives. The key issues are risks and change.
