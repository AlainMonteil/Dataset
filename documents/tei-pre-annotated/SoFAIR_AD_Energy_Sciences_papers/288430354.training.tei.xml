        <p>This paper reports the two-dimensional (2D) transient numerical simulation of a phase change material (PCM) based finned heat sink to investigate the heat transfer performance for passive cooling of electronic devices. The finned heat sinks of 2 mm and 3 mm fin thickness are employed with a constant fin volume fraction of 9%, acting as thermal conductivity enhancer (TCE). The n-eicosane is employed as a PCM inside the heat sink to store the heat generated from the electronic device applied at the heat sink base. Transient numerical simulations are performed using finite-volume-method and conjugate heat transfer and melting/solidification phenomenon are investigated by applying various power levels. The numerical results show that the employed PCM with low temperature keeps the heat sink base temperature in lower limits and uniform melting is observed inside the finned heat sink.</p>
        <p>With the increase of heating power level, the PCM melting time is decreased for fin thickness heat sinks. By increasing the power level from 4 to 6W, for the case of 3 mm fin thickness, the melting time increases by 6.63%, 3.59% and 1.90% by 3 mm fin thickness heat sink, compared to the 2 mm fin thickness heat sink. The developed equations of liquid fraction and modified Nusselt number are obtained as function of modified Fourier number, Stefan number, and Rayleigh number which provide guidelines for generalizing the performance of PCM based finned heat sinks.</p>
        <p>The miniaturization and advanced multi-functionality of electronic devices have undergone a great revolution in current era. Both features result in the overheating of electronic components and lead to the unreliable and dramatic increase in operating temperature [1].</p>
        <p>Around 55% of failures in operating electronic devices are due to the increase in device temperature [2]. Therefore, to overcome the overheating phenomenon and efficient temperature distribution, a novel and efficient cooling technology is needed to avoid any type of failures. Many researchers are working on the electronic cooling system by using piezoelectric energy harvesting mechanism specifically in the field of mechanical and aerospace engineering [3,4,5]. In recent years, the invention of passive thermal management (TM) of electronics devices using phase change materials (PCMs) and various thermal conductivity enhancers (TCEs) have introduced a new direction in cooling technologies. PCMs are the best competitors for cooling of electronics devices because of high heat storage density and isothermal process during phase transition [6].</p>
        <p>Several studies have been reported which introduced the finned heat sinks as a TCE, filled with PCMs which have high specific and latent heat of fusion with small change in volume.</p>
        <p>A numerical study proposed by Nayak et al. [7] for TM of electronics using porous matrix and finned (plate-type and rod-type) as a TCEs for PCM filled heat sinks. TCEs of 5%, 10% and 15% volume fractions of TCE were selected in the case of finned heat sinks. Authors marked two findings: firstly 10% had the better thermal performance and secondly rod-type TCE was more significant in terms of convection of melt front of PCM to transfer heat, which in turn lead to lower chip temperature. Shatikan et al. [8] conducted the transient numerical simulation of a PCM-based heat sink at constant heat flux and performed a dimensional analysis. The results were presented with good agreement with melt fraction in terms of Nusselt, Fourier, modified Stefan and Rayleigh numbers. Further, Saha and Dutta [9,10] proposed the heat transfer correlation of a plate-fin PCM based heat sink of various enclosures and heat fluxes. The authors suggested that a single correlation of Nu and Ra numbers is not enough to relate the performance of heat sink with melt fraction. Wang and Yang [11,12] conducted a three dimensional numerical study for different number of fins (0, 3 and 6 fins) at heating power level of 2, 3 and 4 W. The authors used the n-eicosane as a PCM and found good agreement with experimental results. Ye et al.</p>
        <p>[13] performed the simulation of a plate-fin heat storage unit and studied the thermal storage/release characteristics of paraffin wax at different wall temperature and presented the results in dimensionless variables. Pakrouh et al. [14] performed the numerical optimization of number of fins, height, thickness and base thickness of heat sink using Taguchi method.</p>
        <p>The results found that the number of fins had the greatest influence, followed by fin thickness and height at low critical temperature while base thickness had the least effect on the operating temperature. Kant et al. [15] studied the thermal performance of five different PCMs namely capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid and stearic acid filled in aluminum containers. The results showed that maximum energy was stored by stearic acid and minimum for capric acid with the same boundary conditions. Sahoo et al. [16] conducted the numerical simulation of orthotropic composite fins as the TCEs using n-eicosane as a PCM and reported that orthotropic fins showed better thermal performance in reducing the base temperature compared to isotropic fins. Further, it was suggested that using orthotropic fins instead of isotropic fins minimized the thermal constraints, as well as weight, on the thermal electronic components. Vogel et al. [17] carried out experimental and numerical studies of eutectic mixture of sodium nitrate and potassium nitrate (KNO 3 +NaNO 3 )</p>
        <p>as a PCM on a high temperature flat-plate as TES system in a natural convection mode.</p>
        <p>A convective enhancement factor was introduced and it was found that natural convection heat transfer enhancement was increased with higher widths and smaller heights of TES system. Joshi and Rathod [18] proposed a numerical study to obtain the best fin size and location in a rectangular enclosure to give the minimum melting time for a given fin-to-PCM volume ratio to increase the thermal transport of the PCM. The authors used four different configurations and found that the fin-to-PCM volume ratio could be decreased by half and could increase the total volume of the thermal energy storage. Further, it was concluded that the reduction in volume of fins at the top portion of the TES system did not change the overall rate of PCM melting significantly. Ji et al. [19] carried out a numerical investigation of a vertically heated rectangular enclosure to suppress the non-uniform heat transfer of PCM melting with fins angled at 0 • , +15 Recently, Arshad and his co-authors [22,23,24,25,26] conducted parametric experimental studies for square and circular profiles pin-fin heat sinks based on the number of fins, fin thickness and fin configuration filled with six different types of PCM of varying melting temperatures and latent heat of fusion at constant and intermittent heating. The authors selected 9% volume fraction of TCEs and concluded that 2 mm and 3 mm fin thickness of square and circular fins, respectively, had the maximum thermal performance compared with no fin, 1 mm, 3 mm and 4 mm fin thickness PCM-filled heat sinks. Further, Ali et al.</p>
        <p>[27] conducted the experimental study using 2 mm fin thickness pin-fin heat sink to study the constant and intermittent operation conditions. The results revealed that intermittent operating modes showed the maximum operation duration by increasing the operation cycles. Ashraf and his co-authors [28,29,30] used the various PCMs of different meting temperature and latent-heat fusion and filled in circular and square pin-fin heat sink having inline and staggered fin distribution. Results revealed the best cooling performance of inline arrangement as compared to staggered for both circular and square pin-fins heat sinks.</p>
        <p>This research activity presents the numerical simulation of finned heat sinks using different fin thickness of 2 mm and 3 mm considering constant fin volume fraction of 9% resulting in different fin numbers. Both heat sinks are filled with n-eicosane as the PCM and three different heating power levels of 4, 5 and 6W are applied at the heat sink base to explore the thermal enhancement performance of PCM based finned heat sinks. This will eventually provide a better picture to select the optimum configuration of PCM based finned heat sink for the solution of electronic devices as passive cooling technology.</p>
        <p>In present study, the PCM based finned heat sinks of 2 mm and 3 mm fin thickness, which was experimentally investigated by Arshad et al. [22,23] and Ashraf et al. [28,29],</p>
        <p>were numerically modelled to explore the thermal performance of heat sink by varying input parameters. The heat sinks were made of aluminium with constant volume fraction of 9% which are acting as TCEs embedded with the PCM namely n-eicosane and with fin height of 20 mm. The volume fraction of TCEs denoted by γ is calculated using Eq. 1, which is actually the ratio of volume occupied by the fins to the total empty volume of heat sink.</p>
        <p>In recent experimental research investigations, Baby and Balaji [31] and recently Arshad and his co-authors [22,23,26] and Ashraf et al. [28,29] reported that a finned heat sink of volume fraction of 9% provided the best thermal performance for passive thermal management of portable electronic devices. The system is designed based on the average dimensions of portable hand-held electronic devices. The heat sink were insulated from all sides to prevent any heat loss to the surrounding during operation. The top surface of the heat sink was covered with perspex sheet, to provide the insulation and to visualize the physical change in solid-liquid interface of PCM in melting and solidification phases. The schematic of the physical domain studied in this paper is illustrated in Figure 1. In the system, 2D geometry of the both heat sinks is considered having fin thickness of 2mm and 3 mm with adiabatic walls and a heat flux is implemented at the bottom of the system. The dimensions the physical domain are mentioned in Table 1. The thermophysical properties of used PCM (n-eicosane) and aluminium are listed in Table 2.</p>
        <p>The governing equations are expressed based on the problem under consideration in current study, as shown in Figure 1. The enthalpy-porosity method is adopted to model the effect of phase transition in the PCM based finned heat sink. The conjugate heat transfer</p>
        <p>0001 has been solved using continuity, momentum and energy equations. For the phase transition problem "melting and solidification" model has been applied. The following assumptions are taken to model the PCM based finned heat sink in present numerical investigation [32,33,34]:</p>
        <p>• Initially, the PCM and heat sink are at the melting temperature of PCM.</p>
        <p>• The heat sink remains in solid-state and absorbs the sensible heat only.</p>
        <p>• The material of heat sink is homogeneous and isotropic.</p>
        <p>• Local thermal equilibrium exists between the fins and liquid PCM.</p>
        <p>• Thermophysical properties of PCM and fins are remained constant with temperature and phase.</p>
        <p>• The liquid PCM is assumed to be laminar, unsteady, incompressible Newtonian fluid and subjected to the Boussinesq approximation.</p>
        <p>• The volume change of PCM is negligible during the melting and solidification.</p>
        <p>• The radiative heat transfer is negligible.</p>
        <p>The following governing conservation equations for mass, momentum and energy can be written based the above assumptions:</p>
        <p>Mass conservation:</p>
        <p>Momentum conservation:</p>
        <p>Energy conservation:</p>
        <p>where, P is the pressure, g is the gravitational acceleration, ρ is the density, µ is the dynamic viscosity, ρc p is the thermal capacitance, k is the thermal conductivity, and t is the time, u and v are the velocity components in x and y directions, respectively. Due to the direction of gravitational acceleration in the negative y-direction, the Boussinesq approximation is added as the sixth term by ρ ref gβ(T -T ref ) [35,36]. The value of β = 0.001 K -1 has been chosen based on the analysis of the detailed data reported by Humphries and Griggs [37].</p>
        <p>The source term S in momentum equation, Equations 3 and 4 can be expressed as follows:</p>
        <p>where is A m (ϕ) is the "porosity function" defined by Brent et al. [38] which fulfil "the basic principle is gradually to reduce the velocities from a finite value in liquid, to zero in full solid, over the computational calls that are changing the phase". Thus, nth fluid cells which are undergoing the mushy-zone phase change, A m (ϕ) is defined as follows to make the momentum equation to mimic Carman-Kozeny equations for flow in porous media:</p>
        <p>where b = 0.001 is merely a computational constant used to avoid division by zero. The constant C is reflecting the morphology of the melting front which controls the degree of penetration of the convection flied into the mushy-zone phase change. The value of C = 10 5</p>
        <p>is taken in present study as recommended in several studies [11,12,39]. Furthermore, a mushy region lies between the liquid fraction 0 and 1. The ϕ can be defined as:</p>
        <p>The total enthalpy of the PCM is the summation of sensible and latent heat defined as:</p>
        <p>where h is the sensible enthalpy which is defined as follows:</p>
        <p>and ∆H is the fractional latent heat of the PCM that may vary between 0 for solid and L (latent heat of fusion) for liquid which is expressed as:</p>
        <p>The S h is the energy source term in Equation 3 represents the latent heat storage due to melting and it is defined as:</p>
        <p>Where</p>
        <p>The mathematical models used for the present simulation can be found in Nayak et al. [7],</p>
        <p>Wang and Yang [11,12], Sahoo et al. [16] and Shatikian et al. [8,39]. They simulated the heat transfer performance of PCM in internal fins. A good agreement was found of numerical results with experimental results reported by Fok et al. [40] and Hosseinizadeh et al. [41]. Therefore, current method is used to simulate the pin-fin heat sink filled with PCM a LHSU.</p>
        <p>The initial and boundary conditions are referenced to the experimental study by Arshad et al. [23,22,26] and Ashraf et al. [28,29]. The schematic of physical domain for the 2D case used in this study is shown in Figure 1. The outer boundary walls are defined as an adiabatic boundary condition because the outer sides of heat sink are insulated with thermal insulation material to prevent the heat loss towards the surrounding in experimentation.</p>
        <p>Since, the phase change phenomenon is occurring inside the PCM based finned heat sink in transient mode. The initial and boundary conditions applied in the present case are as follows to solve the governing equations:</p>
        <p>1. Initial condition</p>
        <p>The following boundary conditions are applied for the solution of governing equations: [42]. For the pressure correction equation, Presto scheme is used while QUICK scheme is employed for the momentum and energy equations [43]. A second order upwind differencing scheme was employed for the discretization of convective terms in momentum and energy equations. Gravity effects were also considered. The convergence criteria are set to 10 -4 , 10 -4 and 10 -6 for continuity, momentum and energy equations, respectively. The grid and time independence tests were carried out to avoid their effects on the numerical accuracy. results, the mesh with 42418 elements and time-step of ∆t = 0.1s were selected in the current study for further simulations. To compromise the accuracy and cost, the mesh size of 42418 elements is selected.</p>
        <p>The dimensionless analysis is performed in order to normalize the phase change heat transfer process and melting phenomenon of the n-eicosane embedded into the finned heat sinks.</p>
        <p>The dimensionless average heat sink base temperature (θ) is defined to express the temperature distribution while melting inside the heat sink [44].</p>
        <p>The dimensionless heat flux ( Q) is defined to express the generalized effect of heating power during the PCM phase transition inside the heat sink which averaged over the heat sink base.</p>
        <p>The non-dimensional number utilized in transient heat conduction problems is Fourier number (F o) which is defined as the ratio between the diffusive transport and the energy storage. F o depicts the time for diffusion of heat across the PCM thickness and it can be calculated as follows [32,45]:</p>
        <p>Stefan number (Ste) represents amount of superheating which is experienced by the liquidphase of the PCM. While melting, the effect of convection is present only when the Ste number is greater than 1. Ste number is defined as the ratio of the sensible heat to the latent heat, which is defined as [32,45]:</p>
        <p>where</p>
        <p>Therefore, Ste number is defined as:</p>
        <p>The product of Ste and F o numbers represents the dimensionless time for phase change without convection.</p>
        <p>To account the effect of free or natural convection heat transfer in molten PCM, Grashof (Gr) number or more comprehensively Rayleigh (Ra) number is used which is associated with the buoyancy driven flow indicating the ratio of natural convection to conduction heat transfer. For a uniform heat flux, Ra based on the fin height as a characteristic length is defined as [32,45]:</p>
        <p>Heat transfer as a function of dimensionless number is described by modified Nusselt number (N u * ) which presents the time-dependent relationship between the instantaneous heat flux (q) and temperature difference (∆T ), is defined as [32,39]:</p>
        <p>Where, ∆T is the temperature difference between the base temperature and melting temperature of the PCM, t p /2 is half-thickness of the PCM layer is chosen as characteristics length proposed by Saha and Dutta [32] and Shatikian et al. [39]. The reason to choose the t p /2 as characteristics length is that for tall enclosure, the aspect ratio of fin height and PCM thickness (h f 2/t p ) of the heat sink cavity is very large, which reduce the effect of convection compared with conduction heat transfer in the PCM domain results is a lower temperature difference between the two consecutive fins. Furthermore, Saha and Dutta [32] reported the range of aspect ratio of fin height and PCM thickness (1.939 &lt; h f 2/t p ≤ 5) for tall enclosures which almost equal to 4.32 and 5.13 for 3 mm and 2 mm fin thickness heat sinks.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the results of N u * number and liquid fraction as a function of F oSteRa based on t p /2 as characteristic length scale are expressed using modified F o * number, Ste * number and Ra * number:</p>
        <p>The mentioned dimensionless parameter are employed in various previous studies to define the variation in heat sink temperature and liquid fraction [8,13,16,32,44].</p>
        <p>The current model is validated with experimental results of a no fin heat sink filled with PCM having the dimension of similar dimensions used in Ashraf et al. [28]. The RT-35HC was used as a PCM having melting temperature of 35 • C at a input power level of 5W. The results of average temperature of heat sink was compared of both numerical and experimental cases, as shown in Figure 3. The results of both numerical and experimental results showed a good agreement and revealed that the present numerical model can be used for further simulations.</p>
        <p>To validate and ensure the accuracy of the numerical approach, the average temperature and liquid fraction of RT-58 PCM in a horizontal triples tube LHS system with internal- compared to high heat flux as the time increases which is due to the rapid heat transfer into the PCM through fins, results in a higher rate of PCM melting. It can be seen from</p>
        <p>Figure 5 that at 4W, the PCM did not fully melt even after 40 min of heating. Contrarily, it is fully melted at 5W and 6W after 40 min. It is revealed that the higher the heat flux, higher the heat transfer rate results in higher the liquid fraction rate or melting rate of the PCM in a finned based heat sink.</p>
        <p>The rate of heat transfer in a PCM filled finned heat sink can been from temperature contours shown in Figure 6, which shows the distribution of temperature inside in the 2 mm and 3 mm fin thickness finned heat sink for different time steps at a power level of 5W during melting. At a constant input power level, it can be seen clearly that the rate of temperature rise is higher in 2 mm fin thickness heat sink as compared 3 mm fin thickness heat sink in all times. For example, the temperature varies from 317.82 K to 319.58 K for 2 mm fin thickness heat sink at 45 min, whereas it varies from 315.7 -317.5 K for the case of 3 mm fin thickness heat sink. The higher temperature rise in 2 mm fin thickness heat sink is due the more number of fins compared to the 3 mm fin thickness heat sink.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the penetration of heat in PCM region is more in case of 2 mm fin thickness heat sink causing a shorter melting time which can be seen in Figure 6 especially at time 30 min.</p>
        <p>A further comparison of liquid fraction contours for both fin thickness heat sinks can be seen from Figure 7. The finned heat sink of 3 mm fin thickness has the lower rate of PCM melting due to the higher heat transfer area, optimum number and distribution of fins. The lower rate of PCM melting of 3 mm fin thickness heat sink enhances to absorb and transfer the heat more uniformly and effectively towards the ambient, keeping the base temperature of heat sink at lower level thus resulting in more efficient thermal cooling. Similar findings of 2 mm and 3 mm fin thickness finned heat sink has been reported in Ref. [26].</p>
        <p>The heating phenomenon inside the heat sink can be seen from the velocity vectors shown in Figure 8, which shows the formation of vortices at the base and top of the PCM zone between the two consecutive fins. The direction of velocity vectors show that liquid PCM moves from bottom to top close to the walls and then converge at centre of the PCM zone while heating at the base. The formations of vortices are in two main circulating patterns of the liquid PCM because of natural convection and direction of gravity.</p>
        <p>The results are presented by comparing the temperature difference-time variations of 2 mm and 3 mm fin thickness finned heat sink at different power levels in Figure 9. Since the initial temperature is fixed which is equal to the ambient conditions, a temperature difference is reported instead of temperature. The temperature difference (∆T = T -T ini )</p>
        <p>represents the difference between the temperature of heated base of heat sink and initial temperature. As expected, the lower the power level, the higher the time needed to fully melt the n-eicosane which happens when the PCM temperature rises above the melting point temperature. The maximum heat sink base temperature difference reaches at 21.68</p>
        <p>• C and 18.31 with 2 mm and 3 mm fin thickness finned heat sink, respectively. The melt fraction curves of both fin thickness finned heat sink at different power levels are shown in Figure 9. At each power level, the melt fraction of different configurations finishes uniformly due to the natural convection heat transfer within the melt region and uniform distribution of the fins.</p>
        <p>In addition, the case of 3 mm fin thickness takes a higher time to complete the melting phase compared with the 2 mm fin thickness finned heat sink. The melting times are 2565s and 2730s at 4W, 1925s and 1745s at 5W, and 1550s and 1605s at 6W for 2mm and 3 mm fin thickness finned heat sink, respectively. Hence, the selection of PCM based heat sink as a passive cooling media is based on the operating power of the electronic device. At higher input power level, more PCM or a PCM with higher latent heat of fusion is required, which can prolong the operating duration at comfortable temperature level. Furthermore, it can be seen from Figure 10 that at each power level, the configuration of 3 mm fin thickness finned heat sink takes more time to complete the solid-liquid phase change process compared with 2 mm fin thickness finned heat sink when fully filled with PCM. The higher time to complete the melting process leads to lower the base temperature of the heat sink and thus 3 mm fin thickness finned heat sink has the best thermal performance to enhance the passive cooling capability of electronic devices filled with PCMs. thickness of the fins. In addition, the θ is higher for a lower Q during the melting process.</p>
        <p>However, PCM melting is terminated in a lower F o for a higher Q and then θ increases sharply after the melting process. The reason for this can be explained from Equations 14 and 15. For constant properties of PCM and a constant fin height, F o number increases and θ decreases by increasing Q. However, at constant Q, the θ varies with temperature difference (∆T = T -T ini ) and F o. Moreover, at a constant F o, a higher θ is achieved for 2 mm fin thickness compared with 3 mm case at a constant Q, which reflects the increase in the phase transition duration from solid to liquid results in improves the thermal performance of heat sink. As shown in Figure 11, F o alone is not sufficient to express the generalize trend of temperature distribution because of the effect of phase change process. Figure 12 represents the distribution of θ as a function of dimensionless time (τ ) at different Q. The similar trends of θ by varying the Q, i.e. the at lower Q, θ reaches higher and it takes more time to complete the phase change process during melting. It can been seen from both finned heat sinks, the θ increases ∆T increases with the decrease of Q at the same τ due to ∆T of energy storage increasing constantly [13]. However, when the τ is larger than 1.25, the θ increases linearly. This is caused by τ only covers over the critical point (τ = 1.25), as shown in Figure 12. which is also reported in the literature [47]. In addition, the F o * number is significantly reduced from 0.23 to 0.12 with the increase of Ste * from 0.12 to 0.21. The reason behind such trends can be explained from Equation 24. For the constant PCM properties and PCM thickness layer, Ste * number increases by increasing Q. Therefore, at constant F o * , a higher liquid fraction is obtained by increasing Q which takes less time to complete the melting process. From Figure 13, it can been seen that 3 mm fin thickness finned heat sink has a higher Ste * at constant Q, e.g. at Q = 12, Ste * is 0.12 and 0.14 for 2 mm and 3 mm fin thickness, respectively, which shows that 3 mm fin thickness finned heat sink has a higher capacity to absorb the heat in form of latent heat. Moreover, It can be revealed that liquid fraction is not just the function of F o * because the effect of phase change are not included.</p>
        <p>Thus, liquid fraction is directly a function of Ste * due to the fact that liquid fraction is changed directly with the inverse of latent heat of fusion based on the storage capacity of the PCM based finned heat sink.</p>
        <p>Therefore, for the generalization of melting phenomenon, the results of liquid fraction are presented in Figure 14</p>
        <p>The transient 2D numerical simulation of PCM filled finned heat sinks are carried out to investigate the heat transfer and flow-field characteristics having the fin thickness of 2 mm and 3 mm, optimally explored from the previous experimental investigations. Three different input heating power level of 4, 5 and 6W are provided at base of each heat sink.</p>
        <p>The numerical results show that finned heat sink filled with PCM has the capability of uniform heat distribution inside the heat sink. Uniform melting of PCM is observed inside the fins and higher phase change duration is obtained for 3 mm fin thickness finned heat sink at each input heat flux. In addition, natural convection heating phenomenon is observed and velocity vectors reveal that melting of PCM occur from bottom to top of the finned heat sink. The circulating patterns are formed of vortices of the liquid PCM because of natural convection and direction of gravity. Further, the results indicated that finned heat sink of 3 mm fin thickness has the better heat transfer performance to stable the base temperature, enhances the better cooling capability and lower the maximum operating temperature as compared to 3 mm fin thickness finned heat sink. By increasing the power level from 4 to 6W, for the case of 3 mm fin thickness, the melting time increases by 6.63%, 3.59% and</p>
        <p>in terms of the product of Ste * and F o * for different cases of Ste * . It can be seen that the different lines of liquid fractions of are closer to each other. However, there is still a deviation in completion of melting process for a higher Ste * * Ste * Ra * 0.155 tp Ra * -0.01 h f . Note that developed correlation is reasonable for finned heat sink chosen in current study within the parameter range: 0 &lt; F o * &lt; 0.26, 0.12 &lt; Ste * &lt; 0.21, 1.54 × 10 3 &lt; Ra * 0.155 tp &lt; 4.60 × 10 3 , 1.71 × 10 7 &lt; Ra * -0.01 h f &lt; 2.56 × 10 7 , 0 &lt; f l &lt; 1, 0 &lt; F o * Ste * Ra * 0.155 tp Ra * -0.01</p>
