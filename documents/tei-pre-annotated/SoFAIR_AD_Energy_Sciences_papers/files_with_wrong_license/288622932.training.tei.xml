        <p>Understanding the role of oxidation state of Cu surface and surface-adsorbed intermediate species in electrochemical CO2 reduction is crucial for the development of selective CO2-to-fuel electrocatalysts. In this study, the electrochemical CO2 reduction mechanism over the Cu catalysts with various oxidation states was studied by using in situ surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS), in situ soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (Cu L-edge) and on-line gas chromatography measurements. The atop-adsorbed CO (COatop) intermediate is obtained on the electrodeposited Cu surface which primarily has the oxidation state of Cu(I). COatop is further reduced, followed by the formation of C1 product such as CH4. The residual bridge-adsorbed CO (CObridge) is formed on the as-prepared Cu surface with Cu(0) which inhibits hydrocarbon formation. In contrast, the CV-treated Cu electrode prepared by oxidizing the as-prepared Cu surface contains different amount of Cu(I) and Cu(0) states. The major theme of this work is that in situ SEIRAS results show the coexistence of COatop and CObridge as the reaction intermediates during CO2 reduction and the selectivity of CO2-to-ethylene conversion is further enhanced in the CV-treated Cu electrode. The Cu catalysts modulated by electrochemical method exhibit different oxidation states and reaction intermediates as well as the electrocatalytic properties.Understanding the role of oxidation state of Cu surface and surface-adsorbed intermediate species in electrochemical CO2 reduction is crucial for the development of selective CO2-to-fuel electrocatalysts.

        <p>Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising route to convert CO2 into valuable hydrocarbon fuels and chemical feedstock for sustainable carbon cycles. [1][2] The catalysts capable of electrochemically reducing CO2 still suffer from many challenges such as short catalyst lifetime, high overpotential, low Faradic efficiencies (FEs) and poor product selectivity, mainly due to the multiple number of proton-coupled electron transfer steps. 3 The development of efficient and selective catalysts for CO2RR has attracted tremendous attentions. [4][5][6] Among all transition metal catalysts explored for CO2RR, copper (Cu) is the promising catalyst to produce hydrocarbons including methane (CH4) and ethylene (C2H4). [7][8] However, bulk Cu electrode exhibits high overpotentials and a lack of product selectivity. Furthermore, metallic Cu is oxidized under air easily.Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising route to convert CO2 into valuable hydrocarbon fuels and chemical feedstock for sustainable carbon cycles.

        <p>Various strategies have been used to enhance the performance of CO2RR performance by modulating the catalytic structure and physical properties of electrolyte as well as the oxidation state of Cu catalyst. 4,6,[9][10][11][12][13][14] For instance, Cu nanostructures with different particle size, particle morphology and surface area exert a great impact on the catalytic properties. [9][10][11][12][13][14] C2 products are formed over the Cu(100) electrode while Cu(111) is effective to produce C1 products, [7][8] suggesting that the facet of Cu catalyst results in different CO2 reduction mechanisms. The physical properties of electrolyte also play crucial roles in the product selectivity over the Cu electrodes. The electrolyte with different proton concentrations (pH values) influences the protonation step for the production of COOH in CO2RR. 5 The product selectivity can be enhanced over the oxide-derived Cu catalysts. 11,13,[15][16][17][18] These Cu-based materials synthesized by the reduction of thermally oxidized Cu, 19 electrodeposited Cu2O, 20 and oxygen plasma treated Cu catalysts 13,18 display a higher current density, formation of CO at low overpotentials, and improved FEs of C2H4. 18 The effect of the oxide-derived Cu catalysts on the product selectivity has been studied.Various strategies have been used to enhance the performance of CO2RR performance by modulating the catalytic structure and physical properties of electrolyte as well as the oxidation state of Cu catalyst. 4,6,[9][10][11][12][13][14] For instance, Cu nanostructures with different particle size, particle morphology and surface area exert a great impact on the catalytic properties.

        <p>The grain boundaries in oxide-derived Cu could provide unique surface sites. [21][22] Reske et al. showed that the low-coordinated atoms formed on the surface of the catalyst behave as the active sites during the oxide reduction. 9 The Cu δ+ sites remained on the oxide-derived Cu surface have also been suggested to be the active sites for CO2RR. 18,20 To further examine the effect of Cu(I) on the CO2 reduction mechanism, previous studies reported that Cu(I) sites alone do not improve the efficiencies of CO2RR. The DFT calculations proposed that the synergy between active surface Cu(I) and Cu(0) regions resulted in the adsorption of CO intermediates on different reaction sites is responsible for improving the CO dimerization. 23 However, experimental evidences are needed for the proposed model.The grain boundaries in oxide-derived Cu could provide unique surface sites.

        <p>The surface-adsorbed CO intermediates are formed during CO2RR, followed by the dimerization process of CO intermediates, which are generally regarded as the control step for CH4 and C2H4 formation. 5 In situ surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) is a powerful tool for examining the adsorbed intermediates on Cu catalysts. [24][25][26][27][28] As a result of various adsorption sites for CO molecule, previous studies on Cu surface mainly focus on the dynamic evolution of adsorbed CO and the formation of adsorbed CO including atop-adsorbed CO and bridge-adsorbed CO. 27, 29- 30 The atop-adsorbed CO has been recognized as the common intermediate on Cu surface [24][25][26][27][28] and the atop-adsorbed CO alone is observed in a variety of experimental conditions such as pH value of electrolyte, 31 and partial pressure of CO2 (or CO). 25 These Cu electrodes are electrochemically deposited on Au substrate and chemically deposited on Si prism. 26,32 In contrast, Gunathunge et al. showed that both atopadsorbed CO and bridge-adsorbed CO can be formed on the chemically deposited Cu thin film in alkaline pH electrolyte and the bridge-adsorbed CO is inactive during CO2RR. 27 In addition, these CO intermediates are also observed in electropolished Cu electrode, 30 suggesting that controlling the formation of atop-adsorbed CO and bridgeadsorbed CO on Cu surface is still challenging.

The as-prepared Cu electrode is cycled in the potential region of 0.55 to -0.3 V (inset in figure 1a). After three cycles, CV-treated Cu electrode is prepared and exhibits a larger reduction current than that of as-prepared Cu electrode in CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte. Figure 1b-c To study the oxidation state of different Cu surfaces, ex situ Cu L3-edge soft Xray absorption spectroscopy were used to reveal the changes in oxidation state of Cu electrode prepared at representative potentials with CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte. As compared to Cu K-edge hard X-ray absorption spectroscopy, the soft Xray absorption spectroscopy measurements collected in TEY mode can be used to study the oxidation state of Cu surface in a range of 2-20 nm thickness which provides surface information. [38][39] Figure 2a shows Cu L3-edge X-ray absorption spectra (XAS)-TEY mode of Cu, Cu2O and CuO electrodes as the reference spectra. 37,40 Peak A at 933.6 eV is associated with the feature of Cu(I) and peak B at 937.5 eV is assigned to the metallic Cu (Cu(0)) in Cu electrode. 37,40 2b) Thus, the XAS of as-prepared Cu electrode also exhibit Cu(I) feature before CO2RR. The existence of Cu(I) resulted from the surface oxidation of metallic copper under air conditions prior to immersion in the electrolyte has been proposed previously. [41][42] The XAS of the electrodeposited Cu electrode and CV-treated Cu electrode indicate that Cu(I) dominates the Cu surface before CO2RR and the Cu(0) feature could be embedded in the spectra.

[44][45] To further examine the effect of CV treatment on the characteristics of Cu electrode during electrochemical CO2 reduction, we next performed in situ soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements of as-prepared Cu electrode and CV-treated Cu electrode to reveal the changes in oxidation state of Cu surface during electrochemical CO2 reduction. Although the information provided by XAS-TEY mode is more surface sensitive, electrochemical soft X-ray absorption measurements can be operated in TFY mode. 46 We show the XAS-TFY mode of standard Cu electrodes in Figure S8. In situ Cu L3-edge XAS of as-prepared Cu electrode shown at representative potentials were obtained in the potential region of 0.3 and -1 V (Figure 3a). The scan rate is 2 mV s -1 during cycling and the electrolyte is CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3. Peak A at 933.6 eV associated with the feature of Cu(I) appears at 0.3 V. 41 During the CO2 reduction process, the intensity of Peak A decreases during the scan from 0.3 to -1 V, indicating that the oxidation state of Cu surface changes from Cu(I) to metallic Cu. The oxidation state of as-prepared Cu electrode persists Cu(0) during the backward scan from -1 to 0.3 V. In contrast, in situ Cu L3-edge XAS of CV-treated Cu (after three CV-treated cycles) still exhibit the combination of Cu(I) and Cu(0) feature during cycling (Figure 3b). 3c). In contrast, Figure 3d shows that the feature of Cu(I) obtained at 0.3 V becomes weaker during cycling.Although Cu K-edge XAS involve the information about the oxidation state of bulk Cu metal (&gt;2 μm), 43 extended X-Ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) obtained on the as-prepared Cu electrode shows the peak at 2.2 Å which is assigned to the Cu-Cu bond. [44][45] To further examine the effect of CV treatment on the characteristics of Cu electrode during electrochemical CO2 reduction, we next performed in situ soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements of as-prepared Cu electrode and CV-treated Cu electrode to reveal the changes in oxidation state of Cu surface during electrochemical CO2 reduction. Although the information provided by XAS-TEY mode is more surface sensitive, electrochemical soft X-ray absorption measurements can be operated in TFY mode. 46 We show the XAS-TFY mode of standard Cu electrodes in Figure S8. In situ Cu L3-edge XAS of as-prepared Cu electrode shown at representative potentials were obtained in the potential region of 0.3 and -1 V (Figure 3a). The scan rate is 2 mV s -1 during cycling and the electrolyte is CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3.

        <p>We found that the reduction of Cu(I) to Cu(0) in CV-treated Cu is much slower, suggesting that the reduction of oxidation state over these Cu electrodes is a timedependent process during CO2 reduction. In order to understand the effect of valance state of Cu surface on the CO2 reduction mechanism, we used in situ surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) to identify the intermediates formed on different Cu surface during CO2 reduction. IR spectra were collected every 100 mV during a potential step.We found that the reduction of Cu(I) to Cu(0) in CV-treated Cu is much slower, suggesting that the reduction of oxidation state over these Cu electrodes is a timedependent process during CO2 reduction.

        <p>In contrast, Figure 4b shows the in situ SEIRA spectra of as-prepared Cu electrode, clearly revealing peak B at 1832 cm -1 during negative scan.

Similar potentialdependent behavior of surface-adsorbed CObridge has been reported on Cu. 27 The blueshift in vibrational frequency of CObridge is ascribed to the decrease in the dipoledipole interaction among CObridge molecules and/or electron back-donation from the Cu surface to the CObridge molecules. 27,49 Peak C is associated with the H-O-H bending mode of adsorbed water on the Cu surface and peak D is assigned to HCO2 -. 35 50-51 The irreversible changes in the adsorption behavior of adsorbed water during cycling is consistent with previous studies. 35 The role of adsorbed water in CO2 reduction mechanism is discussed in supporting information.In contrast, Figure 4b shows the in situ SEIRA spectra of as-prepared Cu electrode, clearly revealing peak B at 1832 cm -1 during negative scan.

        <p>Interestingly, in situ SEIRA spectra of CV-treated Cu electrode show the formation of both COatop and CObridge during CO2 reduction, suggesting that CO2 reduction mechanism over the as-prepared Cu surface is changed after the CV treatment (Figure 2c). Although porous Cu materials effectively enhance vibrational signatures of surface adsorbates, which allows us to probe surface species, 52 the AFM images of as-prepared Cu surface and CV-treated Cu surface (after three CV-treated cycles) show a similar roughness of the Cu surfaces and the IR intensities of CObridge-associated peaks obtained over the two Cu electrodes are the same. Thus, the appearance of COatop in CV-treated Cu surface resulted from different plasmonic absorption properties of Cu surface can be excluded. In addition, peak E associated with COO -is formed, followed by the formation of COatop and CObridge. The intensity of peak E decreases in further reduction. Peak assignments are summarized in Table 1. 24-29, 50-51, 53-54 Figure S10 shows the in situ SEIRA spectrum of CV-treated Cu electrode obtained at -1 V, exhibiting that both CObridge and COatop adsorbed on the Cu surface.

        <p>The fact that COatop can be removed from the surface without the applied potential suggests that the formation of COatop on the Cu surface is a dynamic adsorption process.The fact that COatop can be removed from the surface without the applied potential suggests that the formation of COatop on the Cu surface is a dynamic adsorption process.</p>

The COatop-associated peak is observed at -0.6 V and drastically increases from -0.6 to -1 V in electrodeposited Cu electrode (Figure 5a). The peak associated with COO -appears at -0.4 V and gradually increases in further reduction. Figure 5b shows that CObridge-associated peak appears at -0.4 V in the as-prepared Cu electrode, while COatop-associated peak is absent during the CO2 reduction. Notably, both CObridge and COatop-associated peaks are obtained in the CV-treated Cu electrode which could be related to the formation of different final products (Figure 5c). We next study the formation of CObridge and COatop species during continuous cycles. Figure 6a-b shows the in situ SEIRAS of as-prepared Cu electrode obtained in the 3rd cycle and the 4th cycle of CO2 reduction process (after CV-treated cycles). The reference spectrum is obtained at 0.3 V before the CO2 reduction. The CObridgeassociated peak resulted from the residual CObridge on the Cu surface is observed at 0.3 V before the third cycle (Figure 6a). The CObridge-associated peak redshifts during the negative scan and blueshifts during the backward scan between 0.3 V and -1 V, indicating that the adsorption behavior of residual CObridge is the same during continuous cycles.Table 1.

        <p>Figure 6c shows the potential-dependence of intensity of CObridge and COatopassociated peaks during continuous four cycles.

        <p>The intensity of CObridge-associated peak rises at -0.5 V during negative scan and keeps increasing during backward scan until -0.3 V, suggesting that residual CObridge species is formed on the surface. The total amount of residual CObridge increases from the first to third cycle. After CV treatment, the COatop-associated peak appears during the CO2 reduction, which could be related to the formation of Cu(I). The intensity of CObridgeassociated peak drops, suggesting that CObridge can be removed from Cu surface during Cu oxidation process. 27 Possible reasons for the growth of residual CObridge during cycles are proposed as followings. (1) The increase in surface roughness of Cu electrode could provide more surface area for CObridge adsorption during cycling. Although AFM images show that the surface roughness of as-prepared Cu electrodes is similar before and after three CVtreated cycles in the potential range of -0.3 and 0.55 V (Fig. 1b-c), the surface reconstruction of as-prepared Cu electrode could only take place at the atomic level. In addition, AFM image of the surface morphology of CV-treated Cu electrode (after 100 CV-treated cycles) shows that the surface becomes rougher. (Fig. S11) (2) In situ SEIRA spectra of Cu electrodes show that the peaks associated with δHOH bending mode of adsorbed water appear during the negative scan and maintain during the backward scan, 35 which is most likely due to the irreversible changes of the Cu surface. (3) The increase in the amount of residual CObridge is similar during each cycle, suggesting that CObridge species occupy a portion of Cu surface. Polycrystalline Cu electrode reconstructs and forms Cu (111) and Cu (100) facets in the electrolyte [55][56] and COinduced surface reconstruction has been reported. 47 Thus, the irreversible surface reconstruction could lead to form more favorable sites for CObridge adsorption during cycling. In order to study the persistence of the different CO species during CO2 reduction, we examined the SEIRA spectra of CV-treated Cu electrode obtained with time, during a holding-potential at -0.9 V. Figure 7a shows the in situ SEIRA spectra of CV-treated Cu electrode and that obtained after holding the potential at -0.9 V for 60 min. The CObridge and COatop-associated peaks are absent at 0.3 V and these peaks appear after stepping the potential from 0.3 to -0.9 V. Figure 7b shows the time dependence of the CObridge and COatop-associated peak intensities at -0.9 V. The intensity of CObridgeassociated peak reaches maximum in ~30 min and remains at -0.9 V. In contrast, the intensity of COatop-associated peak increases in the first 15 min and then decreases with the time. The decrease in the intensity of COatop suggests that COatop leaves the surface easily and COatop adsorption is a dynamic process. The XAS of CV-treated Cu electrode obtained during a potential hold at -0.9 V mainly exhibit Cu(I) feature for the first 15 min which is due to the slow reduction of Cu(I). After holding the potential at -0.9 V for 60 min, the oxidation state of Cu surface changes from Cu(I) to Cu(0). In addition, only small amount of C2 product such as C2H4 can be produced at even higher overpotential, which is consistent with previous studies. 25 The major CO2 reduction products over the as-prepared Cu electrode are H2, CO and HCOOH at -1 V, with the FEs being 50 %, 5 %, and 10 % at - 1 V, respectively. H2 becomes the dominant product, indicating that the high FE toward hydrogen evolution reaction is observed in as-prepared Cu electrode and less hydrocarbon products can be formed. In order to provide a significant effect of CV treatment on the final product analysis, the CV-treated Cu electrode is prepared after 100 CV-treated cycles for the on-line GC measurements. The CV-treated Cu electrode (after 100 CV-treated cycles) produces more hydrocarbon species such as C2H4 (FE= 40 %) and CH4 (FE= 35 %), suggesting that the presence of CObridge and COatop leads to form different products. The improved selectivity can be observed even with less CV-treated cycles (Figure S12).The intensity of CObridge-associated peak rises at -0.5 V during negative scan and keeps increasing during backward scan until -0.3 V, suggesting that residual CObridge species is formed on the surface.

        <p>In addition, similar FE of HCOOH is obtained over the three Cu catalysts at -1 V, suggesting that the oxidation state of Cu and formation of CO species could have less effect on the formation of HCOOH. 13 The lower total FE (~65 %) of major products obtained in the as-prepared Cu electrode could result from the formation of residual CO (CObridge) on as-prepared Cu surface at -1 V shown in We next discuss the possible reasons for the improved CO2 reduction catalyzed by CV-treated Cu electrode. Previous studies showed that C2 products are favored on dendritic or branched copper materials. 11,14 The branched copper oxide nanoparticles exhibited a high FE of ethylene (FE= 70%) and a hydrogen FE of 30% without any byproducts in a neutral aqueous solution. 11 Also, the surface morphology of Cu electrode has been proposed to change the CO2 reduction pathway. The surface reorganization of Cu(polycrystalline) surface to Cu(polycrystalline)-[Cu(100)] surface is a general phenomenon at the negative potential [55][56] and Cu(100) surface requires the lower overpotential to reduce CO2 to C2H4. [57][58] However, the CV-treated Cu electrode exhibits similar surface morphology before and after CO2 reduction (Fig. 1c, Fig. S11 and Fig. S13). Fig. S14 shows that the FEs of methane and ethylene products catalyzed by CV-treated Cu electrode (after three CV-treated cycles) decrease with the time after holding the potential at -1 V. The decreases in the product selectivity with time are not consistent with surface reorganization of Cu(100) for favorable CO2-to-ethylene conversion. Moreover, the product distributions obtained in the CV-treated Cu catalysts and dendritic or branched copper materials are different. Thus, the product distributions are not fully correlated with the changes in surface morphology in the present study.In addition, similar FE of HCOOH is obtained over the three Cu catalysts at -1 V, suggesting that the oxidation state of Cu and formation of CO species could have less effect on the formation of HCOOH. 13 The lower total FE (~65 %) of major products obtained in the as-prepared Cu electrode could result from the formation of residual CO (CObridge) on as-prepared Cu surface at -1 V shown in We next discuss the possible reasons for the improved CO2 reduction catalyzed by CV-treated Cu electrode.

        <p>The role of Cu oxidation state has been examined in the product selectivity. We prepared Cu electrodes with the oxidation state of Cu(0) (i.e., as-prepared Cu electrode), Although surface-adsorbed CObridge has been considered as the irreversible CO species, which is inert to the reduction reaction, 27 our results suggest that CObridge might play an important role in producing the C2 products in the presence of COatop. Quantum mechanics method was used to validate a unique catalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction. 23 Xiao et al. proposed that the selectivity and activity of C2 products are enhanced at the borders of oxidized and metallic surface regions. 23 Based on their proposed model, two CO species including CObridge and COatop adsorbed on Cu(0) and Cu(I) regions are negatively and positively charged, respectively, which assist the CO dimerization and form valuable chemicals products (HCOx). Thus, the theoretical model might correlate with the coexistence of CObridge and COatop intermediates for the improved formation of C2 product in the CV-treated Cu electrode.The role of Cu oxidation state has been examined in the product selectivity.

        <p>The COatop intermediate species is formed on the surface and the formation of C1 hydrocarbon product is obtained during further reduction. As-prepared Cu electrode exhibits the oxidation state of Cu(0). The CObridge is formed on the surface and inhibits the formation of hydrocarbon product. In contrast, the CV-treated Cu electrode shows the coexistence of Cu(I) and Cu(0) and forms both COatop and CObridge during CO2 reduction. The enhanced C2 product selectivity is also obtained. Thus, oxidation state of Cu catalysts affects the electrocatalytic properties of interface and modulates the CO2 reduction mechanism. Our findings provide a strategy for designing more selective Cu electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction.The COatop intermediate species is formed on the surface and the formation of C1 hydrocarbon product is obtained during further reduction. As-prepared Cu electrode exhibits the oxidation state of Cu(0). The CObridge is formed on the surface and inhibits the formation of hydrocarbon product.
