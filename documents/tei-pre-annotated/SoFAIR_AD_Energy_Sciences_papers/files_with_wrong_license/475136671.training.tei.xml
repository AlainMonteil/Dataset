        <p>The organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is an effective technology for power generation from temperatures of up to 400 o C and for capacities of up to 10 MWel. The use of solar irradiation for driving an ORC is a promising renewable energy technology due to the high compatibility between the operating temperatures of solar thermal collector technologies and the temperature needs of the cycle. The objective of this review paper is to present and discuss the operation principles of solar-ORC technology and the wide range of solar-ORC systems that have been studied in the literature. Various solar thermal technologies that can drive the ORC are investigated, such as the flat plate collector, evacuated tube collector, compound parabolic collector, parabolic trough collector, linear Fresnel reflectors, dish concentrators and solar towers. Both simulation studies and experimental investigations are included in the study. Hybrid systems and different thermal storage techniques are also examined in detail. Moreover, systems with ORC which produce many useful outputs such as cooling, heating and fresh water are studied because they present high sustainability indexes. The limitations of the technology are also highlighted, along with critical suggestions aimed at steering future research in this field. The final conclusions indicate that the development of trigeneration and polygeneration systems with ORC sub-systems is a promising avenue, not only for the future development of solar-ORC technology but also for the development of renewable and sustainable energy systems in a broader context.</p>
        <p>Renewable energy is a fast-growing and increasingly competitive alternative to fossil fuels [1]. Solar energy can be converted to electrical energy using different technologies such as photovoltaic (PV) panels or thermal power plants. Solar thermal power plants are based on thermodynamic cycles such as the Rankine cycle (RC) and the Brayton cycle, amongst others. Solar collectors deliver heat to these power cycles and can be divided into two categories, namely non-concentrating and concentrating collectors. Concentrating collectors have a small receiver aperture area relative to the concentrator aperture area, are usually used in applications with medium or high-temperature needs and have to track the sun in order to achieve proper concentration. Non-concentrating technologies can operate without tracking and can be used in lowtemperature applications.</p>
        <p>In general, power cycles can be categorised into gas/single-phase (such as Brayton) and vapour/two-phase (such as Rankine) cycles. In its simplest form, the RC consists of four basic components: a pump, an evaporator, a turbine and a condenser (see Fig. 1). The working fluid is circulated by using a pump (process 1-2), it absorbs heat at constant pressure in the evaporator (process 2-3), produces power by expansion in the turbine (process 3-4) and rejects heat at constant pressure in the condenser (process 4-1). This thermodynamic cycle can operate with various working fluids including water, organic fluids and CO2. The working fluid has to change phase within a specific temperature range and therefore gases, such as air and nitrogen, are not used in the cycle.</p>
        <p>The organic Rankine cycle (ORC) uses an organic working fluid. The organic fluids have lower critical temperatures than water and are therefore more suitable for low and medium-temperature heat sources such as solar systems. An important advantage of ORC systems is that they can be applied at smaller scales compared to water/steam RC systems. Besides solar energy, other renewable and sustainable energy sources can be coupled to ORC such as geothermal, biomass and industrial waste heat. Generally, the optimum temperature compatibility between these sources and organic fluids makes the use of ORC an ideal candidate for future sustainable energy systems [2].</p>
        <p>The ORC is a developing technology that is usually found in Europe, the USA, China, and Japan. There are over 25 companies that develop ORC projects with various capacities. Usually, the ORC capacity is in the ranger of 10 kWel up to 150 kWel [3], while there are cases up to 240 MWel [4]. Among the manufacturers, the companies with the greater number of projects are ORMAT, Turboden, Exergy, General Electric and Turbine Air Systems [3]. The first ORCs have been installed in the 80s, while the worldwide capacity has an increasing rate from 2004 and later. In 2017, there were about 700 projects of ORC worldwide with a cumulative capacity of 2.7 GWel, while every year there is an increase in capacity of about 250 MWel [3].</p>
        <p>A basic ORC system is shown in Fig. 2a. The cycle includes a heat recovery system (HRS), a turbine, a condenser and a pump. The HRS is fed with heat input from an energy source to increase the enthalpy of the working fluid. The working fluid is a subcooled liquid at the HRS inlet (State 2) and it becomes a superheated vapour at the outlet of the HRS (State 3). Inside the HRS, there are three sections; the economiser, evaporator and superheater. In the economiser, the subcooled liquid changes into a saturated liquid (State 21). The evaporator is responsible for the latent heat exchange so that a saturated vapour can be produced (State 22), while the superheater produces a superheated vapour (State 3). In the ORC system, the superheating component is generally small and in some cases, no superheating is performed. For dry refrigerants, superheating is not beneficial or only beneficial in small amounts (5 to 10 K), because of the positive slope of its T-s curve [5]. The superheated vapour (State 3) enters the turbine where it is expanded to low pressure (State 4). The condenser is responsible for heat rejection to the ambient so that a saturated liquid of low pressure (at State 1) can be produced. The saturated liquid enters the liquid pump where the pressure is increased with a small amount of work consumption (but not negligible), to complete the cycle. The complete thermodynamic process is illustrated in Fig. 2b.</p>
        <p>The heat transfer in the HRS is described in Fig. 3. A critical parameter of the HRS design is the pinch point. This parameter refers to the minimum temperature difference between the heat source stream and the organic fluid in the HRS (usually between 5 K and 20 K [6,7]). The possible pinch point locations in the HRS are given in Fig. 3, which shows the temperature-heat transfer rate (T-Q) diagram of the process. The three possible pinch point locations are the economiser inlet, the superheater outlet and inbetween the economiser and the evaporator. For cases with a high heat source temperature, the pinch point is usually found at the economiser inlet, while for a very low heat source temperature, the pinch point is at the superheater outlet. It is most common for the pinch point to be between the economiser and the evaporator.</p>
        <p>Various environmentally friendly, non-flammable and non-toxic organic fluids have been investigated to find high thermodynamic performance. Tchanche et al. [8] investigated the performance of a solar-ORC using low-temperature solar collectors together with the following environmentally friendly working fluids: RC318, R600a, R114, R600, R601, R113, Cyclohexane, R290, R407C, R32, R500, R152a, R717, Ethanol, Methanol, R718, R134a, R12, R123 and R141b. The results indicated that R134a is the most appropriate. Rayegan and Tao [9] developed a methodology for working fluid selection in solar-ORC systems with similar working conditions. They suggested a method to select ORC working fluids based on different parameters such as their molecular components, temperature-entropy diagram and effects on the thermal efficiency, net power generated, vapour expansion ratio, and exergy efficiency of the ORC systems. Their results suggested eleven working fluids for application in low to medium temperature solar-ORC systems. Prasad et al. [10] investigated a solar-ORC system with different multicomponent zeotropic mixtures in an effort to reduce cost while maintaining high thermal efficiency. They presented a method to select appropriate working fluid mixtures that can reduce the volume of the expander while maintaining the highest performance. Desai et al. [11] presented a thermo-economic analysis of a solar-ORC system for power generation. Linear solar concentrators were used to deliver heat to the ORC system which was investigated using different working fluids. Li et al. [12] also investigated different working fluids. Direct vapour generation was used in the proposed system for power generation. Freeman et al. [13] investigated a hybrid system for heating and power generation using solar-ORC. As a case study, the performance of the system was optimised for the UK using different ORC working fluids. They reported an efficiency improvement of over 50% with an optimised system using a suitable ORC working fluid. Zheng et al. [14] considered a solar-ORC system as an energy source in refrigeration. The performance of the solar-ORC system was investigated using eight pure fluids and five zeotropic mixtures with various compositions as the ORC working fluid. Using a mixture of R161/R600a, the performance of the system was improved by 39.6% and 54.7%, when compared to using pure R600a and R161, respectively. Furthermore, Györke et al. [15] presented a new classification based on characteristic points of organic fluids used as ORC working fluids.</p>
        <p>To conclude, there is a lot of research about the proper selection of the working fluids in the ORC. Except for the thermodynamic characteristics and the thermal properties of the fluids which have an important influence on the efficiency, there are extra factors that affect the final selection of the fluids.</p>
        <p>Environmental criteria like global warming potential, ozone depletion potential, as well as toxicity and flammability have to be considered. Moreover, the stability of the used working fluids is an extra factor that has to be taken into account. The chemical stability issues create limitations about the maximum possible temperature of the heat source and this fact has to be taken into consideration [16]. In the literature, there are several studies about stability issues. For example, Ginosar et al. [17] found that the cyclopentane is a safe working fluid without stability issues. Other literature studies have emphasized the need for conducting stability studies about siloxanes. Preißinger and Brüggemann [18] concluded that the working fluid MM, which belongs to siloxanes, is stable up to 300 o C. Finally, it has to be stated that the working fluids selection process is a trade-off among energy efficiency calculations, environmental issues and safety aspects.</p>
        <p>ORC systems are usually driven by heat sources at low or medium temperatures. Different types of energy sources can be used to deliver heat to an ORC system including waste heat, geothermal, solar, biomass, biodiesel, and biogas. Solar energy is converted to thermal energy using solar collectors. A solar collector can be considered as a heat exchanger for converting solar energy to thermal energy of the working fluid. Generally, there are two kinds of solar-ORC systems: direct and indirect. With the indirect solar-ORC system, solar energy is absorbed by a solar working fluid that circulates in the solar collector.</p>
        <p>The absorbed heat is then transferred to the organic fluid in a heat exchanger. With the direct solar-ORC system, the organic fluid circulates in the solar collector to absorb solar energy directly.</p>
        <p>The heat transfer rate in the HRS (Qin) can be calculated from an energy balance on the working fluid control volume, where m refers to the mass flow rate and (h) refers to enthalpy:</p>
        <p>(1) 𝑄 in = 𝑚 ⋅ (ℎ 3 -ℎ 2 )</p>
        <p>The power generation in the turbine (WT) is calculated as:</p>
        <p>(2) 𝑊 T = 𝑚 ⋅ (ℎ 3 -ℎ 4 )</p>
        <p>The electricity production by the shaft (Pel) is calculated as:</p>
        <p>(3) 𝑃 el = 𝜂 mg ⋅ 𝑊 T Usually, the turbine process is modelled using an isentropic efficiency (ηis,T) as shown below:</p>
        <p>The heat rejection rate from the condenser to the ambient (Qout) is calculated as:</p>
        <p>(5)</p>
        <p>The power consumption in the pump (Wp) is calculated as:</p>
        <p>𝜂 𝑚𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑟 The net electricity production of the ORC (Pel,net) is calculated as:</p>
        <p>The thermal efficiency of the ORC (ηorc) is calculated as:</p>
        <p>It should be noted that the heat input in the ORC (Qin) is not equal to the total heat source input in the system (Qhs). The heat source input is higher than the heat input in the ORC unit because of the inevitable thermal losses in the intermediate devices (Qhs &gt; Qin). The conversion efficiency of the heat source (ηth) can be written as shown below:</p>
        <p>(9) 𝜂 th = 𝑄 in 𝑄 hs</p>
        <p>The total system efficiency (ηsys) is therefore given as:</p>
        <p>The conversion efficiency of the heat source is variable and dependent on the type of heat source. For a boiler system with biomass, for example, the conversion efficiency can be up to 94% [19]. In the case of a solar system, the conversion efficiency depends on operating parameters (fluid temperature, solar irradiation level, solar angle, etc.) and can be up to 75% [20]. In the case of waste heat recovery (WHR), the conversion efficiency can be written in terms of the ambient temperature (Tam) as:</p>
        <p>(11) 𝜂 th (𝑊𝐻𝑅) = 𝑇 hs,out -𝑇 hs,in 𝑇 hs,out -𝑇 am</p>
        <p>Another critical parameter for the proper characterisation of the ORC unit is exergy efficiency. The exergy efficiency practically evaluates the quality of the heat source. The exergy efficiency of the system can be generally written as shown below:</p>
        <p>(12) 𝜂 ex,sys = 𝑃 el,net 𝑄 hs ⋅ 𝜓 hs</p>
        <p>The exergy factor of the heat source (ψhs) depends on the type of energy source. The exergy factor of fossil fuels depends on its composition and generally, it has values of close to 1. For a gas flow stream, it has the following expression:</p>
        <p>For solar irradiation, there are various correlations that can be used in order to take into consideration that the sun is a radiation reservoir and not a heat reservoir. The equation that has been suggested by Petela is commonly used in the literature [21]:</p>
        <p>The sun's temperature (Tsun) is usually chosen to be close to 5800 K. Note that for all exergy factors the temperature unit is Kelvin.</p>
        <p>Solar energy is a sustainable energy source and ORC is a proper candidate to be combined with solar energy systems. The reason for this compatibility between solar systems and ORC is based on the operating temperatures of up to 400 o C or 500 o C, at which ORC operates optimally. Thus, solar-energy-driven ORC is an attractive technology for developing sustainable future energy systems. The objective of this review paper is to summarise and discuss research that has been done on solar-ORCs. The review paper considers various solar collectors, but with more emphasis on indirect systems. Moreover, hybrid systems with solar and geothermal energy are included in this work because they often appear in literature and have promising performance results.</p>
        <p>An ORC engine can be coupled with various solar collectors because the power cycle can operate in a large range of heat source temperatures from 80°C to 500°C. The cycle can, therefore, be coupled with flat solar technologies or concentrating solar technologies. In the following sections, the most common solar technologies that can be used in ORC systems are briefly presented. Barber [22] technically and economically investigated the solar-ORC system as an efficient technology for power generation using three categories: flat-plate collectors, solar concentrators, and tracking solar concentrators. Fig. 4 illustrates the possible solar technologies for utilisation in ORC systems. Furthermore, Table 1 includes the main characteristics of solar collectors [23][24][25]. Each collector type has a specific operating temperature range which dictates the organic fluid temperature range in the ORC. Consequently, there is a need for selecting the appropriate organic fluid with each solar technology in order to have optimum temperature compatibility.</p>
        <p>The FPC is a non-concentrating technology that operates at temperatures of up to 100°C. The FPC is the most common solar system for low-temperature applications. For operation at temperatures of close to 100°C, an optimal design is required using selective absorbers and proper insulation at the back and side surfaces. An FPC consists of an absorber plate with water tubes (risers) located in an insulated box with a glass cover as the top surface. The FPC does not require tracking and usually, its inclination is chosen for optimal seasonal or annual operation [26]. Lastly, an FPC utilises both diffuse and beam solar irradiation.</p>
        <p>b) Evacuated tube collector (ETC): ETC consists of many evacuated tubes connected to a manifold. Usually, up to 10-12 evacuated tubes are used in the collector module. The collector can be used in low and medium-temperature applications of up to 200ºC . A booster reflector can be positioned behind the evacuated tubes in order to reduce the optical losses due to the space between the tubes. The design can therefore usually have a low concentration ratio of up to 1.2. An ETC is typically also a non-tracking collector with an inclination chosen for optimum seasonal exploitation of the solar resource. Both the beam and the diffuse solar irradiation resources are utilised.</p>
        <p>CPC is a non-imaging solar concentrating technology [27] for low and medium temperature applications of up to 200°C . It consists of an evacuated tube and a parabolic-shaped reflector. The reflector can consist of three parts: two parabolic shapes and a connection between them. The CPC primarily exploits solar beam irradiation but it also captures partial diffuse solar irradiation. The concentration ratio of this collector can be up to 5 with typical values of around 3 [28].</p>
        <p>PTC is the most mature solar concentrating technology and is used in the majority of operating power plants [29]. It consists of an evacuated tube and a parabolic-shaped linear trough reflector. It has a concentration ratio in the range of 10 to 50 and can, therefore, be classified as an imaging solar concentrating technology that only utilises the direct beam solar irradiation. It can operate at temperatures of up to 500ºC and usually, the working fluids are thermal oils, molten salts, or water/steam at high pressure. This collector relies on a one-axis tracking system in order to follow the sun's path during operation.</p>
        <p>e) Linear Fresnel reflector (LFR): LFR is a linear concentrating technology similar to the PTC but it has segmented primary mirrors. The primary mirrors are located close to the ground in order to reduce mechanical difficulties and wind loads [30,31]. This collector utilises solar beam irradiation and requires a single-axis tracking system. Generally, the receiver can be an evacuated tube with a secondary reflector; however, trapezoidal cavity designs also exist. The receiver is located about 3-4 m above the ground and does not move [32]. The LFR has a lower cost than the PTC but it also has lower efficiency due to higher optical losses. The concentration ratio of this technology is usually in the range of 10 to 40, while it can operate at temperatures of up to 400ºC .</p>
        <p>f) Solar dish collector (SDC): SDC consists of a solar dish concentrator with a thermal receiver that produces heat at medium and high temperatures. Usually, cavity receivers are used and the concentration ratio is over 100 [33]. The cavity can be cylindrical, conical, spherical, or rectangular [34]. The SDC only utilises solar beam irradiation and requires a two-axis tracking system to create a focal point. Applications with Stirling engines are common.</p>
        <p>g) Solar tower (ST): STs (or central receivers) are usually large solar systems consisting of numerous heliostats and a tower with a receiver mounted at its top. These systems are only used for hightemperature applications and generally for power generation. The technology can be regarded as costeffective since new solar power plants are usually based on it. The ST only utilises solar beam irradiation, using a two-axis tracking system on every heliostat mirror, and can operate at temperatures of up to 1000ºC .</p>
        <p>3 Solar-ORC systems Solar energy is a flexible energy source that can be converted into heat at various temperatures, depending on the technology [35]. In the literature, there are many studies about solar-ORCs with nonconcentrating technologies [36,37], while there is also a great deal of work on concentrating technologies [38][39][40]. The use of concentrating collectors corresponds to higher temperature ranges and higher thermodynamic efficiencies in the ORC; however, this also presents difficulties such as tracking the sun and storing the heat efficiently. In this section, all the studies found in the literature are presented and discussed in detail.</p>
        <p>A review of literature available on FPC-ORC technology is presented in this section. These studies consider low-temperature systems that present relatively low efficiencies but with the advantage of mature technology, low investment cost and low complexity. In 1983, Eldighidy and Taha [41] performed a study on the optimisation of the FPC by testing different tube diameters and working fluids such as R11, R21 and R113. They found that higher flow rates enhanced the system's performance and that the overall system efficiency was 6%. Marion et al. [42] investigated single and double glazing FPC as well as different organic fluids (R134a, R227ea, and R365mfc) in the ORC. By optimising their system they found a maximum efficiency of 11%. The use of a solar-ORC in a regenerative cycle was examined by Wang et al. [43]. The configuration included a storage system (see Fig. 5). It was concluded that R123 was the best fluid with a system efficiency of 7.8%. The impact of wind speed on an FPC-ORC was investigated by Marion et al. [44]. They found that a wind speed increase from 0 m/s to 10 m/s reduced the collector's thermal efficiency from 48% to 34% and consequently reduced the system efficiency from 6.9% to 3.1%. In a financial analysis, Hajabdollahi et al. [45] found that isobutene was the best choice for the regenerative solar-ORC system. In another work, Kutlu et al. [46] performed an off-design investigation of a solar-ORC with evacuated FPC. The evacuated FPC can achieve operation at higher temperatures compared to conventional FPCs. It was concluded that the system could be controlled with the mass flow rate to produce up to 5.7 kW of electricity. The combination of a solar-ORC system and a heat pump for power generation was investigated by Schimpf and Span [47,48]. It was found that the system had economic benefit and isobutene was suggested as a more efficient choice than R134a.</p>
        <p>An interesting idea in the literature is the use of mixtures as ORC working fluids in order to optimise heat transfer and to reduce exergy destruction. Mavrou et al. [49] found that a mixture of neopentane and 2fluoromethoxy-2-methylpropane at 70% neopentane was the most appropriate choice for an ORC with a system efficiency of 4.9%. Habka and Ajib [50] conducted a comparative study between pure fluids and mixtures. They concluded that the R409A mixture was a better candidate than the pure fluids, R134a and R245fa. In another working fluid investigation by Helvaci and Khan [51], 1-butene was found to be the best organic working fluid for the solar-ORC.</p>
        <p>The use of a phase-change material (PCM) for storage purposes in a solar-ORC was investigated by Freeman et al. [52]. They found a 20% daily efficiency enhancement by using the PCM thermal energy storage (TES). Alvi et al. [53] compared the direct and indirect solar-ORC systems for power generation. PCM was used as the TES and R245fa as the ORC working fluid. It was found that the direct solar-ORC system showed better performance. Another idea in the literature is the investigation of cogeneration, trigeneration and polygeneration. Extra devices are included in these configurations such as absorption chillers, mechanical compression cycles, heat exchangers and electrolysers. Boyaghchi et al. [54] investigated a combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) system (see Fig. 6) with CuO/water nanofluid as the working fluid in the solar collector. They concluded that the R134a can be recommended as the best ORC working fluid with energy and exergy efficiencies of 39.8% and 3.1% respectively. Calise et al. [55] found that an evacuated FPC in a cogeneration system (electricity and heat) leads to a payback period of 5 years. In another work, Wang et al. [56] optimised a trigeneration system for heating, cooling and electricity. They found daily energy and exergy efficiencies of 13.6% and 9.2% respectively. Erden et al. [57] investigated a solar-ORC system for hydrogen production and power generation. FPCs and solar ponds were used as the heat source (see Fig. 7). It was found that hydrogen production increased when the thermal performance of the solar system increased. Khanmohammadi et al. [58] performed an optimisation study of a cogeneration system for power and hydrogen production. An exergy efficiency enhancement of up to 3.2% was found. Ramos et al. [59] optimised different subsystems of a solar-ORC system for combined heat and power generation (CHP). Different solar collectors were investigated including FPC and ETC. The simulations were performed with the 
            <rs type="software">TRNSYS</rs> software. It was found that the ORC system with ETC showed the highest performance but it also presents higher investment cost. Moreover, R245fa and R1233zd organic fluids were found to be the best choices. Vittorini et al. [60] studied a CHP micro-cogeneration system. They used water/glycol mixture with temperatures of up to 110 o C. Wang and Chen [61] examined a system with a solar-driven modified ORC, which includes an ejector, and that can also produce refrigeration. They found system performance enhancement (efficiency of 21%). A trigeneration system driven by FPC was optimised by Boyaghchi and Chavoshi [62]. Nanofluid-based FPC and R1234yf-R245fa in the ORC were investigated. According to their results, the energy efficiency enhancement was 17% and the exergy efficiency enhancement 24%. Lastly, Rashidi and Khorshidi [63] optimised a polygeneration system that included an ORC, absorption chiller and reverse osmosis (RO) device. The best-compromised solution was found at an exergy efficiency of 53%. A summary of solar-ORC systems using FPCs is presented in Table 2. To conclude, a number of articles investigating FPCs as the heat source of an ORC were considered. Some of the articles studied a simple system and investigated its productivity as a function of certain parameters. The energy efficiency of a simple system appears to be 8% to 10% at most. Other studies made an effort to increase the productivity of systems by adding storage tanks; in this case, the capital cost increased by up to 30%. Moreover, polygeneration coupled with FPCs that can generate electricity, heating and cooling increased the overall efficiency by up to 40% or more. A large proportion of studies employed multi-objective optimisation tools to find the optimum points at which the system would yield maximum exergy efficiency and minimum cost. Regarding the working fluid, there are several papers focusing on working fluids and their mixtures to obtain the best performance and minimum detrimental effects on the environment. Throughout the reviewed studies, only a few authors focused their attention on the collector and illustrated the impacts of its characteristics on the overall performance. More importantly, the effect of using FPC-ORCs on the reduction of carbon emissions has been completely ignored; regarding some global warming policies, this could have had a considerable effect on the final cost of each system.

        <p>The ETC is usually a stationary collector used in low and medium-temperature applications. The advantage of this technology compared to FPC is the possibility of operating above 100 o C; however, ETC has increased investment cost. In the literature, the combination of ETC with ORC has been investigated for power generation as well as for other useful outputs.</p>
        <p>Firstly, the works on ETC-ORC for power generation are discussed. Scardigno et al. [64] optimised a hybrid ORC system driven by solar and low-grade energy sources. The system was optimised based on achieving the highest energy and exergy performance with the lowest levelised energy cost. The lowest levelised energy cost was found at 0.114 $/kWh with the highest energy efficiency of 9.7% using cyclopropane as the ORC working fluid. Lv et al. [65] numerically and experimentally investigated a hybrid system for heating and power generation using an ETC. In another experimental work, He et al.</p>
        <p>[66] tested an ETC-ORC (see Fig. 8) which presented a maximum exergy efficiency of 36.3%.</p>
        <p>The following literature involves power and fresh water production using ETC-ORC. Manolakos et al. [67] developed a solar-ORC system coupled with a desalination system. An RO unit was used for producing fresh water using power generated from the ORC system. The ORC unit's condenser was used as a preheating system for the desalination process. The maximum system efficiency was 7% and the operating temperatures were in the range of 70-80 o C. Manolakos et al. [68][69][70] experimentally studied a solar desalination system with ETC-ORC technology for power generation. The efficiency of the expander was calculated as 14.7% and 28.5% for cloudy and sunny weather conditions respectively. Manolakos et al. [71] compared two suggested RO systems based on PV panels and solar-ORC systems under technical and economic aspects. The cost of desalination was calculated as 7.77 €/m 3 with PV and 12.5 €/m 3 with ETC-ORCs. The overall ETC-ORC system efficiency was calculated at 5%. Kosmadakis et al. [72][73][74] developed a solar desalination system that was coupled with an ORC system for power generation. The cost of the generated power was found to be 2.74 €/kWh using ETCs. Karellas et al. [75] investigated a hybrid solar desalination system including ORC and PV systems for producing fresh water and power. More specifically, it was found that the hybrid system could produce potable water at a cost of 6.52 €/m 3 when subsidised with 40% of the investment capital. In another dynamic analysis, Twomey et al. [76] studied the behaviour of an ETC-ORC with a scroll expander (with maximum isentropic efficiency of 59%). System efficiency of 3.5% was calculated.</p>
        <p>Studies about ETC-ORC for cooling are also found in the literature. Wu et al. [77] economically considered an ETC-ORC for cooling purposes. They estimated the cost of an optimised cooling unit at 0.24 € per kW of cooling power. Moreover, Ahmadzadeh et al. [78] economically and exergetically investigated a system that included power generation and an ejector refrigeration system. The optimised system obtained 19% energy efficiency while the initial system was at 15%.</p>
        <p>The last part of this section considers the literature on ETC-ORCs for the production of various useful outputs by the utilisation of extra energy devices. A polygeneration system for heating, cooling and electricity was studied by Boyaghchi and Heidarnejad [79]. The energy and exergy efficiencies were found to be 23.66% and 9.51% in summer and 48.45% and 13.76% in winter. Atiz et al. [80] investigated an ORC-hydrogen production system and reported energy and exergy efficiencies of 5.9% and 18.2% respectively for the overall system. In another investigation, Wu et al. [81] studied three different power generation systems economically and environmentally. The investigated systems were CCHP-ORC, solar-ORC, and biomass-ORC. The solar-ORC system showed the best economic performance.</p>
        <p>A summary of ETC-ORC systems is reported in Table 3. To conclude, ETC is a low and medium temperature heat source for the ORC, with an exergy efficiency of around 20% for a conventional system. Numerous studies have been conducted in order to enhance the system performance by changing the pressure and the temperature of the ORC's components. For instance, by increasing the generator pressure of a novel solar-driven combined power and ejector refrigeration system to 1540 kPa, the exergy efficiency increased to 58.9%. Furthermore, some solar-ORC systems can also contribute to generating either fresh water, with an efficiency of approximately 7%, or hydrogen. From the review above, it was found that the effect of different ORC working fluids has not been comprehensively investigated, even though it plays an indisputable role in the exergy and energy efficiency of the system. The possibility of using nanofluids in ETCs has also not been considered. For future study, it is recommended that the collector structure can be used to determine the best operating point of the solar-ORC system. From an economic point of view, far deeper hands-on research is needed to show the exact financial profits of the system in order to draw the attention of investors and governments, and in turn, future studies should focus on systems with higher capacity.</p>

        <p>The use of CPC-ORC is another alternative that has been studied extensively in the literature. The concentrator increases the solar irradiation on the receiver resulting in better performance. The CPC can operate with or without tracking. It mainly utilises solar beam irradiation but also captures part of the diffuse solar irradiation. Generally, CPCs are more efficient than ETCs but they are more complex. Jing et al. [82] numerically optimised a CPC-ORC. The CPC had a concentration ratio of around 3, the operating temperature levels were around 120 o C and the system performance was around 7.5%. They investigated the use of an alternative design with a two-stage heat exchanger that could enhance the system performance by up to 20%. Pei et al. [83] presented a new design of a regenerative ORC system using a CPC. The system included two solar loops and PCM storage. It was concluded that the system efficiency was 8.6% with regeneration and 4.9% without regeneration. Wang et al. [84] presented an off-design model of a CPC-ORC which was evaluated on a yearly basis and its efficiency was ranged between 4% and 7%. In another study, Antonelli et al. [85] designed a CPC-ORC for power generation. In Fig. 9a, the cross-section of the collector is shown with the orientation and the collector slope depicted, while in Fig. 9b the internal design of the Utube receiver is shown. It was concluded that a design with a concentration ratio in the range of 1.1 to 1.4 would lead to a yearly operation of up to 3500 h in Italy. Moreover, Antonelli et al. [86] simulated a CPC-ORC dynamically. They found that a concentration ratio of 1.25 led to an ORC efficiency of 8.2% and a system efficiency of 3.4%, while a concentration of 2 led to an ORC efficiency of 10.9% and system efficiency of 5.6%. Tiwari et al. [87] suggested a novel solar-ORC system for power generation which incorporated an asymmetrical CPC. The CPC design had a complex reflector and a glazed reverse absorber (see Fig. 10) which led to a system efficiency of close to 8%.</p>
        <p>In a comparative work, Sonsaree et al. [88] compared the use of CPC in an ORC with the use of FPC and ETC. They concluded that CPC led to the lowest LCOE of around 0.21 $/kWh, while FPC led to the highest LCOE. Li and Li [89] thermally and economically optimised a solar-ORC system based on a typical solar radiation year. They used a multi-objective genetic algorithm for optimisation. They found that the profit growth rate would increase with an increasing system scale. Lastly, Garg and Orosz [90] thermo-economically studied an ORC system with different heat sources such as solar and waste heat. The scroll expander design was emphasised and maximum isentropic efficiency of around 65% was found. The last part of this section considers studies on CPC-ORC for trigeneration or polygeneration. Bocci et al.</p>
        <p>[91] investigated a polygeneration system with the CPC area of 50 m 2 , the storage tank volume of 3 m 3 , the nominal power of 3 kW, the cooling nominal power of 8 kW and the fresh water supply of 200 L/h. They stated that the system was a promising idea but that it would need financial support from the government to be sustainable. Cioccolanti et al. [92] numerically and experimentally examined a solardriven trigeneration system. They proved that the system efficiency could be improved by 6.5% if the proper temperature levels were selected in the storage tank. In another study, Cioccolanti et al. [93] also investigated a solar-driven trigeneration system for residential applications using 
            <rs type="software">TRNSYS</rs> simulation software. A relatively low electrical efficiency was found in summer due to the operation of the absorption chiller.
        </p>
        <p>A summary of ORC systems with CPCs is presented in Table 4. To conclude, conventional CPC-ORCs have an energy efficiency of about 5%. Throughout the reviewed articles, one can observe that a large proportion of the papers are related to improving the performance of the systems by means of employing volumetric expanders, two-stage heat exchangers, or the glazed reverse absorber CPC. However, there is a lack of detailed experimental, environmental and economic assessments that leaves researchers with a vast untouched field of study.</p>

        <p>LFR is a cost-effective solar concentrating technology that has gained more and more attention in recent years. Rodat et al. [94] examined an LFR-ORC with thermocline storage which operated with synthetic oil as the working fluid (see Fig. 11a). The system was designed to operate with a collector inlet temperature of 150 o C and a collector outlet temperature of 300 o C. Cocco and Serra [95] investigated an LFR-ORC with a solar multiple of between 1.5 and 2. The LFR had a secondary reflector (see Fig. 11b).</p>
        <p>The storage capacity was optimised and a minimum LCOE of close to 420 €/MWh was found for 8 hours of storage capacity. In another work, Xu et al. [96] investigated an ORC based on direct vapour generation, using an LFR (see Fig. 12). The overall efficiency of the system was estimated at 19.7% using cyclohexane as the ORC working fluid. Petrollese and Cocco [97] optimised a solar power generation system with PV and LFR-ORC. It was found that the combination of the two solar technologies reduced the LCOE by about 30%-40% compared to the CSP-only solution. Cioccolanti et al. [98] dynamically evaluated a residential LFR-ORC with TRNSYS for the climate conditions of Cagliari in Italy. The unit had a 2 kW electricity capacity and PCM as TES. The authors found that the mean annual ORC efficiency was 7.46% while the mean annual system efficiency was 4.5%. The last part of this section considers LFR-ORC systems with cogeneration. Cocco et al. [99] investigated a cogeneration system for electricity and heating (see Fig. 13). The system included TES with molten salt and two storage tanks. The heat output was higher than the power output and the system exergy efficiency generally ranged between 7% and 11%. Boyaghchi and Sohbatloo [100] investigated a complex system with LFR-ORC for power and liquefied natural gas (LNG). The system was optimised with a multiobjective optimisation method and the final results showed that the energy and exergy efficiencies were 7.3% and 12.6% respectively. An analysis of a cogeneration unit by Cioccolanti et al. [101] with TRNSYS proved that the ORC was able to operate 5351 hours per year for the climate conditions of Italy. The yearly system efficiency was 4.5% and the ORC efficiency of 7.46%.</p>
        <p>A summary of ORC systems with LFRs is presented in Table 5. To conclude, LFR has been gaining popularity to provide energy for ORC units. The typical energy efficiency of an ORC driven by LFR is not so high. Hence, several studies focused on improving the performance by integrating heat storage, direct vapour generation, natural gas liquefaction, or PV panels into the solar-ORC system; the thermal efficiency could increase by around 30% with hybridisation. More research needs to be done, but it is possible to speculate that LFR will become one of the most practical collectors. There is a vast untouched research field for further modification and optimisation using economic, environmental and thermodynamic aspects. An interesting idea is to investigate different receivers in an LFR coupled to an ORC, as was done by Rodat et al. [102] who studied the use of a trapezoidal cavity receiver.</p>

        <p>A PTC is a linear concentrating collector which can easily operate at temperatures of up to 400 o C with thermal oil and up to 600 o C with molten salt. Moreover, the ORC technology can be coupled with a great variety of organic working fluids and can also be used in artificial polygeneration systems. Researchers usually select this collector because of its maturity, its reasonable cost and its relatively high efficiency.</p>
        <p>At this point, it has to be said that the combination of PTC with ORC can be conducted in various ways. The first way is to use a separate working fluid in the solar field (thermal oil or molten salt) in order to transfer heat to the ORC through a heat recovery system. For example, Xi et al. [103] examined the use of thermal oil to feed an ORC that produces electricity and gives heat to a bottoming polygeneration unit.</p>
        <p>The use of molten salt in a PTC-ORC system can be applied in order to operate at higher temperatures up to 600 o C [104]. Another technology is the use of PTC as the heat source is a complex system for power or polygeneration which includes a bottoming ORC for extra power production. This idea has been studied by Tukenmez et al. [105] and practically the ORC was the bottoming cycle of a Brayton cycle which operates with air as the working fluid. It is also interesting to state that there are recent studies that suggest complex designs with compressors, turbines, heat exchanges, distillation units and other devices coupled to PTC for polygeneration. Ghorbani et al. [106] examined a configuration that is like a modified complex ORC for power and fresh water production which is fed by solar energy (PTC) and LNG.</p>
        <p>Firstly, a discussion on PTC-ORCs for power generation is presented in this subsection and Table 6a summarizes the main points of these studies. In 2011, Tchanche et al. [5] presented a detailed review of the various applications of solar-ORC systems. Schuster et al. [107] energetically and economically investigated various ORC systems with different heat sources such as biomass, geothermal, and solar energy. The application of the solar-ORC system in desalination systems was proposed as an efficient way of providing drinking water in water-stressed areas. Working fluids were investigated by Roy et al. [108] who numerically optimised a non-regenerative ORC with superheating. The fluids R-12, R-123, R-134a and R-717 were tested and R-123 was found to be the best. In experimental work with a PTC-ORC (see Fig. 14), Taccani et al. [109] found that R245fa was the best working fluid which led to a system efficiency of 8%. Muñoz et al. [110] suggested a novel system for power generation using a solar Rankine-Brayton cycle. Different fluids were evaluated and the results showed that propane and R125 were the most appropriate for achieving the highest performance in the range of 30% to 40%.</p>
        <p>Quoilin et al. [111] optimised a solar-ORC by sizing different ORC components, selecting different fluids and investigating single or double stage expansion machine configurations. The overall electrical efficiency reached 8%. Tzivanidis et al. [112] optimised a PTC-ORC based on exergy and financial aspects. They reported the optimum dimensions of the solar system with cyclohexane as the most suitable working fluid, as well as a payback period of about 9 years and a system efficiency of 15%. Ashouri et al. [113] optimised a double pressure PTC-ORC with a storage tank. The system was exergo-economically investigated and maximum exergy efficiency of 22.7% was found. The use of nanofluids in the PTC field was investigated by Bellos and Tzivanidis [114]. Various nanofluids and organic fluids in the ORC were investigated in order to maximise the system's power output. The best choice was found to be toluene in the ORC and thermal oil/CuO nanofluid (with a 4% nanoparticle concentration) in the PTC. This resulted in a system efficiency of 20.11%, which was a 1.75% improvement compared to the case with pure thermal oil in the PTC field.</p>
        <p>In the literature, dynamic approaches to solar PTC-ORCs are common. He et al. [115] simulated a PTC-ORC using 
            <rs type="software">TRNSYS</rs> software. They found that the system efficiency was about 15% while the ORC efficiency was as high as 26%. Majumdar et al. [116] investigated a novel solar-ORC system using a dynamic moving boundary model that was developed for medium-temperature collectors. A time-dependent model was developed for the variation of heat transfer fluid temperature. The overall system efficiency was estimated to be 21%. Ni et al. [117] investigated a solar-ORC system under cloudy weather conditions using a dynamic model. A PID control strategy was suggested for the system. The performance of the system was improved by 24% when using the suggested PID control strategy.
        </p>
        <p>An important part of the literature is comparative studies between different configurations. Desai and Bandyopadhyay [118] compared the water/steam RC with the ORC financially and energetically using PTC and LFR. They concluded that the LCOE for the water/steam RC was 0.353$/kWh with PTC and 0.422 $/kWh with LFR, while the LCOE for PTC-ORC was 0.344 $/kWh. However, in another work, Desai and Bandyopadhyay [119] found the LCOE of a PTC water/steam RC to be 0.189 $/kWh. Li et al. [120] suggested a new solar-driven power generation system including RC and ORCs. The system efficiency was found to be 15.6% with the hot-side temperature at 523 K and the cold-side temperature at 293 K. Moreover, they stated that the main exergy destruction occurred in the solar collectors (about 80%). Li et al. [121] studied a solar-driven water/steam RC which was coupled to a bottoming ORC and found that the system efficiency ranged between 13.7% and 15.5%. In another work, Li et al. [122] proposed a novel power system using direct steam generation from PTC, as well as a bottoming ORC. Two-stage accumulators were applied to achieve smooth power conversion. The payback period was calculated at 5 years. Li et al. [123] investigated a power generation system with a water/steam RC (direct or indirect) and a bottoming ORC (see Fig. 15). They found that the direct system had a 1.1% higher system efficiency than the indirect system. Singh and Mishra [124] numerically considered a PTC as the heat source for power generation using a supercritical CO2 cycle with a bottoming ORC (see Fig. 16). The system had a maximum efficiency of 43.5%. Patil et al. [125] compared PTC-ORC and PV technologies for power generation. They found that, for the same capacity factor of 56%, the PTC-ORC led to an LCOE of 0.19 $/kWh while the PV led to an LCOE of 0.26 $/kWh. However, if the PV system was designed with a capacity factor of 27% it could lead to an LCOE of 0.12 $/kWh. Al-Nimr et al. [126] investigated a power generation system using a solar-ORC and concentrated photovoltaic/thermal (CPVT) technology with PTC. Different parameters including solar radiation, ambient temperature and turbine inlet temperature were investigated. It was found that the CPVT-ORC was about 16%-18% more efficient than the CPVT-only system.</p>
        <p>The expander is the most important device in the ORC and therefore expander studies on PTC-ORCs have been considered in the literature. In experimental work, Kosmadakis et al. [127,128] investigated the performance of an ORC system with PTC at 95 o C. The laboratory ORC components are depicted in Fig. 17a, while the ORC housing and the PTC field are shown in Fig. 17b. They emphasised the investigation of the expander performance and found the system efficiency to range between 4.4% and 6%. Deligant et al. [129] investigated the performance of a PTC-ORC with emphasis on the design of a radial expander using CFD analysis. Isentropic expander efficiencies of up to 78% were found. Al Jubori et al. [130] optimised the structure of a turbine as the expander of a solar-ORC system. A three-dimensional simulation was developed in the 
            <rs type="software">ANSYS-CFX</rs> software. Different organic fluids were evaluated as the ORC working fluid. It was found that the performance of the system was enhanced with the optimised turbine using R123 as the ORC working fluid. The system efficiency was 10.5%.
        </p>
        <p>A great deal of literature focuses on TES in PTC-ORCs. Casati et al. [131] investigated the influence of TES in solar-ORC systems for power generation. They found that the system efficiency could be 18% with direct TES and a flashing cycle configuration. Chacartegui et al. [132] studied a solar-ORC system with TES based on direct and indirect methods. The performance of the systems with different ORC working fluids was investigated. Toluene presented the best performance at 31.5% with a power block cost of 825 €/kW. The indirect storage layout was recommended with higher power output and lower electricity costs. Rodrí guez et al. [133] concluded that 1 hour of storage led to a 35% higher yield and that the use of a thermocline reduced the cost of the system by about 30% compared to a design with two storage tanks using molten salt. Caldiño-Herrera et al. [134] evaluated a PTC-ORC with two storage tanks (hot and cold) that had an auxiliary heater. The ORC operated with R245fa working fluid and the system efficiency was about 8%.</p>
        <p>Lastly, there are some studies about solar-geothermal ORCs for power generation. Erdogan et al. [135] examined a solar-geothermal ORC system and emphasised the proper design of the shell and tube heat exchanger. They optimised the system and found efficiencies of up to 6.5%. In another work, Cakici et al. [136] thermodynamically investigated a solar-geothermal ORC system with R134a as the organic fluid. They performed a parametric analysis and found the system efficiency to be close to 12%. Heberle et al.</p>
        <p>[137] modified a geothermal ORC system with a PTC. It was found that the performance of the geothermal ORC system improved by about 4.5%.</p>
        <p>In this section, PTC-ORCs for desalination are presented and Table 6b summarizes the main points of these studies. Delgado-Torres and Garcí a-Rodrí guez [138,139] investigated such a system by applying different ORC working fluids. The total efficiency of the system was calculated as 22.3%, 19.3%, and 18.3% using toluene, D4 and MM as the ORC working fluids respectively. In another study, Delgado-Torres et al. [140] compared the use of two PTCs as the heat source of the desalination system. The mechanical power was generated using an ORC system with three different organic fluids. The authors reported a fresh water production rate of 0.11 m 3 /h using toluene as the ORC working fluid. Bruno et al. [141] numerically optimised a solar desalination system with an ORC system for power generation. Three solar collector technologies were investigated to deliver heat to the ORC system, including PTC, FPC and ETC-CPC. For each solar collector, the influence of different ORC working fluids on the total efficiency was investigated, after which the solar-ORC systems were coupled with a desalination system for freshwater production. The best performance was calculated for the PTC-ORC with isopentane as the ORC working fluid. For the optimised case, the ORC system efficiency was 32% and the total efficiency was estimated at 21%. In another investigation, Delgado-Torres and Garcí a-Rodrí guez [142] optimised the aperture area of different solar collectors together with different ORC working fluids. The results revealed that dry working fluids showed a lower optimised aperture area compared to wet working fluids, except for ammonia. Nafey and Sharaf [143] energetically, exergetically and economically evaluated a solar desalination system based on RO technology driven by an ORC system. They considered different solar collectors and organic fluids and concluded that PTC was the best collector, while toluene and water were the best working fluids. More specifically, the overall efficiency, the exergy efficiency and specific capital cost of the ORC-RO with PTC and water as working fluid were 30.47%, 22.52% and 0.904 $/m 3 respectively. Moreover, Peñate and Garcí a-Rodrí guez [144], Ibarra et al. [145] and Li et al. [146] suggested solar desalination based on ORC systems for power generation using PTC and RO technology. Ibarra et al. [145] reported a water production rate of 1.2 m 3 /h, solar field efficiency of 60% and a system efficiency of 7%. Li et al.</p>
        <p>[146] evaluated an ORC system with superheated conditions at the turbine inlet. After an optimisation procedure, a power output of 200 kW and water production rate of 40 m 3 /h were reported.</p>
        <p>The use of ORC-PTC systems for cogeneration is also usual in the literature and Table 6b includes these studies. Firstly, Freeman et al. [147] studied a solar-ORC system for combined power and heating.</p>
        <p>Concentrating PTC and non-concentrating ETC with the same area were compared. The yearly electric output of the investigated system was 776 kWh and the complete system capital cost was estimated in the range of £2700 to £3900. Also, they found the performance of the two investigated solar collectors to be very similar. Rady et al. [148] presented a cogeneration system consisting of a solar-ORC for power and cooling. PTC and LFR technologies were investigated and the results showed that the use of LFR resulted in a 50% reduction in annual operating hours. Borunda et al. [149] simulated a cogeneration solar-ORC for electricity and industrial heat which included auxiliary electrical heaters. The system had an electrical efficiency of around 7.5%, system efficiency of around 60% and the solar coverage was close to 35%.</p>
        <p>Polygeneration is an interesting idea which needs high-temperature heat sources and thus PTC is a common choice in these configurations. This section presents the PTC-ORC-based polygeneration systems and Table 6c summarizes these studies. Al-Sulaiman et al. [150] studied a novel PTC-ORC for producing electricity, heating and cooling. Three scenarios were investigated: solar only, both solar and TES, and TES only. The total efficiency of the first, second and third scenarios was calculated as 94%, 47% and 42% respectively. In another study, Al-Sulaiman et al. [151] exergetically considered a trigeneration system for producing power, heating and cooling. The three scenarios from Ref. [150] were also investigated and the maximum electrical-exergy efficiencies were calculated as 7%, 3.5% and 3% respectively. Moreover, Al-Sulaiman et al. [152] energetically investigated ORC systems with solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), biomass and solar energy as the heat source. The maximum total efficiency of the system using solar energy was calculated at 90%. Al-Sulaiman [153,154] performed exergy analyses on the combined steam and organic Rankine cycle using a PTC as the heat source. Different working fluids were investigated. R134a was found to be the best choice for the ORC with 26% system exergy efficiency. Suleman et al.</p>
        <p>[155] developed a trigeneration system for electricity, cooling and drying using solar and geothermal heat sources. They concluded that the overall energy and exergy efficiencies of the system were calculated as 54.7% and 76.4% respectively. In another interesting study, Almahdi et al. [156] developed a polygeneration system for electricity, heating, cooling, and hydrogen production using PTC-ORC technology. The energy and exergy efficiency of the suggested system was estimated at 20.7% and 13.7% respectively. Hogerwaard et al. [157] considered a PTC-based system for power, refrigeration and desalination. This system combined an ORC and a Brayton cycle, with energy and exergy efficiencies of 28.4% and 27% respectively. Bellos and Tzivanidis [158] optimised a trigeneration system for heating, cooling and electricity (see Fig. 18). Different ORC working fluids were investigated. Toluene was found to be the best choice which led to a global maximum system exergy efficiency of 29.4%.</p>
        <p>Astolfi et al. [159] investigated a polygeneration system using PTC and PV for desalination and power generation. It was concluded that the suggested system was economically acceptable compared to the traditional desalination system using fossil fuel. Renewable energy penetration was as high as 80%.</p>
        <p>Chang et al. [160] studied a polygeneration system including cooling, heating and power generation. A hybrid system consisting of a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), PTC, ORC and vapour compression cycle was considered. The system presented an energy efficiency of 75% in summer and 85% in winter. Islam et al. [161] evaluated two complex solar-driven polygeneration systems with ORC and thermoelectric generator for electricity, heating, cooling, hydrogen and oxygen production. They found maximum energy and exergy efficiencies of 59.6% and 51.75% respectively. Eisavi et al. [162] thermodynamically investigated a cogeneration/trigeneration system driven by solar energy which included an ORC and an absorption heat pump. The authors found an energy efficiency of 96% and exergy efficiency of 12.8%. El-Emam and Dincer [163] investigated a solar-driven polygeneration system for heating, cooling, hydrogen, fresh water and electricity with maximum system exergy efficiency of 39%. Zhang et al. [164] numerically and experimentally considered a trigeneration system including cooling, heating and power generation. The system efficiency was reported as 10% using R123 as the ORC working fluid. Wang et al. [165] investigated a trigeneration system for cooling, heating and power generation using solar energy for a hotel in China. Compressed air energy storage was directly connected to the solar collectors for power generation. The system included ORC, a gas turbine and an absorption chiller. Its energy and exergy efficiencies were 98.3% and 68.9% respectively. Yüksel [166] investigated a trigeneration system including electricity, cooling, and hydrogen using solar energy. It was concluded that, when the solar irradiation increased from 400 W/m 2 to 1000 W/m 2 , the exergy efficiency and the hydrogen production rate increased from 58% to 64% and from 0.102 kg/h to 0.103 kg/h, respectively. Bellos et al.</p>
        <p>[167] also investigated a trigeneration system for cooling, heating and power generation. A multi-objective optimisation was applied for calculating the optimum conditions of the investigated system. Different ORC parameters were optimised including the heat source temperature of the HRS, the turbine inlet pressure and the heat-rejection temperature at the condenser. It was found that toluene was the most appropriate organic fluid for the ORC system. The optimum system was investigated for operation during a typical year. The exergy efficiency was observed to be 25.2% and the energy efficiency 150.8% at the optimum point. In another work on a solar-driven trigeneration, Zhao et al. [168] found a 46% exergy efficiency. The system included a PTC, ORC and absorption chiller and produced cooling, heating, and electricity. In another work, Khalid et al. [169] investigated a trigeneration system for electricity, heating and cooling with PTC-ORC which presented an LCOE of 0.181 $/kWh for the optimised case. In another investigation, Yüksel et al. [170] investigated a solar-driven polygeneration system for heating, cooling, electricity and hydrogen production (see Fig. 19). They performed a parametric investigation and the system efficiency was found to be around 55%. Sharifishourabi and Arab Chadegani [171] suggested a new polygeneration system for cooling, heating, hydrogen and electricity. The system included an ORC, triple-effect absorption chiller, electrolyser and heat exchangers. The energy and exergy efficiencies of the suggested system were reported as 14% and 26% respectively. The cooling, heating and electricity outputs were 428 kW, 2114 kW and 2380 kW respectively, while the hydrogen production rate was 1.664 g/s. Calise et al. [172] performed a dynamic study on a solar-geothermal polygeneration system for heating, cooling, electricity and fresh water. The payback period was found to be 8.5 years with an ORC efficiency of 15%.</p>
        <p>A summary of ORC systems with a PTC as the heat source is reported in Tables 6a, 6b and 6c. PTCs were found to be the most widely implemented collectors for driving ORC systemsmore than 37% of the articles considered were related to this form of integration. In most cases, but with some notable exceptions especially in locations with a lower solar resource and/or more cloudy climates [13,173], PTCs had better performance compared to other collector types; in other cases, ETCs have also proven quite promising. Beyond pure energy provision, there are numerous studies in the literature that focus on the integration of ORC systems with PTCs and RO desalination. Such systems have been suggested for producing fresh water across a range of scales, with delivered quantities ranging from 0.1 m 3 /hr to 40 m 3 /hr and with overall efficiencies that vary between 7% and 90%. Polygeneration systems producing power, heating/cooling, as well as hydrogen or clean water have been attracting significant attention in the literature in recent years. These systems have been shown as being capable of yielding up to 5.9 kg of H2 per hour and more than 90% total energy efficiency, which suggests an excellent energy conversion potential if this can be done simply, affordably and reliablythis remains a challenge.</p>
        <p>The selection of the best working fluids for yielding higher energetic and exergetic efficiencies and lower specific capital costs were also taken into consideration in many research works. Some authors observed the performance of the system on a monthly and hourly basis under different direct normal irradiance (DNI) and concluded that solar radiation was the most important parameter which determined the total output. Furthermore, the effect of parameters such as the temperature of the working fluid, heat storage capacity and plant size on economic indices, namely payback period, internal rate of return (IRR) and specific capital cost, was the main objective of many studies.</p>
        <p>It appears that ORC systems powered by PTCs are gradually maturing technology. The most significant concern relates to the economic aspects and the reliability of these systems, so further experimental data can help researchers tackle these challenges rationally. Secondly, even though emission standards and policies have been introduced in many countries, just one article focused on the impacts of emission reductions on the environment and overall costs, and as a result, more studies in this area are needed.</p>

        <p>An SDC is a focal-point, medium-to-high temperature collector. Heat absorbed by the heat transfer fluid in the receiver of the SDC can be used to deliver heat to an ORC system (SDC-ORC) for power generation. In this section, investigations into SDC-ORCs are considered.</p>
        <p>Moreover, a lot of attention has been given to the shape of the solar receiver. Loni et al. [174] optically and energetically investigated an SDC-ORC (see Fig. 20a) using a cubical cavity receiver with R141b as the working fluid. The depiction of the collector's optical analysis is shown in Fig. 20b. The authors concluded that the overall thermal efficiency increased by decreasing the inner tube diameter and the inlet temperature. Furthermore, Loni et al. [175] numerically investigated an SDC-ORC using a cylindrical cavity receiver as the absorber (see Fig. 21). The optimum dimensions of the investigated solar system were reported -the optimum cavity depth was found to be the same as the aperture diameter. In Ref. [176], a cubical cavity receiver was thermally and thermodynamically investigated. Different organic fluids were used as the ORC working fluid. The influence of the ORC working fluid's turbine inlet temperature on the system performance was considered. It was found that the solar-ORC system using methanol as the working fluid had the highest system efficiency of 37.5% and consequently the lowest irreversibility. A rectangular cavity receiver was evaluated exergetically in Ref. [177]. The influence of the cavity structural parameters on the exergy performance of the system was investigated. It was found that the cavity receiver with a cavity height equal to the cavity aperture side length showed the highest performance. In another work, Loni et al. [178] numerically investigated a nanofluid-based SDC coupled to ORC. They studied the effect of the size and the concentration of the alumina nanoparticles in an alumina/oil nanofluid. It was found that the power generation of the system increased by decreasing the nanoparticle size and increasing the nanofluid concentration. In other studies, SDC-ORCs were considered for polygeneration. Ozturk et al. [179] proposed a system to produce electricity, heating, cooling, hydrogen and oxygen. The overall energy and exergy efficiencies were calculated as 52.7% and 57.4% respectively. Moradi and Mehrpooya [180] optimised a polygeneration system for heating/cooling and power generation. They used a hybrid energy source including solid oxide fuel cell and solar energy. They found electrical and overall efficiencies of 48.7% and 79.5% respectively. In another work, Yilmaz et al. [181] developed a solar polygeneration system capable of producing electricity, hydrogen, heating, cooling, water and drying. They found that higher exergetic performance could be achieved by using a higher inlet pressure to the turbine. The energetic and exergetic performance of the plant was calculated as 48.19% and 43.8% respectively. Javidmehr et al. [182] considered a cogeneration system energetically and economically. An ORC system and a micro gas turbine were used for power generation. The performance of the system was optimised and it reached a maximum system efficiency of 70%.</p>
        <p>A summary of research works where SDC-ORC was considered is reported in Table 7. In most of the studies, the collectors were employed to generate electricity, heating and cooling simultaneously. Moreover, a lot of research has been focused on the investigation of different cavity receivers for coupling with ORC. Generally, the efficiencies are high because the SDC can operate at relatively high temperatures. More specifically, the energy efficiency of an ORC-only system can be 37.5%, while in polygeneration systems the efficiency can be as high as 70%. However, there is a lack of experimental literature and therefore a need for developing small and large-scale setups for testing SDC-ORCs for electricity production or polygeneration. The overall thermal efficiency increased by decreasing the inner tube diameter and the inlet temperature.</p>

        <p>The ST system is a configuration that can be used in high-temperature applications because of the high concentration ratios. Consequently, there is a potential for achieving high exergy efficiency and to develop highly efficient power or polygeneration units. This section considers ST coupled to a system that includes ORCs. Fig. 22 shows a hybrid solar power generation system including CPV and solar-ORC which was investigated by Han et al. [183]. They found that, with 500 suns, the total efficiency could increase from 28.4% to 44% by using the hybrid system instead of the conventional CPV system. Balta et al. [184] performed an energy and exergy analysis on a system that incorporated ORC, Brayton cycle, ST and electrolyser for power and hydrogen production. For power-only, the energy and the exergy efficiencies were 24.8% and 22.45 respectively, while with hydrogen production these efficiencies became 87% and 88% respectively. Zare and Hasanzadeh [185] considered a power generation system using an ST and a combined system that including a Brayton cycle and two bottoming ORCs (see Fig. 23). The overall system exergy efficiency was found to be over 30%. Khaliq [186] studied a modified ORC with an ejector for cooling and electricity. They used ST to feed the system and the energy efficiency reached 30%. In another work, Han et al. [187] investigated a power generation system including CPV and ST under energy and exergy aspects. The maximum system efficiency was found to be 37.2%.</p>
        <p>Yilmaz [188] evaluated the performance of a polygeneration system using solar energy. The suggested system could generate different useful products including power, heating, cooling, freshwater, and hydrogen. The power generation system included a Brayton cycle, an RC, and an ORC. The overall energy and exergy efficiencies of the system were 78.9% and 47.6% respectively. Javanshir et al. [189] thermodynamically investigated a power generation system with CSP as the heat source. The ORC, steam RC, Brayton cycle, and combinations of power cycles were evaluated. Results showed that the CSP system with a combined ORC and Brayton cycle had the highest performance. More specifically, for a maximum cycle temperature of above 650°C, the highest thermal efficiency of around 45% was attributed to the combined CO2 Brayton and ORC unit. In another work, Li et al. [190] suggested a new two-step power generation system for increased storage capacity using direct steam generation. In the first step, the solar working fluid (water) was vaporised in the solar system and power was generated by flowing the steam through a turbine. In the second step, heat rejected by the condenser was transfer to an ORC system for power generation. It was concluded that the storage capacity could be improved by 460% using the suggested system.</p>
        <p>A summary of ORC systems using STs as the heat source is presented in Table 8. ST systems are able to accommodate a wide range of cycles including ORCs with high-temperature working fluids. Many articles focused on the assessment of hybrid systems, such as ST coupled with CPV technology, hydrogen production systems, or Brayton cycles. Generally, high efficiencies can be found especially in cases with hydrogen production or with the incorporation of Brayton cycles with ORC. In the future, there is a need for more optimisation studies and experimental works.</p>

        <p>In the literature, there are power systems that are driven by alternative solar technologies [191]. Ziapour et al. [192,193] developed a solar-ORC system using a solar pond (see Fig. 24). A thermoelectric generator was used as the condenser of the ORC system. Results showed that the performance of the system increased with the application of a thermoelectric generator. Lee et al. [194] suggested a novel idea for power generation using a solar chimney to deliver heat to an ORC. Different dimensions of the system were optimised for achieving the best performance. Some experimental tests were conducted on the solar chimney and ORC system (see Fig. 25). The highest outlet temperature and efficiency of the solar system were calculated as 125°C and 65% respectively, based on experimental tests. The daily electric output of the system was reported as 12 kWh per 41 m 2 of solar chimney area. A summary of the ORC systems mentioned in this section is presented in Table 9.</p>

        <p>Investigation of solar chimney integrated with ORC system. The proposed solar system yielded a maximum outlet temperature, efficiency and electricity output of 125°C , 65% and 12 kWh/day respectively. [194] 3.9 Hybrid systems Hybrid systems featuring ORCs have seen an increased interest in recent years due to their higher efficiency and reliability. Hybrid systems utilise solar energy together with other energy sources, such as waste heat from a heat engine, geothermal energy, biomass, biogas or LNG, to feed the ORC. This section is devoted to the literature available on these systems.</p>
        <p>The majority of the literature focuses on the combination of solar and geothermal energy sources. Table 10a includes the studies about solar-geothermal systems with ORC and the main details of these studies are given inside this table. Astolfi et al. [195] investigated such a hybrid system using PTC. The yearly performance of the system was estimated using hourly data. The LCOE was calculated to be 145-280 €/MWh. In another work, Tempesti and Fiaschi [196] investigated a 50 kW power generation system using ORC systems driven by ETC-geothermal. The system could provide heating when needed and could therefore be converted into a cogeneration system. Different organic fluids were considered as the ORC working fluid, including R134a, R236fa, and R245fa. The best performance was found with R245fa. Ghasemi et al. [197] considered a hybrid ORC system (PTC-geothermal) and a maximum system efficiency of 17.9% was found. In another work, Ayub et al. [198] found that the hybrid configuration (PTC-geothermal) had a maximum efficiency of 8% while the solar-only case presented a maximum efficiency of 6.3%. It was found that the levelised electricity cost parameter reduced by about 2% when using the hybrid system compared to having only geothermal energy as the heat source. The use of solar evacuated FPC-geothermal was studied by Buonomano et al. [199] for a trigeneration system. They conducted an analysis with TRNSYS for a hotel in Ischia and found that the ORC efficiency was 6%, the solar collector efficiency was 60% and the simple payback period was between 2.5 and 7.6 years. Calise et al. [200] used PTC-geothermal for a polygeneration system that produced fresh water, electricity, heating and cooling. The proposed system was investigated based on energy and economic analyses in different weather conditions. They found a payback period of 4.5 years. In a similar investigation, Calise et al. [201] found the maximum exergy efficiency in winter (up to 50%) while in summer the exergy efficiency was lower (up to 20%). The cost of electricity was estimated in the range of 0.148 €/kWh to 0.172 €/kWh. Islam and Dincer [202] also investigated a similar system for heating, cooling, drying and power generation. The energy and exergy efficiencies were 51% and 62% respectively. Moreover, Heberle et al. [203] considered from economical and technical perspectives an ORC system for power generation using PTC-geothermal. The system efficiency was 10% and the lowest LCOE was 145 $/MWh. Bassetti et al. [204] developed an ORC power system using PTC-geothermal and TES. The system efficiency was 6.3% in hybrid mode while it was 5.3% in the geothermal-only mode. Li et al. [205] investigated a solar-geothermal-driven ORC system using two-stage evaporation. It was concluded that the performance of the system could be improved by using a two-stage serial ORC system driven by dual-level heat sources. The maximum exergy efficiency of the system was 27%.</p>
        <p>Solar-biomass hybrid systems are also common in the literature and this section describes them, while table 10b gives a brief summary of these systems. Zourellis et al. [206] developed a cogeneration ORC system using PTC-biomass (see Fig. 26). They found that with a collector area of close to 30 000 m 2 , the maximum electricity produced was 15 MW. Moreover, Karellas and Braimakis [207] investigated a hybrid system (PTC-biomass) including an ORC system and a vapour compression cycle (VCC) for polygeneration. The energy and exergy efficiencies were 5.54% and 7.56% respectively. Patel et al. [208] investigated an ORC-based trigeneration system driven by solar-biomass for cooling and heating. The use of SDC technology led to the highest solar fraction followed by PTC and LFR. The minimum payback period of the system with the use of biomass was 7.5 years. In another study, Yue et al. [209] developed a drying system that was powered by solar irradiation and biomass. They found that the net power of the system increased by increasing the moisture content and temperature of the outlet air of the drying system. Pantaleo et al. [210] investigated a hybrid system (PTC-biomass) for heating, cooling, and power generation. They examined different design scenarios and found the system to be financially viable. In another work, Boyaghchi and Chavoshi [211] studied an FPC-biomass hybrid system for power generation and heating at two temperature levels. Water/CuO nanofluid was used as the solar working fluid and the system had an exergy efficiency of 39.8%. Pantaleo et al. [212,213] investigated a PTC-biomass hybrid trigeneration system. An ORC system was used at the bottom of the cycle for power generation. The LCOE ranged from around 100 €/MWh to above 220 €/MWh. Bufi et al. [214] thermodynamically optimised a hybrid PTCbiomass system. Toluene was recommended as the most suitable working fluid with a system efficiency of 30.3%. Pantaleo et al. [215] techno-economically investigated combined Brayton and ORC power plants using PTC-biomass. The global efficiency of the system with large PTC and TES was around 25%. In another investigation, Bellos et al. [216] considered polygeneration (using PTC-biomass) for producing power, cooling and heating at two temperature levels. The system was first optimised for steady-state conditions and then further investigated for performance during a typical year. The yearly energy and exergy efficiencies of the system were 51.26% and 21.77% respectively. Morrone et al. [217] investigated a hybrid ORC system (PTC-biomass) for cogeneration. They compared the hybrid ORC system with solar-only and biomass-only systems. It was concluded that the hybrid ORC system allowed for better utilisation of the low solar radiation levels and the system energy efficiency was around 67%. Biogas has also been considered in hybrid systems. Soares and Oliveira [218] developed a hybrid PTCbiogas system for power generation. The annual system efficiency was 37.4% and the hybrid mode was the most efficient. In another interesting study, Mosaffa et al. [219] suggested a novel polygeneration layout for power, heating, methanol and hydrogen, using ST-biogas. Moreover, the system was thermodynamically and exergo-environmentally considered. The authors concluded that the heat source temperature was an effective parameter for improving system performance. The energy and exergy efficiencies of the hybrid system were around 70% and 63% respectively.</p>
        <p>The use of alternative hybrid systems is presented in the present section and Table 10c includes the respective results. LNG and waste heat have also been investigated for feeding an ORC in combination with solar energy. Mehrpooya et al. [220] proposed a hybrid solar-LNG ORC system for power generation (see Fig. 27). The regenerative ORC was optimised and its exergy efficiency was found to be 14.4%, an increase of 5.7% compared to the reference scenario. Moreover, financial analysis proved a yearly income of 3.61 M$. Bellos and Tzivanidis [221] developed an ORC system fed by solar PTC and waste heat (see Fig. 28). Different ORC working fluids were considered and the system showed maximum performance with toluene (up to 19.7%). Moreover, Kane et al. [222] experimentally investigated a hybrid power system (using LFR and diesel engine waste heat) in cascade configuration with two ORCs. The system could produce heating and cooling when needed. The total system efficiency was 41% in hybrid mode and 7.7% in solar-only mode. Another interesting idea is the combination of thermal collectors and PV, which was investigated by Rahbar et al. [223]. A direct absorption tubular configuration was applied with PV cells on its outer surface. The authors used nanofluids to enhance the absorption inside the tubular receiver of the PTC. An ORC was coupled to the system and the final configuration presented an overall efficiency of 20.5%, while the CPVT-only system had an efficiency of 17.8%. Lastly, Li et al. [224] considered a hybrid system (solar-LNG) for power generation using an ORC system. The authors compared FPC and ETC and found that ETC performed the best. A system efficiency of 6% was found with isopentane/R125 as the working fluid in the ORC.</p>
        <p>A summary of hybrid ORC systems in solar applications is presented in Tables 10a, 10b and 10c. Solar energy showed a high potential to be integrated with other resources for the purpose of producing clean energy. Researchers have investigated hybrid ORC systems powered by solar-geothermal, solar-biomass, solar-diesel engine and solar-LNG. The main aim of the hybridisation was to increase the reliability as well as the first and second law efficiencies of the systems. Research studies focused on the impact of hybridisation, the amount of thermal and electrical energy produced and, in some polygeneration systems, the amount of fresh water, hydrogen, or methanol produced, as well as the costs involved. In all cases, the hybrid systems proved to be more efficient with lower expense. Moreover, it has to be said that a great part of the literature has been focused on solar-geothermal and solar-biomass ORCs.</p>
        <p>Overall, there is still vast opportunity for further research on hybrid systems. For example, determining the optimum proportion of each energy source to run the ORC unit, finding the best types of solar collectors to be coupled with another source of energy and testing a wide range of ORC and solar collector working fluids have not been studied comprehensively. Moreover, geographical features, one of the most important parameters which have a profound effect on the configuration of systems and the final cost of products, have not been taken into consideration in most of the studies. This parameter sheds light on the availability of each resource in each area, social and economic conditions as well as the conventional source of energy in each region. This information assists researchers to present their results far more accurately and realistically and opens the door to the commercial exploitation of renewable energy. Moreover, there is a need for conducting more experimental studies, especially studies with an ST or SDC coupled with geothermal or biomass heat sources. The LCOE produced was 145-280 €/MWh.

        <p>Solar irradiation is a variable heat source that presents a need for TES in order to eliminate heat source fluctuations. The use of TES allows the system to operate at approximately steady-state conditions and to operate close to the nominal point where the various subsystems have been sized [225]. Moreover, the use of a storage system makes the storage of useful heat, during the hours of high solar irradiation, and its utilisation later in the afternoon possible. Usually, a TES is designed for a few hours (4 to 8 hours) in order to develop systems with relatively high capacity factors. There are many ways of storing thermal energy in ORCs. Sensible storage is usually done by using storage tanks, while latent heat storage is performed by using PCM.</p>
        <p>Kutlu et al. [46] investigated a system with sensible storage. The system included a single water storage tank. In another work, Bassetti et al. [204] found that the use of two storage tanks in a solar field (see Fig. 29) was able to increase the annual power output by about 19% compared to the case without storage. Moreover, Pantaleo et al. [212] considered the use of a storage system between a primary and a bottoming solar-driven ORC. They found that having a storage system with molten salt between the two cycles was beneficial for the performance of the total configuration. Rodriguez et al. [133] compared the use of two tanks and of a single thermocline tank. They found that both configurations had similar thermal performance but that the thermocline was more cost-effective (30% lower cost). Li et al. [190] developed a novel system for TES using a direct steam generation solar technology with a payback period of around 5 years. Furthermore, Patil et al. [125] compared a solar-ORC using TES with a solar PV system using battery storage. They found that the solar-ORC had a lower LCOE and higher reliability than the PV system using batteries.</p>
        <p>The use of latent heat storage makes it possible to store useful heat at preferable temperature levels without superheating, which reduces solar thermal efficiency and adds extra thermal losses. Moreover, a PCM can store large amounts of heat with a relatively small volume, allowing for more compact systems. However, the use of latent heat storage through PCM adds an extra cost to the system and also creates possible limitations to the reliability of the storage system. A proper design is therefore needed to develop a cost-effective and reliable system. Lakhani et al. [226] designed a solar-ORC with latent heat storage in the solar field loop. They found that the discharging efficiency of the stored energy was about 83%. Manfrida et al. [227] developed a model for simulating the latent heat storage in a solar-ORC. They found that a proper design with PCM storage allowed the system to operate for about 80% of the day. Lastly, Alvi et al. [53] studied the use of a direct and indirect PCM storage system in a solar-ORC system (see Fig. 30). They found that the direct system was more efficient than the indirect storage system.</p>
        <p>System performance The first part of this review paper regards the non-concentrating solar-ORC systems. These systems present low simplicity due to the lack of tracking mechanism, low investment cost but also low efficiency. Therefore there is a need for installing high collecting areas in order to produce significant electricity amounts. Thus, the research has been expanded to solar-concentrating systems coupled to ORC in order to achieve higher system efficiencies. However, concentrating systems present a higher complexity due to the need for tracking systems and are also associated with increased investment costs. Concentrating systems also do not show improved performance in regions of high diffuse irradiance. However, they can lead to better performance in both energy and exergy terms if the solar conditions allow for this (requires a relatively good solar resource with clear-sky conditions). Specifically, linear concentrating systems are a reliable choice and numerous studies have, for this reason, considered PTCs, while a smaller number of studies have considered ETCs and LFRs. High-quality PTCs lend the possibility of operating at high temperatures (of up to 400-500°C) with reasonable optical and thermal efficiencies. PTCs therefore also account for the lion's share of the solar-ORC literature due to their maturity and performance in good solar conditions. In lower solar resources and/or more cloudy climates (in which the diffuse radiation component is more significant), studies have suggested that ETCs can have a similar performance to PTCs, but with a lower cost and complexity [13,173]. On the other hand, LFRs have an interest due to their lower capital cost and lower fatigue loads because of the non-movable absorber parts. Reported thermal efficiencies with PTCs are generally above 20%, while LFRs lead to lower performance, especially at high latitudes. Various studies have considered different techniques for enhancing the performance of LFR-based ORC systems. The CPC, which is similar to the PTC, has a low concentration ratio and in some cases can operate without tracking. This technology is not as common in ORC applications, and also does not lead to high system efficiencies due to the limitations in its operating temperature.</p>
        <p>The use of solar concentrating collectors in ORC systems for cogeneration, trigeneration, or polygeneration was also found in the literature. PTCs are a common option for solar-driven polygeneration units and lead to high energy and exergy efficiencies. Point-focal concentrating systems in particular are ideal for polygeneration. SDCs and STs can operate at higher temperatures than PTCs. This increases their exergetic performance and allows them to be applied in high-temperature applications for producing special useful outputs such as hydrogen.</p>
        <p>The literature review also considered hybrid systems (a combination of solar energy with other energy sources, and more specifically geothermal energy, biomass and waste heat recovery). Hybrid systems are usually high capacity-factor systems thanks to the different and in many cases complementary, energy input profiles. Moreover, TES is an important element for achieving continuous operation or operation during a large portion of the day. Usually, TES systems rely on sensible storage that gives the possibility of storing energy for 4-8 hours daily, but various PCMs have also been proposed depending on the storage temperature.</p>
        <p>Economic and financial assessments indicate that solar-ORC systems can be more viable and promising as part of wider polygeneration systems and with concentrating collectors in locations with high solar potential. The capital cost of these systems is relatively high but can be reduced with the maturing of the technology. Compared to PV technology, solar-ORC systems have higher costs; however, they can lead to higher energy and exergy performance, and also offer the opportunity for TES and polygeneration, at a lower overall cost. Solar-ORC can therefore be a competitive technology with its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the application, the needs of the end-user and the cost of electricity in every case. More specifically, it has been found that the PTC-ORC system leads to lower LCOE compared to PV technology, for the same capacity [125].</p>
        <p>Comparing the LCOE of different solar-ORC technologies, it can be said that the use of LFR leads to the highest LCOE and so it is not the recommended design [118]. On the other hand, the use of PTC is a promising idea with lower LCOE compared to LFR [118]. It can be said that a usual value in the literature about the LCOE with PTC-ORC systems is found at 0.18 $/kWh [169]. The use of the CPC-ORC system is another interesting choice with an LCOE at 0.21 $/kWh [88] and it is a better choice than the use of FPC or ETC. Moreover, it is interesting to state that the combination of PTC with other renewables is able to reduce the LCOE. More specifically, the use of a PTC-geothermal ORC presents an LCOE of 0.15 $/kWh [203], while the combination of PTC with biomass coupled to an ORC can reduce the LCOE to 0.1 €/kWh [212].</p>
        <p>Lastly, it has to be commented that a critical issue is the proper control strategy of the ORCs. The most usual control strategy is the use of PID controllers, as it has been done by Ni et al. [117] and it has been found 24% performance enhancement with this control. More specifically, Quolin et al. [228] investigated three different PID control strategies which are the constant evaporating temperature strategy, the optimized evaporation temperature strategy and the pump speed-strategy. They found that the optimized evaporation temperature strategy is the best one. In another work, Pang et al. [229] examined different PID control cases. They concluded that the variable frequency device has to be applied in small ORCs and also they stated that the superheat control methodology is a proper choice to control the working mass flow rate. Moreover, the PID is the usual choice in solar-ORC [117] and geothermal-ORC [230] units.</p>
        <p>Limitations of solar-ORCs Solar-ORCs are promising systems with acceptable efficiency which can also be included in wider polygeneration systems for producing numerous useful outputs. However, there are technological limitations that remain and these can be used to motivate further research and development. Firstly, solar-ORC systems have high capital costs, especially in small-scale applications. Moreover, there is a need to identify high-performance turbine or expansion devices in order to achieve high overall efficiencies, including at part-load and off-design operation. This fact is important especially in small-scale systems in order to make them financially competitive with alternatives.</p>
        <p>Another critical issue regards the selection of high-performance working fluids. There is a growing requirement for using fluids with zero ODP and low GWP, as well as fluids with low toxicity and flammability. However, it is not an easy task to find optimal working fluids with these characteristics and also with high efficiency. This has led to a significant research activity by many research groups. In lowtemperature systems, natural refrigerants such as R290, R600 and R600a seem to be suitable candidates, while at higher temperatures, working fluids such as toluene, cyclohexane, MDM and MM seem to lead to the best performance. To conclude, in every case, there is a need for a working fluid investigation that takes into account different aspects of the application amongst other constraints.</p>
        <p>Future work Although commercially the technology has been facing challenges from low-cost PV, current research on solar-ORC systems is internationally cross-cutting and rapidly gaining traction. Therefore, the field is open and there is great potential for further research. Based on the present review of the literature, it is our view that the goal of future studies should be to determine the design and operation design characteristics and features of the most efficient and cost-effective solar-ORC technologies for deployment in different applications, regions and for different (local) needs. On the solar collector side, there is a need for performing more studies on suitable collectors that have not been studied in great detail when integrated with ORC technology. For example, studies on the use of CPCs and LFRs can be performed as these are popular choices, but also on ETCs which have not been extensively studied and have been shown to be promising in some cases. Moreover, there are only a few studies about alternative solar technologies with ORC systems, such as solar stills and solar chimneys, so these solar technologies can also be considered for future research.</p>
        <p>Another critical aspect of future research regards energy storage. The most usual system involves sensible TES, while there are also other alternatives. The use of PCMs, for example, as well as of thermocline-bed sensible storage with rocks, or thermo-chemical storage are interesting alternatives that can be particularly suitable in this application and demand further investigation. PCMs, in particular, have attracted attention and led to a number of published studies, however, there is great scope to expand our knowledge in this area. For thermo-chemical storage, there is a need for studies on feasibility in solar-ORC applications as this enables longer-term (inter-seasonal) storage (storage during the summer and exploitation later in the year). The cost of the storage has to be taken into consideration in each analysis.</p>
        <p>Lastly, the most important challenge for the future is to create commercial solar-ORC systems that can compete with other power generation systems with the real potential for substituting fossil-fuel systems. There is a need for performing more experimental studies in full-scale systems in order to create the basis for developing low-cost commercial products. The development of solar-ORC technology as part of wider polygeneration systems is a way to achieve sustainability in future energy systems in the building sector or in local communities that present high energy needs for cooling, heating and electricity. This is a particularly promising avenue for further research, especially since the technology readiness levels here are much lower. Moreover, there is a need for making ORC technology a famous and socially acceptable technology. The proper dissemination of information in the industrial society about the advantages of ORC coupled to renewables has to be performed in order for this technology to be expanded in many markets. The advantages of the ORC technology have to be presented in a proper way to the audience and more specifically, the compact design, the design of small to high capacities, the reasonable pressure levels compared to the water-steam cycle and the low superheating degree are some of the advantages of this coming up technology.</p>
        <p>In this paper, a comprehensive review was presented related to solar-ORC systems for power generation, and also for the provision of additional energy vectors (heating, cooling) or other useful outputs (e.g., fresh water and hydrogen). Firstly, a wide range of different solar collectors that can be coupled to ORC systems was presented. Specifically, FPCs, ETCs, CPCs, LFRs, PTCs, SDCs and STs were reviewed in the context of solar-ORC systems. The review also extended to hybrid systems with dual-energy inputs (specifically solar-geothermal, solar-biomass and solar-WHR), and highlighted issues relating to TES which arise naturally in this application.</p>
        <p>The present review work indicates that system efficiencies of over 20% can be achieved with PTCs, which is an effective choice in this application for achieving good efficiency at a reasonable cost. Other linear concentrating technologies and even non-concentrating technologies also appear as promising options in certain cases. Non-concentrating technologies appear especially promising in cooler and more overcast climates with reasonable efficiencies but at lower cost and complexity. Hybridisation of the solar input with other energy sources is an important avenue for creating a sustainable system with a high capacity factor and acceptable financial indicators. As a consequence, hybrid systems enable higher overall system efficiency (about 5%) compared to solar-only systems. TES is also important in allowing continuous power generation, which has motivated significant research on a range of storage solutions, with both sensible TES and PCMs being suitable options.</p>
        <p>To conclude, solar-ORC technology is an excellent choice for sustainable and renewable power generation. This is also true for the generation of other useful products in polygeneration configurations, especially in distributed applications, which has shown good performance and which would benefit greatly from further techno-economic improvements. In the future, there is a need for conducting further research, especially experimental studies that would promote the commercial development and deployment of solar-ORC technology, focusing on improving efficiency but also, crucially, the financial proposition of these systems. Issues such as the selection of working fluids, expanders, solar collectors, storage technology as well as system configuration and optimisation remain important and need to be further pursued.</p>
