        <p>Aqueous dye-sensitized solar cells are emerging as a promising alternative to enhance both the lifetime and environmental friendliness of traditional DSSCs. In this article, we report a cobalt-based, jellified (with xanthan gum) aqueous electrolyte, leading to a valuable efficiency exceeding 4% (VOC = 847 mV, JSC = 6.73 mA cm -2 , FF = 74%). Design of experiment is employed to precisely and significantly study, at a multivariate level, the effects produced by Co 2+ concentration, Co 2+ /Co 3+ ratio and xanthan gum amount modifications on the overall photovoltaic parameters of lab-scale solar cells.</p>

        <p>Since the discovery of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), the most frequently used redox mediator has been the iodide/triiodide couple (I -/I3 -). [1] However, though it leads to efficient sensitizer regeneration and slow recombination kinetic with the electrons in the TiO2 conduction band, its redox potential limits the maximum open-circuit voltage (VOC) deliverable by the device and the strong light absorption of I3 -restricts the application in transparent and tandem devices. [2,3] Furthermore, the iodine-based couple was proven to be unsuitable for large scale applications, being corrosive toward copper/silver electrodes used to collect electrons in modules. [4,5] Alternative redox couples were proposed, based mainly on copper or cobalt complexes, but also on organic compounds. [6,7] Among these alternative chemistries, cobalt-based shuttles attracted a wide attention for several reasons: [8] (i) their light absorption is weaker than that of iodine-based systems; (ii) they are not corrosive and not volatile, thus enhancing the long-term stability of the device, and (iii) they possess easily tuneable redox potentials (also being, generally, more positive than that of the I -/I3 -couple). [9][10][11] In recent years, cobalt complexes have been successfully employed in organic solvent-based DSSCs, leading to remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) values of up to 14.3%. [12] Best results were obtained with a [Co(phen)3] 3+/2+ couple, mixed with 11 different additives dissolved in acetonitrile. [12] In view of the commercialization and large-scale deployment of DSSCs, the redox mediator employed notwithstanding, the widely used organic solvents, being highly volatile, could result in electrolyte evaporation and leakage. In this context, DSSCs based on a gel electrolyte can compete with their liquid counterparts in terms of PCE and, importantly, exhibit better longterm stability. [13][14][15][16][17] Quasi-solid electrolytes based on iodine have been quite extensively reported in literature. [18] Conversely, just few examples of cobalt-based counterparts have been presented. [19][20][21] This is mainly due to the relatively slow diffusion coefficients of bulky cobalt complexes (e.g., 1.39Ã—10 -6 cm 2 s -1 for [Co(bpy)3] 3+ in acetonitrile), that are reduced further (-30%) once incorporated in a gelled matrix. [19] As a noteworthy example, Spiccia and co-workers proposed cobalt-based gel electrolytes with 4 wt% of poly(vinylidene fluoride-cohexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) incorporated in acetonitrile. [19] The resulting devices, sensitized with MK2 dye, showed efficiencies up to 8.7% under full sunlight intensity; their short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) decreased when the polymer content was increased up to 10 wt%. This suggested that an increase in the polymer content reduced the diffusion rate of the redox mediator. As regards the long-term stability, the polymeric devices maintained more than 90% of their initial PCE after 700 h under operative conditions. A similar PVDF-based electrolyte (1.5 wt% in methoxypropionitrile) was proposed by Kloo's group to further boost the long term stability without showing any loss in PCE, even after 1000 h aging under ambient conditions. [20] An alternative approach, consisting of the in situ photopolymerization of polymer electrolytes incorporating the Co(II)/Co(III)-based mediator, was proposed by some of us, [21] starting from a mixture of mono-and bifunctional methacrylates mixed with the [Co(bpy)3] 3+/2+ mediator, all photocrosslinked between cell electrodes. A remarkable PCE of 6.6%, coupled to an outstanding stability exceeding 1200 h, was achieved.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the remarkable stability independently reached by different groups, the common use of organic solvents (being toxic and flammable) in jellified electrolytes seriously undermines the safety and the sustainability of the resulting solar cells. [22][23][24] Therefore, researchers started considering water-based DSSCs, i.e. devices using up to 100% water as a solvent for redox couple and additives. [25] Yet, this paradigm shift still requires a whole rethink of the cell components aiming at effectively working in an aqueous environment; therefore, new photoelectrodes, [26] sensitizers [27] and counterelectrodes [28,29] have been (and continue to be) proposed to target emerging issues, e.g. electrodes wettability, hydrolysis of anchoring groups, solubility of higher amounts of redox shuttles, etc.</p>
        <p>Even if the water-based approach requires a relevant rethink of DSSCs components and interfaces, only a few works have been published dealing with the development of quasi-solid state aqueous DSSCs (a-DSSCs). [14,30] Among them, the only example of device incorporating a cobalt-based redox couple dates back to 2015 by Spiccia and co-workers. [31] They combined MK2-sensitized TiO2 electrodes with a collagen-derived gelatin containing the conventional [Co(bpy)3] 2+/3+ mediator. The best performing photoanode led to a PCE of 4.1% under 1 sun illumination (JSC = 7.9 mA cm -2 ), yet showing a diffusion-limited behaviour. Their work was focused on a novel nanostructured TiO2 electrode, while the aspects related to the intrinsic hydrogel electrolyte composition were not thoroughly investigated.</p>
        <p>In this communication, we present a new cobalt-based quasi-solid electrolyte for a-DSSCs approaching 5% efficiency. The jellifying agent is xanthan gum (XG), [32] a polymeric matrix that we successfully demonstrated in aqueous environment for systems based on the iodinebased redox shuttle. [33] Here we also propose design of experiment (DoE) as a powerful tool to simultaneously evaluate the effect of different factors on the overall photovoltaic performance, by reducing the number of experiments and offering a wide overview to the readers on the mutual interactions between the measured variable and experimental conditions. [34] 2. Discussion</p>
        <p>To fabricate our lab-scale a-DSSCs, we started from the Co(bpy) 2+/3+ redox couple (0.13 M Co(bpy)3Cl2 and 0.04 M Co(bpy)3Cl3) dissolved with 0.4 M N-methylbenzimidazole (NMBI) into a chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)-saturated water solution; liquid-state cells led to PCE values of 3.72% (JSC = 7.98 mA cm -2 , VOC = 623 mV and FF = 74.8). When the Co(bpy) 2+/3+ redox shuttle was replaced with the Co(bpy-pz) 2+/3+ one, the gain in VOC was evident (+220 mV), even thought it was partially counterbalanced by a slight decrease in JSC, probably due to a less effective dye regeneration. Overall, this allowed us to overcome the 4% efficiency threshold (PCE = 4.21%, JSC = 6.73 mA cm -2 , VOC = 847 mV and FF = 73.9), a noteworthy achievement in the field of a-DSSCs. Further investigation on this will be tackled in a forthcoming paper dealing with the systematic study of the electrode/electrolyte interface.</p>
        <p>It is also worth mentioning that the best device showed an increase in performance by lowering the source irradiance, achieving a 5.25% PCE under 0.1 sun (Figure S1), thus highlighting its suitability for indoor and portable applications. Conversely, the PCE drop at higher irradiance level was mainly due to a non-linear increase of JSC with the light intensity.</p>
        <p>An increased electron recombination with high photogenerated current was also expected and could justify the current limitation, even when no mass transport issue occurred.</p>
        <p>Once promising results were obtained with MK2-sensitized cobalt-based liquid-state a-DSSCs, we decided to plan a DoE to precisely investigate the gelation of these aqueous electrolytes by using the bio-derived and cheap XG polymer. [32] Additionally, the gelation of the electrolyte was expected to improve the stability of lab-scale cells with respect to those assembled with the liquid solution containing the Co(bpy-pz) 2+/3+ mediator. It is worth mentioning that the gelation of the electrolyte could also lead to serious drawbacks, such as excessively high viscosity values and, thus, a low diffusion coefficient to guarantee efficient solar cells (especially in the presence of bulky redox couples as in this case). [6,35] In our study, the effect of electrolyte gelation was evaluated by changing the amount of XG in the solution from 0 (liquid state) to 3 wt% (gelled state), this being centred around the point of the experimental domain (i.e., 1.5 wt%) corresponding to the minimum threshold to obtain a freestanding hydrogel. Moreover, the XG amount was studied in conjunction with the modification of the Co 2+ complex concentration and its relative ratio with its oxidized counterpart (see Table 1). Thanks to the multivariate approach we adopted, this work represents a significant advance with respect to typical studies where a single factor at a time is varied. Other parameters (dye = MK2, electrolyte solvent = CDCA-saturated water, counter-electrode = Pt) remained unchanged in our experiments. It should be noted that variation of these parameters could also be crucial in the optimization of Co-based aqueous electrolytes and they will be analysed in some forthcoming papers. [36] protocol, we carried out two replicates for some cells in order to distinguishin the subsequent fitting phasethe experimental error from the model error.</p>
        <p>The complete list of cells and their preparation conditions ([Co 2+ complex], Co 2+ /Co 3+ ratio and XG amount) is shown in Table 2, along with the corresponding measured photovoltaic parameters. As previously observed with iodine-based electrolytes, [33] a-DSSCs devices exhibited an activation period after device sealing. In our study, cobalt-based cells stabilized their efficiency just after 24 h from sealing, thus photovoltaic parameters were evaluated after this time lapse in our laboratory. Overall, we noticed that measured PCE took rather different values in the studied experimental domain, i.e. from 3.21% (cell 11) to 4.47% (cell 17); this means that the selected factors were significant for this study.</p>
        <p>To better understand the relationship between analysed factors (inputs) and photovoltaic responses (outputs), a multivariate analysis of the experimental data was computed. The chemometric model was fitted by means of partial least squares regression. [36] Overall, DoE fitting did not show any data outliers, and the coefficient analysis was very useful to highlight some trends and interactions between factors and relative effects on a-DSSCs performance. A more complex DoE, also involving a higher number of factors and experiments, will be presented in a forthcoming paper. The effects of each factor and their interactions, which represent the six coefficients of the chemometric model, can be observed on the resulting photovoltaic responses, as plotted in of these effects on the photovoltaic performance can be more easily observed by means of the iso-response plots (Figure 1). The main effect occurring when the electrolyte status was changed from liquid to quasi-solid was a slight lowering of VOC values of roughly 25 mV (XG = 3 wt%). Similarly, the increase in Co(bpy-pz) 2+ concentration led to lower VOC values, being the redox potential negatively shifted accordingly to Nernst's equation (Figure 1A).</p>
        <p>Concerning JSC values (Figure 1B), the presence of the XG matrix slightly decreased the measured photocurrent, especially in the presence of higher concentrations of Co 2+ species.</p>
        <p>This experimental result was initially attributed to a reduced mobility of electrolyte species (both in the interelectrode space and within TiO2 pores), mainly caused by the gelation effect.</p>
        <p>However, this conclusion appeared to be in opposition to the effects observed on the JSC values by increasing the Co 2+ /Co 3+ ratio; indeed, liquid electrolytes-based cells exhibited higher JSC values when lowering the concentration of the redox mediators, while the opposite trend was found for quasi-solid state systems. Straightforwardly, the main reason of the lower JSC observed could be ascribed to a sizeable charge recombination, that particularly occurs in concentrated liquid electrolytes. A further, but tentative, explanation on the lower JSC detected for quasi-solid a-DSSCs could lie in the possibly unfavourable interaction between XG and NMBI. Indeed, when a liquid electrolyte is used, NMBI tends to lie at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, hampering the recombination and thus increasing voltage. On the other hand, considering quasi-solid electrolytes, XG could partially remove NMBI from the TiO2 surface and, in case of concentrated electrolytes, can cause the JSC drop down due to more probable recombination losses. The presence of NMBI and its interaction with XG, as well as the effect of carboxylic moiety on diffusion kinetic of both Co 3+ and Co 2+ species, will be discussed in a forthcoming paper. It is worth mentioning that the highest JSC, achieved by one of the samples with XG 1.5 wt% (namely cell 17), which exceeded 7.5 mA cm -2 , outperformed the liquid counterparts, confirming the non-trivial effect of XG addition on photovoltaic performances.</p>
        <p>This also proved that it is possible to obtain a gelled electrolyte (with the minimum amount of XG) that mimics the performance of the liquid electrolyte, being, in turns, much more stable.</p>
        <p>FF is slightly negatively affected by both the gelation and the dilution of electrolyte (Figure 1C) and this could be related to the raising importance of mass transport limitations. Finally, the sum of the previous effects due to electrolyte gelation and the change in redox mediator concentrations can be observed on the plot regarding PCE (Figure 1D). Generally speaking, the addition of XG tended to slightly decrease the overall PCE, but it was expected to assure a longer stability of the device. Device efficiency values also increased with the Co 2+ /Co 3+ ratio, regardless of the physical status of the electrolyte, suggesting the importance of this parameter. Overall, the highest performance was achieved with 1.5 wt% XG, 0.21 M Co 2+ and Co 2+ /Co 3+ ratio equal to 3 (i.e., 0.07 M Co 3+ ), which led to an overall PCE of 4.47%</p>
        <p>(VOC 791 mV, JSC 7.52 mA cm -2 and FF 75.1%), outperforming in all photovoltaic parameters (except VOC) its liquid counterpart.</p>
        <p>Without underestimating this result, the main goal behind the development of a gelled electrolyte is to confer a longer lifetime to the device. Therefore, we monitored the photovoltaic performances of a-DSSCs for several days; indeed, the adoption of DoE allowed us to evaluate the effect of each parameter (and combinations of them) on cell stability. The variation percentages were calculated for each photovoltaic parameter and the results for all samples (after 48 h) are reported in Table S1 and Figure S3. To understand the different performance losses, multivariate analyses were computed for each PV response. Unfortunately, in this case DoE models were affected by a moderate fitting error, which limited the speculation on possible interactions between factors. However, some main effects on stability are clearly detectable from Figure S3. As expected, the presence of XG (yellow bars in Figure S3) was the main factor influencing both JSC and PCE stability. In liquid electrolytes, both of these parameters decreased by about 15%, while they were stable (when XG = 1.5 wt%) or even increased (when XG = 3 wt%) in gelled electrolytes. Thus, this improvement was directly dependent on the amount of XG added in the electrolyte formulation. A possible explanation of the ameliorated performances over time could be related to the improved permeation of the electrolyte into the TiO2 mesopores, which required a longer time in case of gelled matrix richer in XG. A better permeation should correspond to a more effective interaction at the TiO2-dye/electrolyte interface, leading to higher JSC. Interestingly, VOC and FF were quite stable over the aging period and their stabilities did not seem to be influenced by XG, but rather by redox shuttle component concentrations.</p>
        <p>The stabilizing effect of XG was further confirmed by comparing the most stable cells, measured after 5 days from device sealing and reported in Table 3. Indeed, liquid and quasisolid devices lost more than 20% and less than 5% of the initial PCE, respectively, Hence, XG matrix was proved to be able to entrap the solvent and to maintain the electrolyte properties and cell performances stable. ). This value is one of the highest ever reported in the literature for a gelled aqueous electrolyte and the highest for a cobalt-based quasi-solid a-DSSC. Moreover, the efficiency of gelled cells was shown to be stable over the explored five days of aging.</p>
        <p>Overall, this work demonstrates the feasibility of simple and low-cost gelled aqueous electrolytes based on cobalt complexes.</p>
        <p>Device assembly and testing: The general procedures adopted to prepare each substrate and to assembly final devices have been already reported in previous papers of our group and are recalled hereafter. Transparent conductive oxide glasses based on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) (15 â„¦ sq -1 ) were washed with water and detergent, then with ethanol and finally dried with compressed air. A nanometric compact layer (acting as a blocking layer) of TiO2 was deposited by spray-pyrolysis (400 Â°C for 1 h) from a titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution in ethanol. After cooling the substrate to room temperature, a layer of commercial TiO2 paste (18NR-T by Greatcell Solar Materials, average particle diameter up to 20 nm) was manually screen-printed on the so-obtained substrates and sintered at 520 Â°C for The final assembly procedure depends on the physical state of the electrolyte used. For liquid electrolytes, a gasket of polymeric thermoplastic film (Surlyn, DuPont) was placed between photoanode and counter electrode and heated up to 110 Â°C for 30 s in a hot press. Then, the cell was filled with the electrolyte through a hole by vacuum technique and finally sealed with glue.</p>
        <p>For gelled solutions with high viscosity, the electrolyte (2 mg) was spread on the sensitized TiO2 electrode with a spatula, then the cell was sealed in a hot press as described above.</p>
        <p>3</p>
        <p>full factorial design was planned on these three factors according to their variation ranges; the experimental outputs (i.e., the photovoltaic parameters) were assessed under 1 sun irradiation. Following the
