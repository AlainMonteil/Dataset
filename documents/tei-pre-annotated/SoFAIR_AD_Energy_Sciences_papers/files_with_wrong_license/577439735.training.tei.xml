        <p>Electrochemical CO 2 reduction is a promising strategy to store renewable electrical energy in the chemical bonds of carbon fuels. Currently, high performance has been reported for C 1 products, like CO and formate, which are selectively produced by a number of catalysts through 2e -/2H + steps. Due to shared reaction pathways, ethanol is always produced competitively with ethylene. A copper/gold heterojunction catalyst is reported here for the selective production of ethanol through asymmetrical electrohydrogenation of CO 2 . It is shown that bimetallic Cu/Au exhibits a 200-fold enhancement in the ratio of ethanol to ethylene compared with a single Cu catalyst.Electrochemical CO 2 reduction is a promising strategy to store renewable electrical energy in the chemical bonds of carbon fuels.

        <p>Copper is distinctive in electrocatalyzing reduction of CO 2 into various energy-dense forms, but it often suffers from limited product selectivity including ethanol in competition with ethylene. Here, we describe systematically designed, bimetallic electrocatalysts based on copper/gold heterojunctions with a faradaic efficiency toward ethanol of 60% at currents in excess of 500 mA cm -2 . In the modified catalyst, the ratio of ethanol to ethylene is enhanced by a factor of 200 compared to copper catalysts. Analysis by ATR-IR measurements under operating conditions, and by computational simulations, suggests that reduction of CO 2 at the copper/gold heterojunction is dominated by generation of the intermediate OCCOH*. The latter is a key contributor in the overall, asymmetrical electrohydrogenation of CO 2 giving ethanol rather than ethylene.Copper is distinctive in electrocatalyzing reduction of CO 2 into various energy-dense forms, but it often suffers from limited product selectivity including ethanol in competition with ethylene.

        <p>An important approach to global warming, and the energy crisis (1), is based on electrochemical reduction of CO 2 with solar, wind, or other renewable energies (2)(3)(4). Of the reduction products, the C 2+ chemicals, ethylene and ethanol, have high energy densities with significant global market values (5)(6)(7). High faradaic efficiencies and current densities have already been achieved for CO 2 reduction to 2e -products, like CO and formate based on a number of catalysts (8)(9)(10)(11). However, copper-based catalysts provide significant examples of metallic catalysts that generate C 2+ products (12)(13)(14). There are complications in this chemistry from shared reaction pathways. Key intermediates are produced that can lead to ethylene or ethanol competitively (13,15). Enhanced ethylene production has been achieved by implementing Cu-based catalysts via materials engineering (16)(17)(18). Efficient ethanol production by CO 2 reduction still remains a major challenge (19)(20)(21).An important approach to global warming, and the energy crisis (1), is based on electrochemical reduction of CO 2 with solar, wind, or other renewable energies (2)(3)(4).

        <p>Recently, new strategies have appeared for improving CO 2 reduction to ethanol. Ren et al. used an oxide-derived Cu x Zn catalyst that enhanced CO 2 electroreduction to ethanol. A two-site mechanism was proposed in which CO, generated at zinc sites, transferred to neighboring copper sites where C-C coupling occurs to form ethanol (15). Similarly, Morales-Guio et al. investigated the synergistic effect of a bimetallic Au/Cu catalyst for promoting ethanol formation (22). In a related study, Ag was also introduced to manipulate Cu surfaces. Addition of Ag enhances the diversity of binding sites which disrupts the coordination environment for intermediates on pathways for ethylene formation (19). However, ethanol selectivity in these studies was &lt; 30%, far lower than industrial requirements.Recently, new strategies have appeared for improving CO 2 reduction to ethanol.

        <p>A recent approach, with high ethanol selectivity, was reported by Xu et al. (23). It was based on an atomically dispersed copper catalyst, but its low current density, 1.23 mA cm -2 , was well below that needed for industrial requirements of &gt; 200 mA cm -2 . In accelerating the rate in aqueous solutions, a gas-phase CO 2 supply could help to overcome slow CO 2 diffusion (24). New approaches are required to improve both ethanol selectivity and current density (25,26).A recent approach, with high ethanol selectivity, was reported by Xu et al. (23).

        <p>The approach taken here was to focus on bimetallic Cu-Au catalysts with the utilization of density functional theory (DFT) to examine possible reaction pathways with an electrostatic self-assembly strategy to fabricate Cu/Au heterojunctions. Comparing single Au, single Cu, CuAu alloys, and isolated Cu-Au mixtures reveals that only Cu/Au heterojunctions display a high faradaic efficiency for ethanol (~60%). With a gas diffusion electrode, current densities as high as ~500 mA cm -2 were observed that exceed values for practical CO 2 electrolysis. In ethanol synthesis, in situ ATR-IR analysis has detected the key intermediate, OCCOH*, consistent with the results of DFT calculations.The approach taken here was to focus on bimetallic Cu-Au catalysts with the utilization of density functional theory (DFT) to examine possible reaction pathways with an electrostatic self-assembly strategy to fabricate Cu/Au heterojunctions.

        <p>Reaction pathways that lead to key products from CO 2 on CuAu, Cu/Au, and Cu as catalysts are shown in Fig. 1A and SI Appendix, Figs. S1 andS2.

The data for Cu and CuAu show that the appearance HCO* as an intermediate is in competition with OCCO* with the relative energies of 1.79 and 1.38 eV. At Cu/Au heterojunctions, direct CO coupling is favored (ΔG = 0.52 eV). In the overall reaction pathway, asymmetrical electrohydrogenation leads to an OCCH 3 intermediate.

As shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S4B, with CO as the feed gas, ethanol production on Cu was increased relative to CO 2 , but the Faradaic efficiency for ethanol was still low (~10%).

        <p>The optimal catalyst loading on carbon substrates was found to be 40% giving an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 43% shown in SI Appendix, Figs. S6 and S7. The impact of the Cu/Au catalyst was further evaluated by varying the Au to Cu ratio. Decreasing the ratio of Cu to Au leads to an increase in ethanol Faradaic efficiency that reaches 50% at a ratio of 1/2 (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). Based on the results of high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis (SI Appendix, Fig. S8), the more intense Cu + /Cu 0 peak that appears in the spectrum, with a decrease in lattice oxygen, shows that oxygen vacancies are generated on the partially reduced sample (31). As shown in Fig. 3B, the Faradaic efficiency for ethanol was improved to 60% at -0.8 V for partially reduced Cu/Au heterojunctions.The optimal catalyst loading on carbon substrates was found to be 40% giving an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 43% shown in SI Appendix, Figs.

        <p>In CO 2 reduction at gas diffusion electrodes (GDE), the gaseous CO 2 feed helps to overcome slow CO 2 transport. The latter is inherent in H cells and limits reaction rates (32). To demonstrate the behavior of the Cu/Au heterojunctions under industrial conditions, we evaluated CO 2 reduction in a flow cell coupled with a gas diffusion electrode (SI Appendix, Fig. S9). Gas-diffusion electrodes, that use gaseous reactants such as oxygen or carbon dioxide, can be used with vapor-fed injection in electrolytically wetted porous structures. Alterations in local reaction microenvironments can result in enhanced hydroxide activities at the electrode surface where water activity is lower. In proton-consuming CO 2 reduction, variations in pH can also lead to variations in reaction products.In CO 2 reduction at gas diffusion electrodes (GDE), the gaseous CO 2 feed helps to overcome slow CO 2 transport.

        <p>Our investigation of CO 2 reduction utilized a GDE with a high ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 60% in 1 M KOH at -0.75 V, where liquid products were determined by NMR spectra shown in SI Appendix, 3C. The ethanol partial current density of ~300 mA cm -2 on Cu/Au, at -0.75V vs. RHE, is a factor of 4 higher than at Cu. Fig. 3D shows a long term of electrode stability for over 90 h with an average current density of ~500 mA cm -2 at -0.75 V. SI Appendix, Fig. S13 summarizes the stateof-the-art in CO 2 reduction in the production of ethylene, ethanol, carbon monoxide, and formate. As shown in SI Appendix, Table S1, our Cu/Au heterojunctions output the highest ethanol partial current density among the reported catalysts. We further calculated carbon mass balance in flow cells in 1 M KOH (SI Appendix, Fig. S14) and found that 7.5% of carbon was converted to CO 2 RR products, which is close to the values (~7.6%) reported in the literature (33). In addition, the cathode energy efficiency was calculated to be 39.8% at an applied potential of -1 V vs. RHE (without considering any IR compensation).Our investigation of CO 2 reduction utilized a GDE with a high ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 60% in 1 M KOH at -0.75 V, where liquid products were determined by NMR spectra shown in SI Appendix, 3C.

        <p>Evaluation of the ethanol formation mechanism at Cu/Au heterojunctions utilized potential-dependent, ATR-IR measurements (SI Appendix, Fig. S15) showing evidence for the key intermediate OCCOH* as predicted by the DFT calculations. Fig. 4A shows potential-dependent, absorption spectra for Cu/Au in CO 2saturated 0.1 M KHCO 3 with bands appearing from 2,250-1,000 cm -1 . The corresponding spectra for Au and Cu were given in SI Appendix, Figs. S16 and S17, respectively. A band at 1,640 cm -1 appears arising from a O-H bending mode for H 2 O (34). A reversible band at 1,225 cm -1 appears from an O-Si-O stretching vibration in the SiO 2 overlayer on a silicon prism substrate.Evaluation of the ethanol formation mechanism at Cu/Au heterojunctions utilized potential-dependent, ATR-IR measurements (SI Appendix, Fig. S15) showing evidence for the key intermediate OCCOH* as predicted by the DFT calculations.

        <p>Increasing the potential of the electrode negatively past -0.8 V led to the accelerated appearance of gaseous products. Under these conditions, the catalyst layer was detached from the Si surface. Surface measurements showed that loss of the catalyst layer was accompanied by the appearance of surface O-Si-O vibrations (35). A band at 2,110 cm -1 was assignable to a line-bound CO (CO L ). The latter shifts to lower energies at negative scans (SI Appendix, Fig. S18), consistent with the appearance of a Stark effect, as described in earlier reports.Increasing the potential of the electrode negatively past -0.8 V led to the accelerated appearance of gaseous products.

        <p>Hydroxypropanone with a carbonyl group adjacent to hydroxyl (OCCOH) was selected as a surrogate to further prove the assignment of the bands cited above to the key intermediate OCCOH*. As shown in Fig. 4B, a band at ~1,099 cm -1 detected on Cu/Au heterojunction during CO 2 RR at -0.4V is consistent with the C-OH stretch of hydroxypropanone. Unfortunately, water exhibits a wide O-H bending band in the 1,700-1,550 cm -1 range, which may overlay the signal of C=O vibration. To prove the point, CO 2 RR on a Cu/Au heterojunction was performed in heavy water D 2 O where O-D bending peak shifts to around 1,150 cm -1 . In D 2 O solution shown in Fig. 4C, a band around 1,685 cm -1 was still observed, which is consistent with C=O stretching of hydroxypropanone. This suggests that in Fig. 4A, the peak at 1,640 cm -1 indeed originates from the C=O stretch. Moreover, in Fig. 4D, the C=O stretch at ~1,680 cm -1 in D 2 O solution, increases under more negative potentials, and shows the same trend with the C-OH band at ~1,109 cm -1 (increasing with more negative potentials in H 2 O electrolyte) as shown in Fig. 4A. These results clearly indicate the formation of the intermediate OCCOH* during CO 2 reduction over Cu/Au heterojunctions, while the intermediate was not detected over single Cu and single Au samples.Hydroxypropanone with a carbonyl group adjacent to hydroxyl (OCCOH) was selected as a surrogate to further prove the assignment of the bands cited above to the key intermediate OCCOH*.

        <p>Based on the DFT analysis, the intermediate OCCOH* adsorbs at Cu/Au heterojunctions with a single carbon atom bound to Au and the other to Cu. The high hydrogenation activity at Cu is caused by the carbon atom bound to Cu (C=O). The latter forms C-OH which undergoes hydrogenation at more negative potentials consistent with a strong interaction between C-OH and Cu. By contrast, the C=O interaction with Au tends to lead to desorption at more negative potentials (~-0.8 V).Based on the DFT analysis, the intermediate OCCOH* adsorbs at Cu/Au heterojunctions with a single carbon atom bound to Au and the other to Cu.
