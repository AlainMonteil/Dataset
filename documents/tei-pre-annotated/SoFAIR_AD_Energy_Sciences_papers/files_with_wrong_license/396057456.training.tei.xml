        <p>The potential for generating green hydrogen by electrolysis (water splitting) has resulted in a substantial amount of literature focusing on lowering the current production cost of hydrogen. A significant contributor to this high cost is the requirement for precious metals (namely Pt and Ir/Ru (oxides)) to catalyse the two main reactions involved in electrolysis: the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein we overview the current literature of non-precious metal HER and OER catalysts capable of efficient water splitting within a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyser, recording the activity and stability of each catalyst and allowing for direct comparison to be made. Additionally, we highlight the inapplicability of catalyst stability testing in many academic studies for commercial electrolyser applications and propose a universal stability-testing regime for HER and OER catalysts that more accurately mimics the conditions within an operating electrolyser.The potential for generating green hydrogen by electrolysis (water splitting) has resulted in a substantial amount of literature focusing on lowering the current production cost of hydrogen.

        <p>Green hydrogen gas is a promising vector for the storage and transportation of the energy generated from renewable sources due to its high energy density (140 MJ/kg), which exceeds that of current fuels, such as; coal (24 MJ/kg) and petrol (44 MJ/kg). [1] Hydrogen is mainly utilised in the chemical industry, where global production currently stands at 500 billion cubic meters (bm 3 ) per annum. [2] Hydrogen can be produced by a variety of techniques such as natural gas reformation, coal or biomass gasification and electrolytic processes. [3] The generation of hydrogen via water splitting, within an electrolyser, is considered the "greenest" hydrogen production technique, as it does not produce any direct carbon emissions when powered by renewable sources such as wave, wind and solar.

[14] PEM electrolysis is the most promising electrolytic method for producing green hydrogen due to its high-energy efficiencies comparable to AWS and SOE.

        <p>Eq.1. [24,25] Hence, the development of effective OER electrocatalysts is critical given that the OER is the limiting factor to an electrolyser's efficiency. [26] Only 4% of the global production of hydrogen is via electrolysis, [27][28][29] this is due to an absence of financial incentives to invest in "green" hydrogen energy from renewables, given that it is considerably more expensive than its fossil fuel counterparts to produce. For example, the cost to produce 1kg of hydrogen using grid electricity is currently ¬£11.40, [30] whereas, the cost to produce 1 gallon of diesel is ¬£4. 47. In automotive terms, 1kg of hydrogen is roughly equivalent in mileage to 1 gallon of diesel. [31] The above costs include capital and operating expenses. The high cost associated with hydrogen generation via PEM electrolysis is partly due to the expensive components utilized, such as the membrane electrode assembly (MEA), which accounts for 24% of the overall electrolyser cost. [28] The MEA contains low earth abundant precious metals, namely Pt and Ir, that are required to efficiently catalyse the HER and OER. [32][33][34][35] It is important to note that the price of pure Pt metal has increased from ¬£10.58 to ¬£28.23 per gram in the last 20 years.

[39,40] Given the aim of reducing the cost of hydrogen production via PEM electrolysis, researchers have attempted to produce NPM catalysts capable of efficient water splitting. In order for NPMs to have the potential of replacing precious metal catalysts, within a commercial electrolyser, they need to exhibit low overpotentials towards the HER or the OER and achieve high current densities in acidic conditions.

        <p>is therefore a critical metric to assessing a NPM catalysts feasibility for use within commercial PEM electrolysis. [54] Typical loading of commercial Pt/C on the cathode of a PEM electrolyser is 0.5-1.0 mgPt cm -2 , where the mass activity of Pt/C is ca. 0.27 A mg -1 at 50 mV (vs. RHE).

[58] Note, that a commercial PEM electrolyser has been quoted to exhibit a lifetime of up to 60000 h with no decay in cell voltage. [59,60] The outlook regarding the decline in PEM electrolyser performance is currently focused on catalyst degradation at the anode, however these degradation mechanisms are poorly understood.

        <p>In recent years, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD's) such as MoS2, [42,64] MoSe2, [44,65] WS2 [66,67] and WSe2 [44,68] have been shown to be promising cathodic materials to act as HER catalysts. A TMD nanosheet consists of two layers of chalcogens surrounding a single plane of a transition metal, where multiple layers are bonded by out-of-plane Van Der Waals interactions. [53] TMD's contain two anisotropic planes: the relatively inert basal planes, and the highly active edge planes, which exhibit a fast rate of heterogeneous electron transfer (HET). [69] An example of the use of a TMD towards the HER is a study by Wang et al. [70] who electrochemically tuned 2H-MoS2 with Li via a lithiation reaction, with sulfonated MoS2 (S-MoS2) conducting Li electrochemical intercalation. This resulted in a layer exfoliation and 2H to + 1T phase conversion (semi conducting to metallic). Li-MoS2 was chemically deposited onto carbon fibre paper and exhibited a HER onset potential of ca. -0.10 V (vs. RHE). For comparison, the optimal polycrystalline Pt electrode exhibits a HER onset potential of -0.01 V (vs. RHE). [71] The 1T phase of MoS2 possesses a larger number of active sites compared to the 2H phase, which results in a higher charge transfer rate. Due to the metallic character in the partially filled d-band the 1T phase is 10 7 times more conductive than the 2H phase. [72] Increasing the ECSA of the electrode by reducing the size of the deposited nanoparticles also enhances conductivity and allows for stronger interactions. The 1T phase of Li-MoS2 exhibits high achievable current densities of -200 mA cm -2 at Œ∑= 200 mV; and exhibits a mass activity of 0.20 A mg -1 at 0.1 V (vs. RHE), which is nearing the mass activity of commercial Pt/C (0.27 A mg -1 at 0.05 V (vs. RHE)). [73,74] However, there is insufficient stability data to conclude the suitability of the material within a PEM electrolyser. A small potential window between + 0.1 to -0.2 V (vs. RHE) was used to assess the variance in HER onset potential over 7000 cycles. This is not representative of the measured cell voltage of an operating PEM cell using benchmark Pt/C and Ir catalyst materials, which can be between + 1.4 and + 2.0 V. [75] When assessing catalysts, the complete potential range of a PEM electrolyser must be taken into account. This is due to the process of passivity, where corrosion of the catalyst layers during periods of electrolyser inactivity, or during cell operation, can lead to oxidative conditions within the cathodic catalyst layer. [76] Wang and co-workers [70] carried out potentiostatic measurements at a Œ∑= 118 mV (vs. RHE) which reflected little variation in the current density (ca. -10 mA cm -2 ) over a 2 hour duration. The duration of this stability measurement is too short when compared against the benchmark stability of the Pt/C catalyst, which remains stable for more than 50 hours within the same conditions. Additionally, PEM electrolysers quote a stack lifetime of between 20000-60000 hours, [77] therefore more information must be provided regarding the stability of this HER catalyst.In recent years, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD's) such as MoS2, [42,64] MoSe2, [44,65] WS2 [66,67] and WSe2 [44,68] have been shown to be promising cathodic materials to act as HER catalysts.

        <p>The HER catalysis of TMD's can also be optimised by hybridisation with a graphitic material such as graphene and carbon nanotubes. Introducing graphitic additives is a method of increasing the number of electronic conductive pathways and therefore the conductivity of a material. [78] Doping TMD's with transition metals increases electron density at the electrocatalytic active sites, and thus facilitates electron transfer at the edge planes. [79] Guo et al. [80] enhanced the catalysis and conductivity of MoS2 with Vanadium and Nitrogen dopants and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), respectively: V, N-MoS2/rGO. The V, N-MoS2/rGO composite was synthesized via a solvothermal method, which increased the number of defect sites on the basal and edge planes. A HER onset potential of -0.03 V (vs. RHE) was reported by the V, N-MoS2/rGO suggesting excellent HER kinetics. The V, N-MoS2/rGO also displays a high achievable current density of -100 mA cm -2 at an overpotential of ca. 160 mV, however there is no statement of mass activity, hence there is no defining activity metric to assess whether the V, N-MoS2/rGO is a feasible cathodic alternative to commercial Pt/C within a PEM electrolyser. Note that previous reports have stated the mass activity of MoS2/rGO to be 0.085 A mg -1 at 0.1 V (vs. RHE) [81,82] Chronoamperometric measurements at Œ∑= 90 mV (vs. RHE) for 20h exhibits no variation in a current density of -20 mA cm -2 . The absence of any long-term stability data involving TMD's is likely a result of their instability within aqueous solutions, over a large pH range. The suitability of any MoS2 containing materials for PEM electrolysis is highly unlikely given the formation of oxidative defects, in the form of MoO3, on the surface of MoS2 nanosheets when in the presence of water. [83] It is also common to hybridise MoSe2 with graphene additives. [84,85] Certain studies have highlighted that MoSe2 expresses the smallest band gap of all TMD's and therefore exhibits the best conductivity, where direct bandgaps of 1.88, 1.57, 2.03 and 1.67 eV relate to MoS2, MoSe2, WS2 and WSe2. [86] Tang et al. [87] hydrothermally prepared MoSe2 nanosheets and MoSe2/rGO which exhibited HER onset potentials of -0.15 and -0.05 V (vs. RHE), respectively. The HER onset potential exhibited by the MoSe2/rGO hybrid is stated as an improvement on its MoS2The HER catalysis of TMD's can also be optimised by hybridisation with a graphitic material such as graphene and carbon nanotubes.

A HER onset potential of -0.03 V (vs. RHE) was reported by the V, N-MoS2/rGO suggesting excellent HER kinetics. The V, N-MoS2/rGO also displays a high achievable current density of -100 mA cm -2 at an overpotential of ca. 160 mV, however there is no statement of mass activity, hence there is no defining activity metric to assess whether the V, N-MoS2/rGO is a feasible cathodic alternative to commercial Pt/C within a PEM electrolyser. Note that previous reports have stated the mass activity of MoS2/rGO to be 0.085 A mg -1 at 0.1 V (vs. RHE) [81,82] Chronoamperometric measurements at Œ∑= 90 mV (vs. RHE) for 20h exhibits no variation in a current density of -20 mA cm -2 . The absence of any long-term stability data involving TMD's is likely a result of their instability within aqueous solutions, over a large pH range. The suitability of any MoS2 containing materials for PEM electrolysis is highly unlikely given the formation of oxidative defects, in the form of MoO3, on the surface of MoS2 nanosheets when in the presence of water. [83] It is also common to hybridise MoSe2 with graphene additives. [84,85] Certain studies have highlighted that MoSe2 expresses the smallest band gap of all TMD's and therefore exhibits the best conductivity, where direct bandgaps of 1.88, 1.57, 2.03 and 1.67 eV relate to MoS2, MoSe2, WS2 and WSe2. [86] Tang et al. [87] hydrothermally prepared MoSe2 nanosheets and MoSe2/rGO which exhibited HER onset potentials of -0.15 and -0.05 V (vs. RHE), respectively. The HER onset potential exhibited by the MoSe2/rGO hybrid is stated as an improvement on its MoS2</p>
        <p>counterpart, where a comparative study displays a HER onset potential of -0.08 V (vs. RHE) for its MoS2/rGO hybrid. [82] Additionally, the previously reported values of 0.085 and 0.14 A g -1 for the mass activity of MoS2/rGO and MoSe2/rGO at 0.1 V (vs. RHE) demonstrates that MoSe2 exhibits superior HER catalysis (Note: the mass activity of MoSe2 is still not competitive with commercial Pt/C). [88,89] This is explained by density functional theory (DFT) calculations for Gibbs free energy for hydrogen absorption (ŒîG 0 H) at different H + surface coverages on each TMD nanosheet. A proficient HER catalyst such as Pt will exhibit a ŒîG 0 H value close to the thermoneutral value (ŒîG 0 H = 0). [90] Values of -0.14 and -0.23 eV, are expressed by MoSe2 at 75% H + surface coverage and MoS2 at 50% H + surface coverage, respectively. Note that the values of ŒîG 0 H for MoSe2 and MoS2 stated within this study were those that were closest to the thermoneutral value. Tang and coworkers probed the stability of their MoSe2/rGO catalyst deposited on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) using chronoamperometry measurements at 200 mV, where a slight degradation in current density from ca. 13.0 to ca. 12.5 mA cm -2 was observed over a 2 hour duration. It should be noted that displaying a catalyst stability study for a duration of 2 hours is not sufficient to conclude that a catalyst displays efficient HER catalysis. Therefore, it is not appropriate to conclude that the MoSe2/rGO catalyst utilised within this study is applicable to commercial PEM electrolysis given that the benchmark Pt/C catalyst remains stable for up to 50counterpart, where a comparative study displays a HER onset potential of -0.08 V (vs. RHE) for its MoS2/rGO hybrid.

        <p>Metal organic frameworks (MOF's) are typically organic/inorganic porous materials composed of grouped or ungrouped metal centres bound to organic ligands to exhibit a crystalline morphology. [92] The HER catalysis displayed by MOF's is determined by a number of factors. The highly porous nature of MOF's results in surface roughness and therefore a high number of exposed active sites and enhanced heterogeneous electron transfer (HET). The HET process occurs at the triple phase boundary, which comprises of the electrolyte, catalyst phases and gaseous species within a PEM electrolyser. [93] Porosity also results in a large ECSA, which allows for the significant interface between the electrolyte and catalyst surface. Surface porosity plays a significant role in the nature of hydrogen adsorption and desorption, where stronger proton adsorption leads to a faster supply of protons, but can also lead to slow release of hydrogen from active sites, hence poor HER kinetics. The porosity of MOF's may be tuned to achieve balanced adsorption/desorption behaviours. The nature of adsorption and desorption is dependent on the interaction between unfilled d orbitals of the transition metal and s orbitals of hydrogen. [94] MOF's possess compositional flexibility, where the transition metal d orbitals can be tuned to increase electron density and enhance the HER activity. [95] Pristine MOF's often suffer from poor conductivity and high charge transfer resistance. This can be mitigated by anchoring MOF's to carbon supports, which can significantly improve catalytic activity by increasing the number of electron conductive pathways. [96,97] Zhu et al. [98] developed a cobalt embedded nitrogen graphene aerogel (Co-N-GA) whilst they controlled the porosity by confining the growth of MOF's within the graphene aerogel. The Co-N-GA exhibits excellent catalysis towards the HER with a HER onset potential of ca. electrolysers relies on its mass activity and stability within acidic media. The mass activity of the Co-N-GA is not reported within the study and there is no data within the literature regarding a comparable HER catalyst within acidic media. This metric should be considered in future studies utilising this catalyst. Promising stability data is offered within the study where chronoamperometry at -0.11 V (vs. RHE) does not alter the current density at -45 mA cm -2 .Metal organic frameworks (MOF's) are typically organic/inorganic porous materials composed of grouped or ungrouped metal centres bound to organic ligands to exhibit a crystalline morphology.

        <p>However, there is no evidence of the Co-N-GA's corrosion resistance over a longer duration than 5000s. Given that the HER activity of this catalyst is benchmarked against Pt/C, the stability must also be referenced to Pt/C. The absence of long-term stability data is likely a result of the instability of the GA component in acidic conditions, as literature suggests that graphene degrades with prolonged exposure to water, and low pH conditions. [99][100][101] Isolated metal atoms (Ni, Fe and Co) have previously demonstrated proficient electrochemical activity towards the HER, due to their low coordination and unsaturated atoms functioning as active sites. [102] Fan et al. [103] developed an activated-Ni-carbon (A-Ni-C) catalyst, by carbonising an Ni-MOF precursor at 700‚ÑÉ to obtain Ni@C, where HCl leaching was repeated to dissolve exposed Ni metal. A constant potential was applied to activate the catalysts (shown in Figure 2(A)).However, there is no evidence of the Co-N-GA's corrosion resistance over a longer duration than 5000s.

        <p>The A-Ni-C catalyst displays a HER onset potential of -0.03 V (vs. RHE) and achieves a current density of -100 mA cm -2 at Œ∑= 112 mV as shown in Figure 2(B).

In the temperature range 65-75¬∞C, full nickel dissolution is likely achieved in less than 200 minutes. [105] The thermal and acidic instability of single atom Ni make it unsuitable for cathodic application within a PEM electrolyser. Similarly, Co and Fe dissolve in 0.5 M H2SO4 under thermal and potential control, however, corrosion of these metal atoms may be inhibited by alloying with metal ions such as Zn 2+ and Mn 2+ .

        <p>For example iron phosphides, FeP, Fe2P and Fe3P all exhibit different catalytic activity and stability in acidic media. [110] The crystal systems of FeP, Fe2P and Fe3P are orthorhombic, hexagonal and tetragonal, respectively. [111][112][113] Fe3P is made up of the weakest covalent bonds in the ferric species but exhibits the strongest ionic interactions, largest metallicity and contains the largest number of Fe-Fe interactions. Exposed stepped surfaces of 3-fold Fe and Fe-Fe bridge sites are thought to exhibit affinity for H + ions, where Fe-P sites result in weaker adsorption of H + ions. [114] Similarly to the iron phosphides, Ni-Ni interactions are responsible for strong hydrogen absorption, whereas Ni-P interactions exhibit weaker H + affinity. An increase in the transition metal content leads to pronounced d-band character across the fermi level, [115] which results in advantageous adsorption/desorption behaviours, larger areas of electron density and a higher number of active sites within the compound. [116] Moon et al. [117] demonstrated that the Ni2P crystal is made up of two types of Ni and P site, denoted in Figure 3(A) as Ni (I), Ni (II), P (I) and P (II). typically assessed by CV up to 10,000 cycles, [118][119][120] therefore, 500 CV cycles is not sufficient to assess the longevity of a catalysts onset potential. The corrosion resistance and stability of the Ni2P catalyst is not displayed within the study with no chronopotentiometric data to assess long-term durability. Transition metals alloyed with P show reduced metal dissolution in acidic media, as it is less thermodynamically favoured. Ni2P with a phosphorus content of ~30% P exhibits excellent corrosion resistance, making it more suitable as a cathodic catalyst layer within a PEM electrolyser; whereas, phosphorus content of ~15% P in a TMP is unsuitable, as stability and PEM cell lifetime would be reduced. [76] However, higher P content can also lead to the restriction of electron delocalization in the transition metal, hence reducing the conductivity and the HER catalysis. [121] Wang et al. [122] electrodeposited NiP on carbon fibre paper (CP) which displayed an overpotential of 18 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4. The CP@Ni-P remained stable after 150 hours of chronopotentiometry at -10 mA cm -2 in acidic conditions. XPS conducted before and after the stability measurement showed that, the major phase of the CP@Ni-P catalyst was Ni5P4 with minor contributions from Ni2P and NiP2. This is a prime example of how a higher P content can lead to excellent durability. It is also an example of how X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) can be used to analyse the composition of samples after long duration stability testing, where major phases responsible for specific properties, such as stability, may be quantified. This information can then be used to further tune the properties of a catalyst. Note: the mass activity data regarding the use of TMP's towards the HER in acidic conditions is sparse and inconsistent within the literature, in terms of the potential at which the mass activity is determined, therefore is not representative of TMP's this reported manuscript.

        <p>Unary metal oxides such as MnOx, FeOx, CoOx and NiOx have received considerable attention due to them being materials that show corrosion-resistant properties and good OER activity in acidic conditions. The stability of these oxides increases across the first row of transition metals (Ni to Mn), due an increase in the metal-oxygen bond strength, defining MnOx as a highly stable material within low pH electrolytes. [134] However, the stability observed for MnOx comes at the cost of reduced OER activity, being that four adjacent Mn III sites are required to produce two Mn IV sites (the phase required for oxygen bonding). [135] The small probability of coordinating four grouped Mn III sites results in a material that exhibits poor OER activity in acidic media. Conversely, OER activity increases moving across the first row of the transition metals (Mn to Ni), owing to a weakening of the metal-oxygen interactions, which also results in reduced corrosion resistance.Unary metal oxides such as MnOx, FeOx, CoOx and NiOx have received considerable attention due to them being materials that show corrosion-resistant properties and good OER activity in acidic conditions.

[126] benchmarked the performance of mixed metal oxides and unary metal oxides in 1 M H2SO4 based on OER activity, stability, ECSA and Faradaic efficiency.</p>

        <p>The mass activities of the unary metal oxides are not reported within this study. However, literature mass activity values of 0.11, 0.04, 0.03 and 0.12 A g -1 correspond to CoOx, NiOx, FeOx and CoFeOx, respectively. [137] These values coincide with the findings by McCrory and co-workers given that CoOx and CoFeOx exhibit mass activities closest to that of IrO2 (ca. 0.30 A g -1 ). The mass activity values exhibited by the metal oxides are not competitive with IrO2, however financial incentives to implement these catalysts within the anode of PEM electrolysers could arise from the low cost of raw Co, Fe and Ni metal (&lt; ¬£0.05 g -1 ) [138] compared to the high cost of pure Ir metal (ca. ¬£58.00 g -1 ). [37] Only IrOx exhibited stability in acidic conditions. The instability of each electrodeposited non-noble catalyst was outlined by cycling for 2 hours under oxidative conditions, given that all materials exhibited similar catalytic performance to the GC support. The observed instability arises when basic metal oxides come into contact with strong acids, protonation occurs throughout the metal oxide framework, resulting in weak M-O interactions. [139] The strongly acidic 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte is rarely used in catalysis studies and is likely not representative of the pH conditions within a PEM electrolyser. However, various studies have highlighted the instability of unary metal oxides in higher pH ranges of 2-3, in which certain mixed metal oxides exhibit stability. [134,135,140,141] Huynh et al. [142] designed a number of electrochemically active and acid-stable earth catalysts supported on FTO. The presence of Mn and Pb in the composites provides a structural framework that prevents the reduction of the catalytic active sites through the elimination of O2, which would lead to M-O bond weakening. Instead, the elements that provide structural frameworks are oxidised to more stable forms i.e. PbOx ‚Üí PbO2, hence providing a more corrosion resistant composite. [141] Chronopotentiometry was used to evaluate the long-term acid stability of the materials.

        <p>Mn and Pb are often utilised as structural frameworks to improve corrosion resistance within active metal oxides, however, unary MnOx's are limited by poor OER catalysis. Adjustment of the transition metal d-band position relative to the fermi level is thought to increase the number of optimal interactions of reactant and product species at the catalytic active sites. An increase in the number of optimal reactant-product interactions facilitates efficient adsorption and desorption processes. As a result the OER onset potential is lowered. [143] Patel et al. [144] tuned the d-band in amorphous MnO2 with Cu and F to match the fermi level of IrO2 (-1.33 eV). Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 and Cu1.5Mn1.5O4:F were synthesized by a facile procedure and supported on porous Ti foil, where F was incorporated in %wt variations to achieve the correct linear shift of the d-band towards that of IrO2. The Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 and Cu1.5Mn1.5O4:F composites both exhibited OER onset potentials of + 1.43 V (vs. RHE), which matches the catalysis of IrO2. The optimum incorporation of 10 %wt F into the Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 composite, showed improvements in the current density at + 1.55 V (vs. RHE) where current densities of + 9.15, + 6.36 and + 7.74 mA cm -2 were displayed by the Fdoped and non-doped composites, as well as IrO2, respectively. The following results suggest that F doping enhances electrical conductivity of the composite at 10 wt% incorporation. Surrounding literature also suggests that F doping has a positive influence on the stability of transition metal catalysts within acidic conditions. This is due to an increase in the number of polar metal-F interactions with high binding energies. [145][146][147][148][149] Patel and co-workers carried out electrochemical stability studies that showed minimal deviation in OER performance over the course of 6000 cycles, with chronoamperometric measurements at + 1.55 V (vs. RHE), over a 24 hour duration also exhibiting no deviation in current density. However, there is a lack of long-term stability data to assess the suitability of fluorine doped metal oxides for anodic application within PEM electrolysers, where chronopotentiometric measurements for up to 200 hours and CV cycling for a minimum of 50,000 cycles should be exhibited to compare against the benchmark IrO2 catalyst.Mn and Pb are often utilised as structural frameworks to improve corrosion resistance within active metal oxides, however, unary MnOx's are limited by poor OER catalysis.

        <p>It is possible to impart greater stability and activity to mixed metal oxides with the addition of Sb, which is thermally stable. [150] Moreno-Hernandez et al. [151] sputter coated NixMn1-xSb1.6-1.8Oy species based catalysts onto conductive films of antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO) and evaluated catalytic activity in 1.0 M H2SO4 by cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry. In general, films containing both Ni and Mn exhibited the lowest overpotentials, where the lowest over potential of 672 mV (vs. RHE) was displayed by Ni0.5Mn0.5Sb1.7Oy. Chronopotentiometry under galvanostatic control at 10 mA cm -2 and cyclic voltammetry outlined that NixMn1-xSb1.6-1.8Oy was stable for more than 150 hours, with negligible increases in over potential. At several points during chronopotentiometric measurements, ICP-MS was used to determine the concentration of dissolved solids within the acidic electrolyte, where 56, 17 and 11% of the Mn, Ni and Sb, respectively, had leached from the Ni0.5Mn0.5Sb1.7Oy electrode after 144 hours. The leaching of Mn within the composite provides a stable structural framework around the active surface of Ni leading to enhanced OER catalysis. [152] Further stability of the composite is explained by the formation of the crystalline MSb2O6 rutile-type phase. The remarkable observations within this study outline the most stable phase of mixed metal oxides through the doping of the composite with antimony. Incorporation of Ni0.5Mn0.5Sb1.7Oy into the catalyst layer of the anodic side of a PEM electrolyser would exhibit a 57% Faradaic efficiency. [151] 3.3 Beyond metal oxides TMD's typically exhibit good OER activity, [153,154] however suffer from dissolution in acidic conditions and poor stability in a highly oxidative environment, which hampers their application within PEM electrolysers. [83] Wu et al. [155] exfoliated MoS2 and TaS2 nanosheets using liquid phase and lithium intercalation and assessed the catalysis of the trigonal prismatic (2H) versus the octahedral (1T) phases in 0.5 M H2SO4.

[157][158][159] Excellent electrical conductivity and high surface area for catalyst dispersion are properties that shape carbon-based materials as effective catalyst supports within fuel cells and the cathodic side of PEM electrolysers. Anchoring cathodic catalyst materials to carbon-based supports has many benefits: carbon supports provide electronic conduction pathways between the electrode and the catalyst; carbon supports allow catalytic materials to be deposited on a nanoparticle level; and carbon materials are also durable in acidic media. [160] Catalyst supports are therefore key to the current output of the electrolyser and its longevity. [161][162][163][164][165] However, carbon based supports are not suitable for application within the anodic side of electrolysers given that they suffer fast corrosion under high oxidative potentials. [166] Effective support materials can enhance the electro kinetics of the anodic catalyst layer. Increasing the electroactive surface area allows for the optimal surface dispersion of highly active particles that lower the OER onset potential. This increase in surface area also enables the low loading of active catalyst materials thus reducing the costing associated with the MEA. Degradation of the catalyst layers can result in reduced system and stack lifetimes within PEM electrolyser cells. [167] Therefore, research of corrosion resistant materials provides a pathway to increasing the lifetime of PEM electrolyser technologies. Titanium is typically used as the anodic support material within PEM electrolysers. [168] Titanium (TiO2) and tin oxides (SnO2) have been studied as alternative OER supports given their high resistance to anodic oxidative conditions, however are mainly utilised as supports for IrO2 or RuO2 within the literature and are limited by their poor electronic conductivity (‚àº10 -6 S cm -1 ).

The Fe2O3/TiO2 NWs and Fe2O3 supported on Ti foam exhibited OER onset potentials of + 1.46 and + 1.63 V (vs. RHE). Given that Fe2O3 is unstable in acidic media within anodic oxidative conditions, it is important to assess the stabilizing effect of the titania nanowires. Chronopotentiometry at + 1.9 V (vs. SCE) for 20 h in 0.5 M H2SO4 displayed current density decays of 30.3 and 66.7% for the Fe2O3/TiO2 NWs and Fe2O3 supported on Ti foam, respectively. It is clear that Fe2O3 embedded within titania nanowires experiences less current degradation than its counterpart without a titania support. Antimony doped tin oxide (ATO) is a support material highlighted for its high conductivity (0.57 S cm -1 ), thermal stability (&gt; 250 ¬∞C) and acid stability in oxidative conditions.

[58] None of these HER studies coincide their stability measurements with ICP-MS measurements, thus there is a lack of information pertaining to leaching within HER specific catalysts. There is progress within the synthesis of HER catalysts, where alloying active metals such as Ni, Fe or Co with highly stable metals such as Pb, Zn, Sb, Ta or Mn creates a structural framework that exhibits promising stability in acidic conditions. This is also observed when active metal centres are doped with optimal quantities of phosphorus, such as CP@Ni-P which remains stable after 150 hours of chronopotentiometry at -10 mA cm -2 in acidic conditions. [122] It is often the case that more comprehensive stability examinations take place in studies regarding OER specific catalysts. This is likely due to the high oxidative potentials at the surface of the anode as the Faradaic process of the OER proceeds. Because of this, many studies deposit OER specific catalysts on non-carbon based supports such as ATO or FTO. Studies that support their OER specific catalysts on carbonaceous materials are uninstructive on the basis that data obtained by this method is not translational to commercial PEM electrolysis. However, the majority of studies that take this factor into account carry out more extensive stability studies, involving chronopotentiometric measurements for 50 hours or more, coupled with ICP-MS analysis. The same principles for catalyst synthesis used in HER catalysis apply to OER catalysts too, where stable elements provide a structural framework for active metals and therefore high stability. OER catalysts such as: Ni2Ta, [156] MnSb1.7Oy, NiSb1.8Oy and Ni0.5Mn0.5Sb1.7Oy [151] synthesised using these principals achieve catalyst durability from 70-200 hours, where the benchmark OER catalyst IrO2, is known to remain stable for up to 200 hours during chronopotentiometric measurements. [57] Another key consideration for the application of NPM catalysts at the anode or cathode of a PEM electrolyser is mass activity (current output per unit mass). This activity metric merges catalyst loading and current output to differentiate between excellent catalysis because of ultra-high catalyst loading, and relative catalysis with low catalyst loading. [182] If the mass activities of NPM HER and OER catalysts are benchmarked against the mass activities of the precious metal catalysts currently utilized in commercial PEM electrolysis, the economic viability of these catalysts for use within PEM electrolysers can be calculated based on required quantities and cost of raw materials.hours. [58] None of these HER studies coincide their stability measurements with ICP-MS measurements, thus there is a lack of information pertaining to leaching within HER specific catalysts.
