        <p>Developing a sustainable photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) solar drying system is essential to maintain zero carbon emission in the drying process. This work represents the drying of star fruit in a novel PVT solar dryer to analyze the sustainability indicators based on the energy and exergy performance with the environmental and economic evaluation (4E) under forced convection drying (FCD) and natural convection drying (NCD). The moisture content of star fruit in the PVT solar dryer is decreased from 10.11 (d.b) to 0.19 (d.b.) in 12.50 hr and 14.50 hr under FCD and NCD, respectively. The same has been obtained in open sun conditions with a drying time of 22.00 hr. The PVT energy and exergy efficiencies are 69.27% and 31.12% in FCD mode, respectively, and 43.58% and 17.89% in NCD mode. The drying efficiency of 15.27% and 13.98%, specific moisture extraction rate of 0.1786 kg/kWh and 0.6657 kg/kWh, and specific energy consumption of 12.37 kWh/kg and 3.57 kWh/kg are evaluated in FCD and NCD modes, respectively. The drying system payback time is 1.40 yr and 1.70 yr in FCD and NCD mode, respectively.Developing a sustainable photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) solar drying system is essential to maintain zero carbon emission in the drying process.

        <p>The use of fossil fuels in heating and power generation is the leading cause to increase carbon emissions and greenhouse gases. A sustainable alternative is required to decline the dependency on fossil fuels. Solar energy is a promising solution of renewable energy sources to supply both heat and electricity using photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) technology [1]. The photovoltaic (PV) module converts a portion of the incident insolation into electrical power, and the rest turns into heat. The PV module efficiency is affected by the operating temperature of the solar cell [2]. In a PVT system, cooling the PV module improves the PV module efficiency. Thus thermal energy extraction is required to reduce the temperature of the PV module. The flowing of air or water below the PV modules is used in the PVT system to collect thermal energy and enhance electrical efficiency.The use of fossil fuels in heating and power generation is the leading cause to increase carbon emissions and greenhouse gases.

        <p>Several designs of PVT solar collectors have been employed with the solar drying system to reduce energy usage as well as post-harvest losses during the drying process in the non-grid areas [4]- [10]. PVT solar dryers also improve the dried product quality as a low-cost option, protecting it against environmental influences and substituting conventional energy sources with free, eco-friendly solar energy [11]- [15]. The PVT solar dryer aims to acquire the most significant amount of energy to be carried by air to the food while also removing the moisture present in the food in the least period. In order to choose the optimal drying method for a given product, the analysis of the impact of airflow and temperature on the system performance is necessary [16]- [18]. As the demand for efficient and sustainable processes grows, energetic and exergetic analysis of dryers becomes increasingly essential to enhance the design and technical sustainability.Several designs of PVT solar collectors have been employed with the solar drying system to reduce energy usage as well as post-harvest losses during the drying process in the non-grid areas [4]- [10].

        <p>The energetic and exergetic investigation of the solar dryer is beneficial to understanding the system's thermodynamic behavior. The different configurations of the solar dryer, such as infrared convective dryer [19], mixed-mode solar dryer [20], indirect solar dryer [21], forced mode solar dryer with thermal energy storage [22], solar convective dryer [23], and solar dryer with phase change material [24] have been investigated based on energetic and exergetic performance indicators. The analysis of sustainability indicators is beneficial in attaining more efficient, ecologically friendly, long-term, and cost-effective energy consumption in drying systems. These measures provide sufficient information about the drying system's sustainability, thermodynamic effectiveness, and irreversibility. An optimal dryer can be developed by decreasing irreversibility by evaluating these indicators. A variety of studies have been conducted to assess the sustainability indicators in solar drying systems [25]- [29]. Estimating embodied energy, environmental and economic parameters is vitally essential to see the system's impact on industrial and practical applications. The energy consumption for manufacturing and processing the system and recovering this energy in the time it takes for the system to pay for itself has been found using embodied energy [24], [26], [27]. Many researchers have studied various research on environmental parameters to determine the scope of reducing fossil fuel consumption for the drying process.The energetic and exergetic investigation of the solar dryer is beneficial to understanding the system's thermodynamic behavior.

        <p>The PVT solar dryers have been utilized in a variety of drying experiments across the world. Veeramanipriya and Sundari [30] have developed a solar dryer with evacuated tube (ET) collectors and PV units. The cassava has been dried up to 10.67 (w.b.) from 91.50 (w.b.) by keeping the dryer temperature 30-40 °C above the ambient temperature. Singh et al.

Daghigh et al. [32] used PVT and ET collectors in a solar dryer to dry the Tarkhineh. The dryer efficiency is found 13.70% in PVT mode and 28.20% in ET mode with a payback time of 2.3 yr and 2.5 yr, respectively. Samimi-Akhijahani and Arabhosseini [33] investigated the solar drying time to dry tomato slices for variable airflow and product thickness for a PV panel-operated sun tracker-based solar dryer. The sun tracker solar dryer has shortened the drying time16.60-36.60%. Hidalgo et al. [34] compared PV-powered direct solar dryer performance in forced and natural convection for drying green onion. The dryer efficiency and specific moisture extraction rate were found to be 34.20% and 18.30 kWh/kg in natural and 38.30% and 16.40 kWh/kg in forced convection, respectively.The PVT solar dryers have been utilized in a variety of drying experiments across the world.

        <p>Previous researchers have examined the energetic and exergetic performance of various designs of solar dryers. However, the research on semi-transparent PVT collector combined solar dryer is limited. The novelty of this system is that the semi-transparent (glass to glass type) PV panel is not utilized as an energy collector in the conventional PVT solar dryer with indirect mode operation. This study uses the semi-transparent PV module in a solar drying system to enhance energy and exergy performance. Further, no analysis is available to investigate the sustainability and 4E (energy, exergy, environmental, and economic) indicators for drying star fruit in a semi-transparent PVT collector combined solar dryer. The improved performance of the PVT dryer offers a solution for the effective use of this system in industrial applications.

The values obtained of energy payback time are much less than the system life (30 yr). The environmental parameters under FCD and NCD mode are depicted in Fig. 14 (a), (b), and (c) for 10 to 30 yr system life with 5 yr time intervals. The CO2The system's total embodied energy (EE) is determined to be 3124.68 kWh. Figure 13 illustrates the share of every material employed in the fabrication of the drying system.
