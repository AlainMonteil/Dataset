        <p>Water scarcity is and will probably continue to be a critical issue around the world. Seawater desalination has provided quite some relief on fresh water shortage. For many developing countries and regions, reuse of wastewater is becoming important as unconventional water resources and essential for environmental and ecological protection [1,2]. Among various treatment solutions, membrane processes have been very successful because of their high energy efficiency and small footprint. A normal wastewater management includes a series of unit operations, as shown in Fig. 1, including pre-treatment, ultrafiltration, microfiltration, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis (RO), high pressure RO [3] [4,5]. However, significant amounts of saline brine is generated accompanied with organic contaminants; although the absolute volume is small, the energy consumption is high to reach near zero liquid discharge (nZLD), such as electrodialysis (ED) [6,7], mechanical vapor compression (MVC) [8][9][10], or the footprint is large as evaporation pond [10]. Integrated forward osmosis (FO) and membrane distillation (MD) was reported recently for treating shale-gas-flow-back water for reuse purpose [11], although technically viable, cost of FO-MD remains prohibited high.Water scarcity is and will probably continue to be a critical issue around the world.

        <p>Most current desalination technologies for treating highly saline brine are energy intensive, especially relying on high grade electric power supply [10]. Only MD, although thermal-driven, can work at a rather low feed temperature and thus can be satisfied with low grade thermal or solar energy [12,13] (Fig. 1). Hydrophobic porous membranes are utilized, which allows only vapor to diffuse across the porous structure. MD has demonstrated great potential in treating various streams including those containing high total dissolved solids with nearly complete rejection to non-volatile matters.Most current desalination technologies for treating highly saline brine are energy intensive, especially relying on high grade electric power supply [10].

        <p>However, MD has not gained large scale applications because of deleterious membrane performance due to fouling and consequent wetting. A hydrophobic membrane is characterized by a water contact angle (WCA) above 90 o whereas a superhydrophobic membrane above 150° and a low contact angle hysteresis &lt; 5 o (CAH, the difference between the advancing and receding contact angles) [14,15]. An omniphobic membrane has both a high WCA and low sliding angle and exhibits high repellence to low surface tension liquids; a hierarchical re-entrant structure combining with the layer of low surface energy generally contributes to omniphobicity [16][17][18]. Fouling and scaling of the hydrophobic MD membrane can cause deleterious performance as manifested by reduced permeate quality and flux. Recent advancement in the development of novel materials has attributed superhydrophobic membranes significant success in fouling mitigation [10,13,19,20]. Understanding the fouling resistance for superhydrophobic (SH) and omniphobic (OM) membranes has been mainly based on thermodynamic theories, but frequently challenged by contradictory results.However, MD has not gained large scale applications because of deleterious membrane performance due to fouling and consequent wetting.

        <p>Herein we will provide a brief account on the scaling and fouling phenomenon in MD, the preparation and performance of superhydrophobic and omniphobic membranes, the main stream of thermodynamic scaling and fouling models, and finally our understanding on the superhydrophobic effects on the fouling formation and mitigation. A new concept is proposed by introducing a hydrodynamic factor of slippage to fill in the gap. We further correlate quantitatively the wetting states to the hydrodynamic slip with experimental results to verify the finding. Stability and sustainability of the slip surface are critically analyzed and potential solutions are suggested. We expect that scientists and engineers would take this new concept for future development of robust hydrophobic membranes, modules as well as processes.Herein we will provide a brief account on the scaling and fouling phenomenon in MD, the preparation and performance of superhydrophobic and omniphobic membranes, the main stream of thermodynamic scaling and fouling models, and finally our understanding on the superhydrophobic effects on the fouling formation and mitigation.

        <p>In general, fouling is a process of unwanted matters aggregate/deposit on a membrane surface followed by increased mass transfer resistance and reduced rejection; based on their chemical physical characteristics, foulants are can be categorized as inorganic, organic in nature (Table 1) [21,22].In general, fouling is a process of unwanted matters aggregate/deposit on a membrane surface followed by increased mass transfer resistance and reduced rejection; based on their chemical physical characteristics, foulants are can be categorized as inorganic, organic in nature (Table 1) [21,22].</p>
        <p>Inorganic fouling is commonly known as scaling, referring to crystals, colloidal particles, mineral scales which either precipitate/ grow directly on the membrane surface or form in bulk solution first before aggregating on the surface [23,24]. The attachment of dissolved organic matters (humic acid, protein, polysaccharides, oils, etc.) to the membrane surface is termed as organic fouling [21], and the drivers for foulants adhesion can be van der Waals forces, electrostatic interaction and hydrophobic-hydrophobic interaction, which is well described by the Extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory (xDLVO) theory. The fouling layers can be removed by chemical treatment, but the performance restoration is poor and damage to the membrane surface and environment is the potential disadvantage [21,25]. Therefore, design of antifouling/scaling membranes are essential for the membrane development, and understanding the mechanism of fouling and scaling has been one of the main focuses in MD research [26]. The following sections will outline the major foulants often encountered in MD applications.Inorganic fouling is commonly known as scaling, referring to crystals, colloidal particles, mineral scales which either precipitate/ grow directly on the membrane surface or form in bulk solution first before aggregating on the surface [23,24].

        <p>Scaling often occurs for various feed streams including RO concentrate, produced water from oil/gas industry, underground or geothermal water [13,20]. Sparingly soluble salts play critical roles in inducing both homogeneous nucleation and impurity-induced (e.g., air, dust or other particles) heterogeneous nucleation, ultimately aggregating to visible bulky crystals [26]. The hydrophobic membrane surface readily incurs heterogeneous nucleation (Fig. 2a). Fig. 2 shows some typical examples of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), calcium sulfate (CaSO4) and silica scaling on different hydrophobic membrane surfaces. Scaling is often featured by an induction time before formation of a detectable scale phase either amorphous or in the form of "prenucleation" clusters of just a few atoms [27]. This would lead to the growth and deposition of crystals into membrane pores and even covering the membrane surface. Scaling leads to membrane wetting and consequently reduced permeate quality and flux [28], and propagation of the wetting frontier causes membrane integrity damage followed by transition from hydrophobic to hydrophilic matrix, and deteriorated permeate quality [28][29][30][31][32].Scaling often occurs for various feed streams including RO concentrate, produced water from oil/gas industry, underground or geothermal water [13,20].

        <p>For concentrating high salinity brine, most commonly discussed sparingly soluble inorganic salts were CaSO4 and silica. Carbonate chemicals are sensitive to solution alkalinity and pH. For simplicity, we classify the scaling in MD into three main categories: (1) Alkaline scalant, such as CaCO3 [33,34] [35] (Fig. 2b), is often observed in shale gas produced and flowback water [17,26] and seawater concentrate [36,37] (Table 1). CaCO3 scaling is solution pH sensitive [33,38,39] and temperaturedependent as its solubility is inversely related to temperature [25,[40][41][42]. The most effective chemicals to remove CaCO3 scale are acids [25,43]. (2) Non-alkaline, as represented by CaSO4, which is pHindependent [26]; CaSO4 mainly forms rod-like structures, but needle-like and rosette-like ones have also been observed (Fig. 2c) [31,[44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51]. CaSO4 scaling has three forms as a function of temperature [44,52]: dihydrate (gypsum, CaSO4•2H2O), hemihydrate (bassanite, CaSO4•0.5H2O) and anhydrite (CaSO4) [34]. The high adhesion strength and low solubility render CaSO4 a high scaling tendency and difficult to remove [53][54][55]. (3) Nonionic scale, such as that of silica (Fig. 2d), is less soluble in water and solvents than the ionic scale due to the absence of charges to break up and dissolve [22].For concentrating high salinity brine, most commonly discussed sparingly soluble inorganic salts were CaSO4 and silica.

        <p>Silica is practically ubiquitous in inland RO brine [56,57], geothermal water and shale gas produced water [58]. Silica scale is amorphous and formed via polymerization of silicic acid (e.g., NaSiO3, etc.) [59] with robust resistance to anti-scalants [34,60].

        <p>Similarly, long chain hydrocarbon oil, often found in the shale oil and gas produced water [17], readily fouls MD hydrophobic membranes because of the long-range hydrophobic-hydrophobic attraction [86,87]. Surfactants' lyophobic tails show strong affinity to hydrophobic membrane [30,80,88,89], but hydrophilic head-groups incur hydrophilic characteristics [81]. Once fouled by the surfactants, the membranes are prone to wetting by the feed streams though some contradictory results have been reported. For example, Wang et al [30,90,91] have shown that surfactant attachment to the membrane surface intrinsically inhibits surfactant-induced wetting rather than facilitates it, and Liquid Entry Pressure (LEP) of membranes is reduced. Literature also reveals that the combination of oil, surfactant and NaCl drastically deteriorates MD performance, but when the feed solution contains oil or surfactants or NaCl alone, the effect was not apparent [92]. Micropollutants present wide chemical structures and charge variations (Table 1). Treatment of micropollutant containing wastewater may suffer from fouling. However, due to the low concentration, the fouling by micropollutants were largely covered by other organic contaminants [82].Similarly, long chain hydrocarbon oil, often found in the shale oil and gas produced water [17], readily fouls MD hydrophobic membranes because of the long-range hydrophobic-hydrophobic attraction [86,87].

It is a very undesirable form of pollution, bacteria cells and micro-colonies attached on membrane surface with growth, the formed biofilm was hard to clean via physical or chemical methods [93]. High operational temperature and relatively high salinity of the feed limit the impacts imposed by the microbial growth [94]. Nonetheless, once formed on the membrane surface, the biofilms will enhance the concentration and temperature polarization, leading to declined permeate flux and quality [21].

        <p>to create superhydrophobic membranes using electrospinning, templating, soft lithography, sol-gel and layer-by-layer deposition [94]. The main strategy to create a superhydrophobic membrane is to physically increase surface roughness combined with chemical modification to endow a low surface energy. The use of CF4 plasma treatment increased the contact angle of a commercial PVDF microfiltration membrane from 130 o to 160 o , which was ascribed to the combined effect of a rough porous surface and fluorination [94]. One can also chemically modify the surface to increase the contact angle of a nanofiber surface [95], or nanoparticles coated surfaces [69] [16]. Electrospun [96] or electrospray [46] have been utilized to improve the surface roughness and the fluorination achieved by CF4 [97,98] or heptadecafluorotetrahydrodecyl trichlorosilane (denoted as 17-FAS) [99,100].

        <p>Fig. 3a shows the simplified model for the location where the fouling/scaling occurs at the first instance. For a hydrophilic membrane, there exists a water-solid (membrane material) interface, but for a hydrophobic membrane, ideally a water-solid-air forms the interface. Myriads of evidence supports that superhydrophobic membranes are superior to the normal hydrophobic ones in scaling and fouling resistance [46,48,94,101]. This implied that the water-solid-air interfaces for hydrophobic and superhydrophobic membranes are probably different, however frequently neglected.Fig. 3a shows the simplified model for the location where the fouling/scaling occurs at the first instance.

        <p>Surface fluorination is important in contributing to the omniphobicity. Omniphobic membranes have strong repellency towards a wide range of liquids demonstrating particularly stable performance when treating wastewaters containing low surface tension substances [103]. Moreover, surface omniphobicity can also delay or deter the onset of wetting when the feed solution contains low surface tension matters (e.g., ethanol, surfactants and oil molecules stabilized by excess of surfactants) [69,[104][105][106].Surface fluorination is important in contributing to the omniphobicity.

        <p>The xDLVO theory describes the thermodynamic intermolecular interactions between the foulant and membrane [124]: three different non-covalent forces, i.e., (1) Lifshitz-van der Waals (LW) interactions,; (2) electrical double layer (EL) interactions, and (3) Lewis acid-base (AB) or electronacceptor/electron-donor interactions, and hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions [125]. The interfacial free energy between the membrane and foulant provides an indication of the attraction or repulsion between two materials. xDLVO theory has often been utilized to interpret experimental results [67,87,89,[126][127][128][129] and severe organic fouling has been ascribed to hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions [67,75,77,79,87]. The theory implies that the electric interaction between the foulants and the hydrophobic membrane surface is negligible comparing to the LW and AB interactions [87,130]. This is correct in that at high salinity, the electrical double layer is largely suppressed due to a shortened Debye length [21], but LW and AB interactions remain unchanged [67,131]. However, experimental results showed that a strongly negatively charged superhydrophobic membrane was not fouled by negatively charged oil emulsions in a 1% NaCl solution [132] (Fig. 4) with dyes [133] present in the feed. The fact that the superhydrophobic membrane has a higher surface charge than its hydrophobic counterpart is considered as the main contributor to its superior performance. CF4 plasma treatment provides thorough fluorination for membrane materials and renders the membrane higher water repellency. Consequently, stronger hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions would have dictated that CF4 plasma modified PVDF membranes be less fouling resistant.

CF4-MP-PVDF membrane outperformed the virgin pillared PVDF membrane with a stable MD flux using supersaturated 14.7 mM CaSO4 feed (Fig. 6c). This result was contradictory to the classical nucleation theory which dictates that the Gibbs free energy of nucleation of both membranes would have been similar as well as scaling propensity (Fig. 5c).

        <p>A pinned wetting state of a hydrophobic membrane is close to a hydrophilic membrane with a water-solid interface as water penetrates into the surface pores and actual air fraction disappears from the surface. Thus, foulants or inorganic scalants in the feed can intimately contact the membrane materials, and the thermodynamic xDLVO and nucleation theory thus prevail. This explains that micropillared MP-PVDF membrane show similar scaling and fouling pattern to the commercial PVDF membrane as both are in a pinned state. However, for a suspended wetting state, the water-solid-air interface attribute large air fraction to reduce direct contact of foulants to membrane materials (Statement 1); moreover, it is non-static as slippage does not allow prolonged time for interaction thus mitigating formation of fouling and scaling (Statement 2).A pinned wetting state of a hydrophobic membrane is close to a hydrophilic membrane with a water-solid interface as water penetrates into the surface pores and actual air fraction disappears from the surface.

        <p>Retrospectively, observation of the suspended wetting and slip has been a coincident. Very recently, we demonstrated that even for a superhydrophobic membrane with suspended wetting, a slight overpressure in feed altered the suspended wetting to a more pinned wetting state, thus forfeited the membrane scaling resistance. Fig. 9 shows that at a steady feed flow, an over-pressure forces the water-gas interface to sag into the pillars, thus creating a non-slip condition for both MP-PVDF and CF4-MP-PVDF membranes, leading to severe scaling as demonstrated by a full coverage of both membranes with CaSO4 crystals [153]. However, when a pulse flow is applied, the suspended wetting in CF4-MP-PVDF membrane is enabled leading to a lift-up of the water-gas interface and consequent scale mitigation effects. The SEM images showed that even after experiment termination, the membrane surface appeared clean and nearly intact. Because the pulse creates perpendicular fluctuation at the air-liquid interface, the effect is an actual dynamic non-static situation similar to a slip surface. The results demonstrate that a combination of superhydrophobic slip surface plus a pulse flow can lead to scaling resistance. Unfortunately, most of the researches on superhydrophobic membranes have failed to analyze the wetting state and understand the feed overpressure effects on the wetting state; it is therefore understandable that the very important slippage effect on fouling and scaling has been hidden for decades. 4.6 Brief on potential superhydrophobic/omniphobic membranes with slippage character Previous accounts present a holistic, the first-principle-based view on the slippage effect to fouling and scaling. However, the discussion focused on solely a model membrane with precisely designed pillar morphology (Fig. 6); in this respect, the universality of this theory is subjected to scrutiny. It is fortunate that the slip concept has been widely recognized by different research groups as a fundamental basis for the fouling and scaling resistance of their tailor-made superhydrophobic or omniphobic membrane in MD. Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 shows the recent tailor-made nanofiber-based superhydrophobic [46,74,111] and omniphobic [45,116,118] membranes with superior fouling and scaling resistance. The preparation of these membranes followed a similar concept: firstly adding nanoparticles to the nanofibers or creating surface roughness by a hydrothermal technique [118,119] or growing metal oxides [116]; then chemically modify the surface via fluorination. Fig. 11 shows slightly more complicated procedure to prepare hierarchical nanostructures membrane with omniphobicity [46,117]. Either incorporation of the silica nanoparticles to the nanofibers [46] or attached to the positively charged surface [117], the final membrane demonstrated fouling resistance to SDS or scaling resistance, which was mainly attributed to the slippage surface. Because the irregular surface pattern, the evaluation of the wetting state was difficult. Measurement of the slip length has not yet been reported. However, from the experimental results of the sliding angles [45,46,74,117],Retrospectively, observation of the suspended wetting and slip has been a coincident. Very recently, we demonstrated that even for a superhydrophobic membrane with suspended wetting, a slight overpressure in feed altered the suspended wetting to a more pinned wetting state, thus forfeited the membrane scaling resistance.

Unfortunately, most of the researches on superhydrophobic membranes have failed to analyze the wetting state and understand the feed overpressure effects on the wetting state; it is therefore understandable that the very important slippage effect on fouling and scaling has been hidden for decades. 4.6 Brief on potential superhydrophobic/omniphobic membranes with slippage character Previous accounts present a holistic, the first-principle-based view on the slippage effect to fouling and scaling. However, the discussion focused on solely a model membrane with precisely designed pillar morphology (Fig. 6); in this respect, the universality of this theory is subjected to scrutiny. It is fortunate that the slip concept has been widely recognized by different research groups as a fundamental basis for the fouling and scaling resistance of their tailor-made superhydrophobic or omniphobic membrane in MD. Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 shows the recent tailor-made nanofiber-based superhydrophobic [46,74,111] and omniphobic [45,116,118] membranes with superior fouling and scaling resistance. The preparation of these membranes followed a similar concept: firstly adding nanoparticles to the nanofibers or creating surface roughness by a hydrothermal technique [118,119] or growing metal oxides [116]; then chemically modify the surface via fluorination. Fig. 11 shows slightly more complicated procedure to prepare hierarchical nanostructures membrane with omniphobicity [46,117]. Either incorporation of the silica nanoparticles to the nanofibers [46] or attached to the positively charged surface [117], the final membrane demonstrated fouling resistance to SDS or scaling resistance, which was mainly attributed to the slippage surface. Because the irregular surface pattern, the evaluation of the wetting state was difficult. Measurement of the slip length has not yet been reported. However, from the experimental results of the sliding angles [45,46,74,117],</p>
        <p>we could give a qualitative judgement that the membrane water interface indeed are slip. Evidence further validates that the slippage theory is not limited to the specific surface. We expected more experimental proof to be discovered in the near future as more researchers are exposed to the slippage theory.we could give a qualitative judgement that the membrane water interface indeed are slip.

        <p>Experimental evidence has demonstrated that a slip condition holds the key for a hydrophobic membrane demonstrating antifouling/antiscaling characters. A slip surface is characterized by suspended wetting and positive slip length (Rationale 2). To achieve slippage, a high surface porosity with a low surface energy is a prerequisite. Under slip conditions, the classical CNT and xDLVO theories are not valid, but at a non-slip condition, represented as a pinned wetting, both CNT and xDLVO theories are applicable. The slip model does not cover the stability issue. In the following, we will outline means to create slip conditions to maintain MD process performance stability.Experimental evidence has demonstrated that a slip condition holds the key for a hydrophobic membrane demonstrating antifouling/antiscaling characters.

        <p>Literature reported stable MD performance for superhydrophobic or omniphobic membranes is often limited to a couple of days. This short working time is far from sufficient to demonstrating stable antifouling/antiscaling performance of these membranes. The over pressure experiments seem to infer that the loss of air trapped in the pores leads to the transition from the suspended into pinned wetting state. If this is true, then maintaining the suspended wetting can lead to membranes with sustained antifouling/scaling properties. Physically implementing a hydrodynamic control at the membrane interface has been practiced, such as introduction of air-bubble or turbulence [154], increase the feed flow velocity with flow variation [155] and ultrasonication.Literature reported stable MD performance for superhydrophobic or omniphobic membranes is often limited to a couple of days.

        <p>Air bubbles can be created by air recharging or injection [154,[156][157][158][159][160] and electrolysis gas production via embedded electrodes [161, 162] [163]. Turbulence can be generated via implementing specially designed spacers [164][165][166][167]. Microbubble aeration reinforces the surface shear to reduce polarization, but also alleviates scale precipitation due to aggregation of counter-ions at the gas-liquid interface of microbubbles [168]. Two 3D printed spacers based on triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) architectures achieved 50 % higher flux and reduced crystal deposition than commercial spacers [164]. Ultrasonic irradiation can create cavitation, acoustic streaming [169], and hydraulic pressure impulses; the hydrodynamic effect can reduce temperature polarization and mitigate the fouling and scaling as well [76,[170][171][172][173]. However, external hydrodynamic turbulence is not fully controlled. For example, the created local over-or under-pressure varies at rather short time scale. The effect of such hydrodynamic turbulence would be lost in a long timescale. This is one of the key factors that cause normal hydrophobic membranes to fail within a shorter time than superhydrophobic or omniphobic membranes.Air bubbles can be created by air recharging or injection [154,[156][157][158][159][160] and electrolysis gas production via embedded electrodes [161, 162] [163].

        <p>Many aspects have still to be systematically analyzed to reach a holistic solution to the fouling and scaling issue in MD. Besides membranes, other engineering approaches are also important. Pretreatment of the feed is necessary, such as flocculation [174], water softening [175], micro-or nanofiltration [176,177] and pH control [22] to remove both suspended and dissolved fouling matters. pH adjustment is important and economic to avoid alkaline scale [33], silica scale [66] and humic acid fouling [68]. Dosing anti-scalants and magnetic treatment to delay the onset of nucleation [13] has also been adopted. However, the chemical consumption associated cost is of major concern; additional fouling due to addition of chemicals also takes place [13,26].Many aspects have still to be systematically analyzed to reach a holistic solution to the fouling and scaling issue in MD.

        <p>For an industrial scale module, the circulation pump induces a certain over-pressure to cause sagging at the water-air interface and eventually a pinned wetting of the membrane. This generates a nonslip condition, followed by fouling. In vacuum membrane distillation (VMD), under-pressure in the permeate side incurs a "over-pressure" at the feed side, thus press the water-air interface into the membrane pore and original slippage effect of a superhydrophobic membrane is lost. This indicates that a fouling and scaling resistant superhydrophobic membrane would eventually fail in a VMD operation. The effects of the membrane chemistry and morphology to attribute surface slip have yet to be integrated with the state-of-the-art process design. We believe that a proper membrane design plus careful controlling operation process parameters, spacers cleaning protocols would significantly improve MD process stability.For an industrial scale module, the circulation pump induces a certain over-pressure to cause sagging at the water-air interface and eventually a pinned wetting of the membrane.

        <p>Seawater was concentrated to around 18-19% salt with scaling salt precipitates floating all around with no flux reduction over 5 days of continuous operation at much higher values than SI. This demonstrated that the "Slip" effect can be achieved without superhydrophobic membrane. The geometrical design of the hollow fiber module and cross flow of hot brine created numerous spontaneous secondary flows preventing accumulation of scaling salt crystals/nuclei on the membrane surface by continuously scrubbing the surface of the hollow fibers [178,179].Seawater was concentrated to around 18-19% salt with scaling salt precipitates floating all around with no flux reduction over 5 days of continuous operation at much higher values than SI.

        <p>A complete solution for treating the highly saline waste streams has yet to come from many aspects, covering membrane synthesis, module design and process optimization. By proposing the slippage effect and the consequent engineering implications, this perspective provides a higher dimension for researchers and engineers to bring about the success of MD in practice. The first priority to sustain the MD performance is to maintain the slippage effect of the membranes. Design superhydrophobic or omniphobic membranes would delay the fouling/scaling of MD membranes and will remain an important direction from the materials development side. Systematic research to control or simulate the slippage effect is very important as well. If process parameters could create equivalent slip waterair interface, commercial hydrophobic membranes could be utilized and cost for MD membranes will be significantly reduced, which will enable the commercialization of MD technologies. Module development to create mechanical flow turbulence adjacent to a membrane surface could prevent or reduce the nucleation of scalants and deposition of organic foulants. Certain pre-treatment to reduce a significant amount of sparingly soluble ions and organics is certainly desirable for maintain stable MD operations. Most importantly, engineering solutions beyond development of disruptive antiscaling/antifouling membranes would allow usage of commercial hydrophobic membranes at lower cost.A complete solution for treating the highly saline waste streams has yet to come from many aspects, covering membrane synthesis, module design and process optimization.

        <p>The development and performance of superhydrophobic membranes for treatment of highly saline water streams is summarized in terms of fouling and scaling resistance. A water-solid-air triple phase interface has been introduced to replace the conventional water-solid interface for a hydrophobic membrane to be fouling/scaling resistant. A surface with high porosity is a pre-requisite as the probability of direct contact between foulants and membrane materials is largely reduced. We further propose suspended wetting and correlated slippage as an important hydrodynamic factor, minimizing contact time for interaction of the foulants and the membrane. By defining slip length and evaluating the wetting states, the underlining mechanisms are elucidated and uncovered to explain the fouling and scaling resistance of superhydrophobic and omniphobic membranes. The present theory encompasses the xDLVO and classical nucleation models as a special case of pinned wetting, thus conforms to the thermodynamic understanding of fouling and scaling. In practice, sustaining a suspended wetting with a slip surface is critical to achieve a stable MD process for treating complicated waste streams, which may help guide the design of suitable membranes, modules and processes for large-scale applications of MD.The development and performance of superhydrophobic membranes for treatment of highly saline water streams is summarized in terms of fouling and scaling resistance.
