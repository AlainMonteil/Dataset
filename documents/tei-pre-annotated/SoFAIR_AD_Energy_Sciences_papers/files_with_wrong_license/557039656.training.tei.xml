        <p>The electrochemical reduction of CO 2 (eCO 2 RR) using renewable energy is an effective approach to pursue carbon neutrality. The eCO 2 RR to CO is indispensable to promoting C-C coupling through bifunctional catalysis and to achieving cascade conversion from CO 2 to C 2+ . This work investigates a series of M/N-C (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) catalysts for which the metal precursor interacted with the nitrogen-doped carbon support (N-C) at room temperature, resulting in the metal being present as (sub)nano-sized metal oxide clusters in ex situ condition, except for Cu/N-C and Zn/N-C. A volcano trend in their activity toward CO as a function of the group of the transition metal is revealed, with Co/N-C exhibiting the highest activity at -0.5 V vs. RHE; while Ni/N-C shows both appreciable activity and selectivity.</p>
        <p>Operando XAS shows that the majority of Cu atoms in Cu/N-C forms Cu 0 clusters during eCO 2 RR; while the Mn/, Fe/, Co/, and Ni/N-C maintain the metal hydroxide structures, with a minor amount of M 0 formed in Fe/, Co/, and Ni/N-C. The superior activity of Fe/, Co/ and Ni/N-C is ascribed to the phase contraction and the HCO 3 -insertion into the layered structure of metal hydroxides. Our work provides a facile synthetic approach toward highly active and selective electrocatalysts to convert CO 2 into CO. Coupling with state-of-the-art NiFe-based anodes in a full cell device, Ni/N-C exhibits &gt;80% Faradaic efficiency toward CO at 100 mA cm -2 .</p>
        <p>The direct electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (eCO 2 RR) to fuels and valuable chemicals, powered by renewable energies, is an attractive pathway to establish a carbon-neutral energy cycle. However, the implementation of CO 2 electrolyzers is still impeded by: 1) low energy efficiency due to the high overpotential needed to activate CO 2 ; [1] 2) low Faradaic efficiency (FE) due to competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous electrolytes; [1] 3) low current densities due to poor CO 2 mass transport when using CO 2 -saturated aqueous electrolytes as cathode feed. [2,3] In the past decades, research in the field of eCO 2 RR has focused on developing efficient and selective electrocatalysts via surface functionalization, [4,5] metal alloying, [6,7] heteroatom doping, [8] facet/morphology regulation, [9,10] and particle size tailoring [11] . Recently, industrial scale current densities (&gt;100 mA•cm -2 ) have been achieved via enhanced mass transport of CO 2 in gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs). [12][13][14][15][16] Depending on the nature of catalytic sites and the operating conditions, C 1 (CO, CH 4 , CH 3 OH, HCOOH, etc.), C 2 (C 2 H 4 , CH 3 CH 2 OH, CH 3 COOH, etc.) and C 3 (n-C 3 H 7 OH, etc.) products have been reported for eCO 2 RR. [1] The state-of-the-art Faradaic efficiency (FE) of eCO 2 RR to C 1 products (CO or formate) is &gt;90% over Zn, [17] Ag, [18] Au, [19] SnO x [20] and catalysts comprising single-metal-atom sites. [21][22][23][24][25] However, only Cu-based catalysts promote the production of C 2+ chemicals but, hitherto, with low FEs (&lt;50%) toward a particular C 2+ product. [6,[8][9][10] Only few studies have, to the best of our knowledge, reported the reduction of CO 2 toward a C 2 product (acetic acid) over Cu-free catalysts and with significant selectivity. [26- 28] To date, the most efficient approach to favour C 2+ products vs. CO, CH 4 and formic acid is the fine tuning of the surface structure of Cu, including the oxidation state, defects, crystal facets and doping with a secondary metal. [6,[8][9][10][29][30][31][32] The doping of Cu with Ag, Au and Zn leans, partially, on the high selectivity for CO 2 -to-CO of such metallic surfaces and the recognized importance of the CO intermediate in the formation of C 2 products on Cu. [33][34][35][36][37] . Doping Cu with Ag, Au and Zn can thus be described as introducing bifunctionality at the atomic scale. However, the extent to which Cu can be doped by CO-selective sites is limited, [35,36] and the doping simultaneously alters the geometric and electronic structures of the Cu surface, modifying its selectivity. [6,[38][39][40][41] In addition, such advanced surface structures prepared and optimized ex situ generally experience significant reconstructions during eCO 2 RR, either due to the low electrochemical potential and/or due to operando produced CO. [42][43][44] Recently, alternative bifunctional catalysis approaches have been investigated in which CO is produced on one type of active sites and subsequently desorbed and transported to other sites that catalyse C-C coupling. [4,5,36,45] Compared to atomic-level bifunctionality, this approach disentangles the effect of the two catalytic sites and allows optimizing them separately. For example, E.H. Sargent's group et al. [36] demonstrated that metallic copper/metal-porphyrin composite cathodes promote the C-C coupling, leading to higher peak Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 41% toward ethanol compared to that of 29% over pure Cu. Similarly, P. Strasser's group reported that the ethylene production rate was 3-fold faster on Cu nanoparticles mixed with Ni-N-C than on Cu nanoparticles alone. [45] These examples show that CO-making sites do not need to be at atomic distance of the Cu surface in order to enhance Cu selectivity towards C 2 products. This opens the door to diverse strategies at the cathode, electrolyzer and system levels in order to tune the product selectivity.</p>
        <p>For example, CO/CO 2 feed was shown to increase the selectivity towards ethylene compared to pure CO 2 feed. [45] The eCO 2 RR towards multi-carbon products might thus be achieved in two stages from a cell engineering viewpoint as well, for example with a first electrolyzer cell with a cathode designed to produce syngas from CO 2 , and the syngas serving as inlet gas for a second electrolyzer cell where a Cu-based cathode transforms it selectively into C 2 products. [46] In addition, complete electrochemical conversion of CO 2 -to-CO in the first stage would be beneficial as it would allow carrying out electrochemical reduction of CO to C 2+ products at high pH (13-14) in the second stage, with more facile kinetics than in near-neutral pH. [2,47] In contrast, sustainably operating eCO 2 RR at high pH is impossible, due to the fast carbonation of high-pH catholyte with CO 2 -gas feed. [2,3] Thus, it is of paramount importance to develop a robust, efficient and selective electrocatalyst for eCO 2 RR to CO to realize the practical implementation of CO 2 electrolyzers. Metalnitrogen-carbon (M-N-C, with M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) materials that exclusively comprise atomically-dispersed MN x sites have shown high selectivity toward CO (especially for M = Fe or Ni). [21][22][23][24][25] Excessive metal content however leads to aggregation of a fraction of metal during pyrolysis into particles, resulting in lower selectivity towards CO. [48][49][50] The synthesis of M-N-C catalysts comprising only MN x sites is therefore not trivial and requires optimisation of the content and nature of the metal, N and C precursors, as well as one or several pyrolysis steps and, often, post-pyrolysis treatment to remove excess metal. [22][23][24]51] This has drawback on the life-cycle assessment if such catalysts were implemented in industrial-scale CO 2 electrolyzers. MN 4 macrocycles such as phthalocyanines and porphyrins adsorbed or attached onto carbon allotropes have shown high selectivity for CO formation, comparable to that of M-N-C materials. [52][53][54] However, the synthesis of such macrocycles is not ideal for large-scale production of low-cost catalyst. Moreover, it has been reported that both MN x sites (in pyrolyzed M-N-C) and MN 4 sites (in macrocycles supported e.g. on carbon) are prone to clustering during eCO 2 RR, as observed via operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). [25,55,56] While the Cu clusters formed at low potential re-dispersed into single-Cu-atom sites when scanning the potential up, this observation raises the question whether the fine structure of M-N-C materials with exclusive single-atom MN x sites is necessary for high CO 2 -to-CO selectivity.</p>
        <p>Herein, we developed and studied a series of M/N-C (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) catalysts featuring highly-dispersed metal-oxide particles supported on nitrogen-doped carbon (N-C) under ex situ condition, except for Cu/N-C and Zn/N-C, featuring mainly atomically dispersed sites. Their catalytic activity and selectivity toward eCO 2 RR to CO was evaluated in a flow cell with GDEs. A volcano trend in their activity toward CO as a function of the group of the transition metal is revealed, with Co/N-C exhibiting the highest intrinsic activity at -0.5 V vs. RHE; while Ni/N-C shows both high activity and selectivity. Operando XAS was further exploited to investigate structural changes under working conditions. The majority of Cu atoms in Cu/N-C forms Cu 0 clusters during eCO 2 RR; while the Mn/, Fe/, Co/, and Ni/N-C maintain the metal hydroxide structures, with a minor amount of M 0 formed in operando with Fe/, Co/, and Ni/NC samples. Then the M/N-C cathodes were coupled with state-of-the-art NiFe-based anodes in PGM-free electrolyzer cells, with Ni/N-C exhibiting &gt;80% FE toward CO at 100 mA cm -2 at a cell voltage of ~4 V.</p>
        <p>The metal coordination and presence of metal-oxide particles supported on N-C, is firstly studied and revealed under ex situ condition for the series of materials developed in this work and labelled as M/N-C (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn). The metal coordination and spectral response is also compared with M-N-C catalysts previously studied at our laboratory, and featuring exclusively atomically dispersed MN x sites. The synthesis of M-N-C catalysts was described in a previous work. [25] Briefly, the well-mixed precursors of metal acetate, 1,10phenanthroline and ZIF-8 (Basolite® Z1200) were pyrolyzed in Ar at 1050 o C in flash mode.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the M/N-C catalysts (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) were synthesized via chemical precipitation wherein the transition metals were deposited on N-C by dissolving M (II) Cl 2 salt in a suspension of N-C in water/ethanol (see Experimental Methods for the detailed protocol).</p>
        <p>The N-C support was prepared via pyrolysis of ZIF-8, as described further below. Then the suspension was centrifuged, washed with water and let to dry in ambient conditions. The dry powder was finally subjected to a mild heat treatment at 200°C for 2 h in flowing Ar, for complete drying. The major difference between the synthesis of M-N-C and M/N-C is that the metal atoms were subjected to a high-temperature pyrolysis for the former synthesis, leading to the formation of atomically dispersed M-N 4 sites, but not for the latter synthesis. The N-C support was synthesized by pyrolysis of ZIF-8, with a first pyrolysis in flash mode in flowing Ar at 1050°C for 1 h, followed by a second flash pyrolysis in flowing NH 3 at 900°C for 10 min. The second pyrolysis was introduced to increase the N-content and surface basicity. As will be shown later, the presence of nitrogen in the carbon substrate is key to the CO 2 RR activity of the present M/N-C materials. It should be noted here that the N-C support contains Zn-N 4 sites (Figure S1). However, we label it as N-C for simplicity and also because the Zn-N 4 sites were previously demonstrated to be inactive towards CO 2 RR. [25] The bulk metal contents in M/N-C materials were derived from the absolute absorption height of XAS spectra, measured in transmission mode and for a fixed catalyst weight per cross section of pellet. They are shown in Table S1, with metal loadings varying between 1.3 and 2.5 wt.%. This agrees with the metal contents obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in the range of 0.5 to 2.2 wt.% (Table S2). All M/N-C materials also contain a significant amount of Zn, derived from ZIF-8, that is comparable to the Zn amount in the N-C substrate (Table S2). The Zn is present as atomically dispersed ZnN 4 moieties, as shown by X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) (Figure S1). The same ZnN 4 site and similar Zn content were also observed after a single pyrolysis in Ar of ZIF-8. [25] The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of M/N-C materials (Figure S2) exhibit only two broad peaks typical for nanometric graphite-like domains present in amorphous N-C, and no diffraction peaks related to metal-based crystalline structures. XRD is however not ideally suited to identify the possible presence of metal clusters in such materials, due to i) the low metal content on N-C (Tables S1-S2), ii) the small size of metal clusters, or iii) the amorphous character of metal clusters due to the mild synthesis conditions. To obtain precise information on the metal coordination and oxidation state in M/N-C, we then resorted to 57 Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy for Fe/N-C, and XAS at the metal K-edge for all M/N-C.</p>
        <p>The Mössbauer spectrum acquired at room temperature shows only one quadrupole doublet (Figure 1a), with isomer shift and quadrupole splitting values of 0.31 and 0.81 mm•s -1 , respectively (Table S3). While this doublet can generally be assigned to Fe 3+ in high-spin (HS) state, [57] Mössbauer measurement at room temperature cannot distinguish between HS Fe 3+ in amorphous or (sub)-nanometric Fe 2 O 3 and HS Fe 3+ in atomically-dispersed sites. [58,59] In the context of this study, Fe sites in Fe/N-C might exist as a result of possible trans-metalation from ZnN 4 moieties (present in N-C) to FeN 4 moieties during the precipitation of Fe onto N-C in aqueous solution, [60,61] or as a result of Fe 2+ adsorption on N-or O-functional groups on the surface of N-C, followed by oxidation during the drying step in air.</p>
        <p>We then performed 57 Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy at 5 K, taking advantage of the different temperature-dependent behaviours of the Mössbauer spectrum of nanometric ferric oxides and atomically-dispersed Fe-sites, the former changing from doublet to sextet signal below a certain critical temperature, [62] while the latter remains a doublet even at 5 K. [59,63] The 5 K Mössbauer spectrum of Fe/N-C exhibits three sextets with slightly different IS-values and hyperfine fields (HF) amounting to 96 % of the resonant area, as well as a minute amount of a quadrupole doublet (4 %) (Figure 1b and Table S3). The IS-and HF values of the three sextets can be assigned to Fe 2 O 3 with different particle sizes, [62,64] while the doublet is assigned to HS Fe 2+ , due to its high isomer shift of 1.07 mm·s -1 . [65] Thus, the 5 K Mössbauer spectrum demonstrates that the well-defined narrow doublet observed at room temperature is overwhelmingly arising from amorphous or (sub)nano-sized Fe 2 O 3 .</p>
        <p>Velocity (mm/s) This is also well supported by ex situ XAS at the Fe K-edge. The XANES spectrum of Fe/N-C highly resembles that of a commercial Fe 2 O 3 powder as far as the edge position and the main spectral features are concerned (Figure S3a). Moreover, the Fourier transform (FT) of the EXAFS spectrum of Fe/N-C shows two prominent peaks at ~1.5 and ~2.5 Å (uncorrected for phase shift), matching the Fe-O and Fe-Fe (labelled Fe-Fe oxy ) interactions in Fe 2 O 3 (Figure 2a). Similar to our synthesis for Fe/N-C, R. Arrigo et al. deposited iron on a N-functionalized carbon paper from nitrate salt and identified with XAS the iron species to be oxides/oxyhydroxides. [26] We also note that the XANES and EXAFS spectra of Fe/N-C are different from those of a Fe-N-C material from our laboratory, prepared by the direct pyrolysis of Fe(II) salt, ZIF-8 and phenanthroline, comprising Fe exclusively as atomically-dispersed FeN x sites that form at high temperature. The XANES spectra of Fe/N-C and Fe-N-C differ in shape with a lower white line intensity, scaling with Fe-O interactions, for the latter (Figure S3a). The FT-EXAFS spectra of Fe/N-C and Fe-N-C also differ, the latter only shows one major peak at ~1.5 Å due to Fe-N (and Fe-O) interactions from (O 2 )-FeN x moieties, [66,67] but no peak at 2.5 Å (Figure 2a).</p>
        <p>To investigate the metal coordination in the other M/N-C catalysts, we performed ex situ XAS at their respective metal K-edges and compare spectral features to those of i) reference metal oxide materials and ii) a series of M-N-C materials prepared at high temperature and comprising only atomically-dispersed MN x sites. [25] The intensity of the white line of Co/N-C</p>
        <p>XANES is consistent with that of the oxides, and the position of the edge is close to that of Similarly as for Fe/N-C, the XANES and FT-EXAFS spectra of Co/N-C and Ni/N-C differ from the corresponding spectra of Co-N-C and Ni-N-C materials from our laboratory, that comprise only single-metal-atom MN 4 moieties. [25] In Regarding Cu/N-C, its XANES spectrum is dissimilar with those of CuO and Cu 2 O but resembles more that of Cu-N-C (Figure S3d). Similarly, the FT-EXAFS spectrum of Cu/N-C closely resembles that of Cu-N-C, with a single peak at ~1.4 Å and no secondary peak at the position expected for Cu-Cu oxy backscattering (Figure 2d). This suggests that Cu might be atomically dispersed as CuO x or CuN x sites. The latter label does however not necessarily imply the exact same coordination as Cu in Cu-N-C (CuN 4 , formed at high temperature), and we stress that the XANES spectra of Cu/N-C and Cu-N-C are slightly different (Figure S3d).</p>
        <p>Transmetalation between ZnN x and Cu 2+ in solution, forming CuN x sites, may be more facile than with Fe 2+ , Co 2+ or Ni 2+ cations in solution due to steric or electronic effects, as reported for metalation/transmetalation of metal-free porphyrins. [68] R (A) The nitrogen speciation of the M/N-C catalysts was then investigated with XPS. The N1s narrow-scan spectra were deconvoluted into five nitrogen species, namely pyridinic nitrogen, amine or N in MN x , pyrrolic N (labelled N-H), graphitic N (including N gr /N + and bulk N-H, i.e. N-H in the carbon plane) and N-O x (Figure S5). The nitrogen chemistry of M/N-C catalysts resembles that of the N-C substrate, with similar relative concentrations of different N species, including in particular 15.8-18.9 relative % of N as "MN x " (Table S2).</p>
        <p>As for the EXAFS and XANES data, we find it useful to compare the XPS N1s narrow-scan spectra of M/N-C materials to those for M-N-C. Since the N1s spectra for M-N-C are also similar for different 3d metals, [25] we show and discuss the N1s spectrum of Fe-N-C only as a representative example. The N1s spectrum of Fe-N-C was fitted with the same N-species (Figure S5f) but contains different relative concentrations of N-species compared to M/N-C (Table S2). Specifically, the ratios of N-Pyridinic to MN x are 1.9-2.3 for M/N-C materials and the N-C substrate as well, but only ~1.6 for Fe-N-C. The latter might indicate that pyridinic N are preferentially utilized for forming FeN x sites during pyrolysis in the presence of Fe. In contrast, similar N-Pyridinic/M-N x ratios for all M/N-C materials and for the N-C substrate suggests that pyridinic nitrogen did not bind metal cations during the metal salt precipitation, and that the MN x signal in M/N-C can mainly be assigned to ZnN x sites that were already present in the N-C substrate. Transmetalation of a fraction of ZnN x sites into CuN x sites would also lead to a ratio of N-Pyridinic/M-N x similar to that in N-C, and the XPS results are thus not contradicting the XANES and EXAFS conclusions on Cu/N-C.</p>
        <p>We also synthesized the Mn/ and Zn/N-C catalysts and their structures were studied with ex situ XAS and XRD (Figure S6). The peaks at ~1.4, ~2.7 and ~4.8 Å in the FT-EXAFS spectrum of Mn/N-C coincides with the Mn-O and Mn-Mn oxy interactions in manganese oxides, while the additional peak at ~2.1 and 3.3 Å are also indicative of the presence of MnOOH (Figure S6a). The remaining presence of a metal hydroxide in Mn/N-C and absence in the other M/N-C samples is due to the significantly higher decomposition temperature of -MnOOH (&gt; 300 o C) compared to the metal (oxy)hydroxides for Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn. [69] The XRD pattern of Mn/N-C shows two peaks at ~33 o and 36 o attributed to Mn 2 O 3 and Mn 3 O 4 , respectively, [70] in addition to the two broad peaks arising from amorphous carbon (Figure S6c). These results show that Mn/N-C contains manganese oxides/oxyhydroxides with relatively larger particles sizes compared to other M/N-C, on the basis of their detection by XRD. Regarding Zn/N-C, it contains both ZnN 4 sites (already present in N-C) and zinc species that were formed during the subsequent adsorption/precipitation process. As a result, the XANES and FT-EXAFS of Zn/N-C closely resemble that of N-C, except for a minor peak at ~2.9 Å attributed to Zn-Zn oxy interaction as in ZnO. In contrast to Mn/N-C, the ZnO clusters are not detected by XRD, suggesting amorphous or sub-nanometric ZnO clusters.</p>
        <p>In summary, ex situ XAS, 57 Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy, XRD and STEM results demonstrate the presence of highly dispersed transition metal oxides (MO x ) supported on N-C (comprising ZnN x sites) in M/N-C materials, except for Cu/N-C comprising atomically dispersed CuO x or CuN x sites, with possible transmetalation from ZnN x to CuN x sites.</p>
        <p>To measure the activity and selectivity, we resorted to an electrochemical flow cell with a GDE cathode configuration, with CO 2 gas feed at the back and, in this section, a continuous flow of 1 M KHCO 3 as catholyte at the front (hydrophobic side) of the GDE. The anode and anolyte utilized in this section were IrO x coated Ti plate and 1 M KHCO 3 , respectively. The Ag/AgCl reference electrode was placed in the catholyte chamber. The gaseous products of eCO 2 RR were identified and quantified under galvanostatic control (see details in Experimental Methods). Figure 5e shows the CO partial current density (J CO ) vs. cathode potential for all M/N-C materials and for N-C as well. All M/N-C catalysts show an earlier onset for eCO 2 RR to CO than the N-C substrate, demonstrating the catalytic role of the metal species added to the N-C substrate (itself containing ZnN x sites). Co/N-C shows the highest onset potential, &gt; -0.3 V vs.</p>
        <p>RHE, i.e. an absolute overpotential &lt; 200 mV for eCO 2 RR to CO (E o = -0.104 V vs. RHE [1] ).</p>
        <p>This onset potential is comparable to those reported for precious metal-based catalysts toward eCO 2 RR to CO at similar pH. [19,71,72] The Fe/ and Ni/N-C materials have the second highest onset potential, but while the polarization curves are almost overlapped at low current density (&lt; 2.5 mA·cm -2 ), they split at high current density with the Ni/N-C polarization curve showing an exponential growth with decreasing cathode potential while the one for Fe/N-C shows a nearly linear increase down to ca -0.55 V vs. RHE (Figure 5e). This is due to the sharp decrease in FE(CO) for Fe/N-C at a total current density &gt; 5 mA·cm -2 (Figure 5a), while the FE(CO) of Ni/N-C continuously increases with increasing total current density (Figure 5c). at the back of the gas diffusion electrode whose microporous side was coated with 1 mg•cm -2 of catalyst, while the anode was IrO x . The potential and overpotential reported in e and f are iR-corrected.</p>
        <p>To identify trends, we then plotted the J CO at -0.45 V vs. RHE and the cathode overpotential (η) at -2.5 mA·cm -2 (CO partial current density) vs. the atomic number of transition metal (Figure 5f). Interestingly, with increasing atomic number from Mn to Co, J CO monotonically increases, whereas with further increasing atomic number of the metal, the J CO decreases. A similar trend is also apparent for the overpotential at -2.5 mA·cm -2 . Similar volcano trends are obtained if one uses the redox potential M 2+ /M as x-axis. Herein, we reveal a volcano trend in the electrocatalytic activity for the CO 2 to CO reduction over a series of catalysts characterised, ex situ, with M/N-C materials comprising highly dispersed MO x sites in ex situ conditions, with Co/N-C located at the volcano peak. This volcano trend is similar to that observed over M-N-C catalysts with M-N 4 sites. [25] While the high activity and selectivity for eCO 2 RR to CO of the three most active catalysts, Fe-, Co-and Ni/N-C, can be related to the (sub)-nano MO x structures identified ex situ, whether the nitrogen plays a role during the synthesis or during eCO 2 RR of those M/N-C catalysts is still elusive. Therefore, we prepared nitrogen-free FeO x /C material by precipitating FeO x on Vulcan XC72 carbon black powder (labelled as FeO x /Vulcan), following the same protocol as before. This reference material was characterised ex situ by XAS and its eCO 2 RR activity was measured in the flow cell. The FeO x /Vulcan shows FT-EXAFS and XANES spectra similar to those of Fe/N-C catalysts (Figure S7a-b). This demonstrates the presence of the metal as (sub)nano-oxide, as intended. The Fe content measured from the edge jump of its XAS spectrum (Table S1) confirm that FeO x /Vulcan has a metal content comparable to Fe/N-C.</p>
        <p>Negligible eCO 2 RR to CO activity is observed for FeO x /Vulcan when tested in flow cell under the same conditions as M/N-C, with H 2 as the major product (Figure S7c). It has been reported</p>
        <p>that Fe 3+ species from iron oxyhydroxides supported on carbon were operando reduced into metallic particles, [26] while the same Fe 3+ species supported on N-C were only reduced to 2+ oxidation state. Fe 0 is probably responsible for the high selectivity toward H 2 production of FeO x /Vulcan, since Fe 0 is not known to catalyse CO 2 reduction selectively, even as nanoparticles (it should be noted here that this might not be the case for other metals). These results show that supporting the metal oxide particles on N-C is key to their CO 2 RR activity and selectivity, due to similar Fe K-edge XAS spectra and Fe content identified ex situ for Fe/N-C and FeO x /Vulcan, but different activity and selectivity (Figure 5 and S7).</p>
        <p>Therefore, a synergy between N-defects or ZnN x and the MO x (sub)nano clusters seems to be at play. R. Arrigo et al. [26] found from theoretical simulations that pyridinic N defects in N-C lowers the interface energy between iron oxyhydroxide and carbon support, indicating the possible direct interaction between the N-defects and the MO x species. A synergy between N defects and FeO x sites was proposed to promote C-C coupling for acetic acid production. [26] Moreover, P. Atanassov et al confirmed with near ambient pressure XPS that pyridinic and hydrogenated (pyrrolic) nitrogen moieties, rather than Fe-N 4 moieties, act as preferential adsorption sites for CO 2 over pyrolyzed Fe-N-C catalysts [73] . Thus, it is likely that the MO x species and the neighbouring N-defects co-catalyse the eCO 2 RR. Moreover, further work will be needed to elucidate whether Zn plays a role (direct or indirect) in stabilizing such hydroxides particles or not.</p>
        <p>To gain more insights in the fate of the metal-oxide nanoparticles supported on N-C, we resorted to in operando XAS. It is widely acknowledged that metal-based electrocatalysts often experience partial reduction and/or structural reconstruction during eCO 2 RR. [17,26,42,74,75] This can be due to the low electrochemical potential, operando produced H 2 gas and/or operando produced CO. The latter is known to facilitate reconstruction of metal surfaces, and agglomeration of NPs. [43] For M-N-C materials prepared by pyrolysis and comprising only MN 4 moieties ex situ, we recently reported a decreased average oxidation state of Fe and Ni within MN 4 moieties and reduction of a large fraction of Cu 2+ N x sites to Cu(0), via the reversible formation of Cu (sub)nanoparticles, with decreasing electrochemical potential under eCO 2 RR working conditions. [25,55] To identify the local structures of transition metals sites under operating conditions, we therefore conducted operando XAS on the series of M/N-C catalysts.</p>
        <p>We first studied the N-C substrate (comprising ZnN x moieties, Figure S1) at the Zn K-edge.</p>
        <p>The Zn K-edge XANES spectra show only a slight decrease in white line intensity with decreasing potential (Figure S8a In contrast, the operando XAS spectra of Fe/, Co/, Ni/ and Cu/N-C are different from those measured ex situ (Figure 6 and S9-10), in line with their much higher M 2+ /M redox potential.</p>
        <p>To start with the simplest case, the Cu K-edge XANES spectrum of Cu/N-C shifts toward lower energies with decreasing potential, corresponding to a decreased average oxidation state (Figure 6a). This is accompanied by the appearance of a signal that can be assigned to the Cu-Cu coordination, by comparison with the FT-EXAFS of a Cu foil (Figure 6b). This demonstrates the reduction from Cu 2+ to nearly Cu 0 with an extensive formation of metallic copper clusters during eCO 2 RR, even at 0 V vs. RHE, well above the onset of eCO 2 RR on Cu/N-C (~ -0.4 V vs. RHE). The formation of Cu nanoparticles is reversible, as shown by the spectrum of OCP-back overlapping with that of OCP (Figure S9a-b). A minor Cu-N/O peak around 1.5 Å is visible at low potentials, indicating that a small fraction of copper atoms binds with N or O surface groups from N-C (Figure 6b). The anchoring of some Cu atoms to both the N-C support and the operando formed Cu 0 nanoparticles could explain the restricted particle growth and the observed reversibility with Cu re-dispersion at high potential. The operando formation of Cu 0 nanoparticles has been widely observed on other Cu-based catalysts comprising isolated Cu atoms ex situ; [56,76,77] and these Cu 0 nanoparticles very likely act as the catalytically active species. Recently, T. Möller et al revealed that Cu nanoparticles supported on carbon favour the formation of C 1 product instead of the C 2+ products generally observed on unsupported Cu [78] . The selectivity towards C 1 product with Cu nanoparticles is due to the large mean interparticle distance for particles supported in low wt% on a high surface area support material, in line with our finding that CO is the major product in this potential range over the operando formed Cu 0 supported on N-C.</p>
        <p>For Ni/N-C, the XANES and FT-EXAFS spectra remain unchanged when the potential was reduced from OCP to 0 V vs. RHE, and these spectra are close to those measured ex situ, assigned to NiO clusters. From 0 to -0.5 V vs. RHE, the XANES spectra then show a gradual decrease in white line intensity and increase in the pre-edge peak intensity at ~8334 eV (Figure 6c and S10a). The intensity of the pre-edge peak at 8334 eV stays the same at all potentials ≤ -0.5 V vs. RHE, and is indicative of the formation of highly distorted octahedral or tetrahedral Ni-O x coordination in nickel hydroxides (Figure 6c andS10a). [79,80] In contrast, in FT-EXAFS a new intense peak progressively appears at ~2.5 Å from -0.4 V to -1.0 V vs. RHE (Figure S9d), and that can be assigned to Ni-Ni oxy interaction in Ni hydroxide. In addition, the appearance of a shoulder at ~2 Å at-1.0 V vs. RHE (Figure 6c to those of Ni(OH) 2 reference (e.g. at -0.5 and -1.0 V vs. RHE, Figure 6d and Figure 7). We note that this phase contraction has been widely observed for nickel-based catalysts during oxygen evolution reaction (OER), [81,82] attributed to the oxidized nature of Ni at high potentials.</p>
        <p>We for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, report similar phase contraction of nickel hydroxides, but at reducing potentials. The lattice contraction may be due to cation vacancies introduced by partially reduced nickel, and/or due to the intercalation of water and bicarbonate ions into the layered structures of nickel hydroxides. [83][84][85] Upon reverting the potential from -1 V vs. RHE to OCP (OCP-back curves), the XANES and FT-EXAFS spectra were largely restored to the initial OCP spectrum (Figure S9c-d), suggesting the reversibility of this process.</p>
        <p>The absorption edge in the XANES spectrum of Co/N-C remains largely unchanged with potential from OCP to 0 and -0.3 V vs. RHE, while the white line intensity slightly increases (Figure 6e and Figure S9e). The latter can be explained by a transition from cobalt oxide to cobalt hydroxide phase, as can be seen by comparison to the white line intensities for the reference spectra for the latter (compare Figure S3b and6e). The XANES spectra at -0. C from intercalated water and HCO 3 -cations between CoO 6 layers. [86] The intercalated water and cations also induce the phase contraction of Co(OH) 2 , as evidenced by the shorter Co-O and Co-Co oxy peak in Co/N-C than in reference Co(OH) 2 (Figure 6f). The critical role of HCO 3 -cations, instead of gas-phase CO 2 , during eCO 2 RR has been observed over Au and Cu. [87,88] Interestingly, the intensity of the peak arising from Co-Co oxy in the FT-EXAFS spectra first increases at -0.5 V vs. RHE induced by the clustering of Co sites; and then decreases at -1.0 V vs. RHE, probably due to the potential-induced reversible amorphization of cobalt oxide reported previously. [89] The XANES spectrum reverts to the spectrum of 0 V vs. RHE at the end of the series of applied potentials, while the Co-O peak in the FT-EXAFS spectrum remains split, different from the initial OCV FT-EXAFS (Figure S9e-f). This suggests that the intercalated structure was maintained for at least some time after removing the potential bias.</p>
        <p>Regarding Fe/N-C (Figure 6g), there is a negative shift in the position of the absorption edge of Fe K-edge XANES spectra of ~2 eV from OCP to 0 V vs. RHE, indicative of a Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ reduction; and then the XANES spectra remain the same till -0.4 V vs. RHE (Figure S9g).</p>
        <p>When the potential is further lowered to -1.0 V vs. RHE, the white line intensity gradually decreases, accompanied with an increased pre-edge peak (~7115 eV) intensity (Figure S10c).</p>
        <p>This enhanced pre-edge peak is indicative of the partial reduction of Fe 2+ to Fe 0 species. As for Co/N-C, the Fe-N/O peak in the corresponding FT-EXAFS spectra also splits into two peaks at 1.1 and 1.8 Å (Figure 6h). This effect was observed previously by R. Arrigo et al. as well. [26] The FT-EXAFS Fe-Fe oxy peak first decreases in intensity till -0.4 V vs. RHE due to a decreased particle size of iron hydroxide (Figure S9h); and then shifts toward lower R value below -0.5</p>
        <p>V vs. RHE, due to phase contraction (Figure 6h andS9h). The changes in oxidation states observed in the XANES spectra of Fe/N-C are largely reversible when the potential is reverted back to OCP (Figure S9g), while the split Fe-O peak due to the phase contraction remain to some extend (Figure S9h). XAS is that the vast majority of Ni, Co and Fe nano-oxides were not reduced to metallic particles, even at -1 V vs. RHE, which is 550 to 750 mV lower than the values expected according to the Pourbaix diagrams. In contrast, most metal atoms in Ni-, Fe-and Co/NC catalysts stay as oxides, but with a phase contraction (Figure 7). The M-O peaks in the FT-EXAFS of Fe/ and Co/N-C split into two peaks due to tetrahedral M 2+ coordination in the intercalated layer, indicating that the HCO 3 -is inserted into the layered structure of metal hydroxides (Figure 7). Recently, two independent groups demonstrated the critical role of HCO 3 -ions, through equilibrium exchange with dissolved CO 2 , rather than the supplied CO 2 , as the primary source for eCO 2 RR. [87,88] Thus, the inserted HCO 3 -cations and/or the phase contraction of metal oxides at working potentials may be responsible for the superior activity of Fe-, Co-and Ni/N-C catalysts.</p>
        <p>The intrinsic activity and selectivity of Ni/N-C toward CO 2 RR to CO are comparable to those of the state-of-the-art Au, Ag, and M-N-C catalysts (Table S4)</p>
        <p>with a large overpotential likely arising also at the anode side. To decrease the overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and remove precious metals from the cell, we implemented a high surface area Ni-Fe oxyhydroxide anode prepared on a Ni foam (NF) via a phosphidation process, labelled as NF/Ni 2 P/Ni-FeO x (see synthesis in Experimental Methods) [90] .</p>
        <p>The porous backbone of NF is observed in the micro-computed tomography (CT) (Figure S12a) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure S13a) images, and the NiFe-based OER catalyst was decorated homogeneously on the Ni foam (Figure S12a). The XRD pattern exhibits two strong peaks assigned to NF, two minor peaks arising from Ni 2 P, and no peak of the Ni-Fe phase (Figure S13b); while the presence of Fe, P and O is clearly evidenced in energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) mapping (Figure S13c andS14a). This indicates the amorphous nature of the Ni-Fe oxyhydroxide in the catalyst, further supported by high resolution (HR)-TEM images, showing a crystalline phase of hexagonal Ni 2 P in the core and another amorphous phase on the edges (Figure S14b-c). The OER activity of NF/Ni 2 P/Ni-FeO x was first evaluated with rotating disk electrode (RDE) in KOH (0.1 and 1 M) and KHCO 3 (1 M) in comparison with IrO 2 supported on Ni foam. Figure S15a-c demonstrates that the OER activity of NF/Ni 2 P/Ni-FeO x is superior to that of IrO 2 in all electrolytes, and that the overpotential for the former at 10 mA·cm -2 reduces with increasing pH, reaching ~240 mV in 1 M KOH (Figure S15b). Moreover, the overpotential at 10 mA·cm -2 was further reduced by ~100 mV after an accelerated stability test (AST) (Figure S15d). No obvious changes in the morphology and structure of NF/Ni 2 P/Ni-FeO x were observed by X-CT, SEM, XRD, and HRTEM (Figure S12-13 and S16). Its impressive activity and stability make it appealing to implement in electrolyzers, and a significant decrease in total cell voltage up to ~1 V was observed after replacing IrO 2 anode with NF/Ni 2 P/Ni-FeO x in a CO 2 electrolyzer with Ni-N-C as cathode and 1 M KHCO 3 as electrolyte (Figure S11).</p>
        <p>We investigated the activity and selectivity of Fe/, Co/ and Ni/N-C cathodes with NF/Ni 2 P/Ni-FeO x anode (Figure 8). Since the anode catalyst is more active at higher pH, we used 1 M KOH instead of KHCO 3 as anolyte and catholyte in the following study. Co-and Ni/N-C exhibit similar cell voltages for a given current density, lower than that of Fe/N-C. However, Ni/N-C exhibits a higher FE than Co/N-C, reaching a FE(CO) &gt;90% at 50 mA·cm -2 . A FE(CO) &gt;80% is even maintained over Ni/N-C at 100 mA·cm -2 total current density, with a total cell voltage of ~4 V. It should be noted here that a large portion of the cell voltage comes from the iR-drop due to the thick layers of electrolyte in the commercial cell. The total cell resistance is &gt; 25 Ω·cm 2 as measured by high frequency resistance, while that estimated for the liquid chambers is ~10 Ω·cm 2 (from circa 2 cm thickness of anolyte + catholyte, electrolyte conductivity of ~200 mS·cm -1 for 1 M KOH). Thus, the total cell voltage could be further reduced through cell design, e.g. reducing the thickness of each electrolyte chamber possibly down to zero-gap configuration, or increasing the temperature.</p>
        <p>When the total current density was increased from 100 to 150 mA·cm -2 , a sharp decrease in FE was observed. Similar behaviour has been observed over Ni-N-C as well. This is probably due to CO 2 depletion at the catalytic sites, leading to competitive HER. This can be improved by increasing the CO 2 backpressure. P. Strasser et al. [16] reported a stable current density as high as 200 mA·cm -2 over Ni-N-C catalysts with the same flow cell, by closing the CO 2 gas out to force the CO 2 passing through the GDE, resulting in pressurized CO 2 gas flow. Moreover, we also noticed some particles in the anolyte, indicating the mechanical instability of the anode during strong O 2 evolution. This suggests that improved mechanical robustness of the anode during strong gas evolution is also important for cell stability. with a total cell voltage of ~4 V.</p>
