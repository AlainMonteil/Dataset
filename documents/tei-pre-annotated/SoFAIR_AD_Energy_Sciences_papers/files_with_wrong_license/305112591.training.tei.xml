        <p>Photoenzymatic coupled catalysis, integrating semiconductor photocatalysis and enzymatic catalysis, exhibits great potential for light-driven synthesis. To make photocatalyst and enzyme at play concertedly, nicotinamide-based cofactors have been widely used as electron carrier. However, these cofactors are easily oxidized into enzymatically inactive form by photo-generated holes. Herein, oxidation mechanism of NADH, one typical nicotinamide-based cofactor, by photo-generated holes was reported. With CdS, g-C3N4 and BiVO4 as hole generators, NADH is oxidized into NAD + or fragmented into ADP-ribose derivatives through multi-step electron transfer. Importantly, fragmentation reaction is inhibited with dopamine and neutral red to coordinate electron transfer between NADH and photo-generated holes.Photoenzymatic coupled catalysis, integrating semiconductor photocatalysis and enzymatic catalysis, exhibits great potential for light-driven synthesis.

        <p>Heterogeneous chemical catalysis, homogeneous chemical catalysis and enzymatic catalysis are three major catalytic processes used for manufacturing fuels, chemicals, and materials etc. Complex catalytic systems integrating the merits of the above catalytic processes play a vital role in exploring new reaction routes and achieving superior performances. [1][2][3][4][5] Typically, photoenzymatic coupled catalytic systems (PECCSs), which integrate the light harvesting capability of semiconductor photocatalyst and high activity/selectivity of enzyme, have already been utilized for CO2 reduction, H2/O2 evolution and biomass conversion etc. [6][7][8][9][10][11] Photoenzymatic reactions generally consist of three steps: 1) light absorption and charge separation by photocatalyst, 2) electron transfer between photocatalyst and enzyme, and 3) substrate conversion by enzyme. As the connecter between photocatalyst and enzyme, the electron transfer step determines the overall efficiency of photoenzymatic reaction. [12][13] To harness the natural binding affinity and electron transfer mechanism of enzyme, nicotinamide-based cofactors, particularly NADH/NAD + , have been widely used as the "electron shuttle" to coordinate the electron transfer between photocatalyst and enzyme. 6,[14][15][16] At present, the interaction between photo-generated electrons of photocatalyst and NAD + has been well elucidated, permitting the selective transduction of electronic energy into chemical energy of NADH for enzymatic conversion. 17 However, the interaction between photo-generated holes, the antiparticle of electrons, and NADH, which involves both interfacial electron transfer and solution radical chemistry, remains much less resolved. [18][19][20][21] During the multiple interfacial electron transfer, NADH will not only be oxidized into the enzymatically active NAD + , but also some unknown products from the active intermediate radicals. This would reduce the amount of effective electron shuttle (NADH/NAD + ) between photocatalyst and enzyme, imparting low turnover numbers (TNs) of PECCSs. 12 Expounding the interaction between NADH and photo-generated holes, and manipulating NADH oxidation pathway could shed light on designing highly efficient PECCSs.Heterogeneous chemical catalysis, homogeneous chemical catalysis and enzymatic catalysis are three major catalytic processes used for manufacturing fuels, chemicals, and materials etc. Complex catalytic systems integrating the merits of the above catalytic processes play a vital role in exploring new reaction routes and achieving superior performances.

        <p>To evaluate the interaction between photo-generated holes and NADH, CdS particles (diameter: 232.5±12.8 nm) was used as a model photocatalyst (Figure S1). The experiments were conducted in anaerobic phosphate buffer to exclude the influence of oxygen derived radicals on NADH. In the absence of CdS, 96.1±0.1% NADH was retained after 60 min illumination (≥ 420 nm). When CdS was added, NADH content got dramatically decreased to 30.5±5.7% (Figure 1a) and simultaneously 0.58±0.07 μmol H2 was produced (Figure S2). The mole ratio between H2 and oxidized NADH was 0.84:1.00, suggesting that NADH oxidation was accompanied by H2 evolution (Figure 1b). Moreover, the normalized apparent quantum yield of NADH oxidation coincided with the light absorption of CdS (Figure S3), confirming the photocatalytic NADH oxidation. Since the valence band (VB) potential of CdS was 0.86 V vs saturated calomel electrode (SCE) which could not oxidize water to •OH in neutral phosphate buffer, NADH should be directly oxidized by photo-generated holes of CdS. [22][23] CdS kept stable during the reaction, where only 1.04 ug mL -1 Cd was detected in the reaction solution by ICP-MS. To elucidate the reaction mechanism, NADH oxidation product was analyzed by formate dehydrogenase (FDH), which could fully reduce NAD + to NADH by consuming formate (Figure 1b). 24 As shown in Figure 1a, after the addition of FDH, NADH content can only reach 84.8±3.9%. The decrease of initially added NADH suggested that unknown product other than NAD + was formed during photocatalytic NADH oxidation. Moreover, the content of unknown product got increased with the consumption of NADH, evidencing its formation during NADH oxidation (Figure 1c). Interestingly, the formation of unknown product was not specific for CdS, which was also observed for two other widely used semiconductor photocatalysts, g-C3N4 and BiVO4 (Figure S4 andS5). When incubating NAD + with CdS, equal amount of NADH was generated by FDH at different illumination time (Figure S6). This demonstrated that NAD + was not degraded by CdS, and the unknown product was generated during NADH oxidation.To evaluate the interaction between photo-generated holes and NADH, CdS particles (diameter: 232.5±12.8 nm) was used as a model photocatalyst (Figure S1).

        <p>The formation of unknown product suggested that NADH oxidation by photo-generated holes did not follow the one-step hydride transfer where only NAD + would be generated, but the three-step electron-proton-electron transfer. 25 For three-step oxidation, NAD radicals (NAD•) would be formed, which may undergo dimerization or fragmentation to generate the unknown products. The dimers of NAD• ((NAD)2) exhibited absorption band at 340 nm with a extinction coefficient similar to NADH (6550 vs 6220). 26 If (NAD)2 was the unknown product, the absorption at 340 nm should belong to both the residual NADH and newly formed (NAD)2. To determine if (NAD)2 was the unknown product, the oxidation solution was analyzed by yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (YADH), which could irreversibly oxidize NADH into NAD + during the conversion of formaldehyde into methanol, while not (NAD)2. 27 As shown in Figure 1d, after adding YADH into the mixture of formaldehyde and NADH oxidation solution, the absorption band at 340 nm decreased to a similar level. This indicated that (NAD)2 did not contribute to the unknown product. As was reported, (NAD)2 was not stable under visible light illumination, which would undergo disproportionation to NADH and NAD + , or oxidation to NAD + by photo-generated holes. [28][29] Thus, (NAD)2 did not accumulate during NADH oxidation. Besides dimerization, NAD• would also undergo fragmentation. 30 To verify the reaction mechanism, NADH oxidation products were analyzed by 1The formation of unknown product suggested that NADH oxidation by photo-generated holes did not follow the one-step hydride transfer where only NAD + would be generated, but the three-step electron-proton-electron transfer. 25 For three-step oxidation, NAD radicals (NAD•) would be formed, which may undergo dimerization or fragmentation to generate the unknown products.

        <p>As shown in Figure 2a, besides the typical peaks of NAD + (Figure S7), some new peaks, marked by red and blue star, were observed (Figure S8), which was consistent with the characteristic 1 H NMR peaks of ADP-ribose and nicotinamide. [31][32] This suggested that the unknown product might be ADP-ribose and nicotinamide arisen from the fragmentation of NAD•. From the ESI-MS spectra, peaks at m/z 540.1, 558.1 and 580.1 corresponding to ADP-ribose and its derivatives were detected (Figure 2b andc). This further evidenced the fragmentation of NADH into ADP-ribose and its derivatives during photocatalytic NADH oxidation. The observation of NADH peak in Figure 2c was probably arisen from the reduction of NAD + during ESI-MS measurement. 33 Besides CdS, the unknown products generated by g-C3N4 and BiVO4 were also determined as ADP-ribose and its derivatives (Figure S9 andS10). This manifested that the property of semiconductor photocatalyst was not the major factor that determined the NADH oxidation pathway. As reported previously, NADH can be excited into strong single-electron reductant by visible light through two-photon absorption (Figure S11). 21 This will induce the single electron oxidation of NADH into NAD•, which was further fragmented into ADP-ribose and its derivatives (unknown product).As shown in Figure 2a, besides the typical peaks of NAD + (Figure S7), some new peaks, marked by red and blue star, were observed (Figure S8), which was consistent with the characteristic 1 H NMR peaks of ADP-ribose and nicotinamide.

        <p>Based on the above discussion, we proposed the NADH oxidation mechanism by photo-generated holes (Figure 3). Under visible light illumination, both NADH and CdS were excited. The excited state of NADH (NADH*) was a strong single-electron reductant with oxidation potential of -2.60 V vs SCE, which went through single electron oxidation by photo-generated holes. 21 The generated radical cations NADH• + then got deprotonated into NAD• in phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). 34,35 NAD• with an oxidation potential of -1.08 V vs SCE was oxidized to enzymatically active NAD + by the photo-generated holes or fragmented into ADP-ribose radical and nicotinamide. 30,36 ADP-ribose radical was then converted to ADP-ribose and its derivatives by photo-generated holes. The fragmentation of NAD• contributed to the formation of unknown product. This special oxidation pathway should rely on the simultaneous photoexcitation of NADH and CdS. To selectively excite NADH and CdS, two beams of 340 nm and ≥ 420 nm were used for NADH oxidation. The two beams experiment further confirmed the role of dual excitation in NADH oxidation (Figure S12). More detailed discussion could be found in the Supporting Information. To better understand photocatalytic NADH oxidation, the reaction kinetics were examined. As shown in Figure 4a, the turnover frequency (TOF) of NADH increased linearly with NADH concentration, suggesting the first-order kinetics of photocatalytic NADH oxidation. This should be arisen from the full excitation of NADH under 100 mW cm -2 visible light (Figure S11). Moreover, TOF for the generation of NAD + and ADP-ribose derivatives also exhibited linear dependence on NADH concentration. The observed rate constant (kobs) of NADH oxidation was calculated to be 4.9×10 -4 s -1 at pH 7.0 and 303 K. This was much lower than the previously reported deprotonation rate constant of NADH• + (3.5×10 6 s -1 ), suggesting that deprotonation was not the rate-limiting step. 34,35 Considering the high reactivity of NAD•, we speculated that oxidation of NADH to NADH• + was the rate-limiting step. 36 To verify this hypothesis, the photocatalytic NADH oxidation was performed in phosphate buffer with different pH values (6.0-9.0). As shown in Figure 4b, the NADH oxidation rate got gradually decreased with the increase of pH. Since alkaline condition was beneficial for NADH• + deprotonation, the decreased oxidation rate under high pH values further confirmed that deprotonation step was not the rate-limiting step. In general, NADH oxidation by photo-generated holes mainly included the following three steps: 1) adsorption of NADH onto CdS, 2) electron injection from NADH to photo-generated holes of CdS, 3) and desorption of oxidation product from CdS. The change of pH should primarily alter NADH adsorption. Due to the low isoelectric point of CdS (3.03), the negative potential of CdS kept stable at around -17 mV between pH 6.0-9.0. 37 However, for NADH, the phosphate group got a pKa value of 6.82. 38 When pH was increased from 6.0 to 7.0, phosphate group would deprotonate, resulting in negatively charged NADH. Electrostatic repulsion between NADH and CdS would inhibit the adsorption of NADH, and reduce NADH oxidation rate. When pH value was further increased from 7.0 to 9.0, the oxidation rate only decreased slightly (Figure S13). This was consistent with the unchanged potential of NADH between pH 7.0-9.0, which confirmed that the adsorption of NADH during the conversion of NADH into NADH• + was the rate-limiting step in photocatalytic NADH oxidation. 39 During photocatalytic NADH oxidation, both enzymatically active NAD + and inactive ADP-ribose derivatives were generated. This would reduce the effective electron shuttle (NADH/NAD + ) between photocatalyst and enzyme. To inhibit the generation of ADP-ribose derivatives, one step hydride transfer instead of three step electron-proton-electron transfer should be constructed between NADH and photo-generated holes. Firstly, dopamine, a commonly used catalyst for electrochemical NADH oxidation, was adopted to mediate NADH oxidation. 40 The interconversion between dopamine and dopamine quinone should allow the one-step hydride transfer between NADH and photo-generated holes. 41 As shown in Figure 5a, after adding 2 mg mL -1 dopamine, the percentage of ADP-ribose derivatives in the oxidation solution decreased from 41.2±3.9% to 10.2±2.4%. This confirmed the role of dopamine in mediating one-step hydride transfer between NADH and photo-generated holes. Moreover, NADH oxidation rate got increased with dopamine concentration (Figure 5b). This should be arisen from the better interfacial affinity of dopamine bearing catechol groups than NADH, which accelerated the interfacial electron transfer and subsequent NADH oxidation (Figure 5c). Moreover, dopamine kept stable during photocatalytic NADH oxidation, which did not polymerize into polydopamine as verified by UV-vis spectrum (Figure S14). However, dopamine was usually not stable under aerobic condition, which restricted its use for aerobic enzyme. Inspired by flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) mediated NADPH oxidation, neutral red, a stable chemical under both anaerobic and aerobic condition, was used to mediate NADH oxidation (Figure S15). 42 As shown in Figure 5a, after adding 2 mg mL -1 neutral red, only 1.8±0.1% of the initially added NADH was fragmented into ADP-ribose derivatives. Neutral red and dopamine successfully mediated NADH oxidation to NAD + , other than ADP-ribose derivatives. Ferredoxin-NADP + reductase.
