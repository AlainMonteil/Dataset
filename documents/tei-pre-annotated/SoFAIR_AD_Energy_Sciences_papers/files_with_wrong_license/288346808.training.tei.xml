        <p>An electrolyzer and fuel cell together form an electrochemical battery with a storage capacity limited by storage media, not the conversion device. A proton-exchange membrane (PEM) system that is used to store and release chemical energy from hydrogen molecule also has the added advantages of extended storage life and portability. However, electrochemical energy conversion using two discrete PEM devices (fuel cell and electrolyzer) adds significant capital costs. Unitized regenerative fuel cells (URFC) can reduce the price if a single unit can achieve high roundtrip efficiencies (RTE). Thus, exploring the operational RTE limits of URFCs is essential. We assess the RTEs of PEM-based URFCs in an unconventional configuration where</p>
        <p>Energy storage is increasingly important for electrical grid resiliency as intermittent and variable energy sources intermingle on the electrical grid. 1 There are numerous energy and time domains that require the appropriate energy-storage technology at a low price point. These solutions include technologies whose deployment is regionally dependent, such as hydropower and air compression, that can depend on the presence of geological features. 2,3 In contrast, electrochemical-based storage technologies can be readily deployed without geological constraints, including lithium-ion batteries, flow batteries, and electrolyzers (EL). 4 The capital and operational expenditures (capex and opex, respectively) of each technology dictate the amount and timescale over which the system can store energy. 5 For example, even though the cost of lithium batteries has come down tremendously due to the emerging battery-electric vehicle industry, the cost to store more than four hours of energy makes them prohibitive for longer duration energy-storage applications. 6 For longer time domains, flow batteries and hydrogen storage have been proposed due to the ability to decouple the energy-conversion and the energy-storage components of the system, since storage tanks can be used to hold electrolyte or hydrogen (H 2 ), respectively. Hydrogen, produced from electricity and water in an electrolyzer 4 (EL) is considered, in particular, as a versatile long-term and seasonal energy storage option. The hydrogen can then be used for heat generation, transportation, chemical feedstock or converted back to electricity using a fuel cell (FC), as outlined in the Department of Energy's H2@Scale initiative. 7 The EL and FC devices together constitute a H-ion battery, charging the H + ions into H 2 using electricity, and discharging the stored H 2 . Conventionally, this H-ion battery is called a discrete regenerative fuel cell (RFC). When the EL and FC functionalities are combined in one device, the device is termed a unitized regenerative fuel cell (URFC). While RFCs or URFCs have conventionally been used or promoted for use in limited payload applications such as unmanned vehicles, 8 the emerging energy landscape demands cost-competitive solutions for various energy-storage scenarios. 5 The advantage of URFC over RFCs is the reduction in capex due to the minimization of cell components from two stacks into one. This paper aims to demonstrate the upper limit of roundtrip efficiency, durability, and the resulting opex of the URFC in order to determine the energy/time domain that would make the URFC cost competitive with other energy-storage technologies.</p>
        <p>An URFC (Figure 1), consists of a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) that contains an ionconducting membrane, typically a H + -conducting perfluorosulfonic-acid membrane, which separates the electrodes that perform the electrocatalysis (catalyst layer) and gas or liquid transport (gas diffusion or porous transport layers). 9 During charge (EL mode), the oxygenevolution reaction (OER) occurs at the anode and the hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode. During discharge (FC mode), the hydrogen-oxidation reaction (HOR) occurs at the anode and the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode. An URFC requires that each electrode is bifunctional in order to sustain both modes of operation. Such bifunctionality can be accomplished in two configurations: constant-gas (CG) or constant-electrode (CE). In the CG configuration, the URFC consists of an oxygen electrode (ORR/OER) and a hydrogen electrode (HOR/HER) (Figure 2). 10 The advantages of the CG configuration are that H 2 and O 2 mixing is avoided, and fast switching times between charge and discharge are possible. The disadvantages have historically been that the two most thermodynamically, kinetically, and transport-limited reactions, the ORR and OER, are combined on the same side of the cell resulting in a confluence of inefficiencies. In the CE configuration, the URFC consists of an anode (HOR/OER) and a cathode (ORR/HER) and the gases present on the anode and cathode are switched between EL and FC modes. 11 This configuration has distinct advantages in improving the transport of O 2 and kinetics of the ORR by optimizing the cathode catalyst and gas-diffusion layers (GDLs), while taking advantage of the facile HOR on the anode side, allowing for a reduction in catalyst loading and improved OER kinetics as well. The disadvantages of this configuration are that each electrode experiences a wider range of potentials when transitioning between FC and EL modes, which can cause higher rates of materials degradation, limiting device lifetime, and that there is a need to engineer safe transitions between charge and discharge modes to avoid mixing of oxygen and hydrogen. While CG mode has been studied in the literature, there is a dearth of such investigations into CE mode operation, especially with respect to optimizing the membrane electrode assembly for roundtrip efficiency (RTE) and durability. Furthermore, the application of URFCs has largely been limited to restricted payload vehicles; thus there is an absence or discussion of applications in the energy-storage field. There are several review papers that summarize recent progress. [12][13][14][15][16] Several studies have focused on investigating and analyzing component performance and system efficiencies for URFCs. 8,17,18 However, the bulk of the focus is on development of CG ORR/OER bifunctional catalyst layers. [19][20][21][22][23] Omrani and Shabani presented a comprehensive review of GDLs from the perspective of URFC system requirements. 24 Ito et al., on the other hand, evaluated the efficiency of a CG mode URFC at both system and stack level. 17</p>
        <p>There is a lack of studies in the URFC literature on the following topics: 1) design of URFC for optimal efficiency, 2) efficiency comparison of CE and CG configurations, and 3) design of URFCs for energy-storage applications. Our approach is to make the case for URFCs as devices for energy storage for durations longer than 4 h by redesigning the URFC MEA with state-ofthe-art materials and approaches currently used in FC and EL research. The aim is to identify a competitive configuration for a unitized regenerative fuel cell in terms of upper limit of RTE, while also demonstrating the mode cycling durability. We first tune the optimal Pt/Ir ratios under discrete FC and EL conditions before combining them into a URFC MEA and comparing CE and CG modes. We also demonstrate how different components of the FC and EL have to be down-selected to operate without drastic loss in performance or materials degradation. Then, we demonstrate the performance, efficiency, and durability through an accelerated stress test (AST) and daily cycling in the well-known "duck-curve" scenario which represents daily expected fluctuations in load and demands. 25</p>
        <p>Parameters for typical catalyst ink and catalyst-layer preparation are included in Table S1. For the Pt/C inks, calculated amounts of Pt/C (45.6 wt% Pt, Tanaka), water (18.2 MΩ, Milli-Q), 1propanol (NPA, HPLC grade, Sigma-Aldrich), and Nafion™ (5 wt% solution, 1100EW, Ion Power) are added in the stated sequence using a gravimetric method. The ink components are mixed either by manually shaking or vortexing the vial for one minute followed by sonication in a bath sonicator (M1800, Branson) equipped with a chiller (Grant) at 12°C for 30 minutes for ink volumes of &lt;30 mL or 60 min at 10°C for ink volumes &gt;30 mL. Similarly, for the unsupported catalyst inks, Ir-black (Tanaka) or a mixture of Ir-black and Pt-black (Tanaka), water, ethanol (200 proof, Koptec), NPA, and Nafion™ are added in the stated sequence. The vial is shaken or vortexed and then placed in an ice bath ensuring that the entire column of the ink is submersed in ice water. Using a probe tip sonicator, the tip of the probe (CPX500, Cole-Parmer) is placed 2 cm from the bottom of the vial and then the top of the vial is covered with parafilm to avoid solvent evaporation during probe sonication. Regardless of content, after sonication, the ink is immediately analyzed using dynamic light scattering (DLS, NanoPlus) (Figure S1), loaded into a syringe, and the syringe is mounted onto a spray coater for deposition.</p>
        <p>The Nafion™ perfluorosulfonic acid membranes (N212 or N117, Ion Power) are prepared by heating in DI water at 95°C for an hour and then immersed in 0.5 M HNO 3 (ACS Reagent, Sigma-Aldrich) for an hour at room temperature to remove impurities and protonate the sulfonic-acid groups. Finally, the treated membranes are rinsed three times with water to remove excess acid and stored in DI water until catalyst coating is performed.</p>
        <p>For preparation of the catalyst-coated membrane (CCM), the membranes are placed on the vacuum table of the Sono-Tek Exactacoat spray coater, and sandwiched between layers of gasket materials. The membrane is allowed to dry on the vacuum hot plate at 80°C prior to deposition of the catalyst ink. The membrane is coated on both sides in order to obtain a full MEA. The atomic Ir:Pt of the catalyst layers were determined using X-ray fluorescence (Bruker, Tornado M4) (Figure S2) . Tefzel™ (CS Hyde) gaskets are used in order to obtain 20% compression in GDLs, while thickness-matched gaskets are used for the Ti-PTL. For the URFC tests, the Ti-PTL was wetproofed with PTFE dispersion (DISP 30, Ion Power) according to the procedure described by Ito et al. 26 Two electrochemical cells are used for testing. One cell was obtained from Fuel Cell Technologies (FCT) and the other was a non-proprietary electrolysis cell provided by Proton OnSite/NEL. PTFE gaskets are used for assembly on FCT cell while Tefzel™ gaskets are used 10 on the NEL cell, as prescribed by the manufacturer. For FC testing, serpentine channels are used on both the cathode and anode. For EL and URFC, graphite serpentine channels are used on the HOR, HER or ORR side of the cell depending on the URFC configuration, while either parallel or serpentine channel titanium (Pt plated) flow fields are exclusively used on the OER electrode (bifunctional OER/ORR or OER/HOR). iR compensation was applied to the FC results using Ti flowfields due to a resistance that was introduced. We attributed the resistance to a contact resistance between unplated Titanium on the back side of the flowfield with the gold plated copper current collector of the cell. This resistance was not present when graphite flowfields were used.</p>
        <p>A multichannel potentiostat (VSP300) from Biologic equipped with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and a 20A booster is used for electrochemical tests. The test station used is a modified FCT FC test stand; the modification is an addition of a water recirculation system for the EL and URFC testing. As illustrated in Figure S3, the anode side of the fuel-cell stand is modified to allow switching between gases (H 2 /N 2 ) from the test stand and liquid water from an external diaphragm pump (KNF NF25). While 18.2 MΩ water is delivered from the temperatureregulated water reservoir, additional cell heating is provided by heating pads. For consistency between cells used and best practice for each technology, the cell temperature is controlled by a thermocouple in the endplate of the cell. In EL mode, we additionally monitor the anode outlet temperature. The temperature used throughout these studies is 80°C.</p>
        <p>For EL-mode testing, water is recirculated on the anode side of the cell only. Conditioning consists of equilibrating the cell at 80°C for an hour with anode water flow at 100 mL min -1 and cathode N 2 flow at 0.17 Pa and 100% relative humidity (RH) and no back pressure. Then the cathode gas is switched to H 2 and current is stepped chronopotentiometrically (CP). The CP steps are evenly spread from 0.01 A/cm 2 to 2 A/cm 2 with durations of 2 min step -1 for all steps except 2 A cm -2 , which has duration of 2 hr. After 2 h at 2 A cm -2 , the rest of the CP steps are performed in reverse order. Average voltage values for the t = 110-120 s are used for each step. ASTs are performed on the final down-selected URFC MEA and cell. The protocol is chosen by combining the currently-available FC and EL ASTs. 27,28 A triangle-wave cycling profile is applied to the anode side of the cell, biased against the cathode counter electrode/reference electrode, the voltage profile is 0.05 to 1.55 V or 0.55 to 1.55 V, for typical voltage ranges of CE and CG URFC cycles, respectively as shown in SI Figure S4. The potentials for ASTs are chosen to reflect the potential window the Ir-black+Pt-black electrode would be exposed to as the URFC undergoes the complete charge (EL) and discharge (FC) operation in CE and CG configurations. Thus, we are mainly probing the voltage effects on degradation of the CE-URFC MEA. The cycle is repeated 10,000 times at a rate of 300 mV/sec. At regular and convenient (manual operation and overnight test) intervals, the cycle is stopped and FC and EL performance tests are performed under the standard conditions described above to ascertain the change in performance as a result of the AST cycles. We emphasize that under both CE and CG ASTs, the performance of the MEA is always tested in CE mode for consistency. Aliquots of the water are then collected for dissolved ions analysis from AST and charge-discharge cycling. The water samples were quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (7900 ICP-MS, Agilent) using the He mode. The internal standard was Bi selected based on its first ionization potential and M/Z as compared to Ir and Pt. As a final demonstration, a duck-curve profile where the URFC cell is charged for 6 h and discharged for 4 h. During durability testing, the URFC cell is held either at ±1 A/cm 2 using CA.</p>
        <p>For all efficiency calculations we follow the guidance from Harrison et al. and detailed in SI, the thermodynamic values have been adjusted for temperature (80 °C) and pressure (145 kPa). 29 We note that since the EL efficiencies are calculated based on the enthalpy of hydrogen (at reaction temperature and pressure) and required heat input corresponding to 1.42 V, divided by the URFC operating cell voltage at desired charging current. Nonsense efficiencies higher than 100% are possible at low current densities since the heat input is not included, while being provided by the resistive losses of the cell.</p>
        <p>We adopt the levelized cost of storage metric (LCOS) of Schmidt et al. 2018, 5 and use the approach for techno-economic analysis described in Wei et al 2014 and Scataglini &amp; Wei 2017 that includes bottom-up cost analysis of the URFC or RFC cell stack(s), development of system schematic design and identification of balance of plant (BOP) components, and BOP component cost estimation. 30,31 For all cost calculations, a 250 kW system is used.</p>
        <p>The MEA design philosophy consisted of optimizing the FC and EL discreetly, meaning using cells, diffusion media, and membranes optimized for the separate cells. The results from discrete systems are used to understand the origin of the losses as we compromise upon combining the components into a URFC MEA, cell, and diffusion media. The membrane, catalyst and diffusion media chosen are commercially-available materials used to obtain a baseline performance and a degree of robustness for the work. To avoid carbon corrosion, Pt/C catalysts, carbon GDLs and graphite flow-fields are not used above 1 V. Instead, Ti-PTL, Ti flow-fields and unsupported Pt-black and Ir-black are used for electrodes experiencing potentials above 1 V. Aside from the choice of catalyst, the membrane is the second critical component that can drastically contribute to decreased voltage efficiency. 32 Membranes are pretreated by boiling in order to obtain the highest conductivity, to reduce in-cell swelling, and to stabilize the membranes for operation under liquid operation (EL mode). While state-of-the-art (SOA) FC membranes are very thin, i.e. less than 10 µm, we use N212 (51 µm) as it is still the most commonly used research FC membrane, and ideal for comparison to literature results. 33,34 Similarly, for EL tests, N117 (183 µm) is used as it represents a SOA membrane and a direct comparison to literature results. 35 Thus for URFC testing, we chose to use N212 as a compromise membrane since the purpose of this investigation is to identify a competitive configuration for a URFC, and demonstrate it in terms of upper limit of RTE. We point out here that the final choice of membrane will ultimately depend on the system design parameters and whether to include electrochemical compression of H 2 and perhaps O 2 as well. It should also be noted that oxygen storage is deemed optional depending on technology and usage. An O 2 cathode feed can generate higher power output than air where it is necessary. Depending on the system choice, the ultimate operation may require differential or balanced pressure, in which case gas crossover must be taken into account and mitigated. Mitigation in electrolysis is typically achieved by increasing the membrane thickness and through the use of other crossover mitigation strategies, 36 and is beyond the scope of this paper.</p>
        <p>The electrolysis optimization is performed on N117, keeping the EL cathode catalyst loading constant at 0.3 mg/cm 2 Pt (from Pt/C). It has previously been demonstrated by Bernt and Gasteiger that 11.6 wt% ionomer content (with respect to catalyst weight) generates the best activity when titanium dioxide-supported iridium oxide (Umicore) is the anode catalyst. 37 Our investigations (Figure S5) also confirm a similar trend when Ir-black is used as the anode catalyst. For the URFC anodes, the Ir-black to Pt-black atomic ratio is varied at a fixed total platinum group metal (PGM) loading of 1 mg/cm 2 while keeping the ionomer content at 11.6 wt%. The resulting electrolyzer polarization curves are presented in Figure 3. The performances are also compared to a baseline EL MEA containing only Ir-black on the EL-anode. From the polarization curves in Figure 3, it is apparent that the substitution of the stated fraction of Irblack in the anode catalyst layer with Pt-black leads to, as expected, an almost linear loss in its oxygen evolution performance. Increasing the Pt loading in the EL-anode catalyst layer results in at least 40 mV penalty at 1 A/cm 2 when 10 at% Pt is substituted for Ir as compared to the baseline's performance. When Pt content is increased further it results in higher losses, especially at higher current densities. Here, the potential advantage of the CE configuration is evident in that only a small amount of Pt-black is expected to be sufficient since the anode is catalyzing hydrogen oxidation, a relatively facile electrochemical reaction, in FC mode. While in CG configuration, the kinetically sluggish ORR will need a higher amount of Pt, resulting in lower EL performance. For FC optimization, CCMs are prepared on N212 with the FC-cathode catalyst loading of 0.3 mg/cm 2 Pt (from Pt/C), while the FC-anode Ir-black to Pt-black atomic ratio was varied, at a fixed total PGM loading of 1 mg/cm 2 . The resulting FC performances are presented in Figure 4, and compared to a baseline FC MEA containing only Pt/C (0.3 mg/cm 2 Pt) as the FC-anode.</p>
        <p>Contrary to expectations, an increase in Pt-black content in the anode did not lead to improvements in FC performance. While an anode with 10 at% Pt-black (X = 90) performs statistically similar to the baseline (100 at% or 0.3 mg/cm 2 Pt from Pt/C), a subsequent increase in Pt-black content leads to a decrease in FC performance for 85 at% and 70 at%. Since geometric HOR active site density is much higher than at 90 at% Ir, one can speculate that the performance losses are either due to ohmic or mass-transport limitations on the URFC anodes at higher Pt content. However, increase in metallic Pt content in the catalyst layer should lead to improved conductivity rather than increased ohmic losses since the I:C ratio and catalyst layer thickness is uniform across the MEAs. Thus, a mass-transport limitation is a more probable cause. The FC with a 90 at% Ir-black (10 at% Pt-black) anode generates 0.71 V at 1 A/cm 2 , which is marginally higher than the 0.70 V generated by the baseline FC. Anode Pt loadings lower than 10 at% Pt-black also lead to substantial loss in cell voltage. In order to further investigate the unexpected results with increasing Pt black loading in the bifunctional electrodes, we prepared FC MEAs with varying loadings of Pt-black catalyst on one half of the MEA, and tested that electrode as an anode (HOR) or cathode (ORR). The unexpected results shown in As a comparison to the traditional CG-configuration URFC cell, we also show in Figure 4, the corresponding performance of the Pt-and Ir-black cathodes (used as ORR electrode). First, it is clear that the CG-configuration URFC cannot obtain comparable performance to the CEconfiguration, at least when unsupported Pt catalyst is used, even with optimized GDLs and flow fields for ORR. Switching to Ti PTL instead of 29 BC and Ti parallel flow field instead of serpentine graphitic for URFC incur additional performance losses (Figure S7). Secondly, the higher Pt loading required for the ORR is also bound to result in reduced performance in EL mode, as is apparent from Figure 3. Thus, even before the diffusion media and flow fields are compromised, the CG configuration suffers an operating penalty of 300 mV at 1 A/cm 2 for a 90 at% Ir-black cathode. The 90 at%-10 at% Ir-black and Pt-black composite catalyst layer is selected as the optimal electrode for CE-URFC operation.</p>
        <p>Next we assess the RTE of optimized URFC MEAs, in URFC cell hardware. The URFC catalyst layers are evaluated on the same N212 (51 µm) membrane instead of thicker N117 (183 µm) used for the discrete EL. As shown in Figure 5, using N212 as the membrane and employing the URFC MEA as FC and EL improves the RTE to 57% at 1 A/cm 2 and 30% at 2 A/cm 2 (Table S2).</p>
        <p>As shown by the overlaid efficiency curve, the URFC can achieve higher RTE if operated at lower current densities. For comparison, Figure S8, shows the comparable RTE for a discrete RFC system. In the discrete configuration, the optimal EL and FC have efficiencies of 81% and 58%, respectively at 1 A/cm 2 , corresponding to 47% RTE for the URFC. Thus, using the CE configuration, minimal compromise in performance or efficiency is made with appropriate adjustments of components, as demonstrated here by using N212 instead of N117 membrane.</p>
        <p>More importantly, for the balance of stack cost, membrane cost is decreased by 50% (one membrane for URFC vs two for discrete system), Pt content by 55% (0.4 mg/cm 2 total platinum loading in URFC vs 0.9 mg/cm 2 in discrete), and 10% reduction for Ir content (1.0 mg/cm 2 for discrete vs 0.9 mg/cm 2 for URFC). Thus, there are distinct advantages for reducing the capex and opex, depending on the ultimate in cell pressurization chosen. Figure 5. Polarization curves for a unitized regenerative fuel cell using N212 with the optimal 90 at% Ir-black (10 at% Pt-black) in the anode catalyst layer. FC performance is obtained using air as reactant. FC and EL polarization curves (solids) were obtained using the same MEA, same FCT cell hardware with titanium triple serpentine flowfield and titanium PTL loaded with 3 wt% PTFE on anode, and triple serpentine graphite flowfield and 29 BC GDL on cathode. FC, EL, and URFC efficiencies are plotted on the secondary y-axis. The FC activities are iR corrected for resistance associated with titanium flowfield.</p>
        <p>To determine the highest RTE achievable with the URFC hardware, FC polarization curves were acquired for the URFC MEA using O 2 as the cathode gas rather than air (Table S2). As shown in Figure S9, FC performance in the kinetic region is identical when using O 2 or air on the cathode.</p>
        <p>As expected, the onset of the mass-transport-limited region is at much lower current densities for air feed on cathode than for O 2 feed. As apparent from Figure 6, even with the use of titanium flowfield and PTL on the anode, RTE efficiencies are improved, resulting in RTEs of 61% and 50%, at 1 and 2 A/cm 2 , respectively. The losses resulting from hardware compromises (Figure S7) are easily compensated by adjustments in cathode feed. This RTE is the highest reported to date for any low temperature URFC system (Table S3), 13,38 bettered only by solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operating at much higher temperatures. 39,40 Duan et al. recently reported a protonic ceramic URFC which achieved 75% RTE at 840 mA/cm 2 in charge and 140 mA/cm 2 in discharge mode. 39 The RTE for the URFC in Figure 6 at those charge-discharge values is 70%.</p>
        <p>Although the SOFC reported a higher RTE, they however suffer from the need to ramp up to higher temperatures during start-up and cannot idle. Additionally, operational and manufacturing costs are also higher for SOFCs due to the need to manage heat and the need to use thermally stable components at elevated temperatures. Figure 6. Polarization curves for a unitized regenerative fuel cell using N212 with the optimal 90 at% Ir-black (10 at% Pt-black) in the anode catalyst layer. FC performance is obtained using O 2 as reactant. FC and EL polarization curves (solids) were obtained using the same MEA, same FCT cell hardware with titanium triple serpentine flowfield and titanium PTL loaded with 3 wt% PTFE on anode, and triple serpentine graphite flowfield and 29 BC GDL on cathode. FC, EL, and URFC efficiencies are plotted on the secondary y-axis. The FC activities are iR corrected for resistance associated with titanium flowfield.</p>
        <p>To assess the durability of the optimized URFC MEA and cell, voltage-cycling ASTs are performed to accelerate catalyst degradation. [41][42][43] First, a FC break-in is performed, followed by the beginning of life (BOL) performance assessment in FC mode. Transitions are handled by switching anode to liquid water flow and cathode to nitrogen, followed by BOL performance in EL mode. The AST cycling is then initiated, consisting of cyclic anode voltage from 1.55 V to 0.05 V (CE mode) or 0.55 V (CG mode). These voltage windows correspond to the expected voltages the anode electrode would experience in FC and EL operation at 1 A/cm 2 (Figure 6).</p>
        <p>After a certain number of AST cycles, the cycling is stopped to allow for FC and EL performances to be recorded prior to resuming the AST. We note that any performance loss could arise from a combination of degradation of both electrodes, membrane, or wetting of the GDL/PTL. The voltage efficiency is assessed from the EL or FC voltages at cycle "n" divided by the BOL cell voltage and plotted in Figure 7. The results show that in CE and CG configuration, the EL and FC voltage efficiency and RTEs are maintained for several thousand cycles. The EL performance is maintained at almost 100% for the entire duration of 10k cycles, while the FC performance starts degrading between 2k and 7k cycles. Prior to degradation however, the FC performance actually improves, i.e. the potential at 1 A/cm 2 load increases from 0.69 V to 0.73 V. The observations are similar to previous FC break in protocols where hydration of the membrane shows apparent improvement in activity. 44 Most of the BOL efficiency penalties shown in Figure 7, when compared to Figure 5, can be attributed to the use of parallel flowfields and Ti-PTL on the anode side (Figure S7). This could easily be compensated by using O 2 instead of air as the cathode feed, as demonstrated in Figure 6. Comparing the CG and CE AST cycling on the URFC anode in Figure 7, shows that the stability over the lifetime of the URFC is similar although the potential cycling window (Figure S4) for the CG configuration is narrower (0.55-1.55 V) than for the CE configuration (0.05-1.55 V). The same initial improvement in FC activity is seen in the CG cycling window, before degrading beyond 2k AST cycles. This is a reassuring result, since one of the potential disadvantages of the CE configuration is that the lower potentials required for HOR on the anode (versus ORR on the cathode) will lead to faster degradation of the anode catalyst layer compared to the oxygen electrode in the CG configuration. Results in Figure 7 are also consistent with previous observations since the differential potential window (0.05-0.55 V) for the electrode between CG and CE configurations is below the potential threshold for voltage dependent Pt-dissolution. 45 Most importantly, the RTE after 10k cycles is better than all BOL RTEs reported thus far at 1 A/cm 2 for PEM based URFCs (see Table S3). 13,38 We also demonstrate the application of the CE-URFC in a duck-curve energy-storage scenario in which the cell is charged at 1A/cm 2 for 6 h, followed by discharging at 1A/cm 2 for 4 h (Figure 8). One day's worth of stable charge and discharge, with an average RTE of 54% are shown in Figure 8, operating on air during discharge. Neither the AST cycling tests nor the chargedischarge cycling showed detectable amount of Ir and Pt dissolution using ICP-MS analysis (Table S4). Although Pt and Ir could migrate into the membrane and ionomer phase in the catalyst layers, this was outside the scope of our current work. Finally, we performed a preliminary cost analysis (Table 1) comparing CE and CG configuration. As a comparison, we have also included analysis for a discrete RFC with N212 membrane for both EL and FC mode. We assume for the purposes of this work that (1) the stack and system lifetimes are equivalent for both configurations (Figure 7); (2) that the key difference in the balance of plant components for the CE configuration is the inclusion of an N 2 purge subsystem that is required when switching between operation modes; (3) a daily duty cycle of 6 hours charging followed by 4 hours discharging (Figure 8); and (4) future capital costs corresponding to much higher PEM industry production volumes. With these assumptions, we estimate about a 5% increase in the BOP cost and about $3500/year N 2 gas cost for the CE case. Assuming the same PGM loading for the two cases, the FC and RTE of the CE configuration is much higher than the CG configuration (Case a vs Case b in Table 1 above). The higher RTE is more than sufficient to offset the slightly higher URFC capital and operating cost from N 2 -purge in the CE configuration. The LCOS of case a is about 14% lower than LCOS of case b. We also consider the case of higher PGM loading in the CG configuration to improve the FC mode efficiency. In this case, the URFC capital cost is slightly higher than the CE case but the LCOS for the CE case is still slightly lower (case a vs case c). The LCOS for the CE configuration (case a) is also seen to be about 14% lower than the reference discrete RFC (case d), i.e. a system with a discrete EL and discrete FC. The URFC configurations in Table 1 have about 22% lower system capital cost driven largely from the cost reduction derived from consolidation of the stacks.</p>
        <p>We have demonstrated operating round trip efficiencies (RTEs) of a unitized regenerative fuel cells (URFCs) in the two possible configurations. From the discussions and results presented here, it can be concluded that URFCs in constant-electrode (CE) configuration where all reductions (HER/ORR) take place on cathode and all oxidations (HOR/OER) on anode can achieve RTEs of 60% (at 1 A/cm 2 ), comparable to discrete fuel cells and electrolyzers. URFCs operating in CE configuration perform significantly better than in constant-gas (CG) configuration where the oxygen reactions (ORR/OER) take place on one electrode and the hydrogen reactions (HOR/HER) take place on the other. Compared to discrete mode, URFCs achieve significant catalyst (10% Ir and 55% Pt) and membrane (50%) reductions, in addition to simplifying or reducing balance-of-plant components. Our initial assessment of various compromises and configurational modifications necessary to translate a PEM-based electrolyzer (EL) and fuel cell (FC) into a unitized system shows that penalties incurred can mostly be overcome or minimized by operating in CE configuration. We demonstrate that a 10 at% Ptblack/90 at% Ir-black bifunctional HOR/OER anode catalyst layer is sufficient to maintain HOR activity in FC comparable to a baseline FC, while the higher Ir-black loadings incur a minimal performance loss in EL mode. This high efficiency can largely be maintained over 10k accelerated stress test (AST) cycles. We also demonstrate the CE-URFC in a duck curve reflecting daily fluctuations in energy load and demand, energy-storage scenario by charging for 6 h, and discharging for 4 h. Finally, preliminary cost analysis of the two configurations show that URFC operation in CE configuration has the potential to reduce cost of energy storage compared to the traditional CG case, resulting a levelized cost of energy storage of 0.308$/kWh well within the range of competing technologies. The URFC capital cost is about 22% lower than using discrete EL and FC units to form regenerative fuel cell (RFC) system. Levelized cost of CE URFC is 14% lower than the RFC. Although CG-configuration URFCs have been investigated, and to a limited extent even employed, CE-configuration URFCs hold promise as a technology that is ready for systems integration. Our assessments suggest that the primary challenge to CE-configuration URFCs will be to engineer catalyst layers and systems that are stable in both charge (EL) and discharge (FC) operating modes. However, with copious amount of technology readily available for improvements in terms of materials and system configurations, there is ample promise for further progress and wider implementation of URFCs.</p>
