        <p>Hybrid solar and geothermal utilisation is a promising option for effective exploitation of renewable energy sources. Concentrated solar power (CSP) systems with geothermal preheating are acknowledged as an attractive solution, with supercritical CO2 (SCO2) cycle systems adopted for power generation thanks to the favourable properties offered by CO2 as a working fluid. In order to further improve the overall performance of such systems, organic Rankine cycle (ORC) systems can be added as bottoming cycles to recover the heat rejected from the topping SCO2 cycle system and also to utilise surplus geothermal heat available after the brine is used for preheating in the SCO2 system. This paper proposes four configurations of combined SCO2-ORC system for hybrid solar and geothermal power generation and performs detailed thermodynamic and economic assessments based on actual conditions in Seville, Spain. The results reveal that combined systems in which the geothermalbrine stream is split into two parallel flows and utilised separately by the topping SCO2 cycle and bottoming ORC systems are preferable. A split geothermal-stream combined system with the ORC working fluid first utilising geothermal heat followed in series by heat from the topping SCO2 cycle system delivers a net power output of 2940 kW, which is the maximum among all the proposed configurations and is 45% higher than that of a standalone SCO2 plant. A similar combined system with a reversed ORC flow direction such that the organic fluid is preheated first by utilising heat from the SCO2 cycle system and then by geothermal heat has a specific cost corresponding to the maximum net power output of 2880 $/kW, which is the lowest among all the configurations and is 22% lower than that of the standalone SCO2 plant. Annual performance evaluation shows that the combined systems can achieve significant improvements, ranging from 22% to 45%, over the total electricity generation of the standalone SCO2 plant, which demonstrates the significant potential of deploying such novel and promising combined systems for hybrid solar and geothermal power generation.Hybrid solar and geothermal utilisation is a promising option for effective exploitation of renewable energy sources.

        <p>Power generation from fossil fuels is leading to resource depletion, as well as health and environmental deterioration concerns. The exploitation of renewable energy sources, in particular solar, geothermal, wind and biomass, is attracting increasing attention in this context, as it is sustainable and clean solution for meeting the growing global demand for electricity. It has been reported that the share of renewables in the global electricity generation reached 26% in 2018, and has been forecast to grow by a further 50% between 2019 and 2024 [1]. As a widely accessible renewable resource, solar energy has the potential to play a key role in most future energy systems, and is having an impact in many regions, with solar thermal [2,3], photovoltaic (PV) [4,5] and hybrid PV-thermal [6][7][8] technologies all being promising technology options. Geothermal heat is also an attractive renewable resource, which has the advantage of being suitable for baseload generation given its relatively steady and reliable supply characteristics [9].Power generation from fossil fuels is leading to resource depletion, as well as health and environmental deterioration concerns.

        <p>The hybridisation of solar and geothermal resources was reported as early as 1975 by Finlayson and Kammer [10], and continues to draw attention for power, heating and/or cooling provision. Extensive research on hybrid solar and geothermal utilisation is available and is attracting increasing interest. Ayub et al. [11] performed a thermoeconomic analysis of a particular hybrid solar-binary geothermal power plant and revealed that the hybrid system had a potential for higher net power output (by 6%) and lower levelised electricity cost (by 2%) relative to a geothermal organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system. Lentz and Almanza [12] also considered a solar-geothermal hybrid system within which a parabolic-trough solar field was used to heat a geothermal brine, leading to an increase of 10% in steam production. A further thermoeconomic analysis of a micro combined heat and power (CHP) ORC system using both solar and geothermal heat inputs, while considering various working fluids was presented by Tempesti and Fiaschi [13]. Their results showed that R245fa allowed the lowest system cost of 290 k€, as well as the lowest price of electricity production of 93 €/MWh. Alirahmi et al. [14] performed multi-objective optimisation of a multi-generation energy system based on geothermal and solar energy, and showed that the exergy efficiency of the system and the total unit cost reached 30% and 130 $/GJ respectively at the optimal operating point. A concentrated solar-geothermal system integrated with a combined ejector-absorption refrigeration cycle was investigated by Al-Hamed and Dincer [15], who reported an overall energetic efficiency value as high as 53% and a COP of the combined cooling cycle of 1.03.

        <p>Concentrated solar power (CSP) [18] and hybrid solar-geothermal systems [19] are both promising solarenergy technologies; in particular in the case of the former, there is already a growing market. Various powercycle options for CSP applications are available [20,21], among which supercritical CO2 (SCO2) cycle systems are acknowledged as an attractive heat-to-power conversion technology thanks to key advantages offered by the properties of CO2 when this is used as a working fluid [22,23]. Specifically, CO2 is non-flammable, non-toxic and free from decomposition, which ensures safe operation at higher temperatures. In addition, a better temperature match can be achieved with high-temperature heat sources, thus reducing exergy losses in the heat transfer processes. These advantages make CO2-based systems an attractive option in CSP as well as hybrid solargeothermal applications. Yin et al. [24] conducted an extensive review of SCO2 cycle systems for CSP applications, including twelve single layouts and one combined layout, and concluded that the integration of SCO2 cycles into CSP systems held great promise for enhancing the competitiveness of these systems compared to other solar power generation technologies. Binotti et al. [25] performed a preliminary assessment of various SCO2 power cycles applied to high-temperature solar tower systems. Their results showed that the most promising option was the recompression configuration with intercooling employed in the main compression process, and reported an overall solar-to-electricity efficiency value that reached 25%. Similar work was performed by Zhu et al. [26], whose results indicated that intercooling SCO2 cycle systems could achieve the highest overall efficiency followed by recompression systems, partial-cooling systems, pre-compression systems and, finally, simple-cycle systems.Concentrated solar power (CSP) [18] and hybrid solar-geothermal systems [19] are both promising solarenergy technologies; in particular in the case of the former, there is already a growing market.

        <p>Due to the small pressure ratio, turbine outlet temperature of SCO2 cycles is relatively high. Although a recuperator is installed to utilise the high-grade thermal energy of the hot stream leaving the turbine, the heat rejected in the precooler (to the ambient) remains significant. Following from gas turbine combinedcycle (GTCC) systems, adding a bottoming cycle to displace the precooler and recover the heat rejected is beneficial for system performance. In the case of hybrid solar and geothermal power generation, heat available from the geothermal brine after preheating the SCO2 cycle can also be utilised, which motivates the pursuit of further performance enhancement in this work.Due to the small pressure ratio, turbine outlet temperature of SCO2 cycles is relatively high.

We present detailed models that predict system performance from both thermodynamic and economic perspectives and perform a case study in Seville, Spain, with local weather data and local geothermal resource conditions as inputs.

        <p>A schematic diagram of a standalone SCO2 plant for hybrid solar and geothermal power generation is shown in Figure 1, which is considered as a baseline case in this study for comparison purposes. The thermal energy collected in the parabolic trough collector (PTC) field is absorbed by the heat transfer fluid (HTF) and stored in a hot tank; the HTF enters a cold tank after transferring heat to the power cycle. Two tanks are used for storage [42,43] in order to overcome the inherent intermittency of the solar resource and to extend the system's capacity factor when the solar irradiance drops below its design value. Low-temperature geothermal heat is used to preheat the working fluid, and the solar heat extracted is utilised in the main heater. A recuperator is also installed between the preheater and the main heater in order to internally recover heat from the working fluid downstream of the turbine. The CO2 working fluid expands in the turbine to generate power, then flows to the recuperator and precooler to be cooled down, and then finally enters the compressor for the next cycle. Of interest is the fact that heat rejected in the precooler of the SCO2 plant, but also heat available in the geothermal brine stream after preheating the CO2 working fluid can be further recovered, so as to improve the overall system performance. In response to these possibilities, we envision in this work a bottoming ORC system and propose four specific system configurations as shown in Figure 2.

        <p>Although a smaller tank size is favourable in terms of cost, it also has a restricted storage capacity and thereby hinder the annual solar field thermal efficiency when the tank is filled with HTF. As a consequence, there exists an optimum (minimum) HTF flow rate in the solar field, beyond which the annual solar field thermal efficiency no longer increases with the HTF flow rate, as shown in Figure 4.

        <p>Figure 6 shows the net power output of the standalone SCO2 plant at different cold tank storage temperatures, with 10, 15 and 20 MPa as turbine inlet pressures and different turbine inlet temperatures. With the highest turbine pressure of 20 MPa, there exists an optimal turbine inlet temperature (~360 °C) for the SCO2 cycle system to provide the maximum net power output when the cold tank storage temperature is 250 °C, while in the other cases with cold tank storage temperature of 100, 150 and 200 °C , the net power output decreases at higher turbine inlet temperatures, and it decrease when cold tank storage temperature equals to 300 °C. 250 °C is the optimal value for the cold tank storage temperature based on the parametric analysis here, which indicates that the higher grade/level of heat source dominates even though the annual solar field thermal efficiency is lower (see Figure 4) compared with the cases of 100, 150 and 200 °C, while the solar field performance plays a critical role compared with the case of 300 °C. Another reason for the performance deterioration at low cold tank storage temperatures is that the preheating and recuperation processes are hindered, since the HTF needs to be cooled to the (specific) low temperature required by the cold tank. Figure 7 shows a breakdown of thermal loads in the preheater, recuperator and main heater at the specific operating condition of TT,in = 360 °C and PT,in = 20 MPa. The thermal load in the preheater (from the geothermal brine) increases with the cold tank storage temperature and the recuperated heat is also higher (the results for cases of 250 °C and 300 °C are similar), except for the case a cold tank storage temperature of 150 °C where the recuperated heat is tiny and the recuperation process is suppressed significantly. 4 are employed for the steady-state analysis of the standalone SCO2 plant. 4 are considered here for the steady-state analysis of the standalone SCO2 plant.Figure 6 shows the net power output of the standalone SCO2 plant at different cold tank storage temperatures, with 10, 15 and 20 MPa as turbine inlet pressures and different turbine inlet temperatures.

        <p>Figure 8(a) shows the maximum power output of the standalone SCO2 plant when employing different cold tank storage temperatures, while considering the entire possible operating spectrum of turbine inlet conditions, i.e., temperatures and pressures. As the cold tank storage temperature increases to 250 °C, a higher maximum net power output is attained, along with a lower SIC. While when the cold tank storage temperature continues increasing to 300 °C, the SCO2 cycle system yields a lower net power output due to the deterioration on the solar field performance (see Figure 4). Therefore, a cold tank temperature of 250 °C is optimal from both thermodynamic and economic perspectives, which enables the SCO2 plant to yield a maximum net power output of 2020 kW and a corresponding SIC of 3680 $/kW. This case is selected as the baseline and the cold tank storage temperature is also set as 250 °C for all the combined systems in the discussion below.Figure 8(a) shows the maximum power output of the standalone SCO2 plant when employing different cold tank storage temperatures, while considering the entire possible operating spectrum of turbine inlet conditions, i.e., temperatures and pressures.

        <p>For Combined Systems 1 and 2, the SCO2 cycle optimal operating conditions remain the same as those of the standalone plant, and the ORC system contributes to an additional increase in the net power output, which amounts to 22% and 35%, respectively. The geothermal stream from the well is split in Combined Systems 3 and 4, which results in a decrease in the net power output from the topping SCO2 cycle system, but also a net power output contribution from the ORC system that now accounts for a considerably larger fraction of the total.For Combined Systems 1 and 2, the SCO2 cycle optimal operating conditions remain the same as those of the standalone plant, and the ORC system contributes to an additional increase in the net power output, which amounts to 22% and 35%, respectively.

        <p>In particular in Combined System 4, in which the working fluid in the ORC system is preheated by recovering heat from the SCO2 cycle system and then, in series, heated further by utilising heat from one of the split, parallel geothermal brine streams, the ORC power output accounts for 48% of gross power output generated by the combined system. Combined System 3 delivers a maximum net power output of 2940 kW, which is the highest of all investigated hybrid combined configurations, and 45% higher than that of the standalone plant. Figure 10 shows T-Q plots of all four combined systems when these operate at the conditions associated with the maximum net power output shown in Figure 9, and can be used to indicate the operating conditions of both sub-systems as well as the thermal load distribution in each heat exchanger. We can see from Figure 10(a) that the ORC system in Combined System 1 only utilises the heat from the SCO2 cycle system and that the recovered amount is only 3830 kW, while in Figure 10 and then heat from a split geothermal brine stream (it is noted that the optimisation results indicate that the geothermal brine is sent entirely to the ORC system for this configuration). Results correspond to the operating conditions that achieve the maximum net power output shown in Figure 9.In particular in Combined System 4, in which the working fluid in the ORC system is preheated by recovering heat from the SCO2 cycle system and then, in series, heated further by utilising heat from one of the split, parallel geothermal brine streams, the ORC power output accounts for 48% of gross power output generated by the combined system. Combined System 3 delivers a maximum net power output of 2940 kW, which is the highest of all investigated hybrid combined configurations, and 45% higher than that of the standalone plant.

        <p>The geothermal brine stream is split into two parallel streams in Combined Systems 3 and 4, with corresponding T-Q plots shown in Figures 10(c) and 10(d). It can be seen that compared to Combined System 2, the total heat absorbed by the SCO2 cycle system decreases slightly, which mainly arises from the preheater, i.e., a smaller amount of heat from the geothermal resource is exploited to preheat the CO2 working fluid. The temperature level of the split geothermal stream sent to the bottoming ORC system is higher than that of the stream after preheating the CO2 working fluid (in Combined System 2), contributing to an increase in the ORC evaporation temperature in Combined System 3. On the other hand, the heat absorbed by the ORC system from the split geothermal brine stream is also higher, which further enhances the thermodynamic performance of the ORC system, and the increase in the bottoming cycle compensates the decrease in the topping cycle, enabling the Combined System 3 to deliver the maximum net power output among all the proposed configurations. As shown in Figure 10(d), the optimisation results indicate that the geothermal brine is sent entirely to the bottoming ORC system, which is the extreme splitting scenario corresponding to this configuration. In other words, the preheater (for geothermal brine) in the SCO2 cycle system is removed as geothermal energy is no longer utilised in the topping cycle. This is because the preheating process can be compensated by the recuperation in the SCO2 cycle system and the geothermal resource is able to contribute more to the overall power output when it is utilised in the bottoming ORC system. Heat absorbed by the bottoming ORC system is significantly higher than the other cases, which enables it to yield a considerable amount of power output with the topping SCO2 cycle in Combined System 4.The geothermal brine stream is split into two parallel streams in Combined Systems 3 and 4, with corresponding T-Q plots shown in Figures 10(c) and 10(d).

        <p>An exergy analysis of Combined System 3, which obtains the maximum net power output, is performed, with results showing the breakdown of exergy destruction of all the components are shown in Figure 11. The results indicate that of the combined system's total exergy destruction, the topping SCO2 cycle system accounts for a fraction of 63%, while the fraction contributed by the bottoming ORC is 37%. Of the individual components, the SCO2 precooler (28%) disproportionately dominates the total exergy losses, followed by a fraction of 14% by the SCO2 turbine. The turbine (11%), the preheater (10%) and the condenser (9%) are the dominant components accounting for exergy destruction in the bottoming ORC system.An exergy analysis of Combined System 3, which obtains the maximum net power output, is performed, with results showing the breakdown of exergy destruction of all the components are shown in Figure 11.

        <p>The SICs of all four combined systems are lower than the SIC of the standalone SCO2 plant thanks to the significant increase in the net power output. In particular for Combined System 4, the SIC corresponding to the maximum net power output is only 2880 $/kW, which is 22% lower than that of the standalone SCO2 plant. A detailed economic assessment across all system components (including the solar system) of Combined System 4 is implemented and the cost breakdown are shown in Figure 12. It can be seen that the cost-dominant component is the PTC field, as expected, which accounts for 25% of the total system cost. Other than the solar field, the most expensive components are the turbines for both sub-systems, followed by the SCO2 compressor, the ORC condenser, the HTF and the two tanks, which also contribute to a considerable fraction of the overall cost. While the pump of the ORC system has the lowest lost and it can be considered negligible. The rest of the heat exchanger components are associated with similar costs (between $100,000 and $230,000). The sub-total costs of the SCO2 and ORC sub-systems are $2,513,000 and $2,097,000, respectively. Considering the contribution to the total net power output by the SCO2 cycle system (52%) and ORC system (48%), this confirms that an ORC bottoming system is economically preferable compared to a SCO2 cycle system that is operating at high operating temperatures and pressures and allows Combined System 4 to yield the lowest SIC. conditions that achieve the maximum net power output shown in Figure 9.The SICs of all four combined systems are lower than the SIC of the standalone SCO2 plant thanks to the significant increase in the net power output.

        <p>In this final step in our analysis, the annual electricity generation potential of the proposed combined systems is assessed based on local weather conditions in Seville, Spain. The aforementioned power-cycle systems including the standalone SCO2 plant and the four combined systems are connected to the solar filed and the real operating conditions are considered. For this purpose, local weather data of hourly solar irradiance, ambient temperature and wind speed, as shown in Figure 13, were obtained and used as inputs to the model. Although the two tanks considered in the various hybrid combined system configurations can maintain a relatively stable operation of these systems, heat losses to the ambient from the tanks can also give rise to minor fluctuations in the HTF temperature as this flows to the main heater of the SCO2 cycle system. For this reason, the off-design performance of both sub-systems is considered, and all operating parameters are optimised to achieve the maximum net power output under each off-design condition, given fixed areas for all heat exchanger that have been determined in the design stage. It should also be stated that the efficiency of the SCO2 compressor, SCO2 turbine, ORC pump and ORC turbine are fixed and remain the same as at the design point, assuming that their deviations from the design condition will be small and that the systems are operated at the design condition for most of the operating time.In this final step in our analysis, the annual electricity generation potential of the proposed combined systems is assessed based on local weather conditions in Seville, Spain.

        <p>The standalone SCO2 plant generates 3730 MWh of electricity annually, whereas the four combined systems reach 4540 MWh, 5030 MWh, 5420 MWh and 4920 MWh, which is 22%, 35%, 45% and 32% higher than the standalone plant, respectively. This performance increase as well as the proportion contributed by the SCO2 cycle and the ORC (see Figure 14) are similar to the results obtained for the design condition (see Figure 9), and therefore the financial (quantified here in terms of the SIC) benefits are also similar to those results, with the best combined system (Combined System 4) attaining a best SIC of as low ~3 $/W, which is &gt;20% lower than the SIC of the standalone SCO2 plant, thus underlining the very significant potential and promise of the hybrid combined systems relative to conventional standalone SCO2 plants.The standalone SCO2 plant generates 3730 MWh of electricity annually, whereas the four combined systems reach 4540 MWh, 5030 MWh, 5420 MWh and 4920 MWh, which is 22%, 35%, 45% and 32% higher than the standalone plant, respectively.

        <p>Hybrid solar and geothermal utilisation can play an important role in the exploitation of renewable energy sources and combined SCO2-ORC systems offer an attractive option for power generation in this context. This paper proposed four configurations of such combined systems, in which: (1) the ORC system only recovers heat rejected from topping SCO2 cycle system (Combined System 1); (2) the ORC system recovers heat available from the geothermal brine after this is used to preheat the SCO2 working fluid and heat from SCO2 cycle system in series (Combined System 2); and (3,4) the ORC system recovers heat from the SCO2 cycle system and also utilises heat from the geothermal brine after this is split into two parallel streams (Combined Systems 3 and 4), in either order.Hybrid solar and geothermal utilisation can play an important role in the exploitation of renewable energy sources and combined SCO2-ORC systems offer an attractive option for power generation in this context.

        <p>A case study was undertaken based on local weather data as well as geothermal conditions relevant to Seville, Spain, considering a standalone SCO2 plant as a baseline for comparison purposes. The influence of the cold tank storage temperature on the performance of the above systems was investigated, and the results revealed that a cold tank storage temperature of 250 °C enables the systems to have a considerably better performance, as this allows the hybrid combined systems to achieve a preferable balance between the power cycle efficiency and the annual solar field thermal efficiency, as well as low costs associated with the heat transfer fluid and thermal storage tanks.A case study was undertaken based on local weather data as well as geothermal conditions relevant to Seville, Spain, considering a standalone SCO2 plant as a baseline for comparison purposes.

        <p>The performance improvements relative to the standalone SCO2 plant offered by the combined systems were evaluated and the results showed that combined systems with splitting geothermal-brine streams are preferable from thermodynamic and economic perspectives. Combined System 3, in which the ORC working fluid is first preheated by one of the split geothermal streams followed, in series, by further heating that utilises heat from the SCO2 cycle system, had a maximum net power output of 2940 kW, which was also 45% higher than that of the standalone plant. When considering the economic performance of these systems, Combined System 4, which is similar Combined System 3 but in which the working-fluid flow direction in the ORC system is reversed such that the working fluid is first preheated by the heat from the SCO2 cycle system and then heated further by geothermal heat, yielded the lowest specific investment cost corresponding to the configuration with the maximum net power output. Specifically, this system was found to have a specific investment cost of 2880 $/kW, which was 22% lower than that of the standalone plant. Since the bottoming ORC system was shown to be economically favourable relative to the SCO2 cycle system operated at higher temperatures and pressures, as indicated by the detailed components cost breakdown across this system, it can be concluded that Combined System 4 is the most attractive amongst those considered here in terms of system cost, given also the relatively large contribution to the overall power output by the ORC system.The performance improvements relative to the standalone SCO2 plant offered by the combined systems were evaluated and the results showed that combined systems with splitting geothermal-brine streams are preferable from thermodynamic and economic perspectives.
