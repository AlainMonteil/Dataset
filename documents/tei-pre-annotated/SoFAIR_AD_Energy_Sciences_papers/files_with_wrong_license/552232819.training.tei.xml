        <p>With the increasing awareness of the global crises of climate change and dwindling fossil resources, upgrading conventional chemical industry which remains heavily reliant on fossil resources is a significant challenge. As the only carbon-containing renewable resource, biomass is considered as one of the most promising candidates to replace unsustainable fossil fuel feedstocks in the production of valuable chemicals [1][2][3][4]. Among these biomass resources, lignin is the main non-carbohydrate component in lignocellulosic biomass and features complex biopolymer structures comprising of natural functional aromatic monomers generally linked by C-O and C-C bonds [5][6][7][8]. Therefore, lignin is deemed as the potential sustainable feedstock to replace fossil fuel resources in the production of valuable aromatic chemicals.</p>
        <p>Currently, the transformation of lignin to valuable aromatic chemicals remains a challenge due to its complex structure [1][2][3][4][5][6]. As shown in Scheme 1, a key problem in the lignin valorization is the effective cleavage of the bonds connecting aromatic units while avoiding dearomatization through hydrogenation of the aromatic rings [6,9]. The C-O bonds, usually represented in the form of β-O-4 linkages, account for over 40% of interunit linkages in lignin structure [3,10,11]. So, the cleavage of these dominant interactions in lignin has been prioritized in methods for lignin depolymerization [6]. However, previous research has been conducted using external hydrogen sources under harsh reaction conditions (e.g. high temperature and high pressure), which can result in dearomatization reactions and undesirable by-products, for example cyclohexanol and benzene (Scheme 1) [1,8,9,11,16]. Furthermore, the external hydrogen donor used in this process is usually high-pressure hydrogen gas or proton derived from alcohols, both of which ultimately originate from fossil fuel resources [8,[13][14][15][16].</p>
        <p>Photocatalytic methods that harness solar energy could be a promising method for selectively cleaving the C-O bonds in lignin model compounds and dioxasolv lignin. For example, a dual light wavelength switching strategy was developed (Pathway 1 in Scheme 1) that can efficiently cleave β-O-4 bonds in lignin model compounds and produce desirable aromatic monomers. This process can be divided into two steps: the oxidation of H-Cα-OH to C=O by Pd-ZnIn2S4 under blue LED light followed by fragmentation and reduction of β-O-4 bonds by TiO2 under UV LED light [17]. Unfortunately, the redundant unused photogenerated electrons or holes had to be consumed by sacrificial agents at each step in order to achieve a high reaction performance. To overcome some of these issues, CdS nanomaterials modified by decorating ultrathin first-row transition metal layer on the surfaces and another zinc indium sulfide photocatalysts were developed that could simultaneously use both photogenerated electrons and holes to efficiently convert lignin model compounds and dioxanesolv poplar lignin to the corresponding aromatic monomers [9,18]. Wu and co-workers developed CdS quantum-dot photocatalysts that could abstract the hydrogen from the hydridic benzylic Cα-H bond and form Cα radical intermediates by photogenerated holes, which decreased the bonding dissociation energy of β-O-4 bonds in lignin model compounds and led to facile fragmentation of β-O-4 bonds to single aromatic products (Pathway 2 in Scheme 1) [5,19]. Moreover, CdS nanoparticles that were surface-modified by Ag + were also reported to have remarkable photocatalytic activity towards the selective cleavage of β-O-4 bonds to yield aromatic monomers following the same mechanism (Pathway 2 in Scheme 1) [20]. Scheme 1. Simplified lignin structure with various linkages and reported pathways of lignin model compound depolymerization</p>
        <p>The fragmentation of the C-O linkage could be considered as a combination of oxidation and hydrogenolysis reaction, and photocatalysis could drive this process by providing photogenerated charge carriers. Therefore, C-O bonds could be efficiently cleaved by tuning the photocatalytic properties of the catalysts. Furthermore, the hydrogen source for C-O bonds hydrogenolysis is traditionally either hydrogen gas or an alcohol originating from fossil resources so is another issue that should be addressed. In previous studies of photocatalytic cleavage in lignin model compounds, the solvent without hydrogen-donating property was commonly used and the lignin model compound acted as hydrogen donor for itself [9,20]. The abstracted hydrogen from lignin model compounds could form a "hydrogen pool" and provide hydrogen for hydrogenolysis after the fragmentation of C-O bonds [9,21]. Thus, sufficient active hydrogen on the surface of photocatalysts is essential to facilitate the hydrogenolysis process of C-O bonds and can lead to a better reaction performance.</p>
        <p>In this work, a zinc indium sulfide (ZIS) compound with controllable zinc and sulfur composition has been developed through a simple, one-step synthesis and is shown to act as a photocatalyst that can efficiently and completely cleave C-O linkages in lignin model compounds and yield single aromatic monomers with a very high selectivity (~90%). The practicality of this catalyst was also examined by evaluating its activity towards "real" lignin biomass, the unprocessed by-product waste of kraft lignin from a local paper industry. It should be noted that this process operates under very mild conditions and also without using H2, alcohols or other unsustainable hydrogen sources. More importantly, based on the results from isotope labelled experiments, water, for the first time, has been proven its potential to be the hydrogen donor for the photocatalytic hydrogenolysis reaction of C-O bonds and is therefore sustainable. The mechanism of C-O bonds fragmentation and the hydrogen transfer route in the hydrogenation process was also investigated in this work. Thus, this study reveals the great potential of photocatalysis in utilization of lignin biomass as the feedstock to produce value-added aromatic chemicals via a green and economic method.</p>
        <p>All the chemical reagents used for the synthesis of catalysts were analytic grade and used as received without further purification. Zn(NO3)2•6H2O (98%), InCl3 (anhydrous, 99.99%), thioacetamide (99%+) and acetonitrile were purchased from Fisher Scientific International, Inc. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, &gt;99%), all photogenerated charged carriers scavengers and radical capture agents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co., Ltd. 2-Phenoxy-1-phenylethanol (PP-ol) and 2phenoxyacetophenone (PP-one) were purchased from Fluorochem Ltd. Kraft lignin was obtained from a local paper factory and processed from corn stalk. Deionized (DI) water was produced using a CENTRA® R200 Centralized Purification and Distribution Systems.</p>
        <p>The synthesis in this work was modified from the ZnIn2S4 nanomaterials synthesis in the literature. [22] A certain amount (x mmol, x=1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6.0, 7.5) of Zn(NO3)2•6H2O, and InCl3 (663.5mg, 3.0 mmol) were dissolved in 50 mL of DI water in a 100 mL beaker, then CTAB (364.5 mg, 1mmol)was added to the solution. Next, the solution was magnetically stirred for 30 min at room temperature before adding thioacetamide (y mmol, y=12, 15,18,21,24). The mixture was poured into a 100 mL stainless Teflonlined autoclave reactor after being stirred for another 30 min, then securely sealed, and placed in an oven heating for 16 h. The heating temperature was 160 °C with a 4 °C/min of heating ramping. After heating, the autoclave was taken out from the oven and naturally cooled down. The yellow sediment at the bottom after centrifugation was collected, then rinsed with 50 mL absolute ethanol and 75% ethanol /water mixture for 5 times respectively. The powder was further dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h.</p>
        <p>Based on the molar ratio of the added precursors of Zn(NO3)2•6H2O in the above reactions, the obtained products were labelled as ZIS-1, ZIS-2, ZIS-3, ZIS-4 and ZIS-5.</p>
        <p>A customized quartz reactor with cooling water jacket was used in this work. The light source used in the experiment was a xenon arc lamp (manufactured by Perfect Light Company) equipped with a PE300BF type light bulb and a 420 nm UV filter. The lamp was set up at a fixed position to ensure the light intensity in different tests were same, which was about 0.35W/cm 2 at the center. Typically, 10mg of catalyst, 10 mg of lignin model compounds (or 100 mg kraft lignin biomass) and 5 mL of solvent (CH3CN or CH3CN/H2O mixture) were added into the reactor. The mixture formed a well-dispersed suspension with the aid of magnetic stirring. After deaeration by nitrogen or other gas (including argon and oxygen), the reactor was tightly sealed and placed under illumination with magnetic stirring at 500 rpm. The temperature was kept at 20 °C with the aid of the cooling water system. After the reaction, the catalyst was removed by centrifugation (10000 rpm for 10 min). Then, 4 mg methylparaben was added into 1 mL supernatant liquid as the internal standard in each test and diluted by a factor of 50 times with acetonitrile. The conversion of lignin model compounds and the yields of aromatic monomer products were identified and quantified by gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry (GC/MS, QP2010 SE, Shimadzu). The following operation parameters were applied to the GC-MS: injection temperature, 280 °C; column temperature program: 80 °C for 2 min, then increasing the temperature to 270 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min, then heat up to 300 °C at a rate of 30 °C/min and holding the temperature for 5 min, The scanning speed of MS is 1000, start from 45 m/z and end at 220 m/z.</p>
        <p>XRD analysis was carried out using a Bruker Phaser-D2 diffractometer with Cu Kα X-ray source at the voltage of 40 kV and current of 40 mA. The morphologies and structures of materials were imaged by scanning electron microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy function (SEM-EDS, Zeiss Sigma VP) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F) respectively. The BET surface area of each material was measured by a Quantachrome IQ sorption analyzer with N2 at 77 K.</p>
        <p>The light absorption property and band gap of each prepared material were analyzed by UV/Vis Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) on a JASCO V-670 spectrophotometer equipped with an integration sphere in the spectral range of 200-900 nm and BaSO4 was used as the reflectance standard. The chemical states of each element in prepared samples and X-ray photoelectron valence band spectra (XPS-VB) were characterized on an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ThermoFisher K-Alpha) with an Al Kα X-ray source. The composition of each prepared catalysts was determined by EDS and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Varian Vista Pro). The photocurrent response spectroscopy measurements were carried out at a constant potential of 0.2 V to the working electrode and a 300W Xe lamp with a UV filter which was also used as the light source during the experiments.</p>
        <p>Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was first used to determine the elemental compositions of all samples. As shown in Table 1, the ratio of In/Zn and S/Zn in ZIS-1 are very close to the atomic ratio of each element in pristine ZnIn2S4, and it is clear that the composition of indium and sulfide decreased with the increasing the amount of zinc and sulfide precursors added in catalyst synthesizing stage. These results indicate that the additional zinc and sulfide have been successfully introduced into the synthesized materials.</p>
        <p>The crystal structures and phases of the prepared materials in this study were determined by XRD analysis. As shown in Figure 1, the distinct peaks of ZIS-1 at about 21.6°, 27.7°, 30.4° and 47.2° correspond well to the diffraction of the (006), (102), ( 104) and (110) crystal planes in the standard hexagonal Zinc Indium Sulfide crystals (JCPDS 03-065-2023), indicating that zinc indium sulfide was successfully synthesized [22,23]. These peaks are also seen in the samples containing higher zinc and indium sulfur compositions, which is consistent with the XRD pattern of zinc and sulfur rich phase of zinc indium sulfide previously reported [24,25]. The peak (006) shifts to the lower degree has also been reported due to the use of CTAB as the surfactant in synthesis process [22,25,26]. The additional zinc and sulfur contents in zinc indium sulfide generally form atomic layer structures arranging in a repeated sequence of S-Zn-S-In-S-Zn-S along the c-axis [24]. In addition, with the assistance of CTAB surfactant and hydrothermal synthetic process, the crystal of zinc indium sulfide grew up in a 2D structure, which resulting in the peaks at 39.8°, 45.7°, and 52.2° from the XRD pattern of standard zinc indium sulfide are not discernible in all prepared samples [22,26,27]. The formation of 2D flexible layer-structure in</p>
        <p>In/Zn(atomic%) samples has been reported previously to be favorable for photocatalytic activity by enhancing the separation of photoexcited electron-hole pairs [27]. Furthermore, with increasing amounts of zinc and sulfur precursors during synthesis stage, new peaks located at 28.55°, 47.51° and 56.29° are seen in the XRD patterns of ZIS-3, ZIS-4 and ZIS-5, which are indexed to the diffraction of the ( 111), ( 220) and</p>
        <p>(311) crystal planes from the standard cubic ZnS crystals (JCPDS 00-005-0566). These results indicate that the additional zinc ions have reacted with the sulfur from excess thioacetamide to form zinc sulfide;</p>
        <p>the intensity of the peaks corresponding to ZnS became significantly higher and sharper with increasing the amount of zinc and sulfur precursors during the synthesis. In contrast, the diffraction peaks associating with the ZnS can be barely seen in ZIS-2, even though the ICP-OES analysis indicated higher zinc and sulfur composition in ZIS-2 than in the stoichiometric ZnIn2S4. Also, no obvious shift of peaks in XRD pattern could be observed with increasing zinc and sulfur composition from ZIS-1 to ZIS-5, which indicates that zinc or sulfur are not dopants in these samples. Thus, it is likely that the additional zinc and sulfur form a zinc and sulfur rich phase of zinc indium sulfide, and ZnS in sample ZIS-3, 4, 5 were formed by excess zinc and sulfur. As shown in Figure 2(g) and (h), zinc, indium, and sulfur are dispersed very uniformly on the hydrangea-like microsphere area whereas the signal intensity of indium is very weak on the solid microsphere. Selected small areas on the hydrangea-like microsphere part of samples and solid microsphere part of samples were selected to be characterized by SEM-EDS respectively (Table 2), which reveals that the Zn/S ratio on the solid microspheres is very close to 1 along with very low In/S ratio, which further supports the presence of ZnS [23]. It should be noted that the elemental ratio of Zn,</p>
        <p>In and S on the petal of zinc indium sulfide also varied from around 1:2:4 in ZIS-1 and to around 1:1.2:2.5 in ZIS-3,4,5 even though these samples contain higher zinc and sulfur composition. These data indicate that there is a saturated concentration for additional zinc and sulfur composition in the zinc indium sulfide structures using the current synthetic method and that excess zinc and sulfur will form solid microspheres of ZnS instead of forming zinc and sulfur rich phases of zinc indium sulfide. The XPS survey spectra and high-resolution XPS spectra for each element confirm that zinc, indium and sulfur coexist in each sample. For pristine ZnIn2S4 in ZIS-1, the binding energies of Zn 2p, In 3d and S 2p peaks are very close to those reported in the literature [30]. The S 2p peak in the XPS spectra of ZIS-2, 3 ,4 and 5 were deconvoluted into two sets of peaks, suggesting that S 2-in these samples are in different chemical environments, most likely ZnS and zinc indium sulfide [31]. In addition, negative shifts of peaks are observed for every element with increasing zinc composition from ZIS-1 to ZIS-3. pore size distribution curves of ZIS samples Specific surface area and pore structure are also critical factors greatly affecting the catalytic property of catalysts. As shown in Figure 4, the isotherms for all samples could be identified as type IV with hysteresis loops, suggesting the presence of well-structured mesopores in the samples [32,33]. With increasing of zinc and sulfur components in the materials, the BET surface area of samples ZIS-1, 2 ,3 gradually increased from 40.082 m 2 /g to 60.963 m 2 /g, which could provide more active sites and improve the catalytic activity during the reaction. However, it should be noticed that further increasing the zinc and sulfur composition in the samples had no obvious effect on the specific surface area after ZIS-3, maybe owing to the competition between the formation of ZnIn2S4 and ZnS during the single-</p>
        <p>pot hydrothermal synthesizing process [33]. Also, the main pore sizes of the synthesized zinc indium sulfides are all in a range of 3-5 nm, which is similar to the literatures [33,34].</p>
        <p>As the main C-O form in lignin, the light-driven β-O-4 bond cleavage was tested by all catalysts in this study. 2-phenoxy-1-phenylethanol (PP-ol) was employed as the lignin model compound to evaluate catalytic performance due to its signature Cβ-O structure and its ready comparison to previously published works [9,15,18,20,21,[35][36][37]. The results of first 2 entries in Table 3 reveal that PP-ol can barely be converted or decomposed without catalyst under visible light irradiation or with catalyst under dark conditions. When pristine ZnIn2S4 (ZIS-1) was used as the photocatalyst, 88.1% of PP-ol was converted with 34.5% of reacted PP-ol oxidized to the undesirable by-product 2-phenoxyacetophenone (PP-one) instead of single aromatic products. Upon increasing of the zinc and sulfur composition, the photocatalytic reaction performance and selectivity could be improved remarkably as shown in Figure The reaction kinetics of ZIS-3 were also evaluated (As shown in Figure 5(c)). Within the first 15 min of illumination, almost half of PP-ol was converted with 90% selectivity for the desired single aromatic products (Acetophenone and Phenol). As the reaction was conducted in a batch reactor system, the reaction rate decreased gradually because of the decreasing concentration of reactant, and full conversion of PP-ol was achieved after only 90 min of illumination. The selectivity of single aromatic products was maintained over 90% while the transformation to PP-one was remained at a relatively low level during the entire reaction process. Comparing this result with entries 7 and 8 in Table 3, it is clear that the reaction mechanism is different to that reported in the literature. In the latter cases, PP-ol is oxidized to the ketone PP-one which then decomposes to single aromatic monomers, whereas for ZIS-3 in this study, PP-ol is converted to acetophenone and phenol without PP-one as an intermediate product; instead, the conversion of PP-ol to PP-one is a side-reaction which has a negative effect to the targeted C-O bond fragment in this study [38,39]. Additionally, it is very critical for a heterogeneous catalyst to have a good reusability for practical applications. In this study, the heterogeneous catalysts ZIS-3 could be straightforwardly separated after the reaction by filtration or centrifuge. After washing by ethanol and water to remove residual adsorbed chemicals on the surface of catalysts and drying under vacuum, over 85% amount of the catalyst could be collected for reuse. The recycling experiment of ZIS-3 catalyst was studied for 5 cycle times under identical reaction conditions, with no obvious drop of catalytic performance including conversion rate of PP-ol and the selectivity for aromatic monomers (Figure 5(d)). Furthermore, the recycled catalysts were characterized by XRD and ICP-OES and no clear differences were observed from the characterization of pristine ZIS-3 (Figure S4 and Table S1 in Supplement).</p>
        <p>It has been also found that the reaction atmosphere is also an important parameter which can significantly influence the PP-ol conversion. The results of entry 3 and 4 in Table 3 show that completely conversion of PP-ol with high selectivity towards single aromatic monomers can be achieved when the reactions were performed under inert gas atmosphere (nitrogen and argon). However, the reaction performance decreased dramatically when the reactions were carried out under air or pure oxygen, with the oxidation of PP-ol to PP-one significantly promoted and the desired C-O bonds fragmentation reaction suppressed to less than 10% (entry 5 and 6 in Table 3). Besides the oxidative role of oxygen, another possible reason could also be that oxygen can capture the photoexcited protons and photogenerated electrons thus suppressed the fragment of C-O bonds and decreased the photocatalytic performance [9,40]. These results recommend that this reaction should be performed in an anaerobic environment to avoid undesired oxidative transformation of PP-ol to its corresponding ketone PP-one.</p>
        <p>While previous studies used hydrogen gas or alcohol as hydrogen donors in the reaction, in this work, water was employed as a sustainable hydrogen source [1,16,41]. Different amounts of water were introduced into the reaction system to investigate the effect of water to the reaction (entry 9-13 in Table 3). Increasing the water/acetonitrile ratio from 0 to 3:2 resulted in an increase in the conversion of PP-ol from 63.8% to almost 100% along with an increase in the selectivity of desired aromatic monomer from about 30% to over 90%; additionally, the selectivity of by-product of PP-one decreased from 53.1% to 8.2%. These results clearly show that the pronounced promotion effects of water on the PP-ol conversion to corresponding aromatic monomers. However, the presence of excess water in the reaction system has a negative effect due to the low solubility of lignin model compounds in water (entry 13) [9,18]. Ethanol was also tested as the hydrogen donor, but in contrast with the previous works, it is found that the reaction performance deteriorated when ethanol was used (entry 14 in Table 3) [9]. A potential reason could be that ethanol can also act as a scavenger for photogenerated holes and therefore suppressed the photochemical reaction. Moreover, it has been reported that the great solubility of PPol and PP-one in the mixture of CH3CN and ethanol could also increase the selectivity for PP-one [18].</p>
        <p>After testing with different lignin model compounds, ZIS-3 catalyst was further applied to catalyze the fragmentation of kraft lignin under visible light. The products in the solution were analyzed and identified by a GC-MS and a controlled experiment without catalysts was also conducted under same condition for comparation (Figure S5 in Supplement). After 16 h of illumination, the differences between the reaction with catalysts and without catalysts are clear: the quantities of various aromatic monomers are significantly increased with catalyzing by ZIS-3. This result implies that the photocatalysts developed in this study could be deployable for lignin valorization through its conversion into valuable aromatic monomers.</p>
        <p>To further understand the reaction mechanism of C-O fragmentation in the reactions, a series of control experiments were performed. In order to investigate the mechanism of photogenerated charge carriers in the reactions, hole scavengers (Na2S and Na2SO3) and an electron scavenger (Na2S2O8) were respectively introduced to the reaction system and the results were shown as entry 1 and 2 in Table 4.</p>
        <p>The hole scavenger almost halved the conversion of PP-ol and extremely suppressed the formation of PP-one due to the effect of the scavenging of photogenerated holes. This result agrees with previous studies and indicates that the photogenerated hole can oxidize PP-ol to PP-one, and transform PP-ol to radical intermediates which are essential for the following C-O bond fragmentation [9,18,20]. In contrast, the reaction with added electron scavenger could still convert almost 100% of PP-ol but with an obvious decrease in the selectivity for the desired aromatic monomers, suggesting that the photogenerated electrons are important to the C-O bonds fragmentation and the following hydrogenolysis process [5,9,20]. Also, when the photogenerated holes and electrons were consumed by corresponding scavengers, more photogenerated electrons or holes could escape from the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, which respectively results in decreasing or increasing the PP-one yield. These phenomena reveal that both photogenerated electrons and holes were participating in the reaction. Moreover, previous literature has determined that water can also interact with the photocatalysts and form hydroxyl radicals which are highly oxidative [43]. Thus, D-mannitol was employed as a hydroxyl radical scavenger to evaluate the effect of hydroxyl radicals in this reaction.</p>
        <p>As shown in Entry 3 in Table 4, the result shows that the quenching of hydroxyl radicals had negligible influence on reaction performance, which agrees with previous works claimed that the photogenerated holes probably can directly interact with PP-ol adsorbed on the surface of photocatalysts [20,[42][43][44].</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, it has also been reported that hydroxyl radicals can oxidize the abstract hydrogen from benzyl alcohol, so the possibility that the hydroxyl radicals may also react with PP-ol and form radical intermediate cannot be ruled out [45]. Reaction condition: 10 mg of PP-ol, 10 mg of catalyst, 5 mL of solvent (CH3CN:H2O = 2:3), visible light irradiation (0.35 W/cm 2 ), room temperature (20-25 °C), 90min. The hole scavengers used were 20 mg Na2S and 10 mg Na2SO3; the electron scavenger used was 30 mg Na2S2O8; •OH* scavenger used was 50mg of D-mannitol; the radical scavenger used was 30 mg 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO). The quantitative analysis of each chemical was determined by GC-MS with methylparaben as the internal standard.</p>
        <p>The light absorption and energy band positions have always been considered as the key factors in photocatalysis. As shown in diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy (DRS) plots (Figure 6(a,b)), the adsorption edges of samples with higher zinc and sulfur components shift to a shorter wavelength. This blue-shift of absorption could be attributed to the existence of ZnS which has a wide band gap (around 3.5eV) [46]. It should be noted that the most efficient catalyst, ZIS-3, still has a strong light adsorption in visible light region while ZIS-4 and ZIS-5 show a clear decrease of adsorption in the visible region, which can perhaps explain the decrease in catalytic performance of ZIS-4 and ZIS-5. To further understand the relationship between the photocatalytic reaction performance and composition of catalysts, the band edge positions of each sample were determined by a combined analysis of modified Kubelka-Munk plot and XPS-VB spectra and summarized in Table 5. The band gap of the catalysts increased from 2.23eV to 2.62eV while the valence band maximum (VBM) increased from 1.54 eV to 1.85 eV upon increasing of zinc and sulfur components, thus, the conduction band maximum (CBM) could be calculated based on the formula of ECB = EVB -EBandgap, and varies from -0.69 eV to -0.81 eV [47]. Generally, a more positive VB represents a stronger oxidization property while a more negative CB represents a better reduction ability [21]. In this study, it has been confirmed that the C-O cleavage process involves both oxidation and reduction reactions driven by photogenerated holes and electrons respectively. Also, increased amounts of zinc and sulfur components in the catalysts significantly affected the band edge alignment of samples, therefore, directly impacted upon the catalytic performance. Compared with the other ZIS samples, ZIS-3 is the most efficient photocatalyst and exhibits an appropriate band gap for visible light excitation and optimized VBM and CBM edges, which leads to better photocatalytic activity with excitation by visible light [20]. Since both photogenerated electrons and holes have been proven to be important to this reaction, the transient photocurrent response of each sample was examined to evaluate the efficiency of photoexcited electron/hole generation and transportation. Although ZIS-1 (pristine ZnIn2S4) has the lowest band gap, all of the modified materials with additional zinc and sulfide components display higher photocurrent responses (Figure 6(c)), which shows that the rich zinc and sulfur composition in ZIS-2~5 can efficiently enhance the migration of photo-charge carriers and inhibit the recombination of photoexcited electron-hole pairs [30]. As expected, ZIS-3 with the highest catalytic activity in this study also shows the highest photocurrent under visible light illumination, further revealing that it can provide a greater amount of effective photoinduced charge carriers and facilitate the C-O bond cleavage [30,48]. The significant decrease in photocurrent response from ZIS-4 to ZIS-5 could be attributed to the wide band gap. In this study, it has been confirmed that properly increasing water content in the reaction system can significantly improve the reaction performance. To further understand the C-O bond hydrogenolysis process in the reaction, H2O in the reaction was replaced by deuterated water (D2O) and GC-MS was used to track deuterium and monitor hydrogen transfer during the reaction (the detailed MS spectra can be seen in Supplement). As shown in entry 1 of Scheme 2, no hydrogen/deuterium exchange between D2O, acetophenone (120 m/z) and phenol (94 m/z) could be observed under this mild reaction conditions (Figure S6). Entry 2 confirms that the solvent acetonitrile without hydrogen-donating ability does not provide hydrogen equivalents in this reaction (Figure S6) [9,49]. Finally, entry 3 shows that deuterated acetophenone (121 m/z) arises from the reaction with the deuterium label located at its methyl group based on MS spectrum, which clearly indicates that water was the origin for the Cβ hydrogenation reaction after Cβ-O bond cleavage (Figure S7, the peak at 43 m/z and 44 m/z are attributed to the summary of O=C-CH3(CH2D): 16+12+12+3(4)=43/44 (m/z); and the peak at 28 m/z and 27 m/z are attributed to the summary of C-CH3(CH2D): 12+12+3(4)=27/28 (m/z).) [50]. Moreover, it should be noticed that the hydrogen in the hydroxyl group of phenol is not deuterium after C-O cleavage and hydrogenation. Since PP-ol itself was the only hydrogen (H) source in this case, this result also domonstrates that a self-hydrogen transfer process in the reaction occurs, which is in line with previously reported work [9].</p>
        <p>Kinetic isotope effect (KIE) experiments were performed with D2O to probe the participation of water in this reaction and show that the reaction rate is reduced significantly when D2O was present and a normal KIE value of k(H2O)/k(D2O) ≈1.52 was obtained (Figure S8 in Supplement). These results indicate that the water is directly involved in this reaction and that the kinetics of hydrogenation using H2O was faster than that of D2O [50][51][52]. In contrast to the normal KIE result in this study, the hydrogenation of an sp 2 C to an sp 3 C has been reported to have an inverse KIE [53][54][55]. Therefore, the normal KIE result could be caused by faster O-H cleavage of H2O, suggesting that the dissociation of O-H bond of water which provides proton to C-O bond hydrogenolysis process could be a critical step to this reaction [50,51,56]. the Cα-OH is oxidized firstly to the ketone Cα=O followed by decomposition to corresponding aromatic monomers with the assistance of photogenerated electrons [18,39]. This is evident, when PP-one is detected as an intermediate product which then decomposes to acetophenone and phenol. In these cases, the bond dissociation energy (BDE) of target Cβ-O bonds can be reduced by the transformation of C-OH to C=O based on the theoretical calculations [37][38][39]. In contrast, the oxidative transformation of PP-ol to PP-one in this study is a side reaction as no conversion to aromatic monomers is seen when PP-one is used as reactant under catalytic conditions. An alternative mechanism in literature describes that the hydroxyl group or hydrogen on Cα is firstly oxidized by photogenerated holes via hydrogenatom abstraction (HAA) process to form a radical which subsequently undergoes Cβ-O bond cleavage and decomposition to the aromatic monomers with very high selectivity through reduction by photogenerated electrons [19][20][21]37]. In this study, it was seen that the introduction of 5,5-dimethyl-1pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as a radial scavenger (Entry 4, Table 4) caused the conversion of PP-ol to be significantly suppressed along with a reduction in the selectivity for phenol and acetophenone. This oxidation process [9,10,21,59,60]. Based on the result of quenching experiments that the conversion of PP-ol significantly decreased with hole scavengers and radical scavengers in the reaction system, step 1 is very important to the following C-O bond fragmentation. However, the oxidation of PP-ol to byproduct PP-one is a competing side reaction as PP-one cannot be converted to aromatic monomers. In this work, it is found that this competing side reaction is driven by photogenerated holes and can be suppressed by increasing water content in the reaction system. It is because water can consume redundant photogenerated holes thus suppresses the formation of ketone (C=O) [62]. In addition, it is reported that oxidization of water by photogenerated holes can generate protons for the following hydrogenation in step 2 [50,56,62,63]. Subsequently, the fragmentation and hydrogenolysis of Cβ-O bonds in the radical intermediates can occur with the assistance of photogenerated electrons (step 2).</p>
        <p>During the hydrogenolysis of C-O bonds, it should be noted that acetophenone could be eventually formed through hydrogenation with the hydrogen derived from water. Simultaneously, the residual hydrogen from either Cα-OH or Cα-H in radical intermediates could be abstracted, then couple with the oxygen of phenoxy radical and form the hydroxyl group of phenol [9]. In summary, this study indicates that hydrogen derived from water can participate the hydrogenolysis of C-O bonds via photocatalysis and introducing water in the reaction system can promote the cleavage of C-O bonds in lignin model compound.</p>
        <p>In this work, a series of zinc indium sulfide (ZIS) photocatalysts with controllable compositions have been successfully fabricated via a simple one-pot hydrothermal synthesis method. The characterization results show that the rich composition of zinc and sulfur in ZIS can boost the separation of photo-charge carriers and improve the oxidation and reduction properties. Among these, ZIS-3 which contains an optimized zinc and sulfur ratio exhibited a significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance for converting lignin model compounds and lignin biomass to valuable aromatic monomers by selectively cleaving C-O linkages between aromatic units under visible light irradiation. Also, different from previous studies in this area which required hydrogen gas, alcohols or other hydrogen sources still based on fossil feedstocks, water was used as a sustainable hydrogen origin in this work and can promote both conversion rate and selectivity for producing aromatic monomers. The mechanism studies of lignin model compound depolymerization reveal that radical intermediates are firstly formed by photo-oxidation and followed by the hydrogenolysis of C-O bonds with hydrogen derived from water eventually transferred to the methyl group of single aromatic products. In summary, this study offers a great potential solution for valorization of abundant lignin biomass with sustainable hydrogen donor of water.</p>
