        <p>Molten salts are popular energy storage materials for medium-and high-temperature thermal energy storage. However, current methods for heat transfer enhancement do not apply due to the high corrosivity of molten salts and extreme high-temperature environment. Herein, porous silicon carbide (SiC) ceramic and solar salt are formed into a composite phase change material (PCM). The ceramic skeleton is fabricated to an open-cell structure with high porosity and a large pore configuration. The SiC ceramic is wetted by the solar salt, so that the impregnation of salt into ceramic achieves a high loading at atmospheric pressure. The result of visual inspection shows that the temperature distribution in the composite PCM is more uniform compared with pure solar salt. The maximum temperature difference is reduced from 148℃ to 130℃ and the overall phase change rate is increased by up to 42.9%. The SiC ceramics show excellent corrosion resistance during the cycles of thermal charging and discharging as compared to copper and aluminium which are the widely used thermal promoters for lowtemperature PCMs. The results obtained from reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulation are consistent with the corrosion behaviours of SiC ceramic in solar salt from the aspects of physical dissolution, chemical reaction, and thermal stress failure. The composite PCM has advantages of simple preparation, low cost, and easy maintenance, therefore it has a great potential for large-scale applications.Molten salts are popular energy storage materials for medium-and high-temperature thermal energy storage.

        <p>The thermal energy storage (TES) technique solves the mismatch between energy supply and demand by storing surplus thermal energy in phase change materials (PCMs) and releasing it when needed [1,2]. According to the melting point of PCMs, TES is classified as lowtemperature (melting point &lt; 100℃), medium-temperature (melting point 100℃ ~ 300℃) and high-temperature (melting point &gt; 300℃) ones [3]. Molten salts have been widely used as medium-and high-temperature energy storage materials due to their appropriate melting point, large energy storage density, low cost, excellent thermal stability, low vapour pressure, etc [4][5][6]. They have considerable application values in concentrated solar power [7], industrial waste heat recovery [8] and peak shaving of power grid [9]. However, pure salts commonly suffer from low thermal conductivity, for example, the thermal conductivity of KNO3 is only around 0.5 W/m K [10], which limits the energy storage efficiency.The thermal energy storage (TES) technique solves the mismatch between energy supply and demand by storing surplus thermal energy in phase change materials (PCMs) and releasing it when needed [1,2].

        <p>For low-temperature PCMs, there are many heat transfer enhancement methods such as adding fins [11,12], metal foams [13][14][15], etc. However, for the medium-and high-temperature PCMs, these methods may be not applicable. It is not only because some thermal promoters will soften even decompose due to the extreme high-temperature environment; but also because they may be incompatible with molten salt due to the high corrosivity of salts. Moreover, the thermal promoter must be low-cost so the TES technique is economically feasible.For low-temperature PCMs, there are many heat transfer enhancement methods such as adding fins [11,12], metal foams [13][14][15], etc. However, for the medium-and high-temperature PCMs, these methods may be not applicable.

        <p>Ceramics have inherently high thermal conductivity, superior corrosion resistance and low cost [16][17][18][19]. Some researchers have used ceramic and molten salt to prepare shape-stabilised phase change materials (ss-PCMs) [20,21]. The pore size of ss-PCMs is in the magnitude of micron and nanometer [22,23]. Ss-PCMs are commonly used to prevent leakage by restricting the flow of liquid salt through capillary force and surface tension. However, the porosity of ss-PCMs is only about 0.6 or less [22,24], which means the energy storage density is low.Ceramics have inherently high thermal conductivity, superior corrosion resistance and low cost [16][17][18][19].

        <p>Moreover, the micro-and nano-pores exert strong restrictions on the fluid flow and the natural convection heat transfer is almost eliminated. Additionally, once the skeleton and PCM are integrated together, it is very difficult to separate them. If the skeleton or salt fails, the whole ss-PCM needs to be replaced, rather than only maintaining the single skeleton or salt, which increases the maintenance cost. It is desirable to design a new ceramic-based PCM with a large porosity and open cells to address the energy density, heat transfer and maintenance issues.Moreover, the micro-and nano-pores exert strong restrictions on the fluid flow and the natural convection heat transfer is almost eliminated.

        <p>Phase change heat transfer is of fundamental importance for determining thermal-fluidic behaviours of PCMs and evaluating TES system performance. Some researchers have carried out experimental and numerical studies on the phase change heat transfer of porous composite PCMs [25][26][27][28]. The main mechanisms in phase change heat transfer are heat conduction and natural convection. Through making full use of natural convection, the better comprehensive performance of the TES unit can be achieved with a high-porosity skeleton [29]. However, current studies mainly focus on low-temperature PCMs. Paraffin (melting point: 26℃-68℃ [30,31]) and metal foams are the most used PCM and porous support respectively in the current researches [2]. Heat transfer characteristics of molten salt with porous ceramic skeleton are rarely reported, especially the visualised investigations. Additionally, corrosion is a key issue of molten salt-based PCM [32]. It is essential to test the compatibility between the ceramic skeleton and molten salt to ensure the durability of the thermal promoter.Phase change heat transfer is of fundamental importance for determining thermal-fluidic behaviours of PCMs and evaluating TES system performance.

        <p>In this paper, a novel ceramic/solar salt (60wt% NaNO3 + 40wt% KNO3) porous composite phase change material was prepared. The composite PCMs are open-cell and the pore size is 10 PPI, 15 PPI and 20 PPI. This pore configuration allows the fluid flow and benefits the natural convection. The porosity is high, up to 0.85, which guarantees the energy storage density. Moreover, the porous skeleton can be easily integrated with and extracted from solar salt, which enables maintaining the single salt and skeleton. Visualised experiments were conducted to investigate the phase change heat transfer characteristics including temperature evolution, melting fraction, solid-liquid phase interface and temperature field. Corrosion behaviours of ceramic in the presence of solar salt were analysed using various characterising techniques, namely scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman. Additionally, in order to provide microscopic insights into corrosion behaviours of ceramic, a reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed.

        <p>The wettability of the ceramic was tested by dropping the molten solar salt drop on the ceramic substrate. The bulk ceramic was sintered and was cut into a 5 cm × 5 cm × 2 cm piece (mass: 116.4g). Then it was placed on a copper plate heater. The temperature of the cooper heater was kept at 300 ℃ which was higher than the liquidus temperature of solar salt (246 ℃). This setup ensured that the solar salt on the ceramic substrate was liquid. The solar salt in a beaker was heated to melt. Then a straw was used to suck up the liquid salt. Next, the liquid salt was dropped on the ceramic substrate. As Figures 1(b)-(e) show, the salt drop infiltrates into the ceramic substrate easily, indicating the ceramic has excellent wettability to solar salt. This is very important for integrating PCM with the skeleton. The vacuum impregnation is usually employed to integrate low-temperature PCMs with the porous skeleton to improve the loading [2]. However, for molten salts, it is difficult to obtain the vacuum along with the hightemperature condition; and the equipment cost will be increased greatly. The excellent wettability of ceramic enables the atmospheric impregnation to achieve a high loading so that the impregnation process is cost-effective.The wettability of the ceramic was tested by dropping the molten solar salt drop on the ceramic substrate.

        <p>The ReaxFF force field developed by Newsome et al. [39] was adopted in this study. The system was first heated to 300℃ and maintained for 1ns; then it was cooled to 150℃. Finally, the system was kept at 150℃ for 1ns. The heating/cooling was carried out 50, 100, 150 and up to 200 times to reproduce the charging/discharging procedure. The damping parameter which determines how rapidly the temperature was relaxed was set as 100 fs. And the temperature of composites is obviously higher than that of pure salt because in composite PCMs, the heat can be quickly transferred from the heating wall to the interior. The temperature difference between points P1 and P3 is presented in Figure 2(d). The temperature difference reflects the uniformity of the temperature distribution. The maximum temperature difference in pure solar salt can reach up to 148℃, while in composites, it can be reduced to 130℃. Moreover, in most stages of melting, the temperature difference of composites is obviously lower than that of pure salt. The temperature difference curves of composites PCMs do not follow the order 10 PPI &gt; 15 PPI &gt; 20 PPI or 10 PPI &lt; 15 PPI &lt; 20 PPI. It may be attributed to the contrary effects of the pore size. On the one hand, the large pore benefits the fluid flow and enhances the natural convection; on the other hand, the large pore means less contact area of the skeleton with PCM, which harms transferring heat from the skeleton to PCM.The ReaxFF force field developed by Newsome et al.

        <p>These two roles are contrary. Therefore, the variation of temperature difference curves is not consistent with the trend of the pore sizes. To make clear the contribution of heat conduction and natural convection to the phase change heat transfer, a representative elementary volume (REV)-scale simulation was performed.

        <p>The simulated solid-liquid phase interface at t = 3600s is presented in Figure 2(f). When only heat conduction is considered, the solid-liquid interface is always parallel to the heating wall, as the top two figures show. When both heat conduction and natural convection are considered, the solid-liquid interface is obviously curved and the melting rate of PCM in the upper portion is faster than that in the lower portion. This is because the hot liquid PCM is driven by the buoyancy force and flows upwards along the heating wall; it accumulates in the upper portion and accelerates the melting [2].The simulated solid-liquid phase interface at t = 3600s is presented in Figure 2(f).

        <p>For the only heat conduction case, the liquid fraction of the pure salt is 0.14 while that of the ceramic/salt composite is 0.30. It suggests that the ceramic skeleton enhances heat conduction significantly. When natural convection is considered, the liquid fraction of the pure salt is 0.26 while that of the ceramic/salt composite is 0.41. In terms of the pure salt, the contribution of heat conduction to melting is 53.8%; by contrast, for the ceramic/salt composite, the value is 73.2%. The contribution of heat conduction is obviously increased. And due to the large pore configuration, the solid-liquid interface of the ceramic/salt composite is still curved, suggesting that the natural convection is not restricted seriously. As a result, the overall heat transfer is enhanced. interface is curved and the temperature of the top region is higher. This is due to the natural convection: the hot liquid salt flows upwards driven by the buoyancy force and downwards along the solid-liquid interface, forming a circulatory region; thermal energy in hot liquid PCM is released during the downwards flow process and more energy is absorbed by the upper part of the interface; as a result, the melting rate of the upper region is higher and the solid-liquid interface is sloped [44].For the only heat conduction case, the liquid fraction of the pure salt is 0.14 while that of the ceramic/salt composite is 0.30.

        <p>Moreover, the heat can be efficiently transferred to the inside. The temperature field is more uniform and the temperature difference is decreased. This is very important because it can avoid local overheating and mitigate thermal stress fatigue failure, which will extend the life cycle of the equipment. the Raman scattering mainly occurs at shifts = 786 cm -1 and 964 cm -1 , which corresponds to the transverse optical and longitudinal optical of SiC [47]. Some weak Raman bands are found at 147 cm -1 and 766 cm -1 , which may be associated with disorder crystals and impurities [48].Moreover, the heat can be efficiently transferred to the inside.

        <p>Cu and Althe widely used thermal promoters in low-temperature PCMsare also tested and the results are shown in Figure 4(e). After 50 cycles, the surface of Al and Cu pieces becomes dull. As the cycle number increases, the metal is corroded more seriously. In contrast, the surface of the ceramic remains almost unchanged. It can be concluded from the above results that the ceramic exhibits excellent anti-corrosion performance. species do not physically dissolve into the salt. It may be attributed to the fact that SiC is a covalent network compound [49] and the bonding energy is very high, up to 135 kcal/mol [50].Cu and Althe widely used thermal promoters in low-temperature PCMsare also tested and the results are shown in Figure 4(e).

        <p>shows the shear stress (τxy) field of the SiC surface during the cooling process. It is seen that the stress field does not change significantly when the temperature decreases from 300℃ to 220℃ and ultimately to 150℃. It may be attributed to the excellent thermal conduction of SiC [55]. Heat can be efficiently transferred from the surface to the inner material and the temperature difference between the surface and core is small, which will not generate a large stress gradient. Moreover, the coefficient of thermal expansion of SiC is only 3.69×10 -6 /℃ (150 ℃) [56], which further weakens the influence of thermal stress. A snapshot of SiC after 200 cycles is presented in Figure 6(f). Although some atoms slightly deviate from the initial lattice point, there are no dislocations and defects forming in SiC, which indicates the stable structure of SiC.shows the shear stress (τxy) field of the SiC surface during the cooling process.
