        <p>In this study, a comparative study was conducted on the three reactor types (the adiabatic, water-cooled and gas-cooled reactor) employed for the traditional syngas to methanol (STM) process to investigate their potential applications to the STM process with the CO 2 -rich feed gas or the CO 2 hydrogenation to methanol (CTM) process. The temperature profiles in the axial and radial directions particularly the hot-spot temperatures, operating conditions and methanol yields for the reactors have been investigated using the thermodynamic analysis, the CFD method and the pseudo-homogeneous model. The capital costs for CTM process with the three reactor types have also been evaluated. Compared with the traditional STM process, the STM process with the CO 2 -rich feed gas and CTM process exhibited reduced hot-spot temperatures. The simulation results showed that the single-bed adiabatic (without internal cooling) reactor and the gas-cooled reactor exhibited potentials for the CTM process, where the hot-spot temperatures the hot-spot temperatures in the reactors can be within the typical operating temperature range (e.g., 220-280 • C) for the catalyst. Regarding the comparison of the three reactor types for the CTM process, the water-cooled</p>

        <p>The hydrogenative chemical recycling of CO 2 from natural or industrial sources has attracted significant attention in recent years as a possible route to reducing CO 2 emissions, where H 2 can be produced by water electrolysis with renewable energy sources [1,2]. Particularly, it is a crucial step for the concept of the "methanol economy" where methanol can be used as fuel and a raw material for the products conventionally derived from fossil fuels [3].</p>
        <p>Nowadays, the route via CO 2 hydrogenation to methanol (CTM) is being discussed globally in the aspects of technology and economy [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11].</p>
        <p>From the technology point of view, the CTM process is considered in technology readiness levels (TRLs) 6-7 [8], which are developed based on the mature technology of the syngas (CO is the main carbon source) to methanol (STM) process using gas-phase catalytic fixed-bed reactors. Conversely, other potential methods, e.g., electrochemical and photochemical methods [12,13], the membrane reactor [14], and the slurry phase reactor [15], are at the research stage. The traditional CTM process is typically operated at pressures of 50-100 bar and temperatures of 200-300 • C, and it involves the hydrogenation of CO and CO 2 and reverse watergas shift (RWGS) reactions:</p>
        <p>Compared with the conventional exothermic STM process, the CTM process generates less reaction heat from the reaction (2), and the endothermic side-reaction (3) can weaken the heat release of the process. Additionally, water is formed as a by-product in the CTM process which has a detrimental effect on the conventional copper-based catalyst and results in the deactivation of the catalyst [16]. The problem can be addressed through a two-step process, including the RWGS process and methanol synthesis process. Moreover, the by-product (water) formed in the RWGS process can be removed before the latter process, which is also referred to as the CAMERE process (carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol via reverse water-gas shift) [17]. Additionally, the applications of novel membrane reactors and sorption-enhanced reaction processes can be a potential method for removing the by-product (water) for a one-step CTM or CAMERE process [18,19,20,21], which is at the laboratory level. Compared with the CAMERE process, the one-step CTM process has a less complex system and only requires the methanol synthesis component (typically requires one or two methanol synthesis reactors). The present study focused on the reactor designs for the one-step CTM process (hereinafter referred to as the CTM process). Nowadays, the performance of modern catalysts is being improved, which could also increase the feasibility of the application of the CTM process, e.g., a stability pilot-scale test of 700 h was carried out for the CTM process using the commercial Süd-Chemie (now Clariant) catalyst in Ref. [4]. The catalyst exhibited good activity and selectivity, and a deactivation rate similar to that for the STM process. Bukhtiyarova et al. [22] conducted a large laboratory-scale test using the Cu/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 catalyst for the CTM process. The results of the stability test (up to 325 h) also showed a similar deactivation rate to that reported for the STM process. Additionally, many studies have focused on the catalyst development for the CTM process on the research level [23,24,25,26,27]. The conventional methanol reactors for the STM process can be used for the CTM process with proper modifications. The traditional STM process has been employed for nearly a hundred years [28]. Many types of commercial reactors have been developed, which are reviewed in the Ref. [29,30,31]. The main issues regarding the reactor design include the removal of the reaction heat, pressure drop, cost, and scalability [29]. The reactors can be divided into two main types according to the method of heat removal in the catalyst beds: 1) adiabatic reactor ; 2) isothermal (or internal cooling) reactors [28]. The first type has comparatively simple structures with one or more adiabatic catalyst beds.</p>
        <p>For a typical adiabatic reactor with multiple catalyst beds, gas quenching is usually employed to lower the gas temperature after each bed, e.g., the ARC (advanced reactor concept) quench-cooled converter from Casale [30].</p>
        <p>The second type integrates tubes or plates for heat removal from the catalyst beds, which results in more complex reactor structures and increased capital cost. However, this type of reactor provides a highly efficient heat transfer process and a more uniform temperature distribution in the reactor;</p>
        <p>for instance, the Lurgi (now Air Liquide) methanol reactor is widely used in the industry. It has a shell-tube structure, and the boiling water provided in the shell side can efficiently remove the reaction heat released in the tube side with the catalyst loaded. Additionally, a gas-cooled (or tube-cooled)</p>
        <p>reactor may be added in the condition where a relatively large production capacity is required, such as the two-step Lurgi's mega-methanol process.</p>
        <p>With respect to the reactor modeling for the CTM process, the selection of the reaction types and designs under different conditions (e.g., reactor scale, capital cost and available utilities) for both the STM and CTM processes can be evaluated by modeling studies which have been thoroughly reviewed by Bozzano and Manenti [30] in the aspects of reaction kinetics, mass transport limitations, catalyst deactivation, steady-state, and dynamic models.</p>
        <p>Meyer et al. [32] conducted a two-dimensional pseudo-homogeneous reactor modeling study for the CTM process, and compared the two commonly used kinetic models (by Graaf et al. [33] and Bussche and Froment [34]). The results showed differences in the first half of the reactor using the two kinetic models, which also indicated that attentions should be paid to the selection of kinetic models for the CTM process. Samimi et al. [35] investigated the possibility of liquid formation in the reactors at an industrial scale CTM process at high pressures (50-300 bar). The water-cooled, gas-cooled and double-cooled (cooled by both water and gas) reactor types were compared in the modeling studies, and the gas-cooled reactor showed a lower possibility of liquid formation and better CO 2 conversion and methanol yield than the others. Marlin et al., [10] from Carbon Recycling International (CRI), discussed the main difference in the reactor design and distillation system between the CTM and STM processes. Tube-cooled (or gas-cooled) reactors were recommended which are more efficient than adiabatic reactors and simpler than water-cooled reactors. Leonzio et al. [36] presented pseudohomogeneous reactor modeling studies on the adiabatic and water-cooled reactor for the CTM process; acceptable temperatures &lt;280 • C were obtained for the adiabatic reactor, and sensitive analysis of the global heat transfer coefficient (300-1000 W/(m 2 • K)) were investigated for the water-cooled reactor. However, the reported modeling study regarding the reactor designs for the CTM process at an industrial scale, or for the reactor modifications or considerations required when changing from the STM to the CTM process are still limited, moreover, the application of different reactor types to the CTM process is rarely discussed. In the present study, the application of three commonly used reactor types (adiabatic, water-cooled and gas-cooled)</p>
        <p>to the CTM process were investigated by comparing with the conditions and reactor designs for the traditional STM process. The main issues associated with the thermodynamic analysis for the adiabatic reactor, radial heat transfer for the water-cooled reactor and hot-spots for the three reactor types were addressed. The performance comparison with the key performance indicators (KPI) was also conducted among the three reactor types to investigate their potentials in application to the CTM process or STM process with CO 2 -rich feed gas.</p>
        <p>Thermodynamic analysis can provide quick evaluations for the streams in the CTM process, such as the possible composition and temperature, after the reaction in the methanol reactor. In this study, the Gibbs free energy minimization method is used to predict the thermodynamic equilibrium. For the gas-phase reaction system in the CTM process using the Lagrange multiplier method, the Gibbs free energy minimization for the system can be expressed by the following equations considering each species in the gas phase and the total system [37]:</p>
        <p>with the following constraint:</p>
        <p>where G 0g f i is the standard Gibbs free energy for the formation of gaseous species i; y i is the mole fraction of species i; P and P 0 are the system pressure and standard state pressure (1 atm), respectively; φ i is the fugacity coefficient of species i; n i is the mole number of species i; λ k is the Lagrange multiplier; a ik is the number of atoms of the k th element in each molecule of gaseous species i, and A k is the total atomic mass of the k th element in the feed.</p>
        <p>The thermodynamic studies for the CTM process under isothermal have been reported in the literature [38,39,40,41,42]. With respect to the adiabatic conditions, the influence of the CO and CO 2 content (SN&gt;2) in the feed gas have been investigated at a certain operating condition of P= 5 MPa and T in = 200 • C [43], however, calculations for the adiabatic condition with wide ranges of temperature and pressure are still required for the reactor designs. In the present study, the conventional feed gas conditions (in methanol industry) of T in = 180-280 • C, P= 30-80 bar, SN= (H 2 mol-CO 2 mol)/(CO mol+CO 2 mol)= 2-10 and CO mol/(CO mol+CO 2 mol)= 0-1 were considered for the CTM and STM processes under the adiabatic condition (Section 3.1), where SN value represents the relative H2 content comparing with those of the CO and CO2 in the feed gas, the stoichometries of reaction 2 and 3 were fufilled when SN=2. Notably, the T in value lower than 180 • C and higher than 280 • C were not considered, which may increase the risk of wax condensation in the catalyst bed and catalyst deactivation by sintering, respectively. A flow rate of 1.0 kmol/s was set for CO x (CO x denotes the sum flow rate of CO and CO 2 ) in the feed stream. The calculation was conducted using the 
            <rs type="software">Aspen Plus</rs> software. The Gibbs reactor was used with the same pressure as that of the feed stream and zero heat duty. The predictive Soave-Redlich-Kwong (PSRK) model was used as the equation of state. The adiabatic CTM process includes both the single-pass process and the process with the recycle stream (shown in Fig. 1). The main components in the system are H 2 , H 2 O, CO, CO 2 , and methanol. Other possible byproducts for the methanol synthesis process such as DME, alcohols, and paraffin were not considered.
        </p>
        <p>The one-dimensional pseudo-homogeneous model is commonly used for the conventional STM process in a packed bed reactor, where negligible gradients are assumed between the gas and solid phases [30]. Other assumptions also include the negligible radial and axial diffusion and uniform velocity, temperature and pressure in the radial direction [30], which are reasonable for an industrial-scale methanol reactor usually with long reactor tubes (e.g., 7 m) and a small tube diameter (e.g., 40 mm). In this study, the pseudo-homogeneous plug-flow reactor in the 
            <rs type="software">ASPEN</rs> software was used to describe the STM and CTM processes in Sections 3.2-3.4. The reaction kinetics proposed by Bussche and Froment [34] was used to evaluate the reaction rates under different conditions (parameters shown in Appendix A), which assumed only the route of CO 2 hydrogenation to methanol (reaction (2)) and the RWGS reaction (reaction (3)). An average effectiveness factor for the catalyst bed was used, which was evaluatd by the CFD modeling in the following section. The heat transfer between the gas phase in the packed-bed and the boiling water (Section 3.2) or cold feed (Section 3.3) were evaluated by the correlations for heat transfer coefficients in the literature [44,45,46,47] (Appendix C). A typical catalyst tablet of Φ6×4mm (e.g., Topsøe MK-121) was used, and the pressure drop of the catalyst bed was evaluated by the Ergun equation [32](Appendix A). The tube diameter and length for the water-cooled or gas-cooled reactor were set to 40 mm and 3 m, respectively; a larger tube diameter of 100 mm was only considered in Section 3.2. Various tube numbers were used to achieve a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) close to the typical industrial value of 10000 h -1 for each case. A total flow rate of 16 kmol/h was set for the CO x in the feed stream, while the flow rate of H 2 was set according to SN= 2. The flow rate settings resulted in a methanol production of around 4000 ton /year, which is the same as the production capacity of the renewable methanol plant in Iceland [10]. The conditions with the recycle stream was considered where 99.9% of the unconverted gas (stream S9 in Figure 1(a)) was recycled. The single-pass methanol yield or local methanol yield in the reactor is given by

With respect to the comparisons of the radial heat transfer in the reactor tube under different conditions, a simple two-dimensional CFD model was used as shown in Figure 2(a). The radial heat transfers at certain crosssections (hot-spots) of the reactor tube were considered and described by pseudo-heat conduction with an effective conductivity (k e,r ) (Appendix C), which is usually used to estimate the radial heat transfer for a packed bed or monolith reactor [48]. The operating conditions of pressure and gas composition at the hot spots (A-F in Figure 6) were uniformly distributed in the cross-section. The influence of the near-wall region was also considered by a heat transfer coefficient (h w ) (Appendix C), which may result in a temperature jump near the wall. The heat conduction in the wall was also included with a typical thickness of 2 mm and thermal conductivity of 18 W/m • K [49]. The temperature of T w = 250 • C and relevant temperature of the cold feed gas were set for the boiling water reactor and gas-cooled reactor, respectively. The tube radius (inner radius) of R= 20-50 mm was considered to investigate the influence of the tube size. The steady state energy equation for the heat conduction is expressed by</p>

        <p>3. Results and discussions</p>
        <p>The adiabatic reactors designed for the STM process usually comprise multiple catalyst beds. Cooling methods such as injection of quench (cold) gas are employed to decrease the gas temperature after each bed to avoid undesirable hot-spot temperatures in the catalyst bed which can result in the catalyst deactivation by sintering. The temperature increase in each catalyst bed is attributed to the exothermic reactions (1) and ( 2). For the CTM process, however, with more involvement of reaction (2) (the main reaction) and the endothermic reaction (3), the reaction heat released in the process is much lower than that from the STM process, which indicates a milder temperature increase in the catalyst bed. Figure 3(a) shows the equilibrium outlet temperature (T out ) for a single-pass methanol synthesis process with different SN values and CO contents, the Gibbs reactor in Aspen Plus is used for the calculation. T out is also the hot-spot temperature assuming a single-bed adiabatic reactor was used. Relatively low outlet temperatures are achieved when the CO content is lower in the feed gas, e.g., when CO/(CO+CO 2 )&lt;0.2, T out is less than 282 • C which is close to the temperature range (220-280 • C) [6] for the conventional STM process. This also indicates the potential to use a simple and low-cost single-bed adiabatic reactor for the CTM process assuming similar catalyst stability to that in the STM process. Additionally, the SN value is usually higher than 2 for the stream (stream S3, in Fig. 1) at the inlet of the reactor (due to the recycling of the product stream, see Section 3.1.2), which can further decrease the outlet temperature, e.g., T out is 275 • C when CO/(CO+CO 2 )=0.2 and SN=8. The methanol (MeOH) yield for the adiabatic condition is also presented as shown in Figure 3(b). Presumably, a high CO content is more favorable for methanol synthesis under the similar pressure and temperature conditions [42]. However, for the adiabatic conditions, the relatively high CO content in the feed gas also results in high outlet temperatures, which are not favorable for the exothermic methanol synthesis reactions. Consequently, a decreasing trend of methanol yield with increasing CO content is observed, as shown in Figure 3(b).</p>
        <p>Compared with the STM process, the RWGS reaction exerts a higher influence on the CTM process due to the higher CO 2 content in the feed gas, which can result in a retarded increase or even decrease in the temperature along the reactor tube. The effect of the inlet temperature and operating pressure (the operating pressure of the Gibbs reactor equals the pressure of the feed gas) are also investigated as shown in Figure 4 for the adiabatic CTM process. The outlet temperature and temperature difference (∆T =T out -T in ) increased and decreased with the rising inlet temperature.</p>
        <p>The latter trend is attributed to the more favorable endothermic RWGS reaction at relatively high temperatures, and a negative value of ∆T was found for the condition of 30 bar, e.g., ∆T=-6.</p>
        <p>Similar to the conventional STM process, the CTM process requires the recycling of the unconverted feed gas with certain recycling ratios (N, the mole ratio of the recycled stream/feed gas) due to the low single-pass conversion of this process. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the components of methanol and water in stream S4 were further condensed and separated through an ideal gas/liquid separator at a typical operating temperature of 40 • C and an assumed pressure drop of 2 bar between the separator and the reactor. A small portion of the gas from the separator was purged to avoid the accumulation of inert gases (e.g., N 2 ) in the system; the remainder was compressed to the operating pressure, and returned to the methanol synthesis process as the recycle stream (stream S9); 99.9% of the unconverted gas was recy- cled to achieve a high methanol yield (larger than 98% in the simulations of this study), which is required for running a methanol plant to minimize the waste of feed gases. A higher value of this recycle factor (larger than 99.9%) has also been tried for a higher methanol yield (e.g., 99%), which caused convergence problem for most of the simulations in this study. The temperature of the feed stream (stream S3) at the inlet of the reactor was set at 210 • C, which is a typical inlet temperature for a industrial methanol reactor, a higher inlet temperature can result in a higher outlet temperature (hot-spot temperature) and a lower methanol yield as shown in Figure 4 for the adiabatic CTM process. Moreover, there is requirement of the lower limit for T in by the commercial copper-based catalysts, e.g., 190 1, where the hot-spot temperature T max is also the outlet temperatures for the adiabatic reactor. Due to that the methanol synthesis reaction favors high pressure, the cases with higher operating pressures resulted in higher one-pass methanol yields, lower recycle ratios and higher T max values. The T max values of were below or slightly higher than the conventional upper limit of 280 • C, which indicates the potential of the application of a single-bed adiabatic reactor to the CTM process.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the potential of a single-bed adiabatic reactor to be employed for the STM process with a CO 2 -rich feed gas (at the reactor inlet) was also investigated. Figure 5 shows the equilibrium outlet temperature for the adiabatic CTM and STM processes with a recycle stream at different operating pressures for the reactor and different CO contents (CO/(CO+CO 2 ) ratios) for feed stream S1. The maximum operating pressure decreased with the increase in the CO content in stream S1. For a typical syngas CO content of CO/(CO+CO 2 )= 0.5, P&lt;40 bar is required assuming T max is less than 280 • C, which indicates a low feasibility for the application of the adiabatic reactor at a high operating pressure (i.e., larger than 40 bar).</p>
        <p>The water-cooled reactor or boiling water reactor with a shell-tube structure is widely used for methanol production. The evaporation of the boiling water in the shell side provides an efficient method for removing the reaction heat from the exothermic STM process in the tube side. Additionally, the hot-spot temperature along the reactor tube can be limited to an acceptable value (e.g., 280 • C). For the CTM process, these hot-spot temperatures are supposed to be lower due to the low intensity of the heat released compared with that in the STM process. In this study, the condition with the recycle stream was calculated for the CTM and STM processes with water-cooled reactors (Fig. 1(b)). T in =210 • C and the same conditions as those mentioned in Section 3.1.2 for the gas/liquid separator were set. A typical temperature of 250 • C was set for the boiling water in the reactor. The conditions with high pressures of 50-80 bar were considered in this section, which have higher outlet temperatures than the conditions with 30 bar (see Table 1), in addition to a high potential for improvement using the water-cooled reactor.</p>
        <p>Figure 6 shows the temperature and methanol yield along the reactor length with different operating pressures and CO/CO 2 ratios for feed stream S1. The higher CO contents for the STM process results in higher methanol yields than those for the CTM process, which indicates a higher reaction rate for the MeOH synthesis with a higher CO content in feed stream S1 under the investigated conditions. Significant temperature increments were observed near the inlet, where the feed gas could be heated by both the boiling water and the heat released by the exothermic methanol synthesis reactions. The temperature rise also accelerated the reaction rates and generated more heat, which was absorbed by the boiling water. Hot-spots were achieved in the reactor when the reaction heat released was equal to the heat transfer rate between the gas phase in the tube side and the boiling water in the shell side of the reactor. The temperatures of the hot-spots (A-F, shown in Figure Temperature gradients also exist in the radial direction in the packedbed reactor tube; consequently, a higher local hot-spot temperature could be achieved at the tube center than the average temperatures calculated by the pseudo-homogeneous model. The radial heat transfers at the crosssections of A-F (hot-spots in Figure 6, hereinafter referred to as A-F) were also considered by CFD modeling to compare the center temperatures (T c )</p>
        <p>for the STM and CTM processes, where the heat transfer rate between the boiling water and the gas phase equals the rate of heat released in the tube Additionally, compared with the mild temperature change in the bulk packed bed, around 60% of the temperature increases were represented by the temperature jumps (at the wall) in the present model due to the low h w values (i.e., high heat resistance for the near-wall region). For the bulk packed bed, the temperature change is large near the wall and small near the tube center as shown in Figure 7(a), which is mainly attributed to the lower reaction heat released near tube center. The trend of the reaction heat in the radial direction is also shown in Figure 7(b) where the reaction heats are intense near the wall for the STM process with a high CO content (B, C and F), while the trends for other cross-sections were not obvious. The trends of the reaction heat in the radial reaction is attributed to the balance of the endothermic RWGS reaction and the exothermic methanol synthesis reaction. In addition, the high temperature is unfavorable for the MeOH synthesis reactions, which may decrease the distance to the equilibrium and reaction rates. Notably, the radial mass transfer in the packed bed was not considered in the study, which may slightly influence the trends.</p>
        <p>With respect to the tube diameter designed for the STM process, a small tube diameter (typically around 40 mm [53]) is usually used in the industry to provide a sufficient heat exchanging area for the strongly exothermic STM process and a reasonable reactor volume as well as an acceptable center temperature in the tube. For the CTM process or STM process with CO 2rich feed gas, this diameter could be adjusted (e.g., using a larger tube) due to the relatively low reaction heat released. Similar to the cross-sections A-C in Figure 7, a large tube diameter of 100 mm was considered, and the radial temperature and reaction heat for the hot-spots (cross-sections) with different CO/CO 2 ratios for feed stream S1 (in Figure 1 or STM process with CO 2 -rich feed gas could be expanded.</p>
        <p>The typical structure of a gas-cooled methanol reactor is shown in Figure 1(b), where the catalyst bed is in the shell side and cooled by the cold feed in the tube side. Compared with the water-cooled reactor, the gascooled reactor is less complex without the introduction of an additional water stream. Similar to the study on the water-cooled reactor, the condition with the recycle stream was calculated for the CTM and STM processes with gascooled reactors (shown in Figure 1 the water-cooled reactor in Figure 6. Additionally, the temperature of the cold feed is shown in Figure 8(b) where the cold feed was heated by the gas phase in the shell side and the temperatures of stream C1 were determined to be from 161.2 • C to 203.0 • C. The temperature of the tube side near the inlet of the catalyst bed (e.g., 0-0.1m) is close to (or lower than) that in the shell side; therefore, the temperature increase (Figure 8(c)) in this area is mainly attributed to the exothermic reactions, which is different from the condition for a water-gas reactor where the gas phase can also be heated by the boiling water. Consequently, a higher T in value could be required for a gas-cool reactor to avoid an extremely low reaction rate near the inlet of the catalyst bed; for instance, a T in value of 210 • C for the CTM process</p>
        <p>) results in a very low T out value of less than 230 • C and y MeOH of less than 15% (not shown in Figure 8). Therefore, a higher "ignition" temperature (T in ) is required for the CTM process using a gas-cooled reactor.</p>
        <p>For the STM processes, there is no "ignition" problem with T in =210 • C, i.e., for the condition of CO/CO 2 =3 and T in =210 • C shown in Figure 8 These local hot-spot temperatures in the "radial" direction of catalyst bed are slightly higher than the T max values, which may also need to be taken into account (Figure S2, Appendix C).</p>
        <p>The main difference of the three reactor types mentioned above is related to the method of heat removal in the reactors. The main concerns include a proper hot-spot temperature (e.g., less than 280 • C), and a reasonable singlepass methanol yield for a certain catalyst volume. The latter is determined by the reaction rate (per volume catalyst) as well as the temperature profile along the reactor.</p>
        <p>For the traditional STM process with a high CO content (e.g., CO/CO 2 =3) the design of a single adiabatic reactor is only feasible at low operating pressures, e.g., P&lt;30 bar. For higher operating pressures, a traditional multi-bed or multi-reactor design with internal or external cooling is required to limit the T max value for the process. Compared with the adiabatic reactor, the gas-cooled reactor can provide a way of heat removal for the catalyst bed, however, the gas-cooled reactor need a high "ignition" temperature at the inlet (see section 3.3), which still results in a hot-spot temperature higher than the conventional range, e.g., T max =289.3 • C with P= 50 bar, CO/CO 2 = 3, and T in =235 • C (shown in Figure 8(a)). The water-cooled reactor showed a more efficient way of heat removal and higher methanol yield than the gascooled reactor by comparing the simulation results in Figure 6 with those in Figure 8. This results agree with wide application of the water-cooled reactor in the market for the traditional methanol production. For the STM process with a CO 2 -rich feed gas (CO/CO 2 = 1), the application of the adiabatic reactor still exhibited low feasibility as mentioned in Section 3.1.2, and gas-cooled reactor shows feasibility at low and medium pressures, e.g., P&lt;50</p>
        <p>bar. With respect to the CTM process, all the three reactor types showed potentials as mentioned in the above sections. The condition with the recycle stream was calculated for the CTM processes with the three reactor types by the pseudo-homogeneous model as shown in Figure 1(a). The T in values of 210-235 • C and the same conditions as those mentioned in Section 3.1.2 for the gas/liquid separator were set. The key operating and design parameters for the three reactors were given in Table 2. The effectiveness factors for the catalyst bed in the three reactors by the 2-D CFD model (Section 2.3) were investigated combined with the pseudo-homogeneous model. The trends of the effectiveness factors in the reactors under the conditions given by Table 2 were demonstrated in Figure 9(a). The water-cooled and gas-cooled reactor show very similar trends of the η M eOH value, while the adiabatic reactor exhibits a higher value in the in the middle part of the reactor (0.4-2.4 m). The average effectiveness factor for the adiabatic reactor, water-cooled reactor and gas-cooled reactor are 0.56, 0.46, and 0.42, respectively. The effectiveness factors of the RWGS reaction (reaction (3)) in the three reactor types are shown in Figure 9(b). There are hyperbolic trends found for all the three cases with large positive (&gt; 1.0) and negative values. These trends are due to that the direction of the RWGS reaction is reversed to the water gas shift (WGS) reaction along the reactors, which occurs faster inside the catalyst tablet than that on the tablet surface. Additionally, the key performance indicators for the three reactors in the CTM process were presented in Table 3. The water-cooled reactor exhibited slightly higher performance with a lower hot-spot temperature, which can be attributed to its more efficient way of heat removal compared with the other two reactors, e.g., a higher heat transfer coefficient of 321.7 W/m 2 •K (shown in Table 2). The efficient heat removal can also beneficial for the conditions with temperature fluctuations at the reactor inlet, where a too-low T in can be increased by the boiling water (e.g., 250 • C) and the intensive reaction heat caused by a too-high T in can also be efficiently removed by the boiling water. As shown in Table 3, the adiabatic reactor presented a lower singlepass methanol yield and a higher recycle ratio, this trend is more obvious at a higher operating pressure of 80 bar (Table S5, Appendix E). In addition, a higher "ignition" temperature (T in =215 • C) is required (shown in Table 2)</p>
        <p>for the adiabatic reactor, which indicates a narrower range for the T in value compared with that for the water-cooled reactor. With respect to the gascooled reactor, it exhibits similar performance to that for the water-cooled reactor (shown in Table 2) but has a smaller reactor diameter (or volume)</p>
        <p>which is attributed to the relatively high catalyst loading in the shell side and a smaller tube diameter (for the cold feed). The heat-couple design of the gascooled reactor can also decease the load (or size) of the heat exchangers for preheating the feed. The disadvantages of this reactor could be the possible non-uniform distribution of the gas flow and temperature in the shell side where a properly designed distributor is desired. Additionally, a relatively high T in value (e.g., T in = 235 • C as shown in Table 2) is required for the reactor, which would result in a slightly increased hot-spot temperature and a narrower range of the T in value.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, besides the KPIs mentioned in Table 3, the reactor cost is also an important factor for the applications of the reactors. The capital costs for the CTM process (Figure S3, Appendix F) with the three reactor types were evaluated by [54]</p>
        <p>where C B and Q B are the base cost and base capacity, respectively, Q C is the design component capacity, M is the cost exponent, f M , f P and f T are the material of construction capital cost factor, pressure correction factor and temperature correction factor, respectively. The capital cost for the components of the reactors, heat exchangers, compressor and flash tanks were calculated by equation 19.The parameter values for the calculations can be found in Appendix F.</p>
        <p>The capital cost estimation for CTM process with three reactors and different operating pressures were presented in Figure 10. The differences of the total capital cost are mainly attributed by the differences of the reactor capital cost, and the total values for other capital costs are around 180,000-220,000 $ for all the cases. The water-gas reactor shows the highest reactor capital costs at the two pressures, which is attributed to its larger tube diameter and reactor diameter (shown in Table 2). The adiabatic reactor exhibits the lowest reactor cost due to its simpler structure and smaller reactor diameter, and the gas-cooled reactor presents a medium cost level.</p>
        <p>A comparative study was conducted on the adiabatic, water-cooled and gas-cooled reactors for the methanol synthesis from syngas and CO 2 under the conditions of T in = 180-280 • C, P= 30-80 bar, feed gases of SN= 2-10 and CO/(CO+CO 2 )= 0-1. The temperature profiles in the axial and radial directions, particularly the hot-spot temperatures, operating conditions and methanol yields for the reactors have been investigated using thermodynamic analysis, the CFD method and the pseudo-homogeneous model. The capital costs for CTM process with the three reactor types have also been evaluated.</p>
        <p>Compared with the traditional STM process with a high CO content (e.g., CO/CO 2 = 3), the STM process with a CO 2 -rich feed gas and the CTM process exhibited reduced hot-spot temperatures from a thermodynamic point of view. Consequently, besides the widely used water-cooled reactor the singlebed adiabatic (without internal cooling) reactor and the gas-cooled reactor also exhibited potentials for the CTM process, where the hot-spot temperatures in the reactors can be within the typical operating temperature range for the catalyst. For the STM process with the CO 2 -rich feed gas, single-bed adiabatic (without internal cooling) reactor and the gas-cooled reactor only showed feasibility at low or medium pressure (e.g.,P&lt; 50 bar).</p>
        <p>With respect to the comparison of the three reactor types for the CTM process, all the three reactor types demonstrated similar trends of the effectiveness factor of the catalyst with approximated range 0.4-0.6 for the methanol synthesis reaction and 0.2-0.4 for the RWGS (or WGS) reaction under the investigated conditions. The water-cooled reactor showed advantages in terms of efficient heat removal, low hot-spot temperature and wide relatively range inlet temperature for control.</p>
        <p>The adiabatic reactor and the gas-cooled reactor demonstrated a relatively low and medium performance (hot-spot temperature, recycle ratio and single-pass methanol yield), respectively. However, the same trends of capital cost were also found for the three reactors, which indicates the potentials for the adiabatic reactor and gas-cooled reactor types in a small-scale CTM process.</p>

        <p>(3) Cold feed Different from the large heat transfer coefficient h f for the boiling water in a water-cooled reactor, the h f value for the cold feed in the reactor tube of a gas-cooled reactor could be much lower and should be considered.
