        <p>The energy system is changing from traditional fixed producers to mobile and distributed providers of high-proportion renewable energy supply. The photovoltaic (PV) equipment plays a critical role in the current transitional period and will contribute to the ongoing energy transition [1]. The PV system saves conventional energy and obviates the electricity generation by peaking power plant and the emissions from diesel generators [2]. Although the largest share of PV applications is held by utility-scale systems [3], which account for almost 62% of the total installed capacity, building-integrated photovoltaic systems (BIPV) have been identified as one of the main tracks for extensive market penetration of PV and the most promising applications [4,5].The energy system is changing from traditional fixed producers to mobile and distributed providers of high-proportion renewable energy supply.

        <p>Compared with the utility-scale PV systems, BIPV is gaining popularity due to the lack of wide space and the large availability of roof [6]. Space flexibility makes BIPV can be installed on the building skin, enabling the combination of electricity generation and other functions of the building materials. Potential room for growth means product technology can be merged with BIPV technology for better performance [7]. However, BIPV also faces challenges from the supply-side and the demand-side [8]. In demend side, the electricity demand response and • Data sensing: collection of traditional supply-side data, including weather, roof angel, etc., and the demand-side data, involving daily demand, price, etc., also show massive growth. These directly measurable supply and demand data constitute the most basic feature of SBIPV. • Data analysis: analyzation of data obtained from direct or indirect measurement of data Sensing constitutes the second feature of SBIPV. Data Analysis of SBIPV can not only mine the residential behaviors in demand-side but also reflect different shading and various electricity consumption in supply-side. • Data-driven prediction: The information obtained from the data analysis and data sensing can be used to predict the future trend of the supply-side and the energy variation of demand-side. Datadriven prediction is affected by long-term and short-term output forecasts on the supply-side and load changes on the demand-side [23]. • Data-driven optimization: The optimization puts forward higher requirements for policy guiding, distributed energy system design, and peer-to-peer (P2P) trading. The SBIPV systems will be able to effectively connect the supply-side and demand-side as an interface through data-driven optimization.Compared with the utility-scale PV systems, BIPV is gaining popularity due to the lack of wide space and the large availability of roof [6].

        <p>The number of BIPV systems in the energy girds is growing at an unprecedented speed, which bring various data [24]. General approach to achieve building integrated photovoltaic systems and implementation barriers of current method has been reviewed in many papers [25,26]. From data collection [27], processing [28], to optimization [29], they all face huge challenges. Options for current data utilization can be classified into supply-side and demand-side. In supply-side, data are always collected through meteorological instruments, temperature recorders, inverters, and other equipment to monitor photovoltaic equipment [30]. Various sensors make data collection not only fragmented, but often in different formats and lacking effective management. Besides, the availability of meteorological data and the lack of sensing data limit the accuracy and application range of related prediction methods [31]. A considerable amount of useful data is discarded due to lack of effective planning and policy guidance, which could have been used to further improve service quality and power supply.The number of BIPV systems in the energy girds is growing at an unprecedented speed, which bring various data [24].

        <p>In demand-side, the data collection is usually done by the residential meter. The data collected by sensors inside the buildings are usually less concerned. Besides, most of the demand-side electricity meters usually have data loss and missing, which makes the availability of collected data is poor [32]. The way of analysis the collected data is relatively direct and can be devide as: monitoring the current status of BIPV systems to ensure the safety and reliablity [33] and making predictions about the future trends of BIPV systems. Many AI method is introduced for data utilization including CNNs [34], Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) Networks [35], Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) [36], Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) [37], Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) [38], Support Vector Machine (SVM) [39], etc. Data analysis that takes into account the residential comfort and electricity economy is very rare, and traditional data analysis is difficult to use the interaction between users and the grid to promote photovoltaic consumption [40].In demand-side, the data collection is usually done by the residential meter.

        <p>Except for the weak data sensing and analysis, global prediction and optimization from the modules level, PV equipment level, to BIPV systems level is also an important aspect to make full use of the full-link data and minimize the irreversible loss [41]. However, most optimization methods to improve system efficiency always emphasize the data on single supply-side and data-driven BIPV flexibility services are still lacking.Except for the weak data sensing and analysis, global prediction and optimization from the modules level, PV equipment level, to BIPV systems level is also an important aspect to make full use of the full-link data and minimize the irreversible loss [41].

        <p>Current status and barriers of BIPV systems has been effectively explained in many papers [42], but none of analysis has been made from the view of data. For supply-side of BIPV systems, the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data for early evaluation, grid-side data during operation monitoring, post-installation maintenance data, and other data usuful for BIPV systems have not effectively collected. For demand-side, internal sensor data including indoor temperature, house occupancy and other data that can effectively coordinate building flexibility are absent. Besides, the lack of effective analysis and limitations of prediction and optimization methods make the data-driven SBIPV systems is hard to choose the best technical option. Lack and discard of data; poor quality of data analysis; limitations of prediction; variability of optimization. These disadvantages made the realization of the data-driven SBIPV systems at the current stage is still a big challenge.

        <p>The barriers that prevent from the promption of SBIPV can be summarized as: (1) There is lack of wider collection and sensing data for the supply-side and demand-side when BIPV systems is concerned. (2) Limitations of data analysis between the sensing data and the user demand on time, space and energy grade. (3) Mismatches between the load and source prediction at various time scales limit the potential of BIPV systems. (4) Geographical obstruction of microgrid, lack of guiding policy and communication barriers of combinatorial optimization. The detailed solutions of these barriers and the corresponding features of data-driven SBIPV systems will be presented in section 3-6. The solutions can be expressed as four aspects as following: (1) Data Sensing: collection of both supply-side data and demand-side data, especially advanced Sensors for PV panels, GIS data, smart residential electricity meters, and indoor sensors data. (2) Data Analysis: analyzation of data obtained from direct or indirect measurement of data Sensing, including shading impact, roof area, electricity consumption behavior, and indoor information (3) Data-driven Prediction: long-term and short-term output forecasts on the supply-side and load changes on the demandside.

        <p>Achieving effective sensing of data will be the first step to effectively play the role of the data-driven SBIPV systems [58]. For future perspectives of SBIPV systems, the data sensing is the cornerstone, further analyzation and effective prediction of large-scale supply-side and demand-side data will build a bridge for the coupling of various energy systems [59]. The data-driven optimization of the SBIPV systems will help realize an optimal solution for the demand and supply-side. On the supply-side, data sensing can mainly be achieved by data acquisition equipment; on the demand-side, the data sensing can reflect through smart meters and indoor sensors.

Different types of sensors shoul be widely installed on PV panels to monitor common power output, including real-time power, output voltage, and transmission current [60]. For SBIPV systems, devices including inverters and boost valves are often equipped with various sensors to monitor the active power [61,62], reactive power, harmonic frequencies, node voltage waveforms and other common power quality on the supply-side [63]. Besides, the environmental parameters of PV penels would include meteorological data, such as wind direction, wind speed, air temperature, humidity, air pressure and other data. Through the sensors in PV panels, different paraments of PV panels can be effectively collected and transferred to terminal of users, which can be used to the decision-making of residents. Based on the online prediction method and feedback from sensors, many control strategies have been improved and proved [64,65].To collect more data from PV panels and environment, data-driven probabilistic net load monitoring methods and sensors should be applied [32].

The utilization of GIS data can detect the potential of solar power generation in the early planning of the construction. The value of its data collection has been verified in South Korea [67], Iran [68], Italy [69], Australia [70] and other countries. Most GIS data will be presented in the form of images. The cameras in drone and satellite can clarify the house inclination, house area, house type, the potential area, and the location of the cloud layer.

        <p>The multi-source information on both demand and supply-sides are useful to evaluate opportunities and challenges for SBIPV systems [71]. Resident data represent the distribution and habits of electricity consumption of individuals and are of great significance for the SBIPV systems to achieve effective scheduling and reasonable distribution of PV panels. In addition, the measured data can be used in SBIPV systems to reduce peak loads (peak clipping or peak shaving), shift load from on-peak to off-peak (load-shifting), increase the flexibility of the load (flexible load shape), and reduce general energy consumption (strategic conservation). The aggregation and collection of these data is of great significance for further improving user experience, improving service quality, and improving building energy flexibility [72]. The applications and designs involved in this process have been confirmed by a number of studies to be possible and reproducible [73].The multi-source information on both demand and supply-sides are useful to evaluate opportunities and challenges for SBIPV systems [71].

        <p>The data of resident electrical consumption is mainly collected by residential meters, which can effectively help deploy BIPV systems in next step: data analysis. The improvement of the power market, widespread application of intelligent communication, and smart meters have made it possible for the demand-side to participate in the optimal operation of the distribution network [74]. The data gotten from meters can provide a reference for PV installation height determination, manpower maintenance, boost location selection and inverter selection for the BIPV systems [75,76]. Weak PV technology conditions (including low conversion efficiency and reliability) and low PV electricity penetration levels would result in insufficience of data sensing in SBIPV systems [77,78]. The indoor sensors can realize the monitoring of the room occupancy and effective measurement of temperature and humidity. These indoor data usually affect the user's subsequent electricity consumption behavior, which would play important role in improving the electricity services of the buildings. Baran Yildiz et al. conducted an effective evaluation [79] on the excess power generation of BIPV systems and domestic electric hot water systems based on Australian electric/heating data of demand-side.

        <p>One of the most critical problems which affect the performance of BIPV systems is shading. Shading may result from soiling, trees, buildings [83], or chimneys [84]. Some results [85] shown that soiling seriously affects performance of PV panels. Winter rains are adequate to keep surfaces cleaned. The PV arrays always get entirely or partially shaded by the passing clouds, neighboring buildings and towers, trees, and utility and telephone poles [86,87]. Complicated shading causes the photovoltaic panels to be affected differently by shadows. When the shading covers all the photovoltaics, the power generation efficiency is almost zero. At this time, the photovoltaic effect stops and the photovoltaic panels no longer operate [88].One of the most critical problems which affect the performance of BIPV systems is shading.

        <p>Under partial shading conditions, the PV characteristics get more complex with multiple peaks. The partial shading can lead to more than 10-20% of annual reduction in power production in residential applications [89]. For such problems, there exist different solutions. Detection and classification of shading [90] and adjustment of the PV arrays [91] can increase both power generation and PV reliability. This the most usual method. But for other situation, eapecially cities, situations will become various. In cities, the high-rise buildings and vegetation [92,93] are also the main reasons for output reduction. For this delimma, the meteorological data will effectively help the data analysis on the power generation [94][95][96]. The GIS data analysis including roof angle, shading impact, roof area, house type, ground inclination, occlusion classification [54], guano, snow, and smog [97]. Recent research progress in these directions is crucial for future SBIPV systems [98].

        <p>GIS-assessment of the roof surface area available before equipment installation, and area (including potential area) of the buildings have a profound impact on the BIPV systems [107]. Robustness of the GIS-assessment of the BIPV systems has been verified successively in China [65], the United States [108], Sweden [109] and South Korea [110]. The suitability of each roof for PV deployment and the characteristics can be analyzed for a minimum SBIPV systems [111,112]. It is worth mentioning that the construction costs of BIPV systems are usually different for different types of land and buildings. The installation area of different types of buildings varies, with suburbs generally having more potential areas than cities. Land acquisition costs for public infrastructure such as airports and hospitals are also very different from slums. This must be noted during the analysis.GIS-assessment of the roof surface area available before equipment installation, and area (including potential area) of the buildings have a profound impact on the BIPV systems [107].

        <p>The combination of GIS and semantic segmentation is another novel method characterized by cost-effectiveness and data consistency. The semantic segmentation for PV panels includes the analysis of homogeneous texture and heterogenous color of PV panels and image data of buildings [113]. Although the data of the area of houses and rooftop PV panels in local areas can be obtained through cameras, the detection and analysis of satellite/aerial imagery is a more appropriate approach.

The labels of residents could further reduces power consumption and heat loss. In addition, the division of labels facilitates the integrated control of storage and loads in PV and residential buildings [117]. For users, on the one hand, electricity consumption data can be used to further coordinate the power grid with building-integrated photovoltaics, which will suppress the generation of harmonics and improve the power quality. On the other hand, the behavior of users can promote optimal utilization of electrical and thermal energy storage devices.

        <p>Besides, for energy companies, the consumption behavior of users will be more complex and diverse in the future [119]. The trend of this complexity may bring more uncertainty on the combination of power supply solutions. So the data analysis will be more necessary for business company. In the SBIPV systems, the user load data will be affected by demand-side pricing, indoor temperature, humidity, resulting in changes in housing occupancy and load [120]. However, demand-side data is still mainly affected by the subjective will of users, which is affected by the environment.

        <p>Basically, the PV generation output prediction can be conducted with AI algorithms and physical modeling. Physical models and machine learning technologies are also gradually merged for higher reliability. Regardless of how the prediction horizons are defined, the time scale of the models must be clearly defined. Output forecasts are usually at the millisecond, second, minute, hour, and day level. At this level, Artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as CNNs [128] and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [129,130], have already produced promising results in PV generation prediction based on historical data analysis. The prediction by AI can effectively map the complex interdependence between short periods. These data-driven short time prediction models are mostly divided into three categories: time series [131,132], numerical weather prediction (NWP) [133] and sky imaging [134]. Although the accuracy of the time series models is ideal, the meteorological data and historical may not be available at remote locations [135]. Numerical weather prediction and sky imaging will also play more important roles in some places where weather data are not accessible [136].

        <p>In terms of long-term forecasts, seasonal and annual cyclical changes are important references for achieving power supply stability. In the annual and quarterly forecasts, the regularity is more prominent [144]. Photovoltaic power presents volatility, annual periodicity, and adjacent similarity [145], which are usually determined by the regularity of climate change, like plum rain [146], and the periodicity of local economic development. Usually, rapid economic development, influx of people, and expand of immigrants usually show an increasing trend in annual electricity consumption. Whereas the population is severely aging and the economy is in recession, the annual power consumption usually shows a decreasing trend. In addition, the power consumption also shows regularity [147], which should be considered when deploying the BIPV systems [148], the planning of the position of energy storage stations, and the size of the SBIPV systems [149,150].

Changes of load in the United States [153], China [154] and India [155] have been proven the huge impact on city-level load. For the SBIPV systems, it will be important to reasonably predict the load changes. It is worth mentioning that the electricity load variation during the COVID-19 leads to more diversity in the load type [156]. The shutdowns caused by Covid-19 are likely to increase energy consumption by home office users. At high voltage levels trading mechanisms like contracts for ancillary services [157] and balancing markets [158] can predict the economically efficient supply of system flexibility services [159].

        <p>The flexibility of combining power generation with buildings still lacks regulations and standards to manage the energy system is the next perspective of data-driven optimization in supply-side. Many countries have formulated the goal of using solar PV in construction [168,169], but compared with various application scenarios [170], solar PV policy guiding is still not enough [171]. The performance metrics of the BIPV systems established based on energy policies or industry standards have a profound impact on the construction planning of the building [172,173]. These effective guidance on the supply-side is of great significance for alleviating the pressure of power supply and energy storage, which can realize the economical utilization of energy. Various distributed system design has different effects on building exterior, system efficiency and energy storage [174]. Although China [175], Europe [176], the United States [177], the Middle East [178], and other countries have successively issued various laws and regulations. The implemented pilot projects and case studies have also reached a level that can be commercialized, but due to the uniqueness of the building and the cost constraints of photovoltaics, most policies and legal guidance measures have significant time and space limitation [179]. Effective policy guiding of the supply-side will affect the willingness of SBIPV systems users to choose PV equipment. Most of the policies still remain on the construction, operation, and maintenance of BIPV, and the rules of relevant guidance for users' energy management are not enough. More useful measured data for technology and policy planning should be taken into consideration [180]. At the same time, for cogeneration systems, the thermal inertia of the building can promote the intelligent building services. At this level, quite a few cases have been performed [181], giving valid verification of the reproducibility of the SBIPV system [182,183]. However, because of the different climatic conditions and economic development in different places, the rules made are generally often geographically limited [184].The flexibility of combining power generation with buildings still lacks regulations and standards to manage the energy system is the next perspective of data-driven optimization in supply-side.

        <p>In addition to the policy guidance, how to reasonably carry out distributed energy planning and design depends on whether the coupling of the SBIPV systems and other energy systems can achieve a stable power supply. The changes in data collection and utilization methods will show big potential in this data-driven optimization [185]. In all disturbed energy system, the combination of PV panels with the microgrid shows huge superiority [186]. Due to the variety of combinations of individual microgrids, it usually includes Wind-solar hybrid systems, PV-geothermal systems [187,188], PV-electric vehicle systems [189], etc. The residual power of these microgrids can still be spontaneously connected to the grid or energy storage. The robustness of energy storage system using battery with BIPV through linear programming has been confirmed [190].In addition to the policy guidance, how to reasonably carry out distributed energy planning and design depends on whether the coupling of the SBIPV systems and other energy systems can achieve a stable power supply.

        <p>For SBIPV systems, data-driven optimization not only means a Fig. 6. Data-driven Optimization of SBIPV systems. combination with multiple energy sources but also a cross-combination of the environment [192], economy [193], and policy [194] for SBIPV systems. Under the traditional paradigm, electricity trading is usually realized through a centralized energy trading system, which needs to actively organize consumers to participate in the electricity market. This type of centralized energy transaction not only has high transaction costs, but also has low management efficiency [195]. Therefore, attention should be shifted from panel production to electricity trading. In an open electricity market, the electricity price and the way of information dissemination significantly affect user choice. A key question that remains unresolved is how to coordinate various numbers of distributed energy resources, especially when each one with different owners and characteristics, and the P2P trading is considered as a possible solution [196].For SBIPV systems, data-driven optimization not only means a Fig. 6.

        <p>The peer-to-peer energy trading enables between sharing economy of consumers within the local distribution network. P2P energy trading is decentralized, usually through direct end-to-end electricity trading. Different from centralized energy trading, the P2P trading model encourages multi-party transactions, and energy matching can be carried out according to user preferences. The advent of blockchain technology [197] and the increasing penetration of rooftop PV systems have presented a new opportunity for P2P energy trading. In electricity markets including the SBIPV systems, communities may enjoy cheap electricity prices and will support solar energy. However, there exists a considerable knowledge gap between market mechanisms and energy exchanges [198]. Challenges arise in the auction to ensure individual rationality, incentive compatibility, budget balance, and economic efficiency. The transition to a low-carbon future with a high proportion of renewable energy changes citizens from passive energy consumers to active energy prosumers [199,200]. Through the P2P trading, the transition to a low-carbon future would change citizens from passive energy consumers to active prosumers [201]. The P2P trading will further promote the transformation of demand-side management. Cooperating with demand-side microgrid optimization, P2P trading, and policy guidance. It can be predictably the SBIPV systems will have a new look after data-driven optimzation.The peer-to-peer energy trading enables between sharing economy of consumers within the local distribution network.
