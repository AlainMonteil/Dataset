        <p>There has been a gradual decline in oil demand in the European Union (EU) countries since 2000 due to a range of factors including the development of green vehicles, improvements in vehicle efficiency, the blending of biofuels, and global economic downturn. However, the oil import dependency ratio as reported by McGovern et al. (2020) had continuously increased to a high of 96% in 2018,2 which clearly identifies the importance of analysing the profound effects of oil supply shocks on the European macroeconomy. According to McGovern et al. (2020), more than half of the EU's oil imports came from non-OPEC countries (31% from Russia, 16% from Kazakhstan and Norway, and a further 5% from Azerbaijan). In addition, around 35% of the total oil imports of the EU came from OPEC countries (9% from Iraq, 8% from Saudi Arabia, 7% from Nigeria, 6% from Libya and 4% from Iran). It can be seen that the majority of oil imports of the EU came from unstable regions such as those suffering from geopolitical tensions, terrorism, border conflicts, or wars. Consequently, the EU countries face an increasing risk of oil supply outage and so it is essential to figure out the relative importance of OPEC and non-OPEC oil supply shocks to the EU's macroeconomy.There has been a gradual decline in oil demand in the European Union (EU) countries since 2000 due to a range of factors including the development of green vehicles, improvements in vehicle efficiency, the blending of biofuels, and global economic downturn.

        <p>Existing literature on the oil-macroeconomy relationship has been largely focused on the US market. To name a few, the seminal work of Hamilton (1983) is among one of the first to explore how oil is associated with the macroeconomy. They document that the US macroeconomic performance is affected by fluctuations of oil price in the post-OPEC periods. Hamilton (2003) further utilizes a nonlinear model to investigate the relation between oil price changes and GDP growth. The empirical findings suggest that oil price increases play a more important role in determining economic growth than oil price decreases. Moreover, Kilian (2008) first isolates a time series of oil supply shock which causes a decrease in the US real GDP growth and a spike in inflation. One recent work by Herrera and Rangaraju (2020) attributes the impulse response estimations in existing studies to different identification strategies.Existing literature on the oil-macroeconomy relationship has been largely focused on the US market.

        <p>To understand the macroeconomic effects of structural oil shocks, numerous studies prefer a Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) model (Kilian, 2008(Kilian, , 2009;;Kilian and Lewis, 2011;Kilian, 2014;Lütkepohl and Net Sunajev, 2014;Baumeister andKilian, 2015, 2016;Güntner and Linsbauer, 2018;Baumeister et al., 2018;Känzig, 2019;Baumeister and Hamilton, 2021;Herrera and Rangaraju, 2020). Specifically, Kilian (2009) empirically uses a SVAR model to identify oil supply shock, aggregate demand shock and oil-specific demand shock, respectively. The impacts of the identified oil shocks on the US macroeconomy are varied. Bhat et al. (2018) employ a SVAR methodology to explore how the macroeconomy of India is affected by oil and food price shocks. Their results confirm that the macroeconomic activities in India are sensitive to external shocks. In addition, Nasir et al. (2019) adopt a SVAR framework to examine the association between oil price shocks and the macroeconomy of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member countries. They demonstrate that as the major oil exporters in the world, the impacts of oil price shocks on macroeconomic variables of GCC members are significant and positive.Further studies such as Cologni and Manera (2009); Kang and Ratti (2013); Cashin et al. (2014); Lee et al. (2017); Gong and Lin (2018); Ewing et al. (2018); Kamiar and Mehdi (2019) and Chen et al. (2020) also investigate the impacts of oil shocks on the economy from a variety of different perspective.To understand the macroeconomic effects of structural oil shocks, numerous studies prefer a Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) model (Kilian, 2008(Kilian, , 2009;;Kilian and Lewis, 2011;Kilian, 2014;Lütkepohl and Net Sunajev, 2014;Baumeister andKilian, 2015, 2016;Güntner and Linsbauer, 2018;Baumeister et al., 2018;Känzig, 2019;Baumeister and Hamilton, 2021;Herrera and Rangaraju, 2020).

        <p>However, a drawback of the traditional SVAR model is that the conclusions are derived based on the assumptions that the desired oil supply shocks can contemporaneously affect macroeconomic variables, but the reverse impacts take time.However, a drawback of the traditional SVAR model is that the conclusions are derived based on the assumptions that the desired oil supply shocks can contemporaneously affect macroeconomic variables, but the reverse impacts take time.</p>
        <p>To interpret the results with causal evidence, one should ensure that the unexpected oil supply shocks are strictly exogenous and not endogenous responses to other macroeconomic shocks. To address this main missing point of current literature, this study estimates the causal effects of an exogenous oil supply shock on the EU's macroeconomy by utilizing a proxy SVAR model in the spirit of Stock and Watson (2012) and Mertens and Ravn (2013).

        <p>As mentioned above, a large proportion of oil imports into the EU came from non-OPEC countries, rather than OPEC member countries. It is natural to suspect that there are heterogenous impacts of OPEC and non-OPEC oil supply shocks on the European macroeconomy. Therefore, we respectively identify OPEC and non-OPEC oil supply shocks and compare their impacts on the EU macroeconomy by using impulse response functions (IRFs) under a novel identification scheme. In addition, forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD), historical decomposition (HD) and counterfactual analysis (CA) are conducted to complement our quantitative evidence. We also examine the responses at sectoral level and of individual member countries to provide economic implications.As mentioned above, a large proportion of oil imports into the EU came from non-OPEC countries, rather than OPEC member countries.

        <p>The impulse response analysis shows that the identified exogenous oil supply shocks of both OPEC and non-OPEC significantly raise oil price and unemployment rate while having a dampening impact on industrial production of the EU countries.The impulse response analysis shows that the identified exogenous oil supply shocks of both OPEC and non-OPEC significantly raise oil price and unemployment rate while having a dampening impact on industrial production of the EU countries.</p>
        <p>Moreover, we find that exogenous OPEC and non-OPEC oil supply shocks have different impacts on price level. Specifically, the identified oil shock of OPEC decreases price but that of non-OPEC has an opposite effect on price level. According to historical decomposition, some interesting results are noticeable. We identified negative shocks in OPEC oil supply over three sub-periods from 2009 to 2011, 2013 to 2014 and several months in the late 2019. These negative shifts caused increasing oil price and decreasing industrial production. Interestingly, the identified oil supply cuts did not cause the price to rise. As for the results of non-OPEC oil shocks, negative shifts in oil production are identified in several months of 2011 to 2013, 2016 to 2017 and late 2019. These decreases in non-OPEC oil supply elevated oil price and consumer price whose HD patterns are highly coherent. In addition, by using the counterfactual series in a typical VAR, we observe that the IRFs patterns of oil supply shocks change dramatically.Moreover, we find that exogenous OPEC and non-OPEC oil supply shocks have different impacts on price level.

        <p>To capture wider macroeconomic responses, we provide the results of IRFs of the components of industrial production growth, inflation rate, trade and financial market variables.

        <p>However, the exogenous OPEC oil supply shock does not have significant impacts on sub-indices of consumer price. In terms of trade variables, the unexpected oil supply reduction of OPEC has significant and negative impacts on exports and imports in the short-run. As for the reactions of financial variables, a sudden decrease in OPEC oil supply increases interest rate and share price in the short-run. However, an exogenous non-OPEC oil supply shock leads to a slump in stock market for the near future. Finally, we show that the impacts of the exogenous OPEC and non-OPEC oil supply shocks on macroeconomy are varied across the EU states, which calls for more resilient capabilities to respond to oil market disruptions.However, the exogenous OPEC oil supply shock does not have significant impacts on sub-indices of consumer price.

        <p>First, we use a novel approach to identify the oil supply shock by employing unplanned oil supply outage as the exogenous instrument, which addresses the causality problem and mitigates the endogeneity problem simultaneously. Second, we distinguish the effects of the oil supply shocks from OPEC and non-OPEC on the European macroeconomy. The results show that the unexpected cuts in both OPEC and non-OPEC oil supply would decrease industrial production and increase unemployment rate.First, we use a novel approach to identify the oil supply shock by employing unplanned oil supply outage as the exogenous instrument, which addresses the causality problem and mitigates the endogeneity problem simultaneously.

        <p>Given the background of heightened geopolitical risk in the oil-producing regions, this study offers profound policy implications on the improvement of the EU's energy security in both the short-term and long-term. It is crucial to employ a coordinated approach across the EU to improve energy efficiency in the short-term. More importantly, we argue that in the longer term, enhancing the oil storage capacity and infrastructure as well as advancing the transition to renewable energy sources should be placed as a strategic priority, so that the EU's energy market becomes more resilient and sustainable by curtailing the exposure and vulnerability to oil supply interruptions.Given the background of heightened geopolitical risk in the oil-producing regions, this study offers profound policy implications on the improvement of the EU's energy security in both the short-term and long-term.

        <p>Numerous literature has used VAR models to estimate the impacts of oil shocks on the macroeconomy (Kilian, 2009;Kilian and Lewis, 2011;Kilian, 2014;Baumeister et al., 2018;Baumeister and Hamilton, 2021;Herrera and Rangaraju, 2020). Although the VAR can describe the dynamics between a set of endogenous variables within a linear system, the key problem is to measure the impacts of an exogenous shocks on all the variables within the VAR. To obtain a structural interpretation, the common method is to impose restrictions on the VAR system. Following Stock and Watson (2012) and Mertens and Ravn (2013), we employ a proxy SVAR model with an external instrument to achieve identification. This methodology is capable to solve the reverse causality problem and ensure the identified oil supply shocks are exogenous. Section 2.1 introduces the proxy SVAR model.

        <p>The unplanned oil supply outage (referred to as outage hereafter) is calculated as a difference between estimated effective production capacity (the level of supply that could be available within one year) and estimated production. The outage is related to weather, natural disasters, labour strikes, technical failures or accidents, political disputes, and geopolitical tensions. Although Syria is not a major oil supplier in the world, most of its production exports to Europe. After 2013, the outage gradually decreased and touched the bottom at the beginning of 2015. In the following months, there is a sharp increase due to the wildfires in Canada in June 2016, which leads to an unexpected oil supply loss of 0.8 million b/d.The unplanned oil supply outage (referred to as outage hereafter) is calculated as a difference between estimated effective production capacity (the level of supply that could be available within one year) and estimated production.

        <p>and unemployment rate ( t ue ). All variables in the model are nonstationary and contain either deterministic trends or stochastic trends. 6 Some studies impose unit root and 5 By adding the world real economic activity index, k t  can be viewed as a clean external instrument which is free of the disturbance from demand side. To verify this point, we carry out a series of Granger causality tests running from the EU's industrial production growth to OPEC and non-OPEC unplanned oil supply outage shocks, respectively. The null hypothesis of non-causality is not rejected when we consider different lags in the model. Furthermore, Hamilton (2019) measures the world economic activity by considering industrial production of main economies in the world. We also replace the t rea to the world production index proposed by Hamilton, the results are not changed. 6 One referee suggests to check the stability of the VAR, we thus use the method proposed by Lütkepohl (1991). According to the results of inverse roots of AR characteristic polynomial, we find that no root lies outside the unit cointegrated relations to pre-test the variables, however Elliott (1998) suggests that this procedure can lead to size distortions. Sims et al. (1990) and Ramey (2016) suggest to estimate the VAR model at logarithms, which presents consistent estimates as well. Sims et al. (1990) also show that a VAR can be estimated in levels if the main interests are IRFs. Therefore, we estimate the benchmark model with log level variables. 7 Besides, unplanned oil supply outage shocks k t  in equation ( 1) are used for identifying exogenous oil supply shocks by using instrumental relevance and exogeneity condition. In our study, we identify both OPEC and non-OPEC oil supply shocks, respectively. Given 1% decrease in t pro , the IRFs of variables in the SVAR system are comparable. The benchmark model is determined as Specifically, we consider the variables of industrial production and CPI at sectoral level circle. Therefore, we believe that the VAR satisfies the stability conditions. The related results are available in Appendix C. 7 The IRFs of the VAR in difference are provided in appendix as well though the patterns are erratic and less informative than the results of the VAR in level. Other studies like Peersman (2022) also built the VAR by using level variables. We also implement typical unit root tests for integrating order and Johansen cointegration test for long-run relationship. The trace test shows that there are cointegrating relation among these five variables. 8 We decide the optimal lags used in the VAR model by considering multiple methods. The conventional wisdom is using information criteria including Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Schwarz information criterion (SIC). However in the baseline model, we determine the optimal lags as 5 by using the lags exclusion testing procedure provided by EViews 10.

Although there are some differences in empirical results when we use different strategies, the main conclusions are not altered.and unemployment rate ( t ue ). All variables in the model are nonstationary and contain either deterministic trends or stochastic trends. 6 Some studies impose unit root and 5 By adding the world real economic activity index, k t  can be viewed as a clean external instrument which is free of the disturbance from demand side. To verify this point, we carry out a series of Granger causality tests running from the EU's industrial production growth to OPEC and non-OPEC unplanned oil supply outage shocks, respectively. The null hypothesis of non-causality is not rejected when we consider different lags in the model. Furthermore, Hamilton (2019) measures the world economic activity by considering industrial production of main economies in the world. We also replace the t rea to the world production index proposed by Hamilton, the results are not changed. 6 One referee suggests to check the stability of the VAR, we thus use the method proposed by Lütkepohl (1991). According to the results of inverse roots of AR characteristic polynomial, we find that no root lies outside the unit cointegrated relations to pre-test the variables, however Elliott (1998) suggests that this procedure can lead to size distortions. Sims et al. (1990) and Ramey (2016) suggest to estimate the VAR model at logarithms, which presents consistent estimates as well. Sims et al. (1990) also show that a VAR can be estimated in levels if the main interests are IRFs. Therefore, we estimate the benchmark model with log level variables. 7 Besides, unplanned oil supply outage shocks k t  in equation ( 1) are used for identifying exogenous oil supply shocks by using instrumental relevance and exogeneity condition. In our study, we identify both OPEC and non-OPEC oil supply shocks, respectively. Given 1% decrease in t pro , the IRFs of variables in the SVAR system are comparable. The benchmark model is determined as Specifically, we consider the variables of industrial production and CPI at sectoral level circle. Therefore, we believe that the VAR satisfies the stability conditions. The related results are available in Appendix C. 7 The IRFs of the VAR in difference are provided in appendix as well though the patterns are erratic and less informative than the results of the VAR in level.

        <p>In this study, the identified exogenous oil supply shocks are defined as one percentage of decrease in oil production. Therefore, this setting allows the empirical results of OPEC and non-OPEC oil supply shocks to be comparable. The empirical results are shown in Figure 2. An unexpected decrease in OPEC and non-OPEC oil production significantly raises real price of oil. The identified exogenous oil supply shocks of OPEC maximumly cause around 2% increase in oil price, but that of non-OPEC makes maximum impacts on oil price around 4%.In this study, the identified exogenous oil supply shocks are defined as one percentage of decrease in oil production.

        <p>As for the median responses of the EU's macroeconomic variables, the industrial production goes down and touches the bottom at around -0.25% before the median response gradually recovers to zero. In addition, the IRFs of CPI given exogenous OPEC shocks persistently drop down, however the exogenous shocks of non-OPEC raise CPI with the maximum impact of 0.08%. That is to say, the IRFs patterns of CPI disagree substantially given OPEC and non-OPEC oil supply shocks. Lastly, the unemployment rate increases around 0.6% and 0.4% after an immediate increase in non-OPEC and OPEC oil supply. The rise in unemployment rate is somewhat more persistent than we expected.As for the median responses of the EU's macroeconomic variables, the industrial production goes down and touches the bottom at around -0.25% before the median response gradually recovers to zero.

        <p>To summarize, the identified exogenous oil supply shocks of OPEC and non-OPEC pull down industrial production with considerably negative impacts. The non-OPEC oil supply shocks make bigger impacts than OPEC oil supply shocks on real price of oil and unemployment rate. The differences are the responses of price level that non-OPEC oil supply shocks make positive impacts but OPEC oil supply shocks make negative effects. One plausible explanation is that the EU countries import more crude oil from non-OPEC countries than from OPEC countries. Previous studies mainly discussed the impacts of OPEC oil supply shocks (Kilian 2007;Känzig, 2021), however the oil supply shocks of non-OPEC countries harm European macroeconomy by decreasing industrial output, raising price level and unemployment rate. 【Figure 2 is here】To summarize, the identified exogenous oil supply shocks of OPEC and non-OPEC pull down industrial production with considerably negative impacts.

        <p>The EU is an energy dependent region, whose energy security is challenged by unexpected energy disruptions from its producers in the last decades due to political disputes, geopolitical risks, extreme events and weather. Since 2000, the EU has dramatically increased its imports from Russia, but reduced its imports from other countries. Some countries even view Russia as their sole oil producer. However, treating Russia as the main oil producer does not satisfy Europe's diplomatic freedom (Acevedo and Lorca-Susino, 2020). If Russia abruptly cuts oil supply to the EU countries, the negative impacts will lead to economic downturn, roaring price and deteriorating labour market. Although the US shares a common value with European countries and has become the largest oil exporter in the world, the oil imports from the US are significantly lower than the needed amount of the EU countries. In other words, the US cannot guarantee necessary oil demand of the EU countries.The EU is an energy dependent region, whose energy security is challenged by unexpected energy disruptions from its producers in the last decades due to political disputes, geopolitical risks, extreme events and weather.

        <p>Seeking another oil supplier which has a common value with the EU countries and sufficient production capacity to supply the EU countries is not an easy task. Due to different locations of each country, the oil infrastructures are also varied across different nations. Some inland countries (e.g. Eastern European countries) do not have large ports for oil tankers instead relying solely on pipelines, which indicates that getting rid of oil dependency on Russia is difficult for certain EU countries. As a consequence, it is crucial for the EU to establish and consolidate a win-win strategic partnership regarding energy issues with non-OPEC oil exporters, especially Russia, despite the geopolitical tensions.Seeking another oil supplier which has a common value with the EU countries and sufficient production capacity to supply the EU countries is not an easy task.

        <p>Enhancing energy security and ensuring market stability should be placed as a priority in both the short and long term. To alleviate the negative influence of unexpected oil supply disruptions of OPEC and non-OPEC oil suppliers, the adoption of alternative energy seems to be a good solution. Under the framework of the European Green Deal, policymakers should consider accelerating the development of energy efficient technologies and the expansion of the utilisation of alternative renewable energy sources, such as biomass, hydropower, geothermal, wind, and solar. This can not only contribute to reduce the oil demand and dependence of the EU-27 countries but also facilitate the green transition. Furthermore, the European Central Bank, the national central banks as well as fiscal authorities of the EU-27 member states should play their part by acting cohesively and decisively in attenuating the potential stagflation problem caused by oil market turbulence.Enhancing energy security and ensuring market stability should be placed as a priority in both the short and long term.

        <p>In the baseline estimates, we focus on the responses of macroeconomic variables at the aggregate level. The sectoral responses could be heterogenous because of its different dependencies of industries on oil consumption. The empirical specifications are the same as the ones used in the baseline models. 2020), the proportion of energy imports to total primary goods imports is nearly 65%. Therefore, it is natural to suspect that the identified exogenous oil supply shocks have a causal impact on the EU's International trade. Specifically, the responses of real effective exchange rate (REER), exports and imports are provided in Figure 10. As we can see from panel (a), a sudden decrease in OEPC oil supply would raise REER but pull down exports and imports. In terms of the unexpected non-OPEC oil supply cuts, the REER first goes up and then drops down before recovering to zero. 【Figure 10 is here】 Financial market. The share price is a leading indicator to reflect potential fluctuations in macroeconomic conditions. Therefore, we compute the IRFs of interest rate and share price, which are plotted in Figure 11. Given one percentage of unexpected decrease in oil supply, the response of interest rate shortly goes up given the OPEC shock. Recall that the identified OPEC oil supply outage shock pulls down CPI, monetary authorities may take into account this point and implement tight monetary policy. However, the IRFs of interest rate given non-OPEC shock is insignificant. These findings suggest that the monetary authorities are more sensitive to the threats of OPEC oil supply shocks. Next, we also consider the responses of share price. The empirical results suggest that non-OPEC oil supply shocks significantly pulls down share price with the magnitude of roughly -2% after the immediate decrease in oil production. In contrast, the median response given OPEC oil supply shocks is not significant over different horizons.In the baseline estimates, we focus on the responses of macroeconomic variables at the aggregate level.

        <p>After presenting the responses of the macroeconomic variables of aggregate EU countries, it is necessary to understand the responses of its member countries. One issue that has been mentioned in McGovern et al. (2020) is that the oil dependency varies across the EU member countries. For countries like Denmark and Italy, they can choose the importing methods by shipping or pipelines. However, some Eastern and Central European countries are highly dependent on Russia's supply. Specifically, the ratio of oil importing sourced from Russia is over 80% for Finland and Slovakia, and above 60% for Bulgaria, Czechia, Hungary, Lithuania and Poland. Therefore, it is natural to suspect that the identified exogenous OPEC and non-OPEC oil supply shocks have heterogeneous impacts on macroeconomic conditions of different member countries.After presenting the responses of the macroeconomic variables of aggregate EU countries, it is necessary to understand the responses of its member countries.

The reasons can be attributed to the different dependency on oil imports. In addition, the location of member countries also matters to a country's oil import structure.

        <p>As can be seen from Figure 12 that depicts the IRFs given OPEC shocks, one consistent finding is that the exogenous OPEC oil supply shocks raise CPI steeply in the short-run and decrease CPI in the long-run. In addition, the unemployment rate of Denmark, Poland and Bulgaria tends to increase as OPEC oil supply suddenly decreases, indicating that economic welfare can be harmed due to exposures to oil supply risk.As can be seen from Figure 12 that depicts the IRFs given OPEC shocks, one consistent finding is that the exogenous OPEC oil supply shocks raise CPI steeply in the short-run and decrease CPI in the long-run.

        <p>Figure 13 presents the IRFs patterns of selected countries given non-OPEC oil supply shocks. For Eastern European countries like Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and Bulgaria, we find that the unexpected decrease in oil supply can result in increased CPI persistently, which is accompanied with reduced purchasing power and standards of living. However, the inflation in France, Germany, Netherlands and Denmark is not escalated given non-OPEC oil shocks. This can be partially explained by the diverse exposure to the risk of oil supply and security of oil imports between North Western and Eastern European countries. On one hand, France, Germany and Denmark are capable of the domestic crude oil production and are equipped with large scale oil storage facility, implying that these countries are more resilient when encountered with sudden disruptions of oil imports. On the other hand, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia are located in the Eastern part of Europe and have limited oil supply options due to landlocked geographical position. As a consequence, these countries are more reliant on oil importing from other countries and suffering from greater exposure to oil supply shocks and subsequent economic instability. Furthermore, Figure 13 shows that non-OPEC oil supply shocks bring down industrial production and elevate unemployment across the selected EU countries, which can cause lowered economic growth and policymakers will have to adjust monetary policy accordingly in response to the economic damage and prevent the economy falling into recession.Figure 13 presents the IRFs patterns of selected countries given non-OPEC oil supply shocks.

As a consequence, these countries are more reliant on oil importing from other countries and suffering from greater exposure to oil supply shocks and subsequent economic instability. Furthermore, Figure 13 shows that non-OPEC oil supply shocks bring down industrial production and elevate unemployment across the selected EU countries, which can cause lowered economic growth and policymakers will have to adjust monetary policy accordingly in response to the economic damage and prevent the economy falling into recession.</p>
        <p>【Figures 12 and 13 are here】 It can be seen that significant heterogeneity exists among the EU-27 states vis-àvis the association between underlying macroeconomic conditions and oil supply shocks. Therefore, policymakers should consider implementing proactive actions by accounting for the heterogenous features of macroeconomic response in order to mitigate the adverse impacts of oil supply shocks and promote energy security across the member states of the EU. Despite the heightened geopolitical instability in the oil exporting countries, we suggest that the authorities in the EU strengthen the capital investment in oil related infrastructure and further expand the adoption of renewable energy in the transition to a green economy.【Figures 12 and 13 are here】 It can be seen that significant heterogeneity exists among the EU-27 states vis-àvis the association between underlying macroeconomic conditions and oil supply shocks.

        <p>This study contributes to existing studies by using unplanned oil supply shocks as an external instrument to identify exogenous oil supply shocks of OPEC and non-OPEC countries. Under a framework of Proxy SVAR model, we compare the impacts of the identified exogenous OPEC and non-OPEC oil supply shocks on European macroeconomy. By utilizing impulse response analysis, forecast-error variance decomposition and historical decomposition, we find that unexpected non-OPEC oil supply cut is more detrimental to the EU's macroeconomy in comparison with the impacts of OPEC oil supply reduction. These findings have important implications to energy security and environmental protections in Europe.This study contributes to existing studies by using unplanned oil supply shocks as an external instrument to identify exogenous oil supply shocks of OPEC and non-OPEC countries.

        <p>The EU is an oil-dependent region, importing its majority of oil from areas suffering from geopolitical tensions, terrorism, border conflicts, or wars. In spite of this, the EU member countries have limited choices to import oil due to the restrictions of location and infrastructure. However, the empirical findings suggest that the identified exogenous non-OPEC oil supply shock is more harmful to European macroeconomic conditions. From the short-term perspective, the detrimental effects of non-OPEC oil supply shocks are unavoidable. Increasing oil imports from OPEC countries is not a good alternative since some OPEC countries are currently disturbed by wars, geopolitical risks (such as Iraq and Iran). Although the US has become the largest oilproducing country in the world and shares a common value with the EU countries, the US does not endorse any commitments of energy related agreements with the EU countries (Acevedo and Lorca-Susino,2020). With the shale gas revolution, the US seems to achieve energy independence and is not disturbed by the trade-off between "energy economic security" and "energy diplomatic freedom". However, the EU countries still need to balance such a trade-off since Russia has served as a main oil supplier to the EU. The governments of the EU countries are suggested to put more emphasis on non-OPEC unplanned oil supply disruptions which are empirically verified as a main threat to the EU's macroeconomy. Note: the confidence intervals are constructed by using a moving block bootstrapping method (Brüggemann et al., 2016) at 68% and 90% significance levels. The horizons are monthly.

        <p>The baseline estimates are built upon an external instrument with one lag in equation (1). The reasons why we choose one lag can be summarized as follows. First, we discard the external instruments whose F statistics are insignificant. Next, when F statistics are significant, we choose the external instrument generated with minimum lags. Thus, this strategy can provide a strong external instrument and ensure sufficient observations in the baseline estimations.The baseline estimates are built upon an external instrument with one lag in equation (1).
