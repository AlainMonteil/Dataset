        <p>Research into new advanced district heating concepts has increased since the first four generations of district heating were defined in 2014. This definition created a common framework for research and industry alike, and pointed to potential futures for district heating which could benefit from lowtemperature heating in buildings. The fully developed fourth-generation district heating includes the cross-sectoral integration into the smart energy system. This paper defines four generations of district cooling to make a similar useful framework for district cooling. The first generation being pipeline refrigeration systems that were first introduced in the late 19th century, the second generation being mainly based on large compression chillers and cold water as distribution fluid, the third generation having a more diversified cold supply such as natural cooling, and the fourth generation combining cooling with other energy sectors sometimes into a renewable energy-based smart energy systems context, including combined heating and cooling.Research into new advanced district heating concepts has increased since the first four generations of district heating were defined in 2014.

        <p>Studies show that district energy systems, such as district heating (DH) and district cooling (DC), allow for a low cost and energy-efficient transition towards renewable energy (RE)-based energy systems [1], enabling, for example, increased flexibility in the operation of energy conversion technologies [2], low-costs storage solutions [3], and the utilisation of otherwise non-utilised energy sources such as excess heat from industries and natural cooling from natural cold sources [4,5].Studies show that district energy systems, such as district heating (DH) and district cooling (DC), allow for a low cost and energy-efficient transition towards renewable energy (RE)-based energy systems [1], enabling, for example, increased flexibility in the operation of energy conversion technologies [2], low-costs storage solutions [3], and the utilisation of otherwise non-utilised energy sources such as excess heat from industries and natural cooling from natural cold sources [4,5].</p>
        <p>Globally, modern commercial DH has been utilised since the 1870s, and has since then expanded to around 80,000 systems delivering a total of around 11.5 EJ of heat in 2014 [6]. DH has especially seen a wide implementation in Russia, China, and the European Union (EU), accounting for around 85% of the globally delivered DH [4]. It is estimated that DH supplies 8% of the global end-user heating demand [4]. Due to the relatively high utilisation and potential for allowing a more fuel-and cost-efficient transition to RE-based energy systems, DH has been the subject of extensive focus within research [7] and is playing an important role in the EU and national energy policies.Globally, modern commercial DH has been utilised since the 1870s, and has since then expanded to around 80,000 systems delivering a total of around 11.5 EJ of heat in 2014 [6].

        <p>Currently, it is estimated that nearly 20% of the total global electricity demand is used for cooling purposes, via air conditioners and electric fans in buildings. Furthermore, the electricity consumption due to cooling is expected to increase due to urbanisation, industrialisation, climate change, and as the standard of living increases globally, with some projecting a tripling of the current electricity demand for cooling [5]. Moreover, uncontrolled use of chillers creates a cooling peak and risk of brown-out. Where DH has seen a relatively wide global utilisation, DC is less utilised for covering cooling demands, only delivering around 300 PJ/year globally [4]. However, DC could provide a more efficient and lowcost option for covering cooling demands, as it allows for, e.g., natural cooling and increased flexibility in the operation of the energy conversion units. Thus, DC could also allow for better integration of RE in the energy system and potentially also for connection to DH systems [5]. Such potentials are already utilised in DH systems [7,8].Currently, it is estimated that nearly 20% of the total global electricity demand is used for cooling purposes, via air conditioners and electric fans in buildings.

        <p>In 2014, the historical and future perspectives of DH were categorized by splitting the historical development into different generations of DH and providing a future perspective on how existing DH schemes could be modernised as well as how the future development of new DH schemes could be understood in this context. This resulted in the definitions of four generations of DH, where each generation was defined by a set of unique features that significantly advanced the technology compared to its predecessor. These generations were typically dominating DH system technology in a 30e50-year period [9].In 2014, the historical and future perspectives of DH were categorized by splitting the historical development into different generations of DH and providing a future perspective on how existing DH schemes could be modernised as well as how the future development of new DH schemes could be understood in this context.

        <p>This division into generations has created a common terminology and framework for research and industry alike that has shown to be useful for vocalising and interpreting both the historical and the future perspectives of DH. The paper defining the first four generations of DH [9] also mentions the potential to make a similar distinction for DC, but only proposes a general idea for the first three generations, and does not include a definition of a potential fourth generation, as it was outside the scope of that paper.This division into generations has created a common terminology and framework for research and industry alike that has shown to be useful for vocalising and interpreting both the historical and the future perspectives of DH.

        <p>The core of DH and DC is that it is an infrastructure that enables cost and energy efficient thermal management of the area that they supply. Both are based on pipe networks connecting thermal sources with thermal sinks. The principal difference between DH and DC is that in DH, heat is being supplied from one or more central heat sources to its connected end-users, heat sinks; while in DC, unwanted heat is removed from the end-users, heat sources, and delivered to central heat sinks. The transport of the heat from one location to another can be achieved with different pipeline mediums, such as water or refrigerants.The core of DH and DC is that it is an infrastructure that enables cost and energy efficient thermal management of the area that they supply.

        <p>Both DH and DC are clear candidates for inclusion into the smart energy system, where thermal, electricity, gas and transportation systems are planned and operated in an integrated fashion to exploit synergies and optimise the flexibility for using RE [10,11] for a carbon-neutral energy supply.Both DH and DC are clear candidates for inclusion into the smart energy system, where thermal, electricity, gas and transportation systems are planned and operated in an integrated fashion to exploit synergies and optimise the flexibility for using RE [10,11] for a carbon-neutral energy supply.</p>
        <p>The aim of this paper is to define different generations of DC to make a useful framework and a consistent vocabulary, as that made for DH, to allow for highlighting the historical development of DC and highlighting important focus areas for the future development of DC into a smart energy systems context. The smart energy system approach is a key facilitator in the cost-efficient transition to carbon-neutral energy systems based on RE, and this paper thus provides a clear vocabulary for energy transition analyses.The aim of this paper is to define different generations of DC to make a useful framework and a consistent vocabulary, as that made for DH, to allow for highlighting the historical development of DC and highlighting important focus areas for the future development of DC into a smart energy systems context.

        <p>First, in Section 2, we review a series of first, second, and third generation DC (1GDC, 2GDC, 3GDC) systems based on a first definition provided in Ref. [9].

        <p>Chapter 4 deliberates if and how former generations of DC can be developed into a fully integrated 4GDC system. In Chapter 5, the definitions of the four generations are revised.

        <p>As with the generations of DH presented in Ref. [9], the generations of DC are defined by the advances in the technologies used for generating and delivering the cold to the customers and the philosophies of operating the DC systems. As with DH, this is in part linked up to temperature levels, but also highly related to main technological choices and developments.As with the generations of DH presented in Ref.

        <p>1GDC became the pipeline refrigeration systems that were introduced in the USA in the late 19th century [12,13]. These systems either used pressurized ammonia or brine solutions as distribution fluids.1GDC became the pipeline refrigeration systems that were introduced in the USA in the late 19th century [12,13].

        <p>The first ammonia system was implemented in Denver in 1889 by the Colorado Automatic Refrigerating Company [14,15]. The cold was created by an absorption chiller of about 105 kW and it used a three-pipe distribution system. The purpose was to supply cold to a storage warehouse with about 1400 m 3 capacity. Liquid ammonia ran through the distribution pipes connected to 29 cold boxes in the warehouse. Each of the boxes had an expansion process at the entrance, expanding ammonia, thus reducing it to lower temperatures appropriate for the cooling process. The cold ammonia could then be evaporated while absorbing heat from the cold box.The first ammonia system was implemented in Denver in 1889 by the Colorado Automatic Refrigerating Company [14,15].

        <p>For the customers, piped refrigeration offered convenience at favourable costs. The alternative was mainly systems based on ice deliveries; however, such systems required space, gave off moisture to the air, were difficult to regulate, and had difficulty obtaining low temperatures. Piped refrigeration systems, in contrast, did not take up space, provided dry air, could be regulated by adjusting the expansion valve and could even provide freezing [16]. The Denver system was soon abandoned, but a similar system established in St Louis in 1890 survived until the 1960s, when it was unable to afford the relocation of its pipes to avoid a new highway [17]. In this system, comfort cooling was applied for the first time besides the commercial cooling application, but just for demonstration.For the customers, piped refrigeration offered convenience at favourable costs.

        <p>The brine distribution method was established in underground pipes by the Manhattan Refrigeration Company in 1906 in a New York city district with a power plant and nine cold storage warehouses [18]. This system paved the path for the cooling of large warehouses, small market buildings, ships, etc. in New York and was in operation until 1979.The brine distribution method was established in underground pipes by the Manhattan Refrigeration Company in 1906 in a New York city district with a power plant and nine cold storage warehouses [18].

        <p>Hence, these systems delivered mainly refrigeration services to concentrated market areas within the food supply chain. According to a later review [19], other pipeline refrigeration systems were also established in Boston, Los Angeles, Kansas City, Baltimore, Washington DC, Philadelphia, Atlantic City, Seattle, Minneapolis, and Phoenix.Hence, these systems delivered mainly refrigeration services to concentrated market areas within the food supply chain.

        <p>2GDC was introduced in the 1960s and 1970s by exploiting the economy of scale effects of using few large compression chillers (and maybe some absorption chillers or river cooling as supplement in a few cases) instead of many small chillers for comfort cooling purposes. The first system was established in the central business district of Hartford, USA, in 1962, [20e22]. This system used both absorption and compression chillers and introduced cold storage in 1986. Both the absorption and compression chillers were driven by steam from the company's district steam system, thus providing a synergy between heating and cooling.2GDC was introduced in the 1960s and 1970s by exploiting the economy of scale effects of using few large compression chillers (and maybe some absorption chillers or river cooling as supplement in a few cases) instead of many small chillers for comfort cooling purposes.

        <p>The first major European DC system was established in 1967 in the Courbevoie, Nanterre, and Puteaux areas, the western suburbs of Paris, [23]. It serves many office buildings in the La D efense area and two interconnected networks are currently operated jointly by the Enertherm and SOC companies. The system provides the cooling demand of 1.5 million m 2 of business space. The cooling medium is chilled water produced by a mixture of compression chillers and free cooling from the Seine and is transferred through pre-insulated pipes in underground tunnels.The first major European DC system was established in 1967 in the Courbevoie, Nanterre, and Puteaux areas, the western suburbs of Paris, [23].

        <p>The first German DC system was established in 1968 and still serves an office area in Northern Hamburg, originally 16 shareholders involved with 18 associated administration buildings [24,25]. This was also presented in an early global DC overview [26]. The system's capacity was later expanded in several stages by adding new chillers and expanding the pipe network. The cold supply consists of mainly electrically-driven single-and doublestage turbo-compressors.The first German DC system was established in 1968 and still serves an office area in Northern Hamburg, originally 16 shareholders involved with 18 associated administration buildings [24,25].

        <p>The first major Japanese DC system was established in 1971 for the Regional City Hall area in the Shinjuku district, Tokyo, by supplying cooling to several skyscrapers with a total capacity of 210 MW. This combined district heating and cooling (CHC) system has a complex heat and cold generation system that includes some natural gas-driven CHP plants and boilers as well as a number of electrical and heat-driven chillers [27,28].The first major Japanese DC system was established in 1971 for the Regional City Hall area in the Shinjuku district, Tokyo, by supplying cooling to several skyscrapers with a total capacity of 210 MW.

        <p>These 2GDC systems based on economy-of-scale have inspired the implementation of large DC systems both in the Middle East [29,30] and China [31,32].

        <p>In general, in 2GDC, the philosophy changes from a food industry focus towards supplying cooling for comfort purposes.

        <p>One early initiative was the formation of the Climespace system in the Paris city centre in 1991 [36]. At the formation, the central Les Halles cooling plant from 1978 was included as a valuable capacity asset. Later, the Seine river was added as a heat sink. The cold is generated in ten cold supply plants that can utilise a cold storage capacity of 140 MWh. This system has currently the highest annual cold delivery capacity among all DCs in Europe, almost 500 GWh per year.One early initiative was the formation of the Climespace system in the Paris city centre in 1991 [36].

        <p>Another large European system is the Stockholm system established in 1995 that is dominated by cold supply obtained from the large heat pumps providing heat to the DH system [37,38]. Today, the system supplies cooling for both comfort cooling (in malls and buildings) and process cooling (for computer sites, refrigerating/freezing equipment, etc.). The Stockholm DC systems include several smaller and larger cold supply stations based on a variety of technologies, such as compression and absorption chillers (27%), free seawater cooling (18%), and waste cooling from heat pumps (55%). The large Hornsberg rock cavern acts as a cold storage for counteracting the daily variation in the deliveries [39].Another large European system is the Stockholm system established in 1995 that is dominated by cold supply obtained from the large heat pumps providing heat to the DH system [37,38].

        <p>In the Gothenburg system, also established in 1995, the cold supply is instead dominated by absorption chillers based on an abundance of local waste heat from a waste incineration plant and two refineries that is made available via the Gothenburg DH system [40]. Natural cooling is also supplied from a river if the temperature is sufficiently low ( 5 C). Otherwise, the rest is supplied by a group of absorption (connected to DH) and compression chillers. Overall, the average share of the river is 22%, while 47% and 31% are provided by absorption and compression chillers, respectively.In the Gothenburg system, also established in 1995, the cold supply is instead dominated by absorption chillers based on an abundance of local waste heat from a waste incineration plant and two refineries that is made available via the Gothenburg DH system [40].

        <p>The Helsinki system, first established in 1998, utilises mainly the large Katri Vala heating and cooling plant for cold supply [41,42]. This system has by 2020 been extended to 562 buildings and 90 km of trench length. The cold supply consists of seven heat pumps (85 MW in total), ten heat-driven absorption chillers (35 MW in total), two compression chillers (10 MW in total), and seawater cooling (70 MW). The system includes two cold storages in rock caverns having a total volume of 37,000 m 3 . This is a true example of a smart energy system in which heat and cold are supplied in a sustainable way mainly by a set of bi-functional heat pumps. The heat pumps receive the return water from the DC network at 16e18 C as well as purified sewage water and cool it down to 4 C for cold supply. The condensers of the heat pumps also supply heat to the DH system.The Helsinki system, first established in 1998, utilises mainly the large Katri Vala heating and cooling plant for cold supply [41,42].

        <p>The Copenhagen system established in 2010 applies a combination of compression chillers and seawater cooling [43]. This system is known as the Hofor DC system with 52 MW cooling capacity for 62 large buildings with 1.1 million m 2 floor area. This system has seawater as the main source of cooling, providing all cooling during the winter. During the rest of the year, a combination of seawater cooling, twelve ammonia compression chillers, and one absorption chiller perform the cooling supply mission.The Copenhagen system established in 2010 applies a combination of compression chillers and seawater cooling [43].

        <p>These Nordic examples have all implemented some proportion of natural cooling sources based on sea or river waters. Some other third-generation systems use natural cooling sources to a very high degree as early initiatives for decarbonised comfort cooling [44,45]. Natural cooling can significantly reduce the electricity used for cooling in these cases, compared to conventional air conditioning with both small and large compression chillers. Three typical early cases that use lake water for cooling are Cornell University in the USA, Toronto in Canada, and Geneva in Switzerland. One typical case that uses seawater cooling is Dalian, China.These Nordic examples have all implemented some proportion of natural cooling sources based on sea or river waters.

        <p>At Cornell University in the USA, a DC system based on lake water has been in operation since 2000 [46,47]. Here, 4e5 C water extracted from the Cayuga Lake at a depth of about 75 m is the main source of cooling to the university campus. The cold water is pumped up to the lake's surface, where the main heat exchange unit of the DC system is located, transferring cold energy to the secondary side through a 3.7 km long pipeline. The DC water supply and return temperatures are about 7 C and 15 C, respectively. The heat extracted from the cooling process is rejected to the lake by a return flow of a temperature between 9 and 13 C.At Cornell University in the USA, a DC system based on lake water has been in operation since 2000 [46,47].

        <p>Since 2004, Toronto has used Lake Ontario's water to provide 260 MW cooling to some office buildings, the Metro Convention Centre, etc., [47e50]. This system is indeed a combination of natural (main) and artificial (supplementary) cooling, where the lake's cold water performs the first step of the cooling of the return water, which enters at 20 C and leaves at 5 C for the second cooling step, where a chiller decreases the water temperature further down to about 3 C. This cooling supply system is also integrated with the city's potable water supply. This required a new intake, where the lake's water, after being used for cooling the DC water, is further treated before being supplied to the city's potable water system.Since 2004, Toronto has used Lake Ontario's water to provide 260 MW cooling to some office buildings, the Metro Convention Centre, etc., [47e50].

        <p>These 3GDC systems can be characterized by a high degree of diversity in the cold supply from natural cooling, absorption chillers, cold recovery from heat pumps aimed for heating, compression chillers, and short-term cold storage units for balancing hourly cold loads and moving cooling generation from day to night hours. These systems have pronounced merit order rankings like DH and electricity systems. The synergies between DC and CHP are sometimes utilised by using absorption chillers in Combined Cooling, Heating and Power (CCHP) configurations, also known as trigeneration [57].These 3GDC systems can be characterized by a high degree of diversity in the cold supply from natural cooling, absorption chillers, cold recovery from heat pumps aimed for heating, compression chillers, and short-term cold storage units for balancing hourly cold loads and moving cooling generation from day to night hours.

        <p>With natural cooling being a part of more 3GDC systems, one aspect needs to be addressed. Natural cooling will increase the temperature of the body of water where heat is dissipated, with an environmental impact depending on the resource size and the cooling demand. However, theoretical analyses for Switzerland, as presented by Gaudard et al. [58], and an actual monitoring programme from Cornell University's DC system [59] both show limited impacts. Consideration should also be given to the alternative which would often be electricity-based systems with cooling demands for power stations, though cooling would not necessarily take place into the water bodies supplying natural cooling for DC systems.With natural cooling being a part of more 3GDC systems, one aspect needs to be addressed.

        <p>A common denominator for 3GDC is that the focus is increasingly on using what is locally available as well as phasing out refrigerants with high ozone layer depletion characteristics. In Scandinavia, the systems are even further based on energy efficiency as the waste heat is recycled into the local DH grids.

        <p>The main track for early 4GDC systems has been to exploit the CHC synergy by using both ends of a heat pump simultaneously or by using a combination of a separate heat pump and a separate chiller working in parallel. This is achieved by using the heat surplus obtained from cooling for covering heating demands and the surplus cold obtained from heating for covering cooling demands. Simultaneous use requires that heating and cooling demands appear simultaneously and that cooling demands are rather high compared to heating demands. But seasonal storages can also be used for storing cold from the heat pump during the winter for later use during the summer and by storing low-temperature heat from the chiller during the summer to the winter. This annual cycle of storing both heat and cold can be supported by using extensive centralised low-temperature aquifer or borehole thermal energy storages. The use of thermal storage units when exploiting the CHC synergy makes these 4GDC systems well prepared for the integration into a smart energy system where flexibility helps integrate variable RE sources.The main track for early 4GDC systems has been to exploit the CHC synergy by using both ends of a heat pump simultaneously or by using a combination of a separate heat pump and a separate chiller working in parallel.

        <p>Even if it is not possible to generate all heat and cold in CHC with or without seasonal storage, this combined utilisation of the capital-intensive heat pump is profitable. Having generated CHC as much as possible it is very profitable to generate additional heat or cold, as the heat pump is already available. It will in most cases be profitable generating additional heating while dumping the cold into an ambient energy sink. The same ambient source, e.g., sea water or wastewater can be used as cold sink in winter and heat sink in summer. See, e.g., the Taarnby case detailed later in this section, where it is very profitable to generate additional heat with the wastewater as a cold sink. Even in rare cases in which the heat market price is low and the electricity price is large, the wastewater can be used as a heat sink in summer.Even if it is not possible to generate all heat and cold in CHC with or without seasonal storage, this combined utilisation of the capital-intensive heat pump is profitable.

        <p>The CHC synergy can either be implemented with centralised or decentralised cold supply. At centralised cold supply, the heat and cold distributions are applied with separate DC and DH networks. At decentralised cold supply, the heat and cold distributions are applied with one common network with temperatures close to the network temperatures applied in DC systems. The cold supply is then created by decentralised heat pumps used for heating. But these decentralised heat and cold supplies can also be supported by centralised heat and cold supplies for balancing hourly heat and cold demands. Hence, 4GDC systems can often have a mixture of centralised and decentralised cold supplies.

This system interconnects the local cooling network of a large wholesale market for flowers and vegetables with 70 individual consumers (15,000 m 2 ) using two electric compression chillers. Some of these consumers need 0 C room temperature and therefore the supply temperature for DC has to be À8 C, while the rest can be supplied with 8 C supply temperature.The first stage of the Danish Høje Taastrup case was implemented in 2016 [63,64].

        <p>The centralised CHC principle has also been used since 2020 in the new Taarnby system located in the Kastrup business district in Denmark [65e68]. In this case, a large-scale heat pump integrates the existing DH system with a newly established local DC network. The heat pump's capacity for cold and heat supply is about 4.5 and 6.5 MW, respectively. In addition, the system enables exploiting synergies across more sectors such as the electricity system (heat pump is electric driven), a wastewater treatment plant nearby (treated wastewater is cold sink in winter and could be heat sink in summer, and not least, the plant is located at the wastewater treatment plant), and the groundwater (as a supplement cooling source up to 2.8 MW). The system also takes advantage of 2000 m 3 cold water storage, giving flexibility for smarter interaction with the electricity grid.The centralised CHC principle has also been used since 2020 in the new Taarnby system located in the Kastrup business district in Denmark [65e68].

        <p>When using the decentralised CHC variant, heat is supplied by local heat pumps at the customer substation by extracting a flow from the return pipe and releasing it colder to the supply pipe.

The 7 km intermediate pipe network is a three-pipe system, including an insulated pipe for warm water delivery, and two uninsulated ones for cold water supply and return pipe. The supplied warm and cold water is regulated to the desired temperature at the end-user sites by each of the four cluster heat pumps.

        <p>The H€ onggerberg campus of ETH in Zürich started in 2013 to convert its traditional heat and cold supply by using the CHC synergy [71]. The transition is planned to be finalised in 2026. The ETH buildings will then be heated by several decentralised heat pumps integrated with geothermal storage units and a waste heat recovery loop of buildings and laboratories obtained from the cooling side. The heat and cold are currently distributed by three closed loops of pipes for carrying warm, cold and free cooling/waste heat water flows with varying temperatures during the year (from 8 C to 24 C). For the geothermal storages, the aim is to reach 8 C/4 C temperature level at the end of the winter and 24 C/20 C at the end of the summer, enabling very efficient heat and cold supplies by the five cluster-level decentralised heat pumps.The H€ onggerberg campus of ETH in Zürich started in 2013 to convert its traditional heat and cold supply by using the CHC synergy [71].

In addition to this, the heat pumps provide cooling to the two data centres.

        <p>Saclay University in Paris started to implement the CHC synergy in 2017 [74,75]. Their district energy networks combine RE, two low-temperature exchange networks, and heat storage units in its low-energy buildings. Some of the key factors contributing to the success of this CHC project include a mutualisation of operation and investment costs, secured future energy sales, an adequate level of subsidies based on robust criteria, a political willingness to develop the project, and management by a dedicated fully empowered local authority. The supply chain of this case includes seven semicentralised heat pump stations at cluster level and additional natural gas boilers for heat supply as well as two 700 m geothermal wells, where the production well supplies heat at 25 -30 C. The district energy system of the campus has cluster substations in which heat pumps provide both chilled and hot water to fulfil the thermal demands of the building blocks. Besides, the cluster substations are equipped with heat exchangers that recover the excess cooling and heating of the buildings. The maximum heat and cold supply capacities of the system are 37 MW and 10 MW, respectively, and the total annual heat and cold production/consumption are 40 GWh and 10 GWh.Saclay University in Paris started to implement the CHC synergy in 2017 [74,75]. Their district energy networks combine RE, two low-temperature exchange networks, and heat storage units in its low-energy buildings. Some of the key factors contributing to the success of this CHC project include a mutualisation of operation and investment costs, secured future energy sales, an adequate level of subsidies based on robust criteria, a political willingness to develop the project, and management by a dedicated fully empowered local authority. The supply chain of this case includes seven semicentralised heat pump stations at cluster level and additional natural gas boilers for heat supply as well as two 700 m geothermal wells, where the production well supplies heat at 25 -30 C.

        <p>The bulk of cooling demands in buildings worldwide is supplied by individual solutions [5]. Transitioning existing individual cooling solutions towards 4GDC is an obvious important step to allow for increased use of DC. But it is very difficult to do in a commercial way, as the fixed costs of the individual chillers in buildings are substantial, and since commercial building owners often make investment planning for a short period of time, e.g. 7 years. Moreover, the cooling demand is in general not measured directly and only accounted for in terms of monthly or daily electricity consumption.The bulk of cooling demands in buildings worldwide is supplied by individual solutions [5].

[76] four implementation steps for suitable areas to transition from individual cooling solutions to 4GDC (here paraphrased and expanded from the original source):</p>
        <p>Step 1: Interconnecting buildings with a network saving production capacity; thus going from individual cooling solutions of a single building, to combining these buildings in a cooling network. Often some buildings have excess cooling capacity, and the newest and largest chillers can supply other buildings and thereby expensive reinvestments in smaller chillers can be avoided. Once several buildings are connected, it is possible to measure the actual cooling demand and its time-varying loads. The aggregated load information enables the estimation of the potential for implementation of large tanks with chilled water for optimising the operation.Step 1: Interconnecting buildings with a network saving production capacity; thus going from individual cooling solutions of a single building, to combining these buildings in a cooling network.

        <p>The transition from Steps 1 to 4 will also stimulate a more efficient use of end-user installations and thereby increase the supply temperature, e.g., from 6 to 10 C, which will open for more efficient sources in the final two steps.The transition from Steps 1 to 4 will also stimulate a more efficient use of end-user installations and thereby increase the supply temperature, e.g., from 6 to 10 C, which will open for more efficient sources in the final two steps.</p>
        <p>The transition strategy presented by Dyrelund and Bigum was inspired by a feasibility study for a large campus owner, who had information on all buildings and a 7-year budget for reinvestments and O&amp;M costs. In the base case, the campus had 24 chiller plants and corresponding cold water networks, of which one large plant was vital for the process and one was new. By investing in new chilled water pipes connecting the local networks, instead of reinvesting in chillers, it would be possible to expand the system and implement the most important 1st step. It turned out that three to four existing large chillers might be able to supply the whole system and that a chilled water tank most likely would be more cost-effective than a new chiller.The transition strategy presented by Dyrelund and Bigum was inspired by a feasibility study for a large campus owner, who had information on all buildings and a 7-year budget for reinvestments and O&amp;M costs.

        <p>The transition strategy could inspire energy planners and local stakeholders on how to get started in a commercial business district with 24 individual building owners, which each have their own existing chiller plant. For commercial reasons, a building owner will only be interested in joining a DC system in the case that the chiller is abraded and the DC company can deliver capacity and cold energy at a competitive price or in the case that the chiller plant has excess capacity and lifetime, and the DC company will buy capacity and cold energy at a favourable price.The transition strategy could inspire energy planners and local stakeholders on how to get started in a commercial business district with 24 individual building owners, which each have their own existing chiller plant.

        <p>In some cases, the DC company passes all four steps and goes directly to the 4GDC. An example is the Taarnby case presented in the previous section, which moreover benefits from sector integration. This cost-effective sector integration between DH, DC, sewage, sewage treatment plant, ground source cooling, and electricity turned out to be a natural solution for the publicly owned multi-utility Taarnby Forsyning [66e68]. Interestingly, there are in fact several levels of integration in this case. Treated sewage may be used as a heat source, treated sewage may be used as a heat sink for excess heat from the CHC and the plant could be located at the sewage treatment plant. In case the project had been divided between several commercial companies, the realised synergies between the sectors would have been difficult to exploit.In some cases, the DC company passes all four steps and goes directly to the 4GDC.

        <p>A previous transition case is found in the Missouri State University DC network. Here, many existing chillers were simply connected to one common network [77], thus composing a system of decentralised cold supply for several end-users and a unified network of pipes. By 2005, the university campus had multiple buildings, each of which had its own individual chillers for air conditioning, while the whole campus was supplied already by a DH network. The university then decided to connect a series of these decentralised cold supply units and make a DC network across a large part of the campus. In this way, despite the added service and maintenance costs compared to a solution based on a central production plant, a low-investment cost DC solution could be implemented by utilising existing pumps and installation at the locations. This Missouri State University system now delivers cold at 6 C with a return temperature of 14 C to a design-load of 14 MW. The system applies absorption chillers drawing on waste heat from power generation [78] as well as a mixture of direct expansion units, centrifugal chillers, gas-fired steam-driven absorption chillers, and air-cooled chillers.A previous transition case is found in the Missouri State University DC network.

        <p>For increasing the energy efficiency and convenience of cold storages in the US in the late 19th century, collective pipeline refrigeration systems were introduced. These systems formed the basis of what we call DC systems today. Lund et al. [9] defined the first generation of DC as: "The first generation was the pipeline refrigeration systems introduced in the late 19th century.

        <p>With the shift in the 1960s to comfort cooling as the principal service of the DC, the distributing fluid was changed to water and large compression chillers were established as the main tools for generating the cold. Lund et al. [9] defined the second generation of DC as: "The second generation became the district cooling systems introduced in the 1960s based on large compression chillers and cold water as distribution fluid".With the shift in the 1960s to comfort cooling as the principal service of the DC, the distributing fluid was changed to water and large compression chillers were established as the main tools for generating the cold.

        <p>The next major change came in the 1990s, where the cold supply was diversified by introducing multiple new cooling sources, such as cold from absorption chillers and various natural cold sources. Refrigerants with high ozone layer depletion potential were phased out and some heat recovery from compression chillers was introduced as well as short-term cold storages. Lund et al. [9] defined the 3GDC as: "The third technology generation constitutes a more diversified cold supply based on absorption chillers, compression chillers with or without heat recovery, natural cooling from lakes, excess cold streams, and cold storages.

        <p>The three first generations can be understood mainly on their differences in their distribution fluids and cold generating and storage facilities. Looking forward, using these previous generations of DC, alongside the needs of future energy systems transitioning towards increasing levels of RE, 4GDC can be defined.The three first generations can be understood mainly on their differences in their distribution fluids and cold generating and storage facilities.

        <p>The major driver for the 4GDC is the cross-sectoral integration into the smart energy system including the exploitation of the CHC synergy wherever appropriate. The focus is on using the heat surplus obtained from cooling during the summer for covering heating demands during the winter and using the cold surplus from heat pump-based heating during the winter for covering cooling demands during the summer. The extensive use of long-term thermal storages in this generation provides a high degree of flexibility that facilitates smart integration with other energy sectors. This smart integration facilitates the integration of variable RE sources e and thus facilitates the transition to carbon-neutral RE-based energy systems.The major driver for the 4GDC is the cross-sectoral integration into the smart energy system including the exploitation of the CHC synergy wherever appropriate.

        <p>A comparison between the four DC generations is shown in Fig. 1. The diagram illustrates the typically applied technologies of each generation and the period of best available technology. However, it should be emphasized that the DC generations are not consecutive in the same way as the DH generations are, in the sense that newer generations make older generations unequivocally obsolete.

        <p>As shown in Fig. 1, a key characteristic or driver of 1GDC was the piped nature of the system, which provided convenience for customers over alternative systems of the time. Characteristics e or indeed drivers -of 2GDC are economy of scale and a safer distribution medium. For 3GDC, a driver was a decrease in electricity usage through diversification by also using waste heat as input to absorption chillers with a corresponding decrease in environmental impact. 4GDC has been driven by smart energy system integration, which improves the opportunities to utilise RE in the energy system, while also resulting more directly in a lowered primary energy supply through the reuse of waste heat from chillers for heat supply. 2GDC, 3GDC and 4GDC have naturally retained some of the convenience of the piped system introduced with 1GDC systems, though alternatives for later systems are not as impractical as the alternatives for 1GDC. In this respect, DC shares some customer benefits in terms of convenience with DH [80].As shown in Fig. 1, a key characteristic or driver of 1GDC was the piped nature of the system, which provided convenience for customers over alternative systems of the time.

        <p>As opposed to 1GDC, 2GDC-4GDC exhibit a more decentralised nature. This is due to an organic development of the systems, limited scale benefits after a certain size and the circumstance that single-point supply systems would lead to very large pipe diameters. Heat gains in pipes are not a main driver for decentralised supply.As opposed to 1GDC, 2GDC-4GDC exhibit a more decentralised nature.

        <p>Regarding efficiency, a tentative increase is indicated in Fig. 1; however, this is not a main issue of this article. Also, when comparing simple conversion systems to more complex systems drawing on sector integration, the use of excess heat for heating purposes, natural cooling and more, a simple efficiency consideration does not suffice. Some specific technologies may even be less efficient than their predecessors, however, through exploiting other synergies, the transition would still be favourable from an energy system's perspective.Regarding efficiency, a tentative increase is indicated in Fig. 1; however, this is not a main issue of this article.

        <p>A main criterion for performance is thus rather the cost effectiveness of DC for the society, taking into account local conditions and the dynamics of the energy system as well as the DC system's ability to form part of a RE-based energy system.

        <p>The main reflection is that historically DC systems have been under development and still need to be in the future. The current context of fossil fuel-based energy systems will change, and DC systems have to adjust with a focus on increasing energy efficiency at the same time as providing flexibility to the overall energy system.The main reflection is that historically DC systems have been under development and still need to be in the future.

        <p>The main features of each generation define the four generations. Central refrigeration for the food supply chain was the main feature of 1GDC, while economy-of-scale with large chillers for comfort cooling in dense city centres was the main driver for 2GDC. Interaction in diversified systems became the main characteristics of 3GDC. The main feature of 4GDC is the smart energy systems Fig. 1. The four generations of DC. The major driver for the 4GDC is the cross-sectoral integration into the RES-based smart energy system including the exploitation of the CHC synergy wherever appropriate. Depending on the context, a 4GDC system may not include all the shown components. E.g. in climatic zones with no heat demand, current 2GDC systems may upgrade to 4GDC systems simply by integrating with other sectors and providing flexibility to the smart energy systems using solar, wind, and wave power [79]. integration including the possible exploitation of the CHC synergy. Hence, 4GDC can be characterised as DC with flexible system integrated load and storage management in possible combination with heat recycling, giving a competitive advantage when both heat and cold are required.The main features of each generation define the four generations.

        <p>Where consecutive generations of DH replaced the previous for DH, this pattern is no as clear for DC generations, as briefly touched upon in Section 5. The 1GDC is now outdated, but with regard to the three following generations, their core technologies will likely appear simultaneously at different locations for many years. Their core technologies and concepts are more related to the different climate zones of the Earth. The 2GDC concepts are mostly used in the subtropical and tropical zones where cold demands are high and heat demands are low. In the temperate zone with rather cold winters, 3GDC concepts are used, since both natural cold resources and DH systems are available in this climate zone. The early 4GDC systems have emerged on the border between the temperate and subtropical zones with both cold and heat demands.Where consecutive generations of DH replaced the previous for DH, this pattern is no as clear for DC generations, as briefly touched upon in Section 5.

Their core technologies and concepts are more related to the different climate zones of the Earth. The 2GDC concepts are mostly used in the subtropical and tropical zones where cold demands are high and heat demands are low. In the temperate zone with rather cold winters, 3GDC concepts are used, since both natural cold resources and DH systems are available in this climate zone. The early 4GDC systems have emerged on the border between the temperate and subtropical zones with both cold and heat demands.</p>
        <p>Common for the future development of DC systems in all climatic zones is that, along with the green transition, fossil fuels will be replaced by RE-based electricity sources and thus a need arises for a smart energy system cross-sectoral integration. Thus, current 2GDC and 3GDC systems may evolve into 4GDC systems simply by adding thermal storage and using it in the active integration of renewable electricity.Common for the future development of DC systems in all climatic zones is that, along with the green transition, fossil fuels will be replaced by RE-based electricity sources and thus a need arises for a smart energy system cross-sectoral integration.

        <p>Moreover, the CHC synergy should be included in relevant climatic zones. Heat recycling was initially not identified as a possibility in the first three DC generations, since the heat removed by cooling was always rejected to the atmosphere as waste heat. The early adopters of heat recycling became the 3GDC systems in Stockholm, Helsinki, and Geneva, when they started to exploit the CHC synergy. Beyond new 4GDC systems, heat recycling may also be introduced in 2GDC and 3GDC systems for future heat supply to suitable local heat demands in the vicinity of these systems.Moreover, the CHC synergy should be included in relevant climatic zones.

        <p>Short-term storages for counteracting daily cold load variations were initially not implemented in early 2GDC systems. Later, the load management benefits of these storages were recognised, and several installations followed. They also became vital parts of most 3GDC systems.Short-term storages for counteracting daily cold load variations were initially not implemented in early 2GDC systems.

        <p>The choice of centralised or decentralised cold supply in new 4GDC systems is currently not obvious. Both options have their pros and cons. The choices of cluster-level heat pumps for heating in the decentralised variant examples presented in Section 3 indicate that smaller building-level heat pumps and chillers currently may be too expensive for this application. The heat supply by heat pumps in the decentralised variant is not so flexible, since no major heat storage beyond the thermal mass in buildings is normally available for the requested temperature level after the heat pump. Hence, this heat supply variant is bound to use electricity at all times, giving a lower possibility for integration with the rest of the smart energy system, which to an increasing extent will be RE-based and decarbonised. The importance of the decarbonisation of the cooling systems is emphasized by the expected growth in this field [5].The choice of centralised or decentralised cold supply in new 4GDC systems is currently not obvious.

        <p>In the centralised variant, both heat and cold storages are normally available, providing high flexibility for both services. On the other hand, it is more productive to just use one pair of distribution pipes for both cooling and heating in the decentralised version than using four parallel pipes in the centralised version. The temperature lift is also higher in the centralised version, since the heat pump must overcome the whole temperature difference between the DH and DC systems, giving lower energy efficiency for the heat pump process.In the centralised variant, both heat and cold storages are normally available, providing high flexibility for both services.

        <p>When categorising district energy, it is important to split the infrastructure into the two principal services that are delivered via the infrastructure. Historically, the principal services have been heating and cooling, which form the basis for DH and DC. Within each principal branch of district energy, the concept can be further branched into generations. These are defined based on pivotal moments where unique characteristics and features have catapulted the technology forward. Preceding and following such pivotal moments, a high level of innovation and experiments tends to sow the seed for the next level of development. While it is relatively simple to identify past pivotal moments, one has to be careful when defining the future of the technology, as the aim should not be to include every potential future scenario, but to identify the key features of today's advanced systems that separate them from the past and will, with high probability, be the key features in systems built in the decades to come. With the uncertain future in mind, there is a dilemma in what to include, and what not. A too wide definition of a category will generalise and dilute the specific characteristics, while a too narrow definition will end up in loss of the bigger picture.When categorising district energy, it is important to split the infrastructure into the two principal services that are delivered via the infrastructure.

        <p>To conclude, this paper has presented the first real definition of DC generations with the objective of establishing a well-founded discussion platform for DC systems and highlighting the potential development/improvement of existing DC systems, based on knowledge of the historical best in DC systems. For new system developments, both by utilities and energy transition planners, this work provides a relevant entry point on which to define and contemplate possible DC and energy system pathways.To conclude, this paper has presented the first real definition of DC generations with the objective of establishing a well-founded discussion platform for DC systems and highlighting the potential development/improvement of existing DC systems, based on knowledge of the historical best in DC systems.
