        <p>Polyacrylonitrile and its TiO 2 composites were electrospun into nanofibers in N, N'-dimethylformamide for photocatalysis and antifouling experiments. The resultants nanofibers were characterized using field emission scanning microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and contact angle analyses. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the formation of polyacrylonitrile-TiO 2 composite nanofibers with their diameter ranging from 10 to 340 nm. The x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results indicate the formation of O-Ti-C bonds on polyacrylonitrile-TiO 2 matrix. polyacrylonitrile-TiO 2 and polyacrylonitrile nanofiber surfaces showed superhydrophobicity with water contact angle of 155 ± 1 and 154 ± 1, respectively at 120 s. The photocatalytic properties of polyacrylonitrile nanofibers and polyacrylonitrile-TiO 2 nanofibers were investigated under a simulated visible light source of 1000 W/m 2 using methylene blue. About 90% of methylene blue was degraded within 3 h of exposure using polyacrylonitrile-TiO 2 nanofibers while 55% methylene blue degradation was achieved for polyacrylonitrile nanofibers. Photoluminescence experiment conducted on both materials showed that polyacrylonitrile-TiO 2 could produce OH radicals 10-fold compared to polyacrylonitrile nanofibers. Antimicrobial tests were conducted using E. coli and Bacillus sp. The results showed that only polyacrylonitrile-TiO 2 under visible light hindered the growth of these bacteria with a greater effect on the Gram-positive bacterium, Bacillus sp. The photo-degradation and microbial growth inhibition properties of polyacrylonitrile-TiO 2 showed that the material could be used as an antifouling material under visible light.Polyacrylonitrile and its TiO 2 composites were electrospun into nanofibers in N, N'-dimethylformamide for photocatalysis and antifouling experiments.

        <p>Wastewater is full of contaminants, such as organic and inorganic compounds, bacteria and their toxins. Membrane processes are one of the key components of wastewater reclamation [1]. In membrane treatment of wastewater, the problem of fouling arises. Fouling includes accumulation of chemical molecules (chemical fouling) and biological organisms (biofouling) on the membrane. The fouling could be because of macro organic compounds, or organisms, or both depending on the application of the membrane. One major organic foulant is dye molecules. Dye molecules tend to accumulate over time and eventually block the membrane. Fouling of membranes by dye molecules is a major problem to resolve in textile industries [2,3]. In marine industries, however, biofouling is recognized as a threat as it affects the economy and the functionality of equipment [4]. Biofouling is defined as the accumulation or adsorption of micro-or macro-organisms on surfaces of materials [5,6]. Unlike dye molecules that can be removed using low pH feed water, biofoulants are so recalcitrant that when they are removed by pre-treatment of the feed water, there are still enough microbes left to grow by utilizing biodegradable substances [5]. Altogether, the impact of fouling leads to significant economic impacts, with previous work estimating the costs of biofouling and biofouling control to be as high as 30% of the plant's total operating costs [7,8]. Fouling has been tackled with methods such as surface coatings (using antifouling materials) and surface modification (changing the surface chemistry of the membrane) so as to reduce the adhesion of foulants [5,6]. Finding a benign and selfcleaning material becomes imperative. Researchers have made several efforts in finding materials with such properties. For instance, polymers have been reported for developing antifouling coatings [9].Wastewater is full of contaminants, such as organic and inorganic compounds, bacteria and their toxins.

        <p>Removal of organic pollutants such as methylene blue [3,10,11] has been widely report in literature, using methods such as; sedimentation, chemical treatments, electrochemical methods, advanced oxidation processes, biological treatments, membrane filtration, adsorption and ion exchange [3,12]. Apart from the fact that some of the methods require the use of chemicals, two or more of them have to be combined for better removal results [3,12]. Meanwhile, in the past few decades, researchers have also been looking into the advantages of solar energy in water remediation technologies such as advanced oxidation processes (AOP) [13]. AOPs are based on the generation of oxidizing agents such as the hydroxyl radicals that can attack many pollutants present in waters [14]. The production of hydroxyl radicals could be initiated by an electric field, ultrasound or by light irradiation. Therefore, in the presence of a catalyst, the light energy coming from the sun could be used as an initiator in the production of the hydroxyl radical. This process is known as photocatalysis.Removal of organic pollutants such as methylene blue [3,10,11] has been widely report in literature, using methods such as; sedimentation, chemical treatments, electrochemical methods, advanced oxidation processes, biological treatments, membrane filtration, adsorption and ion exchange [3,12].

        <p>In literature, photocatalytic method has shown excellent antifouling results on bacteria [15][16][17] and degradation of methylene blue [10,11]. Amongst photocatalytic materials, stands out as the most widely used due to its chemical stability, ability to adsorb electrons, acceptable band gap, affordability and environmentally friendliness [12,13,18]. Many studies have used TiO 2 in waste water management and solar energy harvesting. TiO 2 is used in breaking down most organic pollutants such as dyes, pesticides and herbicides under light irradiation [12]. The challenge in most cases is recovering of the TiO 2 from the treated water. Therefore, researchers have made composites of TiO 2 and nanofibers for applications such as removal of heavy metals [19], for photocatalytic degradation [20,21] and as anti-fouling membranes [22,23]. Other photocatalytic materials that have been reported include C 3 N 4 , ZnO, ZnS, SrTiO 3 and CdS [15,24]. Generally, these nanocomposite materials absorb light during photocatalysis leading to promotion of electrons from their valence band to their conduction band, leaving a hole in their valence band resulting to photo-redox reaction. However, most of the materials experience recombination of generated photo electrons thereby reducing their photocatalytic ability [11,15]. To mitigate this effect, catalysts are modified using methods such as doping with metals/ nonmetals and coupling with carbon materials [24] to act as sinks for the generated photo electrons [25].In literature, photocatalytic method has shown excellent antifouling results on bacteria [15][16][17] and degradation of methylene blue [10,11].

        <p>Polymer nanofibers have been reported to serve as support for catalysts and other biological important compounds either by surface immobilization or as composites [26]. The electrospinning process has been the main nanotechnology method use in fabrication of polymer fibers with diameters in the nanometer range. At these diameters, nanofibers exhibit characteristics such as high surface area to volume rate. Electrospinning can produce polymer nanofibers in a continuous mode [27][28][29][30]. Other methods such as self-assembly, chemical vapor deposition, template-assisted synthesis and wet chemical synthesis have also been used to produce nanofiber materials, however, electrospinning possess advantages such as allowing easy doping, simplicity, low cost, and high reproducibility [31]. Polymers that have been successfully electrospun into nanofibers include; polyamide 6, polyacrylonitrile, polyethylene terephthalate, polystyrene etc. [32][33][34]. Among these polymers, polyacrylonitrile stands out due its excellent characteristics such as high carbon content, chemical resistance, good thermal stability and superior mechanical properties [27,35].Polymer nanofibers have been reported to serve as support for catalysts and other biological important compounds either by surface immobilization or as composites [26].

        <p>Electrospinning was conducted according to Bode-Aluko et al. [36]. 8 wt% of PAN was prepared in DMF and was electrospun by introducing the polymer solution into a 20 mL syringe with 0.2 mm inner diameter stainless steel needle. The syringe was fitted into a metering syringe pump. A stationary collector covered with A4 size aluminum foil was used. For the process parameters: the flow rate was set at 0.4 mL/h, and a voltage of 25 kV was applied across the collection distance of 15 cm at a room temperature of 28 • C. The resultant nanofibers were labelled as PAN-nfs (Polyacrylonitrile nanofibers). Similarly, 3 wt% of TiO 2 was mixed with 8 wt% PAN solution in DMF and stirred overnight to form a homogenous solution. The resultant solution was electrospun into nanofibers with the same electrospinning parameters as above to give PAN-TiO2. Further TiO 2 loading (wt%) concentrations were not studied as the homogenous solution could not be electrospun due to high viscosity and also to keep the reactive radical minimal to avoid degradation of the polymer nanofibers.Electrospinning was conducted according to Bode-Aluko et al.

Both strains were maintained at 37 • C for 24 h. The antimicrobial experiment was conducted according to Al-Fori et al. [37]. Briefly, cultures were centrifuged and re-suspended in fresh broth to obtain an absorbance of 0.1 (at 620 nm). Each well of a 24-well plate (Nunc) contained 2.5 mL of bacterial culture and pieces (1 cm 2 ) of PAN-nfs or PAN-TiO2. As the control, wells with 2.5 mL of bacterial culture were used. The experiment was conducted for 48 h at 37 • C under light (using the solar simulator) and dark (covered with aluminum foil) conditions.

        <p>In order to investigate the behavior of materials in terms of photocatalysis, their abilities to produce OH* radicals were studied. Chemical dosimetry based on terephthalic acid (TA) was used to measure the OH radicals produced during photocatalysis. TA is a well-known scavenger which does not react with other radicals except OH* radicals [38]. As shown in reaction scheme 1, the OH* radical can convert nonfluorescent TA to fluorescent 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (HTA). Therefore, during irradiation of a solution containing TA and HTA molecules, HTA molecules will emit light at λ = 425 nm, while TA molecules will not.In order to investigate the behavior of materials in terms of photocatalysis, their abilities to produce OH* radicals were studied.

Since the low quantity of Ti (~1.44%: estimated from the XPS survey spectrum) on the PAN nfs/TiO 2 surface, Ti 2p peak was not seen clearly in the original data.

        <p>The ATR-FTIR spectrum (Fig. 2a) of the PAN-nfs has the following characteristic peaks that are unique to PAN; the peak at 2924 cm -1 is assigned to C-H stretching vibration of CH2 and the peak at 2241 cm - corresponded to the C ---N stretching vibration. The strong bands at 1450 cm -1 , 1345 cm -1 and 1220 cm -1 can be assigned to the aliphatic CH group vibrations of CH2 groups. The appearance of a peak at cm -1 on PAN-nfs which corresponds to the C--O stretching vibration is assumed to have come from the C--O of methacrylate [41]. Similarly, the spectrum of PAN-TiO 2 shows the same peaks except the appearance of broad band at 850-550 cm -1 and the weakened bond strength of C--O suspected to be due to the metal coordination [42] which was further confirmed by XPS.

An indistinct phase was also detected at 27.2 • and could be assigned to (1 1 0) plane of rutile TiO [45].

        <p>In order to verify the elemental composition and surface chemistry of PAN-nfs and PAN-TiO2, XPS analysis was carried out (Fig. 3). Survey spectra shows three core level peaks of C 1 s, N 1 s and O 1 s obtained from PAN-nfs and PAN-TiO 2 [46][47][48]. A small extra peak was detected on PAN-TiO 2 sample at 457 eV and 463 eV which correspond to the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 with a spin orbit splitting of ~ 6 eV (Fig. 3a inset). Fig. 3b andc show high resolution XPS spectra of core-level C 1 s peaks for PAN-nfs and PAN-TiO2. C 1 s spectra for PAN-nfs can be deconvoluted into three components where C-C/C-H at 284.6 eV [48], C ---N at 286.1 eV and C--O at 288.4 eV respectively. From literature, the binding energies for C ---N was reported at 286.4, 285.9, 286.6 eV [49][50][51] and for C--O at 288.6, 288.5, 288.5 eV [52][53][54] where our results are in good agreement with those reported values. In the case of PAN-TiO 2 (Fig. 3c), the binding energies at 284.6 eV and 285.9 eV can be attributed to C-C/ C-H bonds and C ---N bonds (slight shifting of BE ~ 0.2 eV). A new feature appeared at 283.4 eV on PAN-TiO 2 sample, which could be ascribed to O-Ti-C bonds [48]. The amount of C-C/C-H was reduced substantially from 89.2% to 71.8% and a slight reduction of C ---N ca. 2% were due to the formation of O-Ti-C bonds while TiO 2 nanoparticles were incorporated in polyacrylonitrile matrix. Moreover, slightly lower binding shifting (ca. 0.2 eV) of N 1 s peak in PAN-TiO 2 sample compared with PAN-nfs suggested the interaction between nanofibers and TiO 2 nanoparticles. The C--O feature was completely diminished in PAN-TiO 2 sample which can also be observed in FTIR (Fig. 2a). O 1 s peak of PAN nfs comprises of two distinct peaks centred at 530.6 eV and 526.3 eV (Fig. 3d). Typically, BE value at 530.6 eV can be assigned to lattice oxygen related bonding where 526.3 eV probably can be assigned to some carbon containing doping [55].

        <p>The X-ray diffraction pattern of PAN-TiO 2 clearly indicates the formation of intense Ti diffraction peaks. However, in XPS spectra, Ti peaks both in wide survey and high resolution scans are very feeble and noisy due to low quantity of Ti (~1.44%: estimated from the XPS survey spectrum) on the PAN-TiO 2 nfs surface. In addition, XPS is a unique surface-sensitive technique that detected electrons originate only from the top few nanometer (~10 nm) while XRD technique can verify the crystalline materials within ~ 10 μm of the surface. Therefore, the noisy and very feeble XPS peak is due to the lack of exposure of Ti on the PAN-Nfs surface (some portions of TiO 2 nanoparticles are embedded in fiber c d matrix) that reduces the intensity of Ti2p peak.The X-ray diffraction pattern of PAN-TiO 2 clearly indicates the formation of intense Ti diffraction peaks.

Fig. 4e shows the transformation of superhydrophobic (WCA ~ 155 • ) to super hydrophilic (WCA ~ 8 • ) nature of PAN-TiO2 surface by constant exposure of visible light over 4 h. It is a well-known phenomenon that semiconductors such as TiO2 or ZnO can be transformed from being hydrophobic to hydrophilic by irradiation of ultra-violet light or visible light [56]. In our case, visible light (1000 W/m 2 ) was used and a longer exposure time was needed to render the surface superhydrophilic. This could be due to the low content of TiO2 in the fiber matrix which could turn the surface hydrophilic.The estimated atomic relative concentration of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and titanium on PAN-nfs and PAN-TiO2 samples surface. sustain their superhydrophobic nature thus the WCA dropped from 155 ± 1 • to 25 ± 3 • after 120 s (Fig. 4b).

        <p>The photo-degradation of MB was studied using PAN-nfs and PAN-TiO2 under visible light (Fig. 6). Both nanofibers can adsorb MB, but adsorption was not significant in the absence of light (Fig. 6a and6b). For light experiments, the lower absorbance is mainly due to degradation. Under visible light, PAN-TiO2 shows about 90% while PAN-nfs about 55% of dye degradation after about 3 h (Fig. 6c). After the first 30 min, degradation of MB on PAN-nfs is slightly higher than PAN-TiO2 due to the hydrophobic nature of PAN-TiO2 surface (WCA ~ 150 • which is not shown in Fig. 4d). However, after 60 min or more PAN-TiO2 surface turns hydrophilic (See Fig. 4e) which then results in faster degradation rate (See Fig. 6c). This turning point can be observed from the high production of OH* radical after 100 min of exposure time (See Fig. 5b). About 2% of MB degraded in the control as well. This is probably due to dye bleaching under the light [57,58].The photo-degradation of MB was studied using PAN-nfs and PAN-TiO2 under visible light (Fig. 6).

        <p>PAN-TiO2 was 2-fold more effective in MB dye degradation compared to PAN-nfs. The liberation of OH* radicals as a result of photoirradiation could have initiated reactions leading to MB degradation [59]. The results showing that the PAN-TiO2 has the highest degradation were probably due to higher production of OH* radicals by TiO2. Photocatalytic degradation of MB by TiO2 under visible light was reported earlier [60][61][62][63]. The result reveals that TiO2 containing PANbased fibers could be applied for environmental remediation with selfcleaning properties under visible light. PAN-nfs by themselves showed some photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. This is perhaps an emerging characteristic of polymers, as polymers such as polyethersulfone, have shown photocatalytic properties [59,63]. Dye removal could be ascribed to physical adsorption of the dye onto the PAN-nfs but the production of free radicals shown in Fig. 6 argues otherwise. TiO 2 nanoparticles mainly absorb UV light due to its wide band gap, however, their photocatalytic effect on MB and biofouling under visible light could be due to sensitization mechanism [64][65][66]. In case of dyes, instead of TiO 2 , the dye molecules absorbed visible light, got excited and transferred the electrons into the conduction band of TiO 2 leading to formation of radicals [64][65][66]. Moreover, the sensitization could have also come from PAN-nfs as polymer-sensitizer of TiO 2 has been previously reported [65], therefore, PAN-nfs may have served as the organic sensitizer that absorbed the visible light.PAN-TiO2 was 2-fold more effective in MB dye degradation compared to PAN-nfs.

        <p>At the same time, the antimicrobial properties of PAN-TiO2 have not been investigated so far. In this study, we studied the antimicrobial properties of PAN-nfs and PAN-TiO2 in the dark and light experiments. The experiments were conducted using a common human bacterial pathogen E. coli [69]. This is a Gram-negative bacterium associated with the lower intestine of humans. Some strains of this bacterium cause serious diarrhea and food poisoning in humans [70,71]. Our experiments showed that there was no significant difference between optical densities of E. coli cultures in the dark experiment with PAN-nfs and PAN-TiO2 (Fig. 7a). On the contrary, at the light conditions PAN-TiO2 inhibited 3-fold the growth of bacteria compare to PAN-nfs and the control (only bacteria) after 24 h. The number of viable bacteria expressed as colony forming units (CFU) was 10-fold lower in treatments with PAN-TiO2 (1.4 × 10 8 CFU/ml) compared to that with PAN-nfs (18.4 × 10 8 CFU/ml). However, after 48 h to exposure of visible light, the density of bacteria in the presence of PAN-TiO2 was similar to the control sample but 2-fold lower than in the presence of PAN-nfs (Fig. 7a). This could be explained by enhanced cell growth of E.coli on hydrophilic surface of PAN-nfs.At the same time, the antimicrobial properties of PAN-TiO2 have not been investigated so far.

        <p>Similarly, in the visible light experiment PAN-TiO2 inhibited the optical density of Gram-positive biofouling bacterium Bacillus sp. (Fig. 7b). Since PAN-TiO2 inhibited growth of E. coli as well, this suggests that PAN-TiO2 fibers have potent antimicrobial properties against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The reduction of the number of bacteria can be explained by two hypotheses. First, bacteria can be killed due to production of reactive oxygen species during photocatalysis. Second, bacteria can accumulate on the surface of the fibers. Our data suggested that most likely bacteria were eliminated due to photocatalysis as we would not observe a dramatic reduction of viability of bacteria in the case of adsorption of bacteria especially for Gram positive bacteria. Under the dark condition, PAN-TiO2 sample showed slight reduction of bacterial density compared with the control sample (bacteria only). This might be due to: (1) slight adsorption of bacteria on the PAN-TiO2 surface and (2) slow release of catalytic ions into the media, which inhibit the bacteria growth.Similarly, in the visible light experiment PAN-TiO2 inhibited the optical density of Gram-positive biofouling bacterium Bacillus sp.

        <p>The proposed mechanism of antifouling activity of PAN-TiO2 fibers against chemical and biological fouling is due to photocatalytic activity and production of reactive oxygen species under visible light.

        <p>This results in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), like hydroxyl radicals (OH*) and superoxide ions (O2 -). Radicals can further undergo cascaded reactions with H + and photogenerated electrons (e -) producing peroxides (H 2 O 2 ) and more OH* radicals [6]. These ROS species can oxidize organic molecules, like MB, and kill bacteria. ROS are known to cause cell wall damage and increase cell oxidative stress [74,75]. Additionally, once ROS are inside the cell, they can damage DNA of bacteria and interfere with microbial enzymes and lipids [76,77]. Therefore, PAN-TiO2 fibers can be used for different industrial applications, in which antifouling and self-regenerating activity is required, such as degradation of organic pollutants in industrial water, treatment of produced and wastewater, and disinfection of water. Additionally, PAN-TiO2 fibers can be used as a pre-treatment to reduce fouling of reverse osmosis membranes of desalination plants.This results in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), like hydroxyl radicals (OH*) and superoxide ions (O2 -).

        <p>In this study, PAN-TiO2 nanofibers were successfully made by a simple electrospinning and blending procedure. High hydrophobicity is imparted to PAN nanofibers by addition of TiO 2 , enhancing water repellent properties. In the presence of visible light, these nanofibers showed potent antifouling and photocatalytic activity as well as high hydrophobicity in comparison to unmodified PAN nanofibers. PAN-TiO2 nanofibers successfully removed a dye and killed bacteria within a laboratory experiment. Thus, the antifouling activity and high hydrophobicity of PAN-TiO2 nanofibers could be useful in many industrial applications.
