        <p>Ammonia is the essential chemical and the cornerstone of the large and ever-growing fertilizer industry. It is also a potential hydrogen carrier and can be cracked into H 2 and N 2 at the destination affording hydrogen on demand. Unlike liquid hydrogen that needs harsh condition to be stored, ammonia can be readily liquefied by increasing pressure to ~10 bar at room temperature, or by cooling to -33℃ at atmospheric pressure. [1] Indeed, ammonia is foreseen to gain momentum as a carbonfree fuel for ships, heavy transport vehicles once direct ammonia fuel cells reach a higher level of maturity. [2] Currently, the worldwide production of ammonia relies on the Haber-Bosch (HB) process, which consumes about 5.5 EJ of energy every year (∼38 GJ/t NH3 ) and emits over 450 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (∼2.9 t CO2 /t NH3 ). [3] With the growing interests of using ammonia in non-agriculture sectors (e.g. energy), the production scale of ammonia and ammonia-related emissions will be further expanded. Thus, to meet the COP21 two-degree scenario (2DS) target [3] for ammonia, there is a compelling need to replace the conventional HB process by alternative sustainable strategies compatible with renewables that could meet the increasing demand. Electrochemical nitrate reduction (NITRR) has the potential of decentralized production of "green" ammonia with an economically-competitive rate. [4] On the one hand, excessive use of fertilizer and other human activities have contributed a lot of nitrate in ground and surface water. Recycling redundant nitrates and converting them to ammonia could add direct economic value to the remediation process. [1,5] On the other hand, with the development of electrochemical conversion of nitrogen to nitrate via non-thermal plasma techniques and nitrogen oxidation, [6] ammonia production from nitrate is no longer a reversal of the Ostwald process and the production scale can be further extended. Therefore, the NITRR could provide a sustainable alternative to the HB process and simultaneously provide a solution for restoring the imbalance in the global nitrogen cycle. [7] In the early years, Cu-based catalysts have been reported for the NITRR. However, as the research foothold is only the remediation of nitrate in the environment, most catalysts are designed to produce nitrogen. [8] Although there were a few Cubased catalysts reported for ammonia synthesis, the in-depth mechanistic studies were lacked. Recently, Cu-based catalysts for NITRR has demonstrated an upsurge in research again, [9] displaying Faradaic efficiencies (FE) greater than 90% and partial current densities for ammonia production close to 100 mA cm -2 . However, they usually operated only at very negative applied potentials (around -0.4 ~ -0.7 V vs. RHE), which is energetically inefficient. It has been argued that the weak adsorption of H on Cu may be the main limiting factor for the NITRR, i.e., only at very negative applied potentials the *H coverage is high enough to maintain a significant surface hydrogenation rate. [10] Therefore, it is expected that by activating the hydrogenation ability of Cu-based catalyst at more positive applied potentials the overpotential for the NITRR could be drastically reduced. Rhodium (Rh) is known to exhibit excellent hydrogen adsorption-desorption features, [11] as demonstrated by its uppermost and centered position in the HER volcano plot. We therefore hypothesize that proper distribution of Rh over Cu sites could patch the poor hydrogenation capabilities of bare Cu and improve the NITRR performance.Ammonia is the essential chemical and the cornerstone of the large and ever-growing fertilizer industry.

        <p>Inspired by recent advances in cluster and single-atom catalysis, [12] here we constructed a series of electrodes based on Rh cluster and single-atom supported on Cu NWs (Rh@Cu, henceforth). The NITRR was explored as a function of the Rhcontent, revealing a record partial current density for NH 3 production of 162 mA cm -2 and a 93% FE at -0.2 V vs. RHE for very low Rh loading (Rh@Cu-0.6%). Importantly, 15 N labelling together with NMR experiments confirmed nitrate as the only Nsource of the produced ammonia. Mechanistic insights on the reaction gathered by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, in-situ infrared spectroscopy, in-situ Raman spectroscopy, on-line differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) and density functional theory (DFT) modeling provided compelling evidences of the synergistic catalytic cooperation between Cu and Rh. The Cu site preferentially stabilizes nitrogen intermediate species, whereas the vicinal Rh supplies the activated H species required for the surface hydrogenation to proceed. Ultimately, ammonia was released as the product.Inspired by recent advances in cluster and single-atom catalysis, [12] here we constructed a series of electrodes based on Rh cluster and single-atom supported on Cu NWs (Rh@Cu, henceforth).

        <p>Catalyst preparation and characterization. The electrodes made of Cu 2 O NWs were first fabricated as reported in previous work. [13] Then, the Cu 2 O NWs were reduced to Cu NWs by electrochemical reduction. Finally, Cu NWs coated with either homogeneously distributed Rh cluster and single-atom (Rh@Cu) or Rh nanoparticles (NP Rh@Cu) were synthesized by galvanic replacement reaction between Cu and Rh 3+ , as detailed in the Supporting Information. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images confirmed the micrometer-long Cu NWs, and the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern solely detected the characteristic reflections of Cu without oxide phases (Figure S1). Three different Rh@Cu catalysts in terms of different Rh loading were prepared, namely samples with 12.5% (NP Rh@Cu-12.5%), 0.6% (Rh@Cu-0.6%) and 0.3% (Rh@Cu-0.3%) of Rh, respectively. The SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Rh@Cu-0.6% (Figure 1a-b and S2-S3), NP Rh@Cu-12.5% (Figure S4, S6) and Rh@Cu-0.3% (Figure S7) samples recorded before and after the NITRR did not reveal major structural variations on the NWs. This can be attributed to the small feature size of the Rh deposited on the surface in all cases and the stability under cathodic operation of the Cu NWs. Indeed, XRD patterns for all samples did not reveal any change upon the NITRR tests, which confirmed the robustness of the Cu electrodes and the low Rh contents (Figure S8 and1i). In order to better assess the presence of Rh, elemental mapping was performed. Overall, the content of Rh estimated by energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and inductive coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) matched well, that is, 12.5% (Figure S4-6), 0.6% (Figure 1c-g) and 0.3% (Figure S7), respectively, and barely changed upon operation. In addition, the aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-HAADF-STEM) was employed to further detect Rh atoms based on contrast difference. As shown in Figure 1h, many bright dots and atomsized features attributed to individual Rh atoms as well as very small Rh clusters can be discerned on the surface of Cu (111) in Rh@Cu-0.6%. In contrast, the higher loading of Rh@Cu-12.5% leads to Rh nanoparticles with a characteristic lattice fringe of 0.220 nm corresponding to Rh (111), which can be well differentiated from the characteristic lattice spacing of 0.209 nm assigned to Cu (111) (Figure S4). Finally, for the Rh@Cu-0.3% sample, since the amount of Rh is even lower, we speculated that Rh in this sample is also in the form of single atoms and clusters.Catalyst preparation and characterization.

        <p>We also used X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), including X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) to analyze the chemical state and local structure of Rh in Rh@Cu-0.6%. The Rh K-edge XANES spectrum for Rh@Cu-0.6% lies in between those corresponding to Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 reference samples. Indeed, linear combination analysis of XANES spectra (see the inset of Figure 1j), where the spectrum for Rh@Cu-0.6% sample is fitted with a linear combination of spectra for Rh foil and Rh 2 O 3 , provides a good agreement with experimental Rh@Cu-0.6% sample spectrum, and suggests that ca. 63% of Rh is in reduced form and ca. 37% of Rh is oxidized. The presence of oxidized Rh species can be attributed to the sample being placed in air so that its surface is inevitably oxidized. During the subsequent NITRR test, the applied potentials is from 0 V to -0.5 V vs. RHE, which is much lower than the standard reduction potential of Rh 3+ /Rh (0.758 V vs. RHE), [14] thus we expect that the oxide cannot be retained and the main form of Rh in the working catalyst is Rh 0 during NITRR test. The frequency of Rh K-edge EXAFS spectra at large k-values matches well with that of EXAFS spectrum for Rh foil (Figure 1k). This suggests that the distances between Rh and neighboring metal atoms are very closed to these distances in Rh foil, and strongly supports the formation of Rh-rich phase. Note that in the case of homogeneous Rh alloying with Cu, we would expect a significant contraction of interatomic distances (and, hence, a decrease in EXAFS frequencies) due to a very large Cu to Rh ratio in our sample, and the significantly smaller lattice constant of metallic copper compare to metallic rhodium. Combined with AC-HAADF-STEM, these XAS results show that part of Rh exists in the form of small clusters in Rh@Cu-0.6%. Fouriertransformed (FT) EXAFS spectra (Figure 1l) confirm conclusions from the visual examination of XANES and EXAFS data. FT-EXAFS spectra are dominated by three peaks. The first one at ca. 1.7 Å (phase uncorrected) was assigned to Rh-O bond, and the peaks between ca. 2.1 Å and 2.5 Å were assigned to a superposition of Rh-Cu and Rh-Rh bond contributions. This provides compelling evidence of the existence of single atom Rh and Rh clusters.

        <p>EXAFS data fitting was next performed for quantitative analysis. The results of the fitting are summarized in Figure S9 and Table S1. Good agreement between experimental and modeled data (Figure S9), and the reasonable values of Rfactors (Table S1) support the validity of the fitting models. The obtained values for Rh-O and Rh-Rh bond lengths and disorder factors are in reasonable agreement with those in bulk reference materials. The Rh-Cu bond length obtained for Rh@Cu-0.6% is between the Rh-Rh bond length (2.64±0.04 Å) and the typical bond lengths in metallic Cu (ca. 2.56 Å), as expected for bimetallic systems. [15] Slightly lower Rh-Rh bond length observed for Rh@Cu-0.6% sample (2.64±0.04 Å) than that in Rh foil (2.68 Å) may, in turn, suggest that the size of Rh clusters is small, resulting in relatively large contribution of compressed Rh-Rh distances at the cluster surface [16] (although the contraction of distances due to partial alloying with Cu cannot be excluded).EXAFS data fitting was next performed for quantitative analysis.

        <p>We noted that the obtained coordination numbers for Rh@Cu-0.6% are lower than the corresponding values of bulk Activity and selectivity for NITRR to ammonia. To explore the NITRR performance of the Rh@Cu electrocatalysts, we first recorded linear sweep voltammograms using 0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 as supporting electrolytes (pH was adjusted to 11.5) both with and without 0.1 M KNO 3 as nitrogen source. As depicted in Figure 2a, the current density of Rh@Cu catalysts with various Rh content drastically increases in the presence of nitrate. The Rh@Cu-0.6% sample shows the maximum current density and a sharp onset at 0.2 V vs. RHE. As the potential becomes negative, HER and NITRR compete. However, the number of electrons transferred for HER is less than that required for NITRR, and the current appears flat. When the potential becomes more negative, HER competition dominates. At high (more negative) applied potentials, especially when looking at curves of Rh@Cu-0.6% and Rh@Cu-12.5%, the current decreases in a rather irregular fashion. This has been ascribed to the significant hydrogen production occurring at the electrodes' surface, where the generated hydrogen bubbles disturb the electrolyte near the electrode.We noted that the obtained coordination numbers for Rh@Cu-0.6% are lower than the corresponding values of bulk Activity and selectivity for NITRR to ammonia.

        <p>Furthermore, the product analysis by the colorimetric method (Figure S10-11) confirmed that the Rh@Cu-0.6% sample displayed the highest performance. Both lower (Rh@Cu-0.3%) and higher (NP Rh@Cu-12.5%) Rh loadings led to a lower performance (Figure 2b and Figure S12-13). The sample with too little Rh doping may not have obvious synergistic effect between Cu and Rh, while too much Rh loading will lead to the enhancement of competing HER. Therefore, Rh@Cu-0.6% was the focus of our investigation. Further characterization of the reaction products demonstrated a steady increase of ammonia production up to -0.4 V vs. RHE, reaching a record value of 21.61 mg h -1 cm -2 , or 1.27 mmol h -1 cm -2 (see Table S2 or FigureFurthermore, the product analysis by the colorimetric method (Figure S10-11) confirmed that the Rh@Cu-0.6% sample displayed the highest performance.

The slight deterioration of these values at more negative potentials could be ascribed to the competing HER.S14), whereas FE values hit a maximum of 93% at -0.2 V vs. RHE (Figure 2c).

        <p>The FE of Rh@Cu-0.6% is obviously improved compared with bare Cu foil, Cu NWs and Rh nanoparticles (NPs) (Figure 2d and S15-18). The partial current density for ammonia production of Rh@Cu-0.6% reached 162.0 mA cm -2 at -0.2 V vs. RHE (Figure 2e and Table S2), which was also much higher than Rh NPs and had a 24.6% increase compared to Cu NWs (130.0 mA cm -2 ). In addition, the potential at which the NH 3 production reaches peak FE for the Rh@Cu-0.6% sample is 200 mV more positive than that of pure Cu NWs (Figure 2d, S16). Overall, the above results provide compelling evidence of the synergy between Rh and Cu NWs when appropriately interfaced. Finally, the influence of the nitrate concentration on the performance was assessed and the optimized FE for ammonia production was achieved in electrolyte with 100 mM NO 3 -(Figure 2f). The FE for ammonia production was slightly reduced as the NO 3 concentration decreased, likely because of the increased contribution of the competing HER. Interestingly, the FE of ammonia production decreased with the increase of NO 3 concentration to 1 M. We hypothesize that the large concentration of produced ammonia in this case might not be removed rapidly from the catalyst surface in time, resulting in the deactivation of the active sites for NITRR. The maximum FE of Rh@Cu-0.6% for NITRR in 0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 with 0.1 M NO 3 -and 0.1 M PBS (pH 7) with 0.1 M NO 3 -is 96% and 80%, respectively.The FE of Rh@Cu-0.6% is obviously improved compared with bare Cu foil, Cu NWs and Rh nanoparticles (NPs) (Figure 2d and S15-18). The partial current density for ammonia production of Rh@Cu-0.6% reached 162.0 mA cm -2 at -0.2 V vs. RHE (Figure 2e and Table S2), which was also much higher than Rh NPs and had a 24.6% increase compared to Cu NWs (130.0 mA cm -2 ). In addition, the potential at which the NH 3 production reaches peak FE for the Rh@Cu-0.6% sample is 200 mV more positive than that of pure Cu NWs (Figure 2d, S16). Overall, the above results provide compelling evidence of the synergy between Rh and Cu NWs when appropriately interfaced. Finally, the influence of the nitrate concentration on the performance was assessed and the optimized FE for ammonia production was achieved in electrolyte with 100 mM NO 3 -(Figure 2f). The FE for ammonia production was slightly reduced as the NO 3 concentration decreased, likely because of the increased contribution of the competing HER.

        <p>Mechanism study and DFT calculation. We next sought to understand the origin of the remarkable performance of the Rh@Cu electrocatalyst for NITRR, especially at low overpotential. For instance, at -0.1 V vs. RHE, it was found that the production of ammonia for the optimized Rh@Cu-0.6% electrode was over 100 times higher than that of Rh NPs, and 2 times higher than that of Cu NWs (Figure S24). It is plausible to consider Cu as the main active site while the Rh site acts as a promoter. The experimental results of less activity of Rh@Cu-15% compared to Rh@Cu-0.6% confirm that the introduction of a small amount of Rh into Cu can promote ammonia production, but excess Rh will promote the HER due to the strong adsorption capacity of Rh to H (Figure S25). Therefore, we speculate that the introduction of Rh promotes the hydrogenation step of NITRR. The kinetic isotope experiments indicated that when H 2 O solvent is replaced by D 2 O to carry out the NITRR, the FEs of ammonia production on Cu NWs and Rh@Cu-0.6% do not change significantly, but both the current density and ammonia yield rate of Cu NWs are significantly lower. In comparison, the current density and ammonia yield rate of Rh@Cu-0.6% do not change significantly when H 2 O is replaced to D 2 O (Figure S26). This indicates that the hydrogenation step of Cu NWs for NITRR is the rate-limiting step. After introducing Rh, the hydrogenation step of Rh@Cu-0.6% is no longer rate-limiting. Therefore, this result suggests that the introduction of Rh promotes the hydrogenation step in NITRR. In-situ infrared spectroscopy (IR) results show that only a weak peak corresponding to -NH 2 can be detected from -0.1 V vs. RHE when pure Cu NWs catalyzes NITRR, while an obvious peak corresponding to -NH 2 is noticed from 0.2 V vs. RHE when Rh@Cu-0.6% catalyzes NITRR (Figure 4a). Since Rh displays a near-optimum H adsorption Gibbs free energy, we speculate that the incorporation of Rh drastically improves the surface adsorption of H in the electrode, which could promote the hydrogenation of the intermediate nitrogen species adsorbed on the nearby Cu sites by a hydrogen transfer mechanism at low applied potentials. [18] In order to test our hypothesis, we monitored the formation of H radical (H•) upon running HER by EPR using dimethyl-1pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as the radical trapping reagent. [19] The *H-adsorbed on the catalyst surface during HER has two destinies, which can be dimerized to H 2 , or desorb from the catalyst surface to the solution and form H• radical trapped by DMPO. [20] Under alkaline conditions, the overall HER performance is limited by the ability to adsorb hydrogen. In view of the trend in the HER performance, i.e, Rh NPs &gt; Rh@Cu-0.6% &gt; Cu NWs, we could anticipate the poor *H-adsorption characteristic of the Cu NWs (Figure S27), which is in good agreement with DFT results (Figure S28). In the absence of nitrate, EPR spectra revealed 9 signals with an intensity ratio of 1:1:2:1:2:1:2:1:1, which indicates the formation of H-DMPO in all cases (Figure 4b). It is worth noting that the intensity of the signals, which is proportional to the concentration of H-DMPO, follows the same trend observed in the HER performance, and further corroborates the low degree of H adsorption on Cu NWs. In comparison, the strong EPR signal obtained for the Rh@Cu-0.6% sample demonstrates an efficient adsorption-desorption of H. Based on the DFT calculation, the adsorption of H on Rh is easier than that of nitrate, and also easier than H on Cu site. Therefore, H preferentially adsorbs on Rh sites compared to Cu sites of Rh@Cu-0.6% (Figure S28-29).Mechanism study and DFT calculation.

        <p>We next investigated whether the *H-adsorbed on Rh site could participate in the hydrogenation of the NITRR intermediates by recording the EPR spectra of the electrolyte after NITRR at -0.1 V vs. RHE (Figure 4c). Interestingly, the H-DMPO signal did not change in the presence of nitrate for Rh NPs, while it became undetectable for Rh@Cu-0.6% and Cu NWs. This result suggests that the H• generated at the surface of Rh@Cu-0.6% and Cu NWs is rapidly consumed in the hydrogenation of adjacent surface-activated nitrogen-containing intermediates. However, the Rh NPs are barely active towards NITRR, which is likely because of its unfavorable adsorption of nitrate with respect to the competing HER reaction steps. These findings support the hypothesis that the NITRR mechanism involves hydrogen transfer steps. It is worth noting that a similar hydrogen transfer mechanism could also be detected on the preliminary studies carried out using a similar system, i.e., Ru@Cu-3.4% (Figure S30). This delivers the highest ammonia yield of 19.42 mg h -1 cm -2 (1.14 mmol h -1 cm -2 ) and FE of 93.4% at -0.2 V vs. RHE, which is also higher than those of bare Cu NWs. More generally, this supports the notion that the hydrogen transfer mechanism, evidenced in Rh@Cu systems, could be found in a wide variety of metal-supported on Cu electrocatalysts systems (Figure S30).We next investigated whether the *H-adsorbed on Rh site could participate in the hydrogenation of the NITRR intermediates by recording the EPR spectra of the electrolyte after NITRR at -0.1 V vs. RHE (Figure 4c).

        <p>In order to construct a comprehensive description of the reaction mechanism, on-line differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) was utilized to detect the intermediate species generated during the NITRR. Figure 4d and Figure S31 display the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) signals recorded as a function of time while performing 4 subsequent voltammetry scan cycles (each cycle involves a scan from 0.78 V to -1.42 V vs. RHE). Note that m/z signals at 46, 30, 33 and 17 were detected and tracked, corresponding to NO 2 , NO, NH 2 OH and NH 3 , respectively. The in-situ Raman spectroscopy was also conducted to characterize the valence states of Rh and Cu in Rh@Cu-0.6% during NITRR test (Figure S32). Raman spectroscopy of initial Rh@Cu-0.6% showed characteristic peak of Cu 2 O at 218 cm -1 , CuO at 298 cm -1 and 622 cm -1 , Rh 2 O 3 at 527 cm -1 without applying potential. These agree well with the XAS results which evidenced that Rh on the catalyst surface was partially oxidized in air. As the applied potential decreases (more negative), all peaks decreased gradually and disappeared from 0 V vs. RHE onwards. Therefore, the oxidation states of Rh clusters, single Rh atoms and Cu were mostly zero during NITRR. Based on the DEMS, in-situ Raman results and with the aid of DFT, we proposed a reaction pathway and calculated the corresponding Gibbs free energy of each intermediate over Cu and Rh@Cu-0.6% (Figure 4e and S33-34). The NITRR could be 4e). When this step is triggered by Rh single atoms, it also involved a low free energy increment (0.01 eV) (Figure S34). Therefore, Rh clusters in Rh@Cu play a more critical role in the in-situ hydrogen transfer during the NITRR catalysis. Overall, the decreased free energy of the subsequent steps accounts for the improved FE and current density when the Rh is supported on Cu NWs.

        <p>We have demonstrated that, by interfacing Rh cluster and single-atom Rh with Cu NWs, the hydrogenation steps of ammonia synthesis from NITRR at low applied potentials can be effectively controlled to optimize the catalytic selectivity. Partial current densities up to 162.0 mA cm -2 and FE of 93% at potentials as low as -0.2 V vs. RHE were achieved. The highest ammonia yield rate reached 1.27 mmol h -1 cm -2 , which exceeded that of the state-of-the-art NITRR catalysts. Mechanistic insights sought by utilizing a series of techniques suggested that the excellent activity and efficiency is attributed to the transfer of adsorbed *H from Rh sites to the *NOadsorbed intermediate species located on Cu sites, thus facilitating the hydrogenation step for ammonia synthesis. This study not only provides insights for designing NITRR catalysts with high activity and selectivity, but also promotes the further exploration of the NITRR mechanism.We have demonstrated that, by interfacing Rh cluster and single-atom Rh with Cu NWs, the hydrogenation steps of ammonia synthesis from NITRR at low applied potentials can be effectively controlled to optimize the catalytic selectivity.
