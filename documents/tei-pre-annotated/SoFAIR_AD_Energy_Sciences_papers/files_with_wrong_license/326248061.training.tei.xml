        <p>Herein, an experimental and Density Functional Theory (DFT) analysis of the composite g-C 3 N 4 /BiVO 4 microflower photocatalysts were comprehensively discussed. A remarkable photoelectrocatalytic solar hydrogen production has been observed for the as-developed photocatalysts, with different loading amounts of g-C 3 N 4 (0.1, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 wt.%), using lake water without the addition of sacrificial reagents. The 0.8 wt.% g-C 3 N 4 /BiVO 4 microflower photocatalyst evinced remarkable photoelectrocatalytic activity of 21.4 mmol/h of hydrogen generated in comparison to other samples with an AQE of 4.27% at 420 nm. In addition, the photocurrent density of 0.8 wt.% g-C 3 N 4 /BiVO 4 microflower was two-fold higher than that of pure BiVO 4 . This was attributed to its better crystallinity and optical properties; confirmed from XRD and DR-UV-Vis analysis. The DFT analysis further corroborated that the efficient photocharge carrier separation and limited photocharge carrier recombination corresponded to the synergistic effect of the band offset and built-in electric field.Herein, an experimental and Density Functional Theory (DFT) analysis of the composite g-C 3 N 4 /BiVO 4 microflower photocatalysts were comprehensively discussed.

        <p>Over the past few decades, photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar water splitting has gained significant interest in the scientific community, as an alternative to current fossil fuel technologies. [1][2][3] The PEC solar water splitting is highly dependent on the efficiency of photocatalyst materials. Nevertheless, the performances of conventional photocatalysts are greatly hampered due to several obstacles such as infinitesimal light conversion efficiency, photocorrosion, and recombination of the photocharge carriers. 4,5 Considerable efforts have been dedicated to find and develop highly efficient photocatalytic materials that can alleviate these issues, facing by conventional photocatalysts. Ideally, a practical photocatalyst material must fulfil the following requirements (i) visible-light-driven material, (ii) proper band edge location for water splitting reaction, (iii) do not undergo photocorrosion and (iv) smooth photocharge carrier separation and migration. [6][7][8] Up to date, photocatalysts which possess microstructure-dependent properties has gained much interest owing to the favourable structural properties that can significantly improve the photocatalytic performance. 9,10 Specifically, the transformation of one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures into three-dimensional (3D) microstructures has been a recent focus of interest due to unique morphology and surface structure properties. 11,12 Generally, the PEC reaction takes place at the surface of photocatalyst, where all the photocharge carriers reside and initiate the photocatalytic process. Thus, by tailoring the surface structure of the photocatalyst, it is anticipated that the overall PEC water splitting reaction could be significantly enhanced.Over the past few decades, photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar water splitting has gained significant interest in the scientific community, as an alternative to current fossil fuel technologies.

        <p>Bismuth vanadate (BiVO 4 ) is one of the many visible-light-driven photocatalysts which have been extensively explored for the PEC water splitting system. 13,14 This is attributed to its peculiar merits such as visible-light active material with a bandgap energy of ~ 2.4 eV, suitable band edge location for water splitting reaction, and highly stable against photocorrosion. 15 Nevertheless, the existing limitations of single photocatalyst such as the fast recombination rate of photocharge carriers, sluggish water oxidation kinetics, and short holes diffusion length has circumscribed the aptness of this material. 8,16 To address these issues, our group has performed various strategies including defect strategies, facet engineering, and formation of the heterostructure system. [17][18][19][20] Among them, the formation of the heterostructure system with other semiconductor materials shows a great promise in the enhancement of PEC performance. [21][22][23] This enhancement is owing to the heterostructure system that facilitates the separation and migration of the photocharge carrier to a better degree where more available electrons and holes can participate in the photocatalytic reaction. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) is an emerging semiconductor material with moderate bandgap energy possesses a fascinating property, particularly a wellmatched band structure that is suitable for the formation of a heterostructure system with BiVO 4 materials. 22,24 The compatibility between g-C 3 N 4 and BiVO 4 to form the heterostructure system is anticipated to demonstrate a smooth transfer of the generated photocharge carries at the heterostructure interface. A smooth photocharge carrier transfer within the heterostructure system is possible due to the minimum resistance at the heterostructure interface, which results in minimizing the photocharge carrier recombination and thus enhancing the overall photoelectrocatalytic performance.Bismuth vanadate (BiVO 4 ) is one of the many visible-light-driven photocatalysts which have been extensively explored for the PEC water splitting system. 13,14 This is attributed to its peculiar merits such as visible-light active material with a bandgap energy of ~ 2.4 eV, suitable band edge location for water splitting reaction, and highly stable against photocorrosion. 15 Nevertheless, the existing limitations of single photocatalyst such as the fast recombination rate of photocharge carriers, sluggish water oxidation kinetics, and short holes diffusion length has circumscribed the aptness of this material. 8,16 To address these issues, our group has performed various strategies including defect strategies, facet engineering, and formation of the heterostructure system.

        <p>Herein, a novel g-C 3 N 4 /BiVO 4 microflower photocatalyst was prepared and its photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance was evaluated. The effect of different amounts of g-C 3 N 4 loading integrated onto 3D BiVO 4 microflower photocatalyst was systematically studied. In addition, the reusability and stability analyses were performed to investigate the photocorrosion properties. Moreover, the study on the potential of hydrogen evolution from lake water is hardly been found. Most of the previous literature is focussed on the development of composite photocatalyst for PEC hydrogen production, using a chemical-based electrolyte. Thus, the mobilization of natural lake water as an alternative for the conventional chemical-based electrolyte solution will embark on a new paradigm in the photocatalytic field and thus facilitate the readiness of this technology for practical usage. Finally, we also performed periodic density functional theory (DFT) for g-C 3 N 4 /BiVO 4 heterostructure to determine their interaction and counter check our experimental data.Herein, a novel g-C 3 N 4 /BiVO 4 microflower photocatalyst was prepared and its photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance was evaluated.

        <p>A modified hydrothermal method and thermal polycondensation of urea methods have been employed in order to prepare the pure 3D BiVO 4 and g-C 3 N 4 samples, respectively. Details on the synthesis protocols have been comprehensively discussed in our previous reports. 13,25 Meanwhile, a wet-impregnation method was used to prepare a series of the composite g-C 3 N 4 /BiVO 4 microflower samples with particular amounts of g-C 3 N 4 loading. Generally, 0.1, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 wt.% of g-C 3 N 4 were separately added into a beaker, containing 1g of BiVO 4 microflower. Prior to the one hour stirring process, 40 mL of deionized water was added. Then, the suspension was heated until it becomes a thick orange-yellowish slurry. The collected slurry was then dried in an oven at 80 °C for 24 hours.A modified hydrothermal method and thermal polycondensation of urea methods have been employed in order to prepare the pure 3D BiVO 4 and g-C 3 N 4 samples, respectively.

        <p>Figure 3 delineates the XRD analysis of the g-C 3 N 4 /BiVO 4 microflower photocatalysts prepared at the various amount of g-C 3 N 4 loading. The peak splitting observed at 24.7 and 25.6° of 2θ corresponds to the tetragonal structure of BiVO 4 (JCPDS card no. 14 -0133). Meanwhile, the detection of peak splitting located at 30.6, 34.8, 39.5, and 48.5° of 2θ coincided well with the monoclinic scheelite structure of the BiVO 4 (JCPDS card no. 14 -0688). 29,30 All these observed peaks indicate that the as-prepared BiVO 4 was composed of two different types of structures; namely tetragonal and monoclinic scheelite-like structure. It is worthwhile to note that the intensity of the BiVO 4 (121) crystal planes was weakened while that of (040) crystal planes was enhanced with respect to the increased in the amounts of g-C 3 N 4 loadings.

        <p>Generally, the g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts are composed of (100) and (002) crystal planes which can be observed at 13.9 and 25.6° of the 2θ, respectively. 31,32 The strong peak intensity of (002) crystal planes indicates a graphite-like interlayer stacking microstructures with an interlayer distance of d = 0.326 nm. This graphite-like interlayer stacking is tighter than the stacking of the graphene units with an interlayer distance of d = 0.353 nm. 33 This observation indicates the wellassimilated of the layers of the aromatic systems with the heteroatom substitution. Thus it leads to the localization of the electrons and stronger binding between the layers. 24 Meanwhile, the detection of a weak (100) crystal planes based on the JCPDS card no. 01 -0646 in the composite g-C 3 N 4 /BiVO 4 microflower sample correspond to the tri-s-triazine unit in-planar ordering. 28 Page 10 of 40Generally, the g-C 3 N 4 photocatalysts are composed of (100) and (002) crystal planes which can be observed at 13.9 and 25.6° of the 2θ, respectively. 31,32 The strong peak intensity of (002) crystal planes indicates a graphite-like interlayer stacking microstructures with an interlayer distance of d = 0.326 nm.

        <p>Magnified XRD patterns at 25.6° of the 2θ which corresponds to (002) crystal plane of the g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, were shown in Figure 3 (b). It can be seen that the (002) crystal plane of all g-C 3 N 4 /BiVO 4 sample were less broad and slightly blue-shifted in comparison to 0.8 wt.% g-C 3 N 4 /BiVO 4 sample. This was presumably due to the internal stress left of the crystallization of BiVO 4 and g-C 3 N 4 in the form of the composite. 34 Meanwhile, the peak at 13.9° of 2θ which was attributed to the parental peak of the g-C 3 N 4 sample was hardly visible in the composite sample.Magnified XRD patterns at 25.6° of the 2θ which corresponds to (002) crystal plane of the g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, were shown in Figure 3 (b).

        <p>This might be due to the simultaneously decreased in the planar size and denser stacking of the g-C 3 N 4 layers. 22 On the other hand, the change in peak intensity and peak shifting position was observed in the as-developed g-C 3 N 4 /BiVO 4 microflower photocatalysts. This statement further confirmed the successful integration of the g-C 3 N 4 and BiVO 4 particles, to form a composite photocatalyst. 35 Furthermore, there were no impurity peaks were detected except for the footprint of the parental photocatalysts. photocatalysts which were examined using FESEM analysis. The panoramic view of all these samples shows a combination of 3D microflower shape-like structure and wrinkled layered structure which corresponds to the BiVO 4 and g-C 3 N 4 samples, respectively. The 3D BiVO 4 exhibits a typical blooming flower-like morphology with relatively sharp facets and edges. In addition, the microflower structure possesses a high symmetry as can be seen from the axial lines of the petals. Similarly, Ou et al. 36 reported that they successfully developed a superstructure BiVO 4 microflower via tailoring the pH of the solution. Meanwhile, the g-C 3 N 4 particles were made up of the irregular folding with large particle size. 37,38 The agglutinated g-C 3 N 4 particles were uniformly distributed onto the (010) crystal facet of the 3D BiVO 4 microflower, signifying the smooth photocharge carrier separation and migration. The reason behind this was the uniform and intimate contact between these two photocatalysts. The intimate contact between g-C 3 N 4 and BiVO 4 particles is important as it can inhibit the rate of recombination of photocharge carriers and thus more available electron-hole pairs can participate in the photoelectrocatalytic reaction. 30,39 Nevertheless, the overloading of the g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst in 1.2 wt.% g-C 3 N 4 /BiVO 4 results in the agglomeration of the particle. This further deteriorates the photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen performance due to the blockage of active site traits.

The 0.8 wt.% g-C 3 N 4 /BiVO 4 microflower photocatalyst has the highest BET surface area than the other samples which was consistent with the adsorption-desorption isotherm illustrated in Figure 6. Nevertheless, the overloading of the g-C 3 N 4 which was portrayed by the 1.2 wt.% g-C 3 N 4 /BiVO 4 sample had caused the surface area slightly decreased. This presumably due to the potential of the agglomeration of the particles which shielded the surface area as supported by the FESEM analysis as discussed previously (see Figure 4).

The pure 3D BiVO 4 sample possesses a limited hydrogen production performance (9.5 mmol/h), whose hydrogen performance was the lowest compared to the other as-developed samples. Similarly, the pure g-C 3 N 4 was only able to generate 11.9 mmol/h of hydrogen. The limited hydrogen performance monitored here was due to the natural limitation that exists within the individual pure samples such as short holes diffusion length and photocorrosion wherefore hampered the overall photoelectrocatalytic performance. On the other hand, the composite g-C 3 N 4 /BiVO 4 microflower photocatalysts show promising performance than the pure samples, signifying the smooth photocharge carrier transfer that occurred at the heterostructure interface between the couple photocatalyst due to minimum photocharge resistance. The photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen performance was gradually enhanced up to 0.8 wt.% amount of g-C 3 N 4 loading and then slightly decreased with further increase in the amount of g-C 3 N 4 loading. This limited photoelectrocatalytic performance observed was presumably originated from the overloading and agglomeration of g-C 3 N 4 particles which covered the BiVO 4 photoactive sites, evidently from the FESEM micrograph images as shown in Figure 4. As the light absorption capacity was shielded (see Figure 5), the availability of the photocharge carriers to initiate the photoelectrocatalytic reaction was limited and thus deteriorates the overall photocatalytic performance.Figure 7 delineated the FTIR spectra of the composite microflower samples.

        <p>On the contrary, the 0.8 wt.% g-C 3 N 4 /BiVO 4 sample yields the significant accumulated of hydrogen evolution with 21.4 mmol/h in comparison to the other samples. Therefore, it is safe to say that the optimum amount of g-C 3 N 4 loading needed to construct a highly efficient composite microflower photocatalyst was 0.8 wt.%. This is due to the highest BET surface area obtained by 0.8 wt.% g-C 3 N 4 /BiVO 4 sample as shown in Figure 6 which provides more active site traits in the composite sample and thus more available photocharge carriers can partake in the photocatalytic reaction. In addition, the 0.8 wt.% g-C 3 N 4 /BiVO 4 sample was further evaluated in photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen production using different sources of water, namely deionized water and a mixture of deionized water with 10 vol.% of Na 2 SO 3 as a sacrificial reagent. The 0.8 wt.% g-C 3 N 4 /BiVO 4 sample shows a slightly higher accumulated hydrogen evolution in deionized water aqueous media in comparison to the lake water. Moreover, Figure S6 illustrated that the presence of sacrificial reagent in deionized water significantly enhanced the hydrogen evolution.On the contrary, the 0.8 wt.% g-C 3 N 4 /BiVO 4 sample yields the significant accumulated of hydrogen evolution with 21.4 mmol/h in comparison to the other samples.

        <p>Although the difference in pH between both water sources was insignificant, the slight enhancement in hydrogen production using deionized water was presumably due to the difference in the miscibility of the as-developed photocatalyst in different water media. In addition, the presence of higher content of organic matter in the lake water can slightly affect the photoelectrocatalytic reaction. The higher content of organic matter in lake water, instead of act as a hole scavenger, organic matter can be deposited on the surface of photocatalyst as it is hard to mineralize, consequently limits the overall performance.Although the difference in pH between both water sources was insignificant, the slight enhancement in hydrogen production using deionized water was presumably due to the difference in the miscibility of the as-developed photocatalyst in different water media.

        <p>The photocharge carrier transfer behavior of the as-developed photocatalysts was explored using EIS analysis. It is generally known that the arc radii at the higher frequency indicate the higher electron transport resistance while the arc radii at the lower frequency indicate a smaller resistance for the electron transport. 51 Interestingly, the semicircle arc diameter of the 0.8 wt.% g-C 3 N 4 /BiVO 4 sample was the smallest than the other as-developed samples, indicating the smallest electron resistance possesses by this sample, results in the better photocharge carrier separation and migration (see Figure 9).

        <p>The best photocatalyst sample (0.8 wt.% g-C 3 N 4 /BiVO 4 sample) was further investigated relative to its reusability and recyclability features by repeating the reaction for three cyclic activities.

        <p>In order to countercheck the obtained experimental results, periodic DFT analysis was executed. As discussed elsewhere, [17][18][19] BiVO 4 along (001) direction was very stable and nonpolar. This is stemming from its well-defined surface formation energy (1.95 J/m 2 ). Figure S1 demonstrated that the lattice mismatch of the designed g-C 3 N 4 /BiVO 4 heterojunction was about 0.02%. Moreover, an adequate vacuum region was imposed in this heterostructure DFT analysis to attenuate the systems contagious interaction. There were three non-covalent type interactions were found within the composite systems which were stemming from the Bi-N, O-C, and O-N bonding. The total inter-bonding energy of this heterojunction was about -0.68 eV. This adsorption energy reveals a strong electrostatic interaction between coupled photocatalyst in the composite heterojunction.

The formations of these flat bands within the composite system are beneficial as they can act as hole trapping centres. Thus, this observation was well aligned with the experimental data in which an exceptional photoelectrocatalytic activity and high charge carrier mobilities were observed (refer Figure 8). Correspondingly, the C and N atoms of g-C 3 N 4 in C 3 N 4 /BiVO 4 heterojunction were responsible for these flat bands as can be seen from the DOS (see Figure S3).

        <p>However, when the composite heterostructure system was formed, the VBM and CBM of the composite were found to be in between the band edge location of the pure samples. The band edge position of the heterostructure system was shifted to an ideal position, results in a narrow bandgap as shown in Figure 13. This observation exemplifies the emerging of an internal electric field and band offset in the composite system which was responsible for enhancing the available photocharge carriers in the system. In addition, this effect will allow a smooth photocharge carrier transfer at the heterostructure interface and thus minimizing the recombination of the photocharge carrier. On the other hand, Figure 14 and Figure S5 epitomized the electron difference density of the photocatalysts based on the charge density difference (CDD) analysis.
