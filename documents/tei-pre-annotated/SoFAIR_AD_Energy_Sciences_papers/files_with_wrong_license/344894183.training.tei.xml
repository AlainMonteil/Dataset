        <p>The mitigation of CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere has promoted significantly the research interest in the field of electrocatalytic reduction of CO 2 towards chemicals with value added [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. Among these CO 2 electroreduction reaction products, the formation of formic acid (HCOOH) or formate (HCOO -) (depending on pH value) is considered one of the most attractive carbon-based products [10], due to its interesting potential uses and its high world demand [11,12]. In particular, HCOOH production is estimated to be up to 0.950 Mt per year [13]. Apart from the traditional uses in several industries, HCOOH and HCOO -are attracting attention as fuels in direct formic acid [14] or formate [15] fuel cells as well as one of the most promising materials for hydrogen storage [16].</p>
        <p>This interest is reflected in the large number of studies in the field of CO 2 electrochemical reduction towards HCOOH or HCOO -using different electrochemical configurations, operating conditions and catalyst material [17,18,[27][28][29][30][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26]. However, few studies have carried out the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 into HCOOH/HCOO -in a continuous mode [31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40], which must be desirable from an industrial point of view [41,42]. Moreover, other requirements have to be considered for a practical implementation: high current densities supplied to the electrochemical filter press reactor [43], low overpotential for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO 2 towards HCOO -to improve the energy efficiency [44,45] (electrochemical energy consumption less than 500 kWh per kmol of HCOO -), [42] high Faradaic Efficiency (FE) to obtain HCOO -with high product selectivity and to avoid separation costs (more than 50%) [46]; and the electrochemical reactor should be scaled up to match other industrial processes [11]. High HCOOH/HCOO -concentrations, as close as possible to 85% wt, the most common concentration in the market [47], are also necessary not just to assure economic viability of the process, but also because recent analyses of the environmental sustainability of HCOO -production by electroreduction of CO 2 alert that the energy requirements for conventional purification of diluted HCOO -products would cancel the expected benefits of the CO 2 electrovalorization in terms of global warming footprint [48]. In order to electrochemically reduce CO 2 to HCOO -at the industrial scale in a sustainable way, a simultaneous achievement of the previous requirements mentioned should be considered.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, obtaining noteworthy results simultaneously in terms of the product concentration, the FE for HCOO -and the consumption of energy should be considered mandatory for an implementation of the electrocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to HCOO -at the industrial scale.</p>
        <p>Different research groups [31][32][33][34][35]38,40] have made great efforts and advances for the electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction to HCOOH or HCOO -in a continuous mode. The experimental conditions and the results of these studies are summarized in Table S1 of the Supplementary Information. Some studies have recently been developed by Díaz-Sainz et al 2019 [38,40] employing carbon supported Bi nanoparticles in different working electrode configurations (Gas Diffusion Electrodes (GDEs) and Catalyst Coated Membrane Electrodes (CCMEs)). The best operating conditions were obtained using Bi carbon supported nanoparticles in the form of Catalyst Coated Membrane Electrode, in which the catalyst is deposited over the membrane Nafion 117. Hence, operating with a current density of 45 mA•cm -2 and a Bi catalyst loading of 1.5 mg•cm -2 , noteworthy results were obtained in terms of formate concentration ([HCOO -]) and FE for HCOO -: 34 g•L -1 and 72%, respectively [40]. Proietto et al 2018 [31] and Ramdin et al 2019 [32] described interesting studies of CO 2 electroreduction to HCOO -at high pressure, obtaining [HCOO -] of 17.2 and 20 g•L -1 , respectively. Nevertheless, FE for HCOO - obtained operating at these conditions were lower than 60 and 70%, with a pressure in the CO 2 input stream of 23 and 50 bar, respectively. Lee et al 2018 [33] studied the electroconversion of CO 2 to HCOO -,yielding [HCOO -] and FE of 116.2 g•L -1 and 77.7%, respectively, with low energy consumption per kmol of HCOO -(152 kWh•kmol -1 of HCOO -), but using a high temperature of the electrochemical cell of 323 K. Approaches using three compartment electrochemical reactors with a cation and anion exchange membrane for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to HCOOH have been studied [34,35]. Yang et al 2017 [35] implemented an efficient CO 2 electroreduction to HCOOH, obtaining formic acid concentration ([HCOOH]), FE for HCOOH and consumption of energy of 94 g•L -1 , 94% and 200 kWh•kmol -1 of HCOOH. Xia et al 2019 [34] achieved</p>
        <p>[HCOOH] of 309 and 556 g•L -1 , but at the expense of obtaining FE values of 30 and 40%, respectively, with important values of energy consumption (536 and 368 kWh•kmol -1 of HCOOH, respectively). The results of the studies mentioned above show an important progress in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to HCOOH or HCOO -. Other recent and relevant studies have also been published [49][50][51][52]. Nevertheless, the results reported do not involve a simultaneous combination of the mandatory requirements for an implementation of the process at the industrial scale. As depicted in Fig. 1, it is required to obtain significant concentrations of the target product, but simultaneously achieving remarkable values of the FE (Fig. 1a) and of the energy consumption per kmol of the target product (Fig. 1b). Therefore, there is the need of further research efforts to reach simultaneously desirable values of the different figures of merit involved in the assessment of these processes. Here we report a process for the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 to obtain HCOO -on a continuous mode, with only one pass of the input stream through the cell, employing Bi carbon supported nanoparticles (Bi/C NPs) in the form of a membrane electrode assembly (Bi-MEA). The input to the cathode is only CO 2 humidified and the process developed results in FE, concentration of product obtained, and energy consumption in a better trade-off than previous approaches reported in literature. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the FE for HCOO -and the consumption of energy per kmol of HCOO -obtained is close to the highest value reported in the literature, but simultaneously, the [HCOO -] obtained is three times higher than these studies. It is also particularly noteworthy that the values of energy per kmol of HCOO -required are lower than previous approaches, under current densities that allow yielding [HCOO -] higher than 300 g•L -1 . (31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 38 and 40). The data featured in this study are indicated in red (♦).</p>
        <p>Carbon-supported Bi nanoparticles (Bi/C NPs) were synthesized by chemical reduction of Bi 3+ , in N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) as solvent, by NaBH 4 in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as capping agent. This synthesis method was described in a recent contribution [53]. In more detail, 0.316 g of BiCl 3 (99.99%, Aldrich) was used as Bi precursor, 0.112 g of PVP (K30, Mw ~55.000, Aldrich) were added into 37.92 g of DMF (99.8%, Sigma Aldrich) and sonicated until complete solubilisation. Then, 0.116 g of NaBH 4 (99%, Aldrich) were added to the solution under continuous magnetic stirring at room temperature. After the addition of the reducing agent the solution becomes dark indicating the reduction of Bi 3+ to Bi 0 . The solution was stirred and alternatively sonicated for 45 min. Subsequently, 0.836 g of carbon Vulcan XC-72R were added to the mixture to obtain a Bi loading of ca. 20 wt.%. After 60 min of continuous magnetic stirring with alternative sonication, the Bi/C nanoparticles were precipitated using acetone and filtered and washed with acetone through a nylon membrane filter of 45 mm. Finally, the sample is dried overnight under vacuum conditions at 45 ºC.</p>
        <p>Bi-GDEs were used as cathode in the electrochemical filter press cell. The GDE is composed of three different layers: the carbonaceous support, the microporous layer and the catalytic layer, as depicted in Fig. S1. The preparation of the GDE is also described in the Supplementary Information.</p>
        <p>The Bi-MEA consists of a cationic exchange membrane in contact with the GDE (as illustrated in Fig. S2), which acts as a separator between anode and cathode compartment of the electrochemical reactor. Nafion 117 membrane was used as the cationic exchange membrane. Moreover, the current collector is located directly between the GDE and the cationic exchange membrane.</p>
        <p>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained with a JEOL JEM-1400 Plus working at 120 kV to evaluate the particle size and dispersion of the Bi nanoparticles.</p>
        <p>The experimental setup and the experiments conditions are described in detail in the Supplementary Information. The core of the experimental system is a filter-press reactor, whose configuration is illustrated in Fig. 2 The experimental system allowed continuous operation with a single pass of the reactants (which were a humidified CO 2 stream in the cathode side, and a 1 M KOH in the anode side). Both the liquid and gas output streams were analyzed. The performance of the electrochemical process is assessed by the FE, the [HCOO -], the HCOO -rate. the energy consumption per kmol of HCOO -and the energy efficiency The product analysis and the different equations used to calculate these figures of merit can be also found in the Supplementary Information.</p>
        <p>3.1 Characterization of the electrocatalyst (Bi/C NPs) Fig. 3 shows the main characteristics of the Bi/C NPs used in this work. Fig. 3a displays a representative TEM image of the sample. The image shows the presence of isolated, well-dispersed and quasi-spherical Bi nanoparticles with a particle size about 9.7 ± 2.3 nm (Fig. 3b). However, it is also worth noting the presence of some Bi clusters clearly formed by aggregated Bi nanoparticles. The dimension of these aggregates is about 200-300 nm. More representative TEM images of the samples are included in the supporting information (Fig. S6). The XPS spectrum of the Bi 4f region (Fig. 3d) shows the presence of two binding energy contributions at 164.8 (Bi 4f 5/2 ) and 159.5 eV (Bi 4f 7/2 ) [54] related to Bi 3+ . In addition, two clear shoulders are observed at 162.6 (Bi 4f 5/2 ) and 157.3 (Bi 4f 7/2 ) eV denoting the presence of Bi 0 . The Bi 3+ : Bi 0 ratio was found to be about 94:6, confirming that the Bi/C</p>
        <p>NPs present an oxidized character. To complete this characterization of the material, Fig. 3e displays the electrochemical response of a Bi/C NPs electrode in an Ar and CO 2 saturated 0.5 M KHCO 3 solution. In the Ar saturated solution, the voltammogram shows a reduction process due to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) which appears at about -1.4 V vs AgCl/Ag. For the CO 2 saturated solution, the results obtained clearly display the presence of a new and well-defined reduction process, starting at -1.3 V, and associated with the CO 2 reduction.</p>
        <p>The Bi/C GDEs were also characterized (surface and cross section) by SEM/EDX. Fig. 4 reports some representative SEM images obtained using backscattered electrons. As previously shown in the TEM images, the SEM images of the surface of the electrodes (Fig. 4a and4c) show both well-isolated and aggregated Bi nanoparticles. As expected, the surface of both electrodes is essentially similar independently of the metal loading (0.75 (a) and 1.5 (b) mg Bi/C NPs•cm -2 ). However, the cross section SEM images of the electrodes show that the thickness of the catalytic layer (CL) increases for increasing metal loading (Fig. 4b and4d). Thus, for 0.75 mg Bi/C NPs•cm -2 , the thickness of the CL is about 80 μm, while, for 1.5 mg Bi/C NPs•, the thickness of the CL is about 150 μm.</p>
        <p>This different thickness may play an important role during the gas-phase CO 2 electroreduction experiments. In this context, this thickness directly affects the ohmic resistance of the electrochemical reactor, increasing the cathode potential achieved operating with a Bi catalyst loading of 1.5 mg•cm -2 with respect to the employ of Bibased electrodes with a loading of 0.75 mg•cm -2 .</p>
        <p>Various experiments were carried out at room temperature (20 ºC) to analyze the performance of the process operating at different current densities and water flows in the input stream to the electrochemical filter press cell. All the tests were done working in a continuous mode with only one pass of the inputs through the filter press cell. Moreover, similar experiments were conducted at different Bi catalyst load: 0.75 mg•cm -2 and 1.5 mg•cm -2 . The detailed results of this section, as well as the potentials measured at the different tests are reported in Tables S2,S3, S4 and S5 of the Supplementary Information.</p>
        <p>Different current densities and water flows in the CO 2 input stream with an amount of Bi catalyst of 0.75 mg•cm -2 were tested. The results of these experiments are graphically summarized and compared in Fig. 5 and6 (values are reported in Table S2). On the one hand, as shown in Fig. 5, operating with the same value of the water flow (0.5 g•h -1 ), a rise of the current density from 45 to 100 mA•cm -2 results in a significant increment of [HCOO -] from 201 to 256 g•L -1 , approximately 27 per cent. Notwithstanding, as expected, the FE for HCOO -declined by roughly half, from 71 to 41%. In contrast, although supplying the filter press reactor with a current density of 200 mA•cm -2 results in one of the highest values of [HCOO -] reported in literature (312 g•L -1 ), the FE for HCOO -is still far from a desirable value for an implementation of the process at the industrial scale (25%). This decrease in the FE for HCOO -can be explained by the increment of the hydrogen (H 2 ) production by the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).</p>
        <p>Thus, the FE for H 2 raised from 22 to 69% when the current density was increased from 45 to 200 mA•cm -2 (FE for H 2 values are reported in the Table S3). Performance of the electrocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to HCOO -employing a Bi catalyst loading of 0.75 mg•cm -2 in terms of HCOO -concentration (g•L -1 ) and Faradaic efficiency for HCOO -(%) as a function of the current density (mA•cm -2 ) and the water flow in the CO 2 input stream (g•h -1 ).</p>
        <p>Additional tests were done at the same current densities (45 and 100 mA•cm -2 ), but at different water flows in the CO 2 stream (1 and 2 g•h -1 ). In both cases, the same phenomena were observed when the water flow was increased from 0.5 to 2 g•h -1 . The [HCOO -] sharply decreased to 118 and 135 g•L -1 and simultaneously, FE for HCOO -also decreased to 62.5 and 32.2%, working at a current density of 45 and 100 mA•cm -2 , respectively, as can be seen in Fig. 5. We hypothesized that this simultaneous decrease in the [HCOO -] and the FE for HCOO -is because increasing the amount of water vapor supplied to the electrochemical reactor results in a significant dilution of the HCOO -obtained by electroreduction of CO 2 , and simultaneously the excess of water vapor supplied favors the HER., decreasing the FE for HCOO -.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the energy consumption per kmol of HCOO -was only 207.7 kWh•kmol -1 of HCOO -, which corresponds to an absolute cell potential of 2.75 V, operating with a current density and a water flow of 45 mA•cm -2 and 0.5 g•h -1 , respectively. As displayed in Fig. 6, increasing the current density and the water flow in the CO 2 stream, the performance of the electrochemical filter press in terms of energy consumption per kmol of HCOO -got worse. Such results are found to be caused by higher ohmic and mass transfer losses imposed by the higher current density and water flow in the CO 2 stream.</p>
        <p>However, the increase of the current density supplied to the electrochemical reactor, when the water flow remained constant, favored the production of HCOO -.</p>
        <p>Additional experiments were performed with a Bi catalyst loading of 1.5 mg•cm -2 in the working electrode of the electrochemical filter press. The current densities supplied to the electrochemical cell were the same as those employing 0.75 mg•cm -2 , with the exception of operating at 200 mA•cm -2 due to the low FE for HCOO -value obtained in the previous experiments. The results obtained are graphically summarized and compared in Fig. 7 and 8 (values are provided in Table S4).</p>
        <p>As shown in Fig. 7, the performance of the process under 100 mA•cm -2 follows the same trends observed in the previous experiments (Fig. 5): an increase of the input water flow results in a decrease in [HCOO -] and in FE for HCOO -. This can also be attributed to a dilution effect, as well as to a promotion of HER revealed by the increase of the FE for H 2 with water flow at 100 mA•cm -2 reported in Table S5. A high concentration (approx. 340 g•L -1 ) can be obtained at 100 mA•cm -2 with a water flow of 0.5 g•h -1 , but achieving a FE for HCOO -of only 41%.</p>
        <p>The performance of the process is clearly improved operating at 45 mA•cm -2 . It is noteworthy that, working at this current density, an optimum input water flow is found at 2 g•h -1 (Fig. 7), which allowed yielding a [HCOO -] of 337 g•L -1 with an excellent FE for HCOO -of 89%. To the best of our knowledge, under these operating conditions resulted in the best trade-off between [HCOO -] and FE for HCOO -reported in the literature. In terms of energy consumption, as depicted in Fig. 8, supplying a current density of 45 mA•cm -2 and a water flow of 2 g•h -1 , the energy consumption per kmol of HCOO -was only of 180 kWh•kmol -1 , which corresponds to an energy efficiency and an absolute cell potential of 56.1% and 3 V, respectively. Moreover, increasing the current density results in a higher energy consumption per kmol of HCOO -, similarly as reported employing 0.75 mg•cm -2 , operating with the same water flow in the CO 2 stream. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, this remarkable consumption of energy (180 kWh•kmol -1 )</p>
        <p>represents an important progress in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to HCOO -due to the trade-off between the [HCOO -] (337 g•L -1 ), the FE for HCOO -(89%) and the energy consumption per kmol of HCOO -, important requirements for a future implementation of the process at the industrial scale.</p>
        <p>In this study, an important progress for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to HCOO - has been obtained. A process for the continuous electroreduction of CO 2 to HCOO -in a continuous mode with a single pass of the inputs through the electrochemical filter press cell has been developed. The working electrodes were prepared by depositing the Bi carbon supported nanoparticles in the form of Gas Diffusion Electrodes. However, the mass transfer between the working electrode and the Nafion 117 membrane was improved due to the direct contact between these elements of the filter press cell.</p>
        <p>The improvement of the mass transfer of the electrochemical filter press results in remarkable results in terms of [HCOO -], FE for HCOO -and the consumption of energy per kmol of HCOO -of 337 g•L -1 , 89% and 180 kWh•kmol -1 , respectively. These results represent the best trade-off in these figures of merit reported in the literature. Moreover, these results were obtained operating in a continuous mode and at a current density, a water flow in the CO 2 stream and a Bi catalyst loading of 45 mA•cm -2 , 2 g•h -1 and 1.5 mg•cm -2 , respectively, at ambient conditions of temperature and pressure.</p>
        <p>Hence, this configuration of the electrochemical filter press reactor has improved the performance of the electrocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to HCOO -and it makes the electrochemical process closer to the future implementation at the industrial scale.</p>
