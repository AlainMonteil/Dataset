        <p>This paper employs a new framework, the high-dimensional conditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) connectedness based on the LASSO-VAR model, to explore the conditional financial contagion among a specific system conditional on extreme events occurring outside the specific system and its extreme risk spillovers to the system from the systemic perspective. Then, this paper employs the delta CoVaR and CoVaR networks to analyse the risk spillovers from oil markets to the G20 stock system from both the pairwise and systemic perspectives. From the pairwise perspective, the delta CoVaR (ΔCoVaR) results show that when separating every G20 stock market from the whole market system, there are significant risk spillovers from oil to G20 stocks only during the crisis period. Further, the CoVaR connectedness results show that the G20 stock contagion presents regional characteristics and oil-related characteristics conditional on oil in extreme risk, and also verify the significant risk spillovers from the oil market to the global stock system from the systemic perspective. North American oil-related countries, including the United States of America, Canada and Mexico, are the most affected, and Asian countries have few shocks when the oil market shifts to extreme risk from a normal state. Last, this paper proposes two main policy implications after considering the empirical results.</p>
        <p>With the development of financial integration, the relationships between financial markets become increasingly closer, and the stability of a financial system decreases dramatically. Modern communication technologies also create favourable conditions for financial risk contagion. The extreme risks of one financial market or institution can spread to other markets or institutions via the open financial market system, causing risk spillovers and even financial contagion. The 2008 global financial crisis and the 2010 European debt crisis both support this phenomenon. The crucial commodity of crude oil especially plays a pivotal role in economic activities and has great relationships with stock markets (Jones and Kaul, 1996;Kilian and Park, 2009;Mensi et al., 2017;Dai et al., 2021;Ma et al., 2021). Thus, this paper models the financial contagion and explores the risk spillovers from the oil market to the stock market system, which can offer some theoretical and practical insights for investors and financial regulators to handle oil shocks, monitor oil risk spillovers, and even prevent systemic risks caused by extreme oil risks.</p>
        <p>Regarding the relationships between oil and stocks, previous representative literatures mainly focused on three aspects, i.e., the impacts of oil shocks on stock markets, the co-movement between oil and stock markets, and oil and stock market forecasting. Regarding the impacts of oil shocks on stock markets, the main research methodologies are the vector autoregression (VAR) and the structural vector autoregression (SVAR), and the main conclusions are summarized as follows. First, there are significant negative impacts of oil shocks on the U.S. and most European countries (Sadorsky, 1999;Papapetrou, 2001;Cunado and Perez de Gracia, 2014), mainly because oil is an important productive factor that then affects economic activities. Second, the reactions of the U.S.'s and oil trading countries' stock returns to oil shocks depend on which of supply and demand shocks drive the oil prices (Kilian and Park, 2009;Wang et al., 2013), as well as the corresponding country category, i.e., an oil importer or oil exporter (Wang et al., 2013). As a supplement, Apergis and Miller (2009) point out that stock returns respond little to oil shocks.</p>
        <p>Regarding the co-movement between oil and stock markets, the main research methodologies include multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity, Copula and extreme value theory, and the main conclusions include the following. First, the correlation or dependence between oil and the stock market for most countries is positive (Aloui et al., 2013;Sukcharoen et al., 2014;Zhu et al., 2014) and around zero in calm periods (Martín-Barragán et al., 2015). Moreover, Conrad et al. (2014) point out that the long-term oil and USA stock correlation is counter cyclical with the sign changes before and during recessions and remains positive throughout the economic recovery. In addition, Zhu et al. (2014) and Sukcharoen et al. (2014) point out that the dependence between oil and stock markets is relatively weak for most cases, but it is relatively strong for large oil consuming and producing countries, e.g., the U.S. and Canada. Second, there are positive extreme dependencies between oil and stock markets for some countries (Aloui et al., 2013;Chen and Lv, 2015;Shahzad et al., 2018). Regarding oil and stock market forecasting, Driesprong et al. (2008) find that a rise in oil prices drastically lowers future stock returns, and Wang et al. (2018) show that oil volatility can predict stock volatility in the shortterm.</p>
        <p>Over the past decade, the conditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) (Girardi and Ergün, 2013;Adrian and Brunnermeier, 2016), systemic expected shortfall (SES) (Acharya et al., 2016), and SRISK (Brownlees and Engle, 2017), as well as financial networks including the Granger causality network (Billio et al., 2012;Basu et al., 2017), the systemic risk beta network (Hautsch et al., 2015), and the variance decompositions network (Diebold and Yılmaz, 2014;Demirer et al., 2018), were proposed for systemic risk analysis, gradually becoming a hot point in the empirical finance area (Castro and Ferrari, 2014;Borri, 2019).</p>
        <p>With respect to the concrete topics of oil risk spillovers in energy finance area, the CoVaR and ΔCoVaR empirical results show there are significant asymmetric risk spillovers from oil risks to stock risks for most cases (Mensi et al., 2017;Ji et al., 2020;Li and Wei, 2018;Shahzad et al., 2018). Relative to the CoVaR application in risk spillover or contagion (Mensi et al., 2017;Ji et al., 2020;Wen et al., 2020), the system-wide financial network can describe the interactions of the risks for every financial institution or market, and thus be appropriate to explore the complex systemic characteristics exhibited during a period of extreme market risk (Diebold and Yılmaz, 2014;Hautsch et al., 2015;Zhang, 2017;Demirer et al., 2018;Geng et al., 2021). As far as we know, there are three representative literatures that analyse the interactions among crude oil and a few stocks markets, including Maghyereh et al. (2016), Zhang (2017) and Ma et al. (2019). Maghyereh et al. (2016) construct 12-node network connectedness for oil and stock implied volatility indexes at the country level, finding that the risk transfer between oil and equity markets is asymmetric and dominated by the transmissions from the oil market. Meanwhile, Zhang (2017) constructs 7-node network connectedness for oil and stock returns at the country level, finding that the contribution of oil shocks to the world financial system is limited. Ma et al. (2019) focus on the common and idiosyncratic components of the oil and US energy sector stocks' returns and find that the risk spillovers from oil to US energy sector stocks are mainly driven by common information. Other related papers about oil and stock network connectedness include Antonakakis et al. (2017), Ferrer et al. (2018) and Husain et al. (2019). Antonakakis et al.'s (2017) network connectedness has only one stock, which can hardly describe the interactions among various stock markets; and Ferrer et al. (2018) and Husain et al. (2019) include other financial assets except for oil and stocks.</p>
        <p>Particularly, the systemic risk or financial contagion often occurs under extreme market conditions, in which a tail risk can well capture these changes. As far as we know, there are only a few papers that construct tail risk networks to explore financial contagion or extreme risk spillovers (Hautsch et al., 2015;Betz et al., 2016;Härdle et al., 2016;Wang et al., 2017;Corsi et al., 2018). Meanwhile, the contagion triggers always come outside the concerned financial system, and regulators and policymakers often focus on the systemic risks for this system when some extreme event outside the system occurs. For example, oil market is different from global stock markets since oil is a commodity largely affected by geopolitics, indicating the necessity of distinguishing oil and stock markets. In this case, a conditional tail risk network and its changes may be appropriate to explore this conditional financial contagion or risk spillovers inside a financial system conditional on some extreme risks. It is greatly helpful for investors and policy makers to understand the financial contagion laws and then regulate the financial markets to prevent financial systemic risks when extreme events occur outside the specific financial system.</p>
        <p>Further, with respect to the variance decomposition network, the number of global main stock markets is more than 20, and the general VAR model cannot meet the requirements due to the curse of dimensionality and estimation error in optimization when there are too many parameters to estimate. Demirer et al. (2018) propose employing the LASSO-VAR model to construct the variance decomposition network to overcome the curse of dimensionality to some degree. Last, the financial contagion characteristics between oil and stocks vary over time, and the financial contagion from oil to stock markets becomes stronger during financial crisis periods, e.g., strong evidence in China and the United States (Wen et al., 2012) and Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States (Martín-Barragán et al., 2015).</p>
        <p>Thus, this paper contributes to the current literature in both methodology and empirical analysis as follows. First, this paper proposes an employing CoVaR network, a conditional tail risk network, to capture the risk spillovers from oil to the global stock system, and then analyses the conditional interactions among all markets of the whole system, i.e., the systemic financial contagion conditional on some specific external situation. Second, this paper introduces the high-dimensional network connectedness based on the LASSO-VAR variance decomposition method, which was proposed by Demirer et al. (2018); and combines it with the Copula-CoVaR method to construct a high-dimensional CoVaR network, which will largely advance the application scope of conditional tail risk networks.</p>
        <p>Last, using the G20 stock markets, including G7 developed countries, BRICS developing countries and other important economies, as representative of the global stock market system, this paper divides the time period into three representative macroeconomic periods, i.e., the precrisis period, the crisis period and the post-crisis period, for empirical analysis. Particularly, it explores the risk spillovers from the oil market to the global stock system from two perspectives, i.e., the pairwise CoVaR perspective and the system-wide CoVaR network perspective. Both of them conduct the empirical analysis via setting the oil market as conditional variable. It is reasonable and valuable to use the oil market as conditional variable for the two following reasons: (1) The oil market does not belong to the stock system, and its attributes are different from the various stock markets; (2) In our framework, we employ CoVaR to measure the risk spillover from oil to G20 stock market and compare the similarities and differences between G20 VaR network and CoVaR network. By this way, the impact of oil as exogenous shock can be well identified.</p>
        <p>This paper has contributed to the existing literature from both methodology and empirical analysis. For the methodology, Demirer et al. (2018) construct the network for stock volatility, which can reflect the risk spillover in some degree. Meanwhile, White et al. (2015) propose VAR for VaR model to measure the tail risk VaR via considering two financial series, and it can also measure the risk spillover for two financial markets. However, combined with stock volatility, VaR contains conditional volatility, conditional mean and tail quantile of standardized distribution for stock series. Thus, VaR connectedness can well measure the tail risk spillovers which considers the extreme market conditions. Meanwhile, CoVaR contains conditional volatility, conditional mean, tail quantile of standardized distribution for stock series, and also contains the joint distribution for stocks and oil. Thus, compared with Demirer et al. (2018)'s volatility connectedness, this paper constructs CoVaR connectedness to reflect the conditional tail risk contagion for stock markets. Particularly, the high-dimensional CoVaR network can also measure the conditional financial contagion and risk spillover among a larger number of financial markets, extending pairwise analysis to a multivariable network framework.</p>
        <p>For the empirical analysis, Ji et al. (2020) mainly employed CoVaR based on oil price decomposition to explore the risk spillovers from different types of oil shocks to BRICS stocks. Li and Wei (2018) employed time-varying copula-CoVaR model via combining the variational mode decomposition method to explore the risk spillovers from crude oil to China's stock market, and Wen et al. (2012) similarly employed time-varying copula model to measure the financial contagion between oil and China and United State stock markets. Above literature focused on the pairwise empirical analysis which cannot provide clear evidence for a worldwide market. Zhang (2017) employed network connectedness to explore the risk spillovers among crude oil and six stock markets, while it focused on returns rather than tail risk. Therefore, this paper constructs the high-dimensional VaR network and CoVaR network to analyse the tail risk spillover among the selected G20 stock markets, including G7, BRICS and other important economies.</p>
        <p>The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the methodology. In Section 3, we conduct the empirical analysis. Finally, we conclude in Section 4.</p>
        <p>This paper mainly uses a high-dimensional CoVaR network to explore the conditional financial contagion characteristics of the global G20 stock system when the oil market is in extreme risk, and it also explores the risk spillovers from the oil market to the G20 stock system via the CoVaR delta connectedness and a simple comparison between the VaR connectedness and the CoVaR connectedness. Meanwhile, ΔCoVaR is employed to explore the risk spillovers from the oil market to every separate G20 stock market while considering the macroeconomic and financial background, i.e., the pre-crisis period, the crisis period and the post-crisis period.</p>
        <p>In this paper, the tail risk network is the VaR connectedness constructed via generalized variance decomposition based on LASSO-VAR modelling with G20 stocks' VaRs, the conditional tail risk network is the CoVaR connectedness constructed via generalized variance decomposition based on LASSO-VAR modelling with G20 stocks' CoVaRs conditional on oil in extreme risk, and the CoVaR delta connectedness is the difference between the network connectedness of the G20 CoVaRs conditional on oil in extreme risk and that conditional on oil in a normal state.</p>
        <p>Based on the above thoughts, this section is divided into three parts, i.e., VaR and CoVaR definitions, measuring VaR and CoVaR, and VaR connectedness and CoVaR connectedness, as follows.</p>
        <p>VaR is the extreme lower tail quantile of the asset return distribution and is widely applied in measuring financial market risks. For G20 stock returns r 1, t , given a small tail probability α, the VaR can be defined as follows.</p>
        <p>CoVaR is proposed in Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016), and widely applied in measuring financial systemic risks and risk spillovers. According to Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016), the CoVaR for an asset returns pair (r 1, t , r 2, t ) is defined as</p>
        <p>where F 2, t -1 (•) is the conditional quantile function of r 2, t . In this paper, r 2, t denotes the oil market, and r 1, t denotes some G20 stock market. Thus, we can measure the conditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) for every G20 stock market conditional on oil returns being in an extreme risk state (β = 0.05) and a normal state (β = 0.5), respectively, and then we can define ΔCoVaR to measure the risk spillovers from oil risks to every stock market's risk as follows.</p>
        <p>(3)</p>
        <p>From Eqs. ( 1) and (2), we can construct the marginal distribution to measure the VaR and the conditional distribution conditional on oil returns to measure the CoVaR and ΔCoVaR for every G20 stock market. Since financial asset returns may have volatility clustering and heavy tail characteristics, and the joint distribution for multi-assets is always non-normal, this paper employs the Copula-GARCH model to construct the marginal distribution and joint distribution for oil and stock returns, and then derive the conditional distribution conditional on oil returns for G20 stock returns.</p>
        <p>Since Copulas have great advantages when modelling a multivariate non-normal distribution, they are widely applied in financial risk management. For the G20 stock returns r 1, t and oil returns r 2, t pair r t = (r 1, t , r 2, t ), given the historical information set F t-1 = {r 1 , ⋯, r t-1 }, the dynamic joint distribution of r t can be expressed via conditional Copula and conditional marginal distributions (Patton, 2009(Patton, , 2012)):</p>
        <p>where</p>
        <p>) is the conditional Copula dependence structure, and F 1,t ( • |F t-1 ) and F 2,t ( • |F t-1 ) are the conditional CDFs of the marginal distributions.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, the joint density can be given as</p>
        <p>where u i = F i,t (x i |F t-1 ; θ i ), and i = 1, 2. In Eq. ( 4), the conditional Copula can be further expressed as follows:</p>
        <p>Then, we can obtain static Copula and dynamic Copula models as follows.</p>
        <p>(1) Static Copula model For the static Copula model, given the historical information set F t-1 , the Copula dependence parameter is constant, that is, θ c = κ t = ρ for a Normal Copula, θ c = κ t = (ρ, n) ′ for a t Copula, and θ c = κ t = δ for a Clayton, Rotated Clayton, Gumbel and Rotated Gumbel.</p>
        <p>(2) Dynamic Copula model For a dynamic Copula model, given the historical information set F t-1 , the Copula dependence parameter follows the following process (Patton, 2006).</p>
        <p>For a time-varying Normal Copula, κ t = ρ t , and ρ t follows the subsequent process:</p>
        <p>For a time-varying t Copula, κ t = (ρ t , n) ′ , and ρ t follows the subsequent process:</p>
        <p>In Eqs. ( 7) and ( 8), the transformation</p>
        <p>holds the dependence parameter ρ t in (-1, 1), ϕ(•) is a univariate standardized normal distribution, and t n (•) is a univariate t distribution.</p>
        <p>For the time-varying Clayton, Rotated Clayton, Gumbel and Rotated Gumbel, κ t = δ t , and δ t follows the subsequent process:</p>
        <p>where</p>
        <p>x 2 holds the dependence parameter δ t in (0, ∞) for a Clayton and Rotated Clayton, and Λ(x) = 1 + x 2 holds the dependence parameter δ t in (1, ∞) for a Gumbel and Rotated Gumbel.</p>
        <p>Since oil and stock returns always have autocorrelation, volatility clustering, and heavy tail characteristics, this paper employs the autoregressive moving average-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity-distribution with zero mean and unit variance model (ARMA-GARCH-d) to construct the conditional marginal distribution for oil and stock returns as follows.</p>
        <p>where</p>
        <p>, and the distribution d i is selected from six standardized distributions with zero mean and unit variance, i.e., normal, skewed normal, t, skewed t, generalized error distribution, and skewed generalized error distribution.</p>
        <p>For the function g(•) in Eq. ( 12), we select three forms that correspond to three GARCH models as follows.</p>
        <p>(1) sGARCH(q, p) model</p>
        <p>(2) gjrGARCH(q, p) model (Glosten et al., 1993)</p>
        <p>where I t-j = 1 if ε i, t-j &lt; 0, and I t-j = 0 otherwise.</p>
        <p>(3) apARCH(q, p) model (Ding et al., 1993)</p>
        <p>Compared with the standard GARCH (sGARCH) model, the gjrGARCH model can handle the leverage effects, and the apARCH model can allow for both leverage and Taylor effects (Taylor, 1986). Through the distribution of standardized innovations d i , we can obtain the conditional distribution for stock or oil returns as follows.</p>
        <p>This paper employs the inference for margins (IFM) method proposed by Joe and Xu (1996) to estimate the joint distribution parameters θ for G20 stock and oil returns as follows.</p>
        <p>Step 1: Estimate the conditional marginal distribution parameters θ i (ARMA-GARCH-d model parameters) for G20 stock and oil returns as</p>
        <p>Step 2: Estimate the conditional Copula parameters θ c for G20 stock and oil returns as</p>
        <p>Joe (1997) proves that under some regular conditions, the IFM</p>
        <p>where G(θ) is the Godambe information matrix and θ is the true value for the parameters.</p>
        <p>The VaR and CoVaR should be measured for every G20 stock market before constructing the VaR and CoVaR network connectedness, and this paper measures the VaR and CoVaR using the marginal distribution and conditional distribution, respectively.</p>
        <p>From Eq. ( 16), the VaR of G20 stock returns can be obtained as follows.</p>
        <p>1,t = -</p>
        <p>Since the joint distribution of financial assets are always non-normal, the CoVaR is defined from the conditional distribution perspective, and the Copula has great advantages when constructing a multivariate nonnormal distribution; therefore, it is very appropriate to employ a Copula model to measure the CoVaR for financial assets. Further, compared with the quantile regression in Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016), the Copula-CoVaR method does not need to measure the VaR of the conditional variable, and it is only necessary to set the value for β, e.g., 0.05 or 0.5, as described in Eq. ( 2).</p>
        <p>We construct the dynamic joint distribution for every G20 country's stock and oil returns (the joint distribution is also dynamic when the marginal distribution is dynamic and the Copula dependence structure is static) as described above. Then, we further derive the conditional distribution given the oil variable for the G20 stock returns, and then measure the CoVaR for the G20 stock returns conditional on oil in extreme risk (β = 0.05) and a normal state (β = 0.5), respectively. For stock returns r 1, t and oil returns r 2, t with a dynamic joint distribution F t (x 1 , x 2 |F t-1 ; θ) and a marginal distribution F i,t ( • |F t-1 ; θ i ), where i = 1, 2, given the variable r 2, t , the conditional distribution for r 1, t can be derived as</p>
        <p>where</p>
        <p>From Eq. ( 21), the conditional Value-at-Risk of the G20 stock markets conditional on the oil market being in an extreme risk state (β = 0.05) and a normal state (β = 0.5) can be obtained by solving the following equation:</p>
        <p>Since the VaR and CoVaR are widely applied to measure the financial market tail risks or extreme risks, VaR and CoVaR connectedness model the financial market risk contagion. For a clear description of VaR and CoVaR connectedness, we first define the notation VaR stock 0.05 , obtained by setting α = 0.05 in Eq. ( 20) as the G20 stock Value-at-Risk, the</p>
        <p>, obtained by setting α = 0.05 and β = 0.05 in Eq. ( 22) as the G20 stock market Value-at-Risk conditional on the oil market being in extreme risk, and the CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.5 obtained by setting α = 0.05 and β = 0.5 in Eq. ( 22) as the G20 stock market Value-at-Risk conditional on the oil market being in a normal state. Then, we can simply compare G20's VaR stock 0.05 and CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.05 or employ</p>
        <p>, which subtracts CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.5 from CoVa-R stock|oil 0.05|0.05 , to analyse the risk spillovers from oil to every separate stock market in a pairwise manner. Further, we can construct some different financial networks based on different risk measures, i.e. VaRstock 0.05 connectedness, CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.05 connectedness, CoVa-R stock|oil 0.05|0.5 connectedness, and CoVaR delta connectedness, respectively. Thereinto, the VaR stock 0.05 connectedness is the DY network for G20 VaR stock 0.05 series, and it is the tail risk network which can be employed to analyse the financial contagion characteristics; CoVa-R stock|oil 0.05|0.05 connectedness is the DY network for G20 CoVa-R stock|oil 0.05|0.05 series, and it is the conditional tail risk network which can be employed to analyse the conditional financial contagion characteristics from the whole G20 stock market system perspective; CoVaR delta connectedness is the difference between CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.05 network matrix and CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.5 network matrix (or easier, the difference between CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.05 network matrix and VaR stock 0.05 network matrix), which can be employed to explore whether the oil market, outside the stock system, affects the risk spillover magnitudes among G20 stock markets and even causes the systemic risks. Conclusions regarding these methods cannot be obtained from previous literatures. However, either the G20 VaR network connectedness or CoVaR network connectedness has 20 nodes which will have 420 parameters to estimate even if the lag of the VAR model is specified as one. The general VAR method, as employed in Diebold and Yılmaz (2014), may not be able to model so many endogenous variables because of the curse of dimensionality and estimation error in the optimization when there are too many parameters to estimate. To solve these problems, the variance decomposition network based on the LASSO-VAR model, as proposed by Demirer et al. (2018), is introduced to construct the high-dimensional VaR or CoVaR network connectedness, which may largely advance the application scope of tail risk networks and conditional tail risk networks as follows.</p>
        <p>With respect to the G20 CoVaR network connectedness conditional on oil in extreme risk, we first put G20 stocks' CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.05 at time t together to constitute the 20-dimensional vector y t (similarly for the VaR stock 0.05 network and CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.5 network), and then construct the vector autoregression model for y t as follows.</p>
        <p>We can rewrite Eq. ( 23) as 20 regression equations. Similar to Demirer et al. (2018), we add the elastic-net penalty (Zou and Hastie, 2005) into each regression equation of the high-dimensional VAR model, and then estimate the coefficients equation by equation.</p>
        <p>In each equation obtained from Eq. ( 23), we denote z t as its dependent variable and x jt as its independent variables. Then, the elastic-net penalty regression solves the following optimization problem:</p>
        <p>where the elastic-net penalty</p>
        <p>Clearly, the elastic-net penalty is a compromise between the ridge regression penalty, α = 0, and the lasso penalty, α = 1. In this paper, we set α = 0.5, and then select λ via 10-fold cross-validation.</p>
        <p>After estimating the 20 regression equations, we rearrange the estimated coefficients into VAR form, and then construct the network connectedness of the G20 stocks' CoVaRs conditional on oil in tail risks as follows.</p>
        <p>where B j = ∑ p k=1 A k B j-k , j = 1, 2, ⋯, with B 0 = I and B j = 0 for j &lt; 0. According to the generalized variance decomposition introduced in Pesaran and Shin (1998), we can obtain the variance decomposition matrix with element d i, j gH as</p>
        <p>Then, we construct connectedness matrix shown in the Table 1.</p>
        <p>Based on the CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.05 connectedness matrix in the Table 1, we can define some measures by referring to Diebold and Yılmaz (2014) and Demirer et al. (2018) as follows:</p>
        <p>Table 1 The connectedness matrix based on generalized variance decomposition.</p>
        <p>1 20</p>
        <p>where</p>
        <p>(1) the pairwise directional connectedness from country j to country i as</p>
        <p>(2) the total directional connectedness from others to country i (from degree) as</p>
        <p>(3) the total directional connectedness to others from country j (to degree) as</p>
        <p>(4) the net total directional connectedness for country i as.</p>
        <p>(5) the total connectedness for the G20 stock system (total degree) as</p>
        <p>In the above CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.05 network connectedness measures, the pairwise directional connectedness C i←j corresponds to the risk spillovers from country j to country i conditional on oil in extreme risk.</p>
        <p>The from-degree C i←• corresponds to the exposure of country i to systemic shocks from the network, the to-degree C •←j corresponds to the contributions of country j to the systemic network, and the total degree provides a natural measure of the total system-wide systemic risk by averaging all G20 countries conditional on oil in extreme risk. Accordingly, the from-degree, to-degree and total degree of the CoVa-R stock|oil 0.05|0.5 network indicate the corresponding financial meanings when the oil market is in a normal state while those of the VaR stock 0.05 connectedness have the same financial meanings without considering the oil market. Particularly, the CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.5 or VaR stock 0.05 connectedness matrix is also constructed via generalized variance decomposition based on the LASSO-VAR model, the same as the CoVa-R stock|oil 0.05|0.05 connectedness matrix.</p>
        <p>In sum, the G20 CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.05 network, CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.5 network and VaR stock 0.05 network have the same construction method, i.</p>
        <p>e., generalized variance decomposition based on the LASSO-VAR model and the same number of nodes (20 nodes), but different financial meanings.</p>
        <p>This paper divides the sample period into three periods, i.e., the precrisis period, the crisis period, and the post-crisis period. This classification is inspired by the findings that the co-movements among stocks, exchange rates and commodities are weak before the crisis, significantly increase during the crisis, and gradually fade after the crisis (Liu et al., 2017). Then, we model the VaR stock 0.05 , and ΔCoVaR stock|oil 0.05 in above three periods, and further model the CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.05 connectedness and CoVaR stock|oil 0.05 delta connectedness during the crisis period. We use 10-step generalized variance decomposition (H = 10) for network connectedness and use a rolling estimation with a 150-day window with repeated cross-validation of the penalty parameter λ in each window, which is the same as Demirer et al. (2018). Meanwhile, we focus on the VAR(3) approximating model (p = 3) following Diebold and Yılmaz (2014). The empirical results may be helpful for financial regulators to understand the oil market and stock markets, monitor oil's extreme risks, and even prevent financial systemic risks.</p>
        <p>As we know, G20 contains the world's leading stock markets and this group's GDP accounts for 90% of the global economy and its trade volume accounts for 80% of the global economy. In the meantime, G20 includes G7 developed countries, BRICS developing countries and other important economies. Thus, we select the MERVAL, ASX200, BOVESPA, TSX, SHANGHAI A SHARE, DAX 30, STOXX EUROPE 600, CAC40, FTSE100, IDX, NIFTY500, MIB, TOPIX, KOSPI, BOLSA, RTS, TADAWUL ALL SHARE, BIST NATIONAL 100, S&amp;P500 and JSE ALL SHARE daily stock indices to represent G20 countries' stock markets, including Argentina (ARG), Australia (AUS), Brazil (BRA), Canada (CAN), China (CHN), Germany (DEU), the European Union (EU), France (FRA), Britain (GBR), Indonesia (IDN), India (IND), Italy (ITA), Japan (JPN), Korea (KOR), Mexico (MEX), Russia (RUS), Saudi Arabia (SAU), Turkey (TUR), the United States (USA), and South Africa (ZAF) stock markets, respectively, and select the WTI daily prices to represent the crude oil market. All above data are collected from DataStream.</p>
        <p>All series are from January 3, 2000 to July 24, 2018. The three extreme crises, i.e., the 2007 U.S. subprime crisis, the 2008 global financial crisis, and the European debt crisis, broke out in August 2007, September 2008, and March 2010, respectively, are the focus period in our sample. Because these three extreme crises are close, we put them together to constitute the crisis period beginning from August 1, 2007, which is the start time of U.S. subprime crisis; and going to July 31, 2012, which is the end time of European debt crisis. Then, the period before August 1, 2007, i.e., from January 3, 2000 to July 31, 2007, is treated as the pre-crisis period, and the period after July 31, 2012, i.e., from August 1, 2012 to July 24, 2018, is treated as the post-crisis period. Based on the above information, our sample period is long enough to contain the extreme crises, and our partition is reasonable from the macroeconomic perspective.</p>
        <p>The descriptive statistics of G20 stock and oil returns over the whole sample period are shown in Table 2. Only two countries' means are negative with FRA at -0.002 and ITA at -0.013, and ARG's mean of 0.081 is the highest. RUS's returns have the largest range with a maximum return of 20.204 and minimum return of -21.199. AUS's standard deviation is the smallest with a value of 0.967 while OIL's standard deviation is the biggest with a value of 2.389. With respect to the skewness, the distributions of most countries' returns are leftskewed, and only MEX exhibits a right-skewed distribution. Meanwhile, the kurtosis of all countries' returns are bigger than 3 and all Jarque-Bera statistics are significant at the 1% level, showing that all returns present non-normal and leptokurtic features. The above descriptive statistics and tests preliminarily indicate that it may be reasonable to employ a GARCH-class model to construct the marginal distribution for oil and G20 stock returns.</p>
        <p>This section will mainly employ two ways to explore the oil extreme risk spillovers to every separate G20 stock market in the three representative macroeconomic periods. The one way is the simple comparison between each stock's VaR stock 0.05 and the corresponding CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.05 conditional on oil in extreme risk while the other way is measuring ΔCoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.05 , which is the difference between the corresponding stock's CoVaR conditional on oil in extreme risk and that conditional on oil in a normal state, in all periods.</p>
        <p>The marginal distribution models for all returns in three periods are shown in the Table 3, and their corresponding diagnostic tests are shown in the Tables A.1-1 through A.1-3. In all periods, the Ljung-Box Q statistics for the residuals of the conditional mean equation show that they have no significant autocorrelation. The Ljung-Box Q statistics for the squared residual series and LM statistics show that they have significant B.-Y. Liu et al. conditional heteroscedasticity characteristics, but they are not significant for the standardized residuals. In addition, all standardized residual series have no autocorrelation characteristics at the 1% level. The above tests further indicate that it is reasonable to employ a GARCH-class model to construct the conditional marginal distribution for the G20 stock and oil returns.</p>
        <p>The estimations of marginal distributions for the three periods are shown in Tables A.2-1 through A.2-3, respectively. In the Tables A.2-1 through A.2-3, we can find that most parameters are significant at the 1% level. According to the ARMA-GARCH-d model shown in Table 3 and Eq. ( 20), we can measure the dynamic VaR stock 0.05 for the G20 stock markets in the three representative periods.</p>
        <p>The dynamic VaR stock 0.05 measures are illustrated with dark blue lines in Fig. 1. On the whole, the stocks markets' tail risks during the crisis are significantly larger than those in both the pre-crisis and postcrisis periods for most G20 stock markets. In the pre-crisis period, the dynamic changes of various G20 stock markets present some</p>

        <p>The marginal distribution for G20 stock and oil returns in three periods. Note: a In the GARCH(q, p), q is the order of ARCH term and p is the order of GARCH term. representative characteristics. The stock tail risks clearly increase during the period from 2002 to 2003 for some European countries including DEU, EU, FRA, GBR and ITA, as well as the US and during the period from 2006 to 2007 for some developing countries, e.g., CHN, IND, RUS, SAU, TUR and ZAF; however, the risks of AUS, BRA and JPN have no large changes over the whole pre-crisis period. In the crisis period, the G20 stock tail risks have similar tendencies, where most stock tail risks clearly increase in the second half of 2008, the year of 2010, and the second half of 2011. However, the CHN stock dynamic tail risks have smaller changes over the whole crisis period. In the post-crisis period, the dynamic changes of most G20 stock risks are relatively small, and there are some increases for ARG, CHN, ITA, JPN and SAU during the period from 2015 to 2016.</p>
        <p>To explore the oil extreme risk spillovers to every separate G20 stock market, we employ 12 Copulas to construct the dynamic joint distribution for every G20 stock and oil returns, and further measure the G20 stocks' CoVaR conditional on oil in different states. Then, we simply compare the dynamic G20 VaR with the corresponding CoVaR conditional on oil in extreme risk, and mainly focus on the dynamic G20 ΔCoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.05 , i.e., subtracting the G20 CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.5 conditional on oil in a normal state from that conditional on oil in extreme risk, to analyse the extreme risk spillovers from oil to the G20 stock markets from the pairwise perspective. The 12 Copula models include 6 static Copula models, i.e., Normal (N), t, Clayton (C), Rotated Clayton (RC), Gumbel (G) and Rotated Gumbel (RG); and 6 dynamic Copula models, i.e., time-varying Normal (TVN), time-varying t (TVt), timevarying Clayton (TVC), time-varying Rotated Clayton (TVRC), timevarying Gumbel (TVG) and time-varying Rotated Gumbel (TVRG).</p>
        <p>Table 4 shows the Kendall coefficients and best-fitting Copulas for the G20 stock and oil returns in three periods. In addition, the detailed AIC values for the 12 Copula models are shown in Tables A.3-1 through A.3-3, and the estimations and standard errors of besting fitting Copulas are shown in Tables A.4-1 through A.4-3. We can find that all Kendall coefficients in the crisis period are significantly larger than those in the other two periods, indicating that the co-movements between G20 stock and oil markets clearly increase and the information transmissions between stock and oil markets accelerate during the crisis period.</p>
        <p>Concretely, the dependence between only 7 stock markets, i.e., ARG, AUS, CAN, IDN, KOR, MEX and RUS, and oil returns are significantly positive, and the remaining 13 stocks and oil returns are not significant before the crisis. Similarly, Martín-Barragán et al. (2015) find that the correlation between oil and stock markets is stable and around zero for DEU, GBR, JPN and the USA in calm periods. After the crisis, the dependence between most stock returns and oil returns are significantly positive, and only 3 stock returns, AUS, IDN, and JPN, have no significant dependence with oil returns. However, the dependence between all stock returns and oil returns are significantly positive and largest during the crisis. Wen et al. (2012), Li and Wei (2018) and Shahzad et al. (2018) also find that the co-movement between oil and stock increases for CHN and the USA during the crisis period. Contrary to the partial results shown above, Asteriou and Bashmakova (2013) and Cunado and Perez de Gracia (2014) find negative impacts of the oil market on European stocks markets, and Diaz et al. (2016) find that G7 stock returns decrease as oil price volatility increases. Meanwhile, among the best-fitting Copulas, the number of Normal-class Copulas, i.e., the Normal and time-varying Normal Copulas, significantly decreases, indicating that most G20 stock returns and oil returns tend to present positive extreme co-movements during the crisis period.</p>
        <p>Based on the best-fitting Copulas, Eq. ( 16) and ( 22), we can measure the CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.05 and CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.5 for the G20 stock markets, respectively, and then we can obtain the dynamic ΔCoVaR stock|oil 0.05 via CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.05 minus CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.5 .</p>
        <p>Fig. 1 also shows the dynamic CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.05 with dark green lines and ΔCoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.05 with dark red lines for the G20 stocks during the three periods. We can find that the CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.05 line (dark green) coincides with the VaR stock 0.05 line for most countries in both precrisis and post-crisis periods, but it is above the VaR stock 0.05 line for most countries in the crisis period. More clearly, the ΔCoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.05 line (dark red) coincides with the zero line for most countries in the precrisis period, indicating that the risk spillovers from oil to G20 stock markets are weak with magnitudes close to zero before the crisis, and this outcome further supplements the results of the oil market having no effects on the USA's and Europe's stocks in the pre-crisis period (Reboredo and Rivera-Castro, 2014). After the crisis, only ARG's and RUS's ΔCoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.05 lines are above the zero line over the whole post-crisis period, indicating that the significant oil risk spillovers only exist for ARG and RUS. Meanwhile, the oil risk spillovers may weakly exist during the period from 2015 to 2016 and are not obvious for most of the time for some European countries and SAU during the post-crisis period. Relative to the pre-crisis and post-crisis periods, almost all countries' ΔCoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.05 lines are clearly above the zero line over the whole crisis period, which fully proves that the large extreme risk spillovers from oil to all G20 stock markets exist over the whole crisis period, and this outcome further verifies the financial contagion across oil and stocks markets (Wen et al., 2012;Chen and Lv, 2015).</p>
        <p>Since the large oil risk spillovers only exist in the crisis period for all G20 stocks, this section will mainly employ the LASSO-VAR model to construct the conditional tail risk CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.05 connectedness to analyse the conditional financial contagion conditional on oil in extreme risk. Meanwhile, it will further combine the CoVaR delta connectedness, which is the difference between the CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.05 connectedness and CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.5 connectedness, and compare the CoVa-R stock|oil 0.05|0.05 connectedness and VaR stock 0.05 to analyse the impacts of oil's extreme risk on the G20 stock market system during the crisis period.</p>
        <p>Table 5 shows the CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.05 connectedness for G20 stocks during the crisis period. We can find that the notable regional risk contagion features and oil-related risk spillover characteristics exist in</p>
        <p>The Kendall dependence and best-fitting Copula for G20 stock and oil returns in three periods. the total directional connectedness and pairwise directional connectedness conditional on oil being in extreme risk. The total from-degree reflects the total share of extreme risk changes coming from other G20 countries for some G20 stock market, and the total to-degree reflects the sum of the shares of all other G20 stock risk changes caused by the extreme risk shocks of this stock risk when the oil market suffers extreme distress.</p>
        <p>The total to-degree in Table 5 shows that the largest risk transmitters are BRA, CAN, MEX and RUS when the oil market is in extreme risk with C •←BRA = 188.8, C •←CAN = 129.3, C •←MEX = 112.4 and C •←RUS = 131.6, respectively, indicating that BRA, CAN, MEX and RUS are susceptible to transmitting risk shocks to other G20 countries when oil markets are in distress. Among the above four countries, CAN, MEX and RUS are large oil exporters; BRA, CAN and MEX are American countries; and the synergies of regional and oil-related characteristics facilitate these phenomena. Meanwhile, the total from-degree in table 5 shows that the largest risk receivers are DEU, EU, FRA, GBR, ITA and the USA with</p>
        <p>2 and C USA←• = 93.7, respectively. DEU, EU, FRA, GBR and ITA are European countries and the USA is American country, which also further support the regional characteristics.</p>
        <p>With respect to the pairwise connectedness in Table 5, the large pairwise connectedness also presents the synergies of regional and oilrelated characteristics. In addition to the pairwise connectedness from BRA, the rest of the large pairwise connectedness conditional on oil in extreme risk, i.e., the share of extreme risk changes are bigger than 10% when the oil market is in distress, includes the strong risk spillovers among American countries, where C BRA←CAN = 12.8, C USA←CAN = 14.5 and C USA←MEX = 13.1; those cross large oil exporters with C CAN←RUS = 11.1; and those among some European countries including DEU, EU, FRA, GBR and ITA.</p>
        <p>Fig. 2 shows the dynamic total directional connectedness for the G20 stock CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.05 connectedness conditional on oil in extreme risk during the crisis period. On the whole, the dynamic total directional connectedness for the G20 CoVaR network also presents regional risk spillover characteristics. The total from-degrees of some European countries, including DEU, EU, FRA, GBR and ITA, are relatively stable. Note: The blue, cyan and green indicate the large pairwise directional connectedness belongs to 10.0-11.9, 12.0-13.9 and 14.0-20.0, and the red and yellow indicate the large total to-degree and total from-degree, respectively.</p>
        <p>Fig. 2. Dynamic total directional connectedness for G20 stock CoVa-R stock|oil 0.05|0.05 in the crisis period.</p>
        <p>The total to-degrees have more complex characteristics over the crisis period compared with the total from-degrees. Most countries, however, have increased total to-degrees after the second half of 2011, indicating that most countries also transmit more risk shocks to other G20 stocks when the oil market is in extreme risk. Some European countries, including DEU, EU, FRA and GBR, have similar trends, where the dynamic to-degree line weakly slopes from the lower left to the upper right, indicating that the average level of receiving risk shocks from other G20 stocks has a minor increase over the crisis period conditional on oil in extreme risk. Meanwhile, ITA's to-degree has little changes over the time. For the American countries, ARG and the USA have a few changes and BRA, CAN and MEX have large changes, with BRA and MEX having increased to-degrees and CAN having a decreased to-degree in 2010. Particularly, big differences exist among the Asian countries' dynamic total to-degrees conditional on oil in extreme risk. The dynamic to-degrees have small changes for CHN and KOR and big changes for SAU and TUR. Meanwhile, the dynamic to-degrees of some Asian countries, including IDN, IND, JPN and TUR, present some small declines conditional on oil in extreme risk.</p>
        <p>The dynamic total net directional connectedness shows that BRA, CAN, MEX and RUS tend to net transmit risk shocks to other G20 stocks and ITA, KOR and the USA tend to net receive risk shocks from other G20 stocks most of the time conditional on oil being in an extreme risk state. Other important oil importers, such as CHN and JPN, also tend to net receive risk shocks from other G20 stocks most of the time.</p>
        <p>Fig. 3 shows the dynamic delta total connectedness for the G20 stocks' CoVaR network in the crisis period, i.e., the difference between total connectedness for the G20 CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.05 connectedness and that for the G20 CoVaR stock|oil 0.05|0.5 connectedness. The delta total connectedness means the changes of the systemic connectedness of G20 stock risks conditional on oil in extreme risk relative to oil in a normal state, reflecting the extreme risk spillovers from the oil market to the G20 stock system. We can find that the delta total connectedness line is above the zero line, falling in the range from 0 to 6, most of the time over the whole crisis period. These results further indicate that the systemic connectedness of the G20 stocks' CoVaR network tends to increase when the oil market transforms to extreme risk from a normal state. Fig. 4 shows the delta total directional connectedness for the G20 stocks' CoVaR network in the crisis period, i.e., the total directional connectedness for the G20 stocks' CoVaR conditional on oil in extreme risk relative to oil in a normal state. On the whole, we can find that the oil risk spillovers to the G20 stock system also have regional characteristics for the oil-related countries in the corresponding region. Concretely, most American and European countries' total from-degrees have small changes and their total to-degrees have large changes when oil market transforms to extreme tail risk from the normal state. However, most Asian countries' total from-degrees and to-degrees have little changes, even for the oil-related countries. For the European countries, the EU, FRA and GBR are similar with small increases in the total from-degrees and large increases in the total to-degrees and net-degrees; meanwhile, DEU, ITA and RUS are similar where DEU and ITA have small increases in their total from-degrees and small decreases in their total to-degrees and net-degrees; and RUS, a large oil exporter, has a small increase in its total from-degree but a large decrease in its total todegree and net-degree, indicating that RUS will tend to transmit less risk shocks when the oil market is in extreme risk.</p>
        <p>For the American countries, BRA and CAN are similar with little changes in their total from-degrees but extreme large changes in their total to-degrees, which indicate that they will tend to transmit more risk shocks to other G20 stocks when the oil market suffers distress. However, ARG, MEX and the USA have relatively large increases in their total from-degrees among all G20 countries and large decreases in their total to-degrees and net-degrees, indicating that ARG, MEX and the USA will tend to receive more but transmit less risk shocks to other G20 stocks from the systemic perspective when the oil market transforms to extreme risk from a normal state. Particularly, the total from-degrees, total to-degrees and net-degrees have little changes for most Asian countries, even for the important oil related countries, including CHN, JPN and SAU. CHN is a large oil importer among the important emerging BRICS countries, JPN is also another large net oil importer, and SAU is an important oil exporter and a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). This indicates that the oil extreme risk spillovers are relatively weak for Asian stock markets from a systemic perspective.</p>
        <p>Fig. 5 shows top net pairwise directional connectedness for the G20 stock tail risk VaR network and the conditional tail risk CoVaR network conditional on oil in extreme risk. We can simply compare the differences between the unconditional tail risk network, the VaR connectedness, the conditional tail risk connectedness, and CoVaR network conditional on oil in extreme risk to analyse the extreme risk spillovers from oil to G20 stocks from a systemic perspective, similar to the comparison between VaR and CoVaR from the pairwise perspective. On the whole, when the oil market transforms from a normal state to an extreme risk state, the G20 tail risk network changes also present regional characteristics, where American countries have the largest changes followed by some European countries, and Asian countries have little changes. Among the American countries, CAN has the largest changes with 1 in-arrow reducing and 5 out-arrows increasing and is followed by ARG and the USA with 2 in-arrows increasing and MEX with 2 out-arrows reducing when the oil market transforms to extreme risk. The EU, FRA and ITA have increased two arrows while DEU and GBR have reduced two arrows for the European area conditional on oil market transforming to the extreme risk state.</p>
        <p>Taking all results together, the oil risk spillover magnitude obviously increased during the crisis period compared with pre-crisis and postcrisis periods, and also significant for most countries during the crisis period. Thus, most countries should be on guard against the risk contagion from oil market to global stock markets when the market extreme event occurs in the global financial system. Particularly, other countries should keep watch on Brazil and Canada's stock market risk spillovers and their changes as well as some European countries, i.e. France and Germany, because their to-others spillover magnitude increases significantly when oil market changes from normal state to extreme risk state. Meanwhile, the oil-related characteristics is obvious. The stocks of oil-related countries may be more sensitive to oil extreme risks, and the global stocks total connectedness will increase less than six at most time when oil market transforms from normal state to extreme risks state, further supporting and supplementing the pairwise results of ΔCoVaR and the conclusions of Kang et al. (2015), Mensi et al. (2017) and Ji et al. (2020) from a new system perspective. With respect to the regional financial contagion characteristics, the stock series may contain more common information or common factors for different countries at the same region, e.g. trading time, market extreme events, traders and the like. In these cases, the capitals may be more easily transformed from one country's stock market to that of another country, making their internal directional network connectedness stronger. Meanwhile, the common regional extreme events may also urge the same regions' stock markets to tend to crash together, causing the risk contagion appearing obvious regional characteristics. These findings may further complement the researches of Glick and Rose (1999), Byrne et al. (2018) and Ma et al. (2019).</p>
        <p>This paper combines the VaR and CoVaR models with network connectedness based on the LASSO-VAR method to analyse the oil extreme risk spillovers to G20 stocks from both pairwise and systemic perspectives. The methodology in this paper offers a new framework to model the financial risk contagion or conditional financial contagion from the financial system perspective, and the empirical results are also helpful for investors and policy makers to understand the G20 stock and oil market financial contagion laws, regulate the stock markets, monitor oil extreme risks, and even prevent financial systemic risk.</p>
        <p>Regarding the methodology, the CoVaR connectedness can explore the financial contagion or risk spillovers conditional on market extreme risks occurring outside the specific system. Further, the CoVaR delta connectedness, which is derived from two CoVaR's connectedness conditional on the same variable in different states, can also explore the financial contagion in cases where the contagion sources are outside the system.</p>
        <p>The delta CoVaR (ΔCoVaR) results show that when separating every G20 stock market from the whole market system, there are significant risk spillovers from oil to the G20 stocks only during the crisis period. Further, the G20 stocks' CoVaR connectedness results also show that when considering all G20 stock markets as a whole, the financial contagion presents obvious regional characteristics conditional on oil in extreme risk during the crisis period. Meanwhile, the delta CoVaR network further supports the regional risk spillover characteristics and indicates that significant risk spillovers exist from the oil market to the G20 stock system where American oil-related countries are most affected and Asian countries have little changes when the oil market transforms to extreme risk from a normal state.</p>
        <p>The above findings have two main policy implications after combining the empirical results from both the pairwise and systemic perspectives. First, financial investors and regulators should focus on the stock risk spillovers from American countries and large oil exporters including Brazil, Canada, Mexico and Russia when the oil market is in extreme risk because they are main risk transmitters with the largest toothers risk transmissions in the whole stocks system. Meanwhile, the (caption on next column) European countries including Germany, the European Union, France, Britain and Italy should pay special attention to the financial contagion within the European area conditional on oil in extreme risk because they have largest pairwise risk connectedness among all G20 stocks, and Italy should focus on the risk spillovers from Germany, the European Union and France, particularly when the oil market is in extreme risk. Second, risk managers and policy makers also need to take strict precautions against extreme risk spillovers from the oil market during a crisis period, though the total systemic network connectedness increases by no more than 6 under the DY framework most of the time. On this point, all selected American countries', some European countries' and BRICS's oil-related countries' stocks are affected largely by oil when it is in extreme risk. Among these large affected stocks, Brazil, Canada, the European Union, France, Britain and South Africa should watch for increased risk transmissions and Argentina, India, Mexico, Russia and the United States should prevent receiving more risks when the oil market transforms to the extreme risk from a normal state. Particularly, American countries should pay more attention to the oil risk spillovers among the above largely affected countries because of the increased top 30% net pairwise directional connectedness caused by oil in extreme risk.</p>
        <p>In short, the methodological framework and empirical results in this paper can provide researchers, investors and policy makers who are involved in financial risk management some valuable guidance and significant references.
