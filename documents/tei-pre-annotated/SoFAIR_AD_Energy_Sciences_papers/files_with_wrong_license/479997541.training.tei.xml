        <p>The photoactive features of the least common polymorph of TiO2, i.e. brookite, were combined with the thermocatalytic redox ones of cerium oxide, focusing on the effects of the addition of small amounts of Co-Cu oxides for the solar CO2 conversion. By considering the characterization data, surface segregation of the hosted metal oxides on the TiO2-CeO2 composite was evidenced, and their presence increased the amount of oxygen vacancies and improved the charge carriers separation. The bimetallic oxidesbased sample was the most performing one in the photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction at room temperature. The formation of carbon monoxide and methane was 5 and 0.5 μmol/g•h, respectively, i.e. about 10 times higher than that found with bare brookite. A further enhancement was obtained with the same CoO-CuO/TiO2-CeO2 catalyst applying the photothermal approach. The CO2-TPD and the FTIR measurements highlighted the high interaction between CO2 and the surface sites.The photoactive features of the least common polymorph of TiO2, i.e. brookite, were combined with the thermocatalytic redox ones of cerium oxide, focusing on the effects of the addition of small amounts of Co-Cu oxides for the solar CO2 conversion.

        <p>The production of solar fuels, directly obtained through the photocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide, is a charming route that fits the principles of the green and sustainable chemistry [1]. This process is usually called "artificial photosynthesis" because it allows the formation of value-added fuels (as CO, CH4, CH3OH, etc.) starting from CO2 and merely using a semiconductor photocatalyst irradiated with solar light [2,3]. Among the inorganic semiconductors employed for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2, titanium dioxide (TiO2, titania) is one of the most investigated materials, due to its low cost, low toxicity, and high stability [4,5]. However, TiO2 showed a low activity under the solar light irradiation, due to its wide band-gap (ca. 3.0, 3.2 and 3.3 eV, depending on the crystalline polymorphs, i.e. rutile, anatase, and brookite, respectively). Furthermore, due to the presence of surface acid sites on TiO2, a weak interaction can occur between titania and CO2, with a low activation of the latter molecule [5,6]. The addition of cocatalysts with basic surface properties or the preparation of TiO2-based composites are effective strategies to improve the CO2 adsorption and its conversion into fuels, providing also an efficient charge carriers separation [7]. To further improve the conversion and the selectivity towards the solar fuels, it is possible to exploit the synergism between photocatalytic and thermocatalytic processes [8,9]. The simultaneous action of heating and solar photoexcitation favours the reduction of CO2, which is an endothermic reaction and the contemporary water oxidation [10,11].The production of solar fuels, directly obtained through the photocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide, is a charming route that fits the principles of the green and sustainable chemistry [1].

        <p>In this context, the coupling of the photocatalytic features of TiO2 and the thermocatalytic redox ones of cerium oxide (CeO2, ceria) can be an efficient approach to increase the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 [12][13][14]. Several beneficial effects can derive from the presence of CeO2 as hosted oxide of TiO2 in the photo(thermo) reduction of CO2 because (i) the surface basic sites of cerium oxide can improve the CO2 adsorption, favouring its activation [15]; (ii) the TiO2-CeO2 heterojunction avoids the recombination between the photoproduced electrons and holes [12,16]; (iii) the high mobility of oxygen on the surface of ceria favours the redox cycle Ce 4+ /Ce 3+ inducing the increase of non-stoichiometric cerium oxide species. Indeed, these defective sites can be occupied by the oxygen atoms of CO2, increasing its adsorption and decreasing its activation energy [17,18].In this context, the coupling of the photocatalytic features of TiO2 and the thermocatalytic redox ones of cerium oxide (CeO2, ceria) can be an efficient approach to increase the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 [12][13][14].

Before the photocatalytic tests, the samples were left overnight under He flow and UV irradiation (using a 100W mercury lamp, Black-Ray B-100A, 365 nm) in order to desorb the possible impurities and the carbonaceous species arising from the sample surface. Subsequently, water vapour was introduced together with the He under irradiation and various portions of the gas leaving the reactor were analysed by gas-chromatography (GC) to monitor the effectiveness of the cleaning process and the possible presence of residual carbonaceous contamination [27].The CO2 photoreduction at room temperature was performed using a home-made quartz reactor, filling it with 0.2 g of catalyst and irradiating with a solar lamp (Osram Ultra Vitalux 300W, irradiance of 10.7 mW/cm 2 ).

        <p>One of the critical issues in the use of brookite TiO2 is the choice of the appropriate preparation method and the thermal treatments to obtain a pure brookite crystalline phase, without rutile and anatase [21]. The thermohydrolysis of TiCl4 in HCl solution is an established procedure to obtain pure brookite [24]. Raman spectroscopy was employed to verify the presence of pure brookite phase and to analyze the structural properties of the as-synthesized composites. Compared to XRD characterization the Raman spectroscopy is more accurate for brookite detection due to the detection of typical vibration modes, whereas to clearly identify the XRD brookite signals, a structure refinement method is required [21] .One of the critical issues in the use of brookite TiO2 is the choice of the appropriate preparation method and the thermal treatments to obtain a pure brookite crystalline phase, without rutile and anatase [21].

        <p>The Fig. 1A illustrates the Raman spectra of the samples.

        <p>The typical vibrational mode at 154 cm -1 is characteristic of the brookite phase and the absence of vibrational bands at 516 cm -1 (due to anatase TiO2) and 446 cm -1 (rutile TiO2) confirmed the pure brookite formation [13,24], as also verified with the XRD patterns of all the investigated samples (Fig. S1).The typical vibrational mode at 154 cm -1 is characteristic of the brookite phase and the absence of vibrational bands at 516 cm -1 (due to anatase TiO2) and 446 cm -1 (rutile TiO2) confirmed the pure brookite formation [13,24], as also verified with the XRD patterns of all the investigated samples (Fig. S1).</p>
        <p>In the composites with CeO2, the main vibrational mode of cerium oxide at 463 cm -1 related to the F2g vibrational mode of the cubic fluorite structure [29] overlaps with the second B2g mode of brookite. The absence of signals related to the Cu and/or Co species in the Co/TiCe3, Cu/TiCe3 and Co-Cu/TiCe3 samples, can be due to the low amount of the metal species present in the composites and/or to their good dispersion on the brookite-ceria composite [30]. The structural modifications related to the metal oxides are indeed highlighted by the Raman shift of the main brookite band (Fig. 1B). In particular, a 0.9 cm -1 shift to lower wavenumbers was observed in Co/TiCe3 compared to pure brookite. In the bimetallic oxides sample this redshift is more evident (1.9 cm -1 ).In the composites with CeO2, the main vibrational mode of cerium oxide at 463 cm -1 related to the F2g vibrational mode of the cubic fluorite structure [29] overlaps with the second B2g mode of brookite.

This size variation can be due to the establishment of a mutual interaction between the metal oxides particles when they are contemporary present in the TiO2-CeO2 composite, thus influencing their growth and their dispersion [33,34]. However, the possible presence of aggregates of nanooxides on the TiCe3 cannot be excluded.The estimated mean particle diameter was 6 nm for the cobalt oxide in the Co/TiCe3 sample (Fig. 2B), 13 nm for the CuO in the Cu/TiCe3 (Fig. 2C) whereas in the Co-Cu/TiCe3 catalysts the CoO and CuO oxides exhibited a similar mean size (10 nm and 9 nm for the cobalt and copper oxides respectively, Fig. 2D).

        <p>The textural features of the samples are reported in the Table 1. The presence of ceria caused a notable decrease in the surface area of brookite from 100 m 2 /g to 68 m 2 /g and a slight increase in the pore volume and the mean pore diameter. The addition of the metal oxides, instead, did not substantially modify the textural features of the TiCe3 sample. These findings can be ascribed to the inclusion of CeO2 in the TiO2 and to the thermal treatments (calcination in air) carried out to eliminate the nitrates of the metal salt precursors of ceria, copper and cobalt [37].The textural features of the samples are reported in the Table 1.

        <p>Figure 3 illustrates the results of the UV-DRS measurements, plotting the Kubelka-Munk function, vs λ. The spectra of brookite TiO2 and TiCe3 are similar, with no substantial changes due to the addition of ceria, but those of the other samples show a less significant reflectance in the 200-400 nm wavelength range, probably due to an increased absorption by cobalt and copper species present on their surface. The optical band gap of the catalysts with a single metal (the inset of Fig. 3 shows the graph of Co-Cu/TiCe3 as representative sample) are basically the same as that of brookite, being 3.24 eV for the latter, 3.26 eV for the TiCe3 and Cu/TiCe3 composites, and 3.25 eV for the Co/TiCe3 sample, whereas the addition of the bimetallic oxides led to a slightly higher band gap (3.31 eV), probably due to an interaction between the two metallic species which can influence the absorption.Figure 3 illustrates the results of the UV-DRS measurements, plotting the Kubelka-Munk function, vs λ.

        <p>On the contrary, some interesting optical features were detected investigating the photoluminescence responses of the samples (Fig. 4). The PL spectra of pure brookite present four typical bands. In accordance with the literature data, the band at 390 nm is reasonably attributed to the band-to-band emission of titania and that at 432 nm to the self-trapped excitons present in the crystalline structure of brookite. Moreover, the band at 460 nm is due to the presence of oxygen vacancies, and the PL band at 555 nm is usually related to the excited electrons trapped in the mid-gap levels (i.e. defect centers) [38]. In the composite with CeO2 it can be noticed the occurrence of a quenching of the PL bands at 390 nm and 430 nm, whilst the band at 460 nm of TiO2 overlaps with those at about 463 nm attributed to the CeO2 band to band emission [39]. Notably, the addition of the metal oxide species resulted in a further decrease of the PL bands of TiO2 and CeO2. A broad band is visible in the 480-510 nm range for the Co/TiCe3 sample probably due to the formation of oxygen vacancies induced by the cobalt oxide [40]. In fact, the presence of small amounts of metal nanoxides, and in particular of cobalt oxides, facilitated the creation of new oxygen vacancies as intrinsic defects inside the principal oxide (in this case the TiO2-CeO2 system) [41]. Generally, a lower intensity of the PL bands is connected to a decrease of the charge recombination among the photoelectrons and the photoholes. Consequently, the diminution of the band intensity can be associated to an increase of the effectiveness in the charge carriers separation [42]. Therefore, the above results indicate that the addition of copper and/or cobalt species to the TiO2-CeO2 composites permitted to decrease the photoelectrons/holes recombination and to increase the number of defects in the composite, as confirmed by the Raman measurements.

        <p>The surface electronic structure was studied using XPS. Results for the bare brookite TiO2 showed sharp titanium spin-orbit bands at 459.2 and 465.0 eV (Fig. 5A). A careful deconvolution of the Ti spectrum profile revealed the presence of an additional spinorbit component at 457.6 and 462.5 eV due to the presence of some surface Ti 3+ states, as a result of the presence of oxygen vacancies (Fig. S3A) [13,26]. Fig. 5A shows the XPS of TiCe3, Co/TiCe3, Cu/TiCe3 and Co-Cu/TiCe3 catalysts, in the Ti 2p energy region. Apart from a negligible different band broadening, no relevant binding energy differences were detected, being all of them at 0.3 eV of lower binding energy (BE) with respect to the pure brookite TiO2. This observation can be justified by taking into account the electronegativity of titanium (1.5) larger than that of cerium (1.1), thus indicating their electronic interaction. Fig. S3B shows the fitted representative high-resolution XP spectrum of the Co-Cu/TiCe3 sample in the Ti 2p binding energy region. The fitting required two Gaussian spin-orbit doublets (Ti 2p3/2 at 458.9 and 457.0 eV; Ti 2p1/2 at 464.6 and 462.2 eV). The main doublet is associated with the Ti 4+ species of the brookite phase [13], while the weak doublet shifted ~2 eV to lower binding energy, and it is due to the presence of the residual surface Ti 3+ cations after interaction with Ce 4+ ions [43,44].The surface electronic structure was studied using XPS.

        <p>Obviously, the presence of some Ti 3+ cations on the TiO2 surface is essential for this redox process, and we already evidenced a minor spin-orbit component at 457.0 and 462.2 eV due to the not complete axial coordination of the surface Ti cation in TiO2 that leads to some surface Ti reduction (vide supra) [44]. Practically, any electronic communication between CeO2 and TiO2 is limited to the topmost ionic layers of these nanostructures, confirming the presence of a heterojunction between the TiO2 and CeO2 interfaces as verified by the TEM measurements.

        <p>A first catalytic screening was performed by using the three TiCe1, TiCe3 and TiCe5 samples synthesized with a rising loading of CeO2 deposited on brookite TiO2. The solar photocatalytic conversion of CO2 at room temperature on these catalysts is reported in the Fig. 6A. Under the experimental conditions used, only CO and CH4 were detected as reaction products, whereas the amount of evolved hydrogen, arising from the water splitting reaction, was negligible. Specifically, carbon monoxide was the main product of the CO2 conversion when brookite TiO2-based photocatalysts were used together with water vapour as the reducing agent [5,14]. The photoconversion of CO2 to CO requires two electrons with a more negative potential (i.e. -0.53 V at pH 7 vs. NHE) compared to the photoproduction of methane (-0.24 V), which but requires eight electrons [28].A first catalytic screening was performed by using the three TiCe1, TiCe3 and TiCe5 samples synthesized with a rising loading of CeO2 deposited on brookite TiO2.

The CO2-TPD curves (Fig. 8) recorded between room temperature and 600°C can be divided into three parts indicated as α, β and γ, and associated to weak, medium and strong sites, respectively [50]. The weak basic sites are usually identified with the surface hydroxyl groups on metal oxides which form hydrogen carbonate by interacting weakly with CO2.

        <p>From the Fig. 8 it is clear as the surface sites of the samples changed on the basis of the specific chemical modifications of brookite TiO2. The pure TiO2 showed only weak desorption features in the high-temperature zone. The addition of small amount of cerium oxide (TiCe3 sample) led to an increase in the CO2 adsorption capacity. In fact, slightly more intense signals related to the moderate (β) and strong basic sites (γ) can be observed. Three desorption peaks are visible in the profile of Co/TiCe3, two more intense at 84°C and at 453°C and a feeble one at 246°C, indicating the prevalent introduction of weak and strong basic sites by cobalt. The presence of copper (Cu/TiCe3), on the other hand, introduced moderate basic sites and improved bridgetype adsorption of CO2. The CO2-TPD profile of the Co-Cu/TiCe3 points to a strong interaction between the CO2 and the surface sites of this catalyst as indicated by the presence of the β and γ peaks. Indeed, this sample showed a peak at 308°C, similarly to the Cu/TiCe3 powder, and two peaks at 108°C and 469°C slightly shifted at higher temperature (stronger CO2 interaction) compared to those of Co/TiCe3. Furthermore, another signal (at 396°C) was detected. The desorption peaks in the range 380-570°C were related to the decomposition of (bidentate) carbonate species, whereas the features between 180-380°C and between 550-780°C are due to the decomposition of hydrogen carbonates and monodentate carbonates respectively [14,50]. Only for a general comparison, the CO2-TPD curves of the pure CuO, CoO and of CoO-CuO prepared by chemical precipitation are reported in the supporting information (Fig. S5). It is important to highlight, in fact, that a real comparison is not possible considering that in our work the bimetallic Co-Cu oxides were added as co-catalysts in small amount (0.3wt%-0.3wt%) on brookite TiO2-CeO2, using a different preparation method (impregnation) compared to the synthesis of the bare CuO, CoO and of the mixture CoO-CuO (that required a chemical precipitation). Furthermore, the CO2 interaction was influenced by the presence of both the acid sites of TiO2 and mainly the basic sites of CeO2.From the Fig. 8 it is clear as the surface sites of the samples changed on the basis of the specific chemical modifications of brookite TiO2. The pure TiO2 showed only weak desorption features in the high-temperature zone. The addition of small amount of cerium oxide (TiCe3 sample) led to an increase in the CO2 adsorption capacity. In fact, slightly more intense signals related to the moderate (β) and strong basic sites (γ) can be observed. Three desorption peaks are visible in the profile of Co/TiCe3, two more intense at 84°C and at 453°C and a feeble one at 246°C, indicating the prevalent introduction of weak and strong basic sites by cobalt. The presence of copper (Cu/TiCe3), on the other hand, introduced moderate basic sites and improved bridgetype adsorption of CO2.

        <p>Surface enrichment of the metal oxides due to phase segregation was noticed on Co/TiCe3, Cu/TiCe3 and Co-Cu/TiCe3 samples, as indicated by XPS results. This facilitated the CO2 adsorption especially in the Co-Cu/TiCe3 sample where multiple metal surface sites allowed to establish a strong interaction with CO2, which occurs instead with much lower strength in the bare brookite and in the TiCe3 composite.Surface enrichment of the metal oxides due to phase segregation was noticed on Co/TiCe3, Cu/TiCe3 and Co-Cu/TiCe3 samples, as indicated by XPS results.

        <p>To further confirm the formation of the carbonate species after the adsorption of CO2 on the surface of the TiCe3-based catalysts, we have compared the FTIR spectra of the Co/TiCe3, Cu/TiCe3 and Co-Cu/TiCe3 samples before and after the photothermocatalytic tests (Fig. 9).To further confirm the formation of the carbonate species after the adsorption of CO2 on the surface of the TiCe3-based catalysts, we have compared the FTIR spectra of the Co/TiCe3, Cu/TiCe3 and Co-Cu/TiCe3 samples before and after the photothermocatalytic tests (Fig. 9).</p>
        <p>Before the activity runs all samples exhibited the typical FTIR spectra of TiO2-based materials with a broad band at around 3500-3400 cm -1 and a peak at around 1610-1620 cm -1 assigned to the stretching and bending modes of the hydroxyl groups, respectively. These bands can be due to both the residual water molecules and the Ti-OH bonds. The broad band observed in the range 700-600 cm -1 is attributed to the Ti-O-Ti vibrations (Figs. 9 and S6) [12]. After the photothermal tests, it is possible to note the formation of new bands in the (hydrogen)carbonate zone (1400-1050 cm). All samples showed a strong band at 1383-1384 cm -1 , assigned to the symmetric stretching of carboxylate molecules [51]. Co/TiCe3 showed a spectrum with a small signal at 1114 cm -1 of the bridged bidentate carbonates [51]. The Cu/TiCe3 sample exhibited signals at 1187 and 1115 cm -1 related to bridged carbonates, while the band at 1068 cm -1 is assigned to the νC-O of monodentate carbonate [51]. In the Co-Cu/TiCe3 catalyst, two small bands at 1215 and 1131 cm -1 can be assigned to bridged bidentate carbonates, whereas the feature at about 1036 cm -1 to small amounts of hydrogen carbonates [51].Before the activity runs all samples exhibited the typical FTIR spectra of TiO2-based materials with a broad band at around 3500-3400 cm -1 and a peak at around 1610-1620 cm -1 assigned to the stretching and bending modes of the hydroxyl groups, respectively.

        <p>The contemporaneous presence of different surface metal sites (mainly Co, Cu and/or Co-Cu centers due to surface segregation as evidenced by XPS) favoured the formation of both hydrogen carbonates and bridged bidentate carbonates species in the Co-Cu/TiCe3 catalyst, with a beneficial effect in the CO2 reduction. As reported in the literature, the bidentate binding mode of carbon dioxide, with the formation of bidentate carbonates favours the formation of CO through the bidentate formate species as intermediate and a successive transformation of CO into CH4 [4,52]. Note that during the catalytic and photocatalytic measurements no formic acid was detected. This acid was instead reported as a common product of the CO2 photoreduction performed in aqueous (liquid) media [28]. Furthermore, the presence of hydrogen carbonates is beneficial because they can act as holes scavenger and can be also converted into other bidentate formate species [4,52]. This is one of the key features that can explain the improved performance of this bimetallic oxide-based catalyst with respect to the others.The contemporaneous presence of different surface metal sites (mainly Co, Cu and/or Co-Cu centers due to surface segregation as evidenced by XPS) favoured the formation of both hydrogen carbonates and bridged bidentate carbonates species in the Co-Cu/TiCe3 catalyst, with a beneficial effect in the CO2 reduction.

        <p>The formation of the carbonate species after the photothermo catalytic measurements was also confirmed by the comparison of the XPS spectra in C 1s region before and after the test (Fig. S7, Co-Cu/TiCe3 chosen as representative sample).

        <p>Furthermore, the XP spectrum of the sample measured after the CO2 photoreduction also exhibits a peak at 289.0 eV ascribed to the carbonate species (-CO3 2-), thus confirming their formation during the reaction.

        <p>The photo(thermo) catalytic results and the characterization data here reported can be discussed in terms of different synergisms, which are involved in determining the final performance of the investigated samples.The photo(thermo) catalytic results and the characterization data here reported can be discussed in terms of different synergisms, which are involved in determining the final performance of the investigated samples.</p>
        <p>The first exploited synergism is the "energy synergism" between the photocatalytic and the thermocatalytic mechanisms. The multi catalytic approach allowed to increase the solar fuel formation (Fig. 6 and Fig. 7). The heating, as well as to increase the rate of the CO2 conversion and of the water oxidation [10,11], promoted the oxygens mobility of the reducible oxides as CeO2, CoO and CuO, and the presence of oxygen vacancies in the CeO2 (generated by the Ce 3+ species as confirmed by XPS) was further increased by the simultaneous addition of copper and cobalt species in the Co-Cu/TiCe3 sample (as confirmed by XPS, Raman and PL measurements). These oxygen vacancies sensibly decrease the energy for the adsorption of CO2. It is indeed reported that carbon dioxide preferentially adsorbs on oxygen defective sites [17,18]. Furthermore, to have an efficient CO2 reduction, the electron and proton transfers should be synchronous.The first exploited synergism is the "energy synergism" between the photocatalytic and the thermocatalytic mechanisms.

        <p>Considering that the time scale for the electron transfer is picoseconds whereas that of proton transfer is hundreds of microseconds, the rate determining step of the reaction should be the H + transfer process [6,8]. In this contest, the contemporaneous presence of solar and thermal energy leads to enhance, as reported in the literature, the proton transfers [53] obtaining beneficial multiple protons/electrons transfers.Considering that the time scale for the electron transfer is picoseconds whereas that of proton transfer is hundreds of microseconds, the rate determining step of the reaction should be the H + transfer process [6,8].

        <p>We want to highlight that this synergism between thermo and photocatalysis had a positive effect only if the photocatalytic mechanism was simultaneously activated. Indeed, no CO and CH4 formation was detected in the thermocatalytic tests up to 300°C. Although, in fact, the presence of the oxygen vacancies facilitates the adsorption of CO2, its further conversion requires multi proton/electron transfers, that can be generated by the photocatalytic mechanism, or higher temperatures (T&gt;300°C) necessary for the carbon dioxide dissociation [4,5,54] as also stated by the CO2-TPD. A confirmation of the mutual positive effect between the photocatalytic and the thermocatalytic mechanisms was highlighted by the solar photothermal results performed at increasing temperature with the most performing sample (the Co-Cu/TiCe3 catalyst) (Fig. S8). The high temperature promotes the CeO2 redox properties [12] favouring the CO/CH4 formation. It is possible to notice that the beneficial synergistic effect led to a linear growth in the evolution of CO and CH4 up to about 2 times every 60° C of temperature increase.We want to highlight that this synergism between thermo and photocatalysis had a positive effect only if the photocatalytic mechanism was simultaneously activated.

        <p>The CO2-TPD and the FTIR measurements pointed to a peculiar "surface sites synergism" particularly evident on the bimetallic oxides sample, considering also that the XPS stated the surface segregation of these species on the TiCe3. The strong interaction of CO2 with the multiple metal surface sites favoured its adsorption and activation. Considering the results obtained which highlighted the greater performance of the Co-Cu/TiCe3 catalyst compared to the other samples, the proposed mechanism of photothermocatalytic conversion of CO2 is illustrated in Fig. 10.The CO2-TPD and the FTIR measurements pointed to a peculiar "surface sites synergism" particularly evident on the bimetallic oxides sample, considering also that the XPS stated the surface segregation of these species on the TiCe3.

        <p>Under solar irradiation, the photogenerated electrons and holes were efficiently separated due to the heterojunction (detected by TEM) between the brookite TiO2 and the CeO2. The conduction and the valence band levels of CeO2 and brookite TiO2 allowed the generation of CO and CH4 and the oxidation of water with the formation of H + [14]. Copper and cobalt oxides acted as efficient co-catalysts, which allowed to increase the solar fuel formation and to efficiently separate the charge carriers as confirmed by the PL characterization. In fact, the excited electrons can react with the adsorbed CO2 while the holes interacting with the CoO-CuO co-catalysts, boost up the oxidation of water and the generation of protons. The surface segregation of these oxides on brookite-cerium oxide enabled the improvement of the interaction with carbon dioxide molecules also favoring the formation of carbonate species as intermediates, which paved the way for the conversion of CO2 into CO and CH4.Under solar irradiation, the photogenerated electrons and holes were efficiently separated due to the heterojunction (detected by TEM) between the brookite TiO2 and the CeO2.

        <p>The contemporaneous presence of CoO and CuO on the surface of TiCe3 led to a holistic effect ("bimetallic oxide synergism") that permitted to increase the catalytic performance compared to the monometallic counterparts. The strong mutual interaction between the two metal oxides, that influenced their growth and dispersion on the TiCe3 as detected by TEM measurements, allowed to join the beneficial properties of copper and cobalt oxides. In particular, the CuO promoted the CO2 reduction, being an efficient co-catalyst for the electrons donation [5,23], the cobalt oxide facilitated the formation of oxygen vacancies, as detected by PL spectroscopy, and the holes trap, boosting the oxidation of water and protons formation [8,41]. Although these features could be exploited also in the monometallic CoO and CuO catalysts, the simultaneous addition of both oxides on the surface of TiCe3 synergistically increased the solar fuel formation.The contemporaneous presence of CoO and CuO on the surface of TiCe3 led to a holistic effect ("bimetallic oxide synergism") that permitted to increase the catalytic performance compared to the monometallic counterparts.

        <p>Finally, it is important to highlight that these peculiar synergisms were more effective in the presence of the pure brookite phase. Indeed, in the same experimental conditions, we have compared the performance in the photothermal test at 120°C of Co-Cu/TiCe3 sample with those of two samples prepared with the same synthesis but employing commercial anatase (Sigma Aldrich 637254) and rutile (Sigma Aldrich 224227) TiO2. The use of rutile led to the lowest CO/CH4 formation (Fig. S9). As reported, the CB energy level of rutile was not appropriate for the CO2 reduction into CO, whereas the CB edge of anatase was similar to that of brookite [23]. However, with the anatase TiO2-based composite the CO and CH4 production were lower (8 and 0.9 μmol g -1 h -1 respectively) compared to the brookite-based sample (12 and 1.84 μmol g -1 h - 1 for CO and CH4 respectively). The peculiar preparation mode of the pure brookite, its strong interaction with cerium oxide and its specific physico-chemical properties make this crystalline phase particularly suitable for the photoreduction reactions and for multi catalytic approaches [13,[55][56][57]. The good affinity between brookite TiO2 and CeO2 was further highlighted by comparing the photothermal activity of the Co-Cu/TiCe3 with those of Co-Cu/brookite TiO2 and the Co-Cu/CeO2 (Fig. S10). Indeed, the CO and the CH4 formation obtained with the Co-Cu/brookite TiO2 was about two times and five times lower of the Co-Cu/TiCe3 respectively, whereas the Co-Cu/CeO2 showed a very low activity being the CO formation 30 times lower than that observed with Co-Cu/TiCe3, without methane evolution. The 0.3-0.3 wt% was the optimal amount of the bimetallic oxides sample (Fig. S11), whereas a higher amount led to a detrimental effect, presumably due to excessive coverage of the active sites of TiO2 [12,16].Finally, it is important to highlight that these peculiar synergisms were more effective in the presence of the pure brookite phase.
