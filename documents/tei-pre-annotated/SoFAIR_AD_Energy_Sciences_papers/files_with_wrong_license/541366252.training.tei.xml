        <p>As mitigating climate change becomes an increasing worldwide focus, it is vital to explore a diverse range of technologies for reducing emissions. Heating and cooling make up a significant proportion of energy demand, both domestically and in industry. An effective method of reducing this energy demand is the storage and use of waste heat through the application of seasonal thermal energy storage, used to address the mismatch between supply and demand and greatly increasing the efficiency of renewable resources. Four methods of sensible heat storage; Tank, pit, borehole, and aquifer thermal energy storage are at the time of writing at a more advanced stage of development when compared with other methods of thermal storage and are already being implemented within energy systems. This review aims to identify some of the barriers to development currently facing these methods of seasonal thermal energy storage, and subsequently some of the work being undertaken to address these barriers in order to facilitate wider levels of adoption throughout energy systems.As mitigating climate change becomes an increasing worldwide focus, it is vital to explore a diverse range of technologies for reducing emissions.

        <p>With increasing focus being placed on reducing worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, Thermal Energy Storage (TES) is being explored as a method of reducing the environmental impact of heating and cooling. Within the EU, nearly 80% of total domestic energy use is for space heating and hot water, and within industry just over 70% of energy is used for space heating and industrial processes [1]. Worldwide, heat accounts for roughly 50% of final energy consumption and 40% of CO2 [2]. With most of the heating demand currently met through fossil fuel-based sources [3] and the demand for cooling set to increase dramatically [4], it is becoming ever more important to introduce measures of providing heating and cooling without incurring a significant increase in energy demand.With increasing focus being placed on reducing worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, Thermal Energy Storage (TES) is being explored as a method of reducing the environmental impact of heating and cooling.

        <p>TES is a way of addressing the mismatch in supply and demand between renewable resources and energy demand. Technology such as solar collectors are only productive during the day when domestic heating demand is at its lowest, and so in the evening once demand increases the heat is no longer available. Applying TES in combination with solar collectors with a short charge and release cycle enables the use of heat generated in times of surplus to be delivered to the heating system when conventional methods of heating would otherwise be used.TES is a way of addressing the mismatch in supply and demand between renewable resources and energy demand.

        <p>Seasonal Thermal Energy Storage (STES) takes this same concept of taking heat during times of surplus and storing it until demand increases but applied over a period of months as opposed to hours. Waste or excess heat generally produced in the summer when heating demand is low can be stored for periods of up to 6 months. The stored heat can then be re-introduced to heating systems throughout the winter as demand increases, negating some of the requirement to generate new heat and so lowering total energy consumption.Seasonal Thermal Energy Storage (STES) takes this same concept of taking heat during times of surplus and storing it until demand increases but applied over a period of months as opposed to hours.

        <p>Industrial excess heat is the heat exiting any industrial process at any given moment, divided into usable, internally usable, externally usable, and non-usable streams [5]. Waste heat can be recovered directly through recirculation or indirectly through heat exchangers and can be classified according to temperature as low grade (&lt; 100 °C), medium grade (100 -400 °C), or high grade (&gt;400 °C) [6], with low grade the most abundant but also most difficult to recover [7]. It is estimated that the total waste heat potential in the EU is approximately 300 TWh/year, with one third of this at temperatures below 200 °C [8]. STES is capable of harnessing and storing low grade heat, with the receiving temperature range determined by storage type and redistribution target. Storing heat at higher temperatures incurs higher thermal losses, yet enables heating provision without the need for heat pumps to raise fluid temperatures further reducing energy demand.Industrial excess heat is the heat exiting any industrial process at any given moment, divided into usable, internally usable, externally usable, and non-usable streams [5].

        <p>4 th generation District Heating Schemes (DHS) are heating networks that operate at lower temperatures, employing heat from locally produced renewable and secondary heat from geothermal and waste sources [9]. The introduction of 4 th generation DHS represents a shift towards lower temperature distribution systems, with supply temperatures in the region of 60 °C [10]. These lower operating temperatures are more suitable for the integration of renewable energy sources, and STES [9]. Collecting, storing, and redistributing even a small portion of the available waste heat would define a reasonable contribution towards heating requirements, both in industry and domestically.4 th generation District Heating Schemes (DHS) are heating networks that operate at lower temperatures, employing heat from locally produced renewable and secondary heat from geothermal and waste sources [9].

        <p>There are three types of TES: sensible, latent, and thermochemical. Sensible Heat Storage (SHS) is considered the simplest of the three, using a material to directly store heat within the body. Latent Heat Storage (LHS) uses thermal energy to induce a phase change within a material that then releases the thermal energy upon returning to its original state [11,12,13]. Thermochemical Heat Storage (THS) uses reversible chemical reactions to separate chemical compounds that can be recombined to generate heat [14,15,16].There are three types of TES: sensible, latent, and thermochemical.

        <p>SHS is currently the most developed and utilised form of TES with storage materials chosen according to their heat capacity, space availability, and cost with water the most popular choice. In comparison, materials like concrete can raise their temperature to over 1200 ℃, resulting in a much higher overall storage capacity. Tiskatine et al [17] present a comprehensive list of materials used for SHS and their associated material properties.SHS is currently the most developed and utilised form of TES with storage materials chosen according to their heat capacity, space availability, and cost with water the most popular choice.

        <p>Underground Thermal Energy Storage (UTES) makes use of favourable geological conditions directly as a thermal store or as in insulator for the storage of heat. UTES can be divided in to open and closed loop systems, with Tank Thermal Energy Storage (TTES), Pit Thermal Energy Storage (PTES), and Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) classified as open loop systems, and Borehole Thermal Energy Storage (BTES) as closed loop. Other methods of UTES such as cavern and mine TES exist but are seldom employed commercially. UTES can be used for both space cooling and heating, with or without heat pumps, although cooling is less common in BTES, TTES, and PTES systems whereas ATES actively benefits from receiving a balanced heating and cooling load.Underground Thermal Energy Storage (UTES) makes use of favourable geological conditions directly as a thermal store or as in insulator for the storage of heat.

        <p>Seasonal SHS faces several challenges that fail to impact shorter term thermal storage. Longer storage times make it necessary to use larger storage volumes to reduce thermal losses. As a result, capital expenditure is higher, generating accurate models is more difficult, and limitations through geographical and legal requirements can be restrictive. This review will evaluate research developments within SHS, and specifically the forms of UTES mentioned above. Although the technologies are capable of storing both heat and cold it will focus on the storage of heat, and will build on the work completed in previous reviews on TES technologies such as Xu et al [18] and Sarbu and Seberchievici [19]. In doing so the study will aim to identify some of the barriers each technology faces, and review the research undertaken to overcome these barriers to facilitate wider implementation of STES within energy systems. It will identify core areas of research associated with each technology, and present common uses and storage temperatures so that future decision making may be made easier.Seasonal SHS faces several challenges that fail to impact shorter term thermal storage.

        <p>An aquifer is a subsurface layer of water-bearing permeable rock that can be exploited to extract and store groundwater. While aquifers are geographically limited, they are often found underneath large population centres [20], making them useful for co-locating large storage potential with areas already likely to generate a large thermal energy demand. ATES has received renewed interest in recent years owing to its large storage capacities, low environmental impact, versatility of application, and improving economic viability [20,21].An aquifer is a subsurface layer of water-bearing permeable rock that can be exploited to extract and store groundwater.

        <p>Two differing well designs are used to facilitate thermal storage in aquifers. Multi-well systems use one or more sets of well doublets within the aquifer to store thermal energy at spaced lateral points separating hot and cold [22]. Mono-well systems separate hot and cold storage vertically through a single well resulting in reduced drilling costs and space requirements [23], although require an aquifer with a greater thickness to effectively separate the hot and cold regions and avoid thermal interaction. Figure 1 below indicates the difference between the two arrangements.Two differing well designs are used to facilitate thermal storage in aquifers.

        <p>ATES passes extracted groundwater through heat exchangers, providing heating and cooling as the groundwater acts as a heat sink and heat source in the summer and winter respectively prior to being re-injected to the aquifer. Warm well injection temperatures of reviewed systems varied between 13 -25 °C and cold injection temperatures were between 3 -17°C [24,25,26], with higher cooling temperatures used in hotter countries. The groundwater is re-injected with an upper limit approaching 25 °C to preserve the quality of the water within the aquifer [27]. Storage efficiencies are typically high for ATES systems, recovering between 67.5 -87 % of stored heat and cold, with increasing storage volume serving to improve storage efficiencies [23,28,29]. ATES is commonly installed in universities, hospitals, large commercial buildings, and airports [26], with ventilation cooling during summer often providing the heat to be stored and subsequently used for heating throughout the winter.ATES passes extracted groundwater through heat exchangers, providing heating and cooling as the groundwater acts as a heat sink and heat source in the summer and winter respectively prior to being re-injected to the aquifer.

        <p>Although ATES has been proven to be both energy and cost efficient the adoption rate has been slow, largely due to technical barriers such as unfamiliarity with the subsurface, presumed limited compatibility with existing energy systems, energy imbalances, and groundwater contamination, but also through legal frameworks [30,31].Although ATES has been proven to be both energy and cost efficient the adoption rate has been slow, largely due to technical barriers such as unfamiliarity with the subsurface, presumed limited compatibility with existing energy systems, energy imbalances, and groundwater contamination, but also through legal frameworks [30,31].</p>
        <p>Generating accurate models to predict the performance of ATES systems prior to installation is crucial to predict performance. Factors such as the composition, depth, surface area, thickness, transmissivity, and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer must be accounted for. This must be done in conjunction with groundwater parameters such as water quality, salinity, ambient groundwater flow, groundwater quantity, and groundwater recharge. Socio-economic factors, such as local legislation, energy demand, and carbon emissions must also be considered [31].Generating accurate models to predict the performance of ATES systems prior to installation is crucial to predict performance.

        <p>Computational models generated from local data are used to predict ATES performance. In this way design decisions can be made that will improve the storage and extraction efficiency of thermal energy. Mapping the thermally affected zone also helps to determine the storage capacity of the aquifer. With areas of high groundwater flowrate, it is possible for the heat to move beyond the influence of the wells and therefore be lost to recovery [32]. Well spacing is also important when considering the ATES system in question as part of a network of systems operating within a given area. Wells that are close to each other can influence each other's extraction temperatures. Interacting wells of a similar storage temperature improve system performance through positive thermal interaction reducing thermal losses throughout the aquifer, while for interacting wells of a nonsimilar storage temperature system performance is negatively affected [33].Computational models generated from local data are used to predict ATES performance.

        <p>Lu et al [31] performed an evaluation of global ATES potential to predict areas with a high suitability. The evaluation builds on previous work carried out such as that by Bloemendal et al [34] and Flauchaus [24], but accounts for a wider range of factors including groundwater, geo-hydrological, climatic, and socio-economic conditions, therefore improving the reliability of the results. The results are used to indicate areas predicted suitability for ATES in combination with existing urban areas, with the authors expecting findings to provide policy recommendations for governments and stimulate ATES applications. Areas with a high potential are predominantly spread throughout Europe, although coastal regions of North and South America, and Japan also present strong opportunities (Figure 2). Although global analysis is useful in predicting total potential, local characterisation is also needed. Boon et al [35] used the process set out by Kessler et al [36] and data from over 3000 historical geotechnical and geological borehole records through third parties to generate a 3D geological model. This was used to define the extent and thickness of the sand and gravel aquifer units and confining layers, however, was made easier through the extensive data already available. Using this method without historical data would require a drastic amount more work to be completed prior to the development of the underground model.Lu et al [31] performed an evaluation of global ATES potential to predict areas with a high suitability.

        <p>Lesparre et al [33] used electrical resistive tomography (ERT) to monitor 3D development of the thermally affected zone within an aquifer. By converting resistivity images produced through electrodes placed on the surface to temperature, an accurate picture of the extent to which heat dissipates throughout the aquifer can be developed. Visualisation of the thermally affected zone enables better placement of production and injection wells to minimise thermal interaction, but also assists in predicting the quantity of thermal energy that can be stored and subsequently recovered. SkyTEM [37] used airborne transient electromagnetics to map up to depths of 500 m, gathering data that complements the existing borehole measurements over the entirety of Denmark. Non-invasive methods are naturally preferable in terms of cost and disturbance of aquifers but require borehole measurements to validate data and ensure accuracy of results.Lesparre et al [33] used electrical resistive tomography (ERT) to monitor 3D development of the thermally affected zone within an aquifer.

        <p>The effective radius of each well is dependent on the rate of groundwater flow in the area, itself a function of the porosity and density of the aquifer. Ma et al [38] recorded the impact of increasing groundwater flow rate, finding that the thermal influence radii increased from 7.4 m to 143 m with an increase of groundwater velocity from 3.15 m/a to 315 m/a. Bakr et al [39] studied 19 ATES systems installed within a 3.8 km 2 area in The Hague, The Netherlands. Both positive and negative well interference was present, with a 20% improvement in performance in the best case and 25% decrease in performance in the worst. While overall there was a net average benefit of 3.5%, the importance of proper planning when locating ATES systems is highlighted, with the location of wells with similar injection and extraction temperatures vital to avoid impeding performance. While this issue is only likely to be prevalent in more mature markets such as The Netherlands, it is an important lesson to be learned for other countries currently introducing ATES as part of its energy network. By accurately capturing the properties of the sub-surface prior to installation it will be made easier to plan a network of systems that may benefit each other.The effective radius of each well is dependent on the rate of groundwater flow in the area, itself a function of the porosity and density of the aquifer.

        <p>Aquifers are heavily relied upon for drinking water, and in many cases are subject to heavy overexploitation [40]. The re-injection of warm water can result in the precipitation of minerals and growth of micro-organisms within aquifers, negatively impacting the quality of the water [41]. These issues also negatively impact the hydraulic qualities of the aquifer, hindering the performance of the ATES system with clogging of equipment a notable issue. Clogging is primarily caused by physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms with causes including the accumulation of particle deposits, precipitation of minerals, and accumulation of micro-organisms [42].Aquifers are heavily relied upon for drinking water, and in many cases are subject to heavy overexploitation [40].

        <p>Possemiers et al [43] reviewed the impact of ATES on groundwater quality with data taken from 69 monitoring wells between seven ATES systems in Belgium to evaluate mineral content within the water. The systems reviewed operate at small temperature differences between 6 -16 °C with no recorded influence on the main chemical compositions within the water found, and therefore no impact on groundwater quality. Mixing of shallow with deeper groundwater during the drilling of wells was however found to have a negative impact.Possemiers et al [43] reviewed the impact of ATES on groundwater quality with data taken from 69 monitoring wells between seven ATES systems in Belgium to evaluate mineral content within the water.

        <p>Regenspurg et al [44] explored the effect of injecting hot and cold water on the chemical and microbial composition of an aquifer with a natural temperature of 17 °C. The impact of hot water injection up to a maximum temperature of 73.5 °C on chemical composition was hardly measurable, yet it was still deemed to be highly likely that carbonate precipitation would occur. Similarly, growth rates in microbial communities were small during the production and injection phases of operation. The tests were however only carried out for relatively short periods, with temperatures within the aquifer returning to normal within 13.5 days and so the effects of long-term temperature increase were unknown.Regenspurg et al [44] explored the effect of injecting hot and cold water on the chemical and microbial composition of an aquifer with a natural temperature of 17 °C.

        <p>Song et al [42] performed an extensive review of recharge and clogging mechanisms within sandstone aquifers as well as the methods employed for prevention and rehabilitation. They also indicate some of the common causes and preventive measures of physical, chemical, and biological clogging, as well as rehabilitation methods used (Table 1). [42] The reaction of the aquifer to the injection of warm water is heavily dependent on the aquifer mineral properties and therefore aquifer qualities should be identified prior to development. This enables preventative measures to be taken, ensuring issues do not arise or impacts minimised and lowering maintenance costs. Reducing clogging also helps to prevent pressure build ups around the injection well, with increasing pressure requiring more work from the pumping system to move the groundwater.Song et al [42] performed an extensive review of recharge and clogging mechanisms within sandstone aquifers as well as the methods employed for prevention and rehabilitation.

        <p>High temperature (HT) ATES is considered as a potential development to enable the use of waste heat from a wider range of sources. While most ATES systems operate in the range of 5 -25 °C, HT-ATES is characterised by an injection temperature of at least 50 °C, making use of heat sources such as CHP plants or incinerators [45]. The heat stored may also be used directly for heating without the need for heat pumps making it suitable for a wider range of heating applications in addition to reducing energy consumption [46]. These systems are unlikely to achieve a long-term energy balance due to the increased operating temperature, and as a result are typically located in deeper aquifers to reduce the environmental impact and likelihood of interfering with sources of drinking water [45]. To facilitate the deeper drilling depths, mono-well systems are generally used to help minimise the initial costs [47].High temperature (HT) ATES is considered as a potential development to enable the use of waste heat from a wider range of sources.

        <p>Although there are benefits, high storage temperatures exacerbate the issues felt in lower temperature systems such as clogging of wells due to mineral precipitation, increased mineral and CO2 solubility, and promoting algae growth [48]. This makes extraction increasingly difficult without preventative measures, increasing the relative cost of storage, and reducing the viability of the system. In addition, losses experienced through density driven flow were found to increase non-linearly with increasing injection temperature [27], with typical recovery efficiency for low temperatures (&lt; 30 °C) between 70 -90% and between 40 -70% for high temperatures (&gt; 60 °C) [49]. Finally, to avoid rock fracturing and the loss of the entire heated water stock, injection and production rates from HT-ATES systems in low-to-medium permeability aquifers must be limited [46]. As a result, either the volume of water that can be injected and extracted is small or the loading and unloading phases must be much longer than for typical ATES systems.Although there are benefits, high storage temperatures exacerbate the issues felt in lower temperature systems such as clogging of wells due to mineral precipitation, increased mineral and CO2 solubility, and promoting algae growth [48].

        <p>Ueckert and Baumann [50] presented the results from a large-scale high-temperature heat storage test. Testing was run through a single well over five injection-production cycles with temperatures from 65 to 110 °C and a flow rate of 15 L/s. The project achieved a lower-than-expected energy recovery of 48%, with the remaining energy 'charging' the aquifer. Model results indicated that a well doublet system would only suffice for a few cycles, and so a well triplet system was suggested. In the triplet system groundwater is reinjected into an intermediary well instead of the cold well following heat extraction where it slowly flows towards the cold well, allowing it to reach equilibrium with the aquifer over time.Ueckert and Baumann [50] presented the results from a large-scale high-temperature heat storage test.

        <p>Feasibility studies have been carried out into the potential of HT-ATES in other areas [51]. By increasing the storage temperature the number of potential waste heat sources is also increased but also reduces storage efficiencies as more heat is lost to the surroundings. Well triplet systems could be used in future cases to recover heat that extends past the influence of the usual extraction well. Increasing the density of similar temperature injection and extraction wells will also benefit overall performance by maintaining areas of consistent temperature throughout the aquifer. By locating a number of high-temperature ATES warm wells near to one another thermal losses could be limited by reducing the thermal gradient away from the storage.Feasibility studies have been carried out into the potential of HT-ATES in other areas [51].

        <p>BTES uses a closed loop ground heat exchange system to store sensible thermal energy below ground in soil or rock. This is made possible by the relatively stable ground temperatures observed below the surface beyond a depth of around 10 metres [52], creating favourable conditions for the storage and subsequent extraction of heat either for direct use or through ground source heat pumps (GSHPs).BTES uses a closed loop ground heat exchange system to store sensible thermal energy below ground in soil or rock.

        <p>The BTES system consists of a heat source, borehole thermal storage, borehole heat exchangers (BHEs) and often a buffering tank due to the slow rate of charge and discharge [53]. The BHE is composed of a borehole, thermal grout, and u-tube arrangement encased within the grout to circulate the heat transfer fluid (HTF) along the vertical length of the borehole. Boreholes are commonly drilled to depths of between 30 -200 m [54], however research has been conducted into boreholes of much greater depths in attempts to reduce the number of boreholes needed to generate a higher storage capacity [55]. To limit this heat loss, insulation is installed below the ground to a depth determined by the soil and insulation properties [53]. The charging temperature of the BTES is dictated by the heat source, with solar thermal collectors commonly used to provide heat at temperatures around 85 -90 °C [56,57]. Alternatively, waste heat from industrial processes and heat and power cogeneration can also be used, with low grade heat becoming more applicable with lower distribution temperatures in district heating schemes. Outlet temperatures during extraction range between approximately 25 -45 °C [58,59,60] with heat pumps used to further raise the temperature of the heat transfer fluid after extraction if necessary.The BTES system consists of a heat source, borehole thermal storage, borehole heat exchangers (BHEs) and often a buffering tank due to the slow rate of charge and discharge [53].

        <p>The storage efficiency of the BTES system is determined by the design and arrangement of the BHEs, material properties, ground properties and operating parameters [61]. Recovery efficiencies typically start very low in the first year of operation, however by the fourth or fifth year can reach between 40 -60 % [62,63], with BTES commonly used to distribute heat throughout district heating schemes [57,64,65]. Design parameters include the length, number, and spacing of the BHEs, and must consider geological conditions such as ground thermal conductivity, and quantity and movement of groundwater.

        <p>Although established through several large and smaller scale projects [66,67], BTES still faces several barriers to further development. These are primarily the high construction costs faced due to borehole drilling, the time taken to reach operational efficiency, and accurately predicting the interaction between numerous BHEs and the ground over several years [67]. Both design parameters (i.e. BHE depth) and operational parameters (i.e. fluid flow velocity) have been proven to have a significant impact on BHE performance [68].Although established through several large and smaller scale projects [66,67], BTES still faces several barriers to further development.

        <p>Borehole fields develop horizontal rather than vertical temperature stratification, with higher temperatures towards the centre, concentrating heat in the centre of the array. This results from heat being predominantly transferred through conduction rather than convection through the borehole arrangement [69]. The cost of drilling typically accounts for about half of the installation costs and hence depth and number of BHEs becomes a significant factor for its deployment [68]. The number of BHEs required for the system is determined according to the geological conditions and desired storage capacity.Borehole fields develop horizontal rather than vertical temperature stratification, with higher temperatures towards the centre, concentrating heat in the centre of the array.

        <p>Sensitivity analysis has shown that borehole spacing is the most effective factor in influencing storage efficiency and temperature density within the array, with an increase in spacing increasing storage efficiency but reducing temperature density [67]. Welsch et al [70] observed the impact of the length, spacing, number, and inlet temperature on the storage performance of medium-deep BHEs. Storage systems consisting of 4, 7, and 19 BHEs at spacings of 2.5, 5, and 10 m were tested. It was found that a higher number of BHEs allowed a higher initial storage efficiency, as well as achieving the largest increase in storage efficiency over the modelled period of 10 years. Increasing borehole spacing from 2.5 to 5 m served to improve storage efficiency and increase specific heat extraction rates, whilst further expanding to 10 m decreased these values.Sensitivity analysis has shown that borehole spacing is the most effective factor in influencing storage efficiency and temperature density within the array, with an increase in spacing increasing storage efficiency but reducing temperature density [67].

        <p>Borehole fields can take up to 5 years to reach their maximum operating efficiency, with much of the injected heat lost throughout the charging season prior to reaching a steady state of operation (Figure 4) [73]. With each year of operation, lateral heat transfer away from the borehole field to the ground reduces as the thermal gradient between borehole temperature and ground temperature decreases [74]. The low thermal efficiency encountered in the initial years of operation encourage improvements to charging methods to help the BTES system reach operating efficiency in a shorter timeframe.Borehole fields can take up to 5 years to reach their maximum operating efficiency, with much of the injected heat lost throughout the charging season prior to reaching a steady state of operation (Figure 4) [73].

        <p>Figure 4 -Example BTES system operating temperature over time [73] Boreholes are connected in series, parallel, or mixed arrangements (Figure 5) [75]. Traditionally, charging occurs by circulating water through boreholes at the centre of the array as a priority and radiates outwards throughout the boreholes to concentrate most of the heat in the centre of the array. Lim et al [76] proposed an alternative method through which the fluid inlet position is moved between boreholes closer or further from the centre throughout charging. Inlet position is determined by the inlet fluid temperature to maintain the radial temperature gradient within the borehole array. By applying the inlet positioning method, the thermal storage efficiency was increased by 7.7%, 18.4%, and 24.4% at the end of the first, second, and third years of operation respectively. The energy sharing ratio was increased by 69.4%, enough to create an increase in the energy storage per unit volume, resulting in a reduction in the size of the BTES.Figure 4 -Example BTES system operating temperature over time [73] Boreholes are connected in series, parallel, or mixed arrangements (Figure 5) [75].

        <p>Zhu et al [78] explored the charging and stopping time frames used for an intermittent charging operation. Following the results, they suggested an operation with intervals of 5 -11.5 h or more than 17.5 h for charging, and a stopping duration of between 11.5 -24 h in between. Conversely, Wei et al [79] reported that a concentrated charging strategy led to a more efficient system performance when compared with intermittent charging. Under intermittent charging it was found that heat losses were higher over the whole charging season as the heat did not have time to accumulate, whereas with a concentrated approach heat loss only occurred as charging began which was comparatively later in the season. Han and Yu [68] showed that for a particular BHE, intermittent extraction was preferable to continuous. Continuous extraction can remove greater quantities of heat from the ground but at the cost of lower extraction efficiency, where extraction efficiency is defined as the extracted energy divided by the operational period. In contrast, intermittent mode allows the ground temperature to recover between periods of extraction, improving efficiency and increasing the COP of the heat pump.Zhu et al [78] explored the charging and stopping time frames used for an intermittent charging operation.

        <p>The performance of a BHE is dependent upon the thermal resistance of the borehole as well as the thermal properties of the ground. Total borehole resistance was defined by Beier and Ewbank [80] as the resistance between the circulating fluid in the BHE and the undisturbed ground temperature. Zero borehole resistance infers instantaneous heat transfer from the HTF to the ground and vice versa [81]. With increasing thermal conductivity of the soil, thermal resistance decreases, resulting in an overall decrease of the borehole resistance.The performance of a BHE is dependent upon the thermal resistance of the borehole as well as the thermal properties of the ground.

        <p>Initially, plain sand or cement grouts were used to backfill boreholes but more recently grout is usually made of bentonite, quartz with sand, or water. Bentonite has a typical thermal conductivity of 0.8 -1.0 W/m-K, thermally enhanced grout with quartz 1.0 -1.5 W/m-K, water saturated quartz sand 1.5 -2.0 W/m-K and stagnate water 0.6 W/m-K [82]. High-density-polyethylene (HDPE) is the pipe material of choice due to its low cost, corrosion resistance, and easy handling [83]. Badenes et al [83] demonstrated that the optimal pipe and grouting combination is not always the combination with the highest thermal conductivity, but that materials should be determined in accordance with local ground conditions. Through this method a 22% reduction in the required length of the BHE could be achieved in the modelled conditions. Kurevija et al [84] compared savings in electricity with investment cost, also concluding that there is no real benefit from implementing enhanced grouts in ground with low to average thermal conductivity. In addition to material changes, methods such as introducing internal fins within the u-tube have been explored to encourage turbulent mixing [85]. Zhang et al [86] achieved a 15.63% saving on initial investment by considering the positioning of the u-tube within the borehole as next to the wall rather than centred as is more likely to be seen in real systems, with the savings achieved by reducing the required length of the BHE.Initially, plain sand or cement grouts were used to backfill boreholes but more recently grout is usually made of bentonite, quartz with sand, or water.

        <p>In further efforts to reduce costs the use of increasingly deeper boreholes is being explored. Deeper boreholes have less impact on shallow aquifers, require fewer boreholes, and are predicted to achieve efficiencies of up to 83% through early studies [56]. At greater depths ground permeability tends to decrease, limiting the transfer of heat away from the storage volume by groundwater flow. The thermal gradient between the storage area and surrounding rock is also reduced, enabling higher extraction temperatures as stored heat does not dissipate away from the BHE [87]. Co-axial borehole arrangements are used for deep borehole systems (Figure 6) to reduce pressure losses for the circulating fluid whilst allowing for larger mass flow rates and improved thermal extraction. The inner piper is also insulated to prevent thermal interaction between the down and up flow [88].In further efforts to reduce costs the use of increasingly deeper boreholes is being explored.

        <p>Medium-deep boreholes exist up to depths of 2 -3 km, allowing for much fewer boreholes to provide the same storage capacity, enable much higher storage temperatures without impacting shallow aquifers, and benefit increasingly from geothermal heat [59]. The boreholes in question delivered a heat transfer rate of 61 -144 W/m, a large increase when compared with the 40 W/m generally achieved through standard depth boreholes. Consequently, the heat extraction through one deep BHE can be equivalent to between 30 -70 standard depth BHEs, with the average outlet temperature over 5 test sites reaching 33 °C.Medium-deep boreholes exist up to depths of 2 -3 km, allowing for much fewer boreholes to provide the same storage capacity, enable much higher storage temperatures without impacting shallow aquifers, and benefit increasingly from geothermal heat [59].

        <p>Although often employed as buffer storage, TTES is also used seasonally. The storage tank is made of reinforced concrete, steel, or fiber-reinforced plastics [20], using water as a storage material with internal liners to create a watertight layer. As the tank is purpose-built the storage can be located anywhere, independent of the local geological conditions that dictate the suitability of borehole and aquifer systems. The tank is either fully or partially buried in the ground to insulate against the ambient temperature, reducing the level of thermal insulation required [89].Although often employed as buffer storage, TTES is also used seasonally.

        <p>PTES uses excavated ground to create a sunken storage area. The excavated soil can be used to raise the banks at the sides of storage, increasing the overall volume of the storage. The lid is either supported by the sidewalls of the pit or floats on the surface and is often the most expensive part of the PTES construction [90]. PTES generally uses water as a storage material, but also sometimes employ a mixture of water and gravel. Due to the water-gravel mix having a lower thermal capacity than the just water case, the volume of the basin needs to be approximately 50% higher in this case [91] but is often applied to avoid the costs of disposing of the excavated ground material. The cost of building PTES is around a quarter of that to build TTES [92]. Insulation is commonly used along the top and sides of the storage, with the thickness determined by the storage temperate and local ambient and geological conditions.PTES uses excavated ground to create a sunken storage area.

        <p>Despite use differing geometries TTES and PTES operate under the same principles. Heat is charged and discharged into and out of the water within the container either by directly pumping water into the store, or through a heat exchanger with another thermal system. Hot and cold regions naturally develop within the storage due to the differences in density between the hot and cold water. This enables hot water to be extracted from the top of the tank and cold water to then be re-injected to the storage at the bottom of the tank without overly disturbing either region. It is desirable to maintain these thermal regions with as little mixing as possible to prevent heat losses throughout the storage.Despite use differing geometries TTES and PTES operate under the same principles.

        <p>Tanks and pits are designed to store water up to temperatures of around 90 -95 °C [57]. Inlet temperatures are dependent on the heat sources used in conjunction with the thermal storage as well as the use or non-use of heat pumps. Solar collectors, bio-mass boilers, and industrial waste heat are often employed as heat sources, generating charging temperatures between 70 -95 °C [64,93,94,95]. As a result of the high storage temperatures, the stored heat is commonly utilised through district heating schemes [57,64,94]. Storage efficiencies between approximately 45 -65% are common [93,96,97,98], with instances of up to 90% achieved [64].Tanks and pits are designed to store water up to temperatures of around 90 -95 °C [57].

        <p>Stratification occurs as water is separated into regions of consistent temperature due to the density variations caused by temperature differences. Thermal stratification is enhanced by increasing temperature difference between the top and bottom of the tank, lower inlet velocities and higher aspect ratios [99]. Weather conditions, inlet and outlet flow arrangements, geometry parameters, and levels of thermal insulation all impact the thermal stratification of the storage [97]. A thermocline region is formed between the hot water at the top of the tank and the cold water at the bottom. This thermocline region acts as a buffer between the hot and cold regions, preventing mixing (Figure 7). In general, the thermocline layer should be as thin as possible as this allows for a greater volume of hot water within the storage tank indicating reduced mixing [100].Stratification occurs as water is separated into regions of consistent temperature due to the density variations caused by temperature differences.

        <p>The quality of the thermal stratification is largely determined by the inlet device and the flow properties that are derived from it.

        <p>Moncho-Esteve et al [102] simulated several elbow geometries and a diffuser as the inlet (Figure 8), supplementing earlier experimental work [103]. They concluded that the degree of stratification was predominantly determined by inlet direction and inlet velocity profile, both products of the inlet design. When evaluating the preservation of stratification and the thermocline region, results showed that the conical diffuser performed better with a flow rate of 16 L/min when compared with the designed elbows at a flow rate of 6 L/min. The best thermal efficiency during charging was achieved by using the upwards facing elbow (Figure 8, d) or diffuser design (Figure 8, b), with minimal difference measured between them. Wilk et al [104] used thermal coils within the tank to introduce and extract heat from the water. A hot water coil at the top, cold water coil at the bottom, and an extra coil utilizing waste heat from a refrigeration cycle within a stratification device to reduce mixing were monitored. The individual operation of the upper coil served to develop stratification but also increased the thickness of thermocline with time. This resulted in excessive buoyancy and convective mixing, effectively destroying the stratification.Moncho-Esteve et al [102] simulated several elbow geometries and a diffuser as the inlet (Figure 8), supplementing earlier experimental work [103].

        <p>Al-Habaibeh [105,106] propose a novel 'water snake' to maintain stratification within the storage. The water snake moves vertically within the storage according to the buoyancy of the water being injected, ensuring that the water entering is within a layer of water with the same density. Although initial testing of the water snake proved that it was an effective method of reducing mixing, all the testing times are over short periods with further testing needed to indicate performance over longer periods with a wider range of tank and inlet temperatures.Al-Habaibeh [105,106] propose a novel 'water snake' to maintain stratification within the storage.

        <p>As it stands, diffusers offer high inlet rates with low levels of mixing within the water storage. By reducing inlet flow rates, stratification can be better preserved however to do so may require the use of an intermediary storage vessel that would incur losses of its own. Immersion coils are beneficial in that they do not directly deposit water into the storage and so there is no overt disturbance of the thermocline but are restricted to heat transfer by conduction through the walls of the coil.As it stands, diffusers offer high inlet rates with low levels of mixing within the water storage.

        <p>As man-made freestanding structures, cylindrical tanks are generally used, partially or fully buried to reduce thermal losses whilst also being a more efficient use of space [107]. In a study investigating the impact of geometrical parameters on storage efficiency and stratification [108], it was found beneficial to increase the height-to-diameter ratio of the storage. A height to diameter ratio of 2 results in a smaller contact surface between the hot and cold-water limiting mixing and reduced the thickness of the thermocline from 40% to 16% of the total tank height.As man-made freestanding structures, cylindrical tanks are generally used, partially or fully buried to reduce thermal losses whilst also being a more efficient use of space [107].

        <p>Pits are dug with the angle between the side wall and the horizontal limited to between 30 -40 degrees to avoid the collapse of the sidewall's inwards [109]. Heat loss through the walls creates a downward flow of cooler water towards the base of the pit. Hotter water at the center of the tank rises, creating the stratification. Chang et al [110] investigated the impact of pit wall angle and depth on thermal performance. They found that reduced pit depth results in reduced thermal efficiency, with deeper pits achieving clearer thermal stratification. Steep slope angles of the sidewalls were found to lead to more significant temperature stratification.Pits are dug with the angle between the side wall and the horizontal limited to between 30 -40 degrees to avoid the collapse of the sidewall's inwards [109].

        <p>To create a watertight storage, polymer or metal liners are installed. Polymers such as Polypropylene and polyethylene are popular due to their low cost and ease of use, however sometimes face issues with temperature resistance [111]. The permeability of polymer liners is heavily temperature dependent [112], and if moisture does occur within the insulation layer it can lead to long term degradation [113]. Double liners can be used to ensure the water tightness of the storage, given that the internal layer in contact with the water may be subject to degradation through heating over time.To create a watertight storage, polymer or metal liners are installed.

        <p>In comparison metal liners are more expensive but offer improved heat resistance. Ochs et al [113] compared capital costs of stainless steel and polymer liners for tanks and shallow pits alongside trafficable and nontrafficable covers. For large storage volumes of 2,000,000 m 3 , the difference in cost between the two was relatively low, whereas for small volumes of 100,000 m 3 the difference is much more significant. The cover of the shallow pit is a major contributor to the overall cost; however, the significance decreases with increasing storage volume. When only considering the liner, polymers are more economically feasible than steel, even if required to be replaced over the respectively shorter lifetime.In comparison metal liners are more expensive but offer improved heat resistance.

        <p>As the structure is the most expensive part of the storage, choosing the correct materials drastically impacts the overall cost and longevity of the system. Although tanks are the most expensive form of seasonal thermal storage [114], their cost is countered by the fact that they are independent of local conditions and therefore can be installed anywhere.As the structure is the most expensive part of the storage, choosing the correct materials drastically impacts the overall cost and longevity of the system.

        <p>Bai et al [96] developed a simplified model of an underground water pit buried 1 m underground featuring 0.3 m thick concrete walls and a 0.2 m thick polystyrene layer on top of the lid. This model was then used to evaluate heat loss coefficients along the top, sides, and bottom of the storage. For a maximum temperature difference between the top and bottom of the pit of 31.3 °C the average heat loss coefficients were found to be 0.172 W/m 2 , 0.702 W/m 2 , and 0.366 W/m 2 along the top, side wall, and bottom respectively. The low heat loss coefficient along the top was attributed to the use of the polystyrene layer. The higher temperatures measured closer to the top of the pit as well as the thermal stratification contribute to a higher heat loss coefficient along the sides than the bottom.Bai et al [96] developed a simplified model of an underground water pit buried 1 m underground featuring 0.3 m thick concrete walls and a 0.2 m thick polystyrene layer on top of the lid.

        <p>While heat transfer from the tank to the soil is intentionally suppressed for small storage tanks this can lead to the tank reaching capacity prematurely, resulting in the discarding of waste heat that could otherwise be stored. Huang et al [115] proposed reducing the level of insulation around the tank to allow heat to be transferred to the ground. Five levels of insulation were proposed as shown in Figure 9. They argue that by reducing the level of insulation the capacity of the storage is effectively increased by using the surrounding soil as further thermal storage. Heat lost through the tank walls but within a range of 3 -4 m of the wall was recoverable once the temperature of the tank fell below the temperature of the ground. As a result, for a temperature difference of 80 °C within the tank the cross-seasonal heat storage capacity was increased by 9.85% when reducing the insulation from full to partly covered. This only remains beneficial for tanks with small storage volumes that are likely to reach max storage capacity prior to the end of the charging season. The use of insulation must be taken from an engineering as well as economical point of view, as in some cases it may be beneficial to allow marginally higher thermal losses to save on the initial investment.While heat transfer from the tank to the soil is intentionally suppressed for small storage tanks this can lead to the tank reaching capacity prematurely, resulting in the discarding of waste heat that could otherwise be stored.

        <p>Stevenson and Hyde [125] defined several end processes, heat sinks, and their temperature levels. Processes are separated into drying, space heating, high and low temperature, with the lowest target temperatures at 90 °C for water pre-heating in hot water boilers and space heating, and 100 °C for water pre-heating for steam boilers. This shows that although industry produces significant quantities of waste heat, when STES is concerned there may be limited uses for it within industrial processes. This is because the storage and delivery temperatures from any STES system would be below much of the useful temperature range, even with the use of heat pumps, and therefore additional demands such as district heating schemes or ventilation heating must be considered. It can be more difficult to match supply with demand in these cases due to industry often being separated from communities, with the transportation of heat incurring significant losses.Stevenson and Hyde [125] defined several end processes, heat sinks, and their temperature levels.

Heat is stored at between 40 -45 °C, with the highest efficiency achieved to date at 19% in its sixth year of operation. Below expected levels of extraction is owed to lower than anticipated quantity and quality of excess heat, hindering the storage from reaching the required temperatures for extraction. Despite this, the amount of bought district heating was reduced by approximately 4 GWH/year. This experience highlights the importance of proper quantification of waste heat and subsequent system design. By using heat pumps heat can be extracted at lower temperatures with minimal energy demand therefore making the stored heat more viable.A HT-BTES at Emmaboda, Sweden [130], stores waste heat from a foundry in an array of 140, 150 m deep boreholes.

        <p>When considering the use of STES in conjunction with industrial waste heat the following must first be considered: supply rate, quantity, and temperature of the waste heat, location of supply and demand relative to one another, heat recovery technology, the mass flow rate of both the supply and the sink, and any geographical limitations that may prevent the installation of any STES technology. As storage temperatures for BTES are typically between 40 -90 °C, and 70 -95 °C for tank/pit TES they are more suited to receiving higher temperate waste heat from industry. Tank and pit TES are beneficial in that they can be installed anywhere, however the size of the tank can be a limiting factor. In contrast, storage temperatures for ATES are between 13 -25 °C, more suitable for processes such as air-cooled data centres that produce waste heat between 25 -35 °C [123]. The advent of mid-deep BTES will also improve the ability of the STES to meet the demands of high temperature processes.When considering the use of STES in conjunction with industrial waste heat the following must first be considered: supply rate, quantity, and temperature of the waste heat, location of supply and demand relative to one another, heat recovery technology, the mass flow rate of both the supply and the sink, and any geographical limitations that may prevent the installation of any STES technology.

Issues with long times to reach operational efficiency and low storage efficiencies are being addressed through material improvements, charging operations, and borehole spacing to create a more stable temperature distribution throughout the borehole field.</p>
        <p>The geometry of tanks and pits has been shown to affect the thermal performance of the storage. By considering the angle of the walls and the height to diameter ratio, losses through the side walls can be reduced. Tanks are limited in the size to which they can be built, and therefore the storage size although large is restricted. In comparison pits can be dug to almost any size, with the lid the only limiting factor. Further improvements to inlet and extraction devices to maintain stratification would help improve storage efficiencies and in turn help to lower costs by reducing material demands.The geometry of tanks and pits has been shown to affect the thermal performance of the storage.

        <p>Although solar thermal collectors are widely used to provide heat for STES they are not as effective in many climates, and therefore waste heat is often used as an alternate or supplementary source. Bio-mass boilers and CHP units are also employed, with STES enabling the operation of electricity production independently of heating demand for CHP.Although solar thermal collectors are widely used to provide heat for STES they are not as effective in many climates, and therefore waste heat is often used as an alternate or supplementary source.

        <p>The development of CFD and other methods of computational modelling has made predicting system performance somewhat easier and is helping to envisage systems in a variety of scenarios. There are still however physical engineering issues within each storage type that when addressed result in improved storage efficiencies, higher outlet temperatures, and lower costs.The development of CFD and other methods of computational modelling has made predicting system performance somewhat easier and is helping to envisage systems in a variety of scenarios.

        <p>This paper discusses four STES technologies, including operating parameters, barriers to development, and research areas devoted to improving them. By evaluating current uses and performances of existing STES systems decision making in future systems can be improved. For uses of STES, district heating schemes as well as large scale heating and cooling loads have been most studied although as the technologies improve so will their suitability for use within a wider range of systems.This paper discusses four STES technologies, including operating parameters, barriers to development, and research areas devoted to improving them.

        <p>With the advent of 4 th and 5 th generation district heat schemes, STES is becoming more relevant as an effective means of meeting thermal energy demand. Borehole, tank, and pit TES are all used throughout the current generation of district heating schemes, with ATES more commonly used to meet heating and cooling in large public and commercial spaces. As systems move to 5 th generation district heating and distribution temperatures are reduced the number of viable sources of waste heat for direct distribution will increase.With the advent of 4 th and 5 th generation district heat schemes, STES is becoming more relevant as an effective means of meeting thermal energy demand.

        <p>Whether the technologies are adopted will come down to cost, and so reaching a point where it is cheaper to store and re-deliver waste heat rather than creating new heat is a long-term goal. The introduction of latent and thermochemical heat storage will inevitably change the landscape of STES, but for now it remains clear that the methods of storage evaluated here represent the best possible opportunities for using and storing large quantities of waste heat over several months to provide a better outlook for current energy systems.Whether the technologies are adopted will come down to cost, and so reaching a point where it is cheaper to store and re-deliver waste heat rather than creating new heat is a long-term goal.
