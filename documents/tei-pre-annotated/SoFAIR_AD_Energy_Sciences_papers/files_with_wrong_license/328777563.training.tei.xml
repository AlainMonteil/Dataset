        <p>Non-coordinated optimization of energy systems at local and regional levels does not verify the whole optimal operation of systems since the systems operate without considering their interactions with each other. One of the most famous sources of flexibility is ESSs. Hence, this paper presents a stochastic decentralized approach to evaluate the impact of ESSs on regional-local MES market-clearing within a bi-level framework. On the regional level, the economic interaction between the electricity and NG systems is carried out by a centralized system operator (CSO). In addition, coordination between various energy carriers is implemented by the energy hub operator at the local level. To ameliorate the flexibility of the natural gas (NG) system in the regional MES, the linepack model of gas pipelines has been considered.Non-coordinated optimization of energy systems at local and regional levels does not verify the whole optimal operation of systems since the systems operate without considering their interactions with each other.

        <p>A multi-energy system (MES) is a relatively new development that has attracted more attention from researchers in recent years due to an increase in renewable energy sources (RESs) all over the world. In a MES, several energy carriers such as electricity, gas, heat, and cooling are considered together. This energy diversification enhances system reliability, flexibility, and stability. In addition, the benefits of integrating different energies create new challenges to system performance. With the development of multi-energy carriers, participants in the energy markets are increasing. Now the question that comes up here is "do traditional markets respond to this volume of different energies? "Traditionally, various energy sources are managed by different independent operators. However, recent studies have focused on operator coordination methods [1]. Some energy types such as electricity and natural gas (NG) can be transported over long distances (a few hundred kilometers).A multi-energy system (MES) is a relatively new development that has attracted more attention from researchers in recent years due to an increase in renewable energy sources (RESs) all over the world.

        <p>Therefore, MES includes region level (transmission) and local level (distribution) systems. At the regional MES, gas-fired power plants (GFPPs) are responsible for the coordination of the NG network and electricity grid. Producing electricity by GFPPs with high-efficiency, fast start-up and high-ramping can be one of the best options to counter with the inherent uncertainty of RESs. In addition to the technical benefits, the GFPPs does not produce any NOx gas, and its SO2 emissions are substantially lower than the coal and oil power plants [2]. World-wide, the demand for gas to generate electricity usually reaches above 40% of total gas fuel consumption, which is expected to increase in the coming years [3]. This fact indicates the creation of a deep connection between power systems and NG systems. With this growing trend of power generation with GFPPs, significant challenges for the performance of the two systems have been created. One of the challenging problems is how to coordinate the electricity and NG markets. From the perspective of the electricity market operator, the generation of electricity by GFPPs has led to that the gas market prices directly affecting the unit commitment (UC) [4].Therefore, MES includes region level (transmission) and local level (distribution) systems.

        <p>The local MES operation method focuses on energy conversion and storage and distribution methods instead of network optimization at distribution levels. However, it is difficult to build energy distribution and conversion across all of the equipment due to a great number of energy conversion equipment, as well as energy storage resources in local MES. As such, the energy hub is presented to model the interface between energy distribution and conversion in a local MES, based on coupling matrices [1,22].

        <p>Generally, based on the proposed framework, energy producers (NGFPP, renewable energy sources, and NG producers) offer price-quantity for supplying energy to the CSO operator. Also, active and inactive consumers bid the CSO the required energy demand. Then, the CSO clears the wholesale market using standard marketclearing tools to maximize social welfare and obtain the LMP for power system busses and NG network nodes. In the proposed approach, the interaction between CSO and EHO has been considered, where the EHO behaves as a large-scale consumer in the wholesale market. The EHO clears the market based on the forecasted prices and then participates in the wholesale market to supply the rest of the demand. After clearing the integrated wholesale market (coordinated power and gas markets), local marginal prices will be determined and sent to the EHO. Now, the EHO updates its demand based on the received LMP by optimal scheduling of energy hub resources. So, the EHO can change the LMP values in the wholesale market by changing the load consumption pattern. The main reason for this practice is the dependence between energy consumption and price. In addition, we provide a two-step iterative framework for solving the bi-level problem. In the upper level, optimal stochastic scheduling for the EHO under an energy hub framework is solved with the aim of minimizing the cost of operation. In the lower level, the electricity and NG markets are cleared under a coordinated framework, taking into account wind power and linepack technology.

Also, the local level operating cost is $166454.12 According to Figure 9, due to the low and uniform energy demand in the early hours (i.e. from 1 to 8 o'clock), the dispatch of the cheap G1 generation unit is low, so at these hours the market clearing price is 19.23 $/MWh.

Given that between hours 12 and 20, which is the peak hour load of the gas network and power grid, the NG system will restrict the gas dispatch to the GFPPs during these hours due to the prioritization of residential NG network loads over other NG network loads. As a result, the dispatch of the expensive unit G2 increased and the market clearing price changed to 30.01 $/MWh.Case 1: In this case, the market clearing of the regional-local MES regardless of the local EES and their uncertainties is considered.

Given that between hours 12 and 20, which is the peak hour load of the gas network and power grid, the NG system will restrict the gas dispatch to the GFPPs during these hours due to the prioritization of residential NG network loads over other NG network loads. As a result, the dispatch of the expensive unit G2 increased and the market clearing price changed to 30.01 $/MWh.</p>
        <p>From 20:00 onwards, electricity and NG consumption will be reduced. Similarly, as energy demand declines, the dispatch of the G2 unit decreases, and therefore the market clearing price decreases to 24.56 $/ MWh. Finally, from 23:00 onwards, with the reduction in the dispatch of cheap G1 and G2 units, the market clearing price will be reduced to 19.27 $/MWh. It is worth noting that these results have been obtained by considering the capacity constraints of the transmission lines. Unless the capacity constraints are taken into account, the market clearing price will be the same across all power system buses. Given that expensive NG suppliers are online at all times, it is obvious that the market clearing price of the NG is regulated by expensive suppliers (i.e. 2.9 $/Kcf).From 20:00 onwards, electricity and NG consumption will be reduced.

        <p>Figure 10 shows the EHO scheduling to supply electrical loads in Case 1. From an economic point of view, due to the low price of NG, the entire electricity demand should be supplied by the CHP. Supplying the local-level loads by CHP has more priority than purchasing electricity from the grid, but ignoring both technical view and security constraints cause irreparable damage at both levels. Therefore, scheduling to meet the demands of different local level loads must be both economically and technically guaranteed. According to Figure 10, it can be seen that the local level electricity load supplied by the power grid and the CHP unit are 68.31% and 31.68%, respectively. As can be seen from Figure 10, the CHP generation capacity is reduced during on-peak times of the NG network. To evaluate the effect of linepack on the flexibility of NG network, the residential load of the NG network is increased by 15%. Since t=17 is experiencing a sudden increase in residential load on the NG network, this situation could be a critical area for power grid generating units. As a result, the linepack system is expected to provide flexibility for the integrated system in this condition and prevent increasing the power and gas prices. Figure 12 shows the impact of linepack flexibility on the G1 generating unit after a 15% increase in residential NG network loads. With the linepack system, the unit G1 can deliver 17.12% more power at peak hours. In other words, the existence of a linepack system prevents excessive reductions in the power output of the G1 at critical times. Figure 13 shows the impact of linepack flexibility on the G2 generating unit after a 15% increase in residential NG network loads. As can be seen from Figure 13, the unit G2 can provide 5% more power at the peak hour load of the NG network. In addition, it prevents expensive units from increasing in other hours. Additionally, as can be seen in Table 1, the existence of the linepack system in addition to increasing the flexibility of the regional level system reduces the operating costs of both local and regional levels. Case 2: In this case, a review of the market clearing of regional-local MES has been provided considering ESS without their uncertainties for the local-level.

        <p>In the upper-level problem, the objective of the EHO was to minimize the cost of purchasing electricity and NG using ESSs considering wind power generation. In the lower level problem, the CSO-managed integrated electricity and NG markets were implemented to minimize the cost of generating units and NG producers. To solve this bi-level problem, a two-step iterative algorithm was proposed to minimize the costs of both levels of the problem. In addition, a scenario-based stochastic approach was applied to handle the uncertainties of different local loads. Additionally, a NG system model equipped with line pack technology was considered to increase flexibility and reduce the cost of operating the regional level system. The results showed that in the presence of the multi-carrier energy storage, the daily operation cost at the local and regional levels was decreased by 7.01% and 1.7%, respectively.In the upper-level problem, the objective of the EHO was to minimize the cost of purchasing electricity and NG using ESSs considering wind power generation.
