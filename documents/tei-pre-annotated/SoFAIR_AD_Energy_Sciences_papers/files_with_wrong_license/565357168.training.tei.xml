        <p>Thermal plants and petrochemical applications have been using traditional heat exchangers by operating single-phase fluids such as water, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and engine oil as heat transfer fluids [1]. Low thermal conductivity single-phase fluids used in the conventional heat exchangers generate low efficiency. The efficiency can be enhanced by utilizing fluids with high thermal conductivity, such as nanofluids [2,3]. Nanofluids are defined as the suspension of nanometer-sized particles in the base fluid and are reported to have higher thermal conductivity as compared to single-phase fluids [4,5]. The thermal conductivity of the fluid has a direct impact on the heat transfer coefficient [6], so when the thermal conductivity increases, there is an enhancement in the heat transfer coefficient [7][8][9]. The thermal conductivity of nanofluids depends on the thermal conductivity of particle [10] and base fluid [11], with a fixed amount of heat supply, but the thermal conductivity of the particle has more impact on the enhancement of thermal conductivity [12,13]. Several nanoparticles such as Al 2 O 3 , Cu, CuO, carbonbased, Co 3 O 4 , Fe 3 O 4 , Fe 2 O 3 , SiO 2 , TiO 2 , etc. [14][15][16] are available and reliable. Several factors [17], such as long-term stability [18,19], thermal conductivity [20], viscosity [21], specific heat, and density [22], affect the heat transfer performance of nanofluids [8,23,24], as well as the structure of heat exchanger and the flow conditions.Thermal plants and petrochemical applications have been using traditional heat exchangers by operating single-phase fluids such as water, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and engine oil as heat transfer fluids [1].

        <p>Carbon-based nanoparticles such as carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide, and nanodiamond are reported to have promising high thermal conductivity [24][25][26]. Graphene (G) has attracted considerable attention due to the higher thermal conductivity of 5000 W/m.K, excellent electrical, mechanical, Young's modulus, and optical characteristics [27]. Graphene has a 2D sheet-like structure similar to graphene oxide, but a significant difference is that graphene oxide has highly decorated carbon atoms.Carbon-based nanoparticles such as carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide, and nanodiamond are reported to have promising high thermal conductivity [24][25][26].

        <p>Hybrid nanofluids like graphene oxide-based cobalt oxide (Co 3 O 4 ) nanocomposite can be promising with enhanced thermal conductivity and magnetic property [31].

        <p>Furthermore, they can be used as heat transfer fluids [35]. Sajid and Ali [36] carefully reviewed the parameters which affected the hybrid nanofluids' performance and observed that the most critical factor which affects thermal conductivity is the concentration of nanoparticles. Thermal conductivity enhancement for effective nanofluids is mostly accredited to higher surface area and high convection heat transfer within fluids, in addition to high Brownian motion. Toghraie et al. [37] investigated the effect of thermophysical properties of ZnO-TiO 2 /EG hybrid nanofluids with respect to temperature (25-50 °C) and volume concentration (0-3.5 wt.%). Enhancement in thermal conductivity was observed by increasing either temperatures or volume concentration or both. Harandi et al. [38] observed a 30% enhancement in thermal conductivity of functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (FMWCNTs)-Fe 3 O 4 /EG hybrid nanofluids at 2.3 wt.% concentration and 50°C. It was also observed that the temperature affecting thermal conductivity ratio was more noticeable with increased volume concentration. Afrand [39] examined the thermal conductivity of ethylene-glycol by adding nanoparticles of F-MWCNTs and magnesium oxide (MgO), and by changing temperature, and volume concentration range from 25 to 50°C and 0 to 0.6% respectively. They observed an improvement of 21.3% in thermal conductivity at 25°C and 0.6 wt.% volume concentration. Nine et al. [40] produced Al 2 O 3 -MWCNTs hybrid nanofluids to investigate thermal conductivity with volume concentration ranges from 1-6 wt.%. It was observed that spherically shaped nanoparticles had fewer enhancements in thermal conductivity as compared to cylindrically shaped nanoparticles in hybrid nanofluids. Esfahani et al. [41] investigated the effect of thermal conductivity of ZnO-Ag (50%-50%)/H 2 O nanofluids. Enhancement in thermal conductivity was noted as the Brownian motion became substantial by increasing volume concentration at high temperatures. Several other analyses on the effect of thermal conductivity on hybrid nanofluids are described further [8,16,30]. [42] examined the impact of volume concentration and temperature on the viscosity of MgO-MWCNT EG-based hybrid nanofluids. They observed a Newtonian behavior. They also observed that the dynamic viscosity displayed a declining trend with increasing temperature and volume concentration. Alirezaie et al. [43] investigated the effect of dynamic viscosity on COOH-FMWCNT's/MgO-engine oil hybrid nanofluids, and they observed a reduction with temperature. They also observed non-Newtonian behavior at a low temperature, which develops into Newtonian at high temperature. Zareie and Akbari [44] investigated the MgO-MWCNTs/H 2 O-EG hybrid nanofluid to analyze the viscosity by varying temperatures from 25 to 50°C, and volume concentration ranges from 0.025 to 0.8 vol%. They reported enhancement in viscosity with an increase in particle loadings and an increase in temperature. Studies on the specific heat of hybrid nanofluids are reported in the literature: most of the studies showed a decreasing trend in the nanofluids with a rise in particle loadings and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f temperature [45][46][47]. For the reports presented on the density of hybrid nanofluids [48][49][50], the results showed an increase in density by increasing particle loadings and a decline in density by increasing the temperature. Adriana et al. [46] used a numerical approach to evaluate the thermal conductivity, viscosity and heat transfer characteristics of Al 2 O 3 , TiO 2 , and SiO 2 hybrid nanofluids and they found thermal conductivity enhancement of 12% in addition to developing a new Nusselt number correlation. Bellos and Tzivanidis [47] prepared Al 2 O 3 and TiO 2 /Syltherm 800 hybrid nanofluids and estimated thermal efficiency by using hybrid nanofluids flow in parabolic trough collectors. They found a thermal efficiency enhancement of 1.8% and a Nusselt number enhancement of 178% using hybrid nanofluid.Furthermore, they can be used as heat transfer fluids [35].

        <p>The present research was carried out to understand the thermophysical characteristics of graphene-based cobalt oxide (Co 3 O 4 ) hybrid nanofluids, which were synthesized in the laboratory, and water-based hybrid nanofluids that were produced and optimized using the ANFIS approach. The insitu/chemical reduction technique was used to synthesize the rGO/Co 3 O 4 nanocomposite and then characterized with x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope, and magnetometry. Experimental thermophysical properties such as thermal conductivity, viscosity, density, and specific heat were obtained at temperature values of 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 ℃ and with particle loadings of 0.05%, 0.1%, and 0.2% wt.%. One of the main objectives of the current research work is to create a fuzzy model based on an experimental dataset for later use with optimization purposes to obtain the best operating conditions. A fuzzy system is one of the artificial intelligent (AI) tools that can accurately and efficiently model complex systems. The accuracy of using fuzzy logic technique in systems modelling is dependent upon its two main features. The first one is the nonlinear mapping between the inputs to the output of the fuzzy system through its rule-based list, and the second is the ability to learn through a training algorithm to update the fuzzy system's parameters. Based on the fuzzy model, the optimal control parameters can be determined. In this study, the objective is to determine the optimal (controlling) set of parameters that minimizes the density and viscosity but maximizes the thermal conductivity and the specific heat which represent the four controlled parameters. The controlling variables are temperature and percentage of nanofluid mixture. The experiments involve 20 input-output data samples that relate the controlled variables (outputs) to the controlling variables (inputs). The proposed strategy starts by building a robust model, and then applying the marine predators' algorithm (MPA) to determine the best set of input values that accomplish the goal of this study.The present research was carried out to understand the thermophysical characteristics of graphene-based cobalt oxide (Co 3 O 4 ) hybrid nanofluids, which were synthesized in the laboratory, and water-based hybrid nanofluids that were produced and optimized using the ANFIS approach.

        <p>The fuzzy outputs of whole fired rules are aggregated to obtain one fuzzy output. Through the third component, the final fuzzy output is defuzzified to come up with the final crisp value of the output. In Mamdani-type form, the Centre of Gravity (COG) is the most suitable defuzzifier; however, the Weighted Average (Wavg) is more prevalent in the Sugeno-type. In the mid-nineties of the last century, Jang developed a fuzzy inference system (FIS) by means of an artificial neural network (ANN), namely the Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). Consequently, the conjunction between the two strategies re-enforced the resulting system with the ability to model a complex system with high nonlinearity as well as to be trained in the same procedure as the one used in ANN.The fuzzy outputs of whole fired rules are aggregated to obtain one fuzzy output.

        <p>The marine predators algorithm (MPA) is a very new optimizer that was proposed by Faramarzi et al. in March 2020. The main MPA inspiration is the widespread search for food strategy, which is the movement of Levy and Brownie among surrounding predators together with an optimum encounter of modified policy in the biological interface between the predator and the prey. More details about core idea and mathematical representation can be found in [53]. In MPA, the prey, as well as the predator, is viewed as search representative, since the predator is searching for the prey; meanwhile, the prey itself looking for its food. The velocity ratio among the predator and the prey is the key factor in transferring the process from one stage to another. In MPA, the large-velocity ratio is a notable feature in the first phase, whereas unity and low ratio are the visible markers for the second and third stages.The marine predators algorithm (MPA) is a very new optimizer that was proposed by Faramarzi et al. in March 2020.

        <p>The modification in the pH value of the hybrid nanofluids provides effective outcomes to enhance the thermal conductivity. Optimum pH value signifies enhanced dispersion of nanoparticles in the base fluid due to the improved electrostatic repulsive forces that reduce clusters and improve performance. The nanoparticle size has a significant impact on the thermal conductivity of nanofluids. Most literature has reported the effect of nanoparticle size on thermal conductivity enhancement. It was observed that smaller nanoparticles provided high thermal conductivity as compared to large-sized nanoparticles. The effect of sonication might also play a significant role in the enhancement of thermal conductivity. All these parameters should be taken into account to enhance the thermal conductivity of hybrid nanofluids [60].The modification in the pH value of the hybrid nanofluids provides effective outcomes to enhance the thermal conductivity.

        <p>It was observed by increasing particle loading wt.% that the viscosity improved, but it decreased with a rise in temperature as presented in Fig. 7. The viscosity was enhanced up to 7.59%, 16.45%, and 49.39% at 0.05 wt. %, 0.1 wt.%, 0.2 wt.% at 20 o C, whereas at 60 o C, the enhancement was observed at about 16.66%, 33.33% and 70.83%, respectively as compared to water data. The enhancement in the viscosity of hybrid nanofluids is due to the high resistance among the fluid layers and the high density of nanoparticles [61,62]. The variation in viscosity affects the flow property parameters such as pumping power, convective heat transfer, and pressure drop. Van der Waals forces became noteworthy by increasing the particle concentration, which caused nanoclusters. These clusters opposed the fluid's movement and thus enhanced viscosity. The impact of increasing the volume concentration was significant at low temperatures as compared to high temperature, where the Van der Waals forces at high temperature are lower. Conclusively, the interaction between the molecules of the base fluid and the nanoparticles, as well as adhesive intermolecular forces among the particles, results in an increase of viscosity for the studied hybrid nanofluids.It was observed by increasing particle loading wt.% that the viscosity improved, but it decreased with a rise in temperature as presented in Fig. 7.

Each of them represents a case where the temperature and volume concentration of nanoparticles take a value of 20, 40, 50, and 60 o C and 0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2, respectively. The dataset was divided into two subsets. The first subset comprised of 75% (15 samples) of the data samples and was assigned to training. The remaining 25% (5 samples) was assigned for testing. The testing subset is usually used to guarantee the success of the training phase and ensure those model predictions are accurate and trustable. The fuzzy system's structure is Sugeno-type, which is the most appropriate one for modelling. The fuzzifying MF was selected in Gaussian shape, and the defuzzifying method was the Wavg. As the ANFIS is only applicable to a single output system, four ANFISes were constructed with a two-input one-output structure. Each ANFIS model represents one of the considered outputs.

Table 2 summarizes the statistical measures of the modelling phase. The table shows the lowest MSEs values found so far from the training, validating, and entire data for the four models. The error here is considered as the difference between the experimental output and the fuzzy prediction.

For a simple comparison between the fuzzy model computations and the experimental data, the visual plots are considered the easiest way. Therefore, the ANFISes outputs are plotted against the experimental values for the density, viscosity, thermal conductivity, and specific heat experimental datasets, respectively. The four models' outputs are plotted against the two inputs in a Three-Dimensional (3D) shape, as shown in figures (9a), (9b), (9c) and (9d). The plots are for both training and testing.

Also, it is worth mentioning that the negative value of the cost function shown in Figure 13a indicates that the sum of the normalized outputs to be maximized is more significant than the sum of the normalized outputs to be minimized. Until now, the optimization process had been performed within the experiment's upper and lower limits of the controlling variables. To maximize the benefits from the obtained fuzzy models, these limits were J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f extended in both lower and upper directions by 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 percent. This strategy was proposed to find out an optimal point outside the inputs' domain of the experimental data. Therefore, the optimization process was executed once again at each percent of the extended searching domain. The process was implemented for both single and multi-objective optimizations. From Table 4, it can be noticed that in a single optimization of the density, the lowest value is only found at a temperature of 56.258382 o C with no nanofluid mixture, and there are no benefits of extending the search space. However, the viscosity decreases by increasing the temperature but with the absence of the nanofluid material. On the other hand, the thermal conductivity is proportional to both temperatures as well as the percentage of the nanofluid material. Similarly, the specific heat also increases with the increase of both controlling variables.(13c) illustrate the solution agents' convergence curves throughout the optimization process for the objective function, temperature, and the nanofluid material percentage.

        <p>Based on Equation (7), Table 5 shows the values of the gains and the improvement measure in each state of the extending range of the inputs. Therefore, the proposed methodology succeeded in finding out the optimal values of the current system, not only in the case of experimental search-space but also when the inputs' domain was extended within a specific range. Utilizing appropriate optimization algorithms, the relative error between the actual data and the prediction models can be reduced, which is highly significant for the precision of the models.Based on Equation (7), Table 5 shows the values of the gains and the improvement measure in each state of the extending range of the inputs.

        <p>In this study, rGO/Co 3 O 4 nanocomposite was synthesized, characterized, and then the thermophysical nanofluid thermal conductivity and viscosity were investigated experimentally, and a maximum increment of 19.14% and 70.83% with 0.2% particle loadings at a temperature of 60 o C was obtained. At 0.05%, 0.1%, and 0.2% particle loading wt.%, the density increased by 0.115%, 0.23%, and 0.451% at a temperature of 20℃. Simultaneously, density increased by 0.117%%, 0.235%, and 0.469% respectively, at a temperature of 60℃, compared to water. At 0.2 wt.%, specific heat got reduced by 0.192% and 0.194% at 20 o C and 60 o C, respectively. When compared with water, no significant effect with the increase in temperature was observed: a similar trend as that of the water was followed by the prepared nanofluids. The main goal of this work is to determine the optimal values of temperature and the nanoparticle concentration that reduce the density and viscosity and maximize thermal conductivity and specific heat in a nanofluid mixture. An ANFIS model as an AI tool has been built for each output. Based on the four models, a recent MPA optimizer has been applied.
