        <p>This study explores the dynamic effect of non-renewable energy, renewable energy, economic growth, and foreign direct investment on environmental degradation in twenty selected African countries over the period 2000-2015. We have adopted Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis and the Pollution Haven/Halo hypothesis simultaneously. In the first stage, this paper performs cross-independence test and found cross-sectional dependence in carbon emissions, non-renewable energy, and renewable energy. In the second stage, it applies first generation and second generation unit root tests for panel data and found that all concerning variables are I(1) except for economic growth which is found I(0). Therefore, we used the Panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag approach using Pooled Mean Group, Mean Group, and Dynamic Fixed Effect estimators. The results indicate that all independent variables are significant and positive to CO2 emissions except for renewable energy found significant and negative to CO2 emissions in both short and long-term, and foreign direct investment found significant and positive only in the long term. Moreover, the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis did not hold in our sample, while we found strong evidence for the Pollution Haven hypothesis in selected African countries. Our results will encourage sample countries to implement different eco-innovation technologies that help cleaner and environmental competency, further, eco-innovation could also support in achieving green economic growth.This study explores the dynamic effect of non-renewable energy, renewable energy, economic growth, and foreign direct investment on environmental degradation in twenty selected African countries over the period 2000-2015.

        <p>Introduction:Introduction:</p>
        <p>The increasing of unwholesome climate may be the result of adopting unhealthful economic policies by the governments; these policies can be a threat to humanity and the environment as well. Reaching high rates of economic growth is the initial preoccupation of the policymakers, realizing these rates without taking into account other considerations may affect negatively environmental quality. Therefore, achieving sustainable economic growth must be an essential concern for the governments of developed countries and developing countries alike. Moreover, increasing economic growth in tandem with environmental quality and mitigating environmental damages is among the most important target that countries should endeavour to achieve sustainable development goals.The increasing of unwholesome climate may be the result of adopting unhealthful economic policies by the governments; these policies can be a threat to humanity and the environment as well.

        <p>Although energy is needed for economic development, it can the fundamental source of environmental degradation.

This papercontributes to the previous literature by re-exploring the significant difference between the effect of renewable energy and the effect of nonrenewable energy (sources of energy) on environmental quality especially in the Africa region that is characterized by its wealth in the energy sector (natural resource abundance).Although energy is needed for economic development, it can the fundamental source of environmental degradation.

        <p>In the last years, many studies focused their researches on the association between renewable, non-renewable energy, and environmental degradation, as well as the relationship between economic growth and environmental degradation, to investigate the benefits of renewable and non-renewable energy on both economic and environmental dimension.

        <p>Destek and Sinha (2020) have examined the impact of various variables on environmental Pata(2018), the results revealed that renewable energy had no effect on CO2 emission and suggested that renewable energy was not at a desirable level to reduce CO2 emissions.

        <p>Nguyen and Kakinaka (2018) investigated how the relationship between carbon emissions and renewable energy is related to the development stage by applying a panel cointegration analysis on 107 low and high-income countries covering the period from 1990 to 2013, the analysis revealed that renewable energy is associated positively with carbon emissions for low-income countries and associated negatively with carbon emissions for high-income countries.Nguyen and Kakinaka (2018) investigated how the relationship between carbon emissions and renewable energy is related to the development stage by applying a panel cointegration analysis on 107 low and high-income countries covering the period from 1990 to 2013, the analysis revealed that renewable energy is associated positively with carbon emissions for low-income countries and associated negatively with carbon emissions for high-income countries.</p>
        <p>The relationship between economic growth and the environment was verified by various researchers within a non-linear relationship, some of them found an inverted U-shape relationship between the aforementioned variables, this type of relationship recognized in The EKC hypothesis has been tested by two methods in the literature, the first one is by Quadratic models which are widely employed by most of the studies, these models include two coefficients, economic growth, and its square, the inverted U-shape relationship can be verified if the coefficient of economic growth is positive and the coefficient of the square of economic growth is negative. And the second one, by studying the short-run and long-run coefficients, Narayan et al.( 2010) pointed out that if the long-run coefficient is smaller than the short-run coefficient, then the EKC hypothesis is verified, this implies that the pollution is reduced as economic growth increased. In our study, we will test the EKC hypothesis based on comparing the short and long-run coefficients.The relationship between economic growth and the environment was verified by various researchers within a non-linear relationship, some of them found an inverted U-shape relationship between the aforementioned variables, this type of relationship recognized in The EKC hypothesis has been tested by two methods in the literature, the first one is by Quadratic models which are widely employed by most of the studies, these models include two coefficients, economic growth, and its square, the inverted U-shape relationship can be verified if the coefficient of economic growth is positive and the coefficient of the square of economic growth is negative.

        <p>We choose the Panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag (Panel ARDL) to investigate the effect of Energy, Economic Growth, and Foreign Direct Investment on Environmental Degradation in Africa countries over the period 2000-2015. This approach is suitable for variables with no matter whether the order of integration of the variables is I(0) or I (1) or both I(0) and I (1), further, it provides us with the short and long-run effect simultaneously, the empirical model of ARDL (p, q,q,…,q) of Pesaran et al.(1999) is given as follows : In our study, we estimated the three models PMG, MG, and DFE, and the Hausman (1978) test has been performed to reveal consistency and efficiency amidst the concerned estimators.We choose the Panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag (Panel ARDL) to investigate the effect of Energy, Economic Growth, and Foreign Direct Investment on Environmental Degradation in Africa countries over the period 2000-2015.

        <p>Before that, the Pesaran-Yamagata (2008) homogeneity test has been applied to unveil the slope heterogeneity or the slope homogeneity, we further carried out the Cross-Section Independence (CD) test of Pesaran (2004) from the results based on the calculated value of the delta and adjusted delta and their corresponding P.values, we can reject the null hypothesis of the slope coefficients are homogenous, and therefore, we must accept the alternative hypothesis of the slope coefficients are heterogeneous at 1% level of significance. Thus, the heterogeneous panel methods must be adopted. The lag order selection is the most important issue in the dynamics models, particularly in ARDL models. In several studies among them the study of Pesaran et al.(1999), the lag order was chosen in each country using the recognized lag length selection criteria (AIC, SBC, BIC, etc), and the most common lag among countries was selected. In our study, we choose the overall lag selection using selection criteria proposed by Abrigo The findings of both the first and second Panel Unit Root test are depicted in Table .8. The results of the CIPS test which assumes cross-section dependence, reveal that the variables with CD, namely CO2 emission, non-renewable energy, and renewable energy are not stationary at their levels, this implies that we fail to reject the null hypothesis of nonstationarity, however, we can reject the null hypothesis when the variables are in their first differences. These results mean that the variables have a unit root at levels, while they have not unit root at their first differences and then, these series are I(1).Before that, the Pesaran-Yamagata (2008) homogeneity test has been applied to unveil the slope heterogeneity or the slope homogeneity, we further carried out the Cross-Section Independence (CD) test of Pesaran (2004) from the results based on the calculated value of the delta and adjusted delta and their corresponding P.values, we can reject the null hypothesis of the slope coefficients are homogenous, and therefore, we must accept the alternative hypothesis of the slope coefficients are heterogeneous at 1% level of significance.

        <p>Regarding the results of the MW test which applied on the variables that correlated across the group, namely, economic growth and foreign direct investment, we find that the null hypothesis of having unit root is rejected in the case of economic growth at level, this implies that the variable is stationary at the level and it is I(0). Whilst, we find that foreign direct investment hasa unit root at level, but it is stationary at the first difference, therefore, it is I(1). With PMG estimation, the findings validate the long-run relationship amongst variables, since the coefficient of the error term is negative and statistically significant at a 1% level of significance. The short-run estimation reveals that renewable energy reduces significantly CO2 emission by 1.27%, which implies that renewable energy contributes to the environmental quality in investigated countries in the short-run, while economic growth increase significantly CO2 emission by 0.224% in the short-run, and thereis no significant impact of the rest of variables in the short-run. The long-run estimation givesstrongevidencethatnon-renewable energy increase significantly the environmental degradation by 1.38%, and affirms that economic growth has a negative effect on environmental quality in Africa countries, however, the findings did not exhibit anysignificant impact neither onrenewable energy nor of foreign direct investment in longrun. In sum, renewable energy affects the environment positively only in the short-run and non-renewable energy affects it negatively in the long-run, whereas economic growth affects it negatively in both the short and long-run.Regarding the results of the MW test which applied on the variables that correlated across the group, namely, economic growth and foreign direct investment, we find that the null hypothesis of having unit root is rejected in the case of economic growth at level, this implies that the variable is stationary at the level and it is I(0).

        <p>In terms of MG estimation, the empirical findings of error correction coefficient confirm the long-run relationship amidst mentioned variables, we find only a short significant effect of just renewable energy and economic growth at 1% level of significance, renewable energy has a positive impact on the quality of the environment, it can reduce CO2 emission by 1.44% whilst economic growth has a negative impact on the quality of the environment, it can increase CO2 emission by 0.376%.In terms of MG estimation, the empirical findings of error correction coefficient confirm the long-run relationship amidst mentioned variables, we find only a short significant effect of just renewable energy and economic growth at 1% level of significance, renewable energy has a positive impact on the quality of the environment, it can reduce CO2 emission by 1.44% whilst economic growth has a negative impact on the quality of the environment, it can increase CO2 emission by 0.376%.</p>
        <p>Based on DFE estimation, a significant long-run relationship is also affirmed, we find that all independent variables exacerbate significantly CO2 emissions both in short term and long term except for FDI which affect significantly CO2 emissions only in long term. In the short term, a 1% increase in non-renewable energy leads to an increase in pollution by 0.18%, and a 1% increase in economic growth leads to an increase in pollution by 0.149%, while an increase by 1% in renewable energy decreases pollution by 0.68%. In the long term, nonrenewable energy, economic growth, and FDI contribute significantly tothe degradation of the environment, a 1% increase in non-renewable energy, economic growth, and FDI, leads to an increase in environmental pollution by 0.705%, 2.726%, 2.308% respectively. Whereas the negative impact of renewable energy on environmental pollution is confirmed in long term as well, a 1% increase in renewable energy helps to improve the environment by 1.317%.Based on DFE estimation, a significant long-run relationship is also affirmed, we find that all independent variables exacerbate significantly CO2 emissions both in short term and long term except for FDI which affect significantly CO2 emissions only in long term.

        <p>The efficiency of PMG, MG, and DFE estimators is examined by Hausman (1978) test, the results are presented in Table.9, the results of the test show that PMG estimator is preferred than MG estimator, however, DFE estimator is the most effective and suitable than both of the PMG estimator and MG estimator. Hence we rely on our discussion on the findings of DFE.The efficiency of PMG, MG, and DFE estimators is examined by Hausman (1978) test, the results are presented in Table.9, the results of the test show that PMG estimator is preferred than MG estimator, however, DFE estimator is the most effective and suitable than both of the PMG estimator and MG estimator.

        <p>From the selected findings (DFE), we find that non-renewable energy has a positive impact on carbon emissions in analyzed countries both in the short-run and long-run, this finding suggests that despite non-renewable energy can enhance the economic growth in these countries, however, it can aggravate the degradation of their environment, and it does not protect their environment. Empirical recent studies provided evidence of the positive impact of non-renewable energy on both economic growth and environmental degradation, and indicated that non-renewable energy contributes to economic growth at the same pace as carbon dioxide emission growth (Bildirici and Kayikci (2013) In order to achieve the 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development, particularly SDG7 and SDG13, the countries under study must make shift from dirty and unsustainable energy to clean and sustainable energy. The adoption of the renewable energies can reduce the risk of climate change such as heat wave, droughts, floods and water problems, it can mitigate also greenhouse gas emission and then reducing health risks . Moreover, for acheiving sustainable economic development in these countries , it should ensure that every one has access to clean, affordable , reliable and modern energy.From the selected findings (DFE), we find that non-renewable energy has a positive impact on carbon emissions in analyzed countries both in the short-run and long-run, this finding suggests that despite non-renewable energy can enhance the economic growth in these countries, however, it can aggravate the degradation of their environment, and it does not protect their environment.

        <p>In addition, the coefficient of economic growth is positive and significant at a 10% level of significance in the short-run as well as in long run, however, the coefficient of the long run is greater than the coefficient of the short run. This result implies that the pollution is increasing as economic growth increasing, which has given us strong evidence against the EKC hypothesis, and therefore, the hypothesis of EKC does not hold for selected African In regards to the PHH or PHV hypothesis, we find that FDI has a positive and significant effect on CO2 emissions, which implies that FDI inflow to Africa countries is harmful to their environment. Although the importance of FDI in boosting economic growth, however, it can affect negatively and significantly environmental quality.In addition, the coefficient of economic growth is positive and significant at a 10% level of significance in the short-run as well as in long run, however, the coefficient of the long run is greater than the coefficient of the short run.

        <p>Several studies gave empirical evidence of the significance and mixed role of FDI in both economic development and environmental quality by providing technological innovation in both fields. And other studies suggested that the negative impact of FDI on the environmental quality can be explained by the low level of FDI inflow to the receiving countries, while, if FDI inflow reached a high level, it can contribute significantly to improving the environment. Wang et al. (2020) concluded that when the magnitude of FDI inflows is weak, the technological innovation capabilities aggravate the volume of the environmental pollution, whereas, if the level of FDI inflow exceeds a higher threshold, then the technological innovation capabilities enhance environmental quality.Several studies gave empirical evidence of the significance and mixed role of FDI in both economic development and environmental quality by providing technological innovation in both fields.

        <p>On the other side, the positive impact of FDI on pollution can be also an indicator that FDI is attracted by lenient environmental regulations as mentioned by Xing(2002). Thus, environmental degradation can be one of the determinants of FDI that aimed at countries with lax environmental degradation.On the other side, the positive impact of FDI on pollution can be also an indicator that FDI is attracted by lenient environmental regulations as mentioned by Xing(2002).

        <p>This research paper tries to explore the dynamic effect of non-renewable energy, renewable energy, economic growth, and foreign direct investment on environmental degradation in twenty selected African countries and over the period 2000-2015. To test two important hypotheses, the EKC hypothesis, and the PHH hypothesis, we firstly carried out the crossindependence test and we detected cross-sectional dependence in carbon emissions, nonrenewable energy, and renewable energy, but not in economic growth and foreign direct investment. We, therefore, performed in second stage, both of the first generation and second generation unit root tests and found that all concerning variables are I(1) except for economic growth which was found I(0). Finally, we applied the ARDL approach using MG, PMG, and DFE estimators.This research paper tries to explore the dynamic effect of non-renewable energy, renewable energy, economic growth, and foreign direct investment on environmental degradation in twenty selected African countries and over the period 2000-2015.

        <p>Concerning the findings of DFE estimation that was selected by the Hausman (1978) test, we reveal that there is a cointegration amid the aforementioned variables. The main findings from our estimation are that all independent variables affect significantly and positively CO2 emissions, excluding renewable energy which affect significantly and negatively CO2 emissions, moreover, all independent variables affect significantly CO2 emissions both in short term and in long term, except for FDI which affects it significantly and positively only in long term. Thus, EKC is not validated in the sampled countries contrary to the PHH hypothesis (PHH) hypothesis which is verified in the long term in countries under consideration. The positive impact of FDI on carbon emission implies that this type of FDI transfers heavily-polluting industries to host countries.Concerning the findings of DFE estimation that was selected by the Hausman (1978) test, we reveal that there is a cointegration amid the aforementioned variables.

        <p>Thus, the appropriate public-private cooperation would be necessary to mitigate climate change by providing commercial incentives from the public sector to the private sector to invest in mitigation projects (Zhang and Maruyama, 2001) Therefore, adopting public-private partnership investment can boost economic growth on one hand, and control environmental harms on the other hand.Thus, the appropriate public-private cooperation would be necessary to mitigate climate change by providing commercial incentives from the public sector to the private sector to invest in mitigation projects (Zhang and Maruyama, 2001) Therefore, adopting public-private partnership investment can boost economic growth on one hand, and control environmental harms on the other hand.</p>
        <p>The policymakers in these countries should consider on alternative green trade plans that would restrict the import of unclean energy, fossil fuels and coal. This mechanism can support and develop the way for implementation of substitute energy solutions across countries and decrease CO2. It will help environmental quality and trade balance. Therefore, some elements of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) might be accomplished as well (for e.g. see (1) SDG 7, namely, affordable and clean energy, and (2) SDG 13, namely, climate action, UNDP 2017).The policymakers in these countries should consider on alternative green trade plans that would restrict the import of unclean energy, fossil fuels and coal.

Using a balanced regional panel of China dataset from 1995 to 2012 by Chen et al. (2019), the effect of both renewable and non-renewable energy on carbon emission was investigated by applying FMOLS and DOLS, the findings indicated that non-renewable energy had a positive effect on CO2, and this effect is varied across the region, while renewable energy had a negative impact on CO2 in Eastern and Western regions and panel countries. Zhang and Liu (2019) explored the linkage among CO2 emission, nonrenewable and renewable energy in a panel of 10 northeast and southeast Asian countries during the period from 1995-2014, based on results of FMOLS and AMG, they concluded that non-renewable energy is the main source of carbon emissions, whereas renewable energy can reduce carbon emissions. Other researchers affirmed the necessity of adoption of renewable energy rather than non-renewable energy to control environmental damages, like Sharif et al.(2019) whose analysed the association among renewable and non-renewable energy with environmental suggested that renewable energy has not reached the threshold required to generate a positive effect on the environmental quality. Alolaet al.(2019) found similar results by using PMG-ARDL on panel data of 16-EU countries from 1997 to 2014 to check the role of renewable energy in achieving sustainable environmental goals, the results showed that both renewable energy and non-renewable energy affect negatively the environmental quality measured by ecological footprint in the long run. However, the estimation results indicated that renewable energy increases far lower the environmental deterioration as compared to non-renewable energy.
