        <p>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted surging interest lately due to their wide potential in several frontline application areas like gas storage, sensing, photovoltaics, fuel cells, active catalyst supports, and so on. However, only very few reports are available for the metal-free electrocatalysis over COFs. Herein, we developed a new thiadiazole-based COF, C4-SHz COF, through the reaction between 1,3,5-tris(4-formylphenyl)benzene and 2,5-dihydrazinyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole that possesses a very high specific surface area of 1224 m 2 g -1 , unique molecular architecture, high porosity, and abundant active sites. The as-synthesized C4-SHz COF displayed superior electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and excellent long-term durability. The electrocatalytic performance of the C4-SHz COF achieved a current density of 10 mA/cm 2 at an overpotential of 320 mV. The higher activity of the C4-SHz COF could be attributed to the high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area, porosity, and network structure of the π-conjugated organic building blocks, which allowed fast charge and mass transport processes. This work validates the promising potential of a metal-free COF electrocatalyst toward the OER and its capability to replace carbon-based electrocatalysts.</p>
        <p>Rapid decay of fossil fuels combined with environmental crises associated with carbon emissions significantly affected the economy and ecology of the whole world. Thus, the demand for renewable energy is surging over the years, and electrochemical water splitting can be considered as a green and promising technology 1 to overcome this problem. The electrochemical water splitting plays a crucial role in advanced energy technologies, such as solar fuel production, supercapacitor, metal-air batteries, etc. 2-5 Still, water oxidation (oxygen evolution reaction, OER) requires a higher energy input due to the involvement of the multi-electron transfer reaction pathway and its low efficiency. Hence, the commercialization of water splitting technology requires stable, highly active, and low-cost water oxidation electrocatalysts. Currently, precious transition metal oxide-based electrocatalysts such as RuO 2 and IrO 2 are highly active toward the OER from alkaline water. However, high cost, scarcity, and low stability hamper the utilization of clean and sustainable energy technologies 6,7 in this context. Thus, for the past couple of years, extensive efforts have been devoted for the development of earth-abundant, low-cost, and efficient transition metalbased electrocatalysts such as oxides, chalcogenides, phosphides, nitride, metal-free catalysts, etc., for the OER. [8][9][10][11][12][13][14] However, most of the transition metal-based catalysts still suffer from lower catalytic activity, inferior conductivity, and poor operational durability.</p>
        <p>Figures S1-S3, Supporting Information). The resultant assynthesized imine-linked framework has shown a low sign of crystallinity (Figure 1d), and this could often occur due to the self-assembly through weak π-π stacking interaction of individual COF layers. To get the well-defined molecular stacked framework, the as-synthesized C4-SHz COF material was activated using supercritical carbon dioxide treatment following the reported protocol by Medina et al. 34 The more prominent desired peaks in X-ray diffraction for the postactivated material is observed (Figure 1d), suggesting the welldefined structure of pores. Surprisingly, the measured S BET values are also mirroring this trend by narrowing the pore size (Figure S4, Supporting Information).</p>
        <p>The crystalline structure of the C4-SHz COF is resolved through the experimental powder X-ray diffraction measurement in combination with theoretical simulations and Pawley refinement (Figure S5 and Tables S1 andS2, Supporting Information). As seen in Figure 1c, a distinct peak at 2θ = 3.3°1 is assigned to the 100 crystal plane of the COF. Additionally, relatively weak peaks at 2θ = 5.8 and 9.9°correspond to the reflection from 110, and 300 planes are also observed. The weak broad peak centered at 2θ = 20-26°(002 plane) is possibly due to the interlayer π-π stacking of the COF, and distances between the individual 002 planes are ca. 3.85 Å (Figure 1b). A probable 2D model structure was constructed using Materials Studio 7 in the P1 space group. An asymmetric unit in the crystal structure and graphical representation of the 2D layered COF is shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information). The simulated PXRD pattern of the eclipsed AA stacking model is well fitted with the experimental diffraction data (Figure 1c). In contrast, the PXRD pattern obtained from the AB stacking model deviates from the experimentally observed data, especially in terms of peak intensity ratios. The perfect agreement in favor of the experimental X-ray pattern was further confirmed by Pawley refinement [R wp = 7.23%, Rp = 5.32%] (Figure S5). The specific surface area and porous nature of the C4-SHz COF were examined by conducting N 2 adsorption-desorption f2 analysis at 77 K. As shown in Figure 2a, the C4-SHz COF exhibits a combination of type I and IV isotherms. A significant nitrogen uptake at low relative pressures (P/P 0 &lt; 0.03) followed by a gradual increase in adsorption at a higher P/P 0 value suggested the distinctive features for the coexistence of micropores and mesopores along with interparticle pores. [35][36][37][38] The corresponding pore size distribution plot (Figure 2b), as determined from the adsorption branch of the isotherm based on nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT), revealed the presence of micropores and mesopores in our C4-SHz COF material. The calculated BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, S BET ) surface area from this isotherm was 1224 m 2 g -1 , and the total pore volume was 1.12 cc g -1 . The simulated BET surface area of the AA stacked model of the C4-SHz COF has been computed using the DFTB calculations. The corresponding simulated specific surface area was found to be 2339 m 2 g -1 (Figure S7, Supporting Information). The noticeable distinction in BET surface area from the experimental data is related to the crystallinity of the COF material, and such deviations were also reported for other imine-based COFs. [39][40][41][42] The structural growth and imine linkage formation of the COF are confirmed by FTIR and 13 C MAS NMR analyses. In f3 the FTIR spectrum of the C4-SHz COF (Figure 3a), the absorption band at 1693 cm -1 corresponded to CN absorption, which is also confirmed by the resonance signal at 160.2 ppm in 13 C NMR. The peak at 3416 cm -1 could be attributed to N-H stretching vibration. The complete utilization of the aldehyde sources was confirmed by the missing peak at 1698 cm -1 in the IR spectrum and the absence of aldehydic resonance peak at 190 ppm in 13 the C4-SHz COF shows a high electrochemical catalytic surface area that may be due to the exposed excess nitrogen atom on the surface, which plays as the active sites for the OER activity. The high surface area and the porous structure can facilitate the diffusion of the electrolyte to access more number of reactant species on the electrode surface that resulted in an enhanced performance during the OER. The high mass and specific activity of the C4-SHz COF may also be associated with fast charge transfer during the OER process. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) Nyquist plot of the C4-SHz COF is also presented in Figure 5e. The smaller polarization resistance of the C4-SHz COF indicates the higher charge transfer kinetics and faster electron transfer process that supports the OER activity. 46 The durability is another key factor to evaluate the catalytic activity in practical application.</p>
        <p>The long-term durability of the C4-SHz COF has been studied by chronopotentiometry measurements. The time-dependent chronopotentiometry measurements demonstrate that the C4-SHz COF is a stable material and can work efficiently for more than 11 h at a current density of 10 mA/cm 2 (Figure 5f).</p>
        <p>Further, the stability of the C4-SHz COF at higher current densities (20 and 50 mA/cm 2 ) has been checked with timedependent chronopotentiometry measurement (Figure S16, Supporting Information). The as-synthesized material shows a quite stable response at higher current densities as well. The on the C4-SHz surface has been calculated, and free-energy profiles for OER pathways at U = 0 and 1.23 V are given in Figure 6c. For OH -adsorption on the C4-SHz surface, there are seven possible sites, including the S atom (Figure 6b and Figure S19, Supporting Information). However, adsorption of OH -is more favorable on the C2 site with the highest OH - adsorption energy of -1.61 eV (Figure 6b and Table S4).</p>
        <p>However, there are very weak interactions between OH -and either the N3 or S site (Figure S19e,f). Therefore, the active site for OH -adsorption is predominantly the C2 site. From the free-energy profile diagram (Figure 6c), it is evident that OOH* adsorption with the highest (most positive) free-energy The free-energy values of OOH* adsorption on the C4-SHz 383 surface are 4.13 and 0.44 eV at U = 0 and 1.23 V. This finding 384 is consistent with the earlier reported COF material as the 385 metal-free OER electrocatalyst. 33 To get further insight about 386 the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the C4-SHz COF, we 387 have performed density of states (DOS) analysis. Total and 388 projected density of states (TDOS and PDOS) analysis clearly 389 demonstrates that the VBM is mainly composed of the 2p 390 orbital of C atoms, whereas the 2p orbitals of heteroatoms, i.e., 391 N and S atoms, contribute to the CBM (Figure S20, 392 Supporting Information). Among various C sites, as evident 393 from Figure S20b, the major contribution to the VBM comes 394 from the C2 sites. Therefore, upon adsorption of energy, holes 395 will be generated mainly on C atoms (especially on the C2 396 atom), and heteroatom sites will be electron-rich. For the OER 397 process in alkaline medium, OH -is oxidized to O 2 after 398 absorbing holes from the active C2 sites, which is consistent 399 with previously reported COFs and heteroatom-doped 400 graphene systems. 33,48,49 Besides, we have determined the 401 free-energy profile for the OER pathway at an applied bias of 402 1.48 V (Figure 6d), which is the experimentally determined 403 onset potential. Interestingly, the energy profile diagram 404 exhibits the downhill OER pathway at U = 1.48 V, validating 405 the experimental findings of the OER onset overpotential. 406 Moreover, the downhill OER pathway at U = 1.48 V also 407 indicates that the lower overpotential (merely 250 mV) arises 408 due to the C2 active site on the surface. 33</p>
        <p>In summary, we have fabricated a novel thiadiazole-based covalent organic framework, C4-SHz COF, through the Schiff base condensation polymerization reaction between 1,3,5tris(4-formylphenyl)benzene and 2,5-dihydrazinyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole under vacuum in a sealed tube. The resultant material displayed a unique molecular architecture, high porosity, BET surface area, and accessible active sites, which could enable this COF as a superior self-supported metal-free OER electrocatalyst. In the alkaline system, the material showed a low onset potential of 270 mV, and the material achieved a current density of 10 mA/cm 2 with a lower overpotential of 320 mV.</p>
        <p>The accomplished OER activity is comparable to other best reported metal-free catalysts with excellent durability. Therefore, the catalytic performance exhibited by C4-SHz COF suggests that it may replace metal-free carbon-based nanomaterials and could be a promising electrocatalyst for future energy conversion from abundant water resources.</p>
