        <p>facilities, sanitary spas, lighting-related facilities, and so on (Faizollahzadeh Ardabili et al., 2016;Ma et al., 2017). In addition, different pieces of equipment are installed in each building depending on the type of building, each of which in turn consumes energy. Therefore, in each building, energy is used in different ways to face the needs of residents. Buildings are candidates for about forty percent of the total energy consumption (Vázquez-Canteli et al., 2019). The management of the energy in buildings can be considered as one of the important aspects of smart cities. The sustainability index in urban development can be carefully considered as a social function of energy generation and local consumption in each developing city. The sustainability index of urban development efficiently is a function of energy generation and direct consumption of each developing city. The energy consumption of buildings is responsible for a considerable value of energy consumption in an urban settlement (Ardabili et al., 2019a;Nosratabadi et al., 2019). There are several techniques aiming to accurately estimate and predict the energy production and consumption in the building sector (Mocanu et al., 2016;Li et al., 2017;Singaravel et al., 2018). In overall, at the building level, two types of necessary actions in this direction can be helpful. A series of models are based on physical principles to justify thermal dynamics and energy behavior in mathematical language. These models are the basic models and are characterized based on the type of building and effective parameters. Models developed based on statistical methods are other types of models that are used to estimate the energy consumption based on variables affecting climate and energy costs. From this perspective, the forecasting of demand and consumption is important in development of smart cities. Machine learning (ML)-based techniques, as a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), can provide a practical platform for modeling by considering a wide range of parameters (Fan et al., 2017). ML-based techniques have recently contributed significantly in implementing the reliable estimation models (Amasyali et al., 2018;Zou et al., 2018;Cai et al., 2019;Guiqing Zhang et al., 2020). Several researchers have employed ML-based techniques in different fields of area (Safdari Shadloo et al., 2021). Yahya et al. (2021) employed multilayer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function (RBF), cascade feedforward (CFF), and generalized regression neural networks (GRNN) for estimation of the thermal conductivity of water-alumina nanofluids (Yahya et al., 2021). Zhang et al. (2021) employed an AI-based optimization procedure to obtain the highest efficiency of an off-grid hybrid renewable energy scheme composed of wind, fuel cell, and hydrogen storage schemes (Weiping Zhang et al., 2021). Therefore, these techniques cover a wide range of scientific fields. Figure 1 claims the exponential trend in implementing the MLbased techniques in this realm during the past decade. The main contribution of the present study is to peruse the use of novel MLbased techniques in forming the applications of smart cities in terms of energy. The scope covers the building energy (BE) demand and consumption and energy load prediction which are the key energy concerns in the building sector (Chou and Ngo, 2016;Fan et al., 2019;Chaobo Zhang et al., 2020).facilities, sanitary spas, lighting-related facilities, and so on (Faizollahzadeh Ardabili et al., 2016;Ma et al., 2017).

        <p>In this way, there are several survey articles which have been developed with a little overlap in terms of the purpose of the study. Martinez et al. (2021) developed a survey article for analyzing the AI-based approach employed in distribution networks (Barja-Martinez et al., 2021). Hasan and Roy (2021) developed a review work by emphasizing on the application of DL-based techniques, transfer learning, active learning, and reinforcement learning for handling the cyber-physical building environment energy consumption (Hasan et al., 2021). In a review work by Mohapatra et al. (2021), ML-based and DL-based techniques are evaluated only for predicting the BE consumption (Mohapatra et al., 2021). Uzum et al. (2021), in a review work, evaluated the possible solutions with AI-, DL-, and ML-based optimization techniques for analyzing the effects of rooftop PV on distribution networks (Uzum et al., 2021). Vázquez-Canteli et al. (2019) developed a survey study to analyze the reinforcement learning techniques applied for demand response applications in the smart grid (Vázquez-Canteli et al., 2019). Panchalingam and Chan (2019) developed a survey study for describing and analyzing the energy use in smart buildings using the applications of MLand DL-based techniques (Panchalingam and Chan, 2021). A number of recent surveys studied the application of machine learning in building energy. However, there is still a gap in the presence of a standard review article where the PRISMA statement is correctly adapted. In addition, an in-depth investigation on the accuracy of the model accuracy is still missing. Other differences are the taxonomy content, study concept, and the perspective of the study, as well as the main findings of the study. The limitations of the concepts used, as well as the study of a limited community of applications of ML-based techniques in previous studies, led to a more comprehensive study in the present survey to cover the weaknesses of previous studies. One of the main weaknesses in previous studies was the evaluation of ML-based and DL-based techniques in energy applications in building sectors. On the other hand, according to studies, the existence of a systematic review article based on a standard method that can extract all the strengths and weaknesses of using machine learning methods and deep learning in energy applications in the building, is missing. The PRISMA method is a method of preparing review articles that have not been discussed in this field. Accordingly, the present study presents a comprehensive systematic review based on the standard PRISMA method. The present study has taken steps to cover these weaknesses by providing evaluation methods and comparing different models in different applications. Accordingly, the present work has four main steps. The first step is to describe the main procedure of the searching and methodology for developing the base of the study. The second step is to analyze the studies with different ML-and DL-based techniques separately in different applications. The third step is to analyze the results and main findings including advantages and dis-advantages of each method in each application, and the final step is to summarize and conclude the main findings and suggestions of the study.In this way, there are several survey articles which have been developed with a little overlap in terms of the purpose of the study.

        <p>The procedure of data collection for review process adopts the PRISMA standard. According to Mosavi et al., (2020), the PRISMA method defines four main levels including: 1) identification, 2) screening, 3) eligibility, and 4) inclusion for developing a systematic review. According to the identification stage, an initial search was performed among the databases. Using Thomson Reuters Web-of-Science (WoS) and Elsevier Scopus, 350 of the most relevant articles are identified. The next level is screening the duplicate articles and choosing the relevant articles according to the title and abstract section. In this level, 70 articles have been identified. The next step is eligibility, to study the full text of articles by authors and to select the relevant articles by considering the eligibility for the final review process. In this level, 52 articles have been selected for the required evaluations. The final level of the PRISMA technique is to build the database of the study for qualitative and quantitative comparisons. The database of the present study includes 52 articles, for performing the required analyses. Figure 2 presents the flowchart of forming the database of the current study using the PRISMA technique.The procedure of data collection for review process adopts the PRISMA standard.

Recently, ANN-based techniques have been successfully used in the BE information sector for controlling, prediction, and optimization tasks. Ayoub et al. (2018) developed the ANN for the forecasting task in the energy demand sector for buildings for considering the building demand in the presence of a hybrid supply system. Accordingly, results claimed that the ANN could cope with the forecasting task. But there was a need for a robust model for preventing overfitting issues. Marmaras et al. (2017) presented an ANN-predictive model for the estimation of power demand in buildings. Six commercial buildings' electricity demand data were employed in order to train the ANN method. Data were collected from a business park during 1 year. Results claimed that the ANN provided higher accuracy and lower error values in comparing the model outputs and target values. Avni et al. (Es et al., 2014) developed the ANN method for the estimation of energy demand in Turkey using the population and area of the building. The developed ANN technique has been compared with linear regression in terms of accuracy and the robustness of methods. ANN provided higher accuracy than that for the LR technique. Buratti et al. (2014) performed a study for the optimization of the cooling energy demand using the ANN method in the presence of indoor thermal comfort. All of these studies have successfully employed the ANN to obtain the desired results. However, in further studies, researchers found that ANN-based methods can be successful only under certain conditions so that researchers have compared different methods with the ANN to reach an accurate model. The most common of these methods was the support vector-based methods.where I j is the input value from the neuron i to neuron j in the presence of O i as the output value of the neuron i. w ij is the weight value, and w 0j is the related bias for the neuron j.

        <p>Hybrid methods are appeared for generating robust techniques by combining single methods for different purposes such as prediction, classification, and optimization purposes. The main aim is to collect the advantages of different methods and eliminate the disadvantage of methods.

(2019) developed a comparative study for forecasting the energy load in the building sector. The developed methods were the RNN and CNN. Results have been evaluated by accuracy and processing time. CNN could improve the accuracy and the reduction of processing time in comparison with the RNN method.The RNN has been developed in order to handle sequences and patterns such as text, handwriting, and speech. RNN works based on cyclic connections in the structure and imports recurrent computations as input data. The RNN is generally based on the standard ANN that has been extended across time by having edges which feed into the next time step instead of into the next layer in the same time step. Supplementary Figure S9 shows the architecture of the RNN. Additional explanations about the RNN method have been presented in our previous study entitled the "list of DL techniques" (Ardabili et al., 2019b;Mosavi et al., 2020). Hribar et al.

        <p>LSTM can be considered as a subset of the RNN method which is used as a general purpose computer by employing the feedback connections. The applications of LSTM are sequences and pattern recognition and image processing. The architecture of LSTM contains the input gate, output gate and forget gate. Supplementary Figure S10 presents the architecture of the LSTM method. Additional explanations about the RNN method have been presented in our previous study entitled the "list of DL techniques" (Ref. deep learning). Wang et al.

In another study, Singaravel et al. (2018) developed single-, two-, and three-layered LSTM method for forecasting BE demand factors. The developed methods have been compared with the ANN in terms of accuracy and R2 values. DL techniques have been introduced to play effective roles in decreasing the processing time and enhancing the accuracy and robustness by increasing the prediction sustainability. As a result, DL techniques could successfully cope with the estimation, and the best prediction performance has been owned by the twolayered LSTM method. Laib et al. (2019) proposed the LSTM technique for forecasting gas consumption in the building sector. Prediction results have been compared with the ANN in terms of Ruiz et al. (2019) provided an exploration for the estimation of BE consumption. The developed methods were LSTM, 
            <rs type="software">ELMAN</rs>, and NARX methods. Findings have been analyzed using RMSE values. Accordingly, LSTM could generate accurate output values and provided the highest robustness. In another study, Jain et al. (2020) proposed a comparative study for the prediction of electricity demand in the building sector using 
            <rs type="software">XGBoost</rs>, 
            <rs type="software">ARIMA</rs>, LSTM, and ANN. Evaluations and comparisons have been performed using MAPE and RMSE factors. Based on results, 
            <rs type="software">XGBoost</rs> followed by LSTM provided the highest prediction performance compared with the 
            <rs type="software">ARIMA</rs> and ANN.

        <p>The CNN can be considered as one of the most popular DL methods. This architecture of the DL method generally handles image processing applications. CNN has three layers called convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. In each CNN, there are two stages for training process: the feed-forward stage and the back-propagation stage. Supplementary Figure S11 presents the architecture of the CNN technique. Additional explanations about the RNN method have been presented in our previous study entitled the "list of DL techniques" (Mosavi et al., 2019;Nosratabadi et al., 2019). Despotovic et al.

        <p>According to the results discussed in the previous section, forecasting can be considered as the major application for the use of ML-based techniques. Supplementary Figure S13 presents the trend and allocations of each application. According to Supplementary Figure S13, it can be claimed that the main trend follows forecasting in the BE sector. As it is known, the application of AI in the fields related to the building industry is increasing so that this increase is significant in the field of forecasting and estimation. As can be deduced from Supplementary Figure S13, most applications are related to forecasting, optimization, and clustering because these applications can be the key to entering the field of monitoring, building management, and developing intelligent security systems. On the other hand, they can also make tremendous progress in the field of smart buildings. One of the main criteria that can be discussed in this study is the issue of energy in the building.

        <p>As is clear from Supplementary Figure S14, LSTM followed by the ANN and CNN has the highest allocation in BE sectors. LSTM and ANN have been employed for forecasting the energy load, energy consumption, and energy demand, and the CNN has been employed for forecasting the energy demand and energy load. The use of each model for a specific application has some advantages and disadvantages. Supplementary Table S10 presents the advantages and disadvantages of each model for forecasting applications in the BE sector. According to Supplementary Table S10, it can be particularly concluded that using the DL and ensemble techniques can be successful in case of long-term records with an extra degree of freedom which includes a huge volume of data. But in case of a small volume of dataset or short-term predictions, single MLtechniques such as ANN, SVM, or hybrid ML techniques can be effective for taking a proper modeling performance in a limited process time. The amount of energy available in a building is usually directly related to the amount of comfort of its occupants. At the same time, it is also related to various categories such as environmental pollution, the volume of energy reserves at our disposal, and the costs of consumption in the form of energy. Prediction, forecasting, and estimation in the BE sector with the approach of optimization, management, and monitoring of energy availability in various applications can be considered the point of compromise between the comfort of the building and other categories and concerns of the economic field and the environmental sustainability. The output of this study can be important from two points of view: the first is to identify weaknesses and resource management in order to move towards smart energy consumption, which can be a subset of smart buildings, and the second is to focus on smart net-zero energy or smart low-net energy buildings. In today's world, due to the scarcity of energy resources, the importance of optimal energy consumption has become more and more important. An intelligent structure is a structure consisting of various control systems in which the activities and interactions of objects are completely intelligently managed. Therefore, a comprehensive management system and intelligent building by linking all subsystems of the building, which unites and monitors different parts of the buildings to optimize energy consumption, improve efficiency and productivity devices, create value increases in the building, and increases the level of comfort in the building. In this regard, the role of the Internet of Things can be more significant. Although it can be claimed that smart energy systems in the building sector are costly, the cost of this system is offset by saving energy consumption and reducing service and maintenance costs.As is clear from Supplementary Figure S14, LSTM followed by the ANN and CNN has the highest allocation in BE sectors.

        <p>Smart energy systems in a building are generally defined in terms of information and communication. For example, the amount of ambient light to determine the number of lamps needed to provide lighting requires sensors to measure the ambient light, a system that calculates the number of lamps required, a steering system, and a communication system to communicate between the components. The general basis for this connection in the computer world is data networks such as the Internet. Therefore, in order to achieve a large information system that includes other information such as the temperature in addition to lighting data, objects work together in data networks. This interaction between objects in a computer is called the Internet of Things. Based on this, objects send and receive information with the help of predefined identifiers in the heart of Internet protocols and are in relation to the information of other objects. This information communication of objects, which is called the Internet of Things, is performed through smart devices such as mobile phones. The importance of a smart energy system is also important from other aspects. In any case, energy resources are limited, and providing smart solutions for their optimal use can guarantee a better future. Depending on the texture and pattern of the city, there are numerous renewable energy sources available such as the solar and wind energy or non-renewable sources such as electricity coming from a power plant with fuel. Smart energy systems can be considered in the form of confronting the mentioned limitations in order to increase the level of satisfaction and at the same time reduce the cost. For example, the existence of smart curtains to deal with the sun and its effect on reducing the temperature of the building in summer or vice versa, using it to deal with winter cold along with other factors such as the amount of light required by the building, can be an example of the category Be. This level of intelligence, in addition to preventing energy waste, can increase the level of satisfaction and increase the life of construction equipment, reduce the time required for service, and reduce energy costs. Therefore, it is considered part of the principles of building engineering. It is necessary to explain that intelligence is not necessarily based on electronic and computer equipment, and the implementation of intelligent plans in building construction or intelligent selection of building equipment and facilities can also be discussed and accepted as intelligence. Future studies are moving toward the use of the Internet of Things in the smart energy systems in the building sector where advanced machine learning methods are used (Chen et al., 2020;Yanan Zhang et al., 2021;Hu et al., 2021;Zhao et al., 2021). The recent developments in this area big data and machine learning have motivated methods that can process stochastic problems in energy sectors. For instance, the methods (Shan et al., 2021;Tu et al., 2021) due to the higher performance would be a good candidate for building energy research.Smart energy systems in a building are generally defined in terms of information and communication.
