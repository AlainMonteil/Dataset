        <p>Electrolytic or solar-driven reduction of CO2 to CO using heterogenized molecular catalysts is a promising approach towards production of a key chemical feedstock, as well as mitigating CO2 emissions. Here, we report a molecular cobalt-phthalocyanine catalyst bearing four phosphonic acid anchoring groups (CoPcP) that can be immobilized on metal oxide electrodes. A hybrid electrode with CoPcP on mesoporous TiO2 (mesoTiO2) converts CO2 to CO in aqueous electrolyte solution at a near-neutral pH (7.3) with high selectivity and a turnover number for CO (TONCO) of 1949 ± 5 after 2 h controlled potential electrolysis at -1.09 V vs. SHE (~550 mV overpotential). In situ UV-visible spectroelectrochemical investigations alluded to a catalytic mechanism that involves non-rate-limiting CO2 binding to the doubly-reduced catalyst. Finally, the integration of the mesoTiO2|CoPcP assembly with a p-type silicon (Si) photoelectrode allowed the construction of a benchmark precious-metal-free molecular photocathode that achieves a TONCO of 939 ± 132 with 66% selectivity for CO (CO/H2 = 2) under fully aqueous condition. The electrocatalytic and photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity of CoPcP was compared to state-of-the-art synthetic and enzymatic CO2 reduction catalysts, demonstrating the excellent performance of CoPcP and its suitability for the integration in tandem PEC devices.</p>
        <p>The renewable conversion of CO2 and water to storable fuels and chemicals offers a promising route to a sustainable economy employing a closed carbon cycle. The reduction of CO2 can be powered by renewable electrical and solar energy in electrolysis and photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices, respectively. 1 However, the direct electroreduction of aqueous CO2 on heterogeneous electrodes suffers often from high overpotentials and low product selectivity, and PEC conversion from low photochemical quantum yield and limited solar-to-chemical conversion yields. 2 These drawbacks have inspired the development of molecularly-engineered hybrid materials that can benefit from a CO2-reducing molecular catalyst with performance advantages such as high selectivity, low overpotential, and tunability as well as high activity per catalytic center. [3][4][5][6][7][8][9] Hybrid photocathodes with molecular catalysts anchored on p-type semiconductors (SCs) and positioned at the electrode/electrolyte interface, allow the coupling to water oxidizing anodes without the need for sacrificial reagents and pave the way for unassisted operation during solar irradiation. While a number of such hybrid molecular photocathodes have already been developed for the reduction CO2, those operating under fully aqueous condition rely on either noble-metal-based catalysts [10][11][12][13][14][15] or large overpotentials, 16,17 and others require organic solvents with catalysts in solution. 18,19 Photocathodes with a buried p-n junction feature a small-bandgap p-type SC protected by a large-bandgap n-type SC layer. [20][21][22][23][24][25] The narrow-bandgap SC allows broad-band harvesting of solar light, and the protective overlayer prevents photocorrosion and provide a scaffold for attaching molecular co-catalysts. Early reports demonstrated CO production in organic solvents by TiO2-protected Cu2O photocathodes with a Recatalyst under strongly reducing conditions (-1.9 V vs. Fc +/0 ). 20,21 A TiO2-coated hematite photocathode that operates in water to produce CO and formate with FE CO+HCOO -&gt;90% was reported based on polymeric Ru complex catalysts. More recently, we reported a noble-metal-free photocathode consisting of a narrowbandgap (1.1 eV) p-type Si photoelectrode coated with mesoporous TiO2 (mesoTiO2) overlayer to protect Si from reacting with H2O and O2 to form of an insulating silica (SiOx) layer, and provide a high surface area to immobilize a phosphonated Co(bisterpyridine) catalyst. 25 The hybrid system operates with a low overpotential and good selectivity in organic/water mixtures, but performed poorly in purely aqueous electrolyte solution with a low Faradaic efficiency (FE) for CO2-products and a low turnover number (TON CO 2 ) of 21. 25 Very recently, a hybrid photocathode featuring a cobalt quaterpyridine catalyst immobilized on p-type Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) SC that generates CO with 97% selectivity and high current density in aqueous medium has been reproted. 24 As the molecular catalyst is a key component in the photocathodes generating C1 products at low overpotential, seeking other suitable catalysts/semiconductor assemblies to drive CO2 reduction catalysts is therefore desirable.</p>
        <p>Cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) has been studied for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction since the 1970s [26][27][28] and has attracted renewed attention over the past 5 years due to their excellent performance in water upon immobilization on carbon electrodes, [29][30][31][32][33][34] and reticular materials. 33,35 A state-of-the-art CoPc-based catalyst system features a positively charged CoPc complex adsorbed on multiwalled carbon nanotubes, which displays &gt;90% CO-selectivity with a partial current density of 18.1 mA cm -2 at a ~550 mV overpotential. 29 However, carbonaceous supports offer low optical transparency, limiting the application of these hybrid CoPc-electrodes in PEC systems and rendering spectroscopic studies for mechanistic investigations challenging. We have recently developed a polymeric-CoPc/carbon-nitride hybrid photocatalyst for light driven CO2 reduction in colloidal suspension, 36 but this system relied on a sacrificial electron donor and utilization of CoPc in PEC CO2 reduction has not yet been reported.</p>
        <p>Metal oxides (MOx) present a suitable electroactive platform for catalyst immobilization and PEC application as MOx materials offer transparency, tunable electronic properties and morphology, and affinity towards various functional groups including phosphonic acid, carboxylic acid and silatrane, that can be exploited for catalyst anchoring. [37][38][39][40][41][42][43] However, there are relatively few reports of noble-metal-free molecular CO2 reduction catalysts that are amenable towards immobilization on MOx surfaces and all of those feature phosphonic acid anchors: an Fe-porphyrin dimer, 41 a Coterpyridine, 25 a Mn-bipyridine tricarbonyl, 40 and the recently reported Coquaterpyridine. 24 Here, we aim to integrate CoPc catalyst into MOx scaffold to fabricate hybrid materials for PEC CO2 reduction in water. We prepared a novel cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPcP) catalyst bearing four flexible phosphonic acid anchors appended to the phthalocyanine macrocycle (Figure 1A), which allow immobilization of the catalyst on mesoporous MOx electrodes including indium tin oxide (mesoITO) and titanium dioxide (mesoTiO2).</p>
        <p>The resulting hybrid electrode assemblies (mesoITO|CoPcP and mesoTiO2|CoPcP) displayed a high loading of CoPcP and were studied electrochemically to demonstrate catalytic CO2 reduction in water and spectroelectrochemically to elucidate mechanistic details. The mesoTiO2|CoPcP assembly was then integrated on top of a Si photoelectrode to perform solar-driven CO evolution from CO2 under fully aqueous conditions.</p>
        <p>The phosphonated CO2 reduction catalyst CoPcP was synthesized in seven steps from the commercially available starting material 4-nitrophthalonitrile in an overall yield of ~2% (Supporting Information, Scheme S1). Zinc-templated cyclization of pmethoxybenzyl (PMB)-substituted phthalonitrile (1) yielded the symmetric tetrasubstituted Zn-phthalocyanine (2) with protected hydroxyl groups. Subsequent removal of the PMB group and demetallation produced tetra-hydroxylated free-base phthalocyanine (4), which was reacted with (3-bromopropyl)phosphonate to introduce the phosphonate surface anchoring moieties. Metalation of the resulting free-base phthalocyanine (5) and subsequent hydrolysis of the phosphonate esters yielded the target complex CoPcP, which was isolated and used as a mixture of regioisomers with identical electronic and steric properties. 44 The compounds were characterized by 1 H and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, infrared and electronic absorption spectroscopy and elemental analysis (Supporting Information, Experimental Details and Figure S1-S8). CoPcP was immobilized on FTO|mesoITO (fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)-supported mesoITO, 5.5 μm film thickness, ITO particle size &lt; 50 nm, geometric surface area 0.36 cm 2 ; Figure S9) by soaking the electrode in a sensitizing solution of the catalyst (0.2 mM in 2:3 DMSO/MeOH) followed by washing and drying in air. All potentials are reported against standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). As shown in Figure 1b ) of 24 ± 2 nmol cm -2 . The two Γ CoPcP values are in the expected range for metal complexes on nanostructured ITO surfaces, 46,47 and within error of one another, which indicates that all immobilized catalysts were electrochemically accessible (Table S1).</p>
        <p>CoPcP was anchored by the same immobilization protocol on Ti foil-supported mesoTiO2 electrodes 48 (Ti|mesoTiO2; 6.5 μm film thickness, TiO2 anatase particle size 15-20 nm, geometric surface area = 0.36 cm 2 , exposed surface area after epoxy encapsulation = 0.15-0.3 cm 2 ) to evaluate their CO2 reduction activity by controlled potential electrolysis (CPE). Ti|mesoTiO2 electrodes were selected over FTO|mesoITO as they display greater stability while maintaining conductivity at strongly reducing potentials. 49 was reduced by 20-25% to 18.6 and 17 nmol cm -2 after 2 h CPE at -0.99 and -1.09 V vs. SHE, respectively (Table S3), suggesting slow catalyst desorption under operating condition due to hydrolysis of the phosphonate ester linkage (CoPcP is partially soluble in KHCO3 electrolyte solution). Isotopic labelling experiments conducted in a 13 CO2-saturated NaH 13 CO3 solution confirmed formation of 13 CO (Figure S16b). Unmodified Ti|mesoTiO2 electrode produced only a small amount of H2 under identical condition (1.28 μmol H2 after 2 h CPE at -1.09 V vs. SHE; Figure S17).</p>
        <p>The catalytic activity of CoPcP was subsequently compared with two other wellestablished 3d metal-based molecular catalysts, MnP [MnBr(4,4'-bis(phosphonic acid)-2,2'-bipyridine)(CO)3] 40 and CoPolyPc (polymeric Co-phthalocyanine) 32 (Scheme S2), and a biocatalyst, isolated W-formate dehydrogenase from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (FDH), 52,53 using mesoTiO2 support under fully aqueous condition. FDH was selected as a model enzyme to demonstrate the inherent advantages of the natural system, such as high selectivity and energy efficiency, and to highlight its drawbacks including limited stability and scalability as well as a large catalyst footprint. The procedure for immobilizing MnP, CoPolyPc and FDH is described in the Supporting Information.</p>
        <p>CPE of Ti|mesoTiO2|MnP at -0.99 and -1.09 V vs. SHE produced CO with FE CO of 62% and 39%, corresponding to TON CO of 404 and 276, respectively ( Γ MnP ICP = 49.6 nmol cm -2 ; Figure S18 and Table S2). Unexpectedly, Ti|mesoTiO2|CoPolyPc primarily catalyzed H2 evolution with a low CO-selectivity of &lt;5% (Figure S19), even though CoPolyPc has been demonstrated to be an excellent CO2 reduction electrocatalyst when deposited on carbon-nanotubes and possesses an identical Co-phthalocyanine core to that of CoPcP. The stark contrast in CO2 reduction activity between CoPcP and CoPolyPc could be the flexible phosphonate anchors of CoPcP, which provide a distinct molecule-electrode interface. 36 In comparison, the enzyme assembly, mesoTiO2|FDH, has been previously reported to display an excellent selectivity towards electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate with a high TON of ~17,000 and a FE of (92±5)% after 2 h CPE at -0.6 V vs. SHE. 54 While the enzyme offered high selectivity with little overpotential requirement, 54 the current density delivered by mesoTiO2|FDH was only ~90 μA cm -2 which is considerably lower than that for CoPcP and MnP. Nevertheless, it should be noted that a much smaller amount of FDH ( 43pmol) was employed due to the large footprint of the enzyme and the CPE was conducted at a less negative potential (E app = -0.6 V vs. SHE). Overall, the performance for CoPcP (TON CO = 1949 and FE CO = 78% after 2 h) compares favorably to the two molecular catalysts described here, MnP and CoPolyPc, and other previously reported molecular catalyst-metal oxide hybrids, including a Feporphyrin-based metal-organic framework (TON CO = 1400 and FE CO = 40% after 7 h), 55 a Fe-porphyrin dimer deposited on FTO/SnO2 (TOF CO = 20 s -1 and FE CO = 70%) 41 and a Co-quaterpyridine complex anchored on TiO2 (TON CO = 1000 and FE CO = 63% after 2 h). The Ti|mesoTiO2|CoPcP assembly turns over at a slower rate (TOF CO = 0.27 s -1 at -1.09 V vs. SHE) compared to other CoPc systems supported on carbon-based electrodes (Table S4), which could be due to slow electron transport across the metal-oxide/CoPcP interface as indicated by the peak-to-peak splitting in the CVs at slow scan rate.</p>
        <p>To gain kinetic information about CO2 reduction on Ti|mesoTiO2|CoPcP, Tafel analysis was performed by plotting the partial current density for CO (j CO ) during CPE on a logarithmic scale (log |j CO |) versus the thermodynamic overpotential (η). A Tafel slope of 145 mV dec -1 was obtained in the low-overpotential region (Figure 2f).</p>
        <p>Although this value is close to the theoretical value of 118 mV dec -1 expected for a rate-limiting initial single electron transfer step, 56 there are other key factors, including CO2 adsorption, CO desorption and mass-transport limitation in porous scaffold, that likely exert substantial influence on the Tafel slope of the reaction. For comparison, earlier studies on immobilized phthalocyanine have reported Tafel slopes ranging from 100-300 mV dec -1 , [57][58][59][60] suggesting that it may depend on more than just the active site itself. As a result, mechanistic interpretation and the exact nature of the ratelimiting step is difficult to determine from the Tafel slope alone.</p>
        <p>In situ UV-vis spectroelectrochemistry (SEC) under N2 and CO2 was used to study the potential-dependent features of CoPcP at a molecular level. A typical spectrum of assynthesized Co II PcP immobilized on ITO and TiO2 in open-circuit states featured two absorptions at 678 and 626 nm in the Q-band range, attributed to the monomer and the aggregate, respectively (Figure 3 and S20). 61 The mesoITO|CoPcP electrode displays well-separated reduction waves and electrochromic behavior with a change of color from blue to green and dark yellow during CVs (Supporting video S1). The UV-vis spectrum was recorded at -0. A mesoporous TiO2 scaffold was employed for probing the SEC response of CoPcP under operating condition due to its greater stability at strongly reductive potentials.</p>
        <p>Potential-dependent evolution of the UV-vis spectrum of FTO|mesoTiO2|CoPcP was nearly identical to that observed for mesoITO electrode; CoPcP was fully reduced to is consumed under CO2 saturated condition as E app &lt; -0.79 V vs. SHE, as demonstrated by the bleach of the bands at 439 and 717 nm (Figure 3b). This establishes that [CoPcP] 2-is not the steady state species during catalysis and a third reduction step occurs at strongly reducing potentials only in the presence of CO2. The SEC results fits well with the CPE data, which show that H2 remains the major product until E app = -0.79 V and CO2 reduction becomes dominant at more negative potentials.</p>
        <p>The exact mechanism for CO2 reduction by cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) remains a subject of debate in the community. 30,58,64,65 Considering that CoPcP displays an onset for CO2 reduction at a more negative potential than the second reduction and that</p>
        <p>[CoPcP] 2-is quickly depleted under operating condition, we propose that aqueous CO2 reduction by immobilized CoPcP follows a different pathway to that previously suggested for hybrid-CoPc electrodes. 30,58,66 In particular, the catalytic mechanism of Si|mesoTiO2 electrode, respectively, but a higher photocurrent response in the presence of CoPcP (Figure 4a). This result agrees with previous studies that the Si|mesoTiO2 photoelectrodes act like a buried junction, controlled by the p-n Si-mesoTiO2 interface, and deliver a photovoltage of 550-600 mV. [67][68][69] Controlled potential photoelectrolysis (CPPE) in aqueous electrolyte solution (0.5 M KHCO3, pH 7. with a total FE of (85 ± 2)% (FE CO = (56 ± 4)%) and a total TON CO+H 2 of 1430 ± 150</p>
        <p>(TON CO = 939 ± 132). A stable photocurrent of approximately -150 μA cm -2 was observed with CO selectivity at (66 ± 3)% (CO:H2 = 1.9 ± 0.3) (Figure 4b). Continuous monitoring of the headspace gas shows an initial (0-4 h) increase of turnover frequency for CO production (TOF CO , h -1 ) which plateaus to a steady rate of ~70 h -1 , implying a stable photocathode assembly (Figure 4c). The early increase could be attributed to the reduction of O2 trapped in mesoTiO2 and slow release of CO and H2 from the mesoporous scaffold which is supported by the observed increase in total FE over time (Figure S22). Post-CPPE UV-vis spectroscopy of desorbed CoPcP confirms that the molecular structure of CoPcP remains intact but shows a loss of ~20% immobilized catalyst over 12 h (Figure S12b and Table S3). Nonetheless, the photocathode assembly maintains a constant activity over several hours operating at near thermodynamic potential for CO2-to-CO conversion (E CO 2 /CO 0' = -0.54 V vs. SHE).</p>
        <p>To demonstrate the versatility of the Si|mesoTiO2 platform and evaluate the PEC activity of CoPcP, CPPE was conducted with two analogous PEC systems that featured the synthetic molecular catalyst MnP, 40 and the enzyme, FDH, immobilized on Si|mesoTiO2 (Table S5). A long pass cut-off filter (λ &gt; 590 nm) was employed for CPPE of Si|mesoTiO2|MnP to circumvent the photosensitivity of the catalyst, whereas a standard UV-cut-off filter (λ &gt; 400 nm) was used for Si|mesoTiO2|FDH. CoPcP (TON CO = 939 after 12 h) compared favorably to MnP (TON CO = 342 after 12 h), with both showing a similar CO selectivity (60-66%) and MnP displaying a steady decrease in photocurrent over time (Figure S23). However, it is worth noting that despite the lower energy and intensity of the filtered light (λ &gt; 590 nm), MnP performs efficiently with high TON CO and CO-selectivity. FDH has been demonstrated previously to anchor strongly on metal-oxide surfaces (ITO and TiO2), and the hybrid FDHbioelectrodes to catalyze the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate with high efficiency through fast, direct interfacial electron transfer. 54,70 FDH (160 pmol) was drop-coated on Si|mesoTiO2 under inert atmosphere to construct Si|mesoTiO2|FDH, which displays a stable photocurrent of approximately -70 μA cm -2 , yielding formate as the sole product (FE = 99%) and a TON HCOO --of ~14500 (Figure S23 and Table S5). Although the FDH-photocathode exhibits the highest selectivity towards CO2 reduction among the three catalysts, the large footprint of FDH limits the amount of enzyme that can be loaded on the Si|mesoTiO2 scaffold, resulting in a lower photocurrent compared to CoPcP and MnP. This highlights the need for macromolecule-accommodating mesoporous and macroporous substrates for the development of bio-hybrid systems. 68,71 Previously reported molecular photocathodes for aqueous CO2 reduction commonly employed noble-metal-based co-catalysts, 11,[13][14][15]21,22 whereas precious-metal-free photocathodes required organic solvents or mixed organic-aqueous medium to achieve selective CO2 reduction. 18,19,25 The Si|mesoTiO2|CoPcP electrode catalyzes PEC CO2-to-CO reduction in purely aqueous solution with 56% FE CO , displaying a photocurrent of -150 μA cm -2 and achieving a TON CO as high as 939 after 12 h. This outperforms almost all of the previously studied molecular photocathodes including both earth-abundant and noble-metal-based systems (Table S6), and is only outperformed by the recently reported benchmark Co-quaterpyridine/CIGS photocathode (CIGS|f-TiO2|Co-qPyH) that displays a photocurrent of -800 μA cm -2 , a TON CO of 8031, and a FE CO of 87% after 2 h. 24 Interestingly, the catalyst metrics (current density, TON and selectivity) displayed by Si|mesoTiO2|CoPcP photoelectrode during CPPE at -0.53 V vs. SHE are matched by Ti|mesoTiO2|CoPcP electrode when CPE is conducted at -0.89 V vs. SHE (Figure S24, Table S2 andS5). The slightly lower CO evolution rate displayed by Si|mesoTiO2|CoPcP could be due to the intense absorption of the immobilized CoPcP in the visible region which lowers the amount of light reaching Si.</p>
        <p>In summary, we introduce CoPcP as a versatile phthalocyanine-based molecular CO2reduction catalyst that allows for robust immobilization on metal-oxide surfaces with its four phosphonic acid anchoring groups. reduction is considered, Si|mesoTiO2|CoPcP displays a lower activity than a CIGS|f-TiO2|Co-qPyH photocathode. 24 This suggests scope for further improvement of our system by combining CoPcP with other light absorbing materials. However, it should be noted that Si has the added benefits of low cost and scalability compared to CIGS, which is not yet technologically and commercially ready for large-scale deployment.</p>
        <p>Overall, this work presents a rare example of a precious-metal-free metal-oxide based hybrid (photo)electrode for aqueous CO2 reduction, and paves the way for future development of tandem PEC devices featuring CO2-reducing photocathodes paired with suitable photoanodes.</p>
        <p>A novel cobalt phthalocyanine catalyst with four phosphonic acid anchors forms a functional CO2 reduction catalyst upon immobilization on porous metal oxides. The resulting hybrid molecular electrodes enable aqueous CO2 reduction to CO with high selectivity driven by electricity and, upon integration onto p-silicon, by solar energy.</p>

        <p>. Formation of CO was detected at an applied potential (E app ) as positive as -0.79 V vs. SHE (j CO ~10 μA cm -2 ), corresponding to an overpotential (η) of 250 mV (E CO 2 /CO 0' = -0.54 V vs. SHE at pH 7.3).</p>
        <p>51</p>
        <p>However, the selectivity for CO (defined as, ×100%) at this E app was only (20.7±0.5)%. The current density increased with more reducing potentials and the catalyst displayed a higher selectivity towards CO (Figure</p>

        <p>-e and S15). A maximum CO selectivity of (85 ± 2)% (CO:H2 = 5.8 ± 1.0) was reached at E app = -1.09 V vs. SHE (j CO ~ -1.3 mA cm - 2 ). CPE for 2 h at this potential generated 44.8 ± 0.1 μmol CO cm -2 and 7.8 ± 1.3 μmol H2 cm -2 with a total Faradaic efficiency (FE CO+H 2 ) of (91±3)%, corresponding to a turnover number of 1949 ± 5 for CO (</p>
