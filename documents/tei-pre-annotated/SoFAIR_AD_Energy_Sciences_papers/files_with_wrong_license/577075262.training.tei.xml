        <p>Electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction powered by renewable electricity has been considered as a promising approach for sustainable energy storage and chemicals production. Herein, ultrathin few-layer SnO 2 nanosheets exposed with (001) facets were synthesized and exhibited a rather broad potential window (0.8 V) for selective CO 2 conversion to formate. Both DFT calculations and operando spectroscopic characterizations were carried out to identify key intermediate *OCHO. Systematically tailoring microenvironment in the catalyst layer of gas diffusion electrode (GDE) indicate that both flexible Nafion and solid polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) nanoparticles are essential to create abundant and robust triple-phase boundaries (TPB) with more active sites, where CO 2 and H 2 O meet at nanosheet surface to output a high formate partial current density of 380 mA⋅cm -2 with the selectivity of 88.4%. Moreover, such novel Nafion/PTFE/SnO 2 TPB porous structures above largely enhance the single-pass carbon efficiency up to 29.3% in 1 M KOH. This study implies that engineering TPB active sites is an effective approach to the design of advanced CO 2 electrolyzers.Electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction powered by renewable electricity has been considered as a promising approach for sustainable energy storage and chemicals production.

        <p>Electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) has been considered as an attractive carbon neutrality technology [1][2][3][4]. Among the multiple reduction products, formic acid has been widely used in leather, pharmacy, feed additives industry, and also identified as a promising hydrogen storage carrier [5] and fuel for direct formic acid fuel cell (DFAFC) [6]. Techno-economic analysis also reveals that the two electron transferred product formate is one desirable product [7]. Tin-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for CO 2 conversion to formate due to its earth-abundance and environmental benign feature [8]. However, although several modification strategies have been adopted [9][10][11][12][13], most of tin-based catalysts still suffer from narrow electrochemical window for highly efficient formate production [14][15][16]. Two-dimensional (2D) materials have drawn much attention owing to the large surface area, excellent electron transfer ability and abundant undercoordinated sites [17][18][19][20][21]. Our recent study has revealed that tin oxides with high-energy facets can break the inherent scaling relationships between *OCHO and *HCOOH [22]. Therefore, 2D SnO 2 nanosheets with high-energy facets are expected to promote CO 2 RR to formate.Electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) has been considered as an attractive carbon neutrality technology [1][2][3][4].

        <p>While many efforts are currently focused on developing catalytic materials for CO 2 RR, it is equally critical to optimize the local environment within the catalysts, which can mediate the transport and local concentration of CO 2 and influence reaction rates. For industrial application, CO 2 RR is required to achieve the minimum current density of 200 mA⋅cm -2 [23]. Gas diffusion electrodes (GED) provide an effective solution to this target [24]. Reactions proceed at gas (CO 2 )-liquid (H 2 O)-solid (Catalyst) triple-phase boundaries (TPB), where CO 2 could be effectively coupled with electrons and protons to produce chemicals and fuels [24,25]. Thus, how to delicately construct TPB active sites become pivotal for efficient CO 2 RR. Typically, GDE usually composes of a gas diffusion layer (GDL), a microporous layer (MPL) and a catalyst layer (CL). The catalysts layer (CL) in GDE is usually immersed in electrolyte owing to the hydrophilicity of the catalysts, resulting in that TPB sites are only formed at the interface between CL and MPL. Thus, how to increase the TPB active sites plays a key role in effective CO 2 RR. Nevertheless, there have been few reports on catalysts layer design and optimization [26,27].While many efforts are currently focused on developing catalytic materials for CO 2 RR, it is equally critical to optimize the local environment within the catalysts, which can mediate the transport and local concentration of CO 2 and influence reaction rates.

        <p>Hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene nanoparticles (PTFE NPs) are usually employed to tune the wetting properties of CL. However, excess PTFE will block the H 2 O access to the catalyst surface and thus suppress CO 2 reduction. Recently, flexible polymers have been employed to modify the microenvironment of CL in GDE [28][29][30]. Sargent et al. reported that Nafion with hydrophobic -CF 2 backbone and hydrophilic -SO 3 group could decouple the transport of gas, ions and electrons [31].Hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene nanoparticles (PTFE NPs) are usually employed to tune the wetting properties of CL.

        <p>Chanyeon Kim et al. modified the electrode using bilayer ionomers to improve the local pH and CO 2 concentration [32]. Ionomers are kind of polymers widely used in catalyst layers in gas diffusion electrodes. Due to the unique characteristics, they could be used as both binder and ion transfer carrier. Indeed, many factors could affect the catalyst aggregation, such as ionomer content, wettability or other properties [33,34]. All those factors should be taken into consideration when using ionomer as a binder. Appropriate ionomers are required to coat the catalyst particles and ensure catalyst dispersion. However, during long-term electrolysis process the flexible ionomers are not stable and tend to enter into aqueous electrolyte and thus cause catalysts aggregation.Chanyeon Kim et al. modified the electrode using bilayer ionomers to improve the local pH and CO 2 concentration [32].

        <p>Herein, ultrathin 2D nanosheets exposed with (001) high-energy facets were prepared and exhibited a wide electrochemical window (800 mV) in flow cell for highly efficient formate production, which could be a result of numerous undercoordinated tin sites [22,35]. Moreover, both hydrophobic Nafion ionomer and PTFE NPs were employed to construct stable TPB active sites. Due to the synergistic effect of flexible ionomer layer and solid PTFE NPs, more catalysts/ionomer/PTFE junctions (CIPJ) are formed to offer more TPB sites, which results in enhanced formate production rate.Herein, ultrathin 2D nanosheets exposed with (001) high-energy facets were prepared and exhibited a wide electrochemical window (800 mV) in flow cell for highly efficient formate production, which could be a result of numerous undercoordinated tin sites [22,35].

        <p>Ultrathin SnO 2 NSs were prepared by a facile solvothermal method through decomposition of Sn 6 O 4 (OH) 4 and 3D-to-2D transformation (Fig. S1) [36]. Spherical SnO 2 NPs were also synthesized for comparison [22]. The structure and morphology were firstly characterized by polycrystalline powder X-ray diffraction and electron microscope. Four strong diffraction peaks (Fig. 1a) located at 26.6 • , 33.9 • , 37.9 • , 51.8 • can be indexed to the (110), (101), ( 200) and (211) planes of the tetragonal rutile phase of SnO 2 (JCPDS # 41-1445). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Fig. 1b) reveals the free-standing nanosheet structure and is almost transparent to the electron beam. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) (Fig. 1c) reveals two lattice fringes with D-spacing of 0.338 nm are perpendicular to each other, corresponding to (110) and (110) plane of SnO 2 , respectively. Meanwhile, the angle labeled in the HR-TEM is 90 • , which is in agreement with the theoretical value of the angle between the (110) and (110) planes. Corresponding Fast Fourier Transform image (inset of Fig. 1c) shows the (110), (200) (110) diffraction spots of tetragonal SnO 2 along [001] zone axis and demonstrate the single-crystalline nature. Therefore, according to the symmetry of tetragonal system, the surfaces of NSs are dominantly exposed with (001) planes and only a small percentage of lateral surfaces are (110) facets [35]. In contrast, spherical SnO 2 particles show average size of 5.5 nm with the mainly exposed (110) facets (Fig. S2).Ultrathin SnO 2 NSs were prepared by a facile solvothermal method through decomposition of Sn 6 O 4 (OH) 4 and 3D-to-2D transformation (Fig. S1) [36].

        <p>Aberration corrected high angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-HAADF-STEM) image (Fig. 1d) reveals the atomic arrangement from [001] zone axis direction, where clear (200) lattice with a D-spacing of 0.236 nm can be observed. In addition, the edge is comprised of stepped sites, which are reported to be able to stabilize the *OCHO intermediate for formate production [37]. The surface Sn atoms are undercoordinated (4-fold), where more defective sites are exposed [35]. Atom force microscope (AFM) image (Fig. 1e) confirm the ultrathin feature of the nanosheets (1.9 nm). In addition, the higher surface energy of (001) facet 2.36 J⋅m -2 in comparison to (110) facet (1.40 J⋅m -2 ) [35] imply SnO 2 NSs are expected to exhibit high activity for electrochemical CO 2 reduction [22].Aberration corrected high angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-HAADF-STEM) image (Fig. 1d) reveals the atomic arrangement from [001] zone axis direction, where clear (200) lattice with a D-spacing of 0.236 nm can be observed.

        <p>The as-synthesized catalysts were performed in H-cell with 0.1 M CO 2 -saturated KHCO 3 as electrolyte to evaluate the catalytic behavior. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves (Fig. S3a) indicate higher reduction current of SnO 2 nanosheets for CO 2 RR compared to the spherical one. Controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) experiments (Fig. 1f) demonstrate higher faradaic efficiency (FE formate ) and partial current density (J formate ) of formate (Fig. S3b) within nearly all the investigated potential range. In particular, it displays a ~400 mV potential window with &gt; 80% selectivity of formate, while the SnO 2 NPs only show a peak formate selectivity (~80%) at 1.35 V vs. RHE.The as-synthesized catalysts were performed in H-cell with 0.1 M CO 2 -saturated KHCO 3 as electrolyte to evaluate the catalytic behavior.

        <p>Electrochemical active surface areas (ECSA) normalize current densities were estimated to investigate the intrinsic activity (see Figs. S4a-4b for detail). SnO 2 NPs show larger double-layer capacitance (Fig. 1g) corresponding higher ECSA due to the smaller grain size. However, SnO 2 nanosheets exhibit an enhanced ECSA-normalized J formate (Fig. 1h) 3 times higher than SnO 2 nanoparticles at -1.45 V vs. RHE, indicating an outstanding intrinsic catalytic activity. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also performed to evaluate charge transfer resistance (Fig. S5 and Table S1). The Nyquist curves (Fig. 1i) reveal that SnO 2 (001) NSs possess smaller electron transfer resistance, which is consistent with the LSV and CPE results.Electrochemical active surface areas (ECSA) normalize current densities were estimated to investigate the intrinsic activity (see Figs.

        <p>Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were then employed to reveal the underlying reasons for remarkable formate production ability over SnO 2 (001) NSs. As shown in Fig. 2a, the calculated free-energy (ΔG) of *OCHO (1.07 eV) is downhill with respect to the *COOH (1.86 eV) species, indicating the CO 2 to HCOOH pathway is mostly dominant, which is consistent with our experimental observation. Moreover, undesirable HER is also suppressed on SnO 2 (001) due to the relatively higher energy barrier of H* (1.39 eV). The ΔG on SnO 2 (001) for *OCHO formation shown in Fig. 2b is smaller than (110) facet of SnO 2 and demonstrates that *OCHO intermediate is more easily stabilized on SnO 2 nanosheets.Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were then employed to reveal the underlying reasons for remarkable formate production ability over SnO 2 (001) NSs.

        <p>In situ spectroscopic characterizations are powerful tools to monitor the intermediate adsorbates [38,39]. In situ attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectra (ATR-FTIR) (Fig. 2c) show broad bands at ~1260 cm -1 , which can be assigned to the C-H vibrational peaks of *OCHO or *HCOO -species [40]. The signal increase towards the negative shift of potential demonstrates the accelerated formate formation. Weak peaks at ~1376 and ~1722 cm -1 can be assigned to the characteristic peaks of monodentate m-HCOO -, the relative weak signal may be due to the rapid desorption of HCOOH [41]. The peaks at ~1443 cm -1 can be attributed to chemisorbed HCO 3 -, suggesting the formation of formate involves the adsorption of HCO 3 -. Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that adsorbed HCO 3 -provide proton during the formate formation [42]. Broad peaks at 1633 cm -1 are the water vibrational peaks [43], which is confirmed by our control experiments (Fig. S6a). We have conducted in situ ATR-FTIR spectra at higher wavenumber range to monitor the HCOO -species. As shown in Fig. S6b, a weak peak at ~2982 cm -1 was observed, which may originate from the quick desorption of *HCOOH species [44].In situ spectroscopic characterizations are powerful tools to monitor the intermediate adsorbates [38,39].

        <p>Operando Raman spectroscopy (Fig. S7) show the characteristic peaks of SnO 2 at 485, 600, and 796 cm -1 . Under the reductive potentials, SnO 2 was found to be reduced slowly, which was evidenced by the gradual weakened SnO 2 peaks with the increasement of bias from Fig. S7. Thus, the actual active sites are likely to be reduced tin oxide nanosheets. Broad bands at 1070 cm -1 are chemisorbed CO 3 2-, which is formed by consuming one proton from HCO 3 -. Peaks at 1268 cm -1 and 1420 cm -1 , 1480 cm -1 can be indexed to the deformation vibration of C-H and stretching vibration of O-(CH)-O of *OCHO species [40], respectively, which is a key descriptor for formate generation.Operando Raman spectroscopy (Fig. S7) show the characteristic peaks of SnO 2 at 485, 600, and 796 cm -1 .

        <p>Based on the DFT and in situ characterization results above, a possible reaction path was proposed (Fig. 2e): ⋅-species then accept a proton from the absorbed HCO 3 -and form relatively stable *OCHO species. Since bicarbonate has smaller pKa (10.33) than water (15.7), it dissociates more easily and serves as a proton donor thermodynamically in aqueous CO 2 RR [45,46]. Finally, the *OCHO species obtain one electron plus one proton to form *HCOOH and desorb into the electrolyte.Based on the DFT and in situ characterization results above, a possible reaction path was proposed (Fig. 2e): ⋅-species then accept a proton from the absorbed HCO 3 -and form relatively stable *OCHO species.

        <p>In the H-cell used above, the slow transport rate with low solubility (~34 mM) of CO 2 in aqueous solution limits current densities. To address this issue, gas diffusion electrodes (GDE) are employed to significantly enhance CO 2 transport and thus largely boost CO 2 reaction rate by a factor of 10-100. In GDE, CO 2 RR proceeds at gas(CO 2 )-liquid (H 2 O)-solid(Catalyst) triple-phase boundaries (TPB), where CO 2 molecules combine with protons and electrons to form chemicals and fuels. To increase TPB active sites in catalyst layer of GDE, three ionomers were used in catalyst layer and evaluated in a flow cell. Obviously, the electrode with Nafion added show the highest selectivity and current density of formate (Figs. 3a-3b).In the H-cell used above, the slow transport rate with low solubility (~34 mM) of CO 2 in aqueous solution limits current densities.

        <p>It has been reported that Nafion is a hydrophobic ionomer while Fuma and Sustainion XA-9 are hydrophilic due to their strong polar group [47]. To verify the wetting properties of electrodes, contact angle (CA) experiments (Figs. 3c-3e) were conducted to confirm that Fuma and XA-9 ionomers coated electrode are hydrophilic (CA&lt;90 • ) while the one Nafion coated is hydrophobic (CA&gt;90 • ). Standard porosimetry (MSP) has been further employed to determine the distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic pores [48]. Water vapor adsorption results using the MSP method (Fig. 3f) show a smaller water adsorption capacity of Nafion 115 (Nafion) than Sustainion membrane (XA-9). This implies more hydrophobic pores existing in the former, which help create more TPB active sites.It has been reported that Nafion is a hydrophobic ionomer while Fuma and Sustainion XA-9 are hydrophilic due to their strong polar group [47].

        <p>Well-constructed TPBs require the participation of electrons, protons and gaseous CO 2 . When hydrophilic ionomers are used in the catalyst layer, water is readily accessible to the catalyst surface but blocks CO 2 transport channels, and decrease TPB active sites. The gas product analysis (Figs. 3g-3h) indicates that the added hydrophilic ionomers induce severe HER. In contrast, when the hydrophobic Nafion was added, the amount of TPBs will be greatly improved, which enhances CO 2 RR for efficient formate generation.Well-constructed TPBs require the participation of electrons, protons and gaseous CO 2 .

        <p>The coating amount of Nafion on CO 2 RR was also investigated (Figs. S8-S9). Unexpectedly, the increase in Nafion suppresses formate formation and promotes HER. The contact angle tests show an upward trend towards the increase in Nafion content, indicating the enhancement of hydrophobicity (Fig. S10). Previous study proved that the thick ionomer layer could slow down the mass transfer and diffusion of gaseous reactants [49]. Thus, excessive Nafion could suppress the diffusion of CO 2 molecule to the active sites and thus CO 2 RR rates. Moreover, a more acidic local environment was created when a thick Nafion layer was coated on catalyst surface, which also accelerated the HER rate. In addition, no obvious difference for electrode surface was observed (Fig. S9) since small amount of Nafion added. Thus, other factors such as increased CL thickness and Nafion agglomeration are unlikely to cause for the increased HER. Indeed catalyst layer with a partial wetted surface is an ideal state to sustain efficient CO 2 RR [50]. In our study, moderate Nafion coating is pivotal to create such a partial wetted microenvironment in catalyst layer.The coating amount of Nafion on CO 2 RR was also investigated (Figs. S8-S9). Unexpectedly, the increase in Nafion suppresses formate formation and promotes HER. The contact angle tests show an upward trend towards the increase in Nafion content, indicating the enhancement of hydrophobicity (Fig. S10). Previous study proved that the thick ionomer layer could slow down the mass transfer and diffusion of gaseous reactants [49]. Thus, excessive Nafion could suppress the diffusion of CO 2 molecule to the active sites and thus CO 2 RR rates. Moreover, a more acidic local environment was created when a thick Nafion layer was coated on catalyst surface, which also accelerated the HER rate. In addition, no obvious difference for electrode surface was observed (Fig. S9) since small amount of Nafion added. Thus, other factors such as increased CL thickness and Nafion agglomeration are unlikely to cause for the increased HER. Indeed catalyst layer with a partial wetted surface is an ideal state to sustain efficient CO 2 RR [50].

        <p>The electrode with nonionic hydrophobic polymerpolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) added almost shows comparable CO 2 RR performance with respect to that with Nafion (Fig. 3i and Fig. S11). PDMS is a kind of nonionic hydrophobic polymer and no polar group exists in the molecular backbone, while Nafion has both hydrophobic -CF 2 backbone and -SO 3 group for proton transfer. Nafion has higher ionic conductivity and superior formate partial current densities as shown in Fig. S10. In catalyst layer, hydrophobic PTFE particles and hydrophilic sulfonic acid groups of Nafion form a phase-separated structure that provides remarkable cation conduction (H + and K + ) [49]. According to the studies by Koper [51] et al., cations could help stabilize the intermediates and thus CO 2 RR rates. The surface morphology of the electrode (Figs. S12-S16) shows no observable difference thus the morphology effect on CO 2 RR is negligible.The electrode with nonionic hydrophobic polymerpolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) added almost shows comparable CO 2 RR performance with respect to that with Nafion (Fig. 3i and Fig. S11).

        <p>SnO 2 nanosheets with moderate Nafion coating in catalyst later was further tested in a flow cell within a wide potential range to evaluate the industrial application feasibility. A rather wide potential window (800 mV) was observed along with the formate selectivity of &gt; 80% (Fig. 4a). The outstanding formate production ability could be attributed to a combination of exposed high-energy facets and larger interfaces between nanosheet and carbon conductor [52].SnO 2 nanosheets with moderate Nafion coating in catalyst later was further tested in a flow cell within a wide potential range to evaluate the industrial application feasibility.

        <p>Hydrophobic solid PTFE NPs were also utilized to enhance CO 2 transport [53]. The adding amount of PTFE NPs in the catalyst layer was firstly tuned to achieve optimal CO 2 RR performance. As presented in Fig. S17, moderate amount of PTFE added is favored for highly efficient formate production while excessive PTFE will influence the wettability of catalyst and the availability of protons from electrolyte thus decreasing the CO 2 RR performance, which shows great agreement with the literature reports [54,55]. In addition, excessive PTFE could also result in larger resistance and slow down electron transfer. Investigations were conducted to elucidate the effect of Nafion and PTFE in TPB active sites for CO 2 RR (Fig. S18). Notably, the addition of PTFE NPs greatly enlarges the current density due to more gas channels created. Besides, SnO 2 NSs with both Nafion and PTFE NPs coatings (SnO 2 NSs-NP) exhibit the highest J formate (Fig. 4b). In particular, the J formate for SnO 2 NSs-NP reaches 380 mA⋅cm -2 at -1.4 V vs. RHE, which is 1.46 times that of SnO 2 NSs with Nafion coating only (SnO 2 NSs-N) and comparable to the best result in literature (Table S3). In contrast, SnO 2 NSs with PTFE coating only (SnO 2 NSs-P) show poor CO 2 RR performance due to lack of access to protons.Hydrophobic solid PTFE NPs were also utilized to enhance CO 2 transport [53].

        <p>EIS was further employed to investigate the effect of Nafion and PFTE in CL in a flow cell (Fig. 4c) [56]. The first and second semicircle in the Nyquist curves represent the electron transfer impedance (R ct ) and gas diffusion impedance (Z d ), respectively [54]. Comparing with SnO 2 NSs-N, SnO 2 NSs-NP show smaller R ct and Z d , mainly attributed to the enhancement of electron transfer and shorten of the diffusion distance of CO 2 . Thus, Nafion and PTFE are synergistic to construct effective TPB active sites, where Nafion favors protons transfer and PTFE helps create effective CO 2 diffusion channels. As shown in the proposed model (Fig. 4d), with the assistance of Nafion and PTFE, large quantities of catalysts/ionomer/PTFE junctions (CIPJ) are formed to greatly increase TPB active sites reflected by larger J formate . In contrast, when PTFE is absent, TPB active sites will be suppressed owing to the undesirable electrowetting. While the lack of ionomer will influence the protons transfer and also decrease the amount of TPB sites.EIS was further employed to investigate the effect of Nafion and PFTE in CL in a flow cell (Fig. 4c) [56].

        <p>The synthesized SnO 2 NPs were also assessed for comparison (Fig. S19) and it exhibits poor formate production ability, mainly due to its inferior intrinsic activity and coincides well with H-cell results. Notably, SnO 2 NSs exhibit a current density of 400 mA⋅cm -2 with 88.4% FE formate at -1.4 V vs. RHE, which is 3.2 times that of SnO 2 NPs at the same conditions (Fig. 4e). Flake structures of SnO 2 nanosheets guarantee more chances to contact with both carbon black and PTFE NPs than SnO 2 nanoparticles, which creates more catalysts/ionomer/PTFE junctions to offer more TPB (Fig. S20), which could be accountable for the outstanding catalytic performance of SnO 2 NSs. Thus, large quantities of TPB arising from ultrathin SnO 2 flake structure play a critical role in highly CO 2 conversion to formate. Moreover, to mitigate the severe flooding issue [57], both PTFE NPs and graphitized carbon black was added to CL, which increases electrode hydrophobicity confirmed by contact angle tests (Fig. S21). Furthermore, we coated a porous PTFE membrane on the backside of GDE through a hot-pressed method developed in our previous work [22]. As shown in Fig. S22, partial PTFE was entered into pores of the gas diffusion layer (carbon fiber) and enhanced the latter's hydrophobicity. Aqueous electrolytes could penetrate a traditional GDE upon a high current density applied, and liquid drops were observed on the backside during the electrolysis process. In contrast, the penetrated electrolyte will be blocked by super-hydrophobic PTFE added and pushed back to the flowing bulk electrolyte. Thus, our upgraded GDE will sustain a long-term operation stability.The synthesized SnO 2 NPs were also assessed for comparison (Fig. S19) and it exhibits poor formate production ability, mainly due to its inferior intrinsic activity and coincides well with H-cell results.

        <p>The durability test results (Fig. 4f) display a stable current density of 260 mA⋅cm -2 and ~80% formate Faradaic efficiency. We changed the catholyte after 12 h during the test process, and continued the test. This system could maintain a 24 h stability with a slight decay of formate Faradaic efficiency (less than 10%) shown in Fig. 4f. In alkaline electrolytes, CO 2 reacts with OH -to form carbonate and thus greatly reduces the carbon utilization [58]. Herein, single-pass carbon efficiency (SPCE) was employed to evaluate the carbon utilization efficiency in our novel GDE [59]. As the decrease in CO 2 flow rate, the SPCE increases sharply to 29.3% at a rate of 5 sccm with over 80% FE formate and current density of &gt; 200 mA⋅cm -2 , outperforming the recently reported results (Fig. 4g, Fig. S23, and Table S4). The remarkable SPCE could be attributed to the increased TPB sites in CL, which minimize the loss of CO 2 consumed by the alkaline electrolyte.The durability test results (Fig. 4f) display a stable current density of 260 mA⋅cm -2 and ~80% formate Faradaic efficiency.

        <p>In summary, ultrathin SnO 2 nanosheets have been successfully synthesized with (001) facets exposed. Due to the undercoordinated Sn sites and extended interfaces, SnO 2 NSs exhibit a rather wide electrochemical potential window (800 mV) with &gt; 80% formate faradaic efficiency in a flow cell. DFT calculation and in situ spectroscopic studies were combined to elucidate the CO 2 reduction reaction pathway on SnO 2 nanosheets surface.
