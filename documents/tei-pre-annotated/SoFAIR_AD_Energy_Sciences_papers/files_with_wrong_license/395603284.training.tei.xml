        <p>Transparent photocatalytic TiO2 thin films hold great potential in the development of self-cleaning glass surfaces, but suffer from a poor visible light response that hinders the application under actual sunlight. To alleviate this problem, the photocatalytic film can be modified with plasmonic nanoparticles that interact very effectively with visible light. Since the plasmonic effect is strongly concentrated in the near surroundings of the entire nanoparticle surface, an approach is presented to embed the plasmonic nanostructures in the TiO2 matrix itself, rather than deposit them loosely on the surface. This way the interaction interface is maximised and the plasmonic effect can be fully exploited.Transparent photocatalytic TiO2 thin films hold great potential in the development of self-cleaning glass surfaces, but suffer from a poor visible light response that hinders the application under actual sunlight.

        <p>In this study, pre-fabricated gold nanoparticles are made compatible with the organic medium of a TiO2 sol-gel coating suspension, resulting in a one-pot coating suspension. After spin coating, homogeneous, smooth and highly transparent anatase thin films are obtained with a negligible loss in transparency caused upon introduction of gold nanoparticles. The thin films are characterised by ellipsometry, XRD, UV-VIS spectroscopy, AFM, SEM-EDX, TEM and water contact angle measurements.In this study, pre-fabricated gold nanoparticles are made compatible with the organic medium of a TiO2 sol-gel coating suspension, resulting in a one-pot coating suspension.

        <p>When TiO2 is used in self-cleaning applications, it is usually deposited as a thin film that is capable of removing pollutants from the surface using (sun)light. The film thickness typically ranges from a few nanometres to several micrometres. [1][2][3] TiO2 thin films can be deposited by a wide variety of methods, ranging from target sputtering over sol-gel deposition, thermal methods, vapour deposition techniques (PVD/CVD/ALD), anodic oxidation and plasma-assisted deposition processes. [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] In this work, the sol-gel method is selected because it is straightforward, affordable and it can be applied directly onto a wide variety of substrates using easy and low-cost techniques such as spin or dip coating. [3] Furthermore, this simple yet versatile sol-gel process is an ideal method to obtain thin film coatings of high transparency, which is a crucial parameter when applying self-cleaning films onto glass surfaces. One of the main constraints of photocatalytic self-cleaning materials on the market, is their limited solar-light response. Photocatalytic films based on unmodified TiO2 as the active ingredient are only activated by the UV-component of solar light, and thus only ca. 4-5% of the incident solar light spectrum is actually used effectively.When TiO2 is used in self-cleaning applications, it is usually deposited as a thin film that is capable of removing pollutants from the surface using (sun)light.

        <p>To further improve the photocatalytic self-cleaning activity under solar light, we propose to modify the films by plasmonic nanoparticles embedded in the active layer. In contrast to traditional methods, where modification with plasmonic nanoparticles occurs by simply mixing, depositing or (photo-) impregnating them on the surface of the photocatalyst in a multi-step process, [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19] here, the nanoparticles are first stabilised and mixed with the titanium precursor sol. Hence, this procedure provides a 'one-pot' coating suspension that can be readily applied. This is expected to facilitate a homogeneous dispersion and stable embedment of the plasmonic nanoparticles throughout the resulting TiO2 matrix. The additional advantage of fully embedding the nanoparticles into the photocatalytic TiO2 film can be rationalized as follows: (i) under UV light irradiation electron-hole pairs are generated in the TiO2 semiconductor, while the metal nanoparticles solely act as passive electron sinks, resulting in less recombination events. [20] (ii) On the other hand, previous research has also shown that for Au/TiO2 composites under visible light illumination, direct "hot electron" injection from the excited plasmonic nanoparticles into the conduction band of TiO2 plays an important role, [21,22] as well as an increase of the electromagnetic near-field within a 3 nm radius surrounding the plasmonic nanoparticle, as investigated by Asapu et al. [23,24] Regardless of the excitation wavelength, maximising the direct contact interface between the nanoparticle and the semiconductor is of paramount importance for both of these electron and energy transfer processes. As a consequence, by partially or fully embedding the nanoparticles in the TiO2 matrix, the contact interface is increased substantially and may lead to considerably higher photocatalytic activities (Figure 1). [25,26] In addition, partially or fully embedding the nanoparticles in a rigid matrix is hypothesised to protect them from chemical corrosion, reshaping, agglomeration and detachment during post-treatment or photocatalytic testing, thereby adding to the stability of the entire composite system. [27,28] The plasmonic metal nanoparticles are first prepared separately after which they are introduced in the sol-gel precursor solution ("ex-situ" method). This entails several advantages over an "in-situ" approach, where a metal salt precursor and TiO2 precursor are mixed, simultaneously forming metal nanoparticles and TiO2. [29][30][31][32] A vast amount of literature can be found on several synthesis procedures enabling the preparation of nanoparticles of different compositions, shapes and sizes, whether or not functionalized with specific ligands. In other words, the ex-situ method enables much more accurate and precise control over the nanoparticle properties, tailored to the envisaged application. [33] In-situ synthesis procedures on the other hand only enable limited control over the nucleation process and final nanoparticle size and shape. [30] The only difficulty that lies in the proposed strategy is that the plasmonic metal nanoparticles (typically prepared in an aqueous medium) have to be made compatible with the titania precursor coating sol (typically organic solvent based). One possible solution to this problem is proposed by Sonawane et al. [34] It involves complete condensation of a Ti-alkoxide precursor followed by re-dissolution in aqueous hydrogen peroxide to render it compatible with the aqueous nanoparticle colloids. In our work, the use of such harsh conditions is avoided by achieving the opposite: adapting the colloids to the coating sol. A similar strategy has been investigated by the group of Mulvaney, with the eye on gas-sensing applications. [30] The metal loadings used in that particular study are, however, quite high (ranging from 4 to 8 wt%) and no photocatalytic activity data have been collected. In the present work, thin TiO2 films are modified with gold nanoparticles up to 3 wt% loading. The resulting effect on transparency is evaluated and the photocatalytic activity is measured by means of stearic acid degradation under simulated solar light, with the eye on real outdoor applications. This is a widely recognized model reaction as stearic acid is a representative of the group of organic fouling compounds that typically contaminate glass surfaces. [1,5,35] This study thus goes beyond the state-of-the-art of (photocatalytic) self-cleaning surfaces in that sense that currently commercially available photocatalytic self-cleaning materials can only utilise the UV-component of solar light. The goal is to expand the activity window towards the entire solar spectrum. This would not only increase the efficiency for outdoor use, but could also enable the use of such surfaces under artificial (indoor) light.To further improve the photocatalytic self-cleaning activity under solar light, we propose to modify the films by plasmonic nanoparticles embedded in the active layer.

        <p>A phase transfer of the nanoparticles from the aqueous phase to the organic phase is achieved by exchanging the sodium citrate with PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone, Alfa Aesar, 10000 g mol -1 ). PVP was dissolved in water by ultrasonication (45 kHz) for 15 minutes. An appropriate amount of the PVP solution (2.5 mM) was added to the colloidal Au suspension so that 60 PVP molecules were provided per nm² nanoparticle surface. The solution was stirred at 600 rpm for 24 h at room temperature to ensure complete exchange of the stabilising agent. [38] The resulting PVP stabilised Au nanoparticles were finally centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 20 minutes, washed and re-suspended in absolute ethanol (Emplura, 99.5%).

        <p>The (modified) titania sols were prepared by the hydrolysis of titanium(IV)isopropoxide (TTIP, Sigma-Aldrich, 97%) in the presence of acetic acid (Riedel-de Haën, 96%). A solution of TTIP and ethanol (0.05:1.64 molar ratio) (henceforth referred to as Mixture 1) was added dropwise (average drop volume 0.021 ± 0.005 mL over 200 s) to a solution containing water, ethanol and acetic acid (1.07:1.31:0.34 molar ratio) (referred to as Mixture 2) under vigorous stirring. In the case of Au/TiO2 thin film preparation, the ethanol part of Mixture 2 was replaced by a concentrated dispersion containing appropriate amounts of gold nanoparticles in ethanol. The exact concentration of the added Au NPs colloidal suspension was determined quantitatively using Spectroquant® analysis (NOVA 60, Merck) using a standard gold test kit (114 821). This way, sols were prepared with a nominal and actual gold loading of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1 and 3 wt% (calculated and measured relative to the total amount of TiO2). The viscosity change of the formed sol was monitored with a Brookfield LVDV-I prime Digital Viscometer operated at a spindle speed of 12 rpm, to ensure all samples were spin coated at the same viscosity. Film deposition was achieved by spin coating both the glass and silicon substrates at 1000 rpm for one minute at room temperature. Finally, the samples were calcined at 823 K for three hours at a heating rate of 1 K min -1 . The overall synthesis procedure is schematised in Figure 2. To evaluate the proposed procedure, it was compared with Sonawane's sol-gel procedure. The solgels were prepared as reported by Sonawane et al. [32].

The resulting colloidal solutions were dark red and showed a similar UV-VIS absorption spectrum to the 100% Au suspensions described in earlier work, indicating that increasing the concentration has no effect on the final nanoparticle properties. [17,37] Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed that Au nanoparticles with a mean diameter of (16 ± 2) nm are obtained. An important step in the synthesis procedure described in Figure 2 is the proper stabilisation of the nanoparticles, so they can be used at high concentrations in an organic solvent. Sodium citrate only weakly stabilises the nanoparticles causing them to agglomerate in the presence of an organic solvent, thus a phase transfer step is required. [38][39][40] To achieve this, the sodium citrate was exchanged with PVP, as PVP stabilised nanoparticles are considerably more stable in organic media. [39,40] The effect of this exchange on the UV-VIS absorption spectrum can be observed in Figure 3. After ligand exchange, a small red shift of the plasmon peak is detected. This is in line with results obtained by Bastús et al., who observed a similar red shift after ligand exchange with various surfactants. [41] This shift is ascribed to an increase in the hydrodynamic diameter (i.e. including coating material and solvation layer), caused by capping the nanoparticles with a bigger, bulky molecule like PVP.

        <p>Moderate variations in the coating sol viscosity show a negligible effect on the resulting film thickness that was determined by means of ellipsometry and amounted to (78 ± 3) nm on silicon wafers and (55 ± 5) nm on glass substrates when spin coated at a spinning speed of 1500 rpm (Figure 4a). Altering the spinning speed, on the other hand, obviously affects the resulting film thickness to a large extent (Figure 4b). Based on these results, a spin-coating speed of 1000 rpm was selected for the plasmon modified thin films, resulting in a layer thickness of 94 nm (Figure 4b, red circle). XRD spectra (Figure S2 in Supporting Information) confirm that the obtained crystal structure of the TiO2 thin film is anatase as expected based on the applied calcination temperature. [42] The absorption spectra of the final calcined TiO2 films with embedded Au nanoparticles at incremental weight loadings up to 3 wt% show a clear red shift of the SPR band from 521.5 nm (colloidal suspension of PVP stabilised Au nanoparticles, Figure 3) to 626 nm for the embedded Au in TiO2 films, Figure 5. This is a common effect that can be attributed to the higher refractive index of the surrounding medium (TiO2 instead of water). [30] Since the Au nanoparticles are expected to be largely embedded in the TiO2 matrix itself, the observed red shift is also considerably larger (Δ = 104.5 nm) compared to the one observed in earlier work, where the nanoparticles were only deposited on the TiO2 surface and thus mostly surrounded by air as the dielectric medium (Δ = 24 nm). [17,37] For the 0.1 wt% Au sample, no clear plasmon band could be observed. For the remaining metal loadings, the plasmon band becomes more apparent as the metal loading increases. No obvious broadening of the plasmon band, nor shift of the peak maximum is observed after introducing higher metal loadings, indicating the Au nanoparticles remain well dispersed and do not cluster in the TiO2 matrix, as will be confirmed by SEM and TEM analysis further down this work. In view of potential commercial applications, it is important to obtain transparent, solar light active films. The transparency of the coatings is therefore evaluated by measuring the relative loss in total integrated transmittance of AM1.5 simulated solar light passing through the coated films, relative to unmodified borosilicate glass (Figure 6a). Coating the glass slide with a thin, unmodified layer of TiO2 reduces the overall transmittance of the sample by only 14%. Macroscopically, this can hardly be observed by the naked eye; only a slight colour difference of the coated glass is noticeable. At this point, no actions have been undertaken to further improve the transparency of the TiO2 film if needed.Moderate variations in the coating sol viscosity show a negligible effect on the resulting film thickness that was determined by means of ellipsometry and amounted to (78 ± 3) nm on silicon wafers and (55 ± 5) nm on glass substrates when spin coated at a spinning speed of 1500 rpm (Figure 4a).

        <p>Lowering the film thickness could for instance already improve the transparency, but a trade-off with photocatalytic activity should be kept in mind. Combining TiO2 with a low refractive index material like SiO2 is another method that allows to control the optical properties of the resulting film. [3,43] However, this is outside the scope of the present study. Commercially available photocatalytic selfcleaning glass, PilkingtonActiv TM , has a 13% transmittance reduction, indicating that a loss in transmittance of 14% is perfectly acceptable for the pure TiO2-coating in view of real applications.Lowering the film thickness could for instance already improve the transparency, but a trade-off with photocatalytic activity should be kept in mind.

        <p>Embedment of stabilised plasmonic nanoparticles in the TiO2 matrix up to 1 wt% induces no additional loss in transparency. For the highest metal loading of 3 wt%, a negligible additional loss in transparency of 1% with regard to the unmodified TiO2 film is measured. This is a promising result as it indicates that adding gold nanoparticles only has a limited effect on the light transmitting properties of the resulting films. A photograph of the overall macroscopic appearance of the coated films is presented in Figure 6 b. The average roughness factor (Ra) of the coatings was determined by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) measurements and shows that a bare Borofloat® glass substrate has Ra = 0.23 nm. The pure TiO2 sample prepared with the newly proposed method has Ra = 1.01 nm, which is smoother than the commercial benchmark PilkingtonActiv™ with Ra = 1.57 nm. The plasmon-embedded thin films with a gold loading of 0.5 wt% of Au NPs result in thin films with an Ra of 1.25 nm. When the surface roughness of the different coated substrates is plotted relative to uncoated Borofloat® (Figure 7), it is clear that, even though the samples are 4 to 5 times rougher compared to bare Borofloat®, they are still much smoother than commercially available self-cleaning glass. In order to investigate the distribution of the Au NPs throughout the thin film, a Mo TEM grid with carbon film was spin-coated with the plasmon-embedded TiO2 sol-gel, which was then calcined and investigated by STEM-HAADF imaging. As the signal of the STEM-HAADF image is approximately proportional to the square of the atomic number Z, the bright Au NPs can easily be distinguished from the surrounding TiO2 film (Figure 8 b). Discrete pieces of the TiO2 film were found on the Mo grid. Some of the TiO2 pieces are not positioned parallel with the Mo grids, but at certain angles with the grid, allowing tilting them to view the cross-section or even the bottom side of the TiO2 pieces. Figure 8b shows a small piece of TiO2 film that has an intersecting angle of 17.7° with the Mo grid. This film was tilted 72.3° to be parallel with the incoming electron-beam, so that a cross-section of the TiO2 film could be imaged. The TiO2 piece is so small that the thickness of this piece in its geometry still allows the penetration of the electron beam, thus enabling the visualisation of the Au NPs. It is clear that there are Au NPs (marked by yellow circles) at different depths throughout the TiO2 film.

As a reference, for PilkingtonActiv™ the water contact angle dropped to (11 ± 1)˚, while for uncoated Borofloat® there was no significant change (20 ± 2)˚, as expected. Therefore it may be concluded that both under dark and irradiated conditions, the developed coatings are more hydrophilic than the commercial reference sample, and the Au-containing films are slightly more wetting that the pure TiO2 thin films.

        <p>The photocatalytic activity of the films was evaluated by monitoring the degradation of stearic acid from the surface, a widely applied method for assessing the activity of self-cleaning materials as stearic acid is considered to be an adequate model compound for organic fouling. [1,5,17,35,45] Mills and Wang reported complete mineralisation of stearic acid to CO2 with reaction intermediates that degrade faster than the original fouling compound for similar sol-gel based titania coatings. [45] The results of our experiments performed under both UVA and simulated solar light are presented in Figure 9. All measurements were performed in triplicate and for the ease of comparison, the relative improvement of the Au-modified films compared to the pristine reference is presented and calculated as the ratio of their respective formal quantum efficiencies (FQEs). Under pure UVA illumination (Figure 9a), it can be seen that embedding gold nanoparticles into TiO2 causes the photocatalytic activity to increase compared to the unmodified sample (up to 16% for the 3 wt% sample). The large contact interface between the embedded nanoparticles and TiO2 is thought to improve the electron transfer efficiency from the excited semiconductor to the passive Au nanoparticle electron sinks. Under broadband solar light illumination (Figure 9b) a similar trend can be observed, where higher loadings lead to an increased activity relative to the unmodified sample. The relative improvement starts to saturate around 1 wt%, that can thus be considered to be an adequate loading from a costeffectiveness point of view. Relative improvements up to 29% and 40% for the 1 wt% and 3 wt% samples, respectively, are achieved. It is clear that these improvements are much higher than the ones observed under pure UVA illumination (Figure 9 a versus b) and can therefore not be solely attributed to the UV part of the simulated sunlight. These results therefore support the hypothesis that a synergistic interaction occurs when dually exciting the plasmonic photocatalyst under solar irradiation (i.e. simultaneously exciting the semiconductor by UV light and the plasmonic nanoparticles by visible light). In order to compare the newly proposed method with an alternative available method from literature, samples prepared according to Sonowane et al. have also been measured. It is observed that they are less performant than the newly proposed method (Figure 10). The stearic acid degradation rate of the Sonawane non-modified TiO2 coated sample is 3.7 x 10 11 molecules cm -² s -1 , which is 8% of the non-modified coatings of the proposed method, which reach a stearic acid degradation rate of 4.4 x 10 12 molecules cm -² s -1 . The addition of gold nanoparticles into the Sonawane sol-gel coatings increases the stearic acid degradation rate 2.5 times to 8.3 x 10 11 molecules cm -² s -1 , which is still 6 times lower than the proposed method with a rate of 4.9 x 10 12 molecules cm -² s -1 . When comparing the new coating to the commercial benchmark PilkingtonActiv™ with a stearic acid degradation rate of 6.2 x 10 11 molecules cm -² s -1 , the pure TiO2 coatings performs 6 times better. The Au-embedded coatings outperform the benchmark by nearly an entire order of magnitude. Attempts have been made to evaluate the long-term stability of the prepared coatings by retesting 6-month-old samples. The relative improvement with respect to unmodified samples is well retained, however, a fair one-on-one comparison of the absolute conversion rates could not be made due to large differences in ambient temperature and relative humidity with regard to the initial measurement conditions.

        <p>Compared to previous work on a broadband 'rainbow' plasmonic photocatalyst that absorbs light over the entire UV-visible light range, [37] a twice as high efficiency improvement is obtained in this work with the embedded gold nanoparticles. Although the 'rainbow' system was specifically designed to perform well under actual solar light irradiation, an overall improvement of the FQE of 16% was obtained for 1.5 wt% mixed metal loading on the surface of P25, whereas in this work already 29% improvement has been measured for only 1.0 wt% of gold embedded thin films with a much narrower plasmon resonance band. This is a clear indication that the embedment strategy is a promising approach to maximise the interaction area between the photocatalytic support and the plasmonic sensitizers. Improved wavelength tuning of the plasmonic nanostructures to better match with the actual solar radiation spectrum is therefore expected to yield even higher enhancement factors.Compared to previous work on a broadband 'rainbow' plasmonic photocatalyst that absorbs light over the entire UV-visible light range, [37] a twice as high efficiency improvement is obtained in this work with the embedded gold nanoparticles.

        <p>A convenient strategy to obtain plasmon modified, transparent self-cleaning films based on an exsitu sol-gel synthesis procedure is presented. Gold nanoparticles were prepared according to the Turkevich method, followed by a ligand exchange step to enable a phase transfer from an aqueous colloidal suspension to an organic medium. Finally, the stabilised gold nanoparticles were mixed directly with a titanium precursor during the sol-gel synthesis process, resulting in a one-pot coating suspension containing both the titania source as well as the plasmonic sensitisers. After spin coating at 1000 rpm, this led to a homogeneous TiO2 thin film with the stabilised gold nanostructures embedded in the film matrix and a layer thickness of 94 nm. Calcination at 823 K ensured that the titania coating obtained an anatase crystal structure. UV-VIS measurements confirmed a clear red shift of the SPR band from 521.5 nm for a colloidal suspension of PVP stabilised Au nanoparticles to 626 nm for the embedded Au nanoparticles. It was measured that upon introducing gold nanoparticles in the TiO2 film, an additional negligible loss in transparency was achieved in the order of 1-4% for a gold content between 0.1 and 3 wt%, compared to commercially available self-cleaning glass PilkingtonActiv TM . Surface roughness measurements proved that very smooth plasmon-embedded thin films could be obtained using the presented method.
