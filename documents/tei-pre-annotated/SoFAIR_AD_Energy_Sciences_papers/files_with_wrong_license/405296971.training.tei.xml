        <p>Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase (FAP) is a photoenzyme with potential green chemistry applications. By combining static, time-resolved, and cryotrapping spectroscopy and crystallography as well as computation, we characterize Chlorella variabilis FAP reaction intermediates on time scales from sub-picoseconds to milliseconds. High-resolution crystal structures from synchrotron and free electron laser x-ray sources highlight an unusual bent shape of the oxidized flavin chromophore. We demonstrate that decarboxylation occurs directly upon reduction of the excited flavin by the fatty acid substrate. Along with flavin reoxidation by the alkyl radical intermediate, a major fraction of the cleaved CO2 unexpectedly transforms in 100 ns, most likely into bicarbonate. This reaction is orders of magnitude faster than in solution. Two strictly conserved residues, R451 and C432, are essential for substrate stabilization and functional charge transfer.Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase (FAP) is a photoenzyme with potential green chemistry applications.

        <p>The vast majority of enzymatic reactions in living cells are thermally activated, whereas reactions driven by light are much less common (1). Apart from photosynthetic reaction centers, three natural photoenzymes have been identified to date: DNA photolyases, which are involved in the repair of UV-damaged DNA (2), light-dependent protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (LPOR) required for the maturation of chlorophyll (3) and the recently discovered fatty acid photodecarboxylase (FAP, EC 4.1.1.106), which converts fatty acids to hydrocarbons and CO2 (4).The vast majority of enzymatic reactions in living cells are thermally activated, whereas reactions driven by light are much less common (1).

        <p>Photoenzymes require a photon for each turnover of a substrate molecule and offer the possibility to trigger and monitor catalytic steps and associated structural changes on very short time scales that are generally not accessible for thermally-activated enzymes (5). Thus, over the past 20 years, the photochemical mechanism has been studied in detail for DNA photolyases (6)(7)(8) and has started to be identified for LPOR (9)(10)(11)(12)(13). Due to its readily available substrate, FAP may become a model of choice to understand catalytic steps that occur in enzymology.Photoenzymes require a photon for each turnover of a substrate molecule and offer the possibility to trigger and monitor catalytic steps and associated structural changes on very short time scales that are generally not accessible for thermally-activated enzymes (5).

        <p>Light-driven enzymes are also interesting for practical applications. Increasing our understanding and the repertoire of photoenzymatic mechanisms may help in the design of catalysts performing new reactions (14,15) or in the development of new light-controlled proteins for optogenetics (16). FAP has potential biotechnological applications in green chemistry because hydrocarbons are important as cosmetics emollients, chemical synthons, solvents and fuels (17)(18)(19). FAP complements routes previously identified for bio-based synthesis of hydrocarbons (20) by providing a one-step light-driven pathway from fatty acids. Rational design approaches have recently allowed to improve the efficiency of FAP on high-value functionalized carboxylic acids (21) and on short-chain fatty acids in order to produce liquefied petroleum gas (20). Understanding the reaction mechanism of FAP in detail is thus of utmost importance, both from a fundamentalresearch and an application point of view.Light-driven enzymes are also interesting for practical applications.

        <p>FAP is an algae-specific enzyme from the glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) oxidoreductase family harboring a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor. It allows the decarboxylation of C16-C18 free (non-esterified) fatty acids to the corresponding n-alka(e)nes (4). These hydrocarbon products are mostly located in chloroplast thylakoids but their exact role is still unknown (22,23). The initial spectroscopic characterization of FAP, based on monitoring the electronic state of the flavin following excitation by a laser flash, has led to a first model of the FAP photocycle (4). The cycle starts with the quenching of the singlet excited state by forward electron transfer (fET) from bound fatty acid R-CO2 -in ~300 ps (with a quantum yield &gt;80%), forming a flavin anion radical FAD •-and a fatty acid radical R-CO2 • . The latter decarboxylates, yielding an alkyl radical R • and CO2. FAD •-is re-oxidized in ~100 ns by back electron transfer (bET) which ultimately provides the electron for the reduction of R • to the alkane RH. FAD •- reoxidation results in a transiently red-shifted flavin state FADRS that reverts to the initial state in 4 ms. Despite this insight, several open questions remained, such as: which structural features of the FAP active site promote substrate stabilization and favor the fET? Is decarboxylation instantaneous upon this fET step or is it slowed by an activation barrier? Does conversion of R • to the alkane RH occur by bET from FAD •-coupled to a proton transfer (PT/PCET) or by hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from a nearby amino acid (4,24)? What is the origin of the proton or the hydrogen atom? Here, we report a high-resolution structure of FAP and characterize key steps along the FAP photocycle using a wealth of static and time-resolved crystallographic and spectroscopic techniques, as well as computational approaches. Our detailed characterization of FAP reveals unforeseen mechanistic complexity.FAP is an algae-specific enzyme from the glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) oxidoreductase family harboring a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor.

        <p>Crystals of FAP from Chlorella variabilis NC64A (CvFAP), diffracting x-rays to high resolution and without the twinning fault reported earlier (4), were obtained upon removal of the N-terminal helix involved in crystal packing (residues 61 to 76) in native CvFAP. The resulting structure, solved at 1.8 Å resolution (table S1) now provides a detailed view of the active site architecture (Fig. 1A-D and fig. S1). Although no substrate was added during protein purification and crystallization, two C18 fatty acids co-purified with FAP were clearly identified, one in the active site, the other on the surface of the protein. The latter is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions with nonpolar side chains (L427, Y419, I126, I416 and L420) as well as the aliphatic parts of R132 and R122. In the active site, the carboxyl group of the fatty acid is stabilized by hydrogen bonds with water molecules (Wat1 and Wat2) and the side chains of R451 and N575 (Fig. 1D). The fatty acid substrate is also stabilized on the dimethylbenzene side of FAD, in contrast to other GMC oxidoreductase enzymes that have their substrate stabilized near the N5 atom of FAD (fig. S2).Crystals of FAP from Chlorella variabilis NC64A (CvFAP), diffracting x-rays to high resolution and without the twinning fault reported earlier (4), were obtained upon removal of the N-terminal helix involved in crystal packing (residues 61 to 76) in native CvFAP.

        <p>In the high-resolution dark-state structure of FAP obtained from synchrotron data '100 K dark', the isoalloxazine ring of the FAD cofactor was found to be bent, with the dihedral angle C4-N5-N10-C9 (butterfly bending angle) deviating by 17.4° from planarity (Fig. 1E,fig S2A). Such bending is usually interpreted as caused by X-ray photoreduction converting supposedly planar oxidized flavin to the bent reduced form (8,25,26). For FAP however, in crystallo UV-Vis absorption microspectrophotometry (fig. S3), low dose crystallography, (fig. S4A and table S1), Raman microspectrophotometry (fig. S4B,C) and molecular dynamics simulations (fig. S5A,B) using a recent flavin force field (27) indicated that the FAD cofactor is bent in its oxidized form (supplementary text S1). To obtain a definite answer concerning the conformation of the oxidized FAD in FAP, we performed room temperature serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) at an Xray free-electron laser (XFEL; see below for details), which allows collecting essentially radiation damage-free diffraction data (28,29). Importantly, this SFX dark-state structure of FAP ('SFX dark'), solved at 2.0 Å resolution (table S2) features a FAD with a similar bending angle (14.3°) as observed in the synchrotron '100 K dark' and the 'RT dark low-dose' structures (Fig. 1E and figs.In the high-resolution dark-state structure of FAP obtained from synchrotron data '100 K dark', the isoalloxazine ring of the FAD cofactor was found to be bent, with the dihedral angle C4-N5-N10-C9 (butterfly bending angle) deviating by 17.4° from planarity (Fig. 1E,fig S2A).

To our knowledge, a butterfly bent conformation of the oxidized flavin has not been firmly established for any other flavoprotein. In fact, bent conformations were either not discussed or attributed to X-ray-induced flavin reduction. Future radiation-damage-free structures of oxidized flavoproteins should reveal whether the bending is a feature specific to FAP.S4, S6, S7), supporting the notion that in FAP, the FAD cofactor is in a bent conformation in the oxidized state.

        <p>Our previous single-shot fluorescence and transient absorption experiments in the presence of substrate, with 100 ps and 10 ns temporal resolution, respectively, showed a decay of the singlet excited flavin ( 1 FAD*) in ~300 ps and formation of FAD •-within 10 ns (4). Here we extend the fluorescence and visible absorption experiments to the ultrafast time scale with 100 fs-resolution pump-probe spectroscopy (Fig. 2A,B and fig. S8A) showing that no faster 1 FAD* decay phases occur, (only a ~2 ps thermal relaxation phase was observed in the fluorescence as in other flavoproteins (30)) and that, as predicted (4), FAD •-is formed concomitant with 1 FAD* decay (FigOur previous single-shot fluorescence and transient absorption experiments in the presence of substrate, with 100 ps and 10 ns temporal resolution, respectively, showed a decay of the singlet excited flavin ( 1 FAD*) in ~300 ps and formation of FAD •-within 10 ns (4).

        <p>We investigated whether the carboxylate of the fatty acid is cleaved off concomitantly with electron transfer from the fatty acid to 1 FAD* (~300 ps), after this oxidation, or accompanying the bET from flavin (~100 ns). Light-induced FTIR difference spectroscopy performed at 298 K showed a CO2 band at 2342 cm -1 (Fig. 2C) corresponding to CO2 in solution (31). The kinetics of CO2 formation in FAP were monitored by picosecond to microsecond time-resolved infrared spectroscopy (TR-IR) in a frequency range centered around 2350 cm -1 and Arbitrary Detuning ASynchronous OPtical Sampling (ADASOPS) (32,33). This experiment showed the appearance of a CO2 absorption band centered at 2337.5 cm -1 with a time constant of ~270 ps (Fig. 2C-E and fig. S9). We conclude that decarboxylation is rate-limited by electron transfer from substrate to 1 FAD* occurring in ~300 ps. The initial CO2 band frequency is ~5 cm -1 down-shifted with respect to that of 12 CO2 in aqueous solution, a finding we assign to the protein environment. Subsequently, the CO2 signal diminishes ~4-fold with a time constant of 100 ns, without changing much in shape, followed by an upshift towards 2342 cm -1 , a process fitted with a time constant of ~1.5 µs. The latter process likely reflects migration of CO2 towards the solvent. Importantly, the data indicate that the 100 ns process implies transformation of ~75% of the initially formed CO2 within the protein into another molecule, possibly bicarbonate, concomitant with flavin reoxidation to the redshifted form FADRS (see section on red-shift intermediate). This process was not foreseen in our previously proposed reaction scheme (4). Whereas our present data covering six orders of magnitude in time can reasonably well be described with these three exponential processes and a constant phase (Fig. 2E), it is possible that an additional phase of CO2 release into the solvent occurs on a timescale exceeding 50 µs, the temporal window of our present experiments.We investigated whether the carboxylate of the fatty acid is cleaved off concomitantly with electron transfer from the fatty acid to 1 FAD* (~300 ps), after this oxidation, or accompanying the bET from flavin (~100 ns).

        <p>In order to determine whether any of the reaction steps are coupled to or directly reflect a proton transfer (PT) or a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), we compared the kinetics of all steps observable by continuous-probe time-resolved fluorescence or transient absorption spectroscopy in H2O and D2O buffers. The biphasic fluorescence signal showing the decay of 1 FAD* (due to quenching by ET from the substrate (300 ps phase; &gt;80%) and to the intersystem-crossing to a nonreactive triplet state (~6.5 ns phase; &lt;20%)) was not visibly affected by the isotope exchange (Fig. 3A), as expected for reactions that are not significantly coupled to movements of exchangeable hydrogen species (e.g., back-ET from QA -to P680 + in photosystem II (34)). In contrast, the kinetics of FAD •-reoxidation to FADRS observed by transient absorption spectroscopy at three characteristic wavelengths slowed down by a factor of ~2: from ~100 ns in H2O to ~200 ns in D2O (Fig. 3B), suggesting that this bET step is coupled to and limited by transfer of an exchangeable proton or hydrogen atom. Change of buffer pH in the interval between 7.5 and 9.1 had no effect on the kinetics of this step (fig. S10A), indicating that the proton or hydrogen atom donor involved in the reaction has a pKa value above 9.1. The significantly lower kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of 1.2 reported by Heyes et al.

        <p>The last step observable by transient absorption spectroscopy is the disappearance of the transient red shift of reoxidized FAD occurring in a few milliseconds. This process was previously (4) assigned to reprotonation of X -, the conjugate base of XH, an unidentified proton donor to the alkyl radical. Kinetics of this process also slowed down when H2O in the buffer was replaced by D2O: from ~3 ms to ~10 ms (Fig. 3C). Consistent with this observation and the recent report of a pH increase (in an unbuffered solution) associated with this step (24), this process apparently reflects a proton transfer from bulk solvent. Again, change of buffer pH in the interval between 7.5 and 9.1 had no effect on the kinetics of this step (fig. S10B) and neither did the consumption of the native substrate (fig. S10C). Time-resolved spectroscopic findings are summarized in fig.

        <p>The structure derived from a CvFAP crystal exposed to 470 nm light at 100 K ('100 K light') featured FAP trapped in a FADRS state, as shown by in crystallo microspectrophotometry (fig. S12). The difference electron density map between '100 K light' and '100 K dark' displays strong and significant peaks only around the substrate and FAD cofactor. These peaks can be fitted with a CO2 molecule in addition to the alkyl chain stabilized in the active site (Fig. 4B, C and fig. S13A-C). The positive difference electron density along the aliphatic tail of the substrate (from C13 to C15) and the 8° rotation of the side chain of Y466 indicates a correlated motion in line with the strong electronic coupling observed by quantum chemistry between the substrate and Y466. In order to reflect the optimum pH of FAP in solution (pH 8.5; Ref. (4)) and to overcome thermal activation barriers, a FAP crystal was soaked at pH 8.5 and illuminated at 150 K ('150 K light').The structure derived from a CvFAP crystal exposed to 470 nm light at 100 K ('100 K light') featured FAP trapped in a FADRS state, as shown by in crystallo microspectrophotometry (fig.

        <p>Interestingly, after modeling alkane and a CO2 molecule, the residual Fo -Fc electron density map showed a positive density with a triangular shape close to C432, which we tentatively attribute to bicarbonate with 30% occupancy (Fig. 4D and fig.

        <p>We investigated the structural changes occurring in FAP after photoexcitation at room temperature by a time-resolved SFX (TR-SFX) experiment ( 35) using a pump-probe scheme. Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy on FAP microcrystals established that the kinetics of fET are the same as in solution (supplementary text S5, fig. S15). For TR-SFX at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), FAP microcrystals were photoexcited by picosecond 400 nm pump pulses and probed by femtosecond XFEL pulses after pump-probe delays of 20 ps, 900 ps, 300 ns, and 2 μs to cover time scales on which FAD reduction and FAD •-reoxidation occur. The 'SFX dark' state structure mentioned above, was determined from the data in the absence of a pump laser pulse. Structural changes after photoexcitation were visualized as positive and negative peaks in difference Fourier electron density maps calculated between the light and dark data sets (Fobs light_Δt -Fobs dark ; Fig. 5A) at 2.2 Å resolution. The most prominent difference electron density peaks at all four time points are at the active site, with the highest negative peak (-5.5 to -10.1 σ, depending on the time point) at the position of the carboxyl group of the substrate, showing that light-induced decarboxylation occurred (Fig. 5A). At 900 ps, decarboxylation has occurred to a considerable extent, in line with the 270 ps time constant determined by multi-scale time-resolved IR spectroscopy (Fig. 2C-E). At 300 ns and 2 μs, a strong negative peak is observed at Wat1 (-5.8, and -6.2 σ, respectively, Fig. 5A), but not on Wat2. We note the absence of positive difference electron density peaks associated with the photodissociated CO2 in the vicinity of the substrate carboxyl group. A possible reason could be the small initial displacement of cleaved CO2 relative to its position in the fatty acid, in line with the structure determined based on an illuminated cryo-cooled crystal '100 K light' (see fig. S13C for comparison). It is conceivable that the positive difference densities close to C432 in the 300 ns and 2 µs data sets (Fig. 5A) correspond to the feature(s) observed in the data obtained from cryo-cooled crystals illuminated at 150 K (Fig. 5B and Fig. 4D), tentatively assigned to a bicarbonate (fig. S14). In the SFX data, attempts to fit unambiguously this positive difference density with a bicarbonate, a CO2 molecule or a mixture thereof remained unsatisfactory. The absence of significant difference electron density peaks at the FAD at all four time points suggests that the isoalloxazine ring does not undergo significant light-induced conformational changes.We investigated the structural changes occurring in FAP after photoexcitation at room temperature by a time-resolved SFX (TR-SFX) experiment ( 35) using a pump-probe scheme. Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy on FAP microcrystals established that the kinetics of fET are the same as in solution (supplementary text S5, fig. S15). For TR-SFX at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), FAP microcrystals were photoexcited by picosecond 400 nm pump pulses and probed by femtosecond XFEL pulses after pump-probe delays of 20 ps, 900 ps, 300 ns, and 2 μs to cover time scales on which FAD reduction and FAD •-reoxidation occur. The 'SFX dark' state structure mentioned above, was determined from the data in the absence of a pump laser pulse. Structural changes after photoexcitation were visualized as positive and negative peaks in difference Fourier electron density maps calculated between the light and dark data sets (Fobs light_Δt -Fobs dark ; Fig. 5A) at 2.2 Å resolution. The most prominent difference electron density peaks at all four time points are at the active site, with the highest negative peak (-5.5 to -10.1 σ, depending on the time point) at the position of the carboxyl group of the substrate, showing that light-induced decarboxylation occurred (Fig. 5A). At 900 ps, decarboxylation has occurred to a considerable extent, in line with the 270 ps time constant determined by multi-scale time-resolved IR spectroscopy (Fig. 2C-E). At 300 ns and 2 μs, a strong negative peak is observed at Wat1 (-5.8, and -6.2 σ, respectively, Fig. 5A), but not on Wat2. We note the absence of positive difference electron density peaks associated with the photodissociated CO2 in the vicinity of the substrate carboxyl group. A possible reason could be the small initial displacement of cleaved CO2 relative to its position in the fatty acid, in line with the structure determined based on an illuminated cryo-cooled crystal '100 K light' (see fig. S13C for comparison). It is conceivable that the positive difference densities close to C432 in the 300 ns and 2 µs data sets (Fig. 5A) correspond to the feature(s) observed in the data obtained from cryo-cooled crystals illuminated at 150 K (Fig. 5B and Fig. 4D), tentatively assigned to a bicarbonate (fig.

        <p>Common to all routes, photoexcitation triggers charge transfer (CT) from the substrate to the flavin. Interactions with two water molecules stabilize the anionic carboxylate substrate (1) (Fig. 6A). Removing these water molecules from the active site or rearranging Wat1 to form a hydrogen bond with flavin substantially decreases the energy of the CT state, i.e. of flavin radical anion and fatty acid radical (table S6). After Wat1 rearrangement, the CT energy is 15 kcal/mol lower than the excited-flavin energy (table S6). Concomitantly, electronic coupling between the flavin and substrate increases almost three fold reaching 47 meV (table S7), favoring transfer of an electron from the carboxylate. The formed carboxylic radical undergoes a barrierless decarboxylation (fig. S17) affording the alkyl radical (3). The energy of the alkyl radical intermediate is 52 kcal/mol above the dark state (1), which corresponds to more than 80% of the photon energy (Fig. 6B). CO2 dissociation increases the distance separation in the radical pair, and accordingly the electronic coupling between the alkyl and flavin radicals is only 7 meV (table S7).Common to all routes, photoexcitation triggers charge transfer (CT) from the substrate to the flavin.

        <p>From the alkyl radical (3), the alkane product (6/6a) can be formed via several reaction pathways (I-III in Fig. 6). The chemical changes characterizing pathways I-III are summarized in Fig. 6C. Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from a nearby residue has been discussed previously (4,24). Our results indicate strong interactions with the Y466 phenolic side chain (electronic coupling 142 meV; table S7) that may facilitate migration of the alkyl radical towards Y466 and C432. The HAT reaction from C432 (pathway I in Fig. 6) proceeds via an energy barrier (9 kcal/mol; fig. S18) and leads to a Cys-radical state (4) with a 15 kcal/mol lower energy than that of the alkyl radical intermediate (3). Re-oxidation of the flavin by C432 (5) further reduces the energy by 3 kcal/mol (Fig. 6B). The resulting thiolate anion is stabilized by a hydrogen bond with positively charged R451, however proton transfer from R451 to C432 in (5) along the hydrogen bond yielding (5a) does not further reduce the energy (table S5). Hence, it is likely that C432 re-protonation proceeds by a different mechanism (see below).From the alkyl radical (3), the alkane product (6/6a) can be formed via several reaction pathways (I-III in Fig. 6).

        <p>Alternatively to the HAT reaction involving C432, a proton can be transferred from Wat2 which stabilizes the alkyl radical (3). The shift of the negative charge from the flavin to the alkane by bET coupled to proton transfer from Wat2 leads to a transient formation of a hydroxyl anion which either interacts with CO2 forming bicarbonate (6a) directly (pathway III in Fig. 6), or it deprotonates R451 (5b) (pathway II in Fig. 6). The presence of CO2 and water molecules in the active site, in particular Wat1, allows R451 re-protonation concomitant with bicarbonate formation (6), even after the alkane is formed, with a small activation energy (4 kcal/mol; fig. S19). The bicarbonate product derived from Wat1 (6) is 10 kcal/mol lower than the bicarbonate originating from Wat2 (6a), rendering pathway II more energetically favorable than pathway III (Fig. 6B).Alternatively to the HAT reaction involving C432, a proton can be transferred from Wat2 which stabilizes the alkyl radical (3).

Our computations suggest that the red shift can be explained by formation of various species in which the initial negative charge of the deprotonated carboxylate (1) is either neutralized by formation of CO2 and deprotonated R451 (5) or shifted away from the flavin by formation of the anionic bicarbonate ( 6) and (6a) (fig.

        <p>Consistent with the X-ray structures, all active-site models contain the butterfly bending conformation of the flavin isoalloxazine ring. Flavin bending persisted during geometry optimization of the FAP active site models (Fig. 6A) in contrast to the essentially planar optimized geometry of the oxidized and semi-reduced forms obtained in computations of flavins (36). The significant bending angle in the optimized FAP active-site structures is consistent with the notion that interactions with the protein modulate flavin bending (37). As previously discussed, this bending biases the energy levels of the flavin, favoring flavin reduction (36) and decreasing the excitation energy (table S9) with possible functional implications. In particular, bending diminishes the vertical electron affinity even more than the excited-flavin energy (fig. S21), and by this, preferentially reduces the CT-state energy which should facilitate fET. Thus, flavin bending explains the strongly red-shifted (20 nm) ground-state FAD absorption spectrum of FAP in the dark state compared to free FAD or most flavoproteins allowing photo-excitation and facile fET up to as far as 530 nm. Importantly, this is well into the so-called 'green gap' (between 500 and 600 nm) in the absorption spectra of chlorophylls that dominate the absorption of algae, thus enhancing the net light-harvesting capacities of FAP.Consistent with the X-ray structures, all active-site models contain the butterfly bending conformation of the flavin isoalloxazine ring.

        <p>The active site of CvFAP contains three residues (Y466, C432 and R451) that are strictly conserved and specific to FAPs compared to other GMC oxidoreductases (fig. S23). Y466 and C432 were previously considered as hydrogen atom donor to the alkyl radical R • (followed by bET from FAD •-to the tyrosyl or cysteinyl radical) or, alternatively, proton donor in a proton-coupled back-ET from FAD •-to R • (4,24). Our quantum chemical calculations additionally suggest R451 as a potential proton donor. In order to identify the proton donor experimentally, we performed FTIR; in particular, we analyzed possible contributions from deprotonated forms of these three residues in the cryo-trapped red-shifted intermediate. Light-induced FTIR difference spectra of CvFAP recorded at 100K show only a shift of a v(S-H) IR mode of cysteine, and no changes in D2O compared to H2O that could be assigned to tyrosine vibrations, which does not support deprotonation of either of the two residues under conditions where the flavin red shift was observed (Fig. 4A panel vi and supplementary text S2). However, a strong negative band was observed at 1606 cm -1 in FTIR difference spectra recorded in D2O (Fig. 4A vii). In 15 N-labeled FAP samples, this band downshifted to 1597 cm -1 (Fig. 4A, viii). Both observations support assignment of the band to the guanidium IR mode of an arginine side-chain. Absence of a positive counterpart of this band after illumination is indicative of arginine deprotonation in the FADRS state at 100 K (supplementary text S2).The active site of CvFAP contains three residues (Y466, C432 and R451) that are strictly conserved and specific to FAPs compared to other GMC oxidoreductases (fig.

        <p>Mutation of C432 to serine (a much poorer proton and hydrogen atom donor) strongly affected the catalytic activity (Fig. 7A), as reported earlier by Heyes and coworkers, who considered it indicative of HAT from C432 to the alkyl radical R • in the WT protein (24). In contrast to these authors, we detected a low but significant catalytic activity (~ 10 % of WT) for the C432S mutant. Since impairment of the catalytic activity by a point mutation may result from structural changes rather than suppression of a direct function of the replaced residue, we examined the C432S mutant protein in more detail. The dark state crystal structure of C432S is highly similar to WT except for a new water molecule Wat3, interacting with S432 (2.7 Å) and the O1 oxygen atom of the fatty acid carboxylate (2.5 Å), which is rotated by ~ 42° (Fig. 7D). The distance of the carboxylate O2 to the flavin N5 increases from 4.0 Å in WT to 5.0 Å.Mutation of C432 to serine (a much poorer proton and hydrogen atom donor) strongly affected the catalytic activity (Fig. 7A), as reported earlier by Heyes and coworkers, who considered it indicative of HAT from C432 to the alkyl radical R • in the WT protein (24).

        <p>The time-resolved fluorescence signal of C432S resembles that of WT after the consumption of native substrate(s), however, the fluorescence decay is slightly (~10 %) accelerated (Fig. 7B), indicating that the signal reflects mostly intrinsic 1 FAD* decay (mostly due to intersystem crossing (ISC) (4)), with only a small contribution of competing fET to 1 FAD*. The intrinsic fET rate is about ten times slower than 1 FAD* decay in this mutant (see supplementary text S3). Transient absorption signals on the sub-ms time scale were hence dominated by the triplet (fig. S25F) and the formation of FADRS could not be resolved. There was, however, a small (~15% of WT) long-lived absorption change at 515 nm (where the transient flavin red-shift is most prominent in the WT). About two thirds of it decayed in a few milliseconds, i.e., with similar kinetics as FADRS in WT (see upper inset of fig. S25F or Fig. 3D in (24)). With these indirect indications of FADRS formation in C432S, we attempted to accumulate this species at a cryogenic temperature.

        <p>To better understand how R451 affects the active site architecture, we determined the crystal structure of the R451K mutant in its dark-state at 100 K (Fig. 7D and fig. S26C). The R451K mutant structure differs significantly from WT: while a new water molecule mimics the NH2 group of R451 and thereby retains the interaction with the O2 oxygen atom of the fatty acid carboxylate (2.5 Å), the interaction between K451 and the fatty acid O1 oxygen atom induces a ~54° rotation of the carboxylate and an increase by 0.6 Å of the distance of the fatty acid O2 to the flavin N5 compared to WT. This creates space for a new water molecule Wat3, akin to the situation in C432S, located between the fatty acid O1 atom (2.4 Å) and K451 (2.8 Å). The close distance of Wat3 and C432 induces a flip of the amino acid stretch T430 to G435, pushing C432 out of the active site and bringing in an additional water molecule. These large structural changes may explain the very different FTIR spectra obtained with the R451K mutant compared to WT (fig.

        <p>Three possible routes towards alkane formation in FAP were suggested by quantum chemistry (Fig. 6C). Our experimental findings allow assessing the suggested pathways. Pathway I, involving a HAT mechanism to reduce the alkyl radical, as also suggested previously (4,24), is chemically plausible. However, a number of experimental findings argue against it. First, the C432S mutant retains significant enzymatic activity, suggesting that C432 is not essential for catalysis. Second, in the FADRS state only a shift of a thiol S-H vibration is observed by FTIR but no cysteine deprotonation. Third, despite the fact that C432 is rotated out of the active site in the R451K mutant, this variant is quite active. While it is possible that C432 rotates back into the active site upon changes in the water structure following CO2 cleavage, this would not explain the threefold faster bET in R451K. Taken together, reaction pathway I (Fig. 6C) seems unlikely, although we cannot rule out that the C432S mutant uses a different mechanism than the WT enzyme. The observation of residual electron density consistent with bicarbonate close to C432 suggests that C432 may stabilize reaction products such as CO2 and/or bicarbonate away from the original position of the substrate carboxylate.Three possible routes towards alkane formation in FAP were suggested by quantum chemistry (Fig. 6C).

        <p>The other two pathways proceed via PCET (Fig. 6C). Pathway III implies a catalytic role of Wat2 in bicarbonate formation. This mechanism is unlikely, as no changes were observed for Wat2 in the electron density maps derived by TR-SFX. In contrast, 300 ns after photoexcitation a significant loss of electron density of Wat1 was observed, supporting Pathway II. With the cleaved CO2 present in the active site, as evidenced by cryocrystallography and IR spectroscopy, Wat2 can serve as a proton donor. The transiently deprotonated R451 activates Wat1, resulting in bicarbonate formation in less than 100 ns. This transformation of CO2 to bicarbonate is orders of magnitude faster than in solution (tens of seconds (38)) indicating a strong catalytic effect. R451's role as transient proton donor was a priori unexpected since proton transfers from and to arginine residues are rare (39,40) due to their relatively high pKa values. In FAP, the strong basicity of OH -formed from Wat2 by proton-coupled ET to the alkyl radical may allow proton transfer from R451. In addition to this catalytic function, R451 is crucial for the FAP active site architecture by precisely positioning and orienting the fatty acid head group with respect to FAD and stabilizing the carboxylate in the catalytically active deprotonated form.The other two pathways proceed via PCET (Fig. 6C).

        <p>Figure 8 and its legend summarize our comprehensive understanding of the strikingly complex cycle. By combining results obtained by a multitude of experimental techniques and computations, we provide a detailed mechanistic description of the evolution of the reactant (fatty acid) to the products (alka(e)ne and CO2) and the role of the protein moiety, involving a proton coupled electron transfer mechanism. We demonstrate partly unexpected structural and dynamic properties of FAP, including features that have not been observed in other flavoproteins and other enzymatic reactions in general. Understanding these catalytic features is an important step in incorporating FAP into the green chemistry toolkit.Figure 8 and its legend summarize our comprehensive understanding of the strikingly complex cycle.

        <p>Chlorella variabilis NC64A (CvFAP or single mutant of it) with an N-terminal truncation of 14 amino residues. This CvFAP corresponds to residues 76-654 of the full-length amino acid sequence. Site-directed CvFAP mutants C432A, C432S, R451A, R451K and Y466F were obtained by introducing point mutations in the previously reported FAP synthetic gene codonoptimized for E. coli expression (4). The primers used to generate the mutants and the truncated version of the CvFAP are listed in Table S3; for the C432S mutant, a part of the gene (between the MfeI and EcoRI restriction sites) was synthesized (Eurofins Genomics Germany GmbH), thereby introducing the mutation, and then exchanged. Coding sequences for CvFAP and its mutants were cloned into a pET-28 based expression vector containing his-tagged thioredoxin downstream the gene and recombinant proteins were expressed. The recombinant FAP and mutant proteins were produced in BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL E. coli cells (BL21-Rosetta (DE3) E. coli for the C432S mutant) cultured in TB medium at 37°C up to OD 1. At this stage, cultures were induced with 500 µM IPTG and the temperature was decreased to 17°C. Cells were grown for an additional 24 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000g for 30 min and the pellet was frozen. Purification of recombinant protein was performed as previously described (4). Briefly, cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM imidazole, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 0.25 mg mL -1 lysozyme, 20 mM MgSO4, 10 μg mL -1 DNase, and antiproteases (SIGMAFAST ™ Protease Inhibitor Tablets). After resuspension, cells were lysed by sonication (sonicator probe at a frequency of 20 kHz, four 45second cycles separated by a one-minute delay) and centrifuged during 30 min at 12,000g. The supernatant was collected and the enzyme was purified by FPLC. The first purification step was made using a nickel column. Tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease (at 1 mg per 20 mg total protein) was used to cut off the His tag and the thioredoxin. A dialysis was performed overnight in the presence of TEV protease to change the buffer to 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM imidazole, 5% (w/v) glycerol. A second FPLC chromatography step using a nickel column was made to separate the protein from the His-tagged thioredoxin. The last purification step made use of a gel filtration column HiLoad Superdex 200 (26/600 mm). Buffer used for this step contained 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 5% (w/v) glycerol. The protein was concentrated using Amicon ® Ultra Centrifugal filters (30 kDa), flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Protein concentration was calculated using absorbance at 280 nm taking into account the contribution of FAD.

        <p>FTIR spectra were recorded with an IFS 66 FTIR spectrometer (Bruker) equipped with a MCT-A detector and a KBr beam-splitter. Experiments at 100 or 150 K were performed using a TBT N2-flow cryostat equipped with quartz windows for transmission in the UV-Vis range and with a combination of CVD-Diamond and ZnSe windows for IR transmission. Illumination was achieved with a continuous 460 nm-emitting diode (Luminus PT39-B-L21). Light -minus -Dark difference spectra were obtained by subtraction of spectra recorded under illumination (Light) and before illumination (Dark). Scans (300 to 400 for each spectrum) were recorded at a 4 cm -1 resolution (acquisition time was between 1.5 and 2 minutes). Depending on the samples, spectra were recorded with one sample or with up to six samples (R451K mutant) and averaged to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Similar light-induced experiments were performed in the UV-Vis domain at 100 or 200 K using a Cary 100 spectrophotometer equipped with the TBT cryostat. Spectra were measured between 380 and 600 nm with 1 nm steps, using custom-made polyethylene cuvettes with a pathlength of 1 mm. Glycerol at a 70 to 85% (v/v) concentration was added to the concentrated FAP sample (final FAD concentration around 200 µM).

        <p>icOS experiments were performed on 100 × 100 × 100 μm 3 WT FAP crystals at room or cryogenic temperature. In the latter case, the crystal was either cryoprotected with glycerol or MPD (2-Methyl-2,4-pentanediol). The appearance of the FAPRS state was monitored at 100 K by following the evolution of the UV-Vis absorption spectrum of a FAP crystal under irradiation by a 470 nm LED at the icOS Lab (44). Similarly, this method was used to determine the dose resulting in a reduction of the FAD by following the evolution of the absorption spectrum from FADOX to FADRS. The half-dose of X-ray photoreduction of FAP crystals was determined to be ~40 kGy at room temperature (fig. S3) on beamline BM30A-FIP (42) using online UV-Vis absorption microspectrophotometry (48). Online Raman spectroscopy to monitor X-ray induced damage to the FAD was performed on a FAP crystal at 100 K on beamline ID29 (43), as previously described (49). Most of the peaks hardly show any decrease in their intensity (fig. S4B,C), in contrast with an online Raman study showing an X-ray-induced butterfly bending of a protein-encased flavin that comes with reduction and is accompanied by a decrease of Raman bands intensities (26). Only five stretching modes are affected upon progressive irradiation ( 4decreases, 1 increase) and are thus characteristic of the change in electronic structure of the FAD.icOS experiments were performed on 100 × 100 × 100 μm 3 WT FAP crystals at room or cryogenic temperature.

        <p>For experiments on the dependence of the transient absorption signal on the excitation power using picosecond pulses, the 1-mm thick β-barium borate (BBO) crystal used for frequency doubling of the 780-nm fundamental beam was replaced by a custom 20-mm thick BBO crystal (Eksma). In this way, the output energy was distributed over a 4-ps interval due to the group velocity mismatch between the 780-nm and 390-nm beams (58). Under conditions allowing a pulse energy up to 1.4 μJ at the level of the sample, the FWHM was found to be ~2.7 ps. Under these conditions, at 1.4 μJ some pre-continuum was generated in the sample, leading to modest distortion of the transient spectra up to ~500 nm. Results are shown in fig.

Only IR modes involving the carboxyl group of the substrate and products are expected to be significantly affected by this labeling.

Between 1800 and 1200 cm -1 , bicarbonate in solution is characterized by two main IR modes, the νas(CO) and νs(CO) modes at 1650 -1620 cm -1 and 1365 -1355 cm -1 , respectively, and by a small amplitude δ(COH) mode at 1300 -1250 cm -1 (108, 109). Upon 13 C labeling, frequency downshifts of -64 and -25 cm -1 were reported for the νas(CO) and νs(CO) modes of bicarbonate in solution. The frequency of the νas(CO) and νs(CO) modes and the frequency shifts upon 13 C-labeling are sensitive to the interactions (hydrogen bonding, ionic) formed by bicarbonate with its environment (109). In the 12 C -minus -13 C difference spectrum recorded with FAP at 150 K (Fig. 4A panel iv), positive bands at 1646 and 1352 cm -1 are downshifted to 1614 and 1318 cm - 1 upon 1-13 C-palmitate labeling. The bands' frequency and shifts upon 13 C-labeling are fully consistent with contributions of bicarbonate.

        <p>Contributions from protein side chain modes are also expected in the FTIR difference spectra. In particular, the cysteine sulfhydryl group contributes by its ν(SH) mode in a specific region of the FTIR spectra between 2700 and 2480 cm -1 , depending on the interactions formed by the sulfhydryl group and its environment (110,111). FTIR spectra in the spectral range where cysteine ν(SH) vibrations contribute show that, upon illumination of CvFAP at 100 or 150 K, a band shift occurs from ≈ 2540 (dark) to ≈ 2550 cm -1 (light) (Fig. 4A panel vi). This indicates that a SH group is present at 100 and 150 K, both in the Dark and Light states and that it undergoes a slight change in hydrogen bonding interactions (110,111). The lack of a negative band in this region suggests that there is no stable cysteine deprotonation after illumination at cryogenic temperatures.Contributions from protein side chain modes are also expected in the FTIR difference spectra.

        <p>Indeed, the negative band observed at 1606 cm -1 in D2O has no clear counterpart in the close-by region in H2O : it therefore results from a downshift in D2O of at least -30 cm -1 . In addition, this band is intense. To our knowledge, there is no other amino acid side chain that could show such a contribution in D2O (and not in H2O) in this spectral region. We can also exclude contributions from Amide II modes at this frequency since Amide II modes contribute usually in the 1580 -1500 cm -1 region in H2O, and are downshifted upon H/D exchange by about -100 cm -1 to the 1500 -1400 cm -1 region. The band at 1606 cm -1 is clearly a well defined, thin negative band present in the spectrum recorded with samples in D2O and not in H2O. This frequency value (1606 cm -1 ) is well above that expected for Amide II modes in D2O. To further support the proposed assignment, we produced fully 15 N-labeled FAP and recorded spectra with samples in H2O and D2O. The corresponding H2O -minus -D2O difference spectrum recorded at 100 K shows that the band at 1606 cm -1 is downshifted to 1597 cm -1 (Fig. 4A panel viii). This strongly supports the assignment of this band to an arginine side chain mode. In addition, it allows us to exclude the assignment of this band to an Amide I mode, since, upon 15 N-labeling, the Amide I bands are expected to shift only by a few wavenumbers (-1 to -3 cm -1 ) due to a small coupling between the v(C=O) mode and the NH in plane bending mode. Although FAP 15 N-labeling induces downshifts of bands of the H2O -minus -D2O spectrum in the 1703 -1686 cm -1 region and at 1644/1631 cm -1 (to 1638/1624 cm -1 ), we cannot assign some of these bands to arginine side chain modes, since contributions from Asn or Gln side chains cannot be excluded in this spectral range, as well as small downshifts of Amide I bands. However, the frequency and intensity of the band at 1606 cm -1 , the effect of H/D exchange and 14 N/ 15 N exchange on this band altogether point to a contribution from an arginine side chain mode in D2O at 1606 cm -1 .Indeed, the negative band observed at 1606 cm -1 in D2O has no clear counterpart in the close-by region in H2O : it therefore results from a downshift in D2O of at least -30 cm -1 .

        <p>The fluorescence kinetics of the WT CvFAP in the presence of the native substrate(s) (Fig. 3A, Fig. 7B and fig S25A ,B) show that the substrate quenches the singlet excited state 1 FAD*, shortening its lifetime from ~6.5 ns (typical time constant for unquenched flavins ( 115)) to ~300 ps (both in H2O and D2O, see Fig. 3A). Interestingly, fluorescence signals recorded in the presence of one or two native substrate molecules (see X-ray structures in Fig. 1) or even &gt;10fold excess of added substrate still contain a non-negligible contribution of the slow phase (corresponding to ~15% of the recorded signal amplitude). This suggests that there is always a certain fraction of enzymes that upon photoexcitation cannot undergo the productive fET step (inactive proteins), but in which the 1 FAD* undergoes intersystem-crossing (ISC) to a non-productive triplet state 3 FAD* (like in the absence of a substrate as shown previously (4)), which then decays back to the ground state FAD in ~80 𝜇s. Noteworthy, competition between fET and ISC in a homogeneous sample should lead to a monoexponential decay of the 1 FAD* fluorescence.

        <p>Reasons for the small fraction of inactive WT proteins can be diverse, ranging from an overstabilization of the carboxylate by a transient bidentate interaction with R451, to an incomplete occupation of the substrate binding site or an incomplete deprotonation of the substrate therein.Reasons for the small fraction of inactive WT proteins can be diverse, ranging from an overstabilization of the carboxylate by a transient bidentate interaction with R451, to an incomplete occupation of the substrate binding site or an incomplete deprotonation of the substrate therein.</p>
        <p>In the Y466F mutant, the time-resolved fluorescence signal (fig. S25B) is very similar to that of the WT protein. Apart from a slightly increased relative amplitude of the slower phase (indicative of a minor increase in the fraction of flavins that cannot undergo fET and eventually leading to a slightly lower enzymatic activity; Fig. 7A), 1 FAD* fluorescence quenching by ET from the substrate seems to occur with the same kinetics in Y466F as in WT (i.e., in ~300 ps). In the R451K mutant, 1 FAD* fluorescence decays significantly faster than in the WT after the consumption of the substrate (Fig. 7B). Due to the systemic initial perturbations in the signal caused by the detection system, we are not capable of distinguishing whether the decay is monophasic or biphasic in this case. A biexponential fit yields time constants of ~300 ps and ~5 ns, i.e., similar to those for the WT in the presence of substrate (~300 ps and ~6.5 ns), but with an inverse amplitude ratio (i.e., ~15% fast phase and ~85% slow phase). A monoexponential fit yields a time constant of ~4.5 ns (vs. ~6.5 ns for WT after substrate consumption). If we assume the decay is monoexponential and reflects two competing processes, fET and ISC, the rate constant kobs (= 1/τobs) is a sum of kfET + kISC. For τobs of 4.5 ns (R451K) and 6.5 ns (WT without substrate, i.e., 100% ISC), we obtain kobs of 2.2×10 8 s -1 and 1.54×10 8 s -1 , respectively. If we further assume that the kISC is the same in WT and in the mutant (which may or may not be the case; i.e., kISC = 1.54×10 8 s -1 ), we obtain kfET of 6.8×10 S25D) show that the R451K mutant is indeed partially active (~45% of WT, which would correspond to ~38% fET, since fET yield in WT is ~85%). The small difference in the two numbers (30% vs. 38%) could be explained in at least threeways: 1) kISC might be slightly slower in R451K than in WT, 2) the fET yield for the native substrates (in the fluorescence experiment) may be slightly lower than for the added ones (in the activity test), orIn the Y466F mutant, the time-resolved fluorescence signal (fig.

In any case, the observed decrease in both fET yield and enzymatic activity under steady-state illumination is likely due to an increased FAD-substrate distance (from 3.2 Å in WT to 4.6 Å in R451K) and to an 'overstabilization' of the fatty acid carboxylate by the presence of the additional water molecule Wat3 (see Fig. 7D).3) the recovery of the catalytic site (steps 5 to 7 of our photocycle, Fig. 8) might be slightly faster in the mutant than in the WT protein, which would not affect the yield of fET but it would increase the apparent enzymatic activity under continuous illumination conditions (as it seems to be the case for Y466F; see discussion in the supplementary text S4).

Partial consumption of the native substrates (by 10 strong flashes at 470 nm) slowed the fluorescence decay down to ~6.2 ns, addition of a five-fold excess of oleic acid, on the other hand, led to its minor acceleration to ~5.7 ns (not shown). Applying the same procedure for the estimation of intrinsic fET rate as we used for R451K above, the time constants of ~6.0 ns (C432S with native substrates) and ~5.7 ns (C432S in the presence of excess oleic acid) translate into kfET of 1.3×10 7 s -1 (τfET of ~80 ns) and 2.1×10 7 s -1 (τfET of ~50 ns), respectively, and fET yields of 8 and 12%, respectively.

        <p>On the contrary, the exchange of an H2O buffer to a D2O buffer had no impact on the amplitudes of the observed signals but it did substantially slow down the kinetics of both processes followed by transient absorption spectroscopy: the reoxidation of FAD •-to FADRS (from ~100 ns to ~200 ns; Fig. 3B) and the reversion of FADRS back to the "dark-state" FAD (from ~3 ms to ~10 ms; Fig. 3C). For the former process (FAD •-reoxidation), Heyes and coworkers (24) reported a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of only ~1.2 (lifetimes of ~180 ns and ~215 ns in H2O and D2O, respectively) at 520 nm and concluded that 'H-transfer events did not have a major effect on the rate of formation of the red-shifted flavin intermediate'. The origin of the deviation from our data (obtained at three different wavelengths, including 515 nm; see Fig. 3B) might be an insufficient time resolution in Ref. (24) that not only affected the faster kinetics (in H2O) more than the slower one (in D2O) but also made it difficult to discriminate the rise in a few hundreds of nanoseconds from the preceding much faster (step-like) rise due to FAD •- formation, that is not affected by the isotope exchange (compare Fig. 3A in Ref. (24) with our Fig. 3B (signals at 515 nm)). The much stronger KIE documented here argues for direct coupling of bET to a H + /H • transfer event. Note that an indirect coupling due to, e.g., structural changes in the substrate/flavin region induced by solvation of the protein in D2O instead of H2O cannot be reconciled with the absence of KIE on fET from the substrate to the excited flavin (Fig. 3A).On the contrary, the exchange of an H2O buffer to a D2O buffer had no impact on the amplitudes of the observed signals but it did substantially slow down the kinetics of both processes followed by transient absorption spectroscopy: the reoxidation of FAD •-to FADRS (from ~100 ns to ~200 ns; Fig. 3B) and the reversion of FADRS back to the "dark-state" FAD (from ~3 ms to ~10 ms; Fig. 3C). For the former process (FAD •-reoxidation), Heyes and coworkers (24) reported a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of only ~1.2 (lifetimes of ~180 ns and ~215 ns in H2O and D2O, respectively) at 520 nm and concluded that 'H-transfer events did not have a major effect on the rate of formation of the red-shifted flavin intermediate'. The origin of the deviation from our data (obtained at three different wavelengths, including 515 nm; see Fig. 3B) might be an insufficient time resolution in Ref. (24) that not only affected the faster kinetics (in H2O) more than the slower one (in D2O) but also made it difficult to discriminate the rise in a few hundreds of nanoseconds from the preceding much faster (step-like) rise due to FAD •- formation, that is not affected by the isotope exchange (compare Fig. 3A in Ref. (24) with our Fig. 3B (signals at 515 nm)). The much stronger KIE documented here argues for direct coupling of bET to a H + /H • transfer event. Note that an indirect coupling due to, e.g., structural changes in the substrate/flavin region induced by solvation of the protein in D2O instead of H2O cannot be reconciled with the absence of KIE on fET from the substrate to the excited flavin (Fig. 3A).</p>
        <p>The absence of a pH effect in the interval between 7.5 and 9.1 (fig. S10A,B) indicates that if these reaction steps (steps 3 and 5 in Fig. 8) involve PT (or HAT), the pKa of the proton or hydrogen atom donor lies outside of the tested pH interval (note that the pKa of the used Tris buffer is ~8.1; as the total buffer concentration was constant in these experiments, the concentration of its acidic and basic forms changed strongly with pH, but this did not affect the kinetics, indicating that Tris-buffer molecules are not directly involved). Finally, the lack of influence of the availability of a fresh substrate on the kinetics of FADRS reversion to the "darkstate" FAD (fig. S10C) suggests that the disappearance of the transient FAD red shift is not associated with binding of a new substrate.The absence of a pH effect in the interval between 7.5 and 9.1 (fig.

        <p>Like in the case of fluorescence signals (fig. S25B), transient absorption changes in the Y466F mutant on the sub-microsecond time scale reflecting bET/FADRS formation (fig. S25C) also resemble those obtained for the WT protein (Fig. 3B or fig. S10A), even though a moderate acceleration of bET can be noticed in Y466F. Together with the almost identical FTIR signals of WT and Y466F CvFAP (fig. S26A) and a high enzymatic activity of this mutant (Fig. 7A), all our results suggest that tyrosine Y466 does not directly participate in any of the PT/HAT or ET steps in the FAP photocycle. However, Heyes et al. (24) have shown that the decay of the FADRS species (step 5 in our photocycle; Fig. 8) is substantially accelerated in the Y466F mutant (we observed the same phenomenon -acceleration of the FADRS decay from ~3 ms in WT to ~300 μs in Y466F; data not shown). Heyes et al. suggest that it 'might reflect differences in local reorganization in the active site'. Alternatively, since the phenyl group of Y466 makes a hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl oxygen of T430 (O-O distance of 2.6 Å), serving as a "clasp" around the alkyl chain, one can also speculate that F466 (being incapable of such an interaction) is likely more flexible than Y466 and that the missing "clasp" might facilitate egress of the product chain through the tunnel (lined by the second FA) connecting to the solvent. This could allow for a faster recovery of the active site after the photoreaction (steps 5 to 7 in our photocycle; Fig. 8). According to fig. S10A in (24), the Y466F mutant seems to be a bit more active than WT in the first minutes of the activity test (under continuous illumination). Given that the quantum yield of fET is actually slightly lower in Y466F than in WT (the relative amplitude of the slower phase in the 1 FAD* fluorescence decay corresponding to futile ISC is a bit more pronounced in Y466F than in WT, see fig. S25B), this observation can only be explained in terms of a faster recovery of the active site in Y466F (combined with a faster photodegradation of the mutant protein).Like in the case of fluorescence signals (fig.

        <p>Transient absorption changes recorded for the R451K and R451A mutants on the submicrosecond timescale are shown in fig. S25D andE, respectively. In the signals of the R451K mutant, the amplitudes of the first kinetic phase (reflecting the reoxidation of FAD •-to FADRS) are considerably smaller than in WT CvFAP (corresponding to ~30% bET, judging from the signal at 488 nm, fig. S25D), but this process seems to be markedly accelerated (from ~100 ns in WT to ~30 ns in R451K; fig. S25D). While the 515 nm signal remains constant after the initial ~30 ns phase, we observe further partial reversion of the negative absorption change at 488 nm with a time constant of a few microseconds. The additional phase at 488 nm most probably corresponds to decay of free FAD triplet (characteristic 3 FAD* lifetime in solution is ~3 μs; note that the absorption change due to 3 FAD* should be much more pronounced at 488 nm than at 515 nm; see fig. S6D in (4)). Remarkably, in the (dark) crystal structure of the R451K mutant (Fig. 7D), the side chain of C432 changes its position so that its SH group recedes farther both from the FAD (from 6.9 Å to 9.6 Å) and from the C2 atom of the substrate (from 4.7 Å to 9.2 Å). If reduction of the alkyl radical were due to HAT from C432 followed by bET from FAD •- to the C432 radical (without large structural rearrangement following CO2 formation), one would expect the reoxidation of FAD •-to slow down in the R451K mutant. The opposite observation argues against both the hydrogen atom transfer from and the coupled back electron transfer to the C432 residue as the mechanism of alkyl radical reduction by FAD •-. On the other hand, the higher acidity of lysine should increase the driving force for a PT from the residue 451 (coupled to bET from FAD •-) to the alkyl radical in the arginine to lysine mutant.Transient absorption changes recorded for the R451K and R451A mutants on the submicrosecond timescale are shown in fig.

        <p>In the case of the R451A mutant, we observe essentially only step-like absorption changes at both selected wavelengths (fig. S25E), compatible with the formation of a proteinbound FAD triplet (with a lifetime of ~80 μs; see fig.

Yet, the signal at 515 nm in the R451A mutant shows a significant negative absorption change (instead of almost zero in WT after substrate consumption), which is probably caused by a pronounced (~8 nm) red shift in the 'dark state' FAD spectrum in R451A (see fig. S24D or inset of fig. S25E). The minor initial phase seen in the 488 nm signal (fig. S25E) likely reflects ISC from 1 FAD* to 3 FAD* (~8 ns; see fig.

        <p>Even though most crystalline proteins are biologically active, their reaction kinetics often differ from the solution state (116,117). In preparation for TR-SFX experiments, we assessed the kinetics of FAP in the crystalline and solution state by carrying out fluorescence-decay measurements. For solution experiments, the 6 mg mL -1 FAP solution was diluted to 0.375 mg mL -1 in buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.5, 100 mM NaCl). Experiments on crystalline FAP were carried out on a suspension of microcrystals (1% (v/v); each about 10 × 2 -5 × 2 -5 µm 3 in size) in 19% (w/v) PEG 4000, 100 mM Na citrate pH 5.5, 10 mM spermidine. Single photon counting fluorescence experiments were performed using an excitation pulse (400 nm) delivered by doubling (harmonic generator, SHG, APE) a femtosecond Ti:sapphire laser (800 nm, Coherent Chameleon Ultra II, 80 MHz, 180 fs) coupled to a pulse picker (APE, 4 MHz). Emission decays were measured using an FT200 Picoquant spectrometer and analyzed by the

        <p>By using a low excitation power (100 nW), a small excitation beam size (100 µm) and a large volume (2 mL) of sample that was constantly stirred, fluorescence spectra could be acquired for about 3 min without notable chromophore bleaching (as assessed by a UV-Vis absorption spectrum). The measured emission decay of 1 FAD* at 560 nm (fig. S15) was fitted by a weighted-sum of three exponentials. For FAP in solution, the retrieved time constants corresponding to three different FAD populations were 318 ps (± 5 ps), 980 ps (± 30 ps) and 3.9 ns (± 40 ps) with contributions of 76%, 16% and 8%, respectively. The first population corresponds to FAD undergoing efficient fET, the second to a population undergoing less efficient fET or being photobleached, and the last to a non-reactive population. For the crystal suspension, similar time constants were retrieved (320 ps, 1.45 ns, 4.8 ns) but with different contributions (62%, 14%, 24%), leading to an overall fluorescence decay that is slower in crystals than in solution (fig. S15). To assess whether the decrease in the population undergoing efficient fET in the crystal suspension (62%) compared to solution (72%) is due to the difference in pH (5.5 in crystals versus 8.5 in solution), the experiment was repeated on a FAP solution (0.375 mg mL -1 protein concentration) in the crystal buffer (19% (w/v) PEG 4000, 100 mM Na citrate pH 5.5, 10 mM spermidine). The contribution of the population with a fluorescence decay of 322 ps was 75%, indicating that it is the crystal packing and not the pH value that decreases the efficiency of fET in the microcrystal suspension from 72% to 62%.

This model was computed with the U-B3LYP method to obtain an estimate of the decarboxylation energy barrier for the fatty acid radical in the FAP active site. The relaxed geometry scan for the OCO bending coordinate indicates that CO2 dissociation from the fatty acid radical proceeds without any energy barrier, whereas the energy of the alkyl radical and CO2 products is substantially lower than the energy of the initial fatty acid radical.

        <p>We modelled bET for geometry (3) by continuing its geometry optimization in the closed-shell state with R-B3LYP. The optimization demonstrated an increase of interactions between Wat2 and alkane anion suggesting protonation of the alkane in concert with bET. This protonation yielded alkane and OH -anion that obtained a proton from R451 recovering Wat2 in geometry (5) (fig. S19). The energy of ( 5) is 27 kcal/mol higher than the energy of (1) (table S5) due to the presence of deprotonated R451, and hence, it is conceivable that (5) undergoes further stabilization (fig. S19). The energy decreases when Wat1 forms a hydrogen bond with R451 instead of Wat2. Further substantial stabilization by about 15 kcal/mol involves R451 protonation by Wat1 and bicarbonate formation from the hydroxyl anion OH -derived from Wat1 and CO2 (6). The energy barrier for (5) → ( 6) was estimated by relaxed energy scan calculations (fig. S19). The energy barrier for bicarbonate formation facilitated by re-protonation of R451 is about 4 kcal/mol. Bicarbonate formation might involve Wat2 instead of Wat1: the hydroxyl anion OH -derived from Wat2 directly binds CO2 (5b). The bicarbonate involving Wat2 is 10 kcal/mol less energetically favorable than formation involving Wat1.We modelled bET for geometry (3) by continuing its geometry optimization in the closed-shell state with R-B3LYP.

This protonation yielded alkane and OH -anion that obtained a proton from R451 recovering Wat2 in geometry (5) (fig. S19). The energy of ( 5) is 27 kcal/mol higher than the energy of (1) (table S5) due to the presence of deprotonated R451, and hence, it is conceivable that (5) undergoes further stabilization (fig. S19). The energy decreases when Wat1 forms a hydrogen bond with R451 instead of Wat2. Further substantial stabilization by about 15 kcal/mol involves R451 protonation by Wat1 and bicarbonate formation from the hydroxyl anion OH -derived from Wat1 and CO2 (6). The energy barrier for (5) → ( 6) was estimated by relaxed energy scan calculations (fig. S19). The energy barrier for bicarbonate formation facilitated by re-protonation of R451 is about 4 kcal/mol. Bicarbonate formation might involve Wat2 instead of Wat1: the hydroxyl anion OH -derived from Wat2 directly binds CO2 (5b). The bicarbonate involving Wat2 is 10 kcal/mol less energetically favorable than formation involving Wat1.</p>
        <p>The reaction scheme (Fig. 6C) highlights specific roles of Wat1 and Wat2 in the proposed catalytic mechanism. Alkane formation involves Wat2 and R451 as primary and secondary proton donors, respectively. However, deprotonated arginine is a high-energy species, and its reprotonation by either Wat1 or Wat2 followed by bicarbonate formation is energetically favorable. Irrespective of the origin, the bicarbonate is rather stable with respect to back conversion to CO2, since protonated R451 is a rather poor acid for bicarbonate destabilization (fig. S19). An alternative stronger acid cannot be suggested by our present computations.The reaction scheme (Fig. 6C) highlights specific roles of Wat1 and Wat2 in the proposed catalytic mechanism.

        <p>Thus, our calculations starting from high-resolution crystal structures suggest that FAP needs two waters, Wat1 and Wat2, interacting with the substrate at the active site for its functional mechanism. The distinct chemical roles of these waters are defined by their interactions at the active site. Wat1 facilitates fET by stabilizing the flavin radical anion whereas Wat2 serves as a primary proton donor during the alkane formation. In addition, both Wat1 and Wat2 may participate in the formation of the bicarbonate byproduct by interacting with R451 hence facilitating the unusual for arginine proton-donor function. According to our current active site model, Wat1 is slightly more preferred than Wat2 for bicarbonate formation.Thus, our calculations starting from high-resolution crystal structures suggest that FAP needs two waters, Wat1 and Wat2, interacting with the substrate at the active site for its functional mechanism.

        <p>Table S9 presents our computational results addressing the effect of bending on photoinduced fET. To study the effect of bending qualitatively, we modeled the geometric effect of the steric interactions in a simplified flavin model fixing the torsions around the C-N bonds of the middle ring to 160 or 150 degree during geometry optimization (corresponding to butterfly bending of 20 or 30 degree, respectively). This simple model does not account for electronic interactions between the flavin and protein, which contribute in addition to the steric constraints.Table S9 presents our computational results addressing the effect of bending on photoinduced fET.

        <p>In particular, the computations predict bicarbonate formation involving either Wat1 or Wat2 that may follow splitting of Wat2 coupled to bET. In both identified PCET pathways (II and III in Fig. 6), the hydroxyl derived from Wat2 is transiently formed at the bET step. This OH -either deprotonates R451 or interacts with CO2 yielding a bicarbonate. Such a partitioning reaction presumably leading to formation of the red-shifted species would be in line with the concomitant disappearance of the CO2 signal with formation of the red-shifted species observed by time-resolved IR (Fig. 2). In contrast, the reaction involving Wat1 to form bicarbonate is likely a sequential process following bET, and thus, it occurs in the flavin red-shifted state. The reaction involves a re-protonation of R451 by Wat1 leading to bicarbonate formation. In order to be consistent with the spectroscopic data, bicarbonate formation involving Wat1 would have to occur on a similar time-scale as the disappearance of the CO2 signal and formation of the redshifted species, which implies a very short lifetime of the deprotonated R451. Consistent with a rather small energy barrier stabilizing the deprotonated R451 state, the FTIR signal assigned to arginine deprotonation was observed only at 100 K but not at 150 K.In particular, the computations predict bicarbonate formation involving either Wat1 or Wat2 that may follow splitting of Wat2 coupled to bET.

        <p>While the sites of bicarbonate formation differ slightly for the partitioning reaction and sequential reaction, they are both close to the flavin and R451. In particular, hydrogen bonding with the protonated R451 is expected to stabilize the newly formed bicarbonate in either case. It is thus rather surprising that no electron density features consistent with bicarbonate were observed close to FAD and R451 in the cryocrystallography (Fig. 4D) or TR-SFX (Fig. 5A) data of illuminated crystals. Instead, electron density consistent with bicarbonate was observed very close to C432. This would imply that bicarbonate diffused there shortly after its formation, but the driving force for this process is unclear. Alternatively, bicarbonate might actually be formed close to C432 which would suggest that C432 has a catalytic role, e.g. involved in a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). In this case, the formed C432 radical would then be reduced by bET from FAD •-, resulting in a red-shifted oxidized flavin FADRS in ~100 ns. However, to be consistent with the absence of cysteine deprotonation in the FADRS form as assessed by cryotrapping FTIR (Fig. 4A), this bET would have to be coupled to protonation of the C432 anion (within the ~100 ns phase). Furthermore, the acceleration of bET/red shift formation in the R451K mutant occurring in spite of the unfavorable orientation of the C432 side chain for HAT to the alkyl radical and bET from FAD The overall shape of the transient spectra is very similar for 100 and 250 nJ, but only at higher powers in the range 520-620 nm decay of a more positive signal between 2 ps and 14 ps is observed (A-B). Consistently, whereas the global analysis of the data in terms of a multiexponential model required only a 300-ps and a constant phase at low energy (as with the low-energy 100-fs excitation pulses, fig. S6D), a ~3 ps additional phase was required for high energy (panel C-D; the strong wiggles around 470, 550 and 630 nm in the 3-ps EAS correspond to cross-phase modulation artifacts that are difficult to eliminate from the fit given that the pulse width is similar to the 3-ps rise time). The spectral evolution associated with this phase (difference between 3-ps and 300-ps EAS) has a similar shape as the FAP fluorescence spectrum (black line) suggesting it represents a rise in the stimulated emission. Altogether it appears that under multiphoton excitation there is a ~3 ps rise component of the S1→S0 emission, whereas it occurs instantaneously at sub-stoichiometric excitation. We assign this to excitation to higher electronic levels by absorption of multiple photons, and subsequent internal conversion to and cooling in the S1 level. These processes occur on a much shorter timescale than the ~300 ps ET time that appears not sensitive to the excitation power. The small differences in shape of the 1ns spectra (long-lived component) at 1400 nJ and 250 nJ can be assigned to a fraction of longlived FAD* due to substrate depletion at very high excitation power. No evidence was found for further flavin photoproducts. 2), the CT-fatty acid energy is 1.87 eV (table S6). Hence, interactions with Wat 3 stabilise the fatty acid COO-group also after Wat1 rearrangement, yet the CTfatty acid energy is lower than the flavin ππ* energy.While the sites of bicarbonate formation differ slightly for the partitioning reaction and sequential reaction, they are both close to the flavin and R451.

        <p>The model for the Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations was built using the '100 K dark' structure of FAP obtained in this work. The FAD cofactor in the oxidized state and two stearic acids (STE) present in the crystal structure were included in the model. The simulations included protein residues within a 24 Å sphere, centered on the N5 atom of the bound FAD cofactor in the crystal structure. Protein atoms between 20 and 24 Å from the sphere's center were harmonically restrained to their experimentally determined positions. Protonation states of histidines were assigned by visual inspection and ideal stereochemistry; protonation states of other residues were assigned using PROPKA (81,82). In addition to crystal waters, a 71-Å cubic box of water was overlaid, and waters overlapping with the protein, FAD, two STE's and crystal water molecules were removed. Periodic boundary conditions were assumed; i.e. the entire 71-Å box was replicated periodically in all directions. All long range electrostatic interactions were computed by the particle mesh Ewald method (83). No counterions were included as the system was electrically neutral. MD simulations were performed at constant temperature (300K) and pressure, after 200 ps of thermalization. The CHARMM36 force field (84,85) was used for the protein and the modified version of the TIP3P water model (85)(86)(87). The force field parameters for the FADOX cofactor developed recently were used (27). Calculations were done with the

S4B,C) suggest that FAD is in a bent conformation in the initial oxidized state (bending angle is 13.7° in the 'RT dark LD'). FAD bending in the oxidized state is also supported by a molecular dynamics simulation using a recently developed flavin force field (27) that yielded an oxidized FAD cofactor bent on average by about 20° (fig.

        <p>Based on our initial characterizations of the FAP photocycle by transient absorption spectroscopy (4), we have chosen three characteristic wavelengths to monitor FAD-associated spectral changes following its photoexcitation in WT and mutant CvFAP: 376 nm, where FAD •- absorbs more strongly than oxidized FAD (observation of FAD •-formation and decay); 488 nm, where the FAD •-anion absorption is weaker than that of oxidized FAD (observation of FAD absorption bleaching and its recovery upon FAD •-reoxidation); and finally 515 nm, where FAD •-absorbs more than oxidized FAD but less than the red-shifted re-oxidized FAD (observation of FAD •-formation and its conversion into FADRS on the sub-μs timescale, and the subsequent decay of FADRS back to the "dark-state" FAD on the ms timescale). Consumption of the native substrates by saturating flashes at 470 nm (in the absence of added substrate) did, as expected, lead to a decrease in the amplitude of the signals recorded on the ms timescale but their kinetics remained essentially unaffected (fig. S10C).Based on our initial characterizations of the FAP photocycle by transient absorption spectroscopy (4), we have chosen three characteristic wavelengths to monitor FAD-associated spectral changes following its photoexcitation in WT and mutant CvFAP: 376 nm, where FAD •- absorbs more strongly than oxidized FAD (observation of FAD •-formation and decay); 488 nm, where the FAD •-anion absorption is weaker than that of oxidized FAD (observation of FAD absorption bleaching and its recovery upon FAD •-reoxidation); and finally 515 nm, where FAD •-absorbs more than oxidized FAD but less than the red-shifted re-oxidized FAD (observation of FAD •-formation and its conversion into FADRS on the sub-μs timescale, and the subsequent decay of FADRS back to the "dark-state" FAD on the ms timescale).

        <p>Formation of the alkyl and flavin radicals in the FAP active site was modeled starting from the coordinates of the partially optimized geometry (2) containing Wat1 hydrogen bonded to flavin N5. The OCO angle in the fatty acid was increased to 160 degrees and the geometry was optimized in the triplet state (unpaired electrons on the alkyl and flavin radicals) using the U-B3LYP method. Optimization led to CO2 dissociation. Changing the coordinates of the alkyl radical in order to decrease the distance between the CH2(rad) center and Y466 side chain (which is suggested by the substantial electronic coupling of these radicals; 142 meV in table S7) followed by geometry optimization yielded structure (3). The flavin geometry remained bent in the radical-anion state.The excited-state calculations (table S11) demonstrate that the diradical CT state becomes the ground state of structure (3) whereas the closed-shell (CS) state, corresponding to bET, is more than 3 eV above the CT diradical state. Two electronic transitions (0-1) and (0-2) with high oscillator strengths predict the flavin radical absorption to be redshifted compared to the oxidized flavin which is consistent with spectroscopy data on FAP and other flavoproteins.Formation of the alkyl and flavin radicals in the FAP active site was modeled starting from the coordinates of the partially optimized geometry (2) containing Wat1 hydrogen bonded to flavin N5.
