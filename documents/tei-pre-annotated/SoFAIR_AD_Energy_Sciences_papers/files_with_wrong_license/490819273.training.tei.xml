        <p>Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to human activities have significantly caused climate change since the Industrial Revolution. China aims to achieve its carbon emissions peak before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060. This paper attempts to review and discuss technical strategies to achieve the "dual-carbon" targets in Chinese metal mines. First, global carbon emissions and emission intensity from metal mining industries are analysed. The metal mining status and carbon emissions in China are then examined. Further, advanced technologies for carbon mitigation and carbon sequestration in metal mines are reviewed. Finally, a technical roadmap for achieving carbon-neutrality in Chinese metal mines are proposed. It has been found that some international giants have already made carbon reduction targets and planned to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Moreover, improving mining efficiency by developing advanced technologies and replacing fossil fuel with renewable energy are two key approaches to reducing GHG emissions. Green mines can significantly benefit the carbon neutrality process for metal mines through carbon absorption of reclamation vegetation. The geothermal energy extraction from operating and abandoned metal mines is a promising technology for providing clean energy and contributing to the carbon neutrality target for Chinese metal mines. Carbon sequestration by mining backfill and tailing through mineral carbonation has the potential to permanently and safely store carbon dioxide, which can eventually transform the metal mining industry to become carbon neutral or even carbon negative.</p>
        <p>The atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gas (GHG) have increased significantly since the industrial revolution began. GHG emissions related to human activities have caused approximately 1.0°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels [1]. The world's governments have approved a special report through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on limiting the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels [1]. It was estimated that global emissions should be reduced by 7.6% every year for the next decades to meet the 1.5°C increase target [1].</p>
        <p>China announced to have CO 2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060 at the general debate of the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2020 [2]. After China's pledge to carbon neutrality before 2060, the roadmap to achieve the goal is getting clearer. By 2030, China aims to lower its carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by over 65% from that in 2005 [3]. The "dual carbon" targets will bring an extensive and profound systemic reform for the economy and society. Moreover, technologies related to carbon neutrality has become research hotspots in China and other major economic countries. Therefore, it is necessary to review and discuss how to achieve the carbon-peak and carbon-neutrality for each industrial sector.</p>
        <p>GHG emissions from mining can be divided into three scopes. Scope 1 is the direct emissions from mining operations including the consumption of fossil fuel and GHG leaking. Scope 2 is the indirect emissions from electricity purchased and used by mining operations. Scope 3 is all other indirect emissions from upstream and downstream activities related to purchased or sold goods and services [4].</p>
        <p>The scope 3 emissions occur from sources out of control (e.g., emissions from processing mined iron ore to steel). In the past decades, considerable researches have been carried out on estimating GHG emissions from the mining industry. Northey Technology strategies to achieve carbon-peak and carbon-neutrality for Chinese metal mines 11 countries and found the range of GHG emissions was 1-9 t CO 2 e/t Cu, with an average of 2.6 t CO 2 e/t</p>
        <p>Cu [4]. They pointed out that the large variation is mainly caused by the copper produced, ore grade, fuel sources, and electrical energy. A decline in ore grade generally resulted in higher GHG emissions intensity [4]. Li [5] analysed the current situation and development trends of coal consumption and carbon emissions in China and discussed the main problems associated with the green and low-carbon development and utilisation of coal. Yang et al. [6] investigated GHG emissions in the Pingshuo coal mining area and found coalbed methane emissions and fuel consumption accounted for 46.66% and 41.79%</p>
        <p>of the total emissions, respectively. Azadi et al. [7] estimated GHG emissions from metal and mineral productions were equivalent to approximately 10% of the total global energy-related greenhouse gas emissions in 2018.</p>
        <p>To achieve the carbon-neutrality for the mining industry, some researchers studied the benefit of current mining technologies on carbon emission reduction. Liu et al. [8] compared the energy consumption and carbon emissions for different modes of transportation in open-cut coal mines. They found the CO 2 emissions from truck transportation were three to ten times higher than that from the belt conveyor. Carmichael et al. [9] explored the relationship between the optimal unit cost and the optimal unit carbon emissions for surface mining and found that mining operations optimisations on truck size, payload, fuel use, and travel and loading times can coincidently reduce the unit cost and emissions. Zhang et al. developed a model to calculate the carbon sink from mine land reclamation and found that the reclamation in the Huaibei mining area can absorb 1.68×10 5 t CO 2 per year [10].</p>
        <p>Further, some new mining concepts or technologies were recently proposed to achieve the carbonneutrality of the mining industry. Martens et al. developed an electrokinetic in-situ leaching method for copper mining, which can significantly reduce the environmental carbon footprint [11]. Wu et al.</p>
        <p>Technology strategies to achieve carbon-peak and carbon-neutrality for Chinese metal mines proposed a conception of in-situ fluidisation mining for deep metal mines [12]. Xie et al. [13] and Yuan et al. [14] proposed to utilise abandoned coal mines as underground spaces for mining garden construction, oil and gas storage, underground laboratory, hospital, planting, pumped-storage power, etc.</p>
        <p>Li and Hitch developed technologies to sequestrate carbon by mine tailings [15]. Shao et al. proposed to establish an integrated system for underground mining-processing-dressing in Angang mines, which can significantly reduce the mining cost [16]. Bao et al. investigated the geothermal energy extraction from an abandoned copper mine in the USA and introduced a demonstration project to use mine water for heating a 1,394 m 2 building [17].</p>
        <p>In China, underground metal mines account for 90% of the total metal mines and the mining depth is becoming deeper [18]- [20]. Moreover, the average ore grades of some key minerals (e.g., iron) are significantly lower than the global average grades [19]. These could pose a huge challenge for achieving carbon-neutrality in Chinese metal mines. To date, there is no review on technical strategies to achieve "dual carbon" targets in Chinese metal mines. This paper attempts to review and discuss GHG emissions and carbon-related technologies for metal mining. The global GHG emissions from metal mining and GHG emissions targets from some international mining giants are collected and discussed.</p>
        <p>It is well-known that metal mining industries have cuased significant environmental issues, e.g.,</p>
        <p>Technology strategies to achieve carbon-peak and carbon-neutrality for Chinese metal mines vegetation destruction, water pollution, soil contamination, etc. In the past century, great achievements were made to solve the environmental issues caused by metal mining. In the meantime, metal mining activities will continue to develop and increase to provide more metal for human demands. To tackle the huge challenge of climate change, the reduction of GHG emissions from metal mining are attracting more attention from researchers and industries. Figure 1 illustrates the global mineral and metal productions and estimated GHG emissions related to metal mining in 2018. The production data are from the US Geological Survey, the British Geological Survey and the GHG emission data are from the emission contributions of mining to emissions of metal life cycle stages including mining, purification, and refining [7], [21]. It can be seen that iron mining of around 1,200 million tonnes contributed carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) of 1,800 million tonnes, which was the largest emissions for metal mining in 2018. The estimated GHG emissions from metal mining (about 3.6 Gt CO 2 e) are approximately 10% of the total energy-related GHG emissions [7]. The ratio of GHG emissions to the corresponding production varies from different minerals and metals. For example, the GHG emissions for producing one-tonne iron is much smaller than that for producing one-tonne Al, Au and Mg. The differences are caused by the mining processes and ore grades. For iron mining, diesel consumption for hauling and loading is a major contributor to its GHG emissions. However, for gold mining, more energy is consumed for crushing and grinding, which contributes to more GHG emissions. Besides the difference in GHG emissions per unit mass, the values or prices of minerals are significantly different. Therefore, the GHG emissions per unit value should also be considered. World Gold Council [22] summarised the rank of emissions intensity per unit value for primary metals from high to low: aluminium, steel, zinc, gold, copper and lead, and the rank of emissions intensity per unit mass from high to low: gold, aluminium, copper, zinc, steel and lead. Therefore, GHG mitigation of metal mining is an important part of global Under the pressure of GHG emissions mitigation, some international mining giants have proposed their GHG emission targets.</p>
        <p>China is one of the most historical countries on metal mining and is also one of the few countries in the world with complete types and abundant reserves of metal mineral resources. However, there are more mines with lean ore but fewer mines with rich ore in China [28][29]. For example, the average iron ore grade in China is 33.5% which is smaller than that in the world by 10%. Moreover, 90% of Chinese metal mines are underground mines, and the proportion of underground mining is still increasing due to the exhaustion of shallow resources. Figure 2 shows sixteen Chinese metal mines with a mining depth larger than 1000 m [19]. The deepest mine is located in Henan Province, with a mining depth of 1600 m. Only one of the deep mines is iron mine and others are non-ferrous mines. It is predicted that one-third of nonferrous metal mines will reach or exceed the mining depth of 1000 m [19]. The high in-situ stress and high temperature in deep mines will unavoidably increase the construction and maintenance cost and the consumption of materials. Moreover, the energy consumed by hauling and loading will also be increased due to longer transportation and hoist distances. Therefore, the energy consumption intensity for metal mining in China may continue to grow under the current mining technologies, posing a larger challenge for carbon neutrality in Chinese metal mines.</p>
        <p>Technology strategies to achieve carbon-peak and carbon-neutrality for Chinese metal mines</p>
        <p>For coal mining, GHG emissions from methane can account for nearly half of the total emissions [32].</p>
        <p>While for metal mining, most GHG emissions are energy-related emissions. Therefore, a fundamental philosophy to carbon mitigation in metal mining is improving mining efficiency and replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy. Figure 4 illustrates the pathways for carbon mitigation by improving energy efficiency. From the construction to operations of metal mines, improving mining efficiency and using more low-carbon energy should be thoroughly considered. More sustainable mining methods, including backfill mining, in-situ leaching mining, etc., should be employed with priority [33]- [35]. Backfill mining can avoid surface movement, which reduces the impact of land footprint. Wu et al. [36] and Martens et al. [11] proposed advanced in-situ leaching methods, which markedly reduced environmental footprint. Further, the carbon cost could be calculated to determine the cut-off grade. Moreover, production processes of raw materials, including cement, concrete, bolts and supports, will generate carbon emissions. Reasonably reducing the raw materials consumption will also benefit carbon mitigation. For drilling and blasting, drilling optimisation and precision blasting can save the cost and from follow-up mining processes [37], [38]. For loading and hauling, the diesel trucks and equipment not only produce more carbon but also affect the air of working faces. The GHG emissions can be significantly mitigated by electrification, automation, and intelligence of mining equipment and trucks.</p>
        <p>Fankou Lead-Zinc Mine tested the intelligent mining technology with an unmanned underground scraper, a mining truck, a rock-drilling jumbo, and a down to hole drill and found intelligent mining can reduce the number of field operations and the discharge of mine solid waste [39]. There are some common technologies to improve the energy efficiency in metal mining: digital</p>
        <p>mine, automation, 5G, big data, digital twin, smart mining, electrification of mining equipment and trucks, continuous mining, integration of mining-processing-backfilling, etc. The techniques or concepts were previously proposed to achieve safe and efficient mining. Here we are focused on considering the lowcarbon benefits induced by the above technologies.</p>
        <p>As introduced in Figure 2, underground mining in China has experienced increasing exploitation depth.</p>
        <p>In the next decade, many metal mines will go to the depth of 1000 m and the deepest will be between 2000-3000 km. As a consequence, the mining activities have encountered elevated heat problems. The heat can negatively impact the performance, overall productivity, and safety of the workforce. Many efforts have been made to reduce the mine temperature, such as improving the ventilation system, transferring ice to the working face or even temperature protective apparel [19]. However, the existing methods are all very costly or inefficient. The heat in deep metal mines is also a kind of green energy, i.e., geothermal energy. Some researchers proposed to extract geothermal energy from deep mines.</p>
        <p>Preene and Younger introduced the existing geothermal systems in mines and suggested the potential heat reservoirs associated with mine sites [42]. [47].</p>
        <p>Further, we propose to simultaneous extract mining resources and geothermal energy. Figure 5 A</p>
        <p>Technology strategies to achieve carbon-peak and carbon-neutrality for Chinese metal mines illustrates the concept of simultaneous extraction of resources and geothermal energy. First, the heat resources are surveyed in the deep mines. A cavern-like space is excavated as the heated water reservoir to store the heat energy in the tunnels. Under the cavern, a number of parallel wells are drilled. Then the rocks surrounding these wells are fractured to generate the controllable fracture network for maximining the heat-conducting supply for the reservoir. A pulsating fracking technique can be employed to optimise the fracture netwroks and reduce the risk of seismicity [48], [49]. The heated water reservoir is then connected with heat-conducting pipes to harvest the heat through the pipes to the power station. The extracted geothermal energy can be used for local heating or collected to generate electricity. Actively controlling the mining temperature and using the abundant heat for energy will significantly mitigate GHG emissions in Chinese metal mines.</p>
        <p>With the exhaustion of resources after mining for a long period, many mines will be closed or abandoned.</p>
        <p>It was estimated there are more than 40,000 closed coal mines in China [50]. Abandoned mines can be treated as a kind of resource. Xie et al. proposed to employ abandoned underground mines as special underground spaces for mining garden construction, oil and gas storage, underground laboratory, hospital, planting, pumped-storage power, etc. [13], [50].</p>
        <p>Technology strategies to achieve carbon-peak and carbon-neutrality for Chinese metal mines and utilisation of abandoned mines [14]. Further, Xie et al. concluded three key technologies for the utilisation of abandoned mines, i.e., safety assessment of abandoned mines, construction of abandoned mines for different utilisation purposes and comprehensive control of subsurface environment [50].</p>
        <p>Moreover, the long-term durability and stability of underground structures should be carefully considered for utilising abandoned mines. The proposed concepts and practices significantly enhanced the development of abandoned coal mines utilisation in China [13], [14], [50], [51].</p>
        <p>Besides the utilisation of abandoned mines mentioned in [13], [14], [50], [51], extracting geothermal energy from abandoned mines also attracts much attention. In the USA, a geothermal energy station was built in an abandoned copper mine located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan for house heating [17]. In Canada, an open-loop geothermal system utilising the mine water from the Goyer Quarry was developed to supply heating and cooling to 36 apartments [52]. In the UK, the British Geological Survey and Coal Authority fully investigated the heat potential from abandoned coal mines in 2020 [53].</p>
        <p>And it was estimated around 2.2 million GWh of heat could be provided by the flooded abandoned coal mines, which will contribute to a net-zero carbon society [53]. Moreover, the UK government has funded more than 10 million pounds to study extracting geothermal energy from the flooded abandoned mines since 2020. It is worth investigating how to utilise abandoned metal mines for geothermal energy in China. The utilisation of abandoned metal mines will contribute to a low-carbon metal mining industry.</p>
        <p>It is necessary to sequestrate carbon for metal mining achieving carbon neutrality. The concept of "green mining" and "green mines" have already existed since the 19th century in many countries [54]. Green mines have also been practised in Chinese metal mines for many years. Green mines improve environmental efficiency and maintain the mining industry's competitiveness over the entire life cycle A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t N o t C o p y e d i t e d [54]. Here, we focus on the effect of the land reclamation in green mines on carbon sequestration capacity.</p>
        <p>The amount of carbon stored in terrestrial vegetation is a key component of the global carbon cycle [55].</p>
        <p>Trees and other vegetation in green mines can absorb a considerable amount of carbon. Since 2011, more than 600 mines have been recognised as green mines construction pilot programs, of which 303 are metal mines [56]. Zhang et al. developed a model to calculate the carbon sink from mine land reclamation and found a square hectometer (hm 2 ) of reclamation woodland can absorb 1.44×10 5 kg CO 2 per year [10].</p>
        <p>Table 2 lists the areas of reclamation and estimated carbon sequestration capacity in some Chinese metal mines. The carbon sequestration capacity is calculated based on the unit absorbability of reclamation woodland (i.e., 1.44×10 5 kg/hm 2 ) [10]. By multiplying the carbon price of 50 Yuan/ton, the total value of the mine land reclamation on carbon emission can reach 27.7 million Yuan every year. Therefore, carbon targets attribute new values to green mines. More efforts should be taken to construct green mines from Chining metal mining industry.</p>
        <p>Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is believed the primary option to limit the temperature rise to 1.5 ℃ relative to pre-industrial levels because CCS could reduce 85-90% of CO Mineral carbonation is regarded as a permanent and safe way for carbon storage because it will not cause carbon leakage. The potential of mineral carbonation is estimated to be 10-15% of the total carbon emissions [66]. Since the mineral carbonation concept was proposed, many researchers have tried to store CO 2 by different minerals from different industries. Xie et al. proposed to use MgCl 2 to store CO 2 and produce magnesium carbonate and hydrochloric acid [67]. Moreover, the heat produced by mineral carbonation can also be collected as power [67]. Xi et al. found that the carbonation of cement materials over their life cycle represents a large and growing net sink of CO 2 (0.25 Gt in 2013) [68]. Chen et al. employed fly ash to absorb CO 2 and found the modified sorbents achieved a CO 2 capture capacity of 0.27 g CO 2 /g sorbent [69]. Forkers developed accelerated carbonation equipment to cure cemented-based materials and the equipment can process 50 tonnes of construction materials every hour [70]. Moreover, the concrete cured in CO 2 had a 45% higher strength than that cured in the N 2 atmosphere [70]. Most mining backfill is a kind of cement-based materials consisting of cement, fly ash, tailings and solid waste.</p>
        <p>According to existing researches on mineral carbonation in concrete, geopolymer and other construction materials, there may be a great potential to store CO 2 in mining backfill. If the carbon dioxide can be stored in the backfill, metal mines will be possible to become negative carbon mines.</p>
        <p>Besides mineral carbonation in cemented-based materials, some researchers proposed to sequestrate carbon in tailings. Li and Hitch pointed out that the suitable mines for mineral carbonation are the Technology strategies to achieve carbon-peak and carbon-neutrality for Chinese metal mines ultramafic rock-hosted ore deposits of chrysotile, nickel, chromium, diamond and platinum [15], [63].</p>
        <p>They experimentally found that the CO 2 sequestration conversions of mechanically-activated olivine and mine waste are 22.5% and 31.5%, respectively [15].</p>
        <p>Chinese metal mining industry and research community should take effective actions to achieve China's "dual carbon" targets. Figure 6 illustrates a brief technical roadmap for achieving carbon-neutrality in Chinese metal mines. Some existing and mature technologies should be taken as current actions. First, the GHG emissions data for metal mines should be studied and collected. Every large and medium-sized mine can establish its GHG emission database which is the basis for GHG management and plan. Further, advanced mining methods and technologies can be employed to improve mining efficiency, including backfill mining, digital mine, automation, 5G, big data, smart mining, electrification of mining equipment and trucks, continuous mining, and integration of integration mining-processing-backfilling, etc. Moreover, the consumption amount of fossil fuel should be reduced and more renewable energy can be used. For example, wind energy and solar energy can be in-situ developed and utilised by metal mines.</p>
        <p>Importantly, more attention should be paid to green mines during the whole life-cycle of mines. By the</p>
        <p>The "dual carbon" targets, i.e., carbon-peak before 2030 and carbon-neutrality before 2060, are a solemn promise of the Chinese government to the World. The metal mining industry and research community should effectively contribute to the "dual carbon" targets by constructing and maintaining low-carbon and carbon-neutrality mines. This paper reviewed GHG emissions from metal mining industries and discussed the technical strategies for carbon-peak and carbon-neutrality in Chinese metal mines.</p>
        <p>Conclusions can be drawn as follows:</p>
        <p>(1) GHG mitigation of metal mining is essential for achieving carbon neutrality in China. The GHG emissions and its intensity vary from the mineral types. Iron mining contributed to the largerst amount of carbon emission in metal mining. The emission intensity per tone ore for gold mining is the highest.</p>
        <p>(2) Some international giants, including Anglo American, BHP, Glencore, Rio Tinto and Vale, have made carbon targets and plans to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050. With the metal mining depth increasing in China, the energy consumption intensity may continue to grow under the current mining technologies, posing an even bigger challenge for carbon neutrality in Chinese metal mine sector.</p>
        <p>(3) Improving mining efficiency is the fundemantal way to reducing GHG emissions. Some common technologies (e.g., digital mine, automation, 5G, big data, smart mining, electrification of mining equipment and trucks, continuous mining, integration of mining-processingbackfilling, etc.) should be explored further to achive the safe mining and carbon mitigation.</p>
