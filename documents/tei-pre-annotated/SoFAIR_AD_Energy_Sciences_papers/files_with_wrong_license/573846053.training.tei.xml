        <p>Solar assisted air source heat pump shows great potential as a promising energy-saving heating technology, which integrates solar collector and air source heat pump. It is widely considered for supplying hot water, space heating and/or space cooling in the domestic sector. The performance of solar assisted air source heat pumps can be evaluated in system level by parameters such as coefficient of performance, seasonal performance factor, energy consumption, solar fraction as well as initial and operating costs, and in component level by parameters such as efficiencies of solar collection and thermal energy storage. Their performances are affected by many factors such as system configuration, components size, working fluid, working conditions and weather conditions. This paper presents a comprehensive review on the recent advances in solar assisted air source heat pump for the domestic sector in terms of system configuration, solar collectors, thermal energy storage, defrosting method and the perspective areas of further investigations. The results of this review confirm that research is still required to improve the performance of such a combined system and reduce initial cost compared with existing heating systems based on hydrocarbon combustion. The information presented in this paper is beneficial to the researchers, small and medium-sized enterprises suppling renewable energy system technologies, heating engineers and service workers, energy policy and decision makers, environmental activists and communities.</p>
        <p>• A comprehensive review has been done for solar assisted air source heat pump.</p>
        <p>• Solar collectors, thermal energy storage and defrosting methods are briefly reviewed.</p>
        <p>• The performance data of different type heat pumps are compiled and compared.</p>
        <p>• Evolutions require new-generation energy efficiency and green refrigerants.</p>
        <p>Heat pumps (HPs) can be considered as both energy efficient and renewable energy technology [1]. The use of this technology to increase buildings energy efficiency by utilizing low-grade thermal energy from existing heating supply systems is of significant interest today. However, to significantly reduce energy consumption and to improve the performance of HPs, many studies are devoted to increasing the share of renewable energy. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), worldwide, thermal energy accounts for more than 50% of energy consumption, with about 45% consumed in residential and commercial buildings [1]. In the UK, heating took up 48% of the total energy consumption in 2013, and the domestic sector accounted for 57% of the entire heating demand [2]. Emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and air pollutants during heat provision from hydrocarbon combustion are 39%, with fossil fuel being the main heat source today [1]. To achieve the UK's target of the net-zero emissions of GHGs by 2050, the domestic heating sector has to be decarbonised [3]. Many countries have a strategy by 2050 to increase the share of renewable energies.</p>
        <p>In combination with renewable energy, an increase in HPs in heating provision is expected. By 2030, HP should provide 22.1% of the domestic heating compared with 5% in 2019 [1]. The coefficient of performance (COP) and seasonal performance factor (SPF) are parameters to evaluate the performance of HPs [4]. HPs are divided into air source heat pump (ASHP), ground source heat pump (GSHP), water source heat pump (WSHP) and soar assisted heat pumps (SAHP). Depending on the purpose of application, climate conditions, technical and economic parameters, each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
        <p>Table 1 lists of review papers on solar-assisted ASHPs (SAASHPs, vapour-compression HPs).</p>
        <p>Two approaches to solar boosting that have reported are direct expansion SAASHP (DX-SAASHP) [5][6][7][8][9] and indirect expansion SAASHP (IX-SAASHP) [10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23]. In the DX-SAASHPs, refrigerant is circulated directly through the solar collectors which serve as the HP evaporator. Investigations on DX-SAASHPs were devoted to exergy analyses, performance evaluation of the entire system and individual components, refrigerants, component and system modelling, solar thermal collector modelling, optimal design and control, various applications such as hot water (HW) provision, space heating (SH), drying, desalination, vaporisation of liquid fuels. From these reviews, further trends were identified such as the use of DX-SAASHP for space cooling (SC), developing highly efficient/low-cost/building-integrated collector-evaporator, establishing DX-SAASHP standardization for the design/production and assembling, and exploring optimal control strategies.</p>
        <p>DX-SAASHPs have not been widely used compared with IX-SAASHPs. In IX-SAASHPs, an intermediate heat transfer fluid is circulated through the solar collectors and the installation is simplified but requiring an additional heat exchanger. An IX-SAASHP performs better than either ASHP [24] or solar heating [25]. For example, application of serial IX-SAASHP in Canadian domestic sector reduced GHG emission by 19% [26]. The use of an air source evaporator in addition to a solar collector allows extracting heat from the ambient air when solar radiation is not available, which expands the capability of the system. However, there is an issue of frost formation of the outdoor unit when the ambient air temperature is below zero, especially in humid regions. The COP and SPF of the system can be improved by integrating thermal energy storage (TES) [27,28].</p>
        <p>Reviews on IX-SAASHPs focused on types of solar collectors including photovoltaic/thermal, energy and exergy analyses, components modelling, environment-friendly refrigerants, system performance and efficiency parameters, hydraulics and control, mathematical modelling approaches (artificial neural networks, life cycle assessment, TRNSYS, etc.), improvement in cycle design (cascade cycle, ejector enhanced cycle, etc.), different applications (SH, drying, desalination, etc.), and market and economic analyses.</p>
        <p>Table 1 Many theoretical, numerical simulations and experimental studies on SAASHP have been conducted in recent years. The utilization of SAASHP for HW and/or SH as well as SC has shown great achievements in decarbonization of heating and cooling. So far few comprehensive reviews have focused on recent advances in SAASHPs for the use in domestic sector. This paper was motivated to thoroughly review the research developments in SAASHPs for domestic heating. This paper aims at providing a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art of SAASHPs. Figure 1 summarizes the framework of this review paper. This review is structured in such a way that the influence of three key components: solar thermal collectors, TES (sensible and latent heats) and air source evaporator including defrosting methods.</p>
        <p>SAASHPs (see table 2) include DX-SAASHP, IX-SAASHP and hybrid systems. In the DX-SAASHPs, the solar collector serves as an evaporator whereas in the IX-SAASHPs, a heat exchanger connects the refrigerant and water loops. The DX-SAASHPs mainly include basic and dual-source DX-SAASHPs. Compared with basic DX-SAASHP, the dual-source DX-SAASHP has an extra air source heat exchanger [29]. The IX-SAASHPs mainly include serial and dual-source systems. In the IX-SAASHPs, a heat exchanger is used to transfer heat from the solar collector to refrigerant. In the hybrid system, an ASHP is parallel to the solar HW loop. Some special SAASHPs have been studied, such as two-stage DX-SAASHP, vapour ejector-enhanced DX-SAASHP, auto-cascade IX-SAASHP, composite IX-SAASHP and trans-critical hybrid system.</p>
        <p>Table 2 The performance of SAASHP is evaluated by COP, SPF and solar fraction (SF). COP is defined by Eq. (1) [30] 678 = &amp; %* /2 ;*;</p>
        <p>where &amp; %* is the heating capacity and 2 ;*; is the total work done by the compressor, fans and pumps given by Eq. (2)</p>
        <p>SPF is the seasonal performance factor that evaluates the efficiency over the whole heating season, the ratio of the total thermal energy delivered by the SAASHP to the total electric energy consumed by compressor, pump and fan, given by Eq. (3).</p>
        <p>where t is time.</p>
        <p>The SF is the solar fraction defined by Eq. ( 4) [31] ?</p>
        <p>where &amp; $% is the average amount of thermal energy collected by a solar collector, &amp; )*$$ is the heat loss of the system and &amp; '( is the heating demand of the building.</p>
        <p>The investigations methods on various SAASHPs available in literature are briefly summarised in table 3. It is apparent that basic DX-SAASHP and serial IX-SAASHP draw most attention.</p>
        <p>Experiments and theoretical analyses are two of the most common research methods. Simulation methods, especially using 
            <rs type="software">TRNSYS</rs> software, is mainly employed to study IX-SAASHP.
        </p>
        <p>The DX-SAASHPs (see Figs. 2 and3) use solar collectors as their evaporators to achieve higher COP due to higher evaporation temperature. Simulation results by Chow et al. showed a year-average COP of 6.46 [32]. Bare solar collectors (roll-bond evaporators) are preferably used in DX-SAASHPs to reduce the solar radiation loss by glass reflection and to extract thermal energy from ambient air.</p>
        <p>Figure 3 shows the ideal thermodynamic cycle on the P-h diagram of the DX-SAASHP system.</p>
        <p>The superheating at the inlet of the compressor and the subcooling at the outlet of the condenser are indicated. In the actual cycle, the flow resistance results in significant pressure drop at the outlets of the evaporator and the condenser.</p>
        <p>Evaporator can be arranged in series or parallel to the solar collector in DX-SAASHPs. Figure 4 shows a serial evaporator-collector system for HW [29]. This system has COPs ranging from 3.5 to 2.5 as water temperature increasing from 30 o C to 50 o C. Figure 5 shows a parallel dual-source DX-SAASHP [34]. This system exhibits better COP than the DX-SAASHP shown in Fig. 3, especially at low solar irradiance [33,34,35]. The heat transfer rates in the solar collector and evaporator affect the distribution of refrigerant flows and hence determine the COP. Experimental results showed the COP of a DX-SAASHP in solar-source solely mode 30%-50% higher than that in ASHP mode [33].</p>
        <p>Numerical simulation results showed that the averaged COP of a DX-SAASHP in dual-source mode is 14.1% higher than that in solar-source-only mode in low solar irradiance of 100 W/m 2 [34].</p>
        <p>Figure 4 Figure 5 The DX-SAASHP of two-stage vapour-compression cycles has been developed for high temperature (60-90 ) application (see Fig. 6) [36]. Figure 7 shows the two-stage vapourcompression cycles on T-s diagram. The refrigerant evaporates in the solar collector to saturation state (8-1) and is compressed by the low-pressure compressor (1-2). The superheating vapour (2) is cooled in the flash tank by saturated liquid (7) up to saturated vapour (3). In the low-pressure cycle, the refrigerant is throttled in the expansion valve (7)(8) and feed the evaporator in the 8 state. For the high-pressure cycle, the saturated vapour is compressed by the high-pressure compressor (3-4) and then condensed in the condenser (4-5), and finally expands at the expansion valve (5-6).</p>
        <p>Kuang and Wang designed a multi-functional DX-SAASHP for SH, SC and HW provision, with a radiant floor, a fan and a water tank [37]. The experiment expresses a COP of 2.1-2.7 for SH-only mode. In SC-only mode, this system adopts a storage tank to balance the night cold thermal energy storage and the daytime demand, but the cold energy storage efficiency (30%) and COP (2.9) are not satisfactory. In HW-only mode, the cycle provides 200-1000 litre HW with a temperature of 50 daily. It should be noticed that this system is only studied in single-function modes. In multi-function mode, the interaction among components may result in heat losses and requires more energy input.</p>
        <p>The system in the multi-function mode needs to be further studied.</p>
        <p>Vapour ejection can reduce pressure ratio of compressors and thus improve system efficiency.</p>
        <p>Zhu et al. proposed a dual-nozzle vapour ejector to assist compressor and to reduce the energy consumption [38]. The arrangement of the vapour-ejector enhanced DX-SAASHP, as well as its p-h diagram and vapour ejector construction are shown in Fig. 8 (a), (b) and (c). The dual-nozzle vapour ejector connects the low-temperature (air source) and the high-temperature (solar source) evaporators.</p>
        <p>The simulation results of this system show that the COP and heating capacity are 4.6%-34% and 7.8%-52%, respectively, higher than those of the conventional vapour ejector-compression cycle. The ratio of pressures can be further reduced for a larger temperature difference between the two evaporators.</p>
        <p>Figure 8 The vapour ejector enhanced DX-SAASHPs have been further developed in [39] and [40] (see Fig. 9-10). In [39], the superheated vapour discharged by the compressor condenses (2-3) and then flows into the throttle valve (3)(4) and the liquid pump (3)(4)(5)(6), respectively. The low-pressure stream absorbs heat from air source (4-5). The high-pressure stream evaporates to the superheated vapour in solar collector (6)(7). The superheated vapour works as the primary flow of the vapour ejector and expands to a two-phase flow with little liquid (7-7') to entrain the vapour from the evaporator (5-5').</p>
        <p>The two streams are mixed in the mixing chamber (8) and are then compressed in the diffuser (8-1)</p>
        <p>and the compressor (1-2). Theoretical analysis suggests that, compared with the conventional HP, this system can lead to increases by 15.3%, 38.1% and 52.8% in the COP, heating capacity and heating exergy output, respectively.</p>
        <p>Figure 9 An adjustable DX-SAASHP system with a solenoid valve between the condenser and the vapour ejector was analysed theoretically [40]. It has a pure vapour ejector-compression mode and a pure solar-assisted vapour ejector-compression mode. The superheated refrigerant vapour condenses to saturated or subcooled states (2-3). In mode A, the liquid works as the primary flow of the vapour ejector directly. In mode B, the liquid evaporates (3)(4) in solar collector and then works as the primary flow. The two-phase fluid is separated into saturated liquid (5-6) and saturated vapour (5-1) in the phase separator. The liquid part expands to two-phase fluid (6-7) and then evaporates to saturated or superheated states (7)(8). This is the secondary flow of the vapour ejector. The vapour part is then compressed (1-2). The simulation results suggest that the COP and heating capacity are 13.8% and 20.4% higher than those of the conventional vapour-ejector enhanced vapour-compression HP. On average, this cycle outperforms the vapour-compression HP in COP by 25.1%. However, these concepts lack validations from practical experiments.</p>
        <p>IX-SAASHPs include serial and dual source systems. In serial IX-SAASHPs, the thermal energy collected by the solar collector heats up the water in the water loop and the hot water is circulated to the evaporator of the HP. Dual-source IX-SAASHP enables both ambient air and solar energy as the heat sources. Generally, the systems of IX-SAASHPs are more complicated than DX-SAASHPs.</p>
        <p>Serial IX-SAASHPs use the thermal energy collected by the solar collector as the heat source.</p>
        <p>To balance the heat demand and supply, TES connects either to the solar collector and the evaporator (see Fig. 11(a)) or to the condenser and the end use (see Fig. 11(b)). The TES also works as a buffer to reduce the noise and voltage shocks caused by the frequent start-up and shutdown of HP. In Fig. 11(a)</p>
        <p>SH by air is achieved by condensers placed in rooms. In Fig. 11(b) SH by water is achieved by circulating hot water to radiators. Although the utilisation of solar thermal energy increases the HP performance, the system COP is apparently lower than that of the HP due to the power consumed by the additional components. Experimental results of a serial IX-SAASHP showed the HP COP of 3.8</p>
        <p>and its system COP of 2.9 [41]. Experimental results of a similar serial IX-SAASHP showed the HP COP ranging from 2.5 to 3.5, and the system COP is around 20% lower [42]. Figure 12 illustrates a serial IX-SAASHP with dual TES tanks [43]. Compared with IX-SAASHPs in Fig. 11 (b), this system can reduce the frequency of HP start-up and shutdown.</p>
        <p>Figure 12 Figure13 shows a dual source IX-SAASHP which utilises both solar thermal energy and ambient air as the heat sources. Two evaporators are separately connected to an air-water heat exchanger and solar collector loop. A TES tank is in the solar collector loop. The HP provides HW and SH by air.</p>
        <p>Numerical simulations were performed to compare the performance amongst the serial and dualsource IX-SAASHPs and hybrid SAASHP [46]. The results show that a hybrid SAASHP using a solar collector of 14 m 2 achieves an SPF of 3.65 and consumes 2317 kWh electricity, while a serial IX-SAASHP using a solar collector of 30 m 2 achieves an SPF of 3.53 and consumes 2401 kWh electricity.</p>
        <p>A dual-source IX-SAASHP using a solar collector of 14 m 2 achieves an SPF of 3.70 and consumes 2289 kWh electricity. It is seen that the performance of the dual-source IX-SAASHP and hybrid SAASHP are almost the same. Due to the system simplicity the hybrid SAASHP is more attractive.</p>
        <p>However, some experimental studies draw opposite conclusions. Experimental studies in [47,48] show a COP of 4.0 of a serial IX-SAASHP and a COP of 3.0 of a hybrid SAASHP, respectively.</p>
        <p>Experiments in [49] found that a serial IX-SAASHP can reach a COP of 2.95, and a dual-source IX-SAASHP can reach a COP of 2.90.</p>
        <p>Figure14 shows a novel component and system configuration proposed based on conventional IX-SAASHP [50]. The composite heat exchanger is used to replace the conventional water-to-water heat exchanger in serial IX-SAASHPs to absorb solar thermal energy and thermal energy from ambient air. A composite heat exchanger is designed by inserting a tube into a finned tube. Hot water from the solar loop flows inside the inner tube and refrigerant flows in annulus. This system has three working modes i.e. solar-only, air-only and dual-source modes. Experimental results show that, compared with the air-only mode, in the dual-source mode, the COP increases by 59% and the heating capacity increases by 62% at the ambient temperature of -15 o C. When the temperature difference between solar water and ambient air is 5 o C, the COP and heating capacity in the dual-source mode are 49% and 51% higher than those in the air-only mode.</p>
        <p>The use of two coupled compression cycles may incur high capital costs and electricity consumption. To reduce energy costs, a solar-assisted auto-cascade HP using a single compressor with zeotropic mixture R32/R290 has been proposed to maintain a wide range of outdoor air and heating circuit temperatures (see Fig. 15) [52]. To achieve an auto-cascade cycle, a phase separator is used with the cascade heat exchanger. The compressed superheated vapour (1-2) condenses to saturated or subcooled liquid (2-3). Then the liquid flows through the sub-cooler I (3-4) and expansion valve I (4-5) into the flash tank, where the two-phase fluid absorbs heat from the solar heating loop (5)(6). The refrigerant is separated into the R290 dominant liquid (6-6l) and the R32 dominant vapour (6-6v). The R290 dominant liquid is passed through expansion valve II (6v-7) to the cascade heat exchanger and vaporised completely (7)(8). The R32 dominant vapour is transferred to the cascade heat exchanger (6v-9) and thoroughly condensed via the sub-cooler II (9-10). Then the condensed fluid goes to the low-temperature evaporator through expansion valve III (10)(11), absorbing heat from ambient air (11)(12). Fluids from the low-temperature evaporator flow back through the subcooler II (12)(13). Then it (13)(14) is mixed with the vapour from cascade heat exchanger (8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14) and returned to the compressor through the sub-cooler (14-1). Simulation results suggest that, compared with conventional ASHP, this novel system increases COP and volumetric heating capacity by 4.2%-9.9% and 4.4%-9.7%, respectively. These improvements greatly rely on the heat absorption ratio and the composition of the zeotropic mixture.</p>
        <p>Figure 16 illustrates a composite IX-SAASHP with an HP parallel to the solar collectors in the cold weather conditions in Canada [53,54]. The hot water leaving the solar collectors is further heated up in the condenser of the HP and then heat up the water in the TES tank. The HP absorbs residual heat after the heat exchange and cools the water entering the solar collectors. The reduced collector inlet temperature improves the collector efficiency and thus the COP. It requires a lower capacity HP and consumes less electricity.</p>
        <p>In hybrid SAASHPs (see Fig. 17), ASHP and solar collector water loop work independently. In Fig. 17(a) HW and SH by air is achieved by an ASHP and a solar heating with a TES tank. In summer, the ASHP can provide SC. In Fig. 17(b) an ASHP and a solar collector loop provide hot water to a TES tank to achieve SH by water. Compared with serial systems, the hybrid SAASHPs are more widely used [10].</p>
        <p>Figure 17 A single-stage vapour-compression HP cannot deliver heat above 50 °C at low ambient temperatures. To increase the temperature range between the outdoor air and the heating circuit, twostage cascade HPs are used in the cold climate regions or to ensure the demand for a higher temperature lift. A solar-assisted two-stage cascade HP is proposed by Yerdesh et al. [51] where solar thermal collectors and a cascade ASHP simultaneously heat up the hot water in the TES tank (see A solar thermal collector can be integrated in a hybrid trans-critical carbon dioxide (CO2) HPs for SH, SC and HW (see Fig. 19) [55,56,57,58]. In SH and HW mode, the COP and heating capacity are about 2.3 and 6 kW [57,58], while in SC mode the COP and heating capacity are 4 and 8 kW, respectively [55].</p>
        <p>Solar collector is an important component for thermal energy input of SAASHPs. Flat plate collector is commonly selected in recent studies. To absorb more thermal energy from ambient air, the collector/evaporator is designed by coating solar selective materials on the surface of an evaporator. Collector/evaporator is mainly used in DX-SAASHPs. In IX-SAASHP, evacuated tube solar collectors draw more attention. Figure 20 introduces the matching relation between solar collectors and system configurations. Table 4 lists some open literature where collector/evaporator and evacuated tube collector have been employed in SAASHPs. It can be noticed that systems using advanced solar collector can achieve a COP of 3-5. Especially, those for SH can work at ambient temperature below 0 .</p>
        <p>Table 4 The thermal energy collected by a solar collector, &amp; $% , is determined by Eq. ( 5) [59]</p>
        <p>where L, # $% , and 4 $% are the area, the average amount of energy received per square meter and collector efficiency, respectively, a and b are coefficients determined by experiments, . $%,0/ is the water/refrigerant temperature at the inlet of solar collector, Ta is the temperature of ambient air, and L is the average monthly value of atmosphere lucidity.</p>
        <p>Flat plate collectors are commonly adopted in SAASHPs. Bare (uncovered) flat plate collectors enable to use thermal energy from solar radiation and ambient air. The experiment of Sun et al. [60] suggests that, at the outdoor temperature of 0 -10 , the collector efficiency of a bare solar collector ranges from 40% to 70%, where water vapour condensation occurs on the solar collector. The experiment study of Scarpa and Tagliafico [61] suggests that, due to water vapour condensation on the solar collector, a DX-SAASHP using a bare collector achieves a COP of 5.8 at weak solar radiation.</p>
        <p>There is a noticeable influence of collector area on system performance. Increasing collector area can enhance the SF of a SAASHP [30], almost in a linear relation [62]. Larger collector area can improve COP since it brings more solar energy input [63]. Both system configuration and collector area affect collector efficiency. With the same collector area of 30 m K , the collector in a serial IX-SAASHP shows higher collector efficiency (62%-70%) than that in a hybrid SAASHP (with a 4 $% of 54%-60%) [47,48]. With a smaller collector area of 20 m K in a serial IX-SAASHP, the collector efficiency ranges from 33% to 47% [41].</p>
        <p>To improve collector efficiency, collector plate can be coated with black paintings [31,43,46,47,48,64,65,66,67,68,69]. Some collectors use serpentine tube or other special tubes between the plates [35,65,70]. The simulation results of a DX-SAASHP using an uncovered and coated collector with serpentine tube over a year showed daily COPs varying from 1.7 (in summer) to 2.5 (in autumn)</p>
        <p>with an average value higher than 2.0. [65]. The simulation results of a DX-SAASHP using a flat plate collector with spiral tube showed monthly COPs between 4.0 (in summer) and 6.0 (in winter) [70]. The "contradictory" COPs in summer and winter are due to the high water temperature in summer which leads to high condensation temperature and low system efficiency. In terms of effect of weather conditions, the simulation results of a DX-SAASHP using a flat plate collector with serpentine tube showed COPs from 3.83 to 4.69 in sunny days [71]. Especially, in rainy winter, the average COP can still achieve 3.3, with the lowest COP of 2.51. Similar conclusions can be drawn from experiments where the average COPs vary from 5.21 to 6.61 [72,73]. At a rainy night, COP can still reach 3.11 [74].</p>
        <p>A novel flat plate collector is shown in Fig. 21 [67]. With an area of 11 m K , this novel collector achieves an average collector efficiency of 67.2% at low operating temperature in a serial IX-SAASHP. The system COP is 2.19 and the COP of HP is 2.55. As a comparison, another serial IX-SAASHP using a conventional flat plate collector obtains a collector efficiency of 60.1% but a system COP of 3.08 [75].</p>
        <p>The heating reliability of DX-SAASHP is better than that of direct solar heating, but still worse than that of ASHP. To further improve the reliability of DX-SAASHP, both solar and ambient thermal energies can be used by adding an air evaporator or using an uncovered flat plate collector. For example, a collector area of 3.24 m K is considered ideal for an uncovered flat plate collector in a DX-SAASHP [76].</p>
        <p>To earn higher year-average COP, a larger flat plate collector can be used but it is not economical [32]. Kaygusuz suggests that, when the number of collectors is doubled, COP is increased by 37% while the cost is increased by 65% [31]. Thus, to improve COP at low cost, collector/evaporator, designed by coating evaporator surface with solar selective materials, is a good alternative to extract more thermal energy. The average COP of a system using finned tube collector/evaporator is 2.94, increasing by 8.1% than that of conventional ASHP [77]. The average heating efficiency and exergy efficiency are raised by 20% and 8%, respectively.</p>
        <p>IX-SAASHPs and hybrid SAASHP for SH require large collector area of flat plate collector. For a serial-hybrid SAASHP, a simulation study reveals a reasonable collector area of 35 m K for a covered flat plate collector [66]. To obtain a smaller system, the evacuated tube collector is an alternative.</p>
        <p>Simulation and experimental results of a serial IX-SAASHP using evacuated tubes show the maximum COPs of 6.33 and 6.38, respectively [78]. For a hybrid SAASHP using evacuated tube collectors, the COP can be around 5 at the highest daily solar irradiance [79]. The evacuated tube collector can be integrated with latent TES to further improve the thermal performance. For example, an experiment of a serial IX-SAASHP using both evacuated tube collector and latent TES shows a COP of 10.03 [80].</p>
        <p>TES is used to balance the energy demand and supply. It is essential for SAASHPs to mitigate solar energy discontinuity since an overcast for more than 20 minutes can lead to an apparent decrease in outlet temperature of the collector [83]. Both sensible and latent heat TESs are used in SAASHPs.</p>
        <p>The seasonal TES is suitable to regions with larger seasonal variations of solar energy availability and heating demand. Table 5 summarizes the studies involving latent heat and seasonal TESs. The studies on the sensible heat TES are summarized in tables 6 and 7. On average, with optimisation in storage methods, systems can perform better with an SPF around 4-5.</p>
        <p>Table 5 4.1 Sensible heat thermal energy storage Typical air, geothermal and water source HPs make use of sensible heat as heat sources. The sensible heat can also be used to store thermal energy. Water and soil are widely used as the mediums for sensible heat TES. The maximum capacity for sensible heat TES, &amp; +,-, is determined by Eq. ( 6) [30] &amp; +,-= 5M! " (. +,--. +0/ )</p>
        <p>where 5, M and ! " are the density, volume and specific heat capacity of the TES medium. . +,-is the temperature of TES tank fully-charged and . +0/ the temperature of TES tank fully-discharged.</p>
        <p>Geothermal TES can be integrated into a serial IX-SAHP using boreholes as the TES container (see Fig. 22) [84]. A numerical simulation of a solar-geothermal hybrid HP showed that the system can save energy by 2.08 TJ per year, equivalent to 70-ton standard coal and corresponding to 234-ton carbon dioxide emission [85]. An experiment demonstrated that the utilisation of ground TES helps to improve the COP from 2.95 to 3.36 compared with SAASHP [49]. However, since a deep borehole is required for sufficient heat exchange with ground, the excavation increases the installation cost of geothermal heat exchangers. Moreover, the heat stored in summer may not equal to the heat extracted in winter, influencing underground temperature balance [85].</p>
        <p>Figure 22 Water TES is more popular than geothermal TES since water has higher thermal capacity and the manufacturing of water tanks requires much less capital cost. Water tank with high degree of thermal stratification shows 5.3% energy saving over one year than fully-mixed water tank [86] because uniform distribution of water temperature reduces exergy [87]. Diffusers can be used to enhance thermal stratification. This increases energy efficiency of the system by 15%-20% compared with that using fully-mixed water tank [88]. Low water flow rate contributes to high degree of thermal stratification. Therefore, the water flow rate can be optimized considering the heating capacity and COP [44]. Water TES can be integrated with other components for heat recovery. An early study of a DX-SAASHP nested the evaporator/collector into a solar pond (TES) [89]. It achieved a COP higher than 3.0 in winter and the maximum COP of 8.4 in summer. A numerical simulation showed that recovering heat from waste-water stored can enhance the SPF of a SAASHP from 4% to 20% and recovering heat from drain water can improve the SPF by 2% [90].</p>
        <p>Latent thermal energy is embodied in phase change material (PCM) at a constant temperature and is greatly larger than sensible thermal energy. A study on a serial/dual-source IX-SAASHP suggests that latent heat TES can increase the COP by 6.1% and 14% on sunny and cloudy days [81].</p>
        <p>Another study designs a multi-function system which uses solar energy, latent TES and ground source [91]. In the latent TES mode, this SAHP achieves an average COP of 4.86, almost twice of that in the GSHP mode. When the latent heat TES is used as a heat source, a COP of 4.67 has been achieved.</p>
        <p>PCMs are commonly stored in tanks and their storage efficiency is hardly influenced by system configurations. For example, for both serial IX-SAASHPs and hybrid system, the storage efficiencies of PCM-filled tanks are equal at 63% [47,48]. Due to some characteristics of PCM, such as the volume change during phase change process, tank selection for latent heat TES differs from that for sensible heat TES. Using a rectangular tank can decrease the melting time by 50% compared with using a cylindrical tank with the same volume and heat transfer area [92].</p>
        <p>A novel triple-sleeve heat exchanger has been proposed as shown in Fig. 23 [93]. Refrigerant flows in the inner tube and PCM is filled between the inner and the middle tubes. Heat transfer fluid absorbs thermal energy in the solar collector and flows inside the outer tube. The effect of temperature of the heat transfer fluid on TES is higher than that of its flow rate. Ni et al. investigated a SAASHP with this triple-sleeve heat exchanger [94]. Compared with an ASHP, at an ambient temperature above 38 , cooling COP of the SAASHP using the novel heat exchanger is 17% higher; at an ambient temperature below -10 , heating COP of this system is enhanced by 65% [95].</p>
        <p>Figure 23 Commonly used PCMs include paraffin, calcium chloride (CaCl2), sodium sulphate (Na2SO4) and ice slurry. A novel serial/dual-source IX-SAASHP with paraffin for latent heat TES shows improvement in COP, especially on cloudy days [119]. A serial-hybrid SAASHP using CaCl K as the TES medium reaches a seasonal COP of 4.5 with a storage efficiency of 0.62 [96]. Generally, PCMs have poor thermal conductivity, which leads to higher thermal resistance and lower heat transfer. It also increases the time of charging and discharging processes, and thus impacts the overall system efficiency. However, studies involving both sensible and latent heat TESs suggest that the latent heat TES is superior to sensible heat TES. A dual-tank serial IX-SAASHP using Na K SO T shows a COP of 10.03, about 3.5 times higher than that of a system only using sensible heat TES [80]. The collection efficiency (the ratio of thermal energy stored in water or PCM to the collected solar thermal energy)</p>
        <p>increases by 50% when the latent heat TES is used, while the influence of the sensible heat TES is negligible. Another dual-tank serial IX-SAASHP using ice slurry as the PCM reaches an SPF of 4.6, where solar energy meets 78% of the heat demand [62].</p>
        <p>Water/ice is the most available and eco-friendly PCM. Compared with an electrical resistance heating system, a serial IX-SAASHP using ice slurry as the PCM saves energy consumption by 86% [54,97]. However, a SAASHP using sensible heat TES can also save 81% of energy consumption. A model of a reversible ice storage tank, which uses three plate heat exchangers: two attached on the tank wall and one inserted in ice, was proposed and validated for solar heating [98,99]. Based on the model, the SPF of a SAASHP using ice storage is predicted to be around 5.0 [82]. For the ice storage buried in borehole, energy extraction can be influenced by ground properties [100]. Under two extreme ground conditions, energy injection of the two heat exchangers on the wall fluctuates by 6%, and the energy injection of the heat exchanger in ice significantly fluctuates by 20%.</p>
        <p>It should be noticed that increasing collector area or latent heat TES volume can improve system performance. Taking economic factors into account, to achieve the same performance, increase in collector area is more beneficial [46,62,82].</p>
        <p>Solar TES includes daily and seasonal storages. The daily storage stores solar thermal energy collected during daytime and releases it at night. The seasonal TES stores the solar thermal energy collected in summer for heating in winter and/or in winter for cooling in summer. The seasonal TES is suitable to high latitude regions where seasonal solar energy and heating demand are dramatically mismatched [101]. Seasonal TES allows solar energy to provide more than 50% of the annual heating demand [102]. Compared with daily TES, seasonal TES requires large storage volume and collector area, consequently high cost [30].</p>
        <p>Commonly used mediums for seasonal TES include water, gravel-water, ground and aquifer.</p>
        <p>Different mediums require different start-up time to pre-heat surrounding soil up to normal operating conditions [102]. Tanks using water and gravel-water need to be buried (partly) into the ground. The ground and aquifer are directly employed as underground TES mediums. The buried water tank can be independent to ground properties due to its good insulation [102]. This additional insulation cost can be partly compensated by lower excavation cost. The results of a serial IX-SAASHP using an underground hemispherical surface tank for seasonal TES suggest that a small burial depth is capable of achieving desired annual COP and temperature of the storage tank [68,69]. The aquifer and ground TESs have better economic efficiencies than burial tanks [103]. Combining cost effective methods with high thermal capacity methods may optimise the system performance. For example, a system combining hot water and ground storages achieves an SF of 74% and a system COP of 4.4 [104]. It is worth noting that the change in ground temperature may bring disadvantages to environment [30].</p>
        <p>Water has higher specific heat capacity while solid mediums allow higher temperature range for higher TES capacity [105]. In the cold climate regions, since the heat loss increases with the increase in temperature difference between storage mediums and surroundings, low-temperature seasonal TES is suitable [106] and benefits for storage stratification and thus storage efficiency [107]. Lower temperature of the fluid entering solar collector also improves collector efficiency [108]. PCM is a promising medium for low-temperature seasonal TES. The size of the latent heat TES is much smaller than that of a sensible heat TES. Numerical simulations were conducted to examine the annual periodic performance of a dual-source IX-SAASHP using a seasonal latent heat TES [109]. This system achieves an SPF of about 4.2.</p>
        <p>Frosting is an issue influencing the reliable operation and efficiency of ASHPs in winter, especially in humid regions. Frost build-up on the surface of evaporator deteriorates heat transfer and efficiency and eventually shutdown of ASHPs [110,111]. The mechanisms of frosting and defrosting on the surface of evaporator are reviewed in [112,113,114]. Song et al. [114] comprehensively reviewed the defrosting methods including cycle reversing [115], hot gas bypass [116], electric heater [117], dehumidification [118] and polymer coatings [119]. The principle of the cycle reversing, hot gas bypass and electric heater is to melt the frost layer. The periodic defrosting required not only consumes electricity but also cause mismatching to the heating demand. The cycle reversing requires a well-designed control strategy to balance the SH demand and effective defrosting [115]. The dehumidification requires replacing or regenerating desiccant periodically as the moisture absorption capacity drops [118]. The polymer coating enables the reduction of the surface free energy and ice adherence force and hence delays frosting [119], where the challenge is to sustain the performance of the coating surface.</p>
        <p>TES can assist the conventional defrosting methods [114,120]. As shown in Fig. 24, a PCM storage is parallel to the condenser [121]. During the period of reverse-cycle defrosting, no thermal energy is provided for indoor SH. The stored heat assists to shorten the defrosting period by 38% [122]. The PCM storage is placed around the compressor to use the waste heat [123]. During the reverse-cycle defrosting, ASHP continues to provide SH because the stored waste heat is delivered to both indoor and outdoor heat exchangers. The defrosting time and total energy consumption is 65% and 27.9%, respectively, lower than conventional reverse-cycle defrosting. Over the whole test period, the COP and total heating capacity increase by 1.4% and 14.2% with the power input increasing 12.6%.</p>
        <p>Figure 25 shows an ASHP using a PCM-filled tank and an additional evaporator coated with desiccant in series [124]. This system enables continuous heat provision in both heating and regeneration modes. In the heating mode, air is dehumidified as it flows through the desiccant-coated evaporator (9) and then flows through the evaporator (12). Refrigerant is condensed in a condenser embedded in water TES tank (4) and then releases the residual heat in the PCM TES tank (6).</p>
        <p>Refrigerant absorbs the latent heat released during air dehumidifying process in the desiccant-coated evaporator (9). This increases evaporation temperature of the evaporator (12) to avoid frosting. In the regeneration mode, refrigerant is condensed in a condenser embedded in water TES tank (4) and releases the residual heat for desiccant regeneration as it flows in two evaporators (9 and 12). The refrigerant vaporises as it flows through the PCM TES tank (6) and absorbs the stored thermal energy.</p>
        <p>Experimental results of this ASHP shows a COP of 2.81, 7.3% and 46.3% higher than those of hotgas bypass defrosting and electric heater [124]. Heating performance of ASHP is also superior to that of ASHP using reverse-cycle defrosting, especially in the cold weather conditions [125].</p>
        <p>For SAASHP, defrosting is only a concern for outdoor evaporators. Solar thermal energy helps to reduce frost on solar collector [126]. Kong et al. [127] numerically and experimentally studied a DX-SAASHP under frosting conditions. The results showed that frosting on solar collector can be significantly delayed. Experiments [128] show that the frosting on a solar collector is much slower than that on an evaporator and after a 6-hour experiment, frost is merely seen on the solar collector.</p>
        <p>At a lower solar irradiance of 100 W/m 2 and a higher relative humidity of 70%, no frost is observed when the ambient temperature is higher than -3 .</p>
        <p>Current studies on SAASHP focus on the match and optimisation of system configuration.</p>
        <p>However, there is a lack on the optimisation of each component and its matching application in SAASHP. This section summarises recent research status in terms of system configuration, solar collector, TES, working conditions, refrigerants and their influences on system performance. In addition to table 4 summarizing the details regarding the utilisation of collector/evaporator and evacuated tube solar collector and table 5 summarizing the details about the studies of SAASHPs using latent heat and seasonal TESs, tables 6 and 7 give the details of the typical studies of DX-SAASHP and IX-SAASHP and table 8 gives the details of some advanced SAASHP configurations.</p>
        <p>The statistic summaries given in these tables provide an overall view of the studies on this topic and sufficient information for further analysis below.</p>
        <p>Table 6 Table 7 Table 8 Working fluid determines the selection of compressor and therefore the corresponding components. Figure 26 summarises the number of open literature per year for SAASHPs using different refrigerants. It can be seen that, generally, the number of studies on SAASHPs shows an apparent increase in the past 10 years. Currently, refrigerants such as R22, R134a, R32, R410A and R407C are normally used in HPs due to their good thermodynamic and thermophysical properties [20]. Due to the composition shift and temperature glide, the currently used mixed refrigerants have technical limitations [129]. The parameters that determine the environmental impacts of refrigerants are the ozone depletion potential (ODP) and global warming potential (GWP). These parameters are high for the specified refrigerants. International environmental protocols [130,131,132] have imposed restrictions on the use of refrigerants according to ODP and GWP parameters. According to the Kigali Agreement [131], natural refrigerants such as hydrocarbon refrigerants and carbon dioxide (R744) were found to be long-term sustainable options for HPs [20]. For example, the performances of R1270 and R290 are closer to that of R22 but their flammability requires more safety considerations while retrofitting [83]. Current studies on environment-friendly refrigerants with low GWP, such as R32 and R290, are insufficient and need to be further investigated. R32 is a more environment-friendly alternative refrigerant to R410A in HPs and it is most commonly used in Japan for supplying HW. However, due to flammability (A2L) issues some countries are researching other retrofits, such as R454B. R290 is the most popular refrigerant for НРs in Europe not only for HW but also for SH applications. Recent increase in refrigerant inventory limit (IEC 60335-2-89 [133])</p>
        <p>enables greener refrigerants such as R32 and R290 in these applications.</p>
        <p>The geographic location affects solar availability and thus the research interests on SAASHP.</p>
        <p>Figure 27 shows the number of investigations on SAASHPs in different countries. It can be noticed that the majority of studies have been located in China (48%), Turkey (10%), the USA and Canada (5%). The studies in the UK is only 3%. SAASHPs for the domestic sector are mainly investigated by researchers from mid-latitude (20 o -50 o ) countries where SH is required in winter and HW is required throughout the year under the medium solar energy availability and temperate climate conditions (-15 o C -30 o C). SAASHPs for high-latitude areas need to be further investigated.</p>
        <p>Generally, the higher solar irradiance leads to the higher COP of SAASHP [33,71,73,77,134,135,136,192]. For example, a numerical simulation of DX-SAASHP for HW has tested the effects of various parameters (see Figs. 28 and29) [73]. As solar irradiance increases from 300 to 1000 W/m 2 , COP increases from 4.2 to 6. In this process, solar collector efficiency decreases from 1.5 to 0.85. It should be noticed that an uncovered collector is used in the study which absorbs thermal energy from both solar irradiation and ambient air. At lower solar irradiance, the collector mainly absorbs thermal energy from ambient air and achieves an efficiency over 1; at higher solar irradiance, the collector mainly absorbs thermal energy from solar energy and the efficiency is lower than 1 because of heat loss. For a covered collector, the trend is the same but less apparent [108].</p>
        <p>In terms of ambient temperature, as Fig. 29 shows, high ambient temperature leads to higher COP and collector efficiency [73]. With the increase of ambient temperature from 5 o C to 35 o C, COP increases from 4.5 to 5.7, and collector efficiency increases from 0.75 to 1.07 since as ambient temperature increases, collector can earn more thermal energy from air and thus increase efficiency.</p>
        <p>The required output temperature has a negative linear influence on COP. As Fig. 30 shows, a study of a DX-SAASHP for HW concluded that the higher the output water temperature was, the lower system COP would be [35,65,70,137]. As the output water temperature increases from 25 o C to 60 o C, the COP drops from 3.7 to 2.7 linearly. An experiment of a DX-SAASHP for HW shows that, with a rise of temperature difference between output water and ambient environment from 5 o C to 40 o C, COP drops from 5 to 2 (see Fig. 31) [138]. This is, as output water temperature increases, compressor discharge pressure increases, and therefore energy consumption increases [44]. In turn, as inlet source temperature decreases, compressor suction pressure decreases. The increase in pressure ratio brings lower COP. Interestingly, the COP values of two DX-SAASHPs shown in [32] and [139] vary significantly. This concerns many reasons. The DX-SAASHP in [32] uses R134a as the working fluid and uses an uncovered collector of 12 m 2 ; the DX-SAASHP in [139] uses R22 as the working fluid and uses a covered collector of 2 m 2 . Overall, advanced IX-SAASHP is ideal for SH as well as HW, and DX-SAASHP is more suitable to HW. For multi-functional SAASHP, advanced IX-SAASHP is the best choice. Figure 33 It can be concluded from the above that solar collector and thermal energy storage have significant influence on the system performance. The influences are displayed in Fig. 34, where the solid line represents the SPF and the dashed line represents the yearly electricity consumption, that larger collector area and storage volume lead to a higher SPF and lower electricity consumption [76,96,135,192]. According to Ito et al. 's [76] and Carbonell et al. 's [90] simulations, uncovered collectors are superior to covered collectors with a collector area lower than 15 m 2 . For larger collector area, covered collector with proper storage volume can help to achieve an SPF over 6. Smallscale SAASHPs for the domestic sector require high-efficient solar collectors to reduce collector area at the same SF and working conditions. This may be achieved by auxiliary components, such as compound parabolic concentrator [55,57,58,108]. Xu et al. 's [108] simulation revealed that a collector using compound parabolic concentrator and capillary tube absorber can achieve higher collecting temperature and higher collector efficiency than that of a flat plate collector at the same size. According to Ito et al. [76], collector plate thickness and tube pitch can affect system SPF according to plate material and ambient temperature. Larger plate thickness and lower tube pitch result in higher SPF. Simulation of an uncovered collector suggested that the influence of plate thickness is apparent at smaller thickness and tends to be less at larger thickness. Other parameters such as inclination angle of solar collectors hardly affect SPF and collector efficiency [41,108].</p>
        <p>Current studies on solar collectors mainly adopt the collectors designed for solar domestic HW.</p>
        <p>The specific collectors for SAASHP are needed to be developed, which should match the development of TES methods and the requirements of the SAASHP. Currently, for most systems using sensible heat TES, solar collector is expected to achieve higher outlet temperature to store more thermal energy in the same storage volume. In the future, as PCM is adopted to improve TES efficiency and combined with defrosting for the smooth operation of systems with evaporator, e.g., hybrid SAASHP, the required collector outlet temperature can be lower, just above the phase change temperature. A novel control strategy proposed by Xu et al. can be used to control the fluid flow rate and outlet temperature of solar collectors based on working conditions, enabling optimization of SAASHPs [188].</p>
        <p>Increasing investigations of SAASHPs are seen in the most recent years. Great efforts have been put to develop high efficient and compact components to match the working conditions of SAASHPs and hence to improve the system performance. Particularly, eco-friendly refrigerants such as R1234yf, R1233zd(E), R433A, R32 and R290 are used to deal with the global warming.</p>
        <p>The world is actively decarbonizing the energy sector through the development, first, of the renewable electricity and the abandonment of hydrocarbon combustion based systems. HPs are of the greatest interest. Combining and hybridizing solar thermal collectors with HPs can significantly increase the performance of the system. The COP of HPs has increased substantially over the past years due to technical improvements. The integration of solar thermal energy will boost the COP even higher. According to IEA recent report on Solar Heating and Cooling Programme, in 2019 solar thermal systems provided 479 GW thermal energy. This is equivalent to save 43 million tons of oil and to avoid 138 million tons of CO2 emissions [189].</p>
        <p>In Europe and the UK are trying to standardize and commercialize SAHPs. For example, companies, such as Solamics Bunsen Air, mainly focused on DX-SAHP water heaters. As an evaporator in such DX-SAHP, so-called thermodynamic panel or roll-bond evaporator is used. This is simply an unglazed absorber plate of solar thermal collectors, which is shown in Fig. 20 as a collector/evaporator. The main shortcoming of such evaporators is a huge heat loss due to non-glazing and isolation, but this is also an advantage, since in the absence of solar radiation, natural convective heat exchange with ambient air allows the evaporation process. With a high solar radiation intensity in the collector/evaporator, the refrigerant turns into a gaseous phase with large volumetric and superheating conditions, which may cause overheating of compressors with further mechanical failure. Therefore, finding efficient DX dual-source [38] configurations with forced convection type fan-coil evaporator assistance is of interest for further research. At the same time, there is a need for adaptation to specific climate conditions, taking into account the meteorological and consumer demand boundary conditions. This, in turn, leads to an optimal selection of other components, such as a compressor, expansion valve and condenser.</p>
        <p>In IX systems comprehensively discussed in section 2.2 solar thermal collectors are connected with vapor compression heat pump cycle through the water storage tank or intermediate heat exchanger. In this case, a heat pump of the "Water-Water" type is used, the evaporator and condenser of which is a brazed plate heat exchanger. In this case, the heat transfer fluid flows in solar collectors without phase changing. In this configuration, the processes in solar thermal part are more controllable and predictable. The use of solar collectors and air source evaporators in the SAASHP system can be dual-source IX-SAASHP or hybrid SAASHP. In the configurations presented in section 2.2 and 2.3, the fan-coil evaporator is mainly used in the refrigerant circuit. Few studies are presented for an air source evaporator in a hydraulic circuit, where heat exchange occurs without phase changing.</p>
        <p>The search for the most optimal configuration for IX-SAASHP taking into account automated components and bringing it to the level of commercialization is the interest of the authors of the present review, in particular for UK case.</p>
        <p>Automation implies the use of electronic components instead of mechanical ones with an appropriate control algorithm and the use of sensors. An intelligent control algorithm for an automated system will allow systems to work with the highest efficiency, of course, after determining the efficient configuration of the DX-SAASHP and IX-SAASHP based on thermodynamic calculations and experiments. In this regard, VFD compressors and EEVs are of interest, which separate the high and low-pressure sides of the vapor compression cycle. In HVAC systems, the VFD can be used in fans, pumps and compressors with variable loads. VFD compressors are of particular interest for DX types of the vapor compression cycle both solar and ambient air since intermittent nature of solar irradiation and variability of ambient air temperature. Due to the variability of the weather boundary conditions, the volumetric flow rate of the vaporous refrigerant through the DX evaporator will be different and, accordingly, the VFD will control the volumetric efficiency of the compressor. By adjusting the frequency of the electrical power supplied to the compressor motor, the VFD controls the rotational speed of the AC motor. The energy savings for compressors up to 35% in HVAC systems [190]. In low solar irradiation or ambient air temperature, which affects evaporation temperature the heating capacity of a heat pump decreases. Similarly, heat pumps with VFD compressors allows adjusting the heating capacity in the different ranges with appropriate frequency.</p>
        <p>Obviously, the highest COP will be obtained for the lowest frequency. The COP value decreased proportionally to the increase in condensing temperature.</p>
        <p>The issues of finding the optimal configuration and studying the optimal operation of DX-SAASHP and IX-SAASHP, taking into account the use of high-tech components such as VFD compressors/pumps/fans, EEV, compact brazed heat exchangers are still open for specific climate conditions. At the same time, for significantly low outside temperatures, research is also needed on the application and optimal use of the auxiliary heater. This will entail research in the field of control and monitoring, the development of an optimal algorithm and system controller. There is a lot of research potential in this regard, but there are some barriers associated with mass commercialization.</p>
        <p>Insufficient recognition of the benefits and high investment costs are the main barriers to widespread use of HPs. Also, in some countries with comparatively low energy prices (natural gas, electricity, etc.), in particular, resource-rich countries, HP operating costs are also inferior to conventional heat supply. In these countries, it is necessary to revise the tariff policy taking into account international environmental protection standards. Defining international standards for HP efficiency, optimization of system and components performance, local production and assembling of the entire system and individual details may be of interest to many representatives of small and medium-size enterprises, start-ups, service engineers, manufacturers and suppliers of heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment. There is a much progress in conventional ASHPs and GSHPs, meanwhile for SAHP systems, including DX-SAASHP and IX-SAASHP, these actions are at the initial level.</p>
        <p>In terms of environmental protection, in regions with a predominant demand for heat supply, during the heating season in large cities and towns there is a poor air quality due to emissions from energy facilities. This leads to a sharp increase in respiratory and allergic diseases. The transition to clean heat provision technologies is the policy of the administration of many cities and towns. In this regard, the technology of heat provision of residential and commercial buildings, individual households using solar thermal energy and ASHP may be of interest to eco researchers, local executive bodies, cities administration, energy policy and decision makers, environmental activists and communities. Therefore, energy policy and decision makers should propose incentive mechanisms in the form of subsidies, grants, etc. to accelerate the transition to clean heat supply technologies like the SAASHP.</p>
        <p>New constructions of the building sector are responsible for the most of HP purchases. In the US, for example, the share of HP sales for new buildings is about 50% for new multi-family buildings and is higher than 40% for single-family dwellings [1]. The European Union, Japan and China markets are expanding quickly. The HP market size is huge even for new buildings. However, to boost adoption in existing buildings across the globe, it is necessary to work to remove the abovementioned technological and economic barriers. In summary, SAASHP has demonstrated advantages and perspective for domestic space heating and hot water. To increase the uptake of SAASHPs, innovative design and optimization of components and system are needed to improve the performance of the system, to reduce the costs and to ensure its robustness of operation.</p>
        <p>The integration of solar thermal energy and an ASHP based on vapour compression cycle is the subject of study by many researchers and a review of the recent research and developments has been presented in this article. Five typical and five advanced type solar SAASHPs have been analyzed.</p>
        <p>Three solar thermal collector types and three thermal energy storage methods have been discussed.</p>
        <p>Ten defrosting methods have been briefly discussed.</p>
        <p>The investigations so far have demonstrated that the SAASHP is a promising technology for HW and SH in the domestic sector. SAASHPs in the domestic sector are mainly investigated by researchers from mid-latitude (20 o -50 o ) countries where SH is required in winter and HW throughout the year under the medium solar irradiance and temperate climate conditions (-15 30 ). In the future, multi-functional SAASHPs as well as SAASHPs for high-latitude areas need to be further investigated by developing advanced IX-SAASHP with enhanced solar collector and TES method.</p>
        <p>The COP values of most SAASHPs are ranging from 2 to 6. The dual-source IX-SAASHP achieves COP lower than 3.5. The hybrid SAASHP, serial IX-SAASHP, advanced DX-SAASHP and dual-source DX-SAASHP can achieve COP up to 6. Both the DX-SAASHP and advanced IX-SAASHP demonstrate their promising potential, enabling COP higher than 6 and up to 10. Advanced IX-SAASHP is ideal for SH and HW, and DX-SAASHP is better suitable to HW. Current studies on SAASHP focus on the matching and optimisation of system configuration. However, the optimisation of each component and its matching application in SAASHP should be further considered.</p>
        <p>Current studies on solar collectors mainly adopt the collector designed for solar domestic HW.</p>
        <p>For flat plate collector, the uncovered solar collectors are superior to covered solar collectors at the collector area less than 15 m 2 . Small-scale SAASHPs for the domestic sector require high-efficient solar collectors, which may be achieved by auxiliary components such as concentrator.</p>
        <p>The development of specific collectors for SAASHP should match the development of TES methods. The latent heat TES brings better storage and system performance over sensible heat TES, although latent heat TES is not economical yet. Basically, solar collector is expected to collect more solar energy to improve SAASHP's COP and SPF. Currently, for common SAASHPs using sensible heat TES, solar collector is expected to achieve higher outlet temperature to store more thermal energy at the same storage volume. Seasonal storage of surplus solar thermal energy is most suitable for a GSHP with underground storage in the form of a borehole TES, aquifer TES or a buried water tank in the ground (PCM). For SAASHP, short-term thermal energy storage in an HW storage tank for daily use is suitable, in particular, enhanced by PCM. In the future, as PCM is developed to improve the efficiency of TES and combined with the defrosting method for the smooth operation of systems with evaporator i.e. hybrid SAASHP, the collector outlet temperature should be above the phase change temperature.</p>
        <p>Further studies are needed to improve the defrosting process. In component level, the material or the structure of the air source evaporator can be optimised to prevent or reduce the freezing process.</p>
        <p>In system level, optimisation on system configuration is also a potential approach for dual source IX-SAASHP and hybrid SAASHP.</p>
        <p>Currently, refrigerants (e.g. R22, R134a, R410A and R407C) are widely used in HP systems due to their good thermodynamic and thermophysical properties. R32 is a more environmentally friendly alternative refrigerant for R410A in ASHP. However, it is classified as a flammable refrigerant A2L and therefore some countries are researching other retrofits, such as R454B. Therefore, future studies should concentrate more on the applications of environmentally friendly refrigerants in SAASHPs responding to global restrictions.</p>
        <p>The outcome of this review is expected highly beneficial and valuable to the academia and engineers working with SAASHP systems, the HP/solar collector manufacturers and suppliers, installers and service workers, policy makers and energy experts.</p>
