Providing modern energy for the approximately one billion people lacking reliable access to an electricity grid in a sustainable manner is an urgent global priority, as energy is fundamental to improve quality of life and enhance human development [1], [2].Many nations in the Global South have no access to reliable power supply.

        <p>India has historically been home to the largest population without electricity access [3]. Over 90% of those affected are poor or rural populations [4]. Despite expansion of the national electricity network, millions of people remain off-grid. Many areas already connected to the grid suffer from frequent blackouts and poor quality of power supply [5]. Incumbent energy technologies such as diesel generators have high operating costs and low efficiency. Moreover, diesel generators are major emitters of black carbon and greenhouse gases (GHG) and hazardous to human health [6]- [9].India has historically been home to the largest population without electricity access [3].

        <p>Biomass gasification is a thermochemical conversion process that converts biomass into a useful energy form known as producer gas. Gasification involves partial combustion of the biomass under limited oxygen supply, generating producer gas composed of the combustible gases H 2 , CO and CH 4 , as well as CO 2 , N 2 , tar and ash as by-products [11]. Clean producer gas can be used as a fuel in internal combustion engines to generate electricity.Biomass gasification is a thermochemical conversion process that converts biomass into a useful energy form known as producer gas.

        <p>Biomass power has immense potential in India given its large agrarian economy [12]. Feedstock is abundantly available in multiple forms, including agriculture and forestry residues, agroindustry wastes, and energy crops grown on marginal land [13]. The estimated surplus biomass available is about 120-150 MTpa, corresponding to a potential of ca. 18,000 MW of electrical generation capacity [14].Biomass power has immense potential in India given its large agrarian economy [12].

        <p>Small-scale (&lt; 100 kW e ) biomass gasifiers are a promising decentralized technology for rural electrification owing to their low cost, simple construction, local feedstock availability and technology maturity [15]. Biomass gasification-based power generation systems of 3-500 kW e are commercially available in India [16]. They have been developed and deployed for rural electrification in India since the 1980s [17]- [21]. A number of case studies have reported on operational viability [18]- [22]. However, a significant proportion of these projects have stopped functioning or are defective [20], [23]- [27]. Various limitations that were reported are summarized in Table 1 .Small-scale (&lt; 100 kW e ) biomass gasifiers are a promising decentralized technology for rural electrification owing to their low cost, simple construction, local feedstock availability and technology maturity [15].

        <p>Mini-grids are decentralized energy networks that can integrate a high mix of renewables to provide reliable energy supply to off-grid communities. They typically consist of energy generation from solar PV, biomass gasification, wind or diesel; battery storage; and balance of systems, and can be either off-grid or grid-connected. As mini-grids provide specialized services to a small group of consumers, they usually have higher energy prices compared to the main grid [35].Mini-grids are decentralized energy networks that can integrate a high mix of renewables to provide reliable energy supply to off-grid communities.

        <p>Diesel generators have been deployed extensively in mini-grids, and are forecasted to remain a vital component in project design for backup [36]. Escalating fuel prices and high emissions from diesel have pushed mini-grid developers to seek to incorporate renewable energy and storage into their mix [37]. Hybrid energy systems, consisting of two or more energy sources for generation of power, have emerged as a possible solution to increase the amount of generation for the same installed capacity, potentially making mini-grids more economically and financially attractive [38]- [40].Diesel generators have been deployed extensively in mini-grids, and are forecasted to remain a vital component in project design for backup [36].

        <p>Although many works have attempted to design biomass systems for rural electrification in the Global South, these have critical shortfalls from the perspective of real mini-grid operators. There is a need to investigate in closer detail the effect of technical and operating parameters such as the biomass gasifier capital cost (which scales non-linearly with component capacity [41]), maintenance requirements and downtime, and disruptions in feedstock supply which are expected to strongly impact project economics but are frequently neglected in the literature. While most studies have considered purely residential loads, the integration of high-consuming commercial or agricultural (so-called "productive") energy loads such as agro-processing and irrigation is beneficial to increase plant load factor, reduce electricity costs and improve viability of mini-grid projects [42], [43].Although many works have attempted to design biomass systems for rural electrification in the Global South, these have critical shortfalls from the perspective of real mini-grid operators.

        <p>This study addresses the need for an up-to-date study of the viability of biomass gasification for rural electrification to meet the real needs of agricultural, commercial and domestic users. India is used as a case study as its rural populations are representative of other nations from the Global South. We compare the economics of biomass with solar PV, diesel, PV-diesel and PV-biomass hybrids for electrification of a village with considerable productive loads. The novelty of this work lies in its use of realistic inputs for techno-economic analysis, namely the latest market prices for equipment, biomass feedstock and fuel [44], [45], and real-time seasonal energy demand data based on surveys of real commercial and agricultural users specific to a location, which is scarcely reported in the literature. We have also compared biomass gasifiers with different maintenance requirements, a key design decision that is frequently overlooked. The objective is to provide a framework to include operational considerations while designing mini-grid systems. The findings apply to least-cost design of mini-grids for provision of affordable, reliable low-carbon electricity supply to 1 billion people globally [46].This study addresses the need for an up-to-date study of the viability of biomass gasification for rural electrification to meet the real needs of agricultural, commercial and domestic users.

        <p>Energy demand data was collected from commercial and agricultural energy consumers in a severely under-electrified region in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India. Simulations of off-grid and grid-connected mini-grids under weak, medium and strong grid availability were run using 
            <rs type="software">HOMER</rs> software. The optimal mini-grid for each of five generation configurations were found, based on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), supply reliability and GHG emissions. A comparison of technical specifications of two different Indian gasifier suppliers was made considering their respective capital costs, maintenance requirements and downtime. Finally, a multivariate sensitivity test was used to examine how LCOE was affected by changes in biomass price and availability, gasification process parameters and battery lifetime.

        <p>The northern state of Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state in India [47] and contains the largest off-grid and underelectrified population [3], [5]. In eastern Uttar Pradesh lies Bahraich district, with a population of nearly 3.5 million as of 2011, of which 88% reside in rural areas [47]. Although according to the Government's web portal universal household electrification has been achieved [48], it is observed that villages receive fewer than fourteen hours of power supply on a typical day according to live grid monitoring (Prayas Energy Group, 2018 [5]). Eastern Uttar Pradesh has a largely agrarian economy [49], making it a potentially suitable location for biomass power.The northern state of Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state in India [47] and contains the largest off-grid and underelectrified population [3], [5].

        <p>Energy demand data was collected by surveying in the village of Nibiya (Nawabganj block, Nanpara tehsil), Bahraich, Uttar Pradesh, India in June 2018. The village has partial grid connectivity but poor supply of fewer than 8 hours per day as reported by residents, and villagers are reliant on diesel engines for commercial and agricultural power. A village walkthrough was carried out to identify the major electrical loads present (Table 2), which were used to construct a load profile. The village consists of roughly 80 households with limited domestic energy consumption, and whose lighting needs are mainly met by kerosene lamps. The major electrical loads are four irrigation pumps and one rice mill. Their energy consumption patterns were assessed through a primary survey with their owners. The survey consisted of questions about connectivity to the grid or another energy source, diesel fuel consumption, operating hours, devices (i.e. machines or appliances) present, device power ratings, and device time of use during the previous day, using a similar methodology to that reported by Sandwell et al. [49]. Information on the seasonal use of each device in each month of the year was also collected. Off-grid households were briefly visited to establish the basic needs of the households, which agreed with the findings of our 2016 study from a nearby location [49]. Survey data from the previous study was used to estimate household electrical energy demand. Details of the time of use and power rating of each device are provided in the electronic supplementary information (ESI, Section S1). The survey findings were validated by comparison with survey data collected from approximately 50 other nearby villages and from the literature [50].Energy demand data was collected by surveying in the village of Nibiya (Nawabganj block, Nanpara tehsil), Bahraich, Uttar Pradesh, India in June 2018.

This was used to calculate the time-step variability in HOMER, as described in section 2.5.2.

        <p>The load profile defines the total amount of electrical energy consumption by the system. HOMER takes hourly values of load profile as one of its inputs. The Python simulation described in Section 2.3 was used to provide the load profile. HOMER requires input of both a daily load profile as well as the load variability, adding randomness to the load data to make it more realistic. The time-step variability in HOMER was manually adjusted until the peak load of the resulting load profile matched the 100 th percentile run from the Python simulation. This allows for cases of maximal electricity demand to be considered, which is relevant when designing systems with high reliability requirements.The load profile defines the total amount of electrical energy consumption by the system.

        <p>We consider a mini-grid comprising energy generation (solar PV, biomass, diesel), a battery bank, converters, and a low voltage distribution network. A mature monocrystalline silicon PV technology mounted on fixed stainless-steel structures was considered for this study. The lifetime of the PV panels is taken as 20 years and the derating factor is considered at 80%. The operation of a biomass gasifier and producer gas engine are modelled together using HOMER's biomass module. The major physical properties of a gasifier are the maximum electrical output (in kW e ), lifetime in number of operating hours, and the biomass fuel curve, which gives the relation between quantity of fuel consumed to electrical power produced.We consider a mini-grid comprising energy generation (solar PV, biomass, diesel), a battery bank, converters, and a low voltage distribution network.

Component capital costs were taken either from recent literature sources or directly from supplier websites such as Indiamart and include local taxes and transport. Biomass gasifier component costs were obtained directly from two local suppliers, known as Supplier A (Karnataka, India) and Supplier B (Bihar, India). The biomass price was considered as 4 INR/kg (0.058 USD/kg) over the entire project duration [54]. For all components with lifetime of less than 20 years, the replacement cost was assumed to be 80% of the original capital cost. Fixed capital costs for the system were taken as INR 1,000,000 (USD 14,543) which includes the distribution network, distribution boxes and civil works; fixed operating costs were considered as INR 50,000 (USD 727) per year excluding salaries [53], [54]. The net CO 2 -equivalent (CO 2 e) emissions of electricity generated from various sources used to perform emissions savings calculations are also presented.

        <p>Modelling of mini-grids was carried out using HOMER. For this study, five different mini-grid configurations were considered, namely solar PV, biomass gasification, diesel, solar-biomass and solar-diesel generation. These were compared in both off-grid and grid-connected modes. The same load profile constructed from survey data representing Nibiya village was used for all mini-grid configurations. The simulation settings were for a period of 20 years, an inflation rate of 4.65% [64], and a discount rate of 6.25% [65]. The optimizer settings were as follows: 8,760 timesteps of one hour each; 20,000 simulations per optimization; system design and NPC precision of 0.001, and focus factor of 2.Modelling of mini-grids was carried out using HOMER.

        <p>Maintenance requirements of biomass gasifiers vary considerably according to the gasifier design, but cannot be investigated using HOMER's sensitivity analysis function. Simulations were thus carried out by considering different values of (1) the number of hours of continuous operation after which maintenance is required, and (2) the hours of downtime during each maintenance event. Four different scenarios were considered, taking either 1500 or 2500 hours of continuous operation followed by either 48 or 120 hours of downtime.Maintenance requirements of biomass gasifiers vary considerably according to the gasifier design, but cannot be investigated using HOMER's sensitivity analysis function.

        <p>Simulations of different AC mini-grid systems were carried out using HOMER. All mini-grids modelled considered energy generation, battery storage, converters and a low-voltage distribution network. The load to be served was a rural village in Bahraich district, Uttar Pradesh, India containing 80 households, 4 irrigation pumps and a rice mill. HOMER simulations were carried out for one year of operations and the costs extrapolated to 20 years. An identical load profile with average requirement of 180 kWh/day and an average peak load of 30.4 kW was used to model all configurations.Simulations of different AC mini-grid systems were carried out using HOMER.

        <p>First, the LCOE of five mini-grid configurations was compared in off-grid mode. Simulations were carried out using an annual capacity shortage constraint set to between 0 to 10% to obtain the configuration with the lowest LCOE. The capacity shortage constraint represents the maximum allowable shortfall of energy generation divided by total electric load annually; it was assumed that users would not accept lower reliability level than 90% [66]. Fig. 2 shows the variation of LCOE with annual capacity shortage for all mini-grid configurations considered.First, the LCOE of five mini-grid configurations was compared in off-grid mode.

        <p>Fig. 2 shows that as the energy shortfall approaches zero, the LCOE increases sharply for standalone mini-grids, agreeing with previous works [67], [68]. The increase in LCOE is most significant for biomass and PV below 4% capacity shortage, as they require higher battery storage capacity to meet high reliability constraints leading to high costs. This is especially apparent for a standalone biomass system, leading to a significantly oversized gasifier and battery bank in order to achieve near 0% energy shortfall. In contrast, diesel mini-grids show an almost constant price, other than at high reliability, as observed by Sandwell et al. [68]. This is as expected for an asset for which energy generation and costs are very closely linked.Fig. 2 shows that as the energy shortfall approaches zero, the LCOE increases sharply for standalone mini-grids, agreeing with previous works [67], [68].

        <p>Biomass gasification is the lowest-LCOE option amongst single generation sources for capacity shortage between 1-3%. This is attributed to the fact that solar power is intermittent, requiring a relatively large battery bank for backup compared to biomass. In this range, the maintenance times of biomass gasification can be accommodated and hence it is cheaper than solar. However, at very low capacity shortage of 1% or less, biomass gasification becomes more expensive than even diesel generation. This is linked to the gasifier maintenance requirements, which are compensated for by oversizing the gasifier and battery bank, resulting in low capacity utilization and excessive capital costs.Biomass gasification is the lowest-LCOE option amongst single generation sources for capacity shortage between 1-3%.

        <p>The marginal cost of higher reliability is greatest for annual capacity shortage of 4% or less. If greater than 4% blackout is permissible, the marginal difference in LCOE for all standalone systems is relatively lower. In the case of hybrid systems, the threshold reliability level is around 1%. Considering PV, the additional cost of providing more reliable service can be reduced by using a biomass gasifier or diesel generator to provide backup power in lieu of a larger battery bank. This agrees with previous findings that hybrid mini-grids can potentially provide much more reliable service at a lower cost [31], [69]. Hybrid mini-grids show more linear behavior in response to varying reliability as witnessed by others [68]. PV-Bio is cheaper than PV-Diesel when very high reliability is required, as the system relies heavily on Bio or Diesel for backup power which incurs higher costs for the diesel system.The marginal cost of higher reliability is greatest for annual capacity shortage of 4% or less.

        <p>In subsequent parts of this study, the annual capacity shortage was set at 4% for all mini-grid configurations. At this reliability level, the LCOE for solar, biomass and diesel were 13.7, 14.2 and 26.5 INR/kWh respectively. The LCOE for standalone Bio lies in the range reported by Buragohain et al. [15] of 13.5-15 INR/kWh dependent on the plant load factor. Cost declines in PV of nearly 40% have been witnessed in recent years [44], which has resulted in PV becoming the lowest-LCOE option at 13.7 INR/kWh. Further capital cost decreases are expected for solar PV with ongoing research, while diesel fuel prices are expected to rise due to high volatility and recent deregulation [70].In subsequent parts of this study, the annual capacity shortage was set at 4% for all mini-grid configurations.

        <p>These LCOE values represent minimum tariffs to recover unsubsidized capital costs and operating costs. As expected, all LCOE values found are significantly higher than the subsidized grid tariff in Uttar Pradesh of 5 INR/kWh [71]. Mini-grid tariffs higher than grid tariffs do not preclude consumer willingness to pay for electricity, provided that, service reliability can be offered [72]. Cost-competitiveness with incumbent diesel generation is more critical. All renewable mini-grid options evaluated offered an LCOE around half the price of diesel generation (INR 26/kWh). These optimal configurations are examined in more detail in Table 8. From Table 8, it was observed that systems with high PV penetration (i.e. PV and PV-Diesel), a large amount of excess electricity was generated, with ca. 110,000-150,000 kWh/year generated respectively, compared to the need of 65,700 kWh/year. In off-grid systems, the excess electrical power not directly consumed or stored cannot be sold. In the advent of feed-in tariffs for grid-connected mini-grids, the export and sales of electricity to the national grid would improve project economics.These LCOE values represent minimum tariffs to recover unsubsidized capital costs and operating costs.

        <p>To better understand the reality of a mini-grid supplying power with 4% capacity shortage from the consumer and operator perspective, the timings at which insufficient power is available were examined. The unmet load occurring in a simulated year of operations was obtained from HOMER for optimized mini-grid configurations reported in Table . The blackout timings are presented in Fig. 3.To better understand the reality of a mini-grid supplying power with 4% capacity shortage from the consumer and operator perspective, the timings at which insufficient power is available were examined.

        <p>Fig. 3 shows that biomass gasification and diesel generation show similar energy shortage patterns, with two main peaks of unmet load representing scheduled maintenance. For PV, several peaks of lower magnitude are observed, reflecting seasonal power shortages in the early and late monsoon when demand from irrigation and agro-processing loads is high (June and September) and winter weather experiencing lower solar radiation (December-January). The blackout profile for the PV-Diesel mini-grid is similar to standalone PV, as the hybrid system is mostly supplied by PV generation. However, the magnitude of the unmet load was slightly lower during each blackout event. For PV-Bio, only one major blackout period was observed.Fig. 3 shows that biomass gasification and diesel generation show similar energy shortage patterns, with two main peaks of unmet load representing scheduled maintenance.

        <p>From a consumer perspective, PV and PV-Diesel mini-grids offer the least convenient option, with frequent occurrences of minor blackouts. PV-Bio seems to offer the best performance with only one major blackout. However, the acceptability by the consumer depends on their level of awareness and understanding about the downtime needed for maintenance, whether maintenance times can be scheduled to coincide with periods of low demand, and whether non-essential loads can be shifted around expected downtime.From a consumer perspective, PV and PV-Diesel mini-grids offer the least convenient option, with frequent occurrences of minor blackouts.

        <p>Next, the effect of the presence of the national grid on mini-grid economics was investigated. This is crucial because of the Government of India's ambitious drive towards national grid extension, meaning that mini-grids are increasingly likely to be built in areas with existing grid connectivity. Rather than being competing power sources, consumers can exploit dual mini-grid and grid connections to benefit from the high service reliability of mini-grids combined with low national grid tariffs. Grid electricity can either be consumed directly (no battery charging) or used to charge the battery bank to reduce the generation capacity needed (battery charging). Scenarios where excess electricity generated by the minigrid is sold back to the national grid were not considered here.Next, the effect of the presence of the national grid on mini-grid economics was investigated.

        <p>Grid availability was modelled as weak, moderate or strong. These scenarios are respectively characterized by 10, 17 and 23 hours of power supply per day in winter months, and 0.6, 15 and 15 hours in summer. The LCOE results for cost-optimized mini-grids obtained from HOMER simulations are presented in Table 9. Moving from off-grid mini-grids to those with greater grid penetration, system LCOE decreases progressively as the grid supply improves. This reflects the increasing proportion of consumer demand that is met by cheaper national grid electricity, causing the overall LCOE to decrease by up to 30% for the same level of service for renewable mini-grids. The greatest reduction of LCOE of up to 50% was observed for Diesel mini-grids owing to the greater cost differential. This represents the prevalent practice in rural India of using diesel generation to complement the grid in weak-grid areas. However, in both off-grid and gridconnected scenarios, diesel mini-grids were always more expensive than renewable energy based mini-grids on an LCOE basis. Among standalone mini-grids, PV yielded the lowest LCOE; this cost advantage was maintained across all grid supply scenarios. Interestingly, there appears to be a rational argument for developing solar PV mini-grids in gridconnected areas with good supply, as the grid acts as a cheap backup when solar power is unavailable to reduce battery storage requirements. In reality the grid situation in rural areas of northern and eastern India is most accurately represented by a weak grid [5], where PV-Bio followed closely by PV and PV-Diesel mini-grids were most economical.Grid availability was modelled as weak, moderate or strong.

        <p>The potential emissions mitigation for each mini-grid configuration was assessed by calculating the annual CO 2 e emissions saved compared to an off-grid diesel mini-grid. The latter was calculated to emit 58.6 ktCO 2 e/year, based on 21,772 liters of diesel fuel consumed annually. The percentage GHG emissions savings for various off-grid and grid-connected (weak grid without battery charging) mini-grids relative to the standalone Diesel case are presented in Fig. 4.The potential emissions mitigation for each mini-grid configuration was assessed by calculating the annual CO 2 e emissions saved compared to an off-grid diesel mini-grid.

        <p>For off-grid systems, all configurations offered large savings in GHG emissions of between 82-91% compared to an off-grid Diesel mini-grid with the same level of service. The emissions from PV are due to considerable GHGs embedded in their manufacture and are comparable to emissions savings from standalone biomass generation. However, GHG savings for grid-connected Bio and PV-Bio are reduced to 67% and 72%, respectively, owing to reliance on carbon-intensive grid supply, whereas savings for PV-dominated systems remain high. These calculations do not take into account the GHG emissions from contingency usage of fossil fuels such as kerosene lamps during power shortages or blackouts. Based on our analysis, PV-based systems and standalone off-grid Bio are the lower-GHG option overall.For off-grid systems, all configurations offered large savings in GHG emissions of between 82-91% compared to an off-grid Diesel mini-grid with the same level of service.

        <p>A multivariate sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the effect of five uncertain parameters on the mini-grid economics -battery lifetime, biomass feedstock cost, biomass feedstock availability, gasification ratio (GR), and biomass requirements of the gasifier. This sensitivity analysis was carried out assuming 4% annual capacity shortage. The results are shown in Fig. 5 below for standalone Bio and for PV-Bio mini-grids in both off-grid and gridconnected modes. For a Bio system, the LCOE is extremely sensitive to the biomass price, gasification ratio and biomass required by the system. These impact the sufficiency of producer gas to run the generator in the absence of which a bigger battery bank is required for backup, pushing up the LCOE. Biomass supply disruptions are very likely to occur in practice, as agricultural residues and woody biomass feedstocks have complex informal supply chains and seasonal availability [73]. This illustrates the need for more field testing of biomass gasification-based mini-grids as these challenges may lead to escalating operating costs or decreasing service levels and eventual project shutdown.A multivariate sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the effect of five uncertain parameters on the mini-grid economics -battery lifetime, biomass feedstock cost, biomass feedstock availability, gasification ratio (GR), and biomass requirements of the gasifier.

        <p>The LCOE and its sensitivity to uncertainty parameters was seen to reduce as the number of available power generation sources was increased. If one generation source is affected, another can set in to mitigate the effect, reducing the requirement for oversizing the gasifier or battery bank. Greater sensitivity was observed for a biomass gasification system connected to a weak grid than for off-grid PV-Bio systems. This may be because the component sizes are smaller and the system becomes less reliant on the biomass gasifier with the availability of PV. At 4% capacity shortage, a grid-connected hybrid system PV-Bio provided both the lowest LCOE and greatest security of power supply in the event of a disruption in biomass feedstock supply. From Fig. 6, the economics of biomass gasification-based mini-grids are very sensitive to maintenance time. As the continuous running hours were reduced and the downtime increased, the LCOE increased significantly, an effect that was strongest for standalone Bio systems (Fig. 6a) at high reliability. Energy shortfall in these systems arises from multiple long periods of maintenance, which becomes a significant part of (or greater than) the permitted shortfall. In practice, maintenance could be scheduled to coincide with periods of low demand to avoid the need for a costly oversized battery bank. For hybrid systems, in the absence of power supply from PV or the grid, gasifier downtime for maintenance must be compensated by a larger battery bank, which increases the LCOE though to a much less significant degree than for standalone systems. Systems with 2500 hours of continuous operation were consistently cheaper than those with only 1500 hours. This signifies that a gasification system requiring more frequent maintenance is subject to much higher LCOE if the operator is to offer a reliable service. Again, the availability of a larger number of power generation sources reduced the cost for the same level of reliability.The LCOE and its sensitivity to uncertainty parameters was seen to reduce as the number of available power generation sources was increased.

        <p>For a standalone system (Fig. 7a), it can be observed that Gasifier A is cheaper on an LCOE basis than Gasifier B when high reliability (less than 2% shortfall) is required. Where the number of hours of operation required is high, Gasifier A offers lower LCOE as it has lower running costs. For both Gasifier A and B, LCOE increases sharply to reach 50 and 55 INR/kWh for 0% energy shortfall, respectively. At low capacity shortage the maintenance-intensive Gasifier B becomes less cost-effective as long periods of downtime must be compensated by a large battery bank, increasing costs. If service reliability is paramount, it is recommended to invest in a more robust gasification system requiring less maintenance. If annual capacity shortage greater than 2% is permissible, Gasifier B offers significant cost savings at ~11 INR/kWh compared to Gasifier A at ~13.5 INR/kWh.For a standalone system (Fig. 7a), it can be observed that Gasifier A is cheaper on an LCOE basis than Gasifier B when high reliability (less than 2% shortfall) is required.

        <p>For hybrid PV-Bio systems (Fig. 7b), as seen earlier, most of the generation is from PV and so the sensitivity to fuel requirements and maintenance times is reduced. As a result, the most significant contribution to the LCOE is the capital investment for building the gasifier. Hence, the cheaper Gasifier B always provides cheaper electricity than Gasifier A. This comparison of gasifier manufacturers does not take into the account the ground realities of operating and maintaining biomass gasifiers in rural India. Our analysis assumes that gasifier and engine servicing are provided on-time, feedstock requirements are always met, and skilled manpower is readily available. Reports from real-life projects indicate that these practical difficulties escalate costs, delay project delivery and reduce profitability of the projects significantly [22], [73]- [75]. This makes hybrid projects significantly more risky than standalone projects and highlights the needs for further on-ground testing.For hybrid PV-Bio systems (Fig. 7b), as seen earlier, most of the generation is from PV and so the sensitivity to fuel requirements and maintenance times is reduced.

        <p>The findings in sections 3.1-3.3 have shown that hybrid systems appear to be more economical and resilient to uncertainty in technical and operating parameters than standalone systems. In this section, the trade-offs between service reliability, cost and generation sources were examined for designing hybrid PV-Bio mini-grid systems. Two annual capacity shortage cases of 0.5% and 4% were compared and the mix of solar PV and biomass capacity was varied. While very small PV modules are available on the market, the smallest capacity of downdraft biomass gasifiers is usually around 10 kW e . In the following section, we present a theoretical case where any capacity of biomass gasifier is feasible and the initial gasifier capital costs are as for Gasifier A (see Table 3). The resulting effect on LCOE is shown in Fig 8 . The proportion of power generation from biomass gasification was varied from 0 to 100%, shown on the horizontal axis. The LCOE was plotted on the primary vertical axis (left), while the secondary vertical axis (right) shows the capacity of each of the components (PV, biomass, batteries) with different units. The scale of y-axes are not consistent across Fig. 8a and8b.The findings in sections 3.1-3.3 have shown that hybrid systems appear to be more economical and resilient to uncertainty in technical and operating parameters than standalone systems.

        <p>In a system with 0.5% annual capacity shortage (Fig. 8a), the LCOE follows the same qualitative behavior as the storage capacity in the hybrid system. 100% solar or 100% biomass gasification cases require the largest battery banks to overcome intermittency of solar and to cover for gasifier maintenance times, respectively. This leads to a sharp increase in system LCOE for single-source generation systems. However, if solar and biomass are used in combination, the dependency on battery bank can be minimized. The optimal system configuration had a biomass power component of 45%, and a minimum LCOE of 12 INR/kWh.In a system with 0.5% annual capacity shortage (Fig. 8a), the LCOE follows the same qualitative behavior as the storage capacity in the hybrid system. 100% solar or 100% biomass gasification cases require the largest battery banks to overcome intermittency of solar and to cover for gasifier maintenance times, respectively.

        <p>If the capacity shortage constraint is relaxed to 4%, the LCOE is considerably lower and less sensitive to the size of battery bank (Fig. 8b). In this case, the LCOE is more dependent on the total generation capacity of the system. The optimal energy mix was found to be around 43% of power generation capacity from biomass gasification with LCOE around 12.5 INR/kWh (Fig. 8c), similar to the 0.5% annual capacity shortage case. We attribute this to the fact that less reliable power supply can accommodate more solar power generation which is cheaper, so the LCOE is unaffected by higher reliability requirement, as seen in Fig. 2.If the capacity shortage constraint is relaxed to 4%, the LCOE is considerably lower and less sensitive to the size of battery bank (Fig. 8b).

        <p>To summarize, when designing hybrid mini-grids, there is an interplay between the mix of technologies, the reliability requirement, and their impact on LCOE. Mini-grid designers should carefully consider the annual capacity shortage that is acceptable to consumers. If a high level of reliability is desired, the costs can be reduced by minimizing the storage capacity; otherwise, the generation capacity should be lowered to save costs.To summarize, when designing hybrid mini-grids, there is an interplay between the mix of technologies, the reliability requirement, and their impact on LCOE.

        <p>We conclude that hybrid solar and biomass gasification-based mini-grids theoretically have potential to provide electricity at a cheaper cost than their standalone parts. This study also highlighted the theoretical trade-offs between service reliability and project economics. However, the current and future consumer demand and degree of service reliability required must be carefully considered during system design. Finally, the operational feasibility needs to be validated by field testing of hybrid mini-grids, which are more complex and require more rigorous training of staff, a notable challenge in rural markets facing shortages of skilled labor.We conclude that hybrid solar and biomass gasification-based mini-grids theoretically have potential to provide electricity at a cheaper cost than their standalone parts.

        <p>A sensitivity analysis was carried out to study the effect of gasifier maintenance requirements on biomass-based mini-grids. Four different cases (1500 and 2500 running hours of continuous operation, followed by either 48 or 120 hours of downtime) were considered based on manufacturer recommendations. The gasifier capital costs remained the same (Gasifier A). The resulting LCOE for standalone Bio and PV-Bio, in both off-grid and weakgrid connected modes, was plotted against annual capacity shortage in Fig. 6. The LCOE values ranged considerably, so the reader should pay careful attention to the y-axes scaling.A sensitivity analysis was carried out to study the effect of gasifier maintenance requirements on biomass-based mini-grids.
