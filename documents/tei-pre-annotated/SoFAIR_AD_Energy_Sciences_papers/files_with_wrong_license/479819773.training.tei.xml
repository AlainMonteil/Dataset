        <p>Hybrid Metal Organic-Frameworks (MOF)/polymer materials have gathered many researcher's consideration thanks to their varied functionalities and high processability.</p>
        <p>Herein, Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have been successfully incorporated into an acrylate polymer network by photopolymerization upon mild visible light irradiation at 405 nm. The synthesized MOF/polymer composites were very efficient for Acid Black removal from water reaching 96% of decomposition after 30 and 45 min of UV-Lamp irradiation in the presence of MIL-53(Cr)/polymer and HKUSTI-1(Cu)/polymer composites, respectively. Probing further, the photo-composites were characterized by several techniques including Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray analyses (EDX), X-Ray Diffraction analysis (DRX), Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) specific surface area, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) and UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The different methods used to characterized the MOF-containing polymers revealed these polymers to exhibit a high rigidity, an excellent thermal stability, an interesting band gap energy as well as an exceptional stability after their reuse for many photocatalytic treatment cycles.</p>
        <p>Water is the most important resource for living species. Protecting scarce water bodies from pollution caused by continuous population growth, urbanization and industrial revolution, is a vital responsibility shared between states and citizens 1 . In fact, during the last few years, water quality was deteriorated because of its contamination by emergent pollutants such as pharmaceutical compounds 2 , personal care products 3 and especially organic dyes released into the environment by the paper, textile, cosmetic, food and pharmaceutical industries 4 . These synthetic dyes represent a threat for human health and ecosystem because of their toxicity, non-biodegradability, and their carcinogenic effects 5 .</p>
        <p>To mitigate the harmful effect of those organic dyes on the environment and to satisfy the demands of people for clean and safe water, several chemical, physical and biological techniques have been employed to remove those pollutants from water including adsorption on activated carbon 6 , chemical precipitation 7 , microbial degradation 8 , electrocoagulation 9 … However, these methods are generally not economic, difficult to manage, and lead usually to the formation of another type of pollution by producing sideproducts sometimes more toxic than the initial compounds 10,11 . Therefore, these conventional processes can't be considered as durable and sustainable solutions for the treatment of such biorecalcitrant pollutants. In this context, great attention has been focused on advanced oxidation processes based on highly reactive species. Though, photocatalysis has emerged as a new, viable, green and performant technique for the total removal and mineralization of numerous emergent pollutants [12][13][14][15] . Photodegradation consists on irradiating a large band gap of semiconductors such as Titanium dioxide which is the most used photocatalyst nowadays, thanks to its low cost, chemical stability and abundance 1 . However, pure TiO2 absorbs only 4% of sunlight due to its high band gap energy (3.2 eV), and needs generally the presence of oxidative agents such as hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution to achieve the total degradation of organic pollutants 1 . Consequently, it was interesting for researchers to develop new photocatalysts systems like ZnO 16 , WO3 17 , CdS 18 , ZnS 19 , Polyoxometalates 15 … Metals Organics Frameworks (MOFs) are a more complex photocatalytically active material that have received a lot of attention from researchers for their adsorption properties thanks to their highly specific surface area. However, their photocatalytic activity has not been too much explored.</p>
        <p>Metals Organics Framework (MOFs), known as porous coordination polymers (PCPs), are a new category of crystalline porous materials, formed by a periodic network between metal ions or clusters with organic ligands such as terephtalatic and trimesic acids, linked by strong coordination bonds 20 . Depending on their desired applications and thanks to the unlimited possible combinations between metals and ligands, several type of MOFs with different chemical and physical properties, could be synthesized 21 . Consequently, these materials were applied in various fields such as biomedicine for drugs vectorization 22 , gas storage 23 , uranium extraction 24 as well as photocatalysis 25 thanks to the behavior of certain MOFs like semiconductors. In fact, upon irradiation, electrons could transit from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) creating holes in HOMO 26 . The generated holes could oxidize directly the pollutants adsorbed on its surface or generate highly reactive chemicals such as . OH radicals which promote the degradation.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the electron ejected to the LUMO can directly reduce the adsorbed pollutant or react with O2, producing superoxide radicals (O2 .-).</p>
        <p>Latterly, researchers have focused their attention on developing MOFs acting like photocatalysts. MOF-5 27 , UiO-66(Zr) 28 and MIL-125(Ti) 29 were firstly used for the degradation of phenol, organophosphate and methylene blue respectively. Though, the effectiveness of these photosensitive materials were limited to UV light (λ &lt; 365 nm) 26 . Hence, MOFs active under visible light were more required for heterogeneous photocatalysis. In this sense, in 2017 Wang and al have reported the Fe-based MOFs performance for several photocatalytic applications including pollutants degradation, CO2 reduction and water oxidation 30 . Moreover, MOFs MIL-53 (M= Fe, Cr, Al) were applied for methylene blue degradation under UV-Visible and visible light irradiation by Jing-Jing Du and al 31 . . The MOFs large specific surface area, the ease of synthesis, the low cost and diversified functionalities of MOFs have made these structures very attractive for numerous research fields. However, these materials existing as water-soluble powders, are generally of poor physical properties, instable, degradable by humid air, hard to manipulate, hydrolytically, chemically and thermally instable which limits their regeneration at the end of photocatalytic processes 32,33 . Face to these considerations, many efforts have been made to enhance MOFs properties such as post-synthetic ligand exchange 34 , ion exchange 35 , addition of nanoparticles, biomolecule, clusters 36,37 and associating MOFs with polymer inside or outside their pores. In fact, Li Peng et al, have synthesized a MOF/PDA(Polydopamine) composite by in-situ polymerization, with better water and CO2 adsorption properties compared to the initial MOF 32 . J.Pastore et al have also incorporated PAA (Poly (pyromellitic dianhydride-co-4,4′oxydianiline) into MOF structure by post-synthetic ligand exchange method which have improved their hydrolytically stability 33 . Furthermore, an hybrid composite HKUST-1@PAM (polyacrylamide) was synthesized by O'Neill et al using solvothermal methods or immersion in mother solution which have improved the resistance of the initial MOF against mechanical attrition and have enhanced the recovery and recyclability of crystalline MOF 38 . Herein, the first example of MOF/Polymer composites, synthesized by photopolymerization which is a green method realized at ambient temperature with high speed process, under harmless and low-priced LED irradiation source and without releasing volatile organic compounds was tested for the first time as photocatalyst for the photodegradation of Acid Black 39 . The exceptional materials obtained by photopolymerization exhibit the remarkable stability of the classical crosslinked polymers and retain the remarkable photocatalytic properties of MOFs, even after incorporation into polymers. By mean of this strategy, the chemical stability of Metal Organic Frameworks in water has been drastically improved, facilitating their use for photodegradation of pollutants by the easiness of manipulation and the facility of regeneration. Indeed, when incorporated into polymers, the unavoidable filtration or centrifugation step which are time-consuming methods for MOFs particles recovering can be advantageously avoided.</p>
        <p>Therefore, upon UV-Lamp irradiation and without the addition of oxidative agents, the newly developed composites could maintain a highly photocatalytic activity for the Acid Black removal from water, even after 10 successive catalytic cycles. Such applications of immobilized MOFs for pollutant photodegradation has only been scarcely reported in the literature. A few examples exist in the literature. However, these catalysts were mostly used as powdered samples for pollutants catalytic degradation, and not incorporated into polymers 40 . The azo dye Acid Black was chosen as a model pollutant for monitoring MOF/Polymer composites efficiency because of its massive presence in textile industries effluent and due to its carcinogenic effects 41,42 . Degradation mechanism was also investigated by studying the effect of atmosphere or radical scavengers on the composite's photocatalytic activities. Finally, the photo-composites stability, surface structure, porosity, optical properties and regeneration were characterized by several analytical techniques including Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray analyses (EDX), Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-Ray Diffraction analysis (DRX), BET specific surface area, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) and UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.</p>
        <p>MOFs synthesis MIL-53(Cr) was prepared as previously described [43][44][45] HKUST-1 crystallizes under solvothermal [46][47][48] conditions from a clear solution prepared by dissolving copper(II) nitrate hemi-(pentahydrate) and benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid in a mixture consisting of equal parts of N,N-dimethylformamide, ethanol and deionized water at 383 K for 12 hours. The solid was then scrubbed in N,N-dimethylformamide at RT to remove unreacted reagents and immersed in the appropriate activation solvent (dichloromethane) to exchange the occluded solvent for 3 days, during which the activation solvent was freshly replenished three times.</p>
        <p>Trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA from Allnex) was selected as monomer for composite synthesis. Bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)iodonium hexafluorophosphate (Iod or Speedcure 938), Phenyl bis (2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide (BAPO or Speedcure BPO) was obtained from Lambson Ltd (UK) and were used as co-initiator and photoinitiator, respectively. Acid Black, 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) and EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. The 4-methoxyphenol (MEHQ) was obtained from Alfa Aesar.The chemical structures of the reagents used in this study are given by Figure 1. photoinitiating system were deposited in a mold to define the final shape of polymer or composite which is equal to 1.3 mm. The evolution of the double bond content of TMPTA during the polymerization reaction was followed by real-time Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy at 4730 cm -1 for thick samples. Light Emitting Diodes LED@405 nm, I0 = 100 mW.cm -2 was used as the irradiation source.</p>
        <p>Photocatalytic performance of MIL-53(Cr)/polymer and HKUSTI-1(Cu)/polymer composites were evaluated by Acid Black removal from water. Acid Black samples were prepared by dissolving 15 mg in 1 L of distilled water corresponding to an initial concentration of 24.25 µmol/L. The pH of the solution was equal to 5.9.</p>
        <p>When experiments were carried out in the presence of MOF/polymer composites, the prepared composite in the form of pellet were added directly to the analysis cuvette in the presence of 4 mL of the Acid Black solution (15 ppm). In all cases, monitoring of the compound concentration in solution at 618 nm over time was performed using a JASCO V730 spectrophotometer. The solutions were analyzed in a spectrophotometer cell with 1 cm path length, and data were collected in absorbance mode.</p>
        <p>The discoloration dye rate at different irradiation time was calculated by the following formula (eq.1):</p>
        <p>) ×100 (eq.1)</p>
        <p>Where 𝐴𝑏𝑠 𝑡 = 0 and 𝐴𝑏𝑠 𝑡 are the measured dyes absorbances before and after a given time 't' of irradiation.</p>
        <p>Swelling experiments were realized by impregnating composites and polymer in water for 24h. The swelling ratio was calculated using the following formula (eq.2):</p>
        <p>Where Wd is the initial weight of polymer or composite and Ws is the weight of swollen polymer or composite.</p>
        <p>Also, the dry extracts of the composites were calculated after the swelling experiments by drying them in an oven at 50° C for 1h. The dry extract was calculated using the following formula (eq.3):</p>
        <p>Where Wsd = Weight of dried polymer or composite after swelling.</p>
        <p>The Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) was realized using TGA Mettler Toledo TGA/DSC3+. The experiments were carried out at temperatures ranging from 30°C to 800 °C and were accessed at a heating rate of 10 K/min under a dry airflow of 100 mL/min.</p>
        <p>For morphological characterization, JSM-7900F Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) from JEOL was used in this study. It was equipped with an annular detector from DEBEN for transmission images.</p>
        <p>Energy-dispersive X-ray analyses were realized using the system QUANTAX double detector from Bruker.</p>
        <p>X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded using a Panalytical X'Pert PRO diffractometer equipped with a Cu X-ray tube (lCuKa = 0.1542 nm) operating at 45 kV and 40 mA, and a X'Celerator detector. (A verifier avec Laure Michelin).</p>
        <p>Fourier transform infrared absorption spectra were recorded on a thermo scientific is-50 FTIR spectrometer, using a diamond golden gate ATR accessory (GRASEBY) from SPECAC, in the range of 650-4000 cm -1 .</p>
        <p>Surface properties and rigidity of the different composites were examined using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) techniques. AFM measurements were performed using a Bruker</p>
        <p>Multimode IV, with a Nanoscope V controller and an E "vertical" scanner (Bruker), by the Peak Force Quantitative Nanomechanical Mapping (PF-QNM, Bruker) method. PF-QNM is a contact AFM mode, based on the force-volume method. A calibration procedure was first followed.</p>
        <p>All quantitative measurements were carried out with NCLR cantilever (Nano World) with a spring constant of 48 N/m and a resonance frequency of 190 kHz, a width of 38 µm and a length of 225 µm. Thanks to the Sader method, the Actual spring constant was determined and found to be around 27 N/m. Then, the deflection sensitivity (around 32 nm/V) was measured on a sapphire surface. The Tip radius was calibrated against a polystyrene standard provided by Bruker. The measured value of the tip radius was 10 nm. The Poisson's ratio was assumed to be equal to 0.3. To get relevant results, the cantilever and the tip geometry are taking into account in the PF-QNM measurements. For all experiments, an area of 5 µm x 5 µm (256×256 pixels at 0.6 Hz) was taken at three different areas on the sample surface. (A verifier avec Aissam)</p>
        <p>The textural characteristics of the different samples were determined from nitrogen adsorption/desorption at 77.35 K using micromeritics ASAP 2420 instrument. BET specific surface area and average pore diameter (Gurlich law) were calculated by using the standard Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) method based on adsorption data.</p>
        <p>The samples were degassed at 25°C for 60 hours on degassing port and weighted. Then, the samples were degassed once again at 25°C for 4 hours on the analysis port to extract the trapped nitrogen. Analyses were realized with a reactor of the free volume to optimize the measurement and the free volumes were determined after analysis to avoid the pollution of the samples.</p>
        <p>Dynamic storage modulus G' and dynamic loss modulus G'' of different synthesized composites were evaluated in order to determine their mechanical properties in bulk. The Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) was measured using DMA Mettler Toledo DMA861e.</p>
        <p>Due to the opaque nature of the composites, spectroscopy measurements were performed using the UV-Visible spectrophotometer (JASCO V-750) equipped with an integrating sphere.</p>
        <p>The photopolymerization technique was used to synthesize the different MOF/polymer composites by transforming the liquid-filled formulation containing TMPTA as the monomer and MOF as the fillers. This technique proved to be the most appropriate approach for incorporating MOFs into polymers since not heat was necessary to initiate the polymerization process thus avoiding the thermal degradation of MOFs that could occur during a classical thermal polymerization. The photopolymerization process is also extremely fast, enabling a facile access to composites. The obtained photopolymerization profiles for the free radical polymerization (FRP) of TMPTA are reported in Figure 2. irradiation time) under air upon exposure to a LED@405 nm (A) in the presence of BAPO/Iod/MIL-53(Cr) (1) (0.2%/1%/0% (w/w/w)), (2) (0.2%/1%/0.5% (w/w/w)), (3) (0.2%/1%/1% (w/w/w)), (4) (0.2%/1%/2% (w/w/w)), (5) (0.2%/0%/1% (w/w/w)); (B) in the presence of BAPO/Iod/HKUST-1(Cu) (1) (0.2%/1%/0 (w/w/w)), (2) (0.2%/1%/0.5% (w/w/w)),</p>

Addition of the iodonium salt in the formulations was carried out in order to be able to compare under the same conditions, the current results with those obtained in previous works on POMs/Polymer composites where the presence of this co-initiator had significantly improved the photopolymerization rates as well as the materials photocatalytic efficiency.</p>
        <p>The photocatalytic activity of the different developed MOF/polymer composites will be discussed latter in section 3.4.</p>
        <p>Stability of photocatalysts is one of the most important parameters that has to be considered for an industrial application. Therefore, for a better application of our photocomposites in the photocatalytic field, stability of polymers in solutions and at high temperatures was examined.</p>
        <p>Water is the most interesting solvent in heterogenous photocatalysis for practical environmental use. Therefore, in order to investigate MOF/polymer composites stability, swelling experiments were realized in this solvent. Dry extract ratio was also calculated to evaluate the monomer loss probability after polymerization. Based on the literature, the very low obtained swelling ratio of the different synthesized materials suggests a highly crosslinked acrylate network despite the presence of MOFs into the polymers 49 . Moreover, the calculated dry extract ratio indicates a low probability of monomer loss after the polymerization process which is in agreement with the final high acrylate polymerization rates. Hence, the obtained results shown in the Table 1 suggest an excellent stability of the composites in water.</p>
        <p>In order to evaluate the thermal stability of polymers and MOF/polymer composites, TGA analyses have been realized. Decomposition temperatures of the different synthesized materials are showed in Figure 3 and the results are gathered in Table 2.</p>
        <p>In order to verify the MOFs immobilization into the polymers and considering that heterogenous photocatalysis is a phenomenon occuring at the photocatalyst surface, morphological and structural characterizations of the developed composites were carried out.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, for practical applications, it is also important to investigate their optical and mechanical properties.</p>
        <p>The Additionally, Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was realized in order to obtain additional informations about MOFs dispersion at the surfaces of the synthesized composites and to confirm the encapsulation of these catalysts into the polymers (See Figure 5). In conclusion, TEM, SEM and EDX demonstrate that MOFs are clearly well incorporated into the polymer matrix by photopolymerization which is an easy synthesis method.</p>
        <p>In order to verify the MOFs incorporation into the polymer matrix, the different developed composites were qualitatively and structurally characterized by FTIR spectroscopy and by X-Ray Diffraction.</p>
        <p>Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of MOFs, composites and polymer were acquired in the 600-4500 cm -1 region and the different spectra are shown in Figure 6. The MIL-53(Cr) FTIR Figure 7 displays the FTIR spectrum of 2% HKUSTI-1(Cu)/polymer composite, HKUSTI-1(Cu) crystalline and the polymer. Table 4 shows the wavenumber of the most important HKUSTI-1(Cu) functional groups. The peak at 729 cm -1 is attributed to the Cu-O bond 51,52 . The C=C stretching vibration of benzene is characterized by a strong band at 1370 cm -1 51,53 . Moreover, bands arounds 1450 and 1644 cm -1 represent C-O symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations, respectively 51,53 . Also, the wide band between 3000 and 3500cm -1 corresponds to -OH water stretching vibration 51 . Due to the low HKUSTI-1(Cu) mass percentage incorporated into the polymer, the characteristic peaks of this MOF were hardly distinguished from those of the polymer matrix.</p>
        <p>In order to deeply analyze the molecular structure of composites and to get further insight on the structural variations of the catalyst after its incorporation into the polymer matrix, XRD analyses were carried out (See Figure 8). or Cr III (OH).{O2C-C6H4-CO2}.H2O already reported by the literature 44 . This latter is represented by a three-dimensional structure formed by chromium (III) octahedra and terephthalate ions, creating a three-dimensional framework with a one-dimensional pore channel system containing water molecules interacting with oxygen atoms or hydroxyl groups of the inorganic network through hydrogen bonds (figure 1) 44 .</p>
        <p>The crystal structure of [Cu3(TMA)2(H20)3]n known as HKUSTI-1(Cu) was previously reported by Chui et al 46 . and Schlichte et al 54 . This Framework forms face-centered-cubic crystals with an interconnecting three-dimensional system of large pores holding additional water molecules 46 .</p>
        <p>The main XRD peaks of the synthesized MIL-53(Cr)/polymer composites are identical to that of the crystalline MIL-53(Cr) powder indicating no crystallinity changes during the photopolymerization process. Moreover, the peaks on the XRD patterns of HKUSTI-1(Cu)/polymer are indicative of the HKUSTI-1(Cu) crystals presence.</p>
        <p>However, it can be observed that the MOF peaks intensities decrease by its incorporation into the polymer matrix which could be attributed to TMPTA filling the pores, to the low MOF mass percentage used equal to 20 mg dispersed into 1 g of monomer or to the arbitrary dispersal of MOFs crystals inside the polymer 55 .</p>
        <p>Heterogenous photocatalysis is a phenomenon that occurs on the photocatalyst surface, therefore, in order to understand the composites catalysis behavior, it was important to evaluate their BET surfaces area, the adsorption average pore width and the total area in pores. Results are reported in Table 5. For the neat polymer, the pore size distribution according to the Density Functional Theory (DFT) showing the presence of a large porosity with a maximum value of about 4.8 nm was reported in our previous works 57 . According to Table 5, the incorporation of MOFs into the polymer induced a significant decrease in its BET surface (9.3 m 2 .g -1 ), pore width (4.3 nm) and total area in pores (6.3 m 2 .g -1 ). In fact, polymer BET surface area is diminished to 5.6, 4 and 1.7 m 2 .g -1 and to 1, 2.6 and 1.9 m 2 .g -1 by adding 0.5%, 1% and 2% of MOF MIL-53(Cr) and HKUSTI-1(Cu), respectively. Similarly, incorporating MOFs into the polymer have significantly decreased the total area in pores to values ranging between 1.9 and 0.4 m 2 .g -1 . Such a decrease in BET surface area and total pores volume could be explained by the fact that incorporated MOFs are confined with the polymer channels as shown in Figure 5 (b, c, f, g), which blocks the polymer mesopores.</p>
        <p>Remarkably, HUKSTI-1(Cu) and MIL-53(Cr) lose their porosity when immobilized into the polymer matrix. Indeed, their BET surface area was reduced from 1944 and 1350 m 2 .g -1 to 1.7 and 1.9 m 2 .g -1 in the case of 2% MIL-53(Cr)/polymer and 2% HKUSTI-1(Cu)/polymer composites synthesis. Such results could be explained by polymer blocking the access to the MOFs pores or by the penetration of TMPTA resin chains inside the MOFs cavities 50,58 . This phenomenon was previously observed by Wickenheisser et al who developed MIL-101(Cr)@NIPAM (poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide)HIPE) 59 and by Schwab et al during the synthesis of a polyHIPE enclosing HKUSTI MOFs 60 .</p>
        <p>In order to obtain further details of the surface structure such as roughness, topology of HKUSTI-1(Cu)/polymer composite, MIL-53(Cr)/polymer composite and the TMPTA polymer were characterized by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) with the Peak-Force QNM imaging.</p>
        <p>Figure 9 shows the obtained topological images. In order to ameliorate the practical applications of our photocatalysts for the wastewater treatment, MOFs-based polymers should be characterized by good mechanical properties allowing their facile reuse and collect. Therefore, influence on the mechanical properties of the incorporation of MOFs into TMPTA-based polymers was studied.</p>
        <p>Mechanical properties of the synthesized composites were investigated by AFM (Peak-Force QNM imaging mode). The elastic resistance to AFM indentation reflects the rigidity of the polymer or the composite network. Compared to the polymer elastic modulus ranging from [0 -2.7 GPa] with a mean value of 1.4 GPa, the MIL-53(Cr)/polymer and HKUSTI-1(Cu)/Polymer composites showed a higher elastic modulus ranging from [0 -21.3GPa] and [0-6.8GPa] with a mean value of 2.5</p>
        <p>GPa and 1 GPa, respectively. This enhancement and deterioration of polymers rigidity is attributed to the MIL-53(Cr) and HKUSTI-1(Cu) crystals presence into the polymer.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Figure 11 shows the elastic modulus distribution of the polymer, the 1% HKUSTI-1(Cu)/polymer composite, the 1%MIL-53(Cr)/polymer composite as well as their gaussian fit. The curves presented in Figure 11 show an inhomogeneity in the normal Gaussian distribution for the elastic modulus in each sample and illustrate clearly that the presence of the MOFs into the polymer affects it rigidity.</p>
        <p>In order to obtain further mechanical informations, the bulk mechanical properties of the composites were evaluated by Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) experiments. The obtained values of dynamic storage modulus G' and dynamic loss modulus G'' at 25°C are presented in Table 6. Interestingly, the dynamic storage modulus G' is greater than the dynamic loss modulus G'' in the case of the polymer and the synthesized MOF/polymer composites, suggesting a rigid character of these materials which is in agreement with the low swelling degree and the high crosslinking density of the polymer network (Table 1). In bulk, G' was increased from 100 to 131 MPa and 162 by MIL-53(Cr) and HKUSTI-1(Cu) crystals incorporation into the polymer matrix, respectively. Therefore, neat TMPTA polymer bulk properties were ameliorated by its association with these two MOFs presence. Remarkably, HKUSTI-1(Cu) encapsulation into the polymer didn't affect its mechanical surface and bulk properties in the same way. Presence of this MOF ameliorated the bulk rigidity of the neat polymer but deteriorated a little bit the surface mechanical properties of the initial matrix.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the composite G'' decreases to 12 MPa in the case of MIL-53(Cr)/polymer and HKUSTI-1(Cu)/polymer composites compared to 20 MPa for the polymer, indicates a more elastic behavior compared to the initial TMPTA resin. This could be explained by a decrease in the polymer chains mobility and then in the stress transfer in the matrix, by the addition of MOFs crystallites.</p>
        <p>In order to select the most suitable irradiation source for photocatalytic degradation tests, optical properties of the MOFs/polymer composites, have also been investigated.</p>
        <p>Since the first interest for developing these MOF/polymer composites was their applications for the photocatalytic removal of different pollutants from water, it was important to estimate their band gap energies. Therefore, their optical properties were examined through UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra and the results are shown in Figure 12 and in Table 7.</p>
        <p>Figure 12 : UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectra of (A) (1) 1% TiO2/polymer composite, ( The gap energies of the different synthesized materials are reported in Table 7. The MIL-53(Cr)/polymer composites showed a band gap energies between 2.1 and 2.4 eV, which are weaker than that of the TiO2/polymer composite (3.1 eV). Therefore, depending on source irradiation emitting wavelengths, the developed composites absorbing at longer wavelengths than the TiO2/polymer composites are expected to be more efficient under visible irradiation, since photocatalytic performance is related to the photocatalysts band structure. Moreover, in the case of MIL-53(Cr)/polymer composites, increasing MOFs mass percentages, causes a slight decrease of their energy bandgaps and therefore probably to an improvement in their photocatalytic performance. Effectiveness of these different synthesized materials for Acid Black photodegradation will be compared later (section 3.4).</p>
        <p>Photocatalytic activities of the synthesized MOF/polymer composites were evaluated during the degradation of Acid Black in aqueous solutions under UV Lamp irradiation.

        <p>Acid Black is characterized by two absorption bands: an absorption located between 400 and 700 nm with an absorption maxima at 618 nm, corresponding to the n /  * transition of the azo (N = N), which is at the origin of the azo dyes color and used to monitor the dye discoloration. As well as an absorbance between 200 and 400 nm corresponding to the n /  * of benzene and naphthalene transitions (figure 13 (A,B)). Decrease of this absorbance during the photocatalytic treatment stipulates the degradation of the dye aromatic part 61,62 .</p>
        <p>Figures 13 (A,B) show that in the presence of both MIL-53 (Cr) / polymer and HKUSTI-1(Cu)/polymer composites, and by prolongating the irradiation time, the absorption peaks located at 618 nm and 310 nm decreased gradually indicating the breaking of the azo N=N bond and the naphthalene groups, which results in the formation of aromatic amines: aniline and p-nitro aniline 63 causing the appearance of a peak around 350 nm, which disappears with an increase of the irradiation time.</p>
        <p>The formation of intermediates was confirmed by the appearance during photolysis of a light pink color which could correspond to Chromotrope 2B and Chromotrope 2R. This two primary degradation by-products of Acid Black absorbing at 512nm and 514nm, respectively are reported in the literature 64 . The pink color disappearance was followed by a yellowish color formation corresponding to aniline. At the end of the photocatalytic treatment, the solution color becomes transparent, thus proving the total Acid Black discoloration 63 .</p>
        <p>Such spectral and pollutant color changes, were reported previously by A. Troupis and coworkers who have applied various polyoxometalates such as PW12O40 3-, SiW12O40 and P2W18O62 for the photocatalytic reductive degradation of Acid Black in the presence of propan-2-ol as sacrificial agent 63 . Keiichi TANAKA and coworkers have also outlined the same absorption spectrum transformations when degrading Acid Black by oxidation and reduction processes simultaneously, using a TiO2 suspension 65 . However, in the presence of 2% MIL-53(Cr)/polymer and 2% HKUSTI-1(Cu)/polymer composites, the photodegradation of this pollutant becomes faster and reaches respectively 96% and 90% (curves 3) after only 30 minutes of irradiation. Interstingly, the increase of crystalline MIL-53(Cr) percentages into the polymer from 0.5% to 1% and 2% induces an improvement of the composite photocatalytic performance. Hence, the removal rate was increased from 63% to 96% after 30 min of irradiation (See Figure 13C (curves 1, 2, 3)).</p>
        <p>Similarly, composites containing 0.5% to 1% and 2% of crystalline HKUSTI-(Cu) degrade 53%, 58% and 90%, respectively under the same irradiation time (See Figure 13D (curves 1, 2, 3)).</p>
        <p>Furthermore, only 35% of Acid Black was removed in the presence of 1% TiO2/Polymer.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the developed MOF/polymer composites are more performant (96% after 60 min of irradiation), than the Titanium dioxide (37% after 60 min of irradiation).</p>
        <p>Photocatalytic degradation mechanism of Acid Black in the presence of the newly developed photocatalysts upon UV lamp irradiation was investigated by radical scavenging experiments and by photolysis upon different atmospheres (under air and N2). Herein, EDTA 18,66 , isopropanol 67 , MEHQ 68 and TEMPO 69 were applied as scavengers of h + , Hydroxyl radicals ( . OH), oxygen active species (RO . and ROO . ) and carbon centred radicals, respectively. In all cases, the scavenger's concentration was fixed to 1mM and their effects on Acid Black degradation were determined through the variation of the dye concentration reported in Figure 15.</p>
        <p>(5) prove that the holes formed in the composites valence bands play a major role in the photocatalytic mechanism by degrading directly the pollutant adsorbed on its surface. The oxygenated active species are also involved in the Acid Black degradation route.</p>
        <p>Similarly to EDTA and MEHQ, the TEMPOL presence in the dye solution, have decelerated the kinetics of the photocatalytics process. Indeed, in the presence of this radical scavenger, the pollutant conversion reached only 63% and 67% in the presence of repectively MIL-53(Cr)/polymer and HKUSTI/polymer composites compared to 96% attained in the absence of these chemicals (Figure 15 (A and B ( curves 6 and 2)). Thus, it indicates that the generated carbon radicals play also a crucial role in enhancing the photolysis of the dye.</p>
        <p>Also, in the presence of HKUSTI-1(Cu)/polymer composite and under the same conditions, the Acid Black percentage removal was decreased from 95% to 48%, by adding isopropyl alcohol. In conclusion, based on the photolysis experiments under air and N2 and in the presence of the different scavengers, we can assume that the Acid Black is degraded by a direct mechanism on the holes and electrons formed in the photocomposites surfaces, and by an indirect pathway via the generated oxygenated and carobanted active species.</p>
        <p>For practical applications, stability of the photocatalyst is very important. Thus, photocatalytic experiments were repeated (10 times) with the same composite, recovered from the dye solution after a depollution cycle, washed with acetonitrile and water several times, dried and then used again for the next catalytic cycle. Obtained results are shown in Figure 16. Additionnaly, comparisons of the MOF/polymer composites SEM-EDX images before and after the photocatalytic process (Figures 4 and5) of photodegradation of Acid Black (Figure 18), showed a slight loss of MOF aggregates at the surface of the polymer film after one photocatalytic treatment cycle, especially for the 2% HKUSTI-1(Cu)/polymer composite (Figure 18 (e,f)) in which the chromium almost totally disappear from this catalyst surface after 10 successive catalytic cycles (Figure 18 (i,j)) , explaining then the decrease of Acid Black removal after 8 treatment cycles.</p>
        <p>Interstingly, the sectional SEM-EDX images of both MOF/polymer composites present almost structures. The developed materials exhibit also a relatively low BET surface, a high rigidity as well as a high thermal stability demonstrated by DMA, AFM and ATG analysis, respectively.</p>
        <p>The synthesized MOF/Polymer composites were very performant for the Acid Black removal from water, reaching 96% after 30 min and 45 min of UV lamp irradiation, in the presence of 2% MIL-53(Cr)/polymer and 2% HKUSTI-1(Cu)/polymer, respectively. Moreover, these photocatalysts were used 10 times successively with a slightly decrease in their efficiency from the 8th treatment cycle, and were also characterized by XRD and SEM methods after their reuse for Acid Black photodegradation.</p>
        <p>In brief, this achievement has improved the mechanical properties and the stability of Metal Organic Frameworks, facilitate their technological application by obtaining materials easy to manipulate and to regenerate. This method will be used to develop several other MOF/Polymer composites in order to enhance their performance in environmentally fields.</p>
