        <p>Worldwide, the majority of small islands not connected to the main grid is still dependent on fossil fuels. From an economic and environmental point of view, this condition is no more sustainable given the high costs for electricity generation and the high level of pollutant emissions. Furthermore, the dependence on fossil fuel represents a risk for the security of the supply of several small developing Countries since they are obliged to import those resources from foreign Countries. The introduction of renewable energy sources in small islands represents a valid solution to solve these problems. In this context, the paper investigates the case of Lampedusa, a small Italian island whose electrical power system is currently totally supplied by diesel power plants. In the paper, the authors investigate the transition toward an economically and technically feasible generating system based on solar, wind and sea wave plants, to achieve specific targets of decarbonization. Commercial technologies are adopted for the exploitation of solar and wind sources, while sea wave plants are based on an innovative device, currently under development at the University of Palermo. A mathematical model is proposed to find the optimal energy mix that can satisfy a fixed share of annual electricity production from renewables, considering the Levelized Cost of Electricity. Finally, the proposed solution is analyzed in order to check the dynamic stability of the power system. The paper shows that, for replacing the 40% of the current electricity demand of Lampedusa, an optimal energy mix comprising 1509 kW from photovoltaic plants, 2100 kW from wind turbines and 640 kW from wave energy converters is needed. In this way, the actualized cost for the electricity production could be reduced to 0.260 €/kWh from the current value of 0.282 €/kWh.Worldwide, the majority of small islands not connected to the main grid is still dependent on fossil fuels.

        <p>Thanks to RES, the reduction of pollutants and greenhouse gases emission is obtained for both a lower use of fossil fuels and a better management of local natural resources (Fuldauer et al., 2019;Joseph and Prasad, 2020). A recent report from IRENA shows that, in less than 20 years, the RES installed power worldwide is practically tripled, from 753.95 GW in 2000to 2350.76 GW in 2018. RES are concentrated mainly in Asia (1023.5 GW, 43.54%), Europe (536.4 GW,22.82%) and North America (366.5 GW, 15.59%) (IRENA, 2018). However, huge investments are required for the energy transition from fossil fuel to RES (Kutan et al., 2018).Thanks to RES, the reduction of pollutants and greenhouse gases emission is obtained for both a lower use of fossil fuels and a better management of local natural resources (Fuldauer et al., 2019;Joseph and Prasad, 2020).

        <p>Despite the spreading of RES around the world, several remote areas and the major part of small islands are still equipped with power plants almost entirely based on fossil fuels both in Europe, as shown in (Cannistraro et al., 2017) and in other regions, as shown in (Liu et al., 2018) where the case of Maldives is discussed. Considering also the Small Islands Developing States (SIDS), the electricity demand to supply all these communities is estimated equal to 52690 GWh/y, and is mainly based on fossil fuels (Blechinger et al., 2014).Despite the spreading of RES around the world, several remote areas and the major part of small islands are still equipped with power plants almost entirely based on fossil fuels both in Europe, as shown in (Cannistraro et al., 2017) and in other regions, as shown in (Liu et al., 2018) where the case of Maldives is discussed.

        <p>Focusing on Europe, there are 362 islands, having at least 50 permanent residents, and other 286 with fewer inhabitants (Zafeiratou and Spataru, 2018). To increase the energy independence from fossil fuels, several projects have been promoted, proposing specific energy mixes according to local availabilities, such as Samsø (Denmark) (Marczinkowski and Østergaard, 2019), Faroe Islands (Katsaprakakis et al., 2019), Cozumel Island (Mexico) (Mendoza-Vizcaino et al., 2016), Canary Islands (Spain) (Gils and Simon, 2017;Rusu, 2014), Azores (Portugal) (Alves et al., 2019;Stenzel et al., 2017), Maldives (Liu et al., 2018) and Reunion Island (France) (Selosse et al., 2018). The literature on RES penetration in small island is mainly focused on commercial technologies such as wind plants and photovoltaic (PV) systems. As an example, Notton reported statistics on the electricity generation in several French islands (located in different parts of the world), considering the installation of power plants supplied by wind and solar sources (Notton, 2015). Kougias et al. investigated a potential energy mix based on solar, wind, fossil fuel and a battery storage system to supply several small Greek islands (Rhodes, Lesvos, Chios, Karpathos and Patmos) in the Aegean Sea, close to Turkey (Kougias et al., 2019). Geothermal, hydropower and biomass are sometimes considered to improve the sustainability of the energy sector (Bueno and Carta, 2006). Sea wave energy potential has been also investigated in the last decade, thanks to several peculiarities, such as the great regularity and huge availability, especially in the case of small islands where the energy demand is limited. As an example, in (Bozzi et al., 2014), the energy production and the performance characteristics of three wave energy converters are estimated for two of the Italian locations. In (Monteforte et al., 2015) the authors carry out an estimation of wave energy potential in Sicily (Italy). In (Lavidas and Venugopal, 2017) an high-resolution wave atlas for nearshore energy production at the Aegean Sea is provided, while in (Sierra et al., 2014) the wave resource around Menorca island (Spain) is assessed. Several solutions have been proposed but still no consolidated technologies are commercially available. In (Majidi Nezhad et al., 2018) four wave converters (Wave Star, Oyster, Wave Dragon and Archimedes Wave Swing) are compared, assuming the Sicilian coast as case study while in (Rusu and Guedes Soares, 2013) two Pelamis farm configurations are considered in the Portuguese coast. To improve the energy sustainability of about 20 Italian small islands, the Italian Government has recently issued two decrees promoting the introduction of RES and the realization of projects able to affect the energy efficiency of the final uses. In detail, the Italian Ministry of Economic Development issued Decree 14 February 2017 fixing the amount of RES devices to install in 20 small islands by December 31, 2020(Ministero dello Sviluppo Economico, 2017). The energy goals are modulated according to annual electricity production. As an example, in the case study reported in this paper, the Decree proposes for Lampedusa the installation of 2.14 MW from RES and 2370 m 2 of solar thermal panels. In addition, the Article 6 suggests the installation of "Integrated innovative projects", including also the exploitation of oceanic energies. Decree n. 340 of 14 July 2017, issued by the Italian Ministry of Environment, Land and Sea, establishes a fund of 15 M€ for the realization of projects devoted at lowering the primary energy consumption of final users in small islands (Italian Ministry of the Environment and for Protection of the Land and Sea, 2017). In order to achieve the goal fixed by the Italian Government for small islands, in this paper the authors propose a method for finding the optimal renewable energy mix, composed of solar, wind and sea wave energy. Commercial technologies are considered to exploit solar and wind sources while, in the case of sea wave, an innovative technology is presented. The method is applied to the case of the island of Lampedusa (Italy), located in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea. Various methods are present in the literature for performing similar analyses. As an example, in (Zhang and Zheng, 2019) the authors consider five indicators for assessing renewable energy integration in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region. The authors consider the importance of the presence of flexible resources for the integration of renewables and evaluate both technical and economic indicators. In (de Santoli et al., 2019) a GIS-based approach is presented, based on the elaboration of queried maps and tables with percentages of electricity consumptions covered by local RES, identifying the most critical and suitable areas for the installation of new RES plants in Lazio. In (Alves et al., 2019) the RES potential of Pico and Faial islands is characterized by modeling some scenarios with EnergyPLAN. In this paper, we propose an approach for a deeper analysis of RES feasibility in small islands considering not only the energy and environmental issues but also the problem of grid stability due to the reduction of system's primary reserve and inertia. The main novelty of the paper is a two phases-approach presenting at first, a preliminary choice of the optimal energy mix to install, based on the calculation of the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) and, subsequently, a dynamic stability analysis in the presence of the identified energy mix in various operating conditions for assessing the technical feasibility of the installation of RES plants from the point of view of grid security. The model proposed for the identification of the optimal energy mix requires a limited amount of climatic data that are available in the literature or obtainable from specific GIS tools. This makes the method easy-to-apply and, being based on the calculation of the LCOE, is relevant for industries that tend to invest in RES in small islands. Moreover, the best energy mix found by the proposed method is furthermore investigated, analyzing the frequency stability problem of the local grid. This is another important characteristic of the approach presented in this paper given that this kind of analysis is fundamental for all power systems not connected to the main grid, characterized by low inertia and high variability of RES. Indeed, power electronics-based RES generators, if not suitably controlled, contribute to the reduction of the power systems regulation reserve and inertia and, consequently, to the increase of the Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) creating possible instabilities (Favuzza et al., 2018a(Favuzza et al., , 2018b)). Thus, in this paper, a methodology is reported to analyze how the increase of power generation from RES can affect the stability of a small island not supplied by the main grid. In detail, the power systems inertia is evaluated by considering typical summer and winter week profiles of the energy demand delivered by the local company in the absence and in the presence of RES. Two case studies, suggested by the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) analysis, are analyzed and the lowest inertia state is individuated. Finally, 24 failure conditions are simulated in NEPLAN environment, analyzing the dynamic transient stability to verify the robustness of the local grid in the presence of RES.Focusing on Europe, there are 362 islands, having at least 50 permanent residents, and other 286 with fewer inhabitants (Zafeiratou and Spataru, 2018).

        <p>It is interesting to observe that in Eq. ( 8) there are only three variables: B, C &amp;' and C # . Indeed, the annual equivalent working hours can be evaluated only one time, according to Eq. ( 7), thus these parameters are considered constant in the optimization phase. The other inputs of the problem are the specific costs to install ( "#, , #, , &amp;', ) and maintenance of all RES technologies ( "#, , #, , &amp;', ), the annual energy demand , the discount rate for money and the inflation rate for the energy sector .It is interesting to observe that in Eq.

        <p>Fixing the desired share of renewable electricity production, there are only two degrees of freedom to the problem (C &amp;' , C # ), thus the economic optimization is realized in order to find the best energy mix. The two degrees of freedom are varied in a discretized way, and the evaluation of LCOE is performed for each condition. It is important to underline that this parameter is based on the estimation of annual electricity production. Since each RES has a different trend during the year, some energy mixes could involve an hourly production trend incompatible with the network's balance. This problem is basically more relevant during winter when the electricity production from wind and sea wave are maximal and the energy demand minimal.Fixing the desired share of renewable electricity production, there are only two degrees of freedom to the problem (C &amp;' , C # ), thus the economic optimization is realized in order to find the best energy mix.

        <p>To avoid the hourly verification of all possible mixes and reduce the computational burden, a maximal share M of monthly electricity production from RES has been introduced. Consequently, the check of RES production is applied to the monthly scale, according to Eq. ( 9): As shown in the flow chart reported in Figure 3, the parameter M is evaluated with an iterative approach. It assumes firstly the value of 90% in order to evaluate preliminarily the matrix of constrains. Overlapping the matrix of constraints to the not constrained LCOE matrix, it is possible to identify the best condition, i.e. the RES mix corresponding to the lowest LCOE. This condition is consequently verified, considering the hourly trends of energy demand and production from RES. If the proposed energy mix exceeds the energy demand in some hours of the day, the parameter M is reduced and consequently the matrix of constrains is calculated again and overlapped on the not constrained LCOE matrix to find the new best energy mix. After a few iterations, the best energy is finally obtained, verifying the hourly compatibility with the local energy demand.To avoid the hourly verification of all possible mixes and reduce the computational burden, a maximal share M of monthly electricity production from RES has been introduced.

        <p>About the existing power plant, the mathematical model splits the annual costs in two items: a term related to the fuel consumption to produce energy and the latter to fixed expenditure (maintenance, worker salaries, etc.). Assuming that the trend reported in Figure 4 was the same also in 2015, the evaluation of the average price for fuel consumption has been evaluated as weighted average of the monthly average price of oil with a low concentration of sulfur (less than 1%) published by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (Italian Ministry of Economic Development, 2019). The total income of the local producer is given by product of the annual electricity production and the total selling price of energy. Thus, the fixed costs are evaluated as the difference of the total income and the estimated expenditure for the fuel consumption. About the cost for electricity production using traditional generators, it assumed equal to the sum of NUP About RES, the unitary cost for the purchase and installation and for the operative and maintenance operations of each RES technology can be obtained from literature (IRENA, 2018).

        <p>Besides the number of synchronous generators in operation for each hour, the sum of the rated apparent powers of the synchronous generators influences the value of the inertia. The trends in Figure 11 show that the values of the inertia are included in the range 0-2.75 s. This means that in some situations, characterized by a high share of renewables, all synchronous generators are disconnected from the grid and the inertia goes to zero. This happens, in particular, when renewables are 100% in service for every hour. Table 8 reports 24 different power system states corresponding to the minimum and maximum inertia of the system, evaluated according to Eq. ( 12). Each state is identified by a code, whose structure is the following # d9T = e e . e f . e g where: h i indicated the scenario (A or B) h j indicates the event (0, 1, 2) h k indicates the value of the inertia constant of the system (1 for minimum inertia; 2 for maximum inertia) h l indicates the season (1 for summer and 2 for winter). For the 24 cases in Table 8, a dynamic stability analysis is performed by Neplan. The disturbance occurs at . = 1W and the observation window is set equal to 10 seconds.

        <p>Since PV plants and modern wind turbine generators are connected through power converters, they do not offer a natural inertial response. This condition can lead to instability issues, thus particular measures for avoiding power blackout must be implemented. For example, power storage units can be installed both for increasing the RES share and, thanks to specific advanced controls (synthetic inertia, fast frequency regulation and so on) for injecting/absorbing power in the grid and compensating generation of load imbalances. This condition will be examined in future studies.Since PV plants and modern wind turbine generators are connected through power converters, they do not offer a natural inertial response.
