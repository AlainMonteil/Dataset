        <p>Energy hub systems integrate various energy sources and interconnect different energy carriers in order to enhance the flexibility of the system. In this paper, a cooperative framework is proposed in which a network of energy hubs collaborate together and share their resources in order to reduce their costs. Each hub has several sources including CHP, boiler, renewable sources, electrical chiller, and absorption chiller. Moreover, energy storages are considered for electrical, heating, and cooling systems in order to increase the flexibility of energy hubs. Unlike the methods based on Nash-equilibrium points, which find the equilibrium point and have no guarantee for optimality of the solution, the employed cooperative method finds the optimal solution for the problem. We utilize the Shapley value to allocate the overall gain of the hub's coalition based on the contribution and efficiency of the energy hubs. The proposed method is modeled as a mixed integer linear programming problem, and the cost of network energy hubs are decreased in the cooperative operation, which shows the efficiency of this model. The results show 18.89, 10.23, and 8.72% improvement for hub1, hub2, and hub3, respectively, by using the fair revenue mechanism.Energy hub systems integrate various energy sources and interconnect different energy carriers in order to enhance the flexibility of the system.

        <p>Today, energy consumption is increasing rapidly around the world, which encourages researchers to find novel ways to solve this issue. There are various energy sources to supply energy for the consumption sector such as electricity, gas, and renewable energy sources (RES). In recent years, electricity and gas are employed simultaneously in scheduling and operating energy systems which are investigated as multi-carrier energy systems. Using gas and electricity for energy optimization enhances the reliability and efficiency of the system, since they can increase the flexibility of the system in both the normal and critical conditions.Today, energy consumption is increasing rapidly around the world, which encourages researchers to find novel ways to solve this issue.

        <p>One of the frameworks that are used to integrated energy management in multi-carrier energy systems is the energy hub. Energy hub consists of different energy sources and demands such as electrical, heating, and cooling, which are interconnected by several units. Energy hubs have various units, namely power generation, RES, and storage units, which cooperate to serve the demands and achieve the optimal operation scheduling [1]. Nowadays, energy hubs are investigated vastly and are modeled for distinct systems such as residential, commercial, and industrial sector.One of the frameworks that are used to integrated energy management in multi-carrier energy systems is the energy hub.

        <p>By interconnecting energy hubs, the concept of networked energy hubs (NEH) is formed, from which the system gains many benefits. In this context, NEH includes several energy hubs that increase the flexibility of the system significantly by having access to different units and sources [2]. Moreover, NEH can use the strength of each hub to overcome the weakness of other hubs, resulting in more appropriate energy management in the system. Also, NEH employs local energy sources more effectively, enhancing the reliability of the system and reducing the required power from the main grid. Therefore, NEH not only provides the whole system considerable benefits but also improves the performance of each energy hub individually.By interconnecting energy hubs, the concept of networked energy hubs (NEH) is formed, from which the system gains many benefits.

        <p>In order to increase flexibility, energy storage systems play a crucial role in the system. These facilities store the energy so that the overall performance of the system enhances. For instance, the electrical storage saves energy at low price intervals and discharge it in peak hours [3]. A stochastic day-ahead bidding strategy for energy hub is proposed in [4], considering the presence of various energy storages including battery energy storage, heating storage, and ice storage while neglecting the cooperation of various hubs and demand response programs. A networked energy hub system is proposed in [5], which aims to maximize the profit of the system by using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method. However, the demand response programs and cooling system modeling are not considered. In [6], a cooperative framework is proposed in the multi-energy systems that integrate the renewable energy resources and energy storage systems in the energy hubs.In order to increase flexibility, energy storage systems play a crucial role in the system.

        <p>The authors in [8] presented a stochastic model for a multi-carrier energy hub in which the demand response program, electricity market, and thermal energy market are taken into account. In contrast, the network of energy hubs and cooling system are not considered. In [9], optimal day-ahead scheduling of an active distribution system including multiple energy hubs is investigated wherein the transacted energy between the participants is calculated using their bids and offers. However, the fair cost allocation for participants and maintenance cost are ignored. Economic optimization of a multi-carrier system using the coupling matrix and virtual nodes insertion is proposed in [10]. Although this study considers several energy sources for energy carriers and the effect of demand response programs is taken into account, the cooling system and the cooperation of different energy hubs in a fair condition are not studied. In [11], multi-carrier networked microgrids are investigated which can exchange energy with each other, but the fair cost allocation and demand response programs are not discussed.The authors in [8] presented a stochastic model for a multi-carrier energy hub in which the demand response program, electricity market, and thermal energy market are taken into account.

        <p>From the cooperation perspective, networked systems are separated into cooperative and non-cooperative systems. In the cooperative methods, the objective is to find the Pareto optimal solution of the problem, but finding the equilibrium point is the objective in the non-cooperative models. The authors in [12] proposed a cooperative model including power to gas (P2G) devices for integrated power and gas networks and considered the demand smoothness and cost reduction in the network. Nevertheless, the effect of cooling system, demand response program, and fair allocation of costs are not investigated. A multi-objective model is proposed in [13] to optimize cost savings and carbon emissions in NEH using εconstraint technique and max-min fuzzy decision making. This paper considers the cooperation of energy hubs while neglecting the fair cost allocation and cooling system. In [14], a congestion game is modeled, guaranteeing the existence of the Nash equilibrium.From the cooperation perspective, networked systems are separated into cooperative and non-cooperative systems.

        <p>In the non-cooperative games, the Nash equilibrium points (NEPs) are the solution to the problem. The NEPs provide stable solutions, while there is no guarantee of optimality. In other words, in the NEPs, no player has anything to gain by changing only his own strategy.In the non-cooperative games, the Nash equilibrium points (NEPs) are the solution to the problem.

        <p>If the optimization problem has a better unstable solution, it cannot be chosen by the noncooperative games.

        <p>Unlike non-cooperative games, the total cost/profit of the system had been optimized in the cooperative games. The cooperative games focus on the predicting that forming coalitions will form, the joint actions that players take and the resulting collective payoffs. When energy hubs cooperate, they can share their electrical, thermal, and cooling resources. Compared to the non-cooperative games, cooperation enhances the flexibility of the system because the energy hubs can use the surplus capacity of the other resources. Therefore, the cooperative games ensure the optimal solution for the system. Also, the emission of greenhouse gasses and power losses in the cooperative model is less than the non-cooperative model. According to the above, we propose a cooperative framework for the energy scheduling of multiple energy hubs, which considers fair energy sharing between energy hubs by using Shapley value. Furthermore, energy hubs contain electrical, heating, and cooling load, and they can employ both the electrical and heating demand response programs. In this regard, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is used in order to achieve the global optimum solution for the problem. Various energy sources and generation units such as PV, WT, CHP, heat only boiler, electrical chiller, and absorption chiller are also employed. In the proposed model, the energy hubs form a coalition and share their resources to optimize the cost of the system. The overall gain of the coalition should be divided among the hubs trough a fair mechanism. We utilize the Shapley value and consider the contribution of each energy hub for cost minimization to allocate the benefit of coalition among each hub. A summary of the recently published paper on the energy hubs is provided in Table 1.  Cooperative approach  The energy scheduling of the multi-energy hubs had been studied  The role of electrical and thermal DR programs was deliberated  The fair cost allocation was not investigated  The cooling system was not considered  The impact of ice storage was not studied [15]  Cooperative approach  The role of electrical and heat storage systems was studied  The absorption chiller was considered in the hub structure  The optimal planning of the multi-energy hubs had been studiedUnlike non-cooperative games, the total cost/profit of the system had been optimized in the cooperative games.

        <p>In Fig. 6-8, the amount of each electric production and demand including power resources, energy storages, DR programs, and electricity consumers such as ice storage and electrical chiller is demonstrated. As illustrated, hub1 faces a serious electrical energy shortage, since it has restrictions to import energy from the main grid. Thus, hub1 employs its own resources as much as possible to provide the required power for the demands, and it uses CHP unit to produce most of the required power in most of the operation time. Furthermore, this hub uses DR programs to shift and curtail the loads, resulting in enhancing its ability to serve the demands. Hub1 also possesses electrical chiller and ice storage, which consume a large part of the accessible electricity. As shown in Fig. 7, hub2 can import more power from the main grid, and it has not cooling loads to serve. With this in mind, it imports power in the low price hours and sells the extra power in the high price moments, which reduces its dependency on the CHP unit, and use CHP unit mostly to make profit during the high price hours and sell the power to the grid.In Fig. 6-8, the amount of each electric production and demand including power resources, energy storages, DR programs, and electricity consumers such as ice storage and electrical chiller is demonstrated.

        <p>Hub3 contains various production units and demands, which has increased its flexibility in serving the demands. As depicted in Fig. 8, hub3 has shifted the loads from peak hours to low load periods, which results in a reduction in its operation cost. Also, it has injected power to the main grid during hours 11-18, since it has a large amount of renewable energy, enabling hub 3 to produce a large amount of energy. ii) The heating results of energy hubs in case I Figs. 9-11, shows an overview of the heat energy in hubs, in which the production and demands of each are described. Since hub1 should utilize its CHP to provide the required electrical power, its CHP is employed all over the operation period, and the boiler unit is not used in case I. Moreover, using the heat storage and DR programs, hub1 provides the required heat for the demands and shifts the heat load in order to decrease the operation costs. Furthermore, because of the limited flexibility in this case, hub1 is unable to use its absorption chiller and boiler. According to Fig. 10, regarding the smaller quantity of the required electric power in hub2, less heat is produced by CHP, and boiler as well as DR program have provided the required heat for the hub. As mentioned earlier, hub2 uses its CHP to produce electrical power in the high price hours and sell the power to the main grid. Therefore, the only heat provider in the high price hours is the CHP unit. Also, the CHP unit supplies the required heat for charging the heat storage and the shifted heat loads from other intervals. The main heat source of hub3 is the boiler, since it has less amount of electrical load and it can import more power from the main grid; thus it needs less electricity from the CHP units and most of the required heat is generated using boiler (see Fig. 11). Boiler and CHP provide heat together between hours 8-20, because the absorption chiller is employed during this period. During hours 9-21, CHP unit provides heat for hub3, since the generated power in these hours will reduce the imported power in the high price hours. iiiHub3 contains various production units and demands, which has increased its flexibility in serving the demands.

        <p>According to Fig. 14, hub1 imports more amount of energy from the main grid in the cooperated operation in comparison with case I, since it has more loads to serve. Moreover, hub1 has decreased the output of CHP to increase the flexibility of the electrical and heat section. Furthermore, load curtailment is not required for hub1 in case II, because it can import sufficient power from the main grid. Unlike case I, the demand response program has been used more frequently in case II, because of the ability to import more power from the main grid. As we can observe from Fig. 15, hub2 is also able to import more power from the main grid in case II, resulting in decreasing the use of CHP during the operation period. However, during the high price hours, the CHP is still employed, because the obtained revenue from selling power to the grid overcomes the CHP shut down. Hub3 has decreased the imported power from the main grid in the first hours of the operation and has used CHP units to produce the rest of required power, since energy hubs have shared the capacity of imported power from the main grid, and more capacity for importing power from the main grid is dedicated to hub1 in case II (Fig. 16). iiAccording to Fig. 14, hub1 imports more amount of energy from the main grid in the cooperated operation in comparison with case I, since it has more loads to serve.

        <p>17-19. The generated heat from the CHP in hub1 is decreased in case II, since hub1 needs less electricity from the CHP. Accordingly, less heat is generated from CHP, resulting in the growth in heat production from the boiler in case II. Moreover, using less amount of heat from the CHP has enabled hub1 to use more DR programs and shift the loads more appropriately. During the high price hours, CHP produces power and heat, and the boiler is not used in this interval.17-19.

        <p>Likewise, hub2 is also able to produce more heat from the boiler, because it has diminished the output of CHP during the first period of the operation. Nevertheless, the CHP heat output is the same as case I in the high price hours, as hub3 prefers to sell the generated power from the CHP to the grid. Hub3 has reduced the output of the boiler and increased the output of CHP, since it has to decline the imported power from the main grid by using its own CHP more frequently. The absorption chiller generates as same cooling energy as case I, but the heat DR program has changed in order to match with the power transmission restrictions.Likewise, hub2 is also able to produce more heat from the boiler, because it has diminished the output of CHP during the first period of the operation.
