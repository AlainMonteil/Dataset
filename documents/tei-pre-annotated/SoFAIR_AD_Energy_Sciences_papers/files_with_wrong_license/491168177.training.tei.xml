        <p>With the aim to reduce emissions from marine transport, electric propulsion systems for a water taxi and container ship powered by a hydrogen polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell system are designed and analysed compared to the current fuel-oil engine systems in terms of system energy and exergy efficiency, fuel consumption, mass and volume, environmental impacts and cost. Hydrogen is stored either as a compressed gas (GH2), cryogenic liquid (LH2) or produced from liquid ammonia (LNH3) and can deliver 91%,91% and 88% greenhouse gas reductions, respectively. All hydrogen sources fit within ship volume and mass constraints apart from GH2 in the cargo ship. In the absence of carbon policy measures, the costs over a 25-year system life are 108%(GH2), 112%(LH2), 116%(LNH3) greater for the container ship and 43%(GH2), 105%(LNH3) greater for the water taxi. A carbon tax of £75-191/tonne CO2-eq would equalise total cost over a 25-year lifespan.With the aim to reduce emissions from marine transport, electric propulsion systems for a water taxi and container ship powered by a hydrogen polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell system are designed and analysed compared to the current fuel-oil engine systems in terms of system energy and exergy efficiency, fuel consumption, mass and volume, environmental impacts and cost.

        <p>Ships emit significant amounts of pollutants, including nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), particulate matter (PM) and carbon dioxide (CO2), to the atmosphere, which poses threats to human health and leads to acid rain and global warming. According to the study by VIIKI (2019) and the study published by Sofiev et al. (2018), the SOx, NOx and CO2 emissions from marine traffic accounts for about 13%, 15% and 2.5% of the global emissions respectively [1], [2]. As global population grows, so does the maritime trade, and carbon dioxide emissions from the sector are expected to grow up to 250% by 2050 if no measure is taken [3].Ships emit significant amounts of pollutants, including nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), particulate matter (PM) and carbon dioxide (CO2), to the atmosphere, which poses threats to human health and leads to acid rain and global warming.

        <p>To mitigate the emission problems, the International Maritime Organization(IMO) have adopted some regulations and strategies. IMO's MARPOL Annex VI states that from 1 January 2020, all the ships sailing in Emissions Control Areas (ECAs) can only use fuels with sulfur content lower than 0.1% m/m (mass/mass) [4]. For ships outside ECAS, the sulfur cap is 0.5% m/m [4]. Based on the IMO's NOx Tier III standard, the NOx emission limit is 2.0 -3.4 g/kWh for all new ships constructed after 1 January 2016 and sailing in the North American ECA and United States Caribbean Sea ECA, or constructed after 1 January 2021 and sailing in the Baltic Sea ECA and the North Sea ECA [5]. IMO implements measures toward carbon dioxide emission as well, such as Energy Efficient Design. By 2050, the IMO aims to reduce the total annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping by 50% compared with the 2008 level [3].To mitigate the emission problems, the International Maritime Organization(IMO) have adopted some regulations and strategies.

        <p>Different options can be taken to reduce the shipping emissions, such as installing a scrubber to reduce SOx emission and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) reactor to remove NOx. Modifying the internal combustion engine (ICE) or completely changing the internal combustion propulsion system to the electric battery or fuel cell propulsion system can also reduce emissions. Using alternative fuel is another option. Ship owners can switch from Marine diesel oil (MDO) or heavy fuel oil (HFO) to marine gas oil (MGO), ultra-low sulfur fuel oil (ULSFO, fuel oil with sulfur content lower than 0.1 mass%), liquified natural gas (LNG), biofuels, hydrogen and ammonia etc. Examples of different possible fuels and their volumetric and gravimetric properties are provided in Table 1.Different options can be taken to reduce the shipping emissions, such as installing a scrubber to reduce SOx emission and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) reactor to remove NOx.

Among all these options, both hydrogen and ammonia fuel, have attracted increasing interest as zero carbon fuels due to their possibility to achieve zero emissions if generated from renewable sources, and can offer high power generation efficiency when utilised in fuel cell propulsion systems. Hydrogen is a carbon-free fuel with high mass energy density. It can be directly utilised in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). There have been several projects using hydrogen fuel cells on ships. For example, the MEMO H2 project by Alewijnse Marine Systems etc. successfully constructed and operated a PEMFC (60 kW) and battery hybrid ferry for 100 passengers [11].Lower heating value Density 10 6 J/kg 10 9 J/m 3 10 6 J/kg 10 3 603 HFO: heavy fuel oil; ULSFO: ultra-low sulfur fuel oil (0.1 mass % S); MGO: marine gasoil; LSMGO: low-sulfur marine gasoil (0.1 mass % S); MDO: marine diesel oil.

        <p>However, hydrogen still faces many issues, such as the low volumetric energy density and storage issues. To reduce the volume of hydrogen storage, the hydrogen is usually stored as high pressure compressed gas at 350 bar or 700 bar at 293.15 K or as liquid at 20.28 K under atmospheric pressure [12]. Safety is another issue. Hydrogen is highly flammable and easy to escape without attention. Ammonia is a hydrogen-carrier with a high hydrogen content. In contrast with hydrogen, ammonia has higher volumetric energy density and is easier to handle and store. According to the study by Valera-Medina et al. , ammonia can reduce the storage cost by at least three times compared with hydrogen [13]. Another advantage of ammonia over hydrogen is the mature supply chain and an existing infrastructure owing to the fertilizer industry. Moreover, ammonia has low fire and explosion risks [13]. However, the conversion between hydrogen and ammonia carries an energy penalty. There are already some studies working on reducing the energy requirement of the ammonia synthesis process. For example, Wijayanta and Aziz proposed an integrated system to convert algae to ammonia at energy efficiency of 38% [14]. Safety is another concern of ammonia due to its toxicity but well established measures already exist in place to handle it [15].However, hydrogen still faces many issues, such as the low volumetric energy density and storage issues.

        <p>There are many studies that investigate the potential application of ammonia in transportation, including ammonia used in internal combustion engines (ICEs) and in fuel cells. Reiter and Kong [16] established a study to investigate the characteristics of the ammonia-diesel dual fuel compression ignition (CI) engine. The study shows that the ammonia dual fuel engine can reduce NOx emissions compared with the diesel engine if less than 40% of the energy is supplied by ammonia, but that the ammonia emission by the diesel-ammonia dual fuel engine might reach 1000 to 3000 ppmv depending on the ammonia fueling rate. This ammonia emission level was higher than the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) exposure limit of 50 ppmv. MAN Energy Solutions reported that the application of ammonia in two-stroke dual fuel engine could reduce SOx, PM and CO2 emission by around 90% and it has a plan to install the first two-stroke ammonia dual fuel engine in 2024 [17] [18]. Ezzat and Dincer introduced and thermodynamically analyzed a vehicular system powered by hydrogen-ammonia ICE integrated with thermoelectric generator and ammonia electrolyte cell [19]. The designed systems had energy and exergy efficiencies of 31.1% and 28.94%, respectively.There are many studies that investigate the potential application of ammonia in transportation, including ammonia used in internal combustion engines (ICEs) and in fuel cells.

        <p>As well as its use in ICEs, ammonia has been applied in onboard fuel cellsan area drawing increasing interest. Zhao et al. [20] conducted a technoeconomic analysis over several carbon-neutral transport fuels and concluded that green ammonia could be 31% cheaper than green hydrogen on a source-to-tank basis. With this result, they then conducted an experimental study to investigate the performance of a hydroxide exchange membrane direct ammonia fuel cell with a precious-metal-free catalyst. Al-Hamed and Dincer proposed and thermodynamically analyzed a 3100kW-locomotives power system based on the ammonia solid oxide fuel cell and gas turbine (SOFC-GT) integrated with an ammonia dissociation and separation unit (ADSU) and PEMFCs [21]. They concluded that the ADSU-PEMFC integrated SOFC-GT system could reach overall energy and exergy efficiency of 61.2% and 66.3%, which were 13% and 10% higher than that of the simple SOFC-GT system. Kim et al. analyzed and compared different ammonia systems, including ICE, ammonia cracker with PEMFC, and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) for ship propulsion [6]. Based on the study, the SOFC system was the most environmentally friendly but was the most expensive and had the lowest power density and dynamic response. Chu et al. proposed an extended-range design for electric vehicles based on the ammonia electrolysis and PEMFC, then the application of the design on a trunk case study was analysed [22] . Ezzat and Dincer introduced and conducted energy and exergy analysis for two liquid ammonia power systems for vehicles [15]. The first system is powered by the ADSU and ICE and the second system is powered by the ADSU and PEMFC supplemented with ICE. In their other study [23], an exergoeconomic analysis of the designed ADSU and PEMFC with ICE system for a 118kW vehicle was conducted and the overall exergy efficiency and the cost rate of the system were found to be 36.2% and 29.16 £/hr. Other researchers have focussed on the onboard hydrogen production from ammonia for PEMFCs. Wang et al. developed a miniature ammonia cracker with CeO2-promoted Ni/Al2O3 catalysts for portable hydrogen fuel cells. The ammonia cracker developed, which has a weight of 195g and a volume of 50cm 3 , could reach ammonia conversion of 99.9% at 600 °C and produce H2 equivalent to 158W fuel cell power output at an ammonia feed rate of 1100 sccm [24]. Pochari Technologies invented a commercial ammonia cracker with Cs promoted Ru/CNT catalyst for vehicular applications, which could crack ammonia at a flow rate of 12kg/hr and the ammonia conversion can reach 99.95% at 600°C [25]. Hunter et al. experimentally demonstrated a system consisting of a lithium imide ammonia cracker and an anhydrous MgCl2 gas purification device to power a 100 kW PEMFC stack [26]. CSIRO developed a Ru/Al2O3 catalyzed ammonia cracker and Pd-V separation membrane (0.3 m 2 membrane area) integrated system, which can produce hydrogen at a rate of 15 kg/day and with an outlet ammonia concentration lower than 10 ppbv and nitrogen concentration lower than 1 ppmv [27]. Van Hassel et al. conducted an experimental study to prepare and characterize ammonia sorbents made by metal chlorides on activated carbons, which was used to purify hydrogen onboard and could reduce the ammonia concentration from 500 ppmv to under 0.1 ppmv [28].As well as its use in ICEs, ammonia has been applied in onboard fuel cellsan area drawing increasing interest.

        <p>The motivation of this study is to undertake a design and analysis study of a marine propulsion system that does not have any harmful impacts on the environment. Based on the literature [6], [15]- [23], compared with the hydrogen or ammonia internal combustion engine, the hydrogen or ammonia fuel cells can offer greener, more efficient and silent operation. Therefore, this study will focus on the marine fuel cell system, and mainly on the marine PEMFC system due to its relatively high technical and commercial maturity in mobile applications. To the best of the author's knowledge, most of the studies about onboard ammonia application in PEMFCs have focussed on experimental investigations of the ammonia decomposition and purification technology to produce hydrogen for PEMFCs [24]- [28].

        <p>This section describes the proposed liquid ammonia (LNH3) PEMFC power system, gaseous hydrogen (GH2) PEMFC power system, and liquid hydrogen (LH2) PEMFC power system. As shown in Figure 1, all the three systems are powered by PEMFC, but they have different fuel provision units.This section describes the proposed liquid ammonia (LNH3) PEMFC power system, gaseous hydrogen (GH2) PEMFC power system, and liquid hydrogen (LH2) PEMFC power system.

        <p>This subsection introduces the fuel provision unit of the GH2 PEMFC system, LH2 PEMFC system and LNH3 PEMFC system separately.This subsection introduces the fuel provision unit of the GH2 PEMFC system, LH2 PEMFC system and LNH3 PEMFC system separately.</p>
        <p>The fuel for the GH2 PEMFC system is the hydrogen gas stored in the compressed gas tank at 350bar and 288.15 K as seen in Figure 1.The hydrogen from the tank enters the pressure regulation valves to reduce the pressure to 120kPa before feeding to the PEMFC unit.The fuel for the GH2 PEMFC system is the hydrogen gas stored in the compressed gas tank at 350bar and 288.15 K as seen in Figure 1.The hydrogen from the tank enters the pressure regulation valves to reduce the pressure to 120kPa before feeding to the PEMFC unit.</p>
        <p>The LH2 PEMFC system works similarly to the GH2 PEMFC system, except that the fuel used is the cryogenic liquid hydrogen stored at 20.28K and 101.325kPa as shown in Figure 1. The liquid hydrogen is evaporated through a heat exchanger, which uses the waste heat from the fuel cell as the heat source, before feeding to the PEMFC unit. Due to the heat transfer from the surrounding to the cryogenic hydrogen tank, the liquid hydrogen will continuously evaporate with a boil-off ratio of around 1%/day [35]. The boil-off hydrogen gas can be controlled by a valve and directed to the fuel cell as shown in Figure 1.The LH2 PEMFC system works similarly to the GH2 PEMFC system, except that the fuel used is the cryogenic liquid hydrogen stored at 20.28K and 101.325kPa as shown in Figure 1.

        <p>Both GH2 and LH2 have the potential to be applied as marine fuels. Liquid hydrogen has higher volumetric energy density than gaseous hydrogen, but the compressed hydrogen gas storage is more popular than the cryogenic liquid hydrogen storage in the area of transportation because of the decent reliability, reasonable efficiency and technological simplicity [36]. In this study, the liquid hydrogen system is only considered for the case where the onboard space is not sufficient for the GH2 tanks.Both GH2 and LH2 have the potential to be applied as marine fuels.

        <p>Figure 1-Simplified flow diagram of the GH2 PEMFC system, LH2 PEMFC system and LNH3 PEMFC system 2.1.3 LNH3 PEMFC system fuel provision unit The fuel provision unit of the LNH3 PEMFC system is more complicated than the H2 PEMFC systems as shown in the lower section (LNH3 PEMFC system fuel provision unit) of Figure 1 with operating conditions provided in Table 2. The liquid ammonia fuel of the system is stored at 1005kPa and 298.15K in the stainless-steel tank. As with the liquid hydrogen tank, the ammonia tank experiences a boil-off ratio of 0.04%/day and the boil-off gas can be directed to the fuel cells. A Mag-drive ammonia pump is used to pump the ammonia liquid out of the tank. Then a pressure regulation valve is used to reduce the pressure of the ammonia liquid to 350kPa. The liquid ammonia is partially evaporated after the valve. Three heat exchangers (HX1, HX2, HX3) are applied to further evaporate and heat up the ammonia by using the hot stream after the ammonia cracker and burner. Ammonia cracking (Reaction 1) is an endothermic reaction, therefore, part of the ammonia fuel from the fuel tank (stream 11) and hydrogen produced from the cracker (stream 16) is combusted in the burner to provide sufficient heat to the cracker. The ammonia to hydrogen volume ratio to the burner (Reaction 2 -5) is assumed to be 1.5. The high temperature outlet stream (stream 22) from the burner then goes through the ammonia cracker and provides heat to the cracker. The burner is surrounded by a 3cm Morgan ceramic fibre insulator with thermal conductivity of 0.44 W/m K to prevent heat loss [37]. Unlike the LH2 PEMFC system, where part of the waste heat from the fuel cells is reused to evaporate the liquid hydrogen, the fuel cell waste heat is discarded in the LNH3 PEMFC system. Because if the low-grade fuel cell heat is reused in the LNH3 system, the medium-grade heat from the membrane separator or SCR reactor cannot be utilized due to the temperature restriction of the heat exchangers. Additional electrical cooling would then be required to cool down the outlet stream from the separator or SCR reactor to meet the operational temperature of the fuel cell or ammonia sorption column, which occupies extra space and consumes extra energy that outweighs the energy saved by reusing the fuel cell waste heat. The ammonia cracker produces output (stream 13) of around 75 vol% hydrogen, 25 vol% nitrogen and 250-500ppmv trace ammonia [24], [38]. According to ISO 14687-2, the ammonia concentration and nitrogen concentration for the PEMFC in the fuel cell vehicle should be lower than 100ppbv and 100ppmv, respectively [39]. A palladium membrane separator is used to purify the hydrogen from the cracker. After the membrane separator, the nitrogen and ammonia concentration in the hydrogen stream (stream 15) are reduced to 1ppmv and 10ppbv, respectively and can be fed to the PEMFC to generate power [40].Figure 1-Simplified flow diagram of the GH2 PEMFC system, LH2 PEMFC system and LNH3 PEMFC system 2.1.3 LNH3 PEMFC system fuel provision unit The fuel provision unit of the LNH3 PEMFC system is more complicated than the H2 PEMFC systems as shown in the lower section (LNH3 PEMFC system fuel provision unit) of Figure 1 with operating conditions provided in Table 2. The liquid ammonia fuel of the system is stored at 1005kPa and 298.15K in the stainless-steel tank. As with the liquid hydrogen tank, the ammonia tank experiences a boil-off ratio of 0.04%/day and the boil-off gas can be directed to the fuel cells. A Mag-drive ammonia pump is used to pump the ammonia liquid out of the tank. Then a pressure regulation valve is used to reduce the pressure of the ammonia liquid to 350kPa. The liquid ammonia is partially evaporated after the valve. Three heat exchangers (HX1, HX2, HX3) are applied to further evaporate and heat up the ammonia by using the hot stream after the ammonia cracker and burner. Ammonia cracking (Reaction 1) is an endothermic reaction, therefore, part of the ammonia fuel from the fuel tank (stream 11) and hydrogen produced from the cracker (stream 16) is combusted in the burner to provide sufficient heat to the cracker. The ammonia to hydrogen volume ratio to the burner (Reaction 2 -5) is assumed to be 1.5. The high temperature outlet stream (stream 22) from the burner then goes through the ammonia cracker and provides heat to the cracker. The burner is surrounded by a 3cm Morgan ceramic fibre insulator with thermal conductivity of 0.44 W/m K to prevent heat loss [37]. Unlike the LH2 PEMFC system, where part of the waste heat from the fuel cells is reused to evaporate the liquid hydrogen, the fuel cell waste heat is discarded in the LNH3 PEMFC system. Because if the low-grade fuel cell heat is reused in the LNH3 system, the medium-grade heat from the membrane separator or SCR reactor cannot be utilized due to the temperature restriction of the heat exchangers. Additional electrical cooling would then be required to cool down the outlet stream from the separator or SCR reactor to meet the operational temperature of the fuel cell or ammonia sorption column, which occupies extra space and consumes extra energy that outweighs the energy saved by reusing the fuel cell waste heat. The ammonia cracker produces output (stream 13) of around 75 vol% hydrogen, 25 vol% nitrogen and 250-500ppmv trace ammonia [24], [38]. According to ISO 14687-2, the ammonia concentration and nitrogen concentration for the PEMFC in the fuel cell vehicle should be lower than 100ppbv and 100ppmv, respectively [39]. A palladium membrane separator is used to purify the hydrogen from the cracker. After the membrane separator, the nitrogen and ammonia concentration in the hydrogen stream (stream 15) are reduced to 1ppmv and 10ppbv, respectively and can be fed to the PEMFC to generate power [40].</p>
        <p>In order to achieve low emissions from the system, a vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) selective catalytic reactor is used to remove the NOx produced by the ammonia burner. Part of the unreacted ammonia from the cracker (stream 24) is used as the reactant for NOx removal in the SCR (Reaction 6 -7). The NOx conversion of the SCR can reach 90% but the ammonia slip from the SCR is around 120ppmv [41], [42]. An ammonia sorption column with Calgon Carbon Ammonasorb™, which is a phosphoricacid-impregnated activated carbon based sorbent, is applied to lower the ammonia concentration to 0.1 ppmv in the outlet (point 28) [25].In order to achieve low emissions from the system, a vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) selective catalytic reactor is used to remove the NOx produced by the ammonia burner.

In the PEMFC unit, the hydrogen from the fuel provision unit is fed to the fuel cell with a stochiometric ratio of 1.2 to prevent anode starvation. To increase hydrogen utilization, the unused hydrogen (stream 5 in the PEMFC unit) is recirculated back to the anode by the hydrogen recirculation pump.

        <p>Based on the modelling, a single Hydrogenics HD-30 fuel cell stack (31kW rated power) is sufficient to power the water taxi at each load factor. Conversely, 141 and 142 Hydrogenics HD-180 fuel cell stacks (198kW rated power) are required to power the cargo ship H2 PEMFC systems and LNH3 PEMFC system, respectively. For the cargo ship, the power generated by all the stacks is assumed to be equal. But in reality, each stack can generate different amounts of power to reach the highest overall system efficiency. The idle power (i.e. minimum operating power) of the heavy-duty PEMFC stack is about 5% of the rated power [82]. Hence, when the cargo ship is at the idle stage or at berth, only 30-50 stacks are at work for the H2 PEMFC systems and 12-18 stacks are at work for the LNH3 PEMFC system to reach the minimum power requirement of the stacks and at the same time, maximize the system efficiency (explained more in section 5.2.1). To provide the start-up power for the equipment, a battery of 1000 kWh, 1100 kWh and 2000 kWh are required for the cargo ship GH2, LH2 and LNH3 PEMFC system while a battery of 1 kWh and 3 kWh are required for the water taxi GH2 and LNH3 PEMFC system. The fuel mass flow rate and power generated at different propulsion load factors for the designed water taxi systems and cargo ship systems are presented in supplementary information D.Based on the modelling, a single Hydrogenics HD-30 fuel cell stack (31kW rated power) is sufficient to power the water taxi at each load factor.

        <p>Figure 4 compares the system LHV energy efficiencies of different water taxi and cargo ship systems. The efficiency of the diesel engine system and the ammonia-diesel dual fuel engine system are estimated according to the studies [16], [29]- [34]. As shown in Figure 4, the H2 and NH3 PEMFC systems' efficiency for both case studies increases from full load to a lower load factor, owing to the lower overpotential of the fuel cell stack at lower current density, which results in higher stack efficiency. At propulsion load factors higher than 8%-10% for the H2 (GH2 or LH2) PEMFC systems or higher than 36%-43% for the LNH3 PEMFC systems, the stack efficiency dominates the system efficiency, but as the propulsion load factor reduces below this value, the power loss related to the balance of plant contributes increasingly significantly. Although most of the components (e.g. pumps) can adjust their power demand based on the output from the fuel cell, some components, such as controllers, require constant power supplied by the fuel cell stack regardless of the stack's output. This constant power percentage will increase as the load factor reduces, which results in decreasing system efficiency. As shown in Figure 4, the optimum propulsion load factor for the H2 PEMFC systems is about 8-10%, while that for the LNH3 PEMFC system is about 36-43% due to the higher proportion of the balance of plant's power loss. For the cargo ship PEMFC systems operated at propulsion load factors lower than the optimum load factor, it would be beneficial if only some of the stacks are on-line to reduce the balance of plant power loss, which could maximize the system's efficiency.Figure 4 compares the system LHV energy efficiencies of different water taxi and cargo ship systems.

        <p>For the water taxi, the GH2 PEMFC system is the most efficient among the four systems at all propulsion load factors owing to the high thermal LHV efficiency of the stack. The LNH3 system is also powered by the stack but around 14% (by volume) of the ammonia fuel and around 7% (by volume) of the hydrogen produced are used in the burner to provide sufficient heat to the cracker, which leads to lower system efficiency compared with the H2 PEMFC system. The water taxi LNH3 PEMFC system has higher LHV efficiency than the water taxi diesel engine system and the ammoniafuel oil dual fuel engine system at all load factors. Owing to the low revolution rate, high air to fuel ratio and long stroke, the two-stroke engine for the cargo ship can operate at higher LHV efficiency than the four-stroke engine for the water taxi [83]. Therefore, for the cargo ship, the GH2 PEMFC system has the highest LHV efficiency only if the propulsion load factor is below 48%, otherwise the ULSFO diesel engine system is the most efficient. Among the five cargo ship systems, the LNH3 PEMFC system is the least efficient because of the extra power required by the ammonia cracker. The detail of power loss distribution of the designed system is provided in supplementary material E. Beside the energy analysis, an exergy analysis is conducted for the designed PEMFC systems as a supplement to measure how close the systems are to ideality and to determine the sources of irreversibility, which could help to enhance the system energy utilization. Figure 5 compares the system exergy efficiencies of the designed water taxi and cargo ship PEMFC systems at different load factors. The exergy efficiencies follow similar trend as the energy efficiencies. Due to the irreversibility incurred by the extra ammonia cracker (with burner), the ammonia PEMFC systems have lower exergy efficiencies than the hydrogen PEMFC systems. Moreover, the exergy efficiencies of the cargo ship PEMFC systems are lower than that of the water taxi PEMFC systems owing to the higher destruction rate from the electrical circuitry.For the water taxi, the GH2 PEMFC system is the most efficient among the four systems at all propulsion load factors owing to the high thermal LHV efficiency of the stack.

        <p>The exergy efficiencies and the system energy utilization could be improved by reducing exergy destruction rates (𝐸 ̇𝑋𝑑 ). The overall exergy destruction rates of the water taxi GH2 PEMFC systems, LNH3 PEMFC system and the cargo ship GH2 system, LH2 system and LNH3 system at full load are 26 kW, 36 kW and 26600 kW, 26800 kW and 35900 kW, respectively and their distributions are shown in Figure 6. The PEMFC contributes most significantly to the exergy destruction rate of all the designed PEMFC systems. Therefore, reducing the fuel cell destruction rate could lead to significantly improvement in the system exergy efficiencies, which might be achieved by increasing the PEMFC operating temperature and pressure, reducing membrane thickness etc. Improving the efficiency of the electric devices, such as inverters, will also improve the system exergy efficiency. For the GH2 PEMFC system, the pressure reduction valve contributes significantly to the irreversibility because of the large pressure drop and replacing the valves with expanders might recover the pressure energy and improve the energy utilization. For the LH2 and LNH3 systems, the liquid fuel evaporators and heaters are significant exergy destroyers, and their destruction rate could be lowered by reducing the temperature difference. Moreover, in the LNH3 PEMFC systems, the ammonia cracker and burner occupy 16%-17% of the exergy destruction rate. The high burner destruction rate is associated with the high entropy generation, which could be reduced by improving burner design and operation conditions (e.g., equivalence ratio). While the destruction rate of the ammonia cracker could be reduced by lowering the operating temperature of the cracker through improving cracker design or cracking catalyst.

        <p>Figure 7 (a) compares the volume and mass of different water taxi power systems, including the mass and volume of the fuel tanks with fuel to support the water taxi for 8-hour operation, all the equipment in Figure 1 (e.g. pumps, cracker and fuel cell stacks) and the batteries, converters, drive and motor in Figure 2. The diesel engine systems' volume and mass are estimated from the study [16], [29]- [34], [47]. In term of the mass and volume of the fuel tanks, the gaseous hydrogen tank has the highest volume and mass among the four systems due to the low volumetric energy density of the gaseous hydrogen and the heavy and bulky tanks required to withstand the high gaseous pressure. The fuel tank for the LNH3 PEMFC system has smaller mass and volume than the GH2 system but is 2.5 times larger in mass and 3.2 times larger in volume compared with the LSMGO diesel engine system. According to the studies by several researchers and companies, such as Enviu and Alewijnse Marine Systems [11], the GH2 PEMFC system can meet the space and mass constraints of the small-scale vessels, such as the water taxi. In this study, Figure 7 (a) indicates that the LNH3 PEMFC system has comparable mass and 42% lower system volume with respect to the hydrogen system. It is noted that the ammonia cracker with burner and purifier contribute only slightly to the water taxi LNH3 PEMFC system's mass and volume (3.6 % and 3.0%, respectively). The water taxi LNH3 PEMFC system is smaller and lighter than the ammonia-fuel oil dual fuel engine system because of the high efficiency and power density of the PEMFC but it is still 46% heavier and 5% bulkier than the LSMGO diesel engine system. the Pacific Ocean with a nonstop voyage leg of 6,600nm and system equipment (all the equipment in Figure 1 and the batteries, converters, drive and motor in Figure 2). The volume and mass of the cargo ship diesel engine systems are estimated from the Ref. [6], [84], [85]. According to the study by Mao et al. [50], the available space of fuel storage (i.e. maximum fuel tank volume) of the 2000 -2999 TEU cargo ship is 3330 to 4700 m 3 . Therefore, as seen in the Figure 7 (b), the GH2 PEMFC system (350bar), which requires fuel tank with volume of 9100 m 3 is too bulky for the long-distance and large-scale shipping application. Even if increasing the pressure of the tank to 700bar, the volume of gaseous hydrogen tank, which is around 6695 m 3 , is still not within the volume limit. Conversely, the LH2 PEMFC system, LNH3 PEMFC system and ammonia dual fuel engine system can all meet the constraint. The LNH3 PEMFC system is less beneficial than the LH2 PEMFC system in term of the mass due to the lower fuel mass energy density and the additional ammonia cracker required. However, the LNH3 is easier to handle, and has a more mature supply chain compared with the LH2, which enhances its potential to be applied as the ship fuel at large scale.Figure 7 (a) compares the volume and mass of different water taxi power systems, including the mass and volume of the fuel tanks with fuel to support the water taxi for 8-hour operation, all the equipment in Figure 1 (e.g. pumps, cracker and fuel cell stacks) and the batteries, converters, drive and motor in Figure 2.

        <p>The lifecycle GHG emissions of the water taxi and cargo ship based on different power systems are shown in Figure 8. The hydrogen and ammonia are assumed to be green hydrogen and green ammonia produced from electrolysis using renewable energies. In contrast with the fuel oil diesel engine system, the H2 PEMFC system, LNH3 PEMFC system and ammonia-fuel oil dual fuel engine system can reduce the life cycle GHG emissions by 91%, 88% and 72%, respectively for the water taxi and by 91%, 88% and 80%, respectively for the cargo ship.The lifecycle GHG emissions of the water taxi and cargo ship based on different power systems are shown in Figure 8.

        <p>Instead of just the lifecycle GHG emissions, the operational emissions of different marine systems are also analysed. The GH2 and LH2 PEMFC system can reach zero emissions during operation while the LNH3 system can also prevent the PM and SOx emissions but will emit some NOx (2103 kg NOx /year for cargo ship and 1.6 kg NOx /year for water taxi) due to the combustion of hydrogen and ammonia in the burner. Nevertheless, the LNH3 system (with SCR) can reach operational NOx reduction of 95% and 98% compared with the fuel oil diesel engine systems with SCR for the water taxi and cargo ship, respectively. Switching the fuel oil diesel engine to an ammonia-fuel oil dual fuel engine could curtail the operational PM emissions by 87%-90% and operational SOx emissions by 90%. However, the ammonia-fuel oil dual fuel engine suffers from significant ammonia slip and NOx emissions.

        <p>For the cargo ship, the PEMFC system offers another advantage over the diesel engine system because it could replace the diesel genset for the auxiliary power generation. The replacement of the HFO gensets by fuel cells for auxiliary power can reduce the operational SOx, NOx and PM emissions by around 7400 kg/year, 5500 kg/year and 900 kg /year, respectively. Although the genset emissions are small compared with the main engine emissions, they lead to significant health impacts on coastal residents. The gensets are used to provide the auxiliary power for the ships when they are berthing or in the harbour, therefore, can cause direct emissions to the closed coastal area.For the cargo ship, the PEMFC system offers another advantage over the diesel engine system because it could replace the diesel genset for the auxiliary power generation.

        <p>The cumulative cost of different water taxi power systems and cargo ship power systems with a lifetime of 25 years are compared in Figure 9. The system cost includes the cost of the fuel over the system lifetime (Table 9) and the cost of the system equipment (all the equipment in Figure 1 and the batteries, converters, drive and motor in Figure 2). For the water taxi case study, the GH2 PEMFC system is more cost-efficient than the LNH3 PEMFC system owing to the lower fuel consumption and lower CAPEX. The water taxi LNH3 PEMFC system has similar cost to the ammonia dual fuel engine but is 44% and 105% more costly than the GH2 PEMFC system and LSMGO diesel engine. For the cargo ship case study, the GH2 PEMFC system, LH2 PEMFC system and LNH3 PEMFC system have comparable costs, which are around 108%, 112% and 116% higher than the ULSFO diesel engine system, respectively. Owing to the high cost of the large gaseous hydrogen tank required for the cross-ocean voyage, the cost difference between the LNH3 PEMFC system and GH2 PEMFC system for the cargo ship is smaller than that for the water taxi.The cumulative cost of different water taxi power systems and cargo ship power systems with a lifetime of 25 years are compared in Figure 9.

Hence, improving the stack exergy efficiency would lead to a significant improvement in the system energy utilization. • The GH2 PEMFC system, which requires a fuel tank with volume of 9100 m 3 cannot meet the space constraint of 4700m 3 for the 2600TEU cargo ship while the LH2 PEMFC system and the LNH3 PEMFC system, whose fuel tank volume is 2754 m 3 and 2748 m 3 , respectively, are within the volume limits. Therefore, in term of mass and volume, the GH2 PEMFC system might not be suitable for the large-scale and long-distance shipping marine application. • The designed GH2, LH2, LNH3 PEMFC systems using green hydrogen and ammonia can reach nearly zero operational emissions. Compared to the conventional fuel oil engine system, the GH2 system, LH2 system and LNH3 system could reduce lifecycle GHG emissions by around 91%, 91% and 88%, which all meet the IMO target of 50% GHG reduction by 2050. • Taking into account the predicted fuel prices over the ship system life of 25-year, the cargo ship GH2, LH2 and LNH3 system have cumulative costs of 280M£, 284M£ and 289M£, respectively, while the water taxi GH2 system and LNH3 system have cumulative costs of 184k£ and 265k£, respectively. Further carbon policy measures and cost reduction in green fuels and fuel cells are required to bring the designed PEMFC systems down by 31%-54% to make them cost competitive to the fuel oil engine system.• The PEMFCs contribute most significantly to the exergy destruction rate for all the designed PEMFC systems.
