        <p>solar-energy conversion process, not only in solar cell but also in photocatalysis, involves solar-light harvesting and photoexcited charge carrier separation/transportation. [8,9] Heterostructure, in which materials with different properties are integrated together, generally can harvest wide solar light derived from multi ple components and possesses prominent photoexcited charge separation/transportation properties benefiting from internal electric field formed at the heterointerface. [10] Hence, exploring suitable components to construct heterostructure represents an efficient and facile strategy to improve the solar energy conversion efficiency.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, 2D materials have attracted enormous research interest in optical electronic devices, catalysis, and solar-energy conversion fields due to their high specific surface area, [11] large fraction of surface exposed atoms, [12] and excellent mechanical, optical, and electronic properties. [13,14] Benefiting from layered structural properties, 2D materials are prone to be constructed into heterostructures. Typically, 2D heterostructures include vertical heterostructures in which the layers of various 2D materials are stacked vertically, [15] and lateral heterostructures in which multiple 2D materials are seamlessly stitched lateral. [16] Most of the current reported 2D heterostructures Photocarrier recombination remains a big barrier for the improvement of solar energy conversion efficiency. For 2D materials, construction of heterostructures represents an efficient strategy to promote photoexcited carrier separation via an internal electric field at the heterointerface. However, due to the difficulty in seeking two components with suitable crystal lattice mismatch, most of the current 2D heterostructures are vertical heterostructures and the exploration of 2D lateral heterostructures is scarce and limited. Here, lateral epitaxial heterostructures of BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 at the atomic level are fabricated via sonicating-assisted etching of Cl in BiOCl. This unique lateral heterostructure expedites photoexcited charge separation and transportation through the internal electric field induced by chemical bonding at the lateral interface. As a result, the lateral BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 heterostructure demonstrates superior CO 2 photoreduction properties with a CO yield rate of about 30 µmol g -1 h -1 under visible light illumination. The strategy to fabricate lateral epitaxial heterostructures in this work is expected to provide inspiration for preparing other 2D lateral heterostructures used in optoelectronic devices, energy conversion, and storage fields.</p>
        <p>Solar energy is a green and renewable energy source. [1,2] It can be converted into electricity via solar cell or be stored into chemical forms via photocatalytic water splitting for H 2 and photocatalytic CO 2 reduction for CO, CH 4 , etc. [3][4][5][6][7] As a result, employing solar energy is recognized as a promising strategy to meet continuously increased worldwide energy demand. The typical</p>
        <p>are vertical heterostructures, such as BiOI/Bi 2 WO 6 , Bi 12 O 17 Cl 2 / MoS 2 . In vertical heterostructures, the internal electric field at the heterointerface is originated from the van der Waals force between interlayers. [8,[17][18][19] As is known, the van der Waals force is weaker than chemical bonding which exists at heterointerface in lateral heterostructures. Thus, the photoexcited charge separation/transportation properties are proposed to be better in lateral heterostructure. However, due to strict restrictions in lattice mismatch and difficulties in selecting suitable components, the construction of lateral heterostructures is strictly limited to few species. Hence, exploring the possibilities of new 2D lateral heterostructures is of great importance to promote the evolution of materials and improve the solar-energy conversion efficiency.</p>
        <p>Bismuth oxyhalides (BiOX, X = Cl, Br, I) represent a popular species of 2D semiconductors due to their special sp hybridization which results in photogenerated charge carriers with less effective mass and superior mobility. [4,19] In the typical crystal structure of BiOX, [Bi 2 O 2 ] 2+ layer is sandwiched between two slabs of halogen ions by strong electrovalent bonds along the highly active [001] direction, and the two neighboring slabs of halogen ions are connected by van de Waals interactions. [20,21] Benefiting from this unique structure, Bi 2 O 3 , which is a typical visible-light sensitizer, has the inherent priority to be in situ formed in BiOCl via removing halogen ions in the interlayer. In this work, BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 with lateral epitaxial heterostructure is fabricated via etching the edged halogen ion of BiOCl with the assistance of Ag and water molecule under sonicating. It is proved that BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 can not only take the advantages of both BiOCl and Bi 2 O 3 in solar absorption but also can delocalize the photoproduced charge carriers via in-building driving force generated by lateral heterojunction. As a result, the lateral heterogeneous BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 possesses great potential to be excellent photocatalyst, and its CO yield rate for the CO 2 photoreduction process under visible light irradiation is about 30 µmol g -1 h -1 . This facile method to prepare lateral heterostructure paves way to fabricate other 2D lateral heterostructure, and thus facilitates their further application in electronic devices, energy storage, and conversion fields.</p>
        <p>As observed in our previous work, Ag nanoparticles are prone to be loaded on the edge of BiOCl during the hydrothermal reaction under the perturbation of water with the content close to 10%. [4] With the content of water continuously increasing to be larger than 20%, the edge of BiOCl starts to be etched into multiple layered thin nanosheets of Bi 2 O 3 by the loaded Ag nanoparticles. Interestingly, the dimension of the generated thin nanosheets increases with the content of water increasing. The fabrication process and the proposed formation mechanism of BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 with lateral epitaxial heterostructure are illustrated in Figure 1 Adv. Mater. 2020, 32, 2004311 are present and BiOCl nanoplate keeps the original sharp edge. It further confirms the role of Ag during the fabrication of BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 . Thus, it can be concluded that both water and Ag are indispensable components in fabricating 2D lateral heterogeneous BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 . In this work, BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 prepared with 80% of water is selected to characterize its structure and CO 2 photoreduction performance.</p>
        <p>X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was adopted to characterize the composition of the as-prepared powders. As shown in Figure 2a, the diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern can be indexed to BiOCl and Bi 2 O 3 , indicating that the as-synthesized materials mainly contain BiOCl and Bi 2 O 3 components. The annular dark-field TEM in Figure 2b and low-resolution TEM image of single particle in Figure S11, Supporting Information, demonstrate that there is a clear brightness contrast between the middle and edge part of the as-prepared particle. The top view (Figure S12, Supporting Information) and cross-sectional (Figure S13, Supporting Information) SEM images of the asprepared particles further confirm the existence of the interface between edge part and middle part in the as-prepared particles. By characterizing the atomic high-resolution TEM image on the heterointerface, it can be observed in Figure 2c that there is no big difference in the lattice fringe between the middle and edge part of the as-prepared particle, revealing that the fabrication method in this work will not change the lattice assignment at the heterointerface and thus perfect lateral epitaxial heterostructure can be generated. To further confirm the composition of the middle and edge part of the as-prepared particle, the EDS elemental mapping and EDS line profiles were carried out on Bi, O, and Cl atoms, and the corresponding results are illustrated in Figure 2d-f etched out with the assistance of water and noble metal particle without distorting the lattice at the heterointerface. It reveals that etching facilitates the growth of epitaxial heterostructure via removing the elements between layers in the 2D layered materials.</p>
        <p>X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) analysis was employed to further study the chemical composition of the as-prepared lateral heterostructure. As shown in Figure S14, Supporting Information, there are three deconvolved peaks in the high-resolution core-level XPS spectrum of O 1s for BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 , which is quite different from pure BiOCl which only presents two deconvolved peaks in the XPS spectra.</p>
        <p>The peak observed at 530.15 eV for BiOCl and 529.84 eV for BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 are assigned to the lattice oxygen. [22,23] Since Cl atom in the edge of BiOCl is etched out in BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 , the concentration of the positive charges on Bi atom in BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 at the edge part is decreased. As a result, the electron screening effect for the related Bi-O bonding is decreased, [24,25] which results in decreased bonding energy for lattice oxygen in BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 . Similar phenomenon appears in the bridging hydroxyls with XPS peak sited at 531.97 eV for BiOCl and 530.61 eV for BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 . Compared with BiOCl, XPS spectra of O 1s for BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 presents another additional peak shoulder located at 533.52 eV which belongs to the physisorbed water. [26] This is attributed to the fact that the open metal sites caused by etching of interlayer Cl in BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 have strong interaction with the surrounding water.</p>
        <p>Figure 3a shows the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the as-prepared BiOCl and BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 . It can be observed that BiOCl possesses a featured absorption band with the edge at about 370 nm. [4] In contrast, there are two absorption bands in the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum of BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 . The one with the edge at about 370 nm is assigned to band-gap absorption of BiOCl, and another one with the edge extended to 613 nm belonged to Bi 2 O 3 . It is obvious that there is no big difference on the band-gap absorption of BiOCl for pure BiOCl and BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 , indicating that the etching assisted growth of lateral heterostructure do not change much on the original 2D materials. Potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectrum (PEIS) measurement is generally employed to evaluate interface resistance and carrier mobility of semiconductors. [21] As demonstrated in Figure 3b, the impedance radius of BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 is much smaller than that of BiOCl, revealing that the resistance for the charge transfer in BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 is lower than that in BiOCl. Thus, compared with BiOCl, the photogenerated charge carriers in BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 possess larger mobility, which facilitates the photocatalytic process.</p>
        <p>Transient pump-proble absorption spectroscopy (TAS) is a well-known technique in developing in-depth understanding of photoexcited charge carrier dynamics and interfacial charge transfer dynamics. [27][28][29] The TAS spectrum of BiOCl in Figure S15, Supporting Information, and TAS spectrum of BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 in Figure 3c show a featured bleaching peak at around 390 nm which is assigned to state-filling effect of the band edge of BiOCl. [30,31] Besides, a positive signal sited at about 380 nm is observed in BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 and it is arising from electroabsorptive effects of Bi 2 O 3 . The electron lifetime in BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 probed by TAS kinetics (Figure 3d) is observed to be a little longer than that in BiOCl. It reveals the existence of charge-separation states in BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 which is originated from internal electric field induced by strong chemical bonding at the heterointerface. [31] To further confirm it, we Benefiting from better charge separation and charge transfer kinetics, BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 is proposed to be able to generate more photoexcited charge carriers. Transient photocurrent response is a direct way to check the amount of photoexctied charge carriers. With larger amount of photoexcited charge carriers, the intensity of the photocurrent is higher. The results of transient photocurrent response over BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 and BiOCl under simulated solar light are displayed in Figure S16, Supporting Information. The current density of BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 in each light-on cycle is about -1.05 µA cm -2 , which is 7 times that of BiOCl. In contrast, for BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 with vertical heterostructure reported in reference, [32] the current density is about 0.70 µA cm -2 which is less than 5 times that of pure BiOCl, indicating that lateral heterostructure is superior than vertical heterostructure. Thus, it can be documented that strong internal electric field at the lateral epitaxial heterojunction of BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 can help to facilitate more efficient photoexcited charge separation and generate more photoinduced charge carriers.</p>
        <p>The detection of molecular oxygen active species is another effective way to check the species and amount of photoexcited charge carriers. Generally, •OH is employed to evaluate positive charge carriers and •O 2</p>
        <p>-is employed to evaluate negative charge carriers. DMPO assisted ESR measurement can be used to detect molecular oxygen active species. [33,34] As shown in Figure 5a, both BiOCl and BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 present four ESR signals with the intensities of 1:2:2:1 under simulated solar light, which is contributed to the appearance of DMPO-•OH adduct originated from the OH -/H 2 O oxidation by holes. [23] Compared with BiOCl, the ESR signals of BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 is stronger. As the square of signal intensity is approximately proportional to the number of free radicals, [35] more charge carriers can be generated over BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 under simulated solar light illumination. Similar phenomenon can be observed in Figure 5b, in which four ESR signals assigned to DMPO-•O 2</p>
        <p>-and related with the O 2 reduction by electrons can be detected. [36] Hence, it can be inferred that BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 can produce larger number of holes and electrons under simulated solar light in the photocatalytic process. Figure 5c shows that no ESR signals can be detected over pure BiOCl under visible light irradiation whereas four peaks of DMPO-•OH are observed over BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 in the same process. The inspection of DMPO-•O 2 -in Figure 5d demonstrates that both BiOCl and BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 cannot produce electrons under visible light irradiation. Thus, it is obvious that the introduction of Bi 2 O 3 can facilitate BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 to utilize the visible light to produce holes. Since Ag nanoparticles are employed in assisting the growth of BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 , we compared the visible-light-driven oxygen active species of BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 and BiOCl-Ag to further check whether BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 is influenced by the plasmonic effect induced by residual Ag. The results are demonstrated in Figure S17, Supporting Information. It is clear that the visiblelight-driven oxygen active species in BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 and BiOCl-Ag are completely different. The visible-light-driven oxygen active species in BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 are mainly •OH while those in BiOCl-Ag are mainly •O 2 -, revealing that the plasmonic effect induced by few amounts of residual Ag has negligible influence on BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 , and the outstanding photocatalytic activity of BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 is mainly originated from the construction of lateral heterostructures.</p>
        <p>CO 2 photoreduction was carried out to further investigate the role of the lateral heterojunction in the application of lateral heterogeneous BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 . As shown in Figure 6a, the CO yield rate of BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 is about 75 µmol g -1 h -1 under simulated solar light while the CO yield rate of BiOCl is about 52 µmol g -1 h -1 under same conditions. With the irradiation of visible light, nearly no CO is generated by BiOCl, indicating that pure BiOCl cannot utilize visible light to reduce CO 2 into fuel energy. In contrast, a CO yield rate of about 29 µmol g -1 h -1 can be observed over BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 in the same process. The rather larger CO yield over BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 under visible light benefits from the visible absorption of Bi 2 O 3 and the superior charge separation driven by the intrinsic electric field induced by the lateral heterojunction. The details of the CO 2 photoreduction process is studied via inspecting the time-dependent CO yield. Figure 6c shows that the yield of CO increases smoothly with the increasing of irradiation time under visible light illumination, and about 386 µmol g -1 can be generated over BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 in 12 h. Figure 6d presents three cycling test of the CO 2 photoreduction process under the irradiation of visible light. It can be observed that the CO yield rate in each test time is stable and all the values are around 30 µmol g -1 h -1 , indicating that the photoreduction properties over BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 is stable. Isotope measurement with 13 CO 2 as the source was carried out to check whether the yield of CO is originated from the photoreduction of CO 2 instead of atmosphere or other sources. [30] Figure 6e demonstrates that the 13 CO is the mainly product in the photocatalytic process, revealing that the CO is indeed generated by the photoreduction of CO 2 .</p>
        <p>In summary, the lateral heterogeneous BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 2D material was prepared via etching with the assistance of noblemetal nanoparticles and water under sonicating. Benefiting from the strong intrinsic electric field induced by chemical bonding at the lateral heterointerface, BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 possesses outstanding charge separation and mobility properties. In addition, Bi 2 O 3 can utilize visible light. Due to these multiple advantages, the CO 2 photoreduction properties of BiOCl @ Bi 2 O 3 is enhanced in a large extent and the visible-light-driven CO yield rate is about 30 µmol g -1 h -1 . The method to fabricate lateral heterostructure in this work can help to enrich the current family of 2D heterogeneous materials, and thus will promote the applications of these 2D materials in optical devices, energy conversion, and storage fields.</p>
