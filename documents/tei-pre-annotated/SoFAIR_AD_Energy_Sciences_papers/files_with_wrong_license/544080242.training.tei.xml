        <p>In recent years, the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) has become a global concern because of the potential threats they can pose to human health (Sano et al., 2020;Sivalingam et al., 2020). ARB are bacteria with the capacity of survive and multiply in the presence of the antibiotics specifically designed to kill them. The development of ARB is a complex process in which a microorganism can be intrinsically resistant to a drug or can acquire this resistance through different mechanisms (Blair et al., 2015). Multiple pathways allow the exchange of genetic material within bacteria, specifically, the four major mechanisms for developed antibiotic resistance are drug inactivation, target modification, reduced antibiotic permeability and antibiotic efflux pumps (Lim and Webb, 2005). Once the resistance has been acquired, this can be transferred to other bacteria, increasing the number of ARB. Consequently, diseases produced by these ARB cannot be effectively treated with antibiotics and being responsible for more than 700,000 human deaths per year (Cassini et al., 2019;Robinson et al., 2016).In recent years, the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) has become a global concern because of the potential threats they can pose to human health (Sano et al., 2020;Sivalingam et al., 2020).

        <p>Furthermore, not only vertical transfer (i.e., cell division) but also horizontal gene transfer processes (conjugation, transduction and natural transformation) developing the Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs) contributes to the spread of antibiotic resistance (Lorenz and Wackernagel, 1994). During conjugation, exchange of genetic elements occurs when the active donor cell and the recipient cell are able to initiate and maintain a physical contact. Conversely, after cell lysis, the transfer of foreign genetic elements only requires a metabolically active recipient capable of being infected (transduction) or of actively acquiring these genetic elements (natural transformation) into its own chromosome (Dodd, 2012). In addition, mobile genetic elements such as integrons and transposons have been widely studied in last years due to their contribution on the antibiotic resistance spread. Integrons are genetic structures able to capture gene cassettes that can encode antibiotic resistance. The mobility of integrons is directly related with transposons, jumping gene systems with resistance genes incorporated (Bennett, 2008) and plasmids (Ghaly et al., 2020). These moving elements carrying genetic information can be transfer to the bacterial genome, contributing to the spread of antibiotic resistance (Sabbagh et al., 2021;Sütterlin et al., 2020).Furthermore, not only vertical transfer (i.e., cell division) but also horizontal gene transfer processes (conjugation, transduction and natural transformation) developing the Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs) contributes to the spread of antibiotic resistance (Lorenz and Wackernagel, 1994).

        <p>The presence of ARB in water bodies has also become a major environmental challenge (Anthony et al., 2020;Yang et al., 2014). This problem has been exacerbated by the increasing and uncontrolled consumption of antibiotics worldwide, and the absence of efficient technologies for killing these pathogens at large scale (Jones et al., 2005;Radjenovic et al., 2009;Wang et al., 2016;Watkinson et al., 2007). Hospitals present a friendly environment for the spread of ARB because of the high concentration of bacteria and drugs contained in their effluents. Most antibiotics are poorly metabolized in the human body, being excreted mainly by urine (Göbel et al., 2004). Furthermore, some pathogens from infected patients are removed from the body by the same way. This promotes the occurrence of larger concentrations of ARB in hospital urines, and therefore in hospital wastewater (HWW), in comparison with the population typically found in urban wastewater (Verlicchi et al., 2010b). No restrictions are currently foreseen in the European Directive 91/271/EEC for hospital effluents and then, the management of HWW (including hospital urines) is carried out together with urban and industrial wastewater. Most of these effluents are merged and discharged into wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) or even disposed poorly or untreated into the environment (Mubedi et al., 2013), being an important source of ARB (Michael et al., 2013).The presence of ARB in water bodies has also become a major environmental challenge (Anthony et al., 2020;Yang et al., 2014).

        <p>WWTPs are the unique barrier for the reduction of pollution and toxicity in wastewater coming from different sources. Nevertheless, the technology implemented in conventional WWTPs is not capable to efficiently remove ARB (Beattie et al., 2020;Behera et al., 2011). In addition, WWTPs environment may promote mutation mechanisms between bacteria and also enhance horizontal gene transfer processes, increasing the population of ARB and other mobile genetic elements in treated water (Di Cesare et al., 2020a;Ju et al., 2019;Rizzo et al., 2013). The emergence of antibiotic resistance in different water matrices, such as rivers, seawater or HWW has been recently reported (Makowska et al., 2020;Sanchez et al., 2018) and defined by WHO as a potential risk for human health and environment (Organization, 2014). For this reason, it is of crucial importance to develop efficient technologies that allow the removal of ARB and other mobile genetic elements from different water matrices to minimize the spread of antibiotic resistance. In this paper, a review of disinfection technologies in water, wastewater, and hospital wastewater (including urine matrices) is reported to discuss the most common treatment technologies for the removal of bacteria, ARB, ARGs and other genetic mobile elements in different matrices. To the author's knowledge, a deep information is still needed related to the state of the art of disinfection technologies to properly manage hospital effluents and above all hospital urines.WWTPs are the unique barrier for the reduction of pollution and toxicity in wastewater coming from different sources.

        <p>ARB from urinary tract infection (UTI) patients are excreted by urine which is merged with other wastewater produced in different areas of hospital facilities (kitchen, laundry…). Similarly, pathogens which do not present antibiotic-resistance, are also eliminated in the same way (Grabe et al., 2015). As discussed in the introduction, HWW also contain a multitude of antibiotics from patients' urine and faeces. Hence, these effluents present a favourable environment for both the generation of ARB and the spread of existing ones. In this context, the development and application of efficient technologies for killing pathogens, both multi-resistant and non-resistant, in sanitary effluents is critical from an engineering and environmental viewpoint.ARB from urinary tract infection (UTI) patients are excreted by urine which is merged with other wastewater produced in different areas of hospital facilities (kitchen, laundry…).

        <p>The occurrence of ARB in different water bodies has become a major environmental issue. This problem has been aggravated by the misuse of antibiotics worldwide and the scarce legislation regulating the treatment of effluents containing ARB. However, concern in the scientific community related to the development of highly efficient technologies for killing microorganisms has increased considerably in recent years. Fig. 1 summarizes the publications related to different water matrices disinfection reported from the early 80s. Specifically, Elservier's Scopus were the database used to develop the search using "drinking water disinfection", "wastewater disinfection", and "hospital wastewater disinfection" &amp; "urine disinfection" as keywords.The occurrence of ARB in different water bodies has become a major environmental issue.

        <p>Natural waters are directly related to consumption, so the presence of microorganisms in them poses a risk to human health (Baquero et al., 2008;Kümmerer, 2001). For this reason, a greater number of studies have been carried out on the disinfection of natural waters during the last 40 years. Also noteworthy is the number of publications related to wastewater disinfection, which although lower than those related to natural water, represent up to the 35.57% of the total publications on disinfection. This great concern by part of the scientific community may be related to the inefficiency of conventional WWTPs in the elimination of microorganisms, and the danger to the environment that their persistent presence may cause. On the other hand, as mentioned in the introduction, one of the major sources of pathogens are hospital effluents, and more specifically, hospital urines. Even so, only 3.83% of the publications summarized in Fig. 1 are referred to disinfection of urine and hospital effluents. However, due to the high environmental and human health threat posed by these outbreaks with such a high concentration of ARB (Brown et al., 2006;Mohammadali and Davies, 2017), in the coming years, it is expected a growing interest from the scientific community and the increase in the number of works related to urine and hospital effluents disinfection.Natural waters are directly related to consumption, so the presence of microorganisms in them poses a risk to human health (Baquero et al., 2008;Kümmerer, 2001).

        <p>Natural waters include rivers, lakes, rainwater or groundwater which naturally contain large amounts of inorganic ions and organic matter, although its composition can be altered by agricultural, domestic and industrial activities (Rommozzi et al., 2020). The presence of the different inorganic salts also depends on the water source since these compounds have a vast spectrum. According to literature, HCO 3 -, NO 3 -, NO 2 -, Cl -, SO 4 -or NH 4 + can be found in natural waters within the ranges 20-800 mg L -1 , 0.05-60 mg L -1 , 0.40-1 mg L -1 , 4-700 mg L -1 , 0-630 mg L -1 and 0.20-3 mg L -1 , respectively (Bhateria and Jain, 2016;De Kwaadsteniet et al., 2013;Vione et al., 2009). Regarding the organic content in natural water, both humic (hydrophobic) and non-humic (hydrophilic) fractions can be found, including microorganisms (Brillas et al., 2009;García, 2011). These can promote the proliferation of ARB in these effluents and, hence, a potential risk for human health. Table 1 summarizes the most relevant disinfection technologies for different water matrices during the last two years (2019 and 2020). Many technologies have been developed for pathogen disinfection in water matrices, including conventional, advanced oxidation and electrochemical advanced oxidation processes. Conventional technologies such as filtration, adsorption, coagulation, or precipitation are mainly applied at full scale for the removal of suspended solid, dissolved organic and inorganic contaminants, metals and ionic species, etc. (Luo et al., 2014). However, novelty research has been attempted to improve the antibacterial capabilities of these conventional processes. Hence, conventional processes could be considered as a suitable alternative for water disinfection because of their low cost and easy application. These physical-chemical technologies are mainly based on the separation of microorganisms from polluted water (Bhatnagar and Sillanpää, 2017). Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2020c) evaluated the removal of S. aureus in water by filtration using a modified filter-paper-based material. They developed a tannic acid crosslinked gelatine polymer network with an oxidized cellulose filter paper (OFP-GEL-TA) for bacteria removal. As a natural antibacterial agent, the cross-linker TA endowed the prepared OFP-GEL-TA with favourable antibacterial property. Disinfection efficiencies reached 99.00% and decreased up to 98.00% after five cycles. Additionally, the adsorption performance of a magnetic graphene oxide (MGO) was evaluated against microbial activity of E. coli, Yersinia ruckeri (Y. ruckeri) and Enterobacter agglomerans (E. agglomerans) by Ain et al. (Ain et al., 2020). Results showed that with the addition of 0.5, 0.5 and 0.45 mg mL -1 of MGO to water containing E. coli, Y. ruckeri and E. agglomerans, respectively, the maximum percentages of relative effectiveness were 98.79, 97.15 and 97.69% in comparison with a control system (commercially available disinfectant).Natural waters include rivers, lakes, rainwater or groundwater which naturally contain large amounts of inorganic ions and organic matter, although its composition can be altered by agricultural, domestic and industrial activities (Rommozzi et al., 2020).

        <p>Coagulation processes have been also tested for water disinfection. These technologies consist of adding a coagulant species to the water to be treated, which can be a chemical or natural compound. Iron and aluminium based inorganic salts are typically used as chemical coagulants. However, these metal species can promote the occurrence of coagulant traces as toxic by-products dissolved in treated effluents (Dalvand et al., 2016;Gassenschmidt et al., 1995). This can be avoided by using natural coagulants, since these compounds are highly biodegradable (Freitas et al., 2015). Nonetheless, the main drawback of coagulation processes is the generation of a final sludge that should be treated later. Patchaiyappan et al. (Patchaiyappan et al., 2020) tested Total Total Total Total (Ni et al., 2020c) Electrochemical Oxidation an indigenous natural coagulant Strychnos potatorum (S. potatorum) for the disinfection of synthetic waters with high levels of turbidity. S. potatorum is a deciduous tree known as clearing-nut tree, commonly used in traditional medicine and water purification in some regions of South Asia. They concluded that an optimum coagulant dosage within the range 0.2 -1 mg L -1 reduced 3.3 -4.3 logs of E. coli. On the other hand, the bactericidal properties of a green and low-priced magnetic biochar/quaternary phosphonium salt (MBQ) were tested by Fu et al. (2020). Quaternary phosphonium salts are able to reach high disinfection efficiencies working in a wide range of pH (2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12), thus, they are presented as a new generation of cationic biocides (Cai et al., 2011). Specifically, the use of 20 mg L -1 of MBQ-3 (with a mass ratio of magnetic biochar and quaternary phosphonium salt of 1:30) reduced the population of E. coli in 3.05 logs and achieved the complete removal of 10 6 CFU/ mL of S. aureus. Microorganisms were captured by the electrostatic force of the cationic surfactant on the surface of MBQ and nanoparticles penetrating the cell wall and membrane into the cytoplasm may be responsible for the irreversible cell damage.Coagulation processes have been also tested for water disinfection.

        <p>Other conventional processes based on the addition of chemical disinfectants or the irradiation of UV light have also been recently studied by Stange et al. for water disinfection to attain the abatement of ARB and ARGs (Stange et al., 2019). They compared ARB (E. coli and E. faecalis) and ARGs removal during three different processes: chlorination, ozonation and UV light irradiance. The chlorination process using 0.25 mg L -1 of free chlorine (30 min contact time) resulted in a reduction of 5.1 and 2.9 logs of E. coli and E. faecalis, respectively. Likewise, ARGs were decrease by only 0.4 (ampC), 0.5 (tet(A)), 0.9 (ermB) and 0.8 (vanA) log. Higher free chlorine concentrations of 1.03 mg L -1 leads to remove ARGs up to their limit of detection for ampC and tet(A) and around 3 logs for ermB and vanA. Otherwise, the ozonation process using about 1 mg L -1 of O 3 (5 min contact time) achieved a reduction of 5 logs for E. coli and E. faecalis, and higher than 4.3 logs for the 4 ARGs tested without reaching a totally removal of ARGs. Finally, the irradiation of a UV dosage of 100 J m -2 showed an inactivation of 2.5 log of E. coli and 4.2 log of E. faecalis, without noticeable changes for the removal of any ARGs.Other conventional processes based on the addition of chemical disinfectants or the irradiation of UV light have also been recently studied by Stange et al. for water disinfection to attain the abatement of ARB and ARGs (Stange et al., 2019).

        <p>Physical-chemical processes allow to reduce the population of microorganisms in natural water by using low-cost materials. However, the main drawback of these conventional technologies is that they do not kill pathogens but are retained in filters, adsorbents or coagulants and, hence, a complete disinfection can be limited. To overcome this issue, other technologies such as Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have been studied for water disinfection over the last years. AOPs can be defined as oxidation technologies based on the production of large amounts of highly reactive species which are directly involved in the destruction of target pollutants. Specifically, the generation of hydroxyl radical (•OH) is mainly promoted during AOPs because it is a powerful oxidant (E 0 : 2.86 V) able to non-selectively attack the recalcitrant organic compounds and microorganisms present in different effluents.Physical-chemical processes allow to reduce the population of microorganisms in natural water by using low-cost materials.

        <p>Depending on the mechanism for hydroxyl radical generation, AOPs can be classified in two major groups (Fig. 2): homogeneous and heterogeneous AOPs. These AOPs can be also divided in two different groups based on the energy requirements or the irradiation of UV light, respectively. The production of hydroxyl radicals takes place from chemicals completely dissolved in the effluents during homogeneous AOPs whereas a solid catalyst is commonly required for generating these radicals in heterogeneous AOPs.Depending on the mechanism for hydroxyl radical generation, AOPs can be classified in two major groups (Fig. 2): homogeneous and heterogeneous AOPs.

        <p>Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) is a powerful oxidant (E 0 : 1.78 V) which can be used for disinfection purposes. It is considered as a clean compound since H 2 O 2 is usually decomposed in oxygen and water, avoiding the generation of by-products. The bactericidal effect of this species can be limited depending on the initial concentration (Ölmez and Kretzschmar, 2009). For this reason, the activation of H 2 O 2 with other oxidants or catalysts to improve the processes efficiencies has been reported in literature (Diao et al., 2004;Liu et al., 2018;Yang et al., 2012). The combined effect of H 2 O 2 and ozone (O 3 ) promotes the generation of large amounts of hydroxyl radicals (Eq. ( 1)) (Duguet et al., 1985;Von Gunten, 2003). This process (H 2 O 2 / O 3 ) has been investigated for the disinfection of water and wastewater (Nahim-Granados et al., 2020).Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) is a powerful oxidant (E 0 : 1.78 V) which can be used for disinfection purposes.

        <p>Nonetheless, Fenton oxidation (H 2 O 2 /Fe 2+ ) is the most widely investigated technology for water treatment (Huston and Pignatello, 1999;Kiwi et al., 1994;Neyens and Baeyens, 2003). It is based on the production of large amounts of hydroxyl radicals from the activation of hydrogen peroxide by using ferrous iron (Fe 2+ ) as catalyst (Eq. ( 2)) which, in turn, can be continuously regenerated during the process (Eqs. ( 3)-( 4)) (Thomas et al., 2021).Nonetheless, Fenton oxidation (H 2 O 2 /Fe 2+ ) is the most widely investigated technology for water treatment (Huston and Pignatello, 1999;Kiwi et al., 1994;Neyens and Baeyens, 2003).

        <p>The ratio of reagents employed (H 2 O 2 :Fe 2+ ) in the Fenton's reaction significantly influences the process performance (Neyens and Baeyens, 2003). Likewise, another important operational parameter is pH since it is necessary to operate under acidic conditions to ensure the dissolution of catalyst. pH values around 3 usually leads to better performances during the Fenton process (Arnold et al., 1995). These operating conditions can limit the applicability of this technology because a subsequent neutralization step is required before discharging the treated effluents that increases the operational costs. For this reason, the use of solid catalysts can be considered as an excellent alternative for carrying out the Fenton process at a wide pH range (heterogeneous Fenton). This also allows to easily separate the catalyst from treated water after disinfection (Pignatello et al., 2006). The development of novel catalysts for improving disinfection efficiencies has become a hot research topic in the last years. Gu et al. (2020) tested the antibacterial capability of CuFe 2 O 4 nanomaterial enhanced with hydroxylamine (NH 2 OH) in a Fenton- like process (Fig. 3). In a first step, NH 2 OH acts as a reducing agent that promotes the generation of Cu(I) (Eq. ( 5)). Then, Cu(I) reacts with hydrogen peroxide, previously generated from the reaction between NH 2 OH and O 2 (Eq. ( 6)), promoting the generation of hydroxyl radicals (Eq. ( 7)) (Kim et al., 2015). Cu(I) also showed a higher binding affinity to proteins of cell membrane, favouring their reduction and, hence, the killing of microorganisms. Specifically, the process achieved a 2.71 log reduction of E. coli.The ratio of reagents employed (H 2 O 2 :Fe 2+ ) in the Fenton's reaction significantly influences the process performance (Neyens and Baeyens, 2003).

        <p>Fenton oxidation process can also be enhanced by coupling ultraviolet (UV) irradiation (photo-Fenton). This promotes the massive production of hydroxyl radicals not only by the Fenton reaction (Eq. ( 2)) but also by the irradiation of UVA light (315 &lt; λ &lt; 400) over an iron complex (Fe(HO) 2+ ) previously formed during the process (Eq. ( 8)) (Pignatello et al., 2006). Thus, it is possible to regenerate the iron catalyst used during photo-Fenton, minimizing the waste production. This fact can also be achieved during single Fenton process (Eqs. ( 3)-( 4)), although the regeneration rate is lower (Malato et al., 2009). In addition, the irradiation of UVC light (200 &lt; λ &lt; 280) improves the production of hydroxyl radicals in the effluent because it photoactivates both iron (Eq. ( 8)) and hydrogen peroxide (Eq. ( 9)) (Zaviska et al., 2009). Rubio et al. (2013) reported the applicability of photo-Fenton process with UVC light for the removal of 10 6 CFU mL -1 of E. coli in different water matrices (milli-q water, lake water and seawater).

        <p>The irradiation of UV light during Fenton process can significantly increase the treatment costs, which can be avoided by using solar light (λ &gt; 300 nm) as renewable energy-saving alternative. The investigation of solar photo-Fenton process for the disinfection of water contaminated with E. coli was reported by Spuhler et al. (2010). They evaluated a solar simulator to irradiate an effluent containing 0.6 mg L -1 Fe 2+ and 10 mg L -1 H 2 O 2 , achieving the complete disinfection (6-log reduction). The presence of ions in polluted water can affect the effectiveness of photo-Fenton. Rommozzi et al. tested the interaction of HCO 3 -, NO 3 -, NO 2 -, Cl -, SO 4 2-and NH 4 + during the E. coli inactivation by photo-Fenton (Rommozzi et al., 2020). They concluded that the disinfection can be enhanced by the presence of ions because of the generation of free radicals. For instance, the addition of 10 mg L -1 of HCO 3 -promoted the complete removal of E. coli in shorter times than those observed without the presence of HCO 3 -during photo-Fenton process. This was mainly attributed to the contribution of carbonate radicals generated from the reaction between carbonate ions and hydroxyl radicals (Eqs.

        <p>To overcome the pH limitations of the Fenton process, the use of iron and copper chelates for water and wastewater disinfection at near neutral pH values has been recently reported (Ahile et al., 2021;Clarizia et al., 2017;Nahim-Granados et al., 2019). The most commonly studied chelating agents are aminopolicarboxylic acids such as EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) or EDDS (Ethylenediamine-N,N'-disuccinic acid), citric or oxalic acids (Giannakis et al., 2016a). These compounds can generate Fe 2+ rather than other iron complexes and have molar absorption coefficients in the UV-vis region, allowing the solar photo-Fenton like process to operate under neutral pH conditions (Perini et al., 2018). This technology has been investigated by Ahmed et al., which employed a modified photo-Fenton process using EDDS to chelate Fe(III) for the simultaneous removal of ARB, ARGs and micropollutants. Results showed that the concentration of ARB, extracellular ARGs and micropollutants decreased to the limit of detection after 30, 15 and 10 min, respectively, when working in ultra-pure water (Ahmed et al., 2021).To overcome the pH limitations of the Fenton process, the use of iron and copper chelates for water and wastewater disinfection at near neutral pH values has been recently reported (Ahile et al., 2021;Clarizia et al., 2017;Nahim-Granados et al., 2019).

        <p>On the other hand, in the last decades the heterogeneous photocatalytic processes have emerged as an interesting alternative for water disinfection. These AOPs are based on the production of reactive oxidizing species (ROS) by the irradiation of a UV light power source on a semiconductor material (Bossmann et al., 2001;Feng et al., 2006;Fernandez et al., 1998;Puma and Yue, 2000). Energy from UV light greater than the band gap of the semiconductor excites an electron from the valence band to the conduction band, generating a positive hole in the valence band. These positive holes can oxidize OH -or H 2 O at the surface of the semiconductor material leading to the production of ROS. Specifically, hydrogen peroxide, ozone and hydroxyl radicals can be generated during the heterogeneous photocatalytic processes. These ROS significantly contribute to killing microorganisms and, hence, increase the disinfection efficiencies (Hoffman et al., 1994;Pelaez et al., 2012).

The positive doping effect of Ag on the disinfection process have been tested by Yu et al. (2019). In this work, they used a AgBr-modified g-C 3 N 4 composite for enhancing visible-light-driven photocatalytic disinfection. Removal rates of E. coli were improved from 0.6 to 3.68 log CFUs reduction for a molar ratio of 1 AgBr to g-C 3 N 4 . The photocatalytic disinfection efficiency of Ag increased to 4.8 log CFUs reduction for a molar ratio of 5, but it decreased to 3.04 log CFUs reduction by increasing the molar ratio to 20.

(2020) compares the disinfection efficiencies of a metal-free photocatalytic process based on a versatile semiconductor (C 3 N 4 ) for killing E. coli and E. faecalis as models of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, respectively. They modified C 3 N 4 nanosheets with polyethyleneimine (PEI) to improve its disinfection capabilities. Results showed the gradual destruction of cell membranes and leakage of interior components by the generated ROS. The damage to the cell structures of E. coli was worse than those of E. faecalis cells, and this was attributed to the thicker peptidoglycan layer in the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria.</p>
        <p>The Glow Plasma Discharge (GPD) process can be considered as a kind of AOPs and it has also been studied for the removal of ARB and ARGs. The GPD process is able to generate plasma between an anode tip and a water surface by the strong electric field generated, promoting the formation of disinfectant species such as hydroxyl or chlorine radicals (Motyka et al., 2018;Polyakov et al., 2004). Yang et al. studied the removal of E. coli by applying a DC voltage of 500 V and a current intensity of 100 mA into the anode platinum wire. The inactivation of E. coli was estimated by following the concentration of the 16S rRNA, which showed a decrease close to the detection limit of 4.7 logs after a discharge time of 15 min. Additionally, the reduction of tetA, tetR, aphA and tnpA genes was 5.8, 5.4, 5.3 and 5.5 logs with 30 min discharge treatment, respectively (Yang et al., 2020). These results highlighted the potential capacity of the GDP process to reduce the risk of gene transfer.The Glow Plasma Discharge (GPD) process can be considered as a kind of AOPs and it has also been studied for the removal of ARB and ARGs.

        <p>Other AOPs applied to water disinfection are technologies based on electrochemistry which are commonly known as electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) (Diao et al., 2004;Griessler et al., 2011). EAOPs are processes in which a direct current electric field is applied across the contaminated effluent, promoting the generation of large amounts of highly reactive species that destroy chemical and biological pollutants. There are different EAOPs that can be applied to water disinfection: electro-Fenton (EF), photoelectron-Fenton (PEF), sonoelectrochemistry (SE) or electrochemical oxidation (EO) (Sirés et al., 2014). These technologies can proceed without the need for chemicals storage as occur in methods such as chlorination, ozonation or Fenton process, reducing associated operating costs (Ghernaout and Ghernaout, 2010;Sirés and Brillas, 2012b). During EO, ions naturally contained in the untreated effluents are oxidized or reduced on the anode or cathode surface, respectively. By these mechanisms, different disinfectants can be electrogenerated such as ozone, hypochlorite, chloramines or hydrogen peroxide. Likewise, other powerful oxidizing species like hydroxyl, sulphate, carbonate or chlorine radicals can be also generated, favouring the killing of microorganisms during disinfection processes. EAOPs provide several advantages for the disinfection of contaminated sources because the electron is a clean reagent, and the process efficiencies are very high (Panizza and Cerisola, 2009;Rodrigo et al., 2014;Sirés and Brillas, 2012a;Sirés et al., 2014). For this reason, they are considered environmentally friendly processes.Other AOPs applied to water disinfection are technologies based on electrochemistry which are commonly known as electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) (Diao et al., 2004;Griessler et al., 2011).

        <p>EO process is strongly influenced by the electrode material used and the applied current density. Electrode materials such as carbon fiber felt (CFF), boron doped diamond (BDD), or mixed metal oxides (MMO) are commonly used for water disinfection process (Cotillas et al., 2013;Cotillas et al., 2016;Jeong et al., 2009;Jeong et al., 2006;Liu et al., 2019;Mascia et al., 2012;Ni et al., 2020b). Many authors have tested the viability of EO as disinfection process, obtaining total bacteria removal rates in water matrices with the application of low current densities and electric charges. Ni et al. (2020c) tested the disinfection performance of a carbon fiber-based flow through electrode system towards gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens (Fig. 5). Results showed that the complete removal of different bacteria was attained at low applied voltages (1-5 V) and short HRTs (1-10s). Gram-positive bacteria (E. faecalis and Bacillus subtilis) were less vulnerable to the disinfection process than gram-negative bacteria (E. coli and faecal coliform), which may be associated to the different composition of cell walls (peptidoglycan and teichoic acids). Furthermore, authors stablished the direct oxidation as main disinfection mechanism since the indirect oxidation was negligible at low voltages.EO process is strongly influenced by the electrode material used and the applied current density.

        <p>Other authors have studied the applicability of nanowires electrodes for low-voltage electroporation disinfection process (Huo et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2020b). These nanowire structures have a nanoscale tip structure that can amplify the strength of the electric field near the tips by several orders of magnitude (Rojas-Chapana et al., 2004), leading to the complete removal of pathogens. In the electroporation process, it is induced a damage in the cell membrane resulting in cell death when is exposed to an electric field of strength enough (Shahini and Yeow, 2013). Conversely, different electrode materials and electrochemical reactors have been also proven efficient in the disinfection of water matrices. In the work reported by Isidro et al.

        <p>EO can also be coupled with photolysis to enhance the photo-electro generation of disinfectant species and, hence, to obtain a more efficient process with a lower cost. The irradiation can be applied naturally (solar irradiation) or artificially (UV lamp). Thus, the photoactivation of the electrochemical generated reactive species such as hydrogen peroxide, ozone, persulfate or hypochlorite leads to the enhancement of the generation of hydroxyl, sulphate or chlorine radicals (Chan et al., 2012;Pelegrini et al., 2000;Shih et al., 2012). Specifically, photoelectrochemical technology has been recently proven to be efficient in the disinfection of water sources contaminated with E. coli (Cho et al., 2019;Jin et al., 2020). Another interesting work has been published by Montenegro-Ayo et al. (2020). They designed a portable point-of-use photo-electrocatalytic device (e-DRINK) for rapid water disinfection. This device was composed of TiO 2 nanotubes acting as photo-anodes and a rechargeable battery to provide the power supply. This technology was able to reach 5-log inactivation of E. coli in just 10 s in sterile saline solution and in 4 min in a natural water matrix. The different disinfection behaviours were attributed to the hindrance of light transport in the presence of natural water components. The e-DRINK device provides an amazing opportunity to achieve access to safe drinking water in isolated areas and developing regions.EO can also be coupled with photolysis to enhance the photo-electro generation of disinfectant species and, hence, to obtain a more efficient process with a lower cost.

This allowed to increase the generation of hydroxyl radicals, promoting an improvement in the E. coli removal rate. Results showed that the process could non-selectively inactivate the antibiotic-resistant E. coli with different ARGs in a 300 min treatment. ARGs present in the bacterial strain such as, ampicillin-, tetracycline-, or chloramphenicolresistance genes, among others, were also completely removed after the treatment. The great cost-effectiveness ratio of GAC cathodes renders this electro-Fenton process as an affordable alternative for practical applications.Chen et al.

        <p>Wastewater is a very complex matrix of different organic and inorganic compounds which can be toxic and difficult to degrade. The wide range of wastewater sources consists of urban and industrial streams. Urban wastewater is generated from households, recreational areas, sanitary facilities, and all other sources that end up being mixed with these effluents. The composition of industrial wastewater depends on the type of industrial activity and, the number of different pollutants such as heavy metals, pharmaceutical products, dyes, toxic compounds derived from chlorine, nitrogen, phosphorus or sulphur… is practically endless (Yuksek et al., 2016). The solid fraction of wastewater is generally made of a high percentage of volatile matter and medium to low content in fixed carbon, depending on the mineral content of the feedstock (Azzaz et al., 2020;Gai et al., 2016;Lin et al., 2016;Lucian et al., 2018;Reza et al., 2016). Inorganic compounds found in wastewater are mainly fluorides, chlorides, sulphates, nitrates phosphates or ammonium, among others.Wastewater is a very complex matrix of different organic and inorganic compounds which can be toxic and difficult to degrade.

A wide variety of processes have been tested in the last years for this purpose and the most significant disinfection technologies for different wastewater matrices during the years 2018-2020 are summarized in Table 2. Conventional technologies may represent a suitable alternative for practical applications, due to the large volumes of wastewater that need to be treated every day (Cornel and Krause, 2006).

The use of an innovative SBBGR was evaluated for the disinfection of sewage to be reuse for irrigation by De Sanctis et al. ( 2020). This process achieved average log reductions of 2.9 and 1.6 for E. coli and Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens), respectively. Nonetheless, a subsequent sand filtration stage was also required to improve the disinfection performance and to guarantee the quality of the treated effluent within the standards that reclaimed water must satisfy to be reused in agricultural activities in several countries.The use of sequencing batch biofilter granular reactors (SBBGRs) has been tested for wastewater disinfection.

        <p>On the other hand, wetlands are low operational and maintenance cost systems for wastewater disinfection. This technology combines different processes such as filtration, sedimentation, oxidation, oxygen release, production of bacteriological compounds, retention in biofilms, aggregation or competition for limiting nutrients which promote the removal of ARB (Sharma et al., 2016). Constructed wetlands (CWs) are semi-aquatic ecosystems with a large population of microorganisms and vegetation that proliferate in the environment, promoting physical-chemical reactions able to degrade contaminants (Liu et al., 2014). Kaliakatsos et al. (2019) tested the application of a CW system for wastewater disinfection, finding that the process was able to remove around 99% of the bacteria present in wastewater (2-log reduction) in 14 days. Another interesting approach of wetlands for disinfection purposes was proposed by González et al. (2020), who combined a wetland system with the irradiation of UV light. The coupling of both technologies improved the disinfection efficiencies of the constructed wetland up to 2.03-log reduction of faecal coliforms in 3-7 days. However, bacteria regrowth was observed around 27.8% under visible UV light irradiation which represents an important drawback of the technology. This behavior has been previously reported in literature where it has been checked that the damage caused on bacteria by UV light irradiation can be repaired after relative small times, promoting bacteria regrowth (Hijnen et al., 2006;Wen et al., 2019).On the other hand, wetlands are low operational and maintenance cost systems for wastewater disinfection.

        <p>However, the energy requirements for the implementation of light irradiation systems can also limit the applicability of these technologies due to the energy costs. To overcome this limitation, the use of solar light irradiation has become an excellent alternative for wastewater disinfection. It is a well-known and broadly used technology which Total (Rajasekhar et al., 2020) Electrodisinfection-electrocoagulation 5A m -2 (0.1kAhm -3 ) -1.6 mmol L -1 Fe dissolved 78.5 cm -2 BDD anode -SS cathode -50 L h -1 Cotillas et al., 2020) consists in the direct application of solar light to wastewater, although the inactivation process is complex because it depends on both exogenous and endogenous microbial inactivation pathways (Berney et al., 2006;Kohn and Nelson, 2007;Mattle et al., 2015). Solar disinfection has been recently studied for wastewater treatment by Voumard et al. (2019). They reported that the irradiation of solar light led to an E. coli removal percentage of 99.99% (4-log reduction) in 1.7 h. This study also highlighted the possible risks for human health related to an incomplete killing of microorganisms. One of the novel approaches for reducing ARB in wastewaters is the use of metal-exchanged natural zeolites. Zeolites are natural aluminosilicate minerals that show a high cation-exchange affinity, yielding materials with antibacterial properties. Ivankovic et al.

        <p>The main drawbacks of most of conventional treatments for killing pathogens in wastewater are the low efficiencies and the limitations in achieving the complete disinfection of the effluents, which can lead to bacterial regrowth and the proliferation of ARB into the environment. To overcome these limitations, the application of AOPs for wastewater disinfection has been widely studied in the last decades since these processes promote the generation of large amounts of free radicals that favour the removal of microorganisms (Malato et al., 2009;Zhang et al., 2010b). Homogeneous AOPs based on the generation of hydroxyl or sulfate radicals are promising technologies due to the strong oxidative power of these species. Xiao et al. (2020) tested the use of a zerovalent iron/peroxydisulfate (ZVI/PS) process for wastewater disinfection. In an air-saturated PS solution, ZVI was oxidized to generate Fe 2+ (Eqs. ( 17)-( 19)) and, consequently, Fe 2+ activated PS to form sulfate radicals (SO 4The main drawbacks of most of conventional treatments for killing pathogens in wastewater are the low efficiencies and the limitations in achieving the complete disinfection of the effluents, which can lead to bacterial regrowth and the proliferation of ARB into the environment.

        <p>Likewise, the removal of ARGs in a secondary effluent was studied by Gao et al., using sodium persulfate activated by a nanoscale zero valent iron modified by Ginkgo biloba L. (G-NZVI) catalyst (Gao et al., 2020). They selected bacterial 16S rRNA gene, eight ARGs and two mobile genetic elements as target pollutants. Four resistance mechanisms were present among the ARGs selected, including efflux (tetE and mexF), deactivate (bla TEM , catA1 and aac), protection (tetW and vanG) and unknown (qnrS). Class 1 integron-integrase gene (intI1) and the conjugative transposon Tn916-Tn1545 family (Tn916/1545) were selected as mobile genetic elements. Results showed that 98.6% (1.85 log) bacterial 16S rRNA gene was removed within 10 min and the removal efficiency of target ARGs and other mobile genetic elements decreased in the following order: Tn916/1545 = aac (below the detection limit) &gt; intI1 (99.99%) &gt; tetE (99.64%) &gt; mexF (99.10%) &gt; tetW (94.57%) &gt; qnrS (90.18%) &gt; vanG (82.21%) &gt; bla TEM (64.15%) &gt; catA1 (23.13%).Likewise, the removal of ARGs in a secondary effluent was studied by Gao et al., using sodium persulfate activated by a nanoscale zero valent iron modified by Ginkgo biloba L.

        <p>Another homogeneous AOP that has been recently tested for the removal of E. coli and Pseudomonas spp in wastewater is catalytic ozonation (Malvestiti et al., 2019). This technology can also be considered as heterogeneous AOP if metals are added as dispersed solid oxides. Malvestiti et al. studied different metal ions (Fe 2+ , Co 2+ and Al 3+ ) to enhance the generation of powerful radicals with disinfectant capacity in a metal-catalyse ozonation process. The generation of hydroxyl radicals was promoted during the decomposition of O 3 in the presence of Fe 2+ (Eqs. ( 21)-( 22)) (Arslan et al., 2000). In addition, the interaction of ozone and water is well known to produce hydrogen peroxide (Eq. ( 23)) (Rodríguez et al., 2008), which, subsequently can react with Fe 2+ in the Fenton process (Eqs. ( 3)-( 4)) to generate hydroxyl radicals.Another homogeneous AOP that has been recently tested for the removal of E. coli and Pseudomonas spp in wastewater is catalytic ozonation (Malvestiti et al., 2019).

Cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was measured as an indirect indicator for disinfection.

        <p>Within homogeneous photocatalytic AOPs, the PF process is one of the most developed technologies for disinfection and decontamination of wastewater matrices. Many studies have reported the application of PF with UV or solar irradiation for the inactivation of waterborne pathogens including E. coli, S. enteritidis, faecal coliforms or P. aeruginosa (de la Obra et al., 2020;Michael et al., 2019;Nahim-Granados et al., 2018;Soriano-Molina et al., 2019). The efficiency of the PF process for the complete removal of ARB in wastewater matrices was successfully proven in these works. Nahim-Granados et al. (Nahim-Granados et al., 2018) studied the inactivation of E. coli and S. enteritidis in synthetic fresh-cut wastewater by different solar based processes at pH values around 6. Results showed that PF was able to reach the complete removal of both microorganisms in less than 30 min, using 2.5 mg L -1 Fe 2+ and 5 mg L -1 H 2 O 2 . A similar disinfection behavior was observed during the single solar photo-inactivation and, the best disinfection rates were obtained during the H 2 O 2 /Solar UV process. This was attributed to the limitations of the PF process when working at neutral pHs. Michael et al. (2019) tested the solar PF process for the removal of ARB and ARGs from wastewater. The use of 5 mg L -1 Fe 2+ and H 2 O 2 doses of 18, 30, 40 and 18 mg L -1 under solar light irradiation promoted the inactivation of faecal coliforms, Enterococcus spp., total heterotrophs and P. aeruginosa, respectively, avoiding undesirable bacteria regrowth. ARGs showed different performances and, their complete elimination was not achieved during the process. For instance, bla TEM genes, whose resistance is associated to β-lactamases, were persistent after treatment. Di Cesare et al. studied the removal of antibiotic resistance determinants (16S rRNA, ARGs and intI1 gene) and pathogenic bacteria by a photo-Fenton like process (UV-C/H 2 O 2 /Cu-IDS) using an iminodisuccinic acid (IDS-Cu) complex as catalyst (Di Cesare et al., 2020b). Results showed that the UV-C/H 2 O 2 /Cu-IDS process working under neutral pH conditions was more effective than the UV-C/H 2 O 2 process in terms of bacterial removal. This was mainly attributed to the reaction of Cu + and Cu 2+ with H 2 O 2 and the subsequent generation of hydroxyl radicals (Giannakis et al., 2016b). However, the UV-C/H 2 O 2 process was more effective in decreasing the relative abundance of intI1 and tetA genes after a 24 h storage in human pathogens favourable conditions (37 °C in rich medium, LB broth), which highlights the need of further investigation of the UV-C/H 2 O 2 /Cu-IDS process under more intensive operational conditions.Within homogeneous photocatalytic AOPs, the PF process is one of the most developed technologies for disinfection and decontamination of wastewater matrices.

        <p>The irradiation of UV light to solutions containing powerful oxidants such as H 2 O 2 , HSO 5 -, S 2 O 8 2-or ClO -promotes their photoactivation, favouring the generation of free radicals (Eqs. ( 9), ( 14), ( 15), ( 27)) (Fang et al., 2014). The role of these radicals in the disinfection of wastewater matrices has been reported in literature which significantly influence the inactivation of microorganisms, reaching a complete removal of ARB models such as E. coli, E. faecalis or K. pneumoniae (Arslan-Alaton et al., 2020;Ferreira et al., 2020;Kim et al., 2020;Rodríguez-Chueca et al., 2019b;Serna-Galvis et al., 2020).The irradiation of UV light to solutions containing powerful oxidants such as H 2 O 2 , HSO 5 -, S 2 O 8 2-or ClO -promotes their photoactivation, favouring the generation of free radicals (Eqs.

        <p>The Other studies have proposed the irradiation of UV-A light to favour the generation of radicals during disinfection processes, although the removal rates are lower than that obtained when using UV-C light. Rodríguez-Chueca et al. (2019b) reported the inactivation of E. coli under UV-A irradiation and its combination with S 2 O 8 2-and HSO 5 -to promote the generation of ROS. Results showed that a negligible disinfection was achieved by single photolysis with UV-A light. However, the photoactivation of 1 mM S 2 O 8 2-led to the total inactivation of E. coli in 30 min whereas a decrease around 2.2-Log was achieved during a 90 min treatment with 1 mM HSO 5 -. These different behaviours were explained by the different production of radicals: hydroxyl and sulphate radicals were generated during the photolysis of HSO 5 -(Eq. ( 14)) but large amounts of sulphate radicals were produced during the photoactivation of S 2 O 8 2 (Eq. ( 15)). Heterogeneous AOPs are based on the use of a solid catalyst to promote the generation of free radicals in wastewater. Solid semiconductor materials can be photoactivated by the irradiation of UV light, promoting the generation of ROS in wastewater that favour the killing of microorganisms (Cho et al., 2004;Foster et al., 2011). These heterogeneous photocatalytic processes have been widely studied for the disinfection of wastewater sources in literature (Choi et al., 2007;Rincón and Pulgarin, 2003;Rincón and Pulgarin, 2004;Watts et al., 1995). Three different TiO 2 based materials were tested by Martín-Sómer et al. (2019) for the removal of total aerobic bacteria in a real wastewater effluent. The higher disinfection rates were obtained with the use of commercial TiO 2 Evonik P25 as photocatalyst, reaching around 3.6-log reduction when 3.8 E/L of accumulated radiant energy were applied. The use of other TiO 2 based materials led to less than 2-log reduction units of total anaerobic bacteria. The development of other photocatalysts non-based on TiO 2 have been also carried out for wastewater disinfection. A novel cerium-doped zinc oxide (Ce-ZnO) photocatalyst was compared with the commercial TiO 2 -P25 for the disinfection of real wastewater by Zammit et al. (2019). The concentration of E. coli was completely inactivated and P. aeruginosa was reduced in more than 4log units with Ce-ZnO photocatalyst in 180 min. Results obtained for both microorganisms with this novel material were more than 2-log units higher than those achieved when using commercial TiO 2 -P25.The Other studies have proposed the irradiation of UV-A light to favour the generation of radicals during disinfection processes, although the removal rates are lower than that obtained when using UV-C light.

        <p>As discussed in Section 2.1, EAOPs are a promising alternative for improving the disinfection efficiencies of AOPs. Specifically, EO is one of the most widespread technologies employed for wastewater treatment. During EO, oxidation and reduction reactions take place on the anode and cathode surface, respectively. The high concentration of inorganic ions contained in wastewater leads to the generation of disinfectant species such as hypochlorite (Eqs.

( 35)-( 36)) (Chu et al., 2012;Dhaouadi et al., 2009) that significantly contribute to bacteria removal (Cotillas et al., 2018;Cotillas et al., 2013).As discussed in Section 2.1, EAOPs are a promising alternative for improving the disinfection efficiencies of AOPs.

        <p>The presence of organic compounds in wastewater may affect the efficiency of the electrochemical disinfection process since the disinfectant species generated can degrade these organic compounds, promoting competitive oxidative reactions between bacteria and organics (Herraiz-Carboné et al., 2020). The EO process is significantly influenced by the anodic material employed and the current density (Chen, 2004). Several materials may be suitable as anodes but BDD and MMO are more extensively used for wastewater disinfection processes (Cruz-Díaz et al., 2018;Jeong et al., 2006). Li et al. (2020a) tested the electrochemical disinfection with BDD anodes for the removal of heterotrophic bacteria. The application of 20 mA cm -2 led to a 3.8-log reduction of bacteria, reaching almost the complete disinfection of the effluent. This process was also able to reduce the relative abundance of ARGs, which was mainly attributed to the different amounts of free chlorine and hydroxyl radicals generated. They studied the removal efficiency of 23 ARGs that confer resistance to 8 classes of antibiotics with different operational conditions. Results showed a total removal rate of ARGs of 56% after 5 min at a current density of 80 mA cm -2 , meanwhile the total removal rate of ARGs decreases below 47% after 20 min at a current density of 20 mA cm -2 , when 99% inactivation was achieved by both treatments.The presence of organic compounds in wastewater may affect the efficiency of the electrochemical disinfection process since the disinfectant species generated can degrade these organic compounds, promoting competitive oxidative reactions between bacteria and organics (Herraiz-Carboné et al., 2020).

        <p>In last years, concern about HWW treatment has sharply increased in the scientific community due to the complex composition of this type of effluents, including a great variety of drugs and high concentrations of pathogens, viruses, and fungi. HWW greatly affect the loads of contaminants arriving to WWTPs since contain high levels of chemical Total Total (Singla et al., 2020) and biological residues (Santos et al., 2013;Verlicchi et al., 2013;Verlicchi et al., 2010a). ARB are easily spread among hospitalized patients via air, shower drains and/or the sewage systems as bacteria reservoirs, promoting the occurrence of nosocomial infections (Aslam et al., 2018;Hopman et al., 2019). This has led to the search for technological solutions to decrease the impact of HWW into the environment and human health. A review related to disinfection/denaturation treatments reported by Dodd (2012) stated that undamaged DNA residues from cellular debris could confer antibiotic resistance to bacterial populations present in the environment by natural transformation and/or transduction, despite ARB were inactivated during the disinfection process. Furthermore, dead bacteria can have intact plasmids which are capable of replicating autonomously within a suitable host (So et al., 2012). The particular composition of HWW, in terms of pathogens, promotes a rapid vertical and/or horizontal gene transfer. For this reason, disinfection technologies should assure not only the complete removal of microorganisms but also the denaturation of genetic material. Table 3 summarizes the most significant disinfection technologies for HWW reported in literature until 2020.In last years, concern about HWW treatment has sharply increased in the scientific community due to the complex composition of this type of effluents, including a great variety of drugs and high concentrations of pathogens, viruses, and fungi.

Disinfection rates achieved a maximum of 3.69-log reduction in total coliforms with a 35-day sludge age. The main advantages of MBRs are the lower carbon footprint and the higher ARB removal efficiencies than those obtained with conventional biological processes located at WWTPs. On the other hand, chemical processes are based on the use of ozone or chlorine for killing pathogens because of their excellent disinfectant properties. Gautam et al. (2007) and Fijan and Turk (2014) evaluated the disinfection of HWW with chlorine and peracetic acid (PA), respectively. The use of 20 mg L -1 Ca(ClO) 2 achieved disinfection percentages up to 98.5% in 30 min whereas the addition of 400 mg L -1 PA led to the complete removal of E. faecium in 15 min. These results point out the bactericidal effect of chlorine and PA for the removal of ARB in HWW. Furthermore, the monitorization of ARGs was studied in three different Hospital WasteWater Treatment Plants (HWWTPs), operating with several physical-chemical processes and a final disinfection stage based on chlorination. Results showed that ARGs removal rates ranged from 0.85 to 2.71 log with maximum decays approximately one order of magnitude observed for qnrS, bla SHV-1 and bla DHA-1 genes. However, HWWTPs were not efficient at removing all ARGs, and the concentration of five β-lactam ARGs (bla OXA-1 , bla OXA-10 , bla DHA-1 , bla SHV-1 , bla TEM-1 ) and two quinolone ARGs (qnrA and qnrD) were even increased in the treated wastewater (Yao et al., 2021). These results prove that an inadequate chlorine dosage can increase ARG concentrations, inducing the formation of more pili for conjugative transfer (Guo et al., 2015;Hu et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2020a).Despite the major challenge posed by HWW, conventional biological and chemical processes have attempted to face its treatment.

        <p>Disinfection systems based on ozone (E 0 : 2.07 V) are highly effective because this species has an oxidation potential higher than other commonly disinfectants such as chlorine (E 0 : 1.36 V) or hypochlorite (E 0 : 1.49 V) (Huang et al., 1993). Chiang et al. (2003) studied the disinfection of hospital effluents by ozonation at neutral pH, finding that a complete removal of P. aeruginosa was attained with the addition of 3.5 mg O 3 L -1 . A similar ozone dosage was able to reduce the population of total coliforms in more than 4-log units.Disinfection systems based on ozone (E 0 : 2.07 V) are highly effective because this species has an oxidation potential higher than other commonly disinfectants such as chlorine (E 0 : 1.36 V) or hypochlorite (E 0 : 1.49 V) (Huang et al., 1993).

        <p>The influence of pH on bacteria removal was evaluated in cholera treatment centers using hydrated lime (pH 11.4-12.2) and hydrochloric acid (pH 3.7-3.9) during 14 h since extreme values can significantly affect the survival of pathogens (Sozzi et al., 2015). Results from a full-scale process showed that thermotolerant coliforms were removed up to 99.97% in HWW, being higher the efficiency in acid conditions. Furthermore, treated effluents met the WHO bacteriological guideline values for agricultural reuse (fewer than 1000 CFU/100 mL) (Mara et al., 1989).The influence of pH on bacteria removal was evaluated in cholera treatment centers using hydrated lime (pH 11.4-12.2) and hydrochloric acid (pH 3.7-3.9) during 14 h since extreme values can significantly affect the survival of pathogens (Sozzi et al., 2015).

        <p>Chemical processes are cost-effective options for the reduction of the hazardousness associated with ARB in sanitary effluents. However, the use of chemicals can promote the occurrence of disinfection byproducts due to the presence of organic compounds in HWW which are susceptible to react with chlorine-based disinfectants. These organochlorinated compounds are known to be mutagenic and cancerogenic for humans (Lu et al., 2009;Yang and Cheng, 2007) and, for this reason, the application of AOPs to the disinfection of HWW has been recently tested with the aim of improving disinfection efficiencies and avoiding the disinfection by-products (Pauwels and Verstraete, 2006;Somensi et al., 2012;Verlicchi et al., 2010b). Munoz et al. (2016) reported the efficiency of the Fenton process in the removal of total coliforms from real HWW. The process operated under temperatures within the range of 50-90 °C, obtaining oxalic and formic acids as main by-products. Treated effluents exhibited 4 times less toxicity than the raw wastewater at temperatures higher than 70 °C. The Fenton process with the irradiation of UVC light (PF) has been also successfully tested for the complete removal of total coliforms and E. coli in HWW (Perini et al., 2018). Likewise, Serna-Galvis et al. ( 2019) evaluated the removal of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae in HWW by PF, finding that the use of 5 mg L -1 Fe 2+ and 50 mg L -1 H 2 O 2 under UVA irradiation led to a reduction of 3.3-logs in the concentration of bacteria in 300 min. The addition of 9 μM of citric acid enhanced the PF process until the complete removal of K. pneumoniae in 300 min. Furthermore, the replacement of H 2 O 2 by 1470 μM Na 2 S 2 O 8 improved the disinfection efficiencies, reaching the bacteria removal in 60 min. They also proposed different possible inactivation routes for K. pneumoniae (Fig. 9): 1) direct action of UVA on internal cell components; 2) external oxidation by H 2 O 2 ; 3) internal PF process, 4) external PF process.Chemical processes are cost-effective options for the reduction of the hazardousness associated with ARB in sanitary effluents.

        <p>The disinfection of HWW has been also carried out by AOPs based on the photoactivation of chemical oxidants to produce large amounts of free radicals that promote the killing of microorganisms. Luo et al. (2020) compared the efficiencies of chemical and photochemical processes for the removal of faecal coliforms in HWW. Results showed that single photolysis was enhanced by the addition of 10 mg L -1 of Cl 2 in 0.72 log units, reaching a final decrease in bacteria concentration around 4-log units. Moussavi et al. (2019) described two UV-based AOPs for the disinfection of sanitary effluents (10 10 UFC ml -1 of E. coli): vacuum UV (VUV) with the addition of hydrogen peroxide (VUV/H 2 O 2 ) and UVC/H 2 O 2 process. They found that VUV/H 2 O 2 was much more efficient than the UVC/H 2 O 2 process since a complete removal of E. coli was attained with the first one whereas the irradiation of UVC light promoted a reduction of 6.1-log units. This was mainly attributed to the higher production of free radicals by the photoactivation of H 2 O 2 using the VUV lamp (100〉 λ &gt; 200 nm) that emits radiation at wavelengths lower than UVC lamps (200〉 λ &gt; 280 nm). In fact, the molar ratio absorption of H 2 O 2 is about 180 L(mol•cm) -1 at wavelengths around 200 nm and significantly decreases at 254 nm (19.6 L(mol•cm) - 1 ) which is the typical operating value of UVC lamps (Mierzwa et al., 2018).The disinfection of HWW has been also carried out by AOPs based on the photoactivation of chemical oxidants to produce large amounts of free radicals that promote the killing of microorganisms.

        <p>Many studies have been focused on the disinfection of complex water matrices contaminated with bacteria and viruses by photodynamic inactivation (PDI) (Almeida et al., 2011;Almeida et al., 2009). This technology is based on the action of light on a photosensitizer that leads to the production of ROS in presence of molecular oxygen, promoting the killing of microorganisms. Almeida et al. (2014) tested the PDI technology for the treatment of sanitary effluents contaminated with E. coli, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii and S. aureus. They employed 5 μM of Tetra-Py + -Me as photosensitizer solution and irradiated the samples with white light (380-700 nm) during 270 min. Results showed that reductions higher than 6-log units were obtained for each pathogen and for a mixture of the four bacteria.Many studies have been focused on the disinfection of complex water matrices contaminated with bacteria and viruses by photodynamic inactivation (PDI) (Almeida et al., 2011;Almeida et al., 2009).

        <p>Ozone is a powerful disinfectant that can be activated by ultrasound, favouring the production of free radicals which improve the disinfection efficiencies of single ozonation and ultrasound irradiation processes (Naddeo et al., 2010;Naddeo et al., 2012). Somensi et al. (2015) studied the removal of total coliforms and DNA denaturation efficiency in sanitary effluents by O 3 and O 3 /US at 70 and 100 W L -1 . No viable cells were observed in the inoculated Petri dishes after 40 min, although the O 3 /US process at 100 W L -1 was the most efficient in killing pathogens. This was mainly due to the higher amount of free radicals in the effluent. Results from gel electrophoresis analysis showed that O 3 /US processes achieved a higher degree of genetic denaturation than single ozonation. The denaturation rate reached was 64 and 81% for the power densities applied of 70 and 100 W L -1 , respectively. These results point out the need for developing efficient treatment technologies focused on killing microorganisms and DNA denaturation to reduce the antibiotic resistance mechanisms in treated effluents.Ozone is a powerful disinfectant that can be activated by ultrasound, favouring the production of free radicals which improve the disinfection efficiencies of single ozonation and ultrasound irradiation processes (Naddeo et al., 2010;Naddeo et al., 2012).

        <p>Within heterogeneous photocatalytic AOPs, the predominant disinfection process for the treatment of HWW reported in literature is the catalytic photoozonation (UV/TiO 2 /O 3 ). This process consists of providing an additional source of hydroxyl radicals from oxygen and ozone adsorbed (O 2(ads) and O 3(ads) ) on a solid catalyst (Eqs. ( 37)-( 40)) (Litter, 1999). Furthermore, the irradiation of UV light not only contributes to the removal of microorganisms by its penetration into cells but also enhances the generation of hydroxyl radicals by the photoactivation of oxidants. Machado et al. (2007) studied the removal of thermotolerant coliforms in a secondary HWW by catalytic photoozonation using a ramptype reactor equipped with a germicidal low-pressure mercury vapor lamp. They concluded that the use of 2.96 mg cm -2 TiO 2 (P25, Degussa) in the photoirradiation ramp together with the generation of 5.8 mg h -1 O 3 in the reactor's inner air led to the complete disinfection of the effluent after a 60 min treatment. This UV/TiO 2 /O 3 process was also tested for the disinfection of hospital laundry wastewater under the same erating conditions by Kis et al. (2008). Results showed that a complete removal of E. coli and thermotolerant coliforms was attained which reveals that catalitic photoozonation can be considered as an efficient alternative for the disinfection of HWW.Within heterogeneous photocatalytic AOPs, the predominant disinfection process for the treatment of HWW reported in literature is the catalytic photoozonation (UV/TiO 2 /O 3 ).

        <p>Finally, EAOPs have been also tested for the disinfection of HWW. Zhou et al. (2014) reported the removal of faecal coliforms (9•10 1 CFU mL -1 ) by EO using a Ti/SnO 2 -Sb 2 O 3 /PbO 2 anode and a carbon fiber cathode. A complete disinfection was attained in 12 min when applying a current density of 80 A m -2 . Initial concentrations of NaCl higher than 200 mg L -1 enhanced the disinfection rates because of the higher electrochemical production of free chlorine. Rieder et al. (2008) studied a novel alternative for HWW treatment based on the pulsed electric field (PEF). The PEF technology is directly applied against membranes of biological cells. The phosphorus lipid double layer in membranes is broken during the PEF process and represents the main mechanism of this technique for cell lysis. Results showed that the complete disinfection of P. aeruginosa was achieved and molecular genomic DNA was released due to cell lysis. In addition, nuclease activities were determined degrading the genetic material in HWW, avoiding the promotion of genetic transfer events that could enhance the spreading of ARB.Finally, EAOPs have been also tested for the disinfection of HWW.

        <p>Wastewater generated in hospital facilities come from different sources (laundry, kitchen, toilets…) but hospital urine can be considered as the main hotspot of both drugs and microorganisms release, despite it only represents 2-3% of the total volume of hospital wastewater (Lienert et al., 2011b). Specifically, urines contribute to: 1) diffusion of PhCs and/or products metabolized by the human body because 55-80% of ingested drugs are excreted in urine (Al Aukidy et al., 2014); and 2) diffusion of pathogens (viruses, fungi and bacteria) due to the proliferation and/or accumulation of certain microorganisms in the urinary tract in immunocompromised patients whose immune system is unable to control the infection. The concentration of chemical and biological contaminants in urine is up to 3-fold higher than that found in hospital wastewater (Zhang et al., 2015) and, hence, the direct treatment of urine at the point of generation could reduce the energy costs for downstream WWTPs and related ecotoxicity risks (Lienert et al., 2011a). For these reasons, the treatment of urines becomes a key goal for reducing the environmental and health impact of hospital effluents. In last years, the number of scientific papers related to the disinfection of urines is increasing, but they are still limited. Table 3 summarizes recent studies related to this purpose.Wastewater generated in hospital facilities come from different sources (laundry, kitchen, toilets…) but hospital urine can be considered as the main hotspot of both drugs and microorganisms release, despite it only represents 2-3% of the total volume of hospital wastewater (Lienert et al., 2011b).

        <p>Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) have been also tested as an environmentally friendly alternative for urine disinfection. Despite MFCs are bioelectrochemical reactors in which mainly organic contaminants are oxidized in the anodic chamber obtaining electricity in the process, the removal of S. enterica in urine by MFC technology has been reported by Ieropoulos et al. (2017) who concluded that the operation under closedcircuit conditions was the best MFC configuration since a reduction of 4.43 log units in bacteria concentration was attained. These same authors also studied the performance of the MFC under close circuit conditions for the disinfection of S. enterica and P. aeruginosa (Ieropoulos et al., 2019). In this last work, MFC cascades were fed with a flow rate of 0.4 L d -1 , resulting in a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3.5 h. Results revealed that the new operating conditions improved the disinfection performance, achieving a reduction of 6.91 and 7.79 log units in S. enterica and P. aeruginosa, respectively. They proposed several disinfection mechanisms based on high pH and the production of electric power in the anodic chamber, causing a stressful environment for the exogenous pathogenic organisms.Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) have been also tested as an environmentally friendly alternative for urine disinfection.

        <p>Urine is a complex matrix which not only contains inorganic salts but also natural organic compounds such as urea, creatinine and uric acid (Dbira et al., 2015). The application of AOPs to the disinfection of urines can promote the removal of both microorganisms and organics until their complete mineralization since hydroxyl radical is a nonselective oxidant (Sirés et al., 2014). Therefore, the occurrence of competitive oxidation reactions can promote a decrease in the disinfection efficiency. Giannakis et al. (2018) compared the removal of E. coli from wastewater and urine by UV-C based AOPs, finding that total disinfection was achieved by single photolysis (UV-C) and a positive synergistic effect was obtained with the addition of 10 mg L -1 of hydrogen peroxide (UVC/H 2 O 2 ). This last process promotes the generation of large amounts of hydroxyl radicals which not only contribute to the killing of microorganisms but also avoid the bacteria regrowth.Urine is a complex matrix which not only contains inorganic salts but also natural organic compounds such as urea, creatinine and uric acid (Dbira et al., 2015).

        <p>The electrochemical oxidation has been also tested for the disinfection of urines since this technology can promote the production of powerful oxidants from the ions naturally contained in urine, and the subsequent removal of microorganisms. Many authors have studied the feasibility of BDD anodes in the disinfection of urine matrices by EO. Raut et al. (2014) studied the implementation of an electrochemical device equipped with BDD anodes to a modular outdoor toilet for the removal of E. coli from urine in developing countries. The influence of the applied voltage was evaluated on the disinfection process, finding that the higher the voltage applied, the higher the disinfection rate. Nonetheless, the removal of E. coli was attained for all the voltages tested (6-12 V). In a later work, Raut et al. (2019) compared different operation modes for the same electrodisinfection system with the aim of minimizing the energy required for killing microorganisms: continuous voltage mode vs. pulse operation mode. Results showed energy saving of 68% when applying a 10% duty cycle at 6 V at pulse mode. However, the disinfection rates were lower under this novel operation mode. Cotillas et al. (2018) also tested the use of BDD anodes for the removal of E. coli and P. aeruginosa in polluted urines, obtaining the complete removal of both microorganisms applying electric charges lower than 0.25 k Ah m -3 and current densities of 5 mA cm -2 (Fig. 10). Electrogenerated chlorine-based disinfectants were reported as the main responsible species for the disinfection. The presence of natural organics (urea, creatinine and uric acid) in urine seems to play a key role on the disinfection process by EO. The partial or total oxidation of organic compounds release a high nitrogen load to the effluent which can be transformed into other inorganic species (Cotillas et al., 2018;Martin De Vidales et al., 2016). Specifically, nitrite is formed from the organic nitrogen released (Eq. ( 41)), which is rapidly oxidized to nitrate (Eqs. ( 42)-( 43)). This last one can be electrochemically reduced, favouring the generation of ammonium (Eqs. ( 44)-( 45)) (Lacasa et al., 2012).The electrochemical oxidation has been also tested for the disinfection of urines since this technology can promote the production of powerful oxidants from the ions naturally contained in urine, and the subsequent removal of microorganisms.

Results showed energy saving of 68% when applying a 10% duty cycle at 6 V at pulse mode. However, the disinfection rates were lower under this novel operation mode. Cotillas et al. (2018) also tested the use of BDD anodes for the removal of E. coli and P. aeruginosa in polluted urines, obtaining the complete removal of both microorganisms applying electric charges lower than 0.25 k Ah m -3 and current densities of 5 mA cm -2 (Fig. 10). Electrogenerated chlorine-based disinfectants were reported as the main responsible species for the disinfection. The presence of natural organics (urea, creatinine and uric acid) in urine seems to play a key role on the disinfection process by EO. The partial or total oxidation of organic compounds release a high nitrogen load to the effluent which can be transformed into other inorganic species (Cotillas et al., 2018;Martin De Vidales et al., 2016). Specifically, nitrite is formed from the organic nitrogen released (Eq. ( 41)), which is rapidly oxidized to nitrate (Eqs. ( 42)-( 43)). This last one can be electrochemically reduced, favouring the generation of ammonium (Eqs. ( 44)-( 45)) (Lacasa et al., 2012).</p>
        <p>Ammonium can react with electrogenerated free chlorine, promoting the production of combined chlorine species (chloramines) (Eqs. ( 46)-( 48)). These species have a disinfectant capacity that also contributes to the removal of microorganisms. Hence, the electrochemical oxidation with BDD anodes could be considered a suitable technology for the disinfection of urines since large amounts of disinfectants are generated without the addition of chemicals.Ammonium can react with electrogenerated free chlorine, promoting the production of combined chlorine species (chloramines) (Eqs.

For this reason, the operating conditions should be controlled, working at low applied electric charges and current densities for avoiding the generation of hazardous disinfection by-products. On the other hand, the use of other anode materials was also tested for the disinfection of urines with the aim of limiting the production of chlorates and/or perchlorates. Dbira et al. (2019) reported the disinfection of urines by EO using BDD and different MMO (Ti-RuO 2 , Ti-IrO 2 and Ti\ \Pt) anodes. The complete removal of E. coli was achieved with all anodes at 15 mA cm -2 , being BDD the most efficient material followed by Ti-RuO 2 , Ti-IrO 2 and, finally, Ti\ \Pt anodes. The use of BDD anodes led to the highest production of ammonium and nitrates, which implies the degradation of organic compounds. Furthermore, high concentrations of perchlorates were obtained during the process with BDD anodes and large amounts of chlorates were detected using Ti-RuO 2 and Ti-IrO 2 anodes. These results reveal, once again, that very soft operating conditions should be applied for avoiding the formation of disinfection-by products during EO. Singla et al. (2020) evaluated the EO and the photoelectrocatalytic process (PEC) for the disinfection of synthetic urines with MMO anodes. They concluded that the optimum conditions for the disinfection of urines by EO were 0.42 N/Cl ratios and current densities of 30.33 mA cm -2 . Likewise, EO could also be improved by the irradiation of UV light, being the removal of E. coli faster in the PEC process (40 min) than that observed in the EO process (60 min) under the optimum operating conditions. Toxicity analyses confirmed that treated urines were non-toxic.However, the use of BDD anodes promotes the occurrence of chlorine compounds in high oxidation state during the electrochemical Fig. 10.

        <p>Novel processes have been developed and applied to the removal of bacteria, ARB, ARGs and other mobile genetic elements in different water matrices with the aim of controlling the antibiotic resistance spread to decrease the sanitary and environmental risks. The influence of the medium composition on the treatment processes is crucial since competitive oxidation reactions may be developed among the organic compounds and the pathogens contained in the aquatic medium. This fact may be even more relevant in very high-infectious wastewater such as HWW and above all, hospital urines. Adsorption technologies may retain pathogens on oxidized cellulose filters, novel adsorbent materials like zeolites, or nanomaterials and natural coagulants that must be treated later for reaching the complete disinfection due to possible bacterial regrowth. Other conventional treatments mostly used to remove the general contaminants including fats, oils, organic matters, nitrogen, and phosphorus from municipal WWTPs, such as the biological processes, have been modified to enhance its antibacterial capabilities. Furthermore, biological processes have been even combined as pretreatment with electrochemical and/or irradiation technologies to improve the disinfection efficiencies. However, these processes (Wetland systems, MBRs, MFCs…) do not address the removal of ARGs or mobile genetic elements. Likewise, the use of excellent disinfectant chemicals like chlorine, hypochlorite or PA are broadly studied in literature.Novel processes have been developed and applied to the removal of bacteria, ARB, ARGs and other mobile genetic elements in different water matrices with the aim of controlling the antibiotic resistance spread to decrease the sanitary and environmental risks.

        <p>On the other hand, AOPs promotes the generation of large amounts of highly reactive species such as sulfate or hydroxyl radicals, which are directly involved in the killing of pathogens. Among AOPs, the homogeneous Fenton has been extensively studied for wastewater treatment and this process has been continuously improved by using solid catalysts like CuFe 2 O 4 to operate under a wide pH range (heterogeneous Fenton) or by coupling UV, UVA, UVC and solar irradiation (photo-Fenton) to promotes the massive production of powerful disinfection radicals. The catalytic ozonation using solid metal catalysts has also been tested for removal of pathogens. Likewise, photocatalytic processes using TiO 2 doped with metals as silver oxalate, multi-component oxides, silver or magnesium or doped with non-metal as nitrogen and carbon are also promising technologies to treat wastewater effluents.On the other hand, AOPs promotes the generation of large amounts of highly reactive species such as sulfate or hydroxyl radicals, which are directly involved in the killing of pathogens.

        <p>Other AOPs based on electrochemistry (EAOPs) have emerged as encouraging alternatives for wastewater disinfection since EAOPs does not involved the addition of chemicals. Ions naturally contained in the untreated effluents are oxidized or reduced on the anode or cathode surface, respectively, to produce powerful disinfectant species which can be further activated by coupling irradiation technologies. EAOPs are promising technologies for the possible future decentralized water treatment of sanitary facilities. Nevertheless, more studies based on EAOPs are required to find low-cost electrode materials and optimize the operational conditions for minimizing the formation of toxic disinfection by-products. Future developments should be focused on a deeper study on the scale-up of EAOPs and the electrochemical reactors design to ensure an efficient and economical exploitation of this technology. Specifically, future research lines should also be focused on developing technologies with the main aim of preventing the antibiotic resistance spread, removing ARB, avoiding bacterial regrowth, and ensuring the abatement of ARGs and other mobile genetic elements to maintain a safer public health and environment protection.Other AOPs based on electrochemistry (EAOPs) have emerged as encouraging alternatives for wastewater disinfection since EAOPs does not involved the addition of chemicals.
