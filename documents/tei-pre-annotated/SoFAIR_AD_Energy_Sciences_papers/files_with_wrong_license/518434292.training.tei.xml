        <p>Improving energy efficiency is essential for energy conservation, emissions reduction, and sustainable development. Prevalent huge efficiency gaps are not advantageous for the improvement of the region's overall energy efficiency. Although studies have analyzed the influencing factors of the regional energy efficiency gap, the impact of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap remains untested. This paper applies the extended stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) method that incorporates time-varying, time-invariant and city heterogeneous characteristics to estimate the city-level energy efficiency in China from 2005 to 2017. Building on the "center-periphery" framework, we further calculate the regional energy efficiency gap and investigate the impact of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap through the generalized moment method (GMM). The results show that 1) average city-level energy efficiency is 44.2%, ranging from 2.9% to 75.5%, indicating that China has a huge regional energy efficiency gap; 2) there is a U-shaped relationship between regional integration and the regional energy efficiency gap within city agglomeration. Improvement in regional integration can narrow the regional energy efficiency gap when the degree of regional integration is low, and expand the efficiency gap when regional integration level is high; 3) government intervention will smooth the impact of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap within city agglomeration. Practicable policies to mitigate the regional energy efficiency gap in China are suggested and applicable to other emerging economies, especially for those with a huge imbalance in regional energy efficiency.</p>
        <p>China's sustained high economic growth has accompanied the sharp increase in resources and energy consumption (Xiao et al., 2018). China's energy consumption and carbon emissions have ranked first in the world since 2006 (Shan et al., 2017). Increased energy consumption poses severe environmental and climate challenges for China. Improving energy efficiency is one of the most effective policy tools to solve this challenge for China (Khoshnevisan et al., 2013;Bertoldi and Mosconi, 2020). Energy efficiency is closely related to energy intensity, with higher energy intensity representing lower energy efficiency. According to World Energy Statistics (2019), China's energy intensity was 0.131 koe/$2015p in 2018, far higher than that of developed countries such as Japan (0.079 koe/$2015p) and the United Kingdom (0.062 koe/$2015p), etc. These statistics show that China's average energy efficiency has a large space for improvement. From a regional perspective, Zou et al. (2019) point out that the energy efficiency gap in different cities even reached more than six times in China. Core cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou have higher levels of energy efficiency, and peripheral cities such as Tangshan, Changzhou and Huizhou have lower energy efficiency (Chen et al., 2016). Thus, China's energy efficiency has demonstrated a huge regional gap. In this context, the focus is on how to improve peripheral cities' energy efficiency (Zhao et al., 2019). It is notable that the regional energy efficiency gap studied in this paper is different from regional energy efficiency inequality. Existing studies have defined regional energy efficiency inequality as the degree of deviation of the energy efficiency of each city in the region from the average level (Padilla and Duro, 2013). We define the regional energy efficiency gap as the gap between core cities and peripheral cities. Research on energy efficiency inequality provides effective suggestions for reducing the efficiency gap between cities, but it ignores the difference between the core and the peripheral cities within the region (Xu and Chen, 2019). Since peripheral cities have a higher potential for energy efficiency improvement, more improvements in energy efficiency in peripheral cities, i.e., narrowing the regional energy efficiency gap, help maximize the overall energy efficiency for the entire region. Narrowing the regional energy efficiency gap is a process of relative improvement of energy efficiency in areas with lower energy efficiency, which can optimize energy conservation and emission reduction in the region. Narrowing the gaps in investment, human capital, and transportation are essential methods to narrow the regional energy efficiency gap (Jiang et al., 2017;Elliott et al., 2017). However, more innovative approaches are necessary. In addition, specific to practical energy policies to narrow the regional energy efficiency gap, recent studies have been limited to a large geographical scope, such as the provincial or national level (Fisher-Vanden et al., 2004;Ma et al., 2012); thus, further research on the regional energy efficiency gap in small geographical areas at the city level is necessary.</p>
        <p>Regional integration is an effective means to alleviate regional gaps and improve economic co-development (Zhao and Lin, 2019). Regional integration affects the regional energy efficiency gap through the agglomeration effect and the selection effect. When regional integration is in the initial stage, the agglomeration effect is higher than the selection effect, so that the energy efficiency of peripheral cities experiences great enhancement, thus narrowing the regional energy efficiency gap (Peluffo, 2013;Qu et al., 2020). However, when regional integration continues to increase beyond a certain level, the marginal impact of the agglomeration effect decreases while the selection effect increases, so that low-efficiency enterprises in core cities select to re-locate to peripheral cities when faced with such lower marginal returns and higher operation costs, thus reducing the energy efficiency of peripheral cities (Sedlacek et al., 2020). Notably, this movement also makes the energy efficiency of the core cities increasing. Accordingly, taken together, the regional energy efficiency gap within city agglomeration is expanding. Therefore, the influence of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap is likely in a U-shaped relationship.</p>
        <p>There are several challenges when measuring energy efficiency and investigating the impact of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap: The first challenge is how to choose a more effective method to measure energy efficiency at the city level. Recent studies have used data envelopment analysis (DEA) and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) (Filippini and Hunt, 2011); however, as a non-parametric method, DEA cannot separate the unobserved heterogeneity among different cities (Filippini and Hunt, 2015). For the SFA method, existing literature only included one or two technical inefficiency error components in the SFA model to calculate the energy efficiency, without considering time-varying, time-invariant and city-level characteristics. This leads to overestimating or underestimating of energy efficiency (Kumbhakar et al., 2014). Additionally, studies have applied province-level aggregate data in China, which leads to an inaccurate evaluation of energy efficiency in China.</p>
        <p>The second challenge is the advanced development of how to measure the regional energy efficiency gap within a region. The research on the regional energy efficiency gap focuses on the gap of energy efficiency among different regions but ignores the gap in energy efficiency between core cities and peripheral cities. Thirdly, it is difficult to analyze the impact of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap. Although the literature has analyzed the impact of regional integration on energy efficiency and carbon emissions, there is currently no research on the potential impact of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap. Finally, the literature has demonstrated that government intervention reduces the efficiency of resource allocation and restricts the circulation of energy-related technologies within regions in China, which is critical in the analysis of the regional energy efficiency gap (Fu, 2018;Choi, 2020). Nevertheless, how it affects the impact of the regional energy efficiency gap brought by regional integration remains unclear.</p>
        <p>The contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows. First, we have made methodological improvements in measuring energy efficiency. Existing studies on energy efficiency measures tend to use SFA models with consideration for only time-varying and time-invariant energy inefficiency components. Since different cities have different optimal frontiers, ignoring the city-level heterogeneous factors may lead to unreliable estimations. Thus, a comprehensive measure that integrates all three inefficiency factors, i.e., time-varying, time-invariant and city-level heterogeneous factors, is needed. This study compares the applications of five SFA regression models with different residual decompositions and selects the most effective model to measure the energy efficiency by econometric criteria (Kumbhakar et al., 2014). The advanced measure of energy efficiency takes into account the aforementioned three important factors, and so the results are more likely to reflect the real practices of energy efficiency.</p>
        <p>Second, building on "center-periphery" theory, this study calculates the regional energy efficiency gap between core cities and peripheral cities in city agglomeration. This theoretical framework was widely used in the analysis of regional economics, but its application in terms of the regional energy efficiency gap has received limited scholarly attention. The center-periphery framework provides strong theoretical support that we can estimate regional energy efficiency gap within city agglomeration by the energy efficiency ratio of core cities and peripheral cities, which presents a new and convincing approach to measure regional energy efficiency gap.</p>
        <p>Third, to our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the impacts of regional integration process on the regional energy efficiency gap. This is important because the findings provide insights into energy policies for regions with different integration levels. Moreover, the moderating role of government intervention in the nexus between regional integration and the regional energy efficiency gap has been investigated and evinced to be significant. Emerging economies manifest in the critical power that the authorities have in guiding economic and energy development mode. The analysis of the energy development pattern in China is thus incomplete and spurious if government intervention is absent.</p>
        <p>Last, our findings have important implications for other countries with imbalance in regional energy efficiency. Regional inequality in energy efficiency is not unique to China. Therefore, we provide insights into mitigate the regional efficiency gap so as to achieve effective energy conservation and emission reduction without compromising on economic integration progress. Besides, the different roles that government intervention plays in the nexus between regional integration and the energy efficiency gap investigated in this study will shed light on the roles that the government should act in other emerging economies.</p>
        <p>Energy efficiency is the ratio of "minimum energy use/real energy use" based on microeconomic theory (Huntington, 1994;Evans et al., 2013). In this definition, minimum energy use refers to the minimum energy input at the completion of the determined economic output, which can be measured by econometric methods. Real energy input refers to the total amount of energy actually invested. This definition can reflect energy efficiency more effectively and is adopted in this paper. Based on this definition, increasing energy efficiency can efficiently increase the marginal contribution of energy input to economic development (Sorrell, 2015).</p>
        <p>We can estimate energy efficiency through both the non-parametric approach and the parametric approach (Filippini and Hunt, 2015). DEA is the most widely used non-parametric approach. Basic DEA uses objective functions and constraints to implement linear programming, which aims to estimate the minimum energy consumption of each sample. Subsequently, a series of extended DEA methods have been increasingly used in the measurement of energy efficiency, such as SBM-DEA (Choi et al., 2012), two-stage DEA (Molinos-Senante et al., 2014), and three-stage DEA (Byrnes et al., 2010). As a non-parametric method, DEA cannot separate unobserved heterogeneity in the production of energy services (Filippini and Hunt, 2015). This bias in small samples is limited. However, we need to consider overestimation or underestimation caused by unobserved heterogeneity for slightly larger sample data (Filippini and Hunt, 2015). SFA was first proposed by Aigner et al. (1977), and is also a common parametric approach to measure energy efficiency. Filippini and Hunt (2015) propose a framework of energy efficiency measurement based on SFA, which includes two important stages: constructing an energy demand stochastic frontier (SF) model for regression and setting regression residual decomposition characteristics for the estimation. The decomposition characteristics of regression residual refer to the inefficiency part of the regression residuals. SFA methods measure energy efficiency by removing these inefficiency parts in regression residual. Parameter estimation approaches proposed by Kumbhakar et al. (2014) can distinguish three kinds of regression residual decomposition characteristics including time-varying energy inefficiency, time-invariant energy inefficiency, and individual effects. However, the econometric methods used in recent studies to measure energy efficiency can only identify one or two (at most) residual decomposition characteristics in SFA regression models (Filippini and Zhang, 2016;Lundgren et al., 2016;Adom et al., 2018). This will result in the problem that some inefficiency factors cannot be removed from the regression residuals, thereby reducing the effectiveness of energy efficiency calculations. Although DEA and regular SFA methods are widely used, they cannot effectively separate the unobserved heterogeneity. Combining the framework proposed by Filippini and Hunt (2015) and the parameter estimation approaches proposed by Kumbhakar et al. (2014) can lead to a more reliable measurement of energy efficiency.</p>
        <p>Related research finds that industrial structure and human capital are key factors influencing the regional energy efficiency gap (Alcantara and Duro, 2004). In OECD countries, the level of enterprise human capital in lower energy efficiency countries is relatively low (Yao et al., 2019). In the transformation of industrial structure, these enterprises are replaced by enterprises with more advanced energy-related technologies, improving energy efficiency in the region (Zaidi et al., 2019). As a result, the regional energy efficiency gap will narrow. In addition, investment and transportation are determinants of the regional energy efficiency gap. Investment affects energy-related technologies by affecting equipment in industrial companies (Zhang et al., 2017). Therefore, the narrowing of the investment gap between regions also leads to the reduction of the regional energy efficiency gap between regions. Transportation can affect the energy efficiency of enterprises by affecting the cost of energy transportation and storage (Sa'ad, 2010). The widening of the transportation gap will further increase the energy efficiency gap between regions, that is, the expansion of the regional energy efficiency gap. Although studies have analyzed the impact of a series of factors such as investment, human capital, and transportation on the regional energy efficiency gap, the potential impact of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap remains ignored.</p>
        <p>To estimate the regional energy efficiency gap within the city agglomeration and analyze the impact of regional integration, this study applies the center-periphery regional economic model, which is a spatial economic analysis framework based on economic agglomeration (Buchholz, 2018). The framework can explain the relationship between economic growth and technology, labor, and other factors of each member in the region. The model considers the region to be a group, with research and development departments clustered in the center area, and primary manufacturing departments clustered in the peripheral area (Duranton and Puga, 2005). Studies have limited the measurement of the regional energy efficiency gap at the province level or country level (Alcantara and Duro, 2004;Zou et al., 2019). Analysis of the gap in city-level energy efficiency in specific regions has received little attention. The model can analyze the regional division of the central area and the peripheral area. Among those areas, the central area has higher energy efficiency, and the peripheral areas have lower energy efficiency (Simonazzi and Ginzburg, 2015). We can measure the regional energy efficiency gap by the ratio of energy efficiency between these two areas within city agglomeration.</p>
        <p>We further discuss relevant literature on how regional integration affects the regional energy efficiency gap. Regional integration mainly affects the regional energy efficiency gap through the agglomeration effect and the selection effect (see Fig. 1). First, regional integration promotes the agglomeration of tertiary industries in core cities, thus improving their energy efficiency through industrial upgrading (López-Córdova and Moreira, 2003;Peluffo, 2013). Regional integration also improves energy efficiency of peripheral cities through the agglomeration of secondary industries because of the reduced marginal energy input of enterprises through economy of scale (Qu et al., 2020). Therefore, regional integration improves energy efficiency in both core cities and peripheral cities through the agglomeration effect. Second, regional integration has also promoted the influx of high-efficiency enterprises into core cities to obtain technology spillover effects from the tertiary industry, especially the production services sector, which leads to further improvements in the energy efficiency of core cities (Dong et al., 2019). At the same time, increased labor costs and land rent in core cities make low-efficiency companies more willing to move to peripheral cities, thereby reducing the energy efficiency of peripheral cities (Sedlacek et al., 2020). As such, the selection effect of regional integration leads to the increase in the energy efficiency of core cities and the decline in energy efficiency in peripheral cities. With the advancement of regional integration, the agglomeration effect and the selection effect have also changed. When the degree of regional integration is low, the agglomeration has higher marginal benefits, and the relatively low production cost of core cities will not lead to the migration of a large number of enterprises toward peripheral cities. In this stage, the agglomeration effect is higher than the selection effect (Commendatore et al., 2014), so that peripheral cities can achieve energy efficiency improvements from regional integration. As a result, the regional energy efficiency gap is narrowed. However, when the degree of regional integration is high, the marginal effect of agglomeration decreases, and the relatively high production cost of core cities accelerates the re-location of low-efficiency enterprises toward peripheral cities. In this stage, the selection effect is higher than the agglomeration effect. Accordingly, the energy efficiency of core cities improves but decreases in peripheral cities, and so the regional energy efficiency gap is expanded. Taken together, we propose that the impact of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap is likely to demonstrate a U-shaped relationship that narrows first and expands afterward.</p>
        <p>Due to the strong intervention capability of the local government in China's resource allocation capabilities, it is of vital importance to take government intervention into account (Feng et al., 2020). Local governments will implement preferential policies to some state-owned enterprises for energy utilization, for example, price subsidies and tax deductions (Zhang et al., 2017;Qi et al., 2019). This behavior will disrupt market competition, is not conducive to the circulation of energy technologies within the region, and weakens the effects of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap. Additionally, the existence of the political tournament mechanism will cause different members to compete within the region in China (Yu et al., 2016). Advanced energy-related technologies will also become the object of competition, which will strengthen the barriers within the region and reduce the effect of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap (Jin et al., 2020). This analysis shows that government intervention restrains the impact of the regional energy efficiency gap caused by regional integration.</p>
        <p>To summarize, we find that many studies have proposed the definition and measurement of energy efficiency and the regional energy efficiency gap, which provides the theoretical basis for our research. However, we find that SFA methods with three regression residual decomposition characteristics included can be utilized to measure energy efficiency more effectively. At the same time, the application of the center-periphery regional economic model in measuring the regional energy efficiency gap has received less attention from energy scholars. In addition, human capital, investment, and transportation are driving factors of the regional energy efficiency gap. However, no studies have investigated the impact of regional integration on the energy efficiency gap. Moreover, research on a critical institutional factor in China, government intervention, in the relationship between regional integration and the regional energy efficiency gap remains scarce.</p>
        <p>To explore the U-shaped relationship between regional integration and the regional energy efficiency gap, we construct the following econometric model:</p>
        <p>where reeg it represents the regional energy efficiency gap, and reeg i,t-1 represents the regional energy efficiency gap of city agglomeration i in period t-1. The lag term is included in the model because the regional energy efficiency gap between the core city and the peripheral city in the city agglomeration is influenced by both current and past factors. It is a dynamic evolution process in the long run. Further, fd it represents the regional integration, rcitysize it represents the gap of city size, rinvest it Fig. 1. The impact mechanism of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap.</p>
        <p>represents the gap of investment level, rhum it represents the human capital gap, and rtrans it represents the transportation gap of city agglomeration i in period t.</p>
        <p>To further test the impacts of government intervention in the nexus between regional integration and regional energy efficiency gap, we add government intervention as an interaction term to Eq. ( 1), and so the empirical model is specified as follows:</p>
        <p>where rgov it represents the government intervention of city agglomeration i in period t-1, and rgov it × fd it and rgov it × fd 2 it reflect the regulatory effect of government intervention on the impact of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap within city agglomeration.</p>
        <p>In the regression process, we use the system generalized moment method (Sys-GMM), a dynamic panel method, to estimate parameters. The advantages of this method are mainly reflected in two aspects. First, compared with the OLS method, the static panel method based on fixed effects or random effects can achieve parameter estimation, the existence of the lag term causes bias in estimation results. The GMM method can overcome the bias caused by the correlation between the lag term and the dependent variable to a certain extent. Second, compared with difference GMM (Diff-GMM), Sys-GMM provides smaller bias and higher estimation accuracy (Blundell and Bond, 1998). The lag order of the variable is used as the instrument variable for both the difference equation and the level equation in Sys-GMM, which can obtain a more efficient parameter estimation (Arellano and Bond, 1991;Labra and Torrecillas, 2018).</p>
        <p>The first criterion is the autocorrelation (AR) test proposed by Arellano and Bond (1991). We report the results of the p value of AR (1) and AR (2) of the error term. If the p value of AR (1) is less than 0.05 and the p value of AR (2) is higher than 0.05, the model has endogeneity, and the endogeneity can be controlled by adding the first-order dependent variable.</p>
        <p>Another criterion is the J statistic proposed by Sarga (1958), which is a commonly-used test of the validity of instrumental variables. The null hypothesis (H 0 ) of the Sargan test is that instrumental variables are valid (Fritsch, 2019). We report the p value of the Sargan test. If the p value of the test is above 0.05, the null hypothesis is accepted.</p>
        <p>To analyze the impact of the regional energy efficiency gap and regional integration, we must calculate the energy efficiency at the citylevel reliably. The analyses in the literature have indicated that the energy efficiency measurement framework proposed by Filippini and Hunt (2015) is more systematic and has a theoretical basis in economics. Our research will follow this framework and apply more effective econometric approaches.</p>
        <p>Under this framework, the first step is constructing the SF model of energy demand. The SF model of energy demand is critical to the measurement of energy efficiency. The function provided by Filippini andHunt (2011, 2015) contains a series of factors including GDP, population, industrial structure, and industrialization. These factors largely explain the changes in energy consumption, but some factors remain unclear. Recent studies have also demonstrated that the development of information technology and globalization are also important factors that determine energy demand (Shahbaz et al., 2016;Stuermer, 2017). Therefore, we will add these two factors to the SF model built by Filippini and Hunt (2015). The SF model of energy demand is specified as follows: y, pop, ict, ind, open, is) (3)</p>
        <p>In the SF model of energy demand, e represents energy consumption, y is the economic aggregate, pop is the population, ict is the information and communication technology level, ind is the industrialization, open is the degree of the opening up, and is denotes industrial structure. In this paper, is will be calculated by the proportions of output value of secondary industry (is_sec) and tertiary industry (is_ter) to GDP.</p>
        <p>In Eq. ( 3), we present the constituent variables of the model. The specific form of function f (⋅) is also necessary using the SFA method. Following Filippini andHunt (2011, 2015), the log-log form of f (⋅) can be used in the energy demand frontier function; thus, Eq. ( 3) can be further specified:</p>
        <p>To capture information more effectively, we use city-level panel data for empirical analysis. In Eq. ( 4), i means different cities in China, and t means the year. On this basis, the second step under the framework helps us obtain the results of the energy efficiency calculations. For the classification of the parameter estimation approaches, scholars have proposed different criteria according to the research of Filippini andHunt (2011, 2015). Considering the application of the related random effect model, Filippini and Zhang (2016) divide the SF model into a pool model, random effect model, true random effect model, and Mundlak adjusted model (MREM/MTREM). However, this classification does not distinguish different SF models from different characteristics of error terms. To better explain the calculation principles of various SF models, our study follows the approach of Kumbhakar et al. (2014) and Kumbhakar et al. (2015). We apply five panel SF models: time-invariant energy inefficiency model (TIEIM), time-varying energy inefficiency model (TVEIM), energy inefficiency model that separates city effects (EIM-SCE), time-varying energy inefficiency model that separates time-invariant inefficiency (TVEIM-STI), and time-varying energy inefficiency model that separates city effects and time-invariant inefficiency (TVEIM-SCETI).</p>
        <p>The detailed descriptions and differences between these five models are shown in Appendix 1. Among these five models, TIEIM (model 1) is the basic model and only considers time-invariant energy inefficiency. TVEIM (Model 2) only considers time-varying energy inefficiency. EIM-SCE (Model3) removes time-invariant energy inefficiency from timevarying energy inefficiency and uses the processed efficiency as the final energy efficiency (Chen et al., 2017). Model4 distinguishes both time-invariant energy inefficiency and time-varying energy inefficiency; then, Model4 calculates persistent energy efficiency (PEE) from time-invariant energy inefficiency and residual energy efficiency (REE) from time-varying energy inefficiency. The overall energy efficiency (OEE) is the product of PEE and REE. TVEIM-SCEPI (model 5) further considers the city heterogeneity of calculation of PEE in Model4. Appendix 2 reports the regression results for each model. Since model 5 distinguishes PEE, REE, and city heterogeneity, this model is more reliable theoretically. Additionally, this paper further compares the distribution of energy efficiency between model 5 and other models to analyze reliability improvement. Appendix 3 reports the descriptive</p>
        <p>statistical analysis of energy efficiency for each model. The result of Jarque-Bera (JB) test in Table A3 indicates that the results of model 5 most closely approximate the normal distribution. The energy efficiency calculated by model 5 more effectively evaluates energy efficiency at the city level.</p>
        <p>To reflect the gap of energy efficiency within the city agglomeration, we calculate the regional energy efficiency gap of each city agglomeration every year by Eq. ( 5), where ee cit represents the energy efficiency of the core city in city agglomeration i in period t, ee pit represents the energy efficiency of the peripheral city in city agglomeration i in period t. m and n represent the number of core cities and peripheral cities in city agglomeration i in period t, respectively (Gao et al., 2012).</p>
        <p>Our study uses the functional urban specialization index proposed by Duranton and Puga (2005) to measure the regional integration of the city agglomeration. The estimation is specified in the following Eq. ( 6), where LT cit and LS cit represent the number of employees in the tertiary industry and secondary industry of a core city in city agglomeration i in period t. LT pit and LS pit represent the number of employees in the tertiary industry and secondary industry of a peripheral city in city agglomeration i in period t. Higher fd represents a higher level of regional integration.</p>
        <p>Increased government intervention is not conducive to market competition and the free flow of elements, which inhibit the exchange of energy use technologies between the central and peripheral areas within the city agglomeration. In this paper, the proportion of non-public financial expenditure in the financial expenditure of the local government in the central city and the peripheral city is taken as the agent variable of government intervention (Tian and Ma, 2009), which can be specified:</p>
        <p>In Eq. ( 7), NPFE cit and FE cit represent non-public financial expenditure and financial expenditure of a core city in city agglomeration i in period t. NPFE pit and FE pit represent non-public financial expenditure and financial expenditure of peripheral city in city agglomeration i in period t. Higher gov represents a higher level of government intervention.</p>
        <p>In equation Eq. ( 4), ln e is the independent variable. For Energy consumption (ln e), our study uses industrial power consumption to express city-level energy consumption in China. 2 In the equation analyzing the impact of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap, reeg is the dependent variable. We use a series of dependent variables in these two equations.</p>
        <p>In the city-level energy efficiency calculation, the control variables we use are economic aggregate (ln y). Our study uses logarithm GDP to measure city-level economic development in China. For information and communication technology (ict), our study uses the average number of internet and mobile phones per household to measure the level of information and communication technology. For industrialization (ind), our study uses the proportion of total industrial output value to GDP to measure the progress of industrialization. For degree of the opening up (open), our study uses the proportion of foreign direct investment (FDI) to GDP to measure the degree of the opening up. For industrial structure (open), our study uses the proportion of secondary industry and the tertiary industry in GDP to measure the industrial structure.</p>
        <p>When studying the impact of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap, the control variables in this paper are city size gap (rcitysize); our study uses the ratio of population in core cities to that in peripheral cities to measure the city size gap in city agglomeration, which is similar to the calculation of the regional energy efficiency gap. This method is also applied to the measurement of the following variables: For investment gap (rinvest), our study uses the ratio of fixed assets investment in core cities to that in peripheral cities to measure the investment gap in city agglomeration. For human capital gap (rhum), our study uses the proportion of the population in colleges and universities to the total population in core cities to that in peripheral cities to measure the investment gap in city agglomeration. Transportation gap (rtrans), our study uses the ratio of per capita road area to the total population in core cities to that in peripheral cities to measure the investment gap in city agglomeration. The detailed definition and descriptive statistics of these variables are presented in Table 1.</p>
        <p>We use the data of "municipal districts" of cities in China as the research sample. The data are from the China Urban Statistical Yearbook (2006-2018) and China Statistical Yearbook (2006-2018). The sample excludes cities with a serious lack of data and adjustment of administrative divisions; thus, for example, all the cities in Tibet are excluded. Data missing for more than three years are deleted. If the city data is missing within three years, we use the interpolation method to fill in the data. We use the "municipal area" data because the "municipal area" of the city is the main agglomeration area of the industry, the main consumption area of energy, and the main emission area of pollution. According to the statistical data of the China Urban Statistical Yearbook, the total industrial output value of "municipal districts" in China accounted for more than 60% of the total industrial output value of the total area of cities from 2005 to 2017. A specific criterion for the selection of the city agglomeration must be provided. The analysis report of Zhang (2013) points out that China could currently divide 24 city agglomerations. Considering that some remote city agglomerations are only designated by policy, we use a research sample of 16 city agglomerations, according to the research of Zhao and Qi (2017). The core and peripheral cities are the core and peripheral areas in the core-periphery model, and their division is based on the analysis report of Zhang (2013). These city agglomerations include a total of 146 cities, of which 20 are core cities, and 126 are peripheral cities. Table 2 reports the core cities and peripheral cities in each city agglomeration.</p>
        <p>Table A2 reports the results of the regression analysis from model 1 to model 5. Based on these estimation results, the energy efficiency corresponding to the five models can be calculated. Fig. A1 holds that the calculation results of model 1 and Model4 are all an asymmetric bellshaped distribution, and they only differ in peak value and dispersion degree. The results of Model2 are more evenly distributed than those of model 1 and Model4. Compared with Model2, the distribution of the results of model 5 is more concentrated. For Model3, the main difference is that the peak value of Model3 is much higher than that of the other four models. Persistent energy inefficiency, city heterogeneity, and timevarying energy inefficiency are considered in model 5. We found that the separation of these inefficiency components caused a significant change in the energy efficiency distribution, that is, more consistent with normal distribution. Thus, all the three inefficiency components shall be included. Based on the aforementioned discussion of the results from different models, energy efficiency estimated by model 5 is more suitable to measure the city-level energy efficiency.</p>
        <p>In Table A3, the average overall city-level energy efficiency is 44.2% based on model 5. In addition, Table A3 shows a huge gap in overall citylevel energy efficiency among cities, which reaches a maximum of 72.6%. This finding shows that energy efficiency in areas with low energy efficiency has much room for improvement. Additionally, we calculate the regional energy efficiency gap of each city agglomeration (see Fig. A3). The results show that the regional energy efficiency gap in most city agglomerations is decreasing year by year. Only a small number of city agglomerations showed an upward trend in certain periods, such as the Wuhan urban agglomeration and Harbin-Changchun urban agglomeration. Moreover, the results also show that the regional energy efficiency gap of most urban agglomerations is higher than 1 during the sample period, which means that the energy efficiency of core cities in urban agglomerations is generally higher than that of peripheral cities.</p>
        <p>Table 3 reports the results of the impact of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap within city agglomeration. Column (1) reports the results of regressions without the control variables of Eq. ( 1), using Sys-GMM. Column (2) reports the results of the regressions of Eq. ( 1).</p>
        <p>The regression results of key variables reveal the relationship between regional integration and the regional energy efficiency gap within</p>
        <p>City agglomeration specification. city agglomeration. We can measure the critical point of the U-shaped relationship to further discuss the impact of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap within city agglomeration. We obtain the following equation by only considering the relationship between regional integration and the regional energy efficiency gap within city agglomeration: reeg = -0.127fd + 0.037fd 2 + control, where control refers to factors other than regional integration contingencies, and we assume that these factors are fixed. By deriving the aforementioned equation, we obtain a partial derivative of the effect of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap (∂reeg/∂fd = 0.074fd + 0.254). When the derivative equation is 0, we obtain the only solution of 1.716, which is the inflexion point of the U-shaped relationship between regional integration and the regional energy efficiency gap. This holds that the deepening of regional integration can narrow the regional energy efficiency gap within city agglomeration when the degree of regional integration of city agglomeration is below 1.716 (stage 1); the deepening of regional integration will expand the regional energy efficiency gap within city agglomeration when the degree of regional integration of city agglomeration is above 1.716 (stage 2).</p>
        <p>The existence of this U-type relationship brings forward new ideas for the formulation of city and regional energy policies. When the degree of regional integration is insufficiently high (under 1.176), the reduction of the regional energy efficiency gap can be achieved by promoting regional integration. When regional integration reaches a certain level, the reduction of the regional energy efficiency gap should be achieved through other energy policies.</p>
        <p>The aforementioned analysis results suppose that there is an obvious U-shaped relationship between regional integration and the regional energy efficiency gap within city agglomeration, with an inflexion point of 1.716. We further calculated the average regional integration of 16 city agglomerations from 2005 to 2017 and divided each city agglomeration into the corresponding stage. The results are shown in Fig. 2.</p>
        <p>Fig. 2 shows that four city agglomerations-Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei city agglomeration, Yangtze River Delta city agglomeration, Pearl River Delta city agglomeration, Shandong peninsula city agglomeration, and Harbin-Changchun city agglomeration-are in stage 2 of the U-shaped relationship. Most of these cities are located in the eastern and central regions of China. Their superior geographical environment and resources ensure their leading position in the process of regional integration [56]. However, further regional integration at this stage expands the regional energy efficiency gap from the perspective of energy conservation and emission reduction. This finding indicates that more targeted measures must be developed to reduce the energy inefficiency of peripheral cities in city agglomeration. Fig. 2 also holds that 12 city agglomerations are in stage 1 of the U-shaped relationship: Poyang Lake city agglomeration, Wuhan city agglomeration, Chang-Zhu-Tan city agglomeration, Harbin-Changchun city agglomeration, Chang-Zhu-Tan city agglomeration, South Central Liaoning city agglomeration, Chengdu-Chongqing city agglomeration, Guanzhong-Tianshui city agglomeration, Jianghuai city agglomeration, Taiyuan city agglomeration, West Side of the Straits city agglomeration, and Beibu Gulf city agglomeration. Most of these cities are located in the western part of China. Poor geographical location results in a low degree of regional integration (Huang et al., 2018). However, at this stage, the improvement of regional integration can effectively shorten the regional energy efficiency gap within the city agglomeration. This effectively reduces the</p>
        <p>Results of the impact of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap within city agglomeration. According to the results of column (1), the coefficient of fd is -0.129 (p &lt; 0.05), and the coefficient of fd 2 is 0.032 (p &lt; 0.1). After adding the control variables, the results in column (2) hold that the coefficient of fd is -0.127 (p &lt; 0.05) and the coefficient of fd 2 is 0.037 (p &lt; 0.05). The results indicate a U-shaped relationship between regional integration and the regional energy efficiency gap.</p>
        <p>Comparing the results of columns ( 1) and ( 2), the addition of the control variables does not significantly change the coefficients of fd and f d 2 , and the significance of the coefficients is improved. We can infer that the relationship between regional integration and the regional energy efficiency gap is statistically reliable.</p>

        <p>Regarding the control variables, the coefficient of rcitysize is 0.512 (p &lt; 0.01), which indicates that the 1% increase in the city size gap of the city agglomeration will expend 0.512% regional energy efficiency gap within city agglomeration. It can be conducted that the widening gaps in city size within city agglomerations lead to increased regional energy efficiency gaps. The coefficient of rinvest is 0.004 (p &lt; 0.1), which means the 1% increase in the investment gap will narrow 0.004% regional energy efficiency gap within the city agglomeration. For rhum and rtrans, the coefficients are 0.007 (p &lt; 0.1) and 0.044 (p &lt; 0.1). The results indicate that the effect of the human capital gap and transportation gap on the regional energy efficiency gap is significantly positive. Every 1% increase in the human capital gap and transportation gap expands the regional energy efficiency gap by 0.007% and 0.044%.</p>
        <p>Table 4 reports the results of the test of the regulatory effect of government intervention, which can be assessed by the significance of the sign of the interaction term. Column (1) in Table 4 reports the regression results without control variables and interaction terms. Column (2) reports the regression results without interaction terms but contains control variables. Column (3) reports the regression results of the whole content of Eq. ( 2).</p>
        <p>Compared with the coefficients of fd and f d 2 , stronger government intervention leads to a smoother U-shaped relationship between regional integration and the regional energy efficiency gap within city agglomeration, respectively. Specifically, the increase in government intervention simultaneously reduces the effect of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap in both two stages of U-shaped relations. According to the aforementioned analysis, there are certain rules for the impact of government intervention, which always reduce the impact of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap. This is closely related to the characteristics of China's regional development. China's government has absolute control over regional economic development and environmental policies, which will have a substantial impact on market behavior (Ke, 2015). The impact of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap is a purely economic development process; thus, the government intervention will significantly impact this process. In this case, the impact of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap depends on the joint action of the market and the government (Yin et al., 2015). Change in the two forces changes the effect of the deepening of regional integration over a certain period.</p>
        <p>This paper attempts to analyze the influence of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap. Because of the scant research on the calculation of the regional energy efficiency gap within a small geographic scope, this paper uses an advanced SFA method based on a regional economic framework to measure the regional energy efficiency gap within city agglomeration. Subsequently, this paper examines the impact of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap within the city agglomeration and further explores the external effects of government intervention. First, the results of the five SFA models hold that the results based on TVEIM-SCEPI are more effective at reflecting the city-level energy efficiency in China. The results show that the average city-level OEE is only 0.422, which indicates that the effective energy utilization rate of Chinese cities is only 44.2%. Therefore, China has substantial energy conservation potential by improving city-level energy efficiency.</p>
        <p>Second, this paper applies the center-periphery theory to measure the regional energy efficiency gap within city agglomeration. Measuring the regional energy efficiency gap in this manner can more effectively reflect the energy efficiency gap within the city agglomeration and explore the impact of integration on the regional energy efficiency gap. The results show that the regional energy efficiency gap within 16 city agglomerations decreased in China from 2005 to 2017.</p>
        <p>Third, empirical results based on GMM indicate a significant Ushaped relationship between regional integration and the regional energy efficiency gap within city agglomeration. When the degree of regional integration is lower than 1.716, an improvement of the degree of regional integration can narrow the regional energy efficiency gap within city agglomeration. However, the improvement of the degree of regional integration expands the regional energy efficiency gap within city agglomeration when the degree of regional integration is higher than 1.716. The relationship between the two shows that the regional energy efficiency gap reduction effect from regional integration cannot persist. In summary, the reduction effect of the regional energy efficiency gap brought from regional integration cannot persist.</p>
        <p>Finally, the results of the interaction terms indicate that government intervention can significantly adjust the influence of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap. The expansion of government intervention will make the U-shaped relationship of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap more flatten, that is, reduce the impact of regional integration on the regional energy efficiency gap within city agglomeration.</p>
        <p>The findings of this research have important policy implications for regional energy and environmental policy decisions, energy conservation, and emission reduction. Firstly, for city agglomerations or regions with a low degree of regional integration, ensuring energy-related technologies, equipment, and funds circulate within the city agglomeration can effectively reduce the regional energy efficiency gap. For example, the level of regional integration of West Side of the Straits city agglomeration, Poyang Lake city agglomeration, and Taiyuan city agglomeration is relatively low. All three cities have well-established research and development (R&amp;D) centers, such as Xiamen in the West Side of the Straits city agglomeration, Changsha in the Poyang Lake city agglomeration, and Taiyuan in the Taiyuan city agglomeration. These</p>
        <p>Results of the regulatory effect of government intervention on the impact of regional integration on the city-level regional energy efficiency gap. city agglomerations can fully release the energy conservation potential of regional integration. Policymakers should consider relaxing the household registration policy in Xiamen, Changsha, and Taiyuan, which would ensure the circulation of R&amp;D personnel and the technology of the surrounding cities. Additionally, financial subsidies and tax preferences of the West Side of the Straits city agglomeration, the Poyang Lake city agglomeration, and the Taiyuan city agglomeration should not be excessively concentrated in Xiamen, Changsha, and Taiyuan. Through the aforementioned measures, the regional integration of those three city agglomerations can be more successfully promoted, and its regional energy efficiency gap can be further reduced to achieve energy conservation.</p>
        <p>Secondly, for city agglomerations or regions with a high degree of regional integration, promoting the use of renewable and clean energy can mitigate the adverse effects of regional integration. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei city agglomeration has achieved a high degree of regional integration. However, the pollution of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei city agglomeration is increasingly prominent. For such city agglomerations, further regional integration will increase the regional energy efficiency gap. In this case, replacing coal with natural gas and electricity in nearby cities in Beijing can effectively reduce the regional energy efficiency gap. Additionally, government financial subsidies and tax incentives should be biased toward some heavily polluted cities in Hebei, for example, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, and Handan. Through policy support, polluting companies in these cities can upgrade technology to increase energy conservation.</p>
        <p>Lastly, we recommend that other countries with considerable inequality in regional energy efficiency should take into account different regional integration levels among different regions when making energy policies. For regions with low levels of integration, the free circulation of energy-related capital, labor, and technology between peripheral and central cities is encouraged to narrow the energy efficiency gap. For regions with high levels of integration, moderate government interventions in allocating energy-related resources are suggested to reduce the likelihood of excessive resource accumulations in central cities. This, in the long-term, is conducive to mitigating the imbalance of energy efficiency and achieving an effective energy conservation goal.</p>
        <p>Reflected in Eq. ( 7), μ it denotes time-varying energy inefficiency rather than time-invariant energy inefficiency. Time-varying inefficiency is measured by the product of time-invariant inefficiency (μ i ) and the time trend effect (G(t)) in (10). For the specific forms of the time trend effect, there are three main forms based on the research of Kumbhakar et al. (2015): the time dummy form proposed by Lee (2006), the time decay form proposed by Battese and Coelli (1995), and the growth form proposed by Kumbhakar and Wang (2005). We suppose that the growth trend of energy efficiency is more suitable based on the research of Chen et al. (2017); thus, the exponential growth relationship between G(t) and t is applied in our research in Eq.</p>
        <p>(9). Eq. ( 10) and Eq. ( 11) represent the distribution of ν it and μ i . Based on Eqs. ( 7) to ( 11), μ it and city-level energy efficiency can be calculated from Eq.</p>
        <p>(12). Model 3 is EIM-SCE, which is specified as</p>
        <p>)</p>
        <p>)</p>
        <p>This model separates city effects from the error term comparing Model2. The difference is reflected in the setting of Eq. ( 13), where ω i is isolated and is not considered part of energy inefficiency. Eqs ( 14) to ( 16) represent the distribution assumptions for ν it , μ it and ω i . There are three ways to separate: true fixed-effects model (Greene, 2005), true random-effects model (Greene, 2005), and Wang and Ho (2010) model. Since the Wang and Ho (2010) model requires additional instrumental variables, and the results of the Hausman test of the frontier model support the use of the fixed-effect model, we finally choose a specific form of the true fixed-effects model. In this model, city-level energy efficiency can be estimated from Eq. ( 17).</p>
        <p>Model 4 is TVEIM-STI, which combines the inefficiency components of model 1 and Model 3. This model is specified as</p>
        <p>)</p>
        <p>)</p>
        <p>The distribution settings for ν it , μ it and ω i are shown in Eqs. ( 19) to (21). Both the time-invariant inefficiency and time-varying inefficiency are required in this model (Kumbhakar and Heshmati, 1995). Unlike Model 3, ω i is considered to be part of the energy inefficiency in Model4, which can be transformed into PEE. We follow the research of Kumbhakar and Heshmati (1995) to separate PEE and REE. Finally, OEE can be measured by the product of PEE and REE in Eq. ( 22).</p>
        <p>The final model is TVEIM-SCETI, which considers city effects based on Model 4. This model is specified as</p>
        <p>Compared with Models 3 and 4, model 5 considers both city effect η i and time-invariant energy inefficiency ω i . The distribution settings for ν it , μ it and ω i are shown in Eqs. ( 25) to (28). The estimation of model 5 can be divided into four steps (Kumbhakar and Heshmati, 1995). The first step is to estimate the coefficient of independent variables in the frontier model. The second step is to calculate μit through the Jondrow et al. (1982) estimator by using the standard SF technique, which can be transformed into REE in Eq. ( 30). The third step is to calculate ωi through the Jondrow et al. (1982) estimator by using the standard normal-half normal SF technique, which can be transformed into PEE in Eq. ( 29). The final step is to calculate OEE based on Eq. ( 31).</p>
        <p>Table A1 systematically summarizes the existing methods of using the SF model to measure energy efficiency. Considering that no method is available to lock in the most effective SFA model in advance, our study applies all the aforementioned five typical SFA analysis models to measure citylevel energy efficiency in China. Appendix 2</p>
        <p>To measure the city energy efficiency of China, the corresponding regression analysis is conducted to estimate the response parameters. Table A3 reports the scores of energy efficiency from five models. In terms of OEE: energy efficiency calculated by Model 4is the lowest (0.163), and energy efficiency calculated by Model 3is the highest (0.704). Unsurprisingly, the scores of energy efficiency from Model 3are high because the real fixed-effect model excludes all city heterogeneity when measuring inefficiency, which leads to high efficiency (Filippini and Zhang, 2016). For models 1, 2, and 5, the estimated OEE is at the middle level. Energy efficiency from Model 2(0.339) is slightly higher than that in model 1 (0.209), which holds that energy efficiency has been increasing in the past years because Model 3considers time-varying energy inefficiency. China's OEE has had an upward trend in the past decade (Chen et al., 2017). For Model 4, the OEE of model 5 is calculated by the product of PEE and REE, and the REE (0.777) of Model 4 is consistent with that of model 5. This indicates that low PEE (0.209) leads to the low OEE of model 5, which is also related to the neglected urban heterogeneity in model 5. According to the Jarque-Bera (JB) test, a lower statistic value means that the distribution is closer to the normal distribution, so the result calculated by model 5 is the closest to the normal distribution. A4 reports the results of the correlation analysis of energy efficiency estimated from different models. The energy efficiency from model 1 is highly related to Model 2(0.966) and Model 4(0.987). Despite the differences in the absolute values of energy efficiency calculated by these three models, they have high similarities in the distribution. Fig. A1 shows the bar graphs of the distribution of the measured results for models 1 to 5, and Fig. A2 further presents the kernel density distribution for models 1 to 5. 2. The abbreviations of the city agglomerations used in this figure are displayed in Table A5.</p>
        <p>industry in the urban "municipal area" is mainly industrial power consumption. The final reason is that coal is the main fuel of thermal power generation in China. According to the Research Report on Market Research and development trend of China's thermal power development volume in 2015-2020, the proportion of thermal power generation volume to total power generation volume in 2017 was 73.14% (Thermal power market analysis report, 2019). Therefore, it is reasonable to use industrial power to measure energy consumption to more effectively analyze the evolution of China's city-level energy efficiency.</p>
