        <p>In the present paper a multicriteria analysis of a Rankine Pumped Thermal Electricity Storage (PTES) system with low-grade thermal energy integration is performed. The system is composed by an ORC for the discharging phase and a high-temperature heat pump for the charging phase. As previously demonstrated, the low-grade thermal energy can be provided at the heat pump evaporator to boost the PTES performances. As regards the multi-criteria analysis, a tradeoff is required when electric-to-electric efficiency ηrt, total exergy exploitation efficiency ψut and energy density ρen, are maximized concurrently. By means of multi-objective optimization, theoretical performances of the system are derived in two different layouts, which differ for the presence or not of internal regeneration in charge and discharge subsystems. Results showed that regeneration can be very effective, as it relaxes the tradeoff between the objectives, thus yielding better global performances. Pareto fronts are built and explored to characterize the PTES system. Configurations of interest are proposed, and PTES performances are compared with other storage technologies. Theoretical results showed that, by exploiting thermal energy at temperature lower than 80 °C, ηrt ≈ 0.57 and ρen ≈ 17 kWh/m 3 can be concurrently achieved. This can be done at the cost of an inefficient exploitation of the thermal source, as ψut ≈ 0.07. If higher total exergy utilization efficiency is required, storage density can be still maintained high, but ηrt must drop down to 0.4. ρ density, [kJ/m 3 ] or [kg/m 3 ] τ heat source or heat pump operating time χ steam quality ψ exergy efficiency</p>

Introduction Pumped thermal electricity storage (PTES) is a broad definition which includes a group of technologies which are used to store electric energy as thermal energy. The charge phase is made with different heat pump technologies converting electric energy from renewable energy sources to thermal energy is stored as sensible or latent heat. The discharge phase is performed using different thermal engine technologies [1]. Most of the time, both hot and cold reservoirs are used, but sometimes one of the two is replaced by the environment, or by alternative heat sources [2,3]. Since the PTES mostly relies on well-known technologies (pumps, compressors, expanders, turbines and heat exchangers) that traditionally scale-up well, both in terms of size and cost, the PTES has been proposed as an alternative to Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES, whose name PTES voluntarily mimics) and to Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES). Compared to these two, PTES typically shows lower roundtrip efficiencies, but, since it does not rely on peculiar geographical configurations, like water reservoirs and geological cavities, it might have some strategical advantages over these technologies. Broadly speaking, PTES technologies can be divided into two main families and both come in with many slightly different configurations. The first family is based on Brayton cycles (direct and inverse), while the second is based on Rankine cycles (direct and inverse). As for Brayton PTES, the use of both dynamic (see [4], for example) and volumetric machineries [5] have been proposed. This storage technology is most often based on sensible heat storage, which is generally made up of solid materials like concrete, Al2O3 or others [6]. Brayton PTES has been extensively analyzed from the thermal, dynamic and economic point of views [7][8][9]. For storage materials, turbomachinery and working fluids, Brayton PTES has some similarities with the adiabatic CAES (ACAES), which stores compression excess heat similarly to PTES [10]. However, PTES relies more on storing the heat, rather than mechanical energy, so the hot reservoir is generally operated at much lower pressure than in CAES [1]. Although less common than the Brayton counterpart, Rankine PTES has been recently proposed and could be a valid alternative. Rankine PTES generally features higher energy density, due to the use of latent heat storage. The efficiencies practically achievable by the two versions are similar: for Rankine-based versions a roundtrip efficiency of 62% is claimed in [11,12], and of 65% in [13]. These figures are similar to those reported in [4] for the Brayton PTES. The most common Rankine PTES configuration relies on trans-critical and super-critical CO2 Heat Pumps (HPs) and CO2 Rankine cycles [11,12]. Additional modifications can be found in [13], where liquid piston nearly-isothermal compression and expansion are introduced. The concept of using Rankine cycles is not limited to CO2 configuration. For example, in [14] a cascaded NH3/Water vapor compression High Temperature HP (HTHP) is used for charging a hybrid sensible/latent heat storage, while the discharge phase is entrusted to a water steam cycle. Although the system proposed by [14] might result too complex to be feasible in practice 1 , it introduces the concept of integrating vapor compression HTHPs in PTES systems, which is very interesting. This opens the way for the exploitation of additional heat sources, leading to solutions which might be based on solutions like multi-temperature HPs [15], if the cold reservoir is to be maintained. Otherwise, the cold reservoir could be eliminated thanks to the integration of conventional vapor compression HTHPs, as proposed in [2,3]. Focusing on the application of vapor compression heat pumps in PTES systems, the idea is to decouple the temperature levels of the HP and of the heat engine, by using a low-grade heat source (Tsource ≤ 80 °C) to feed the HP evaporator. The energy provided by the heat source is then upgraded by the HP and stored in the hot reservoir. Heat upgrading is an emerging technique in the field of the industrial waste heat recovery, and some HTHPs especially designed for this purpose are already being commercialized [16,17]. In the discharge phase, the storage provides the stored heat to the engine, which later rejects it to the environment. The absence of the cold reservoir stems from the fact that the HP works between the low-grade heat source and the hot reservoir, so the cold reservoir cannot be "charged", and its role is then performed by the environment itself. Since maximum HTHP temperature level achievable in practice may reach 180 °C, this was assumed as the maximum temperature level of the storage in this configuration. Therefore, the engine technology must be selected among those suited for low-temperature waste-heat recovery. The most mature, widespread and performing of such technologies is represented by Organic Rankine Cycles (ORCs). Both HTHPs and ORCs are widely studied systems and these last years of research demonstrated how a proper choice of working fluid and cycle architecture may deeply affect their performance [18]. As far as PTES systems are concerned, charge and discharge devices must be optimized together, as the operational conditions which maximize HP COP are not those which maximize ORC efficiency, and vice versa. Since roundtrip efficiency depends on both, a trade-off must be achieved. similarly, the choice of working fluid pair cannot a priori rely on the fluids that are normally used for HTHPs and ORCs applications. In fact, the resulting cycle arrangements could mismatch when coupled together through the thermal storage. Nonetheless, fluid choice can be somewhat guided by previous researches and the pool of potential working fluids can be substantially restricted based on previous analysis, such as [18], where a detailed screening of HTHP working fluid performance is carried out. Likewise, if the basic architecture is to be modified, the choice can be realistically restricted to those architectures that already proved to bring advantages which overcome the additional expenditures. For both HTHPs and ORCs, such architectures, are those which feature internal regeneration [16,19]. Since these architectures are emerging as a new standard in HTHP and ORC applications, it can be concluded that they can be justified in terms of capital expenditure and performance increments. Therefore, a "regenerated" PTES is compared with the basic one in the analysis. The concept of Thermal Integration (TI), i.e. the use of low-grade heat sources to boost the performances of PTES systems, is briefly cited in [14,20], but the first in-depth analysis, has been performed in [3], to the best of the authors' knowledge. Additional details can be found also in [2]. Such papers ( [2,3]) deal with a particular TI-PTES concept, which is essentially the integration of additional low grade heat sources to eliminate PTES cold reservoir. Nonetheless, the opposite can be done, as reported in [21], where the use of the heat source to substitute the hot reservoir, while maintaining the cold one, has been investigated. In [2,3] a PTES system with vapor compression HTHP, regenerated ORC and ideal latent heat hot reservoir, was analyzed. Several combinations of HP and ORC working fluids were tested and maximum round-trip efficiency ηrt (defined as the ratio between the electric energy absorbed by the HP and that returned by the ORC) was calculated in function of the heat source and hot reservoir temperature levels. Although ηrt is of a paramount importance for storage systems, previous analyses are somewhat incomplete. As a matter of fact, if there is an integration between electric and thermal energy, different performance parameters, such as exergy efficiency, should be analyzed. This would allow a proper weighting for the contribution of each energy flux. Furthermore, previous results ( [2,3]) showed that, for a given heat source temperature, the lower the temperature difference between the source and the storage, the higher the performance in terms of ηrt are. In other words, if ηrt is to be maximized, the HP cycle tends to be as thin as possible, i.e. with the evaporation and condensation temperatures very close, in order to maximize the COP, up to the point where the PTES degenerates in a mere ORC. The ORC alone can only produce electric energy, so it cannot fulfil the PTES role of storing electric energy. For reasons that will be clarified in the following sections, similar considerations can also be drawn for the hot reservoir volume, and for the amount of thermal energy which is recovered (and not wasted) from the heat source. As a matter of fact, if PTES electric size is fixed, the storage volume tends to infinity when ηrt is maximized, hence the most efficient TI-PTES tends to have null energy density. The opposite is true for the amount of recovered thermal energy. When ηrt is maximized, the heat source exploitation is minimized and the TI-PTES not only degenerates towards an ORC, but it degenerates towards the ORC that have the maximum cycle efficiency allowed by the heat source temperature, which is also the ORC with the minimum net power output, i.e. zero. Obviously, these extreme configurations should be avoided by constraining variables and by setting minimum values for HP temperature lift and heat source glide, as done in [2,3]. Nonetheless, parameters such as exergy efficiency and energy density, other than the ηrt, are needed to fully characterize the proposed application. Since concurrent maximization of these parameters is not achievable in practice, the proper framework to characterize the PTES is the multi-criteria analysis. Therefore, a multi-objective optimization has been performed to fully explore the TI-PTES performance potentialities and limitations. In this study, a recently proposed TI-PTES configuration, which exploits a low-grade heat source (Tsrc ≤ 80 °C) and is made up of a vapor compression HTHP and an ORC, is analyzed in respect of three parameters, namely electric roundtrip efficiency, energy density and exergy efficiency. The analysis is performed by means of a multi-objective optimization which involves, among the other variables, the HTHP and ORC temperature levels and working fluids.</p>
        <p>The main contribution of this paper is in the extensive thermodynamic characterization of a recently proposed PTES configuration, which provides original insights on the performances and limitations of these innovative electric energy storage systems.</p>
        <p>Cycle architecture PTES systems are usually composed by a HP, a thermal storage and a thermal engine. In the analysis, a vapor compression heat pump, a two-reservoir sensible heat storage and an ORC are assumed for the HP, the hot reservoir and the thermal engine, respectively. Sensible heat storage is less efficient and dense, if compared to latent heat storage. Despite this, it is still not clear if stable and reliable latent heat storages can be currently deployed in the temperature range of interest (100 °C -180 °C) [22,23]. In addition, latent heat storage is still an immature technology whose cost turn out to be prohibitive in the current practice. For these reasons, sensible heat storage is selected. Two-reservoir configuration guarantees almost constant charge and discharge profiles at the cost of doubling the storage volume. The selection between two-reservoir and single-reservoir thermal storage is a trade-off between cost and efficiency and can only be solved with a thermo-economic optimization of the system. Such analysis is out of the scope of this paper, so just the most efficient solution between the two is selected. In addition to basic PTES configuration, also a modified architecture is proposed and investigated. In comparison to basic configuration, both HTHP and ORC are internally regenerated, then two additional heat exchangers are introduced in the system. Again, whether the regeneration should be introduced in the system, is only a matter of thermo-economic analysis. The regenerated configuration outperforms the basic one, but it also entails higher capital expenditures. Since only a thermodynamic assessment is performed here, a final recommendation upon which system is better is not provided, and only relative performance increases between the two configurations are presented. A graphical representation of the analyzed configurations is reported in Figure 1 (a) and (b) for the basic architecture and the regenerated one, respectively. Both HTHP and ORC performance is affected by a number of parameters (isentropic efficiencies, heat exchanger approach points, etc.) which are assumed to be constant in the analysis. The numerical values assumed for these parameters are reported in Table 1 and 2 for the HTHP and the ORC, respectively. Some of the listed parameters directly affect the subsystem performances, whereas others are included into the analysis because they represent technical constraints which must be satisfied to provide a realistic representation of the system. Among the latter, Tmax,hp, pmin,hp and pmin,orc set maximum and minimum values for temperatures and pressures achievable in the system. These limitations stem from the fact that in current HTHP practice the compressor discharge temperature is limited to 180 °C to prevent lubricant oil degradation [24]. Of course, if oil free compressors are used, this limitation does not hold anymore. Despite this, not much higher temperatures may be achieved anyway, since several HTHP working fluids start to show thermal decomposition over 200 °C [18]. Since HTHP compressor discharge temperature is the higher temperature achieved by the whole system, a limitation on this parameter automatically set a limitation on maximum storage and ORC temperatures. As far as pmin,hp and pmin,orc are concerned, some authors recommend aboveatmospheric conditions for obvious reasons [25]. Despite that, a low degree of vacuum can be accepted, especially for small-sized systems where the heat exchanger dimension are moderate [18]. For this reason, 0.5 bar is set as the minimum achievable value in both the HTHP evaporator and ORC condenser. Finally, for the calculation of some performance indicators, such as exergy efficiency, HTHP charge time τhp in hours is needed. Such figure should not be decided a priori, as it should be calculated by considering thermal energy and electric energy availability, and electric energy prices. Given these assumptions, the storage charge/discharge profile is usually optimized to maximize some objective function, which often is the economic revenue (for a similar analysis in the case of battery storage, see [26,27]). Such analysis is out of the scope of the present study, so an arbitrary numeric value equal to 4 h is assumed for τhp. Despite being arbitrary, this value is realistic in the electric storage practice [26,28], as it is essentially related to the shape of the electric energy price daily trend. ORC condensation heat load is assumed to be rejected into environment by means of an air condenser. Therefore, the fan electric consumption is computed and cut out from the gross ORC power output. The fan consumption is a function of the pressure drop across the heat exchanger Δpfan and the fan "efficiency" ηfan which accounts for the conversion chain between electric power and mechanical power transmitted to the fluid. Other relevant modeling assumptions are: pressure drop in heat exchangers are neglected, steady state operation is analyzed, environmental reference temperature T0 is assumed to be equal to 20 °C and storage thermal losses are considered through a fixed thermal efficiency ηst equal to 0.95.</p>
        <p>Performance parameters Performance of a storage can be measured according to several parameters, but the most important one is the electric-to-electric efficiency (or round-trip efficiency, or back-work ratio) ηrt. For traditional electric storage technologies (i.e. batteries, flywheels, PHES, etc.) ηrt coincides also with first-law and second-law efficiencies, which is not the case for hybrid storage technologies like the TI-PTES. For these systems, ηrt is still important, because it is related with the economic revenue of the storage and its operating costs. Nonetheless, since also some thermal energy is absorbed, a different formulation of the efficiency may be considered. It could seem natural to directly select classical exergy efficiency formulation, but this would imply that the thermal energy is exactly available when needed. This is certainly possible, but it would require either to produce the thermal energy with fossil fuels or electric energy (which is a nonsense), or to store the thermal energy provided by the heat source to make it available on request. In this case, the heat could certainly be produced with solar collectors or by exploiting geothermal or waste heat sources, but at least an additional thermal storage, if not a solar collector field, should be added to the systems in Figure 1 (a) and (b). Furthermore, a fair comparison between the TI-PTES and other more traditional storage technologies is based on the fact that the heat source thermal energy is considered as "readily available", which is actually a way to say "for free" (or at least "really cheap"). This not certainly apply to the case in which the heat is provided by a geothermal well or by a field of solar collectors, which are both quite expensive heat sources. This does not exclude the fact that such applications might be very interesting, but a tecno-economic assessment would be mandatory in these cases, since the economic viability of such system would be the major concern. In short, by choosing the straightforward exergy efficiency formulation, the perfect contemporaneity between thermal and electric energy availabilities is implicitly assumed. This can be difficultly assumed without either adding some pieces of equipment, or by including into the analysis an economic assessment. To get rid of the contemporaneity hypothesis, it must be accepted that some losses will occur on the heat source side. To do so, it is assumed that the heat is provided for τsrc hours, but it is exploited only for τhp hours. To conservatively assess TI-PTES performances, τsrc is assumed to be equal to 24 h, while τhp is equal to 4 h, as reported in Table 1. In other words, the TI-PTES exploits the heat source for one sixth of the total available time.</p>
        <p>To limit the analysis to the systems reported in Figure 1 (a) and (b), while also providing results that can be used for a fair comparison between TI-PTES and other storage technologies, the heat source is assumed to be waste heat. As already pointed out, this is the only case in which the provided amount of thermal energy could be considered as "readily available", i.e. "for free". Based on the energy fluxes between TI-PTES subsystems reported on Figure 2, the metrics to measure PTES performances are defined as follows. The first parameter is the roundtrip efficiency ηrt which accounts for the ratio between the absorbed and returned amounts of electric energy by the HTHP and the ORC, respectively. Based on Figure 2, and considering previous analysis from [2,3], the following holds (Eq. 1):</p>
        <p>By considering Figures 1 (a) and (b) layouts and commonly accepted definitions for COP and ηorc, it can be written (Eq. 2):</p>
        <p>Where Δhhp,cmp and Δhhp,cd are the enthalpy differences across the HTHP compressor and condenser, respectively. As regards to ηorc (Eq. 3):</p>
        <p>where Δhorc,exp, Δhorc,pmp, Δhorc,cd and Δhorc,ev are the enthalpy differences across the ORC expander, pump, condenser and evaporator, respectively. cpair and ρair are the specific heat and the density of air averaged between Tair,out and Tair,in.</p>
        <p>The exergy efficiency ψut can be defined as in Eq. 4:</p>
        <p>where Exorc, Exsrc and Exhp are the exergy amounts which are absorbed, or delivered, by ORC, heat source and HTHP, respectively. By applying energy balances on the subsystems, COP definition and Eq. 1, Exorc, Exsrc and Exhp can be rewritten as in Eq. 5 -7:</p>
        <p>where, T0 = 20 °C is the reference temperature, ΔT0 = Tsrc,max -T0 is the maximum potential cooling of the heat source and 𝑚̇𝑠 𝑟𝑐 and cpsrc are the heat source fluid mass flow rate and specific heat at constant pressure, averaged between the heat source maximum and minimum temperatures Tsrc,max and Tsrc,min. Finally, for Exhp it can be written:</p>
        <p>• 𝜏 ℎ𝑝 (7) where ΔTsrc = Tsrc,max -Tsrc,min. By substituting Eq. 5, 6 and 7 in Eq 4, the following can be achieved (Eq. 8):</p>
        <p>The last parameter to measure system performance is the energy density ρen measured in kWh/m 3 . ρen is useful to account for relative dimension of the system. For the same reason why it is important to include ψut in the analysis, ρen can provide useful insights on the implicit trade-offs that must be accepted in order to maximize ηrt. Storage maximum and minimum temperatures Tstg,max and Tstg,min are comprised between HTHP condensation and evaporation temperature levels, as the storage is charged by the HP condenser. In a tworeservoir sensible heat storage, the energy per unit of fluid volume is inversely proportional to the temperature difference between the two reservoir, which is ΔTstg = Tstg,max -Tstg,min. Therefore, if ρen is to be maximized, also ΔTstg should be maximized. However, ΔTstg is limited by the HTHP lift, which tends to be minimized in order to maximize ηrt. this means that for a TI-PTES system ηrt and ρen are competing objectives. Since TI-PTES is a stationary storage, ρen is certainly a secondary parameter but a very low value of ρen entails very large storage volumes, and this can make system costs grow. Furthermore, a very large thermal storage has also a very large surface area and this entails larger thermal losses, which should be avoided to maximize PTES performance.</p>
        <p>In the present analysis, ρen is defined as the ratio between the share of the stored energy that can be effectively converted into electric energy, and the storage volume in m 3 . Therefore, it can be written as in Eq. 9:</p>
        <p>where ρstg and cpstg are the density and the constant pressure specific heat of thermal storage fluid. The storage is assumed to use slightly pressurized water, but thermal oil could be used as well, if cheaper alternatives are to be pursued. In this case, the energy density numerical value would change, but the general trend of ρen and its trade-off with ηrt would maintain the same physical meaning. It is worth mentioning that since a double reservoir solution is used, a ½ factor could be multiplied to ρen, if in Eq. 9 the total volume, and not the active volume, is considered. Like said before, this would change the numerical value of ρen, but not the physical meaning of its trade-off with ηrt.</p>
        <p>To extensively explore the trade-off between ηrt, ψut and ρen, a multi-objective optimization approach is followed. The TI-PTES is designed in a flexible way, such that its design parameters can be adjusted to promote one of the listed metrics. In other words, the TI-PTES design is performed through an optimization problem, which have HTHP, ORC and storage design parameters as variables. In order to give a realistic representation of the physical system some constraints must be enforced. They represents physical and technical limitations like heat exchanger pinch points, minimum achievable pressure in HTHP evaporator and ORC condenser, etc. For the TI-PTES non-regenerated configuration reported in Figure 1 (a), optimization variables are:</p>
        <p> Tsrc,min, minimum cooling temperature achieved by the source while providing heat to the HTHP;  Thp,ev, Thp,cd, ΔThp,sh and ΔThp,sc, HTHP evaporation and condensation temperatures, as well as superheating and subcooling at the evaporator and condenser exit, respectively;  Torc,ev, Torc,cd and ΔTorc,sh, ORC evaporation and condensation temperatures, as well as superheating at the evaporator exit;  Tstg,max and Tstg,min, storage maximum and minimum temperature. If the internal regeneration is introduced, an additional optimization variable must be used:</p>
        <p> ΔTorc,rg, temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of the hot side of the ORC regenerator. Although HPs and ORCs are quite "symmetrical" systems, such that some authors investigated reversible configurations [29][30][31], the HTHP and ORC modelling proposed here is not perfectly symmetrical. Subcooling and regeneration can be managed differently from the optimization point of view in HTHPs and in ORCs. In particular, ΔTorc,sc it is assumed, and not optimized, because it is a necessary ORC feature to prevent pump cavitation, but it is usually minimized because it does not have any positive effects on the efficiency. Likewise, there is no need to optimize ΔThp,rg as the internal regeneration in HTHP is used to provide the superheating at the evaporator exit. Therefore, the influential variable is still ΔThp,sh, from which ΔThp,rg can be readily calculated through the HTHP regenerator energy balance. As far as the constraints are concerned, in non-regenerated configuration the problem has 20 bound constraints, 8 linear constraints and 9 non-linear constraints. In regenerated configuration the problem has 22 bound constraints, 8 linear constraints and 13 non-linear constraints. Due to the high number of constraints, the complete list is reported in Appendix A. The constraints enforce some relations that must be respected due to the physical phenomena that characterize the PTES system. A large part of both linear and non-linear constraints is dedicated to the observance of heat exchangers pinch points. Two non-linear constraints guarantee that the HTHP has an entirely dry compression and that the ORC expansion ends with a vapor quality higher than 0.85. Some bound constraints guarantee that neither maximum allowable temperatures, nor minimum allowable pressures are exceeded, while some other enforce subcritical working conditions to HTHP and ORC cycles. If only one parameter among ηrt, ψut and ρen is to be maximized, the resulting optimization problem has a scalar objective function, and it can be potentially solved with any non-linear programming technique. In the analysis a SQP algorithm has been used, as implemented in [32]. Even though the problem is not smooth in theory, as reported in Appendix A, where it is shown that some constraints are based on min(•) and max(•) functions, in practice the problem is sufficiently smooth to be solved with an algorithm based on derivatives. The same can be said for the use of CoolProp [33] and REFPROP [34] to evaluate HTHP and ORC fluid thermophysical properties. Each evaluation is based on the numerical solution of the fluid equation of state and this make the objective function a black box, which can be numerically evaluated, but does not have derivatives. Nevertheless, the numerical evaluation of gradients and hessians is possible due to the general smoothness of thermophysical properties which makes the problem solvable with gradient-based approaches. The design optimization problem is highly non-linear, without an analytical representation and non-convex, most likely. To try to prevent the optimizer from converging on local minima, a multi-start strategy is adopted, and each optimization is repeated 10 times, from different initial points. A higher number of starting points do not significantly improve the solution, then the optima found through this procedure have been considered as global optima. When the optimal trade-off between ηrt, ψut and ρen is to be investigated, the objective function becomes a vector function. In this case, a common approach is to "scalarize" the problem, by converting it back to a single objective problem. Several scalarization techniques have been proposed in literature, and that used here is the scalarizing approach based on reference points proposed by Wierzbicki [35] and reported also more recently in [36]. The resulting problem has the same set of constraints of the single objective problem, reported in Appendix A, and it can be solved with the same algorithmic approach, but it has a modified objective function, as follows in Eq. 10:</p>
        <p>𝑖 (10) where f(x) = [ηrt(x), ψut(x), ρen(x)] is the objective vector, fref = [𝜂̅ 𝑟𝑡 , 𝜓 ̅ 𝑢𝑡 , 𝜌̅ 𝑒𝑛 ] is an arbitrary point in the objective space to be achieved and α = 10 -4 is an arbitrary constant, often called augmentation coefficient. α multiplies the augmentation term of fobj, and its purpose is to rule out weakly-Pareto points. By minimizing fsf, the reference point gets "projected" onto the Pareto front and the resulting optimal x yields one point of the Pareto front. By varying fref, the Pareto front can be explored and the optimal trade-off between ηrt, ψut and ρen investigated.</p>
        <p>Working fluid Pair selection A good share of research activities on HTHP and ORC is dedicated to the choice of best suited working fluid, as demonstrated also by [16,18]. Even in the case of TI-PTES, the choice of working fluid pair is an open problem. In the case of latent heat storage, some recommendations can be found in [2,3], but the use of a sensible heat storage brings up new challenges from the point of view of HTHP and ORC thermal profiles integration, and the working fluid pair must be re-evaluated for this new architecture. The working fluid pairs could be optimized together with the rest of the PTES system, but this would lead to a mixed-integer non-linear problem, with an increased complexity. To avoid this, a representative subset of working fluids is selected and exhaustively investigated by iteratively optimizing all the possible couples. The investigated fluids are selected among a pool of natural and artificial refrigerants which are promising for both HTHPs and low temperature ORCs. Based on previous researches [16,18,37], the investigated fluids are: Cyclo-Pentane, Pentane, R1233zd(E), R1224yd(Z), R245fa, R1336mzz(Z), R365mfc and R1234ze(Z). All these fluids show good performance when used for HTHP and ORC in the investigated temperature range. Besides that, they all have very low GWP (less than 5), except for R245fa and R365mfc, which have GWP equal to 804 and 1030 [16,38]. Even if R245fa and R365mfc have a non-negligible environmental impact, their use is still allowed. Therefore, most of the commercial HTHP systems propose the R245fa as working fluid [16,17]. All the selected fluids can be used in HTHP and ORC systems from all the technical points of view (material compatibility, thermal decomposition and safety standard), as discussed in [18]. Whenever possible, the thermophysical properties of the fluids are evaluated using the software 
            <rs type="software">CoolProp</rs> v. 
            <rs type="version">6.2.0</rs> [33]. Otherwise, for the fluids still not implemented in 
            <rs type="software">CoolProp</rs>, i.e. R1336mzz(Z) and R1224yd(Z), 
            <rs type="software">REFPROP</rs> v. 
            <rs type="version">10.0</rs> [34] is used.
        </p>
        <p>Working fluid pair selection The exhaustive investigation of all the possible working fluid pairs leads to identify the most performant fluid arrangements in terms of the three parameters ηrt, ψut and ρen for both the regenerated and non-regenerated layouts. For the sake of brevity, the complete set of results is reported in Table B1 and B2 of Appendix B, while the most performing couples are reported in Table 3. As resulted, Cyclopentane is the recommended fluid to achieve high efficiency. If ηrt is to be maximized, Cyclopentane is always recommended for the HTHP, for both regenerated and non-regenerated configuration. This is supported also by previous studies, which identify Cyclopentane as one of the most efficient fluid for the use in HTHP in the investigated temperature range [18]. As can be noted from Tables 3, B1 and B2, ρen is not influenced by HTHP fluid choice. This stems from the fact that ρen is defined such that none of the HTHPrelated variables play an explicit role on its computation (see Eq. 9). Despite this, every optimization problem is solved by considering the same set of constraints, which do take HTHP-related variables into account. Therefore, ρen can be influenced, at least in theory, by the HTHP fluid choice. However, this does not happen in the practice. A possible reason for this is that none of HTHP fluids reaches the minimum allowed pressure at a temperature that poses any limitation on the storage temperature difference ΔTstg. This is relevant because ΔTstg must be maximized in order to maximize ρen, as previously discussed. Likewise, none of the HTHP fluids have a critical temperature low enough to pose a higher bound on ΔTstg. This is because, within certain limits, a lower Tcrit can be compensated by modifying the rest of the HTHP cycle. In conclusion, ρen is limited by HTHP specifications which does not depend on the fluid. This is an indirect confirmation that the investigated fluids are well suited to be integrated in the considered temperature range. When regenerated layout is considered, R1336mzz(Z) is one of the best fluids, as it maximizes ψut and ρen and, as shown in Table B2, it achieves also a quite high ηrt. By comparing Table B1 and B2, it is clear that the R1336mzz(Z) is a performant fluid only if used in conjunction with internal regeneration. In non-regenerated case R1336mzz(Z) is one of the worst fluids, together with R1224yd(Z) and R245fa. This is most likely due to the high slope of saturated vapor boundary line in T-s plane, which forces HTHP cycle to use high superheating after the evaporation to ensure a totally dry compression. Without the regeneration, which decouples superheating (i.e. ΔThp,sh) from heat source temperatures, the resulting HTHP cycle is forced to have higher temperature lifts, and thus lower COPs. This happens because both evaporation and superheating must occur at lower temperature, being bounded by the heat source. Conversely, when regeneration is adopted, superheating can be increased without being limited by heat source temperatures and without affecting evaporation temperature, within certain limits. Compared to Cyclopentane, R1336mzz(Z) has lower electric-to-electric efficiency but it could still be the preferred alternative, for an actual TI-PTES implementation, depending on the compressor technology that is used. R1336mzz(Z) has much higher volumetric heating capacity than Cyclopentane [16,18], which leads to much lower volumetric flowrates, as the thermal capacity of the system is fixed. Low volumetric flow rates are required in case of volumetric compressors, while this limitation is typically less severe for centrifugal compressors.</p>
        <p>Similar considerations might also be drawn for ORC expander technology, but the value assumed for ηis,exp (Table 2) are more consistent with dynamic expanders.</p>
        <p>In the practice, working fluid choice would be based on a much broader reasoning than that provided by the thermodynamic analysis conducted here. A detailed techno-economic analysis cannot be avoided in this context. Therefore, when comparing two fluids, it is worth remembering that their differences are more than those analyzed here.</p>
        <p>In Table 3 the results concerning the performance increment due to regeneration introduction are reported.</p>
        <p>Regeneration is beneficial for all the three monitored performance parameters. However, the regeneration is not very effective in respect to ηrt, while for ψut and ρen higher increments are achieved. On the other hand, high ηrt relative increments (over 10%) are achieved in some specific cases, like for R1336mzz(Z), R365mfc and Pentane. The same fluids are also those that show the highest ρen increments, thus suggesting that a major share of the ηrt increase is due to increments in ηorc (that affects both ηrt and ρen).</p>
        <p>Regeneration is very effective in regards of ρen, both by comparing regenerated and non-regenerated best values and by comparing single fluid values. This stems from the fact that the regeneration boosts ηorc, by making it less sensitive to storage temperature profile. In other words, regeneration allows ΔTstg to be increased, without ηorc being too much compromised. By comparing the increease in ηrt, ψut and ρen reported in Table B3 with the slopes of the saturated vapor phase boundary line reported in Figure B1, it can be observed that there is a strong correlation between regeneration effectiveness and saturated vapor line slope. In other words, the more the saturation line is inclined, the higher is the regeneration benefit. A partial exception is Cyclopentane, whose saturation line is relevantly inclined if the whole T-s plane is considered. Despite this, the Cyclopentane is the fluid that receives less benefits from regeneration. This is because, differently from the other investigated fluids, Cyclopentane has the critical temperature much higher than the investigated PTES temperature levels. Within the temperatures investigated here, Cyclopentane has rather vertical saturated vapor line, so it locally behaves like an isentropic fluid (i.e. like R1234ze(Z)) and not like a dry fluid, as it is. These last considerations and the values reported in Table B3 for ηrt and ρen increments suggest that most of performance increases are related to the ORC regeneration, and not the HTHP regeneration. The reason why this happens will be clarified later, when some examples of HTHP and ORC cycles will be presented. It can be anticipated that, since the configurations that maximize ηrt are also those which work with the lowest possible HTHP temperature lift, the resulting HP cycle is already very "thin", and the regeneration cannot help in making this cycle even thinner. This is also reflected in the mathematical model, where the HP lift is bounded to avoid very low temperature lifts. This might make HTHP operation unstable, since little temperature variations might lead to huge COP variations, as the mathematical relation between COP and Temperature lift is very steep when this last is approaching zero. Similar considerations may be drawn for the case which maximizes ρen. In this case, most of HTHP performance is traded in favor of the ORC, and this means that HP lift tends to be large. As far as the regeneration is concerned, since ηorc is to be maximized, HTHP condensation already works at its maximum operational temperature Thp,max, then the regeneration cannot further increase this value. Therefore, HTHP regeneration alone would not be able increase ρen.</p>
        <p>A different situation can be observed in Table B3 for ψut increments. In this case, the additional degree of freedom provided to the HTHP cycle by regeneration makes a difference, and ψut increments depend on the HTHP operational conditions and selected fluid. The highest increases are still registered by those fluids whose saturation line is steeper, i.e. R1336mzz(Z), R365mfc, R1224yd(Z), Pentane, and R245fa, because these fluids might require a superheating degree at the evaporator exit higher than usual to ensure dry compression, as discussed before. Nonetheless, also "isentropic" fluids like Cyclopentane and R1234ze(Z) are affected by relevant increments (roughly between 15% and 20%), often comparable with the other abovementioned fluids. Now that the "extreme" TI-PTES configuration have been investigated both in regenerated and nonregenerated cases, the analysis can be narrowed down to the fluid pairs that perform the best. Since from Table 3 no clear winners can be selected, the working fluid choice is arbitrary and it is based on the relative weight that are assigned to ηrt, ψut and ρen. Since the trade-off between the three is to be investigated, balanced fluid pairs are here preferred, not to penalize from the beginning one parameter over another.</p>
        <p>A mathematical way to translate this is to assign to each fluid pair a score, based on the weighted sum of the values of ηrt, ψut and ρen. To get rid of differences in scale, the values reported in Tables B1 and B2 are normalized, by using their maximum values, reported in Table 3. Since no preference among the parameters is expressed here, the weights are all the same (so any arbitrary value can be chosen). The score SC can be calculated as in Eq. 11:</p>
        <p>Where Wi are the weights. The outcome of this calculation led to identify the pair Cyclopentane -Cyclopentane as recommended for non-regenerated case, and the pair R1336mzz(Z) -R1336mzz(Z) as recommended for regenerated case.</p>
        <p>In Figure 3 (ac) non-regenerated configurations which maximize ηrt, ψut and ρen for the pair Cyclopentane -Cyclopentane pair are reported. Similarly, in Figure 3 (df) regenerated configurations for the pair R1336mzz(Z) -R1336mzz(Z) are reported. In Figure 3, many of already commented TI-PTES features can be confirmed. The configurations that maximize ηrt (a and d) show minimum HTHP temperature lift. As expected, HP cycle is as thin as possible to maximize the COP, to the detriment of the ORC performance. Therefore, COP is preferred over ηorc, from the roundtrip efficiency point of view. This is not because ηrt does not depend on ηorc, but because relative increments of COP are much higher than those of ηorc, in the investigated temperature levels. For the very same reason, as already discussed, in the case in which a lower limit for HTHP lift is not given, the TI-PTES degenerates towards an ORC. Conversely, the configurations which maximize ψut (b and e) have maximum HTHP lift. In this case, HTHP condensation and evaporation are bounded by Thp,max and environmental temperature T0, respectively. Maximum lifts allow the maximum recovering of thermal energy from heat source. Anyway, since in ψut mathematical expression ηrt is also present (Eq. 8), to counterbalance the loss of COP from HTHP side, ηorc must be maximized. Accordingly, ORC cycle has the maximum temperature difference between evaporation and condensation, to achieve maximum ηorc. In both regenerated and non-regenerated cases, ORC is limited upward by HTHP condensation temperature profile, and downward by T0. Finally, for the configuration which maximize ρen, reported in Figure 3 (c andf), it can be seen how the HTHP highest temperature is set at its maximum (Thp,max), to maximize Tstg,max and thus ΔTstg. Conversely, ORC evaporation temperature it is not maximized, as previously done for the case of ψut. This happens because there is a trade-off between Torc,ev, which should be increased for increasing ηorc, and Tstg,min, which should be minimized to increase ΔTstg and optimization algorithm finds the optimal trade-off between the two. In this context, the value of Thp,ev has little influence, so an evaporation temperature that allows the condensation reaches Thp,max at the compressor exit is selected. This is the fundamental feature of the HTHP cycle from the ρen point of view, so the cycle is modified accordingly to guarantee that. For the maximization of ψut, ORC regeneration allows a certain decoupling between minimum storage temperature Tstg,min and ORC evaporation temperature. As a result, the evaporation temperature level can be increased, thus increasing also ηorc, while Tstg,min remains low. Once the two working fluid pairs have been selected, the trade-off between ηrt, ψut and ρen can be fully explored. Before doing that, some preliminary conclusions can be drawn:</p>
        <p> As reported in Table 3, for the non-regenerated architecture, values around 0.6, 0.18 and 13 kWh/m 3 can be achieved for ηrt, ψut and ρen. Conversely, for the regenerated architecture values around 0.65, 0.21 and 18 kWh/m 3 can be achieved for ηrt, ψut and ρen. Noticeably, those values cannot be achieved with the same layout as the three objectives are competing one among each other. Therefore, a tradeoff solution must be searched;  Regeneration can be very effective in increasing the PTES performance, depending on the monitored parameter: ρen showed the best relative increase, equal to around 35%, followed by ψut, which showed a relative increase around 15%. ηrt resulted as the least affected parameters by the regeneration, with a relative increase around 6.5%. This difference lies in the fact that the cycle architectures which maximize ηrt and ψut have already reached the limitations imposed by the model (i.e. maximum and minimum temperature levels). Therefore, the introduction of additional degrees of freedom is not very effective. This is not the case of ρen in which the required trade-off between storage and ORC evaporation temperature profiles is relaxed by the additional degree of freedom provided by the regeneration;  Results showed that the regeneration on the ORC side is more effective than that on the HTHP side. This is suggested by Table B3 where it is shown that relative increments related to ηrt and ρen do not depend on the HTHP fluid choice;</p>
        <p> If working fluid pairs that perform well on each figure of merit are to be selected, for non-regenerated layout Cyclopentane should be used, for both HTHP and ORC, while for regenerated layout, the same can be said for R1336mzz(Z).</p>
        <p>The investigation of optimal trade-off between ηrt, ψut and ρen is performed by solving the optimization problem with objective function reported in Eq. 10, which is subjected to the constraints reported in Appendix A. Each optimization gives the coordinates of a Pareto front point, which is the "projection" onto the front of reference point specified in Eq. 10. By moving the reference point, the entire Pareto front can be explored by sampling new points. Reference points specification is arbitrary and here a regularly spaced grid of points covering all the interesting combinations among ηrt, ψut and ρen is used. The range of variations covered by reference points is based on the maximum and the minimum values of ηrt, ψut and ρen achieved with the three single objective optimizations.</p>
        <p>In other words, to construct the reference point grid, the maximum and the minimum values of the pay-off table reported in Table 4 are used. These ηrt, ψut and ρen values are those characterizing the configurations previously reported in Figure 3 (af).</p>
        <p>Once that a satisfactory representation of Pareto front has been built, there is the need for a criterium to choose, among all the non-dominated solutions, the one that satisfy an arbitrary order of preference among the objectives (i.e. ηrt, ψut and ρen). This order of preference, which is no more than a hierarchy of importance between objectives, is usually specified by means of weights, which reflect Decision Maker (DM) preferences. The decision-making criterium assumed here is the well-known TOPSIS [39], which is one of the most common criterium and it is often used in the energy field [40].</p>
        <p>For the sake of brevity, only three weight sets W1-3 are investigated (Eq. 12):</p>
        <p>As can be seen, W1 specifies the case in which all the three parameters are equally important, while W2 and W3 specify two case in which only two parameters are important, while the third is disregarded. In this last case, only the trade-off between two parameters is considered, and the third parameter is left to be chosen accordingly. W2 represents the case in which energy density is not considered a problem, according to the point of view for which energy density is a secondary feature for a static storage system. Conversely, W3 represents the case in which ψut is not considered as important, if compared to the efficient use of electric energy inputs (i.e. ηrt) and energy density. In other words, this is the case in which the heat provided by the heat source is considered not valuable, from both economic thermodynamic point of views. The case in which ηrt is disregarded is not investigated as it is considered of no practical interest. The Pareto points, and the three configurations which are chosen by specifying W1-3, are reported in Figure 4 (a) for the non-regenerated layout and in Figure 5 (a) for the regenerated one. Conversely, in Figure 4 (b) and 5 (b) the ratios between the achieved ηrt, ψut and ρen and their respective ideal values, i.e. maximum values reported in Table 4, are reported for non-regenerated and regenerated layout, respectively. In both regenerated and non-regenerated cases, by specifying different weights, solutions well spread over the front are obtained. This can be either a positive or a negative feature, since it means that TI-PTESs are flexible systems, which can be tuned to promote the merit figure of interest. On the other hand, well-spread solutions mean that the trade-off between ηrt, ψut and ρen is strong, then it is impossible to have a system that performs well in respect to all the performance parameters. In other words, high performance for ηrt, ψut and ρen could be achieved, but at the cost of having poor performance according the other two. One of the most significant differences between regenerated and non-regenerated cases can be observed by analyzing the Pareto front projection in the ηrtψut plane of Figures 4 (a) and 5 (a). In the non-regenerated case, the front projection is spread over a significant plane portion, suggesting that a non-negligible loss of performance is required, for having satisfactory values of ρen. This happens because the best combinations that can be achieved by only considering ηrt and ψut, are those non-dominated among the front projection. These combinations correspond to the bi-dimensional Pareto front that would have been found if only ηrt and ψut were considered. These combinations do not have the best ρen, since the objectives are competing. Thus, to achieve better ρen, the selected point must be vertically moved along the Pareto front surface. This tridimensional movement results in a bi-dimensional movement on the ηrtψut plane, that points away from the bidimensional pareto front towards worse ηrt and ψut trade-offs.</p>
        <p>In the regenerated case, front projection is almost collapsed over a line. This means that Pareto front surface is much steeper than in the non-regenerated case. Therefore, the trade-off between non-dominated combinations selected only according to ηrt and ψut, and those selected considering also ρen, is weaker than in non-regenerated case.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, being equal ηrt and ψut, higher values are expected for ρen in the regenerated case, than in the non-regenerated one. This is valid in absolute terms, since regeneration naturally yields higher densities, as discussed before, but also in relative terms, when ηrt, ψut and ρen are compared with their respective ideal counterparts. This conclusion is confirmed by the results reported in Figures 4 (b) and 5 (b) where it is clearly visible how, for similar relative values of ψut and ρen, higher relative values of ηrt are achieved by the regenerated configuration. The most significant results, from this point of view, are those related with W3. In this case, by passing from non-regenerated to regenerated layout, the ratio between ηrt and ηrt,id changes from 0.6 to 0.9, while the ratio between ψut and ψut,id changes only from 0.4 to 0.3 and that between ρen and ρen,id remains roughly unchanged.</p>
        <p>In Figure 6 (a -c) the combinations of ηrt, ψut and ρen which correspond to W1, W2 and W3 can be found. These performance indicators can be used to characterize the TI-PTES system and to compare it with other storage technologies.</p>
        <p>In Figure 6 (a -c) regenerated and non-regenerated layouts are compared in absolute terms. For ηrt increments around 30% are found in case of W1 and W2, whereas increments around 35% are found for W3. Much lower increments resulted for ψut. For W1, W2 and W3, increments around 15%, 10% and -13% are found. The fact that in some cases the regenerated layout performs worse than the non-regenerated one has to be seen more as an exception that as a rule. Furthermore, since the multi-criteria standpoint is assumed, triads of parameters should be compared together. Accordingly, regenerated W3 configuration cannot be deemed as worse than its non-regenerated counterpart, since for a little decrease in ψut, a relevant increase in both ηrt and ρen is achieved. Finally, similarly to what resulted for single objective case, the major increments are registered for ρen: 70%, 67% and 59% are the increments related to W1, W2 and W3, respectively. Therefore, ρen is confirmed as the most influenced parameter by regeneration.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, even if the suitability of internal regenerator introduction must be investigated with a technoeconomic analysis, it is clear that this modification is very promising. With respect to the basic layout, with a modest additional expenditure, much higher storage densities and much higher electric-to-electric efficiencies can be easily achieved. Despite the performance increases due to the regeneration, the bottom line remains the same: it is possible to achieve ηrt higher than 50% and ρen around 17 kWh/m 3 , but this can be done only if the heat source is unefficiently exploited. This could be a major hindrance to the further development of the TI-PTES technology, especially in those cases in which the thermal power is not readily available, as assumed here, and must be produced. This problem can be solved in many ways, ranging from layout modifications which allow for a better exploitation of heat source, to the use of working fluid mixtures, which could provide a better integration between the HTHP and the ORC. These are some aspects over which future researches should focus. The last thing is to compare TI-PTES with other storage technologies. For the sake of brevity, to perform this comparison, only the regenerated layout is considered.</p>
        <p>As far as the energy density ρen is concerned, theoretical results suggest that values over 10 kWh/m 3 are always achieved, whereas values over 15 kWh/m 3 may be reached in some cases only. As specified in Section 2.2, ρen could be multiplied by a ½ factor if the total volume is considered. Whatever the case, TI-PTES shows densities higher than pumped-hydro and large-scale CAES, which have ρen between 0.5 and 2 kWh/m 3 and between 3 and 6 kWh/m 3 [41]. Furthermore, resulting ρen is on the same level of that of liquid-air storage and slightly lower than of flow batteries (16 -35 kWh/m 3 ) [41].</p>
        <p>As far as ηrt is concerned, realistic values of this parameter suggested by theoretical results are between 0.4 and 0.57. These figures are slightly lower than that of CAES, which ranges from 0.45 to 0.7 and liquid-air storage, which are between 0.5 and 0.7 [41,42]. The comparison with PHES and flow batteries worse, as they usually achieve ηrt around 0.8 -0.85. As for ψut, the only comparison that can be made is with CAES, since this is the only technology that integrates energy in forms other than the electric one, to the best of the authors' knowledge. The so-called diabatic CAES have total efficiency of around 0.54 [10]. This value is not calculated based on fuel chemical exergy, but since exergy and thermal power provided by fuel combustion are very similar, 0.54 is also indicative of the exergy efficiency of CAES. TI-PTES can achieve ψut as high as 0.2, but realistic configurations more oriented towards having better ηrt might show ψut as low as 0.07. The comparison with CAES, although based on a congruent indicator, is again somewhat incorrect. It is natural to have very low conversion efficiency while exploiting very low-grade thermal sources, like those used in the analysis (Tsrc,min ≤ 80 °C). Furthermore, ψut it is formulated considering also that the thermal energy of the source cannot be stored, so it gets wasted during storage idle periods, which is something that does not occur in CAES, as fuel is easily stored. Therefore, unlike ηrt and ρen, which can be used to compare TI-PTES with other storage technologies, ψut is not fully suited to be used for comparison purposes. This parameter is to be used as an investigation tool, to understand the tradeoffs that must be faced during TI-PTES theoretical design phase.</p>
        <p>Based on the analysis that has been developed in previous sections, the following conclusions may be drawn. Two different configurations for a TI-PTES system, i.e. with and without internal regeneration, have been analyzed and compared. The theoretical thermodynamic design of the system has been performed by means of a nonlinear model, which is based on the resolution of a nonlinear constrained optimization problem. By changing the objective function, the system has been designed to promote different performance parameters, namely electric-to-electric efficiency ηrt, total exergy efficiency ψut and energy density ρen. These parameters resulted to be competing with each other: high values of one of these, usually entails low values of the others. The definition of a flexible design tool and of a number of competing objectives, set the foundation for a multicriteria analysis which has been extensively performed. The main findings related to the first part of the analysis, which is based on single-objective optimization, can be summarized as follows:</p>
        <p> Maximum theoretical values for ηrt, ψut and ρen can be achieved with the regenerated configuration and are equal to 0.65, 0.21 and 17.72 kWh/m 3 . These values cannot be achieved concurrently;</p>
        <p> In the single-objective framework, regeneration introduction is very effective for ρen, as it leads to an increase of about 35%, whereas it is less effective for ηrt, which showed only a 6.5% increase, and ψut, for which a 15% increase was found;  By considering ηrt, ψut and ρen as equally important, i.e. searching for "balanced" TI-PTES configurations, the most performing HTHP and ORC fluid pairs resulted to be Cyclopentane -Cyclopentane and R1336mzz(Z) -R1336mzz(Z) for regenerated and non-regenerated configuration, respectively. The second part of the analysis is based on the multi-criteria analysis of the TI-PTES. Among non-dominated solutions, three configurations for each layout has been selected by specifying three different sets of objective weights, i.e. objective hierarchies. The main findings of the second part of the analysis can be summarized as follows:</p>
        <p> In the multi-objective framework, regeneration introduction resulted to be more effective, thus demonstrating its capability of relaxing trade-offs between objectives. By referring to three different sets of objective weights, the regenerated layout systematically achieves better objective configurations. If the same weight sets are compared, increments comprised between 30% and 35% can be achieved for ηrt, and between 60% and 70% for ρen. Maximum resulting ψut increment is around 15%, but in one case a negative value, i.e. -13%, has been found. Such decrement is counterbalanced by high increments in both ηrt and ρen, thus leading to a globally better configuration;  Given the resulting internal regeneration effectiveness, this layout modification has the potential to establish as the TI-PTES standard configuration. Despite this, this potentiality has to be verified with a dedicated techno-economic analysis, as the regeneration requires the introduction of two additional heat exchangers;  Based on the multi-criteria analysis results, some TI-PTES theoretical performances can be derived.</p>
        <p>An interesting configuration could be the one related to the weight set W3, which features ηrt roughly equal to 0.57 and ρen around to 17 kWh/m 3 . Such levels of ηrt and ρen are a good achievement in terms of multi-objective optimization, since in this case the ratios ηrt / ηrt,id and ρen / ρen,id are both higher than 0.9. Given the required trade-off between objectives, this performance is paid in terms of ψut, which was between 0.06 and 0.07, corresponding to a value of 0.3 in terms of ψut / ψut,id. If higher level of ψut are required, i.e. ψut ≈ 0.2, ρen can be maintained high, ρen ≈ 17 kWh/m 3 , but ηrt must drop to 0.4;  The performance suggested by theoretical analysis are promising if compared with other storage technologies. ρen was higher than that commonly featured by PHES and CAES, and roughly the same of that of flow batteries and liquid-air storage. For ηrt the comparison is less positive, since the theoretical analysis gave results that are slightly lower than those usually featured by technologies like CAES and liquid-air storage.</p>
