        <p>This paper proposes two new methods (the Quantile Group LASSO and the Quantile Group SCAD models) to evaluate the predictability of a large group of factors on carbon futures returns. The most powerful predictors are selected through the dimensionreduction mechanism of the two models, while potential differences of the statistically significant predictors for different quantiles of carbon returns are carefully considered.</p>
        <p>First, we find that the proposed models outperform a series of competing ones with respect to prediction accuracy. Second, impacts of the selected predictors over the carbon price distribution are estimated through a quantile approach, which outperforms the mean shrinkage model in our case with data featured by a non-normal distribution.</p>
        <p>Specifically, the Brent spot price, the crude oil closing stock in the UK, and the growth of natural gas production in the UK are found to impact carbon futures returns only in extreme conditions with a strong asymmetric feature. Importantly, our estimators remain robust against the extreme event caused by the Covid-19. Our findings reveal that the identification of appropriate carbon return predictors and their impacts hinge on the carbon market conditions, and should be of interest to various stakeholders.</p>
        <p>The rising concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) results in adverse consequences of global warming and climate change whereby the sustainability of human activities and development could be potentially weakened. In response to global climate change, the carbon market has been specifically developed as an effective mechanism of the carbon emissions reduction, while considering the carbon market dynamics has become an integral part of the worldwide policymaking (Zhu et al., 2018). Operating on the principle of 'cap-and-trade', the European Union Emission Trading System (EU ETS) initialized on January 2005 is the largest multinational carbon market worldwide so far to constrain CO 2 emissions by carbon-consumed industries in Europe. 1An accurate prediction of carbon price dynamics and an in-depth investigation of its determination are of great importance for various stakeholders involving academic researchers, policymakers, carbon-consumed installations, and financial investors (Zhu and Chevallier, 2017), whereas existing efforts are surprisingly sparse. Specifically, carbon price fluctuations directly impact the performance of carbon emissions reduction in carbon market (Zhu et al., 2018). Carbon price dynamics also affect the cost of most human activities and economic development (such as power production, modern transportation, land-use changes, etc.). The latter is known to be largely driven by the carbon-consumed energy (i.e., oil, natural gas, and coal), which are major sources of carbon emissions (Balcılar et al., 2016;Kara et al., 2008). As an emerging financial product, futures contracts of carbon allowances provide investors with an important instrument for the risk diversification in their investment portfolios (Paolella and Tas-chini, 2008). Importantly, it is known that the carbon price formation is characterized with asymmetry (Duan et al., 2021), extant literature that moves beyond the meanbased predictions is nevertheless scant. Thus, thorough forecasting for future carbon price movements while considering the impact of extreme events worldwide, e.g., the ongoing Covid-19 epidemic, is of paramount importance and still left for research.</p>
        <p>We propose two innovative dimension-reduction and quantile forecasting methods, i.e. the quantile group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Quantile Group LASSO) and the Quantile Group SCAD models, to identify statistically significant predictors of the dynamics of carbon futures returns in the EU ETS over the carbon price distribution. Unlike the existing literature that usually learns predictors of carbon futures returns via a small number of variables in a narrowed field, this study includes a large number of predictors, which may possibly determine the dynamics of carbon futures returns. Our massive data enable us to include the related information as much as possible, however, traditional statistical models which are widely used in return forecasting could not incorporate massive amount of variables.</p>
        <p>Therefore, we advocate these two novel methods that are able to identify 'key factors' among a large number of variables to improve the predictive efficiency for carbon returns. The high predictive accuracy and feasibility of these methods is demonstrated in our empirical analysis. In our study, the predictors are selected from a comprehensive pool related to the carbon market dynamics including 44 market fundamental variables and 18 technical variables. 2 Impacts of the most powerful carbon-return predictors, which are allowed to be different at various carbon quantiles, on carbon return dynamics are estimated through a quantile regression. Performance of our employed estimators remains robust when facing extreme events associated with the ongoing Covid-19 epidemic worldwide.</p>
        <p>Our research contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, via a large set of candidate models we account for a large set of predictive sources regarding the carbon return dynamics from aspects of energy demand-supply fluctuations, energy price dynamics, stock price indicators, aggregate credit provisions, macroeconomic conditions, and technical indicators, respectively. Based on two sterling properties of our proposed methods, i.e., the 'interpretability of the final estimator' and the 'fast computation', we are able to identify the most powerful predictors among all potential ones for future dynamics of carbon returns, while allowing for potential differences of significant predictors at various carbon return quantiles.</p>
        <p>Second, to evaluate the forecasting performance, through comparisons of the meansquared prediction error (M SP E) and the mean absolute value of prediction error (M AP E), we demonstrate that the Quantile Group LASSO model and the Quantile Group SCAD model have superior out-of-sample predictability compared to the currently-popular methods. Meanwhile, regarding the predictor selection, these two methods consider and allow for the heterogeneity of significant predictors at different quantiles of carbon returns.</p>
        <p>Third, in contrast to mean-based approaches, we further employ a quantile regression model to estimate distinct impacts of the selected forecasting factors on carbon futures returns across all market conditions in the data set. Applying the quantile approach to examining the tail behavior of carbon futures prices could better capture the true interdependence between the carbon return and its predictors. We find that the Brent oil price, the crude oil closing stock in the UK, and the growth of natural gas production in the UK statistically significantly affect carbon returns during extreme events (i.e., at low and high quantile levels). In addition, it is worth noting that our estimators are also shown to be robust against extreme events in the ongoing Covid-19 epidemic.</p>
        <p>Overall, our empirical research possesses important implications to a wide group of entities, involving policymakers, carbon-consumed industrial productions, and investors, for an accurate cost assessment of carbon-consumed productions and activities, a sensible risk diversification of the investment portfolio, and an effective reduction of carbon market risks.</p>
        <p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes the extant related literature in carbon price forecasting; Section 3 proposes our methodology. Section 4 introduces our data set as well as the main variables used in this study. Section 5 discusses the empirical results. Section 6 concludes.</p>
        <p>How is our research connected with the extant literature? Previous studies employ various methods for the carbon price/return prediction. 3 Early research mainly uses a qualitative research approach to discuss carbon price prediction. In recent studies, considering changes in carbon price over time as a time series, popular time-series forecasting methods are extensively applied to the carbon price prediction. For example, Paolella and Taschini (2008) model the conditional dynamics of CO 2 and SO 2 price returns in the US and EU markets using a novel Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH)-structure approach, and find that a mixed-normal of the forecastability. Benz and Trück (2009) apply the Markov switching and AR-GARCH model to capture distinct behaviors of carbon return volatility in different regimes in the EU ETS and examine the improvement of its forecasting performance compared with conventional prediction methods without considering switching regimes.</p>
        <p>Focusing on the EU carbon markets, Chevallier (2011b) applies a nonparametric approach for the carbon price prediction and investigates that the approach outperforms conventional linear autoregression models, where forecasting errors could be reduced by almost 15% through the nonparametric modeling. Byun and Cho (2013) focus on the European Climate Exchange market and apply the GARCH-structured models to forecast carbon price dynamics. They observe a more effective predictive power of GJR-GARCH model against TGARCH and standard GARCH models. Koop and Tole (2013) forecast carbon price dynamics in the EU ETS using the dynamic averaging method and examine its forecast accuracy compared to conventional methods. They further discuss the forecastability of market fundamental and institutional factors for the carbon price dynamics. Sanin et al. (2015) find that the Autoregressive Moving Average X (ARMAX)-GARCH approach with an additive stochastic jump process outperforms the standard ARMAX-GARCH approach regarding the carbon price prediction in the EU ETS. Overall, while there is a growing literature in the carbon price forecasting, the methodology is mostly based on an assumption of linear movements of carbon prices, and the potentially-existing nonlinearity is nevertheless neglected.</p>
        <p>To model the nonlinear carbon-price changing patterns, existing research mainly relies on the techniques of artificial intelligence and ensemble (hybrid), respectively.</p>
        <p>For example, Fan et al. (2015) forecast carbon price movements in the EU ETS using a multi-layered perception (MLP)-artificial neural networks (ANN) approach and find a better predictive performance than the single and variant models. At the same time, the ensemble (hybrid) method is developed to further improve the weakness of single models and enhance forecasting accuracy. For example, Zhu et al. (2016) conduct the carbon and energy price prediction using an ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD)-based least square support vector machines (LSSVM) and examine more accurate forecasting performance of the EEMD-LSSVM compared to conventional methods. Sun et al. (2016) confirm the improvement of forecasting accuracy when combining variational mode decomposition (VDM) and spiking neural networks (SNN) in contrast to conventional methods. Zhu et al. (2018) propose a multiscale nonlinear ensemble learning framework, including EMD and LSSVM with a kernel function prototype for the prediction of carbon prices in the EU. They find high levels of predictive accuracy and robustness of their proposed methods compared to standard forecasting methods.</p>
        <p>Although more sophisticated methods have been developed to account for the nonlinearity of carbon price dynamics, potentially heterogeneous change patterns of carbon prices at different price quantiles are neglected. Moreover, most of the extant literature conducts the carbon price prediction merely based on historical information of carbon price changes, whereas the predictive power of its forecasting factors is still nevertheless ignored. Indeed, it has been well-established that carbon price changes are determined by a large number of factors mainly involving energy market dynamics, financial market performance, technical indicators, weather and macroeconomic conditions (See, e.g., Zhang and Wei, 2010). Specifically, Alberola et al. (2008) conduct an econometric analysis to find carbon price drivers by identifying the potential structural breaks in the EU ETS. They point out that energy prices and weather conditions can explain changes in carbon price levels in EU ETS. Chevallier (2009) uses a series of GARCH-structured models to analyze the relationship between carbon futures returns and macroeconomic-financial factors involving stock, bond, commodity markets, and macroeconomic factors based on the EU ETS. Chevallier (2011a) applies a Markovswitching VAR approach to identify the 'boom-bust' cycle in the EU carbon market and measures the determination of carbon pricing by macroeconomic factors and energy prices.</p>
        <p>In addition to macroeconomic factors, the impact of energy prices on carbon price determination has also been discussed. Kumar et al. (2012) conducts a VAR analysis and investigate the dynamic price linkage among carbon, fossil energy, and stock prices of clean energy and technology. Sadorsky (2012) applies a series of multivariate GARCH models and find strong correlations among oil prices and stock prices of clean energy and technology. Using a multivariate GARCH model, which can consider structural changes and the heterogeneity of price correlations between carbon market and market fundamentals in the economic upturn and downturn periods, Koch (2014) finds strong price linkages among carbon, energy, and financial markets. Ji et al. (2018) analyzes the information linkage and knowledge spillover between carbon and energy markets, viz. oil, natural gas, and coal, in the format of return and volatility, respectively. The close relationship between the oil price volatility and carbon prices have also been discussed in Gong and Lin (2017); Xu and Lin (2018); Gong and Lin (2021); Gong et al. (2021).</p>
        <p>While existing studies have discussed the determination of carbon prices considering different groups of forecasting factors, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the predictability among possible forecasting factors of carbon prices in quantiles.</p>
        <p>In this section, we briefly introduce each of the candidate method we use to quantify the importance of potential Carbon price forecasting factors, as well as out-of-sample forecasting comparison method.</p>
        <p>The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operate (LASSO) proposed by Tibshirani (1996) is one of the most popular methods to solve the high dimensional estimation problem (See, e.g., Zhang et al., 2008). It penalizes the likelihood function and obtains a sparse solution.</p>
        <p>The LASSO estimator is defined as βLASSO = arg min</p>
        <p>where λ is the regularization parameter, and the 1 penalty N i=1 |β i | is employed to ensure sparsity.</p>
        <p>With the increase of the regularization parameter λ, estimation parameters will be continuously shrunk towards zero by the LASSO. If the λ is large enough, some of them will be shrunk to exactly zero. According to this, the LASSO is often used in variable selection. Due to its high accuracy in prediction and variable selection, the LASSO is the most commonly used technique for solving high-dimensional estimation problems.</p>
        <p>Our forecasts for the carbon price returns using LASSO are</p>
        <p>Here βLASSO = arg min</p>
        <p>where βLASSO is the regression coefficients estimated by LASSO using the data up to month t, p t+1 is the log return of carbon prices at month t + 1, x i,t is the ith predictor available at month t, and λ cv is the non-negative regularization parameter selected by the cross-validation method.</p>
        <p>The adaptive LASSO (Zou, 2006) is an advanced high-dimensional estimation method which is based on the LASSO. Unlike the LASSO which uses a standard 1 penalty, the adaptive LASSO employs a weighted 1 penalty, and therefore avoid the overestimation problem. Moreover, compared with LASSO, it holds consistent selection property with weaker conditions.</p>
        <p>The adaptive LASSO estimator is βadapt = arg min</p>
        <p>The adaptive LASSO estimator can be obtained in two steps. The first step is to obtain the weight value which is given by the formula (1) in LASSO, and the regularization parameter λinit,cv in ( 1) is chosen by the cross-validation method, thus the weight value is βinit,i = β( λinit,cv ). For the second step, we use the weight value in step 1, and chose the regularization parameter λ cv in (2) by the cross-validation method again.</p>
        <p>In this way, we obtain the final estimator. The regularization parameters in adaptive LASSO are selected in step 1 and step 2 sequentially, and it is less computationally expensive than optimize them simultaneously.</p>
        <p>Unlike the LASSO where the same regularization parameter λ are employed for all the parameters β i (i = 1, 2..., p) in the penalty term, the different parameter β i in the adaptive LASSO has different penalty value which depends on the different weight value βinit . Therefore, the adaptive LASSO has the following property:</p>
        <p>(1) If βinit,i = 0, then the estimator βadapt,i = 0, which ensures the sparsity of the solution.</p>
        <p>(2) If | βinit,i | is large, then the value of penalty term for parameter β i will be small.</p>
        <p>Similarly, if | βinit,i | is small, then the penalty value for parameter β i will be large.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the adaptive LASSO not only has less biased estimators, but also avoid selecting undesired variables.</p>
        <p>Our forecasts for the carbon price returns using Adaptive LASSO are</p>
        <p>Here βadapt = arg min</p>
        <p>where βadapt is the regression coefficients estimated by the adaptive LASSO using the data up to month t, β init,i is an initial estimator, p t+1 , x i,t and λ cv are defined the same as in (1).</p>
        <p>In some situations, the parametric vector β in a high-dimensional regression model has a group structure {g 1 , g 2 , ..., g q } which is essentially based on the index number {1, 2, ..., p}. That is, ∪ q j=1 g j = {1, 2, ..., p} and g j ∩ g k = ∅.</p>
        <p>Then the parametric vector β is</p>
        <p>.., β gq ), where β g j = {β r ; r ∈ g j }.</p>
        <p>The group LASSO estimator in a linear model (Yuan and Lin, 2006) is then defined as βgroup = arg min</p>
        <p>where β g j 2 denotes the standard Euclidean norm, that is</p>
        <p>The multiplier m j is used to balance cases where the groups are of very different sizes, usually we set</p>
        <p>where T j is the number of parameters in jth group. The advantages of the group LASSO estimator are two folds: First, it can deal with the data where features are organized into related groups. Second, it remains high prediction accuracy and estimation consistency as the LASSO.</p>
        <p>Our forecasts for the carbon price returns using Group LASSO is</p>
        <p>Here βgroup = arg min</p>
        <p>where βgroup is the regression coefficients estimated by the group LASSO using the data up to month t,</p>
        <p>T i with T i being the number of parameters in ith group, p t+1 , x i,t and λ cv are defined the same as in (1).</p>
        <p>Unlike the LASSO, the adaptive LASSO and the group LASSO which focus on highdimensional regression problems, the AutoRegressive-Moving-Average (ARMA) model is one of the most famous methods in time-series analysis, which can understand and predict future value.</p>
        <p>The ARMA model (Whittle, 1953, Box et al., 2015) is a combination of Autoregressive (AR) model and Moving-average (MA) model. The autoregressive model of order p which refers to AR(p) is written as</p>
        <p>where Y t is the observation at time t, α 1 , ..., α p are parameters in AR(p) model, c is a constant, and the random variable ε t is white noise which means they are independent and identically distributed with</p>
        <p>The moving-average model of order q which refers to MA(q) is written as</p>
        <p>where Y t is the observation at time t, β 1 , ..., β q are parameters in MA(q) model, µ is the expectation of X t , and ε t , ε t-1 are white noise error terms.</p>
        <p>Now the ARMA (p,q) model which refers to p autoregressive terms and q movingaverage terms is written as</p>
        <p>where Y t is the observation at time t, α i and β i are parameters in ARMA(p,q) model, c is a constant and ε t , ε t-1 are white noise error terms.</p>
        <p>The AutoRegressive-Moving-Average model with exogenous inputs (ARMAX) is a generalization of the ARMA model. The ARMAX(p,q,g) model adds external covariates to an ARMA (p,q) model, which is given by</p>
        <p>where γ i is the parameter of the exogenous covariate X.</p>
        <p>By comparing the autocorrelation (ACF) function which gives correlations between p t and p t -h for h = 1, 2, 3..., we use the following ARMA (1,1) and ARMAX (1,1,1) models to understand and predict our carbon price return data</p>
        <p>• ARMA (1,1):</p>
        <p>• ARMAX(1,1,1):</p>
        <p>where p t is the observation of the carbon price return at time t, X t-1 is the external covariate at time t -1, α, β, and γ are parameters, c is a constant, and ε t is the white noise.</p>
        <p>Then the forecasts of the carbon price returns using ARMA (1,1) model is</p>
        <p>• two-months ahead: pt+2 = ĉ + αp t+1</p>
        <p>• three-months ahead: pt+3 = ĉ + αp t+2</p>
        <p>. . .</p>
        <p>where pt+i is the predicted value of the carbon price return at time t + i, p t is the true value of the carbon price return at time t, εt = p t -pt , and ĉ, α, β are parametric estimators of ARMA (1,1) model. Here we omit the prediction procedure of the ARMAX(1,1,1) model which can be constructed similarly. The GARCH(p, q) regression model is defined by</p>
        <p>where Ψ t-1 denotes the information set at time t-1, µ t is the expected value of y t at time t, ε t is the error term at time t, σ 2 t is the variance of the current error term conditioned on all the information up to time t -1, ω, α i , β j are parameters in GARCH(p, q) model,</p>
        <p>The main idea of GARCH model is that the conditional variance σ t of current error term ε t given information up to time t -1 is correlated to its own past values</p>
        <p>and the recent values of squared errors ε 2 t-i (i = 1, 2, ..., p). This model can be augmented with exogenous variables, which is the so-called GARCHX model.</p>
        <p>By comparing the autocorrelation (ACF) function which gives correlations between p t and p t -h for h = 1, 2, 3..., we use the following GARCH (1,1) and GARCHX (1,1,1) models to understand and predict our carbon price return data</p>
        <p>• GARCH (1,1):</p>
        <p>• GARCHX (1,1,1):</p>
        <p>where p t is the observation of carbon price return at time t, X t-1 is the exogenous covariate at time t -1, µ t is the expected value of p t , ω, α, β, and γ are parameters.</p>
        <p>3.2. Our models</p>
        <p>The quantile regression (Koenker and Hallock, 2001), which focuses on obtaining the information of conditional median or conditional quantiles of the response, is an important analysis method in econometrics and statistics (e.g., Koenker, 2004;Machado and Mata, 2005;Buchinsky, 1994;Yu et al., 2003). Compared with the standard linear regression, which is only able to capture the relationship between the predictors and the mean response, the quantile regression can provide more information about different conditional quantiles of the response, and therefore outliers have fewer effects in the analysis.</p>
        <p>Let Y be a random variable and the cumulative distribution function is</p>
        <p>then the τ th quantile of Y is defined by</p>
        <p>where inf is the infimum. Suppose the τ th quantile function is</p>
        <p>then the parametric estimator βτ is given by βτ = arg min</p>
        <p>where the check function ρ τ (u) = u{τ -I(u ≤ 0)} and I is an indicator function.</p>
        <p>During the last decade, the analysis for high-dimensional data has drawn much attention. The key feature of the high-dimensional problem is the number of predictors is larger than the sample size, and the most common way for solving this problem is to introduce a penalty term in the estimation function.</p>
        <p>The parametric estimator in the penalized quantile regression model is</p>
        <p>where ρ τ (u) is the check function and p λ (•) is a penalty function with a tuning parameter λ.</p>
        <p>In this study, we employ two most popular and commonly used penalties: The LASSO penalty (Tibshirani, 1996) and the SCAD penalty (Fan and Li, 2001). Moreover, due to the structure of potential forecasting factors, we use more proper and advanced versions which are constructed on the LASSO and the SCAD, respectively:</p>
        <p>The Group LASSO penalty (Yuan and Lin, 2006), and the Group SCAD penalty (Wang et al., 2007). Both are wildly used in statistical and economic analysis (See, e.g., Meier et al., 2008).</p>
        <p>Suppose the parametric vector β has a group structure {g 1 , g 2 , ..., g q } which is a combination of the index number {1, 2, ..., p}. That is, ∪ q j=1 g j = {1, 2, ..., p} and</p>
        <p>.., β gq ), where β g j = {β r ; r ∈ g j }.</p>
        <p>The parametric estimator in the penalized quantile regression with Group LASSO penalty is defined as</p>
        <p>where β g j are the parameters in g j th group, β g j 2 denotes the standard Euclidean</p>
        <p>2 . The multiplier m j is used to balance cases where the groups are of very different sizes, usually we set m j = T j , where T j is the number of parameters in jth group.</p>
        <p>Compared with the classic penalization method LASSO (Tibshirani, 1996), which intends to select explanatory variables individually, the group LASSO penalty proposed by Yuan and Lin (2006) considers a common scenario that features can be organized into related groups. In this case, there is indeed information contained in the grouping structure, thus ignoring it and using standard methods will lead inaccurate estimators.</p>
        <p>The quantile group LASSO estimator in ( 5) employs the group LASSO penalty in the classic quantile regression, which makes it not only be able to capture the information in the feature groups, but also can discover useful predictive relationships between variables under different quantile levels.</p>
        <p>Our forecasts of the carbon price returns at the median case using the Quantile Group LASSO are pt+1 = βqgLASSO τt,0</p>
        <p>x i,t .</p>
        <p>Here βqgLASSO τt = arg min</p>
        <p>where βqgLASSO τt is the regression coefficients estimated by the Quantile Group LASSO using the data up to month t with τ = 0.5, β gi are the parameters in g i th group and</p>
        <p>, p t+1 is the log return of carbon price at month t + 1, x i,t is the ith predictor available at month t, m i = √ T i and T i is the number of parameters in ith group.</p>
        <p>The parametric estimator in the penalized quantile regression with group SCAD penalty</p>
        <p>where β g j are the parameters in g j th group, and P λ (•) is the group SCAD penalty which is defined as</p>
        <p>Our forecasts of the carbon price returns at the median case using Quantile Group SCAD is pt+1 = βqgscad τt,0</p>
        <p>Here</p>
        <p>where βqgscad τt is the regression coefficients estimated by Quantile Group SCAD using the data up to month t with τ = 0.5, p t+1 , x i,t and β gi are defined the same as in (6).</p>
        <p>The out-of-sample performance test, which can avoid the over-fitting problem of using the whole data set, is commonly used to test statistical models' prediction ability in many areas, such as statistics, econometrics, envirometrics, computer science and so on (See, e.g., Welch and Goyal, 2007;Rapach et al., 2010;Clark and West, 2006) Inspired by Campbell and Thompson (2007) and jointly considering the sterling performance and wide applications of the following criteria in the extant literature, we employ the mean-squared prediction error (M SP E), the mean absolute prediction error (M AP E), the R 2 statistic of mean-squared prediction error (R 2</p>
        <p>M SP E ) and the The out-of-sample R 2 statistic of mean-squared prediction error (R 2 M SP E ) is</p>
        <p>and</p>
        <p>where M SP E C is the mean-squared prediction error of the candidate model and M SP E B is the mean-squared prediction error of the benchmark model, r m+i is the actual carbon price return at time m + i, rC m+i and rB m+i are the predicted carbon price returns of the candidate model and the benchmark model at time m + i respectively, m is the length of the in-sample estimation data set, and q is the length of the out-of-sample prediction data set.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the out-of-sample R 2 statistic of the absolute value of prediction error</p>
        <p>and</p>
        <p>where M AP E C is the average absolute value of the prediction error of the candidate model and M AP E B is the average absolute value of the prediction error of the benchmark model. Here r m+i , rC m+i and rB m+i are defined the same as before.</p>
        <p>The R These data enable us to construct monthly observations for our key dependent variable of interest: the carbon futures returns, which is defined as logarithmic monthly changes in carbon futures closing prices. Other data are collected from DataStream covering the period from March 2009 to December 2020. Table 1 reports the descriptive statistics for our response variable -the carbon futures price return.</p>
        <p>[Table 1 about here.]</p>
        <p>The monthly carbon price return is skewed left as the negative skewness value in 1. The moving-average rule, which is a mechanical trading rule and aims to capture trends, is constructed by generating a buy signal (S i,t = 1) or sell signal (S i,t = 0) at the end of time t by comparing two moving averages:</p>
        <p>where P t is the level of carbon price at time t, s is the length of the short MA, l is the long-term MA and s &lt; l. Based on the above formula, the MA rule is sensitive about the changes in price trends. In this paper, we use six movingaverage indicators with s = 1, 2, 3 and l = 9, 12.</p>
        <p>2. The momentum rule is constructed by generating a buy signal (S i,t = 1) or sell signal (S i,t = 0) at the end of time t by comparing the current carbon price and its level at m periods ago:</p>
        <p>where P t denotes the carbon price at time t, and P t-m denotes the level of carbon price at m periods ago. We use six momentum indicators with m = 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12.</p>
        <p>3. The on-balance volume averages rule, which aims to capture market trend using past prices, is constructed by generating a buy signal (S i,t = 1) or sell signal (S i,t = 0) at the end of time t by comparing two moving averages based on OBV t :</p>
        <p>where V OL k is the trading volume during month k, D k is a binary variable which (2021), we also consider the 44 macroeconomic variables covering information of energy commodities, financial markets and economic activities, which may have the predictive power for the carbon price. These data are available in DataStream, EIA 6 , and ICEfoot_8 .</p>
        <p>Moreover, the 44 macroeconomic variables can be divided into the following groups:</p>
        <p>the energy source group, the energy price group, the stock market index group, the monetary policy group, and the economic information group, where each group usually contains similar information from different countries. The full group information is provided in List 1 of the Appendix.</p>
        <p>This section presents and discusses our empirical results. We start with a horse race of a set of forecasting models, and move to analysis of forecasting factors for the dynamics of carbon prices. A quantile analysis is then conducted to investigate the impacts of the selected predictors for different quantiles of carbon returns over the carbon price distribution. Robustness of our estimators and the corresponding findings in the face of extreme events associated with the ongoing Covid-19 epidemic is further examined.</p>
        <p>First, we report the results of the MSPE and MAPE of the six-month and twelve-month out-of-sample forecast tests in Table 2 foot_9 . Table 2(a) shows the result in the six-month forecast, and Table 2(b) shows the result in the twelve-month forecast. The list of candidate forecast models is in the first column of each table 9 . Here the forecasting abilities of the Quantile Group LASSO and the Quantile Group SCAD models are evaluated at the median quantile level, i.e., the 50% quantile, for fair comparisons with the competing models which do not take quantiles into consideration.</p>
        <p>[Table 2 In other words, no matter for MSPE or MAPE criterion, in the six-month and twelvemonth forecast tests, the Quantile Group LASSO and Quantile Group SCAD models are the top two models in terms of prediction accuracy.</p>
        <p>From Table 2, we know that the time-series forecast group (the ARMA (1,1), GARCH</p>
        <p>(1,1), ARMAX (1,1,1), GARCHX (1,1,1), ARMAXS (1,1,1), and GARCHXS (1,1,1) models) has obvious lower prediction accuracy than the high-dimensional forecast group (the Quantile Group LASSO, the Quantile Group SCAD, the LASSO, the adaptive LASSO, and the group LASSO) in both the six-month and twelve-month forecasts. To quantitatively compare the forecasting ability of these two groups, we set the ARMA (1,1) and GARCH (1,1) models, which have relatively better forecasting performances in the time-series group, as the benchmark models and the rest models as the candidate models. The R [Table 3 about here.]</p>
        <p>The most important finding in Table 3 Although compared with the ARMAX (1,1,1) and the GARCHX (1,1,1) models which consider all possible variables, the ARMAXS (1,1,1) and the GARCHXS (1,1,1)</p>
        <p>with carefully selected variables have better forecasting performances, they are still not comparable to the ARMA (1,1) and the GARCH(1,1) models, let alone the aforementioned high-dimensional forecast group. This indicates that information of relative variables should be smartly wrapped into the forecasting models, just as our highdimensional group, rather than naively combining them.</p>
        <p>To conclude, the high-dimensional model, which can predict future prices by capturing important information from a large number of variables, is more accurate than the time-series models, no matter these time-series models consider the variables or not. Among the high-dimensional forecast group, the Quantile Group LASSO model and the Quantile Group SCAD model have better prediction performances than all the other methods, for the reason that they can obtain more information of forecasting factors at different quantiles, thus are more accurate and proper in the situation where the response series is not normally distributed.</p>
        <p>From Table 3, we can know that the Quantile Group LASSO and the Quantile Group SCAD have better forecasting results than others. To quantitatively compare the prediction ability of these two models with the competing ones, we set the Quantile Group LASSO and the Quantile Group SCAD as the candidate models respectively, and all the other models as the benchmark models.</p>
        <p>The following Table 4 reports the results of R Besides, all the values in Table 4 are positive, which implies the Quantile Group LASSO and the Quantile Group SCAD have better prediction results than all the other models in our experiments. This finding is exciting since these competing models are widely used in many areas (See, e.g., Engle, 2001;McLeod and Li, 1983;Varian, 2014).</p>
        <p>In summary, the Quantile Group LASSO and the Quantile Group SCAD models have the best out-of-sample prediction performances, and the time-series group has the worst prediction results in our six-month and twelve-month forecast tests. In addition, the high-dimensional forecast group (the quantile group LASSO, the quantile group SCAD, the LASSO, and the group LASSO) have higher forecast accuracy than the time-series group, even if the time-series models take into account the relative variables as well. This indicates that the high-dimensional models are better at handling information from a large number of important variables, thus are more accurate than the traditional time-series models in prediction. More importantly, among these high-dimensional models, the Quantile Group LASSO and the Quantile Group SCAD, which have more flexibility and fewer model restrictions, are useful in the case where the response series has a complex distribution.</p>
        <p>As we mentioned before, the Quantile Group LASSO and the Quantile Group SCAD models can select the most important variables and use them to implement forecasting.</p>
        <p>In the last section, we focus on the forecasting results. Now we continue to analyze the potential forecasting factors.</p>
        <p>Based on the related literature (See, e.g., Fezzi and Bunn, 2009;da Silva et al., 2016;Hammoudeh et al., 2014;Tan and Wang, 2017), we consider a large set of 44 macroeconomic variables, and they are divided into the following five groups: the energy source group, the energy price group, the stock market index group, the monetary policy group, and the economic information group. One of the most important findings in the variable selection is that both the Quantile Group LASSO and the Quantile Group SCAD only select the variables in the energy source group and the energy price group.</p>
        <p>In other words, among all the macroeconomic variables, the monthly carbon futures price is affected by the crude oil and natural gas only. This information is beneficial since it sheds light on the most important factors affecting the carbon futures price.</p>
        <p>The common variables selected by the Quantile Group LASSO and the Quantile Group SCAD are as follows: the Europe Brent spot price, the growth of crude oil import in the United Kingdom, the growth of crude oil import in Germany, the growth of crude oil stock in the United Kingdom, the growth of natural gas import in France, the growth of natural gas import in the United Kingdom, and the growth of natural gas import in Italy.</p>
        <p>These forecasting factors suggest that, among a large number of factors that consists of the traditional energy (oil, gas) price and demand, the economic factors and financial market index, only the Brent spot price and the demand for crude oil and natural gas are the determinants of the carbon price.</p>
        <p>The finding that the Brent price has a link to the carbon price in the EU is consistent with other studies. For example, Bachmeier and Griffin (2006) showed the Brent price is the key factor of the carbon price. Mansanet-Bataller et al. (2007) found that the Brent price is the most important variable affecting the carbon price return, Fezzi and Bunn (2009) and Alberola et al. (2008) showed that the energy price highly influences the carbon price.</p>
        <p>For the relationship between the demanding of traditional energy (oil and nature gas) and the carbon price, the impact is quite intuitive: the more imports of crude oil and natural gas, the more likely to have higher energy consumption, and hence the more likely to have increased CO 2 emission, and therefore the more likely larger CO 2 allowances are needed which affects the carbon price. This finding coincides with some literature. For instance, Chevallier (2011a) showed that economic activities influences the carbon price. Declercq et al. (2011) investigated the relationship between the economic recession and the CO 2 emission. Bredin and Muckley (2011) also highlighted the impact of economic activities and the industrial production on the carbon price.</p>
        <p>However, for the rest forecasting factors, there are some debates in the literature, and our findings provide some new perspectives. For example, Chevallier (2009) showed that the interest rate and treasury bill yields are not robust in the carbon price forecast.</p>
        <p>However, there are some factors found by other studies but unselected here. For instance, Oberndorfer (2009) found that there is a relationship between the stock market index of the EU and the carbon price. Chevallier (2009) showed that the stock and bond markets in the EU affect the carbon price.</p>
        <p>Except for the macroeconomic variables, our analysis also sheds light on the role of the technical indicators. Some literature stated they have advantages over the standard fundamental variables in terms of forecasting. See, e.g., Neely et al. (2014); Lin (2018); Yin and Yang (2016). However, these technical indicators are not shown to be important in our study.</p>
        <p>In summary, among a large set of potential forecasting factors, the Brent price and the demands for crude oil and natural gas in the EU are the main drivers of the carbon price. The Quantile Group LASSO and Quantile Group SCAD models can select these important variables and use them to make accurate forecasting.</p>
        <p>The previous subsection shows that the Quantile Group LASSO and the Quantile Group SCAD methods can select important factors and use them to implement forecasting.</p>
        <p>Does the importance of each forecasting factor vary across quantiles? We address this question by analyzing these forecasting factors using quantile regressions. Quantile regression is an extension of the basic and standard linear regression in which researchers use the values of several variables to explain or predict the mean values of the response variable. Compared with the ordinary least squares, the quantile regression has three main advantages: First, it makes no assumption about the distribution of the target variable; Second, it can model the relationship between the predictor variables and specific quantiles of the response variable; Third, it tends to resist the influence of outliers. Thus, it is highly suitable for our case.</p>
        <p>[Table 5 about here.] Table 5 displays the estimated coefficients of quantile regressions under the low, medium, and high quantile levels (τ = 0.1, 0.5, 0.9), respectively. At each quantile level, all the forecasting factors by the Quantile Group LASSO method are taken into consid-erationfoot_11 . Overall, the most powerful factors/predictors for carbon futures returns and their corresponding impacts hinge on carbon market conditions (i.e., whether normal or extreme scenarios).</p>
        <p>At the low quantile level (τ = 0.1), the Quantile Group LASSO method selects nine important variables. Four of them are statistically significant: the Europe Brent spot price return, the crude oil closing stock return in the UK, the growth of natural gas production in the UK, and the growth of natural gas import in Italy. The negative estimated coefficients of these three variables, i.e., the Europe Brent spot price return, the growth of natural gas production in the UK, and the growth of natural gas import in Italy, indicate that the increase (decrease) of them will decrease (increase) the carbon futures price return in the EU. Meanwhile, the positive estimated coefficient of the crude oil closing stock return in the UK implies that, the increase (decrease) of it will increase (decrease) the carbon futures price return in the EU, at the low quantile level.</p>
        <p>At the median quantile level (τ = 0.5), there are seven variables selected by the Quantile Group LASSO method, but only the growth of natural gas import in Italy is statistically significant. It has a negative estimated coefficient as well, which means at the median quantile level, the increase (decrease) of it will decrease (increase) the carbon futures price return in the EU. This is consistent with the previous findings in the low quantile case.</p>
        <p>At the high quantile level (τ = 0.9), among all the variables selected by the Quantile Group LASSO, the following factors are statistically significant: the Europe Brent spot price return, the crude oil closing stock return in the UK, the growth of natural gas production in the UK, and the FTSE 100 index. Moreover, the increase (decrease) of the crude oil closing stock return in the UK and the FTSE 100 index will increase (decrease) the carbon futures price return in the EU. The increase (decrease) of the Brent price return and the growth of natural gas production in the UK will decrease (increase) the carbon futures price return in the EU, at the high quantile level. Now we further analyze the similarities and differences between the results at different quantile levels. The Brent price return, the crude oil closing stock return in the UK, and the growth of natural gas production in the UK have been shown " statistically significant" and have important relationships with the carbon futures price return at both the low and high quantile levels. This finding is quite intuitive and straightforward. It means that they are "key factors", and highly influence the carbon futures price during extreme events (i.e., at the high quantile level)</p>
        <p>However, these factors are not statistically significant at the median quantile level, where the growth of natural gas import in Italy has been found to be statistically significant. This is also the only factor that is statistically significant at both the low and median quantile levels, which means the growth of natural gas import in Italy has an important impact on the carbon futures price return in the EU, at the low to median quantile levels. The high quantile level case has one additional statistically significant variable: the FTSE 100 index. It means that, at the high quantile level, the FTSE index has an impact on the carbon futures price in the EU, but not at the low and median quantile level cases.</p>
        <p>In summary, we analyze the variables selected by Quantile Group LASSO at different quantile levels. The Brent price, the crude oil closing stock return in the UK, and the growth of natural gas production in the UK are important factors in the carbon futures price prediction during extreme events (i.e., at the high quantile level). This finding is consistent with other studies (See, e.g., Fezzi and Bunn, 2009;Alberola et al., 2008).</p>
        <p>The growth of natural gas import in Italy is an important factor at the median quantile level, and the FTSE index has a statistically significant impact on the carbon futures price during extreme events (i.e., at the high quantile level), which is novel.</p>
        <p>In the last section, we have seen many results of factor analysis under different quantile levels, where the time spans from 2009 to 2020. However, as we all know, 2020 is a quite different year due to the worldwide pandemic. Coronavirus has impacted everyone and every area of people's life, e.g., people have been asked to work from home to keep social distancing, many factories have been temporarily closed, a huge number of flights have been canceled, there are very few cars on the street in most cities, and so on.</p>
        <p>Thus, a natural question arises: does the extreme event in 2020 have an impact on our previous findings of the carbon price? A straightforward approach to answer this question is constructing an additional index associated with the happening/absence of the extreme event, and then testing the significance of this new index variable. Based on this idea, first we design a dummy variable in which the element is 0 when the samples are collected in the time period before 2020, and the element is 1 when the data are collected in 2020. Then we have an augmented set of variables which includes this dummy variable and the variables considered in Table 5. Finally we conduct a similar quantile regression as in the last section to see whether the extreme event has a significant impact on the carbon futures price in the EU or not. The following Table 6 shows the estimated coefficients of quantile regressions under the low, medium, and high quantile levels (τ = 0.1, 0.5, 0.9), respectively, and the results of the dummy variable are displayed on the last row in the table.</p>
        <p>[Table 6 about here.]</p>
        <p>From Table 6, we can see that the dummy variable is statistically significant at the highest level (1%) under all quantile levels, which means the extreme event in 2020 has a huge impact on the carbon futures price in the EU, no matter what quantile levels we care about. This finding, however, is not so surprising, since it is quite intuitive that the "pause" of human activities in the whole world results in drastically reduced energy consumption and CO 2 emission, thus the carbon price fluctuates.</p>
        <p>Now we know the Covid-19 significantly influences the carbon futures price in the EU, but can we have a more in-depth understanding of the difference introduced by the extreme event? We tackle this problem by conducting further analysis on the data collected in 2020 only. A similar quantile regression with variables shown in Table 5 is taken into consideration to make a reasonable comparison. The following Table 7 displays the estimated coefficients of quantile regressions under different quantile levels using the data in 2020 only.</p>
        <p>[Table 7 about here.]</p>
        <p>Comparing the results in Table 7 with Table 5, there are indeed some differences.</p>
        <p>At the low quantile level (τ = 0.1), the Europe Brent spot price return, the crude oil closing stock return in the UK, and the growth of natural gas import in Italy are significant in both 5 and Table 7, which means they are key factors at the quantile level (τ = 0.1) regardless of extreme conditions. However, the growth of natural gas import in France and the natural gas futures return in the US are significant in Table 7, but not in Table 5, which means these two factors have an impact on the carbon price when the extreme event happens.</p>
        <p>At the median quantile level (τ = 0.5), similar to Table 5, there is only one significant variable in Table 7, i.e., the growth of crude oil import in Germany. It means, during the extreme event, this factor is important to the carbon price at the median quantile level.</p>
        <p>At the high quantile level (τ = 0.9), the Europe Brent spot price return and the crude oil closing stock return in the UK are also significant in both tables, as well as the growth of natural gas production in the UK and the FTSE index, which again demonstrates the importance of these factors in both the long term period and the extreme event. Besides, the growth of crude oil import in Germany, the growth of natural gas import in the UK, and the growth of natural gas production in France are shown to be significant in Table 7, but not in Table 5. This means during the extreme event, the high quantile level of the carbon price has more determinants than the normal situation.</p>
        <p>Generally speaking, compared with Table 5, there are more factors shown to have significant relationships with the carbon price during the extreme event, especially at the extreme quantile levels (the low/high quantile level). This finding somehow coincides with the reality, as in extreme cases, price fluctuations are usually quite different from normal periods, and it is often caused by more factors in different areas (Ren et al., 2019;Duan et al., 2021).</p>
        <p>Thus far, we have analyzed impacts and differences caused by the Covid-19. Now here is another question: are our estimators robust to the extreme event? To answer this question, we use the data before 2020, i.e., the time spans from 2009 to 2019, and conduct a similar quantile regression as in Table 5 to obtain comparable results.</p>
        <p>The following Table 8 displays the estimated coefficients of quantile regressions under different quantile levels using the data before 2020.</p>
        <p>[Table 8 about here.]</p>
        <p>Comparing the results in Table 8 and Table 5 where the time spans from 2009 to 2020, we can know that most of the significant predictors in Table 5 are also shown to be significant in Table 8, which indicates the robustness of our estimators against the extreme event 2020. At the low quantile level, there are three factors: the Europe Brent spot price return, the growth of natural gas production in the UK, and the growth of natural gas import in Italy, are significant in both Table 8 andTable 5. Here is only one predictor, the crude oil stock return in the UK, which has been found significant in Table 5, but not in Table 8. This may be caused by the extreme event, as it is also significant in Table 7 which considers the data in the extreme event only.</p>
        <p>At the median quantile level, the only significant predictor in Table 5, the growth of natural gas import in Italy, is found to be significant in Table 8 as well. At the high quantile level, these two factors: the Europe Brent spot price return and the growth of natural gas production in the UK, are significant in both Table 8 andTable 5. In contrast, the crude oil closing stock return in the UK and the FTSE index are significant in Table 5, but not in Table 8. This may be due to the extreme event, since these two factors are also found to be significant when we analyze the data in 2020 only. In short, most of the significant factors with the data from 2009 to 2020 are found to be also significant with the data before 2020, which shows the robustness of our estimators against the extreme event due to the Covid-19.</p>
        <p>This paper proposes the Quantile Group LASSO model and the Quantile Group SCAD model for the prediction of dynamics of carbon futures returns in the EU ETS. The predictive performance of the two models is examined to outperform popular and competing ones as demonstrated by smaller values of both M SP E and M AP E for the former two. Through a dimension-reduction mechanism, the most powerful carbon-return predictors are selected from a wide group of potential candidates, and the selected predictors are allowed to be different across various quantiles of carbon futures returns.</p>
        <p>Moreover, a quantile regression method is applied to identify possibly heterogeneous impacts of the predictors on carbon returns across the data distribution. The quantile method is documented to outperform the mean shrinkage models, especially when data like ours are featured by the abnormal price distribution, viz. non-normal distribution.</p>
        <p>Our results indicate that the Brent spot price, the crude oil closing stock in the UK, and the growth of natural gas production in the UK exert statistically significant impacts on carbon futures returns during extreme events (i.e., at low and high quantile levels).</p>
        <p>Importantly, our obtained estimators are shown to be robust against the extreme event due to the Covid-19 epidemic.</p>
        <p>We demonstrate that the most powerful factors/predictors for carbon futures returns and their corresponding impacts hinge on carbon market conditions (i.e., whether normal or extreme scenarios). Policymakers and market practitioners should recognize such the variation, rather than simply assuming that the statistically significant carbon-return predictors are constant over the carbon price distribution, for a clearer interpretation of carbon return dynamics. Our findings possess statistically significant implications for various stakeholders. In a carbon-constrained environment, a clear comprehension of the significant carbon-return predictors and their impacts can help policymakers uncover the dynamics of carbon returns. Through this, the effectiveness of policy interventions towards carbon price stabilization, as well as the health and prosperity of the carbon market, is enhanced. At the same time, this study improves the assessment of production costs of carbon-intensive sectors and other carbon-consumed economic and human activities by revealing the future price dynamics of carbon emission allowances. This study also contributes to sensible risk diversifications of the 10. Short-term interest rate in the EU.</p>

        <p>M SP E and R 2 M AP E means a larger promotion of prediction ability of the candidate model over the corresponding benchmark model. Notes: (i) This table summarizes coefficient results of quantile regression under different quantile levels (τ = 0.1, τ = 0.5 and τ = 0.9) before the extreme event in 2020. (ii) At each quantile level, the model contains all the variables selected by the Quantile Group LASSO method. (iii) standard errors are in parentheses.</p>
        <p>R 2 M SP E indicates that compared with the benchmark forecast model, the candidate forecast model is more accurate and has less prediction error in terms of the M ESP criterion in the out-of-sample data set. Similarly, a positive value of R 2 M AP E means the candidate model has better forecast ability than the benchmark model in terms of the M AP E criterion in the out-of-sample data set. Moreover, the larger values of R 2 M SP E and R 2 M AP E mean the candidate model has higher forecast accuracy than the benchmark model.</p>
        <p>shows the carbon price return series is not normally distributed. This information drives us to use the Quantile Group LASSO and Quantile Group SCAD models, which can capture different information under different quantiles when the data doesn't hold the normality assumption. Based on the ADF test statistic, the data is stationary as the null hypothesis of non-stationary is rejected at the 5% significance level.</p>
        <p>This means these two models have better prediction performances than the competing models in our test.</p>
        <p>Although the ARMA, GARCH, ARMAX(S) and GARCHX(S) models are the classical and widely used time-series models in economics and financial analysis, here all of them have statistically significantly larger MSPE and MAPE values, which means lower prediction accuracy, compared with the rest high-dimensional forecast model group (the Quantile Group LASSO model, the Quantile Group SCAD model, the LASSO model, the adaptive LASSO model, the group LASSO model).</p>

        <p>The ARMAXS and GARCHXS in the list are the ARMAX and GARCHX models with selected variables described in Section 5.2.1.</p>
        <p>Due to the limited space, here we omit the results of the Quantile Group SCAD which has very similar performances as the Quantile Group Lasso.</p>
