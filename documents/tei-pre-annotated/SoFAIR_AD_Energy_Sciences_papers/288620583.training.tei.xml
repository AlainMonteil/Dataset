        <p>Visible light photocatalysis relies mainly on expensive noble metal complexes and organic dyes that are not recyclable. Heterogeneous semiconductors, which are mainly applied for artificial photosynthesis and wastewater treatment, are a promising sustainable alternative and gain increasing attention. Inorganic and organic semiconductors with suitable bandgaps are among the most widely studied heterogeneous photo-catalysts due to their high stability and recyclability. More recently, microporous materials, such as conjugated organic polymers, covalent organic frameworks, and metal organic frameworks that can be tuned and designed on a molecular level showed promising results. This review provides an overview of the most common heterogeneous photocatalysts with a focus on their applicability in organic synthesis.Visible light photocatalysis relies mainly on expensive noble metal complexes and organic dyes that are not recyclable.

        <p>Catalysis is a fundamental pillar of organic synthesis and is key to the production of commodity chemicals, complex pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. Catalysts are classified as either homogenous or heterogeneous. Homogeneous catalysis is, compared to heterogeneous catalysis, often characterized by a higher activity and selectivity. [1] Heterogeneous catalysts, on the contrary, can easily be separated and recycled. Combining the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis by anchoring soluble catalysts on insoluble supports is an appealing strategy, [1] but adds complexity to the catalytic system and often reduces the catalysts' activity and selectivity, or even result in complete deactivation. Heterogenized catalysts have often failed to outperform their soluble analogs and to achieve the potential of merging heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis. [2] In contrast to "conventional" catalysis (transition metal catalysis, organocatalysis, or Lewis acid catalysis), visible-light photocatalysis proceeds via electron or energy transfer to generate reactive intermediates of substrates or reagents rather than lowering the transition state energy. [3] Irradiation of a PC, typically a homogeneous ruthenium or iridium polypyridyl complex, results in an excited species that can accept or donate a single electron, enabling photoredox catalysis (PRC) via oxidative or reductive quenching cycles (Figure 1,A). An excited photocatalyst can alternatively also transfer its excited state energy (EnT) to a substrate or reagent to induce chemical reactions. [4] Heterogeneous photocatalysts, such as semiconductors, are operating by the same electron and energy transfer processes as homogeneous photocatalysts (Figure 1,B). [5] This is in stark contrast to conventional catalysis, where homogeneous catalysts cannot be simply substituted by a heterogeneous material. When a semiconductor absorbs photons with sufficiently high energy, electrons are excited from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB), generating simultaneously an oxidizing and a reducing species on a single particle. The generated electron holes (h + ) can oxidize electron donors whereas the electrons in the VB are able to reduce electron acceptors via single-electron transfer.Catalysis is a fundamental pillar of organic synthesis and is key to the production of commodity chemicals, complex pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals.

        <p>This review provides an overview of the most common, purely heterogeneous photocatalysts, that were successfully applied in organic synthesis focusing on catalysts and strategies that enable the use of visible light (&gt; 400 nm). Our discussion includes "traditional" semiconductors (such as TiO 2 ), conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and metal organic frameworks (MOFs). Examples of homogeneous photocatalysts that are immobilized on supports are not discussed.

Metal Oxides: TiO 2 Titanium dioxide is a naturally occurring mineral that has various applications ranging from the use as white pigment in dyes or cosmetics to its employment as photocatalyst for water purification or energy conversion. [7f] Although the large band gap semiconductor requires ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation to form electron-hole pairs, it is among the most frequently applied heterogeneous photocatalysts in organic synthesis. [7a] As the use of TiO 2 and other metal oxide semiconductors as PCs in organic synthesis was recently surveyed in an excellent review articles, [7a,8] we limit our discussion to a representative set of examples.This review provides an overview of the most common, purely heterogeneous photocatalysts, that were successfully applied in organic synthesis focusing on catalysts and strategies that enable the use of visible light (&gt; 400 nm).

        <p>The radical decarboxylation of carboxylic acids, results in carbon-centered radicals, and can be initiated using UV(A) irradiation (&gt; 365 nm) in the presence of TiO 2 P25. This is the most commonly applied form of TiO 2 in photocatalysis and consists of the polymorphs anatase and rutile a ratio of 8 : 2. Under anhydrous, anaerobic conditions, the resulting stabilized carbon-centered radicals were coupled with N-substituted maleimides in moderate yields (Scheme 1). [9] In case of aryloxyacetic acids (1), mixtures of the desired radical addition product (3) and chromene derivatives (4), which are generated in a photocatalytic addition-cyclization cascade, were observed.The radical decarboxylation of carboxylic acids, results in carbon-centered radicals, and can be initiated using UV(A) irradiation (&gt; 365 nm) in the presence of TiO 2 P25.

        <p>Irradiation with UV-light is, however, often associated with severe drawbacks as high-energy photons can cause selectivity issues by, for example, activating substrates or reagents directly. To overcome such issues, strategies that enable the utilization of visible light are intensively investigated.Irradiation with UV-light is, however, often associated with severe drawbacks as high-energy photons can cause selectivity issues by, for example, activating substrates or reagents directly.

        <p>A straightforward, but limited strategy that is able to extend the absorption of TiO 2 to visible light is the formation of a surface complex between TiO 2 and a heteroatom-containing substrate that creates a new electron donor level above the VB of the metal oxide (Figure 2). [5b] Rueping and co-workers used this approach for the Meerwein-arylation of heteroaromatic compounds (6) with aryldiazonium salts (5) catalyzed by TiO 2 P25 (Scheme 2). [10] Mechanistic investigations indicated that a TiO 2 À diazoether species (8), which absorbs visible light, is initially formed. The catalytic method enabled the arylation of furan, thiophene and pyridine in good to excellent yields.A straightforward, but limited strategy that is able to extend the absorption of TiO 2 to visible light is the formation of a surface complex between TiO 2 and a heteroatom-containing substrate that creates a new electron donor level above the VB of the metal oxide (Figure 2).

        <p>The same group reported on a TiO 2 P25 catalyzed multicomponent Ugi-type reaction of N,N-dimethylanilines (9) with isocyanides (10) and water that results in the formation of αamino amides (11, Scheme 3). [11] The formation of a surface complex between the aniline derivative (9) and TiO 2 was proposed to be responsible for visible light absorption. The metal oxide semiconductor was recycled five times without any loss in catalytic activity. Surface interactions between N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) and TiO 2 enabled the synthesis of symmetrical and unsymmetrical disulfides (14) from thiols (12, 13) using visible light (Scheme 4, A).

        <p>Visible-light mediated thiol-ene reactions were shown to benefit from the presence of TiO 2 P25 (Scheme 4, B). [14] Binding of the thiol starting materials is likely responsible for the ability to use visible light as energy source. Although product formation was also observed in the absence of a catalyst in some cases, the efficiency and scope of this transformation was significantly increased when catalytic amounts of the heterogeneous semiconductor were added.Visible-light mediated thiol-ene reactions were shown to benefit from the presence of TiO 2 P25 (Scheme 4, B).

        <p>The groups of Scaiano and Yoon showed that a TiO 2 À indole surface complex (21) can be excited with a 460 nm light source to promote the radical Diels-Alder reaction between indoles (17) and 1,3-cylcohexadienes (18) (Scheme 5). [15] To prevent fragmentation of the cycloaddition products, the reaction was carried out in presence of acetyl chloride (19) resulting in the desired acetylated tetrahydrocarbazoles (20). Platinum-doped titanium dioxide (Pt(0.2 %)@TiO 2 ) was shown to double the photon efficiency in comparison to undoped TiO 2 , and a range of protected tetrahydrocarbazoles (20) was synthesized in moderate to good yield. [16] During a recycling study, a decrease in the activity of Pt(0.2 %)@TiO 2 was observed. The authors hypothesized that surface poisoning from organic compounds, most likely derived from indole, is responsible for catalyst deactivation.The groups of Scaiano and Yoon showed that a TiO 2 À indole surface complex (21) can be excited with a 460 nm light source to promote the radical Diels-Alder reaction between indoles (17) and 1,3-cylcohexadienes (18) (Scheme 5).

        <p>While surface complexation results only in a small redshift of the absorption of TiO 2 , decoration of the metal oxide semiconductor with sensitizers (dyes) extends the absorption to a broader range of the visible light spectrum. This strategy is applied in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), [17] and dyesensitized photocatalysts (DSPs) for light driven H 2 production. [18] Various functional groups are well established for the immobilization of dyes on TiO 2 in DSSCs including carboxylic acids, phosphonic acids, or sulfonic acids and various binding modes can be responsible for immobilization. [19] In most cases, an electron of the dye/sensitizer (sens) is excited from the HOMO to the LUMO, followed by injection into the CB of the semiconductor (type I sensitization, Figure 3). A "direct" electron-injection from the HOMO of the sensitizer into the semiconductor's CB upon photoexcitation is the basis of type II sensitization. [20] This mechanism is analogous to metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) in ruthenium and iridium polypyridyl complexes, and a new absorption band is formed upon binding. In both cases, the valence band position is irrelevant for light harvesting, as photons are absorbed by the sensitizer. This avoids side reactions caused by highly reactive holes that would result from direct semiconductor excitation with UV light.While surface complexation results only in a small redshift of the absorption of TiO 2 , decoration of the metal oxide semiconductor with sensitizers (dyes) extends the absorption to a broader range of the visible light spectrum.

        <p>A similar system was presented using eosin Y as sensitizer. [22] More recently, Lang and co-workers showed that the reaction works also efficiently in the absence of TEMPO (Scheme 6, B). [23] The combination of ARS@TiO 2 and TEMPO was also applied for the photocatalytic oxidation of sulfides (24) to sulfoxides (25) in the presence of oxygen (Scheme 6, C). [24] TEMPO was shown to be crucial for the stability of the photocatalyst as its addition avoids photodegradation of ARS. Eosin Y sensitized TiO 2 (EoY@TiO 2 ) enabled the aerobic oxidation of benzyl ethers (26) to the corresponding benzoate esters (27) in moderate to excellent yield (Scheme 7).

[26] A decreased catalytic activity was observed during recycling experiments and could be correlated to a decrease of the amount of the dye due to leaching.A comparison of various sensitizers immobilized on TiO 2 showed that ARS is well suited for a photocatalytic cascade radical CÀ C bond formation/cyclization of N,N-dimethylaniline (9) with N-phenylmaleimides (2) that results in 28 (Scheme 8).

        <p>Photocatalysis can be combined with other catalytic strategies, such as organocatalysis (dual catalysis).

        <p>Another possibility to extend the absorption of metal oxide semiconductors is metal doping via chemical or physical methods. [7f] Modifying TiO 2 with metal nanoparticles can narrow the band gap, and increase the photocatalytic activity due to an improved charge separation, as well as the reduction of electron-hole recombination rates.Another possibility to extend the absorption of metal oxide semiconductors is metal doping via chemical or physical methods.

        <p>Shen and co-workers showed that the surface modification of TiO 2 with nickel(II) oxide results in a material that absorbs visible light and is able to induce the photocatalytic cascade radical CÀ C bond formation/cyclization of N,N-dimethylanilines (9) with N-phenylmaleimides (2, Scheme 11). [31] The red shift upon surface modification is attributed to a rise of the valence band potential resulting from metal doping. Importantly, the photocatalyst did not show any reduction in its activity over nine cycles during a recyclability study.Shen and co-workers showed that the surface modification of TiO 2 with nickel(II) oxide results in a material that absorbs visible light and is able to induce the photocatalytic cascade radical CÀ C bond formation/cyclization of N,N-dimethylanilines (9) with N-phenylmaleimides (2, Scheme 11).

        <p>By decorating TiO 2 with samarium oxide nanoparticles, Scaiano and co-workers developed a single material (Sm x O y @TiO 2 ) that can be used for dual photo/Lewis acid catalyzed intramolecular [2 + 2] cycloadditions of symmetrical aryl (bis)enones (39, Scheme 12). [32] The desired cycloadducts (40-42) were formed in moderate to good yield (47-72 %) using 400 nm LEDs. The same system was also used for the photoreductive cyclization of chalcones. Reusability studies showed no loss of efficiency over five cycles for the photoreductive coupling of chalcones.By decorating TiO 2 with samarium oxide nanoparticles, Scaiano and co-workers developed a single material (Sm x O y @TiO 2 ) that can be used for dual photo/Lewis acid catalyzed intramolecular [2 + 2] cycloadditions of symmetrical aryl (bis)enones (39, Scheme 12).

        <p>Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) absorb visible light due to the surface plasmon resonance effect. The Au NPs can be excited with visible light, leading to an injection of the excited electrons into the CB of TiO 2 , which can be subsequently transferred to an electron acceptor. [5b] This strategy was used for the dimerization of benzyl bromides (43) using green light (Scheme 13). [33] Studies with the radical trap TEMPO suggest that the mechanism proceeds via a benzyl radical intermediate. A decrease in the catalytic activity during a recyclability study was related to a growth of the Au particles from 2.5 to 4.1 nm. TiO 2 decorated with palladium nanoparticles (NPs) was used for the photocatalytic Ullmann cross-coupling of an electron-rich ( 45) and an electron-poor (46) aryl iodide (Scheme 14). [34] Interestingly, only the combination of UVA (368 nm) and blue (465 nm) light resulted in a relatively selective formation of the desired cross-coupling product (47). If only blue light was used, almost no conversion was observed whereas UVA light alone suffered from low selectivity. The authors concluded that the Pd NPs capture the electrons from the conduction band after excitation with UVA light, thereby increasing the lifetime of the electron-hole pair. Blue light is proposed to be exclusively absorbed by Pd NPs, initiating a final photoreductive elimination. Recyclability studies showed Scheme 10.

[33] that the conversion stays constant over four cycles, whereas the selectivity decreases.Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) absorb visible light due to the surface plasmon resonance effect. The Au NPs can be excited with visible light, leading to an injection of the excited electrons into the CB of TiO 2 , which can be subsequently transferred to an electron acceptor. [5b] This strategy was used for the dimerization of benzyl bromides (43) using green light (Scheme 13). [33] Studies with the radical trap TEMPO suggest that the mechanism proceeds via a benzyl radical intermediate. A decrease in the catalytic activity during a recyclability study was related to a growth of the Au particles from 2.5 to 4.1 nm. TiO 2 decorated with palladium nanoparticles (NPs) was used for the photocatalytic Ullmann cross-coupling of an electron-rich ( 45) and an electron-poor (46) aryl iodide (Scheme 14). [34] Interestingly, only the combination of UVA (368 nm) and blue (465 nm) light resulted in a relatively selective formation of the desired cross-coupling product (47). If only blue light was used, almost no conversion was observed whereas UVA light alone suffered from low selectivity. The authors concluded that the Pd NPs capture the electrons from the conduction band after excitation with UVA light, thereby increasing the lifetime of the electron-hole pair. Blue light is proposed to be exclusively absorbed by Pd NPs, initiating a final photoreductive elimination. Recyclability studies showed Scheme 10.

[65] While no reaction was observed in the absence of O 2 , the addition of Pt nanoparticles enabled the coupling under anaerobic conditions. The evolution of hydrogen indicated that the Pt NPs consume the generated electrons via proton reduction. The same functionalized carbon nitride material was used for the sulfonylation of alkenes where it also outperformed other photocatalysts, including eosin Y and other CN derivatives. [66] A carbon nitride material that was synthesized from cyanuric acid, melamine and barbituric acid (CMBÀ CN) was used for the decarboxylative fluorination of phenoxyacetic acids (113) and phenylacetic acid derivatives using Selectfluor in a continuous flow approach (Scheme 28). [67] A packed-bed reactor was not suitable as carbon nitride semiconductors are opaque. Handling of solid materials in other flow reactor types is challenging and leads to clogging.

        <p>Potassium poly(heptazine imide), an ionic carbon nitride derivative with a high valence band potential of + 2.54 eV vs RHE (g-CN: 1.82 eV vs. RHE), is perfectly suited for reactions that benefit from strong single electron oxidants. 1,3,4-oxadiazoles (116) can be effectively synthesized starting from N-acylhydrazones (115) using KÀ PHI as photocatalyst and S 8 as electron donor at 80 °C in nonpolar solvents (Scheme 29, A). [68] When the reaction was carried out at lower temperatures (50 °C), the rate decreased significantly and 43 % instead of 80 % yield were reached. Heating to 80 °C was also crucial for high reaction rates during the light-mediated, KÀ PHI catalyzed synthesis of 1,3-disubstituted-5,6-dihydropyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinolines (DHIPQs, 119) from tetrahydroisoquinolines (117) and chalcones (118) using blue light (Scheme 29, B). [69] Chalcones (118) can also be (cyclo)dimerized with KÀ PHI photocatalysis in the presence of TEOA (triethanolamine) as electron donor, resulting in cylcopentanoles (120, Scheme 29, C).

        <p>Poly(benzothiadiazoles) are among the most common CMPs applied in organic synthesis and were recently reviewed. [71] The versatile PCs are commonly synthesized via metal-catalyzed cross-couplings of benzothiadiazole (acceptor) and other aromatic (donor) monomer units. A poly(benzothiadiazole) CMP was, for example, used for the formation of singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) and its utilization in the synthesis of ascaridole (122) from α-terpinene (121, Scheme 30,A). [72] The CMP (CMPÀ BTD) was synthesized by the polymerization of 4,7dibromobenzo [c][1,2,5]thiadiazole with 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene via Sonogashira cross-couplings. SiO 2 nanoparticles were used as templates to increase the porosity of the polymeric materials. The BET surface was raised from 270 m 2 /g for a CMP (no SiO 2 template) to 660 m 2 /g, when 60 mg/mL SiO 2 nanoparticles were used. The high porosity and specific surface area were beneficial for an enhanced accessibility of the excited solid polymer for solubilized oxygen, leading to increased reaction rates. Using a continuous-flow system, a 1 O 2 production of up to 1 mmol/min was measured with a maximum quantum yield of 0.06.

Photocatalytic synthesis of benzophosphole oxides using a CTF. [92] catalyze the cross-dehydrogenative coupling of N-aryl substituted tetrahydroisoquinoline with nucleophiles. [94] Other examples of COFs that were successfully applied in photocatalysis are two-dimensional, porphyrin-(PorÀ COF), [95] and benzoxazole-based frameworks [96] (BenzoÀ COF; Scheme 41). The fully organic, heterogeneous PCs were used to activate O 2 for the aerobic photocatalytic hydroxylation of aryl boronic acids (BenzoÀ COF), and the oxidation of amines (PorÀ COF).</p>
        <p>Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous, highly ordered crystalline solids that consist of metal ions/cluster and organic linkers. In case of photocatalytically active MOFs, the metallic cluster (semiconductor), or a photocatalyst that is encapsulated in the pores of a photocatalytically inactive MOF can be responsible for their catalytic activity. [97] The vast majority of MOF photocatalysts, however, gain their photocatalytic activity from the incorporation of a molecular dye into the organic linker structure (Scheme 42). This can be, for example, accomplished, by using the ligand of Ru polypyridyl complexes as linker in combination with ZrCl 4 in presence of acetic acid (A). [98] Similarly an iridium polypyridyl complex serves as (metal) organic linker in a ZrÀ MOF. [99] Jiang and co-workers showed that porphyrin dyes can be combined with ZrOCl 2 • 8H 2 O to obtain a photocatalytically active MOF (B). [100] Similarly, a porphyrin-based MOF can be obtained using indium metal clusters. [101] Zn-based MOFs were synthesized using a combination of bis(3,5-dicarboxyphenyl)pyridine and bis(3,5-dicarboxyphenyl)methylpyridinium (C). [102] All of these heterogeneous materials showed promising photocatalytic activity in reactions involving the generation of reactive oxygen species that were discussed in the previous chapters, including the oxidation of amines, the hydroxylation of arylboronic acids, and the dehydrogenative CÀ C coupling of N-aryl tetrahydroisoquinolines with various nucleophiles.Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous, highly ordered crystalline solids that consist of metal ions/cluster and organic linkers.

        <p>Duan and colleagues demonstrated that the incorporation of a photoactive polyoxometalate ([SiW 11 O 29 Ru(H 2 O)] 5À ) in a copper(II)-bipyridine MOF (Scheme 43) is also able to catalyze the light-mediated photocatalytic aza-Henry reaction of N-aryl tetrahydroisoquinolines with nitromethane in the presence of oxygen. [103] Based on control experiments using K 5 [SiW 11 O 39 Ru (H 2 O)] • 10H 2 O as PC with and without Cu(NO 3 ) 2 • 3H 2 O as cocatalyst, the authors claimed that Cu activates the nucleophile and this effect is significantly enhanced when it is directly connected to the PC through the MOF structure due to close spatial proximity.Duan and colleagues demonstrated that the incorporation of a photoactive polyoxometalate ([SiW 11 O 29 Ru(H 2 O)] 5À ) in a copper(II)-bipyridine MOF (Scheme 43) is also able to catalyze the light-mediated photocatalytic aza-Henry reaction of N-aryl tetrahydroisoquinolines with nitromethane in the presence of oxygen.

        <p>The same group developed a MOF (ZnÀ PYI) that contains a stereoselective organocatalyst (L-or D-pyrollidin-2-ylimdazole) and a photocatalytically active triphenylamine moiety in the organic unit. [104] The asymmetric, photocatalytically active MOF enabled the α-alkylation of aliphatic aldehydes (87) with diethyl 2-bromomalonate (31) using visible light with high enantioselectivity (Scheme 44). More recently, the same reaction was catalyzed by a MOF where a red shift of the ligand, that contains a chromophore and an asymmetric ligand, was observed after the MOF assembly.

        <p>More recently, a two-dimensional metal organic layer was constructed using Hafnium clusters that are bridged by photocatalytically active iridium complexes (Scheme 46). [107] The metal-organic layers were functionalized with a nickel complex, resulting in a single material that is capable of catalysing the cross-coupling reactions of aryl halides (62) with thiols (98-S), alcohols (98-O), or potassium trifluoroborates (144). The fully heterogeneous dual catalyst was recycled five times without losing its catalytic activity and only low amounts of leached Hf (&lt; 0.3 %), Ir (&lt; 0.6 %) and Ni (&lt; 0.1 %) were determined by ICP-OES.More recently, a two-dimensional metal organic layer was constructed using Hafnium clusters that are bridged by photocatalytically active iridium complexes (Scheme 46).

        <p>A variety of heterogeneous materials has been employed as recyclable photocatalysts for organic synthesis. Inorganic semi-Scheme 42. Precursors for metal organic frameworks that contain a photocatalytically active linker unit. (A) ZrÀ MOF with Ru polypyridyl complex. [98] (B) ZrÀ MOF with porphyrin linker.

Fully heterogeneous dual nickel/photocatalytic thioetherfication using a ZrÀ MOF that contains a photocatalytically active Ir complex and a Ni complex in the organic unit. [106] conductors, especially TiO 2 , are most commonly used to replace homogeneous photocatalysts. Surface complexation, dye sensitization and doping are common methods to enable the wideband gap semiconductor to harvest visible light up to near IR, which is rarely reached by homogeneous photocatalysts. The combination of photocatalysts with heterogeneous nanoparticles that are capable of photon upconversion is an alternative strategy for accessing near IR light and might be a promising concept for, for example, the application of photocatalysis in in vivo experiments. [108] However, apart from other inorganic semiconductors, purely organic semiconductors of the carbon nitride family have rapidly emerged to a useful alternative that harvest visible light without the need for doping. The straightforward preparation of these classical semiconductors from cheap starting materials is one of the main advantages. It was also shown that semiconductor photocatalysis could be used in synergy with other catalytic reactions in dual catalytic processes.A variety of heterogeneous materials has been employed as recyclable photocatalysts for organic synthesis.

        <p>As each heterogeneous photocatalyst has advantages and disadvantages, the decision for the best material has to be made case-by-case considering the respective reaction, the reaction scale and the available light source. A problem that all heterogeneous photocatalysts have in common is their limited applicability for large-scale reactions. This problem is easy to address for homogeneous photocatalysis using flow technologies, but challenging for semiconductors and only a few approaches exist. It is therefore important to note that research in heterogeneous photocatalysis should not only focus on new transformations and improved catalysts, but also needs dedicated technologies for their applications.As each heterogeneous photocatalyst has advantages and disadvantages, the decision for the best material has to be made case-by-case considering the respective reaction, the reaction scale and the available light source.
