        <p>Antibiotics are used worldwide and their residues have been detected in multiple aquatic environments, which threaten both the human health and ecological environment. An efficient process is necessary for the thorough degradation of antibiotic contaminants in wastewater. Photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants has the advantages of environmental friendliness, safety and thoroughness. In this study, titanium silicon molecular sieve-loaded carbon nitride (TS-1/C 3 N 4 ) composite photocatalysts were synthesised and used for the photocatalytic degradation of ofloxacin (OFX) wastewater. An artificial neural network (ANN) was proposed based on the experimental data, and combined with genetic algorithm (GA) to optimise the experimental parameters for the favourable reaction performance. The maximum removal efficiency (RE) at 82.92% was measured under the optimal experimental parameters (1.55 g/L catalyst, 58.60 % TS-1 loading and 49.38 mW/cm 2 luminous power density). Moreover, the influence of wastewater constituents on the RE was investigated both experimentally and through modelling via the ANN model. The experimental results revealed that the adsorption of OFX on the photocatalyst and the RE were reduced in the presence of wastewater constituents, probably due to their competitive adsorption and the subsequent reaction with the reactive species and light-shielding effect. The model gave an absolute relative deviation (ARD %) for the synergistic effect of cations, metal ions and anions at 6.88 %, 1.04 % and 1.77 %, respectively, thus showing a good ability to predict the synergistic interplay of wastewater components. This work may provide important insights and solutions for the photocatalytic treatment of antibiotic wastewater.Antibiotics are used worldwide and their residues have been detected in multiple aquatic environments, which threaten both the human health and ecological environment.

        <p>Antibiotics are used worldwide and their residues have been detected in various aquatic environments at the level of about 10 0 ~ 10 5 ng/L [1]. Antibiotic residues lead to environmental pollution and induce the production of resistant genes, which not only threatens our ecological environment but also affects the environmental and biological health [2]. Wastewater analysis of various countries shows that the most prominent antibiotics in wastewater are fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides and macrocyclic esters [3]. Among them, ofloxacin (OFX) is a thirdgeneration fluoroquinolone synthetic drug that kills bacteria by inhibiting DNA synthesis and replication. The antibacterial activity of OFX is due to a piperazine unit and a two-ring core (including a pyridine ring and benzene ring substituted with a fluorine atom) as shown in Fig. 1. Moreover, the methyl substituent on the piperazinyl ring and the carbonyl (C-4 position) and carboxyl (C-3 position) groups on the pyridine ring enhance its antibacterial activity. OFX is widely used due to its broad antibacterial spectrum, strong antibacterial activity, good bioavailability and effective oral administration.Antibiotics are used worldwide and their residues have been detected in various aquatic environments at the level of about 10 0 ~ 10 5 ng/L [1].

        <p>Photocatalytic degradation is a promising method for treating OFX wastewater due to its high efficiency, thoroughness and being ecofriendly compared with other removal methods such as physical absorption, microbial decomposition and membrane separation [4][5][6][7]. Recently, carbon nitride (C 3 N 4 ) has received much attention due to its good response to visible light and being eco-friendly [8]. The rapid recombination of photo-induced electrons and holes restricted the application of C 3 N 4 . To overcome this drawback, titanium silicon molecular sieve (TS-1) and C 3 N 4 hybrid materials such as TS-1/C 3 N 4 composite [9], Fe doped C 3 N 4 and TS-1 hybrid materials [10] and Agmodified 2D/2D hydroxylated g-C 3 N 4 /TS-1 [11] were synthesized and used for photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B, selective oxidation and CO 2 reduction. However, TS-1/C 3 N 4 composites used for OFX degradation were not reported in the literature. Some C 3 N 4 -based photocatalysts such as C 3 N 4 /NH 2 -MIL-88B(Fe) heterostructure [12], MoO 3 / Ag/C 3 N 4 [13] and MnWO 4 /C 3 N 4 [14] composites were synthesized and used for photocatalytic degradation of OFX wastewater. The removal efficiency (RE) of OFX was greater than 90% at irradiation time higher than 70 min and light intensity larger 100 mW/cm 2 . Thus, improving photocatalytic activity is still a challenge in photocatalytic degradation of OFX.Photocatalytic degradation is a promising method for treating OFX wastewater due to its high efficiency, thoroughness and being ecofriendly compared with other removal methods such as physical absorption, microbial decomposition and membrane separation [4][5][6][7].

        <p>Artificial neural network (ANN), as a useful tool, has attracted much attention in the field of photocatalytic research because it is suitable to extrapolate predictive models by recognising patterns in multidimensional data sets [15][16][17][18][19]. Three-layer ANNs were proposed based on the experimental data. The experimental parameters (including antibiotics concentration, catalyst dose, solution pH and light irradiation time) were optimized for photocatalytic degradation of oxytetracycline using TiO 2 [20] and ciprofloxacin using TiO 2 /montmorillonite composite [21]. Although some operational parameters in the photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics process were optimized by using ANN models, the influence of parameters about composite photocatalyt preparation was not included and optimized, thus this field suffers from the lack of photocatalyst screening model.Artificial neural network (ANN), as a useful tool, has attracted much attention in the field of photocatalytic research because it is suitable to extrapolate predictive models by recognising patterns in multidimensional data sets [15][16][17][18][19].

        <p>Furthermore, water analysis results show that various constituents (such as cations, metal ions and anions) are present in antibiotic wastewater [22,23]. The wastewater components will probably consume the photo-generated reactive species and cause light-shielding effect in the photocatalytic degradation process of antibiotics. The adverse effect of environmental factors in wastewater on the photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics was reported in several literatures [24,25]. However, a model for predicting the interaction effect of wastewater constituents has not been reported in the photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics.Furthermore, water analysis results show that various constituents (such as cations, metal ions and anions) are present in antibiotic wastewater [22,23].

        <p>Therefore, a comprehensive study including the enhancement of photocatalytic activity, optimization of operational parameters and prediction of synergistic effects of wastewater components was carried out in this work. Firstly, titanium silicon molecular sieve (TS-1) was used to synthesize TS-1 loaded C 3 N 4 (TS-1/C 3 N 4 ) composite because of its response to ultraviolet light, large specific surface area and strong adsorption capability [26]. The effect of experimental parameters (TS-1 loading, catalyst dose and luminous power density (LPD)) and wastewater constituents (such as cations, metal ions and anions) on RE was systematically investigated. The degradation mechanism was proposed based on the photoelectrical property characterization and radical trapping experiments. The degradation routes were deduced by analysing the intermediates in the degradation process.Therefore, a comprehensive study including the enhancement of photocatalytic activity, optimization of operational parameters and prediction of synergistic effects of wastewater components was carried out in this work.

Finally, additional validation experiments under the optimal conditions and synergistic effect of impurities were conducted.

        <p>The synthesis of TS-1/C 3 N 4 composites were modified based on the literature [27]. The composites were prepared followed by the steps below. An aqueous melamine solution (20.0 g/L) was prepared, followed by the addition of 2.0 g TS-1. The mixture was ultrasonicated for 10 min, followed by magnetic stirring at 90 • C for 10 min. This process was repeated three times to ensure an adequate mixing. After drying by rotary evaporation (90 • C water bath, -0.098 MPa), a white solid was obtained. TS-1/C 3 N 4 composites of different TS-1 loadings (marked as × % TS-1/C 3 N 4 , the detailed explanation was shown in Text S1) were obtained after being calcined at 550 • C for 2 h in a muffle oven (heating rate from room temperature: 5 • C/min). The bare C 3 N 4 used for the photocatalytic degradation test was synthesized using a direct calcination method (i.e., of the solid melamine). The detailed description is shown in the supporting information (Text S2). In addition, reference experiments were conducted to prepare the bare C 3 N 4 by the rotary evaporation-calcination method (i.e., the same method as used in the composite photocatalyst preparation, without adding TS-1) for comparison with the C 3 N 4 obtained by the above direct calcination method.The synthesis of TS-1/C 3 N 4 composites were modified based on the literature [27].

The diffraction peaks of TS-1 are at 8.1 • , 9.0 • , 23.1 • , 24.0 • and 24.4 • , which reflected an orthorhombic symmetry and corresponds to an MFI zeolite structure (JCPDS No. 70-4276) [29].

The characteristic peaks at approximately 1634 cm -1 , 1456 cm -1 , cm -1 , 1318 cm -1 and 1236 cm -1 belonged to the vibration of C-N heterocycles in the aromatic system of C 3 N 4 [30]. The sharp characteristic peak at approximately 805 cm -1 was caused by the characteristic absorption peak of the triazine unit.

The FT-IR spectrum of TS-1/C 3 N 4 contained the characteristic peaks for TS-1 and C 3 N 4 , which also indicated that the TS-1/C 3 N 4 composites were synthesised successfully.</p>

The average diameter of TS-1 was approximately 400 nm. The SEM images of TS-1/C 3 N 4 composites showed that the TS-1 nanospheres were loaded onto the surface of bulk C 3 N 4 . Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mappings of TS-1/C 3 N 4 composites were shown in Fig. 3. The darker area (TS-1) was loaded onto the lighter area (C 3 N 4 ) as shown in Fig. 3a. The lattice spacings of 1.002 nm and 0.336 nm corresponded to (2 0 0) crystal plane of TS-1 [33] and (0 0 2) crystal plane of C 3 N 4 [34], respectively. The distribution of four elements (C, N, Ti and Si) is shown in Fig. 3b. C and N elements were distributed over the entire area, while Ti and Si elements were distributed in the core area. The results of the EDS mappings indicate that TS-1 was loaded onto the surface of C 3 N 4 . The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of TS-1/C 3 N 4 composites were shown in Fig. 4. Five elements (C, N, Si, O and Ti) were present in the XPS survey spectra (Fig. 4a). Two typical peaks at 288.3 eV and 285.1 eV (Fig. 4b) were assigned to the sp 2 -hybridized carbon atom attached to the three nitrogen atoms of C 3 N 4 [35]. Fig. 4c showed three peaks of N 1 s at 398.7 eV, 400.7 eV and 404.8 eV corresponding to C-N = C, N-(C) 3 and the positive charge localisation in the heterocycles, respectively [36]. The peak at 104.2 eV (Fig. 4d) corresponded to the binding energy of Si 2p in TS-1 [37]. The peak at 533.6 eV (Fig. 4e) was assigned to the binding energy of O 1 s. Two typical peaks of Ti 2p (Fig. 4f) at 460.0 eV and 465.8 eV corresponded to the binding energy of Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2 [29].

        <p>The results of adsorption test are shown in Figure S2. It can be seen that the adsorption balance was established after about 30 min in the dark. Thus, adsorption experiments were carried out for 30 min in the dark before photocatalytic degradation experiment. In addition, the OFX concentration was analysed by UV-vis spectrophotometer and HPLC, separately. The values obtained from different analysis methods were almost consistent with each other. So, UV-vis was a good and fast alternative analysis method to HPLC. 5a, the RE (defined in equation ( 4)) increased with the TS-1 loading when it was below 50.00%. However, the RE tended to decrease at higher TS-1 loadings. The reason may be that more TS-1 in TS-1/C 3 N 4 composite inhibited the photoabsorption ability of the composite. The maximum RE was thus obtained using 50.00% TS-1/ C 3 N 4 composites. The corresponding pseudo first-order kinetic curves of TS-1/C 3 N 4 composites with different TS-1 loading were shown in Fig. 5b.

        <p>The REs of OFX under various catalyst doses (of 50.00 % TS-1 loading) were shown in Fig. 5c. The OFX adsorption on the TS-1/C 3 N 4 composites increased with catalyst dose. The reaction rates were different with various catalyst doses. The RE increased with catalyst dose when it was lower than 1.4 g/L, especially for irradiation time less than 20 mins. The RE didn't change much at the time range of 20-30 mins, probably because the degradation reaction was almost over. Fig. 5d showed that the maximum slope of the kinetic curve was at a catalyst dose of 1.4 g/L. The corresponding k maximum was at 0.12 min -1 (Table S3). This could be due to the light-shielding effect caused by a higher catalyst dose, which prevented the photoabsorption and restricted the production of reactive species in the photocatalytic reaction. Consequently, a lower removal performance was obtained at a higher catalyst dose (e.g., of 1.6 g/L).The REs of OFX under various catalyst doses (of 50.00 % TS-1 loading) were shown in Fig. 5c.

        <p>The RE results and kinetic curves for different LPD were shown in Fig. 5e and5f. The RE was positively correlated with LPD. At LPD below 40 mW/cm 2 , the degradation reaction progressed very slowly in the first 10 min and become faster over longer reaction times, possibly because of the sufficient accumulation of the reactive species. The value of k increased with LPD as shown in Fig. 5f, thus the reaction rate was obviously larger upon further increasing LPD (e.g., at 50 mW/cm 2 ). It was reported that the relation between the reaction rate (r) and LPD (I) is r ∝ I β , where the value of β varied from 0 to 1 depending on LPD [38]. So, the kinetic curves for different LPD values were not always fitted well by first-order kinetics in Fig. 5f. A similar phenomenon was also observed in the photocatalytic oxidation of Escherischia coli and Aspergillus niger as reported in the literature [39].The RE results and kinetic curves for different LPD were shown in Fig. 5e and5f.

        <p>The reusability and stability of 50.00% TS-1/C 3 N 4 composites were also investigated. After the degradation of antibiotics, the solid photocatalyst was recycled by centrifugation, and then washed with anhydrous ethanol for three times to remove the impurities remaining on the catalyst. The dried photocatalyst was obtained after drying in oven (70℃ for 3 h) and reused for the photocatalytic degradation of OFX. The XRD patterns and photocatalytic degradation results of the recycled catalyst are shown in Figure S6, and the corresponding SEM images are shown in Figure S5. From Figure S5 and Figure S6 (a), it can be seen that the structure and morphology of the recycled TS-1/C 3 N 4 composite remained almost consistent with the original composite. As shown in Figure S6 (b), the photocatalytic activity of the TS-1/C 3 N 4 composite was stable and didn't decrease significantly after four cycles. A slight decrease of the RE may be due to the loss of catalyst during the recycling process.

Fig. 7b depicted EIS Nyquist plots of C 3 N 4 , TS-1 and TS-1/C 3 N 4 composites.

        <p>In order to study the photocatalytic mechanism of the TS-1/C 3 N 4 composites, radical trapping experiments were undertaken by adding scavengers to the photodegradation system. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA-2Na), isopropanol (IPA) and nitrogen were used to eliminate h + , hydroxyl radical (⋅OH) and superoxide radical (⋅O 2 -), respectively. The effect of scavengers on the RE was shown in Fig. 8a. The lowest RE was obtained in the presence of EDTA-2Na, indicating that h + was the primary contributor in the degradation of OFX. When nitrogen was injected into the system instead of air (i.e., there was an absence of O 2 in the OFX solution), the RE of OFX showed an obvious decrease, suggesting that ⋅O 2 -was one of the main active species. The RE didn't decrease significantly in the presence of IPA, which suggested that ⋅OH was not a key active species in the photo-degradation process. The oxidation potential of OFX was about 0.95 V (vs. SCE (Saturated Calomel Electrode)) as measured in the literature [41,42]. The E VB values of TS-1 and C 3 N 4 were both higher than the oxidation potential, which indicates that h + can oxidise OFX to environmentally friendly products. The results here were consistent with the results of radical trapping experiments. So, the good photocatalytic degradation performance of TS-1/C 3 N 4 composites was ascribed to the improved light response, enhanced separation efficiency of photo-generated carriers and increased adsorption ability.In order to study the photocatalytic mechanism of the TS-1/C 3 N 4 composites, radical trapping experiments were undertaken by adding scavengers to the photodegradation system.

        <p>The intermediates in the degradation process of OFX after 10 min irradiation were analysed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and the mass spectra were shown in Figure S9. Four possible degradation routes were proposed based on the LC-MS results and literature [43][44][45][46][47]. As shown in Fig. 9, the first route occurred through the destruction of the methylpiperazine ring and the breaking of the morpholine moiety. The intermediate (m/z = 336) was obtained by losing a -C 2 H 4 group in the piperazine ring. The fragment (m/z = 279) was produced by the cleavage of the C-N bond and loss of a -C 3 H 7 N group. The intermediate (m/z = 167) was obtained by destruction of the morpholine moiety. A similar degradation pathway was also reported in the literature [43,44,46]. In the second pathway, the methyl group on the piperazine ring was oxidised and replaced by a hydroxyl group. The intermediate (m/z = 364) was produced by dealkylation and addition of hydroxyl. After the dealkylation reaction, an intermediate (m/z = 350) was obtained by cleavage of a C-C bond (m/z = 364), which also occurred in a previous study [44]. The third route involved a decarboxylation reaction, and the fragment (m/z = 318) was obtained after losing a -COOH group as reported in the literature [47]. In the final route, carbonylation and hydroxylation reactions may occur at the piperazinyl ring. A fragment (m/z = 364) was obtained by opening the methylpiperazine ring of the intermediate (m/z = 392). Another fragment (m/z = 350) was obtained after a methyl group on the piperazine ring was removed. This degradation route was also proposed in the literature [45]. In conclusion, the primary degradation reactions included the destruction of the piperazine ring, dealkylation and decarboxylation.

        <p>Fig. 10 showed that the adsorption of OFX on the photocatalyst decreased when increasing the concentration of metal ions (such as MgCl 2 , CaCl 2 , KCl, NaCl and Na 2 SO 4 ). The possible reason was that these metal ions precipitated on the photocatalyst and reduced the adsorption of OFX on the photocatalyst as proposed in the literature [25]. The removal performance also decreased with the increasing concentration of metal ions. However, the influence of various metal ions on the removal performance of OFX differed from each other. When the RE was 82.27% without wastewater constituents (i.e., after 30 min irradiation), the corresponding RE value of OFX in the presence of MgCl 2 (70 mg/L), CaCl 2 (35 mg/L) and KCl (30 mg/L) was 77.17%, 80.31% and 74.86%, respectively. In contrast, the RE of the OFX solution was found to be 64.65 % and 72.87 % in the presence of NaCl (400 mg/L) and Na 2 SO 4 (300 mg/L), respectively. Therefore, the influence of MgCl 2 , CaCl 2 and KCl in wastewater on the RE was minor and the small reduction of RE may be due to the competitive reactions between wastewater impurities and the reactive species. However, sodium salts (NaCl and Na 2 SO 4 ) exhibited an obvious impact. The reason may be that the competitive reaction and light-shielding effects were all presented in the photocatalytic degradation process under higher concentration of sodium salts. Besides, the RE of the OFX solution was found as 73.59 % or 80.49 % in the presence of 200 mg/L NaCl or Na 2 SO 4 . This implied a less obvious influence of Na 2 SO 4 on the RE than that of NaCl.

        <p>In order to study the effect of nitrogen and phosphorus in wastewater on the RE, the chemicals including NH 4 Cl and Na 5 P 3 O 10 were added in the OFX solution separately. The RE of OFX in the presence of NH 4 Cl and Na 5 P 3 O 10 was shown in Fig. 11. Similar to the effect observed for metal ions, the adsorption of OFX on the photocatalyst decreased upon increasing the concentration of NH 4 Cl or Na 5 P 3 O 10 . This was possibly because of the competitive adsorption incurred by such impurity precipitation on the photocatalyst. Fig. 11a showed that the presence of NH 4 Cl (less than 40 mg/L) contributed slightly to the increased photocatalytic degradation of OFX (i.e. under 30 min irradiation). The small contribution may be due to the weak acid nature of NH 4 Cl aqueous solution which was favorable for the photocatalytic degradation of OFX as proposed in the literature [25]. However, this promotional effect become less significant with increasing the concentration of NH 4 Cl and eventually an inhibitory effect appeared when the concentration of NH 4 Cl was 60 mg/L. The possible reason was that Cl -scavenging ⋅OH played a dominant role under higher concentrations of NH 4 Cl. The similar inhibitory effect was reported in the research about the photocatalytic degradation of congo red [53]. The adverse influence of Na 5 P 3 O 10 on the photocatalytic degradation was shown in Fig. 11b. The RE was about 78% under different Na 5 P 3 O 10 doses (2-12 mg/L), lower than that without wastewater impurities (82.27%). Such inhibitory effect may be attributed to the competitive reaction between Na 5 P 3 O 10 and reactive species, though it didn't change significantly with the concentration of Na 5 P 3 O 10 (likely due to the low range of doses).In order to study the effect of nitrogen and phosphorus in wastewater on the RE, the chemicals including NH 4 Cl and Na 5 P 3 O 10 were added in the OFX solution separately. The RE of OFX in the presence of NH 4 Cl and Na 5 P 3 O 10 was shown in Fig. 11. Similar to the effect observed for metal ions, the adsorption of OFX on the photocatalyst decreased upon increasing the concentration of NH 4 Cl or Na 5 P 3 O 10 . This was possibly because of the competitive adsorption incurred by such impurity precipitation on the photocatalyst. Fig. 11a showed that the presence of NH 4 Cl (less than 40 mg/L) contributed slightly to the increased photocatalytic degradation of OFX (i.e. under 30 min irradiation). The small contribution may be due to the weak acid nature of NH 4 Cl aqueous solution which was favorable for the photocatalytic degradation of OFX as proposed in the literature [25]. However, this promotional effect become less significant with increasing the concentration of NH 4 Cl and eventually an inhibitory effect appeared when the concentration of NH 4 Cl was 60 mg/L. The possible reason was that Cl -scavenging ⋅OH played a dominant role under higher concentrations of NH 4 Cl.

        <p>Catalyst dose, TS-1 loading and LPD were used as input variables for the development of the ANN model, and the RE of OFX was used as the output variable. The proposed topology of the ANN was 3:3:1. The measured data were randomly divided into training sets (80 %), validation sets (10 %) and testing sets (10 %). The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was used to train the model after normalization. The statistical parameters of the ANN were R = 0.9993 (eq. ( 7)) and MSE = 4.45 × 10 -5 (eq. ( 8)). The weights and biases of the neural network were listed in Table S4. The comparison of experimental data and calculated values were shown in Fig. 12a. Nearly all data points fell on the diagonal line, indicating that the measured data were consistent with the estimated results by the model. As listed in Table S5, the average absolute relative deviation (AARD %) was 0.56 %, and the maximum absolute relative deviation (MARD %) was 2.52 %. The above results showed that the model had a good predictive ability and can be used to simulate the process of the photocatalytic degradation of OFX. The relative importance (RI) of the experimental parameters was calculated by Garson's formula [54] based on weights and biases. Fig. 12b showed that the RI values of catalyst dose, TS-1 loading and LPD were 17 %, 60 % and 23 %, respectively. The results suggested that the effect of TS-1 loading was The neural network model was used as the fitness function, and GA was used to optimise the experimental parameters. The number of iterations in GA was 100, the population size was 10, the crossover probability was 0.4, and the mutation probability was 0.2. The optimal RE was predicted to be 84.59 % after 30 min irradiation and the corresponding experimental parameters were 1.55 g/L catalyst, 58.60 % TS-1 loading and 49.38 mW/cm 2 LPD. The verification experiment was then performed under the optimal experimental conditions and the experimental RE was found as 82.92%.

        <p>Besides, the comparison of RE over TS-1/C 3 N 4 under optimal parameters with the RE values reported in literatures [12][13][14] is shown in Table 1. The current catalyst could obtain a good RE under relatively lower light density and shorter irradiation time than those used in literatures, which indicate a significant energy saving and efficiency increase for the photocatalytic degradation of OFX process.Besides, the comparison of RE over TS-1/C 3 N 4 under optimal parameters with the RE values reported in literatures [12][13][14] is shown in Table 1.

        <p>To verify the predictive ability of the ANN model, the experimental data and the calculated values of RE in the presence of wastewater constituents were compared and shown in Figure S11.

        <p>In order to further investigate the ability of the ANN model to predict the synergistic effect of wastewater components, photocatalytic degradation experiments with more complex OFX solutions (including the mixed cations, metal ions and/or anions) were carried out. The above proposed ANN model was used to calculate the RE of the synergistic effect of wastewater components. The comparison between the experimental and predicted results was shown in Table 2. The ARD % of the RE in the presence of synergistic effects of cations, metal ions and anions was found as 6.88 %, 1.04 % and 1.77 %, respectively.

        <p>Experimental study and theoretical modelling of the photocatalytic degradation process of OFX were studied in this work, over the synthesized TS-1/C 3 N 4 composite photocatalysts. The RE values were measured under various experimental conditions (TS-1 loading, catalyst dose, LPD and wastewater impurities). The optimal experimental parameters were identified by combining ANN model and GA optimization. The maximum RE (82.92%) was measured under the optimal experimental parameters (1.55 g/L catalyst, 58.60 % TS-1 loading and 49.38 mW/cm 2 luminous power density), and it was good agreement with the model predictions. Moreover, an ANN model for the photocatalytic treatment of OFX wastewater in the presence of synergistic effects of wastewater impurities was established based on the experimental RE results. The good predicting ability of the ANN model for describing the performance decrease of the photocatalytic degradation of OFX has been validated in the additional experiments in the presence of cations, metal ions and anions.

Based on the abundant experimental data including different photocatalysts, various pollutants and different environmental conditions, the current ANN model might be expanded to more experimental parameters and environmental conditions, towards establishing a comprehensive model by combining machine learning and molecule descriptors.In addition to salts, nitrogen and phosphorus studied in this work, the synergistic influence of more wastewater constituents such as solution pH, antibiotic concentration, natural organic matter (NOM), bicarbonate and heavy metal on the photocatalytic degradation deserves in-depth research as well and thus will be studied in our future work.
