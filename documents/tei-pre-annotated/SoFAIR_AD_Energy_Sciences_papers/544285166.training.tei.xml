        <p>Due to the increasing demand for energy worldwide, photovoltaic (PV) cooling systems have become an important field of research in recent years. The most important factor affecting the performance of a solar PV cell is its operating temperature. For harvesting heat from solar PV systems, phase change material (PCM) is regarded as the most effective material. As a result, this study discusses and describes the effect of using PCM and nanoPCM (NPCM) in cooling PV cells. This research reviews the various feasible hybrid photovoltaic thermal (PVT)-PCM and PVT-NPCM methods used for cooling PV. The concept focusing on PV cooling technology is discussed where air, water and nanofluid are used as the working medium in combination with PCM and NPCM. It is observed that when high performance heat transfer and improved cooling rate are needed, active cooling methods are favoured, whereas passive cooling methods rely on themselves and don't require extra power. It is also found that the effectiveness of applying PCM or NPCM for thermal control is heavily influenced by atmospheric air temperatures as well as the precise PCM or NPCM used. It is envisaged that this review will help new researchers better understand the qualities and capabilities of each cooling strategy. They are offered to help investigators quickly identify the basic science that led to the development of the thermal performance system and also improve the overall performance of the PV system.Due to the increasing demand for energy worldwide, photovoltaic (PV) cooling systems have become an important field of research in recent years.

        <p>Photovoltaic (PV) technology, which directly converts solar radiation and photon energy into electricity through semiconductor band gaps, made great progress in scientific research and commercial applications and is still on track to improve efficiency and to reduce the costs. Firstly, in 1961, Shockley and Queisser suggested a theoretical limit for the AM1.5 solar spectrum of 30% conversion efficiency [1], updated later with a 33.7% more accurate calculation with a 1.34 eV band gap.Photovoltaic (PV) technology, which directly converts solar radiation and photon energy into electricity through semiconductor band gaps, made great progress in scientific research and commercial applications and is still on track to improve efficiency and to reduce the costs.

        <p>According to a recent report, the efficiency of the single crystal silicon (c-Si) transition cell measured in the AM1.5 spectrum reached 26.7%. In fact, compared to small laboratory cells, the efficiency of commercial solar modules is inevitably lower. It is ∼18% for single crystal silicon modules on the market. Also, most of these efficiency results are confirmed under standard test conditions, but in practice PV modules do not work under these conditions. The intensity and spectrum of solar radiation are highly dependent upon time and climate under real environmental conditions. In addition, since most of the solar energy is converted to heat in addition to generating electricity, operating temperatures far exceed 25 • C. As the study shows, the coefficient of temperature efficiency is highly material dependent. Sadly, the relatively high efficiency drop rate of c-Si modules is 0.4% to 0.5%/ • C, even up to 0.65%/ • C [2]. High temperatures also increase the rate of ageing in the PV module.According to a recent report, the efficiency of the single crystal silicon (c-Si) transition cell measured in the AM1.5 spectrum reached 26.7%.

        <p>Among the various applications, c-Si solar cells are the first and most used, in that mainly mono c-Si and poly c-Si pv modules accounting for ∼90% of the market. Thanks to commercial success, worldwide use of solar systems today exceeds 500 GW, and the average selling price continues to decline to 0.26$/W in July 2018. Solar cells absorb 80% of solar energy, but with an efficiency of 24.7%, the current conversion of electricity is only 12% to 18% [3]. The balanced solar energy is converted into heat and the temperature of the solar cell is increased by 40 • C higher than the ambient temperature. A thermally controlled solar cell is more efficient than the existing solar cell, which is currently attracting considerable attention in this aspect.Among the various applications, c-Si solar cells are the first and most used, in that mainly mono c-Si and poly c-Si pv modules accounting for ∼90% of the market.

        <p>Efforts are being made to decrease the operating temperature of solar cells incorporating passive and active cooling devices. For active cooling, which needs air, water or a nanofluid to be cycled through the circuit, an additional blower or pump is typically needed. Passive cooling of PV cells eliminates the need for additional electricity. Figure 1 depicts an active/passive cooling technology that has witnessed adequate research in an attempt to regulate and foster thermal dissipation. An essential economic aspect is the ability of a hybrid active cooling system to balance electricity usage. It is indeed possible to decrease the power loss of the PV array and boost the module's dependability with sufficient cooling.Efforts are being made to decrease the operating temperature of solar cells incorporating passive and active cooling devices.

        <p>The most important factor affecting the performance of a solar cell is its operating temperature. This temperature varies depending on ambient temperature, wind speed and insolation. Various thermal control solutions have been proposed to keep the cell temperature as low as possible in order to avoid the loss of efficiency such as an active cooling mechanism based on pumped water or air that requires mechanical or electrical energy to operate, and a passive cooling mechanism that works on the density difference such as PCMs. No matter how many different ways researchers have found to improve the PVT system's thermal performance, it seems the field of PVT systems using PCM and NEPCM is continually developing. This article examines the many ways of cooling PV panels. In the first instance, the active techniques that may be used for PV thermal control are discussed and the second section covers passive strategies. Finally, some recommendations are made in light of the techniques examined and their effect on the efficiency of PV panels, with the goal of further improving their efficiency while simultaneously decreasing their working temperature.The most important factor affecting the performance of a solar cell is its operating temperature.

        <p>The primary advantage of active cooling systems is their higher capacity to remove heat, despite the fact that they have a more complicated structure as a result of the extra equipment necessary. Since active cooling techniques need additional energy inputs, such as air and water, to drive coolant. After two decades of development, the PVT configuration technology was developed, which can simultaneously collect PV electricity and harmful heat from the PV panel, and is becoming a hot topic with different working fluids for heat extraction. The different working fluids used in active cooling systems are nanofluids, thermal fluids, water and air.

Different parametric conditions that affect the system efficiency have been explored in their work, including the air flow rate and solar irradiation. The influence of the inserting fin has also been studied to evaluate thermal and electrical efficiency. Their result indicated that the inclusion of fines has improved electrical and thermal efficiency of the system by 10.5% and 15%, respectively. The variation in air flow from 0.03 kg/s to 0.15 kg/s resulted in major improvements in electrical efficiency. Rising solar radiation decreases cell efficiency, mainly due to a higher temperature. The geometric characteristics of the aircooled system can be used as a part of PVT system performance, in addition to these variables.

        <p>A comparative analysis of BIPV and BIPVT systems was carried out by V.V. Tyagi et al. [9]. It was recorded that almost 16% more usable electric energy generated in a medium sized two-story building than the same size BIPV roof. BIPVT systems generate more electricity than BIPV, and as a result of this, break-even costs have often been favourable compared with BIPV systems. M. Farshchimonfared et al.

        <p>To put the theoretical research of the air-based PVT-PCM system to the test, Sohel and Cooper [23] utilized 
            <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> and 
            <rs type="software">TRNSYS</rs> tools. As air flow rate rises, energy and thermal quality have increased. The wind speed had a great impact, the thermal efficiency decreases with rise in wind speed. This is because greater wind speeds lead to more heat loss from the PVT surface to the atmosphere. Due to high wind speed, the PV module eliminates the full amount of heat and loses the heat in the area. The electrical and thermal efficiency of the system found was 11% and 29%, respectively. At various wind speeds Khanna et al. [24] carried out the energy enhancement in PV system with air cooled PVT-PCM. The findings revealed that at a wind angle of 75 • to 0 • , an electrical efficiency increase from 7% to 8.60%. Even when wind speeds are changed from 6.0 m/s to 0.2 m/s, power is dropped from to 22.8 W/m 2 to 11.8 W/m 2 . The decline in wind speed reduces electrical efficiency, the highest power output obtained is 192 W/m 2 at 6 m/s wind speed. Innovative solar assisted heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system has been developed by Fiorentini et al. [25] and implemented in a PCM integrated thermal PV device. In China and Australia, tests were carried out. At the flow rate between 160 l/s and 170 l/s the electrical output, thermal output and total performance were 11.2%, 9% and 17.2%, respectively. The author also pointed out that increasing air flow, decreasing temperatures of the PV module and enhancing power, thermal and overall system performance.

        <p>The collector thermal capacitance is also an efficient means of cooling the cell temperature. Integrated PCM content helps reduce PV cells temperature in a PV module, because of its high latent thermal capability, by absorbing heat as they are melting. Indeed, not only does the PCM layer retain a suitable temperature in the PV cells, but it also serves for a subsequent function as a heat sink for storing waste heat. The use of solar energy in a PVT collector is considered to be intermittent, so the thermal energy storage will improve this issue by storing the heat in the day and discharge it at night. A schematic representation of water cooled PVT-PCM is depicted in Figure 5.The collector thermal capacitance is also an efficient means of cooling the cell temperature.

The results showed that electrical efficiency, power output and thermal efficiency of PVT system is 6.98%, 956.45 kJ and 58.35% and PVT-PCM system is 8.16%, 1117.8 kJ and 70.34%, respectively. In addition, overall thermal efficiency conversion for PVT-PCM and PVT were 76.87% and 63.93%, respectively. Su et al. [47] conducted performance of the PV thermal system with PCM. The aim of the research was to analyse the effect of the melting temperature on the PCM sheet, as well as optimum PCM thickness in the PVT-PCM method dependent on water. It was established that a 40 • C melting point and PCM of 3.4 cm thickness had the highest overall performance and 30 • C melting point had the maximum electrical effectiveness.

For a long time, the PV temperature drops by 25 • C in PV-NPCM plates, the highest power output increase was 11.5%. For similar works pertinent to PCM and solar energy utilization, readers are advised to refer to [98][99][100][101][102][103][104][105][106][107][108][109][110][111][112]. PCM and solar energy combination works are found to be very common in effective utilization.</p>
        <p>According to the literature, in active cooling PVT system, thermal energy may be used for space heating, HVAC, crop drying, etc. PCM in an active cooling system absorbs excess heat from PV panels that is not converted to electricity. The latent heat of PCM helps reduce the panel temperature, keeping it near to ambient during peak sunlight hours. As PCM's thermal conductivity rises in proportion to the concentration of nanoparticles, PVT-NEPCM achieves higher overall efficiency than air-based PVT or PVT-PCM systems. The water-based PVT-PCM system is more efficient over the long run than PV alone. Thermal and electrical performance of nanoparticles modified with water-based PVT-PCM was shown to be significantly improved. Additionally, the weight percentage of nanoparticles and thermal conductivity of NEPCM increased. Additionally, it was discovered that the effects of temperature on the thermal conductivity of NEPCM are similar to those of pure PCM. Active cooling of PVs is strongly suggested when using nanofluids. However, even though nanofluids need extra power consumption to flow, this may be readily compensated for by efficiency increase and extra thermal power generated by heat absorption in the nanofluid itself. Compared to the most typical PVT systems, the passive cooled PV-PCM system is sluggish and inadequate when it comes to cooling down. However, this system relies on itself and requires less maintenance since there is no flow of fluid or additional power required.According to the literature, in active cooling PVT system, thermal energy may be used for space heating, HVAC, crop drying, etc. PCM in an active cooling system absorbs excess heat from PV panels that is not converted to electricity.

        <p>Different factors, such as environmental conditions, material and operating temperatures, influence the efficacy of solar PV cell. The temperature plays a key role in the cell's electrical and thermal efficiency and is preferably kept low as possible. These parameters included during research of numerous active and passive methods in the literature are thoroughly analysed because of the necessity of using an appropriate thermal control solution. When the high performance of heat transfer and improved cooling rate are necessary, active methods are favoured. Air and water are the most widely used fluids in successful methods for cooling PV cell. The model of the cooling channels, their mass flow speed and type coolant used have the greatest influence on the efficiency of active cooling methods. Using nanofluids in active cooling cases improves heat removal rates from PV cell even further. The advantage of passive cooling methods is that they rely on themselves and don't require extra power while retaining a simplified structure. NPCMs are successfully used as passive thermal control strategies for PV cell. The melting temperature of NPCM has a significant influence on cell temperature. The effectiveness of applying NPCM for thermal control is heavily influenced by atmospheric air temperatures as well as the precise NPCM used. The methods used in thermal engineering for heat transfer augmentation, such as incorporating various forms of nanoparticles, are applicable for improving the thermal control of PV cells.Different factors, such as environmental conditions, material and operating temperatures, influence the efficacy of solar PV cell.

Due to the improved heat transfer qualities, convective and radiant losses have been proven to be minimized. • The thermal conductivity of NPCM was determined by the size of the nanoparticles. • There is a tremendous increase in using NEPCM to regulate and improve the thermal performance of PV panels in order to increase their energy output. • In nanofluid PVT-PCM systems, when the mass concentration of nanoparticles in the base fluid rises, viscosity and pressure decrease. As a consequence, the cost of energy rises as the pumping power per unit length rises. • The payback term for a PVT system could be reduced by increasing the system's overall performance.• The configuration of the cooling channels, their flow rates and the coolant type are the primary determinants of the performance of active cooling techniques. • The use of nanofluids and NPCM in active cooling significantly improves heat removal rate. • The viscosity, thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity and convective heat transfer coefficient of the system are all improved when NPCM is used in PVT.

        <p>The PV module generated electricity during the use of waste heat in warm air supplied to the heat pump and then stored it in the radiant PCM plate. This short-term heat contained in PCM was then used for heating space. A computational analysis of the interconnected PVT system PCM has been performed. Parameters such as wind speed, direction and dust have been taken into account. Three different forms of organic PCM have been selected. About 8 to 12 • C drop in PV panel temperature was noticed. The results concluded that the PV module maximal and average reduction temperature for a low flow and normal flow rate were 3.7 • C and 3.4 • C and 4.3 • C and 3.6 • C, respectively.
