        <p>E LECTRIC power generation from grid-connected and standalone photovoltaic (PV) plants has seen a spectacular increasing rate in the last decade, where a global solar installation of 509 GW has been reached in 2018 and is expected to reach 1,296 GW in 2023 [1]. In spite of this important installed PV capacity, low energy yields due to poor power management at PV array and power processing unit levels are still an open problem [2]- [4].E LECTRIC power generation from grid-connected and standalone photovoltaic (PV) plants has seen a spectacular increasing rate in the last decade, where a global solar installation of 509 GW has been reached in 2018 and is expected to reach 1,296 GW in 2023 [1]. In spite of this important installed PV capacity, low energy yields due to poor power management at PV array and power processing unit levels are still an open problem [2]- [4].</p>
        <p>Common configuration of grid-connected PV systems consists of using a central inverter with a dc-dc converter responsible for the extraction of the maximum available power of the whole PV array. However, this topology is highly sensitive to mismatch and the presence of partial shadows in the PV array, where significant power losses may occur [5]. Another scheme of PV array configuration consists of using multistrings topology with distributed dc-dc converters allowing continuous service of the whole PV array or a part of it and consequently minimizing power losses [6]- [8]. In such topology, each PV string is connected with an independent dc-dc converter with its dedicated maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm, resulting in efficient extraction of the total available power [9], [10]. There are two configuration types of dc-dc converters in a multistrings PV system; series or parallel output configuration. However, the system with series configuration may have a problem of crosscoupling, where the failure of one of the converters interrupts the operation of the others.Common configuration of grid-connected PV systems consists of using a central inverter with a dc-dc converter responsible for the extraction of the maximum available power of the whole PV array.

        <p>Whatever the chosen topology, the maximum power extraction is likely compromised due to the apparition of multiple local maxima caused by the partial shadows present on the plane of the PV generator. In such circumstances, conventional MPPT algorithms, such as perturb and observe method (P&amp;O) [11], [12] or incremental conductance [13], [14], fail to track the global maximum point. To overcome the weaknesses of the conventional MPPT algorithms, several works have pointed out the advantages of using multistring topology with distributed dcdc converters based on global maximum power point tracking (GMPPT) algorithms [15]- [17]. For instance, advanced techniques based on artificial neural networks [18], [19], fuzzy logic [20], [21], dividing rectangle search control [22], sequential extremum seeking control [23], [24] have been used successfully in finding the global maximum power point (GMPP). In recent years, bioinspired optimization methods such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) [25]- [29], ant colony optimization (ACO) [30], [31], and artificial bee colony (ABC) [32], [33], [34] showed effectiveness in the determination of GMPP. In a previous work by Benyoucef et al. [32], a novel ABC-based MPPT using direct duty cycle control method for PV systems has been proposed. It has been shown that the proposed algorithm allows finding the GMPP under partially shaded and variable meteorological conditions with better tracking performances. In [32], the focus was in optimizing the output power of only one PV module or only a group of PV modules arranged in one string subject to partial shading conditions where the ABC algorithm works in a I-D search approach to provide the optimal duty cycle for the dc-dc converter. While in this artcle, the focus is on the multistring topology where each string is connected to a dc-dc converter. Regarding this configuration the aim is to derive the optimal duty cycle for each substring with only one central MPPT controller where the ABC algorithm operates in a multidimensional search approach such as highlighted in Fig. 2. Unlike the conventional method depicted in Fig. 1, where each dc-dc converter has its own search algorithm, the proposed scheme allows cost reduction and lower complexity. It is worth to mention here that this cost-effective solution allows the extraction of the real available global maximum power of each string and requires only one pair of current and voltage sensors at the common point of connection (see Fig. 2). The developed GMPPT control strategy based on the ABC optimization algorithm has been validated by a simulation study considering various I-V curves with different locations of the GMPP and by introducing a complex shading pattern on a daily irradiance profile. Experimental validation of the proposed multidimensional search algorithm has also been performed with a low-cost digital signal processor (DSP) board. In addition, the proposed control approach presented good results when compared with two other MPPT control strategies based on P&amp;O and PSO algorithms, respectively, using the same shading patterns.Whatever the chosen topology, the maximum power extraction is likely compromised due to the apparition of multiple local maxima caused by the partial shadows present on the plane of the PV generator.

        <p>Parallel connected dc-dc converters topology in multistring configuration of PV plants, shown in Fig. 1, is an effective solution in terms of flexibility of module layout, redundancy in case of source or converter failure, easier and safer installation and maintenance, and lower sensitivity to nonuniform illumination [32], [35], [36]. In such PV plant arrangement, the MPPT algorithm is commonly performed individually for each string that gives best energy harvesting. However, the main drawback of such configuration is the involved number of current and voltage sensors, especially when the number of PV strings is relatively high. An alternative solution presented in Fig. 2 allows using only one pair of current and voltage sensors to derive the maximum power from the whole PV system. Thus, the central maximum power point (MPP) controller senses the output voltage and the output current of the common dc bus and controls the individual dc-dc converters in such way to get the overall optimal power point. On the other hand, such control scheme is more appropriate when multidimensional search objective is targeted. Many researchers have used multistring configuration and advanced meta-heuristic algorithms to deal with MPPT based on central controller concept. For example, Miyatake et al. [27] have evaluated the PSO-based MPPT, Keyrouz and Georges [37] have proposed the combination of Bayesian fusion and PSO and Jiang et al. [30] have evaluated the ACO-based MPPT.

        <p>To complete this comparison study, the performances of each MPPT algorithm was tested in terms of daily power production by considering a nonuniform daily irradiance. Toward this end, the simulations were performed under varying daily irradiance and temperature profile, as shown in Fig. 12. Fig. 13 depicts the simulation results of the obtained output power when applying ABC, PSO, and P&amp;O MPPT algorithms in case of daily varying irradiance and temperature profiles. The results clearly show the power harvesting of the proposed multidimensional ABC algorithm due to the successful location of the GMPP when nonuniform irradiance occurs, whereas PSO algorithm did not always succeed to locate it. In terms of power harvesting, the proposed algorithm gives more than 3.58% compared to PSO algorithm. This result confirms the weakness of the PSO algorithm to always track the GMPP and prove that it can be trapped in local minima. P&amp;O power tracking algorithm shows less generated power compared to meta-heuristic search techniques. This is mainly due to the inherent inability of the algorithm to find the GMPP when the power curve exhibits multiple MPPs. In order to quantify, the power gain obtained by the abovementioned algorithms, the hourly array yield (YA) indicator was calculated using (5). Indeed, the hourly array yield (YA) is the hourly output energy of the PV array divided by the peak power of the PV arrays, where n is the number of samples. The result reported by the bar graph of Fig. 14 reveals that in all situations the proposed algorithm gives much more output power.To complete this comparison study, the performances of each MPPT algorithm was tested in terms of daily power production by considering a nonuniform daily irradiance.

        <p>For dynamic performance assessment, two case studies were carried out. In the first case, the PV array was tested under uniform irradiance on a sunny day. The reported output current, output voltage, the load power, and the two converters' duty cycles for this case are reported in Fig. 18. The transient responses, which take about 4 s, denote the search phase of the algorithm. At the steady, all the variables remain unchanged which means that the GMPP is reached successfully. While in the second case, the PV array is left under uniform irradiance until 20 s. After that moment, an intentional shade was applied upon a part of one PV module. The corresponding output power and converters' duty cycles are depicted in Fig. 19. The responses show clearly the tracking capabilities of the proposed algorithm in multistring configuration.For dynamic performance assessment, two case studies were carried out.

The transient responses, which take about 4 s, denote the search phase of the algorithm. At the steady, all the variables remain unchanged which means that the GMPP is reached successfully. While in the second case, the PV array is left under uniform irradiance until 20 s. After that moment, an intentional shade was applied upon a part of one PV module. The corresponding output power and converters' duty cycles are depicted in Fig. 19. The responses show clearly the tracking capabilities of the proposed algorithm in multistring configuration.</p>
        <p>In this article, the capabilities of ABC optimization algorithm, used in multidimensional based search, to extract the optimal power point from a PV plant arranged in multistring topology was presented. The proposed approach present a cost-effective solution as only one central controller and only one pair of current and voltage sensors were required. The simulation results performed under various shading patterns, either in the case of static I-V curves or in the case of dynamically irradiance changing, the results were very promising and better power harvesting than PSO approach. The experimental results carried out on two strings where the ABC algorithm was implemented in a low-cost DSP board have also shown the effectiveness and the accuracy of the proposed approach to find the available optimal power from the entire PV system. The proposed solution of extracting the optimal available power in multistring topology can be easily implemented in various practical PV systemsIn this article, the capabilities of ABC optimization algorithm, used in multidimensional based search, to extract the optimal power point from a PV plant arranged in multistring topology was presented.
