        <p>Hydrogen (H2) has received focus among several alternative fuel sources because it provides principal advantages and fulfils ideal fuel requirements. Hydrogen fuel is the same as electrochemical energy in terms of being a high-efficiency energy carrier. When it is used, it can lead to zero or near-zero emissions. For this reason, recently, many researchers and organizations have propagated H2 fuel to minimise global warming hazards. The most studied technique for the production of H2 gas from water is through the electrolysis of aqueous alkaline hydroxide solutions [1].Hydrogen (H2) has received focus among several alternative fuel sources because it provides principal advantages and fulfils ideal fuel requirements.

        <p>Electrolysis is the most common methodology to yield H2 gas using water as a clean and renewable energy resource. Electrolysis has high product purity up to 99.9 vol%, this purity can be attained on both scales large and small. The only setback is that electrolysis can also be responsible for the emission of CO2 gas if a non-renewable energy resource is used to produce the required electrochemical energy [4,5]. The materials used to construct the electrolysis cell must also withstand certain tough operating conditions and need further development in order to commercialize this clean energy method for producing hydrogen gas as fuel. This clean fuel can be yielded directly from splitting water using different techniques. These techniques include photo electrochemical hydrogen production (photo electrolysis), thermochemical water splitting and water electrolysis [6]. This study focuses on using electrolysis to split water into its core constituents of H2 and O2 gas respectively [7].Electrolysis is the most common methodology to yield H2 gas using water as a clean and renewable energy resource.

        <p>Three main methods are currently under consideration for the production of hydrogen via water electrolysis: proton exchange membrane [8], solid oxide cell and alkaline melt. The electrochemical cell of alkaline electrolysis comprises of an alkaline aqueous electrolyte, two electrodes and a microporous separator for ion conduction. The hydroxyl ions generated at cathode electrode are migrated to anode and the remaining H + ions at the cathode electrode combine with electrons to form H2 gas [9]. The two electrodes are cathode and anode from which the cathode metal possesses a good catalytic activity and the anode electrode possesses an oxide coating layer.Three main methods are currently under consideration for the production of hydrogen via water electrolysis: proton exchange membrane [8], solid oxide cell and alkaline melt.

        <p>Electrochemical studies focused on molten hydroxides for the generation of hydrogen fuel via water splitting were demonstrated by Licht et al. and Al-Shara et al. [11,12]. These studies investigated various mixed and pure alkali hydroxides as electrolytes such as Ba(OH)2, KOH, LiOH, NaOH at temperatures between 200 and 700 °C. The applied voltage range was maintained between 1.1 and 2.3 V using a nickel and platinum metal as an anode and a nickel plate as a cathode respectively. It is also mentioned that molten hydroxides act as catalyst, therefore there is no need for any additional heat [12]. A detailed study was performed by Nagai et al.

Ganley [15] studied direct electrolysis by using experimental conditions of 18 M of KOH, 400 °C temperature, 8.7 MPa partial pressure, fixed cathode of monel alloy and variable anodes (cobalt-plated nickel, lithiated nickel, monel alloy and nickel). At temperatures as low as 80 °C, the study of Anani et al.

The intermediary solution resulting in the generation of latter contained an equimolar concentration of NaOH and NaHS at experimental temperature. Two-electrode electrolysis process has been used in this study to apply a voltage to the cathode and anode to split steam through eutectic molten hydroxide.

        <p>There are limited studies that have been carried out on how the electrochemical process occurs through the steam splitting with the help of molten salt's solution for H2 gas production. Therefore, this study aims to record an escalation in the efficiency of H2 gas production by optimizing several operating parameters such as temperature and applied voltage or by changing the material used for cathode or anode construction in the electrochemical cell.

The retort has already been placed inside the pore of a vertical tube furnace. A pure alumina crucible was used to hold the mixture of hydroxide salt. Stainless steel, platinum and nickel were used as cathode, whereas stainless steel and graphite were used as anode during the experiments.

        <p>The reason for covering electrodes with an alumina tube was to prevent the mixing of H2 gas with O2 gas formed as a result of the electrolysis process. This compartment should be tightly sealed to avoid any gas leakage. The diameters of different electrodes used in this study and their areas are listed in Table 1. The total duration of the steam electrolysis process was approximately 1800 s after that hydrogen gas was collected. Direct current (DC) source of power was used for voltage applications on both electrodes. This applied voltage was altered between 1.5 and 2.5 V. It is worth mentioning that although the voltage is listed as being positive, however, the negative terminal of DC source was actually connected to the cathode. Therefore, the polarity of this electrode in reality is negative.The reason for covering electrodes with an alumina tube was to prevent the mixing of H2 gas with O2 gas formed as a result of the electrolysis process.

        <p>Before the electrolysis process was performed, a combination of argon gas and steam was introduced to the eutectic molten hydroxide. Argon gas worked as a carrier for steam introduction into the bottle. In this study, steam was generated by placing a 500 mL dreschel bottle filled with 300 mL of distilling water on a hot plate heater. The temperature of the hotplate can be varied from the insert temperature button. The argon gas inlet stream was connected to the inlet of the dreschel bottle head which was directly dipped into hot distilled water. Then, argon gas left the dreschel bottle from the outlet head. The stream of argon gas loaded with steam was connected to a ceramic tube which was then submerged in molten hydroxide [19].Before the electrolysis process was performed, a combination of argon gas and steam was introduced to the eutectic molten hydroxide.

        <p>The values that were inserted into this equation were determined as follows. The mass of H2 gas production was found from the multiplication of molecular weight and actual number of moles of H2 gas. The actual number of moles can be measured using the equation of state of gases at a temperature of 25 °C, partial pressure of hydrogen gas and actual volume of hydrogen. The partial pressure of hydrogen was calculated using Dalton's law for gases at 25 °C and 1 atm. The actual volume of hydrogen gas was calculated by multiplying the mole fraction of hydrogen gas by total volume of collected gas during the electrolysis process from cathode compartment using water displacement method.

The amount of electric charge (Q) passing through the electrolytic mixture during hydrogen gas production can be obtained by integrating the current time plots. To calculate the charge needed to produce hydrogen gas in theory, the number of electrons involved to split steam to hydrogen gas was multiplied by the Faraday constant (96485 C/mol) and the number of moles of hydrogen gas produced. Thus, higher electric charge flow indicates more hydrogen gas produced at cathode.The values that were inserted into this equation were determined as follows.

        <p>Stainless steel was employed as anode material in the electrolysis process. Therefore it should be mentioned that when it was employed at high temperatures in the eutectic molten hydroxide, it had a passivate type behavior even though it was used in a corrosive environment [22]. The stainless steel anode undergoes passivation with the creation of an outer layer shield, and there is no influence on the response of current-time plot which is directly reflected in the rate of hydrogen gas formation. These results were repeatedly obtained for four times over and thus noises were not caused by experimental errors. The noise, as mentioned earlier was due to steam splitting and the development of bubbles on the surface near nickel cathode.Stainless steel was employed as anode material in the electrolysis process.

        <p>In addition to nickel, platinum metal was also selected as a cathode for the hydrogen evolution in the eutectic molten hydroxide [24]. The recorded current-time plots for all the tested combinations are shown in comparison against St.st anode in Fig. 1 at different applied voltages. As mentioned previously, platinum is a precious metal and this prevents it from large scale industrial use, as well as limiting its usage for laboratory scale investigations. In this study, a platinum wire of 0.5 mm diameter was used. Since the diameter of the used platinum is very small, it was necessary to increase the surface area that was exposed to the electrolyte to be approximately the same as the nickel electrode surface area. This was done to ensure a smooth comparison of current flow and production rate of hydrogen gas at same operating conditions. Therefore, in order to achieve a surface area of 2.55 cm 2 , it was simply rolled into a spiral shape with 15 cm of wire length. This increase in the surface area significantly contributed to increase the current flow value at different applied voltages.In addition to nickel, platinum metal was also selected as a cathode for the hydrogen evolution in the eutectic molten hydroxide [24].

        <p>It can be observed from the current-time plots @ St.st anode that current flow increases with an increase in the applied voltage at applied operating temperatures. After electrolysis, no change can be observed on Pt electrode's surface. The reason for no change in the surface area of electrode is because platinum is an inert metal and does not inhibit the reaction occurring at its surface. It simply acts as a means to transfer electric charge from power supply to the electrolyte without undergoing any change. Platinum can also be classified as a corrosion resistance metal to specifically withstand sodium hydroxide melt under suitable conditions [25].It can be observed from the current-time plots @ St.st anode that current flow increases with an increase in the applied voltage at applied operating temperatures.

        <p>Stainless steel metal was also used as a cathode in the eutectic molten hydroxide to compare with other tested materials at same operating conditions. It can be observed from Fig. 1 that the current increases with an increase in the applied voltage. It is observed that at 225 °C, the current response is stable and the current increases approximately with an increment of 0.2 A for every 0.5 V increase in the applied voltage. This observed phenomena of the current at 225 °C is not applicable when the temperature is increased to 300 °C. However, when temperature increases, the current response curve begins to appear noisy, particularly at higher applied voltages. The escalation in the production of molecules of H2 gas around cathode is mainly liable for this noisy response of the current-time plot.

        <p>The important point that can be observed from the results of current time plot is that the overall recorded current is the highest while using nickel as cathode material during electrolysis inside the eutectic molten hydroxide might because of its good catalytic potentials [26]. These observed results are consistent for the nickel electrode at different applied voltages and different operating temperatures. Furthermore, for nickel electrode, when the applied voltage increases from 1.5 to 2.5 V, the current increased accordingly as confirmed from the mentioned plots and are in accordance with the literature [27].The important point that can be observed from the results of current time plot is that the overall recorded current is the highest while using nickel as cathode material during electrolysis inside the eutectic molten hydroxide might because of its good catalytic potentials [26].

        <p>During testing, it was also observed that at 225 °C the current increases from 0.2 to 1.4 A at an applied voltage of 1.5 to 2.5 V respectively. For stainless steel and platinum electrodes, the recorded current-time plots show that their current responses are approximately same at different applied voltages and different operating temperatures. While at 300 °C temperature, the current is recorded comparable, little bit higher for St.st than Ni at 1.5 and 2 V. It should be noted here that the steam and argon mixture was bubbled inside the eutectic molten hydroxide for an approximate duration of 600-900 s before the electrolysis process was started. From these plots obtained during electrolysis, the current flow observed was with some level of noise in most conditions. This noise observed is quite typical during electrolysis of steam via eutectic molten hydroxide and during the formation of hydrogen gas bubbles around the cathode.During testing, it was also observed that at 225 °C the current increases from 0.2 to 1.4 A at an applied voltage of 1.5 to 2.5 V respectively.

        <p>When hydrogen molecules are formed, they migrate away from the cathode in order to allow other steam molecules to be split into forming new hydrogen molecules along with the oxygen. This transfer of hydrogen and steam molecules to and from the nickel cathode surface during electrolysis process can be listed a possible reason for the noise noticed in the current-time plot. It is significant to mention here that the nickel cathode is highly stable for molten hydroxide water splitting as stated by literature [11] that corroborates with these research findings.When hydrogen molecules are formed, they migrate away from the cathode in order to allow other steam molecules to be split into forming new hydrogen molecules along with the oxygen.

        <p>The production of H2 gas was analysed using three methods, including gastec gas detector tube, hydrogen gas sensor (PRO-GASBADGE) and water displacement method. The gas sensor monitored the hydrogen gas produced up to 2000 ppm. The hydrogen gas sensor detected the hydrogen gas between 655 to 705 ppm at an applied voltage of 1.5 V and more than 2000 ppm at an applied voltage of 2 V to the electrolysis cell. This also confirmed that the only gas produced at the cathode is hydrogen.

        <p>This implies that the platinum catalytic activity decreased to allow the reaction to occur with increasing temperature. The achieved current efficiency at 225 °C was about 107.5%. The reason for being the value of the current efficiency above 100% was due to the experimental error or other side reactions happened. When stainless steel was used as cathode against same anode the efficiency reached up to 90%. When interpreting the hydrogen gas production rate and current efficiencies, different factors that need to be taken into account are ionic transfer and gas bubble behavior in the electrolyte. These factors, in turn, influence the current during electrolysis. The transfer of ions is measured from the flow field and viscosity of the electrolyte solution. With the development of electrolysis process, viscosity increases as a result of electrolyte concentration.This implies that the platinum catalytic activity decreased to allow the reaction to occur with increasing temperature.

        <p>That's why constant steam addition is carried out to preserve a constant viscosity and concentration of the electrolyte [28,29]. Yet, greater transport does not mean greater H2 generation but it is right to say that it is associated with fast reaction rates. The more the reaction rate, the more will be the bubbles formed, and this can adversely obstruct interaction of electrolyte solution with electrode material [29]. For future work, to speed up the exit of bubbles and eliminate them from the respective electrode compartment, the recirculation approach can be mechanically applied to electrolytes.That's why constant steam addition is carried out to preserve a constant viscosity and concentration of the electrolyte [28,29].
