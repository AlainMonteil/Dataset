        <p>Brackish water desalination using solar still (SS) is a low-cost sustainable solution to global water scarcity, but this technology suffers from low yield and efficiency. The judicious amalgamation of highly conductive materials with superior solar absorption behavior is one of the most effective approaches to overcome this limitation. In this regard, the present work synthesizes a novel multilayered 2-D MXene from 3-D MAX phase as a coating material for the solar absorber of a SS to improve its performance. Two different loadings of MXene (0.05 and 0.1 wt. %) were dispersed in turpentine oil/black paint (1:4) and coated onto the solar absorber of the SS. Higher MXene loading significantly augmented the thermal conductivity and solar absorptivity of the turpentine oil/black paint solution. The 0.1 wt. % MXene coated absorber provided a higher heat transfer rate from the absorber to the water, leading to a 6 % increase in water temperature and a total water yield of 2.07 kg. The theoretical calculated water yield was identical to the experimental yield with a deviation of ± 5 %, demonstrating the accuracy of thermal modelling. The average energy efficiency of the SS with 0.1 wt. % MXene in the absorber black paint coating was 36.31 %. Water quality analysis shown that the distilled water resulting from the desalination is suitable for drinking. In conclusion, MXene with its excellent thermo-physical properties and solar absorptivity will be beneficial in development of efficient solar desalination units with augmented performance for water purification.Brackish water desalination using solar still (SS) is a low-cost sustainable solution to global water scarcity, but this technology suffers from low yield and efficiency.

        <p>Circulating waters, which are the sources of clean water on this planet, are progressively shrinking in volume. On earth, 96.54 % of the water is sea-water and of the 2.53 % that is freshwater, just 0.36 % is accessible, with the rest tied up in glaciers and the polar icecaps. With increasing global population and urbanization, water demand has tremendously increased over the last decades, leading to severe exploitation of available water resources. Freshwater insufficiency is the foremost threat for humans [1][2][3]. Thus, it is very important to explore effective methods for generating clean water from other sources such as seawater, wastewater, and contaminated ground water [4].Circulating waters, which are the sources of clean water on this planet, are progressively shrinking in volume.

        <p>Sea-water desalination is the most promising method to meet the escalating worldwide requirements for freshwater. Large scale commercial desalination units, operated by mechanical or thermal energy, are already available and in operation, utilizing technologies such as membrane distillation, humidification-dehumidification, reverse osmosis, and multistage distillation units [5][6][7]. However, these desalination methods necessitate centralized units along with developed infrastructure, and thus, they are not suitable for rural and remote places with severe clean water scarcity [8]. Small sized compact passive desalting units with low maintenance costs could be easily deployed in such locations to fulfill the freshwater demands and improve local living standards. Solar still (SS) is the simplest and most reliable passive type desalination unit which convert sun-light into thermal energy used to purify brackish water through distillation making it potable [9]. Conventional SS mainly rely on the 'solar absorption' and heating a bulk brackish water to promote vaporization, which is then utilized to collect the purified water through condensation. However, the major limitation of conventional SS is its low 'solar thermal' cumulative efficiency (defined as the total evaporation enthalpy of the distillate water over the total energy from the sun-light input), as the large quantity of cold bulk brackish water used as input requires a lot of solar energy to be heated (distilled). The thermal and optical losses of these systems also significantly contribute towards their low efficiency.Sea-water desalination is the most promising method to meet the escalating worldwide requirements for freshwater.

        <p>To increase the water yield and efficiency of the SS, various studies have been performed using different enhancement approaches, including design modifications in the structure by designing a wick type SS [10], stepped SS [11], double slope SS [12] etc. Utilization of highly porous materials for enhancing water and glass cover temperature difference [13][14], carbon based materials for improved solar absorption [15] and phase change materials [16] for prolonged heat supply in the still basin have been widely used for augmented water yield in recent years. At present, the water yield of a conventional SS is generally 2-5 kg/m 2 [17] with an energy efficiency of 30 -50 % [18] and thus, there is still ample work required to further improve its performance. With significant development in materials science and nanotechnology, various researches have explored the role of coating the SS absorber using nanoparticles for increasing the solar absorption and augmenting the water yield. Arunkumar et al. [19] explored ZnO, CuO, MoO3 as coating materials for the solar absorber and examined their effects on the water yield of the SS. It was found that the CuO coated SS exhibited the highest water yield amongst all coatings tested. Thakur et al. [20] synthesized reduced graphene oxide (RGO) using the Hummer method and coated it by mixing with black paint onto the absorber of the SS. Results revealed that 12 wt. % RGO mixed into the black paint coated solar absorber increased the water yield of the SS by 41.1 %. In similar way, Sathyamurthy et al. [21] used 20 wt. % nano-silicon oxide mixed black paint coating on the absorber which improved the water productivity by 34.2 %. Kabeel et al. [22] utilized 0.1 % titanium dioxide doped into black paint to coat the absorber and enhanced the water yield of SS by 6.1 %. Some other emerging materials are also being developed [23][24][25][26][27]. It is inferred from the above outcomes that doping of conductive nanomaterials with higher solar absorption into black paint to coat the absorber increases the solar absorption, leading to higher water yield. However, all the reported work used higher loading of nanoparticles, which could leads to thermal performance degradation over the time. In addition, the higher mass fraction of nanoparticles could leads to poor life cycle owing to the lower uniformity in coating while applying onto the absorber. Consequently, the thermal performance of the absorber can be drastically affected if there is lower compatibility between the absorber and paint which could be due to the excessive amount of nanoparticle dispersion in the paint. It is also important to mention that owing to higher loading of nanoparticle which exhibits higher cost of synthesis, the overall cost of the still could significantly increase that may hinders its application in remote and rural locations for fulfillment of fresh water needs. Since, the solar stills are used throughout the year to produce portable water from the seawater / brackish water, the selection of absorber coating should be in the view of long term stability along with excellent solar absorption behavior. Therefore, nanomaterials with high temperature stability, excellent solar-absorption and low emissivity behavior (selective coating) along with higher specific surface area and thermal conductivity with optimum mass fraction should be selected for the absorber coating in order to improve the thermal performance of the SS.To increase the water yield and efficiency of the SS, various studies have been performed using different enhancement approaches, including design modifications in the structure by designing a wick type SS [10], stepped SS [11], double slope SS [12] etc. Utilization of highly porous materials for enhancing water and glass cover temperature difference [13][14], carbon based materials for improved solar absorption [15] and phase change materials [16] for prolonged heat supply in the still basin have been widely used for augmented water yield in recent years.

        <p>In 2011, Gogotsi's group introduced MXene, 2-D transition metal carbides, nitrides and carbonitrides, which have been widely explored in several applications such as energy storage [28], heat transfer fluid [29], molecular sieves [30], and electromagnetic interference shielding [31] owing to its unique adjustable surface chemistry, high aspect ratio, and excellent electrical and mechanical properties [32][33]. Among the family of MXene materials, particularly Ti3C2 exhibited excellent photo-thermal conversion behavior with a conversion efficiency ('light' to 'heat') of 100 %, which can completely absorb and dissipate the electromagnetic radiation as heat [34][35][36]. With the aforementioned absorption behavior of MXene, it is potentially very beneficial for solar steam generation and evaporation. Ming et al. [37] developed MXene/GO aerogel for solar based steam generation and demonstrated superior evaporation efficiency of 90.7 % (only 63.7 % for graphene oxide aerogel) and evaporation rate of 1.27 kg/m 2 h (0.88 kg/m 2 for graphene oxide aerogel), respectively under 1 sun (1 kW/m 2 ) irradiation.

        <p>Thus, MXene has demonstrated an excellent prospective in improving solar absorption and water evaporation. These encouraging properties together with high thermal conductivity [40] make MXene a most suitable candidate for coating of the solar absorber in the desalination unit under moderate temperature conditions. However, coating of the solar absorber with MXene for increasing the water yield of the desalination unit has not been reported to date. Therefore, to improve the performance of solar desalination unit though absorber coating approach, the present work explored MXene as a potential candidate with a lower mass fraction. In this view, we synthesized a multilayer MXene by in-situ etching and explored its role on augmenting the overall performance of the desalination unit under Indian climatic conditions. A detailed in-depth surface morphological analysis of synthesized MXene was carried out using scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopic along with elemental mapping to analyse the microstructures. Further, powder X-ray diffraction and thermo gravimetric analysis were done to ascertain the chemical purity and thermal stability of the MXene powder. Afterward, MXene was doped into black paint at different mass fractions (0.05 wt. % and 0.1 wt. %) and coated onto the solar absorber to increase the thermal performance and water yield. In addition, detailed thermodynamic analysis with energy efficiency and water quality analysis were carried out and discussed. The thermal performance and evaporation/condensation investigation provides an optimization arrangement and analysis scheme for solar desalination units containing high absorption and photo-thermal conversion based absorbers generated with novel 2-D materials. We believe that the in-depth analysis of MXene synthesis and its application for generating freshwater will definitely pave the path in development of portable solar desalination unit with excellent overall efficiency and the demonstrated approach could be potentially used to generate clean water in remote and rural location globally with minimal initial investment.Thus, MXene has demonstrated an excellent prospective in improving solar absorption and water evaporation.

        <p>Single basin SS exhibited enhanced efficiency, as compared to the pyramid SS and thus, it was selected for the experimentation [41] and the schematic arrangement of the test-setup with heat transfer through various locations is depicted in Fig. 3. A 4 mm thick transparent glass cover was used to enclose the SS from the top and its inclination angle was matched with the latitude of the experimental site (13.01° N) to receive the maximum available solar radiation and provided an optimum slope for the condensed water droplet to slide down and collect in the freshwater measuring cylinder. The SS was made air-tight using a silicon sealant. A galvanized iron channel was positioned at the lower end of glass to accumulate the condensed water drops, which slide down from the glass cover. Three clean borosilicate glass cylinders of 1000 mL capacity with an accuracy of ± 2 mL were used to collect the freshwater output from the SS. Heat loss is a major concern of SS and it is adversely affected by the water productivity and thermal performance of the SS. Therefore, the SS should be very-well insulated to minimize the heat losses.Single basin SS exhibited enhanced efficiency, as compared to the pyramid SS and thus, it was selected for the experimentation [41] and the schematic arrangement of the test-setup with heat transfer through various locations is depicted in Fig. 3. A 4 mm thick transparent glass cover was used to enclose the SS from the top and its inclination angle was matched with the latitude of the experimental site (13.01° N) to receive the maximum available solar radiation and provided an optimum slope for the condensed water droplet to slide down and collect in the freshwater measuring cylinder. The SS was made air-tight using a silicon sealant. A galvanized iron channel was positioned at the lower end of glass to accumulate the condensed water drops, which slide down from the glass cover.

        <p>Nitrile foam sheet of 20 mm thickness was provided at the bottom of the SS and a 25 mm thick nitrile sheet was used for all side walls to minimize the heat losses from the SS. The brackish water was collected from an open well from an Industrial area in Tamilnadu, India (feed-water) and the SS was filled with the brackish water using 30 mm diameter opening created at the 'front-wall' of the SS. Each SS was filled with 13 liters of the brackish feed-water before the start of experimentation and they were refilled with the feed-water every half hour based on the distilled freshwater output of the respective SS. The quality of water produced is very important for a healthy lifestyle and the proposed device is well-suited for remote locations with low-cost fabrication, thus the distillated water quality should be examined to conclude that brackish water has been sufficiently purified and that it can be further used for drinking purposes. Therefore, the quality of the brackish feed-water and distilled freshwater (after the solar desalination) were examined using a pH meter (Hanna pH, ± 0.1pH), a total dissolved solids (TDS) meter (HM Digital TDS-3, ± 2 %) and an electrical conductivity meter (VKTECH, ± 2 %). A K-type thermocouple with accuracy = ± 1 ℃ and range of 0 ℃ -100 ℃ was utilized to monitor the temperature of the absorber, water and glass cover. A solarimeter with accuracy = ± 10 W/m 2 and range of 0 W/m 2 to 2500 W/m 2 was utilized for measuring the solar radiation. The uncertainties involved in the measurement of length, width and thickness of the SS basin was determined by the equation, as follows:Nitrile foam sheet of 20 mm thickness was provided at the bottom of the SS and a 25 mm thick nitrile sheet was used for all side walls to minimize the heat losses from the SS.

        <p>Three dimensional MAX phase (Ti3AlC2) was effectively converted into two-dimensional Ti3C2, which is clearly demonstrated in the SEM images presented in Fig. 4 (A-B). As seen in the images, the self-stacking layered micro-structure of Ti3C2 is clearly visible. The layer structure formation in MXene is owing to the 'domino effect' of the van der Waals forces between the two adjacent layers. The particle size ranged between 1 μm and 10 μm, and a similar layered structure was also reported by Ghidiu et al. [45]. The other peaks at (004) and (008) also demonstrated the effective synthesis of MXene. Fig. 7 presents the TGA analysis of pure MXene for evaluating its mass decomposition under different temperature conditions. As shown in Fig. 7 under a nitrogen atmosphere, the weight loss in the first stage (room temperature to 200 °C) is ⁓ 6.9 %, owing to the losses of physically adsorbed water and hydrochloric acid from the MXene surface. The weight loss in the second stage of ⁓ 0.2 % in the temperature range of 200 -800 °C (and ⁓7.1 % from room temperature to 800 °C) is mainly due to the loss of chemically adsorbed water, which is the OH groups attached on the surface of Ti3C2. Similar results of ⁓5 % weight loss from room temperature to 800 °C was reported for Ti3C2 by Li et al. [46]. It is inferred from the outcomes that the synthesized MXene is highly stable at high temperatures and thus is very suitable for high temperature application like solar absorber coating.Three dimensional MAX phase (Ti3AlC2) was effectively converted into two-dimensional Ti3C2, which is clearly demonstrated in the SEM images presented in Fig. 4 (A-B).

        <p>The thermal conductivity of MXene dispersed in turpentine oil solution is a very imperative factor which directly influences the heat transfer behavior of the solar absorber during the operational hours. The remarkably augmented TC with increasing the mass fraction of MXene could be owing to the excellent TC of MXene nano-flakes at high loading along with their excellent surface area to volume ratio. The unique two dimensional structure of MXene, could provide an excellent heat percolating network, leading to remarkable improvement in the TC of the solution. It is also important to note that inter-flake thermal resistance (ΣR) of MXene cannot be neglected in the TC analysis owing to the existence of 'R' between the individual MXene flakes at the junction's along with the scattering of phonons between adjacent MXene flakes. Therefore, to increase the TC, ΣR should be reduced by improving the interaction between the MXene flakes. In addition, the synthesis route of MXene is also a critical parameter in improving the TC. Recently, a comparative study was reported on the role of MXene synthesis in the TC enhancement. Liu et al. [48] prepared Ti3C2Tx by selectively etching the Al from Ti3AlC2. In this work, multilayer un-delaminated Ti3C2Tx film was prepared, which retained more inherent connections between the MXene layers, leading to an enhanced TC of 55.8 W/m.K In contrast, Chen et al. [49] used a delaminated Ti3C2Tx nano-flakes based film and the TC was only 2.84 W/m.K (290 K). Similarly, our study also synthesized delaminated MXene and thus, further enhancement of the TC can be achieved by synthesis of un-delaminated MXene. However, in real-time applications, owing to several needs on the physical properties, it is critical to provide a balance among the multi-layer and delamination structures, as MXene delaminated flakes could provide several benefits like higher specific surface areas and capacitance [50]. It is also noteworthy that the viscosity of the base oil plays a vital role in providing the optimum path for heat transfer by provide excellent stability to the additives even under high temperature conditions. In contrast, turpentine oil possess very low viscosity and it is difficult to provide stability for the nanoparticle dispersion in this conditions. Therefore, our MXene loading is limited to a maximum of 0.1 wt. % and further investigation is required to explore the effect of increasing mass fraction of MXene on thermal conductivity enhancement with use of a suitable surfactant which could provide long term stability to the MXene in turpentine oil without compromising the thermal properties.The thermal conductivity of MXene dispersed in turpentine oil solution is a very imperative factor which directly influences the heat transfer behavior of the solar absorber during the operational hours.

MXene possesses excellent solar-thermal absorption properties even at lower mass fraction, owing to its high surface area-to-volume ratio. With the incident solar radiation, simple harmonic oscillation of free electrons could be created by the plasmon, leading to exceptional light absorption. In previous work, it has been reported that even at 0.006 % MXene dispersion in base fluid, the transmittance of MXene based solution was close to 0 % under the full band with 97.66 % solar energy absorption [52]. It is worth understanding that with increased mass fraction of the MXenenanoflakes in the solution, the scattering effect of the upper-layer of the solution improved considerably. Meanwhile, as per the Mie theory [53], owing to the large size of 2-D materials, the scattering effect increased, leading to a reduced transmittance and excellent absorption.

        <p>Fig. 12 (A) presents the hourly variation in temperature difference between the water and glass for all three SS. It is well-known that the temperature difference between the water and glass plays a significant role in promoting higher heat transfer, leading to improved water yield. As can been seen in figure 12 (A), the temperature difference was low in the early experimental hours, owing to the gradual heating of water with respect to the solar radiation, and it attained a peak value at 1 PM. With the MXene coated absorber, there was a noteworthy rise in the water temperature, leading to an improved temperature difference between water and glass. The SS with the 0.1 wt. % MXene coated absorber exhibited a peak temperature difference of 11.8 °C (1 PM), whereas it was 11.5 °C and 11 °C respectively, for the SS with 0.05 wt. % MXene and the bare black paint coated SS. The average full-day temperature difference the water and glass was also higher (7.95 °C) for the SS with 0.1 wt. % MXene, as presented in Fig. 12 (A). This could be attributed to the improved heat supplied by the superior solar absorption of MXene along with the higher thermal conductivity and large 2-D flakes, which promoted improved heat transfer from the absorber to the water, which in turn provided a higher temperature difference between the water and glass.Fig. 12 (A) presents the hourly variation in temperature difference between the water and glass for all three SS.

        <p>It is also noteworthy that higher loading of MXene could adversely affect the durability of the coating owing to the non-uniform dispersion of the MXene in the paint solution, which could lead to peeling of the MXene coating from the absorber after repeated operations of the SS.

In addition, the MXene production is still limited to laboratory scale and it requires the state of the art facilities for its synthesis. Therefore, the cost of MXene could limit its application. Moreover, with increasing demand and application of this materials, its price could be drastically reduced similar to graphene based materials and with the exceptional thermal and physical properties of MXene, the proposed unit could be a game changer in the field of water purification. In the view of intermittent nature of solar driven desalination devices, usage of energy storage materials like phase change material in the form of paraffin wax with the doping of MXene could be solution to store the excessive available energy during the peak hours and then, use it during the off-peak hours to get the desired water temperature required for evaporation even during the low solar radiation intensity.
