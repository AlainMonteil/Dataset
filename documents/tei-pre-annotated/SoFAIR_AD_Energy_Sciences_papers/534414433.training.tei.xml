        <p>The polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell has reached its early stage of commercialization in vehicular, portable, and stationary applications due to its advantageous features such as low gas emission, quiet operation, fast load response, and high energy conversion efficiency [1][2][3]. Significant efforts have been devoted to developing PEM fuel cells with reduced cost, improved performance, and increased durability, which remain the three major technical challenges to its successful commercialization [4,5]. PEM fuel cells are extensively studied through experimental and modeling approaches. The experimental approach is costly, time-consuming, and skill-dependent. For instance, a target lifetime of 40,000 h [6] set by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for stationary fuel cells by 2020 requires around 4.6 years of non-stop operations, while for vehicles, the target lifetime of 25,000 h for buses requires over 3.4 years of testing by running the fuel cell buses (275 kW) 20 h every day with the fuel cost of USD $800,000 at the hydrogen price of USD $4/kg [7].The polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell has reached its early stage of commercialization in vehicular, portable, and stationary applications due to its advantageous features such as low gas emission, quiet operation, fast load response, and high energy conversion efficiency [1][2][3].

        <p>Numerical modeling has been demonstrated to be a useful alternative to experiments for the fuel cell studies in various ways, e.g., understanding physical phenomena that are difficult or expensive to be captured by experimental techniques [4,8] and providing the basis of the control and diagnosis strategies for PEM fuel cells [9,10]. The actual PEM fuel cell operation involves complex transport phenomena of neutral species (e.g., hydrogen, air, vapor and liquid water), charged species (e.g., electron and ion) and thermal energy within a multiscale region (e.g., flow channels with the dimensions from a few millimeters to tens of centimeters and porous media with length scales of nanometers and micrometers), which makes it challenging to accurately predict the output performance and precisely control the operation in a real-time environment. For a stable, efficient, and robust operation of PEM fuel cells, it is necessary to effectively control the reactant supply, water management, humidification, cooling and power electronic subsystems [9]. Many control strategies have been employed for PEM fuel cells, including proportional integral derivative (PID) control, adaptive control, and model predictive control [9,[11][12][13]. PID can be implemented by manipulating different operating conditions (e.g., stoichiometry ratio, pressure, and temperature) via classic feedback or feed forward control strategies. Although the implementation of PID is simple and cost effective, the slow, inaccurate, and offset issues as well as the non-linear and complicated fuel cell dynamics require more advanced control strategies to achieved optimal performance of fuel cells. Adaptive control can be implemented in a PID controller, which allows the systems to modify its operating conditions and maintain optimal performance with sensor signals. In the model predictive control, fuel cell models can be implemented to update the control action of various operational variables by comparing the actual and predicted output variables. The model predictive control is suitable to achieve optimal performance and to avoid harmful operating conditions [9]. An accurate and computationally efficient control-oriented model is the core of the real-time model-based control of fuel cell systems. Various empirical models, analytical models, and non-physics-based models are extensively studied in literature [14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31]; however, due to various simplifications, these models are challenged to estimate the fuel cell performance over the entire range of operation. To achieve high prediction accuracy for the entire operational range, a large database is needed for model validation, modification, and calibration. However, the PEM fuel cell performance may vary significantly depending on the design and manufacturing processes, and different fuel cell developers would obtain different performance data for the seemingly similar fuel cells they make and test, which are often kept confidential. As a result, there are no benchmark experimental data for PEM fuel cells available in the open literature. Therefore, the models developed in literature are typically compared with a particular set of experimental data with limited information available on how the data were measured for what details of the particular cell [14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31]. This state of the art in the field forced the present review to be focused on the models that are potentially useful for the control purpose at the qualitative rather than quantitative anchoring to any type of data or evidence.Numerical modeling has been demonstrated to be a useful alternative to experiments for the fuel cell studies in various ways, e.g., understanding physical phenomena that are difficult or expensive to be captured by experimental techniques [4,8] and providing the basis of the control and diagnosis strategies for PEM fuel cells [9,10].

        <p>The physical and electrochemical phenomena within the PEM fuel cell components are complicated with multi-facets. A typical PEM fuel cell consists of a membrane, two catalyst layers (CLs), two gas diffusion layers (GDLs, with each GDL composed of a microporous layer and a macro-porous substrate layer, e.g., carbon fibre paper or cloth), two flow channels, and two bipolar plates (a.k.a. flow field or distribution plates) [32], as presented in Fig. 1. The pressurized hydrogen fuel in manifolds is supplied to anode flow channels and arrived at the anode CLs through anode GDLs. In the anode CL, hydrogen gas is transported in void regions, diffused in ionomers, and finally adsorbed on the catalyst surface, where hydrogen is oxidized into protons and electrons. The protons pass through the membrane and arrive at the cathode CL. The electrons travel in the opposite direction through anode GDLs, anode distribution plates, external circuits, cathode distribution plates, and cathode GDLs, and finally arrive at the cathode CLs. In cathode CLs, the protons and electrons are combined with supplied oxygen gas (passing through void regions of flow channels and cathode electrodes as well as the ionomer film covered on the catalyst surface), simultaneously producing water and heat. The complex gas reactant transport, water and heat management, electrochemical reactions, as well as the transport of charged species are challenging for modeling over the entire fuel cell operational range.The physical and electrochemical phenomena within the PEM fuel cell components are complicated with multi-facets.

        <p>Significant efforts have been devoted to the development of physicsbased and non-physics-based (or data-driven) models aiming to accurately predict the fuel cell performance. These models can be classified based on spatial dimensions into three-dimensional (3D), pseudo-3D, two-dimensional (2D), pseudo-2D, one-dimensional (1D), and zerodimensional (0D) models. 3D and pseudo-3D models consider the fuel cells in all directions [8,[33][34][35], which requires fewer assumptions with high fidelity. However, the 3D and pseudo-3D models are computationally expensive depending on the meshes, accuracies and numbers of governing equations applied to the computational domain [8,[36][37][38]. To minimize the computing cost but maintain the ability to analyze the physical and electrochemical phenomena, 2D models are often applied by ignoring the transport phenomena in the direction along or transverse to the channel [39][40][41][42][43][44]. However, 2D models are theoretically less accurate than 3D models and not fast enough for real-time control purposes. Many studies further decouple one spatial dimension from the other to accelerate the computing speed, which is known as the pseudo-2D model [45,46]. By considering only the through-the-membrane direction, 1D models can further reduce the computational time for real-time control but retain the majority of the physics-based phenomena [10,14,[45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52][53][54][55][56]. 0D analytical or empirical correlation models can be used in model predictive control due to their fast computation speed. However, owing to the limited experimental data availability, these models are often validated under a narrow range of operational conditions; therefore, these models are questionable when utilized for the performance prediction over the entire operational range. To overcome this barrier, many advanced data-driven models including statistical and artificial-intelligent models [17,57,58] have been incorporated in the control-oriented model development. As a result, the simplified PEM fuel cell models, with reduced spatial dimensionality under various simplifications for real-time control purposes, have gained considerable research interest as the PEM fuel cell is being commercialized. It should be pointed out that the computational speed of a specific PEM fuel cell model can be further enhanced by many tools, such as reduced-order modeling, efficient numerical calculation, and code and algorithm optimization, which are excluded in this review due to limited information availability.Significant efforts have been devoted to the development of physicsbased and non-physics-based (or data-driven) models aiming to accurately predict the fuel cell performance.

        <p>The transport of liquid water is caused by the capillary pressure gradient in the porous media and the drag effect by the gas flow. The liquid water can originate from dissolved water in membrane and vapor in the gas mixture, as shown in Fig. 2. Dissolved water in membrane (or ionomer) can be generated by either reactions or absorption of liquid and vapor in pores [59,67,82]. When the content of dissolved water in membrane is greater than the equilibrium value, the excess membrane water is transferred to liquid or vapor [61,79]. When the vapor concentration is larger than the saturated concentration, the excess water vapor will be transferred to liquid or membrane water via phase change, and vice versa [83]. It should be pointed out that phase change pathways in fuel cell modeling can be inconsistent. For instance, the phase change between liquid and dissolved water is neglected with the assumption that the reaction product water is in the dissolved phase, excess dissolved water is transferred to vapor, and excess vapor is transferred to liquid in [8], while the phase change among dissolved, vapor and liquid water is assumed to occur simultaneously with different phase change rates in [79]. The impact of phase change pathways and rates on cell performance remains debated. In addition, although many fuel cell models assume the product water is dissolved in the membrane [8,34,59,64,67,79,82], the product water can also be in liquid and vapor phases. Wu et al. [84] compared the three water production mechanisms via 3D numerical models. The modeling results suggest that the water production mechanism has a significant impact on the non-equilibrium behaviors of fuel cells, while at equilibrium state, the water production mechanisms have a negligible effect on the final fuel cell performance [84].

The transport of water due to electrostatic force is also referred to as the electro-osmotic drag (EOD) effect, which is the phenomenon that a certain amount of dissolved water will accompany protons transported from anode to cathode [53,68]. The diffusion of dissolved water is driven by concentration gradients across the membrane, while the convective transport is mainly driven by the liquid-phase pressure gradient.

In anode CLs, electrons and protons are generated by hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) on the catalyst surfaces. In cathode CLs, electrons and protons are diminished owing to the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), where the charged species are combined with oxygen, generating water in the form of dissolved water in ionomer [34,91]. The transport of electrons in the conductive components of CLs, GDLs, bipolar plates, and external electric devices is dominated by Ohm's law of conduction, while the transport of protons only occurs in the ionomer phase of CLs and membrane [44,92,93]. Jiao and Li [61] performed a time constant analysis of various transient phenomena in PEM fuel cells, and the results indicate that the time constant for the migration of protons and electrons is only around 0.2 μs, which is much faster than gas transport (0.004 s), liquid water transport (0.04 s), membrane water transport (17 s), and heat transfer (0.004 s). This suggests that the electrons and protons can quickly achieve an equilibrium state, and thus the transient terms in the governing equations are often omitted [48,64,94,95].The transport of charged species, including electrons and protons in PEM fuel cells, is dominated by conduction via Ohm's law.

However, in a practical fuel cell, the actual operating voltage can be far below the reversible one, and the voltage losses rise as the operating current is increased due to four primary types of irreversible losses -the losses due to fuel crossover and internal currents as well as activation, ohmic, and concentration losses, as shown in Fig. 3. Fuel crossover and internal currents are caused by the unused fuels and electrons transported through the membrane as the diffusion of a small amount of the fuel and electrons is inevitable [1]. This diffusion process has a significant impact on the open-circuit voltage (OCV), which is smaller than the reversible voltage. However, this impact will be substantially reduced as the current is increased. Activation loss is resulted from the sluggish electrochemical reaction rate occurring on the electrode surface, and a small portion of energy has to be consumed to accelerate the electrochemical reactions. The activation loss can lead to a rapid voltage drop at the small current density region. Ohmic loss arises from electrical resistance in the fuel cells, including proton-and electron-conductive components [61]. The ohmic loss causes a linear drop of voltage at the intermediate current density region. The ohmic loss is affected by many factors, including membrane materials, hydration conditions, design of the electrodes, and interfacial conditions. Concentration loss is important in high current density region as a result of the mass transport resistance from external supply to reaction sites.

        <p>Fuller and Newman [39] developed a pseudo-2D model for the membrane and electrode assembly (MEA) with a co-current flow of air and reformed methanol streams (cathode mixture of water vapor, nitrogen, and oxygen, and anode mixture of vapor, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen). The transport phenomena were solved in the direction of across the cell, and the mass balance was solved in the flow channels. Both isothermal and non-isothermal cases were examined, and the results indicated that the water and thermal management are interrelated and heat removal strongly affects the cell operation. Nguyen and White [40] developed a steady-state pseudo-2D fuel cell model, accounting for the physics across the membrane and along the flow channels. The liquid water was assumed to present as tiny droplets with negligible volume. The voltage drop along the channels was neglected with the high electronic conductivity of current collectors, and the pressure gradient was set zero along the channels. Various humidification strategies were examined, and the results suggested the air should be humidified when used as cathode streams and anode humidification can be employed to compromise the inadequate back diffusion of water in membrane.Fuller and Newman [39] developed a pseudo-2D model for the membrane and electrode assembly (MEA) with a co-current flow of air and reformed methanol streams (cathode mixture of water vapor, nitrogen, and oxygen, and anode mixture of vapor, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen).

        <p>Goshtasbi et al. [45] developed a semi-empirical, transient, and pseudo-2D fuel cell model with the cell voltages as inputs and current densities as outputs under various operational conditions taking thermal energy and two-phase transport phenomena into account. A reduced model was applied to the membrane with the assumption that the water content in a thin membrane is almost linear, which reduces the partial differential equation (PDE) of membrane water transport to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) as shown below, water flow rates across the membrane on the cathode and anode sides, respectively. The numerical implementation can affect computational speed, and the pseudo-2D framework is presented in Fig. 5a. The framework consists of 25 nodes along the channel and 43 nodes in the through-the-membrane direction. A weak spatial connection was established through boundary conditions accounting for the reactant and water transport in the through-the-membrane direction and the bulk flow in the along-the-channel direction. This approach enabled different numerical schemes for different problems, e.g., the backward Euler method (fully implicit) for temperature PDE and the BEAM and Warming implicit method for liquid water PDE. The implicit methods enabled a larger time step in comparison with explicit methods to avoid numerical stability issues and to reduce the computational time in comparison with the real-time operation. The differential algebraic equation (DAE) system was solved by Newton's method. More details about the numerical solution methods can be found in Fig. 5b. In addition, this approach enabled parallel computing, which can further improve computing speed. Besides, the gas dynamics which are on the order of 0.01 s were ignored, and 0.1 s is selected as the time step for a balanced accuracy and computing speed. Therefore, this model enabled the computational speed twice to four times faster than real-time cell operation. Further, a bi-domain approach was applied to their model to distinguish the transport phenomena under the land and the channel [46]. The pseudo-2D model has been demonstrated for the first time to be a powerful tool for real-time control applications that incorporate as many physical and electrochemical phenomena as possible [45,46,126]. Yang et al. [91] established a comprehensive system model by integrating a pseudo-2D dynamic two-phase stack model, a 1D dynamic humidifier model, a 1D hydrogen pump model, a radiator model, and an air compressor model. The system configuration is shown in Fig. 6. Explicit numerical schemes were applied to PDEs, and a time step of 10 -6 s was selected for the numerical solution as a compromise of prediction accuracy and computing speed.

        <p>Springer et al. [14] proposed a 1D mathematical model that is utilized to study the fuel cell performance accounting for the transport of gas species, water vapor, membrane water, and other effects. In their model, if the actual vapor partial pressure surpasses the saturated value, liquid water is considered in the continuity equation assuming the water exists in the form of uniformly dispersed droplets with zero volume in the computational domain such that it is deemed to have identical transport properties with water vapor. In addition, a classic correlation of the membrane water drag coefficient n drag = 2.5λ/22 was derived based on their experimental results. Bernardi and Verbrugge [49] established a 1D model to calculate the voltage losses due to anodic and cathodic chemical reactions and the transport of protons and electrons. In their models, the CL was assumed macro-homogeneous and the membrane was fully hydrated. The transport of various species in the complicated structure of gas, liquid, and solid was modeled. Weisbrod et al. [50] enabled a detailed membrane model, in which the impact of water content on the physical and chemical properties of the membranes were mathematically described based on the experimental work by Springer et al. [14]. Baschuk and Li [51] modeled liquid water in CLs and GDLs, which enabled the simulation of water flooding in porous media of PEM fuel cells and evaluation of its effect on cell performance. The numerical implementation followed a procedure to consecutively solve the Nernst equation, mass transport equations, the Butler-Volmer equation (discretized by a quasi-linear approximation), and activation and ohmic overpotential equations. Wöhr et al. [52] developed a 1D mathematical model taking water and heat transport into account such that the dynamic responses of the PEM fuel cells after changes in electrical loads, gas flow rates, and humidification levels can be simulated.

        <p>Falcão et al. [53] established a steady-state 1D fuel cell model taking thermal and water management into account. The heat transport is assumed to be conduction-dominated in GDLs, and the heat generation and consumption were modeled for CLs. The transport of water in membranes was treated as a combination of diffusion and electro-osmotic drag effects. Gao et al. [55] developed a multi-physics 1D fuel cell model for real-time simulation. In their model, the electrical, fluidic, and thermal domains were taken into account for each component, including membranes, CLs, GDLs, flow channels, bipolar plates, and cooling plates. However, the activation overpotential of cathode was calculated based on empirical correlations, which requires a stack polarization curve to determine the corresponding empirical coefficients. The reduced spatial dimensionality enabled the a fast computation speed (33% faster than the real time) while maintaining reasonable prediction of cell performance in respect of current density, RH, and gas species concentrations including oxygen, hydrogen, and water vapor. Abdin et al. [56] built a 1D mathematical model that directly integrates physical parameters into their model under some assumptions to reduce the computational load. Their model was composed of four sub-models, i.e., anode, cathode, membrane, and voltage. In each sub-model, the simplified conservation laws were applied such that the model can reveal the physical response corresponding to changes in operational conditions. This model can be implemented in the 
            <rs type="software">Matlab-Simulink</rs> environment with simplifications and assumptions, such as uniform current distribution, uniform temperature, water in the vapor phase at the membrane-electrode interface, no pressure gradient, and diffusion dominant. The modeling results agreed with experimental data acceptably with fairly light computing demand.

        <p>The development of 1D numerical models has been promoted in the past three decades. A summary and comparison of these models are presented in Table 4. Most of these models utilize the RH, temperature, and pressure of the reactants, as well as the cell temperature, stoichiometry ratio (or flow rates), and current density as the input variables, and the output variables are focused on the cell voltage and other indicators such as outlet conditions and cell resistances. Li et al.

Further model development by incorporating the other aging effects including mechanical, thermal, chemical, and electrochemical degradations into the control-oriented models would enable the long-term performance prediction and control strategy adjustment. It should be pointed out that the computational speed of the control-oriented 1D model is dependent on the complexity of the transport and electrochemical phenomena being modeled. In other words, the computational speed can be enhanced by applying reasonable assumptions to simplify the governing equations. However, sufficient prediction accuracy should be maintained. The phenomena, including activation loss, ohmic loss, concentration loss, multispecies transport, membrane water, two-phase flow, electron transport, proton transport, non-isothermal effect, convection, diffusion, steady-state behavior, transient behavior, and aging effects, have been integrated or partially integrated into the 1D models in various studies such that the models are able to predict the short-and long-term performance accurately within the entire operational ranges. Further studies should also focus on the validation and calibration of the models against more physical variables other than just current-voltage curves, such as outlet conditions (including pressure, gas species concentrations, compositions, and flow rates), ohmic resistance, and temperature variations.The development of 1D numerical models has been promoted in the past three decades.

        <p>Many 0D analytical models have been utilized to develop control strategies; however, most of the models are over-simplified, and the validity requires further investigation [127][128][129][130][131]. Tirnovan and Giurgea [127] developed a control strategy to optimize the compressor speed and throttle opening of the air supply system to achieve the maximum energy efficiency of the fuel cell systems. The fuel cell model used to develop the control strategy consists of an empirical electrochemical model, a pressure drop model in pipes and channels based on flow rate and geometric parameters, and the energy balance of the fuel cell systems. The semi-empirical nature of the fuel cell models may introduce errors to the overall system model, which can be further improved. Matraji et al. [130] developed a control strategy to prevent permanent damage of fuel cells by regulating the anode and cathode pressures based on a nonlinear dynamic fuel cell model. The dynamic model was established based on the assumption that temperature and humidity were strictly controlled, and the pressure of various species was calculated based on mass conservation and ideal gas law. A MIMO controller based on second-order sliding mode and a 'twisting algorithm' is used to minimize the difference in anode and cathode pressures. However, the accuracy of the dynamic model was not evaluated, and its impact on the control performance remains unknown. Danzer et al. [131] developed a model predictive control strategy to avoid oxygen starvation, which is harmful to the fuel cell health, by controlling the pressure, current, and excess ratio of oxygen (i.e., stoichiometry ratio). A nonlinear fuel cell system model to estimate the dynamic responses of mass flow and pressure variation was established based on the flow resistance network. As the presented work was focused on testing the optimal control scheme, the fuel cell model was not validated, which may limit its practical application. Hong et al. [128] developed a multi-input multi-objective (MIMO) nonlinear strategy for fuel supply to the PEM fuel cells with anode recirculation and exhaust bleeding (see Fig. 8). The pressure dynamics of hydrogen and nitrogen in the anode was modeled based on mass conservation and ideal gas law, and the crossover of nitrogen and hydrogen was incorporated in the model. The emphasis of the presented work was placed on the controller performance, while the dynamic physical model was not validated.Many 0D analytical models have been utilized to develop control strategies; however, most of the models are over-simplified, and the validity requires further investigation [127][128][129][130][131]. Tirnovan and Giurgea [127] developed a control strategy to optimize the compressor speed and throttle opening of the air supply system to achieve the maximum energy efficiency of the fuel cell systems.

Therefore, a comprehensive yet simple 0D analytical model, including energy analysis, is scrutinized. Cownden et al. [21] established a 0D analysis model by incorporating the second law of thermodynamics for the PEM fuel cell systems into a single cell model to investigate the performance of the fuel cell transportation system, which was composed of the stack, hydrogen supply, air compression, and coolant subsystems. It was found that the cell stack possesses the largest exergy destruction within the system, followed by the hydrogen ejector, air compressor, and radiator. Even though the details of the fuel cell model were not given, the thermodynamics analysis presented remains useful for the fuel cell system optimization using energy efficiency as the control objective. Kazim [22] also performed a 0D exergy analysis for a 10 kW PEM fuel cell at various operational conditions, including pressure, air stoichiometry, temperature, and cell voltage. Exegetic efficiency, which is defined as the ratio of the output power to the overall exergy differences between the reactants and reaction products, of the PEM fuel cell system at various operational conditions was reported in their work; however, the exergy in individual cell components or auxiliaries were not considered. Hussain et al. [15] proposed a 0D thermodynamic model of PEM fuel cell systems, integrating a fuel cell stack, an air compressor, a heat exchanger, two humidifiers, and a cooling pump and loop, as shown in Fig. 9. A parametric study was conducted to investigate the impact of operational conditions, including pressure, temperature, and stoichiometry ratio, on the energy and exergy efficiencies of the fuel cell systems, and the largest irreversibility was found to be from the stack which has drawn the greatest attention in research activities. Youssef et al. [23] established a lumped fuel cell model with linear algebra equations, which is employed to evaluate the effect of operational and design parameters on the overall cell performance. Their model considered the mass conservation and energy balance, which does not necessarily require spatial dimensions, while thicknesses of GDLs and membranes were only considered for the calculation of ionic and electrode resistances. Many assumptions, such as constant membrane ionic conductivity and absence of phase change mechanisms, made this model less accurate to predict the cell performance over the entire range of operating conditions in comparison with those taking the dynamic membrane resistance and phase change into account. Karimi et al. [26] developed a flow network model to investigate the distributions of pressure and flow rate for reactant streams. These distributions were subsequently incorporated into the single cell, which enabled the evaluation of the fuel cell performance at the stack level. Miotti et al.

Shan and Choe [132] established a PEM fuel cell model considering the effects of (i) temperature gradients within the whole fuel cell, (ii) water redistribution in the membrane, (iii) proton redistribution in cathode CLs, and (iv) reactant redistribution in cathode GDLs.

The primary contribution to the resistance is the ohmic resistance of the membranes, followed by the charge-transfer resistance of HOR, the electronic resistance of the single cell testing facility, and the mass transport resistance in the intermediate current density region [24]. However, this equation overestimates the cell voltage at high current density regions, which is dominated by the mass transport limitation, as presented in Fig. 12.

        <p>As the experimental techniques are developed in the past several decades, a large amount of transient and steady-state experimental data have been accumulated, which allows the application of data-driven models to predict the fuel cell performances for control and diagnosis purposes [98]. The data-driven fuel cell models are classified as the models that directly learn from a large experimental data set without explicit knowledge of the physical PEM fuel cell systems. The data-driven (or non-physics-based) models can be generally classified into three categories for diagnosis purposes as shown in Fig. 14 -artificial intelligence (AI) models, statistical models, and signal-processing models. In this section, the emphasis is placed on the various artificial intelligence algorithms that can be implemented for fuel cell control applications as the application of the other two types of models in fuel cells is limited.

Based on the topology, the connections of neurons can be feedforward (see Fig. 15a) and feedback (or recurrent) (see Fig. 15b). Feedforward networks do not contain cycles in the connections of neurons, while feedback (or recurrent) connection includes cycles between neurons. The numbers of layers and neurons are dependent on the complexity of the problem being solved and determine the ANN prediction performance, which is often determined by trial and error during learning/training processes [143].

This enabled the prediction of stack voltage at the current state when the operation time was sufficiently long with a large dataset for training and testing. Their modeling results indicated that the learning rate (i.e., percentage of data used for training) had a significant impact on the modeling accuracy, as shown in Fig. 21. An obvious bias of voltage prediction was found after around 1600 h of operation when only 33% of the entire data were used for training (see Fig. 21a). When the training rate was increased to 60%, the predicted stack voltages agreed well with the experimental data after around 3200 h of operation (see Fig. 21b).

        <p>Comparison of zero-dimensional data-driven models for the control of PEM fuel cells. Note: √, ×, anddenote the features are included, excluded, and not mentioned in the corresponding studies, respectively.Model Accuracy and Computing Speed Most of the physics-based models evaluate the accuracy by comparing the I-V curve (polarization curve), which is known as the validation of models. For instance, Shamardina et al. [123] validated their pseudo-2D model by an experimentally measured polarization curve, while Yang et al. [91,125] validated their pseudo-2D transient model against two steady-state polarization curves under different stoichiometry ratios from published experimental data. The steady-state I-V curves are also commonly used for the validation of 1D models [10,51,53,54,56,103] and 0D analytical models [23,28]. Some other variables are also used for model validation, including transient voltage [47,48,91], coolant temperature [91], and resistance [14]. Although most physical models claimed that their modeling results agree well with experimental data, their models are only validated against one or a few polarization curves, which is often valid in a narrow range of fuel cell operational conditions. Moreover, most studies only present a comparison of modeling results with experimental data, while statistical indicators were rarely reported in the literature to quantify the errors in modeling work. The computing speed of a steady-state model can be evaluated by the computing time required to calculate a single case, while for a transient model, the computing speed can be quantified in comparison with the real operation time. For instance, Shamardina et al. [123]'s steady-state model requires a few seconds of computing time for a single case based on a personal computer, while Goshtasbi et al. [45,126]'s transient pseudo-2D model takes 611 s to calculate a physical operation of fuel cell for 1200 s, which means the computing speed is two times faster than real-world applications. The computational time also depends on the fuel cell controller used for the control, while the actual physical time for a particular fuel cell set depends on the fuel cell design, structure and operation condition. However, the details of electronic control units and fuel cells are often kept confidential by the fuel cell developer.Comparison of zero-dimensional data-driven models for the control of PEM fuel cells.

For instance, Shamardina et al. [123]'s steady-state model requires a few seconds of computing time for a single case based on a personal computer, while Goshtasbi et al. [45,126]'s transient pseudo-2D model takes 611 s to calculate a physical operation of fuel cell for 1200 s, which means the computing speed is two times faster than real-world applications. The computational time also depends on the fuel cell controller used for the control, while the actual physical time for a particular fuel cell set depends on the fuel cell design, structure and operation condition. However, the details of electronic control units and fuel cells are often kept confidential by the fuel cell developer.</p>
        <p>0D empirical models rely on a relatively larger experimental dataset to determine empirical coefficients in various models, and the prediction performance is usually good within the narrow range of data used for curve fitting [16,[18][19][20]24,25]. Although most studies on 0D empirical models did not report the calculation speed, the computing speed is generally believed to be much faster than pseudo-2D numerical, 1D numerical, and 0D analytical models as most 0D empirical models only involve one or a few algebraic equations and do not resolve spatially dependent variables [45]. However, the simplistic nature of 0D empirical models makes them less trustworthy to predict the performance beyond the data range used for coefficient determination, and it is almost impossible to calculate other performance indicators other than voltage by 0D empirical models.0D empirical models rely on a relatively larger experimental dataset to determine empirical coefficients in various models, and the prediction performance is usually good within the narrow range of data used for curve fitting [16,[18][19][20]24,25].

The prediction performance is shown in Fig. 26. The R 2 value in the training and testing datasets is 0.9996 and 0.9908, respectively, which are sufficiently high for most applications. The maximum percentage error is reported to be 7.7% in the test dataset and 3.6% in the training set. Therefore, the data-driven model demonstrates comparable accuracy with the physical model. Wang et al. [171] further built a two-hidden-layer ANN model and an SVM model to test a larger dataset generated by 3D models (5250 data points for training and 1750 data points for testing). The prediction results are evaluated by RMES and relative RMES, and both ANN and SVM demonstrate similar accuracy in comparison with 3D physical models.

        <p>A typical PEM fuel cell stack, as a promising alternative power source, consists of hundreds of single cells, and the performance of a particular fuel cell system is determined by many operating variables, including but not limited to reactant composition, temperature, pressure, relative humidity, flow rate, and cooling conditions.

        <p>a Model accuracy For physics-based models, the accuracy depends on the details of multi-dimensional transport and electrochemical phenomena included in the model, such as two-phase flow, temperature variation, ice formation, and aging effect. Due to the limitation of computing resources for the currently available electronic control unit (ECU) (see Table 9), significant simplifications have to be made to reduce the dimension of the physical problems and the complexity of the corresponding governing equations based on reasonable assumptions. It is expected that 3D and 2D models are generally able to predict with higher fidelity than 1D and 0D models since they are more realistic and can capture more details of the transport and electrochemical phenomena in the fuel cells. Model accuracy is also affected by various transport coefficients and properties in different fuel cell components, including membrane, catalyst layers, gas diffusion layers, flow channels, and distribution plates. These coefficients and properties significantly vary in different numerical studies, and further experimental efforts are required to eliminate this discrepancy. Furthermore, model accuracy can be improved by incorporating multiple aging effects, including mechanical, thermal, and electrochemical degradations, to predict performance degradation in a long-term manner.a Model accuracy For physics-based models, the accuracy depends on the details of multi-dimensional transport and electrochemical phenomena included in the model, such as two-phase flow, temperature variation, ice formation, and aging effect.

        <p>For data-driven models, the accuracy depends on not only the training algorithm and model architecture but also the volume and quality of the training data. Once the model is well-trained, the prediction of cell performance is expected to be accurate within the range of training data. However, uncertainty remains when the fuel cell is operated under extreme conditions, such as cold start, degraded components, or unexpected scenarios that are not covered in the training data. Further efforts can be made to optimize data selection and preprocessing to avoid over-training or abnormal prediction. For physics-based models, computing speed depends on the number of physical phenomena included and the accuracy required, which is inadequately investigated in literature. More incorporated phenomena and higher required accuracy mean longer computing time. Based on the available ECU, 3D and 2D models are computationally expensive for implementation, while 1D and 0D models have demonstrated the capability of direct implementation for control purposes. As can be seen in Table 9, the computing time required for 3D and 2D models varies from tens of minutes to a few months, while the pseudo-2D and 1D models are reported to be 33-50% faster than the real-time fuel cell dynamics. Technical pathways to enhance computational speed include reducing dimensionality, simplifying model formulation, ignoring nondominant phenomena, and improving computing algorithms and resources.

        <p>Comparison of multi-dimensional PEM fuel cell performance models. • Uncertain accuracy when operating fuel cell in extreme conditions that are not trained [177][178][179]. This type of degradation can be modeled through the changes in dimensions (e.g., thickness) and structure-determined parameters (e.g., porosity, effective ohmic resistance, effective diffusion coefficient, and capillary pressure) of the cell components [180], which can significantly affect the activation, ohmic, and concentration losses after a long-term operation [181]. Shen [180] developed a predictive 3D model incorporating the above aging mechanisms to evaluate the long-term performance degradation due to the cycling of assembly force, thermal, and humidity changes. The major chemical and electrochemical degradations occur because of the component corrosion caused by chemical and electrochemical reactions. The corrosion of ionomer and catalyst can be resulted from the attack of radical species (e.g., peroxide (HO*) and hydro peroxide (HOO*)) resulted from anodic and cathodic chemical reactions [182,183]. The membrane thinning, which can cause a significant performance drop, can be caused by the contamination of trace metal ions (e.g., Cu 2+ and Fe 2+ ) due to the corrosion of metal distribution plates or endplates [120,184]. The catalyst can lose activities due to the poisoning by the impurities in reactant gas [185,186] and the reduced electrochemical surface area (ECSA) resulted from the catalyst sintering, agglomeration, dissolution, detachment, and other degradation modes [187][188][189][190]. This type of degradation can be modeled via the changes in ohmic resistance and ECSA [38,47,191].
