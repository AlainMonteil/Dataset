        <p>Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising approach for renewable solar light conversion. However, surface Fermi level pinning (FLP), caused by surface trap states, severely restricts the PEC activities. Theoretical calculations indicate subsurface oxygen vacancy (sub-O v ) could release the FLP and retain the active structure. A series of metal oxide semiconductors with sub-O v were prepared through precisely regulated spin-coating and calcination. Etching X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and electron energy loss spectra (EELS) demonstrated O v located at sub ~2-5 nm region. Mott-Schottky and open circuit photovoltage results confirmed the surface trap states elimination and Fermi level de-pinning. Thus, superior PEC performances of 5.1, 3.4, and 2.1 mA cm À 2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE were achieved on BiVO 4 , Bi 2 O 3 , TiO 2 with outstanding stability for 72 h, outperforming most reported works under the identical conditions.</p>
        <p>The environmental-friendly photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting opens up a new avenue for the conversion of renewable solar light into green hydrogen energy. [1] Oxide semiconductors, acting as the most promising photoanodes, have attracted considerable attention as their advantages of facile preparation, abundant resources, and excellent photochemical stability. [2] In PEC system, the Fermi level (E F ) of photoanode needs to equilibrate with the redox potential (E redox ) of the electrolyte (Figure S1). However, abundant intrinsic surface trap states cause significant potential drop within the Helmholtz layer, resulting the so-called "Fermi level pinning (FLP)" effect (Figure 1) and reduced open circuit photovoltage (V ph ) driving force for PEC water oxidation under illumination. [3] Tremendous strategies have been developed to overcome the FLP effect. For instance, oxygen or ultravioletozone treatment can effectively eliminate the oxygen vacancy (O v ) trap states. [4] While, the positive roles of charge separation and catalytic sites on these surface states would also be destroyed. [5] Heteroatoms doping could adjust the work function of semiconductor to release FLP effect, yet the accompanied lattice damage limits its further application. [6] Recently, ultrathin amorphous layer (Al 2 O 3 , TiO 2 , and ZnO etc.) was used to passivate the surface trap states. [7] The suppressed FLP effect could greatly reduce the overpotential required to photooxidize water, but most of them rely on expensive and time-consuming atomic layer deposition routes. [8] As an alternative approach, constructing subsurface oxygen vacancy (sub-O v ) located at ~2-10 nm region below the outermost layer is proved favorable for increasing carrier concentration and exposing catalytic sites. [9] Meanwhile, the ordered outmost surface atomic arrangement displays the potential as the self-passivation layer to simultaneously eliminate the surface trap states and retain the active O v structures.</p>
        <p>Herein, we developed a universal sub-O v strategy to alleviate the severe surface FLP for efficient water splitting. Through theoretical calculations and experimental results, O v at the sub ~2-5 nm region below the outermost layer could effectively remove the surface trap states to achieve Fermi level de-pinning, leading to increased V ph and boosted carrier transfer. Meanwhile, sub-O v effectively promotes catalytic kinetics. Consequently, outstanding activities of 5.1, 3.4, and 2.1 mA cm À 2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE for over 72 h are achieved on typical BiVO 4 , Bi 2 O 3 , and TiO 2 respectively in Na 2 SO 4 solution without scavengers, far exceeding most reported works. This sub-O v strategy identifies a new inspiration for activating and boosting the performance of metal oxide semiconductors in photoelectrochemistry.</p>
        <p>Bi 2 O 3 is utilized as the prototype for investigating sub-O v induced Fermi level de-pinning, due to its lower BiÀ O bond energy and well-dispersed valence bands by the hybridization of Bi 6 s and O 2p orbits. [10] Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were first conducted by using Bi 2a). [11] Through partial charge density distribution analysis, this localized state is contributed by the outermost surface Bi and O atoms (Figure 2d and Figure S3b), and the abundant surface trap states tend to pin the quasi-Fermi level of photo-generated holes, [12] leading to serious surface FLP within PEC water splitting process. The elimination of O v can completely passivate the surface trap states to suppress the FLP effect (Figure 2b, Figure 2e, and Figure S3a), since no impurity states emerge within the band gap. While, the negatively shifted E F away from CBM to valance band maximum (VBM) endows the transformation of the n-type IÀ Bi 2 O 3 to p-type semiconductor (PÀ Bi 2 O 3 ), significantly weakens the anodic current response. Interestingly, the SubÀ Bi 2 O 3 still remains typical n-type semiconductor property (Figure 2c). Although the introduction of O v at subsurface area creates mid-gap states close to the CBM and VBM, the charge densities of the emerged impurity states arise primarily from the subsurface atoms (Figure 2f and Figure S3c). On this condition, outermost surface atoms make little contribution to mid-gap states, which sharply alleviate surface trap states to de-pin Fermi level.</p>
        <p>From the crystal structure and partial charge density mapping results (Figures 2g-j), the presence of sub-O v brings slight distortion to neighboring atoms and leads to obvious electron localization. Specifically, the neighboring Bi and O atoms show considerable charge accumulation and more overlap areas of electron wavefunction, which is in favor of the charge separation to participate the water splitting process along the defective conducting channels (Figure 2j). [13] On the contrary, s-O v acts as the surface recombination center for quenching the photo-induced carriers (Figure 2g). These results reveal that sub-O v exhibits potential for Fermi level de-pinning with retaining active O v structures.</p>
        <p>Through facile sol-gel based spin coating method, Bi 2 O 3 samples were synthesized on WO 3 /FTO substrate (Figure 3a and Figures S4-6). [14] For the XRD patterns of the asprepared samples (Figure S7), the characteristic peak at 27.9°can be ascribed to the (201) plane of tetragonal Bi 2 O 3 (β-Bi 2 O 3 ). Raman spectra and electron spin resonance (ESR) were carried out to probe the oxygen defect structure. Clearly, the characteristic bands at around 600 cm À 1 of IÀ Bi 2 O 3 and SubÀ Bi 2 O 3 corresponded to the presence of O v (Figure S8). [15] Meanwhile, typical signals at g = 2.003 can be identified as the single electron trapped O v (Figure S9). [16] In contrast, no paramagnetic signal at g = 2.003 and Raman shift at 600 cm À 1 were observed on PÀ Bi 2 O 3 after the treatment in oxygen-rich environment, manifesting the complete elimination of single electron trapped O v structure.</p>
        <p>To verify the accurate constructing of sub-O v , geometric local fine structures of the samples were characterized using aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). In order to observe O v induced lattice distortion phenomena more intuitively, inverse fast fourier transform (IFFT) process of the samples are carried out (Figures S10-S12). [17] Obvious lattice disorder can be observed within surface region of IÀ Bi 2 O 3 , which can be ascribed to the inherent O v (Figure 3c and Figure S10). The interlayer spacing of 0.319 nm corresponds to the (201) diffraction plane of β-Bi 2 O 3 . In comparison, the O v is eliminated and the atomic arrangement becomes ordered in PÀ Bi 2 O 3 (Figure 3b and Fig- ure S11). The unique migration feature of oxygen vacancy from the top layer to the subsurface in a series of oxide semiconductors have been proved in the previous works. [18] Under appropriate annealing condition, the lattice oxygen in the subsurface region will migrate to the surface area, fill the intrinsic s-O v to form the sub-O v . For SubÀ Bi 2 O 3 sample under optimized annealing condition, lattice distortion with the included angles around 6°appears at the sub ~2-5 nm region below outermost layer (Figure 3d and Figure S12), which can be attributed to the presence of sub-O v . In the EELS O K-edge spectra, the intensity ratio of the pre-peak a to b (a/b) was used to evaluate the local oxygen content at different regions (Figure 3e, Figure S13, and Table S1). [19] Compared with outermost surface (0.915) and interior bulk (0.97) areas, the decrease of the a/b ratio (0.669) at sub ~2-5 nm reveals the presence of O v at subsurface region.</p>
        <p>For further validating the generation of sub-O v , argonion-cluster etching-XPS experiments were conducted, as the gas ion cluster beam with lower energy significantly suppress the surface structure damage. [20] The spectra were collected at each etching step length of 1 nm (total of 7 nm from outermost surface inward) (Figures 3f-i andFigures S14-15). Prior to etching (0 nm), compared with stoichiometric Bi 2 O 3 , the peak of lattice oxygen shifts positively from 529.9 eV to 530.2 eV in SubÀ Bi 2 O 3 . Meanwhile, the symmetric Bi 4 f peaks at 162.46 eV and 157.15 eV are assigned to unsaturated coordinated Bi δ + (0 &lt; δ &lt; 3) species, reveals the presence of O v in outer layer.</p>
        <p>With the increased etching depth to 2 nm, little difference can be observed on the intensity and binding energy of Bi δ + and lattice oxygen (Figures 3f-g). Meanwhile, the unobserved peak at approximately 531.1 eV (which belongs to surface chemisorbed oxygen species at O v sites) certifies the non-existence of O v in ordered outermost ~2 nm area. [21] Continuing etching inward from 3 to 6 nm, the signals of Bi δ + decrease gradually and finally disappear at the depth of 6 nm for SubÀ Bi 2 O 3 . Notably, the characteristic O v peak at 531.2 eV only emerge within 3-5 nm etching depth region (Figure 3g andi). On the contrary, the concentration profile of low valence Bi δ + species and O v show different variation laws as a function of etching depth in IÀ Bi 2 O 3 and PÀ Bi 2 O 3 counterparts, respectively (Figure 3h and i, see detailed discussion in Figures S14-S15). These results indicate that O v and the corresponding low valence Bi species only exist within the subsurface ~2-5 nm region, demonstrating the successful synthesis of SubÀ Bi 2 O 3 .</p>
        <p>Attributed to the construction of sub-O v , SubÀ Bi 2 O 3 exhibits a sharply lowered photoluminescence (PL) intensity, illustrating fastest intrinsic photo-carrier separation of subÀ Bi 2 O 3 (Figure 4a). The average carrier lifetime (τ average ) of SubÀ Bi 2 O 3 (29.04 ns) is about twice that of PÀ Bi 2 O 3 (13.47 ns) and IÀ Bi 2 O 3 (17.36 ns). The extended τ average can be put down to the passivated surface trap states through sub-O v construction, leading to reduced radiative recombination of the photo-generated carriers (Figure 4b).</p>
        <p>The dependence of the flat band potential (E fb ) on the solution pH value was then carried out (Figure 4c and Figures S16-S18) to demonstrate the Fermi level de-pinning by sub-O v . Ideally, the E fb value and pH value will change by À 59 mV pH À 1 for oxide semiconductors. [22] IÀ Bi 2 O 3 gives rise to the slope of À 47 mV pH À 1 , which can be ascribed to the surface FLP effect (Table S2). The reduced V ph and corresponding slower photovoltage decay further confirmed the photo-induced electrons are easily captured by the surface trap states (Figure 4d). It is worth note that SubÀ Bi 2 O 3 exhibits an identical slope of À 58.3 mV pH À 1 to that of PÀ Bi 2 O 3 , suggesting a near ideal Fermi level depinning through sub-O v construction (Figure 4c). [23] Since the depletion layer width of as-prepared samples are about 5 nm (see details in Table S3), sub-O v can directly regulate the band bending degree under illumination (Figure 1). A higher V ph value of 0.633 V is achieved on SubÀ Bi 2 O 3 , providing a more beneficial driving force for water oxidation since it determines the difference between hole quasi-Fermi level and the redox potential of electrolyte. [6] The rapid photovoltage decay implies the sub-O v could dramatically deactivate the surface trap and reduce the loss of holes via instant electron-hole recombination. [24] Besides, the significant decrease in the onset potential (E onset ) from 0.525 V (IÀ Bi 2 O 3 ) to 0.406 V (SubÀ Bi 2 O 3 ) is attributed to the larger V ph provided by the Fermi level de-pinning (Figure 4e).</p>
        <p>Photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) incisively illustrate the catalytic kinetics under illumination. Typical Nyquist plot of SubÀ Bi 2 O 3 at 1.23 V vs. RHE exhibits the smallest radius of the semicircle curve at lowfrequency region. By fitting the data with a typical two-RCunit equivalent circuit model, the trapping resistance (R ct, trap ) of SubÀ Bi 2 O 3 is much lower than those of IÀ Bi 2 O 3 and PÀ Bi 2 O 3 , suggesting the accelerated charge transfer at electrode/electrolyte interface (Figure 4f, Figures S19-S21, and Table S4). Meanwhile, the reduced surface trapping capacitance (C trap ) of SubÀ Bi 2 O 3 at the potential range from 0.7 V to 1.23 V vs. RHE can be ascribed to the sub-O v mediated surface trap states elimination (Figure S22). [25] The density of surface states (DOS) is further derived from C trap on the basis of the following relationship: DOS = C trap /q, where q is the elementary charge quantity (1.602 × 10 À 19 C). DOS is inversely proportional to the photocurrent density, suggesting the direct hole transfer route on series Bi 2 O 3 samples. [26] The reduced surface trap states of SubÀ Bi 2 O 3 within the applied potential range is benefit for surface Fermi level de-pinning and also accounts for larger V ph . In the Bode plots, the obvious peak with higher phase value at low frequency region (10-30 Hz) reveals the charge transfer at electrode/electrolyte interface is the step-limiting process for PEC water oxidation (Figure 4g). The lowest phase value of SubÀ Bi 2 O 3 represents the trapping charge deaccumulation at the interface, consistent with the Nyquist results. [27] The photo-generated electron lifetime at the applied bias of 1.23 V can be obtained from the Bode plot according to the formula: τ e = 1/(2πf min ), where τ e is the electron lifetime, f min is the frequency at the minimum. [28] The electron lifetime of SubÀ Bi 2 O 3 is calculated of ~11.8 ms (Table S5), much higher than those of IÀ Bi 2 O 3 (~6.9 ms) and PÀ Bi 2 O 3 (~5.9 ms). The prolonged electron lifetime of SubÀ Bi 2 O 3 derives from the sub-O v induced surface Fermi level de-pinning, thus promotes the photo-generated carrier transfer.</p>
        <p>To quantify the role of Fermi level de-pinning effect on carrier transfer, the charge transfer rates (K ct ) were calculated by the following equation: K ct = 1/(R ct,trap C trap ), where the R ct,trap is the trapping resistance and C trap is the trapping capacitance in the fitted equivalent circuit diagram, respectively (Figure 4h). The K ct of SubÀ Bi 2 O 3 reaches ~74.8 s À 1 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, ~4.5 and ~2.8 times larger than those of IÀ Bi 2 O 3 and PÀ Bi 2 O 3 . Based on the accelerated charge transfer, the charge separation and injection efficiencies of SubÀ Bi 2 O 3 achieve 52.3 % and 92 %, respectively (Figure 4i and Figures S23-S24). Thus, photo-generated carriers can be separated efficiently to participate the PEC water splitting process.</p>
        <p>PEC performance of the photoanodes are carried out in neutral Na 2 SO 4 solution without hole scavengers (Figure 5a). The Fermi level de-pinning of SubÀ Bi 2 O 3 brings expanded V ph and significant cathodic shift of E onset (Figure S25), resulting in enhanced PEC performance. Notably, the optimal SubÀ Bi 2 O 3 (3.4 mA cm À 2 ) delivers ~2.3 and ~2.6 times higher photocurrent density compared to those of IÀ Bi 2 O 3 (1.5 mA cm À 2 ) and PÀ Bi 2 O 3 (1.3 mA cm À 2 ) photoanodes, respectively. The applied bias photo-to-current efficiency (ABPE) represents the net effect of photoelectrode by subtracting the contribution of bias potential. [29] Meanwhile, ascribing to the Fermi level de-pinning induced promoted charge transfer, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) value of SubÀ Bi 2 O 3 sample reaches 50.3 % at the wavelength of 375 nm, which is 1.67 and 3.2 times than that of IÀ Bi 2 O 3 and PÀ Bi 2 O 3 (Figure S26).</p>
        <p>The long-term stability is then tested at 1.23 V vs. RHE under simulated sunlight. Clearly, the cliff-like photocurrent descent of IÀ Bi 2 O 3 under chopped light condition reveals a serious carrier recombination on the photoanode surface (Figure 5c), originating from the electron capture on the intrinsic surface trap states. The PEC performance of IÀ Bi 2 O 3 decreases within the first three hours, leading to a serious attenuation to 21.7 % after 72 h (Figure 5d). DFT calculations implies that the desorption of *OOH intermediate (*OOH!O 2 ) on IÀ Bi 2 O 3 is the ratelimiting step with a huge overpotential of 3.8 V (Figures S27-S29). This high affinity to the oxygen intermediate and low formation energy of s-O v lead to the instability of IÀ Bi 2 O 3 . SÀ O v which easily be healed during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process enables the rapid deterioration of the PEC performance over long-term operation condition (Figures S30-S31). [30] By constructing sub-O v , the Fermi level de-pinning induces efficient charge transfer, which contributes to the stable performance of SubÀ Bi 2 O 3 for over 72 h continued operation (remains 96.1 %). On one hand, the regular and ordered outermost atomic layer (~2 nm) with no O v acts as the self-protection layer. During the OER process, the rapid desorption of *OOH intermediate (free energy barrier of 0.3 eV for *OOH!O 2 ) benefits the formation of oxygen molecule and the preservation of active subsurface defective structure (Figure S27). The phase structure, morphology, and electronic structure remain intact (Figure S32), illustrative the stable characteristic of sub-O v under operating condition. On the other hand, the rate-determining step for OER is found as the third step (*O!*OOH) with a reduced overpotential of 1.88 V, which is 0.31 V and 1.92 V lower than those of PÀ Bi 2 O 3 (2.19 V) and IÀ Bi 2 O 3 (3.8 V), respectively. The retained active sub-O v structure reduces the free energy barrier of the rate-determining step, achieving robust PEC water splitting process.</p>
        <p>Consequently, the practical gas evolution of SubÀ Bi 2 O 3 shows a nearly 2 : 1 molar ration of H 2 and O 2 generation rate, ~63.4 and ~31.7 μmol cm À 2 h À 1 (Figure 5e and Figures S33-S34), which is 3 and 6 times larger than those of IÀ Bi 2 O 3 and PÀ Bi 2 O 3 photoanodes, respectively. The gas chromatography data of SubÀ Bi 2 O 3 aligns well with the theoretical yields, indicating nearly unity Faradaic efficiency.</p>
        <p>The sub-O v strategy is also available for other oxide semiconductors including typical BiVO 4 and TiO 2 . Through precisely regulated sol-gel based spin coating and calcina- tion, obvious lattice distortions are found at the sub ~2-5 nm region of SubÀ BiVO 4 and SubÀ TiO 2 photoanodes, ascribing to the presence of sub-O v (Figures S35-S36). Especially, the flat band potentials of SubÀ BiVO 4 and SubÀ TiO 2 photoanodes display a near ideal change by approximate À 59 mV/pH (Figures S37-S38), illustrative the Fermi level de-pinning by the universal sub-O v strategy. Thus, the obtained SubÀ BiVO 4 and SubÀ TiO 2 display the outstanding photocurrent densities of ~5.1 and ~2.1 mA cm À 2 at 1.23 V, which are ~2.7 and ~2.0 times of the pristine ones, respectively (Figures S39-S40 and Tables S6-S7). The optimal ABPE values are calculated of 0.85 % at 0.96 V on SubÀ BiVO 4 and 0.41 % at 0.97 V on Sub-TiO 2 (Figures S41-S42). In addition, long-term stabilities for over 72 h are achieved in the absence of scavengers and OER cocatalysts, prominent among most reported works (Figure 5f and Table S8). Results suggest that the proposed sub-O v strategy for Fermi level de-pinning is universal and has great potential for enhancing the performance of n-type oxide semiconductors.</p>
        <p>In summary, we demonstrated a general and highly effective Fermi level de-pinning strategy for robust PEC water splitting process. Through sub-O v constructing, the adverse FLP effect has been suppressed to notably boost the V ph and carrier transfer. Meanwhile, the retained active sub-O v structure effectively lowers the energy barrier of the ratedetermining step within OER process to improve the hysteretic water oxidation kinetics, achieving robust PEC activity in neutral electrolyte without co-catalysts and scavengers. Consequently, outstanding PEC performance on typical BiVO 4 (5.1 mA cm À 2 ), Bi 2 O 3 (3.4 mA cm À 2 ), and TiO 2 (2.1 mA cm À 2 ) oxide semiconductors are achieved at 1.23 V for over 72 h, which are ~2.7, ~2.3, ~2.0 times of the pristine ones, respectively. This generic strategy paves the way to activate oxide semiconductor catalysts and extend the use of sub-O v strategy in PEC water splitting.</p>
