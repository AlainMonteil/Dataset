        <p>A number of mixed metal hydroxide oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts i.e. Ni-Fe, Ni-Co, Ni-Cr, Ni-Mo, Ni-Fe-Co, Ni-Fe-Mo and Ni-Fe-Cr were prepared by cathodic electrodeposition and characterised by SEM, TEM, EDS, XPS and micro X-CT. The compositions of selected catalysts were optimised to give lower OER overpotentials in alkaline media. Further optimisation of Ni-Fe based ternary metal hydroxide catalysts such as Ni-Fe-Co and Ni-Fe-Mo was carried out, showing improved performance at high current densities up to 1 A cm -2 in 1 M NaOH, 333 K. The influence of electrodeposition parameters such as current density, pH, electrodeposition time and temperature on the electrocatalytic performance of ternary Ni-Fe-Co metal hydroxide was further investigated and optimised. The durability of the optimised catalyst was tested at a current density of 0.5 A cm -2 in an anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyser cell at 4 M NaOH, 333 K, demonstrating stable performance over 3.5 h.A number of mixed metal hydroxide oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts i.e. Ni-Fe, Ni-Co, Ni-Cr, Ni-Mo, Ni-Fe-Co, Ni-Fe-Mo and Ni-Fe-Cr were prepared by cathodic electrodeposition and characterised by SEM, TEM, EDS, XPS and micro X-CT.

        <p>Water electrolysis coupled with renewable energy sources is considered a zero-carbon pathway to the production of hydrogen, without the consumption of fossil fuels or CO2 emissions. Traditional alkaline electrolysis is a mature technology, producing hydrogen at low capital cost due to the use of non-precious metal catalysts but suffers with problems such as low current density, low gas purity and low system efficiency [1]. These shortcomings have led to the development of acidic proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysers.Water electrolysis coupled with renewable energy sources is considered a zero-carbon pathway to the production of hydrogen, without the consumption of fossil fuels or CO2 emissions.

        <p>However, although PEM cells demonstrate fast response, high gas purity and system efficiency [2], they offer expensive hydrogen due to heavy dependence on precious metal catalysts and costly proton exchange membranes and which limit the large-scale commercialisation of these systems [3].

        <p>Previous research work has indicated that the anodic oxygen evolution reaction is a key reaction in water electrolysis because the anode overpotential is always significantly larger than the cathode overpotential [5,6]. The mechanism of oxygen evolution comprises of several intermediate single electron states, due to its kinetically unfavourable transfer of four electrons for the production of one molecule of oxygen. This leads to a build-up of energy barriers and thus slow reaction kinetics, which is seen as the major source of energy loss. As such, the development of inexpensive and efficient OER catalysts is crucial to achieving higher cell efficiencies.Previous research work has indicated that the anodic oxygen evolution reaction is a key reaction in water electrolysis because the anode overpotential is always significantly larger than the cathode overpotential [5,6].

        <p>Numerous materials have been studied for their OER activity and great interest in metalbased electrocatalysts have been shown [7]. In the alkaline environment, first-row transition metal compounds demonstrate high catalyst activity for OER whilst remaining low in cost and corrosion resistant in highly alkaline environments [8,9]. For instance, Ni, Fe and Co based electrocatalysts have each displayed the ability of reducing OER overpotential [10][11][12]. Such transition metal oxides, hydroxides and oxyhydroxides have been thoroughly investigated and activities for these catalysts have been benchmarked [13,14] with the general trend in reactivity found to be Ni &gt; Co &gt; Fe [14][15][16][17]. These comparative studies propose nickel to be the most efficient catalyst for OER based on adsorption energies or bond strengths of the reaction intermediates [16,18]. As a result, studies have been carried out to further enhance the activity of these hydroxides or oxyhydroxides through the incorporation of other transition metals, which have been shown to have a significant effect on the electronic properties of Ni(OH)2 [19,20]. The fabrication and optimisation of mixed metal oxide and hydroxide catalysts are based on Brewer's theory that a stronger d-d-intermetallic bonding between the intermetallic phases results in a weaker intermediate adsorptive bond (e.g. M-OH, M-H) in the rate determining step [21]. This allows for more rapid dissociation, faster reaction rate and better intrinsic catalyst activity overall. Synergism in mixed hypo-hyper-d electronic oxide catalysts depend on the composition ratio and the effect of the interaction between the mixed metals produces an optimal composition for maximum activity [22].Numerous materials have been studied for their OER activity and great interest in metalbased electrocatalysts have been shown [7].

        <p>The introduction of 'impurities' into a Ni metal oxide can thereby encourage increases in conductivity, alter the intermediate bonding energy for better catalysis and potentially provide more favourable active sites for intermediates to bind to [23][24][25]. Further, the combination of multiple first-row transition metals provides the advantage of multiple oxidation states in the operating potential range. As investigated by Stahl et al. [26,27], catalysts containing Ni, Fe and a third metal show higher OER activity with good reproducibility compared to binary Ni-based oxides and studies on ternary Ni-Fe based electrocatalysts report stable OER performance required for alkaline electrolysis [28][29][30].The introduction of 'impurities' into a Ni metal oxide can thereby encourage increases in conductivity, alter the intermediate bonding energy for better catalysis and potentially provide more favourable active sites for intermediates to bind to [23][24][25].

        <p>The surface morphology and composition of the various samples was characterised with an SEM-EDS (FEI Quanta 650 FEG) operated at 5 kV accelerating voltage. The percentage composition of transition metals at the catalyst surface was determined with EDX, from samples deposited on carbon polymer plate (BMA5, Eisenhuth) with a working area of ≈0.126 cm 2 masked out with polypropylene (Avon) tape. Carbon polymer plate was used as an electrode substrate to allow the composition of the deposit to be determined without influence from the substrate. Samples were prepared on carbon polymer plate in the same manner for Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher, ESCALAB 250Xi) measurements carried out with a monochromatic Al Kα source over energy range of 0 to 1350 eV with pass energy of 30.0 eV, step size of 0.05 eV and X-ray spot size of 500 μm.

All current densities in this work are reported as a function of the electrode geometric area. The samples were tested in a standard three-electrode glass cell with an inbuilt water jacket and polymer lid. The temperature of the electrolyte was calibrated before each run with a water bath to 333 K. In both set-ups of catalyst deposition and OER performance testing, Pt mesh and Hg/ HgO in 1 M NaOH were used as a counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The working electrode was orientated upwards into the cell to facilitate the release of O2 bubbles and prevent the build-up of bubbles on the microelectrode surface. All experiments were carried out in static electrolyte and reported results were obtained after several scans when a stable response was reached.

        <p>The production of hydrogen during electrodeposition leads to the uneven morphology of the obtained deposits.

        <p>The effect of cathodic current density on deposit morphology was observed with SEM. The micrograph of the sample deposited at 0.1 A cm -2 (Fig. S6a) displays particles which are relatively uniform in size and approximately 20-40 μm in characteristic length. Increasing the deposition current density to 0.2 or 0.3 A cm -2 results in a faster nucleation rate due to the higher overpotential of the deposition reaction. At a higher current density of 0.5 A cm -2 (Fig. S6b), the rate of growth of the deposit becomes masstransfer controlled [71] resulting in larger clusters mixed with small particles of deposit, and the influence of other electrochemical reactions such as hydrogen evolution becomes more prominent. At higher current densities, the deposit particles are larger because of increasing nucleation rate and there are voids in the particles, which are created by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Based on the slow scan voltammogram results, a deposition current density of 0.3 A cm -2 gives the best OER catalytic activity for Ni-Fe-Co hydroxide catalyst (Fig. 8a). This reduction in OER overpotential at 0.3 A cm -2 is due to increased electrocatalytically active surface area from the mixture of large and small deposit particles and voids from hydrogen evolution.The effect of cathodic current density on deposit morphology was observed with SEM.

As the length of electrodeposition time increases, the clusters remain similar in size although some appeared more distorted due to the higher number of voids created by the consistent production of hydrogen bubbles over a prolonged period of time [74][75][76], which also contributed to the surface of the electrode being less well covered. A deposition time of 240 s was found to give the lowest overpotential value of 235 mV at 0.1 Acm -2 for the Ni-Fe-Co hydroxide catalyst (Fig. 8c).The effect of electrodeposition times between 60 s and 300 s was investigated.

        <p>Electrodeposition temperature: Distinct morphological changes are observed in the deposits as the electrodeposition temperature is increased. Initially increasing the temperature from 295 K to 308 K, causes the rate of deposition to speed up because of the quicker diffusion of ions and lower nucleation activation energy, resulting in larger deposits forming on the surface of the electrode. At ≥ 323 K, however, the effect of increasing electrodeposition temperature changes abruptly and the structures deposited are thinner, weaker and less compact. Finally, at 343 K, the deposits curl up to expose more uncovered electrode surface as seen in Fig. S6f. This can be partially attributed to the enhancement of the rate of hydrogen evolution at the electrode surface as well. Increasing the temperature also leads to observable chemical changes in the electrodeposition sulphate solution which could have had an effect on the electrodeposition reactions. For instance, at ≥ 308 K, insoluble reddish-brown Fe(OH)3 was observed to precipitate out of the Ni-Fe-Co sulphate solution after electrodeposition. Therefore, from Fig. 8d the OER overpotential is observed to increase with deposition temperature, with the catalyst prepared at 295 K displaying the lowest overpotential for OER.Electrodeposition temperature: Distinct morphological changes are observed in the deposits as the electrodeposition temperature is increased.

Lastly, a minor peak at 535.9 eV was observed in the O1s spectra after OER and assigned to gaseous phase H2O [80]. These observations are in good agreement with the other spectra.Correspondingly, the peak at 531.2 eV increases in signal area after OER which is attributed to the presence of the M-OH bond for CoOOH [63] and M-O bond for NiOOH [79], and a small peak at 529.8 eV in the O1s spectra after OER is assigned to the M-O bond in CoOOH [63].

        <p>The influence of electrodeposition parameters on the synthesis of ternary Ni-Fe-Co hydroxide catalyst films and their effect on the catalytic performance were investigated. It was found that the catalyst cathodically deposited at 0.3 A cm -2 for 240 s at 295 K in a pH 3.9 electrodeposition solution produced the most active catalyst with an overpotential value of 235 mV at 0.1 A cm -2 when tested in 1 M NaOH, 333 K. The catalytic activity of the optimised Ni-Fe-Co ternary hydroxide catalyst was proven to be better than Ni-Fe binary hydroxide and uncoated SS mesh when tested in an alkaline zero-gap electrolyser at 0.5 A cm -2 for 3.5 h giving a potential of 2.22 V.The influence of electrodeposition parameters on the synthesis of ternary Ni-Fe-Co hydroxide catalyst films and their effect on the catalytic performance were investigated.
