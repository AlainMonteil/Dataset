        <p>The increasing share of fluctuating and intermittent renewable energies in the energy sector demands the development of efficient and durable energy storage options. Water electrolysis (WE) is a relatively mature H 2 production technology, suitable to store excess renewable energy produced during off-peak energy demand periods, e.g. during the night or weekends. Among the WE technologies, polymer electrolyte water electrolysis (PEWE) is particularly attractive due to operational benefits, such as high current densities, relatively low energy demand and quick response to grid power fluctuations [1]. However, still efforts are required to understand and address some limitations associated with technological requirements and material properties. The polymer electrolyte membranes (PEM) allow significant permeability of gaseous products [2] that decreases the efficiency and raises safety issues [3] especially under imbalanced pressure operation [4]. The harsh oxidative and corrosive environment (high electrochemical potential and low pH) necessitates the use of noble metal based electrocatalysts and Ti current collectors and separator plates, contributing significantly to system's cost [5]. Therefore, enhanced durability is essential, as extended lifetime can compensate for the high investment cost. Understanding the degradation modes of the individual system components, their interplay and the association with specific operating conditions are crucial for enhancing the durability of the whole system.The increasing share of fluctuating and intermittent renewable energies in the energy sector demands the development of efficient and durable energy storage options.

        <p>Most of the knowledge on the degradation of the abundantly used perfluorosulfonic acid membranes comes from the research on PEM fuel cells [6]. Although the operating conditions are different, i.e. higher pressure [4], higher electrochemical potentials and liquid water presence [7] in PEWEs, similar degradation modes are thought to occur [8]. Mechanical degradation can arise from uneven stress and non-proper assembling, while thermal degradation may be induced by sudden temperature gradients [8]. Chemical degradation is assigned to crosspermeation and mixing of H 2 and O 2 that leads to H 2 O 2 formation through the 2e -oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the cathode [6]. H 2 O 2 , in the presence of impurity ions from the balance of plant, mostly stainless steel based H 2 O supply reservoirs, tubes, etc. [9], decomposes to reactive radicals that attack the PEM [10]. In addition, cations with lower mobility than H + can screen sulfonic acid groups and affect H + transport [11]. A similar type of degradation is thought to be applicable for the H + conducting ionomer [12], which binds the electrocatalyst, extends H + conduction in the catalyst layers and tunes the hydrophilic/ hydrophobic properties for efficient gas transport and H 2 O retention without blocking electron transport [13].Most of the knowledge on the degradation of the abundantly used perfluorosulfonic acid membranes comes from the research on PEM fuel cells [6].

        <p>The current collectors/porous transport layers and separator plates are prone to degradation too. To overcome H 2 embrittlement of the Ti separators in the cathode, expensive Au coatings are employed [14]. Ti offers the best compromise between conductivity, corrosion resistance and strength [15], but its surface passivates with a protective oxide layer [16], increasing the contact resistance with the anodic catalyst layer over time [9]. Pt coatings decrease the degradation rate by more than one order of magnitude [9], although they may suffer from exfoliation at high current densities (&gt;2 A/cm 2 ) [17].The current collectors/porous transport layers and separator plates are prone to degradation too.

        <p>Due to the high roughness factors of Pt/C catalysts, their high Pt loading and low intrinsic overpotential [18], Pt/C cathodes pose little stability concerns even at high current densities [17] and low loadings [19]. Nevertheless, ultra-low Pt loadings might create a risk on longterm stability [20]. However, the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is sluggish and high overpotentials (η ≈ 250-350 mV) are required to achieve acceptable reaction rates [21]. Ir oxides are the current state-of-the-art anodes, representing the best trade-off between activity and stability [22], which anti-correlate; stability increases from metallic to quasi-amorphous oxohydroxides to thermally prepared crystalline oxides, while activity decreases across this series [23]. Meanwhile the electrochemical potential [24] and the operation type [25,26] affect stability, with Ir dissolution being the primary cause of instability in aqueous acidic media [27]. The considerable dissolution rates reported with flowing electrolytes [27] have created concerns on the lifetime of Ir based anodes. Based on the stability numbers (moles of O 2 generated/moles of Ir dissolved) published in [28], a PEWE anode with 1 mg/cm 2 loading of hydrous IrO x nanoparticles would be completely dissolved in ca. 4-5 days when operated at 1 A/cm 2 (1 A/ mg), whereas the lifetime of rutile IrO 2 extends up to 1 year.Due to the high roughness factors of Pt/C catalysts, their high Pt loading and low intrinsic overpotential [18], Pt/C cathodes pose little stability concerns even at high current densities [17] and low loadings [19].

        <p>Operating PEWE cells show however long lifetimes [29,30]. Rutile IrO 2 catalysts with current loadings (&gt;1 mg/cm 2 ) are very stable, without any evidence of Ir dissolution under stationary operation [9,14]. The kinetic deactivation was attributed to contamination of the anodic active sites by Ti, either from the anodic porous transport layer or from TiO 2 being part of the catalyst. Ir dissolution detected with Ir black anodes [5] is considerable at low loadings (≤0.4 mg Ir/cm 2 ) [31]. Ir concentrated at the catalyst layer/PEM interface, but also deposited inside the PEM with a gradient along its thickness. The loss of Ir was exacerbated with small IrO x nanoparticles and ultra-low Ir loadings (0.08 mg Ir/cm 2 ) [20,32]. Even Ir migration and deposition in the cathode were observed [20].Operating PEWE cells show however long lifetimes [29,30].

        <p>Dynamic operation with rutile IrO 2 and high loadings mainly affected the cell resistance [14,33], depending on the maximum current density applied and the number of on/off cycles [14]. Slight Ir dissolution and precipitation inside the PEM in close proximity to the anode was detected after intermittent operation with high current densities, pressurized cathode and thin membrane [33]. It was attributed to the reduction of the IrO 2 surface by the permeated H 2 under open circuit and its re-oxidation/dissolution upon re-entering OER potentials. However, significant surface area losses were observed with low loaded IrO 2 anodes (0.1-0.32 mg/cm 2 ), subjected to solar type or stepped current density (0-2 A/cm 2 ) profiles at 60 and 80 • C, respectively [34]. A metallic Ir anode (0.1 mg/cm 2 ) showed 50% kinetic activity loss after 23.000 potential cycles between 1.45 and 2 V at 80 S1 in the Supplementary Material). Degradation typically enhances with current density (potential) and temperature [17,35]. Noble metal coatings decrease the resistive degradation strongly [14]. However, conflicting results are reported under intermittent and dynamic operation. Particularly, dynamic operation does not seem to be problematic with rutile type IrO 2 electrodes and current high loadings [14,17], but the stability of metallic Ir formulations with low loadings is questionable [26,31]. On the other hand, intermittency seems to be challenging for the cathode in the absence of protective inert gas purging [36], while open circuit potential (OCP) under enhanced H 2 permeation is not recommended even for rutile type anodes at elevated T (80 • C) [33].Dynamic operation with rutile IrO 2 and high loadings mainly affected the cell resistance [14,33], depending on the maximum current density applied and the number of on/off cycles [14].

        <p>In this work, the stability of an IrO x -based commercial membrane electrode assembly (MEA) is studied under dynamic conditions (1.4-1.8 V) for 830 h in a mid-sized (63.5 cm 2 ) all Ti electrolysis single cell at 60 • C and ambient pressure. In addition, short steady-state interims are conducted to explore the temporal responses and compare with those during dynamic operation. Electrochemical diagnostics are systematically employed to analyze the performance evolution with time and distinguish and quantify different degradation phenomena. Pristine and aged MEAs are subjected to in-depth microscopic analysis to understand the structural and chemical changes imposed by potential cycling and identify degradation routes. Commercial anodes with high hydrous IrOx catalyst loadings withstand highly dynamic operating conditions with acceptable kinetic induced degradation. However, potential excursions close to OER onset seem to affect the reaction selectivity inducing chemical degradation of the H + conducting network at and close to the anode/PEM interface.In this work, the stability of an IrO x -based commercial membrane electrode assembly (MEA) is studied under dynamic conditions (1.4-1.8 V) for 830 h in a mid-sized (63.5 cm 2 ) all Ti electrolysis single cell at 60 • C and ambient pressure.

        <p>High purity H 2 O (0.055 μS/cm) was re-circulated (50-130 ml/min, measured ex-situ volumetrically) between a heated container and the anode compartment, and served as reactant and heating/cooling medium (cell exposed to the environment). The temperature of the anode inlet H 2 O stream was controlled and those at the outlet and middle of the anode plate were recorded. The cathode was always flooded with dry H 2 or N 2 (150-250 ml/min), the former to maintain a well-defined cathode potential (close to 0 V vs. reference hydrogen electrode, RHE) during cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements, the latter to avoid mixing of H 2 with air back-diffusing from the cathode outlet during start-up/shutdown instances, as well as during low current density operation in the absence of backpressure.

        <p>The assembled cell underwent the cyclic electrochemical operation and diagnostic protocol depicted in Fig. 1. First, the MEA was subjected to a H 2 permeation test (HPT) at room temperature (RT), during which the initial integrity of the cell assemblage as well as the H 2 permeation properties of the PEM were assessed (details on the method in [37]). After a couple of polarization measurements at RT, the electrolyzer was heated up to 60 • C while simultaneously increasing OER polarization in current density steps, followed by initial diagnostics (Fig. 1b andS3). Two long-term dynamic and a few shorter stationary operating interims were applied during 830 h testing at 60 • C. The dynamic protocol consisted of potential sweeping (100 mV/s, 1.4-1.8 V) with respective holds with different dwell times: 1.5 and 2.5 min at 1.4 and 1.8 V, respectively, for 430 h (named as fast protocol and marked with F in Fig. 1a), and 15 min holds at each potential for 315 h (slow protocol, marked with S in Fig. 1a). Detailed potential profiles complemented with the respective current density and temperature responses are shown in Fig. S4. The dual dynamic protocol aimed to disentangle the effects of the number of potential cycles (6560 in fast vs. 630 cycles in slow protocol) and dwell time. Stationary overnight interims in galvanostatic and potentiostatic modes (only the former are shown) at ca. 1.6-1.62 V were explored at the initial testing stage (10.5-66.5 h, shaded areas marked with SS in Fig. 1a), as well as one potentiostatic interim at 1.8 V after dynamic operation, in order to capture the temporal behavior under steady-state. Their duration was short enough to not influence the overall degradation, but sufficient to get insights into the differences between dynamic and stationary operation.The assembled cell underwent the cyclic electrochemical operation and diagnostic protocol depicted in Fig. 1.

        <p>Due to the increase of H 2 O conductivity over time in the absence of an ion-exchanger (max. conductivity 5 μS/cm, measured ex-situ in the water drain by a SevenGo-pro conductivity meter, Mettler Toledo), the continuous operation was interrupted every 2-5 days in order to exchange H 2 O in the anode recirculation loop. During interruptions, the cell cooled down to RT. Before the H 2 O refreshing steps, the diagnostics listed in Fig. 1b were sequentially applied. Specifically, the cathode gas atmosphere was switched from N 2 to H 2 and EIS was performed at the upper potential of the applied protocol. After interrupting the protocol and a short period of OCP (≤15 s), three CV cycles were collected starting from the apparent OCP (=1.4 V) and sweeping to 0.5 V and backward. Stepwise galvanostatic polarization measurements in both anodic and cathodic directions were adopted as metric of the overall performance, along with EIS at selected current densities to provide for high frequency resistance (HFR) free potentials (E HFR free ). After three additional CV cycles, H 2 O exchange was performed with the cathode flushed with N 2 , followed by a H 2 permeation test at RT. 1.5 CV cycles were then measured at RT and the operating protocol was resumed after raising the temperature again to 60 • C and by stepwise increasing OER polarization. Note that the transient cooling/heating regimes lasted ca. 3 h. At selected intervals, marked with vertical dashed lines in Fig. 1a, CVs with different sweep rates (1-30 mV/s) were recorded to inspect the voltammetric charge dependence on the sweep rate in a fixed potential window (0.5-1.35 V) as metric of the catalyst active area [38].

        <p>CV was applied to inspect the anode catalyst fingerprint in the potential region preceding OER. The initial CV responses at RT, after subjecting the MEA to a HPT (black lines), and after a polarization measurement (red lines), are shown in Fig. 2a. The permeated H 2 slowly drives the OCP to low values (=0.03 V). In the CV after HPT, the potential was swept from OCP to 1.4 V and backward. The number of cycles was limited to 2.5 in order to prevent cathodic dissolution of Ir [24,25]. The negligible Faradaic processes below 0.4 V and the broad redox features at higher potentials (H + injection/ejection processes) are characteristic of hydrous Ir oxides [39]. The excess anodic charge in the first sweep can be related to sites interacted with molecular H 2 . Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) of X-ray amorphous Ir oxohydroxides including commercially available IrO x [40,41] showed consumption of H 2 already at RT. This is not accompanied by H 2 O release, suggesting that H 2 is not de-oxygenating the catalyst, but rather remains adsorbed at RT in form of hydroxyls and/or adsorbed H 2 O. The lack of excess anodic charge in the second sweep is due to the fact that in the first cathodic sweep (2.3 min duration) solely H + injection occurred. Reduction is hindered below 0.4 V as the oxohydroxide is largely switched off by the high resistivity at low potentials [42].CV was applied to inspect the anode catalyst fingerprint in the potential region preceding OER. The initial CV responses at RT, after subjecting the MEA to a HPT (black lines), and after a polarization measurement (red lines), are shown in Fig. 2a. The permeated H 2 slowly drives the OCP to low values (=0.03 V). In the CV after HPT, the potential was swept from OCP to 1.4 V and backward. The number of cycles was limited to 2.5 in order to prevent cathodic dissolution of Ir [24,25]. The negligible Faradaic processes below 0.4 V and the broad redox features at higher potentials (H + injection/ejection processes) are characteristic of hydrous Ir oxides [39]. The excess anodic charge in the first sweep can be related to sites interacted with molecular H 2 . Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) of X-ray amorphous Ir oxohydroxides including commercially available IrO x [40,41] showed consumption of H 2 already at RT. This is not accompanied by H 2 O release, suggesting that H 2 is not de-oxygenating the catalyst, but rather remains adsorbed at RT in form of hydroxyls and/or adsorbed H 2 O. The lack of excess anodic charge in the second sweep is due to the fact that in the first cathodic sweep (2.3 min duration) solely H + injection occurred. Reduction is hindered below 0.4 V as the oxohydroxide is largely switched off by the high resistivity at low potentials [42].</p>
        <p>The CV collected after the first polarization measurement is embedded in Fig. 2a (red line). In this case, the excess cathodic charge, appearing only in the first cathodic sweep, is due to the more oxidized, and thus more de-protonated, nature of the catalyst after OER. Two things should be mentioned in comparison to the CV after HPT; i) the reduction of the anodic charge in the second CV cycle after HPT (~35%) was similar to the reduction of the cathodic charge in the second cycle after OER (~31%), and ii) the higher cathodic charge in the second cycle after OER. The former suggests that the same type of catalytic sites is involved in the adsorption of molecular H 2 under open circuit conditions and the de-protonation (catalyst oxidation) during OER conditions. The latter indicates that the catalyst underwent specific changes during the first polarization measurement. In this regard, the transient cathodic charge was measured instantly after OER and regularly throughout the test duration to capture catalyst modifications.The CV collected after the first polarization measurement is embedded in Fig. 2a (red line).

        <p>The E HFR free values are plotted against the current density in log scale in Fig. 2b (right-y, top-x axes). Multiple Tafel slopes, i.e. continuous upward bending with increasing current density, were observed, with values ranging from 24 to 80 mV/dec. It should be noted that no further potential corrections were applied, e.g. to account for the H + transport resistance in the catalyst layers [44], the influence of gas pressure enhancement (supersaturation) in the catalyst layers on the Nernst potential [37,45], as well as for the influence of H 2 permeation on the current density [37]. The former two contributions increase the apparent slope at high current densities (&gt;0.05 A/cm 2 ) [37,45], whereas the latter phenomenon skews the slope at low current densities [37].

        <p>The constant E HFR free with decaying current density after 170 h dynamic operation implies that the apparent degradation has additional kinetic origin. The changes in the mass transport properties can be essentially excluded, as the Tafel slopes of the polarization measurements did not change over the test duration (Fig. S7). To elaborate on the origin of this type of degradation, the current density was normalized to the total voltammetric charge, Q t , the latter assessed by the charge dependence on the sweep rate (Figs. S8-11, Table S2 and discussion therein) [48]. The charge normalized activity (1.007 ± 0.007 s -1 ) at 1.8 V (E HFR free ≈ 1.535 V) is constant over time (Fig. 3b), which signifies that the observed mild current decay after the activity plateau can be attributed to the loss of the active anodic catalyst surface area. This also indicates that the mode of dynamic operation (fast or slow protocol) does not play a role for the slow deactivation.The constant E HFR free with decaying current density after 170 h dynamic operation implies that the apparent degradation has additional kinetic origin.

        <p>The fact that both as measured and HFR free potentials were constant with decaying current density does not necessarily mean that the resistive contributions were unaltered with time. In fact, the respective HFR values (Fig. 3c) show a mirror imaged profile to the current density; an initial decrease and concomitant increase in apparently linear fashion with a slope dHFR/dt = 43.5 (±2.5) μΩ.cm 2 /h. Hence, both HFR and kinetics contribute to the overall performance evolution over time, with the respective apparent degradation rates reported in Table 1. Considering the 80 mV/dec Tafel slope at high current density (Fig. 2b &amp;S7b) and the Q t evolution with time (Fig. S10), we can estimate (see details in the Supplemental Material) the kinetic potential loss (~2.6 μV/h), which is one order of magnitude lower than the degradation due to HFR, 32.6 μV/h (=43.5 μΩ.cm 2 /h•0.75 A/cm 2 ). The latter value is lower than values reported under stationary [9], dynamic [14] or accelerated [34] operating conditions at 80 can be possibly assigned to the lower temperature, E HFR free and current density in the present experiment. Furthermore, the rate of HFR increase is in relative agreement with the rate of increase of the cell hardware resistance (determined in the absence of MEA, 52.1 μΩ.cm 2 /h, Table 1 &amp; Fig. 3c). This suggests that the majority of performance losses comes from the increase of the contact resistance of the Ti based components over time, e.g. anodic catalyst layer/Ti-porous transport layer/Ti-grid/ Ti-plate, without excluding the cathodic Ti plate [9,17].The fact that both as measured and HFR free potentials were constant with decaying current density does not necessarily mean that the resistive contributions were unaltered with time.

        <p>To help understanding of the aforementioned phenomena, the first (solid lines) and second (dashed lines) cathodic sweeps after 18 h at 0.315 A/cm 2 (time: 48.5 h; final E HFR free = 1.51 V, final black points in Fig. 5a) and after CV and 7 min at the same current density (time 48.6 h; E HFR free = 1.497 V, second red points in Fig. 5a) are compared in Fig. 5b. A profound effect of time at OER potentials on the first cathodic sweep is observed, whereas the second sweeps are nearly identical. While the low potential cathodic charge, located over the broad peaks at ca. 0.75 and 1.1 V, is very similar, the high potential cathodic peak (at ca. 1.3 V) grows with time under steady-state OER. The OCP decreases with time at open circuit conditions between current interruption and CV (Fig. S12), consequently decreasing the charge of the high potential peak. However, the overall cathodic charge divided by the CV potential window (thus the pseudo-capacitance, Q/E = C) is essentially the same for open circuit dwell times up to 19 min at RT (Fig. S12). Therefore, the species oxidized during OER and involved in the H + injection at low potentials (roughly &lt; 1.2 V) show high retention time, likely including changes of the substrate (subsurface) in view of the 3D character of IrO x in OER electrocatalysis [50,51]. Note that the broadness and intensities of the peaks at 0.75 and 1.1 V are comparable. On the other hand, the high potential peak is significantly narrower, indicating more surface or close to surface character. We suggest that the high potential peak involves the reduction of either (i) long-living OER intermediates, likely preceding the rate determining step, being stable enough to be observed after 15 s at OCP, and/or (ii) OER side-products that inhibit the reaction kinetics. Their increasing population with time at steady-state is accompanied by HFR decrease and intensive deactivation (Fig. 5a), signifying the interrelation of these quantities.To help understanding of the aforementioned phenomena, the first (solid lines) and second (dashed lines) cathodic sweeps after 18 h at 0.315 A/cm 2 (time: 48.5 h; final E HFR free = 1.51 V, final black points in Fig. 5a) and after CV and 7 min at the same current density (time 48.6 h; E HFR free = 1.497 V, second red points in Fig. 5a) are compared in Fig. 5b.

        <p>The OER induced surface is protonated upon cathodic sweeping to low potentials, forming hydroxyls [52]. Such hydroxylation, for example of the oxo-bridging ligands, decreases the electronic coupling between the Ir centers [52] and can increase the electric resistance. Alternatively, the adsorbed oxygen containing intermediates or higher surface oxides [53] are reductively stripped by CV. The activity is then fully restored, due to the regeneration of Ir sites with lower valence [50,54], accompanied by HFR increase in apparently revertible manner (Fig. 5a). In contrast, the activity drops significantly slower during dynamic operation (Table 1). The transient cathodic current upon sweeping down to 1.4 V during dynamic operation (Figs.

        <p>Comparative analytical TEM characterization of the PEM after careful cross section preparation (microtomy) is used to obtain more information about the physical and chemical consequences of the applied electrochemical protocol on the ionomer and on the PEM. Spot EDX characterization on the ionomer after electrochemical testing shows that the ionomer contains traces of iridium material (Fig. 6a &amp;b). These traces are not evident in the fresh PEM sample (Fig. S25) indicating Ir dissolution and redeposition under (dynamic) operation. The comparison with the pure ionomer and PEM EDX spectra also suggests that these species are oxidized in nature. Furthermore, Ir containing agglomerates and particles are found within the first micrometers of the Nafion membrane adjacent to the anode (Fig. 6c &amp;d), similar to what is reported in literature [20,31]. These sulphur-containing Ir particles, with sulphur originating from the membrane, have negligible oxygen content and are present only in the used PEM. This indicates that the dissolved Ir ions diffuse to the membrane and get reduced by H 2 coming from the cathode. The position of the Ir agglomerates in the membrane close to the anode side indicates a H 2 -rich atmosphere (sizable permeation) inside the PEM [33]. These Ir particles are not only a confirmation of dissolution and loss of active material, but also they might cause increase of the proton resistance of the membrane by blocking some of the proton transport pathways, even presenting a potential long-term route of PEM failure by facilitating membrane degradation.

        <p>The pristine highly porous anode coating is largely heterogeneous on the meso-and nano-scale (Figs. S21b &amp;S23). This is beneficial for O 2 removal and catalyst utilization, the latter evidenced by the high Q t . Assuming that the charge generating Ir sites face complete transition between (III) and (IV) oxidation states [51] within the CV potential range (0.5-1.35 V) under slow sweeping, the initial Q t (0.7C/cm 2 ) corresponds to a loading of ca. 1.4 mg Ir/cm 2 , in reasonable agreement with the estimate from the anode thickness (1.1 -2.4 mg/cm 2 ). This indicates that the whole anode coating (even deeper part of the anode film) and even bulk sites of the amorphous IrO x catalyst seem to be accessible to protons [38] (Fig. S9). However, these benefits come at the expense of electron and potentially proton percolation across a thick catalyst layer at high CV sweep rates and high current densities during OER. These facts in conjunction with the high porosity of the Ti-porous transport layer and the limited contact with the catalyst layer (Fig. S16) give rise to high initial resistive losses (Fig. 2b &amp;3c).The pristine highly porous anode coating is largely heterogeneous on the meso-and nano-scale (Figs.

        <p>The high catalyst layer thickness (and loading) is advantageous for the stability (only 5% loss of total charge after 7190 potential cycles) by creating long transport pathways for the dissolved Ir species. Since the deposition of Ir seems to be favored at high potential (0.9 -1.4 V vs. NHE) and low pH [57], as evidenced by the atomically dispersed oxidized Ir on the ionomer inside the anode layer, we suspect that most of dissolved Ir is retained in the active reaction zone. Thus, Ir losses towards the Ti-porous transport layer are expected to be low, as the net flow of H 2 O is towards the cathode. Some of the dissolved Ir species however diffuse towards the PEM, where they reductively precipitate by the permeating H 2 [33] forming a band of Ir nanoparticles. Although the operating pressure was atmospheric, the Ir-band position indicates the high relative concentration of H 2 inside the PEM, exacerbated at low current densities [37].The high catalyst layer thickness (and loading) is advantageous for the stability (only 5% loss of total charge after 7190 potential cycles) by creating long transport pathways for the dissolved Ir species.

        <p>The active material lost compared to the anode thickness is small, because we do not observe any measurable thickness change (Fig. S18 &amp; Table S3). In this regard, we assume that the major contribution of the slow deactivation under dynamic operation is related to crystallization, which reduces the electrochemically accessible surface area, as the crystalline material is less active than the amorphous IrO x [56].The active material lost compared to the anode thickness is small, because we do not observe any measurable thickness change (Fig. S18 &amp; Table S3).

        <p>The steady-state deactivation is linked to a species responsible for the high potential cathodic peak (1.3 V). Its regeneration by cathodic reduction was partial during the dynamic operation and full after CV (Fig. S15). If these (electro-)catalytic redox processes not only involve H + intercalation, but also bond breaking, it is likely that the released oxygen-containing species will have (hydro-)peroxo-character, due to the high potential that prevents H 2 O formation (&gt;1.2 V), unless their concentration is high enough to drive the equilibrium potential of H 2 O 2 reduction to H 2 O to higher values [58].

        <p>• as OER by-products on Ir oxides in aqueous acidic electrolyte has been detected under potential sweeping conditions [59]. The latter species (hydroperoxyl radicals) can be further reduced to H 2 O 2 (1.44 V vs. NHE) or H 2 O and hydroxide radical (1.4 V vs. NHE) [60]. All of these species can contribute Nafion decomposition, possibly catalyzed by the dissolved/deposited Ir species. Note that F loss is specifically observed close to the anode/PEM interface and in presence of Ir (Fig. 6). Consequently, the proton resistance is expected to increase and may contribute to the observed HFR increase over time (Fig. 3c). This represents a potential long-term route of PEM failure. Also, the fluoride emission from the PEM should not be overlooked, as it can corrosively react with the Ti based cell components [61] and affect the contact resistance, as indicated by the post-test hardware resistance measurements (Fig. 3c). In these ways, the HFR increase observed herein and during intermittent operation of PEM water electrolyzers [14,17] can be realized. Apparently, a stable noble metal coating of the Ti-porous transport layer cannot be presently avoided in order to prevent resistive degradation under dynamic conditions.• as OER by-products on Ir oxides in aqueous acidic electrolyte has been detected under potential sweeping conditions [59].

        <p>Overall, the current state-of-the-art anode catalyst layers are robust enough to withstand dynamic operating conditions, although further optimization of the structure and interfaces is required to enhance activity and stability. Concerns raise though when it comes to low loadings. A specific ionomer/membrane degradation route is identified under dynamic operation. The sequential character of different degradation modes is highlighted; the IrO x catalyst selectivity/stability triggers the chemical ionomer degradation, which may even trigger Ti corrosion, suggesting that an optimized operating mode with small number of potential modulations but with complete anode regeneration can restrain overall degradation and enhance the lifetime. The overall stability of the current membrane electrode assemblies suggests that stability experiments should extend for more than the commonly used 1000 h to allow for reliable predictions. Alternatively, accelerated degradation means are required based on prior knowledge of potential degradation routes aided by physicochemical characterization. We believe that the present work is an important step in this direction.Overall, the current state-of-the-art anode catalyst layers are robust enough to withstand dynamic operating conditions, although further optimization of the structure and interfaces is required to enhance activity and stability.
