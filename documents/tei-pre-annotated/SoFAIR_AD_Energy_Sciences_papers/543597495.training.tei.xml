        <p>The growth of the world's population increases the demand for fresh water, food, energy, and technology, which in turn leads to increasing amount of wastewater, produced both by domestic and industrial sources. These different wastewaters contain a wide variety of organic and inorganic compounds which can cause tremendous environmental problems if released untreated. Traditional treatment systems are usually expensive, energy demanding and are often still incapable of solving all challenges presented by the produced wastewaters. Microalgae are promising candidates for wastewater reclamation as they are capable of reducing the amount of nitrogen and phosphate as well as other toxic compounds including heavy metals or pharmaceuticals. Compared to the traditional systems, photosynthetic microalgae require less energy input since they use sunlight as their energy source, and at the same time lower the carbon footprint of the overall reclamation process. This mini-review focuses on recent advances in wastewater reclamation using microalgae. The most common microalgal strains used for this purpose are described as well as the challenges of using wastewater from different origins.The growth of the world's population increases the demand for fresh water, food, energy, and technology, which in turn leads to increasing amount of wastewater, produced both by domestic and industrial sources.

        <p>Since the industrial revolution, water pollution has increasingly become a concern to the public and societal authorities. With the development of the industrial world and a growing population, the demands for freshwater are drastically increasing. The global water demand for agriculture, industry, and municipalities is expected to rise by 20-30% by 2050 (Boretti &amp; Rosa, 2019). One of the consequences of this increase is the generation of larger quantities and varieties of wastewaters, contaminated with a wide range and concentrations of chemicals. Besides utilizing several tons of pesticides per year, the agricultural sector also produces considerable amounts of organic waste (Bockstaller et al., 2009), and is one of the most significant sources of water contamination.Since the industrial revolution, water pollution has increasingly become a concern to the public and societal authorities.

        <p>These pollutants can have dire consequences for the environment and for ecosystems into which they are discharged. Some pollutants, mainly those of organic nature, are generally degradable (either naturally or with the help of microorganisms) and therefore do not cause major problems for the environment. However, some persistent organic pollutants (POPs), typically present in trace amounts, are known to bioaccumulate and exert toxic chronic health effects on animals (Schwarzenbach et al., 2010). Chemical Martin Plöhn and Olivia Spain contributed equally to this study.These pollutants can have dire consequences for the environment and for ecosystems into which they are discharged.

        <p>With increasing amounts of wastewaters produced and the need to supply freshwater to a growing population, a better understanding of the extent of the challenges ahead has been built. Rout and coworkers (Rout et al., 2020) identified more than 50 new "emerging contaminants" (ECs), all of which with anthropogenic origin that require surveillance and attention. The authors review technologies for the removal of ECs and conclude that both activated sludges and membrane bioreactors are effective for this purpose. As our understanding of the challenges and need for treatment of wastewaters from all sources grows, novel wastewater treatment technologies have been developed with the goals of improving efficiency, reducing costs, and reducing the carbon-footprint of large-scale treatment plants. Some of the most common processes include coagulation/ flocculation, precipitation, filtration, oxidation, ion-exchange, solvent extraction, or electrochemical treatment (Crini, 2019), as well as ozonation, adsorption, or membrane bioreactors (Rout et al., 2020). A less conventional and more recently developed technique relies on the use of specific types of biomass to remove pollutants. Microalgae possess the most interesting and most-used type of alternative biomass in current wastewater treatment applications (Acién et al., 2016). They are a diverse group of unicellular photosynthetic organisms, which can grow and even thrive in a wide variety of conditions, including in different types of wastewater. The complex variety of functional groups present in the cell wall of algae allows the binding of pollutants to the cell surface via a phenomenon called biosorption (Michalak et al., 2013;Spain et al., 2021). This rapid and reversible process is independent on the microalgae's metabolism and can thus be performed on living or dead biomass (Michalak et al., 2013). Other compounds are taken up by living cells and are biodegraded. In order to fully comprehend the mechanisms of pollutant removal, the cultivation and growth conditions of microalgae in wastewater must initially be understood (Ubando, 2021).With increasing amounts of wastewaters produced and the need to supply freshwater to a growing population, a better understanding of the extent of the challenges ahead has been built.

        <p>Total municipal wastewater production increases proportionally to the growth of the human population. According to a press release from the "Federal Office of Statistics" (Destatis) in Germany, the daily amount of water used per person was around 126 L in 2009. Eighty percent of this was used for personal hygiene and toilet. This results in a need of roughly 3.2 billion m 3 of wastewater per year to be cleaned in Germany alone (Schleich &amp; Hillenbrand, 2009), while the amount of water used in the United States is almost twice as much as in European countries. Municipal wastewaters are primarily constituted by water used in households. Thus, their contamination is mostly due to easily degradable organic matter. However, several POPs are also present in micro-concentrations (amounts below the mg/L range). Chemicals within this range of concentrations are often referred to as micropollutants. These micropollutants are, for the most part, pharmaceuticals, hormones, surfactants, plasticizers, flame retardants, and pesticides (Luo et al., 2014). Traditional municipal wastewater treatment is performed in a multi-step system, consisting of a primary (sedimentation/settling for removal of coarse suspended solids), secondary (to reduce biodegradable organic matter dissolved or in colloidal suspension), and tertiary treatment (typically to remove N, P, and potentially harmful microorganisms). Based on the composition of the wastewater, additional steps might be necessary before and after the treatment. Therefore, conventional treatment systems are quite expensive resulting into high costs for water usage per person. Municipal wastewater in general contains high amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic carbon, but also a large variety of other contaminants such as pharmaceuticals or heavy metals due to mixture with extraneous water and rainfall water (see Table 1). Despite these contaminants, the main focus of cleaning municipal wastewater is the removal of organic matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus as they are one of the main causes of eutrophication.Total municipal wastewater production increases proportionally to the growth of the human population.

        <p>The growth of the world's population leads not only to larger amounts of municipal wastewater, but also to the need for more food production. Based on the "Proceedings of the UN-Water project in Safe Use of Wastewater in Agriculture" the amount of drinking water required to produce the daily food needed by one person is between 2000 and 5000 L. The agriculture sector is not only the largest consumer of drinking water, but also the largest producer of wastewater (Mateo-Sagasta et al., 2013). Livestock produces "runoff"-water, which is extremely rich in phosphorus and nitrogen (in form of ammonia) (see Table 1). In addition to nutrients, agricultural wastewater can contain a variety of other components such as pesticides or herbicides as well as antibiotics or any other pharmaceutical given to animals. While the manure that comes with the wastewater is often used as fertilizer, the water itself enters conventional wastewater treatment. Nutrients from the manure that are not taken up by crops will enter the water body, resulting in a high risk of eutrophication. Therefore, proper treatment of agriculture waste and wastewater is mandatory.The growth of the world's population leads not only to larger amounts of municipal wastewater, but also to the need for more food production.

        <p>Industrial wastewaters come in a wide variety. Water consumption and contamination are particularly high within the paper, cloth, and plywood industries. The C&amp;A foundation reported that their cloth supply chain requires between 5.7 and 9.7 billion m 3 of water per year (Franke &amp; Mathews, 2013). The lack of reliable data about water consumption by the paper industry, makes an accurate estimation of the total used water almost impossible, however, the total water footprint of one A4 sheet of paper was estimated to be between 13-20 L (Hoekstra, 2015). These wastewaters usually contain much smaller amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus, but higher concentrations of different carbon sources. Though less than the two previous examples, the plywood industry is also one of the more significant water pollution sources. Wastewaters from this industry are characterized by a high concentration of solids, organic matter, and nitrogen, as well as toxic chemicals, such as phenol or heavy metals like copper, cadmium, or lead (Heng et al., 2004;Mukherjee et al., 2007;Muñoz et al., 2006;Prasad et al., 2019). The impact of this industry in the total amount of wastewaters produced is also on the rise, particularly in rich countries, where household and office furniture are regularly replaced. These are examples of the primary industrial consumers due to the shear amount of water they use.Industrial wastewaters come in a wide variety.

        <p>Before wastewater treatment, the load and nature of pollution generated by the industrial sector can be categorized by the type of activity: the same type of industry will roughly generate the same amount of wastewater with the same profile of contaminants. However, often inefficient treatments (or even no treatments) are applied, due to the lack of regulatory frameworks and their respective legal enforcements. Thus, examples can be found where industrial wastewaters are almost 100% recycled and reused, as well as being discharged into natural aquifers without any treatment whatsoever.Before wastewater treatment, the load and nature of pollution generated by the industrial sector can be categorized by the type of activity: the same type of industry will roughly generate the same amount of wastewater with the same profile of contaminants.

        <p>The use of algae for wastewater reclamation has been studied since the 1960s and is currently trending even more for circular blue bioeconomy approaches. Microalgae have been applied to the treatment of wastewater due to their ability to utilize organic and inorganic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, while simultaneously accumulating biomass and reducing N, P, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the wastewater (Ferro, Gentili, et al., 2018;Sawayama et al., 1992;Zhang et al., 2013). Several microalgae are even capable of removing heavy metals from industrial wastewater via biosorption. Combined removal of nitrogen, phosphorus, and heavy metals was shown to be possible using industrial wastewater as microalgal growth medium (Chinnasamy et al., 2010).

Algal Enterprises (Australia) have a solution destined for a wide range of wastewaters which consists of a closed PBR system coupled to an anaerobic digestor to produce biogas (Montingelli et al., 2015). RNEW technology of Microbio Engineering (US) uses open raceway ponds enriched with CO 2 for removal of N and P from municipal wastewater and produce biomass for biofuels (Craggs et al., 2011).

        <p>Concentration and availability of nitrogen or phosphorus impact the microalgal metabolism in specific ways. Many microalgae will continue to produce biomass under N-starvation, but instead of producing proteins, they will increase the amount of lipids and/or carbohydrates (Gojkovic et al., 2020). A dependency between the uptake of N and P has been observed. Nitrogen uptake is enhanced by the presence of phosphorus, and a surplus of phosphorus can be taken up by the algae (luxury uptake) in the presence of N (Bougaran et al., 2010). The pH value is important for the availability of nutrients (Posadas et al., 2015). It affects, for example, the solubility of ammonium or phosphate as well as the formation of precipitates.Concentration and availability of nitrogen or phosphorus impact the microalgal metabolism in specific ways.

        <p>High pH values of 9 or higher can induce the formation of calcium phosphate, which is unavailable for microalgae (Laliberté et al., 1997).

        <p>The color of wastewater plays an important role in wastewater cleaning as it affects microalgal growth and nutrient removal (Marcilhac et al., 2014). Dark brownish-grayish and opaque wastewater (e.g. livestock wastewater, pulp, and paper) show high absorbances of light, limiting photosynthetic light absorption of microalgae and therefore their growth and nutrient uptake (Lee &amp; Lee, 2001;Lee &amp; Shoda, 2008).The color of wastewater plays an important role in wastewater cleaning as it affects microalgal growth and nutrient removal (Marcilhac et al., 2014).

        <p>The genus Chlorella is composed of unicellular, nonmotile spherical green microalgae of 2-10 μm in diameter. Chlorella is currently the best-studied and most cultivated microalgae worldwide, mostly due to its high photosynthetic efficiency and high nutritional value (Masojídek &amp; Torzillo, 2008). On many occasions, Chlorella species have shown their high biosorption capacities and efficiency to remove pollutants from various aqueous solutions. Chlorella vulgaris displayed a removal efficiency of total phosphorous (TP) content of around 85% and a removal efficiency of total nitrogen (TN) content of around 89% (Wang et al., 2015). Chlorella minutissima and Chlorella sorokiniana were shown to remove up to 41 and 34% of the TN and up to 70% of the TP (Singh et al., 2011).

        <p>Botryococcus braunii is a promising strain for wastewater treatment and biomass valorization. This green freshwater microalgae lives mainly in colonies that float in large masses on the top of the water (Borowitzka, 2018). This algae is well known for its capacity to produce large quantities of long-chain hydrocarbons and lipids, which can be used to produce biofuel. As seen in Table 1, B. braunii is also used for the removal of nitrogen and phosphorous from wastewater. This alga thrives in wastewater that has high TN and TP values, and can not only remove nitrogen and phosphorous from the wastewater, but in turn use it to produce more hydrocarbons (An et al., 2003).Botryococcus braunii is a promising strain for wastewater treatment and biomass valorization.

        <p>Other microalgal strains are equally interesting for wastewater treatment due to their ability to remove heavy metals and pharmaceuticals. Desmodesmus sp. and Heterochlorella sp. were used to remove copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn) from their growing environment. Desmodesmus sp. was especially efficient at removing iron (up to 86% after 16 days). Heterochlorella sp. was more efficient at removing Mn, with an adsorption percentage of 84% at 10 mgL -1 . The removal of the ion happened both by adsorption and by uptake within the cell (up to 99% was accumulated inside the cell) (Abinandan et al., 2019).Other microalgal strains are equally interesting for wastewater treatment due to their ability to remove heavy metals and pharmaceuticals.

        <p>The microalgae Nannochloris sp. is able to remove triclosan, an antimicrobial, from the growth medium during light/dark cycles and even in total darkness. 100% of the triclosan was removed when the algae was grown for 7 days in the light/dark cycles and 97% was removed when the algae was grown in dark conditions for 14 days (Bai &amp; Acharya, 2016). The green microalgae Selenastrum capricornutum was shown to be effective at removing hormones such as et al., 2016;Park et al., 2011;Posadas et al., 2017). Environmental parameters such as light intensity, light period, and temperature play a key role in influencing the performance and cost effectiveness of algal treatment systems. Importantly, the impact of these factors is also interlinked (Hwang et al., 2016;Mohsenpour et al., 2021). Therefore, the location of the algal-based wastewater reclamation system plays a key-role for cost-efficiency of the process. Seasonal changes in day length and light intensities are location-specific and have an important role on algal communities and their macromolecular structures (Ferro et al., 2020;Posadas et al., 2017). The employment of native strains is advantageous in exploiting the inherent suitability to specific environmental conditions, an important consideration in achieving maximal effectiveness with minimal energy input (low light and low temperature). Screening of culture collections (e.g. HAMBI [University of Helsinki Culture Collection, http://www.helsinki.fi/hambi/]) (Lynch et al., 2015) and/or the MicroBioRefine collection of local Nordic strains (Ferro, Gentili, &amp; Funk, 2018) resulted in the identification of native isolates with high potential for integrated wastewater treatment and biofuel production. Recently, the potential of indigenous Nordic algal strains has been documented on water remediation, as feedstock for biofuel and high-value compounds in either lab or pilot scale under Nordic conditions (Cheregi et al., 2019). Algal strains from Sweden (Ferro, Gentili, et al., 2018;Ferro, Gorzs as, et al., 2018;Lindberg et al., 2021), from Finland (Jämsä et al., 2017;Lynch et al., 2015), and from Quebec, Canada (Abdelaziz et al., 2014) have been employed for their ability to treat municipal wastewater in cold climate. Even Arctic and Antarctic strains have been screened for their potential use in outdoor wastewater treatment systems at cold temperatures. A promising Polar cyanobacterial strain has been identified with satisfactory growth rates and an advantage for harvesting due to the formation of floc-aggregates. However, at warmer temperatures, green algae outcompeted the polar strains (Tang et al., 1997).

        <p>Nordic isolates have been shown not only to remove N and P from municipal wastewater, but also pharmaceuticals. Swedish microalgae strains showed promising removal of several pharmaceuticals with satisfactory growth performances in lab-scale photobioreactors (PBRs) (Gojkovic et al., 2019;Lindberg et al., 2021). A pilot-scale algal cultivation achieved partial or total removal of pharmaceuticals from urban wastewater with a mixed population of wild freshwater green algae under natural light and with the addition of flue gases (Gentili &amp; Fick, 2017;Lindberg et al., 2021).Nordic isolates have been shown not only to remove N and P from municipal wastewater, but also pharmaceuticals.

        <p>Although cold-adapted algal strains demonstrated biomass accumulation and wastewater remediation in cold climate, there is still concern about outdoor performance in the winter season. At cold temperatures algal metabolism slows down, additionally, the low light availability in winter places a serious threat (Ferro, Gorzs as, et al., 2018). Hence, the integration of algal cultivation into greenhouse infrastructures presents an opportunity in Nordic countries to operate year-around. Several pilot-scale algal-based wastewater treatment systems are covered by greenhouses to ensure essential growth conditions in cold regions (Ferro et al., 2020;Gentili &amp; Fick, 2017;Salazar et al., 2020). Integrating algae cultivation into power plants is another opportunity to be considered to cope with the harsh winter conditions. In Iceland, for example, a local microalga was cultivated in a geothermal brine, where heating was provided by geothermal electricity, enriched with low percentages of Walne growth medium to supply additional nutrients (Cheregi et al., 2019).Although cold-adapted algal strains demonstrated biomass accumulation and wastewater remediation in cold climate, there is still concern about outdoor performance in the winter season.

A temperature increase above the optimal growth conditions drastically decreased growth and productivity (AlMomani &amp; Örmeci, 2020;Park et al., 2011). Moreover, prolonged exposures to excess light intensities and direct sunlight can cause photodamage and photoinhibition resulting in the reduction of algal culture growth and eventually induce cell death (Christenson &amp; Sims, 2011;Posadas et al., 2017). It is important to consider that in warm climate evaporation raises, which leads to increased salinity causing osmotic and cellular ionic stress (Hwang et al., 2016).Using algal-based wastewater reclamation in hot climates has its own challenges (AlMomani &amp; Örmeci, 2020;Posadas et al., 2017).

        <p>The immobilization of microalgae include natural or induced biofilm formation (passive immobilization) and entrapment of the cells in hydrogel polymer matrices (active immobilization). Immobilization of the algal cells takes advantage of the microalgal tendency to form biofilms. Inorganic and organic compounds adhere to the surface of a bedding material, creating a favorable environment for microbial growth (Qureshi et al., 2005;Stephens et al., 2015). Once microalgae and bacteria have colonized the surface, they begin secreting extracellular substances composed of nucleic acids, proteins, polysaccharides, and phospholipids, which serve to improve adherence to the bedding material, but also to entrap and concentrate nutrients necessary for cell growth (Mohsenpour et al., 2021;Qureshi et al., 2005) Moving bed biofilm Reactor (MBB), or (5) photo-rotating biological contactor (PRBC) (Katarzyna et al., 2015). An example for the configuration of a rotating algal biofilm reactor (RABR) can be observed in Figure 1 (Christenson &amp; Sims, 2012). In these type of reactors, microalgal growth takes place in a biofilm on the surface of a cylinder that is partially submerged in wastewater and rotates to alternate exposure of the biomass to the wastewater and to the air.The immobilization of microalgae include natural or induced biofilm formation (passive immobilization) and entrapment of the cells in hydrogel polymer matrices (active immobilization).

However, some drawbacks still limit large-scale and commercial uses of immobilized microalgal systems: the polymeric matrices used for cell immobilization are prone to degradation over F I G U R E 1 Scheme of a bench scale RABR and a suspended growth reactor (Christenson &amp; Sims, 2012), reproduced with permission from John Wiley and Sons time resulting in leaching of the cells (Mohsenpour et al., 2021), and the production of these systems (particularly for high volumes of wastewater) faces cost and technical know-how constraints (Gonçalves et al., 2017). In addition, immobilized microalgal biomass requires a high surface area to ensure an efficient performance. For example, it was estimated (Acién et al., 2016) that the land area necessary to accommodate these systems would be at least twice as much as the area taken by conventional treatment systems. Nevertheless, the authors conclude that the profits can outweigh the increased costs in municipal treatment plants for small cities. The immobilization matrix should provide mechanical and chemical stability, while exhibiting good mass transfer characteristics to favor an effective transport between phases. Although synthetic polymers, such as polyacrylamide, polyurethane, and polyvinyl might be used as matrix, commonly immobilization methods are based on natural biopolymers such as agar, alginate, carrageenan, and nanocellulose (Jämsä et al., 2018;Kosourov et al., 2018;Mohammed et al., 2018).
