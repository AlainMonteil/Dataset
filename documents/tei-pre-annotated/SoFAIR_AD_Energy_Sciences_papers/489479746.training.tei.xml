        <p>The exponentially growing contribution of renewable energy sources in the electricity mix requires large systems for energy storage to tackle resources intermittency. In this context, the technologies for hydrogen production offer a clean and versatile alternative to boost renewables penetration and energy security. Hydrogen production as a strategy for the decarbonization of the energy sources mix has been investigated since the beginning of the 1990s. The stationary sector, i.e. all parts of the economy excluding the transportation sector, accounts for almost three-quarters of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions (mass of CO 2 -eq) in the world associated with power generation. While several publications focus on the hybridization of renewables with traditional energy storage systems or in different pathways of hydrogen use (mainly power-to-gas), this study provides an insightful analysis of the state of art and evolution of renewable hydrogen-based systems (RHS) to power the stationary sector. The analysis started with a thorough review of RHS deployments for power-to-power stationary applications, such as in power generation, industry, residence, commercial building, and critical infrastructure. Then, a detailed evaluation of relevant techno-economic parameters such as levelized cost of energy (LCOE), hydrogen roundtrip efficiency (HRE), loss of power supply probability (LPSP), self-sufficiency ratio (SSR), or renewable fraction (f RES ) is provided. Subsequently, lab-scale plants and pilot projects together with current market trends and commercial uptake of RHS and fuel cell systems are examined. Finally, the future techno-economic barriers and challenges for short and medium-term deployment of RHS are identified and discussed.</p>
        <p>Greenhouse gases (GHG) reduction is in the spotlight since the end of the XX century. Thus, an international response is being coordinated to cut down global emissions and limiting the increase in the global average temperature to 2 • C above pre-industrial levels [1][2][3]. The use of hydrogen is a proven alternative for the mitigation of global warming and comply with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Moreover, its large-scale hybridization with Renewable Energy Sources (RES) represents a clean and sustainable solution to boost the required energy transition [4,5].</p>
        <p>Historically, hydrogen has been considered as a valuable commodity gas and a chemical feedstock mostly in oil refining and for the production of fertilizers [6]. Nevertheless, it is also a clean and flexible energy carrier produced from primary energy sources, chemicals with hydrogen atom, e.g., methane, water, or also as a by-product of chlor-alkali plants. Moreover, there are other novel methods for hydrogen production being developed that use different sources for its generation: fossil fuels [7,8], biomass [9], wastes [10,11], bacteria [12], etc. Hydrogen can enhance the flexibility of the energy system matching energy supply to demand profiles [13]. Furthermore, it is time and location shifting: it allows from daily to seasonal storage, enabling local and global distribution. Additionally, its use is not restricted to electricity generation [14].</p>
        <p>Hydrogen hybridization makes renewables contribution even more significant, avoiding the existing mismatch between demand and supply because of wind and solar resources intermittency [15]. It also enables sector coupling, allowing the conversion of generated power into different useable forms. This hybridization also permits energy storage through hydrogen and its distribution for every end-user [16]. The different ways of integrating hydrogen and RES across the energy sectors can be classified as follows:</p>
        <p>• Power-to-power: water electrolysis transforms electricity into hydrogen, which is stored and re-electrified when needed using a fuel cell (FC). Hydrogen can be also used to run combined cycle gas turbines.</p>
        <p>applications of the most committed countries in the deployment of hydrogen technologies.</p>
        <p>Several works analyze and report the potential benefits of RES hybridization with different traditional storage methods like pumped hydro or compressed air [56] and optimization methodologies [57,58]. Other authors approach power-to-gas [59][60][61], power-to-fuel [62] or power-to-x projects (referring to every hydrogen use pathway) [63]. However, there are few reported studies of hydrogen FC systems and their hybridization with renewable energies to decarbonize stationary applications [64]. Therefore, this manuscript provides an in-depth review of RHS and their deployment in this sector.</p>
        <p>This study explores and review the recent technical literature about RES, ESS, power-to-gas hydrogen generation, stationary applications of RHS, and power retrieval by FC technology. These components are integrated into many different topologies of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and renewable power flow. A tabular techno-economic analysis presents the existing literature organized by configurations, size, power capacity, electrolyzer technology and RHS application type for the stationary sector [65,66]. Completing the analysis of the theme from a comprehensive perspective, a brief overview presents the global market and the main suppliers of RHS technology.</p>
        <p>Hydrogen use as an energy carrier is relatively new. Therefore, different barriers apart from techno-economic boundaries arise to achieve broader deployment of hybrid systems. Thus, this article evaluates existing barriers and drawbacks (like current legal framework, environmental impact of hybrid systems, required infrastructure, safety concerns, and societal factors) and proposes further actions to reach the goal of decarbonization of the stationary sector. Finally, the most relevant outcomes obtained through the analysis of RHS are discussed.</p>

        <p>decarbonization of the global economy in light of the GHG emission targets by 2050. Particularly, photovoltaic panels (PV panels) and wind turbines (WT) are the main renewable alternatives to slow down GHG emissions in the stationary sector. As for 2019, RES represent 72% of the total new capacity additions (considering both RES and fossil fuel-based power systems), being wind and solar power 90% of this newly installed renewable volume [27]. The highest PV power potential is reached in the tropics (corresponding to the north and south of Africa, Australia, and the Middle East) and desert areas of China, and Mongolia, while wind power densities increase with the latitude. Concerning technology development, the knowledge collected over the years has led to a significant cost reduction of both technologies. PV CAPEX is below 1000 US$/kWp in almost 70% of the PV market [67], reaching a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of 0.057 US$/kWh during 1st half of 2019 [68]. According to the US Department of Energy, wind LCOE will drop between 24% and 30% for onshore and both fixed-bottom and floating offshore technologies. Larger and developed rotors, taller towers, economies of scale, durability, reliability, and financing costs reduction are the main cost drivers [69].</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, RES cannot operate on their own. The intermittency and shifting nature of solar, wind, or water renewable resources make it indispensable to couple them with dispatchable backup power generation or energy storage systems (ESS) to mimic baseload and load following power supply. In this sense, different ESS have been developed and tested across the years (pumped water, batteries, compressed air, flywheels, supercapacitors, thermal storage, etc.) [70]. Although these traditional ESS are fully developed and cost-competitive, they present different drawbacks such as large area requirements, negative environmental impact, materials availability, etc. [71]. In such a way, hydrogen technologies offer an environmentally friendly and flexible solution for energy storage, being adaptive and feasible for bulk energy quantities and small backup systems, with fast response time and full load operating times over 12 h as depicted in Fig. 1.</p>
        <p>The hybridization of hydrogen and renewables will enable the mitigation of GHG emissions in different stationary applications with high pollution indexes such as power system plants, industry, residential, and building sectors. Besides, hydrogen versatility makes it appropriate to be coupled with other ESS such as batteries or supercapacitors. These ESS are usually employed for energy short-term storage, whilst hydrogen affords energy-saving seasonally. Hydrogen technologies can operate in standalone or grid-connected systems with or without fossil fuels-based backup generators like diesel generators (DG). In Fig. 2, we show the typical RHS power supply chain for stationary applications.</p>
        <p>Renewable energies like solar, wind, hydraulic, geothermal, tidal, and biomass (accounted as renewable due to its feedstock carbon neutrality) are considered primary power supply sources. The RES surpluses are then employed to charge the energy storage system (consisting of batteries, supercapacitors, etc.) and to run the hydrogen chain: the electrolyzer uses the energy to generate hydrogen that is stored in vessels, pressurized tanks (needing an intermediate compressor), salt caverns, etc. The stored energy is released via direct electricity or hydrogen re-electrification in a fuel cell system when renewable energy is not enough to cover the demand. Furthermore, diesel generators and grid connections can be used as dispatchable backup energy sources to avoid power shortage, but they may imply CO 2 emissions. Microgrids with properly sized RHS and grid-tied converters may be remunerated for back feeding the power utility grid in compliance with the local legislation for self-consumption. Finally, hybrid systems are particularly interesting in remote areas with limited or no access to the grid.</p>
        <p>The diversity of the stationary applications implies a wide range of hybrid systems sizes and configurations depending on renewables availability. From small backup installations to multi-MW power systems, RHS represent a reliable alternative to cut down CO 2 emissions. Focusing on the configuration, these systems are classified in this work in binary (one RES and one FC), ternary (two RES and one FC), or multisource systems (three or more RES and one FC) as depicted in Fig. 3.</p>
        <p>Three main categories are considered depending on the backup system employed, which are off-grid (Off-G) for standalone and selfsufficient systems, diesel generator (DG) for those including a fossil fuel-based generator as energy backup, and grid-connected (GC) for the systems integrated into the grid. Besides, electrochemical devices (supercapacitors and batteries) and hydrogen technologies are accounted for as the main energy storage systems. Finally, the depicted components are connected to AC or DC power line depending on the type of current supplied and/or consumed (some components like the electrolyzer can be fed by the AC bus, if interfaced by an AC/DC converter, or the DC bus). The power system that electrically supports the components of the RHS is equipped with a multitude of power electronic converters (DC/DC, AC/AC, or AC/DC) to keep power stability in both AC and DC voltage.</p>
        <p>This section aims at analyzing the applicability of hybrid systems from theoretical studies and experimental prototypes to large pilot projects, and even available commercial devices coupling fuel cells and renewable energies for different stationary applications.</p>
        <p>Previously to the implementation of experimental plants, theoretical studies serve as a useful tool to analyze the influence of different techno- -Load demand to be supplied, variability, and application. -Capital, operation, and replacement costs of the equipment, levelized cost of energy (LCOE), and net present cost (NPC) of the project. -Availability of RES, power grid for external interconnection, nonsalty water for electrolysis, and land for system deployment. -System configuration: topology (binary/ternary systems, on/offgrid, backup systems, etc.), technology (fuel cell, electrolyzer, energy storage system, efficiencies, etc.), and electricity share among generators. -Loss of power supply probability (LPSP), self-sufficiency ratio (SSR), the renewable fraction (f RES ), energy management strategy (EMS), dynamic response to fluctuations, energy excesses, or simulation parameters. -Storage safety concerns, applicable regulations, codes, and standards.</p>
        <p>The published theoretical studies report various simulations aiming at covering the load demand. Moreover, these simulations focus on different techno-economic parameters among which the following stand out: LCOE, hydrogen roundtrip efficiency (HRE), LPSP, SSR, and f RES .</p>
        <p>)</p>
        <p>where C ann,tot is the total annualized cost of the system, E load is the total load consumption, and η FC are the electrolyzer and FC efficiencies respectively, E load (t) and E gen (t) are the consumed and generated energy in every time step, E grid,imp is the total energy imported from the grid and E non,RES is the total non-renewable energy consumed. In this work, renewable hydrogen-based systems are divided into three different groups according to their dimension: small-scale (load demands between 0 and 50 kWh/day or FC rated powers ranging from 0 to 25 kW), medium-scale (load demands from 50 to 500 kWh/day or installed FC powers from 25 to 100 kW) and large-scale schemes (load demands or FC rated powers over 500 kWh/day and 100 kW respectively).</p>
        <p>Regarding their configuration, binary systems (one RES and one FC) secure a good trade-off between system simplicity, autonomy, and economic feasibility in locations with abundant solar irradiation or high wind densities. This means that with the proper design and sufficient renewable resources, system self-sufficiency can be achieved, so that the primary renewable energy is sufficient to cover the load and sufficient energy (in the form of hydrogen or batteries) can be stored from excess RES energy. On the contrary, they present higher energy excess for offgrid systems with seasonal energy storage and lower flexibility since there is only one RES available.</p>
        <p>Ternary solutions (two RES and one FC) are commonly applied in locations with specific limitations such as remote areas or detached buildings. The electronics involved and the integration complexity of these configurations imply raising the investment. Nevertheless, the coupling increases systems resiliency in case of failures or low availability of renewable resources. It also contributes positively to reduce energy excess for off-grid loads and micro-grids due to solar and wind energies complementarity.</p>
        <p>Tables 2 and3 gather the publications that address small-medium and large-scale RHS for different stationary applications, focusing on the optimal off-grid scheme reported in every publication. The optimal off-grid configuration is selected either directly from each manuscript or among multiple simulated scenarios within the work. References are classified from the largest to the smallest load covered and FC rated power. The table includes different characteristics of the renewable energy source, hydrogen chain size (fuel cell, electrolyzer, stored hydrogen, and the pressure), energy stored in ESS, the backup technology employed (off-grid, diesel generator, and grid-connected), load type, location, application, levelized cost of energy and hydrogen roundtrip efficiency.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Binary RHS based on PV frequently appear as an alternative for small-medium scale residential communities [77][78][79], commercial and research buildings [72,83,84], single-family housing [93,[96][97][98] or telecom stations [104]. These systems allow not only to cover electricity demands but also to obtain heat storable in water tanks from waste heat produced during FC operation or using solar thermal collectors like those in the report of Assaf et al. [99,100].</p>
        <p>Likewise, ternary hybrid configurations are mainly used for residential and different buildings: nursing homes [80], laboratory buildings [128], or office buildings [124]. Other publications evaluate the deployment of ternary systems due to high RES availability. For instance, Duman et al. [76] simulated a PV/WT/FC facility located on the Turkish west coast. This region has great potential for both PV and WT with solar irradiation levels over 1500 kWh/m 2 -year and average wind speeds between 7 and 9 m/s.</p>
        <p>Authors like Ghaffari et al. [118] performed a sensitivity analysis on the LPSP and f RES to assess their impact on the final system dimensions and net present cost. For the scenario of LPSP = 0%, halving f RES from 0.8 to 0.4 reduces PV panels by 60%, requiring 15 times fewer FC units and 9 times less electrolyzer and hydrogen tank capacity. Moreover, for the maximal f RES = 0.8, slightly increasing the LPSP to 0.05% reflects a reduction of almost 40 kW in the installed DG capacity.</p>
        <p>The presence of batteries impacts the installed RES power for similar off-grid loads as noticed in Takatsu et al. [91] and Castañeda et al. [93], where a 10.5 kWh battery capacity in the last case reduces by 40% the PV power needed. These cases also demonstrate the location effect (Japan and Spain). Takatsu et al. reports lower electrolyzer capacity thanks to auxiliary hydrogen obtained through steam methane reforming. Besides, Castañeda et al. [93,94] study two different RHS to cover a residential load of 11 kWh/day in Spain, comparing the performance of both binary and ternary schemes. The optimal binary system consists of 6 kW PV, 1.2 kW FC, 3 kW electrolyzer, 3 kg stored hydrogen, and 10.5 kWh battery capacity. Conversely, the optimal ternary facility comprises 1.5 kW PV and 1.5 kW WT rated power respectively, the same FC capacity of 1.2 kW, 2 kW electrolyzer, 1 kg stored hydrogen, and a battery bank of 5.3 kWh. Thus, when a WT is integrated with the system, it leads to a reduction of half of the RES power required and threefold of hydrogen storage capacity, as well as downsizing the electrolyzer and battery bank by 33% and 50% respectively.</p>
        <p>Large-scale PV and WT farms are usually deployed far from urban areas. Massive investment are normally needed for the construction of high voltage transmission systems to deliver high levels of power quality to distant customers, as required by the electrical regulatory agencies and standards. RHS associated with FC can improves the service availability to the customers by locally doing peak shaving and valley filling of the RES intermittent power. RHS is particularly convenient to customers in remote areas with precarious access to the grid.</p>
        <p>Solar stands out over wind for binary large-scale systems covering different stationary loads that imply the presence of buildings like academic centers [135,151], industrial facilities [133,148], or residential and commercial applications [137,141,144]. However, Chade et al. and Abdin et al. [140,156] evaluated WT/FC configurations in Iceland and Canada due to high wind densities.</p>
        <p>Conversely, ternary schemes are often reported in remote areas like those simulated by Kalinci et al., Luta et al., and Samy et al. [142,145,146] or cities as in Abdin et al. [156] with land restrictions to deploying large-scale PV plants. However, transportable and more accessible fossil-fuelled generators can be used in isolated areas to ensure energy supply continuity, like in Phan et al. and Cozzolino et al. [134,153] who tested them in combination with RHS in islands. Mohseni et al. [154] studied an alternative multi-source system as part of a green hydrogen power supply chain and a large remote area in New Zeeland.</p>
        <p>Despite grid access is a constraining factor in certain locations due to the required investment and engineering complexity, several publications evaluate grid-connected configurations to supply large residential applications. Daraei et al. [132] defined a grid-integrated PV/HD/Bio configuration to power 275,000 homes, including a 1.7 MW compressor in the modeling, while HassanzadehFard et al. [149] studied a smaller PV/WT based system to provide electricity to a microgrid of households in Hawaii with backup hydrogen supply via steam methane reforming. Similarly, Ceran et al. [143] proposed a large residential application with hydrogen compression and Jahangir et al. [136] designed a large-scale PV/WT plant to cover the demand of a sports complex.</p>
        <p>The location has a major impact in the final configuration. Hutty et al. [139] conducted a simulation to supply 92 households in different locations (southeast England and Texas) with an achieved self-sufficiency ratio (SSR) of 90% and considering compression needs. Despite Texas' consumption is threefold the requirements of England, the needed PV power is bigger in the latter (1.61 MW) than in Texas (1.49 MW) due to the higher solar irradiation available. Moreover, if we compare the results with the ones reported by Luta et al. [145] for a remote community with a daily consumption of 1080.5 kWh/day in South Africa, a decrease of three times on RES capacity required (0.66 MW PV/WT) is appreciated. However, the FC power required is proportional to the load. Therefore, the FC capacity in Texas is almost three times (0.8 MW) the one required for UK and South Africa (0.35 and 0.3 MW respectively). Likewise, Coppitters et al. [152] reported a maximal SSR of 59% for a residential micro-grid of housing. The remaining load is covered by importing electricity from the grid.</p>
        <p>Renewable hydrogen-based alternatives must reach economic competitiveness to become a realistic alternative to fossil fuels for stationary power supply. Green hydrogen already represents a clean alternative with water and heat as only wastes, while grey hydrogen generation by steam methane reforming produces 9-11 kg of CO 2 -eq emissions per H 2 kg generated. However, production costs for grey and green hydrogen are 0.6-1.9 and 3.7-6.1 US$ per H 2 kg as for 2020 [157].</p>
        <p>Based on low and high heating values (LHV and HHV), 33.3 to 39.4 kWh are obtained per H 2 kg generated. Therefore, hydrogen roundtrip efficiency is key to harvest the largest amount of energy feasible and it strongly influences the achieved LCOE. Several small and medium-sized configurations report hydrogen roundtrip efficiencies values under 40%, being Rezk et al. [75] and Assaf. et al. [100] the only publications with higher HRE (76.5 and 65.3% respectively), while large-scale facilities show values above 48% except in the report of Samy et al. [147] whose HRE is 34%. The compression stage also contributes to raising the investment as it involves great energy consumptions, and additional safety and infrastructure requirements. Only Cano et al., Rullo et [86,110,124,132,143] incorporate compressors into their models, pressurizing the hydrogen up to 300 bar.</p>
        <p>System components CAPEX have a great influence on the economics of the project. Therefore, Table 5 compiles real capital expenditures and the maturity level of main equipment reported by international agencies and associations like IEA, IRENA, US Department of Energy, Hydrogen Council, Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking Programme (FCH JU), etc. The CAPEX/kWh of FC and electrolyzers decreases for large-scale RHS due to economy of scale. Moreover, it classifies FC systems per stationary application according to the technology readiness level (TRL). The TRL 0-3 classification corresponds to idea conception and technical formulation, 4-5 to prototyping, 6-7 to prototype validation under real operating conditions and 8-9 to production and commercialization.</p>
        <p>With global residential electricity prices ranging between 0.005 and 0.365 US$/kWh, several references achieve LCOE similar to grid prices [160,161]. Fig. 4 depicts a comparison between residential electricity prices per country and the levelized cost of energy reflected by the different RHS per country evaluated in this study. In general, it can be appreciated that renewable hydrogen-based configurations do not reach the average rate of each country. However, there are publications reflecting cost of energies below the maximum reported residential electricity price in Germany, which require a more detailed analysis for possible application in other countries. Furthermore, these systems show a downward trend in terms of energy prices in the face of increasingly higher electricity rates, mainly in the most developed countries, due to penalties for CO 2 emissions. Therefore, Fig. 5 depicts a cost breakdown of main equipment within references showing a cost of energy below 0.365 US$/kWh (dotted and dashed line in Fig. 4) that are compared with CAPEX collected in Table 5. Hence, it is aimed at assessing the influence of prices and configurations considered in published manuscripts in comparison with the costs contemplated by international organisms and the influence of installing diesel generators or connecting the system to the grid in the final LCOE. It also establishes a comparison between publications analyzing multiple scenarios to evaluate the influence of installing backup generators or importing energy from the grid in the LCOE. References are classified as off-grid (Off-G, no backup employed), gridconnected (GC), or diesel generator (DG). The legend shows the LCOE reported in every reference and the backup system if any. Blue boxes represent the range of reported costs by international agencies (real prices). Moreover, Fig. 5 includes a comparison of the LCOE obtained in different scenarios within the same reference in order to check the difference between completely self-sufficient systems and those that need an ancillary generator or electrical connection.</p>
        <p>Most of the small-medium scale off-grid references underestimate different hydrogen chain components: Das et [133,135,137] underrated tank CAPEX (0.5US$/kg H 2 stored) and Rezk et al. [148] estimated capital costs below international prices for every hydrogen chain device. Hassan et al. [98] and Jahangir et al. [136] tested grid-connected systems with undervalued tank costs and with a low contribution of the FC due to the price of the energy imported from the grid respectively, lowering hydrogen chain size and final energy prices. This undervaluation of hydrogen-related technologies implies oversized storage tanks, fuel cells, and electrolyzers, allowing larger amounts of energy stored and reducing the required RES power.</p>
        <p>However, Duman et al. [76] achieved competitive LCOE (0.309 $/kWh) with components CAPEX comparable to the reported ones or Assaf et al. [100] that secured a cost of energy of 0.342$/kWh, both with off-grid systems. Other publications from Dawood et al. and Samy. et al. [141,147] have obtained competitive LCOE with 100% self-sufficient large-scale systems and equipment prices in the range of the internationally reported capital expenditures.</p>
        <p>The comparison of multiple scenarios where Off-G, DG, and GC scenarios are simulated demonstrates that the gap in terms of costcompetitiveness between RHS and other alternatives is being reduced. Das et al. and Dawood et al. [78,141] compared 100% energy supply with diesel generators and off-grid RHS, being off-grid solutions around 0.30$/kWh cheaper than DG-based ones. Ghenai et al. and Duman et al. [76,135] showed minor LCOE differences (the latter for the regular occupancy scenario).</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, additional efforts are required to close the current existing difference. Future CAPEX reductions reflect promising LCOE for renewable hydrogen-based strategies. Particularly, in Ozden et al. [82], a sensitivity analysis is conducted varying PV capital investment between 1600 and 5000 US$/kW, obtaining a cost of energy of 0.377 and 0.706 US$/kWh for the same hydrogen technologies prices, which are the main cost-drivers.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Heras et al. [162] have recently evaluated a future Spanish energetic scenario, where solar and wind energy in combination with fuel cells, electrolyzers, compressors, and metal hydride tanks replace coal and nuclear plants. Compared to the base assumption, the The conclusions drawn from the analysis of simulated RHS are as follows:</p>
        <p>i. A clear predominance of PV as the main RES over wind turbines or others is reflected from small to large-scale systems for both binary and ternary schemes, with load demands between 1.43 and 6,570,000 kWh/day (corresponding to an irrigation system and 275,000 households respectively). ii. Residential and buildings prevail as main applications for smallmedium systems. These applications encourage the PV/FC combination as they enable the installation of PV panels in roofs or facades. iii. Remote areas without grid access are the most studied ones for large-scale schemes. Wind turbines and panels are recommended for large loads such as islands, cities, or detached residential communities providing a more continuous electricity supply. However, their production highly depends on air density, rotor height, or turbulent flows caused by obstacles and other surrounding buildings.</p>
        <p>iv. The location impacts the final optimal configuration by reducing system size for those that have abundant renewable resources available. Besides, in locations with similar RES potential, increasing energy storage capacity reduces final PV or WT dimensions. v. For similar load demands and locations, the use of ternary systems reduces RES and storage capacities in comparison with binary configurations. vi. The reduction of loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and the increase of renewable fraction (f RES ) and self-sufficiency ratio (SSR) enlarge the system size and investment needed. Reduced hydrogen roundtrip efficiencies (HRE) have the same impact on the configuration dimensions and economics. vii. Despite some publications undervalue hydrogen-related technologies CAPEX, off-grid renewable hydrogen-based strategies already present competitive LCOE in some cases with promising results in mid and long-term scenarios.</p>
        <p>Some simulations do not consider relevant variables, which effectively have a great impact on the system and the achieved LCOE. Indeed, the integration level and balance of plant (BoP) development also influence the final costs [163,164]. Therefore, the study of experimental systems marks the transition between theoretical simulations and the deployment of larger-scale projects, boosting RHS progress through real experiences. Therefore, Table 6 collects a list of publications analyzing lab-scale prototypes aimed at improving different parameters such as system performance, energy management strategies (EMS), or reliability and using the aforementioned classification criteria for theoretical studies.</p>
        <p>Most of the listed publications consider off-grid schemes to cover the load demand without using backup generators. Silva et al. [165] developed an experimental facility to power a remote microgrid at the Brazilian Amazon, while Marino et al. [166] compared conventional lighting and LED lamps to assess the system performance, potential size reduction, and the curtailed energy. Yunez-Cano et al. [167] integrated a PV/FC system with an electrolyzer and metal hydride storage tank to satisfy a mobile house demand in Mexico for an uninterrupted period of up to 2 days. In Cordiner et al. and Bartolucci et al. [171,172], telecom stations from different locations in Italy include a PV/FC system along with batteries for on-field trials. These systems operate with different energy management strategies to compare the PV utilization factor, hydrogen production, and FC energy flow to sort the best one for every location. The facilities include a vessel to store the hydrogen produced through water electrolysis at 30 bar (only 4 out of 9 locations have electrolyzer) and a bundle of bottles refilled externally at 200 bar to avoid electricity shortfalls and ensure supply continuity (in all the cases).</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the interaction in the electricity grid is of interest in terms of integration, required electronics, grid imports and exports, etc. In Carbone et al. [170] different load scenarios are considered to test and validate an experimental PV/FC plant for the campus lighting. Thus, the lighting modeled as a constant load works with two patterns: daylight load (load is activated from dawn to sunset) and nightlight load (load from sunset to dawn). Endo et al. [175] study a medium-scale containerized solution with TiFe-based metal hydrides storage in Japan, achieving a reduction of up to 99% on the thermal management operations of MH tanks. Furthermore, these improves the overall efficiency of the system (power-to-power/heat) up to 60% based on high heating value (HHV). Finally, Boulmrharj et al. [176] developed an mCHP experimental solution to increase energy efficiency in buildings, and Stewart et al. [174] evaluated different power dispatch strategies in the frame of the Ecological House project in Italy.</p>
        <p>Additionally, other reported articles have analyzed the influence of EMS in laboratories. For instance, Karami et al. [178] improved electronic controllers to maximize renewable penetration. Likewise, Alam et al. [169] used a PV and load emulator, small FC/electrolyzer systems, metal hydride storage tank (typically used in lab-scale plants due to the higher storage capacity in reduced volumes compared to pressurized vessels), sensors, and controllers to analyze the system dynamic response. The scheme implemented in Calderón et al. [180] monitors the power generation of the PV/WT/FC configuration; it registers hydrogen production and stores it in metal hydride cylinders. It also includes a programmable logic controller to adjust the EMS. Other lab-scale prototypes in Benlahbib et al. and Brka et al. [177,179] use power electronic sources to emulate RES and loads, testing variable load consumptions and different weather conditions.</p>
        <p>Several conclusions are obtained from the performed analysis:</p>
        <p>i. Prototype renewable hydrogen strategies are implemented in different applications such as lighting, residential, telecom stations, or laboratory benches. ii. Off-grid configurations prevail over grid-connected ones. The latter are considered in some publications to evaluate the integration of RHS in the electricity mix. Additionally, the early development of the prototypes implies the need for ancillary support in some off-grid schemes, for instance, hydrogen refilled externally. iii. The references gather on-field trials, where the prototype systems performance is assessed in the final location; or lab trials that use power sources to emulate loads and renewable production profiles along with the hydrogen-related technologies to develop the energy management strategy. iv. The evaluated lab-scale systems focus on technical development.</p>
        <p>The articles that analyze the economics reflect high LCOE, so larger-scale designs are required to overcome cost challenges.</p>
        <p>Reported CAPEX prices by international agencies, maturity level of main hybrid systems components and technology readiness level (TRL) of FC systems per stationary application.</p>

        <p>Table 7 collects several real implementations within the stationary sector that include both RHS and FC systems. The projects are divided according to their application in power systems (providing grid balancing services and energy injection), industrial (like steel plants, refineries, or wastewater treatment plants), residential and other applications (such as telecom stations, mountain huts, hospitals, and other facilities). These pilot plants are sorted from largest to smallest FC rated power inside each category, giving technical characteristics of the configurations.</p>
        <p>Although power systems and industrial pilot projects are not the targets of small-medium scale RHS due to the great quantities of hydrogen, heat and power involved within the process, projects like ELY4OFF have developed a scale prototype using PV panels and Proton Exchange Membrane FC (PEMFC) to provide the Aragonese Hydrogen Foundation facility with 100% green electricity [181][182][183]. Another relevant project is the BIG HIT [184][185][186], which implements a complete hydrogen supply chain using wind and tidal energy at the Orkney Islands in the north of Scotland. The generated hydrogen pursues different applications like electricity injection or heat and power generation for harbor buildings. The hydrogen produced on one island is stored and distributed using ferries and trucks between the islands. Both projects have been funded by the FCH JU.</p>
        <p>Industrial systems like SOFCOM [187,188] or ECOELECTRICITY [189] use biogas and syngas obtained within daily activities of a WWTP and a biomass plant respectively. Therefore, FC systems are implemented to get heat and power for their processes.</p>
        <p>Regarding residential applications, installing a hybrid system in a single housing or a remote residential community differs from the integration possibilities in a city. Thus, the studied projects have been divided into projects funded by public programs, and projects from private companies and individual end-users.</p>
        <p>Projects funded by public programs (like the aforementioned FCH JU) are making efforts to develop micro-cogeneration units (mCHP) to get heat and power. Using different fuels, these units obtain hydrogen to provide households with heat and power with overall efficiencies over 90%. CALLUX [190] and ENEFIELD [191][192][193] set the basis of this technology in Europe with over 1000 units deployed during the project lifetime, while PACE [194,195] continues with the commercial roll-out and installation of more than 2800 units. According to these projects, the wide deployment of mCHP units in Europe will potentially avoid 62 billion € in grid reinforcement. In Japan, the ENEFARM program [196,197] has installed over 270,000 mCHP systems between 2009 and 2018, with activities still ongoing to achieve 5.3 million units by 2050. Within this project, several manufacturers are developing increasingly efficient units ranging between 0.7 and 250 kW.</p>
        <p>Finally, the REMOTE project [73,198,199] combines different RES (PV, WT, hydraulic, and biomass) with hydrogen systems. Originally, the project was aimed at providing energy to 4 micro-grids in different locations in Europe: north and south Italy, Norway, and Greece covering load demands from residential loads available on-site to industries or small-medium enterprises (SMEs). However, following the recent outgoing of two Italian partners, the two demonstration projects in Italy have been discarded and replaced by a new pilot project in the Canary Islands (Spain) for the energy supply of a farm.</p>
        <p>Additional R&amp;D activities on RHS arise from private companies or end-users interested in developing case studies. Their main objective is achieving 100% clean electricity and heat consumption within the demonstrative daily operation. For instance, the PHI SUEA HOUSE project [200] in Thailand or SOCIAL HOUSING in Vagarda (Sweden) [201,202] belong to different residential communities with PV/FC in two very different locations. Other projects aim at becoming more efficient and independent through the combination of PV panels, geothermal energy via heat pump, FC, and different ESS, for buildings self-consumption in combination with passive refurbishment measures applying the NZEB concept [203]. This is the case of a private villa in Gothenburg (Sweden) [204] that employs PV/Geo/FC systems, with 144 kWh Li-ion batteries and 324 kg of hydrogen stored for short and seasonal storage respectively.</p>
        <p>Besides, the HYDROGEN HOUSE PROJECT accounts for a 40 kW PV facility in combination with 20 kW of hydrogen FC and batteries [205]. Although it began as a private initiative in New Jersey (USA), currently, it belongs to a public partnership and focuses on education. In 2020, the project started the second phase, substituting the FC for a more developed one with 4-6 kW rated power and the lead-acid battery bank by a Li-ion one. WT and geothermal energy, along with high-pressure storage tanks were also added.</p>
        <p>Similarly, hydrogen is a very interesting option to cover fully or partially the load demands from critical infrastructures like hospitals, remote facilities, data centers, or even to provide electricity in shows. This is the objective of the EVERY WH2ERE project [206,207] which provides energy in shows through transportable gensets with FC and stored hydrogen.</p>
        <p>The power supply of telecom stations is also crucial nowadays. Therefore, they have been the subject of different studies aimed at avoiding energy shortfalls. FCpoweredRBS [171,172,208,209] uses a PV/FC system to ensure supply continuity, while ONSITE [210] proposes a containerized solution of FC and batteries. NH34PWR project [211] has designed a novel concept FC compact solution that obtains hydrogen from ammonia in developing countries. Likewise, mountain huts-related projects like SUSTAINHUTS [212,213] and COL DU PALET [214,215] use binary systems based on hydropower and PV respectively to partially cover huts load demand.</p>
        <p>Concerning large-scale configurations with FC nominal capacities over 100 kW, many projects focus on coupling wind farms (onshore and offshore) and PV parks with electrolyzers for bulk hydrogen generation. Projects like NORTH2 aim at producing 800,000 T/year of hydrogen deploying a PEM electrolyzer with a 3-4 GW offshore wind farm in the Netherlands. The electrolyzer will be placed in a decommissioned drilling platform [216]. In Saudi Arabia, 4 GW wind and PV park along with electrolysis will produce 650 T/day of green hydrogen which will be converted into ammonia to end markets globally and then converted back to hydrogen [217].</p>
        <p>Otherwise, we focus on the complete hybridization or in the standing FC systems providing grid and power services. In South Korea, Gyeonggi Green Energy FC park is powering 140,000 households each year and recovering heat for district heating using a Molten Carbonate FC (MCFC) [218]. Likewise, the Daesan Green Energy FC plant supplies electricity for 160,000 houses with a Phosphoric Acid FC (PAFC) [219].</p>
        <p>Due to land availability restrictions, FC systems are usually hybridized with WT or a PV/WT combination with grid service purposes.</p>
        <p>HAEOLUS project proposes a solution to store hydrogen and cover the heat and power demands of a microgrid in the Norwegian Arctic [220,221]. Similarly, the DON QUICHOTE project [222,223] harvests energy from an MW-sized PV/WT plant and feeds an electrolyzer to generate hydrogen, which is compressed up to 350 bar for storage. Then, the PEMFC injects the generated electricity.</p>
        <p>However, there is a changing trend concerning industrial systems, with current and future projects aligned with the utilization of waste streams with high hydrogen content or hydrogen as a by-product of the target finished goods to get heat and power for industry and even for grid injection [224].</p>
        <p>Accordingly, projects like CLEARgen DEMO [225,226] or POWER-UP [227] benefit from waste hydrogen within refinery activities to power their plants. DEMOSOFC [228][229][230][231][232] and SOFCOM [187,188] projects use biogas or even produce bio syngas with CCSU from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Another alternative for these WWTP is to employ regenerated water to produce green hydrogen in combination with renewables. This is the case of a future project in Spain that will use regenerated water to obtain hydrogen using PV and biogas as renewable resources [233].</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, large-scale hybrid systems are good opportunities for the industrial sector. For instance, GRINHY2.0 [234,235] introduces a novel rSOFC with a PV/WT plant supplying the electricity and the heat obtained. Waste steam from the steelmaking factory is used for rSOFC working on electrolyzer mode. On the contrary, when running on FC mode, the rSOFC generates heat, power, and oxygen for the process, as well as electricity for grid injection.</p>
        <p>The amount of integrated large FC systems in the residential and building sector is continuously growing. Through projects like ELEC-TROU [236] which is going to deploy a multi-MW FC system to power supply Kings Cross neighborhood in London, the residential sector aims at cutting carbon emissions mainly associated with heat needs. Abbreviations: HD (Hydraulic), Bio (Biomass), ALK (Alkaline), AEM (Anion Exchange Membrane), CHP (Combined Heat and Power), MCFC (Molten Carbonate FC), PAFC (Phosphoric Acid FC), DMFC (Direct Methanol FC), rSOFC (Reversible SOFC). a Thermal rated power.</p>
        <p>Additionally, private buildings like HARTFORD HOSPITAL [237] or MORGAN STANLEY OFFICES in New York [238] already opt for large FC systems to decarbonize their energy consumption. Conversely, other projects aim at injecting hydrogen into the natural gas grid, achieving this way greater hydrogen blending or installing dedicated hydrogen networks with the corresponding GHG reduction. This is the case of the GREEN HYSLAND project in Mallorca (Spain) [239], where 16.4 MW PV plant and 10 MW EL will be coupled to produce green hydrogen to be blended into the natural gas grid. Besides, specific hydrogen pipelines are going to be installed to supply an industrial state, hydrogen filling stations, etc., enabling 100% green hydrogen generation and distribution to end-users.</p>
        <p>This project, along with BIG HIT [184][185][186] or PHI SUEA HOUSE PROJECT [129] belongs to the HYDROGEN VALLEY PLATFORM [240] that has been created by Mission Innovation global initiative [241] in collaboration with FCH JU [242] to enable a large-scale deployment.</p>
        <p>With an investment of over 30 billion €, the platform collaborates globally to implement hydrogen-related facilities, creating green hydrogen supply chains and infrastructures for different economic sectors. Likewise, the manufacturer Toyota has recently announced the Woven City project [243], a "living laboratory" boosted by renewable energies (mainly PV) and hydrogen fuel cells at the base of Mountain Fuji in Japan. This city provides a real sustainable environment for 2000 inhabitants based on RHS systems for both stationary and transport.</p>
        <p>The most relevant outcomes obtained through the evaluation of pilot projects are: i. Small-scale systems are the main selected alternative for residential and buildings, where micro-cogeneration FC units are being boosted due to lower complexity and space requirements. ii. Medium-scale schemes contribute to the decarbonization of micro-grids, residential communities, and other remote applications using renewable hydrogen-based schemes. iii. Large-scale pilot projects focus on the decarbonization of the electricity grid and industrial applications using multi-MW fuel cells to get heat and power and benefiting from waste streams with high hydrogen content. The waste heat produced can be used for district heating or within industrial processes.</p>
        <p>Small-medium scale commercial devices focus on combined heat and power FC systems for residential, commercial, and other buildings, being mainly fuelled by natural gas, LPG, or biofuels. These solutions are easier to integrate and more compact than RHS alternatives, which need extra room to place PV panels, wind turbines, or storage tanks. Now, they involve high capital investments despite the declining trend experimented in the last decade [15].</p>
        <p>Hence, micro-cogeneration appliances aim at securing capital expenditures similar to conventional natural gas or propane boilers for both PEMFC and SOFC-based systems at 2030 [65]. Additionally, countries like Germany or Japan are partially subsidizing both hybrid systems and mCHP, boosting their use among users [46,201]. Suppliers like BDR Thermea, Bosch, Sunfire, or Viessmann through ENEFIELD and PACE projects [49], or Toshiba, Panasonic, Denso, Fuji, and Kyocera through ENEFARM [196,197] have developed a wide variety of compact solutions for different load requirements.</p>
        <p>On the contrary, renewable hydrogen-based configurations imply higher requirements than mCHP, being necessary to purchase renewable generators (usually PV panels) and hydrogen chain technologies separately, but they are facing a decreasing trend in CAPEX thanks to their development. Some companies are creating tailored hybrid-RES solutions. For instance, Home Power Solutions has created PICEA, a compact solution that integrates the hydrogen chain (FC, electrolyzer, and tank) to be coupled with an externally installed renewable source [261]. It also includes compression up to 300 bar, batteries, and heat storage in a water tank. Similarly, the Australian company LAVO has developed a hydrogen battery system with hydrogen storage in metal hydride tanks with an autonomy of 40 kWh and a peak power of 5 kW [262]. Besides, SOLENCO POWER BOX [263] consists of a reversible-SOFC for a compact mCHP running on hydrogen with solar energy.</p>
        <p>Other manufacturers like BALLARD, TOSHIBA, or PLUG POWER have created FC systems like FCgen-H2PM [264], H 2 ONE [265], or PLUG POWER GENSURE [266] for off-grid and backup applications. Additionally, recent reports analyze the possibility of combining low enthalpy heat pumps with numeric control and hybrid systems to provide both heat and power for buildings taking advantage of high efficiencies from heat pumps and reducing the investment needed [267].</p>
        <p>From the hybridization point of view, the focus of large-scale commercial systems is on grid balancing services where PV and wind farms can harvest huge amounts of energy. These facilities involve other considerations like more advanced BoP, utilities and process automation, power supply, electronics, and bigger stacks [268]. Thus, the analyzed pilot projects aim at lowering CAPEX, OPEX, and contingencies costs for wide deployment. Both MW-scale fuel cell and electrolyzer capital expenditures are targeted at 1500 and 400-800 US$/kW respectively [65]. Alkaline electrolyzers are the most developed ones, followed by PEM-based ones that are being employed for capacities beyond 10 MW. Besides, solid oxide electrolyzers are still under development with promising efficiencies reported. Similarly, PEMFC has broader market uptake, with a higher lifetime than alkaline fuel cells. Additionally, reversible-SOFC is being researched to reduce the infrastructure and equipment needed as it can be run in both electrolyzer and fuel cell modes.</p>
        <p>Several companies are creating large-scale FC systems with rated powers over 100 kW based on different FC technologies: PAFC, MCFC, SOFC, and PEMFC [49]. For instance, Bloom Energy agreed with Apple to provide a 4 MW biogas-fuelled FC and 16 MW of rated PV capacity along with battery storage for 100% self-sufficiency in a new campus in California [269,270]. The manufacturer Doosan FC received the order to build a 30.8 MW FC system to cover the heat and power demands of a residential complex in South Korea [271]. Likewise, FC Energy installed 5.6 MW FC capacity at Pfizer's facility in Connecticut [272].</p>
        <p>Therefore, large-scale hybrid-RES systems with improvements in efficiency, reliability, and cost-competitiveness are paving the way toward carbon neutrality by 2050.</p>
        <p>The implementation of RHS for stationary sector power supply needs to consider factors beyond techno-economic ones to ensure their feasibility. Despite the particularities of small, medium, and large-scale systems, cross-cutting boundaries are impacting different applications, being some of them also shared with the transport sector. Therefore, Table 8 collects and sorts these barriers in the legal framework, environmental impact, infrastructures, safety, and social factors.</p>
        <p>Moreover, it gathers actions and milestones from general to particular and whose target is removing barriers for every analyzed impact factor. These proposed solutions arise from blocking factors evaluation and include specific information from different projects, international agencies, policymakers, and stakeholders related to stationary applications.</p>
        <p>Reducing GHG emissions forces human beings to find feasible and reliable RES. Despite growing trends on renewables deployment, their intermittency leads to uncertainties, requiring energy storage systems to smooth the power variability. Thereby, hydrogen has been recognized as a versatile alternative to traditional ESS for large-scale decarbonization of different economic sectors. In particular, the stationary sector (power generation, industry, residential and buildings, and backup systems) represents a major source of CO 2 emissions in the world.</p>
        <p>This extensive framework has raised the current status and different challenges that lie ahead for the broader implementation of RHS in the stationary sector through the examination of published studies, relevant pilot projects and commercial devices available in the market. Besides, additional constraints are identified to enable a low-carbon scenario in the mid to long term.</p>
        <p>Theoretical publications show the prevalence of mature RES (PV and WT) in combination with hydrogen chain technologies as a reliable and cost-competitive alternative to fossil fuel-based generation schemes. Levelized cost of energy, loss of power supply probability, selfsufficiency ratio, hydrogen roundtrip efficiency, and renewable fraction are the most relevant techno-economic parameters analyzed within theoretical studies, having a major impact on the renewable hydrogenbased configuration.</p>
        <p>Lab-scale prototypes offer interesting information on the development of energy management systems and integration methods focusing on RHS performance and dynamic response to fluctuations through onfield and lab trials. Nevertheless, these schemes still reflect economic drawbacks, so larger-scale projects are required to minimize LCOE. Accordingly, countries like Japan or Germany are deploying smallscale mCHP units through pilot projects running on natural gas or LPG to decarbonize urban areas. These units are cost-effective, without needing additional room for components, but they achieve limited reductions of CO 2 emissions. Conversely, RHS are suitable for mediumscale applications and single-family households where the economy of scale dumps the investment and reduces the payback time. Besides, large power generation designs and industrial pilots reduce curtailed energy levels and leverage waste streams with high hydrogen content to generate synthetic fuels or to obtain heat and power for their plants respectively.</p>
        <p>The current market trend reveals the utilization of mCHP devices by end-users and future prospects aimed at equipment upgrading and upstream decarbonization of power systems and industrial facilities with hydrogen re-electrification and blending in natural gas networks. Additional progress on the efficiency of the alternative configurations, the BoP, and capital expenditures constitute a turning point for the economic feasibility. Thus, the improvement of energy management systems will increase the direct use of RES and its integration within the hydrogen chain. Moreover, the mass production and the modularity of fuel cells, electrolyzers, and compressors will contribute to decreasing the total cost of ownership and the investment required as already proved with other technologies such as PV panels. This mass production will require the substitution of expensive noble metal-based catalysts by new non-PGM materials that achieve a good trade-off between durability, stability, and mass transport [285].</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, hybrid systems require focused, consistent and specific policies to establish a solid legal framework to create a robust hydrogen infrastructure, which considers aspects like storage needs or</p>
        <p>Stationary RHS barriers and proposed actions.</p>
        <p>Legal and policy framework [273][274][275] -No specific regulatory and legal framework applicable to hydrogen as an energy carrier. -Lack of supporting policies for RHS.</p>
        <p>-Identification of current legislation and gaps to be covered. -Promote large green hydrogen generation and blending through tax exemptions.</p>
        <p>-Integrate green hydrogen into refineries carbon intensity calculations.</p>
        <p>-Create a guarantee of origin certifications for green hydrogen and electricity from RHS.</p>
        <p>-Subsidies for RHS in the residential and buildings sector.</p>
        <p>Environmental impact [276][277][278] -95% of total hydrogen production comes from fossil fuels (SMR and by-product from chlorine production). -RES broad deployment is associated with land restrictions and impacts on the biosphere. -Location with great RES potential may have water availability restrictions.</p>
        <p>-Large-scale implementation of RHS to cut GHG emissions and avoid acidification associated with fossil fuels-based hydrogen and energy generation. -Hydrogen-RES hybridization to reduce RES land employment.</p>
        <p>-Promote hydrogen storage as it represents a lower footprint than pumped hydro, batteries, or compressed air facilities. -Recover water produced during FC operation in evaporation columns. Use regenerated water from wastewater treatment plants. Create specific standards for proper water management.</p>
        <p>Infrastructures [279][280][281] -Lack of transport, distribution, and storage infrastructure. -Limited access and availability to hydrogen in residential and buildings. -Low hydrogen blending percentages allowed.</p>
        <p>-Invest in R&amp;D to enhance infrastructure efficiency.</p>
        <p>-New hydrogen storage methods like metal hydrides for small-medium scale systems.</p>

        <p>a Includes hydrogen obtained through steam methane reforming. b Includes solar thermal collector (STC).</p>
        <p>2 with a cost of 400$/kW. Under these hypotheses and considering the extra energy needed to split hydrogen from metal hydrides, an electricity cost of 0.11$/kWh is achieved, reducing the investment threefold. Furthermore, it is reflected a reduction in the number of PV panels from 205 million to 151 million units and in the wind turbines from 8000 to 1540 generators. Therefore, hybrid configurations demonstrate economic feasibility in the mid-term for larger energetic demands.</p>
