        <p>Geothermal energy is going to play a key role in future smart energy systems. Geothermal-driven domestic energy systems, specifically, will largely contribute to the baseload supply of heating and cooling demand of societies. A low-temperature geothermal resource is considered to drive a domestic-scaled multi-generation system supplying power, heating, and cooling. The proposed cogeneration system includes a small-scale organic Rankine cycle (ORC), a single effect LiBr-H2O absorption chiller, and heat exchangers to supply domestic space heating and hot water. The waste heat of the ORC is harvested, also, to be used in space heating. Energy, exergy, economic, and sustainability principles are applied to the system to evaluate the system thermodynamic and thermos-economic performance. Results associated with the exergy destruction are obtained and effects on the system performance of chiller supply are investigated. Besides, the thermodynamic performance of the system is evaluated under the summertime and wintertime conditions. Under the base condition, the generator employed in the absorption chiller is found to be the most exergy destructive unit followed by the evaporator utilized in the ORC. Furthermore, results revealed that by increasing the chiller supply rate, the system sustainability index enhances from 1.6 to 2.5 while the system's first law efficiency reduces.Geothermal energy is going to play a key role in future smart energy systems.

        <p>Over the past decade, utilizing renewable resources for domestic applications has received an increasing attention. Amongst others, geothermal is a reliable, clean, and sustainable renewable energy source that has been widely used for domestic heating since 1892 in Boise, Idaho, USA [1].Over the past decade, utilizing renewable resources for domestic applications has received an increasing attention.

        <p>Using geothermal resources for domestic heating seems to be a promising technology in Turkey as many successful projects have also reported in this regard [2]. Turkey has a considerable geothermal potential mainly due to its geographical location in the tectonically-active Alpine-Mediterranean Belt [3]. As reported by Turkey's energy agency, the geothermal potential is employed in several local sectors to the extent of 1150 MWe electricity production, and 1033 MWt direct heat generation as well as 1005 MWt in balneology, 820 MWt in greenhouse heating, 420 MWt in the hotel industry (mainly as heating), 42.8 in heat pump application and 1.5 MWt in food drying [4]. However, more attention should be paid to utilizing such energy sources in the domestic application according to Turkey's Vision 2023 energy policy. Indeed, through the widespread exploitation of geothermal resources and other types of renewables, it is possible to make a cleaner energy mix, achieve a better economy, and get higher sustainability degrees [1,5]. Besides, compared to other renewables, geothermal resources not only operate with a relatively higher capacity factor (&gt; 80%) but also play an important role in reducing CO2 emissions and other negative environmental footprints [6]. The following literature review presents some of the most recently published papers in the field of application of geothermal energy in the multi-generation energy systems.Using geothermal resources for domestic heating seems to be a promising technology in Turkey as many successful projects have also reported in this regard [2].

        <p>Advanced exergy and exergoeconomic analysis for a cogeneration system operating in a geothermal cascade are studied by Ambriz-Díaza et al. [7]. The examined multi-generation system was able to supply the power output of 40 kWe, a cooling effect of 175.8 kWf, and 30 kWt of useful heat for dehydration. Soltani et al.

An overview of relevant technologies at the industrial level, such as site identification, power production methods, and direct use was provided in this study. A multigeneration system was proposed by Alirahmi et al.

It was shown that the exergy efficiency of the system could reach 29.95% under the optimum condition. Soltani et al. [10] presented a general overview of geothermal heating and cooling systems. Recognition and accommodation of several factors were addressed and discussed in that study, which could enhance the design and implementation of any geothermal heating or cooling system. Ratlamwala et al.

        <p>The examined system was capable of producing 6.776 kW power and 33.743 g per hour hydrogen with solar radiation of 1000 W/m 2 . Authors in [12] suggested a new configuration of district heating system fueled with natural gas while being equipped with a deep geothermal resource. The main aim was to utilize geothermal energy in existing conventional gas-fired district heating systems to upgrade them thermodynamically and economically. Their findings showed that using geothermal sources could increase the system exergy efficiency and heating cost by about 12 and 25%, respectively, while reduce natural gas consumption by about 54%. Deployment of geothermal energy sources in Turkey was studied in [13] from sustainable development point of view. In the same study, more attention was paid to greenhouse gas emission releasing from Turkey's coal power plants. In this way, the potential of geothermal resources located in Turkey was considered in carbon capture and storage systems implementation. The optimization of parallel distribution between domestic heat and electricity supplying via geothermal energy was studied by Marty et al. [14] where a sensitivity analysis was also carried out using the source condition. Thermodynamic enhancement of the Irem binary power station located in Germencik, Turkey was performed in [15] by employing an ORC considering different working fluids. In the same work, it was demonstrated that the optimum ambient temperature corresponding to the maximum exergy efficiency is 18.5 °C. [16] proposed a system operating with a heat pump to supply the heating required for a city with a population of around 25000 and analyzed it thermodynamically and economically using 12 different working fluids in their case studies. Their simulation results indicated that if the number of residence increase, the net present value of the system would increase dramatically.The examined system was capable of producing 6.776 kW power and 33.743 g per hour hydrogen with solar radiation of 1000 W/m 2 .

        <p>Advanced exergoenvironmental analysis of geothermal district heating in the Afyon region was carried out by Yürüsoy and Keçebas [17]. Results revealed that the environmental degradation of the designed system is much lower compared to the traditional heating systems (wood-fired) and special attention should be paid to heat exchangers enhancement. Bursa geothermal district heating was analyzed thermodynamically by Yamankaradeniz [18] using advanced exergy principle. The main aim was to enhance the system performance via identifying the interactions among the components. Results of this study revealed that the conventional and advanced exergy efficiencies are around 0.25 and 0.26, respectively, and the priority of enhancement of system components was heat exchangers followed by installed pumps. Researchers in [19] considered not only geothermal resource thermophysical condition, but also physical, and geochemical features of the wells in power plant selection in Turkey. A special attention was on the non-condensable gases existing in the geothermal resources which affect the type of power plant (binary, flash or combined binaryflash). Supplying the heating and cooling demand of the Aarhus University Hospital via solar assisted system was studied by Arabkoohsar and Andresen [20]. It was shown that during the summer the considered system could contribute around 30% to the heat preparation procedure of the chiller unit. Moreover, payback period of almost 2 years verified that the system is economically feasible in practice.Advanced exergoenvironmental analysis of geothermal district heating in the Afyon region was carried out by Yürüsoy and Keçebas [17].

        <p>As observed from the reviewed literature and to the author's' best knowledge, there exists no standard configuration of a CCHP system to handle the most efficient use of geothermal sources. In addition, two main gaps were recognized in the literature. First, CCHPs have not been studied in depth for domestic purposes using a specified geothermal source for both summer and winter conditions. Second, most of the presented studies have addressed a specific operating point which makes it difficult to generalize the obtained results. The present study considers both mentioned gaps and gives a novel contribution to the field of geothermal energy usage for domestic applications via driving CCHPs. Therefore, in the present study, a domestic-scaled geothermal driven CCHP system is proposed and analyzed in detail using thermodynamic principles. B10 well in the Izmir-Balçova geothermal field [21] is considered as the source. Part of the geothermal fluid runs the ORC and produces space heating, while the rest drives an absorption chiller and then produces domestic hot water. The condenser of the ORC is also coupled with special heat exchangers to harvest the waste heat of ORC and contribute to space heating. Several working fluids are utilized in the ORC simulation and optimal operating points of the ORC and chiller are obtained. Exergoeconomic analysis is done to evaluate the economic feasibility of the system by calculating the payback period. In addition, exergy destruction within different components is obtained to measure efficiency along the process while a sustainability index is defined to evaluate the system from a sustainable development point of view. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed in detail to find the effects of the chiller supply and geothermal source condition on the system performance.As observed from the reviewed literature and to the author's' best knowledge, there exists no standard configuration of a CCHP system to handle the most efficient use of geothermal sources.

        <p>According to the previously mentioned facts about the importance of improving the share of utilizing geothermal sources in domestic applications in Turkey, this project proposes the employment of a specific geothermal well available in the Izmir-Balçova geothermal field (IBGF) to produce domestic heating, cooling, and electricity. Table 1 outlines some of the available details of the IBGF for the well numbered B-10. This well is selected as the case study in the simulation due to its appropriate temperature for domestic purposes. A simplified schematic diagram of the proposed geothermal driven CCHP system is indicated in Fig. 1. The presented cogeneration system consists of a small-scale ORC, an absorption chiller providing desired cooling and heat exchangers to deliver hot water and required heat for space conditioning. Regarding the layout selection and components employment it should be noticed that the energy source temperature is the first determinative parameter. Simple ORC and single effect absorption chiller seem to be the most appropriate selection for this range of energy source. ORC is a completely developed and mature technology and has a wide application in the cases with lowmedium temperature energy sources. Besides, compared to steam cycles, ORCs have enough flexibility, operate in lower pressure levels and have lower operating/maintenance costs [22][23][24][25]. In the presented system, geothermal fluid runs both ORC, via evaporation organic fluid within the ORC evaporator, and chiller via water vaporization within the generator. Under the base condition, half of the water is fed to run the ORC and the rest passes through the chiller. Evaporated organic fluid flows to the ORC turbine (ORCT) to turn the turbine blades and generate electricity via a coupled generator to the turbine shaft. Expanded organic working fluid enters the heat exchanger 1 (HE1) to heat the pressurized water, which delivers domestic space heating, and leaves it in a saturated liquid condition. In fact, HE1 performs as a wet condenser for the ORC harvesting waste heat of the ORC to use as domestic space heating. Finally, the employed pump (ORCP) increases the fluid pressure up to the ORCE pressure level and completes the ORC cycle. The ORCE exiting geothermal water is warm enough to provide domestic space heating so its heat content is transferred to the pressurized water to be utilized as domestic space heating. Another part of the geothermal fluid is used to run the chiller unit. [26] district cooling systems based on absorption chillers can bring significant socio-economic benefits in the hot and humid climate regions. Within the chiller unit, water and lithium bromide (LiBr) perform as refrigerant and absorbent, respectively. A solution of refrigerant (H2O) and absorber (LiBr) exists within the absorber, while the absorber absorbs the refrigerant content.According to the previously mentioned facts about the importance of improving the share of utilizing geothermal sources in domestic applications in Turkey, this project proposes the employment of a specific geothermal well available in the Izmir-Balçova geothermal field (IBGF) to produce domestic heating, cooling, and electricity.

        <p>Afterthought, a pressure increasing process takes place for the combination of water and lithium bromide (strong solution). Then, this strong solution passes through the employed heat exchanger (SHE) and reaches the generator. Within the generator, the temperature of this solution increases and causes water content evaporation, which flows to the condenser. Meanwhile, the weak solution is fed back to the absorber while it absorbs the exiting refrigerant from the evaporator again. Lastly, Gen exiting geothermal fluid enters the HE3 to supply demotic hot water demand.Afterthought, a pressure increasing process takes place for the combination of water and lithium bromide (strong solution).

        <p>Before conducting the sustainability analysis, it should be highlighted that sustainable development has been defined in different ways, but the most frequently used definition refers to "a development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" [52]. In fact, sustainability assessment is an index of sustainable development [53] which emphasizes the efficient use of energy sources with the lowest energy loss values. In this regard, sustainability and exergy analysis are highly correlated to each other which in turn help to define the sustainability index as follows [54,55]:Before conducting the sustainability analysis, it should be highlighted that sustainable development has been defined in different ways, but the most frequently used definition refers to "a development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" [52].

        <p>To obtain the energy and exergy values accessible in the geothermal resource and corresponding to different source temperature, thermophysical properties of material available within the 
            <rs type="software">EES</rs> software [60] are utilized. A specified mass flow rate of 75 m 3 /h is also considered for the candidate source. Hereby, the accessible energy and exergy content of the source refers to the difference between energy and exergy of the geothermal source associated with the source and ambient temperatures. Table 6 is listed energy and exergy content of the geothermal water for different resource temperatures. To validate the obtained results, the data reported in the literature is used [61]. Since a simple ORC is employed in the proposed CCHP, the validation is performed for the simple ORC as studied in [61], comprehensively. In [61], a simple ORC is utilized to produce electricity from a specified geothermal resource. Exergy destruction within the ORC components is compared under the same conditions, while databases utilized for the working fluid's thermophysical properties in both studies are the listed data in the library of the EES. To evaluate the performance of the employed ORC and absorption chiller two key parameters exist, namely ORCE pressure level and Gen temperature. Since the thermodynamic implementation of the ORC and absorption chiller affects the whole system performance, optimum values of ORCE pressure and Gen temperature are obtained. Referring to Fig. 2, generator operating temperature of 353 K leads to a maximum coefficient of performance (COP) for the chiller unit. Thereby, this value is supposed to be the generator temperature for the rest of the simulation. Then maximizing net produced power by the ORC higher pressure is justified. Referring to Fig. 4, utilizing different working fluids has no considerable effect on the maximum output power. This is while the optimum pressure corresponding to the maximum power for the case of R123 is much lower than those of other cases. Thereby, R123 is chosen as the working fluid in the rest of the results. The same results have been shown by Alrahimi et al. [62], comparing the performance of R123 with nine different refrigerants. Table 8 outlines the properties of R123 as the selected working fluid.

In this section, it is supposed that 50% of the geothermal resource is utilized to run the ORC and half of the water is supplied to drive the absorption chiller and produce domestic hot water. However, simulations are done for different values of chiller supply rate (mass flow rate ratio between streams 1 and 2) and results will be presented in the following. Temperature and volumetric flow rate of 373 K and 75 m 3 /h, respectively, is considered for the geothermal source. Also, ORC and absorption chiller perform under the optimized condition from the net produced power and COP points of view, respectively. Referring to the same table, the proposed system generates 116.3 kW electricity with ORC thermal efficiency of 6.8 %. It should also be highlighted that the delivered SPH via heat exchanger 1 is completely considerable (1590 kW). This value of heating is recovered from nonusage energy of the ORC condenser. EUF as the overall thermal efficiency of the proposed multigeneration system is obtained to be 55.9 %. Also, overall exergy efficiency and payback period of 49.6% and 4.6 years are obtained, respectively. Other parameters like mass flow rate of heat carrying fluids are also reported in table 9, which are determinative parameters for heat exchanger designers.

        <p>The breakdown of exergy destruction within the entire system is shown in Fig. 5. The main exergy destructive unit is the generator implemented in the absorption chiller mainly due to the water content evaporation within this unit and causes 24% of total destroyed exergy. Following the same analysis, the employed evaporator in the ORC is the second exergy destructive component and 21% of total destroyed exergy is due to irreversibilities within this component. Apparently, destroyed exergy in this component happens due to the temperature mismatch between hot and cold streams (see Fig. 3). The third important component that is involved in the exergy destruction is heat exchanger 2 with 19% of total exergy destruction. Exergy destruction results reveal that these three components are the sources of almost 64% of total exergy destruction. Therefore, to enhance the exergetic performance of the entire system, any improvement for the mentioned components is highly recommended. The exergy efficiency of the system components is presented in Fig 6 . Components with the lower second law efficiency are always matters of concern meaning that any improvement in their exergetic performance could increase the system exergy efficiency. As can be seen, the lowest exergy efficiency belongs to the heat exchanger 2 followed by heat exchanger 1. It is worth mentioning that both heat exchangers 1 and 2 have a lower exergy efficiency compared to the heat exchanger 3. This is because entering geothermal fluid to these heat exchangers is relatively low temperature and has low exergy. Therefore, transferring low quality energy to pressurized water stream in these heat exchangers leads to lower exergy efficiency. T-Q diagrams of heat exchangers are illustrated in Fig. 7. Here, Q is defined as the ratio of the transferred heat at each position to the total transferred heat in the heat exchanging device. Better temperature matching of the streams in a heat exchanging device leads to lower exergy destruction. This is clear since temperature difference is one of the main irreversibility sources. In the diagrams presented in this figure, temperature mismatching between cold and hot streams reveals the irreversibility within the heat exchanger and more difference between hot and cold streams temperature glide results in more exergy destruction.The breakdown of exergy destruction within the entire system is shown in Fig. 5.

During the entire year, exergy efficiency of the system varies between 40.6 and 53.46 %. heating is relatively intensive and has more effect on the EUF behavior. As mentioned before, heat delivery for space heating demand occurs in two stages, harvesting waste energy from the ORC condenser and energy recovery from the geothermal reinjection. Thus, decreasing the mass flow rate of geothermal water which runs the ORC has a significant effect on the delivered space heating. Geothermal source volumetric flow rate  Geothermal source temperature Fig. 8 illustrates exergy efficiency of the proposed geothermal-driven CCHP plant under the base condition.

Also, it is worth noting that the range of considered geothermal source temperature and the volumetric flow rate is taken out from real data for the Izmir-Balçova geothermal region.

        <p>In fact, a change in the geothermal flow rate varies all the products of the system (electricity, heating, and cooling) and input energy to the system as well. These changes take place in such a way that the ratio of products to the input energy (as a definition of energy utilization factor) remains constant. As the figures show, unlike the geothermal flow rate, source temperature has a remarkable effect on system performance. Referring to these figures, increasing source temperature weakens the system thermodynamic performance and sustainability. When the source temperature rises from 368 to 378 K the EUF,  and SI parameters reduce from 56.22%, 51.74, and 2.07 to 55.38%, 48.01, and 1.93, respectively. This is while the products of the proposed geothermal-driven CCHP system in terms of energy and exergy should be increased in cases of operating with warmer geothermal fluid. The key point is increasing the available energy and exergy in the geothermal source by increasing its temperature. In fact, the slope of the variation in the available energy and exergy in the geothermal source with a change in the source temperature is more intensive than those related to the system products (see Fig. 15). In other words, the effect of increasing the rate of input energy/exergy to the system is more the effect of increasing the rate of energy/exergy associated with the system products. Therefore, decreasing the energy and exergy performance of the system with increasing source temperature can be justified. flexibility. Consequently, it is decided to evaluate the performance of the proposed CCHP plant for both summertime and wintertime conditions. Besides, the base technical assumptions (listed in Table 1) are considered to be the same for both cases with geothermal temperature and volumetric flow rate of 373 K and 75 m3/h, respectively. Also, it is considered that during the cold days space heating demand reaches its maximum amount, while there is no space heating demand for hot days of the year. Then, during the summertime, harvested heat from the HE1 (condenser of the ORC) will be wasted without any usage and HE2 will not be operated. Moreover, it is assumed that during the hot days of the year there is still a requirement for domestic hot water. This is while, for the cold days of the winter, geothermal water does not pass the chiller (i.e., required space cooling is assumed zero), and the proposed CCHP system turns into a CHP plant (see Fig. 16). Under this condition, a variable demand for domestic hot water is considered. The maximum value of hot water production means zero power and space heating production, while minimum hot water production reflects the maximum power production and space heating as well. The results of the simulation for both hot and cold days are listed in Table 11. During the cold days, supplied heating for space conditioning (with a considerable value of energy and exergy) comes into account in the thermal and exergetic performance of the designed system.In fact, a change in the geothermal flow rate varies all the products of the system (electricity, heating, and cooling) and input energy to the system as well.

The system was designed to supply power (as electricity consumption), heating (for both space heating and domestic hot water) and cooling (for space cooling). A set of real data was utilized as the geothermal source condition and B10 well in the Izmir-Balçova region was considered as the source candidate. The idea was developed mainly since developing renewable-based, especially geothermal-driven, energy systems are attracting more attention day by day in developing countries like Turkey. To this end, a configuration for the electricity, heating and cooling production was proposed and a detailed energy and exergy analysis was accomplished. In addition, a parametric study was carried out to show the effect of any change in the decision parameters on the system performance. Furthermore, the designed multi-generation system was modeled for both summer and winter days' conditions.In this study, a geothermal driven CCHP was proposed and analyzed in detail using thermodynamic and sustainability principles. The system was designed to supply power (as electricity consumption), heating (for both space heating and domestic hot water) and cooling (for space cooling). A set of real data was utilized as the geothermal source condition and B10 well in the Izmir-Balçova region was considered as the source candidate. The idea was developed mainly since developing renewable-based, especially geothermal-driven, energy systems are attracting more attention day by day in developing countries like Turkey. To this end, a configuration for the electricity, heating and cooling production was proposed and a detailed energy and exergy analysis was accomplished. In addition, a parametric study was carried out to show the effect of any change in the decision parameters on the system performance.

        <p>Absorption chiller and ORC were optimized regarding the generator temperature and evaporator pressure level, respectively. Under the optimized condition for these units, obtained results proved that a second law efficiency of almost 60% is reachable for the proposed domestic-scaled CCHP, while almost all of the geothermal fluid is utilized for domestic cooling and hot water production (no power production). Through numerous case studies, the most exergy destructive components were recognized, destruction within each main component was estimated and it was found that, under the base condition, Gen and ORCE are the most exergy destructive components with 24 and 21% of entire exergy destruction within the system, respectively. It was also shown that increasing the ORC supply is not a good idea from the exergy efficiency point of view (unlike energy efficiency). However, it should be noticed that not only electricity is extremely more valued in most of the European energy markets, but also their heat sectors are to be occupied with efficient electricity-driven technologies, e.g. heat pumps. Therefore, employing an ORC to increase the share of electricity in the proposed geothermal-driven CCHP is highly recommended. In addition, based on the sensitivity analysis, it was observed that any changes in the geothermal source volumetric flow rate would not have any significant effect on the system sustainability and thermodynamic performance while increasing source temperature from 368 to 378 K could reduce the energy efficiency from 56. 22Absorption chiller and ORC were optimized regarding the generator temperature and evaporator pressure level, respectively.
