        <p>This study aims to explore the relationship between renewable energy consumption, non-renewable energy consumption, carbon dioxide emissions and economic growth in China, India, Bangladesh, Japan, South Korea and Singapore using panel Augmented Mean Group (AMG) estimation techniques over the period 1975-2020. The results of the analysis show that renewable energy consumption, non-renewable energy consumption, employed labor force, and capital formation contribute significantly to long-run economic growth. The study also found that non-renewable energy consumption significantly increased long-term carbon emissions, while renewable energy consumption significantly reduced long-term carbon emissions. GDP and GDP 3 have a significant positive impact on environmental degradation, while GDP 2 has a significant negative impact on environmental degradation, thereby validating the N-type EKC hypothesis in selected emerging economies. The countrywise AMG strategy records no EKC in India and Bangladesh, an inverted U-shaped EKC in China and Singapore, and an N-shaped EKC in Japan and South Korea. Empirical evidence from the Dumitrescue-Hurlin (2012) panel causality test shows that there is a two-way causality between renewable energy consumption and economic growth, supporting the feedback hypothesis. Strategically, empirical evidence suggests that higher renewable energy is a viable strategy for addressing energy security and reducing carbon emissions to protect the environment and promote future economic growth in selected Asian countries.This study aims to explore the relationship between renewable energy consumption, non-renewable energy consumption, carbon dioxide emissions and economic growth in China, India, Bangladesh, Japan, South Korea and Singapore using panel Augmented Mean Group (AMG) estimation techniques over the period 1975-2020.

        <p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have increased substantially by 88% over the past decade, from 25 million kilotons (MKT) in 1990 to 40.84 million kilotons (MKT) in 2020 (World Bank, 2020). The energy crisis and the problems of exacerbating carbon dioxide emissions are embroidered. Non-renewable energy consumption resources such as natural gas, coal and oil are considered to be the main culprits of environmental pollution and global warming (Gyamfi et al., 2021;Usman et al., 2022). The construction of sustainable energy through geothermal energy, solar energy, biomass energy and wind energy is considered to be the basic premise for the sustainable adjustment of total consumption (Assadi et al., 2022;Rahman and Velayutham, 2022). Economic development relies heavily on energy use considered in the era of denationalization and globalization, especially in emerging economies (Ghauri et al., 2021;Zhao, 2021). Industrial growth, output growth, income generation and employment creativity across the economy rely heavily on large amounts of renewable and non-renewable energy sources (Chen et al., 2021;Zahid et al., 2021). Sustainable energy is considered to have many qualities, and the enthusiasm for sustainable energy is due to the continued rise in carbon emissions leading to global ecological imbalances and rising temperatures. Over the past few decades, various researchers have contributed to the literature on energy consumption, growth, and sustainability.Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have increased substantially by 88% over the past decade, from 25 million kilotons (MKT) in 1990 to 40.84 million kilotons (MKT) in 2020 (World Bank, 2020).

        <p>The link between pollution and per capita growth is the main hypothesis of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). Ecological pollution rises with the expansion of economic growth until it exceeds the peak level, accepted the climax of this phenomenon by Ouyang et al. (2019); Khan et al. (2020); Adedoyin, Alola and Bekun (2020); Wawrzyniak and Doryń (2020). Pollution levels increase rapidly as the country develops, but after reaching the Kuznett U-curve turning point, pollution begins to decline. This empirical evidence fundamentally holds a firm grasp on the use of renewable energy and the country's structure. As suggested by Tang, Peng, and Xu (2018), productive and efficient use of energy consumption is an essential determinant of growth. The literature presents multiple panel studies, but ignores panel selections on the same theme in Asian emerging countries, China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, India and Bangladesh. However; Liu, Kong, and Zhang (2021) reveal that in 5 selected emerging Asian countries (China, Japan, South Korea, Mongolia, and Russia), disaggregated energy (non-renewable and renewable) and urbanization increase long-term CO2 emissions, while economic growth reduces long-term CO2 emissions. Similarly, another study by Chapman, Fujii, and Managi (2018) selected a panel of Asian emerging countries (China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Mongolia, and Russia) and found that economic growth boosted carbon dioxide emissions in South Korea and China, decreased in North Korea and Russia, and moderately increased in Mongolia and Japan. Thus, correlating the results of this study with the aforementioned studies is one of the main aims of this study. Emerging Asian countries (China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, India and Bangladesh) were selected as the main targets for 40% of their total energy consumption and 43% of their carbon emissions. Given the rising cost of imported energy, energy consumption is gradually becoming the focus of attention. Demand for fossil fuels has increased in selected emerging Asian countries over the past 40 years, particularly China, South Korea and Japan, which are the largest single contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, carbon dioxide emissions and other sources. Figure 1 identifies the GDP growth of selected emerging Asian economies, clearly showing that Japan has the highest GDP growth rate, while India and Singapore have the lowest growth rates in 2020. As shown in Figure 2, among the emerging Asian economies panel in 2020, South Korea has the highest carbon emissions and Bangladesh the lowest. India has the highest renewable energy usage in 2020 and Singapore the lowest, as shown in Figure 3. In 2020, China is the country with the highest consumption of non-renewable energy, while Singapore is the country with the lowest consumption in the emerging Asian countries panel, as shown in Figure 4.The link between pollution and per capita growth is the main hypothesis of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC).

        <p>This study has a dual goal: investigating the renewable and nonrenewable energy consumption and growth nexus is at the forefront of research. The association intends to view economic growth as an increase in total output dependent on renewable and non-renewable energy sources, with more of this two energy consumption being the determinants of higher growth. Thus, the causal relationship between renewable and non-renewable energy consumption and growth may be a unique contribution to the existing literature, as most early studies have looked at the link with total energy consumption. The second part of this study explores the interrelationship between renewable and non-renewable enenregy consumption and carbon emissions. This relationship clearly shows whether renewable energy consumption and non-renewable energy consumption contribute to or reduce carbon emissions in selected countries. The third part of the study estimates the linkage between economic growth and carbon emission. Finally, the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) theory can be tested for the selected emerging Asian countries covering the 1975-2020 data range.This study has a dual goal: investigating the renewable and nonrenewable energy consumption and growth nexus is at the forefront of research.

        <p>Given the prominence of growth and renewable energy consumption prospects, it is crucial to dynamically grasp the interconnections between renewable energy consumption, nonrenewable energy consumption and economic growth. This association may contribute to the literature on sustainable energy futures and energy economics. Thus, the main contributions of this study are as follows: (i) There is a lack of studies identifying the differential impact of renewable and non-renewable energy consumption on growth, while most of the earlier studies looked at the link between total energy consumption and growth. This disaggregation opens avenues for understanding the relative potential of the two energy sources for the growth process. (ii) This will be the first study on emerging Asian countries whose latest data draws crucial insights for regional policymakers. (iii) This study addresses the potential omission of variable bias in the multivariate framework by adding three dimensions of renewable energy, non-renewable energy consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions to the production functions of neoclassical capital and FIGURE 2 CO2 emissions as a percentage of total energy consumption, expressed in metric tons of carbon emissions.Given the prominence of growth and renewable energy consumption prospects, it is crucial to dynamically grasp the interconnections between renewable energy consumption, nonrenewable energy consumption and economic growth.

        <p>The real fountain of energy and growth is natural resources; however, the fundamental factor measuring growth is the consumption of renewable and non-renewable energy (Xia &amp; Zhang, 2019). Ambec et al. (2020) call on environmental economists to explore research by trying to shed light on hypotheses about the energy-growth relationship. Along these lines, Bilgili, Koçak &amp; Bulut (2020), Yilanci et al. (2021), Shakeel (2021), Mighri and Ragoubi (2020), Ahmad et al. (2020a), Doğan, Balsalobre-Lorente and Nasir (2020) proposed four hypotheses (growth, feedback, conservation, and neutrality) in their seminal work on growth and energy hypothesis research. The causal link from energy to growth is a one-way causal relationship known as the growth hypothesis. In this context, growth in energy consumption is positively correlated with growth, which is likely to strengthen sustainable infrastructure and increase productivity. One-way causality from growth to energy consumption is the second conservation hypothesis. The third feedback hypothesis highlights the bidirectional causality from energy consumption to economic growth and from economic growth to energy consumption. In this case, a higher expansion or contraction of energy consumption corresponds to a gradual or weakening growth outlook, and conversely, an increase or decrease in growth may correspond to a decline or expansion of energy consumption. Finally, the absence of causality between the energy and growth relationship indicates a neutral hypothesis, implying that reducing or increasing energy use does not affect economic growth and vice versa. Balsalobre-Lorente and Leitão (2020) used panel fully modified least squares (FMOLS), fixed effects (FE) and panel dynamic least squares (DOLS) to estimate the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth in selected 28 EU countries over the data 1995-2014. The findings show that higher energy use significantly boosts economic growth in selected countries, supporting the growth hypothesis.The real fountain of energy and growth is natural resources; however, the fundamental factor measuring growth is the consumption of renewable and non-renewable energy (Xia &amp; Zhang, 2019).

        <p>Similarly, another study supporting the growth hypothesis by Topcu, Altinoz, and Aslan (2020) used a panel vector autoregressive (PVAR) approach to select 128 countries by income level over the period 1980-2018. Ndlovu and Inglesi-Lotz (2020) use data from 1996 to 2015 to explore causal relationships between renewable energy, non-renewable energy consumption, economic growth, and R&amp;D spending in the BRICS countries. The study findings indicate a unidirectional causality from Non-renewable energy consumption to economic growth in Brazil and South Africa, hence consistent with the growth hypothesis. Similarly, the studies supporting the growth hypothesis are Joshua, Uzuner and Bekun (2020).Similarly, another study supporting the growth hypothesis by Topcu, Altinoz, and Aslan (2020) used a panel vector autoregressive (PVAR) approach to select 128 countries by income level over the period 1980-2018.

        <p>The second strand of studies relating to the causal relation between growth to energy use is known as the conservative hypothesis. Banday and Aneja, (2019) applied the Bootstrap Dumitrescu and Hurlin panel causality test to discover the causal relationship between energy consumption and economic growth in the BRICS countries over the period 1990-2017. The findings suggest a one-way causality from economic growth to energy consumption in China, India, Brazil and South Africa. Umurzakov et al. (2020) used the Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) panel Granger causality test to examine the relationship between energy and economic growth in post-communist countries, covering data from 1995 to 2014. The results show that there is a one-way causal relationship from economic growth to energy consumption, which is consistent with the conservative hypothesis. Fan and Hao (2020) used annual data from 2000 to 2015 to investigate the relationship between renewable energy consumption, foreign direct investment, and economic growth in 31 provinces in China. The findings suggest that there is a unilateral causal relationship from economic growth to renewable energy consumption. Studies supporting the conservative hypothesis are Ahmed et al. (2022), Singh and Vashishtha, (2020), Munir, Lean andSmyth (2020), Sunde, (2020).The second strand of studies relating to the causal relation between growth to energy use is known as the conservative hypothesis.

        <p>The third hypothesis is feedback, reflecting that the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth is bidirectional. Chontanawat (2020) The neutral assumption involves an independent relationship between energy consumption and economic growth. Krkošková (2021) uses data from 2005 to 2019 to explore the relationship between energy consumption and real GDP in V4 countries. The study analysis found no significant relationship between Poland's energy consumption and real GDP, so the results fit the neutral assumption. Li and Leung (2021) estimated the interlinkage between renewable energy consumption and economic growth in seven European countries from 1985 to 2018. The results of the analysis support evidence of no causal relationship between renewable energy and economic growth in selected European countries.The third hypothesis is feedback, reflecting that the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth is bidirectional.

        <p>Vural (2020) found long-term cpintegration between renewable energy consumption, non-renewable energy consumption output, trade, and carbon emissions using a second-generation panel cointegration test in eight Saharan African countries during the period 1980-2014. Long-term variable elasticities show that a 1% increase in nonrenewable energy consumption expand carbon emissions by 0.09%, while a 1% increase in renewable energy consumption reduces carbon emissions by 0.015% in selected countries. Moreover, the analysis supports the validity of the EKC hypothesis for selected countries. Likewise, Destek and Sinha, (2020) used a second-generation approach to explore the validity of the EKC hypothesis for the ecological footprint of developing countries, covering the period 1980-2014. The results of the group mean method disregard the existence of the inverted U-shaped EKC hypothesis, but there is a U-shaped EKC relationship between ecological footprint and economic growth in the developing economies. Another recent study by Mahmood and Furqan (2021b) revealed an inverted U-shaped relationship between economic growth and CO2, thereby supporting the inverted U-shaped EKC hypothesis in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. Zhang, Yang, and Jahanger (2022) used updated fully modified (CUP-FM) and continuously updated bias-corrected (CUP-BC) estimators to test the validity of the EKC hypothesis for the top ten recipient countries of remittances during the period 1990-2018. The results of the analysis demonstrate the validity of the inverted U-shaped EKC hypothesis for selected countries. Jena et al. (2022) used an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model for panel estimation to test EKC validation in China, India, and Japan over the 1980-2016 data range. The recorded findings validate U-shaped EKCs in India and Japan, and an inverted U-shaped EKC in China. Moreover, Mahmood (2020a) explored an inverted U-shaped relationship between GDP per capita and CO2 emissions per capita, thereby validating the U-shaped EKC hypothesis for 6 of 21 North American countries.Vural (2020) found long-term cpintegration between renewable energy consumption, non-renewable energy consumption output, trade, and carbon emissions using a second-generation panel cointegration test in eight Saharan African countries during the period 1980-2014.

        <p>The above literature, despite having many panel studies, ignores panel selection on the same topic in emerging Asian countries, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Bangladesh, India and China. Furthermore, the literature rarely identifies causal relationships among disaggregated renewable energy consumption, non-renewable energy consumption, economic growth, and carbon emissions, and tests the validity of the EKC hypothesis in the proposed panel of emerging Asian countries.The above literature, despite having many panel studies, ignores panel selection on the same topic in emerging Asian countries, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Bangladesh, India and China.

        <p>Regarding the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth, two diametrically opposed views have been put forward in the existing literature. The first view that energy consumption has a weak relationship with aggregate output is based on neoclassical growth theory; instead, total production is largely determined by the development of labour, capital, and technology (DeMartino &amp; Grabel, 2020;Katzenstein, 2020). Even the Harrod Domar and Solow-Swan model did not consider energy as an input of production function. The Harrod Domar and Solow-Swan models do not even consider energy as an input to the aggregate production function (Ayres &amp; Warr, 2010;Rahman et al., 2022). Energy may be an important factor of production, a second point of view in the literature presented by Bamati and Raoofi (2020) and Zeqiraj, Sohag, and Soytas (2020). Energy, infrastructure, labour and capital as critical inputs determine the higher growth process (Krausmann et al., 2020;Nieto et al., 2020). Thus, following the work of Shah, Chughtai and Simonetti (2020), Lu et al. (2020), Chi et al. (2021), andHao et al. (2020), based on the notion that infrastructure, labour and capital are key inputs for economic growth. The theoretical basis of the model is based on the Cobb-Douglas production function, as follows.Regarding the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth, two diametrically opposed views have been put forward in the existing literature.

Thus, following the work of Shah, Chughtai and Simonetti (2020), Lu et al. (2020), Chi et al. (2021), andHao et al. (2020), based on the notion that infrastructure, labour and capital are key inputs for economic growth. The theoretical basis of the model is based on the Cobb-Douglas production function, as follows.</p>

The suggested model variable measurements and descriptions are explicitly highlighted in below. The renewable energy consumption (REC) can be measured for a particular year and country using two variables data, renewable energy consumption as a percentage of total final energy consumption and total energy consumption in kg of oil equivalent (Mtoe). Multiply the total energy consumption in kilograms of oil equivalent (Mtoe) by the renewable energy consumption as a percentage of total energy consumption and divide by 100 to get the renewable energy consumption in kilograms of oil equivalent (Mtoe).

        <p>Cross-sectional dependecy in panel data estimation techniques lead to biased regression analysis and inference. Thus, detecting cross-sectional dependencies in variable models of panel data is an important part of research analysis (Bilgili et al., 2020;Munir et al., 2020). Thus, this study applies the cross-sectional depednece test introduced by Pesaran, (2007) to explore cross-sectional correlation in panel data.

        <p>After establishing long-term panel cointegration, panel dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) and fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) may be the best options for determining longterm variable elasticity, but FMOLS and DOLS strategies ignore crosssectional dependencies (Rahman et al., 2021).

        <p>Although the coefficients estimated by the AMG estimation technique indicate long-term relationships in variable series, these tests cannot detect causal relationships between variables.

These results confirm the validity of the N-shaped EKC hypothesis in selected emerging Asian countries. The progressive impact of GDP on environmental degradation reflects the use of more non-renewable energy sources to expand production in selected countries, thereby deteriorating environmental quality. This result shows that after the level of economic growth reaches a certain threshold, the economy realizes that the environment can be protected by using renewable energy to increase productivity levels. The positive effect of cubed GDP on carbon emissions is due to the high demand for industrial goods in external markets, the failure of trade agreements and the environmental conditions for trade liberalization.

The effect of renewable energy consumption on carbon emission is significantly negative in all selected emerging economies. This means that renewable energy consumption reduces environmental degradation in these countries. The nonrenewable energy consumption coefficients in China, Japan, Bangladesh, India, Singapore and South Korea are significantly positive, indicating that non-renewable energy consumption contributes significantly to the carbon emissions of these countries.</p>
        <p>AMG estimation cannot detect causal relationships between variables. This study applies the recently introduced Dumitrescue and Hurlin (2012) panel causality test, which has two advantages over the traditional Granger causality test in examining causality between variables. The Dumitrescue and Hurlin (2012) panel causality test considers two dimensions of heterogeneity, heterogeneity of causality and heterogeneity of regression models, to examine for Granger causality. Following Koçak and Şarkgüneşi (2017), this study uses Monte-Carlo simulations to estimate probability values and test statistics. The Dumitrescue and Hurlin (2012) panel causality results are shown in Table 7, indicating that only renewable energy consumption and economic growth have a bidirectional causal relationship. The findings of the bidirectional causal relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth are in good agreement with the studies of Mukhtarov (2022), Xue et al. (2022), Chen et al. (2022), Wang et al. (2022b), Aslan et al. (2022), Mounir and Elhoujjaji (2022).AMG estimation cannot detect causal relationships between variables.

        <p>The results also show a one-way causality from capital formation to economic growth and from economic growth to carbon emissions across Northeast Asian countries. The result for one-way causality from capital formation to economic growth is very consistent with Topcu, Altinoz and Aslan (2020), Shahbaz, Song, Ahmad and Vo (2022). And the finding of one-way causality from economic growth to carbon emissions is very consistent with Doğan et al., 2020, El Menyari (2021), Adedoyin and Zakari (2020), Gao and Zhang (2021).The results also show a one-way causality from capital formation to economic growth and from economic growth to carbon emissions across Northeast Asian countries.

        <p>Table 8 reports the results for pairwise Granger causality for individual countries. The results show a bidirectional causal relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth in India, Japan, and South Korea. The causality test also showed one-way causality from capital formation to economic growth across all countries. The study also found that non-renewable energy consumption has a oneway effect on economic growth in China, Singapore and South Korea. In addition, the analysis points out a unidirectional causality from carbon emissions to economic growth in China and from economic growth to carbon emissions in India, Bangladesh, Singapore and South Korea. The use of renewable energy can boost economic growth, which in turn supports renewable energy adaptation in China, India, Bangladesh, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. The causal relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth is confirmed in selected emerging Asian countries, thus supporting the feedback hypothesis (Table 7). Country-by-country estimates show no causal relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth in Singapore, confirming the neutral hypothesis for Singapore. However, India and Singapore show bidirectional causality between renewable energy consumption and economic growth, thus supporting the feedback hypothesis. Furthermore, a one-way causality exist from economic growth to renewable energy consumption in China and Bangladesh, thus, supporting conservative hypothesis. Finally, there is a one-way causal relationship from capital formation to economic growth across all emerging Asian countries, consistent with the long-run results in Table 5.Table 8 reports the results for pairwise Granger causality for individual countries.

        <p>This study aims to estimate the interrelationship between renewable consumption, non-renewable energy consumption, economic growth and carbon emissions in selected emerging Asian countries (India, China, Bangladesh, Japan, Singapore and South Korea) for the period 1975-2020. This study addresses the potential omission of variable bias in the multivariate framework by adding three dimensions of renewable energy, non-renewable energy consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions to the production functions of neoclassical capital and labour. First, the study detects cross-sectional dependencies in variable models of panel data through the cross-sectional dependence test proposed by Pesaran, (2007). The results demonstrate crosssectional dependencies in the model. After analyzing the initial cross-sectional dependencies, the integral properties of each variable were examined using the cross-sectional enhanced Im-Pesaran-Shin (CIPS) unit root test proposed by Pesaran (2007). After determining the order of integration for each variable, this study examined the robustness of the estimated results by applying the Westerlund cointegration test, Pedroni (1999Pedroni ( , 2004) ) cointegration test and the Kao (1999) cointegration test.This study aims to estimate the interrelationship between renewable consumption, non-renewable energy consumption, economic growth and carbon emissions in selected emerging Asian countries (India, China, Bangladesh, Japan, Singapore and South Korea) for the period 1975-2020.

        <p>After establishing long-term panel cointegration, the Augmented Mean Group (AMG) method was applied to determine the long-term variable coefficient elasticity. Based on the first economic growth model, long-term parameter estimates suggest that each rise in non-renewable energy consumption, renewable energy consumption, and capital accumulation, respectively, contributes significantly to economic growth. The long-term elasticity estimate for renewable energy is 0.882, compared to just 0.659 for non-renewable energy, suggesting that renewable energy consumption has a much larger impact on growth than non-renewable energy. However, carbon emissions have significant adverse effects on economic growth. The second long-term estimation model is based on carbon emissions. An increase in non-renewable energy consumption leads to a significant stimulus in carbon emissions, and an increase in renewable energy consumption leads to a significant reduction in carbon emissions. According to the AMG method analysis, the signs of the coefficients of GDP and GDP 3 are significantly positive (GDP&gt;0, GDP 3 &gt;0), while GDP 2 is significantly negative (GDP 2 &lt;0), indicating that GDP and GDP 3 have a progressive impact on environmental pollution, while GDP 2 has a significant negative impact on environmental damage. These results confirm the validity of the N-shaped EKC hypothesis in selected emerging Asian countries. Country-wise estimation results by the AMG strategy are reported that renewable energy consumption and capital accumulation have significantly a positive impact on economic growth in India, China, Bangladesh, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Likewise, nonrenewable energy consumption had a significant positive impact on economic growth in all selected emerging Asian economies except Singapore, documenting that the positive impact of non-renewable energy consumption on economic growth is insignificant. Also the impact of employed labour force on economic growth is significantly positive in India, Japan, Bangladesh, China, South Korea and Singapore. However, the impact of carbon emissions on economic growth is significantly negative in all emerging economies except Japan, where the negative impact of carbon emissions on economic growth is insignificant. Country-wise estimates of the carbon-emission-based AMG strategy in the second model show that GDPs significantly stimulate carbon emissions in all selected emerging Asian countries. However, GDP 2 significantly reduced carbon emissions in China, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea, while in India and Bangladesh, GDP 2 significantly contributed to carbon emissions, thus validating the absence of EKCs in India and Bangladesh.

        <p>Given the results, policymakers must focus on increasing renewable energy production and consumption in emerging Asian economies, as renewable energy is a viable alternative to addressing the issue of environmental degradation and climate change without compromising economic growth. For energy security and sustainable economic growth, rapid replacement of non-renewable energy sources with renewable energy sources is critical. Hence to develop and simplify market access for renewable energy and capital-incentive technologies, policymakers must take appropriate steps and build the necessary publicprivate partnerships. These incentives and initiatives will stimulate cleaner and modernize the energy sector for sustainable economic growth.Given the results, policymakers must focus on increasing renewable energy production and consumption in emerging Asian economies, as renewable energy is a viable alternative to addressing the issue of environmental degradation and climate change without compromising economic growth.

        <p>Non-renewable energy consumption still contributes to economic growth in all emerging Asian countries except Singapore, so Singapore should reduce its use of non-renewable energy faster and more gradually than other countries in order to achieve environmental protection and economic growth goals. EKC validity has not been approved in India and Bangladesh, so these countries should shift their economic resources from non-renewable energy to renewable energy to protect the environment.Non-renewable energy consumption still contributes to economic growth in all emerging Asian countries except Singapore, so Singapore should reduce its use of non-renewable energy faster and more gradually than other countries in order to achieve environmental protection and economic growth goals.

        <p>Ignoring the heterogeneity characteristics among the selected emerging Asian countries is the main weakness of this study. Thus, a possible extension of this study is to divide the entire emerging Asian countries panel into different subsamples according to income level (i.e., low-, middle-and high-income countries). In addition, follow-up investigation may include other indicators of environmental degradation (greenhouse gas emissions, ecological footprint).Ignoring the heterogeneity characteristics among the selected emerging Asian countries is the main weakness of this study.
