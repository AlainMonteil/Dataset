        <p>In order to tackle the challenges related to selectivity, activity, overpotential and durability, transition metal-based catalysts have been widely investigated in the last decades. In an effort to bridge the gap between the fields of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, this review aims to survey the main strategies explored for the rational design of a wide variety of different metal catalysts, ranging from molecular systems to single-atom and nanostructured catalysts. Transition metal complexes containing heme and non-heme ligands have been selected to discuss the recent advances in the understanding of the structure-function relationship in molecular homogeneous catalysis as well as to summarize the main approaches proposed for the heterogenization or confinement of molecular catalysts on conductive surfaces. The main strategies to minimize catalyst cost are also presented, leading to atomically dispersed molecular-like M-N x moieties embedded on 2D conducting materials. The superior performances of single-atom catalysts (SACs) and the structural similarity with their molecular analogs, suggest that transition metal catalysts containing well-defined sites may be intrinsically more active and selective towards CO 2 conversion than the bulk heterogeneous materials. Finally, design approaches for metal nanoparticles (NPs) based on size, shape, and support tuning are summarized and compared to novel strategies based on the interaction with surface-bonded organic molecules. The studies herein presented show that the basic principles in molecular catalysis and organometallic chemistry can be effectively used to design new efficient and selective heterogeneous catalysts for CO 2 reduction.In order to tackle the challenges related to selectivity, activity, overpotential and durability, transition metal-based catalysts have been widely investigated in the last decades.

        <p>The dependence of anthropogenic activities on fossil fuels has contributed to a dramatic rise in the atmospheric CO 2 levels leading to severe environmental issues in our modern society, including global warming and serious pollution problems. 1 In this scenario, the implementation of technologies based on CO 2 utilization to produce carbonaceous fuels and commodity chemicals is highly desirable to drive the transition towards a new green economy. [2][3][4] Among the proposed approaches, the electrochemical conversion of CO 2 powered by renewable sources is an attractive sustainable alternative to the massive utilization of fossil resources. [5][6][7][8] It can occur at ambient conditions and the efficiency of the process can be potentially controlled by the applied bias. Furthermore, this strategy is compatible with an on-site production of a wide variety of organic C 1 -and C 2 -building blocks from a non-toxic, abundant and inexpensive greenhouse gas, mitigating the limitations related to their storage and distribution (especially for toxic gaseous products, like CO). 9 The electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) may undergo several multi-electron multi-proton pathways, leading to a wide range of carbon-based products. 10 Selectivity is therefore a major challenge in CO 2 RR, since competitive undesired CO 2 RR mechanisms and/or the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) may interfere with the formation of a specific product. Due to the extreme inertness and stability of the CO 2 molecule, both thermodynamic and kinetic barriers hinder an efficient electrochemical CO 2 activation. 11 In the absence of a catalyst, the direct outer-sphere single-electron reduction of CO 2 to form the CO 2 À radical anion is energetically demanding (E 0 = À1.90 V vs. NHE), mainly due to the high reorganizational energy required to bend the linear CO 2 molecule. 12 Protonassisted multi-electron steps generally lead to thermodynamically more favorable pathways. 13 A transition metal-based catalyst is often required to lower the activation barrier of the reaction and to drive the process at acceptable rates at specific potentials. The specific interaction of the catalytic metal center with H + /CO 2 or CO 2 RR intermediates is crucial to determine the selectivity of the overall process. 14 In addition, a proper kinetic control of the whole catalytic system is essential to achieve the desired selectivity, and factors such as the applied potential, the proton concentration in the reaction medium, and the solubility of CO 2 (e.g. about 0.03 M in common aqueous electrolytes, 0.31 M in CH 3 CN and 0.19 M in DMF 15 ) must be also carefully assessed. In the last decades, a plethora of transition metal-based catalysts have been reported for efficient CO 2 RR, ranging from molecular catalysts [16][17][18][19][20][21][22] to metal nanoparticles 23,24 and bulk heterogeneous materials. [25][26][27] In parallel, the increasing interest for in situ and operando microscopic and spectroelectrochemical (SEC) techniques applied to both, the homogeneous and heterogeneous systems has led to a strong improvement in the fundamental understanding of the factors governing the CO 2 RR process. [28][29][30][31][32] In spite of this, further improvement of the catalyst performance in terms of activity, selectivity and stability is highly desired to match the requirements for practical applications.The dependence of anthropogenic activities on fossil fuels has contributed to a dramatic rise in the atmospheric CO 2 levels leading to severe environmental issues in our modern society, including global warming and serious pollution problems. 1 In this scenario, the implementation of technologies based on CO 2 utilization to produce carbonaceous fuels and commodity chemicals is highly desirable to drive the transition towards a new green economy.

        <p>In this perspective, we aim to provide an overview of the major advances and trends in the broad field of the electrochemical CO 2 RR, covering the different explored areas from molecular catalysis to nanostructured materials. In addition to the conventional distinction between molecular and heterogeneous catalysts, here we will feature some innovative promising approaches to design novel hybrid catalysts for CO 2 RR with intermediate properties between molecules and bulk materials (Fig. 1). [33][34][35][36][37][38] A rational catalyst design primarily requires the elucidation of the structure-activity relationship. The present work will focus on the main reported strategies to control the structure, morphology and chemical composition at the atomic, molecular, supramolecular and nano levels, highlighting how these aspects affect the reactivity towards CO 2 RR. Some aspects related to the modeling of the electrical interface in a broader sense, such as the effect of the local pH, electrolyte or ionic strength will be also briefly discussed. [39][40][41] In the attempt to link molecular and heterogeneous systems, a recurrent topic will be the contribution from the fundamental principles of molecular catalysis and coordination chemistry to the design of new efficient materials with tunable activity and selectivity. To emphasize this concept, the CO 2 RR catalytic properties of molecular systems and materials containing active metal sites with structurally similar well-defined coordinative environments will be correlated to each other. Given the huge number of metal complexes reported over the last decades as efficient CO 2 RR catalysts, the discussion about molecular catalysis will be herein mainly limited to metal complexes containing heme (including metalloporphyrins and phthalocyanines) and non-heme (cyclam, cyclam-like and others) macrocyclic ligands as representative examples. There are several reasons supporting this choice. Firstly, they represent one of the most widely studied and relevant families of molecular catalysts reported up to date, being able to promote a highly efficient and selective CO 2 reduction to CO under electrochemical conditions. They also showed an extreme versatility and long-term durability as both homogeneous and supported catalysts, which make them very appealing systems for scale-up applications. From a fundamental perspective, the mechanistic understanding of the catalytic CO 2 RR for these systems possesses a solid experimental and theoretical basis, providing a broad overview for the critical assessment of structural effects in molecular catalysis, as well as of the strategies for heterogenization of molecular catalysts on solid electrodes. Furthermore, the active M-N 4 moiety of metalloporphyrinoid derivatives or non-heme macrocyclic complexes represents an ideal model to describe the active sites of several reported single-atom electrocatalysts for CO 2 RR. In this regard, we have also included a brief discussion about some representative examples of Ni, Fe and Co molecular catalysts containing non-macrocyclic tetradentate nitrogen ligands, which help us to establish a more intimate connection between the molecular and heterogeneous systems. It is worth reminding that several remarkable classes of molecular catalysts based on 1st/2nd/3rd row transition metals and non-heme ligands (polypyridyl, aminopyridyl, organometallic ligands, etc.) have been widely studied for efficient CO 2 RR to HCOOH or CO and comprehensively reviewed in recent works.

        <p>Following a traditional scheme, the transition metal-based catalysts for CO 2 RR are roughly divided into two main categories, corresponding to molecular and heterogeneous catalysts. In molecular catalysis, a well-defined active site is generally proposed, whereby a metal center is surrounded by a specific organic ligand framework (Fig. 1a andb). The coordination environment (first and second coordination sphere) of the catalytic site determines its electronic and steric properties, providing a specific catalyst-substrate interaction under given external conditions (solvent, pH, electrolyte). Thus, the control over the intrinsic activity and selectivity for CO 2 RR is achieved through ligand design by using conventional synthetic methods of organic/organometallic chemistry. [47][48][49][50] An accurate investigation of the mechanistic details of the catalytic reaction is generally obtained by using electrochemical and spectroscopic tools, leading to a deep understanding of CO 2 RR mechanistic details. Most of the reported molecular catalysts for CO 2 RR are capable to promote the two-electron (2e) CO 2 conversion to carbon monoxide (CO) or formic acid (HCOOH) with high efficiency and selectivity. On the other hand, clear examples of molecular systems able to produce more than 2e CO 2 RR reduction products are still rare. [51][52][53] Furthermore, molecular systems generally suffer from low current densities, which limit their implementation in real devices for scale-up applications.Following a traditional scheme, the transition metal-based catalysts for CO 2 RR are roughly divided into two main categories, corresponding to molecular and heterogeneous catalysts.

        <p>In sharp contrast, bulk heterogeneous catalysts usually contain a large number of poorly characterized active surface states, without a full structural control at the molecular or atomic levels (Fig. 1c). These aspects typically result in considerably higher current densities in comparison with the molecular systems, at the expense of a lower selectivity and a more difficult rationalization of the process. Nevertheless, although the HER is generally favored over CO 2 RR on several metal electrodes (e.g. Ni, Fe, Ti, Pt) in aqueous media, a number of transition metals have been shown to produce CO (e.g. Au, Ag, Zn) 54 or HCOOH (e.g. In, Sn, Cd) with high faradaic yields. 55 The product distribution is generally determined by the relative binding energies of adsorbed *CO, *COOH and *H intermediates (* indicates the adsorption site on the metal surface), which are strongly dependent on the metal's electronic structure (i.e. density of states). 10,[56][57][58] Weak *CO binding on the metal surface facilitates CO desorption and evolution (Au), whereas too large *CO adsorption energies are detrimental for CO 2 RR, leading to catalyst poisoning and a preference for HER (Pt). For intermediate *CO binding energies (e.g. Cu), *CO is not easily desorbed and undergoes further reductive and/or alternative chemical steps (protonation, coupling reactions) enabling the formation of the target 42e CO 2 RR products, such as hydrocarbons or alcohols. 14,[59][60][61][62][63][64][65] In the last years, the rigid dualism between molecules and heterogeneous catalysts has been gradually overcome through the investigation of novel families of materials with specific molecularly or atomically defined properties. As such, emerging classes of hybrid heterogeneous catalysts showed superior CO 2 RR performances than the molecular counterparts albeit preserving the integrity of the molecular catalytic site (Fig. 1). The main families of transition metal-based catalysts investigated by the current research in the CO 2 RR field can be summarized as follows:In sharp contrast, bulk heterogeneous catalysts usually contain a large number of poorly characterized active surface states, without a full structural control at the molecular or atomic levels (Fig. 1c).

The main families of transition metal-based catalysts investigated by the current research in the CO 2 RR field can be summarized as follows:</p>
        <p>Homogeneous molecular catalysts, which are typically organometallic complexes able to promote electrochemical CO 2 RR when dissolved in common organic electrolytes (CH 3 CN, THF, DMF, NMP). In this case, the catalyst is a molecule freelydiffusing in solution with a well-defined standard potential and acts as a redox mediator between the electrode and the substrate (Fig. 1a). In most instances, the real active species is electrogenerated in situ: when the applied bias matches the redox potential of the catalyst, the catalyst precursor gets reduced at the electrode surface forming the catalytic species which, in turn, reacts with the substrate with kinetics (k cat ) depending on its intrinsic activity and the external conditions (e.g. applied potential, medium). In homogeneous electrocatalysis, only a small fraction (confined in the diffusion layer) of the total amount of catalyst present in solution (EmM concentration) is directly involved in the catalytic process. The catalytic behavior can be accurately studied by electrochemical (cyclic voltammetry) and complementary in situ spectro-electrochemical methods (UV-Vis, FTIR, EPR, Raman) to identify the main intermediate species involved in the process. In some cases, the reaction intermediates can be even chemically synthesized and isolated. Homogeneous catalysts are ideal candidates to investigate the catalytic CO 2 RR mechanism at a fundamental level, but deactivation pathways occurring in solution or on the electrode surface affect their longterm stability.Homogeneous molecular catalysts, which are typically organometallic complexes able to promote electrochemical CO 2 RR when dissolved in common organic electrolytes (CH 3 CN, THF, DMF, NMP).

        <p>Heterogenized molecular catalysts, whereby the catalytic species no longer diffuses in solution but is immobilized on the electrode, thus improving the electrical contact between the electrode and the catalyst at the interface (Fig. 1b). 45,66,67 Although a number of water-soluble molecular catalysts for CO 2 RR have been reported so far, [68][69][70][71] the electrode functionalization approach allows to overcome the solubility limitations in aqueous electrolytes often reported for homogeneous catalysts (most of them are soluble in organic solvents or organicwater mixtures), and helps to facilitate the catalyst recycling and the separation of liquid CO 2 RR products. Moreover, the physicochemical interactions at the catalyst-electrode interface may induce drastic reactivity changes, including altering the conventional reaction pathways occurring in the homogeneous phase. In this perspective, the fundamental understanding of these factors would represent a powerful tool to tune the reactivity, activity and selectivity of molecular catalysts. The heterogenized electrocatalysts consist of thin films containing a number of active sites (10 À7 -10 À12 mol cm À2 ) which is highly dependent on the catalyst loading and the deposition method. The strategies used for molecular catalyst immobilization can be divided into three main classes: (1) electropolymerization, which leads to the formation of electroactive polymer films with high surface densities and porosity. 72 Depending on the number of voltammetric cycles, a precise control over the thickness and surface coverage may be obtained; (2) covalent attachment to the surface through the presence of different functional groups (amino, diazonium, thiol, carboxylic acids, etc.), which typically entails the formation of robust films with low surface coverage (E10 À10 -10 À12 mol cm À2 for a monolayer); 73,74 (3) immobilization via non-covalent (p-p stacking) interactions, which generally provides higher catalyst densities (E10 À8 mol cm À2 ) but also a less controlled surface functionalization. 75 In analogy with the homogeneous case, surface spectroscopic techniques are used to gain mechanistic insight into the catalytic process. Low catalyst loading, partial catalyst detachment during operation, poor electrochemical contact and the need for elaborated synthetic strategies are the main limitations of classical functionalization methods.Heterogenized molecular catalysts, whereby the catalytic species no longer diffuses in solution but is immobilized on the electrode, thus improving the electrical contact between the electrode and the catalyst at the interface (Fig. 1b). 45,66,67 Although a number of water-soluble molecular catalysts for CO 2 RR have been reported so far, [68][69][70][71] the electrode functionalization approach allows to overcome the solubility limitations in aqueous electrolytes often reported for homogeneous catalysts (most of them are soluble in organic solvents or organicwater mixtures), and helps to facilitate the catalyst recycling and the separation of liquid CO 2 RR products.

        <p>Reticular 3D materials, in which the active molecular unit is encapsulated into porous organic or metalorganic ordered architectures with tunable structure and properties. Among them, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), metal organic frameworks (MOFs) or porous supramolecular assemblies are versatile platforms used to significantly improve the robustness of a catalyst under electrochemical conditions. In principle, the combination of the characteristic physical properties of MOF and COF materials (e.g. high surface area, adjustable pore size) with suitable integrated molecular building blocks enables to fine-tune their activity and selectivity for CO 2 RR. 33 However, an accurate control over the thickness of the layers grown on the electrode is essential to optimize the electron and mass transport properties of the material and, therefore, to maximize the efficiency of the process. 76 Furthermore, the catalytic performance of these materials is typically limited by an inefficient charge carrier mobility, which leads to slow electron kinetics. In this regard, imine-based COFs have shown enhanced electronic properties, improving the electrical connection between the active sites of the layered material. [77][78][79] Moreover, in comparison with conventional heterogenization methods, the imine (or amine) groups contained in the microporous matrix, together with its specific porous morphology favor the capture of CO 2 , leading to an increase in the local CO 2 concentration at the catalytic sites (especially in aqueous media). [80][81][82] Homogeneous, heterogenized and reticular systems can be defined as molecular materials, since the metalorganic active site preserves its fundamental structural and electronic properties at a molecular level even after the heterogenization process. 83 Single-atom catalysts (SACs), a rapidly emerging unique class of materials bridging the molecular and heterogeneous catalysis fields. In SACs, transition metal atoms are atomically dispersed on a 2D support and stabilized through the coordination to heteroatom (usually N, C, P or S) dopants. Indeed, the active sites are homogeneously distributed on a conductive surface, mimicking the coordination environment of molecular complexes. This feature enables an accurate structural characterization of the catalyst at an atomic scale and, at the same time, maximizes the number of free coordination sites per metal atom. Unlike the molecular materials, the SACs are generally obtained by thermal treatment of generic metal precursors (inorganic salts) and heteroatom-rich organic molecules which, depending on the synthetic conditions, give rise to isolated molecular-like surface units. A challenge from this approach is however to demonstrate that in fact only SAC motifs are available on the as prepared samples (as opposed to a mixture of single atoms and small clusters or nanoparticles) as well as the difficulty of keeping such SAC motifs stable under reaction conditions. Doped carbon-based materials are generally used as suitable supports for SACs, due to their high specific surface area and tunable surface properties.Reticular 3D materials, in which the active molecular unit is encapsulated into porous organic or metalorganic ordered architectures with tunable structure and properties. Among them, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), metal organic frameworks (MOFs) or porous supramolecular assemblies are versatile platforms used to significantly improve the robustness of a catalyst under electrochemical conditions. In principle, the combination of the characteristic physical properties of MOF and COF materials (e.g. high surface area, adjustable pore size) with suitable integrated molecular building blocks enables to fine-tune their activity and selectivity for CO 2 RR. 33 However, an accurate control over the thickness of the layers grown on the electrode is essential to optimize the electron and mass transport properties of the material and, therefore, to maximize the efficiency of the process. 76 Furthermore, the catalytic performance of these materials is typically limited by an inefficient charge carrier mobility, which leads to slow electron kinetics. In this regard, imine-based COFs have shown enhanced electronic properties, improving the electrical connection between the active sites of the layered material. [77][78][79] Moreover, in comparison with conventional heterogenization methods, the imine (or amine) groups contained in the microporous matrix, together with its specific porous morphology favor the capture of CO 2 , leading to an increase in the local CO 2 concentration at the catalytic sites (especially in aqueous media). [80][81][82] Homogeneous, heterogenized and reticular systems can be defined as molecular materials, since the metalorganic active site preserves its fundamental structural and electronic properties at a molecular level even after the heterogenization process. 83 Single-atom catalysts (SACs), a rapidly emerging unique class of materials bridging the molecular and heterogeneous catalysis fields. In SACs, transition metal atoms are atomically dispersed on a 2D support and stabilized through the coordination to heteroatom (usually N, C, P or S) dopants. Indeed, the active sites are homogeneously distributed on a conductive surface, mimicking the coordination environment of molecular complexes. This feature enables an accurate structural characterization of the catalyst at an atomic scale and, at the same time, maximizes the number of free coordination sites per metal atom. Unlike the molecular materials, the SACs are generally obtained by thermal treatment of generic metal precursors (inorganic salts) and heteroatom-rich organic molecules which, depending on the synthetic conditions, give rise to isolated molecular-like surface units. A challenge from this approach is however to demonstrate that in fact only SAC motifs are available on the as prepared samples (as opposed to a mixture of single atoms and small clusters or nanoparticles) as well as the difficulty of keeping such SAC motifs stable under reaction conditions.

        <p>On the basis of the accurate elucidation of the CO 2 RR catalytic mechanism of the parent system and the extreme versatility of the porphyrin moiety, in the last decade numerous efforts have been directed to the rational design of novel iron porphyrin-based catalysts. In particular, a number of studies have focused on the correlation between the electronic and steric effects of different substituents on the porphyrin ring and the CO 2 RR activity of the catalyst (Chart 1). The substituent effects can be divided into two categories, defined as through-structure and through-space effects, respectively (Fig. 3 and4). 47,109 The former term mainly refers to the use of mesomeric or inductive effects promoted by electron-withdrawing or electron-donating substituents to modify the electronic structure of the catalyst. 110,111 To investigate the influence of the through-bond inductive effect on CO 2 RR, the electrochemical behavior of the unsubstituted FeTPP compound (1) was systematically compared with a series of Fe tetraphenylporphyrins, containing different degrees of substitution with perfluoro (2-4) and o,o 0 -methoxy meso aryl groups (5) (see Chart 1 and Fig. 3). 110,112 The correlation between the catalytic rate (defined as maximum turnover frequency or TOF max ) and the standard redox potential of a catalyst (E 0 cat ) enables a rational evaluation of the electronic substitution effect on the catalytic performance within the same family of molecular catalysts. [113][114][115][116][117] The analysis of the inductive effects in the series 1-4 gives rise to a linear scaling relationship, which highlights two opposite trends (Fig. 3a, right): for electronwithdrawing groups, the positive impact on the E 0 cat is partially balanced by lower catalytic rates, as a consequence of a diminished nucleophilicity of the Fe 0 center. In turn, electron-donating substituents tend to enhance the reactivity of the catalytic center at the expense of a less favorable catalytic potential. In other words, considerations solely focused on electronic effects (i.e. the so-called ''redox innocence'' and ''non-innocence'' of the ligand frameworks 89 ) leave little room for the optimization of the catalyst.On the basis of the accurate elucidation of the CO 2 RR catalytic mechanism of the parent system and the extreme versatility of the porphyrin moiety, in the last decade numerous efforts have been directed to the rational design of novel iron porphyrin-based catalysts.

        <p>The modeling of through-space interactions between specific residues in the second or outer coordination sphere and the metal center may activate alternative mechanistic pathways for a catalytic reaction, giving rise to new scaling relations. This strategy represents a powerful tool for catalyst optimization and has been effectively used in molecular catalysis to circumvent the tradeoff between rate and overpotential forced by the scaling relationships observed with substituents displaying bare inductive effects. 112,118,119 A first common approach consists in the use of local proton sources or H-bond donors on the porphyrin moiety. Depending on the specific spatial orientation of the pendant groups, they may induce a strong boosting effect on the CO 2 reduction catalysis, due to a stabilization of the Fe-CO 2 adduct by intramolecular H-bonding and/or an increase of the local concentration of proton donors. For instance, the introduction of eight phenolic functionalities in ortho, ortho 0 positions of the porphyrin phenyls (6) led to a dramatic enhancement of the catalytic properties of 1, resulting in a durable and selective CO production (FE CO = 94%, FE H 2 = 6%) at À1.16 V vs. NHE (Z = 0.466 V) in DMF/0.1 M NBu 4 PF 6 + 2 M H 2 O. 120 It clearly outperformed the corresponding methoxy derivative (5), thus unambiguously confirming the crucial role played by the prepositioned OH groups in 6 on CO 2 RR. The latter act both as intramolecular proton relays, facilitating the successive protonation and C-O bond cleavage steps, and as H-bonding stabilizers of the primary Fe-CO 2 intermediate formed between the electrogenerated formal Fe 0 and CO 2 . As a consequence of the additional H-bonding stabilization induced by the pendant hydroxyl groups, catalysis requires a second electron uptake after the Fe-CO 2 adduct formation, which is more difficult than the first one, unlike for the unsubstituted FeTPP catalyst (1, Scheme 1). 87,98,102 In the case of the catalyst 6, the second electron transfer, required to close the catalytic cycle, was suggested to be concerted with the breaking of one of the two C-O bonds of CO 2 and with proton transfer. 87 A combination of the inductive and spatial effects may lead to catalysts with superior activity. As an example, the perfluorination of two opposite phenyl rings of 6 gave rise to the catalyst 7 with improved CO 2 RR performances. 121 The choice for a suitable reaction medium is another crucial aspect to consider for catalyst optimization. 122,123 An asymmetric tetraphenylporphyrin iron catalyst 8 containing only a single proton relay revealed to be a poor CO 2 RR catalyst in DMF, whereas a strong enhancement in the catalytic response was observed in CH 3 CN. 122 In an attempt to mimic the key stabilizing role of amino acid residues by H-bonding interaction in enzymatic systems, a number of varying H-bond donor groups have been incorporated in the structure of iron porphyrin complexes. 99,[124][125][126][127] The effect of different hanging proton donors (phenol (9), guanidine (10) and sulfonate (11) groups) at a dibenzofuran scaffold has been explored in a series of iron hangman porphyrins. 124 Although an excellent selectivity to CO was obtained in all three cases (FEs 4 93%), the CO 2 RR catalytic rate was found to follow the 9 4 10 4 11 order, highlighting the detrimental effect of the deprotonated pendant sulfonate group on catalysis due to unfavorable electrostatic interactions. While the hanging guanidine group in 10 could potentially mimic the role played by arginine in several CO 2 binding proteins, 128 it was found to interact via H-bonding more favorably with the porphyrin platform than with CO 2 , resulting in a minor activity of 10 in comparison with 9. Recently, Chang and co-workers have systematically investigated a series of four positional isomers (12-15) with amide functionalities in the ortho-or para-positions of the meso phenyl ring, exploring the effect of both proximal and distal N-H configurations with respect to the porphyrin platform. 125 CO 2 reduction analysis revealed that the presence of the amide group in the ortho position is required to observe a significant increase in CO 2 RR activity, with the distal isomer (14) being the most active across the series. This resulted from a more favorable spatial location of the amide group which leads to an enhanced H-bonding stabilization of the Fe-CO 2 intermediate. The presence of local urea functional groups, able to establish multipoint H-bonding with the metal-bound CO 2 molecule, was reported to have an even stronger effect on catalysis in comparison with the amide groups. 126 In particular, due to the cooperative effect of four urea groups, the biomimetic complex 16 exhibited a considerably higher intrinsic CO 2 RR activity than the amide-containing derivative 17, resulting in a comparable TOF value as to 1 at ca. 300 mV more positive overpotential (Fig. 4).The modeling of through-space interactions between specific residues in the second or outer coordination sphere and the metal center may activate alternative mechanistic pathways for a catalytic reaction, giving rise to new scaling relations.

The presence of local urea functional groups, able to establish multipoint H-bonding with the metal-bound CO 2 molecule, was reported to have an even stronger effect on catalysis in comparison with the amide groups. 126 In particular, due to the cooperative effect of four urea groups, the biomimetic complex 16 exhibited a considerably higher intrinsic CO 2 RR activity than the amide-containing derivative 17, resulting in a comparable TOF value as to 1 at ca. 300 mV more positive overpotential (Fig. 4).</p>
        <p>As an alternative strategy to a directional intramolecular H-bonding interaction, the stabilization of negatively charged iron-CO 2 bound intermediates may also be obtained via through-space Coulombic interaction with positively charged pendant groups spatially oriented in the proximity of the active site. 47 This effect was first demonstrated by the enhanced CO 2 RR activity of complex 18, in which the presence of four trimethylanilinium groups in a para position of the TPP phenyl rings resulted in a marked upper left deviation from the linear through-structure effect relationship between catalytic rate and catalyst redox potential (Fig. 3a, right). 112 A comparable effect but opposite in sign was observed by replacing the trimethylanilinium substituents with negatively charged sulfonate groups (19), owing to unfavorable electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, the derivative bearing the quaternary ammonium groups in ortho positions (compound 20) exhibited a significant decrease of the catalytic overpotential while dramatically increasing the TOF (Fig. 3). This effect also leads to a parallel improvement of the molecular catalytic Tafel plot, which correlates the catalyst efficiency (log TOF) and the overpotential (defined as the difference between the applied potential and the standard potential of the reaction to be catalyzed, in general A -B, Z = E 0 AB À E) (Fig. 3a, left). Despite the fact that there is some debate on the value of the standard potential for the CO 2 /CO couple in organic solvents, 49,129,130 complex 20 represents the most efficient homogeneous molecular catalyst for selective CO 2 -to-CO electroreduction reported to date, displaying an unprecedented maximum TOF value of E10 6 s À1 at a 220 mV overpotential. Remarkably, the selectivity to CO is nearly quantitative even in the presence of high concentration of phenol (3 M). Moreover, 20 showed an excellent durability, without any selectivity loss after 84 h electrolysis under CO 2 on different working electrodes. 112 Taking advantage of the ionic character of the porphyrin, the trimethylammonium derivative 18 was also employed to drive homogeneous CO 2 conversion to CO in an aqueous electrolyte. 68,98 At a close to neutral pH (6.7), CO was electrocatalytically produced with a FE of 90%, with only a minor amount of H 2 (7%) at À0.97 V vs. NHE. 68 Analogously to trimethylammonium cations, pendant methylimidazolium moieties in the complex 21 displayed a positive effect on CO 2 RR catalysis in a DMF/H 2 O mixture due to the electrostatic stabilization of the reaction intermediate. 131 In a homogeneous 0.1 M KCl aqueous solution, 21 showed an excellent selectivity to CO (91%) at low overpotential (À0.948 V vs. NHE, Z = 418 mV).As an alternative strategy to a directional intramolecular H-bonding interaction, the stabilization of negatively charged iron-CO 2 bound intermediates may also be obtained via through-space Coulombic interaction with positively charged pendant groups spatially oriented in the proximity of the active site. 47 This effect was first demonstrated by the enhanced CO 2 RR activity of complex 18, in which the presence of four trimethylanilinium groups in a para position of the TPP phenyl rings resulted in a marked upper left deviation from the linear through-structure effect relationship between catalytic rate and catalyst redox potential (Fig. 3a, right). 112 A comparable effect but opposite in sign was observed by replacing the trimethylanilinium substituents with negatively charged sulfonate groups (19), owing to unfavorable electrostatic interactions.

        <p>3.1.2 Heterogenized molecular catalysis. In parallel with the design of homogeneous water-soluble catalysts, several heterogenization approaches have been explored to perform CO 2 RR in aqueous electrolytes with iron porphyrin systems (Fig. 5). A straightforward electropolymerization method was used to control the deposition of microporous films of a carbazole-functionalized tetraphenylporphyrin on a glassy carbon (GC) surface (Fig. 5a). However, the catalytic studies were carried out only in organic media (CH 3 CN), resulting in a severe catalyst deactivation likely due to a partial carboxylation of the porphyrin backbone. 72 A substantial improvement was obtained by the immobilization of a modified iron tetraphenyl porphyrin bearing six pendant OH groups in ortho and ortho 0 positions to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) via either non-covalent and covalent interactions. 132,133 In the former case, the pyrene-modified porphyrin moiety of the catalyst is grafted on the carbon surface via p-p stacking interactions (Fig. 5d). This immobilization strategy was found to preserve the intrinsic catalytic properties of the molecular catalyst, leading to an almost exclusive production of CO (TON = 432 after 3 h electrolysis) at À1.03 V vs. NHE (Z = 480 mV) in neutral aqueous conditions (pH 7.3). The durability of the functionalized electrode is also remarkable, reaching a TON value of 813 after 12 h with a catalytic selectivity of 85%. 133 Analogous results were obtained for a similar system, whereby the pyrene-terminal linker on the porphyrin moiety was replaced by a phenyl ring with a carboxylic acid at the para position (Fig. 5b). The coupling between the -COOH group of the catalyst and the surface -NH 2 groups of the MWCNT electrode led to a covalent attachment of the catalyst through the formation of an amide linkage. 132 At a slightly more negative applied potential (À1.06 V vs. SHE, Z = 510 mV), the functionalized electrode showed an excellent selectivity for CO production (80-90%) over 3 hours electrolysis. Remarkably, a drastic drop of the activity and selectivity to CO (FE going from 77% to 51% over 3 h) was observed for the immobilized unsubstituted iron porphyrin derivative without pendant OH groups. 132 A strong chemical binding of molecular catalysts to metal oxide surfaces may be also obtained. 135 For instance, a co-facial Fe porphyrin dimer was successfully immobilized as a monolayer (E10 À12 mol cm À2 ) on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) surface via a phosphonic acid anchoring group (Fig. 5c). 136 The FTO/Fe porphyrin assembly exhibited good electrocatalytic activity and stability for CO 2 -to-CO conversion in both nonaqueous and aqueous (pH 7.0) solutions. The immobilization of the catalyst on a thin layer of SnO 2 or TiO 2 NPs on FTO increased the catalyst loading (E10 À9 -10 À10 mol cm À2 ), whereas the co-modification of the catalyst-free FTO surface with hydrophobic n-butyl phosphonic acid groups allowed to suppress the non-innocent behavior of the bare FTO electrode.3.1.2 Heterogenized molecular catalysis.

        <p>In some cases, the interaction of the porphyrin unit itself with the electrode surface was found to be strong enough to guarantee a stable functionalization without the need for a chemical modification of the ligand structure. For instance, the positively charged trimethylammonium molecular derivative 18, was effectively anchored to a carbon support by simply drop-casting a suspension of the catalyst with the Nafion binder and carbon powder. 137 The modified electrode was integrated into a home-made electrolyzer for CO 2 /H 2 O splitting into CO/O 2 and was employed as a cathode for selective CO production (FE 90%) at neutral pH. The device showed good performances, providing an overall 50% energy efficiency and current densities of about 1 mA cm À2 over 30 h electrolysis at a 2.5 V cell voltage. 137 In a recent report, a highly porous 3D hierarchical composite (FePGF) was fabricated by mixing complex 18 with reduced liquid crystalline graphene oxide (rLCGO), as a result of the agglomeration due to the p-p stacking and electrostatic interactions between the positive charges on 18 and the negative charges of rLCGO (Fig. 5e). 138 The FePGF electrode (obtained by drop-casting a suspension of FePGF on a carbon support) showed an enhanced CO production and stability in comparison with the homogeneous derivative 18. Moreover, the catalyst-graphene interaction contributed to improve the electron delocalization and facilitate the electron transfer, inducing a ca. 100 mV positive shift in the catalytic onset potential. At neutral pH and 430 mV overpotential (À0.54 V vs. RHE), the FePGF electrode sustained a highly selective production of CO (FE 99%, TOF = 2.9 s À1 , TON = 104 400) over 10 h electrolysis, with negligible formation of H 2 . 138 By a slight modification of this system, a simple and facile self-assembly hydrothermal method was developed to prepare a 18-graphene hydrogel (FePGH) deposited on a reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) support. 139 The FePGH/RVC electrode displayed similar performances as the FePGF/CFP system in terms of selectivity and long-term stability, but at a lower overpotential (À0.39 V vs. RHE, Z = 280 mV).In some cases, the interaction of the porphyrin unit itself with the electrode surface was found to be strong enough to guarantee a stable functionalization without the need for a chemical modification of the ligand structure.

        <p>In the attempt to increase the amount of catalyst incorporated in the thin film, modified Fe porphyrin complexes were used as structural and functional building blocks of porous hybrid architectures. Some Fe porphyrin-based MOF materials containing Zr 6 clusters as nodes were reported to be able to mediate CO 2 RR to CO in both organic and aqueous electrolytes. More specifically, the Fe-MOF-525 system produced a mixture of CO (FE 54%) and H 2 (FE 45%) in CH 3 CN solution, 140 whereas the PCN-222(Fe) MOF catalyst mixed with carbon black afforded a selective conversion of CO 2 to CO (FE CO 91%) in aqueous solution at À0.60 V vs. RHE (Z = 494 mV). 141 Notably, the amount of electroactive Fe-TPP units deposited on the electrode surface in the Fe-MOF-525 catalyst is considerably higher than the conventional heterogenization methods. 140 A novel Fe porphyrin-based COF material, prepared by a straightforward solvent-free method, was also recently reported as a fairly stable catalyst for CO 2 RR, producing CO in good yields in organic media. Nevertheless, catalytic tests in aqueous conditions resulted in major H 2 production. 142 In addition to MOFs and COFs, supramolecular assemblies accommodating iron porphyrin moieties served as competent catalysts for efficient CO production. In comparison with direct non-covalent functionalization of molecular FeTPP, its encapsulation into a rhombicuboctahedral porous organic cage (POC) substantially increased the electroactive surface area, leading to superior catalytic rates and durability. 143 In neutral water, the supramolecular catalyst was able to produce 55 250 turnovers of CO with FEs close to 100% at À0.63 V vs. RHE (Z = 510 mV) over 24 hours. Remarkably, a kinetic analysis suggested that the porous POC framework enhances the catalytic response by facilitating CO 2 diffusion and increasing the local concentration of CO 2 , albeit not altering the catalytic mechanism of FeTPP at a molecular level. 143In the attempt to increase the amount of catalyst incorporated in the thin film, modified Fe porphyrin complexes were used as structural and functional building blocks of porous hybrid architectures.

        <p>In contrast with the Fe analogues, the Co complexes bearing porphyrin-like ligands have received considerably less attention as homogeneous CO 2 RR catalysts in both organic and aqueous electrolytes. [144][145][146] Instead, they were found to be very efficient catalysts once immobilized on the surface of conductive carbon-based electrodes using a wide variety of functionalization strategies. Here we aim to focus on the molecular Co catalysts containing the most popular porphyrin and phthalocyanine moieties (see Chart 2). A comparative study between an immobilized Co phthalocyanine and other porphyrin-like Co-N 4 complexes highlighted that the former possesses an ideal platform for catalytic CO production, favoring the rapid formation of the key intermediate *COOH and the desorption of CO. 147 These findings suggest that not only the metal coordinative environment, but also the bulk structure of the ligand plays an important role in catalysis. A variety of other Co porphyrinoids have been proposed for CO 2 RR so far, including chlorins, 148 corroles 149,150 and corrins. 151 Among them, it is worth mentioning a Co II chlorin complex (22) adsorbed on MWCNTs, which was shown to be able to catalyse the CO 2 -to-CO electroreduction with high FE (89%) at low pH values. 148 3.2.1 Co porphyrin derivatives. In a recent report, Daasbjerg and co-workers have systematically compared the electrocatalytic behaviour of the unmodified CoTPP complex (23) under CO 2 as homogeneous catalyst in DMF solution and as simply dropcasted on a CNT/GC electrode in aqueous electrolyte (0.5 M KHCO 3 ), respectively (Fig. 6). 152 In organic media, CoTPP was found to be a poor catalyst under homogeneous conditions, due to the need for the formation of the catalytically active doubly reduced [Co 0 TPP] 2À species at unfavorable overpotentials for CO 2 RR. At an applied voltage of À2.05 V vs. SCE (Z = 1120 mV), 23 produced only a small amount of CO after 4 h electrolysis, corresponding to a ca. 50% FE and 3.8 turnovers (Fig. 6a). Besides H 2 (FE 2%), several CO 2 RR by-products were obtained in small amounts, including formate (4%), oxalate (0.4%) and acetate (2%). As indicated by cyclic voltammetry and UV-Vis measurements, a strong catalyst degradation was observed during long-term electrolysis. Conversely, the heterogenized molecular catalyst was capable to drive a selective CO 2 conversion to CO (FE 91%) at a considerably lower overpotential (À1.35 V vs. SCE, Z = 550 mV) than the homogenous counterpart (Fig. 6b). In agreement with previous DFT mechanistic studies, these results suggest that [Co I TPP] À is the catalytic species responsible for CO 2 binding and activation. 153,154 Moreover, the heterogenization process improved substantially the catalyst stability, resulting in a 300 times higher activity (TON CO = 1118). These data clearly show the crucial role played by the catalyst support material in heterogeneous catalysis, and aspects such as its porosity and conductivity are of vital importance. 155 Several carbon-based materials have been used for the immobilization of Co porphyrins, including gas diffusion electrodes (GDE), 156 pyrolytic graphite (PG) 51 and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). 157 In the latter case, the carboxyl groups of the rGO film have been proposed to strongly interact with the cobalt [5,10,15,20-(tetra-N-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphyrin] (CoTMPyP, 24) catalyst, inducing the formation of a hydride intermediate species that would be responsible for an unexpected non-negligible formate production. 157 In addition to the interaction between the catalyst and the support, the pH is a crucial factor to control selectivity. A recent study of a Co protoporphyrin (25) immobilized on PG (CoPP/ PG) revealed that small amounts of CH 3 OH (6e) and CH 4 (8e) can be formed in addition to CO in water at moderate overpotential (ca. 500 mV), being the product distribution highly dependent on pH. 51 In addition to gas-chromatographic measurements during electrolysis experiments, online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OLEMS) was used to detect the gaseous products during slow voltammetric scans (1 mV s À1 ). At pH 3, production of CO (major, FE E 40%) and CH 4 (FE o 0.5%) was observed at less negative potentials than HER, whereas H 2 is the dominant product at pH 1, with FEs below 1% for both CO and CH 4 (traces of HCOOH and CH 3 OH were also detected). In spite of the very low yields, the FE for CH 4 was found to be slightly higher at pH 1, due to a fast CO reduction to CH 4 occurring in these conditions simultaneous to HER. The pH-dependent CO 2 RR behaviour of CoPP/PG is consistent with the DFT mechanism proposed for the simple Co porphine complex (CoP, 26): 154 the initial [Co(P)(CO 2 )] À formation, due to the CO 2 binding by the active [Co I (P)] À is followed by an intramolecular electron transfer which leads to a catalystbound CO 2 À radical anion.

As a major finding, the log TOF CO was found to linearly increase with the electron-donating character of the substituent (lower Hammett parameter, s) across the series, in agreement with a rate-determining step involving an electron transfer from the Co center to CO 2 . Furthermore, the immobilized Co complexes bearing cationic functionalities displayed an enhanced CO 2 RR catalytic response, likely due to an additional electrostatic stabilization of the key intermediate (analogously to homogeneous Fe porphyrin catalysts in nonaqueous electrolyte 112 ).</p>
        <p>Several strategies for covalent attachment of Co porphyrins to carbon-based electrodes have been developed in alternative to the non-covalent approach (Fig. 7). In most cases, the molecular catalyst undergoes a chemical reaction or coordinates to specific functional groups or organic molecules introduced on the electrode surface. For instance, the functionalization of GC electrodes with 4-aminopyridine was obtained by direct anodic oxidation of the amine group (Fig. 7a) 159 or through the formation of an amide linkage (Fig. 7b). 160 The axial coordination of the pendant pyridine group to the unsubstituted CoTPP complex ensured a stable immobilization of the molecular catalyst on the surface. The so-formed catalytic films produced CO with moderate FEs (450%) at À1.2 V vs. SCE in phosphate buffer, corresponding to ca. 10 5 turnovers. 160 More recently, a robust covalent linkage of an alkyne-functionalized Co porphyrin to a boron-doped diamond electrode was achieved via a Cu I -catalyzed ''click'' reaction with superficial azide-terminal groups (Fig. 7c). 73 The CO 2 RR process in CH 3 CN was monitored by FTIR, providing evidence of a reductive disproportionation of CO 2 into CO and CO 3 2À , even though the evolved products were not quantified. In another report, an unmodified protoporphyrin IX (25) was covalently grafted to the O-atoms of hydroxyl-functionalized CNTs by reflux in the presence of a tertiary amine (Fig. 7d). 161 In comparison with conventional physical methods, this procedure increased the catalyst loading, maintaining a high level of dispersion. In terms of CO 2 RR performance, the modified electrode exhibited an excellent selectivity to CO (FE 98%) and durability (TON CO = 6 Â 10 4 ) at a 490 mV overpotential, with a stable current density of ca. 25 mA cm À2 over 12 hours. Recently, a direct electroreductive covalent grafting of a diazonium-modified CoTPP to carbon cloth also revealed to be an effective way to obtain high catalytic CO turnovers (3.9 Â 10 5 ) and good selectivity (FE CO 81%) (Fig. 7e). 162 In this case, the p-conjugated phenylene linker contributes to enhance the electron transfer from the electrode to the attached molecular catalyst. Lastly, the electropolymerization of substituted Co porphyrins containing aminophenyl 163 or vinyl 164 groups also resulted in the formation of catalytic films for CO 2 RR.Several strategies for covalent attachment of Co porphyrins to carbon-based electrodes have been developed in alternative to the non-covalent approach (Fig. 7).

        <p>The reticulation of Co porphyrin-like molecular catalysts into porous networks has represented a significant step forward towards the design of new electrocatalytic materials for CO 2 RR. 76,78,165 In a first example, a modified CoTPP was used as the catalytic linker unit assembled into a porous MOF structure, namely Al 2 (OH) 2 TCPP-Co (TCPP-H 2 = 4,4 0 ,4 00 ,4 00 0 -(porphyrin-5,10,15,20-tetrayl)tetrabenzoate). 76 In an attempt to maximize the amount of Co centres electrically connected to the electrode, thin films of MOF were grown directly on the surface, resulting in a sustained electrocatalytic conversion of aqueous CO 2 to CO with current selectivity up to 76% at À0.7 V vs. RHE. By directly growing the MOF on a transparent conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) plate, an estimation of the formal redox potential (E 1/2 ) for the Co II/I transition was made by means of in situ UV-Vis spectroelectrochemistry. 76 Recently, the structure of 2D MOF nanosheets [TCPP(Co)/Zr-BTB] was reported to facilitate the exposure of the Co porphyrin active sites to CO 2 , showing comparable results as to Al 2 (OH) 2 TCPP-Co. 166 The postmodification of the unsaturated coordination sites of Zr 6 clusters with different organic molecules allowed to tune the microenvironment around TCPP(Co), favouring CO 2 RR over HER. Following another strategy, the combination of a Co porphyrin linker with a reductive polyoxometalate (POM) unit gave rise to a MOF electrocatalyst for CO 2 RR to CO with improved electrical properties, resulting in excellent FE CO (99%) and durability (436 h) at À0.8 V vs. RHE. 167 A remarkable improvement in the catalytic performance was obtained by the incorporation of Co porphyrin building blocks into COF structures, whereby a dialdehyde organic linker is connected to the catalytic unit (5,10,15,20-tetrakis[(4-aminophenyl)porphinato]-cobalt, CoTAP) by imine condensation (Fig. 8). 78 Unlike MOFs, the presence of organic linkers offers the opportunity to easily tune the pore size and, in turn, the CO 2 adsorption properties of the material. In order to study this effect on CO 2 RR, 1,4-benzenedicarboxaldehyde (BDA) and biphenyl-4,4 0 -dicarboxaldehyde (BPDA) were employed as struts for the synthesis of two different COF materials, namely COF-366-Co and COF-367-Co, respectively. Albeit an excellent selectivity to CO (FE ca. 90%) was obtained for both catalysts in neutral aqueous conditions at À0.67 V vs. RHE (Z = 550 mV), the latter exhibited an increased TON CO in comparison with COF-366-Co over a 24 h electrolysis period. The catalytic turnover of COF-367-Co was further improved by adopting a multivariate approach (42.9 Â 10 5 CO turnovers for COF-367-Co(1%)), consisting in diluting the electroactive Co porphyrin active sites in the lattice with isostructural metalloporphyrins that are catalytically inactive for CO 2 RR (e.g. Cu). It was also found that growing thin films of COFs on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite led to a 9-fold improvement in the catalytic activity of COF-366-Co over the microcrystalline COF powder deposited on a carbon fabric support, due to an improved electrical contact between the catalytic centers and the electrode. 165 In addition to the physical properties of the COF material, the electronic effect exerted by the framework on the metal center was also investigated. Interestingly, the observation of an additional pre-edge feature in the X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) of the COF catalysts absent in the molecular CoTAP counterpart suggested that an electronic communication takes place between the lattice and the metal center. 78 To investigate the inductive effect of the framework in more detail, a series of COFs were prepared using struts with different electronwithdrawing or electron-donating groups. Even though the experimental trend deviates from the expected order based on basic inductive effect considerations, XAS and CV measurements showed clear differences across the series, providing a direct observation of the effect of the framework functionalization on the metal center. 165 Besides the electronic effect related to the framework, reticular materials are ideal systems to investigate the role of secondary interactions on catalysis, offering the opportunity to tune the local microenvironment of molecularly defined catalytic sites. The boosting effect of such interactions on CO 2 RR electroreduction in aqueous media was recently demonstrated for Co protoporphyrin (CoPP) molecular units immobilized on 2D metal-organic layer (MOL) scaffolds (Fig. 9). 168 Following a post-synthetic approach, CoPP moieties were incorporated into two different MOL backbone derivatives, built from benzenetribenzoate (BTB) and 4 0 -(4-benzoate)-(2,2 0 ,2 00 -terpyridine)-5,5 00dicarboxylate (TPY) linkers, respectively. In the TPY-MOL-CoPP material, the pyridine/pyridinium pendant groups adjacent to the CoPP active sites were found to engage a cooperative synergistic boosting effect on catalysis (Fig. 9a), resembling the second or outer coordination sphere effects above discussed for the homogeneous heme catalysts (see Section 3.1.1). In particular, the presence of pendant pyridine residues resulted in a significant improvement of the CO 2 RR selectivity over HER for TPY-MOL-CoPP (FE CO 4 90%, j CO /j H 2 = 11.8) in comparison with the BTB-MOL-CoPP derivative containing only phenyl rings ( j CO /j H 2 = 2.7), Fig. 9b. The crucial role of the preassembled pyridine/pyridinium groups was demonstrated by the FE CO decay observed upon addition of divalent cations (Ca 2+ or Zn 2+ ) to the solution, due to the blockage of the terpyridyl units. Moreover, a possible electronic effect of axial coordination of the pendant pyridine rings was ruled out by the low faradaic yields obtained upon addition of exogenous pyridine. Notably, during reduction of TPY-MOL-CoPP under CO 2 (pH 6.8), in situ electrochemical diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) provided evidence of pyridine protonation to form pyridinium units (increasing band at 1438 cm À1 ), while these spectral changes were not observed under N 2 neither with BTB-MOL-CoPP under CO 2 (Fig. 9c). 168 DFT calculations suggested that the pyridinium moieties of the framework exert a cooperative boosting effect by lowering the energy barrier for both, CO 2 adsorption and C-O bond cleavage, the latter being the ratedetermining step of the process. The proposed mechanism is analogous to the one above mentioned for the Co porphine system, 154 whereby the one-electron reduction of CoPP to [CoPP] À is followed by CO 2 binding and protonation steps, leading to the formation of the key [pyH-O 2 C-Co(PP)] 0 adduct, stabilized by a pre-positioned pyridine moiety to favor CO 2 RR over HER. A second electron uptake is then followed by the C-O bond cleavage to form the [Co(PP)(CO)] 0 species which undergoes CO release. 168 Finally, the efficiency of electron transport to the catalytic site is a crucial limiting factor to the usage of reticular systems for efficient CO 2 RR. 33 In this regard, the incorporation of electron carriers as building blocks of the framework has revealed to be an effective strategy to improve electron migration in COFs. For instance, crystalline COFs obtained through the assembly of Co porphyrin catalytic units and tetrathiafulvalene struts, serving as an electron donors, resulted in enhanced durability, activity and selectivity to CO. 79,169 Moreover, the exfoliation of bulk COFs into 2D ultrathin nanosheets (ca. 5 nm thickness) led to further improved CO 2 RR performances compared to the unexfoliated COF material, resulting in excellent CO selectivity in a wide potential range. 79 3.2.2 Co phthalocyanine derivatives. In an early report, Co phthalocyanine (CoPc, 33) adsorbed on graphite electrodes was investigated as a catalyst for CO 2 RR in aqueous solution. 170 Analogously to Co porphyrins, 152 CoPc has been reported as a poor electrocatalyst for CO 2 RR in homogeneous conditions. In contrast, the immobilization of CoPc onto a carbon-based electrode leads to a sustained CO 2 conversion in aqueous conditions, forming CO as a major product. 171 Taking advantage of the strong p-p stacking interaction between cobalt phthalocyanines and carbonaceous materials, straightforward dip-coating or drop-casting methods are the most popular deposition techniques to attach the catalyst on a carbon support. [170][171][172][173][174][175] A recent study highlighted the effect of catalyst loading (5 Â 10 À12 -1 Â 10 À7 mol cm À2 ) and dispersion on the CO 2 RR activity of a CoPc catalyst drop-casted on oxygen-functionalized carbon paper. 176 As a general trend, the FE for CO production slightly decreased upon reducing the loading of the catalyst (from 96% to 80% across the series), likely due to a more pronounced exposure of the carbon paper support, which is able to catalyse HER. However, low loadings and high dispersion levels contribute to mitigate transport limitations and to avoid the formation of aggregates or stacking phenomena, thus providing a substantial increase in the TOF. The hybridization with carbon nanotubes is also reported to minimize CoPc aggregation in many cases. 177 Besides the catalyst loading and the specific catalyst-support interaction, the stability of the system can be improved by introducing suitable modifications to the ligand framework. The presence of sterically hindered long alkoxy chains (34) on the phthalocyanine backbone constituted an effective strategy to contrast CoPc aggregation on graphene sheets, leading to better CO 2 RR performances. 178 A limited formation of aggregates was also obtained for robust Co polyphthalocyanine thin films on MWCNTs synthesized via an in situ microwave-assisted template-directed method. 179 Other approaches based on single-pot hydrothermal 180 or solid-state 181 polycondensation of CoPc-type catalysts, as well as direct electropolymerization methods 182 have also been reported.The reticulation of Co porphyrin-like molecular catalysts into porous networks has represented a significant step forward towards the design of new electrocatalytic materials for CO 2 RR. 76,78,165 In a first example, a modified CoTPP was used as the catalytic linker unit assembled into a porous MOF structure, namely Al 2 (OH) 2 TCPP-Co (TCPP-H 2 = 4,4 0 ,4 00 ,4 00 0 -(porphyrin-5,10,15,20-tetrayl)tetrabenzoate). 76 In an attempt to maximize the amount of Co centres electrically connected to the electrode, thin films of MOF were grown directly on the surface, resulting in a sustained electrocatalytic conversion of aqueous CO 2 to CO with current selectivity up to 76% at À0.7 V vs. RHE.

        <p>The functionalization of the CoPc structure with electronwithdrawing substituents displayed beneficial effects on catalysis. For example, a perfluorinated CoPc complex (35) adsorbed on carbon cloth served as a robust catalyst for simultaneous CO 2 /CO conversion and H 2 O/O 2 splitting. 183 At the cathode, 35 was able to produce CO with high selectivity (FE 93%) at À0.8 V vs. RHE at neutral pH. It has been hypothesized that the fluorine substituents not only induce a positive shift of the Co II/I redox potential, but also facilitate the CO release step, thus accelerating the product removal and catalytic turnover. An analogous enhancing catalytic effect was observed by introducing -CN groups to the CoPc molecule (Fig. 10). The CN-functionalized CoPc complex (36) supported on MWCNTs exhibited higher CO selectivity at a lower overpotential than the parent CoPc catalyst, producing CO in high yields (FE 98%) and current densities (E15 mA cm À2 ) at À0.63 V vs. RHE (Z = 520 mV) at near-neutral pH. 184 The preparation method and the use of MWCNTs had a positive impact on the CO 2 RR activity, ensuring uniform and robust catalyst distribution on the electrode. Notably, a 36/CNT cathode was successfully implemented in a microflow cell with a CoO x /CNT anode, sustaining a selective CO production (FE 94% with j CO = 31 mA cm À2 ) at a cell voltage of 1.9 V in 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. 185 A stable CO evolution (FE E 90%) was observed for 10 h at a constant cell voltage of 2.0 V.The functionalization of the CoPc structure with electronwithdrawing substituents displayed beneficial effects on catalysis.

        <p>Another remarkable example of high-performance heterogeneous catalyst for CO 2 -to-CO conversion is represented by a novel Co complex bearing a trimethylammonium group and three tert-butyl substituents installed on the phthalocyanine moiety (37) (Chart 2). 186 The structure of the latter is reminiscent of the highly active Fe porphyrin systems containing positively charged pendant groups. 112,[137][138][139] Remarkably, porous films of 37 with carbon black or MWCNTs on carbon paper showed an excellent stability and nearly quantitative selectivity to CO in a wide range of pH (4-14). At neutral pH, 37 was found to outperform CoPc (33), resulting in an average current density of ca. 18 mA cm À2 for CO production (93% selectivity) at À0.676 V vs. RHE (Z = 539 mV). Even more importantly, 37 provided excellent results once supported on a gas-diffusion cathode and used in a flow cell setup under alkaline conditions (1 M KOH): at a very low overpotential (À0.3 V vs. RHE, Z = 200 mV) a j CO = 22.2 mA cm À2 was obtained, while reaching an impressive maximum partial current density of 165 mA cm À2 at À0.92 V vs. RHE (Z = 810 mV) (Fig. 11). 186 In a related work, the readily available, low-cost parent CoPc complex (33) was able to sustain a selective CO 2 -to-CO conversion at 50 mA cm À2 for 4100 hours in a flow reactor. 187 The implementation of 33 in a tandem flow cell with a Ni foam OER catalyst led to an excellent selectivity for CO production at commercially relevant current densities (Z150 mA cm À2 ). Furthermore, the FE CO drop observed upon increasing the current density from 150 to 200 mA cm À2 was due to a depletion in proton concentration, rather than to a real degradation of the molecular catalyst. Indeed, a FE CO E 88% was maintained at 200 mA cm À2 upon the addition of PhOH during the preparation of the catalyst ink. 187 The latter may also act as a local pH buffer, alleviating the issues related to precipitation of insoluble KHCO 3 crystals at the cathode. This improvement led to an overall cell voltage of ca. 2.5 V, outperforming an Ag solid-state CO 2 RR catalyst at a comparable CO partial current density. 188 These results demonstrate that earth-abundant metal-based molecular catalysts can be efficiently implemented in real devices for selective CO 2 conversion to CO.Another remarkable example of high-performance heterogeneous catalyst for CO 2 -to-CO conversion is represented by a novel Co complex bearing a trimethylammonium group and three tert-butyl substituents installed on the phthalocyanine moiety (37) (Chart 2). 186 The structure of the latter is reminiscent of the highly active Fe porphyrin systems containing positively charged pendant groups. 112,[137][138][139] Remarkably, porous films of 37 with carbon black or MWCNTs on carbon paper showed an excellent stability and nearly quantitative selectivity to CO in a wide range of pH (4-14).

Even more importantly, 37 provided excellent results once supported on a gas-diffusion cathode and used in a flow cell setup under alkaline conditions (1 M KOH): at a very low overpotential (À0.3 V vs. RHE, Z = 200 mV) a j CO = 22.2 mA cm À2 was obtained, while reaching an impressive maximum partial current density of 165 mA cm À2 at À0.92 V vs. RHE (Z = 810 mV) (Fig. 11). 186 In a related work, the readily available, low-cost parent CoPc complex (33) was able to sustain a selective CO 2 -to-CO conversion at 50 mA cm À2 for 4100 hours in a flow reactor. 187 The implementation of 33 in a tandem flow cell with a Ni foam OER catalyst led to an excellent selectivity for CO production at commercially relevant current densities (Z150 mA cm À2 ). Furthermore, the FE CO drop observed upon increasing the current density from 150 to 200 mA cm À2 was due to a depletion in proton concentration, rather than to a real degradation of the molecular catalyst. Indeed, a FE CO E 88% was maintained at 200 mA cm À2 upon the addition of PhOH during the preparation of the catalyst ink. 187 The latter may also act as a local pH buffer, alleviating the issues related to precipitation of insoluble KHCO 3 crystals at the cathode. This improvement led to an overall cell voltage of ca. 2.5 V, outperforming an Ag solid-state CO 2 RR catalyst at a comparable CO partial current density. 188 These results demonstrate that earth-abundant metal-based molecular catalysts can be efficiently implemented in real devices for selective CO 2 conversion to CO.</p>
        <p>Besides the outstanding stability and efficiency for CO production, their extreme versatility is another attractive feature of Co phthalocyanines. Very recently, it has been demonstrated that CoPc/MWCNT electrodes are able to catalyse the electrochemical CO 2 reduction to CH 3 OH in aqueous media via a CO intermediate. 52 Electrolyses performed under CO-saturated and highly basic (pH 13) conditions reached a FE E 14% for CH 3 OH production at À0.64 V vs. RHE (Z = 740 mV). In addition to CH 3 OH, a small amount (ca. 3%) of formaldehyde, HCHO, was also detected in solution after an electrolysis under CO at À0.54 V vs. RHE. In strongly alkaline conditions, a non-faradaic disproportionation of HCHO to a mixture of CH 3 OH and HCOO À (Cannizzaro reaction) may occur in solution and it should be considered. 189 In order to demonstrate that the Cannizzaro reaction accounts only for a small part of the detected CH 3 OH after electrolysis under CO, the ratios CH 3 OH/HCOO À were calculated to be 16 and 27 at pH 13 and 12, respectively. Furthermore, an electrolysis experiment under Ar in the presence of HCHO led to a considerable amount of CH 3 OH (FE 4 18%) at À0.54 V vs. RHE, confirming that HCHO is an intermediate for CH 3 OH formation. These findings open the door to a new sequential two-step CO 2 RR strategy for fuels production using the same CoPc molecular catalyst: at neutral pH, CoPc can efficiently and selectively convert CO 2 into CO, which can be further reduced to CH 3 OH using the same catalyst under basic conditions (pH 12-13). The capability of the immobilized molecular CoPc system to catalyse multi-electron CO 2 RR has been further confirmed by a recent study, whereby a CoPc/CNT composite was found to convert CO 2 to CH 3 OH with FE 4 40% at À0.94 V vs. RHE in a near-neutral electrolyte. 53 The major drawback relies in the low durability of the system, likely due to a partial hydrogenation of the Pc ligand, causing a dramatic drop of the CH 3 OH production after a few hours of electrolysis. However, the introduction of four amino groups onto the Pc moiety resulted in a substantial improvement of the catalyst (compound 38, Chart 2) robustness, leading to a sustained production of CH 3 OH with average FE ca. 28% for 12 h of electrolysis.Besides the outstanding stability and efficiency for CO production, their extreme versatility is another attractive feature of Co phthalocyanines.

        <p>In alternative to non-covalent functionalization methods, CoPc can be effectively anchored to a carbon-based electrode surface via the incorporation within a deposited layer of a coordination polymer such as poly-4-vinylpyridine (P4VP) (Fig. 12). 190,191 The dangling-free pyridyl groups act as the anchoring points for CoPc through an axial coordination to the Co center (Fig. 12a). In acidic conditions, the CoPc-P4VP electrode is a competent catalyst for the selective CO production (FE E 90%) at À0.73 V vs. RHE (Z = 610 mV), outperforming the parent CoPc system. 192 The catalytic boosting effect of pyridine coordination on CoPc has been also reported elsewhere. 193 Two major parameters were found to affect the catalytic response: (i) the axial coordination of pyridine (primary coordinative environment), which increases the nucleophilicity of the Co I center facilitating the CO 2 binding step; (ii) the interaction with partially protonated peripheral pyridyl residues of the polymeric film that may undergo secondary coordination sphere effects (e.g. stabilizing H-bonding interactions, proton relays), as previously seen for a Co porphyrin catalyst incorporated into a MOF structure (see Section 3.2.1). 192 In order to evaluate these factors independently from each other, the electrocatalytic CO 2 RR behaviour of CoPc and CoPc-P4VP was systematically compared with the following three systems (Fig. 12b): the five-coordinate CoPc(py), in the absence of the P4VP membrane; CoPc encapsulated into a non-coordinating poly-2-vinylpyridine layer (CoPc-P2VP), whereby the axial coordination of the pyridine is prevented by steric hindrance; the five-coordinate CoPc(py)-P2VP, derived by embedding CoPc(py) within the P2VP polymer. 192 A detailed kinetic analysis highlighted a change in the rate determining step across the series, corresponding to the CO 2 binding step for the four coordinate derivatives (CoPc, CoPc-P2VP) and to a subsequent protonation of the coordinated CO 2 intermediate for the five-coordinated systems (CoPc(py), CoPc-P4VP, CoPc(py)-P2VP), confirming the pivotal role of the secondary proton relays in controlling the proton delivery to the CoPc active sites. 194 Other surface functionalities than the pyridyl groups may also contribute to enhance the catalytic properties of CoPc-type species. For example, the preferential immobilization of planar Co 2,3naphthalocyanine (39) on doped graphene via axial Co-O coordination to the terminal sulfoxide groups rather than to the carboxyl ones, improved the electronic communication between the catalyst and the conductive surface, leading to a 3-fold increase of TOF for CO production and a FE up to 97%. 195 Finally, Co phthalocyanine derivatives have been employed to design new hierarchical 3D materials for efficient CO 2 RR. In a recent report, Co phthalocyanine catechol building blocks have been implemented into a novel metal-catecholate framework, namely MOF-1992. 196 The system displayed an original topology with more accessible CoPc sites, as well as improved charge transfer properties, leading to significantly higher electroactive surface area than the previously reported reticular Co/Fe catalysts. 76,78,140,141,165 At neutral pH, MOF-1992 was able to mediate a selective conversion of CO 2 to CO (FE 80%) at À0.63 V vs. RHE (Z = 520 mV) with relevant current densities (416 mA cm À2 ).

        <p>3.3.1 Porphyrin derivatives. Metalloporphyrinoids containing other transition metals than Fe or Co have received much less attention as catalysts for CO 2 RR. In an early report, homogeneous solutions of Pd and Ag porphyrins produced traces of oxalate upon electrolysis under CO 2 in aprotic media, suffering from severe deactivation likely due to partial demetalation. 197 Koper and co-workers investigated the influence of the metal center on the CO 2 RR to HCOOH in a series of heterogenized metalloprotoporphyrin catalysts immobilized on pyrolytic graphite in aqueous media. 198 Two main trends became apparent across the series: metals such as Cr, Mn, Co and Fe did not produce any observable amount of HCOOH at pH 3. On the contrary, the Ni-, Pd-, Ga-, Cu-, Sn-, In-and Rh-based systems showed variable amounts of HCOOH depending on pH and applied potential. A maximum FE HCOOH of ca. 70% was achieved for the In derivative at pH 9.6 and À1.9 V vs. RHE. A later theoretical study suggested that the nature of the electrogenerated nucleophilic species interacting with the substrate primarily controls the selectivity for CO 2 RR to CO or HCOOH in the series. 199 Accordingly to the proposed model, CO can be formed only by metal-electroactive metalloporphyrins, in which the nucleophilic metal center is able to bind CO 2 to form a metal-carboxylate intermediate. Conversely, HCOOH is triggered by the formation of a hydride donor species, which may be a metal hydride or a hydridic phlorin ligand (protonation of the meso carbon of the porphyrin). In this scenario, metal-electroactive metalloporphyrins (e.g. Fe, Co, Rh) are suitable catalysts for CO or HCOOH depending on the external conditions. It is worth noting that the homogeneous FeTPP catalyst was found to convert CO 2 into formate in high faradaic yields in the presence of an excess of tertiary amines (high pH) in an organic electrolyte via an alternative pathway not involving the formation of a metal hydride (Section 3.1.1). 106 On the other hand, ligand-electroactive metalloporphyrins (e.g. Ni, Zn, Cu, Pd, Ag, Cd, Ga, In, Sn) are predicted to be potential catalysts for selective CO 2 reduction to HCOOH via the hydride donor phlorin ligand pathway. Nevertheless, some reported Cu and Zn porphyrin systems deviate from the aforementioned predictions, producing CO with high FEs. 200,201 An in situ restructuration of the original molecular species under reducing conditions or the specific interaction with substituents to the porphyrin moiety have been invoked to explain the unexpected behaviour. 199 It is worth noting that a synthetic Zn bacteriochlorin has been recently reported as a robust catalyst for selective CO production in DMF/H 2 O mixture without any evidence of catalyst degradation. 202 Moreover, a number of extrinsic factors including the nature of the support material, its pre-treatment or the encapsulation of the molecular catalyst in polymer matrices may affect the CO 2 RR selectivity, reactivity and stability of metalloporphyrins. 203 Fig. 12 (a) An illustration of a cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) encapsulated within a hydrophobic poly-4-vinylpyridine (P4VP) membrane highlighting the postulated primary-, secondary-, and outer-coordination sphere effects. 192,194 3.3.2 Phthalocyanine derivatives. Carbon monoxide (Co, Fe, Ni, Pd) and formic acid (Sn, Pb, In, Zn, Al) are the most common products reported for CO 2 RR mediated by metal phthalocyanines. 175 Nevertheless, comparative studies on a series of phthalocyanine model catalysts containing different metals (Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, Cu), showed that the Co derivative clearly outperformed the other counterparts in terms of efficiency, stability and selectivity to CO. 204 DFT calculations suggest that the optimal CO 2 RR activity of the latter is related to its favourable properties for *COOH formation and *CO desorption. In comparison with the direct loading of molecular catalysts on the electrode, CNT hybridization revealed to be an effective strategy to boost the CO 2 -to-CO conversion catalytic performances of Co, Fe and Mn phthalocyanine catalysts, being the Co counterpart still the most active across the series. 177 Recent examples of efficient and selective molecular catalysts based on Cu 205,206 and Ni 207 phthalocyanine catalysts have been also recently reported for selective CO 206,207 or CH 4 205 production in aqueous media.3.3.1 Porphyrin derivatives.

        <p>In this section, the most relevant molecular systems based on non-heme macrocyclic and polydentate nitrogen ligands will be reviewed. We will focus on Fe, Co and Ni systems, which cover the majority of the molecular catalysts with this type of ligands reported so far for CO 2 electroreduction. Section 4.1 is devoted to the discussion of the widely studied Ni II and Co II tetraazamacrocycle complexes. The main molecular catalysts with alternative nitrogen-containing macrocyclic frameworks will be summarized in Section 4.2. Finally, Section 4.3 briefly summarizes some relevant recent studies carried out on molecular systems based on macrocyclic-like nitrogen ligands, comprising aminopyridyl, polypyridyl and tripodal N4 systems. [209][210][211] Although its electrocatalytic behaviour is not fully understood yet, this system has been widely studied over more than 30 years, representing a milestone in the field of molecular catalysis for electrochemical CO 2 reduction. It displays excellent performance in water in terms of activity, selectivity and durability over a wide range of pH, being able to selectively produce high turnover numbers (TONs) of CO in acidic media (pH = 4-5) on a Hg pool electrode at À1.00 V vs. NHE. 210 For this system, a drastic current increase is observed in correspondence of the Ni II/I wave, suggesting an active role of the Ni I species in the catalysis (Fig. 13). However, the catalytic behavior of 40 is extremely sensitive to several experimental factors, including the electrode material. Exceptional performances were obtained by using a Hg working electrode, owing to the strong adsorption of the electrogenerated [Ni(cyclam)] + species on the electrode surface. 212 This is consistent with the huge (ca. 300 mV) positive shift observed for the potential of the Ni II/I wave under CO 2 and with the presence of a pre-wave just before the catalytic wave (Fig. 13). Moreover, the catalytic current was found to reach a plateau at increasing catalyst concentration, suggesting an adsorption saturation on the electrode surface. 210 Albeit with slower catalytic rates, more recent experiments on glassy carbon electrodes confirmed that 40 may also act as a purely homogeneous catalyst for selective CO 2 RR to CO, with CO FE close to 90% at À1.30 V vs. NHE in an aqueous KCl solution or in a CH 3 CN : H 2 O 4 : 1 mixture. 213 The exclusive selectivity of 40 toward CO 2 RR over H 2 evolution in water has been attributed to the unfavorable formation of the [Ni(H)(cyclam)] 2+ hydride intermediate (pK a B 1.8) in the operating pH conditions (pH B 4). 214 In the proposed mechanism for CO 2 conversion to CO mediated by 40 (Scheme 2), the electrogenerated [Ni(cyclam)] + species readily adsorbs on the electrode surface, undergoing CO 2 binding to form a [Ni(CO 2 )(cyclam)] + adduct in a Z 1 -CO 2 binding mode. 215 The origin of the unique electrocatalytic behavior of [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ under CO 2 has been proposed to rely on a combination of structural and experimental factors, such as electrode material and electrolyte. The kinetic inertness of the macrocyclic [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ even in acidic media may explain the unique durability in comparison with other acyclic or cyclic analogous complexes. 210 Moreover, the redox-innocent character of the cyclam backbone increases the nucleophilicity of the Ni I center and, thus, its reactivity toward CO 2 . Lower affinity for CO 2 binding was observed for some Ni II derivatives bearing unsaturated 14-membered tetraazamacrocycles (''cyclam-like''). 11,220 The N-alkylation of the amine group of the cyclam ligand also led to a significant drop in the catalytic activity. This trend has been explained by a progressively diminished reducing power of the electrogenerated Ni I species by increasing the N-alkylation substitution level, consistent with the positive shift experimentally observed for the E 0 (Ni II/I ) redox potential. 213,215,221 Steric hindrance of the bulky alkyl groups may also hamper the CO 2 binding, as well as influence the adsorption of the catalyst on the electrode surface. 222 Furthermore, the pendant amine functionalities installed on the cyclam moiety have been proposed to play a crucial role in the H-bonding stabilization of the Z 1 -CO 2 adduct through an outer coordination sphere effect. 11,213 Notably, the attachment of an additional pendant NH 3 + group to the cyclam structure provided an enhanced catalytic production of CO for the corresponding Ni II complex. 223 The specific geometrical conformation of the cyclam ring was found to be critical for the efficiency of the catalyst, strongly affecting the stability of key molecular intermediates adsorbed on the electrode surface. In aqueous solution, [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ (40) exists as a mixture of two dominant different conformational isomers, namely Trans-I and Trans-III, respectively in a 15% and 85% equilibrium (see Chart 3). 224 Although the reductive Ni II/I process has been proposed to be accompanied by a rapid conformational change of the [Ni(cyclam)] + complex adsorbed on the Hg electrode, 212,222,225 the identity of the surfacebound conformer that plays the active role in catalysis is still under debate. Some experimental and computational studies suggested the Trans-I isomer of [Ni(cyclam)] + to be the preferred geometry for CO 2 binding compared to the Trans-III derivative, presumably due to a more favorable spatial orientation of the pendant N-H groups which would contribute to stabilize the Ni-CO 2 adduct by H-bonding interaction. 11,213,215,222 However, DFT optimized geometries of [Ni(CO)(cyclam)] + indicate that, in the homogeneous case, the Trans-I [Ni(cyclam)] + isomer binds CO much more strongly that the Trans-III conformer. 217 These findings suggest that a square-planar geometry is desirable to facilitate CO detachment from the carbonyl species, whereas outof-plane distortions of the [Ni(CO)(cyclam)] + structure would contribute to further stabilize the metal-CO bond. In a recent integrated experimental-computational study, Kubiak and coworkers demonstrated that the Trans-III [Ni(cyclam)] + conformer is preferentially adsorbed on a Hg surface through dispersive interactions, thus representing the active species involved in CO 2 RR. 226 Importantly, the Hg surface was found to facilitate the CO desorption kinetics of the adsorbed Trans-III [Ni(CO)(cyclam)] + complex, by weakening the Ni-CO s interactions. The origin of this effect was ascribed to the flattened geometry of the adsorbed Ni macrocycle, which reduces the CO binding affinity. These findings shed light on the decisive role played by the catalyst-electrode interactions to explain the catalytic efficiency of [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ (40) on Hg under CO 2 , suggesting that the stability of the adsorbed [Ni(CO)(cyclam)] + intermediate influences the efficiency of the overall process.In this section, the most relevant molecular systems based on non-heme macrocyclic and polydentate nitrogen ligands will be reviewed.

The kinetic inertness of the macrocyclic [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ even in acidic media may explain the unique durability in comparison with other acyclic or cyclic analogous complexes. 210 Moreover, the redox-innocent character of the cyclam backbone increases the nucleophilicity of the Ni I center and, thus, its reactivity toward CO 2 . Lower affinity for CO 2 binding was observed for some Ni II derivatives bearing unsaturated 14-membered tetraazamacrocycles (''cyclam-like''). 11,220 The N-alkylation of the amine group of the cyclam ligand also led to a significant drop in the catalytic activity. This trend has been explained by a progressively diminished reducing power of the electrogenerated Ni I species by increasing the N-alkylation substitution level, consistent with the positive shift experimentally observed for the E 0 (Ni II/I ) redox potential. 213,215,221 Steric hindrance of the bulky alkyl groups may also hamper the CO 2 binding, as well as influence the adsorption of the catalyst on the electrode surface. 222 Furthermore, the pendant amine functionalities installed on the cyclam moiety have been proposed to play a crucial role in the H-bonding stabilization of the Z 1 -CO 2 adduct through an outer coordination sphere effect. 11,213 Notably, the attachment of an additional pendant NH 3 + group to the cyclam structure provided an enhanced catalytic production of CO for the corresponding Ni II complex. 223 The specific geometrical conformation of the cyclam ring was found to be critical for the efficiency of the catalyst, strongly affecting the stability of key molecular intermediates adsorbed on the electrode surface. In aqueous solution, [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ (40) exists as a mixture of two dominant different conformational isomers, namely Trans-I and Trans-III, respectively in a 15% and 85% equilibrium (see Chart 3). 224 Although the reductive Ni II/I process has been proposed to be accompanied by a rapid conformational change of the [Ni(cyclam)] + complex adsorbed on the Hg electrode, 212,222,225 the identity of the surfacebound conformer that plays the active role in catalysis is still under debate. Some experimental and computational studies suggested the Trans-I isomer of [Ni(cyclam)] + to be the preferred geometry for CO 2 binding compared to the Trans-III derivative, presumably due to a more favorable spatial orientation of the pendant N-H groups which would contribute to stabilize the Ni-CO 2 adduct by H-bonding interaction. 11,213,215,222 However, DFT optimized geometries of [Ni(CO)(cyclam)] + indicate that, in the homogeneous case, the Trans-I [Ni(cyclam)] + isomer binds CO much more strongly that the Trans-III conformer. 217 These findings suggest that a square-planar geometry is desirable to facilitate CO detachment from the carbonyl species, whereas outof-plane distortions of the [Ni(CO)(cyclam)] + structure would contribute to further stabilize the metal-CO bond. In a recent integrated experimental-computational study, Kubiak and coworkers demonstrated that the Trans-III [Ni(cyclam)] + conformer is preferentially adsorbed on a Hg surface through dispersive interactions, thus representing the active species involved in CO 2 RR. 226 Importantly, the Hg surface was found to facilitate the CO desorption kinetics of the adsorbed Trans-III [Ni(CO)(cyclam)] + complex, by weakening the Ni-CO s interactions. The origin of this effect was ascribed to the flattened geometry of the adsorbed Ni macrocycle, which reduces the CO binding affinity. These findings shed light on the decisive role played by the catalyst-electrode interactions to explain the catalytic efficiency of [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ (40) on Hg under CO 2 , suggesting that the stability of the adsorbed [Ni(CO)(cyclam)] + intermediate influences the efficiency of the overall process.</p>
        <p>Only a few molecular Ni derivatives containing tetraazamacrocyclic ligands have been reported to outperform the parent complex 40. Among them, the RRSS-[Ni(HTIM)] 2+ (HTIM = 2,3,9,10-tetramethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane) (41) and [Ni(MTC)] 2+ (MTC = 2,3-trans-cyclohexano-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane) (42) complexes described by Fujita et al. revealed to be excellent electrocatalysts for selective CO production on a Hg pool electrode at pH 5 and À0.96 V vs. NHE (Chart 3). 216,225 At very low pH values (pH o 2), CO/H 2 mixtures were produced depending on the applied potential. Analogously to the parent [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ complex, the remarkable activity of these systems was ascribed to their favorable geometry and stereochemistry. For instance, the RRSS isomer of the [Ni(HTIM)] 2+ complex (41) features a flat geometry analogous to the Trans-III conformer of [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ , suggesting an optimal ligand structure for adsorption on Hg. Moreover, the RRSS isomer was considerably more active than the RSSR isomer, since an unfavorable orientation of the bulky methyl groups in the latter hinders CO 2 binding at the Ni center. More recently, the functionalization of the reference [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ catalyst with a carboxylic acid led to a more efficient electrocatalyst, 43, for selective CO 2to-CO conversion in aqueous media over a wide pH range. 70 The most remarkable aspect of this system consists in its significant selectivity toward CO production (FE CO = 66%; FE H 2 = 15%) at À0.99 V vs. NHE in very acidic aqueous conditions (pH o 2), while the parent 40 catalyst predominantly produced H 2 (FE CO = 13%; FE H 2 = 73%). Finally, it is worth mentioning that a number of di- 211,227 or trinuclear 228 Ni macrocyclic systems have been reported for CO 2 RR so far, showing comparable or inferior catalytic properties than 40. However, a remarkable activity was recently shown for a dinuclear N II macrocycle complex (44, Chart 3), 229 displaying a synergistic cooperative effect between the two Ni centers analogous to a previously mentioned iron porphyrin system. 100,136 The catalyst exhibited an almost exclusive selectivity toward CO production on a GC electrode in a CH 3 CN : H 2 O (4 : 1) mixture as well as in pure water, outperforming both, a mononuclear N II derivative and a synthetic dinuclear system featuring a longer spatial distance between the Ni centers.Only a few molecular Ni derivatives containing tetraazamacrocyclic ligands have been reported to outperform the parent complex 40.

        <p>In addition to the electrode material, the catalytic CO 2 RR performances of Ni II tetrazamacrocyclic complexes were found to be extremely sensitive to the reaction medium. For [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ , a proper choice of solvent and electrolyte is vital to achieve an efficient and selective process, with water being a particularly suitable solvent. In an early report, the stability of the [Ni(CO)(cyclam)] + complex was found to be significantly lower in aqueous media compared to DMF, suggesting that water may play an active role in promoting a fast decomposition of the deactivation carbonyl species. 210 Furthermore, the solvation properties of water molecules are crucial to stabilize the Ni-CO 2 adduct by H-bonding interactions. Recently, an electron-deficient organo-urea additive was reported to act as a multipoint H-bond donor, boosting the electrocatalytic CO 2 RR of [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ in wet CH 3 CN (up to 1 M H 2 O), without altering the exclusive selectivity of the catalyst to CO over H 2 (Fig. 14). 230 In this system, the added urea acts as a co-catalyst rather than a stoichiometric additive, contributing to stabilize the key intermediates involved in the CO 2 RR process. The superior promotional catalytic effect observed for the Schreiner's urea additive (two-point H-bond donor) compared to other single-point H-bond donors or acids, indicates that the effect is not due to acidity alone.In addition to the electrode material, the catalytic CO 2 RR performances of Ni II tetrazamacrocyclic complexes were found to be extremely sensitive to the reaction medium.

        <p>The use of different electrolytes or buffer systems in aqueous media also led to drastic changes in activity and selectivity of [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ . 210 The influence of the buffer identity on the catalytic CO 2 RR activity of [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ was recently studied, revealing the buffer charge to be the main factor affecting the activity and selectivity of the reaction. 231 In particular, small-sized non-coordinating cationic buffers were found to be beneficial for CO 2 RR over HER, suggesting the involvement of pseudo outer coordination sphere effects (electrostatic, protonation, H-bonding interactions, etc.) on the key reaction intermediates. Albeit more disordered than the local effect previously discussed for molecular catalysts, the role of the electrolyte or buffer should be carefully taken into account for the optimization of a catalytic system, offering the opportunity to design local microenvironments for efficient CO 2 RR. The catalytic behavior of [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ was also explored in ionic liquids, showing better activity and selectivity for CO production by using the hydrophilic 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMImBF 4 ) solvent/electrolyte system. 232 On the other hand, an unexpected change of selectivity was observed by using DMF with low water content as reaction medium, resulting in the production of CO/HCOO À mixtures depending on the applied potential (FE HCOO À up to 75%). 211 This apparently counterintuitive behavior was ascribed to the formation of an alternative Ni-Z 1 -OCO adduct, which however was predicted to be energetically less favored than the Z 1 -CO 2 one. 215 Although [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ is a very efficient and low-cost electrocatalyst for CO production operating in aqueous media, the need for hazardous mercury pool-based electrodes strongly limits its usage for practical applications. As above mentioned, owing to the key role played by the electrode material in the catalytic reaction, the replacement of Hg with more environmentally friendly solid electrodes while maintaining a comparable catalytic performance is a challenge. In this perspective, some attempts have been described in order to covalently attach Ni tetrazamacrocycle molecular systems to carbon-based electrodes 233 or metal oxide-based photoelectrodes. 234 For example, some [Ni(alkynyl-cyclam)] 2+ catalysts anodically electrografted to the surface of a GC electrode, displayed a predominant H 2 evolution activity (FE H 2 = 89%; FE CO = 7%) in a CO 2 saturated CH 3 CN/water solution, attributing the low performance to a possible steric hindrance of the catalyst conformation detrimental for CO 2 RR. 233 A more efficient system was obtained by incorporating the [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ complex into a poly-(allylamine) (PALA) matrix, through Schiff's base condensation via axial coordination of 4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde. 235 Both, the axial pyridine coordination and the encapsulation into the polymer backbone contributed to lower the overpotential, enabling a durable CO production with high faradaic yields (79-92%) over 24 h at À0.78 V vs. Ag/AgCl (pH 8, 50 mM Tris buffer). As previously discussed, analogous beneficial effects of pyridine coordination and/or polymer encapsulation on CO 2 RR have been observed for several cobalt phthalocyanine or porphyrin systems (see Section 3). This approach is particularly attractive to incorporate molecular catalysts into biological scaffolds for the synthesis of bioinspired systems that can be used for catalytic purposes. In particular, proteins are robust platforms featuring a well-defined hosting environment which offers the opportunity to modulate the activity/selectivity of molecular catalysts through secondary coordination sphere interactions. As an example, the axial coordination of the Ni-cyclam catalyst at a pendant histidine residue of azurin led to an artificial metalloenzyme active for CO 2 RR, displaying a positive shift in the onset catalytic potential under CO 2 compared to free [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ . 236 Although bulk electrolysis data were not reported, photocatalytic quantitative data showed an increased selectivity to CO for the azurin-[Ni(cyclam)] 2+ scaffold in comparison with free [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ , suggesting a critical role played by the protein environment. Moreover, the presence of the redox-active Cu center also had a remarkable impact on improving the selectivity towards CO 2 RR, mimicking the role of iron-sulfur clusters in CODH. Owing to the extremely conformation-sensitive CO 2 RR process mediated by [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ , it was also speculated that the protein environment may induce constraints to geometrical distortions of the cyclam ligand, favoring CO 2 RR over HER. 236 Finally, Machan and co-workers demonstrated the possible implementation of homogeneous systems for CO 2 RR using a flow-cell technology. 237 More specifically, [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ was employed as a benchmark homogeneous electrocatalyst in a non-aqueous electrolyzer for CO 2 RR to CO based on a continuous flow-cell configuration (Fig. 15). In this setup, ferrocene served as a sacrificial electron donor, whereas NH 4 PF 6 was used as both exogenous proton donor and supporting electrolyte. The flow-cell system afforded CO production with FE 4 80% and current densities up to 50 mA cm À2 using a graphite felt cathode in CH 3 CN in the presence of 0.5 M NH 4 PF 6 . Compared to the behavior in a conventional H-type cell setup, the [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ homogeneous catalyst showed extended durability and better selectivity in the flow-cell configuration. Moreover, it was found that the solvent plays a key role in the efficiency of the process, with CH 3 CN providing the best results owing to its high CO 2 solubility and favorable H-bonding ability (compared to DMF, as aforementioned for Fe porphyrins 122 ). As expected, the system was limited by the formation of inactive [Ni(CO)(cyclam)] + and Ni(CO) 4 species, which were detected by UV-Vis and FTIR spectroscopy. 237 Albeit achieving lower current densities compared to the flow-cell setups developed for immobilized molecular catalysts in aqueous media, this approach holds promise and, together with further engineering optimization, can be extended to other types of molecular catalysts, or used to pair CO 2 RR with oxidative processes using organic substrates. [Ni(cyclam)] + active species towards H + . As derived by a comparison of the CO 2 /H + binding constants for the two complexes, the protonation of the [Co(HMD)] + complex is favored over CO 2 binding at considerably higher pH values than [Ni(cyclam)] + , resulting in the ability for the latter to selectively catalyze CO 2 RR in a wider pH range. 214,241 Due to the flexibility of the macrocyclic ligand, the [Co(HMD)] 2+ complex exists in the N-rac and N-meso isomeric forms. At room temperature, the isomerization reaction was found to occur slowly for the Co II complexes but much faster for the singly reduced Co I species, rapidly converting the N-meso into the N-rac isomer. 11 The proposed mechanism for CO 2 RR is analogous to the one previously discussed for the [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ catalyst, involving the CO 2 binding at the electrogenerated Co I species. However, the [Co(HMD)] + complex exhibited a much higher affinity for CO 2 in DMSO as compared to the Ni analogue. 220 In contrast to the latter, the reversible CO 2 binding to [Co(HMD)] + resulted in an observable positive shift of the voltammetric Co II/I wave, which allowed the estimation of a K CO 2 as high as 7 Â 10 4 M À1 . Owing to the large value of the CO 2 binding constant, Fujita and co-workers afforded to isolate the [Co(CO 2 )(HMD)] + adduct and thoroughly investigated its electronic structure in CH 3 CN by using a number of spectroscopic techniques, including UV-Vis, FTIR, 1 H-NMR, XANES, laser-flash photolysis and pulse radiolysis. complex. 11,246 The stereochemical features of the Co-CO 2 adduct were found to be critical for the CO 2 binding step, including the conformational geometry of the macrocyclic ligand and the steric hindrance provoked by the methyl groups. 242 Furthermore, an additional stabilization due to intramolecular H-bonding interaction with pendant NH groups was proposed to have a remarkable impact on the CO 2 binding properties of the Co I species. 245 The pivotal role of H-bonding stabilization of the Co-CO 2 intermediate is also consistent with the experimental observation that polar solvents, and in particular water, favorably impact the value of the CO 2 binding constant. 241,247 As aforementioned for the Ni derivatives, Co I tetraazamacrocycles also generally show higher affinity for CO than for CO 2 , owing to a strong p-backdonation from the metal to coordinating CO. The [Co(CO)(HMD)] + complex was isolated and characterized, featuring a five-coordinated square-pyramidal geometry with a significant out-of-plane distortion of the Co center. 248 As previously discussed for [Ni(CO)(cyclam)] + , the flexibility of the HMD ligand contributes to further stabilize the Co-CO bond. It is worth mentioning that diluted CH 3 CN solutions of freshly prepared [Co(CO 2 )(HMD)] + partially decomposed after several days, resulting in the formation of traces of CO and H 2 (derived from adventitious water) in the vessel headspace. 243 A binuclear Co species containing a Co-COOH-Co motif was isolated from the solution and characterized by X-ray crystallography, thus suggesting the possibility that the cooperative effect of a second Co center may be involved in the CO 2 binding step. 249The use of different electrolytes or buffer systems in aqueous media also led to drastic changes in activity and selectivity of [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ . 210 The influence of the buffer identity on the catalytic CO 2 RR activity of [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ was recently studied, revealing the buffer charge to be the main factor affecting the activity and selectivity of the reaction. 231 In particular, small-sized non-coordinating cationic buffers were found to be beneficial for CO 2 RR over HER, suggesting the involvement of pseudo outer coordination sphere effects (electrostatic, protonation, H-bonding interactions, etc.) on the key reaction intermediates.

        <p>This section focuses on the main reported molecular catalysts for CO 2 RR based on non-cyclam macrocyclic ligands, highlighting some fundamental electronic and structural aspects related to the role of the ligand framework in the catalytic CO 2 RR process. A first representative example is given by the Co systems with the N4H ligand (N4H = 2,12-dimethyl-3,7,11,17tetraazabicyclo-[11.3.1]-heptadeca-1(7),2,11,13,15-pentaene), which contains the potentially redox-active pyridyldiimine platform (see Chart 4). In some early studies, Co and Ni complexes of the N4H ligands were found to be relatively poor catalysts for CO 2 RR, suffering from low efficiencies toward CO production and/or a severe HER competition. 208,240,250 Several years later, Peters and co-workers investigated the electrocatalytic behavior of the [Co III (N4H)(Br) 2 ] + complex (46, see Chart 4), with voltammetric data showing a catalytic current for CO 2 reduction upon the formal Co I/0 wave. 251 Bulk electrolysis under CO 2 in aqueous CH 3 CN (10 M H 2 O) resulted in moderate faradaic yields for CO production (FE CO = 45%) together with H 2 evolution (FE H 2 = 30%). Albeit non selective for CO 2 RR to CO, this result is remarkable since the same complex was well-known to efficiently catalyze HER in the absence of CO 2 . 252,253 The fivecoordinated [Co(N4H)(CH 3 CN)] + complex, containing a formal Co I state was chemically generated and found to be a precatalyst for CO 2 RR. Owing to the redox non-innocent character of the N4H moiety, 254 DFT calculations suggested its electronic structure to be best described as a low-spin Co II antiferromagnetically coupled to a ligand radical anion, which was hypothesized to contribute in steering the selectivity towards CO 2 RR over HER. 251 In a later study, in situ FTIR spectroscopy was used to detect the [Co I (N4H)(CO 2 )] + species, selectively generated upon visible-light irradiation of the starting [Co II (N4H)(CH 3 CN)] 2+ complex in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor and a [Ru(bpy) 3 ] 2+ photosensitizer. 255 Intramolecular H-bonding interaction between the N-H of the macrocycle ligand and the oxygen atom of bound CO 2 was proposed to strongly contribute to the stabilization of this adduct, whose formation was found to be critical for the selectivity of the overall CO 2 RR process. This shed light on the crucial role played by the metal-ligand cooperation for CO 2 activation. Moreover, a photochemical treatment of the initial [Co II (N4H)(CH 3 CN)] 2+ complex with [Ir(ppy) 3 ] sensitizer, which has stronger reducing power than [Ru(bpy) 3 ] 2+ , led to the formation of the transient two-electron-reduced [Co I (N4H)(CO 2This section focuses on the main reported molecular catalysts for CO 2 RR based on non-cyclam macrocyclic ligands, highlighting some fundamental electronic and structural aspects related to the role of the ligand framework in the catalytic CO 2 RR process. A first representative example is given by the Co systems with the N4H ligand (N4H = 2,12-dimethyl-3,7,11,17tetraazabicyclo-[11.3.1]-heptadeca-1(7),2,11,13,15-pentaene), which contains the potentially redox-active pyridyldiimine platform (see Chart 4). In some early studies, Co and Ni complexes of the N4H ligands were found to be relatively poor catalysts for CO 2 RR, suffering from low efficiencies toward CO production and/or a severe HER competition. 208,240,250 Several years later, Peters and co-workers investigated the electrocatalytic behavior of the [Co III (N4H)(Br) 2 ] + complex (46, see Chart 4), with voltammetric data showing a catalytic current for CO 2 reduction upon the formal Co I/0 wave. 251 Bulk electrolysis under CO 2 in aqueous CH 3 CN (10 M H 2 O) resulted in moderate faradaic yields for CO production (FE CO = 45%) together with H 2 evolution (FE H 2 = 30%).

        <p>In an effort to rationalize the second coordination sphere effect of pendant amines on the CO 2 RR capability of Co macrocycles, Marinescu and co-workers recently investigated a series of Co complexes based on the macrocyclic azacalix [4](2,6)pyridine framework with different alkyl substituents on the four pendant N-H groups (Chart 4). 119,257 In DMF solution, the complex 47, which contains four secondary amines, showed a catalytic current increase under CO 2 atmosphere upon the Co I/0 wave, resulting in an excellent faradaic yield for CO production (98%) at À2.8 V vs. Fc +/0 in the presence of 1.2 M TFE as exogenous proton source. 119 In sharp contrast, the N-alkylated derivatives (methyl and allyl groups, respectively) containing only tertiary amines displayed negligible catalytic current for CO 2 reduction, despite the fact that the presence of the electron-donating alkyl groups causes a negative shift of the Co I/0 redox potential as compared to 47. Bulk electrolysis data confirmed the latter to be poor CO 2 RR electrocatalysts with low CO faradaic efficiencies, probing the crucial effect of the secondary N-H macrocycle groups on both, the catalytic overpotential and efficiency. An additional experimental-theoretical kinetic analysis on a series of Co complexes featuring varying secondary and tertiary (N-methyl substituents) macrocyclic amines (47-52, see Chart 4), was carried out to further investigate the origin of such boosting effect (Fig. 16a). 257 Unlike 52, the complexes 47-51 showed high CO current densities and FEs (Z90%), resulting in a linear correlation between the catalytic rate constant and the number of secondary amines across the series (Fig. 16b). An analogous rate measured for isomers 49 and 50 indicates that the spatial orientation of the pendant N-H groups has only a minimal effect on the rate, suggesting a non-cooperative effect of the pendant amines. The first step of the proposed catalytic mechanism consists in the two-electron reduction of the initial Co II state to form the formal Co 0 species responsible for CO 2 binding (Fig. 16c). This aspect, which was confirmed by both experimental and theoretical data, is in contrast with the behavior shown by the cyclam-like Co systems, whereby the nucleophile Co I species is able to bind to the substrate. 11 Moreover, owing to the conformational strain of the azacalix [4](2,6)pyridine macrocycle, the pendant N-H groups were predicted to exert an unfavorable intramolecular H-bonding to the bound CO 2 molecule. Instead, the steric repulsion of the N-methyl groups was found to have a major effect on CO 2 binding. In analogy with the tetrazamacrocycle Co systems, 246 DFT calculations suggest that an intramolecular charge transfer from the Co center to CO 2 stabilizes the Co-CO 2 adduct. The CO 2 binding is followed by two sequential protonation steps (EECC mechanism), with the latter being the ratelimiting step, forming H 2 O and a Co II -CO intermediate, which undergoes a facile release of CO. Theory confirmed the involvement of the secondary pendant amines in the second rate-limiting protonation step, assisting the intermolecular H + transfer from the acid to the bound COOH, rather than via an intramolecular H + transfer from the N-H group to COOH. 257 As previously discussed for heme and tetrazamamacrocyclic complexes, a planar and rigid geometry of the ligand framework is particularly suitable for a molecular catalyst to promote an efficient CO 2 RR. In particular, the beneficial role of macrocyclic platforms, also known as ''macrocyclic effect'', generally results in an improved catalyst durability and overall efficiency of the process. Jurss and co-workers have recently investigated the effect of structural rigidity on the electronic and catalytic properties of the metal center in a series of Co and Ni complexes bearing redox-active ligands based on bipyridyl-Nheterocyclic carbene (NHC) moieties (Chart 4 and Fig. 17). 258,259 In these studies, Ni and Co complexes based on 16-and 15-membered macrocyclic ligands (53-X and 54-X with X = Ni, Co, respectively, see Chart 4) displaying different rigidity were explored for electrocatalytic CO 2 RR and compared with the corresponding non-macrocyclic analogues (indicated as bpy-NHC-X, X = Ni, Co, see Fig. 17 nature of the 1e À reduced species, which was calculated to be metal-centered for the flexible bpy-NHC-Ni system and ligandbased for the more constrained 54-Ni complex. In other words, the flexible open platform leads to a more nucleophilic Ni center upon the first electron uptake, favoring the formation of a Ni-hydride intermediate responsible for the observed selectivity loss. 258 The same reactivity trend was also observed for the Co series, with enhanced FE, TOF and activity for CO production found for more rigid macrocyclic platforms. 259 In particular, a stark difference was observed by comparing the bulk electrolysis data obtained in aqueous media (pH 4.2) on a Hg pool electrode (Fig. 17c). The more planar 54-Co system exhibited excellent CO selectivity over HER, in contrast to the openchained bpy-NHC-Co catalyst which resulted in the production of an approximately 1 : 1 CO : H 2 gas mixture. In a similar fashion as [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ , a reductive adsorption of the molecular catalysts over the Hg electrode surface was found to occur. As for the Ni cogeners, the structural features of the ligand scaffolds directly affected the electronic structure and reactivity of the reduced Co complexes, allowing to build-up a structurereactivity relationship. However, unlike the Ni counterparts, the first electron uptake was found to be ligand-based for all of the Co complexes. On the contrary, the nature of the second reduction markedly differs across the series, being ligandbased for bpy-NHC-Co and metal-centered for 54-Co. Thus, for the Co series, more rigid ligand frameworks contribute to increase the nucleophilicity of the Co center in the 2e À reduced species, thus favoring the CO 2 binding step and increasing the selectivity towards CO 2 RR. In contrast with the trend observed for the Ni and Co tetraazamacrocycles, the Co derivatives with bipyridyl-NHC ligands revealed to be better catalysts for CO 2 RR to CO compared to their Ni analogues in terms of overpotential, activity and selectivity in the presence of H 2 O. From one side, these examples highlight the crucial role of the redox noninnocent character and geometry of the ligand in catalysis. On the other hand, the differences in the electronic structure observed for Ni and Co macrocycles bearing the same ligand platform suggests that the nature of the metal center also has a strong influence on the reactivity towards CO 2 RR. In some cases, a simple change of the metal center may lead to a drastic change in the product distribution for CO 2 RR. For example, the Co complex bearing a pentadentate N5 pyridine-diimine macrocycle (55-Co) was reported as a selective catalyst for CO 2 electroreduction to CO in DMF, whereas the Fe counterpart (55-Fe) produced HCOO À in high faradaic yields. 260 The origin of such a drastic change of selectivity was ascribed to the poor p-donating properties of the active Fe site, which stabilizes a Z 1 -OCOH adduct.In an effort to rationalize the second coordination sphere effect of pendant amines on the CO 2 RR capability of Co macrocycles, Marinescu and co-workers recently investigated a series of Co complexes based on the macrocyclic azacalix [4](2,6)pyridine framework with different alkyl substituents on the four pendant N-H groups (Chart 4). 119,257 In DMF solution, the complex 47, which contains four secondary amines, showed a catalytic current increase under CO 2 atmosphere upon the Co I/0 wave, resulting in an excellent faradaic yield for CO production (98%) at À2.8 V vs. Fc +/0 in the presence of 1.2 M TFE as exogenous proton source. 119 In sharp contrast, the N-alkylated derivatives (methyl and allyl groups, respectively) containing only tertiary amines displayed negligible catalytic current for CO 2 reduction, despite the fact that the presence of the electron-donating alkyl groups causes a negative shift of the Co I/0 redox potential as compared to 47.

        <p>Lu and co-workers recently described a non-cyclam Ni II tripodal homogeneous electrocatalyst (56, see Chart 5) exhibiting a remarkable selectivity toward CO production in DMF/H 2 O mixtures even in the presence of relevant amounts of added water. 261 The origin of the high intrinsic affinity for CO 2 over H + and robustness of 56 compared to other analogous molecular complexes, was ascribed to the strong basicity of the ligand, containing the methylated benzimidazole donors. The redoxinnocent character of the ligand strongly enhances the nucleophilicity of the Ni I center which readily binds CO 2 , as suggested by an observable positive shift of the voltammetric Ni II/I wave under CO 2 -saturated conditions. The product distribution could be tuned in a controlled manner by modulating the applied potential, affording syngas mixtures with a CO : H 2 ratio of 1 : 1 or 1 : 2 at more negative potentials, likely due to the partial contribution of the less CO 2 RR selective Ni I/0 wave. 261 The majority of the non-heme Fe electrocatalysts studied for CO 2 RR displayed high or moderate faradaic efficiencies for formate production, including a highly selective iron carbonyl cluster catalyst 69,262,263 and Fe complexes with bipyridinecontaining Schiff base ligands, 264,265 phenanthroline derivatives 266 or macrocyclic nitrogen platforms. 260 Recently, a series of Fe II complexes supported by polydentate bipyridyl-based platforms bearing different functional groups in the second coordination sphere, were explored for CO 2 RR. 267 Among them, the only system showing a high selectivity for CO production in aqueous CH 3 CN (FE CO = 81%; FE H 2 = 11%) was a derivative featuring a pendant secondary amine group (57). An increased acidity of the intramolecular proton relay (phenolic functionality) was found to dramatically enhance the H 2 evolution process. It is noteworthy that changes in the CO 2 RR selectivity induced by appended groups in the second coordination sphere have been recently reported also for molecular Mn catalysts. [268][269][270][271] Moreover, a non-heme Fe complex with a tetradentate dicarboxamide N4 in-plane ligand (58), recently showed a high selectivity for CO 2 electroreduction to CO as a homogeneous electrocatalyst in DMF/2% H 2 O solvent mixture. 272 In addition, the complex was immobilized on N-doped graphene (N-G) by refluxing a DMF solution of 58 in the presence of suspended N-G platelets. It was suggested that this procedure induced immobilization of 58 on N-G via axial coordination by N dopants of the graphene support to the Fe centers, promoted by the p-p stacking interaction between the planar ligand framework of the complex and the graphene layer. The heterogeneous catalyst supported on a GC electrode resulted in an efficient and selective CO 2 conversion to CO (FE CO = 90%) in aqueous media (pH = 7.3) at À0.58 V vs. RHE. 272 Among the earth-abundant transition metal molecular catalysts containing alternative polydentate platforms, the polypyridyl, aminopyridyl or tripodal cobalt complexes are perhaps the most widely studied systems. In general, the reported activity and selectivity of these catalysts strongly varies depending on the ligand framework and the specific operating reaction conditions. For instance, Che and co-workers recently reported a series of Co complexes with tetradentate N donor ligands for the electro-and photocatalytic CO 2 RR. 273 Among those systems, only the cis-[Co(PDP)Cl 2 ] complex (59, PDP = 1,1 0 -bis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-2,2 0bipyrrolidine) displayed a selective electrocatalytic CO production in CH 3 CN, albeit the FE CO was found to progressively decrease over time during electrolysis. Contrariwise, the other complexes of the series supported by similar ligands displayed very poor electrocatalytic properties for CO 2 RR, resulting in the formation of only traces of CO. 273 In another comparative study, a family of tripodal Co II complexes containing pyridyl or less basic quinolyl groups displayed variable ability for a selective CO 2 -to-CO conversion under electrochemical conditions, with the complexes 60 and 61 showing the best performances (FE CO = 58-72% and 84%, respectively). 274 Furthermore, a number of polypyridyl Co complexes were reported to suffer from very low faradaic yields for CO production (r30%), 275,276 which are not related to competitive HER or to alternative CO 2 RR pathways. In addition, moderate durability in long-term electrolysis is generally reported even for some CO-selective Co systems, suggesting a possible CO deactivation pathway. 119 In an effort to rationalize the electrocatalytic CO 2 RR behaviour of aminopyridyl Co catalysts, Lloret-Fillol and co-workers recently reported a compelling experimental-computational mechanistic study on the model [Co(L N4 )](OTf) 2 complex (62, L N4 = 1-[2-pyridylmethyl]-4,7-dimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane), elucidating its reactivity towards CO 2 at different redox potentials. 277 Owing to the highly basic character of the L N4 ligand, both experimental and computational data indicate that the nucleophilic Co I species is able to undergo CO 2 binding and C-O bond cleavage steps at the Co II/I redox potential in anhydrous CH 3 CN, leading to the formation of the key [Co(CO)(L N4 )] + complex. This pivotal intermediate, analogously to the deactivating carbonyl species observed in the case of [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ (vide supra), was in situ detected under electrochemical conditions and thoroughly characterized by a combination of spectroscopic and SEC techniques (UV-Vis, FTIR). However, the endergonicity of the CO release step from [Co(CO)(L N4 )] + prevented the observation of an electrocatalytic CO 2 RR behavior at low overpotentials. Under pure electrochemical conditions, a catalytic CO production can be achieved only at more negative potentials (close to the formal Co I/0 couple), required for further reduction of [Co(CO)(L N4 )] + , giving rise to a proposed alternative pathway based on the binding of another CO 2 molecule at the Co center (Fig. 18, blue). In contrast, an efficient catalysis was observed at the Co II/I redox potential under photochemical conditions, in which the more favorable CO release from the [Co(CO)(L N4 )] 2+ intermediate was proposed to be kinetically favored over the competitive diffusioncontrolled electron transfer to form [Co(CO)(L N4 )] + (Fig. 18, green). 277 The beneficial effect of visible-light irradiation on catalysis was further demonstrated by a substantial improvement of the observed FE for CO production during bulk electrolysis upon irradiation, suggesting that light-assisted electrocatalysis is an effective strategy to alleviate CO inhibition limitation. It is also worth noting that several reported Co aminopyridyl catalysts showed optimal performances under photochemical 273,274,278,279 or photoelectrochemical 280 conditions compared to pure electrochemical conditions.Lu and co-workers recently described a non-cyclam Ni II tripodal homogeneous electrocatalyst (56, see Chart 5) exhibiting a remarkable selectivity toward CO production in DMF/H 2 O mixtures even in the presence of relevant amounts of added water. 261 The origin of the high intrinsic affinity for CO 2 over H + and robustness of 56 compared to other analogous molecular complexes, was ascribed to the strong basicity of the ligand, containing the methylated benzimidazole donors.

Contrariwise, the other complexes of the series supported by similar ligands displayed very poor electrocatalytic properties for CO 2 RR, resulting in the formation of only traces of CO. 273 In another comparative study, a family of tripodal Co II complexes containing pyridyl or less basic quinolyl groups displayed variable ability for a selective CO 2 -to-CO conversion under electrochemical conditions, with the complexes 60 and 61 showing the best performances (FE CO = 58-72% and 84%, respectively). 274 Furthermore, a number of polypyridyl Co complexes were reported to suffer from very low faradaic yields for CO production (r30%), 275,276 which are not related to competitive HER or to alternative CO 2 RR pathways. In addition, moderate durability in long-term electrolysis is generally reported even for some CO-selective Co systems, suggesting a possible CO deactivation pathway. 119 In an effort to rationalize the electrocatalytic CO 2 RR behaviour of aminopyridyl Co catalysts, Lloret-Fillol and co-workers recently reported a compelling experimental-computational mechanistic study on the model [Co(L N4 )](OTf) 2 complex (62, L N4 = 1-[2-pyridylmethyl]-4,7-dimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane), elucidating its reactivity towards CO 2 at different redox potentials. 277 Owing to the highly basic character of the L N4 ligand, both experimental and computational data indicate that the nucleophilic Co I species is able to undergo CO 2 binding and C-O bond cleavage steps at the Co II/I redox potential in anhydrous CH 3 CN, leading to the formation of the key [Co(CO)(L N4 )] + complex.

In contrast, an efficient catalysis was observed at the Co II/I redox potential under photochemical conditions, in which the more favorable CO release from the [Co(CO)(L N4 )] 2+ intermediate was proposed to be kinetically favored over the competitive diffusioncontrolled electron transfer to form [Co(CO)(L N4 )] + (Fig. 18, green). 277 The beneficial effect of visible-light irradiation on catalysis was further demonstrated by a substantial improvement of the observed FE for CO production during bulk electrolysis upon irradiation, suggesting that light-assisted electrocatalysis is an effective strategy to alleviate CO inhibition limitation. It is also worth noting that several reported Co aminopyridyl catalysts showed optimal performances under photochemical 273,274,278,279 or photoelectrochemical 280 conditions compared to pure electrochemical conditions.</p>
        <p>A strikingly similar CO inhibition process has been reported to affect also the electrocatalytic performances of the non-heme [Fe(qpy)] 2+ complex (63-Fe, qpy = 2,2 0 :6 0 ,2 00 :6 00 ,2 0 0 0 -quaterpyridine). 281 In CH 3 CN, the electrochemically generated Fe I species engages a fast and irreversible CO 2 binding and, after protonation and reductive C-O bond cleavage, leads to the formation of a [Fe(CO)(qpy)] + adduct. Analogously to 62, the CO release from [Fe(CO)(qpy)] + was found to compete with its further oneelectron reduction to form the inactive neutral [Fe(CO)(qpy)] 0 species, detected by UV-Vis and FTIR-SEC. Such a deactivation process led to a low FE CO (48%) obtained during controlledpotential electrolysis at À1.2 V vs. SCE in the presence of 1 M PhOH, even though the system displayed an excellent CO selectivity over HER. A substantial improvement of the faradaic yield (70%) was gathered by using the light-assisted strategy. 281 Moreover, 63-Fe revealed to be a very efficient and selective catalyst for visible light-driven CO 2 conversion to CO in pure homogeneous photochemical conditions 282 as well as in a hybrid system mixed with mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride. 283 Notably, the Co quaterpyridine derivative, [Co(qpy)] 2+ (63-Co), displayed excellent electrocatalytic performances without any evidence of inhibition by CO poisoning. 281 In the presence of a large excess of added exogenous acid (3 M PhOH), the oneelectron reduced Co I species reversibly binds two molecules of PhOH in axial position, forming the [Co I (qpy)(PhOH) 2 ] + complex. Further reduction of the latter leads to the doublyreduced active [Co I (qpy À )(PhOH) 2 ] species (the second electron is likely to be delocalized on the qpy moiety), responsible for a selective CO production (FE CO = 94%) at a very low overpotential (À1.1 V vs. SCE, Z = 140 mV). Owing to the high observed catalytic rates and low overpotential, 63-Co favorably compares with the most active reported molecular catalysts for CO 2 RR to CO and closely matches the performance of the highly efficient Fe 0 porphyrins (see Fig. 19). 281 In a related study, the use of high scan-rate cyclic voltammetry (up to 500 V s À1 ) shed light on the presence of an alternative reaction pathway dominant at low PhOH concentrations (o1.5 M). 284 This mechanism, occurring at higher overpotential (Z = 600 mV), is based on the formation of the active three-electron reduced [Co(qpy)] À species, which may undergo hydride formation with subsequent selectivity loss. Furthermore, the precursor [Co I (qpy À )] species readily adsorbed on the electrode surface, as already reported in earlier studies. 285 Overall, high concentrations of added PhOH were found to enhance CO selectivity over HER, decrease the overpotential and prevent intermediate adsorption on the electrode surface. An analogous beneficial effect of the added proton source on the catalyst stability was also observed for other classes of molecular Co catalysts. 286 Owing to the flat, conjugated geometry of the qpy ligand, [Co(qpy)] 2+ was successfully immobilized on MWCNTs, leading to one of the most efficient heterogenized molecular catalysts reported so far for CO 2 RR to CO in aqueous media. 287 At close to neutral pH (7.3), the [Co(qpy)] 2+ /MWCNTs electrode was able to quantitatively produce CO from CO 2 with excellent durability and at a very low applied overpotential (À0.35 V vs. RHE, Z = 240 mV).A strikingly similar CO inhibition process has been reported to affect also the electrocatalytic performances of the non-heme [Fe(qpy)] 2+ complex (63-Fe, qpy = 2,2 0 :6 0 ,2 00 :6 00 ,2 0 0 0 -quaterpyridine). 281 In CH 3 CN, the electrochemically generated Fe I species engages a fast and irreversible CO 2 binding and, after protonation and reductive C-O bond cleavage, leads to the formation of a [Fe(CO)(qpy)] + adduct.

        <p>The examples of macrocyclic and non-macrocyclic molecular systems discussed in this section suggest that both, electronic and structural factors should be taken into consideration to avoid CO inhibition, since flexible ligand geometries and electron-rich metal centers both contribute to stabilize CO adducts. In a recent study, McCrory and co-workers explored the catalytic behavior of a series of Co complexes with bis-(pyridylmonoimine)-based ligands of varying degrees of flexibility, suggesting a direct correlation between structural flexibility and catalytic CO 2 RR activity. 288 In particular, a structurally rigid and quasi-planar catalyst (complex 64 in Chart 5) was shown to feature a more negative onset potential for the catalytic wave but also the highest efficiency toward CO production in the presence of high amounts of an added proton source. On the other hand, derivatives with structurally more flexible architectures (65-67) resulted in a more positive onset potentials for catalysis, but at the expense of considerably lower FE CO values. As indicated by the higher CO binding equilibrium constants, lower CO dissociation constants and decreased activity under CO 2 /CO gas mixtures, the flexible Co systems were found to be more prone to CO poisoning during catalysis through the formation of stable Co I -CO carbonyl species, which was ascribed as the origin of the diminished overall activity. 288The examples of macrocyclic and non-macrocyclic molecular systems discussed in this section suggest that both, electronic and structural factors should be taken into consideration to avoid CO inhibition, since flexible ligand geometries and electron-rich metal centers both contribute to stabilize CO adducts.

        <p>Single-atom catalysts (SACs) typically define a class of materials based on highly dispersed monometallic active sites embedded on a 2D conductive surface. The active site of SACs comprises not only the isolated single transition metal atom but also its three-or four-fold anchoring sites (typically C or N atoms), which mimic the role of the first coordination shell in molecular catalysis. 294 So far, the overwhelming majority of the SACs reported for CO 2 RR are based on M-N-C materials, whereby atomically dispersed 1st row transition metals are incorporated onto N-doped carbon supports. 295 The nature of the metal center and the structural features of the coordinative environment were found to strongly affect the CO 2 RR performance in terms of activity, selectivity and overpotential. The compact M-N 3 or M-N 4 configurations confined on a single carbon plane are the most commonly proposed moieties for the catalytic site of SACs, being reminiscent of the structures of molecular complexes with macrocyclic ligands employed as efficient catalysts for CO 2 conversion to CO (Chart 6). However, although the effect of the surrounding carbon matrix has received considerably less attention, some groups have hypothesized a non-innocent role of the carbon atoms spatially close to the active site in the catalytic process. 296,297 Hence, the SAC approach represents a promising strategy to tailor the electronic structure of the active site as means of controlling the reactivity toward CO 2 RR. In comparison with the corresponding metal-based bulk materials or NPs, 14,[298][299][300] SAC systems generally possess unique catalytic properties, selectively promoting CO 2 RR over the competing HER in aqueous media. Recently, single-metal porphyrin-like sites were predicted to hinder the HER by forcing an on-top *H adsorption as compared to the more energetically favorable hollow site binding of hydrogen on a bulk metal catalyst surface. 301 Mixing bulk materials and SACs can even be exploited to controllably adjust the H 2 /CO ratio, which could be used as further feedstock for the Fischer-Tropsch process.Single-atom catalysts (SACs) typically define a class of materials based on highly dispersed monometallic active sites embedded on a 2D conductive surface.

        <p>Despite the major benefits of SACs revealing high selectivity with maximal metal atom utilization, challenges related to the synthesis and structural characterization emerge. The availability, exclusivity and distribution of the SAC motifs on the prepared sample are critical for the development of SACs. Advanced characterization techniques like electron microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy or scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) can assist the design and the investigation of single-atom structures. In particular, aberration corrected TEM and high-angle annular dark-field STEM (HAADF-STEM) are common techniques used for the determination of the size and distribution of isolated metal atoms and to extract the local structural information. 36 Moreover, synchrotron radiation techniques allow the investigation of the overall chemical environment of the single metal atoms. A further challenge is the possible non-uniform functionalization of the carbon structure, which leads to a variety of active sites and their irregular distribution on the support. 302 In the case of M-N-C materials, a number of different nitrogen atom functionalities (e.g. pyrrolic, pyridinic, graphitic, etc.) are potential competitive coordination sites for the metal or may act themselves as metal-free catalytic sites for CO 2 RR, changing neutrality, altering charge and spin densities and promoting thermodynamic stability. 296,[303][304][305] Furthermore, aggregation phenomena should be considered in the investigation of SACs. Indeed, SACs tend to aggregate into clusters or NPs during the catalytic process or storage due to their thermodynamic instability, high surface free energies and low coordination. Therefore, their stability under reaction conditions should be demonstrated. Other factors related to the reaction conditions, such as pH and electrolyte, may also have a strong influence on their catalytic response.Despite the major benefits of SACs revealing high selectivity with maximal metal atom utilization, challenges related to the synthesis and structural characterization emerge.

        <p>In a recent study, a series of M-N-C model catalysts with different earth-abundant transition metals (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) have been explored for CO 2 RR in aqueous media, in order to systematically rationalize the effect of the nature of the metal center on the catalytic activity and selectivity. 306 All the materials featured atomically dispersed in-plane M-N 4 moieties, with negligible structural and morphological differences across the series. This allowed a direct correlation between the CO 2 RR performances and the type of metal (alternative configurations with one or two adsorbed axial H 2 O molecules have also been considered, M-N 4 -H 2 O). The catalytic CO 2 RR tests at À0.5 V and À0.6 V vs. RHE (pH 6.7), resulted in a volcano-like diagram, with the Fe-N-C and Co-N-C catalysts being the most active (partial j CO ), depending on the applied potential (Fig. 20a andb). However, the Fe-, Mn-and Ni-N-C catalysts revealed to be the most selective toward CO production across the series (FE CO 4 80%), whereas the high current densities for the Co-N-C counterpart predominantly accounted for H 2 evolution (Fig. 20a). Operando XANES was also performed to monitor the changes in the oxidation state under catalytic conditions, suggesting that it remained unchanged during CO 2 RR for Co(2+) and Mn. It was partially reduced for Fe and Ni (from 3+/2+ to 2+ for Fe, and from 2+ to 1+ for Ni), while it was strongly reduced to Cu 0 in the case of Cu. 306 The experimental results were rationalized by using DFT calculations, which modeled the binding energies of the key intermediates involved in the CO 2 RR process, according to four elementary steps: (i) CO 2 + e À -*CO 2 À ; (ii) *CO 2 À + H + -*COOH; (iii) *COOH + H + + e À -*CO + H 2 O; (iv) *CO -CO. The rate-determining step (RDS) was found to be highly dependent on the nature of the metal center, being the *CO desorption step (step iv) for Mn-N 4 and Fe-N 4 moieties or the CO 2 activation and first electron transfer for Ni-N 4 and Cu-N 4 (step i). In the series, the Co-N 4 sites showed an optimum balance between the energy barriers for CO 2 activation and CO desorption. In particular, the CO 2 RR activity across the series was rationalized in terms of the Gibbs free energy change at the rate-determining step (E RDS ), resulting in a volcano trend analogous to the experimental one (Fig. 20b). 306 According to this diagram, M 2+ -N 4 -H 2 O sites were proposed as the most active centers in Fe-N-C and Co-N-C, whereas the Ni 1+ -N 4 configuration was predicted to be the most active in Ni-N-C, in analogy to the macrocyclic Ni molecular catalysts (see Section 4.1.1). Moreover, the difference between the binding energies for *CO 2 À and *H was proposed as a suitable descriptor to predict selectivity toward CO production, showing a direct correlation to the number of d-antibonding electrons, which is determined by the basic principles of coordination chemistry according to the crystal field splitting theory (Fig. 20c andd). 306 Following this approach, the high selectivity experimentally observed for Fe and Ni catalysts could be reproduced, as well as the more favourable HER promoted by Co-N-C. 306 This representative example shows the crucial role played by the metal center in determining the catalytic activity and selectivity of a series of single-site catalysts featuring similar coordinative environments.

Most of these reports mainly focus on the development of novel synthetic procedures to obtain efficient Ni-N-C catalysts, aiming to preserve coordinatively unsaturated Ni-N sites confined into N-doped 2D materials. [307][308][309] The most common synthetic approach consists in a simple pyrolysis of a Ni salt with N-doped carbon materials obtained from N-rich organic molecules. For instance, the dispersion of Ni sites in a N-doped carbon matrix obtained from dicyandiamide and 2-methylimidazole led to a catalyst displaying maximum FE CO 97% at À0.9 V vs. RHE. 309 In another study, an increased content of pyrrolic-N centers in N-doped carbon hollow spheres was obtained by modulating the concentration of the melamine precursor, remarkably increasing the density of Ni sites and, in turn, the catalytic CO 2 RR activity. 310 Metal-organic Ni complexes containing nitrogen ligands, such as [Zn(Ni)-bidppz] (bidppz = 11,11 0 -bis(dipyrido[3,2-a:2 0 ,3 0 -c]phenazinyl)) 308 or Ni(NH 3 ) 6 I 2 , 311 were also employed as suitable precursors to achieve robust Ni-N-C SACs for selective CO 2 -to-CO reduction.

        <p>Further research provided a more in-depth structural characterization of the Ni-N 4 active site and their role in the CO 2 RR, revealing several similarities with the molecular Ni-based N4 macrocyclic systems. Recently, a detailed XAS and XPS study allowed the elucidation of the structural features of the active moiety in a robust and highly CO-selective Ni SAC dispersed on an N-doped graphene matrix (A-Ni-NG, see Fig. 21). 313 The isolated Ni-N 4 moieties displayed a distorted square-planar geometry which deviates from the canonical D 4h symmetry typical of the NiPc molecular derivative. Moreover, XAS and EPR measurements confirmed the presence of monovalent paramagnetic Ni I centers with a 3d 9 , S = 1/2 electronic configuration, which possess a high intrinsic reactivity due to the partially filled 3d supposed to be at the origin of the CO inhibition phenomenon affecting the homogeneous Ni-cyclam system. 217 The geometrical constraints forced by the graphene framework may prevent an excessive distortion of the square-planar cyclam-like Ni active site, ensuring a more efficient CO release step as compared to the Ni-cyclam homogeneous counterpart. As above mentioned, the electrode-flattened cyclam structure of the adsorbed [Ni(cyclam)-(CO)] + complex has been proposed to be responsible for the enhanced catalytic rates observed for [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ on a Hg electrode in comparison with the homogeneous derivative. 217,226 Analogous trends correlating the planarity of the ligand scaffold to a more efficient CO release step were also previously discussed for other families of molecular catalysts (see Section 4). 288 The unique properties of Ni-N 4 motifs in promoting an efficient CO 2 RR have been demonstrated in several other recent reports. These materials are generally obtained by facile adsorption of Ni 2+ ions on N-doped graphene 314 or a porous carbon matrix. 315 However, well-defined organometallic Ni complexes containing pre-formed Ni-N 4 coordination units can be adopted as single-site precursors of SACs, being the source of both, metal and nitrogen at a time. Notably, the local coordination environment of the active site in the Ni SAC is highly dependent on the structure of the original complex precursor and the type of support material. For instance, the annealing of a Ni complex with a flexible tripodal nitrogen ligand led to a SAC containing distorted square-planar Ni II -N 4 species uniformly dispersed over GO sheets, which displayed superior CO 2 RR performance than the molecular derivative. 316 The presence of GO in the synthetic process was found to play an essential role in preventing the formation of metallic bulk NPs which reduce the catalytic activity.Further research provided a more in-depth structural characterization of the Ni-N 4 active site and their role in the CO 2 RR, revealing several similarities with the molecular Ni-based N4 macrocyclic systems.

As above mentioned, the electrode-flattened cyclam structure of the adsorbed [Ni(cyclam)-(CO)] + complex has been proposed to be responsible for the enhanced catalytic rates observed for [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ on a Hg electrode in comparison with the homogeneous derivative. 217,226 Analogous trends correlating the planarity of the ligand scaffold to a more efficient CO release step were also previously discussed for other families of molecular catalysts (see Section 4). 288 The unique properties of Ni-N 4 motifs in promoting an efficient CO 2 RR have been demonstrated in several other recent reports. These materials are generally obtained by facile adsorption of Ni 2+ ions on N-doped graphene 314 or a porous carbon matrix. 315 However, well-defined organometallic Ni complexes containing pre-formed Ni-N 4 coordination units can be adopted as single-site precursors of SACs, being the source of both, metal and nitrogen at a time. Notably, the local coordination environment of the active site in the Ni SAC is highly dependent on the structure of the original complex precursor and the type of support material. For instance, the annealing of a Ni complex with a flexible tripodal nitrogen ligand led to a SAC containing distorted square-planar Ni II -N 4 species uniformly dispersed over GO sheets, which displayed superior CO 2 RR performance than the molecular derivative. 316 The presence of GO in the synthetic process was found to play an essential role in preventing the formation of metallic bulk NPs which reduce the catalytic activity.</p>
        <p>In another study, a Ni SAC synthesized by C-C coupling of a Ni phthalocyanine precursor (NiTAPc) with CNTs served as a model system to investigate the mechanism for electrochemical CO 2 RR. 317 This approach resulted in the formation of uniformly distributed Ni-N 4 moieties with a canonical D 4h symmetry and Ni II oxidation state, almost identical to the original sites of the NiTAPc precursor. A combination of operando XAS, operando Raman and NAP-XPS provided insights into the dynamic changes of the electronic state of Ni during CO 2 RR, indicating that the initial Ni II species does not interact with CO 2 , yet the low-valent reduced Ni I state is the species responsible for CO 2 activation. These results are consistent with those previously discussed for another Ni SAC (vide supra) and establish a direct correlation with the behavior of molecular Ni cyclam-like systems whereby the Ni I state is the catalytically active species. 11 The proposed pathway for CO 2 RR to CO on the Ni SAC is analogous to the one proposed for molecular Ni catalysts with N4 macrocyclic ligands (see Scheme 2). 215 even more challenging. In particular, the role of C species in the coordination of the Ni atoms has been considered. Wang and co-workers explored the CO 2 RR performances of different Ni sites in graphene vacancies containing various Ni-C/Ni-N coordination environments. 318 They observed that the incorporation of N-dopants induced remarkable changes in the morphology of the Ni sites but also greatly improved the selectivity towards CO production. More recently, a general host-guest cooperative protection strategy based on the introduction of polypyrrole into bimetallic MgNi-MOF-74, followed by a pyrolysis step, allowed to obtain Ni SACs with tunable N/C coordination by controlling the annealing temperature. 319 The hybrid Ni SA -N 2 -C material with the lowest N coordination number (2) showed the best performance across the series, affording a maximum FE CO 98% at À0.8 V vs. RHE. By using theoretical and experimental tools, Yamauchi and co-workers systematically investigated a series of hybrid Ni-N x C 4Àx (x = 0-4) moieties containing different combinations of coordinating N or C atoms in an attempt to elucidate the role of C atoms on the structural and catalytic properties of Ni N-C SACs. 320 For each configuration, the thermodynamic barrier associated to each of the three elementary steps of the CO 2 RR pathway were compared, i.e. the *COOH formation (* + CO 2 + H + + e À -*COOH), the *CO formation (*COOH + H + + e À -*CO + H 2 O) and CO desorption (*CO -* + CO). Looking at the electronic structure, it was found that C-rich configurations tend to lead to an increase in the electron density over the Ni atom, favouring the CO 2 activation step at the expense of a stronger interaction with adsorbed CO. On the other hand, an increase in the N coordination number facilitates the CO desorption step, yet limiting the nucleophilicity of the Ni center. Overall, the Ni-N 4 sites are limited by the first electrochemical step, showing the highest barrier for *COOH formation, whereas CO desorption is energetically unfavorable for Ni-C 4 moieties. Therefore, the Ni-N 2 C 2 configuration was predicted to be the optimum structure for CO 2 RR, displaying the best compromise between these opposite tendencies. The experimental data corroborated the theoretical predictions, since Ni-N-C materials containing mixed N/C coordination synthesized at intermediate carbonization temperatures provided the best results in terms of activity and selectivity towards CO production. 320 Interestingly, the coordinative motif of Ni-N 2 C 2 moieties homogeneously dispersed on a 2D graphene layer shows structural analogies with an efficient homogeneous Ni catalyst bearing a macrocyclic ligand based on a redox-active 2,2 0 -bipyridyl core and electron-rich N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) donors (54-Ni), previously discussed in the Section 4.2. 258 In particular, the optimal 15-membered macrocyclic configuration forced the molecular Ni system 54-Ni to a distorted square-planar arrangement which is consistent with synchrothron-based experimental data on analogous Ni-N 2 C 2 SACs. 320 For the molecular Ni derivative 54-Ni, the contribution of the quasi-planar ligand environment to extra-electron delocalization revealed to be decisive to prevent the formation of a metal-hydride species.In another study, a Ni SAC synthesized by C-C coupling of a Ni phthalocyanine precursor (NiTAPc) with CNTs served as a model system to investigate the mechanism for electrochemical CO 2 RR. 317 This approach resulted in the formation of uniformly distributed Ni-N 4 moieties with a canonical D 4h symmetry and Ni II oxidation state, almost identical to the original sites of the NiTAPc precursor.

        <p>The question on the optimal coordination structure in Ni-N-C SACs is however still under debate, due to the possible heterogeneities that can be found in the real materials, as well as the extreme difficulty to unambiguously characterize experimentally the local coordinative environment of a catalyst and to precisely control its structure/composition through synthetic parameters. Moreover, DFT calculations based on the so called Computational Hydrogen Electrode (CHE) model may also lead to an oversimplified description of the system. 322 Recently, the kinetic barriers for the CO 2 RR pathway promoted by several hybrid Ni-N/C coordination sites were calculated by using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), proposing the mixed Ni-N 1 C 3 configuration to be the most active and selective site for CO 2 RR. 322 Importantly, the study shed light on the site charge capacity and the H-bonding interactions as the crucial factors determining the activity and selectivity of a given SAC. The former describes the number of charges the site can carry and contributes to lower the barrier for the electrochemical steps, yet might be detrimental for an efficient CO desorption. Furthermore, the H-bonding interactions with water molecules of the medium are essential to assist the initial chemisorption of CO 2 on the surface, stabilize the intermediates and facilitate the protonation steps. It is remarkable to note that the beneficial effect of cooperative H-bonding interactions on CO 2 RR was demonstrated for the [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ molecular catalyst in water and in organic electrolytes (Section 4.1). 230 In particular, the presence of an urea-based exogenous additive led to a significant enhancement of the catalytic response of [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ due to its ability to form cooperative multipoint hydrogen-bond interactions (Fig. 14), without altering the selectivity of the process. Moreover, we have already discussed the beneficial role of water or polar solvents on CO 2 binding, activation and conversion observed for Ni and Co tetraazamacrocyclic complexes (Section 4.1). 11,210,243,247 In contrast with the predominant literature on Ni N-C SACs, some reports have suggested that coordinatively unsaturated Ni-N moieties are preferential catalytic sites for CO 2 binding and conversion, decreasing the affinity for HER. 323,324 For example, some Ni-N active sites confined on porous carbon with different coordination numbers were synthesized by pyrolysis of a Zn/Ni bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), displaying a high CO selectivity (FEs 92-98%) over a broad potential window (À0.53 V to À1.03 V vs. RHE). In agreement with the low Ni coordination numbers experimentally observed by EXAFS analysis, computational data suggested that unsaturated Ni-N 2 V 2 (V stands for coordination vacancy) possess a lower free energy for the formation of the *COOH intermediate as compared to the Ni-N 4 sites. 324 An impregnation-pyrolysis method using a highly-defective sponge-templated GO support was suggested to favor the formation of analogous coordinatively unsaturated Ni sites, due to the trapping of Ni atoms in the material defects. 325 In another study, a pyrrolic Ni-N 3 moiety was proposed as the catalytically relevant configuration for a highly active Ni SAC confined within a porous N-doped carbon sheath. 326 Nakanishi and co-workers adopted a Covalent Triazine Framework (CTF), consisting of microporous conjugated polymers with 1,3,5triazine linker units, as a suitable platform to favor the formation of coordinatively unsaturated metal SACs. 327 Upon the impregnation of Ni 2+ ions into the reticular structure, the resulting porous material (Ni-CTF) displayed a lower Ni-N coordination number (close to 3) than the Ni-TPP reference, with Ni sites analogous to terpyridyl or iminopyridyl molecular Ni units embedded into a polymeric matrix. [328][329][330] As corroborated by DFT calculations, which suggest a more favorable free energy barrier for *COOH formation for Ni-N 3 sites as compared to Ni-N 4 moieties, Ni-CTF was found to outperform Ni-TPP for CO 2 RR, leading to a FE CO ca. 90% at À0.8 V vs. RHE. 327 The influence of the carbon matrix should be also taken into account to rationalize the CO 2 RR performances of Ni-N-C materials. For instance, pendant residues located in the second or outer coordination sphere may actively participate in the catalytic CO 2 RR pathway of the SAC, as widely demonstrated for several enzymatic systems and artificial molecular electrocatalysts (see Sections 3 and 4). 48 In this regard, Ni-N 2+2 -C 8 structures located at the edge between two adjacent carbon sheets were predicted to promote an energetically more favorable pathway for CO 2 reduction to CO, as compared to the isolated bulk-hosted Ni-N 4 -C 10 sites confined within a single graphitic layer. 296 This is due to the capability of uncoordinated carbon atoms with dangling bonds close to the catalytic site to assist the dissociation of the *COOH intermediate. Moreover, the optimization of the physicochemical properties of the support material revealed to be an effective approach to enhance the catalytic performance of Ni-N-C catalysts. More specifically, an increased porosity and a high density of defects on the carbon support have been shown to facilitate fast CO 2 mass transport and enhance the incorporation of the single metal atoms, contributing to boost the catalytic activities of the Ni-N-C catalysts. 323,[331][332][333] Yang and co-workers explored a top-down strategy via thermal atomization to prepare N-C materials enriched with Ni single atoms, by trapping the latter on the surface defects of the N-doped carbon matrix. This approach was found to improve the atomic distribution of the active sites on the support surface, positively impacting the CO 2 RR activity, selectivity to CO (FE CO 4 90% between À0.6 V and À1.0 V vs. RHE) and durability of the catalyst. 331 In another report, a highly porous and surface defect-rich microwave exfoliated graphene oxide was used as support to disperse N-coordinated Ni atoms. 332 The abundant defects on the pore edges favored the anchoring of the Ni atoms, leading to high selectivity and mass activity.The question on the optimal coordination structure in Ni-N-C SACs is however still under debate, due to the possible heterogeneities that can be found in the real materials, as well as the extreme difficulty to unambiguously characterize experimentally the local coordinative environment of a catalyst and to precisely control its structure/composition through synthetic parameters.

        <p>By virtue of the promising catalytic properties of Ni SACs, some efforts have been recently done to implement them in real devices by using Gas Diffusion Electrodes (GDE) in order to achieve commercially relevant current densities. A reactive three-phase interface is prepared by feeding gaseous CO 2 from the back of a GDE to optimize the accessibility of CO 2 to the catalyst surface. This setup overcomes the limitation of the low CO 2 solubility and mass transfer in aqueous electrolyte. A few recent reports afforded high current densities over 300 mA cm À2 with selective CO production, [334][335][336] reaching a maximum of FE CO 90% between 100 and 200 mA cm À2 . 334 Albeit exhibiting similar performances as the benchmark AgO x catalyst in an H-type cell (Fig. 22a), the Ni-N-C catalysts showed higher current densities and less dramatic FE decrease for CO production in the electrolyzer setup (Fig. 22b). Recently, commercially relevant current densities for CO production (308 mA cm À2 ) with excellent selectivity (FE CO 88%) could be sustained for up to 120 hours by using a flexible and robust Ni SAC-decorated porous carbon membrane as GDE. 315 The highly hydrophobic structure was found to favor CO 2 adsorption and possess higher electrochemical active surface area as well as low electric resistance.By virtue of the promising catalytic properties of Ni SACs, some efforts have been recently done to implement them in real devices by using Gas Diffusion Electrodes (GDE) in order to achieve commercially relevant current densities.

        <p>Due to its extreme earth-abundance, the utilization of catalysts based on Fe for efficient CO 2 conversion to CO is highly desirable. Jaouen, Fontecave and co-workers studied the effect of different ratios of Fe-SACs and Fe-NPs on the catalytic performance in a series of Fe-N-C materials, establishing a correlation between the catalyst structure and CO 2 RR activity/ selectivity. 298 Depending on the synthesis, different amounts of atomically dispersed Fe atoms or particles were obtained in the N-C materials, which was found to strongly affect the CO 2 RR performance. In particular, isolated square-planar Fe-N 4 moieties were found to be the active species for a selective CO production (FE CO up to 80% at À0.5 V vs. RHE), whereas heterogeneous Fe-based species (e.g. NPs or carbides) mainly produced H 2 under similar conditions. Interestingly, the higher the fraction of crystalline Fe, the higher the FE for H 2 . These results showed that the Fe speciation within the Fe-N-C material strongly affects the CO/H 2 ratio, being attractive in the perspective of using non-expensive catalysts to produce CO/H 2 mixtures useful for Fischer-Tropsch technologies. Although the crucial role of Fe on CO 2 RR in Fe-N-C catalysts has been verified by passivating the metal center with the coordinative SCN À ion leading to a decreased activity, 337 the identification of the real active site responsible for the catalytic behavior of Fe-N-C systems is still under debate. For instance, some studies reported that a high CO selectivity can be even achieved by using metal-free N-C materials, albeit exhibiting considerably lower current densities than those obtained in the presence of Fe. 338 Moreover, the mismatch experimentally observed between the CO 2 RR activity trends for a series of M-N-C (M = Fe, Co, Ni) and the corresponding molecular metalloporphyrins, suggests that ideal M-N 4 active sites are only a rough approximation of the real catalytic units in M-N-C materials and that the interactions with the surrounding carbon matrix may play a relevant role in catalysis. 338 By using a combined experimental and theoretical approach, Pan et al. investigated the structural features of isolated Fe-N 4 moieties on a carbon matrix synthesized by thermal activation of Fe-doped ZIF-8. 297 Synchrotron-based XAS measurements confirmed the presence of discrete Fe-N 4 sites containing Fe centers predominantly in 3+ oxidation state. However, Mo ¨ssbauer spectroscopy suggested the co-existence of two different types of Fe-N 4 structures within the Fe-N-C sample: planar bulk-hosted Fe-N 4 -C 10 units fully embedded in a 2D graphitic layer, and out-of-plane distorted edge-hosted Fe-N 2+2 -C 8 sites (see Chart 6). The latter bridge two armchair-like N-doped graphitic layers through the coordination between a Fe atom and 2 N heteroatoms exposed at the edges. According to computational DFT data, CO 2 RR is predicted to occur more favorably at the edge-hosted Fe-N 2+2 -C 8 configuration, due to the beneficial role of the neighboring C atoms with dangling bonds to facilitate the key *COOH dissociation step. 297 These data emphasize the importance of the specific interaction between the active site and the hosting environment in controlling the activity and selectivity of Fe-N-C SACs, suggesting analogous outer coordination sphere effects observed in homogeneous Fe systems with heme 112,120,[124][125][126]131 or non-heme ligands 267 (see Sections 3 and4).Due to its extreme earth-abundance, the utilization of catalysts based on Fe for efficient CO 2 conversion to CO is highly desirable.

        <p>An in situ infrared spectroscopy study in attenuated total reflection mode (ATR-IR) on a model Fe-N-C catalyst containing Fe-N 4 sites provided useful insights into the nature of the catalytically relevant units in Fe-N-C materials and the main factors limiting their activity (Fig. 23a). 339 When the applied potential matched the foot of the catalytic wave, an absorption band near 1900 cm À1 started to grow, indicating the formation of a *CO species adsorbed on the surface, as further confirmed by control experiments under CO atmosphere (Fig. 23b). In agreement with a *CO inhibition process, its intensity did not decrease significantly after purging the solution with Ar and applying more negative potentials, suggesting the formation of a spectator deactivation species rather than an on-cycle intermediate (Fig. 23c andd). In order to determine which sites could be affected by *CO poisoning, DFT calculations suggested that bulk-hosted Fe-N 4 and edge-hosted Fe-N 2+2 structures are catalytically inactive, since both of them displayed a prohibitively strong *CO adsorption. Contrariwise, Fe-N 4 units within graphitic pores of a defect-rich Fe-N-C material are considered the active sites for CO 2 RR to CO, due to a local electronic effect of the pore environment which contributes to weaken the Fe-C bond. 339 As previously discussed (Section 4), the formation of stable metal carbonyl deactivating species during CO 2 RR has been experimentally detected for several homogeneous Ni and Co systems based on non-heme N4 macrocyclic 217 or aminopyridyl 277,288 ligands. A molecular CO scavenger 217 or light irradiation 277 were successfully used as alternative strategies to alleviate the CO inhibition and favor catalyst regeneration in molecular systems (see Section 4). In a similar fashion, the formation of an inactive Fe carbonyl species (detected by in situ UV-Vis and FTIR SEC) was also found to limit the electrocatalytic CO 2 RR performance of the 63-Fe homogeneous catalyst in organic electrolytes at low overpotentials, leading to low faradaic efficiencies for CO production (Section 4.3). It is worth noting that this complex contains a well-defined Fe-N 4 moiety, which is structurally similar to the sites accessible in the Fe-N-C SACs. 281 Similarly to other molecular systems, visible-light irradiation significantly improved the catalytic performance. [281][282][283] A recent experimental study carried out by Chen, Hu and co-workers provided a significant improvement in the elucidation of the structure-activity relationship in Fe N-C SACs, establishing a direct correlation between coordinative environment, metal oxidation state and catalytic CO 2 RR activity. 340 In this work, a Fe-N-C material featuring a porphyrin-like Fe 3+ -N 4 pyrrolic coordination environment, displayed an outstanding activity for CO 2 RR to CO in a flow-cell setup, affording j CO = 94 mA cm À2 at À0.45 V vs. RHE with FE CO 4 90%. Operando XAS at À0.4 V vs. RHE revealed that the oxidation state of Fe remained unchanged during sustained CO 2 RR, likely due to a strong electronic coupling with the conductive support, as recently reported for some electrode-conjugated molecular sites. 341,342 However, at more negative applied potentials (oÀ0.5 V vs. RHE) a decreased stability of the catalytic system was observed concomitantly with an apparent shift to lower energies of the Fe K-edge, indicating a Fe 3+/2+ reduction. Moreover, the EXAFS spectra also revealed that the catalyst deactivation was accompanied by a drastic change in the local structure of the first coordination shell of the Fe atom, resulting in a decreased nitrogen coordination number (from 4 to 3) due to the loss of a pyrrolic N. It is worth noting that a partial hydrogenation or carboxylation of porphyrin rings under electrochemical conditions has been reported in several Fe molecular systems. 72,93 The crucial role of the coordinative environment on the CO 2 RR performance was further demonstrated by the dramatic activity loss and faster deactivation observed for a reference Fe 2+ -N 4 sample containing 4 pyridinic N atoms, synthesized from the [Fe(phen) 3 ] 2+ precursor. Importantly, unlike the case of the Fe 3+ -N 4 catalyst, the CO 2 RR reaction at Fe 2+ -N 4 sites was found to be rate-limited by CO desorption at high overpotentials. Taken together, these results show that the Fe 3+ -N 4 (pyrrolic) configuration is able to promote an extremely durable and efficient CO 2 RR to CO: the pyrrolic N atoms stabilize the high Fe 3+ oxidation state, which reduces the p-backdonation to adsorbed CO, resulting in a weaker CO binding. On the other hand, the Fe 2+ -N 4 (pyridinic) sites catalyze CO 2 RR less efficiently due to stronger CO binding on Fe 2+ center stabilized by pyridinic N. 340 Notably, these findings match well with the different catalytic behavior commonly reported for homogeneous Fe catalysts bearing heme and non-heme ligands, suggesting an intimate correlation between some specific local metal-coordinative features in Fe-N-C SACs and the corresponding structurally similar Fe-based homogeneous counterparts. For instance, Fe porphyrin molecular systems, whose structure is reminiscent of the Fe 3+ -N 4 (pyrrolic) sites, are known to be very efficient electrocatalysts for CO 2 RR to CO in organic electrolytes as well as in water, and are not generally affected by severe CO poisoning under CO 2 RR. On the other hand, in analogy with Fe 2+ -N 4 (pyridinic) single sites, the Fe quaterpyridine homogeneous catalyst (63-Fe) suffers from CO deactivation under pure electrocatalytic conditions with the formation of stable Fe carbonyl species. 281 Such a fascinating comparison between Fe SACs and molecular systems is a clear example that unveiling the relationships between structural features of a molecular ligand framework (e.g. rigidity vs. flexibility, macrocyclic vs. open structures) and the electronic properties of key intermediates involved in CO 2 RR may pave the way for a rational design of both, homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts.An in situ infrared spectroscopy study in attenuated total reflection mode (ATR-IR) on a model Fe-N-C catalyst containing Fe-N 4 sites provided useful insights into the nature of the catalytically relevant units in Fe-N-C materials and the main factors limiting their activity (Fig. 23a). 339 When the applied potential matched the foot of the catalytic wave, an absorption band near 1900 cm À1 started to grow, indicating the formation of a *CO species adsorbed on the surface, as further confirmed by control experiments under CO atmosphere (Fig. 23b). In agreement with a *CO inhibition process, its intensity did not decrease significantly after purging the solution with Ar and applying more negative potentials, suggesting the formation of a spectator deactivation species rather than an on-cycle intermediate (Fig. 23c andd). In order to determine which sites could be affected by *CO poisoning, DFT calculations suggested that bulk-hosted Fe-N 4 and edge-hosted Fe-N 2+2 structures are catalytically inactive, since both of them displayed a prohibitively strong *CO adsorption. Contrariwise, Fe-N 4 units within graphitic pores of a defect-rich Fe-N-C material are considered the active sites for CO 2 RR to CO, due to a local electronic effect of the pore environment which contributes to weaken the Fe-C bond. 339 As previously discussed (Section 4), the formation of stable metal carbonyl deactivating species during CO 2 RR has been experimentally detected for several homogeneous Ni and Co systems based on non-heme N4 macrocyclic 217 or aminopyridyl 277,288 ligands.

        <p>Another recurrent topic in the available literature on Fe-N-C SACs is the beneficial effect of additional nitrogen doping on the CO 2 RR catalytic performances. 305,[343][344][345] An increase in the level of N doping was first predicted by first-principle calculations to facilitate the *COOH formation and *CO desorption steps in Fe-N 4 SACs. 346 In a similar fashion, the presence of additional N atoms near the Fe-N 4 was calculated to exert a synergistic effect which contributes to lower the barrier for the protonation of the bound *CO 2 À , resembling the stabilizing effect of pendant amine, 245,257,267 amide 125 or urea 126 groups in the second coordination sphere in molecular catalysis (see Sections 3 and 4). 339 From an experimental perspective, Yang et al. studied the effect of the oxidation treatment and found improved CO 2 RR activity resulting from an increased amount of pyrrolic N. 345 In another recent investigation, the annealing of hemin (Fe source) in the presence of an excess of melamine (N-rich additive) and defective graphene led to atomically dispersed Fe-N 5 sites stabilized by pyrrolic N-doped graphene, acting as an additional axial ligand coordinated to Fe-N 4 moieties (Fig. 24a). 344 This unique configuration was found to outperform a Fe-N 4 catalyst in terms of robustness and selectivity to CO (FE 97% at À0.46 V vs. RHE, Fig. 24b).Another recurrent topic in the available literature on Fe-N-C SACs is the beneficial effect of additional nitrogen doping on the CO 2 RR catalytic performances. 305,[343][344][345] An increase in the level of N doping was first predicted by first-principle calculations to facilitate the *COOH formation and *CO desorption steps in Fe-N 4 SACs. 346 In a similar fashion, the presence of additional N atoms near the Fe-N 4 was calculated to exert a synergistic effect which contributes to lower the barrier for the protonation of the bound *CO 2 À , resembling the stabilizing effect of pendant amine, 245,257,267 amide 125 or urea 126 groups in the second coordination sphere in molecular catalysis (see Sections 3 and 4). 339 From an experimental perspective, Yang et al. studied the effect of the oxidation treatment and found improved CO 2 RR activity resulting from an increased amount of pyrrolic N. 345 In another recent investigation, the annealing of hemin (Fe source) in the presence of an excess of melamine (N-rich additive) and defective graphene led to atomically dispersed Fe-N 5 sites stabilized by pyrrolic N-doped graphene, acting as an additional axial ligand coordinated to Fe-N 4 moieties (Fig. 24a). 344 This unique configuration was found to outperform a Fe-N 4 catalyst in terms of robustness and selectivity to CO (FE 97% at À0.46 V vs. RHE, Fig. 24b).</p>
        <p>Theory and the analysis of the local density of states (LDOS) suggested that the additional axial ligand contributes to reduce the electron density from the 3d orbitals of the metal center, alleviating the p-backdonation to coordinating CO and favoring the rapid CO release step. Following a similar concept, Yang and co-workers developed an alternative core-shell strategy to improve the *CO desorption step in Fe-N-C SACs, based on the encapsulation of Fe nitride nanoparticles (Fe x N) with graphene layers containing atomically dispersed Fe-N 4 -C units. 347 Owing to the additional coordination to the N atom of the Fe x N core, the surface single-site assumed a Fe-N 5 -C configuration, displaying a much more efficient *CO desorption step as compared to the bare Fe-N 4 -C configuration. An analogous trans effect, based on the influence of a trans donor ligand on the CO 2 activation bond, was recently observed for a homogeneous Ru catalyst bearing a 2,2 0 :6 0 ,2 00 -terpyridine and an asymmetric pyridyl-N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands. 348 A stereochemical control was found to be essential to efficiently catalyze CO 2 RR to CO, since the presence of the strong s-donating NHC ligand in trans to the site for CO 2 bonding significantly boosted the kinetics of the CO dissociation step. Owing to the extreme versatility of this effect, trans coordination of a tertiary amine led to a change in the selectivity of the Fe porphyrins towards formate production, contributing to facilitate the protonation of reduced CO 2 as well as the formate release step (vide supra). 106 It is worth noting that, as discussed above, a beneficial effect of a pyridine or oxygen donor axial coordination was experimentally observed for electrodefunctionalized molecular Co complexes with macrocyclic ligands. 161,[192][193][194][195] In a Fe-N-C single-site catalyst, the presence of a H 2 O molecule axially adsorbed on Fe-N 4 moieties was found to lower the reaction barrier for the first electron transfer to form *CO 2 À . 306 Moreover, in a tetraazamacrocyclic Co molecular complex, the trans axial coordination of a solvent CH 3 CN molecule to a five-coordinated Co-CO 2 adduct led to an increase of the observed metal-to-ligand charge transfer (Section 4.1.2). 11,246 In spite of the numerous studies focusing on the effect of the coordinative environment of the Fe center on the CO 2 RR activity of Fe-N-C catalysts, the number of systematic reports concerning the influence of the reaction conditions (other than the applied potential) on catalysis is relatively scarce. In this regard, Strasser and co-workers investigated the role of the pH and electrolyte on CO 2 RR activity and selectivity of Fe-N-C catalysts, containing Fe-N x moieties. 349 Unlike H 2 evolution, which was strongly favored at acidic pH values, the catalytic CO production was found to be independent of the pH on the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) potential scale. This implies that the CO/H 2 ratio may be fine-tuned by controlling the electrolyte pH, achieving high CO selectivity at high pH values. Moreover, the CO formation rate as a function of the pH on the RHE scale suggested a decoupled electron-proton transfer (DEPT) mechanism for CO production (Fig. 25a), whereby the rate-determining step is the formation of the key (Fe-N-C)-CO 2 À intermediate, followed by an irreversible protonation step (Fig. 25b). Notably, an analogous mechanism has been described for an immobilized Co protoporphyrin catalyst by Koper and co-workers (see Section 3.2.1), in which the formation of the key [Co(P)(CO 2 )] À adduct occurs after the initial one-electron reduction to form the active [Co I (P)] À species. 51,154 Analogous reaction pathways have also been proposed for homogeneous macrocyclic catalysts, 215 strongly suggesting that the molecularly defined solid-state Fe-N x motifs are the primary active sites in Fe-N-C. These moieties may contribute to stabilize the (Fe-N-C)-CO 2 À intermediate giving rise to a solid-state heterogeneous charge-transfer reaction mechanism strikingly similar to that occurring in macrocyclic metal-N x molecular catalysts complexes. 349 The K + cations were also proposed to provide an additional stabilization of this intermediate, 349,350 exerting a beneficial effect on catalysis which resembles the synergistic boosting effect observed upon the addition of Lewis acids in several heme 93,94 (see Section 3.1.1) and non-heme 289,351,352 molecular catalysts. However, it is worth noting that the mechanism can be affected by the pH. 353 These results are extremely important since they contribute to unify some fundamental concepts of the fields of heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis. An interesting aspect of Fe-N x moieties in Fe-N-C SACs relies in their ability to promote the reduction of CO 2 to beyond 2e products, representing one of the few reported examples of solid-state non-Cu-based electrocatalysts able to produce hydrocarbons. In this perspective, it is supposed that the strong CO binding occurring at the Fe sites plays an important role, and that moderate *H adsorption may favor further protonation of the adsorbed *CO to generate 42e products. The rate for CH 4 production was found to increase at low pH, suggesting that CO protonation is the rate-limiting step. Nevertheless, the concomitant enhancement of HER resulted in low FEs for CH 4 production (o1%). 349 In agreement with theoretical predictions, 57,301 Fe-N x sites of Fe-N-C materials were found to produce small amounts of CH 4 in addition to the predominant CO. Moreover, operando EXAFS data revealed that an unusual change in the Fe oxidation state from Fe 2+ to Fe 1+ is likely involved in the CH 4 production process. 354 Interestingly, a molecular iron porphyrin system (complex 18, see Chart 1) was recently shown to catalytically generate CH 4 from CO 2 or CO under homogeneous photochemical conditions in the presence of a photosensitizer and a sacrificial electron donor. 355 In this report, CO is a key intermediate in the CO 2 -to-CH 4 process and the Fe II/I process is pivotal, via the formation of a Fe-formyl intermediate. It is worth noting also that the Fe quaterpyridine complex 63-Fe was used as a molecular precursor for the electrochemical conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 (FE ca. 2%) in CH 3 CN in the presence of TEOA as a proton source. 356 In this case, in situ formed Fe particles derived from the electrochemical decomposition of the starting molecular complex are likely the responsible species for CH 4 production. In a recent integrated experimental-computational study, Ju et al. also elucidated the possible pathways for CO 2 RR to CH 4 at the Fe-N x sites as well as the role of the possible intermediate products formed during the CO 2 -to-CH 4 cascades. 357 As a result, CO was found to be the key intermediate toward CH 4 , CH 3 OH and CH 2 O production, yet CH 2 O (but not CH 3 OH) could be further reduced to CH 4 . Moreover, the isolated nature of atomically dispersed Fe-N x units was identified as the main origin for low hydrocarbon selectivity, suggesting ''dual-site'' or ''hybrid-tandem'' catalysts, featuring cooperative sites for *CO and *H adsorption, as viable promising strategies.Theory and the analysis of the local density of states (LDOS) suggested that the additional axial ligand contributes to reduce the electron density from the 3d orbitals of the metal center, alleviating the p-backdonation to coordinating CO and favoring the rapid CO release step.

        <p>In contrast to the superior CO 2 RR performances displayed by the heterogenized molecular Co phthalocyanine complexes in comparison with derivatives containing other metals, 204 Co-N-C SACs (especially Co-N 4 sites) are typically intrinsically less selective for CO 2 RR than their Ni and Fe analogs, resulting in lower faradaic yields for CO production. 297,337 This behavior is generally due to the predominant competitive HER process on Co-N-C catalysts, 316,358 related to unfavorable *H adsorption energies and higher energetic barriers for *CO desorption as compared to the Fe and Ni analogues. 306,314,318 able to promote a selective CO 2 -to-CO conversion in aqueous media over a wide pH range, due to the unfavorable protonation of the active Ni I species even at very acidic pH under CO 2 -saturated conditions. 214 On the contrary, macrocyclic Co I species are generally protonated much easier, forming Co hydride intermediates which favor the competitive HER process over CO 2 RR (see Section 4.1). 11 Furthermore, albeit CO inhibition has been experimentally observed also for the [Ni(cyclam)] 2+ homogeneous system, 217 Co I non-heme macrocycles are known to possess a great affinity for CO binding. 11 The in situ formation of stable Co carbonyl species, hindering an efficient CO 2 RR, has been reported also for homogeneous Co systems bearing tetradentate aminopyridyl nitrogen ligands (see Section 4.3). 277 Nevertheless, the catalytic properties of Co-N-C materials towards CO 2 RR have been reported to be extremely dependent on the local coordination environment of the Co centers, with promising results obtained for alternative configurations respect to the conventional Co-N 4 sites.

It was proposed that the coordination of a second CO molecule on the unsaturated Co site would help to promote the *CO desorption step. 359 Nonetheless, an opposite trend was reported for some Co-N-C catalysts, suggesting that an increase in the N coordination number is beneficial for CO 2 RR. For example, atomically dispersed Co-N 5 sites embedded into polymer-derived hollow N-doped porous carbon spheres exhibited remarkable CO 2 RR activity and stability, reaching a FE CO 99% at À0.79 V vs. RHE. 360 In situ XAS measurements further confirmed the catalytic relevance of the Co-N 5 units during CO 2 electroreduction. Under similar conditions, the molecular CoPc metal precursor, containing well-defined planar Co-N 4 moieties, resulted in lower efficiencies and current densities for CO production. In an attempt to decrease the Co-N coordination number in the original Co-N 5 sample, the latter was pyrolyzed at increasingly higher temperatures, leading to a progressive drop in the observed FE CO , partly due to formation of inactive Co NPs. The unique Co-N 5 configuration was predicted to favor the *COOH formation and the *CO desorption steps. 361 As mentioned above, analogous positive effects on catalysis due to the presence of axial nitrogen donors were found for Co molecular systems with heme macrocyclic ligands 192,194 and in Fe-N-C SACs. 344,347 In another study, a Co-N-C SAC containing isolated Co-N 4 moieties provided a considerably improved selectivity for CO 2 -to-CO conversion in comparison with a Co-N 4Àx ÀC x derivative accommodating Co sites with lower Co-N coordination number (FEs 82% vs. 47% at À0.8 V vs. RHE for Co-N 4 and Co-N 4Àx -C x , respectively). for CO 2 RR. Among them, the Mn-N-C systems have attracted growing interest due to the earth-abundant character of Mn, but also to the promising results shown by molecular Mn complexes bearing polypyridyl ligands. 42,[363][364][365] Mn-N-C catalysts were first reported in comparative studies on a series of M-N x -C catalysts containing different transition metals, showing limited catalytic performances for the Mn-N-C materials as compared with the Ni and Fe counterparts. 366,367 However, high-performance for CO 2 RR was subsequently reported for atomically dispersed Mn sites on an N-doped carbon matrix with a halogen and nitrogen dual-coordination, namely (X, N)-Mn/G (X = Cl, Br, I). 368 More specifically, the (Cl, N)-Mn/G catalysts exhibited an excellent selectivity to CO with a maximum FE of 97% at À0.6 V vs. RHE, representing one of the best-performing heterogeneous catalysts reported so far for CO 2 RR. X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis of (Cl, N)-Mn/G revealed a unique out-of-plane distorted Mn-N 4 Cl configuration for the active site, in which the low-valent Mn center (o2+) is coordinated to four N atoms and to one axial Cl atom. Under CO 2 -saturated atmosphere, in situ XAS spectra showed a higher energy shift for the Mn K-edge of (Cl, N)-Mn/ G, consistent with an increased oxidation state of the Mn centers due to charge transfer from the low-valent Mn to the 2p orbitals of CO 2 to generate adsorbed *CO 2 dÀ . As mentioned above for the operando XAS data on a Ni-N-C catalyst, 313 during CO 2 RR at À0.6 V vs. RHE, the Mn K-edge shifted back to lower energy. Notably, only little changes were observed for the Cl-free N-Mn/G sample, suggesting that the halogen atom plays a crucial role in the CO 2 activation process. The computational data shed light on the crucial role played by the axial Cl coordination in the catalytic reaction. First, it was predicted to promote a distortion of the Mn site structure in agreement with the experimental results, facilitating the adsorption of CO 2 and *COOH formation. Moreover, it displayed a stabilizing electronic effect on the *COOH intermediate increasing the electron density at the Mn-C bond, as well as facilitating the *CO desorption step.

        <p>Copper is another interesting metal for heterogeneous CO 2 RR catalysis, widely studied for its unique ability to produce C 2 /C 3 chemicals. 39,369,370 However, in contrast with bulk heterogeneous Cu-based materials, Cu-N-C single-atom catalysts have been predicted to be quite unstable under electrochemical conditions. In particular, DFT calculations have shown low thermodynamic stability of the Cu-N x sites under strongly reducing conditions (oÀ0.7 V vs. RHE) resulting in spontaneous decomposition of the N-coordinated Cu ions into metallic Cu NPs. 367 Furthermore, the d-orbital of the Cu atom is filled with 9 (one singly occupied orbital) or 10 (fully occupied) electrons, indicating that the covalent bonds between copper and nitrogen are quite unlikely. 57,302 In spite of these considerations, unsaturated Cu-N 2 coordinated moieties anchored into a graphene matrix (Cu-N 2 /GN) have been recently reported to efficiently convert CO 2 to CO with FE CO 81% at À0.5 V vs. RHE. 371 The high selectivity was attributed to the unsaturated environment of copper, as suggested by a relatively low calculated potential barrier between CO 2 and the Cu-N 2 moieties.

        <p>In order to develop heterogeneous metal catalysts for highly efficient and selective CO 2 RR, a rational design of the catalytic surface is required to control the stability of surface-bound intermediate species. In this scenario, by controlling the morphological, electronic, and surface chemical properties of metal nanoparticles (NPs) (or nanoclusters (NCs)), it is possible to understand the key factors influencing the performance of nanostructured CO 2 RR catalysts. 369,[377][378][379][380][381][382][383] For example, the size and shape of NPs can be used to control the number of lowcoordinated sites and the ratio between the different crystal facets on the surface, which can affect the binding strength of the reaction intermediates (Section 6.1). In addition to structural effects related to the metal NP itself, the interaction between the NP surface and either the support material or small surface-bonded molecular stabilizers may play a role in determining the adsorption properties and electron transfer kinetics of the catalysts, thus influencing the stability of the intermediates involved in the catalytic reaction. These effects will be discussed in the Sections 6.2 and 6.3, respectively.In order to develop heterogeneous metal catalysts for highly efficient and selective CO 2 RR, a rational design of the catalytic surface is required to control the stability of surface-bound intermediate species.

        <p>A systematic investigation of the metal NP size-dependence of CO 2 RR was carried out for Au NPs. Sun et al. 384 explored the electrocatalytic CO 2 RR behavior of monodispersed Au NPs with various sizes (4, 6, 8 and 10 nm, respectively), showing that the selectivity of CO 2 RR to CO tends to decrease with decreasing NP size. To account for this effect, DFT was used to calculate the free energies of reaction steps for CO and H 2 production on certain crystal sites (i.e. Au (111), Au (211) and a 13-atom Au cluster) present on the NPs surface (Fig. 27a). The results revealed that catalytic CO evolution preferentially occurs at the Au (211) sites (denoted as ''edge sites''), while Au(111) and 13-atom Au clusters (denoted as ''corner sites'') are more active sites for H 2 production. Hence, the increase in the H 2 selectivity observed with decreasing NP size was ascribed to an increased content of corner sites on the NP surface. Analogous results were also obtained for micellar Au NPs within the size range of 1-8 nm. 385 Specifically, small Au NPs (1.1 nm in size) displayed an activity that is more than two orders of magnitude higher than larger Au NPs (7.7 nm in size) (Fig. 27b). However, the higher activity was mainly associated to HER rather than CO production (Fig. 27c), consistent with the weaker binding of the COOH* intermediates and the presence of large H* coverages on the small Au NPs.A systematic investigation of the metal NP size-dependence of CO 2 RR was carried out for Au NPs.

        <p>In addition to Au NPs, various other metal NPs such as Bi, 386 Sn, 387 Ag, 388 and Zn 389 have shown a similar structural effect on CO 2 RR, displaying a significant drop of CO 2 RR efficiency below a certain NP size. However, depending on the specific metal NPs, a variety of different sizes showed the optimal catalytic performances for CO 2 reduction to CO (or formate for Sn NPs). For instance, size-controlled Zn NPs ranging from 3 to 5 nm exhibited high CO 2 RR activity and selectivity to CO (FE B 70%), whereas a drastic increase of H 2 evolution was observed for NPs smaller than 3 nm, presumably due to a larger content of low-coordinated sites. 389 In a similar fashion, the maximum FE for CO 2 conversion to formate on Sn NPs was achieved for B5 nm NPs, representing a balance between surface stabilization of the CO 2 À intermediate and its activation via further protonation/reduction steps. 387 As indicated by operando spectroscopic studies (XAS, Raman), oxidized/hydroxylated species were found to be stable during CO 2 RR for pre-oxidized Zn and Sn NPs. These cationic species are likely involved in the catalytic reaction and may lead to differences in the adsorption strength of the reaction intermediates (Fig. 27d ande). 389,390 Moreover, it is worth noting that other factors related to the preparation method of the NPs (presence of surface-anchored organic agents, surface oxidation degree, defects, etc.) or the reaction conditions were found to have a strong influence of the CO 2 RR activity, contributing to alter the electronic structure and the physicochemical properties of the metal NPs (see next paragraph). A representative example is given by monodispersed Bi NPs with average sizes of 36 nm and 7 nm, whose catalytic properties for CO 2 RR to CO were explored in nonaqueous 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethane-sulfonate ([bmim][OTf])/CH 3 CN electrolyte. 386 After a hydrazine-based surface activation treatment, the Bi NPs showed an excellent catalytic activity, reaching a FE CO B 96% for the 36 nm NPs. Furthermore, a negligible size or morphology effect was observed on CO 2 RR efficiency in these conditions, likely due to a change of the CO 2 RR mechanism in aprotic media, which occurs via a direct H + transfer between the adsorbed CO 2 molecule and the electrolyte rather than via pre-adsorbed protons on the catalyst surface. 386 On the other hand, the Bi NPs displayed a size-dependent behaviour after air exposure, resulting in a decreased efficiency for CO production with smaller NPs. These results suggest that the reduction of surface metal oxides to the metallic state is dependent on the size and morphology of the particle, being much faster for larger NPs.In addition to Au NPs, various other metal NPs such as Bi, 386 Sn, 387 Ag, 388 and Zn 389 have shown a similar structural effect on CO 2 RR, displaying a significant drop of CO 2 RR efficiency below a certain NP size.

        <p>In the case of Cu NPs, 391 an increased population of lowcoordinated sites also results in a preferred H 2 production. However, for large Cu NPs and due to the unique multi-electron CO 2 RR properties of Cu, the product distribution is mainly based on the formation of hydrocarbons rather than CO (or formate) (Fig. 27f). 391 While the adsorbed *CO and *COOH on the NP surface are considered as the key intermediates to form CO (or formate), Cu NPs possess the ability to further protonate *CO to form *HCO or *COH species, due to the fact that *CO is not easily desorbed from the Cu NPs. [392][393][394] Thus, the studies on Cu catalysts have been focused on producing higher yields of hydrocarbons by exploring the way to efficiently stabilize *HCO or *COH intermediates.

In order to explain the experimental results, computational data highlighted that CO 2 reduction is considerably favored at the corner and edge sites in comparison with the terrace sites, whereas the H 2 evolution process is similar over all the three types of sites.In contrast with the reports mentioned above, an opposite trend for size-dependent CO 2 RR has been observed for a series of Pd NPs 402 ranging from B2 to 10 nm.

        <p>In addition to the size-dependence, shape modifications of NPs can also influence their CO 2 RR catalytic performance by controlling the preferential exposure of specific surface sites. In an attempt to design a catalyst with more exposed edges on the surface (Fig. 28a), 403 Au nanowires (2 nm wide and 500 nm in length) were synthesized and found to display very low onset potentials (À0.2 V vs. RHE) and high FE for CO production (94%) (Fig. 28b). DFT calculations suggested that the high density of edge sites in the Au nanowires stabilizes the *COOH intermediate and facilitates the *CO release step. The catalytic performance for CO 2 RR has also been shown to be strongly dependent on the crystal facet located on the NP surface. For instance, triangular Ag nanoplates showed selective CO formation with a FE of 96.8% at À0.86 V vs. RHE, 404 outperforming the spherical NPs with similar size as well as the bulk metallic Ag surface. These results were interpreted with the aid of theoretical data in terms of an optimum edge-tocorner ratio and predominant Ag(100) facets in the nanoplates (Fig. 28c). Shape engineering was also successfully adopted by Chen and co-workers 405 to increase the catalytic CO 2 RR-to-CO activity and stability of Pd NPs. In this study, Pd octahedra dominated by (111) facets showed higher CO selectivity (FE up to 95%) and improved activity compared to Pd cubes with (100) facets (Fig. 28d). Interestingly, in situ XAS revealed that regardless of the original facet, a Pd hydride species (PdH) is formed under reaction conditions.

        <p>Since the electrochemical CO 2 reduction process over heterogeneous catalysts takes place at a solid/liquid interface, a control over the charge transfer between the catalyst and the surface intermediate species is critical to enhance the efficiency of the process. In this sense, the selection of a suitable support material is essential to ensure fast CO 2 RR reaction kinetics and to adjust the binding strength of intermediates species. For example, the CO production over Ag NPs deposited on carbon black can be doubled by using a TiO 2 support. 407 Based on the analysis of the CV curves, the TiO 2 support was found to stabilize the reaction intermediates through the involvement of Ti IV/III redox couples, also acting as a redox carrier to improve the CO 2 reduction kinetics (Fig. 29a). Recently, Au NPs on a C 3 N 4 support were also reported to exhibit a better performance than carbon-supported Au NPs. 408 The strong interaction between the Au NPs and the C 3 N 4 support was predicted to induce the formation of a negatively charged Au surface, which could stabilize the key *COOH intermediate. Along this line, the effect of the C 3 N 4 support can be further improved by incorporating carbon quantum dots (CDots), as demonstrated by the enhanced performances shown by the ternary Au NPs-CDots-C 3 N 4 configuration 409 (Fig. 29b). In the latter case, DFT calculations revealed that the combination of CDots with C 3 N 4 results in an enhanced conductivity and CO 2 /H 2 adsorption, facilitating the CO 2 reduction to CO. A number of other carbonor metal oxide-based materials displayed beneficial effect on CO 2 RR when used as supports in combination with Au NPs. Among them, graphene nanoribbons (GNR) decorated with Au NPs improved the performances of Au NPs supported on carbon black (Fig. 29c), 410 likely due to the strong d-p interaction that can serve to modulate the electronic structure of the Au NP, leading to the acceleration of the charge transfer from the CNR to the Au NPs. Interestingly, it is worth noting that similar results were observed for the non-covalent functionalization of molecular catalytic systems based on p-p stacking and electrostatic interactions. 138 In fact, the strategy of adjusting the electronic structure of the active catalysts to improve the CO 2 RR performance can be widely applied from molecular to nanostructured catalysts. Furthermore, an Au NPs/CeO x assembly led to a substantial improvement in the efficiency towards CO production in comparison with the single bare components 411 (Fig. 29d). As suggested by in situ scanning tunneling microscopy and photoemission spectroscopy, the enhanced reactivity towards CO 2 RR stems from the stabilizing interaction of hydroxyl groups on ceria terraces with key intermediates involved in the catalytic reaction.Since the electrochemical CO 2 reduction process over heterogeneous catalysts takes place at a solid/liquid interface, a control over the charge transfer between the catalyst and the surface intermediate species is critical to enhance the efficiency of the process.

        <p>À nanoclusters were reported to catalyze CO 2 conversion to CO at low overpotentials and higher efficiency as compared to larger NPs and bulk Au catalysts (Fig. 30). 417 The Au-S coordination motifs in the cluster shell were proposed to play a key role in promoting CO 2 adsorption on the NCs. In an effort to rationalize the origin of the observed catalytic activity for CO 2 RR, a follow-up computational study on a series of Au 25 (SR) q 18 NCs with different charge states (q = 0, AE1) suggested that, regardless of the initial charge state, CO 2 RR was thermodynamically feasible only upon removal of a ligand (-SR or -R), which occurred under applied bias. 418 In particular, the removal of an -R ligand from the negatively charged NC gave rise to a selective catalyst for CO 2 RR to CO over HER, highlighting the crucial role of the exposed Au and S sites (in particular the latter) in stabilizing the *COOH intermediate over *H.

        <p>The use of cysteamine as anchoring agent has revealed to be beneficial for the CO 2 RR performances of Au NPs and Ag NPs. 388,419,420 For an optimal particle size of 5 nm, Ag NPs on carbon decorated with cysteamine molecules showed a considerably lower overpotential and a 4-fold enhanced CO faradaic efficiency at À0.75 V vs. RHE compared to a polycrystalline Ag foil. 388 While Tafel slope analysis suggested the formation of the *CO 2 À adduct to be rate-limiting, DFT calculations highlighted an electronic effect on the Ag surface induced by the Ag-S interaction, which is reminiscent of the throughstructure substituent effects observed in molecular catalysts (see Section 3). More specifically, the presence of cysteamine capping agents was predicted to increase the spatial localization of the unpaired electron at the Ag surface, contributing to stabilize the key *COOH intermediate. Interestingly, the cysteamine molecules had only a small impact on the CO binding energy to the surface, resulting in an overall enhanced catalytic activity. 388 A follow-up experimental-computational study extended the mechanistic understanding of the cysteamine-Ag NPs system at a molecular level, proposing that the enhanced activity and selectivity may arise from a synergistic contribution of the electronic effect promoted by the Ag-S interaction and the role of the pendant NH 2 group of anchoring cysteamine molecules, which would assist the CO 2 chemisorption process on the Ag surface. 419 In particular, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations suggested that the terminal amine group of the surface ligand may contribute to stabilize the chemisorbed CO 2 molecule by H-bonding interaction (in cooperation with a water molecule, Fig. 31a), exerting an outer coordination sphere effect analogous to that shown by macrocyclic N4 molecular catalysts with pendant amine groups (see Sections 4.1-4.2). In agreement with this interpretation, the length of the alkyl chain of the anchoring ligand was found to be critical for the catalytic performances: Ag NPs functionalized with the 11-amino-1-undecanethiol (C 11 -Ag) did not display an analogous enhancement effect shown by the cysteamine-capped Ag NPs (C 2 -Ag) (Fig. 31b). 419 In this case, the excessive length of the alkyl chain led to an unfavorable geometry which was not suitable to stabilize the surface-bound CO 2 intermediate, being the terminal NH 2 group too far away from the Ag surface. Moreover, unlike for C 11 -Ag, a shift of the N-H band to lower energy was observed by in situ ATR-IR spectroscopy for C 2 -Ag, suggesting the involvement of the NH 2 group in the CO 2 chemisorption event. 419 An analogous boosting effect due to cysteamine capping agents was also recently reported for Au NPs, showing an exclusive CO selectivity at low overpotential and a 110-fold enhanced mass activity in comparison with the naked Au NPs. 420 XAS spectroscopy confirmed the effect of the Au-S interactions on altering the electronic structure of the gold surface and EXAFS analysis confirmed a lower Au-Au coordination number for cysteamine-Au NPs in comparison with the ligandfree Au NPs. Furthermore, the replacement of cysteamine with 1-propanethiol as a capping agent (terminal CH 3 group) resulted in a significant drop of the CO 2 RR catalytic activity, thereby probing the critical role played by the NH 2 group of the former. 420 Notably, outer coordination sphere effect on CO 2 RR activity and selectivity has been also observed on polycrystalline Au foil functionalized with thio-tethered ligands. 421 Depending on the pK a of the terminal group of the thiolate ligand, the activity and faradaic efficiency toward CO, H 2 and HCOO À could be tuned. In particular, cysteamine-modified Au electrodes exhibited a 2-fold increase in CO and H 2 production respect to the bare Au foil, whereas the functionalization with 2-mercaptopropionic acid led to exclusive H 2 evolution. Conversely, Au electrodes modified with 4-pyridylethylmercaptan (pK a = 5.2) showed a significantly higher production and FE for HCOO À as compared to the naked Au foil, owing to the role of the terminal pyridine/pyridinium groups. The latter were proposed to be involved in a proton-induced desorption mechanism leading to HCOO À formation. 421 It is interesting to note that in Section 3 we have discussed several examples from molecular catalysis in which pendant pyridine/pyridinium groups in the second coordination sphere exerted a boosting effect for the catalytic CO 2 RR to CO. 168,192,194 Moreover, a selectivity change induced by different groups in the second coordination sphere has been also observed in a number of homogeneous molecular catalysts. [267][268][269][270][271] Surfactant molecules containing highly hydrophobic long alkyl chains are commonly used as stabilizing agents during metal NPs synthesis. In some cases however, they may partially block the surface active sites limiting the catalyst performance 386 or be easily detached from the surface during prolonged electrolysis. In order to overcome this limitation, the surfactant molecules bound to Au NPs were replaced by chelating porphyrin-like tetradentate ligands with S-terminal anchoring groups. 422 The latter act as hollow scaffolds on Au NPs, interacting with the metal catalyst but without hindering the accessibility of the catalytic sites. This structural modification led to a 110-fold current enhancement in comparison with the parent oleylaminecoated Au NPs, efficiently producing CO (FE up to 93%) at an overpotential of 340 mV (Fig. 32). Importantly, the chelation effect resulted in a remarkable stability, leading to only minor deactivation after 72 h electrolysis. Unlike the classical surfactantbased strategy, this alternative approach ensures a higher number of exposed sites, substantially increasing the current densities. In addition, the tetra-functionalized Au NPs were predicted to be intrinsically more active towards CO 2 RR with respect to both, bare Au (111) and oleylamine-coated Au NPs, showing an energetically more favorable *COOH formation. The electronic effect due to Au-S interactions was estimated to be negligible. 422 In an earlier study, the same authors used tetrapodal S-terminal porphyrin platforms to functionalize polycrystalline Cu electrodes for electrochemical CO reduction (CORR). 423 Based on DFT calculations, the different selectivity toward oxygenates production experimentally observed for various cage sizes was tentatively ascribed to a different stabilization of a key ketene intermediate via H-bonding interactions with the porphyrin cap. 423 As discussed in Section 3.1.1, stabilizing the H-bonding interaction promoted by pendant amide groups displayed beneficial effects in CO 2 RR catalysed by homogeneous Fe porphyrins. Finally, we emphasize that this approach is particularly interesting for the design of bimetallic heterogeneous catalysts by metalation of the porphyrin moiety, merging concepts from molecular catalysis, supramolecular chemistry and surface science.The use of cysteamine as anchoring agent has revealed to be beneficial for the CO 2 RR performances of Au NPs and Ag NPs. 388,419,420 For an optimal particle size of 5 nm, Ag NPs on carbon decorated with cysteamine molecules showed a considerably lower overpotential and a 4-fold enhanced CO faradaic efficiency at À0.75 V vs. RHE compared to a polycrystalline Ag foil. 388 While Tafel slope analysis suggested the formation of the *CO 2 À adduct to be rate-limiting, DFT calculations highlighted an electronic effect on the Ag surface induced by the Ag-S interaction, which is reminiscent of the throughstructure substituent effects observed in molecular catalysts (see Section 3).

        <p>6.3.2 Nitrogen-and oxygen-based ligands. A systematic investigation of the role of the anchoring group on CO 2 RR was first carried out by Hwang and coworkers on ligandstabilized Ag NPs, establishing a direct correlation between the functional group of the capping agent and the CO 2 RR activity and selectivity. 424 Capping agents with three different functional groups, i.e. amine (oleylamine), carboxylic acid (oleic acid) and thiol (dodecanethiol), were explored, resulting in a striking difference in the product distribution of CO 2 RR. The oleylamine-capped Ag NPs showed the highest FE CO (ca. 94%), effectively suppressing HER, whereas the dodecanethiol-capped Ag NPs boosted both, CO 2 RR and HER, resulting in a poorer CO selectivity, Fig. 33. The general tendency of amine-functionalization to enhance CO selectivity was further probed by the excellent performances obtained by using ethylenediamine (analogous to cysteamine but with two amine groups) as anchoring agent. The experimental results were found to be consistent with the DFT calculations which suggested that amine-capped ligands contribute to destabilize *H adsorption, favoring CO 2 RR, while thiol-capped Ag NPs tend to improve indiscriminately both, the HER and CO 2 RR rates. 424 Functionalization with oleylamine, a surfactant commonly used in the wet-chemistry synthesis of metal NPs, displayed an analogous boosting effect on CO 2 RR for Au NPs. In this regard, oleylamine-capping was recently reported to drastically enhance the selectivity of small Au NPs toward CO production over HER. 425 The origin of the HER inhibition was ascribed to the preferential binding of oleylamine to the low-coordinated corner sites of the Au NPs, which are the ones favoring *H binding, thus leaving the edge sites free to engage *COOH formation and conversion to CO. 425 The molecular structure of the capping agent was also found to play a role on the catalytic efficiency, resulting in a structure-dependent modification effect: linear amines revealed to be more suitable to promote CO 2 RR to CO as compared to the branched amines, with the CO selectivity increasing with the length of the alkyl chain. 426 Across the series, oleylamine provided the best results in terms of either activity and selectivity, suggesting a correlation between the amine structure and the surface coverage. However, the stability of the capping agent under electrochemical conditions should be carefully assessed in order to reliably establish structure-function relationships. In the case of oleylaminecapped Au NPs, some reports indicate that catalyst degradation occurs at negative potentials, likely due to partial ligand detachment, 426 as observed in some molecular systems (see Section 4.1.1). 217 The applied bias-driven loss of surfactant molecules was shown to cause the aggregation of ultrasmall Au NPs, leading to bigger nanostructures that increase the selectivity toward CO production. 427 Contrariwise, dendrimerencapsulated Au NPs were found to be very stable under electrochemical conditions leading to predominant H 2 evolution.6.3.2 Nitrogen-and oxygen-based ligands.

        <p>In addition to a direct functionalization of metal NPs with organic ligands, the outer coordinative environment of the metal NPs may cooperate with the latter to boost catalysis. For example, the adsorption of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) on Au NPs led to a superior selectivity toward CO production compared to the naked Au NPs. 428 It was proposed that the H-bond network at the metal-polymer interface may contribute to stabilize the key *COOH intermediate, through outer coordination sphere effects analogous to those displayed in homogeneous porphyrin catalysts bearing local phenolic groups (see Section 3.1.1). 120 Moreover, the co-presence of organic molecules on the surface may contribute to the catalytic reaction. Some Au NPs supported on CNTs recently displayed a significantly improved catalytic CO 2 RR performances in the presence of axial pyridine groups covalently grafted on the CNT surface via the diazo-reaction. 429 The hybrid catalysts showed excellent faradaic yield for CO production in a wide potential range at low overpotential, which could not be explained by the pyridine alone. 430 Instead, it was proposed that the pyridine group might participate in the rate-limiting *COOH formation step in a similar manner as previously observed for several molecular systems (Section 3) 168,192,194 and polycrystalline catalysts (see Section 6.3.1). 421 In an effort to systematically investigate the effect of tailoring the organic component in a hybrid organic/inorganic interface on catalysis, Buonsanti and coworkers recently explored a series of colloidal Ag NCs functionalized with di-substituted imidazolium ligands with varying tail and anchoring groups. 431 This interesting study focused on the key design guidelines to tune the organic component for NP functionalization, dissecting the contribution of each of the three fundamental elements (Fig. 34). The latter are: (i) the anchoring group to the Ag NC, which may affect the electronic structure of the metal surface by direct coordination, (ii) the imidazolium group, and (iii) the tail group. The probed integrity of the Ag NCs-coordinative organic platform under electrochemical conditions is another remarkable aspect of this study. In these systems, the presence of pendant imidazolium motifs was found to be crucial to achieve high selectivity for CO 2 conversion to CO over HER. This is consistent with the role of co-catalysts in CO 2 RR reported for ionic liquids on metal electrodes [432][433][434][435] and in homogeneous molecular catalysis. 97,436 Moreover, in agreement with previous reports, 433 the cationic character of the imidazolium moiety may play an important role in CO 2 RR. We note also that it may help to stabilize negatively charged surface intermediates formed during CO 2 RR via Coulombic through-space interactions, in analogy with the reported examples of homogeneous Fe porphyrin catalysts containing pendant imidazolium units 131 or tetramethylammonio groups 112 (Section 3.1.1). Unlike the imidazolium group, the chemical nature of the functional group anchoring on the Ag NC surface showed a less pronounced effect on selectivity. 431 However, XPS analysis provided experimental evidence of an electronic effect of the substituents on the Ag surface, establishing a linear correlation between the specific activity for CO 2 RR to CO with the observed shifts in the Ag 3d 5/2 peaks. As a general trend, electron-withdrawing substituents were found to be beneficial for CO 2 RR, with the NO 2 group providing the best results. Although a reverse effect is generally reported for ligand-stabilized metal NPs (vide infra), a possible contribution of the imidazolium moiety may also play a role. Furthermore, the positive impact of electron-poor substituents on CO 2 RR has been reported for several heterogenized heme molecular catalysts (see Section 3.2.2). 183,184 Finally, the tuning of the alkyl tail groups also displayed a strong effect on selectivity, with an intermediate tail length effectively suppressing HER due to a suitable interplay between an increased local hydrophobicity on the catalytic surface and without an excessive steric bulkiness. 431 The steric hindrance of a long tail group reduces the accessibility of the electrolyte and CO 2 to the metal surface, analogously as previously discussed for tetraazamacrocyclic Ni catalysts with N-alkyl substituents (see Section 4.1.1).In addition to a direct functionalization of metal NPs with organic ligands, the outer coordinative environment of the metal NPs may cooperate with the latter to boost catalysis. For example, the adsorption of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) on Au NPs led to a superior selectivity toward CO production compared to the naked Au NPs. 428 It was proposed that the H-bond network at the metal-polymer interface may contribute to stabilize the key *COOH intermediate, through outer coordination sphere effects analogous to those displayed in homogeneous porphyrin catalysts bearing local phenolic groups (see Section 3.1.1). 120 Moreover, the co-presence of organic molecules on the surface may contribute to the catalytic reaction. Some Au NPs supported on CNTs recently displayed a significantly improved catalytic CO 2 RR performances in the presence of axial pyridine groups covalently grafted on the CNT surface via the diazo-reaction. 429 The hybrid catalysts showed excellent faradaic yield for CO production in a wide potential range at low overpotential, which could not be explained by the pyridine alone. 430 Instead, it was proposed that the pyridine group might participate in the rate-limiting *COOH formation step in a similar manner as previously observed for several molecular systems (Section 3) 168,192,194 and polycrystalline catalysts (see Section 6.3.1). 421 In an effort to systematically investigate the effect of tailoring the organic component in a hybrid organic/inorganic interface on catalysis, Buonsanti and coworkers recently explored a series of colloidal Ag NCs functionalized with di-substituted imidazolium ligands with varying tail and anchoring groups. 431 This interesting study focused on the key design guidelines to tune the organic component for NP functionalization, dissecting the contribution of each of the three fundamental elements (Fig. 34). The latter are: (i) the anchoring group to the Ag NC, which may affect the electronic structure of the metal surface by direct coordination, (ii) the imidazolium group, and (iii) the tail group. The probed integrity of the Ag NCs-coordinative organic platform under electrochemical conditions is another remarkable aspect of this study. In these systems, the presence of pendant imidazolium motifs was found to be crucial to achieve high selectivity for CO 2 conversion to CO over HER. This is consistent with the role of co-catalysts in CO 2 RR reported for ionic liquids on metal electrodes [432][433][434][435] and in homogeneous molecular catalysis. 97,436 Moreover, in agreement with previous reports, 433 the cationic character of the imidazolium moiety may play an important role in CO 2 RR. We note also that it may help to stabilize negatively charged surface intermediates formed during CO 2 RR via Coulombic through-space interactions, in analogy with the reported examples of homogeneous Fe porphyrin catalysts containing pendant imidazolium units 131 or tetramethylammonio groups 112 (Section 3.1.1).

        <p>These findings highlight how traditional concepts of organometallic chemistry (e.g., steric and electronic effects, second coordination sphere interactions, hydrophobic/hydrophilic interaction, etc.) can be effectively used to improve the understanding of the organic/inorganic interface at a molecular level and to tailor heterogeneous catalysts. Several representative examples of functional organometallic surfaces, based on bulk metal electrodes chemically interacting with nitrogen-based organic additives (e.g. ionic liquids, [432][433][434][435] aminoacids, 437 N-arylpyridinium [438][439][440] or N,N 0 -phenanthrolinium, 441 benzimidazole, 442 polyamines, 443 polyaniline, 444 triazole, 445 etc.) or supramolecular organic assemblies, 446 have been also recently reported for CO 2 RR. 447 6.3.3 N-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHC). N-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) also represent an important class of organic molecules effectively employed to improve the CO 2 RR catalytic performances of metal NPs. 448 Chelating multidentate NHC ligands have been successfully used for CO 2 electroreduction in homogeneous molecular catalysts [449][450][451][452] and polycrystalline metallic surfaces (vide infra). 453 The strong s-donating character of the NHC ligands is particularly attractive for CO 2 RR, leading to electron-rich metal surfaces with an enhanced reactivity towards CO 2 . Moreover, their ability to form highly stable M-C bonds with transition metal atoms enables to improve the catalyst stability under electrochemical reductive conditions, preventing nanoclustering deactivation effects.These findings highlight how traditional concepts of organometallic chemistry (e.g., steric and electronic effects, second coordination sphere interactions, hydrophobic/hydrophilic interaction, etc.) can be effectively used to improve the understanding of the organic/inorganic interface at a molecular level and to tailor heterogeneous catalysts.

        <p>Due to these favorable properties, Au NPs functionalized with monodentate NHC molecules exhibited a substantially improved CO 2 RR behavior as compared to the parent Au NPs in terms of FE (83% vs. 53%) and current densities (7.6-fold increase) for CO production at an overpotential of 460 mV, Fig. 35. 454 The NHC ligation was found to alter the electronic structure of the Au surface, affecting the reaction pathway. For the bare Au NPs, kinetics analysis based on Tafel slope was consistent with a rate-determining step based on a single electron transfer to the adsorbed CO 2 to form *CO 2 À . Contrariwise, the lower slope obtained for NHC-stabilized Au NPs suggested that it may undergo a pre-equilibrium one-electron transfer followed by a rate-limiting chemical step. Such a change of the mechanistic pathway was ascribed to the strong s-donating electronic effect induced by the molecular ligand, which promotes a fast electron transfer prior to the ratedetermining step. 454 Notably, it was also proposed that the strong Au-C bond may destabilize the neighboring Au-Au surface bonds, causing a restructuring of the Au surface which resulted in improved CO 2 RR kinetics.Due to these favorable properties, Au NPs functionalized with monodentate NHC molecules exhibited a substantially improved CO 2 RR behavior as compared to the parent Au NPs in terms of FE (83% vs. 53%) and current densities (7.6-fold increase) for CO production at an overpotential of 460 mV, Fig. 35. 454 The NHC ligation was found to alter the electronic structure of the Au surface, affecting the reaction pathway.

        <p>As mentioned above, the reported NHC-functionalized Au NPs 454 or nanoclusters 455 displayed good CO 2 RR selectivity and stability under electrochemical conditions. Recently, the encapsulation of metal NPs into monodentate or polydentate polymeric NHC matrices was explored as an effective strategy to further improve at the same time catalyst selectivity and longterm durability, preventing nanoclustering. 456 The embedded Au NPs exhibited excellent FE CO with a ca. 86% activity retention over 11 h electrolysis under CO 2 atmosphere at À0.9 V vs. RHE, clearly outperforming the bare Au NPs which lost approximately 90% of their initial activity. The improved performance was ascribed to the electronic effect exerted by NHC ligands and the hydrophobicity of the polymer matrix, the latter helping to suppress HER and control the surface accessibility as observed for polymer-encapsulated molecular catalysts (Section 3). To further confirm the beneficial role played by the NHC polymer on catalysis, an analogous effect was also observed for Pd NPs, which showed an increase in the CO selectivity and stability as compared to commercial Pd/C. 456 In addition to metal NPs, the functionalization of NHCs was recently reported to affect the catalytic properties of polycrystalline metal surfaces. In particular, Pd electrodes modified with tridentate NHC ligands displayed a 32-fold activity enhancement for CO 2 conversion to C 1 products as compared to an unmodified Pd foil, producing HCOO À in high faradaic yields. 457 The electron-rich Pd surface induced by tris-NHC ligation led to a more favorable pathway for HCOO À production. While subtle differences were observed in catalysis upon tuning the alkyl N-substituents of the ligand, the NHC chelation showed a remarkable effect on the catalyst stability, with Tris-NHC ligands providing considerably higher durability than the bare Pd foil and the monodentate counterpart. 457 Further investigation is needed to fully rationalize the influence of NHC ligands on the catalytic CO 2 RR as a function of the denticity and the type of substituents. Moreover, a spectroscopic investigation of the spatial orientation and coordination mode of NHC moieties on different metallic surfaces will provide useful insights to modulate the reactivity of the organic/inorganic interface towards CO 2 RR.

        <p>In this work we have summarized the main advances achieved in the rational design of transition metal-based catalysts for the electrochemical conversion of CO 2 into higher-energy carbon products. With a special focus on structural effects, we have provided a critical comparison of the main design principles directing the development of different types of catalysts, ranging from molecular systems to single-atom and nanostructured catalysts. For molecular systems based on heme and non-heme macrocyclic ligands, we presented detailed studies investigating the effect of the first and second coordination sphere on the catalytic activity, selectivity and overpotential of both, homogeneous and heterogenized catalysts. These studies revealed that molecular systems can be suitable catalysts for scaling-up a selective CO 2 RR under appropriate conditions. In addition to the conventional physical and chemical functionalization methods, alternative approaches for molecular catalyst confinement were explored, including the encapsulation into polymeric matrices, porous organic or metalorganic 3D frameworks and supramolecular assemblies. The main strategies adopted for the design of single-atom and nanostructured catalysts were also discussed. As compared to the corresponding bulk metallic surfaces, molecular-like catalysts show an intrinsically higher selectivity towards CO 2 due to the specificity of their active site. For molecular and single-atom catalysts, earth-abundant 1st row transition metals (e.g. Mn, Fe, Ni, Co) are typically used for efficient and selective CO 2 RR in both, organic and aqueous media.In this work we have summarized the main advances achieved in the rational design of transition metal-based catalysts for the electrochemical conversion of CO 2 into higher-energy carbon products.

In homogeneous systems, structural effects related to the metalorganic active moiety are predominant, with the electrode surface working as an electron collector and the molecular catalyst being usually dissolved in organic media.

        <p>The studies presented herein serve to shed light on a variety of strategies adopted in the past to improve the efficiency of transition metal-based CO 2 RR catalysts. At different levels of complexity, the CO 2 RR activity and selectivity are extremely sensitive to the catalyst structure. In this regard, further development of electrochemical and in situ/operando spectroelectrochemical techniques is needed to improve the mechanistic understanding of the CO 2 RR process and to elucidate structure-function relationships as powerful tools for catalyst optimization. Moreover, new advances in the spectroscopic and microscopic techniques are required to achieve atomic or molecular structural details for the characterization of catalytic materials. In particular, single-atom catalysts show unique physico-chemical properties and an improvement in their structural characterization would allow to more accurately correlate their activity with specific structural features of the active site. This will be a major challenge in the field of energy conversion in the coming decades. Furthermore, an increase of the atomic aggregation level usually leads to a more favorable HER (especially in aqueous electrolyte) or to a catalytic inactivity, as indicated by the deactivation of molecular-like catalysts due to particle sintering. In this respect, monitoring the dynamic changes of the catalyst structure under operating conditions would also allow to elucidate the deactivation pathway, which is a crucial aspect for catalyst optimization in both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.The studies presented herein serve to shed light on a variety of strategies adopted in the past to improve the efficiency of transition metal-based CO 2 RR catalysts.

        <p>Another promising perspective for future research is a more in-depth investigation of the organic/inorganic interface of hybrid materials, by combining the basic principles and concepts of conventional coordination chemistry with the methods traditionally employed in surface science. Several examples reported in this work showed that the electronic properties of metal catalysts can be effectively tuned by modulating the stereo-electronic features of the surrounding organic or heteroatom-rich framework (e.g. reticular effect in molecular catalysts encapsulated into porous 3D frameworks or organic molecules anchored to metal NPs or polycrystalline metallic surfaces). However, systematic studies on the nature of these interactions as well as their effect on catalysis are rare, leaving much room for future investigation. The extreme versatility of this approach also offers the opportunity to explore several different strategies for catalyst optimization, based on chemical (coordination) or physical (electrostatic, hydrophobic) interactions at the metal-organic interface. In this scenario, the outer coordination sphere effects, reminiscent of the spatial interactions occurring in the active site of enzymes, deserve to be studied in more detail in both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. For homogeneous molecular systems, they were rationalized to be an effective way to break scaling relationships, leading to an outstanding improvement of the catalytic rates and selectivity. In heterogeneous catalysis, these interactions have been less explored and can be described in terms of matrix effects, as recently reported for molecular catalysts embedded into conductive surfaces. 194 The development of novel model systems and in-depth experimental kinetic analysis would be extremely important to further rationalize and dissect these effects.Another promising perspective for future research is a more in-depth investigation of the organic/inorganic interface of hybrid materials, by combining the basic principles and concepts of conventional coordination chemistry with the methods traditionally employed in surface science.
